Accounting program Inoves up 
By MATT BRAMANTI 
News Writer 
Notre Dame's accountancy programs arc moving up in the world. According to the industry newsletter Public Accounting Report, the Mendoza College of Business' undergraduate pro­gram is now the fourth best in the country, while the graduate program maintained its fifth­place spot. 
The rankings are compiled from a poll of accountancy fac­ulty members at colleges and universities throughout the United States. 
Angie Kase, program manag­er or the graduate accounting program, attributed Notre Dame's success to the focultv and to undergraduate students who move into the graduate program. 
"We've lraditionally had a lot of strong undergrads from Notre Dame who continue here," Kase said. 
She also praised department chairman Tom Schaefer. 
"His membership in national accounting organizations has added to the visibility of the pro­gram," Kase said. Schaefer serves as president of the Accounting Programs Leadership Group, a board of the American Accounting

PLO advisor condemns Israel 
By MElANIE BECKER 
News Writer 

Diana Buttu, the Chief Legal Advisor for the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), addressed human rights viola­tions in Israel Monday at Saint Mary's Carroll Auditorium. 
Buttu was born and raised in Canada by her parents after they l1ed Palestine in the late 1940s. She attended Queens College in Canada, received a law degree from Stanford University and is currently pursuing a master's degree in human rights and refugee compensation from Stanford. 
Buttu encouraged the audi­ence to "think like a Palestinian," in order to under­stand the problems in the Middle East. She questioned the U.S. media's portrayal of events in Israel and said that she was concerned that U.S. citizens do not understand the truth of the situation. 
According to Buttu. the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is political. not religious. 
Land dispute has been the problem that has led the Palestinians and the Israelis to the brink of war, she said. Israeli occupation of Palestinian land has pushed Palestinians out of their homes and off their land and along the West Bank in Jerusalem and in Gaza there are segre­gated Israeli and Palestinian settlements, Buttu added. 
As Israeli communities grow and expand they are building through Palestinian Communities and destroying homes that are in the way, she said. 
"Get rid of the people, hold onto the land," Buttu said,

INSIDE COLUMN 
Banchalkon sidewalks 
This Inside Column is a personal request to the administration to ban all chalk writing on the sidewalks on cam­pus. 
I think everyone's noticed that chalk writing on sidewalks has become a lot 
more prominent this year. Until recently, the Peace Coalition seemed to have a monopoly on the idea with messages slamming possible military action in Iraq. Campus side­


walks have become Andrew Thagard particularly crowd­ed on football week­

people and crudely drawn chalk mes­sages vying for space. 
Lately, a chalk war seems to have erupted between the Peace Coalition and some unidentified chalk writers. Walking around campus the other day I noticed messages that read, "Beat up Poor People," "Human: the other white meat," "Global Warming + Nuclear Winter = Perfect Temperature" and "Let's have sex with Saddam." 
Ihave no idea who wrote that last one. 
These unidentified chalk artists also use the tactic of writing "Not!" after Peace Coalition messages, which can be pretty amusing. 
My personal favorite, however, is "DeBartolo Hall= Stupid." Clever, huh? 
These messages can be pretty enter­taining. It's also refreshing to know that students on campus can express them­selves in ways besides The Observer Viewpoint section. Despite this, I think all sidewalk chalk art should be banned. 
I mean the University's already on a roll here. They've banned sex, hard alcohol and limited tailgating. I think banning chalk on sidewalks is a logical next step. 
For an institution so concerned about looking aesthetically pleasing, I'm sur­prised they haven't considered this already. Every day, I see University groundskeepers toiling to keep the grass perfect, hedges trimmed and flowers blooming. If a leaf falls off a tree any­where on campus, someone is there to cloan it up. Idon't think it's fair to ruin the hard work of these people by scribbling chalk on quad sidewalks. 
Let's not forget the safety ramifications such a ban would have on the student body as well. 
Campus sidewalks are already crowd­ed, dangerous places, especially in the winter with ice. My walk to DeBartolo consists of dodging backpack wielding walkers, mad bicyclists and the occasional golf cart. 
I don't trust these people as it is. 
Adding distracting chalk messages on the sidewalk equals a formula for disas­ter. 
Now I know some people are already upset at this proposal. They're probably saying, "What about my right to free speech?" 
Well, we all have to make sacrifices sometimes. Free speech is great but not when it limits my right to walk to the Dining Hall without getting chalk on my shoes.

Officers debate funding play 
. Board fears approving senior project could set problematic precedent 
By SHANNON NELLIGAN 
News Writer 

Merideth Pierce, a senior theater major, requested funds from the Board of Governance (BOG) during the body's meeting Tuesday. These funds will allow her to 
complete her inten­sive senior compre­hensive in theater by directing the chil­dren's play, "Still Life with Iris" by Steven Dietz. she said. 

Pierce intends to present the play to the children who attend elementary school in the South Bend school dis­trict. 
"I am dedicated to doing this right and believe strong­ly in the power of art in a child's curriculum," Pierce 
said. 
This presen­tation is unique com­pared with traditional comprehen­sives in the theater department because the student is presenting and advertis­ing the play outside the 

Saint Mary's academic com­munity, Pierce said. 
Pierce said she is asking for money because she is required to purchase the rights and scripts to the play due to its audience of school­children.

Bishops' leader calls for healing 
. Critics have tried to capitalize on the scandal to undermine the Church's teachings 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
The head of the nation's Roman Catholic bishops pleaded for unity within the church Monday as he and his fellow prelates prepared to adopt a sex abuse policy that they promised will get offending clergy out of public ministry. 
Bishop Wilton Gregory, presi­dent of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, opened a gath­ering of the American hierarchy with a speech focusing on the church's future following a year of scandal. Fellow prelates stressed that the new policy -a reworked version of a plan they first approved in June -still bars guilty priests from all church work. including saying Mass pub­licly. 
"We will eradicate this plague, this horror from our midst," said Bishop Thomas Doran of Rockford, Ill., who helped draft the plan. 
At the bishops meeting last June. Gregory set the tone with an address about the abuse crisis in which he repeatedly apologized for the church's mishandling of molestation claims. Victim advo­cates noted the new focus Monday and accused bishops of participated in the discussion.

abandoning their commitment to reform. 
Gregory denied there was any change. But he also said the crisis that erupted in January with the case of a pedophile in the Boston Archdiocese has "fractured" rela~ tions among prelates, priests and rank-and-file Catholics. He acknowledged clergy feel "unfair­ly judged" by the misdeeds of a few. 
"We cannot and must never allow the particular positions that we have taken on such a serious issue, or even the mistakes that we have made in understanding and addressing it, to destroy our communion with one another in the Lord," Gregory said. 
Critics inside and outside of the church have tried to capitalize on the scandals to undermine Catholic teaching, Gregory said. He urged bishops to challenge them. 
Thousands of Catholics angry about how bishops have dealt with errant priests have joined reform movements.

Gunfire claims Palestinian toddler: 
Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian toddler and wounded two others in Gaza Monday. hospital offi­cials and witnesses said. The shooting came as Israeli leaders weighed a military response to a Palestinian shooting rampage that killed five people, including a mother and her two young sons. In the second straight day of violence to take children's lives, the 2-year-old boy was killed shortly after 7 
p.m. while he played ball in Rafah. Israel's army said forces had returned fire and knew of no casual­ties. while the boy's uncle said there had been no fighting in the area. Meanwhile. expectation mount­ed of an Israeli operation in the West Bank city of Nablus, where Israeli ot1icials said Sunday's shoot­ing rampage in Kibbutz Metzer -a community that symbolized Jewish-Arab coexistence -had been planned. Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, which are allied with Yasser Arafat's Fatah group, claimed responsi­bility for the kibbutz attack. 
NATIONAL NEWS BRIEFS 
Pre-9/11 rules barred box cutters: 
Airlines failed to enforce existing security guidelines on Sept. 11 that required airport screeners to confiscate box cutters from pas­sengers, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press. Government rules did not specifically bar the objects before last year's attacks, but the airlines were in charge of security then, with the Federal Aviation Administration overseeing their performance. The airlines issued a manual in 1994 that list­ed for screeners items passengers could not carry past airport checkpoints. The AP obtained a copy of the document, which included box cutters such as those purportedly used by the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers. "If they knew these were problems, why weren't they more responsible in protecting the public?" asked former FAA security chief Billie Vincent. 
Leaks may hurt Virginia sniper cases: 
Prosecutors in the Washington-area sniper case seem to have put together a tidy package: a weapon, witnesses and an alleged confession from one of' the suspects. Legal experts say, however, that leaks to the media about purported incriminating statements by 17-year-old John Lee Malvo could hurt the case. Virginia was given first shot at prosecuting Malvo and his fellow suspect, John Allen Muhammad, 41. because the state is considered most likely to impose the death penalty. A key element of the state's case emerged last week when investigators interrogated Malvo, and, according to published accounts. he confessed to several shootings. The teen's lawyers will try to get the statements barred from his trial on the ground that he was questioned without his court-appointed guardian or attorney.

According to Buttu, 70 percent of the population lives on two meals a day or less and 50 percent of the population is unemployed. Additionally, in the last two years 1.5 percent of the Palestinian.population has been injured or killed as a result ofterrorism, she said. 
In June of 1967 a resolution was passed by the United Nations calling for the with­drawal of Israeli forces in Gaza and the West Bank. Buttu said. Israeli forces remain today in violation of International Law, according to Buttu. 
The United States continues to support Israel in violation of its Foreign Policy Laws and a Pro-Israel lobby exists with­in this country which is sup­ported by the Christian-Right while no Palestinian Lobby exists to challenge the U.S.'s sur,port of Israel, she said. 
international community place pressure on Israel through trade embargos, visa require­ments for travel and with­drawal of financial support. 
"I want to see consistent application of the United States' Foreign Policy so that Israel is not above the law and Palestine is not placed below it," Buttu said. "If we continue to feed into the notion of get­ting rid of the people and hold­ing on to the land, there can never be peace in the Middle East."

IN BRIEF 
Study: CEOs saw 200 l pay raise 
Salaries and other pay perks for chief exec­utives rose last year in most industries, according to a research group's study released Monday, even as the economy slipped and the stock market fell. 
The private, New York-based Conference Board said the biggest increases in 2001 were for executives in energy and construction businesses. It was last November that Enron Corp. began its collapse in an accounting scandal and sent a shock through the energy trading industry. 
As Enron declared bankruptcy and account­ing troubles arose at other companies, includ­ing WorldCom and Adelphia, lavish pay arrangements for top executives began to receive criticism. New rules are being drawn for corporate accounting of some sources of executive enrichment, such as stock options. 
Wall Street Journal cuts 23 reporters 
Dow Jones & Co., which announced last week it would cut 230 jobs, said Monday that 23 Wall Street Journal reporters will be laid off and another eight are taking voluntary buyouts. 
Some of the laid-off employees will work through the end of the year, said Brigitte TrafTord, a spokeswoman for Dow Jones, pub­lisher of The Wall Street Journal and other media properties. She said two reporting teams at tho Journal will be eliminated, the New York law group and the regional eco­nomics team. 
Tom Lauricella. newsroom director for Dow Jones' union. the Independent Association of Publishers' Employees, said the cuts would hurt the Journal's coverage of stories such as scandals involving Worldcom, Enron and Martha Stewart. 
"These are people who have been at the cen tor of reporting on some of the biggest stories of the past year," ho said. "This is a core area of coverage for any national newspaper. and they've just sent these people packing." 
Accounting board draws fire 
 Oversight board to meet Wednesday 
Auociated Pren 
WASHINGTON 
The new board to oversee the accounting industry, steeped in controversy over the selection of former FBI director William Webster as its chairman, plans to hold its first meeting behind closed doors Wednesday. 
The controversy already has brought the resigna­tions of Harvey Pitt, chair­man of the Securities and Exchange Commission. and the SEC's head accountant. 
The five-member accounting oversight board plans to privately discuss administrative matters, such as office space and staff, several people close to the matter said Monday. They spoke on condition of anonymity. 
That prompted an objec­tion from Barbara Roper, director of investor protec­tion at the Consumer Federation of America. 
"The whole point of creat­ing this board was to restore investor confi­dence," she said in an inter­view. "They will further the impression that the public interest isn't being served."

Students often go to extremes at this University. From Sunday until Thursday, they pour over books at the library until 2 a.m., attend endless lec­tures and meetings and spend hours

For better or worse, my friends and I are no exception. We don't just study; we pull all-nighters. We don'tjust party; we make a game of it. Last weekend my roommates and I fared particularly well in this University's cultural competition of "going to the extreme." When on Sunday everyone began to tell their stories from Thursday, Friday and Saturday, we could definitively prove that we had mastered the art of enjoying a week­end that starkly contrasted with the week before it. 
Like my roommates and I last week­end, Republicans dominated on Election Day. They retained their hold on the House and gained the majority in the Senate. They also fared well in gubernatorial races. The country seems to be moving towards an extreme -a political one.

wake up at 6 a.m. to finish a paper, I think of the weekend. The possibility of fun with friends a day or two in the future allows me to resist the urge to fall asleep and get my work done. 
Republican dominance could help politicians get something accomplished in Washington in the next two years. It might allow for the passage of legisla­tion for which the country demonstrat­ed its support last Tuesday. In addition to pushing through policies that stalled in the Democrat-controlled Senate, Republicans are also aiming to get approval for a number of conservative judicial nominees in the federal courts. 
However, Republicans need to recog­nize as they pursue their agenda and push for judicial nominees that going to the extreme could harm the country in the long run -especially in regard to the civil liberties and the environ­ment. 
The Homeland Security Act, legisla­tion high on the Bush agenda, could allow intelligence officials to compile data on the private lives of Americans. The Bush administration may also consider a second attempt at drilling in the Alaskan National Wildlife Reserve -a move that would threaten one of the country's most magnificent natural treasures. Furthermore, judi­cial nominees favored by the Bush administration have a track record of striking down environmental regula­tions in favor of business. 
After all, anyone at this University

would tell Republicans that extremes aren't always healthy. Students some­times drink too much and get sent to the hospital. Exhausted from a week of practical all-nighters, I collapsed after the Boston College game two weeks ago and slept for 16 hours. In the end. I only survive here by trying to strike a balance between doing what I have to do and doing what I want to do. 
Republicans might want to enact a very conservative agenda, but for the health of the country they need to lis­ten to the moderates in the fold. In reality, they did not receive a definitive mandate from voters to go to the extreme. The races in Missouri and Minnesota that shifted the balance in the Senate were both determined by less than three percentage points. 
The responsibility falls on Democrats to stand their ground over the next two years to ensure that Republicans maintain a balance. Like the students here, the Bush administration and House and Senate Republicans must realize that moderation is the key. !t might not be what they really want, but in the end, it's in the country's best interest.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Irish must remember to win with honor, lose with grace 
I havo been a Notre Dame football fan since I could walk. Watching Sunday morning replays of the Notre Dame games were the highlight of my week. Ono of the worst days of my life was when USC's Anthony Davis scored six touchdowns against the Irish. 
Heccntly, my family and I moved to the Annapolis area, and as a lover of college football. I pur chased season tick­ets to Navy lootball. I have grown to admire and respect what Navy Football and the United Slates Naval /\cademy rcpre sent, even with their dismal won-loss record. 
1was deeply saddened by an incident this weekend in Baltimore toward the end of the hard fought contest. After the Irish scored the winning touch­down with less than two minutes left, the Notre Dame Leprechaun danced in joy across the field and then stomped on the Navy "N" at the SO-yard line. He made sure the entire 70,000-plus crowd saw this mockery as he stomped several times, emphatically. 
Since this happened during the TV timeout, I doubt the national TV audience saw this, for which I am thankful. I did find it difficult to explain this to my nine-year-old basketball playing daughter who was sitting next to me. And I cannot even begin lo describe the faces of the Navy Alumni who were sitting around me after this display. 
I think I need to remind this mascot and those who follow the greatest football fran­chise on earth that you have to answer to a 
higher moral authority as a leader in college athletics. I do not think I am going out on a limb here by saying that I doubt if any one Navy football player could even make the Notre Dame foot­
ball team. yet Navy out-played and out hustled Notre Dame 
for 58 minutes. Players at Notre Dame are likely all either high school All-Americans or 
first team All-State. Navy players are 
usually second team All-County. Keep in mind that this 
summer, while most of Notre Dame's graduating football seniors will be fighting for a job in the NFL, most of 
Navy's graduating midshipmen will like­ly be deployed on warships in the Persian Gulf. 
As Edward Bennet Williams, deceased trial lawyer and ex-owner of the Baltimore Orioles once said, "Through my years of contest liv­ing, I have learned how to win with humility and lose with grace." 
Rick Schwitzer Severna Park, Md. Nov. II 

Support for Rice and the Pope's teachings 
It is with disturbance and some sorrow that I read Chris Scally's article and previous Viewpoint pieces attacking Professor Rice. Mr. Scally writes about the "stupidity," "worth­lessness" and arrogance of Professor Rice's writings. Nothing justifies such violent language. 
Mr. Scally accuses Professor Rice of not presenting enough support for his views; yet Mr. Scally's piece lacks logical foun­dation by confining itself to attacking Professor Rice personally. I appreciate Professor Rice's column as an effort to point read ers toward Catholic teaching. I also appreciate the responses as long as they are based on serious thought. 
I would like to suggest that there is no arrogance in deferring to the Catechism or the Pope's teaching but that the arrogance rather lies in attacking, without offering substantive support, a man expounding these teachings. The Catechism and the Pope's teaching are based on research, deliberate thought, and input by distinguished men and women. Perhaps Mr. Scally should start by challenging his own views before attacking those that many faithful and educated people believe to be truthful. 
Mr. Scally dislikes being told what to think and believes that there is more than one correct opinion. It is easy to overlook in how many ways we are told what to think but only oppose it in few circumstances. We are told to think that it is proper to eat with utensils (silverware, chopsticks). but couldn't it be just as proper to eat with our hands? Additionally. some matters may have only one correct answer: either there is a God or there is none. 
Professor Rice has served his country in the U.S. Marine Corps and has taught at Notre Dame for several decades; the list of his accomplishments and honors is considerable. I had the honor and pleasure of attending Professor Rice's last torts class. It was one of the most memorable experiences of my aca­demic career at Notre Dame. 
I support serious debate, but I oppose attacks based on mere polemics. The potential of great thought and scholarship at Notre Dame is remarkable. Let's not destroy this potential.

What would Democrats do differently? 
I'm somewhat suspicious of the plea given by Danny Richter in his Nov. 8 let­ter, "Republicans, what are you going to do?" I infer from his letter that he real­ly doesn't want answers to the concerns that he expounded upon, but since I really don't know what the motives of his Viewpoint piece were, I won't specu­late more than I have already. Here is my response. 
I am nol a Republican or a Democrat. I have only slight sym­pathies for the Republican Party, but quite frankly there aren't enough differences between the parties to merit my support for either. 
Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution outlines the limited powers of the federal government. All of them arc clearly listed. It might be interesting for the big government propo­nents of the Republican and Democratic parties to read up on them. They might learn something. 
As to Richter's concerns, I don't see what difference a Republican or Democratic administration could make. r,;,1;I:);'.:iI~'~>.;~·lllill~~......._......"'........,....... ,-:-'· ··.,--·····
Let's look at the first concern -global \\ warming. H.ichtcr considers global warm­ing a fact. What does that mean? In 2001 the National Academy of Sciences released a report on global warming. One of the 11 scientists, Dr. Richard Lindzen, wrote an article in the June 11, 2001 issue of the Wall Street Journal stating. "The NAS never asks that all participants agree to all elements of a report, but rather that the report represent the span of views. This the full report did, making clear that there is no consensus, unanimous or otherwise, about long term cli­mate trends and what causes them." 
So is global warming a fact? And even if it were, what can be done? It makes no difference what the administration of one country does when so many coun­tries share the planet. And how was the previous administration's stance on global warming different than the current one? 
The next concern was water. Again, since nothing concrete was mentioned about water, I'm not entirely sure how to respond. But let me use an interesting fact that I recently happened upon from the book "Showdown" by Los Angeles commentator Larry Elder, "For seven years, 11 months and 28 days in office, Clinton kept the arsenic levels exactly where they had been since 1942 -at 50 parts per billion. In the waning hours of his administration, Clinton reduced the allowable parts from 50 to 10. Bush put it back to 50." Of course. Bush was 
slammed for this act, but it seems very few people really cared about the truth of the event. Again my question is this: What differ­ence does a Democratic administration make? As far as the war is concerned, I have mixed feelings. The protection of the United States is one of the few powers granted to the federal government. I'm not totally sure that what the U.S. government is currently doing is truly protecting us, but I don't know that it is not. It certainly did not stop the attacks on 
Sept. 11. Perhaps if more resources are available to the federal government for defense, then we will be able to avoid future attacks. If it is protecting us by tak­ing on Iraq, then the government is doing what it was created to do. 
Richter also asks how the federal gov­
ernment is supposed to educate its people when it spends so mych money on defense. If Richter would go back to the Constitution, 
he would see that the federal government is 
not supposed to finance the education of its people. Again, I ask him to go back to Article I. Section 8. He might also look into the billions of dol 
lars that the federal government has put into failing educational programs like Title 1. The solutions to Richter's concerns won't ever be solved by a 
Democratic or Republican administration. Unfortunately, the answer to his editorial question is no dUTerent than if it read "Democrats, what are you going to do?" Regardless of party, the answer would be the same: Spend more taxpayer money and get little to no results.

The New Orange is a band with flavor 

By MARIA SMITH A.,sistanr Scene Edicor 
Thursday night Orbit Music was ringing with live rock music. The pro­motional gig may have been small compared to Saturday night at Benchwarmers or Halloween at the State, but the band named The New Orange played their set well and jumped a.round the stage with all their usual energy. They pointed curious shoppers towards their display, Hotter, Newer Sounds by The New Orange, on sale now. 
The New Orange, one of the rela­tively few· South Bend or Notre Dame bands in the area, is beginning to appear on the music scene at house parties, at Cheers and at other spots around town. Vocalist Higgs Boson, guitarist Mneumonic, and bassist ElCordobes (technically known as Beau Bratton, Michael Anderson and Andrew Mitchell) began the year in a drummer-less slump, but drummer Brian Zampell auditioned for the band after seeing their advertisements around campus. With the advent of the Zampire, the band got back on track. 
In addition to playing local engage­ments, the band has toured other cities, going as far as Philadelphia. The group hopes to start playing more often in Chicago and expanding their territory. 
The New Orange categorizes their sound in the category of garage rock, a recently expanding musical move­ment best known for newer bands like The Hives and The Strokes and older bands like The Kinks. While most garage rock bands have certain traits in common, the genre encompasses a lot of different sounds and attitudes. Garage rock is characteristically straightforward, without synthesizers or other intrusive sounds. While the music is often unsophisticated in 
terms of chords and structures, the simple style can showcase interesting instrumentals and lyrics. 
The New Orange sometimes takes the simplicity of garage rock too seriously. Some tunes lack both instrumentation _and lyrical intelligence. Their music can descend into a mere grating noise. This may be intentional, though, a result of their slightly twisted senses of humor. "You and I, we're gonna learn the alphabet, yeah, Sesame Street," whines the vocal in track five of Hotter, Newer Sounds. Whether it's humor or just Jack of inspira­tion, some of the lyrics seem to be written by a 3-year-old. 
However, at their best Anderson and Mitchell's compo­sitions have a lot of energy, with some unique lyrics and good gui­tar riffs. 
With such a varying sound. even the band has trouble defin­ing their music. "I can't really describe their sound, but it's why I got into them," said Zampell. "It gives me the ability to do whatever I want on the drums." 
"It's high-brow music," said Anderson in a more abstract description. 
"That's a lie," Bratton said. "It's music for the masses." "For the high-brow masses," said Anderson. 
While the musicians have a sense of humor about themselves and their lifestyle, they work hard and take their music seriously. The group prac­tices every day in the basement of their house near campus. 
Hotter, Newer Sounds was recorded at Home Buddies Studio, also in the basement of their house. 
Like all starting bands, The New Orange struggles with space and

equipment constraints. Making a band 
well known takes good recordings, but 
high quality recording requires more 
resources than many starting bands 
can come up with. "You can tell the studio is really 
small on our recordings," said 
Anderson. "We need a bigger space." "We're as loud as our equipment 
allows us to be," said Mitchell. "And 
that's not very loud. In fact, it's quite 
pleasant." The band is looking for more than just a bigger space to suc­ceed. They are currently searching for a. manager to help them books gigs, make T-shirts and take care of other small but important tasks involved with band life. 
The band also is at odds about getting producer as well. 
"I don't want a producer coming in and getting his dirty little hands all over our sound," said Mitchell. 
"I really think we need a producer," said Bratton. 
The band members come from all parts of the coun­try. Zampell Iives in Boston, Mass.; Mitchell comes from Butte, Mont.; Anderson comes from Napa Valley, Calif.: and Bratton is a native of Osh Kosh, Wis. 
In addition to their differ­ent hometowns, the band members' musical e<luca­
. tions have little in common either. Zampell has a histo­ry drumming for bagpipe bands and Mitchell actually began his musical career playing saxophone. 
Made of both current and former students, the three original members have played locally under the name The New Orange for about six months. Before that they played under differ­ent names, including Chapped and Frighteningly Obtuse Triangle. 

Like most bands featured on VHl 's Behind the Music, the band also seems to have had a tumultuous histo­ry. They claim to have broken up peri­odically over various disagreements. 
"We've kicked each other out of the band several times," said Mitchell. "We kicked Mneumonic out for a year because he had too many bootleg Dave Matthews Band CDs." 
Nevertheless, all the members cur­rently seem devoted to improving their sound and furthering the career of The New Orange. The band has dis­cussed the possibility of moving to San Diego. They would enjoy both the improved weather and the music scene of the area. The band did, how­ever, note some advantages of South Bend for a starting band. 
"This is a good location for a band because it's a central location. You're close to Chicago, Detroit and Indianapolis," said Mitchell. "It's good for touring." 
Leaving the area soon would also means saying goodbye to Zampirc. who is a junior in the engineering program. 
"This is a lesson for all you kids," said Mitchell. "This rock and roll thing gets you nowhere. Stay in school.· 
Whether or not The New Orange moves on to greener pastures, they'll continue to be seen for a while around town. Their Web site, www.thenewor­ange.com, offers a glimpse into the minds behind the music. It also offers a free download of track five off' Hotter, Newer Sounds.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Aguilera strips herself of musical talent 
By C. SPENCER BEGGS 
Scene Edi tor 
It's u good thing thal Christina /\guilora's latest album. Stripped, came along when it did; for a minute. it looked like the world was running short of over­produced bleach-blonde pop starlets who are competing to set the world record for best outfit created from a piece of dental floss and a gum wrapper. 

Stripped is a terrible album filled with Aguilera's inane wanna-be-a-diva vocal stylings layered an overly diverse selec­tion of musical genres. The only standout track on the album is the current single ''Dirrty." With its rolling hip-hop founda­tion supporting Aguilera's breathy vocals, the song has a decent beat to dance to and is fun for its rowdy night club feel. The track features Redman and obviously owes a lot to his influence. Of course. "a lot" in this context mean "almost every­thing." 
But enough about the music. let's get right down to what this album is really about: Aguilera's fantastic, surgically enhanced assets. 
Even with danceable beats, Aguilera's single is basically an insipid five-minute descriptlon of her supple, nubile body. But with such phenomenal cover art of the (fittingly) stripped pop queen, who needs to shell out the extra five-spot for a copy of the latest Rolling Stone, which also features a serving of Aguilera au nature!? 
Then again, who needs to shell out $17 for a CD when a yearlong subscription to Playboy is only $12? Heck, you could get a subscription to the country's finest gen­tlemen's magazine and a copy of the genie-out-of-a-bottle Rolling Stone and have well over 13 times the amount of silicone-implanted, collagen-injected and apparently nippleless women for the same price as this worthless piece of 
laser­imprinted plastic.. 
I\ s 

devoid of any type of soul that e v e r y other cor­porate-ere­ation pop album is, Stripped marks a new low. Aguilera has left the realm of edgy PG­13 exhibitionism and achieved a new level of overproduced eroticism almost unparalleled in the industry. Even worse, this image is apparently trying to be passed off as some sort of strong woman feminism. 
The sexually ambivalent libertine ver­sus liberated image Aguilera's corporate Doctor Frankensteins at RCA have been hocking like a set of Ginsu steak knives is not even remotely believable at this point. Didn't anyone catch the fact that her last major release was entitled My Kind of Christmas? Apparently, all Christina wanted for Christmas was no credibility. 
Then again, this isn't exactly a great surprise. Wasn't this the same ex­Mouseketeer who declared in her first single "Genie in a Bottle" that we could be with her as long as we "rub, rubbed her the right way?" Yeah, remember when we thought Britney was the trashy one? 

If Aguilera wants her image to be as sexualized, "dirrty" and objectified as she portrays herself, let her have it. It's a shame that a singer with real vocal talent isn't exploiting that instead ol' herself. Luckily, nobody stays the "it" the girl very long based on sex appeal alone; even sili­cone doesn't hold out against the curse of turning 30. 
Everyone knows that sex sells. But sex used to be used to sell albums, but now albums are being used to sell sex. Something's rotten in the state of MTV.

Chaos knock out defending champs 
By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN Sports Writer 
Last week, Cavanaugh sport­ed shirts that read, "Leave no doubt." However, many did doubt the Chaos until the end. 
In a game that featured big plays, the biggest play came at the end of the game by Cavanaugh quarterback M~g Meyers. However, she wasn't on offense. 
After leading Cavanaugh on two consecutive scoring drives, Meyers intercepted a pass as a defensive back to preserve Cavanaugh's 13-12 win over defending champion Welsh Family. 
Welsh Family looked to have control over the game early, as 
. talented quarterback Lauren Hoeck completed 70-yard touchdown bomb to wide receiver Bethany Barker. The extra point pass attempt, how­ever, was ruled out of bounds and incomplete. 
The high-octane offense of Welsh Family did not stop, as Vanessa Lichon caught a 20­yard Hoeck pass for another touchdown. 
Meanwhile, the Chaos option offense struggled through the first half. Finally, they put together a touchdown drive that included two key fourth­and-five conversions, and two great catches by Nancy Powaga, one for the touch· down. Although the oxtra point failed, the mid-game adjust­ment to a passing game bene­fited Cavanaugh. 
"When we switched our offensive focus from the option to a passing-oriented game, it really opened things up, and we were able to be success­ful," Powaga said. 
The Chaos did not stop there. Instead. they got the ball back after a huge defensive stand, and proceeded to march up the field again. This time, Meyers hit standout receiver Jenny Nokes for the touch­down. Down one, Cavanaugh was successful on the conver­sion with 40 seconds remain­ing. 
Meyers intercepted fellow quarterback Hoeck on the next play, ending the game. 
Cavanaugh continued their unbeaten season, as they dethroned Welsh Family, dish ing them only their third loss in four years. 
"We knew that we had to play one of the best games of our lives to beat them," Powaga said. "People thought that this game was over, but it wasn't. We had 1,000 times more heart than they did."

PE dominates BP in 20-12 semifinal 
By LISA REIJULA Spons Writer 
"Next stop, Stadium!" was the cheer chanted from the Pasquerilla East sideline after the hall's 20-12 victory over Breen-Phillips in Sunday's semi­final. 
PE dominated BP from the opening minutes of the game. The Pyros scored on the opening drive and then intercepted the Babes on their first offensive play. 
PE quarterback Abbey Coons calmly Jed her team on offense. The senior standout threw for another touchdown in the first half to give the Pyros the early 13-point lead. 
Coons faced little pressure and had plenty of time to make deci­sions. Junior receiver Kathryn Lent caught two touchdown passes and Kristin Marcuccilli had one for PE. 
BP (7-1) struggled for the majority of the first half on both sides of the ball. The defense had trouble finding an answer for Coons and her receivers. 
The second half brought renewed enthusiasm for both teams. A long run by BP quar­terback Atasha Potter gave her team momentum. The resulting touchdown pass by Potter to Lauren Ohlenforst got the Babes on the board, but the extra point attempt failed. 
The PE defense buckled down repeatedly tipping passes and sacking Potter twice giving the ball to its offense. A touchdown pass by Coons put the Pyros up 20-6. 
Again it was Potter who brought BP back. Another huge gain on a run brought the Babes to the 2-yard line. Ohlenforst caught Potter's throw to cut the score to 20-12 but that was all the Babes could muster. 
"We didn't expect to have such a good season," Ohlenforst said. "This loss was a wakeup call, but our coaches told us there is no reason to hang our heads." 
Terifay likes PE's chances against Cavanaugh despite a 28­0 loss in the season opener. "We're both different teams now. We are a strong team and all of us contribute," Terifay said. "We will just concentrate on what we need to do and we're ready to avenge our loss."

Field goal sends Siegfried back to the Stadium 
By PAT LEONARD Spores Writer 
John Nowak's kick sailed through the uprights and the Siegfried Ramblers rushed the field raising their white helmets. They had done it, and they want­ed everyone to know: Siegfried will return to the Stadium. 
With a 23-yard field goal by Nowak in overtime, first-seeded Siegfried bested fourth-seeded Fisher, 3-0, in a semifinal game at Riehle fields Sunday. 
The Green Wave's only loss of the regular season came in their first game against Siegfried, a 17 -0 defeat in which Ramblers quarterback and outside line­backer Bill Bingle threw two touchdown passes and intercept­ed Fisher once. On Sunday, Fisher intercepted Bingle once and allowed no touchdovms. yet the Green Wave offense had equal difficulty advancing the ball. 
It all came down t.o one kick, a big kick. Nowak felt no pressure. 
"I knew the line would hold their blocks and give me time," Nowak said. "I just treated it like a routine extra point, because that's basically what it was." 
In overtime, each team has four cracks at the end zone from the 10-yard line. Even after watching Fisher kicker Carl Elkins miss a 22-yard thip shot and having Fisher call a timeout to ice the Siegfried kicker. Nowak remained focused. 
"John is confident, and confi­dence is a great thing to have in a kicker," Siegfried coach John Torgenson said. "I had no doubt putting him out there. He doesn't miss." 
Siegfried kicked the field goal on third down in overtime as a precaution. 
"If we would have fumbled the snap, we told the holder just to drop on it," Torgenson said. "It gave us two chances." 
The teams finished with simi­lar offensive stats. Siegfried amounted 122 yards of total offense compared to Fisher's 
114. Siegfried's Bingle threw for

47 yards on 5-for-12 passing. Fisher quarterback Andy Pfiester had 59 yards on 6-12 passing. Ramblers running back Tim Breitbach ran for 68 yards on 16 carries. Cameron Chappell gained 41 yards on the ground for the Green Wave. 
A botched Fisher punt early in the first quarter gave Siegfried the ball at the Fisher 20. Fisher held them on fourth-and-one and regained possession. 
In the fourth quarter, a deter­mined Siegfried offense marched downfield behind Bingle's arm, going 64 yards on 10 plays. A false start moved the Ramblers back, but a late hit on Bingle as he scampered out of bounds cost the Green Wave 15 yards and kept the Siegfried drive alive. Fisher's Lee Gettler put a stop to that, picking off Bingle at the 15­yard line and taking it back 20 yards. 
Fisher was never able to capi­talize after making big plays on the defensive end. The Green Wage missed a 35-yard field goal in regulation and then missed a 22-yarder in overtime.

Fisher's missed opportunities left the game up to John Nowak, holder Nate Rapche, and the Siegfried line. They did not dis­appoint. 
"It was a hard fought game. the best game we played all year as far as both teams putting effort out there," Torgcnson said. "It's nice to come out on top, but Fisher did an excellent job and they deserve a lot of credit. Now. we hope to win in the Stadium."

Usually there's nothing all that special about a 3-yard pass to a wide receiver. Yet that pass may have been the one of the most important in the game as Alumni knocked defending champion Dillon out of the play­offs with an 8-0 victory Sunday. 
The reason for the winning margin being eight instead of seven was a fake extra point the Dawgs ran to perfection after scoring the only touchdown of the game. 
Holder and quarterback Chris Cottingham took the snap and stood up to a throwing position where he found wide receiver Corey Harkins open in the end zone for the two-point conver­sion. 
"We've used (that play] quite a few times," Alumni captain Steve Keppel said. "We've

always thought it's important to 
go for two on your first touch­
down because it puts pressure 
on the other team." 

Dillon was unable to rise to the challenge, ending the game with three turnovers and several crucial penalties. A pivotal call was a personal foul against Dillon that eventually led to Alumni's sole touchdown, 
Dillon captain Patrick Esper said his team had no one to blame but itself for the final out­come. 
"We put ourselves in that posi­tion," he said. "We had chances to tie up the game. I don't want to point to any one play; it's a team game and you can't lay it all on any one player." 
The only scoring drive of the game started on the Alumni 42­
yard line and spanned 14 plays 
until Chris Cottingham ran a 
successful 1-yard sneak on the 
goal line to give Alumni the lead. 
The two point-conversion play 
made the score 8-0, the only 
points the Dawgs would ulti 
mately need. 
Shortly before the end of the 

second quarter, Dillon was able 
to drive to the Alumni 35-yard 
line, but any hope of a score was 
extinguished when Alumni's T.J. 
Strachota intercepted Big Red 
quarterback Michael Johnson. 
Dillon's best scoring opportu­nity came shortly into the fourth quarter, when the Big Red was able to reach the Alumni 3-yard line. A holding penalty set Dillon back, and the drive ended on the Alumni 10 when Dawg line­backer Tommy Demko picked ofT a Johnson pass. 
Johnson was also intercepted near the end of the fourth quar­ter at the Alumni 34 by defen­sive back A.J. Remen. 
Dillon knocked Alumni out of the semifinals in last year's play­offs and the Dawgs were espe­cially happy to return the favor to their rival. 
"If they would have beaten us or not, it's still a great game to play Dillon," Keppel said. "To beat them twice in one year [including a 14-0 regular season win] is a major accomplish­ment."

5ENDWICH INDEX

Miami reclaims top spot; Irish still ranked third 
After five weeks of dancing among the top five. the Hurricanes have final­ly regained their No. 1 spot in the Sendwich Index. Miami used a solid road win against Teunessec and a loss by former No. 1 Kentucky with no time remaining. While this may be the play of the year, Virginia Tech and Syracuse likely pro­vided the most exciting game of the year.

Tennessee mustered only 200 yards of offense, morn than a third of which came on a 74-yard run by Cedric Houston on the second play of lhe game. Houston's dash set up Tennessee's lone field goal. 
Miami took over and cruised to a 26­3 victory behind Hoisrnan hopefuls Ken Dorsey and Willis McGahee. Dorsey was 19-for-37 for 244 yards and a touchdown while McGahee ran the ball 29 times for 151 yards and a score. Kicker Todd Sievers did the rest, making four of five field goals. 
The loss was the fourth of the year for Tennessee, as they settled in at No.

Despite a disappointing season, the Orangemen won their third game in a row, while handing Virginia Tech its second consecutive loss. Virginia Tech dropped five spots to No. 20, while Syracuse skyrocketed from No. 104 to No. 52. 
Bucking Broncos 
The Broncos of Boise State have some kick this season. For years. they 

-
have been infamous for playing on a blue turf field, but the Broncos are finally getting some recognition for what they do on that field. 
Boise State owns a 6-0 record in the WAC and a 9-1 overall record, with their lone loss coming at Arkansas. The Broncos should cruise in their final two games against Louisiana Tech (3"6) and at Nevada (5-5). 
With 144 points on 24 touchdowns, halfback Brock Forsey is the nation's leading scorer. Forsey is 38 points ahead of the rest of the pack and he's part of the reason why Boise State's offense leads the naLion in scoring, averaging 47.9 points per game. 
Despite their prolific numbers and a No. 23 ranking in the coaches poll. Boise State may not be going any­where for a bowl game this year. The Broncos will likely be playing in the Humanitarian Bowl on their blue home turf where and face the No. 8 team from the Big 12. 
The Broncos will probably receive offers f'rom larger bowl games, but the WAC o!licials, with a likely scenario of only three bowl-eligible teams, would like to keep the Broncos in one of its three bowl ties -the Humanitarian Bowl, the Hawaii Bowl and the Silicon Valley Football Classic. 
Boise State is currently ranked No. 33 in the Sendwich Index. They peaked as high as No. 21 two weeks ago.

He was optimistic after the game, but coach Mike Martz said Monday the 2000 NFL MVP will be listed as ques­tionable. 
The Chargers held Faulk to 72 total yards -36 rushing and 36 receiving. He ran for at least 150 yards in each of the three previous games.

The two-time British Open champi­on was allowed only five sponsors' exemptions in 2002, along with what­ever majors or World Golf Championships for which he was eligi­ble. He wound up playing 13 times, and made the cut in all four majors. 
Norman will not claim "home cir­cuit" status for the 2003 season. Foreign-born players can use that to play their home tours without having to get a release from the PGA Tour. 
Instead, the PGA Tour will allow Norman to play a liberal amount of overseas events without making him play at least 12 tour events to retain his membership. Norman gives up his voting privileges under the compro­mise. 
Referee doll found on 
Paterno's door 

Joe Paterno's dispute with officials has reached a new level. 
An effigy of a football official, hung with a string around its neck and a yellow flag in hand, was on the front door of the Penn State coach's home Sunday. 
Paterno has been frustrated with officials this season, as all three of No. 16 Penn State's losses -to Iowa, Michigan and Ohio State -have involved questionable calls. 
Against Iowa, one official ruled a catch in overtime good, and a second official called it out of bounds. Penn State lost that game 42-35, and Paterno raced down the field and grabbed the jersey of an official to protest.Michigan, a disputed call denied the Nittany Lions a chance at a potential game-winning field goal. 
Against Ohio State, Penn State's last drive stalled when Zack Mills' pass landed in front of receiver Bryant Johnson. Replays appeared to show Ohio State cornerback Chris Gamble holding Johnson. No flag was thrown, and Ohio State won the game 13-7.

WOMENS TENNIS 
Salas defeats teammate Connelly to win title 
By MARK ZAVODNYIK 
Sports Writer 
Despite a silence that filled the air at the Eck Tennis Pa\·ilion. Notre Dame's Alicia Salas prevailed to win the sin­gles championship of the Eck Classic. 
The reason for the lack of cheering was that Salas faced freshman teammate Lauren Connelly in the championship match. Salas managed to over­come the tension and earned a tough 6-4. 6-1 victory to clinch lhe Blue Flight Championship. Salas said that she was excited about the victory, but it felt strange to be playing a team­mate. 
"I didn't like it at all," Salas said. 
Salas used confidence gained over the first two rounds of the tournament to vault her into the championship match, a formula that she has used throughout the fall season. Salas was par­ticularly happy with her aggres­sive play, good ground strokes and lack of mental mistakes. 
In the championship match, Salas met her toughest competi­tion of the tournament in Connelly. 
"She did a really good job," Salas said. 
Connelly finished her first fall campaign with an 8-5 singles record, highlighted by two wins over top-70 opponents. 
With the victory, Salas, the

86th ranked player in the coun­try this fall, moved her fall sin­gles record to 11-4. 
"I think .it was the best tennis I've played this fall," Salas said. "I was very confident playing at home" 
The Eck Classic, a yearly event hosted by Notre Dame, saw this year's best perfor­mance by the Irish womens ten­nis team. The final tournament of the fall season, No1:re Dame competed against Syracuse, Purdue, Indiana and Louisville. 
Salas was not the only mem­ber of the Irish team to ·capture a singles title in the Eck Classic. Freshman Kelly Nelson cap­tured her first collegiate tourna­ment title with a dominating 6­0, 6-1 victory of Kristine Holte of Syracuse to clinch the Gold Flight singles title. Nelson is the first Notre Dame freshman to win a singles title in the Eck Classic since 1988. 
"Being a freshman, I didn't have much experience, but I had nothing to lose," Nelson said. 
Nelson posted impressive come-from-behind victories in the second and third rounds that set her on the path to the final. 
Although only a freshman, Nelson led the Irish in singles this fall with a 12-5 record. 
In doubles, the Irish duo of senior captain Katie Cunha and freshman Kristina Stastny reached the championship match before being ousted 8-6

Ugly, but a win 
 Irish struggle in win over EA Sports AH-Stars 
By ANDREW SOUKUP 
Spom Writer 
It wasn't pretty, but it was a win. 
Despite connecting on just 4-of-19 3-point attempts and withstanding a late charge from the EA Sports All-Stars, the Irish won their final exhibition game of the season Monday, 81­64. 
"Like Coach says, it's not how you do it. We're going to have games like this in the Big East, but a win's a win," Matt Carroll said. "We didn't do anything too flashy to get the crowd out of their seats. which we'd like to have, but we have to learn how to win these games." 
Carroll in particular showed how the Irish relied on nearly everything but their perimeter shooting. The senior guard started the game by missing a pair of wide-open 3-point attempts and ended the first half with just four points. 
But Carroll rallied in the 

second half to finish with a 
game-high 18 points. He 
also tallied seven rebounds 
and six steals. 
Carroll's shooting strug­gles were typical of an Irish squad that struggled to find the basket on long-range jumpers, connecting on 29­of-72 attempts from the field. 
"They really kind of hugged us and took us away and forced us to do some other things," Irish coach Mike Brey said. ''That's kind of new territo­ry for us. Can you win a game without the lightning strikes from the 3-point line?" 
The Irish proved they could. At times, Monday's game appeared less of an exhibition and more of a Big East clash. But even though their shots weren't falling, the Irish responded by driving to the basket, grabbing 18 offensive rebounds, shutting the All­Stars down on defense and scoring points on transition. 
"We didn't shoot well, but I think that's a good sign," said Chris Thomas, who fin­ished with 17 points and six assists. "If we can put up this many points and not shoot well, we'll be fine." 
The Irish received a little 
bit of a scare from the All­
Stars. EA Sports scored the 
first six points of the game 
and held the Irish scoreless 
for the first two minutes. 
Although Notre Dame 
opened up a 35-22 lead using an 18-4 run toward the end of the first half, the All-Stars mounted a brief rally at the end of the game. 
Trailing 61-40, the All­Stars reeled off a 14-3 run, cutting the Irish lead to 10. But that was as close as they would get as Notre Dame handily pulled away for the win. 
"They're very hard on themselves, and they just didn't feel good about them­selves tonight," Brey said. "Certainly there's some things we can improve on, but they've got high stan­dards, and thev're hard on themselves. which is great as a coach." 
One of the bright spots for Notre Dame was the play of Jordan Cornette, who injured his ankle in a scrim­mage last week but played 22 minutes Monday. Cornette entered the game early. and his quickness down low transformed the Irish defense. He finished with eight points, seven rebounds and two steals. 
"I felt a lot better," Cornette said. "It felt kind of sore early in the week, they put me in progressively this week through practice, and I was ready to go tonight."
