Green Party leader makes campaign stop in Chicago 
By NICK SWEEDO News Writer 
When Ralph Nader stepped to the podium to greet the packed Illinois University at Chicago pavilion in Chicago, he received a thunderous standing ovation louder than the aver­age Joyce Center pep rally. 
Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate and founder or the modern consumer movement, has been traveling across the country trying to gain support for not only his candidacy but also for a new progressive movement. The event included appearances by Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder and talk show host Phil Donahue. All had high praise for Nader's character and integrity. 
"I would like to thank Ralph and the Green Party for giving people who care something to believe in," said Vedder. 
Nader's address to the crowd covered two main points. He bemoaned the power that corporate America has over the working man and illustrated how lit­tle difference there is between a vote for Bush and a vote for Gore. 
"About 20 years ago, something start­ed to happen," said Nader. who refuses 

to accept soft money contributions. "The two parties became vigorous competitors for the same business cash in their campaigns. They began to increasingly morph into one corpo­rate party with two heads wearing different make-up. We saw that on the debate in Boston. 
according to Nader. 

"On more and more of the issues of structural power, the Democrats and Republicans are on the same page. And look at where they're on the same page. They're on the same page now on that notorious WTO/NA'FTA [World Trade

George Bush and Al Gore want more WTO, more NAFTA. They're on the same page in taking your of son money and their ties to ·business­es, Nader said the two major political parties have allowed the money of large corporations to fuel the democratic cam­paign process. 
"The civil society whose forebears brought us the social justice that we have in this country is being closed up by a company of political parties, whose prin­cipal interest is raising money in the same powerful corporate interests in order to re-elect them, so they can go to Congress and the White House and fol­low the marching orders of their corpo­rate paymasters," Nader said. 
"Now that is undermining our democ­ratic society in a very profound way. Corporations were designed years ago to be our servants; they have become our masters. That has to be changed, and it can be changed by a powerful, new Green Party movement,'' he said.

FACULTY SENATE 
Malloy links tight budget to ND growth 
By TIM LOGAN Senior Staff Writer 
Quality costs money, and Notre Dame will have to spend a lot of money if it wants to continue to provide a high quality education to its students, University President Father Edward Malloy told the Faculty Senate Wednesday. 
T h e "Generations" fundraising cam­paign topped the $1 billion mark last month, but Notre Dame's growth, much of which has been spurred by that campaign, is creating a financial crunch, according to Malloy. 
"We have a new reality at Notre Dame today," he said. "The University has grown in size, complexity and com­petitiveness." 
New buildings require more money for maintenance. Expanded academic programs need funding for research and classes. And, most significantly, increasing the size of the faculty neces­sitates a lot of spending. 
One of the goals of the "Generations" campaign is to hire 150 new profes­sors. The University is approaching that mark, and will continue to increase the faculty until it is reached. Administrators are also trying to keep Notre Dame in the game in an ever­escalating bidding war for top acade­mics. 
"If we are going to be a great univer­sity in the very best sense. then we need to be competitive for the very best faculty," Malloy said, but he acknmvl­edged that that would not be easy. "If we're going to be competitive, it's going to cost us a lot more money than in years past."

Smudging our identities 

As you may know. Wednesday was National Comin~ Out Day. For the past several years, studenl'> at Saint Mary's College have used this day as a cele­bration of diversity and to show their solidarity with thosn struggling with issues uf sexual identity. 
Various ways students choose to show their sup­port include rainbow ribbon distribution, the provision of Amanda Greco information concerning com­munity issues regarding Scene Editor homosexuality and the appearance of signs posted by student groups. 
Most ·ecognizable, though, are the chalk-written phrases adorning the sidewalks on Saint Mary's campus. 
Early Wedm~sday morning, a group of dC'dicated student, -homosoxual. bisexual, curious and straighl -sacriliced sleep and mid-term studying to show their support of human sexuality and their 'opposition to discrimination. The phrases appearing on the wncrete that morning ranged from "hate is not a family value," to "happy National Coming Out Day" to "support your brothers and sisters struggling with se:mal id1mtity." 
Thcs<· sayings were in no way intcnd<'d to advo­cate or prornole homosexuality. Hather, they were scrawlf'd in the same spirit a.<; sayings written during SMC Pride Week. 
I 
IlowE v1ff, they wen· not received in the same rngard. Throughout the day, students were seen chw,inp the phrases across the sidewalk, pouring watnr on them and smudging out the messages with their i'c,Jt. Belles were overheard making derogatory statements about homosexuality, and some students 1:elt ,L<;_,though the issues were being "shoved in their tacos. 
It is well known that not all students in the Notre Dame/2'.:ainl Mary's community arc Catholic.

religious affiliations. But, are we not also attending institut; ems that pride themselves on diversity and the acceptance and forgiveness implicit in their Catholk faith? Saint Mary's students should have pondcrnd this Wednesday when they stomped out other s1.udents' expressions of free speech and defiled the images of pride for all -pride that both campwrns are so greatly in need of. 
I lad Lhcse incidents occurred in relation to the cel­ebration or other groups attempting to express their unity--African Americans. Hispanics, Women's Hight.<; .1ctivists -surely. the discrimination would have bmm obvious and the disapproval resounding. 
Many people disagreed with the display of crosses covering the lawns on campus this past weekend. Yet, no one was so disrespectful as to remove the crosses to quiet the message they sent. Saint Mary's studcn:s would have been wise to exhibit such respect when viewing the letters that appeared on their sidewalks. 
Showing support'for a group does not automatical­ly imply inclusion in the group. I am Caucasian, but I whole-heartedly support minority heritage and pride. Many men pride themselves on being active fcminii:L<;. Showing respect for those honored on National Coming Out Day docs not require being homosexual. As one of the phrases on the sidewalk staled, "Be straight; be gay;just be." 
What is perhaps most disturbing about these events is how the same students who will fight so strongly to stop discrimination for other groups will so readily turn around and dismiss efforts that stand to honor everyone. Members of our community cling lightly lo their faith; but these acts belie all that ChristLmity upholds. If you are a Christian here on campus, please re-read the Ten Commandments. "Love 1hy neighbor" is not contingent on sexual ori­entation or any other sign of diversity. If you arc not Christi.cm, I should hope that you are human enough to not turn your uack on those in our community who srek your support and respect

TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY 
Petition fights bonfire restriction 
COLLEGE STATION, Texas 
Concerned that a hallowed tradition will turn into a hollow gesture, a group of students is circulating a peti­tion urging Texas A&M University administrators to reconsider the limitations placed on future Aggie Bonlires. The petition is protesting the elimination of "cut," limited student involvement and leadership in building Bonfire, and the two-year hiatus of the tradi­tion. According to parameters set by A&M President Dr. Ray Bowen, when Bonfire resumes in 2002, it will be built with precut lumber under the close supervision of a professional engineer. "In talking to other students, I found that most don't support an off-campus bonfire, but they don't support Bowen's restrictions either," said Becky Bartschmid, a petition organizer and sophomore journalism major. "But so far, the administration isn't listening, and the Student Senate hasn't really spoken for the students." The petition was initiated and already has 300 signatures, Bartschmid said. 
UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA 
Students desire Internet law classes 
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. 

In this age of cyber-communication, more law stu­dents are seeking classes in the growing field of Internet law. While some law schools have already cre­ated centers and special programs to accommodate stu­dents' increasing demands, the University of' Virginia only recently began to increase its number of Internet law classes. Law professor Daniel Ortiz said he has had to teach two sections of his Internet-related class for the first time this semester because demand was so high. "There were students who came to my office after they found out they couldn't get in," Ortiz said. Second­year law student Matt Branson said he was disappoint­ed not to get into Ortiz's class. "It seems like we're still in the process of figuring out what we're going to do," Branson said about the lack of Internet-related classes at the Law School. Professor Hobert O'Neil said he faces a similar problem each fall, when he offers his "Free Expression in Cyberspace" class: Too many students are applying for the limited number of slots.

SOARD OF GOVERNANCE 
Members cite alleged gay bias 
By AMY GREENE 
N,,ws Writer 
"Coming Out Day" and deface­ment of student displays head­lined the Board of Governance meeting on Wednesday. 
"Every year pPople across the nation and in colleges experi­ence 'Coming Out Day,"' said board member and feminist Collective representative Julie Frischkorn. 
Prischkorn discussed the unfairness that some students experience when students deface the signs or gay-themed paraphernalia they display. 
"I don't have a problem with people sharing their different viewpoints," said Frischkorn. "But at the same time it's unfair for students to discriminate by taking down and defacing signs. We do not need that on this campus." 
Frischkorn also said that the Feminist Collective has been discriminated against in the 
,t-pizza 
past. 
"When the Right to Life groups placed a cemetery in front of' McCandless no one spray painted or defaced those crosses," she said. 
In other BOG news: 
. A sister-dorm program between Saint Mary's and Notre Dame could be a new BOG pro­ject in the future. Juniors Asra Ashraf and Gina Caponi recently met with some Notre Dame women who wrote a letter to The Observer regarding the junior class T-shirt. 
"I felt threatened by the let­ter," said Ashraf about the T­shirt letter that caused friction between the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame student bodies. 
"We wound up meeting Sunday, ordered pizza, and talked for hours. We gave them a tour of campus and it was a really great experience for all of us," said Ashraf. 
"I think a social event with the women of Notre Dame and Saint

Mary's would really help to get rid of the stereotypes," she added. "We will be around each other for a very long time and the women of both schools should really get to know one another." 
Ashraf and Caponi proposed a sister-dorm program as a possi­b I e solution to reduce the stereotypes. 
"Overall we've had a positive experience with Notre Dame women, and ther,e are definite possibilities with the women there and here to start a pro­gram. In a sense, we are sis­ters,"' said Caponi. 
. ROG will be "walking around campus to address secu­rity issues on campus after fall break," said Crissie Renner, stu­dent body president. 
Students' concerns about security on campus have recent­ly increased, and BOG will work with security to address con­cerns.

"HPC is just another branch of student government. It acts as a representative of residence life," Stephan said. "[Its] mission is to carry out 
a  successful  and  
happy  stay  in  the  
dorm."  

Another important HPC function is to dis­perse student govern­ment-provided money to dorms. 
The council has a budget committee, consisting of the HPC treasure and several dorm presidents, which allots those funds, Stephan explained. 
However, dorms only receive funds after a formal appli­cation process, according to Rak. 
As a result, not every dorm gets exactly what it requests. The budget committee will some­times grant all or part pf the money request­ed, but in certain cases the committee will reject an applica­tion. 
A dorm has the option of going a for­mal review process if it is not pleased with the committee's deci­sion. 
In the interests of equity, HPC tries to balance the budget committee with mem­bers from each cam­p us quad and from both male and female dorms. 
The council also tries to avoid picking budget committee members whose dorms served on the committee in the pre· vious year, said Rak.

and the victim's experiences 
throughout the disciplinary 
hearing that ensued. 
'Tm excited that we've iden­
tified positive changes. We're 
trying to do more now," Kirk 
said. 
But Kori isn't so sure. 
While she said that any changes University policy undergoes to make sexual assault procedures more vic­tim-frieQclly arc "a step in the right direction," Kori admitted that the changes are a little less than she might have hoped for. 
"To be honest, I'm surprised that I've seen any changes in my time here. But the changes aren't ideal," she said. 
Calling for an advocate 
What concerns Kori most is that the proposed changes do not include the hiring of a full­time victim's advocate. 
The staff or faculty member who will eventually be hired as a resource person will not fill the role of an advocate, according to Kirk. Kirk said there are currently no plans to hire an advocate. Several uni­versities around the country employ advocates. 
Kirk said hiring an advocate would add an adversarial tone to disciplinary proceedings and the University might also feel obligated to provide an advocate for accused students. Last summer, representa­tives from the University Counseling Center made a for­mal proposal to the Office of Student Affairs. supporting the hiring of a pro­fessional advo­

procedures. In past years. some of the University's rul­ings in disciplinary hearings 
have been overturned by 
courts, but Kirk didn't confirm if the rulings involved cases of' 
alleged sexual assault. 
Heavy alco­hol consump­tion by both parties and familiarity with each other also complicates on-campus rapes, Kirk said. 
Moore said, in most cases, students in disciplinary hearings

Figures from campus Security/Pulice report one forcible rape in 1999 and two forcible rapes and a forcible fondling in 1998. 
Kori applauds other efforts at Notre Dame. 
"Nobody wants rape on this campus, but that's not going to happen. At least we're tak­ing small steps to address it," said Kori, who, since her rape, _has spoken at Freshman Orientation and in campus dorms and served as a peer advocate for others involved in disciplinary hearings. 
Implementing the changes 
Kori pointed to the change in du Lac as a positive step toward getting victims to come forward. In the past. many students may have feared punishment for underage drinking or parietal violations, she said. 
The new rules state students will not be disciplined for these offenses. 
change to du Lac has already taken effect, other changes will be gradually implemented 
throughout  the  semester,  
according to Kirk.  
One  of  two  proposed  

brochures underwent a limit­ed printing and is already in circulation, available in vari­ous offices around campus. It takes text directly from du Lac regarding support services available to victims of sexual assault. 
The other brochure will be for HesLife use and will restate disciplinary hearing procedures "more simply," Kirk said. It should be avail­able in January. 
/\lso in January, Kirk expects a resourcf' officer to be in place. Kirk said if need arises, he will look into the prospect of' making the role a full-time position. but that person would have duties sr,p­aratc from an advocate. 
Work on the proposed sexu­al ai-;sault committee is under­way. Kirk said several mem­bers have been selected for the committee, and an organi­zational meeting is tnntatively schcdulr.d for sometime after mid-semester break. 
"The committee won't serve as a legislative body," Kirk said. "But to the extent that they provide good suggestions. we'll implement them." 
That's encouraging news to Kori.

WORLD NEWS BRIEFS 
European kids impoverished: At least 50 million children in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union live in poverty and are exposed to levels of tuberculosis usually associ­ated with the Third World, a new report says. The report, titled "The Silent Crisis," was released Wednesday by the European Children's Trust, a non-governmental organiza­tion. Titled "The Silent Crisis," the report said poverty in the region has increased more than tenfold over the last decade. 
Israelis accept mediator: The United Nations often has been viewed in Israel as favor­ing the Arabs. However, Israel's acceptance of Secretary-General Kofi Annan as a Mideast mediator is evidence of a reccmt change in Israel's attitude to the world body. The traditional anti-Israeli voting pattern by the 
U.N. membership certainly hasn't disap­peared. 
NATIONAL NEWS BRIEFS 
House debates education: The addi­tion of 13 federal education programs and $10 billion in spending over the past four years have failed to improve students' reading and science scores, a House panel said Wednesday. GOP leaders said the report by a House sub­committee's Republican majority justifies the push for their education agenda: state freedom from federal spending rules, tax-free savings accounts for private and parochial schools, vouchers and expanded charter schools, and the conversion of $3 billion worth of programs into general grants. 
Judge orders Ford recall: A judge ­took the unprecedented step Wednesday of ordering the recall of as many as 1. 7 million Ford cars and trucks sold in California, accus­ing the automaker of concealing a dangerous design flaw that can cause the vehicles to stall in traffic. The ruling compounds Ford's troubles as the automaker tries to steer its way out of the Firestone tire recall crisis. Ford has insisted all along that the ignition module at issue is safe. and it said it will appeal the ruling.

Malloy said health benefit costs will rise 15 percent next year, and he noted that, for every professor it hires, Notre Dame must pro­vide research funding, library resources and other costs. 
"The single most expen­sive realit.y is the growth of faculty and staff," he said.

The endow­ment is now $3.5 billion, placing it among the nation's elite, and that has enabled the University to substantially increase finan­cial aid for both undergrad­uate and graduate students. The number of endowed prof'cssorships have also reached an all­
time high. 
week, Notre Dame celebrated the cre­ation of its 150th ()ndowed chair, and, according to Malloy, this growth has been a great \improvement for the University. 
"If you think abour our first [endowed chair] our 10th, 50th, 100th, and if you see who has either been attracted to the University, or promoted, I think you see the con­crete and tangible results in the peo­ple we can attract or promote," he said. 
Malloy gave a short talk to the facult.y and then answered a series of questions sub­mitted in advance before opening the floor for a brief question and answer session. 
Nader 
continued from page l 
Nader also mentioned the need for universal health care in America. 
"Herc's what some Western govern­ments achieved 30 and 40 years ago which we still have not achieved in this country. the richest country in the world," Nader said. "Universal health insurance coverage for all those people. They got it, we don't. With 46 million people and children without health insurance, 10 million more than when Gore and Clinton were elected in 1992, so much for universal health care step by step. Does that mean backwards or for­wards, N Gore? 
"Western Europe and Canada got coverage for their people; we didn't. Why? Because powerful economic forces now represented by the giant llMOs, hospital chains, drug compa­nies said no. They said no to our gov­ernment, and our government wasn't strong enough to tell them to back off. And so these giant corporations are holding America down on one of the most critical rights of any civilized society." 
By examining the minimum wage, Nader called into question the "so­called" prosperity that the U.S. is experiencing. 
"The minimum wage in 1968 when our country was half tho size that it is now in GDP [gross domestic product] per capita was in purchasing power equivalent to $7.30 an hour," he said. "Today, it's $5.15 an hour. The econ­omy has doubled. In any stable and strong democracy, the minimum· wage in purchasing power would be double what it was in 1968, not $2.15

less. Those are not living wages paid by giant corporations whose stock is skyrocketing and whose profits arc spiraling upwards." 
Nader noted the similarities between Gore and Bush on issues ranging from corporate welfare, for­eign policy, the death penalty, the WTO and helping the small farmer. 
"What is the difference between Al Gore and George W. Bush in the area of enforcement against corporate crime, fraud, abuse?" Nader asked. "[Do] Bush and Gore have anything to say about tougher corporate law enforcement? Do you ever hear them say Tm going to be tough on corpo­rate crime. I'm going to be tough on the crime in the suites'? No way. Those are the companies that are funding their elections." 
Nader criticized the two leading candidates for their stances on international relations. 
"I see no difference essentially between Gore and Bush on foreign policy," he added. "Our country will still support dictators and oligarchs cutting deals with big multi-national corporations and even 10 years after the end of the Soviet Union. When will our country support the workers and the peasants and the downtrodden of the third world for a change?" 
Ralph Nader was born in 1934 in Winsted, Conn. He is a magna cum laude graduate from Princeton University and a graduate of Harvard Law School. Ile gained national prominence in 1963 with his best­selling book, "Unsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-In Dangers of the American Automobile," which exposed the wrongdoing within General l\1otors and caused the entire automobile industry to make safer cars.

Stressing awareness for women 
During my two decades in law enforce­ment and security work, I have conduct­ed many classes on self-defense for women. Despite my sculpted body (hid­den underneath a more modest exterior) and my lightning reflexes (somewhat lessened by the rav­ages of time), most of these classes have featured the mental aspect of self defense. I leave the rough stuff to people like Officer Sue Tullos and her excellent team of Rape Aggression Defense (RAD) Instructors. (You can reach Sue at 1­
5555.) 

Here are my self­defense tips for women in the Notre Dame community: 
1. 
Don't drink when you are underage. There is no good reason to break this law. There is a reason the drinking age is 21. 

2. 
If you are old enough to drink, do so in moderation. Here are a couple of tests: Can you go to a bar or party and have only a soft drink, or nurse one drink? If you can't, you're not strong enough to resist peer pressure. For help, contact either the Alcohol and Drug Education program (1-7970) or the University Counseling Center (1-7336). 

3. 
If you are exploring the single's scene. go with a friend and leave with her. If you meet a really cool guy, he shouldn't mind swapping phone num­bers and making a date for another day. If he does mind, tell him to take a hike. This is a good test of his staying power. Here's another good test for potential boyfriends. See what he says when you say you prefer not to drink. If he pres­sures you ("Everybody drinks," "You'll have more fun," "It'll loosen you up," etc.), tell him you're sorry, but you've got to go study for orgo (I don't know what this is, but some of my student workers talk about it). Ifl told you that the guy you just met had poured a "date rape drug" into your Dr. Pepper, you would not drink it. but the same effect may occur when you pick up yet another beer. (They should put labels on beer cans -warning, drinking beer makes you stupid.) 

4. 
Don't ever get into a car with a dri­ver who has been drinking (unless you were born on Krypton). Ifyou don't believe me, give Rex Rakow a call (1­8338). He's the director of NDSP, but he's also conducted a number of vehicu­lar death investigations which have resulted from alcohol. Also, whenever you get in a car, make sure everyone is wearing a seatbelt {unless you have a death wish or own stock in a company which makes wheelchairs). 

5. 
Remember the country song which asked. "Why do the girls all get better lookin· at closing time." The reverse is also true. When you are not drinking, you have high standards in choosing 




your companions. Don't forfeit your rep­utation when you imbibe. 
6. 
Don't scoff at parietals -they are one of Notre Dame's many rules designed to help members of the com­munity. You too will be writing in defense of them, when your daughter enrolls here in the 2020s. While I realize that it is not chic these days to be writing about preserving virtue, remember a couple things. When you sleep with a man, you are sleeping with all of his sex partners. You are making a statement about your own worth every time you share intimacy with someone. 

7. 
"No" is a complete sentence. Read Gavin de Becker's book, "The Gift of Fear." Never let a boy or man force you to do something you choose not to. Yell like a banshee. We have an armed police department on campus. with lots of shiny handcuffs and four of the most capa­ble investigators in the county. We would be happy to beef up our arrest stats. Even if you're afraid that some ofyour own behaviors may have con­tributed to put you at risk, it is advisable to call immedi­ately for help when things don't work out the way you wished. Most sober people know this. 

8. 
Don't forget that we have a terrific SafeWalk Program. Call 1-5555 if you would like someone to walk with you on campus after dark. 


Thirty years ago, when I was involved in juvenile delinquency work, l served on the "Drug Abuse Task Force" for St. Joseph County. When I was asked to name the most serious drug, l answered "alcohol." In those days, it was not yet a big problem with kids aged 12-16 (my target group). but it was 
· a huge influence in the home life of those adults who posed as family for these kids (a teacher friend of mine describes these kids as being "raised by wolves"). Nothing l have seen in the past 30 years has changed my mind about the biggest social problem facing our society. 
I have done a lot of observational research (in taverns, pubs, the street5 of Los Angeles and in the Stadium's visiting team sections when a certain East Coast parochial school is in town) and come up with the definitive typology of what hap­pens when males drink. They become one of five people: Morpheus (named after the Greek god of dreams). This is sometimes the easiest drunk to deal with. He falls asleep by half-time and needs only to be carried back to his room after the game. He is only annoying when he is more than 300 pounds and incontinent ... or when his '64 Chevrolet rear-ends you on the 1967 Fourth of July weekend (but that's another story). Note: sometimes this guy is not asleep, he's pass·ed out and heading into a coma. Ifyou can't rouse this person, he's likely suffering from alcohol poisoning. Call 911 immediately. 
Or they become Johnny Carson (named after the funny comic, who was once arrested for drunk driving by one of my 
L.A. police pals). This guy is incredibly funny when he drinks. At least he and all his pals are laughing uproariously. Sometimes, though, you will see some people not laughing. Thosn are the ones not drinking. It reminds me of the '60s­era canard that people on LSD were capable of producing grnat art and music. You heard this a lot until someone actually gave an easel to an artist who was dropping acid. It was ugly. 
Or they become Casanova (named after the 18th century Italian "adventurer"). This guy becomes amorous. Unfortunately, one guy's amorousness may be a woman's sexual battery com­plaint. 
Also, they may bccome Marciano (named after the only undefeated heavyweight champion in history). This guy becomes belligerent. Ile can be divided into two sub­groups: The Chuck Wepner­
type. named after the Bayonne Bleeder and identi­fied by the facial stitching. 
Or they become the Mike Tyson-type who also thinks he's Casanova. This is the 
guy domestic violence vic­tims describe as "real nice when he's not drinking." One victim told me. "When he puts his arms around me, l just melt," but she 
had to tell me this while standing, because the most recent time he had put his 
arms around her, it was to throw her down the base­ment steps. Her broken hip had not yet healed. When this guy goes to college, he becomes part of the shadow 

statistics of acquaintance assault. He's the boy written up in some Observer articles during the past year. He would never grab a stranger on a deserted path and pull her into the bushes and assault her. No way. He believes "rape is wrong", but when he's pounded down a bunch of brewski's with the blonde first­
. year student who's slouched on the next bar stool, he is all too quick to respond to the opportunities of the moment. 
I'm not familiar with all the ways women are affected when they drink, but a lot of young women acquire one harm­ful trait. They become forgetful. They forget all the things their parents taught. them. Beer not only makes you stupid, it also makes you forget things. Rape is wrong; acquaintance rape is pre­ventable. 
Cappy Gagnon. '66, has seen too many Notre Dame students embarrass them­selves in the stadium because they were drinking beer instead ofhot chocolate. His two daughters heeded his advice and grew up and married without ever being crime statistics.

POLITICAL FACE-OFF 
Putting the health of America first 
Prioritizing the needy 
American health care is the best in the world. The only problem is getting it. People with enough money or a generous employer are provided with access lo some of the most advanced medical technology ori earth. Unfortunately. more than a sixth of all 
Jeffrey Americans have no Stuffings health care coverage at all Roughly 44 million 
College

people are without 
Democrats

insurance. 
The lack of affordable health insurance in America hits children and minorities the hardest. Eleven million children and more than a third of llispanics have no health insurance. Ordinary families suffer as well. Medical bills from a common illness can bankrupt a middle-class family without cover­age. 
Vice President Gore has proposed extending tax credits to employers who provide health insurance to their employees. He has also proposed expanding the State-Children's Insurance Program in order to provide uni­versal health coverage for children. George 
W. Bush, who governs a state with one of the worst public health records in the nation, wishes to rely upon health care companies to oITer private plans. The bottom line is that poor and middle income families will continue to have little hope of becoming insured. 
The Vice President's plan will actually drive down health care costs. People without cover­age are forced to seek emergency treatment at the last minute. Emergency care is incredi­bly expensive. Providing preventive care and early treatment under a health plan is much more sensible. 
The ever-increasing number of uninsured Americans is not the only health care prob­lem facing the U.S. today. Currently. the price of prescription drugs is spiraling out of con­trol. In 1999, the prescription drug bill for Americans was $112 billion, and the overall cost of prescription drugs is growing at a rate oflO percent a year. The group of Americans hurt most by the prescription drug hike over the past ten years is elderly. 
Most elderly have some form of private insurance that pays for their prescription drugs. However, as drug costs have risen. pri­vate insurers have been more and more unwilling to pick up the tab. Worse yet are the third of elderly Americans that have no prescription drug coverage at all. With drug costs totaling several hundred dollars a month. many elderly have seen their dispos­able incomes plummet. They must frequently choose between fiUing their prescriptions or buying food to eat. Often. prescriptions go unfilled and the health of elderly Americans suffers. 
Vice President Gore has proposed using our nation's economic prosperity to help elderly Americans meet th~ rising cost of drugs. He has proposed spending $253 billion of the fed­eral budget surplus over the next ten years on a comprehensive prescription drug benefit program for Medicare recipients. The pre­scription drug benefit would be administered through the existing Medicare system, which would continue to provide traditional cover­age as well. 
Governor Bush. on the other hand. has pro­posed that prescription drug benefits be administered directly through private insur­ers. What the Bush plan does is leave the elderly at the mercy of the private insurance markl'L The Bush campaign has tried to sug­gest that bureaucra1s or "rats" will decide who receivfls drug benefits under the Gore plan. 
Under the Bush plan benefits will be administered by exec­utives worried about their share prices on Wall Street. There is definitely a degree of uncertainty in Governor Bush's plan. Not only will prescription drug benefits be less gen­erous under a Bush administration, but seniors cannot take comfort in knowing they will receive help paying their skyrocketing drug costs. 
There is simply a difference in priori­ties between Vice President Gore and Governor Bush. The Vice President JIVLkes a priority of using our nation's prosperity to solve some of the most pressing social problems in America. He wants to use the surplus to promote universal health care and improve the health of our nation's seniors. Governor Bush makes a pri­ority of letting market forces solve our nation's problems. He doesn't seem to believe that the government should provide help to those who are unable to help themselves. The prosperity over the last eight years has given the U.S. the special opportunity to improve the lives of the most needy Americans. We must not let this opportunity slip away. 
Jeffrey Stuffings is the president ofthe · College Democrats Club. Political Face-Off will run every Thursday until the election.

Bush proposes a plan that works 
The lies and sighs of the Gore campaign have carried over to the issue of health care. Once again, Gore has decided to lie about the details of Governor Bush's plans instead of debating the 
Greg Kelly
substantive dif­ferences between the 
College
plans. This 
Republicans
article will not throw out mag­ical, very convenient numbers. tar­geted at tricking the uneducated. but instead it will relay the facts of Governor ~ Bush's plan and let you decide whether or o:-. not to sup-
jport it. 
· Governor Bush real­,~ izes that 
~ biparti­san pro­posals have made 
great strides towards 
solving our national health care crisis. The basis of this proposal is essentially giving every Am.erican citi­zen the same health coverage that govern­ment workers get. which 
includes choice from a wide range of comprehensive plans that will meet all health care needs. 
The first key in this is not penaliz­ing people who are currently happy with their health care. Anyone who does not want to change his or her current coverage will not be forced to. At the same time. flexibility will be introduced to allow people to change their coverage at the end of the year if they are not happy with the services. 
Governor Bush does not believe that impoverished seniors should have to pay anything for their cov­erage. Any seniors at 35 percent of the poverty level or less will have their health coverage and prescrip~ tion plan fully covered by the gov­ernment. Seniors between 35 per­cent and 75 percent of the poverty level will have partial help in their prescription drug plan. All seniors will have a minimum of 25 percent of the prescription drug premium paid for by the government and the government will cover any cata­strophic expense (over $6,000) for all seniors. 
Governor Bush does not believe people should have to wait for the government to raise funds to reap the benefits of this legislation. The Governor's "Helping-Hand" legisla­tion would give $48 billion of direct support to states for four years to make these programs go into effect immediately. By the time these funds are exhausted. the funding that the legislation will have raised will be sufficient to start sustaining the benefits. 
Vice President Gore's plan does not give extra benefits to impover­ished seniors. He also does not want to reform the system in the same detail that Governor Bush does. Instead, he wants to make the exist­ing system cheaper. This does not address the problem of the inade­quate care that currently plagues the country. Once again, Al Gore has decided to say what sounds best instead of suggest true reform. Mr. Gore has a plan to get elected. not to improve healthcare. 
Governor George W. Bush has a plan to work with a Republican or Democratic congress to make healthcare reform a reality. He realizes that issues of the welfare of American citizens should be above the petty bickering of partisan lines and should not be exploited as a political tool. Electing George W. Bush will ensure not only health­care reform, but also restoring the motel at 1600 to the mansion at 1600.

Hichardson is the brother's widow and Cumming is a twerpy sollware mil­lionaire who blunders into a crooked business relationship with the movie's maximum-bad malefactors -underage pornographers who doped and exploited 
Carter's niece (Hachel Leigh Cook, "She's 
All That"). They're lead by Mickey 
Rourke ("Angel Heart"). who matches 
Stallone stone-cold stare for stone-cold 
stare. Overall, the cast does a good job. 
And, although Carter's appetite for vengeance and his efforts to achieve per­sonal redemption are only moderately believable, the film does exhibit a handful of suspenseful moments. 
Thanks to its stylishness and dynamism, "Get Carter" also manages to grab the audience for most of its running time (a killer "French Connection"-style car chase ups the ante_by taking place on Seattle's slippery-when-wet avenues.) 
One could easily accuse Kay of using directorial nash to service a weak story, and that's probably true, but if the flash helps evoke the mood and energy of the characters. what's wrong with a little overkill'! These characters are violent and over-the-top. ll only makes sense that the look of the film follows in suit. 
The poorly-scripted story takes its toll on the viewer, though, by film's end. There aro long scenes that plod on forev­er and short scenes that stand as point­less. 
Also, instead or bringing Carter's revenge to a crescendo, the climactic showdowns <lel1atc all the tension from the film. Ile goes on the rampage, people get kill1d, and the audience stops caring. 
If one thinks about it, "Got Carter" lias all the ingredients of a dumb Hollywood movie: a washed-up action star, a weak storyline and a crop of stereotypical action characters. 
Yet, thanks to some 11ashy directing, quality performances and a l'air sharn of quality action scenes, the !ilm succeeds in at least maintaining our attention. In that sense, "Get Carter" isn't half as bad a.s it could have been.

Thero was so much promise for "Meet the Parents," a comedy directed by Jay Hoach ("Austin Powers" 1 & 2) and starring Hubert IJeNiro as a watchful parent and Ben StHler as a timid boyfriend. The promise never pays off. The movie feels much longer than its 108-minute running time. 
The premise is simple. Stiller plays Greg Fucker, a guy who wishes lo get mar­ried to his longtime girffriend, Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo, a TV character actress). !loping to make the right moves, Greg suggests a weekend with Pam's parents. At the end of the weekend, Greg plans to propose, having securnd the parent's approval. 
This is a comedy, however. and everything goes wrong for Focker. lie accidentally destroys almost everything in and around the house. Suffice to say, the meeting with the parents is a disaster. However, as things in movies always tend to do, every mis­
understanding works itself out and the happy couple is united for a limitless future. 
The main problem with this movie is that it peaks too early. When Stiller destroys a precious urn containing the ashes or DcNiro's beloved mother, the audiencn roars with laughter and gasps. Everyone feels compassion and humor for the situation Greg is in: he has just per­formed the grnatnst injustice to tlrn Byrnes family (and unintentionally at that). 
Ilowever, the accidents become increasingly ridicu­lous as the movi11 progresses. Destroying an urn is one thing, but is Greg so unlucky that, in the same weekend, he would destroy a front lawn with a single f'lush of' thn toi­let? llis bad luck culminatns in a situation with a cat, a cigarette, leaves, a gutter, an electrical wire and a hand­crafted wedding altar. This is not bad luck on Greg's part: this house is a liability wait­ing to be burned to the ground. 
Greg is the starting domino in a series of chance events. llis bad luck becomes absurd

Allen comments on life and love in 'Manhattan' 
By JUDE SEYMOUR 
Scene Movie Critic 

Woody Allen is often associated with his short, witty comedies. It was a romantic com­edy, "Annie Hall" that won him a Best Picture Oscar in 1977. "Manhattan" was his follow up, and a lot was expected of it. It is a bril­liant film, and the late 1970s mark the most fruitful period of Allen's writing and direct­ing. 
"Manhattan" plays out on two levels. The first is Allen's perpetual love song to Manhattan. Backed by amazing George Gershwiri selections, the film is

"puppy love" that is common of a teenager. Isaac tries to keep the relationship casual, but Tracy is falling in love with him. Clueless of the needs of a teenager, he responds the only way he knows how: he admonishes her for everything. He is also careful in his lan­guage: she is not "beautiful," but "adorable." Tracy is constantly reminded that she "can't be in love. [She's] just a kid". 
Allen also comments on the way the era {the 1970s) is addressing sex. For example, a group discussion at a dinner party quickly turns to the subject of orgasms. At one point, Mary quips to Yale, "It's always sex with you. There's never any time for holding/' Clearly, 
Allen has written that piece of 
have been treated to scenes capturing the rising and setting of the sun, but the city is in perpetual motion, much like the song that has been associated with the beginning and end of the film. 
In between, the audience is treated to other, less familiar Gershwin selections that set appropriate moods and coordinate with an abundance of visuals of the beloved Manhattan. There are no scenes outside Manhattan. As a character explains early, liv­ing outside this town is "just not practical." 
The second level the movie presents is Allen's commentary on life, focusing on the casual nature of relationships and sex within the city. Allen plays Isaac Davis, a 42-year­old TV writer. At the film's opening, he is "dating" 17-year-old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway, who was 17 in real life). His friend, Yale (Michael Murphy), is unhappily married to Emily (Anne Byrne), and looks to a pseudo-intellectual Mary {Diane Keaton). for a fling. 
The movie is about how each of these peo­ple hop from relationship to relationship to satisfy an understanding of their own life's purpose. Yale looks to justify his infidelity, but Isaac will not consent. Although the two are friends, they are miles apart on what they should be getting out of their relationships. 
For Yale, he enjoys the sex and danger of being Gaught when he is ~vith Mary. For Isaac, it is about recovering from a messy marriage -his inadequacies arc soon going to be part of a "tell-all" book written by his 
-now lesbian ex-wife (played by Meryl Strecp). Isaac dates Tracy because it is his security blanket; Tracy adorns him with a form of 
can't be hung up on Issac. He points out that he can "beat up her father." Mary is an emotional mess. Played as a sex object in her relationship with Yale, she is a polar opposite to Isaac. Nevertheless, they click for a while. Gershwin hums in the back as a classic shot of Isaac and Mary, on a bench overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge, is put up on screen. 
Mary leaves Isaac when she admits she still loves Yale. Disturbed by the morals he sees amongst his friends, Isaac takes off to find Tracy, whom he finally realizes has been part of his most satisfying relationship. 
A fast, striking Gershwin piece plays as Isaac races to find Tracy before she leaves for London, The final scene is classic Allen: well scripted and a strong ending to the film. 
While it would be discourteous to reveal the outcome of the story, it is relevant to point out that, regardless or how it turns out, Isaac has learned that Tracy is much more mature than he had given her credit for. Whereas his attitude towards her at the beginning or the film might have been that he had nothing to learn from her, the truth lies in the fact that even a old man can fall in love with a charm­ing teenager. 
"Manhattan" is a delightful love story set to a fantastic Gershwin score. In a carefully mastered script, the characters exchange quips about morality, sex, relationships and true love. 'Allen's classic one-liners are thrown into the mix and the story is satisfying and humorous. 
While "Annie Hall" may have captured the awards, it is "Manhattan" that oftentimes steals the show.

Sing for me 
by Steve Warner 
It was the first day of Senior week, May 14, 2000. Mother's Day. May in all her glory was enveloping Our Lady's campus. On that brilliant day of sun and new-formed flowers, thirty­six members of the Notre Dame Folk Choir made their way to the Maximum Security Prison in Michigan City, Indiana. 
The prison is on rhe edge of nowhere. Pase the city, hardly marked, hang a right-hand turn off US 20, keep your eye on the grotesque cooling tower ofthe energy plant which frowns down on the barbed wire and guards and pathetic brick structures that make up the destitution and despair of the Level Four incarceration unit. And here we are, on Mother's Day. 
It is the Choir's third trip to the prison. Each time, more and more inmates have shown up for our concert. On this day, almost six hundred of the offenders are here. The Catholic community of the prison -some of them just newly baptized -are proud as can be. We are "their choir;" -they are our hosts. For forty-five minutes before our concert, we mingle with the men of the prison. Jovial conversations, timid at first, but always with a sense ofhospitality and gratitude on their part. 
We sing our songs. One hour of music. A dedication to the men on death row (they are not allowed to attend the concert, as they are in permanent lock-down; however, they can view it on dosed-circuit tv). Some lively gospel songs, bringing the men to their feet. Always, a shouted admonition to "take your time!" AB we sing, there are tears. There are closed eyes .. Offenders gently rock back and forth. Many are there with Bibles clasped close to their hearts. 
And at the end of the hour, a long, joyful, standing ovation. The men know that we are not here for some isolated do-good venture. This is our third trip. We know some of these guys by name, or by their faces. Some, even their stories. Over the last few years, a bit ofadoption has 

taken place ... we pray for these men through the year. We remember them during the Lenten season. And we journey to sing for them, to ler them know that they are not forgotten and that they still have dignity, and that God forgives them their errors in this world -even when many of the voices in this world cannot. 
There is a cenain relief when we leave. The process of being searched, passing through four sets of iron bars, the dynamic of presenting music to such a need­ful group of human beings, and leaving again so quickly... this leaves a mark on the soul. We exit the dingy-green corridors ofsecurity, and then, suddenly, the May sunshine, now moving toward sunset, sur­rounds us again. So amazingly easy that we can walk around those bars, all those armed guards, and pass easily through the gates. 
There is silence around the choir, and a natural need to huddle. Across the street from the prison is a 
small picnic table. We gather there, to regroup, to pray for a moment for the men locked inside. Fr. Joe Ross, then the chaplain for the prison, points to the right side of the complex. "Death row," he says. We gaze at the brick stockade, which seems to radiate fear and loneliness. 
Sing for me! 

It is a voice pleading from deep inside death row. He is shouting to us, across the chasm that separates the free from the imprisoned. Sing for me! he cries. And his voice is like one who cries from the pits ofhell. Sing for me! 
And so we begin. Hallelujah, my Father, for giving us your Son.... Our voices leap across that chasm. Past the barbed wire, past the guards, past the bars. Sending him into the world to be given up for us .... We give up our voices, the song leaps from cell to cell, slips past the bars and the gates. We can see figures gathering at windows, though we cannot see faces. 
God bless you! the voice cries, on behalf ofhis brethren. And our song is raised all the louder, penetrating the Mile that few have walked. But musicians can reach out to the Mile, if their song is strong and true enough. 
Knowing we would bruise him, and smite him from the earth .... 
And we blink back our tears as we look down upon our Birkenstocks and our designer jeans. 
· Please! Sing just one more! So the voice cries again, and we obey. We are marching, we sing, we are marching in the light ofGod. And the sun spreads itself about us, and the song penetrates the prison one more time. 
Pray for us! He cries. And we shout back "We will!" And we do. 
Now, we know. We know why visiting the imprisoned is a "corporal work of mercy." "Corporal," or having to do with the flesh -we know, because without even seeing the man, we saw the face of Christ enfleshed in his words. We know, because we experienced the Word of God that could not be locked up: bars and guards and all the devices of human imprisonment could not hold back our simple song of hope. · 
De profundis clamavi ad te Domine: "Out of the depths I cry to you, 0 Lord." Never again will Psalm 130 mean the same thing. For we have heard a voice that came from those 
..

depths. And we have tasted what it means to minister to that Voice.

Though he's considered an excellent players' manager and a respected administra­tor, Baker has just one post­season victory in eight sea­sons with the Giants.

high school player in Texas, he earned scores of awards and honors: selection as a USA Today first-team All-America defensive back, Parade prep AllAmerican and a ranking of sixth nationally on listings of the top 100 national prospects by ESPN.com and The Sporting News. When people compared those accolades with an image of Sapp riding the bench, some began to question his talent. 
Ile wasn't one of those doubters. 
"I knew I'd have to work for it," Sapp said. "The guys who were in front of me. Deke Cooper and A'Jani Sanders, ended up teaching me. By me not playing last year, I actually gained more knowledge watching those guys. [Not playing] didn't really bother me, because I knew that when my tinie came, I would be ready." 
Now Sapp backs up senior Ron Israel at strong safety, usually playing a limited amount on defense. Although he'd be thrilled to become a starter. Sapp understands he has to bide his time. 
"[rree safety! Tony Driver and Ron Israel are great guys," Sapp said. "When I get in, they're happy for me. When they're in, I'm happy for

If Sapp does move into the national spotlight, an NFL career might not be out of the question. But that's not first and foremost in his mind. 
Sapp came to Notre Dame in large part for the chance to be more than an athlete, to be a student­athlete. 
''We're all students, too, student ath­letes," Sapp said. "At 
other schools, you get just the athletics. You don't get the mix. They really stressed that as recruiters. You're going to take classes like other stu­dents. You're going to be like other students, to live and eat with other students. I know I actually enjoy thal."

St. Ed's player and coach Judson Penton was frustrated with his team's performance. 
"We blew a lot of chances and left a lot of guys on the bases," Penton said. "We also suffered some tough calls on the bases. I think that talent­wise, we're probably the stronger team, and maybe on

The Belles volleyball team bat­tled againsl tbc Kalamazoo College Hornets Wednesday, dropping the match in three games. The game leaves Saint Mary's struggling at 2-8. 
They lost to the 6-4 Hornets 15-4, 15-13, 15-5 
"Kalamazoo had a lot of depth, especially offensively," coach Julie Schroeder-Bick said. "We did not block at all." 
The Hornets proved to be tough competition two weeks ago when they played at Saint Mary's. They won in a four game series of 15-7, 7-15, 15-7. While the Belles have improved over the season, so have the Hornets. 
··we were flat against Kalamazoo in the first and third games," Schroeder-Biek said. "The second game was much better. We served well." 
Denise Langolis and Jamie Dineen each served two aces. 
Communication was a prob­lem for the Belles, said outside hitter Angie Meyers. 
" We have our good games where we cannot stop talking on the court," said Meyers. "Then

Safety Sapp plays many different roles for Irish 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 
As,ociJrc Spum Ediror 
Sophomore strong safpty Gerome Sapp is content stretching like Silly Pully into any position the Irish need him to play. 
'Tm kind of like a rubber band man," Sapp said. "l do whatever they ask me to." 
So far, one of his biggest roles has been on sp1\cial teams, where the Irish rely on Sapp to chase down opposing players on kickoff and punt returns. 
"I play a major factor in special teams," Sapp said. "As of right now, I'm leading the. team in special teams points." 
/\s a freshman, Sapp made 164 special teams appearances. llc's maintained his playing time on special teams this year a.s Notre Dame's special teams unit has become the program's l'orte. 
"Our roaches are rnally preparing us for what we have to do, so we'll be ready for any­thing that they [opposing teams! can possibly think of to come at us," he said. 
While he enjoys special teams since it allows him to help the team, defense is his preferred position. 
"I like defense better," Sapp said. "In high school, I felt like I was part of the defense, and at any minute, I could play a part in the game. Special teams offers the same things, but defense I love." 
Last year. Sapp saw action in the secondary against Kansas, Michigan State, Oklahoma and Stanford. Against Michigan State, he came through with a pass interception, and in the game with Stanford, he made what he consid­ers his best play to date. 
"In the Stanford game last year, on a punt I ran down Troy Walters, the guy that broke all the PAC-10 records, from behind and tackled him." Sapp said. "The camera was zoomed in on me. and my mom saw it and called me when I got back. That's probably one of my highlights." 
Most of the time, though, he found himself watching then-seniors A'Jani Sanders and Oekc Cooper. 
That came as a big adj1stment for Sapp. As a
