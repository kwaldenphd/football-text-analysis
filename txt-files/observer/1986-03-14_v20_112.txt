Prostitutes focus press on Brown 
sity relations. "We're talking about people's lives and reputations and the reputation of Brown." 
Reichley said he and other Brown officials were "very angry" at what the university considers "undue and unfair and unwarranted emphasis on Brown" by the media and Providence police. 
Two Brown seniors were arrested last week on prostitution charges, and Providence police said Wednes­day that photos of eight other former or current Brown women were among the photos of 46 women seized from a home that has become a focal point in the inves· tigation. 
Reichley said it was unfair to focus on the Brown women because they represent a minority of those allgedly involved. He also said there were only six other Brown students identified in the photos, not eight as police said. 
The Investigation has focused on a converted carriage house in a fas. hionable section of Providence near the campus. Police raided the con­dominium last Friday and found more than 100 photos of the 46 women in "various stages of undress." The owner of the home has not been charged.

Senate candidates unveil priorities, objectives when elected 

By BUD LUEPKE 
SIII/Ireporter 
Tbis ts tbe first of two articles concerning next week's Student Senate election. Today's article focuses on candidates from dis­tricts 1 and 2; Monday's edition willfeature senate opponentsfrom districts 3, 4 and5. 
Communication and action is the battle cry ofStudent Senate hopefuls as candidates gear up their cam­paigns for Tuesday's elections. 
Candidates running for senate posts in districts 1 and 2 said they wanted to increase communication with students and get more ac­complished through the senate. Most candidates also said they have confidence that the newly elected Switek-Montanaro administration will do the job well.

became co-ed this semester, accord­
ing to Loux. "If they felt it had 
worked in the first dorm, I did not 
see a problem in having a second 
(co-ed) dorm provided they were 
separated by floor." 
Another concern in the discus­
sion of whether or not to mix 
housing for the second dorm in the 
spring semester was making a 
unified student residence policy, ac­
cording to Loux. "That way you 
could forstall complaints that the 
people in the two dorms were being 
treated differently. The residence 
staff desired a consistent housing 
policy for all students of the 
program," he said. 
"Surely it isn't the situation that 
exists on campus," said Loux. "I 
think special circumstances justify 
co-ed dorms. (London is) a totally 
different kind of situation. They go 
to plays In the evening and have 
evening classes. It's a completely dif­
ferent kind ofcontext. 
"You can't extrapolate the policy 
there to campus," he added.

Brian Holst, who is running for district 1 senator, said communica­tion with students is his priority. "Few students know who their senator is," he said. Holst, a sop­homore from Holy Cross, said if elected he will propose a Senate Ad­visory Council in which each senator will meet with an appointed representative from each of the dorms in that district. 
Holst said that while he believes the senate structure has its flaws, he will try to work within the system. However, he said, "I want to define the role of student government, make it more efficient." 
Holst has served as a parliamen­tarian ofthe Student Life Council the last two years and was chairman of the Committee for Restructuring the Senate. 
Pat Kiernan, a freshman from Holy Cross, opposes Holst for the disrict 1

post. Kiernan said he wants to change the alcohol policy, which, he says, "was made without much thought." Kiernan said he wouldHke to see more alcohol-related events on campus. "Alcohol is a major part ofstudent life," he said. 
Kiernan said he wants to reduce penalties for parietals violations and streamline the senate. "We need to re-define the role of the Hall Presi­dents' Council," he said. Kiernan said the senate should have more power in campus-wide representa­tion, while the HPC should be confined to dorm representation. 
Kiernan said Switek should be "fun for a change" and that his ad­ministration would do "just as well as Domagalski and Dink."

administration in student affairs. Gardiner said the unity gained by an improved social life could be used to overcome a "too restrictive" admin­istration. 
Gardiner also stressed communi­cation with students in his district and said that student government can work "the way it is if we stop trying to change it and get someth­ing done." 
Gardiner, who described himself as a "lunch pail candidate," said he offers no promises but will "work his tail oft:" 
Tom Vasti contests Gardiner and slates senate improvement as his primary goal if elected. Vasti, a sop­homore from Cavanaugh, said he wants to remove "special interests groups" such as the treasurer, the Student Activities Board andjudicial Board, from the senate. Also on Vasti's platform are a proposal for a Budget Committee and a more

Ferrick said that when the hall staff suggested both dorms may go co-ed in the spring semester, there was concern among the students that two separate groups would form."The dorms are two blocks apart," said Ferrick, "but the group 
representative senate with better communication. "Five senators really don't get in touch with dorms," he said. 
Vasti said the Switek election represents a "new wave ofa positive feeling and more interest in student government. We were lucky in get­ting these two." 
Rounding out district 2 is Pete Witty, also a sophomore from Cavanaugh. Witty also said he wants to improve communication bet­ween students and government by more representation. Witty said a big problem on campus is the "negative attitude" between stu­dents and·the administration, and he would work to improve student relations with the administration. 
"As a senator, my job is to represent the students in my dis­trict. I will do this by com­municationg the ideas of the people I represent," he said. 
always socialized together. The guys always had to walk over." 
Ferrick said no problems oc­curred among the group members because of the co-ed sitaution. "I don't think much more would have gone on than would in a single dorm." 

Last semester, a rectress lived on the lower floor of the West Two Hotel with the men, according to Tom Szromba, who just returned from London. Szromba lived in the other residence, the Princess Square Hotel. Szromba said all the women of the group were housed in the West Two. Fred Nelson, who also lived in Princess Square, said the West Two was a little more uptight than his dorm. "Ours was more laid­back." 
Mike Ferrick lived in the West Two last semester. He said, "Parietals were pretty much non­existent for everybody, even the guys in the other dorm. Guys stayed over in girls' rooms, and girls stayed in guys' rooms." 
Ferrick said he thinks everybody was pleased with the situation. "I don't know anyone who was dis­satisfied. Everybody was pretty positive. 
"The guys who didn't get into the co-ed dorm were pretty (upset) at first. Later they said it was no big deal, they found out they could stay over (at the women's dorm)

Paddy wagon to allow drinking, not driving

News.Staff 
On Monday Notre Dame and Saint Mary's will celebrate the first on­campus St. Patrick's Day in I 0 years. Saint Mary's student government has a plan to ensure that the celebration is a safe one for partying students. 
The student government Is spon­soring a "paddy wagon" which wlll transport students from the bars and off-campus parties back to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
Jeanne Heller, Saint Mary's stu­dent body president-elect, originated the idea of the paddy wagon, and she Is in charge of the program along with Kathleen Juckniess, the Notre Dame/Saint .Mary's Hall Presidents' Council Representative. 
Said Juckniess, "The Saint Mary's student government realizes there could be a problem (with drinking and driving)," and so It Is taking steps to minimize the problem. 
According to Jucknless, the Idea of transportation from bars and parties on St. Patrick's Day was presented. to the Saint Mary's Programming Board by Heller, and It was very well received. It was then approved by the student govern­ment advisors, and the plan was set In motion. It Is strictly a student-run project,Jucknless added. 
The paddy wagon Is free of charge, and only a Notre Dame or Saint Mary's ID is needed to ride, Juckniess said. The wagon wlll ac­tually be a bus provided by J & E Transit, which also will provide the driver. She said the hours of opera­tion will be from 8 p.m. until 2 a.m., with the bus leaving every half-hour from LeMans Hall at Saint Mary's.

This is the first in a series of two articles dealing with the Notre Dame class and off-campus elec­tions to be held next week. Today's articlefocuses onjuniorandsenior class tickets and off-campus can­didates. In Monday's edition sop­homore class tickets will be highlighted. 
Sensing students' desire for fun in student government from the stu­dent body president race results, class office and off-campus commis­sioner candidates are stressing so­cial events in their campaign plans. 
The senior class office ticket of Mark Foley, Kevin Daly, Meg McGlinn and Mike O'Grady, listed in the order of president, vice­president, secretary and treasurer, plans to make a difference on the campus social scene, according to Foley. 
"I would like to encourage all seniors to put on their drinking Elizabeth Kennedy and Thomas Hudak, also listed in the same order as above, plans to build on its past experience with new enthusiasm and ideas, said Nonnenkamp.

didate Mark Peabody cited consis­tency as his major goal if elected. "I'll be consistent the whole year and keep trying for more money and keep trying for more events," he said. 
"The focus should be on the events for off-campus people," said Peabody. 
Candidate Steve Taeyaerts said he considers one person inadequate for the off-campus commissioner posi­tion. "Why shouldn't off-campus stu­dents have the same representation as those on campus?" he asked. 
He said Mary Kay Steinmetz, Mark Conces, and Kate Mullaney will share the responsibilities of the office ifelected.

Fight for justice at ND ends in short term solution 
Who says there's no justice in the world? 
My grueling parking ticket saga mercifully ended Wednesday and I'm now the proud owner of I 0 bucks I had already written olfas spent. And just in time to place a long-shot bet on Notre Dame to win the NCAA tournament, I might add. 
MikeWUkins here, there and back 
To refresh your memories, about three weeks ago I was given a parking ticket for parking in the pay lot behind the Center for Continuing Education. I had paid my 75 cents to park in this lot but received a ticket anyway. Angered by this obvious injustice, I awarded my annual Pest of the Year Award to Notre Dame Security for giving me a ticket for parking in a lot I had actually paid money to park in. This was no small matter, either, con­sidering that Security had to beat out Mike Bobinski, developer ofour wonderful basket­ball ticket-distribution system. 
Since no one from Security was moved enough by the award I had bestowed on them to tear up my ticket and call things even, I had to go through the appeal process if I wanted to see justice done. I started byfilling out a writ­ten appeal form in which I outlined the reasons why I thought the ticket was unfair. 
Apparently my appeal for justice fell ondeaf ears (or blind eyes, as the case may be) be­cause about a week after I filed my appeal I got 
Phelps deserves credit for his coaching efforts 
DearEditor: 

In response to the Bob Fitzgerald-Paul Kotecki sophomorish armchair-coach column of March 12. Gentlemen, before you foam at the mouth about your self-proclaimed knowledge of college basketball, let me first quote a columnfound in a Chicago newspaper the same day I read your half-page insult to college ball. "North Carolina and Duke are both probably 15 points better (than Notre Dame), and both games were wire jobs." "Digger Phelps makes veryfew mistakes in the white-knuckle period ofa game." (That means the end of the game, guys.) " ... there's no doubt he's an outstanding bench coach." These comments came from Al McGuire. I'm sorry Fitzgerald and Kalecki, in case you might not know, he's considered to be one of the best coaches and most knowledgeable men the game has ever seen. I think he used to coach Marquette. Correct me ifI'm wrong. 
By the way, did anyone ever tell you that 
Doonesbury 

a letter telling me it had been denied. Thatwas about all the letter told me,too. No mention was made ofwhy I lost the appeal or ofthe fact that I had the right to make an oral appeal. All the letter said was that I lost the appeal and that if I didn't pay the -ticket, it would be charged to my student account. Luckily, in snooping around for material for my earlier column, I found out that I could make an oral appeal ifI lost the written appeal. I don't know if everyone learns this when they first file an appeal, but I certainly couldn't tell just by reading the response to my written appeal. 
Anyway, I scheduled an oral appeal and showed up in the Administration Building to pave the way for justice to be done. But fight­ing for justice isn't all it's cracked up to be. I had to wait in the hallway outside the room where the appeals were being heard while ot­her students fought their way for justice. On the walls in this hall are a number of portraits of apparently famous priests. Each of the portraits looks right at you, no matter where you move in the hall. 
AU these portraits talk to you, too. The first one I sat across from was ofan old stern priest who looked like he used to assign penance for violations ofthe old "lights out" policy backin the good old days. I could hear him saying to me, "Michael, my son. Pay the ticket and redeem yourself" I decided to wait down the hall. 
The second portrait I sat across from was of 
an old Irish-looking priest, the kind you ex­
pect to see cheering at football games or nip­
ping Irish whiskey on St. Patrick's Day. He said to me, "Mikey me boy. Stop this foolishness. Go out and do something constructive with your time. The world is passin' you by and all you can worry about is this silly traffic ticket. Go on now, boy. Do something with your life and stop this playin' around." 
Finally, it was my turn. One ofthe members of the board stuck his head out the door and called my name. I felt like Mr. Brown, that poor little guy in the First Source Bank com­mercial who is waiting to get a loan and the bank officer comes out the door and says, "Come in Mr. Clown," and the name "Clown" echoes down the hall. 
Despite my fears, the appeal itself was the easiest part of the whole process. I walked in, sat down and very informally told the appeal board why I thought the ticket was a crock. They asked me a couple ofquestions and that wa5 it. Then they had me step out in the hall (where the stern priest and the Irish priest were discussingwhy I would never amount to anything andwould surely end up in hell), and quickly returned with a favorable answer. 
But all is not happiness in the parking lots of our humble campus. It seems that Security is planning on posting a sign at the CCE lot in­forming students that they are not allowed to park there. Though this solves the short-term problem of students being unaware that they are not allowed to park in that lot, it ignores the major issue. Students and faculty will still not be allowed to park in this lot, even though there is a real need to make these spaces available to those individuals who feel like in­vesting 75 cents in a parking space. 

P.O.BoxQ 
basketball, like most other sports, is won with defense and not offense? If you were to ask those who play the game, you would find out that Phelps normally substitutes for defensive reasons and not because a player missed a shot. Missing defensive assignments hurts teams more than missed shots. N.C. State won the national championship game not because Houston missed crucial free throws, but be­cause 1 ) Houston tried to stall halfway through the second half, 2) N.C. State played aggressive defense, and 3) Akeem Olajuwon didn't box out Cozell McQueen at the end. The Cougars were physically superior to the Wolfpack, but N.C. State was mentally toug­her. 
Ironically, you make analogous statements between that game and the Notre Dame-Duke game, but for the wrong reasons. The reason we almost won the game was because of the intelligent decisions of the coach and players not because of the panic and fouls of Duke toward the end of the game. Instead, the Irish played subdued but tight defense while Duke toyed with the 45-second clock. If not for some uncanny last second shots by Danny Ferry, the game would have been ours. Put a 45-second clock in the Houston-N.C. State game and Jim Valvano wouldn't have put the Cougars on the line as much as he did. Oh yeah, defensive play. Wasn't that a great defensive play byJohnny Dawkins to save the game for Duke?

Phelps has proven himself as a master in preparing his team not onlyfor each game, but also for life after basketball. He is a credit to Notre Dame and college basketball. Many a time he has taken physically outmanned squads to victories over more talented teams. Even this year one can point to Syracuse, Maryland, and De Paul as teams the Irish have beaten who are blessed with more naturally talented athletes than Notre Dame. But bas­ketball is as much mental as it is physical. Phelps, throughout the years, has molded mentally tough tean.s, and this year the Irish will win NCAA tourney games because they will be mentally tougher than their op­ponents, not because they'll be physically bet­ter.

'lbough posting signs does solve some problems, other solutions could solve the real problem. The CCE lot should be made available to students and faculty who oc­casionally decide to use this lot for whatever reason. They will have to pay 75 cents justlike everyone else, so there is no real bargain here. However, when people in the CCE expect a large crowd and are worried about there being enough space in the lot, signs could be posted prohibiting student and faculty parking for that day. 
This is a very simple solution that manages to keep everyone happy. The students and faculty are happy because they have a more convenient place to parkwhen the need really arises. The people in the CCE are happy be­cause they have all their available spaces when they are truly needed. The administra­tion is happy because they are now pulling in 75 cents (every little bit helps, you know) from each student and faculty member who does not want to walk from Senior Bar to campus when it is 30below zero outside. And security is happy because they can now stop writing all these asinine tickets to students and faculty who make use of this lot, and get onto something really important -like writing tickets to people who park in the library circle for more than 30 minutes. 
What? And force me to take back my Pest of the Year Award? We should be so lucky.

A

favorite place to spend his favorite 
holiday is, excluding Ireland. Ofcourse! 
The land ofclass lists full ofO'Brien's and 
McNamara's, Sean's and Erin's, the home 
of the Fighting Irish-Notre Dame. How 
many Irish eyes wish that they could be 
within gazing distance of the golden dome 
for the holiday of holidays-St. Patrick's 
Day. 

Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students 
should consider themselves lucky. The 
last time spring break was not scheduled 
over St. Patrick's Day was in 1980 and 
before that, 1975. 
This is the first St. Paddy's Day, 
however, that will be celebrated since the 
alcohol policy went into effect. Says 
Associate Vice President for Residence 
Ufe John Goldrick, "The alcohol policy is 
in effect on St. Patrick's Day (just as it is 
on any other day) so we would expect 
'celebrations' to take that fact into ac­
count. It's my understanding that quite a 
number of non-alcohol events are being 
planned and that seems a good sign." 
But even prior to the alcohol policy, St. 
Patrick's Day celebrations were not 
campus-wide beer bashes, as might be 
Imagined. Gatherings in honor of the 
occasion were small and in private rooms. 
True, Corby's did run an ad in 1980 
promising an opening time of 7 a.m. 
Ten-cent green beers were available, with a 5-cent increase every hour until noon. Thirty-five-cent beers continued throug­hout the day. Administrators still shudder upon mentions of that day. 
St. Patrick's Day In 1975 marked a very special day Indeed. It was the day that, as Emil T. Hofman, dean of Freshman Year of Studies, says, "Notre Dame became the nation's capital." The university was host to former President Gerald Ford. 
The president was invited by Father Theodore Hesburgh, University president. Classes were canceled for a morning convocation. A press conference was held, and Ford spoke to the student body that evening. 
The University was in session in 1967, 1969 and 1970. This time period saw as the center ofSt. Pat's Day celebrations a small bar named Sweeney's. Located on Main Street, a 1970 ad for Sweeney's promised 30 kegs and that everything would be green -even bottled beer. The magic pass to enter Sweeney's was a green swizzle stick, and nearly every Notre Dame student found one to bring. 
But a 1986 St. Patrick's Day will be as changed as the times. Student Activities Board Special Events Commissioner Steve Morita says that plans for St. Pat's Day began about a month and a half ago. "We have some really good ideas to get the campus into the spirit of the day. We wanted to turn the dome green, but we ran into some administrative problems," says Morita. SAB, student government, and 
Saint Mary's have, however, planned a weekend full ofevents. The celebration kicks off today with two disc jockeys spinning tunes from 2 
p.m. until 6 p.m. Sophomore Matt Highbarger will be set up on the Fieldhouse Mall, and "The Fresh Cut D)'s," Scott Flora and Kevin Fiorito, will be outside South Dining Hall. Such refresh­ments as green lemonade, green-iced doughnuts, and hot chocolate will be served. 
There are no plans for a parade, but tomorrow's "St. Pat's Day Irish Run" will fill in the open time slot. A Sl entry fee can be paid upon registration in the dining halls or before the run on Saturday. L

Those who plan to run in the 5K race A.. must meet at Stepan Center at I 0:30a.m. \_ ' 
The festivities continue on Sunday with a "Pre-St. Patrick's Day Bash." This event will include a brunch with a "New York" parade theme and will feature a disc 
jockey. It will be held from noon to 4 p.m. at Stepan Center (North Dining Hall will be closed.) 
And then Monday-St. Patrick's Day, 1986. Again at Stepan Center events are planned, from 2 to 11 p.m. Snacks and desserts will be provided by Universitv Food Services. Entertainment will in-

M 
arch 17 is a day celebrated 
grandly not only in Ireland but 

throughout the world. It is the day 
dedicated to St. Patrick, a prisoner 
and slave in a foreign land who later 
returned to his captors, converted 
them to Christianity and became 
their national apostle. 
Many legends surround St. 

Patrick and leave specific details of 
his life relatively obscured. The 
year ofhis birth is generally 
believed to be 3 73, and the place is 
believed to be somewhere in 
Roman Britain, probably not far 
from the Irish Sea. His father, Cal· 
purnius, was a decurion, a certain 
class of Roman senator, who col· 
lected imperial taxes in his district 
and had good social standing. Both 
ofSt. Patrick's parents were pious 
Christians who worked to instill 
their faith in their children. 
Several stories exist which tell of 

extraordinary miracles performed 
by St. Patrick during his childhood. 
One of them shows the reason for 
his devotion to the Blessed Trinity 
and to the Sign ofthe Cross. He and 
his sister, Lupita, were out walking 
one day when she fell and cut her 
head on a stone. She lay as though 
dead, and her brother, in fear and 
sorrow, made the sign of the cross 
on her wound. Immediately she was 
healed, and she got up and walked 
home with her brother in perfect 
health except for the scar that 
remained as testimony to the 
miracle. 
The truth ot this and other stories is uncertain, however, as St. Patrick's own account ofhis · childhood is strongly di1ferent. In his "Confessions," he writes, "We departed away from God and kept not his commandments and were not obedient to our priests who used to admonish us for our salva· tion." 
Whatever the case, St. Patrick was soon to become a very strong and devout Christian. At the age of 16 he was captured at his father's home and led, with thousands of others, into captivity in ireland. Wild raiders had arrived from the Irish coast to bum houses, kill families and take prisoners. 
St. Patrick was sold as a slave and worked for six years tending sheep and swine on the hills ofAntrium. It was during these years that St. Patrick turned more and more to his religion. "Now after I arrived in Ireland tending flocks was my daily occupation and constantly I used to pray in the daytime. The love of God and the fear of Him increased more and more and faith grew and the spirit was roused so that in one day I would say as many as a hundred prayers and at night nearly as many, eve.n while I stayed out in the woods and on the mountain," he wrote. 
St. Patrick says that he was chas­
tened and humbled by hunger and 
nakedness. But it was also during 
this time that Patrick learned the 
Irish language, customs and charac· 
ter. He saw in the Irish people a 
keen appreciation ofthe beautiful and pure. He began to understand and love them. 
St. Patrick was led to his escape by a voice that came in his dreams. Supposedly it was an angel named Victor, the guardian angel of Ireland, who told him when.the ship was ready for him. St. Patrick made a 200-mile journey over land and then traveled by sea to finally return to his home. 
While at home, St. Patrick had the vision that determined the course ofhis life. "And there I saw in a vision ofthe night, a man, as it were, coming from Ireland whose name was Victoricus with letters in· numerable. And he gave me one of these and I read the beginning of the letter containing this title: The Voice ofThe Irish. And while I was 
reciting the beginning ofthe letter I 
thought at the same moment I 
heard the voices ofthose people 
.... And they cried ou·t thus as if 
from one mouth: 'We beseech thee, 
holy youth, to come and walk once 
more among us.' ·· 
St. Patrick went out at once to 
prepare t'or his mission. He labored, 
fasted, prayed and did penance. He 
underwent severe monastic train· 
ing until he was eventually con· 
secrated a bishop and sent, once 
again, to Ireland. 
There, he worked among the 
Irish, preaching the Gospel and 
organizing the Christian church 
"even to the outmost districts 
beyond which no man lived and 
where nobody had ever come to 
baptize or to ordain clergy or to 
confirm the people." Many legends

I ~ stare and clinched hands, toget· her with the "Fighting Irish" nickname, are the very essence of the spirit which has made Notre Dame a name known the whole world over. Surprisingly, they are not the original mascot and nickname ofthe University, but the legacy ofservice built by the stu· dents who have served as the leprechaun throughout the years has established it as one ofthe most famous university mascots in the United States. 
In fact, Notre Dame's mascot used to be an Irish Terrier clothed in a monogram sweater, and the "Fighting Irish" ofNotre Dame used to be the "Catholics.'' The legends ofthese two traditions vary accord· ing to the source. 
The exact year that the leprec­haun was first used is hard to trace. The addition to the cheerleading squad seems to have occured in the late '60s. The leprechaun is first pictured in the 1972 Dome year· book. Since then, the leprechaun's stature has grown to its present popularity.

cludeJohn Kennedy, an Irish singer; The Law, a campus band; and per­formances by the Glee Club and Saint Mary's Irish singers and dan· cers. The band Cold Drinks will perform from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. The occasion will have a nightclub atmosphere and is, again, free to students. 
The weekend's finale will take place at 10 p.m. A half-hour-long fireworks display will be fired from Stepan. Although the optimum location for this event would be the north side ofthe 14th floor ofthe library, wherever you are you'll be able to enjoy this spectacle. 
All ofthese events are the joint efforts ofMorita, Chris Lyon, SAB, 
This year's leprechaun,Jeff An· hut, promotes enthusiasm and tradition at many athletic events. The traditional Irish jig, which is taught to the leprechaun, is danced at times ofextreme jubilation. The wooden shillelagh, a hammer, is passed down from leprechaun to leprechaun. "The shillelagh I have is the same one that every leprechaun has had," says Anhut. 
Anhut has also added some ofhis own stunts to the leprechaun's repertoire. Walking on his hands and a series ofback hand-springs are a must for this year's leprec· haun. One ofAnhut's claims to fame is the "hat trick." "I tried it, it worked, and it got a big response," says Anhut. It was · · ontaneous action but has become a regular part ofthe leprechaun's football routine. 
Working in a stadium is tough. "You have to remember that you're in a stadium and you have to make things as big as possible," says An· hut. In the basketball arena things are tough, but in a different way. "You have a lot less room to work in and everything that you do can be seen by everyone," he says. 
Anhut also designed his outfit with the help ofLola Ross. Since 
student government, and Saint 
Mary's. 
The senior class is fortunate to be spending a legal St. Patrick's Day on campus. Their events center around a St. Pat's party at Senior Bar. The evening will include free corned beefsandwiches, Bud/St. Pat's giveaways and paraphernalia, Harp and Guinness Stout, Irish whiskey and green beer (so says the March senior newsletter.) 
The junior class does not have any class-sponsored events, because as Dave Miklos, junior class vice president, says, "Within the rules of the University, we couldn't plan the kind ofevent that St. Patrick's Day at Notre Dame deserves. Though, we know the junior class will live up to the spirit ofthe holiday on their own." 
A Saint Mary's student govern­ment program called the "St. Paddy's Wagon" will also be run there was no set pattern for the outfit, Anhut modeled the outfit after the one pictured in the popular poster in the bookstore. "He was sort ofkicked back and ha< a sharp outfit on, so that is why I chose him to model it after," says Anhut. 
The "Fighting Irish" nickname began at a football game, ofcourse. One legend states thatJohn Murphy, quarterback ofthe 1909 football team, yelled, "You're all Irish and none ofyou are fighting worth a lick," when the team was losing an Army game. The conse· quent comeback of the team during the game led to the nickname "The Fighting Irish." 
The press began using the nickname to exemplify the fighting spirit ofthe team and the Irish qualities ofdetermination and perseverance. Though the basis of the nickname was honorable, it was many times used to ridicule the predominatly Irish Catholic univer­sity. As the athletic teams began to excel in competition the nickname began to take on an admirable basis once again. Today the Notre Dame leprechaun and the "Fighting Irish" nickname stand for excellence and determination. 
with the purpose ofsafely returning students to campus from St. Patrick's Day celebrations. A school bus will begin its rounds at 8 p.m and continue every half-hour until 2 
a.m. This service is free to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. 
Stops include Saint Mary's ( LeMans Hall), Notre Dame (Library Circle), Campus View and Turtle Creek Apartments, the Five Points bars (Goodwill lot), the corner ofHoward and St. Louis streets, and corner ofLee land and Rex streets. This bus will only return students from the bars, patties, etc. Maps are posted throughout the campus for informa· tion. 
Eighty·three hours ofevents have been planned for the Irish in you this weekend. It would be smart to have a blast · another St. Patrick's Day might not be spent on campus until the 1990s.

also surround this part ofSt. Patrick's life, one ofwhich is his driving ofthe snakes out oflreland. 
During this period ofhistory, a movement called Arianism tried to destroy the doctrine ofthe Blessed Trinity. St. Patrick felt such a strong devotion to the Trinity that he was determined to convince his Irish people ofits truth. In order to help illustrate the mystery of the Trinity, St. Patrick used the shamrock which has since become the emblem of the Irish faith and race. 
The exact date ofSt. Patrick's death is uncertain, but legend has it that he died on March 17, 493. He spent his declining years in Armagh, but died in Saul. For 12 days a grate· ful nation reverently visited his remains, and then he was laid to rest in Downpatrick. 
His name has been honored by the Irish for more than a thousand years and churches have been ded­icated to him all over the world. Today St. Patrick's Day is not only in rememberance ofa great saint, but it is also an expression of the pride and love Irishmen everywhere have for their religion, their heritage and their mother country.

t's going to be hard to squeeze out I 0 paragraphs on The Oar House. 
What makes this place unique or 
memorable among the bars ofSouth Bend? 
Nothing. Well, maybe the decor is a step 
above The Commons or Lee's Grill and 
Barbecue, but that's it. 

~ The Bar Beat ~ c~ The Oar House 
~ u\ '-...(out of four) 
The bar is done in a style vaguely reminis­
cent ofa wooden sailing ship. Seaworn­
looking paneling and heavy rope rigging 
separate the three rooms ofthe bar, one of 
which contains a pool table, another the bar 
and another extra seating. 

Low-level red lighting from antique-type 
ships' lanterns, red carpeting and com­
fortable chairs contribute to give the decor a 
fairly relaxing tone. 

That's not quite it for The Oar House's 
good points. There also is a carry-out 
counter, open until 3 a.m. So for a higher 
price than one would normally pay, one can 
get alcohol for after-hours. 

Other than these two aspects, this bar is a 
yawner. They don't sell draft beer or, by 
extension, pitchers. 

The bartender said that there are never any 
drink specials. Bummer. 

However, from 4 to 7 p.m. every evening 
one can get (ready for this?) free munchies. 
What are these free munchies? "Mostly 
popcorn, but sometimes we have nachos 
with that hot sauce," the bartender said. 
Great. Ifone wants free popcorn The 
Commons has it, and Chi-Chi's provides 
nachos with that hot sauce and also that bean 
dip. Either one ofthose establishments is 
more interesting in terms ofclientele. 
The people who frequent The Oar House seem to be the middle-aged executive crowd. These people are here for a beer after work at the office or after the convention at The Holiday Inn lets out for the night. It's not the kind ofnightspot where college students generally hang out. 
What makes this place unique or memorable among the bars of South Bend? Nothing. Well, maybe the de­cor is a step above The Commons or Lee's Grill ... but that's it. 
A friend got so bored he decided to help write the Bar Beat by reviewing the men's restroom. His notes say it had no toilet paper, no mirror and no hand dryers. Customers will have to use the paper towels instead. 
In the men's room there is a line ofgraffiti which says "Dave is a stone fox." One wonders what a stone fox is. Is it a stoned fox or a concrete fox? And why is Dave a stone fox? 
Obviously, I wouldn't recommend the Oar House. 
To avoid The Oar House do not drive up 31 North from campus. Do not drive past King Cellar on the right, and do not look to the left before getting to Naugles, where The Oar House sign will be flashing.

After the Church, what do you really have? 

Father Robert Griffin 
Letters to a Lonely God 
I 
try to imagine what the world 
would be like if the Catholic 
Church were to disappear tomor· 
row. Ifthe Catholic Church Is as 
bad as some ofits members say It is, 
maybe the world would be better 
offif the Church took a powder. 
I'm tired ofdefending the creaky 
old structure tha't is, allegedly, so 
out of touch with the needs ofthe 
human race. Every school child 
who reads history knows how bad 
the Church got In the Middle Ages. 
In the 20th century also, It seems, 
all ofus clerics are heartless, from 
the pope on down. All ofus are 
ignorant ofwhat people need when 
we try to make them believe the old 
myths and superstitions are still 
alive. 
The Catholic Church, for ex· ample, has this unhealthy hangup with sex. It's stupid to try to play the dating game by Catholic rules during a sexual revolution. A stu· dent, trying not to hurt my feelings, let me know that it is impossible to le8fslate morality. Trying to le8fslate morality, he said, is one of the Church's mistakes. "What are the consequences of breaking one of the moral laws?" I asked. 
"The Church works on your conscience to destroy you with guilt," he replied. "The Church tries to make you think you are going to hell." 
He explained to me how the bishops invent the theolo8fcal rules, and then try to make flesh· and-blood creatures fit the thcoreti· cal framework. He sounded like a freedom fighter when Inquired, "Who needs such a burdensome reli8fon?" 
I said, "Maybe you have the cart before the horse." "What do you mean?" he asked. 
I said, "The human condition existed before God gave Moses the Ten Commandments. The use of human sexuality has serious conse· quenccs. Couples·wve themselves to each other trustin&ly as a result ofhuman affection. As a result, things start to develop; maybe a baby is conceived. Only then, maybe, the woman discovers she was wrong to trust the man, or, maybe the man finds out the woman doesn't trust him to help her as a partner in responsibility. Even without the baby, a man or woman can discover they're trapped or hurt by a relationship in which they gave too much, too soon. In an ideal world, where people foresee the consequences of their behavior, they would be wise enough not to get caught in an emotional situation they're uncom· fortable with. On this illusory plane, the so-called 'rules' are valuable as warnings of the swamps that lie ahead." 
"By swamps, you undoubtedly mean the sins that lie ahead?" 
I shrugged my shoulders in an· noyancc at his willingness to think the worst. "When I'm talking to a teenage 8frl made pregnant by a teenage kid, sin is not a word that comes quickly to my mind. I'm much more ready to think, 'What have you done to yourselves?' I'm more inclined to ask, 'Howcan I help you most?' The two ofthem will resolve the burden of their guilt when they deal with their consciences, which, for alii know, may be as pure as the snow. Even if they arc as perfect as the angels of God, they're not ready, as high school students, to strart raising a family." 
"A Church worth it's salt would help educate teenagers to use precautions that would keep them out of trouble," he said pointedly. 
"It's not the Church's business to teach things which contradict its tradition," I said. "I'm not going to tell adolescents, having sex, to use birth control. My job Is to show them that love means they shouldn't hurt each other by wan· dering off the reservation. What good would a Church be ifit changed its tradition for the mistakes ofa secular society indif· ferent to God?" 
"How very caring the Church's servants turn out to be," he sneered. 
"I'm sure you'll find the world much more caring and for8fving," I answered. 
I'm tired ofbeing a part ofa Church that gets kicked around. Maybe the Church, in its villainy, has been superseded by the im· proved faith and morals ofthe liberal establishment. Suffering, according to the newspapers, con· tinucs to go on in the secular city. The sexual revolution, they say, is almost over. Herpes and AIDS· sicknesses, it seems to me, which arc the only modern ills the Church is not blamed for · have made monopmy fashionable and ncccs· sary. Women find it difficult to be sin8lc-sex parents. Some ofthem arc bitter about the old-fashioned 
morality that left them exposed to mothering children. 
Ifthe Church were to disappear, mankind would be free ofthe right· to-lifers. It's hard to say how much the Gospel ofChrist would be remembered. The world wouldn't have to deal with rcli8fous crusades and inquisitions; however, there would be no strong voice protest· ing against evil, and offering salva· tion. The other denominations professing Christ would face tough sledding, if the Goliath ofthe churches bit the dust. 
Some power structure like Com· munism would probably try to fill the void. The State would probably make regulations controlling the acceptable forms ofsexual expres· sion; no self-respecting power structure could let all that psychic energy do as It pleases. I wonder if people would feel freer as sexual creatures. 
I'm tired oflistening to Catholics so lacking in class that they go around whining, "It's the Church's fault." I've heard it all my Catholic life: "I'm pregnant and sin8lc; it's the Church's fault." (For God's sake, how?) "I'm Irish and Catholic; therefore I drink. It's the Church's fault." "I'm a priest, and I'm lonely. It's the Church's fault." "I'm a second-rate citizen. It's the Church's fllult." "I went to Catholic schools, so I'm socially inhibited. It's the Church's fault." "I'm healthy and horny; yet I stay a celibate. It's the Church's fllult." 
"Blaming the Church" is a parlor pme you can play all your life. You can play all your life. You can duck the blame for everything: your failures, omissiom, sorrows, disap­pointments. The infinite varieties of shabbiness can be heaped as monstrosities on the shoulders of the pope, the bishops, priests, brot· hers and sisters. And if, may God forbid, you end up in a place of everlasting torment, you can ex· plain to the devil, when you meet him face to fllce, "It's the Church's fllult," and go through all eternity blaming the Church. 
My opinion is, that in the growth toward Christian maturity, the Church is trying to help us, showing us the truth that is part ofan ancient wisdom. The Church, as a servant, has to live and learn; therefore the Church will be smarter tomorrow than It is today. It has to live and learn; therefore the Church changes its mind over anything: look how long it took us to get an English Mass! 
The Church, ifit exists forever, will never be as liberal as the New Morality, nor should you want It to be. Where would you go then for a second opinion? Most of the time, we suspect in our hearts that the Church is right. As Shakespeare wrote, "The faults, dear Brutus, arc not in the stars, but in ourselves." 

Supreme effort nets Irish the win, but Gipp pays for it 
This is the 21tb episode ofThe Obsen1er's sertal publication ofthe Notre /Jame football story, "The Gipper's Ghost." In last week's episode, Nicki Summers, the sports editor ofThe Observer and steady of Dutch Reagan, the phenomenal running back ofthe resurgent Fighting lrlsb foot· ball team, bad confronted Dutch with a staggering discor'ery. that Dutch was really the human guise ofthe ghost of George Gtpp, the legendary Irish great. Dutch/George Gipp had surprised Nicki further by rer,ealing that the ghost of Knute Rockne was on Earth in the guise of Father Rock, the team chaplain.

In the locker room, Joe Kelly spoke to his team. "In the first half, you showed you could play with one of the best teams in the country. In the second half, show them you are the nation's best."

Notre Dame's guys are big, but I feel we can get up and down the floor better." 
Little Rock, 22-10, has won 18 of its last 19 games. The Trojans beat Centenary last Saturday to win the Trans America Athletic Conference tournament and an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. 
Despite this, it's easy to see how 
Little Rock could be intimidated by Notre Dame. The Irish are ranked 1Oth in this week's AP poll and are a team which the Little Rock players have seen on television a number of times this season. Intimidation will not be a factor tonight, though, ac­cording to the Little Rock players.

on your Bengal Bout victory.  

"We're not intimidated by Notre Dame. They lace up their shoes the same way we do. They get taped up the same place we do," says Myers. "The only dilference is that it says Notre Dame across the front oftheir uniforms and it says UALR across the front ofours. 
"We're really loose. We don't have anything to lose." 
Irish coach Digger Phelps says he cannot afford to worry about the mental state of Little Rock or how well the Trojans have been playing lately. 

"We've just got to be ourselves and go out and play people," Phelps says. "We played a tough road schedule to get us ready for this and ended the season in a great way, by being ranked in the top I0. Now let's see how good we really are." 
Phelps says he expects to see a lot of zone, some man-to-man and a good press from Little Rock tonight. 
"We'll do a lot of crazy things," says Newell. 
The Little Rock coach is attempt· ing build the Trojan program, and thinks that playing Notre Dame can do nothing but help. 
"We realize that right now we're an underdog," Newell says, "but this is not the last time we're going to be here. You've got to set your goals high, and we have set our goals high.

Thirteen freshmen are among the I 5 new members of the I986 Saint Mary's track and field team, which begins its season tomorrow in the Spring Arbor Indoor Invitational in Spring Arbor, Mich. 
Six returning team members will lead the Belles at the event, includ· ing senior Mary Luneen, who was not on the team last season but did compete her freshman and sop· homore years, juniors Anne Bianco and Mariclaire Driscoll, and sop· homores Cathy Kennedy, Mary O'Connor and Karen Walker.

Holtz has some big worries with his '86 Irish 
Sped8l to The Obee~r 
Notre Dame football Coach Lou Holtz says he has discovered shock· ing weaknesses in recruiting and player skills but denies any implicit criticism of his predecessor, Gerry Faust. 
"We have more problems than we can say grace over right now," Holtz said yesterday during a press confer· ence. 
The Notre Dame squad was prepared to begin a five-day spring practice session today, the first un­der the leadership of the former Minnesota coach. Faust resigned and joined the University ofAkron after a disappointing five-year career at Notre Dame that ended with a 5·6 season and a crushing 58-7 defeat at Miami. 
"I'm worried exceptionally much about depths in the defensive line," Holtz said. The new coach says he has more quarterbacks than defensive lineman, an imbalance in recruiting that will complicate the task of fielding a highly competitive team. 
Football

said Holtz. "Obviously, you'd like to be fair with everybody on the foot· ball team and you'd like to give them all a tremendous opportunity, but that's going to be difficult to do be· cause you have many more quarter· backs than you do defensive linemen. The thing that concerns me the most is having an equal op· portunity to evaluate everybody at all positions, and that's difficult to do with limited defensive linemen." 
As far as evaluation of his players, Holtz is prepared to start from square one. 
"My impressions ofour personnel have come strictly from interviews, personal relationship with them and observations in the winter program," says Holtz. "I have not made any evaluation based on past performances. What's happened in the past I couldn't care less about. I don't know what a young man was 

"I worry about depth, I worry about speed, and we're not very strong," he said. 
During the questioning, Holtz seemed to take pains to avoid open criticism of Faust. But he repeatedly pointed out weaknesses and dis· tanced himself from Faust, despite praising his predecessor for in· tegrity and compassion. 
"I can count, and when I count numbers at certain positions, they don't go very high," Holtz said. 
"I'm sure (Faust) had reasons and plans for the way he did thin~. I'm not criticizing that whatsoever," he added later. 
"But I was shocked to find out that we had three defensive linemen on scholarship on the whole football team and six quarterbacks," he said. "That's not a criticism by any stretch of the imagination, but it is going to present some problems. 
"I don't see how anyone could ever criticize or second-guess Gerry Faust," he continued. "By the same token, I sure hope you don't expect me to be like him, because I cannot be." 
Holtz, a colorful talker who enjoys turning a phrase, may have over­stated the defensive weaknesses, though not by much, Athletic Department spokesman John Heis· ler said later. 
Four defensive line starters were under scholarship and a few other rode the bench, butgot little playing experience, he said. Nevertheless, he said, those positions were under­manned. 
Holtz did praise his players repeatedly for their intelligence and 
asked to do, I don't know what his 
physical condition was, I don't know 
what his mental attitude was. 

"It would be totally unfair to evaluate somebody based on the past when I don't know the condi· tions that surrounded his perfor­mance. I've always started from ­scratch and gone from there."

willingness to accept changes in as­signment. 
The quarterback position won't be filled soon, he said. Holtz noted, however, that Terry Andrysiak threw more touchdowns and fewer interceptions last year than regular starter Steve Beuerlein. 
"As far as the quarterback situa· tion, we just want to find who can put it in the endzone," he said. 
Holtz said his emphasis on Notre Dame weaknesses might ease "undue pressure" on the players, without misleading Irish fans. "If we're any good, I won't have to tell you," he said. "You'll see it."

Lacrosse team faces Ashland tomorrow 
Spedal to 1be Oblerver 

The Notre Dame lacrosse team continues preparations for its 1986 season with a scrimmage against Ashland College at 1:30 p.m. tomorrow at Cartier Field. 
The Irish will be without the services oftwo key players who will graduate in May. Jusin Shay and Bob Trocchi. Returning, however, is last season's second-leading scorer, Joe Franklin ( 40 goals and 11 assists). . 
Franklin will play one attack position, with the other spot probably being manned by senior co-captain Tom Grote. The other co-captain, senior Mike Rice, anchors a solid Irish defensive unit. 
After Saturday's scrimmage, the team travels to Virginia for spring break for a four-game road trip.

Irish toomey trek begins tonight vs. Little Rock 
Unheralded Trojans are planning to capitalize ' on their opportunity 

ByJEFF BLUMB 
SportsEditor 
MINNEAPOLIS-It will be a very confident Arkansas-little Rock basketball team that faces the Irish tonight (10:37 p.m., WNDU­TV) in the first round of the NCAA tourna­ment. Little Rock's day in the spotlight is today at the Metrodome, and the Trojans plan to take advantage of the opportunity presented them. 

"No one has heard of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock," says Trojan head coach Mike Newell, "but this is the start of something big for UALR. Our players have confidence in themselves and have waited for the opportunity to get some exposure." 
Don't think this fact has been lost on Notre Dame. The Irish realize that they cannot afford to take Little Rock lightly. 
"We've been in the limelight and maybe they haven't," says Irish forward Ken Barlow. "I'm sure they'll come ready to play." 
The game figures to be quite a battle on the boards. Last week, Little Rock lead the country in rebounding margin with the Irish being second in that category. But this week that is reversed, Notre Dame is first and Little Rock is second. 
Up front, Little Rock starts Michael Clarke and Pete Myers, both 6-6, and 6-7 Paris 

McCurdy. Clarke is 15th in the nation in rebounding this week. At guard, Little Rock goes with senior Myron jackson and freshman Paul Springer. 
With such a small front line, the Trojan!> will try to use their quickness to combat Notre Dame's height advantage. Little Rock's game is 


to run, shoot and score a lot. The Trojans are 17th in the country in scoring margin, averag­ing 79.3 points per game. 
"Notre Dame has good beef inside," says Myers. "The key for us to combat that is to use our quickness to get up and down the floor." 
Clarke says he welcomes the chance to face a front line like Notre Dame's. 
"Going up against guys like Tim Kempton and Ken Barlow will give me an opportunity to see how good my talents are," he says. "I've waited for this for a long time. 
"We feel we match up good with them.

Football team opens spring drills this afternoon 
By LARRY BURKE 
AssistantSports Editor 

While most of the eountry is engrossed in the NCAA basketball tournament, it will be football, not basketball, that is the main order of business for Notre Dame players and coaches this afternoon. 
Head Coach Lou Holtz and his Irish open their 1986 spring practice schedule at 3:30p.m. today. The squad has four practices and a scrimmage scheduled before spring break. 
"We're taking a gamble whether we can get some practice time done prior to the spring break," Holtz said. "But due to the fact that this is the first year and a new year, we feel it is to our advantage and to the ad­vanatage of the players if we could possibly have five days of practice before they leave for break. · 
"As I have mentioned before, we do not have very many defensive linemen and we have a severe shortage at offensive line. Number one, if somebody has a bump or a bruise after five days, that gives them quite a bit of time to rehabilitate, so we should start off with a relatively injury-free team after the break. 
"The other thing is after five days, I think we'll have a better idea of what direction we need to go on of­fense, defense and alignment of per-

sonnel," Holtz added. "If you wait and go after break and go straight through, you get an individual injured and he may miss a large amount of time without a break. In addition to that, you don't have the time to really sit down and evaluate what personnel changes or position moves you may wish to make." 
Holtz said he hopes the South Bend weather, unpredictable at this time of year, would be cooperative, because outdoor workouts will be important. 
"We can't go indoors if the weat­her is inclement because I under­stand they're having some events here at the ACC which would con­flict," said Holtz. "If we can't go before spring break, we're just going to have to start after, which would be exceptionally disappointing. I don't really know what inclement weather is, though. Snow may not be. 
"The real criteria is whether or not the elements are going to detract from the attention ofan ath­lete to the point that you won't be able to accomplish a whole lot." 
The major problem Holtz will have to face is a shortage oflinemen. As ofnow there are only a total of 1 2 on scholarship-eight on offense and four on defense. 
"That's something that will have an awful lot of effect on what we're able tu do at the other positions,"
