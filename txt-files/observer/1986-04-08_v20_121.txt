U.S. strike against Libya studied by Reagan 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON, D.C. -Presi­dent Reagan was reportedly study­ing yesterday the possibility of a military strike against Libya, ac­cording to the U.S. envoy and am­bassador to West Germany. 
The ambassador's statement came as the United States compiled evidence that the renegade Arab republic was involved in the fatal bombing of a West Berlin disco. 
Ambassador Richard Burt, the 
U.S. envoy to West Germany, said there were ''very clear indications that there was Libyan involvement" in the nightclub bombing that kill­ed and American Army sergeant 
and a Turkish woman.  
When  asked  whether  Reagan  
favored  a  military  move  against  
Khadafy,  Burt  said  that  he  was  

"studying this issue right now." 
One U.S. diplomat in the divided city, speakin on condition he not be identified, said: "The Libyan angle is being explored very vigorously. Khadafy is an active suspect." 
On his return from a California vacation Sunday, Reagan refused comment when reporters asked him whether he planned to strike at the Libyan leader. He ignored ques­tions yesterday as he left the White House to watch the start of the Baltimore Orioles' season-opening baseball game against the Cleveland Indians. 
At the White House, spokesman Edward Djerejian said the ad­ministration would "have to reserve final judgment on exactly who was responsible until we make further progress on the investigations." 
But he said the weekend explo­sion in West Berlin and the bomb­ing last week of a TWA jetliner over Greece followed the "pattern of indiscriminate violence which we have traced to the types of terrorist activities that Col. (Moammar)

Bush finds no 'common solution' on stabilizing volatile oil market 
Associated Press 
MANAMA, Bahrain -Vice Presi­dent George Bush said Monday the United States and Saudi Arabia found no "common solution" on stabilizing the volatile oil market during three days of talks. 
He also said the two countries disagree about what oil price level is desirable. From the Saudi stand­point, "the stronger the price for in­ternational oil the better . . . That does not coincide with the best in­terest of the United States," Bush told a news conference in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. 
He said, however, it is not the role of the United States "to dictate to countries around the world what the price of oil should be." 
The vice president later flew to 

Bahrain on the second leg of a Mid­dle East visit that includes Oman ,and North Yemen. He was greeted by Sheikh lsa bin Salman ai­
Khalifa, the ruler of this cluster of 
islands in the Persian Gulf. 
Bush discussed security and 
economic issues into the early mor­
ning· yesterday with Saudi King 
Fahd at his summer palace in 
Dhahran. 
The vice president then ended his 
visit to the gulf city with a trip to a 
Saudi air force base to watch exer­
cises involving U.S.-made F-15 and 
F-5 fighter bombers and a British­
made Tornade warplane. Dhahran 
is a front line of air defense against 
possible attack by Iran, which has 
been fighting Iraq for 55 years on 
the other side of the Persian Gulf. 
Discussing the different U.S. and Saudi viewpoints on oil prices, Bush said, "The best way to sort it out is (the) market. So we have not gone in there to fix prices or discuss levels of pricing. 
"I was not sent here on a price­fixing mission." 
Asked if there was any common ground for stabilizing the sharply fluctuating market, Bush said, "Not really. I hope there's a better understanding on their part.... Certainly there wasn't any common solution found." 
Oil is a major topic of Bush's trip. Last week, he said national 
security  interests  would  be  
threatened  by  low  prices  that  
weakened  U.S.  producers  and  
energy financiers.

Survey results indicate ND faculty openness to divestment option 
By BETH CORNWELL 
Staff Reporter 
A majority of Notre Dame facul­ty responding to a survey by a Faculty Senate committee agreed that the University should divest from South Africa now, or at a specified date in the near future if certain conditions are not satisfied. 
A report detailing the survey's results will be discussed at the Faculty Senate meeting tomorrow night. 
Ninety-six respondents (34.2 per­cent) advocated immediate divestiture, while another 79 (28.1 percent) suggested setting a date in the future after which Notre Dame will divest unless South Africa has legally committed itself to both en­ding apartheid and enfranchising all South Africans, according to the report. 
"However, the results of the poll must be used with some care, because many faculty remained silent," said the report's introduc­tion. 
"One may regard the results as supportive but not conclusive evidence of a majority opinion on the issues discussed... In certain areas, one must say, that ev idence 
seems  substantial,"  the  introduc­ 
tion said.  
Approximately  930  faculty  

members received the survey, ac­cording to Frank Connolly, author of the report and chairman of the Faculty Senate Committee on South African Investments. 
Out of the 281 responded, 209 
(74.4 percent) agreed that it was the responsibility of the senate to discuss the issue of South African investments with the Board of Trustess, said Connolly, whose committee conducted the survey. 
Forty-eight respondents (17.1 percent) agreed with the policy of continued constructive engagement announced by the Board of Trustees in 1985, said Connolly. 
Twenty-two percent said the senate should not discuss South African investments in the first place, the report said. 
Forty-two (14.9 percent) favored the current University investment policy, but in conjunction with a reconsideration of that policy when the Sullivan Principles expire in May 1987. 
The survey indicates that a heavy majority of the Notre Dame faculty is primarily concerned with the moral implications of the Universi­ty policy, while they are split. over their concern about the financial impact of that policy on the University endowment, said Con­nolly. 
In January it was proposed that the committee bring to the senate a motion on divestment, according to the report. Some senators then voiced concern that this motion might not represent the opinion of the faculty, the report continues. The survey was decided upon to aid in the motion.

Focus On vn11 America's YOUFut HELP 

SAVE BABIES 

"Hey, did you hear? Even the showers are co-ed" 
My fellow American dormmates were as surprised as I about the living situation in which the Notre . Dame Innsbruck program had placed us. 
We lived in an apartment set aside for Austrian students, although foreign students lived there as well. We shared floor and kitchen space with both men and women. We used the same bathorrom facilites, in­cluding the showers. 
Our dormitory had no hall rector, no resident assistants, no hall monitors of any kind. The hall staff consisted of a woman who lived in the basement, ac­ting as little more than the head cleaning lady. 
Our program director coordinated academics and organized trips, meetings and other important pro­gram activities. He very rarely interfered with our per­sonal lives, meddled in our travel plans or regulated our social affairs. 
This is going to be a long shot from campus living, I thought, as soon as I moved into the coed apartment. Total freedom. No supervision. Coed showers. I wondered how life would be without overwhelming rules anc;i how we could save ourselves from our now­released, immoral and irresponsible inner souls. 
But the situation really worked well. And we didn't break any records for immorality, either. Without the rules that tried to force us to be mature and responsi­ble adults, we were free to be mature and responsible adults .. 
In addition to the moral decisions left entirely to us were also the little "freedoms" that accompany living on one's own. Male students had to do their own laun­dry. The convenience of the dining halls was not available to us: we were on food budgets and had to shop wisely to stay fed. 
Finally, several headaches accompanied what was one of the most essential and enjoyable aspects of the year: travel. Visas, train passes, housing, language barriers and other concerns were all part of the preparation required to make a trip safe and suc­cessful. We went where we wished and learned to take care of ourselves even in edgy situations. 
Yet travel was so satisfying because it was an experi­ment in independence. When the experiment worked, it was a personal success. When it didn't work, it became a personal lesson. 
Of course, it would be impossible to re-shoot this entire scene on campus. The differences between American and European societies cause several of the inconsistencies between study abroad and at Notre Dame. Without the freedom of the year abroad, many of the year's experiences would be stifled. 

The coed dorms in Innsbruck, London, Israel, and Tianjin represent only the tip of the iceberg. Foreign study is simply different from what happens here at home. 
there are obvious reasons why the administration downplays the inconsistencies foreign study programs demonstrate in following du Lac. The main reason is that the experiments in the abroad programs work. If they were unsuccessful, the University would eliminate them. 
Not all these experiences can be offered by life in Notre Dame, Ind., the United States of America. 
But why not coed dorms? · 
Most students who return from study abroad will agree they developed healthy relationships with.both sexes during the year. Often this was enhanced by liv­ing in mixed dorms. 
If the .l.Jniversity admits that coed dorms work with student's abroad, that they are part of a successful ex­periment, that they promote responsible and mature adult men and women, why can't this experiment be attempted under the shadow of the Golden Dome? 
As many students choose to go abroad, many might also opt to live in a coed environment. The University should learn to put its successful ideas into practice at home as well as abroad.

Nicaraguan opposition newspapers find censorship a common practice 
Associated Press 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua -For editor Jaime Chamorro and his op­postion newspaper, La Prensa, cen­sorship is a way of life. 
On one recent day, for instance, the government forbade Chamorro from publishing 18 stories he had planned. It also ordered him to discard four photographs and change the headlines and delete specific paragraphs from four other stories. Not a single page escaped unscathed. 
Articles killed by the censor that day included one about Miskito In­dians of the Caribbean coast com­plaining that the Sandinista military had bombarded their villages. Another was about a pastoral letter from Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, one of the harshest critics of the leftist regime. 

That day, too, the censor killed an article about Managua taxi drivers complaining about the need for increased fares and the critical lack of spare parts for their vehicles. 
Still, in his own way, Chamorro has the final say. Censored articles are tacked outside the office on an old bulleting board for passerbys to see. In the middle of the board is a faded card that reads: "The freedom ofthe press is the right of choice in what they read in the daily newspapers. There is the Sandinista-controlled Barricada, the pro-government Nuevo Diario and the heavily censored La Pren­sa.

government."  
Nicaraguans  have  a  limited  

"We are not against social change. We are against the system of today... we want changes with freedoms and democracy and not a totalitarian system like this one," Chamorro said in explaining why he continues to publish the 60-year­old newspaper in the face of cen­sorship. 
Most days, Chamorro makes the ordered changes and the afternoon newspaper is published, although often it does not reach the streets until after dark. 

Contras undergoing shakeup in leadership 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON D.C. -The chief U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebel group, concerned about charges of mismanagement, is engaged in a behind-the-scenes reorganization that has put a Miami-based exiled businessman in charge Of coodinating financial and political operations. 
But Nicaraguans close to the United Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO) say the shakeup has been kept quiet for fear it could jeopar­dize President Reagan's $100 million aid request by acknowledg­ing existing problems in handling earlier U.S. assistance. 
The Democratic-controlled House is scheduled to reconsider Reagan's proposal for military and other aid on April 15, after defeating it last month. Reagan's 
proposal  narrowly  cleared  the  
Republican-dominated  Senate  on  
March 27.  
Leonardo  Somarriba,  an  

Amercan-educated businessman who runs a printing company in Miami, was named UNO's secretary-general last month, although the appointment has not been publicly announced. He is prepared plans for an overhaul of the rebel group's internal opera­tions. 
In a recent interview with the

Khadafy  has  sponsored  in  the  
past."  
Burt,  however,  indicated  the  

United States had intelligence in­formation before the Berlin bomb­ing that the Libyan embassy in East Berlin was planning a terrorist at­tack. 
Djerejian said one action the United States is seeking, following the two recent terrorist incidents in­volving Americans, is ''the possible closing of more Libyan Peoples' Bureaus known to be the source of terrorist planning and activity." 
Although the European allies have declined in the past to go along with U.S. attempts to coor-Associated Press, Somarriba ac­cepted the characterization of his new role as UNO's "chief executive officer" and said he would try to "establish a structure so the three members (of UNO's directorate) can work together." 
". . . I personally have no political ambitions," he said. 
Somarriba's appointment represents an apparent shift in power away from the umbrella group's three publicly known direc­tors: Adolfo Calero, who also heads the chief rebel army, the CIA-organized Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN), and two former Sandinista officials, Arturo Cruz and Alfonso Robelo. 
The appointment follows moun­ting complaints from Nicaraguan exiles that the UNO -created at White House urging last June ­had failed to acheive either political or military unity in the war against Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government. The exiles also have criticized the UNO for nepotism and its handling of U.S. funds. 
The Nicaraguan Busines Coun­cil, a group of exiled business leader who have worked with the UNO, outlined the complaints in a heated, private meeting with the three UNO directors in Miami on Jan. 18, according to several par­ticipants who spoke on condition of ananymity. 
dinate the economic and diplomatic isolation of Khadafy, Djerejian said the latest terrorist incidents, "both on European soil, have sen­sitized the Europeans to the danger, that the danger is really at their doorstep, not only at our doorstep." 
Djerejian said that in its various diplomatic communications, the United States is stressing that "it's imperative for the civilized com­
munity  to  work  together  much  
more  effectively  t han  ever  in the  
past."  

Djerejian also said Reagan would express his condolences yesterday to the family of Army Sgt. Kenneth T. Ford of Detroit, the American killed in the bombing of the disco frequented by American servicemen stationed in East Berlin.

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. ­Investments in companies doing business in South Africa in no way indicates suppon for that country's policy of racial separa­tion, says a Purdue University of­ficial. 
And desipite an an ti·apartheid p·rotest during the weekend, Purdue has no plans to divest its holdings in such companies. 
1oseph Bennett, director of university relations, said business investments do not mean that the school supports apartheid. 
"It's pretty hard to have a sound business portfolio if you try to limit" investments on the basis of where companies do business, Ben­nett said Sunday. "The university has tried to make its position clear from the beginning. There simply is 
no  basis  for  saying . that  Purdue  
supports apartheid."  
He noted  that Purdue  trustees  

have voted against divestiture three times. 

In a rally Saturday, 22 protesters 
-19 of them Purdue students ­
were arrested when they refused to 
leave a makeshift shanty built on 
campus to symbolize the plight of 
black South Africans. 

The demonstrators, protesting the school's reported $10 million in­vested in companies doing business in South Africa, were all released after the arrests. 
Meanwhile, Indiana University trustees voted over the weekend to divest all holdings in two com­panies doing business in South Africa. 
The companies, General Signal and Schlumberger Ltd., have not satisfactorily complied with guidelines established by the trustess at their November meeting in South Bend, the school announc­ed Saturday. 
The guidelines include com­pliance with the Sullivan Principles and other measures designed to help end policies of discrimination in South Africa.

guest column 
So now what? Good question. When people heard that we were going to stay here in rockin' South Bend over break to get the hang of this student government cheese, they had one oftwo reactions: some laughed and called us fools, others expressed a feeling ofpity. All were operating under the outdated assump­tion that this student government stuff is a chore. We had fun here over break, (what?!), and we will continue to prove that these jobs can be entertaining. Now calm down all you crazy politicos -that does not necessarily mean that we are going to sit up in our offices giggling senselessly. 
We were catapulted straight from our couches into office. We're not some kind of political machine; we don't even compare to a well constructed wind-up toy. We are regular guys, and we wonder about the same things that most other regular guys (and gals) wonder about, namely, "Why is everybody staring at the sidewalk instead of saying hello or even (gasp!) smiling?" 
For those who have previously operated under the delusion that student government here at Notre Dame resembles any type ofreal world governing body, it's time to admit that we are not likely to change the world radi­cally. However, we can change the day to day life of the average student, and we will. 
Surveys have indicated that the student body happiness ratio goes up significantly in response to the playing of loud music on the quads on Friday afternoons; so we will see to it that either a band or a deejay is making noise every Friday (depending on the crazy South Bend weather patterns, of course). Nutty Cuckoo Dave! Nutty Cuckoo. 

Now, we will never be able to pull this whole thing off if we lose touch with our beloved couch brethren; so we are going to go to extremes to make ourselves accessible. Sometime in the near future you will be notic­ing some strange-looking individuals sitting behind desks out in the middle of the quad somewhere. We are going to bring the whole show out into the open, doing whatever it is we do right out there where you can see us, talk to us, advise us, trip over us. (Relax Grandma, it's just the crayon guys). 
We ask you to keep in mind that until a few weeks ago we made a habit of doing exactly what you do -sit around and complain about the quality of life around here. We hope that now that there are a couple of regular guys in office you will do what we never did -lean forward, pick up the phone and call us. We're almost always either in our room or in the stu­dent government offices (the numbers are in the book), so why not give us a call and scream unrealistic demands in our ear? We want to hear from the rest of you.

But in order to be most effective, we need your input. We address every aspect of Saint Mary's community life: educational, spiritual, social and physical through com­missioners who sit on the Board of Gover­nance and the Programming Board. 
The Board of Governance is chaired by the student body president and provides a forum for discussion of issues and poliCies concern­ing students. This board consists of the vice president of student affairs, the hall and class presidents, and the following commis-

The Board of Governance met with and fostered good relations with almost every area of the College in 1985-86. The 1984-85 Board of Governance was responsible for the change in parietal hours. 
The Programming Board is chaired by the vice president of student affairs and is responsible for coordinating all student ac­tivities on campus. This board consists of hall and class vice presidents and the follow­ing commissioners: Mary Carol Cahill, calendar; Chris Didonato; Haggar College Center; Kim Drahota, athletic; Louise Foley, foreign studies; Smith Hashagen, Notre Dame Hall Presidents' Council liaison; Lisa Lawler, traditional events; Sue Miller, secretary; Suzanne Ritger, publicity; Kelly Nieses, publicity assistant; Jill Tiefenthaler, off-campus; and Eunice Tornetta, entertain­ment. 
The 1985-86 Programming Board spon­sored weekly coffeehouses called "That's Entertainment" and was responsible for Lit­tle Sisters' Weekend and the St. Paddy's Wagon.

fairs of the College. The Council is chaired by the vice president of academic affairs and college relations and consists of student representatives from the following commit­tees: Health and Counseling, Library, Cultural Affairs, Teacher's Education Ad­missions and Scholarship and Curriculum; and also a student representative from each academic department. The 1986-87 Council will be reviewing the minors program and registration procedures and will be focusing on increased faculty involvement. 
We are eager to take a step in a responsible direction. You can help define our 1986-87 goals by contacting us. We have mailboxes in the Haggar Student Activities office, of­fices on the third floor of Haggar where we can be reached at 284-5373, and we will be sponsoring a Gripe Night on April 20 to hear your comments, suggestions and complaints. It's not too late to get involved. Hall officer elections are April 23. We are excited for next year. Remember, we wear students' shoes!

DearEditor: 
After reading Shirley Cushnie's fire-and­brimstone letter condemning contraception being taught in St. Mary's recent sexuality series, I shuddered to think that such archaic drivel was printed at an institution of higher learning such as Notre Dame. 
lbough I agree with Cushnie that sexuality is a gift from God, and use ofthis gift should be carefully considered, I disagree with her posi-

tion on birth control vehemently. Teaching the existence ofcontraception is not a satanic evil or a direct attack on the teachings of the Catholic Church. Indeed, doesn't the much heralded Natural Family Planning method achieve the same end? 
Cushnie stated strongly that "evil cannot be fought by evil." I submit that evil cannot be fought by ignorance. Making students aware oflatent facts in no way serves to condone or even encourage the use ofcontraceptives. In­stead, it makes them more clearlyaware ofthe moral choices that are before them.

"It goes through stages. When I first got here it was longer than this. Then I got a cut and left this long but shaved it all around. I've had it about a month, but didn't shave the sides bald right away. Then I just did it. I got a total mohawk," said freshman Mike Bender. 
Unique haircuts abound on the campus this year, ranging from long spikes to virtually no hair at all. It is no longer unusual to see flattops, mohawks and brushcuts in the dining halls. And with the warm weather, the shorter cuts will probably become even more popular. But this hasn't always been the case. 
"Last year this haircut was a lot less common," said sophomore John Keegan, whose flattop is modelled after basketball player Matt Beeuwsaert. 
Freshman Paul Bentinger, whose hair now resembles that of musi­cian Charlie Sexton agreed, saying "I noticed that a lot of people are getting a bit more risque. At first

It took The Snackers 84 shots to put away Chief Big Head and the Baals, 21-14. Pat Collins and Tom McHugh took the most shots, best-of-five semifinal opener tomorrow night at Edmonton. Best-of-five divisional semifinals also will begin tomorrow night in the Norris, the Adams and the Patrick divisions.

shooting 4-of-21 and 2-of-18, respectively. 
"Fatigue and a basic lack of basketball skills played a large part in our performance," said McHugh. "But we'd like to thank our fans and also the other team for serving us Bloody Mary's at the halftime. It gave us 3 needed lift." 
The drinks seemed to help Mark Howell the most, as he shot 5-of-10 to lead The Snackers. Chris Mc­Clean scored nine for the lsoers.

Indiana beats track team 
Receiving corps keeps improving 
Special to The Observer meters. Brennan's time of 54.8 
The Notre Dame track team dropped a close match to In­diana, 77-74, as the squad's dual-meet season got underway. Although the loss was tough to take, Irish head coach Joe Piane was happy with his team's show­ing. 
"It was a good meet and on the whole the kids performed well," said Piane. "I was surpris­ed to see Tony Ragunas win the 100 meters and i hadn't expected Mike Brennan's second place in the intermediate hurdles." 
Ragunas won the 100 with a time of 11.01, just .03 of a se­cond ahead of the Hoosiers' Albert Robertson. Ragunas also finished second in the 200

By MARTY BURNS 
Assistant Sports Editor 

Notre Dame defensive players might not believe it, but flanker Tim Brown is not always in a big hurry. 
Just because Brown has cut and slashed his way with abandon through the defense over the spring practice season does not mean he's counting the days until the fall season. On the contrary, Brown seems to be enjoying himself im­mensely as he leads an experienced and talented group of Irish recievers that has looked solid throughout the spring sessions. 
"Things have been going really well and I'm just having fun out here," said Brown after yesterday's practice. "It's not like the real thing because we're only playing against ourselves, but I like the practices . I've certainly been learning a lot, especially out of the backfield." 
Brown himself, though, has taken more than one opposing defender to school when he lines up in the wishbone., Thischange,along with the changes in coaching staff, have not served to slow the sophomore speedster but rather to add fuel to his competative fires. 
"It's different running from the 
backfield but I like carrying the ball 
so I can't complain," said Brown. 
"It's also a new situation for the 
simple fact that we have a new

Brown," said Holtz. "His work habits have been outstanding!' 
"He's a sujper athlete," agreed Cordelli. "He came in here ready to play. Like everyone else he has some things to improlve, but he has .. been great." 

Tim Brown 

Brown's consistent and frequent­ly dazzling play is not the only reason, however, that observers are tabbing the Notre Dame receiving corps as one of the nation's best. Much of the respect accored to the unit will fall on veterans Milt Jackson, Reggis Ward, Alvin Miller and Tony Eason. 
Although split ends Jackson and Miller both missed last season with injuries, the two potential stars have shown enough in the workouts to allay most fears. Miller has been slowed a bit in his recovery by an experimental trial at tight end and by a minor toe affliction which

But the team came back strong against some stiff competition on Saturday when it hosted Michigan State and won 5-3. The Spartans challenged the Irish in some singles matches, but were overcome by the aggressive doubles play of Susie kept him out of yesterday's prac­tice, but Jackson has continued to progress. 
"Milt Jackson has been a great addition to the team," said Cor­delli. "He's doing very well as a player, and he's also been a real leader for the team." 
Along with flankers Brown and Ward, and split ends Jackson, Miller and Eason, freshman Ray Dumas, Steve Alaniz and walk-on Brad Alge also are receiving a good look from the Irish coaching staff. 
While this unit has looked im­pressive for the most part in runn­ing patterns and hanging onto the football, Cordellis stresses that is is in other areas where improvement must come. 
"We're a long way from midseason form," said the first­year coach. "In an area such as run­blocking, we're not quite there. To get better we'll need more strength, more intensity, and we'll have to improve our concentration. If you don't have those, you get the men­tal mistakes. 
"But this is a talented group. They're all good athletes with good awareness and good instincts. They are going to do some good things." EXTRA POINTS Besides Miller's injury, the Irish were without the services yesterday of Joel Williams, Matt Dingens and Shawn Heffern because of minor ailments. 
Panther and Michelle Dasso and the duo of Mary Colligan and Izzy O'Brien. The third match of doubles was suspended due to rain. Senior Colligan, sophomore Dasso and senior O'Brien also captured the second, third and fourth singles respectively. 
Notre Dame continued its domination Sunday, when the Irish downed Eastern Michigan 6-3. It was a pleasant finish to a grueling weekend of tennis. 
"It finally all came together," says Gelfman. "The aggressiveness of our doubles teams was the key. Our number-one team of Panther­Dasso had the most aggressive match I've seen in a long time, and the number-two team of Colligan­O'Brien is like a rock for me. I can always count on them." 
Gelfman also was pleased with the play of the third doubles team consisting of junior JoAnne Biafore and freshman Natalie Illig. According to the coach, the couple has finally pulled it all together and used effective net play to outlast their Eastern Michigan opponents 2-6, 6-2, 6-3. 
The team now has a week layoff until it takes to the road to meet Western Michigan (April15), Ohio State (April 19) and Miami of Ohio (April20). 
"These next matches will be barn burners," adds Gelfman. "Nothing will be easy from here on out. But if we maintain the aggressive play and momentum we had this weekend, we should meet with positive results."

Brokaw still stands 29th on Notre Dame's all-time scoring list with 1,001 points in 58 games for a 
17.3 average. 

He is perhaps best remembered, though, for scoring 25 points to lead the Irish in Notre Dame's 71­70 upset of UCLA in 1974 to end the 88-game winning streak of the 
Bruins. 

A native of Brunswick, N.J., Brokaw played five years in the NBA with Milwaukee, Cleveland 
and Buffalo. 

Irish freshman guard Mark Stevenson was surprised last night to find out that Brokaw was leaving Notre Dame. He had looked for-

"He's going to be missed a great deal next year," said Stevenson. "I really like him a lot. He talked to me when things were going bad for me this season. He understood the things I was going through, having played for Coach Phelps himself. 
"It's kind of saddening for me to see him leave, and I'm sure the rest of the fellas feel the same way, but it's a great opportunity for him. I think he really deserves a head coaching job." 
Brokaw, who earned his bachelor's degree in sociology from Notre Dame in 1980, should have a good amount of job security at lona. The New Rochelle, N.Y., school maintains a policy of not fir­ing its coaches, whatever the sport.

Men's tennis team splits matches 
By RICK RIETBROCK 
.Sports Writer 

Notre Dame had a busy tennis weekend which saw it add a win and a loss to its record, while ad­ding more experience which should prove very valuable to the develop­ment of Tom Fallon's young squad. 
On Saturday, the Irish had to battle not only Western Michigan but the elements as well. After two singles matches, the action had to be moved indoors to the ACC courts, but the change in environ­ment did not affect the Irish, as they thumped Western Michigan, 9-0. 
Fallon expressed great pleasure with his team's performance while pointing out that the score was a bit deceptive. 
"I thought we just played excep­tionally well," Fallon said. "Any time you beat a team as good as Western Michigan 9-0, you've real­ly accomplished something.' 
"We won some very close mat­ches, so the score seems a little wider than it really was. It looks like a blowout, but it really wasn't." 
Setting the tone for the Irish right off the bat was sophomore Dan Walsh, who recovered from an opening set loss to defeat Mike Kiewiet 4-6, 6-1, 6-4. The freshman parade took over at this point, as Brian Kalbas (6-4, 7-6), Tim Carr (7-5, 6-2), Tony Cahill (6-0, 6-0), and Dave Reiter (6-2, 6-2) registered victories before senior Joe Nelligan capped the singles competition with a 6-2, 6-1 trium­ph. 
The number-one doubles team of 
Walsh and Paul Daggas clawed its 
way to a 6-7, 6-3, 7-6 victory. Carr 
and Reiter teamed for a 3-6, 6-3, 6­
1 win, while Cahill and Nelligan 
combined for a 7-5, 7-6 victory. 
Sunday, the Irish got a little more badger than they could han-

die, however, and dropped a 7-2 match to Wisconsin. Despite the loss, Fallon said his team had once again performed well. 
"I thought Wisconsin played an outstanding match," the Irish men­tor said. "We played pretty well ourselves, but they just did a little more. They are playing excellent tennis right now. They just beat Ohio State 5-4, and Ohio State is recognized as one of the top teams around so we have nothing to be ashamed of." 
Walsh lost the number-one singles match, 2-6, 7-5, despite playing well, especially in the se­cond set, according to Fallon. Kalbas and Carr also lost before Cahill got the Irish in the winner's column with a 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 win. Reiter followed with a 6-2, 7-5 vic­tory, but then Joe Nelligan dropped a very tough decision, 6-0, 2-6, 7-6. 
Wisconsin swept the doubles matches, including a particularly grueling 6-7, 7-5, 6-4 win by Tim Madden and Jim Schnider over Notre Dame's team of Cahill and Nelligan.

Fallon said the loss to Wisconsin is, by no means, a discouraging one. 
"We played well, but small things were big," he said. "Walsh played well but he couldn't get over the hump and the number-six match (Nelligan and Schnider) w:1s a dif­ficult one to lose. 
"It's just a case of experience, and we have to go through these losses and hope they help us later on." 
Next up for the Irish is Ball State today. According to Fallon, that match will by anything but a picnic. 
"Ball State beat Wisconsin early in the year, 8-1, so that gives an in­dication of the type of team we will be facing," Fallon said. "(Wiscon­sin's) coach told me that his guys weren't playing well then, but Ball State is definitely a top-notch oppo­nent. There's no place for us to hide from teams like Ball State, Indiana State and Ohio State that are com­ing up." 
The Irish are now 12-6 for the season. Game time for Ball State today is 3 p.m. at the Courtney Tennis Courts.
