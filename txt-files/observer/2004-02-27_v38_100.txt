By DUSTIN VON HANDORF News Writer 

The Filipino American Student Organization (FASO) will be sponsoring Fiestang Saturday, showcasing Filipino culture, and includ­ing traditional dancing and dinner in Stepan Center. 
Charlene Vinalon, co-pres­ident of FASO, said the event will include elements of both 
traditional  and  modern  
Filipino culture.  
"Fiestang  will  share  

Filipino culture, traditional food and dance, with a mod­ern twist," Vinalon said. 
The evening will start with an authentic Filipino dinner, 
· serving dishes such as adobo, a chicken dish, lumpia, which is a traditional wrap similar 
to an egg roll, pa.ncit, a noo­dle dish and a pork dish called lechon. 
"Filipinos are very big on food, and it's a great time to share what we love," Vinalon said. 
The evening will continue with a prese-ntation of vari­
ous  traditional dance  num­ 
bers.  
Eileen Magno. also a  FASO  

co-president, said the event will include numerous types of dances influenced by a variety of cultural groups. 
"It will include Pinkling, our national dance, Maglalatik, an all-guys coconut dance, and the Binasuan, a candle dance," Magno said.

Quill to design commemorative coins 
By JOE TROMBELLO Assistant News Editor 
Senior marketing and art studio major Pat Quill picked the right day to read The Washington Post. 
One day before the Jan. 9 deadline, Quill said he noticed an advertisement calling for student artists to apply for positions with the United States Mint to design some of the state quarters. 
Quill joins five other student artists from around the nation as Associate Designers, who, along with 18 Master Designers -all professional -will develop future coin designs. 
"I read the article, and it was emphasizing people who were focused on detailed work, and that's what I love to do," he said. "Drawing is my first love."

ND students observe leap year birthdays 
20-year old sophomores Kathryn Lindsey, Mike Doversberger celebrate fifth birthday 
By LAURA VILIM 
News Writer 
For people born on Feb. 29, yearly birthday celebrations are far from an easy annual routine. 
Notre Dame sophomores Kathryn Lindsey and Mike Doversberger are two such leap year babies. They will both be celebrating their 20th birthday {or 5th in Leap Years) this Feb. 29. Despite the unorthodox nature of their birthdays, however, they do not feel as though they have missed out on years of celebra­tions. They said they consider themselves lucky to be among the estimated one out of 1 ,506 people around the world ­approximately 200,000 in the United States -who were born on such a special day.

Mass forges friendships, community inhalls 
Editor's Note: This is the sec­ond of a two-part series exploring Mass at Notre Dame. 
By AMANDA MICHAELS News Writer 
Father Paul Doyle likes milk­shakes. He's so fond of them, in fact. that when he became rector of Dillon Hall in 1997, he bought a one-beater com­mercial "drink mixer" and began serving milkshak.es to students who attended Father Mike Baxter's Thursday night mass in Dillon Chapel. Six years later, he's serving up 13 gallons of milk and ice cream to crowds that sometimes grow to 190 strong -almost unheard of for a weeknight liturgy. 
Dillon's famous "Milkshake Mass" is just one of many sto­ries in the long tradition that surrounds Notre Dame's unique dorm-worship system. · 
While priests-in-residence at other Catholic institutions, such as Boston College and Georgetown, occasionally hold Masses in their rooms, the concept of having an active chapel in each individual resi­dence hall is distinctively Notre Dame's. 
"Dorm Masses are a very special Notre Dame phenome­non," said Father Richard Warner, director of campus

INSIDE COLUMN 
End of the road 

I've been asked, over and over again, how The Observer comes out five days a week when we all have classes. I've also been asked why I traded most of my social life for endless hours in 
the basement of South Dining Hall. Each time, I give the same answer. 
I don't know. 
Somehow, every day a newspaper 

appears in bins Andrew Soukup across campus. The last 140 issues have hap-Editor in chief pened to have my name at the top of the mast­head (today will be the last one), but The Observer is a product of over 100 students who give up some portion of their day to ensure that Notre Dame has a campus newspaper. Why they do it, I don't know, but I'm grateful that they do it nonetheless. 
Directing The Observer over the last year has been a tremendous challenge. And I've been blessed to work with an incredibly talented staff who is just as devoted to their jobs as I am to mine. 
But when I'm cursing out a print­er that won't print at 5 a.m. or responding to deranged e-mails from angry readers, I sometimes scratch my head and wonder if it's. worth it. 
Then I walk into the dining hall to go to work, and I see the stacks of papers almost depleted. I sit down for lunch at the dining hall and see everyone reading the story that took three hours to edit. I walk down the halls in dorms and see articles taped up outside the doors. I listen to professors in class start discussions by holding up a; copy of The Observer. 
And that's when I remember why I love this job. And why I'm going to have a tough time saying good­bye. 
Today is officially my last day at The Observer, but I've never been more proud of the product we turn out every day. I've had the pleasure of leading a talented staff that poured their hearts and souls into their jobs, of watching them mature, of seeing them grudgingly admit that the late nights in the office aren't that bad. And I've had one heck of a fun time working with them in the process. 
When I was named editor in chief 13 months ago, one of my prede­cessors sent me an e-mail saying my final day on the job would be my toughest. I didn't know what he was trying to tell me, not on the days when I dealt with irate phone calls or fought losing battles with faulty computer systems. But tomorrow, somebody else gets the honor of leading The Observer's staff. 
That's why, today, I understand what he meant.

Trash truck stopped with 2 tons of marijuana 
SIERRA VISTA, Ariz. -A garbage truck was stopped carrying more than two tons of marijuana north of Huachuca City, a Department of Public Safety official said. 
The truck had been driv­ing erratically late Tuesday, said DPS Sgt. Steve Tritz. 
"It got my attention," Tritz said. "He was driving slow and failing to signal." 
The driver, who identi­fied himself as 28-year-old Brian Rivera Martinez, said he didn't know how to drive the truck. 
When a drug-sniffing dog arrived, it alerted authori­ties to possible narcotics. DPS officers found 4,112 pounds of marijuana bun­dled in the area where trash would be carried. 
Martinez and passenger, Michael Trejo Duran Sr., 38, were arrested on suspi­cion of transporting and possessing marijuana for sale. 
Driver calls 911 as cops chase him 
MARYVILLE, Tenn.-It may be right to call 911 to report someone's chasing you on the highway -but not if it's a sheritrs deputy in pursuit. 
Kevin Richard Vowell, 31, of Maryville placed such a call to emergency dispatchers during a high speed chase on U.S. 411 early Sunday morning, Blount County, sheriff's spokeswoman Marian O'Briant said. 
The incident began when a deputy noticed Vowell driving erratically and sig­naled for him to stop. Vowell pulled over but then spun his pickup truck around and fled down the highway, with three patrol cars in pursuit.

Dining halls go meatless for Lenten season 
By JEN ROWLING 
News Writer 
Ash Wednesday marked the beginning of Lent and the end of meat on Fridays, as the University's dining halls replaced sauteed meat, stir-fry and rotisserie chicken with items such as eggs, fish and grilled vegetables. 
Notre Dame's staff began preparation for the Lenten Season in October. Tony Williams, South Dining Hall unit chef. attended a culinary academy in New York, where he learned preparation for var­ious vegetable medleys, corn­breads and tofu. These new platters are being prepared and will be served in the dining halls to replace meat dishes. 
Williams said the meals being served will include cheese dishes, fish, vegetables, grilled pizzas and breakfast items such as eggs and hash browns. In addition, the popu­lar mozzarella breadsticks will be seen more often. 
Williams said students should be creative with their food selections, suggesting stir-fry, a collection of vegetables or tofu" and saying that chefs are will­ing to fry or help with any new platter creations. 
"By the third meal, you're grumpy," he said. "People will go off campus," 
Williams suggested that stu­dents give the. dining hall staff feedback on meals they enjoyed by filling out surveys. He said student input is valued and shared at weekly Food Services meetings. 
While students will face a more limited food selection during Lenten Fridays, Williams said they can look for­ward to Easter dinner at South Dining Hall, which will feature lamb, chicken, fish, baked ham, rice pilaf and vegetable medley. 
While the dining halls will be meatless, Reekers and Lafortune will continue to carry their regular products. 
Notre Dame's close adher­ence to the Catholic Church 
policies has created divergent viewpoints within the student body. 
"If you are Catholic, you can choose not to eat meat; they can at least put smaller por­tions of meat out for those who do not choose to fast," sopho­more Kate Lorenz said. 
Sophomore Craig Brede said he supports the Notre Dame food policy of not serving meat. 

"People choose to come here, so when you choose this school, you're pretty much choosing to accept some Catholic practices," Brede said.

SMCholds Sophomore Parents Weekend 
By EMILIE DESJARDINES 
News Writer 
The Saint Mary's campus will 
host 360 parents this weekend 
for Sophomore Parents 
Weekend. 
The theme for this year's 
event, "Like You Forever, Love 
You For Always," was inspired 
by the children's book with the 
same title. 
"It appealed to us because the 
book is about the relationship 
between parents and children," 
said Jessica Eaton, a 
Sophomore Parents Weekend 
committee member. 
Although many of the sched­
uled activities are similar to 
those of Notre Dame's Junior 
Parents Weekend, the Saint 
Mary's event is somewhat small­
er, confined mostly to Saturday. 
Saint Mary's combines the 
Presidential Dinner with a 
dance and does not have a clos­
ing brunch on Sunday. 
However, Saint Mary's students 
"also have Junior Mom's 
Weekend and Senior Dad's 
\Veekend, which are both three­
day events," said Kristin 
Palombo, the committee's chair­
woman. 
"I think this weekend will be 
fun," Palombo said. "It's a great 
way to involve families and an 
opportunity for parents to see 
what your life is like away from 
home." 
The three-member committee 
has been working hard since 
last fall to ensure a successful 
event. The activities will com­
mence today, when students are 
encouraged to take their par­
ents to Dalloway's, an on-cam­
pus cafe, for dinner with the 
"Dalloway's Dollars" they will 
receive. 
Saturday morning will begin 
with an academic ppen house in 
the Noble Family Dining Hall 
where students will have the 
opportunity to introduce their 
parents to professors. 
During the afternoon, the 
South Bend Chocolate Factory, 
which usually closes by 2 p.m., 
is staying open for tours. 
"I think it will be fun," Palombo said. "The assembly lines will be open, and there will be samples of chocolate." 
At 4:30 p.m., parents and their daughters can celebrate Mass in the Church of Loretto. 
Saturday evening is the Dinner/Dance, held at the Palais Royale. It will start with a pres­idential welcome followed by a slideshow. The slides, arranged by Maureen Zimmer, "jnclude pictures of life at Saint Mary's and pictures with parents," Zimmer said, "in order to show a little about their lives over the past two years and include their lives at home." 
The weekend will culminate with a night of dinner and danc­ing, an event about which Eaton said she is very enthusiastic. 
"We picked out the menu, and I think it will be delicious," she said. ''I'm looking forward to spending time with my parents and letting them meet my friends."

Mass 
continued from page 1 
ministry and rector of Fisher Hall. "To build a space for wor­ship into every residence hall is a strong statement about the nature of our community of faith." 
Sixty-eight Masses are cele­brated each week in the dorms alone -more during football season -with an average of five per week in the male resi­dence halls and two in the female residence halls. The disparity is mainly due to the fact that men's dorms have up to three or four priests-in-resi­dence, while only four women's dorms are set up as such, Warner said. 
Voicing a sentiment common across campus, McGlinn rector Beth Maureen Skinner said having weekly liturgies in every residence hall strength­ens the bonds within that small community. 
"The fact that we have Mass in the dorm is a value that makes this living situation dif­ferent than just sharing a dorm space," Skinner said. "That people pray together -that Mass can be a part of the total dorm experience -adds an element that is intangible and sacred. If Mass weren't offered in the dorm, it would change its atmosphere completely." 
Father George Rozum, Alumni rector, agreed, adding that the Masses are essential to the preservation of the unique Notre Dame experience. 
"Without dorm Masses, we wouldn't have a spirit of Christian fellowship. We wouldn't have Christian morals brought to our attention," Rozum said. "The Basilica only holds a thousand or so people, so where would everyone go? If we didn't have Masses in the . dorms, we might as well be Northwestern." 
Despite the enthusiasm for the hall worship and the efforts of individual dorms to encour­
age participation  - like Dillon  
and  Carroll's  milkshake  
Masses,  and  St.  Edward's  

Spanish Mass -attendance at some weeknight liturgies can drop below the double digits. 
Rozum defended the daily Masses, despite small num­
bers. 
"What does it mat­ter if we have, at most, a dozen or so? We can still pray," he said. "You have got to pray every day if you're going to be a Christian." 
Agreeing with Rozum, Skinner also said that even though only 25 to 40 percent of the girls wherever they believe that their faith will be best nour­ished," Rocca said. "The more informal style of liturgy in the dorms, obviously, is quite dif­ferent from the more formal Basilica setting. Also, the music can be quite different between what you hear in the Basilica and in a dorm." 
Many students also praise the residence hall Masses, especially the accessibility and 
"The fact that we have Mass in the dorm is a value that makes this living situation different than just sharing a dorm space. That people pray together-that Mass can be a part ofthe total dorm experience-adds an element that is intangible and sacred. ·· 
Beth Maureen Skinner McGlinn Rector 

in McGlinn go to the hall's Mass, a large number find their way to one of the liturgies on campus. 
"One hundred percent partic­ipation is unrealistic," she said. "Many of our girls are in one of the choirs and participate in the Mass in the Basilica, or some don't want to go to Mass at 10 at night because it's their best study time, so they find a different place to go." 
Basilica rector Father Peter Rocca supported the presence of dorm Masses, saying that while the Basilica plays a cen­tral role in the community, worship within the residence halls fills a different yet equal­ly essential place in students' lives. 
"I believe students should go variety of options they pro­vide. 
"It's conven­ient, and everyone from my d o r m goes," Knott freshman C h r i s Rainville s a i d . "And if I miss my dorm's Mass, there's usually 
another one I can make it to." 
Badin senior Alice Bartek cited the intimacy of the dorm chapels and the sense of com­munity they inspire. 
"When you go to the Basilica for Mass, you get all dressed up and the choir sings and it's just a huge deal," she said. "In dorm Masses, you can get on a personal, intimate level with those around you and with God." 
Though each dorm is autonomous in deciding when and how they celebrate Mass -milkshakes or no -all 27 together form a unique net­work of faith within the Notre Dame community.

Britain spied on U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in the build up to the Iraq war, a for­mer Cabinet minister said Thursday, triggering yet another postwar crisis for Prime Minister Tony Blair. 
Blair refused to confirm or deny the accusa­tion and branded his former international development secretary, Clare Short, "deeply irresponsible" for commenting on the issues. 
For Blair, the allegation is another potential­ly damaging aftershock of the Iraq invasion, following controversies over Britain's prewar intelligence dossiers, the death of a weapons scientist, the coalition's failure to find weapons of mass destruction and the collapse of a court case on alleged U.S.-British bugging of the United Nations.

PORT-AU-PRINCE Haiti's rebel leader said his fighters were advancing on the capital Thursday and awaited an order to attack unless President Jean­Bertrand Aristide resigns. The United States ques­tioned whether Aristide could "effectively continue" in office. 
With Haiti's ill-equipped police force not expected to put up much resistence against a rebel assault, goverment loyalists threat­ening death and torchings began building defenses in front of the National Palace in Port-au-Prince. 
At a U.N. Security Council meeting on Haiti, Caribbean nations urged the immediate authoriza­tion of a multinational force to end the violence and restore law and order. But key council members the United States and France said they want a political settlement first. 
In Washington, Secretary of State Colin Powell openly questioned whether Aristide can continue to serve effectively as Haiti's leader -the closest Powell has come to suggesting that Aristide bow out as president before his elected 
term  ends in  February  
20006.  
"Whether or  not he is  

able to effectively continue as president is something he will have to examine carefully in the interests of the Haitian people," Powell told reporters. 
Powell's comments came a day after French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin condemned Aristide for Haiti's crisis and called for him to resign. 
Earlier Thursday, Aristide told CNN he would not resign. He said a small international force -"a couple of dozen" soldiers or police -could prompt the rebels to stand down. Referring to the rebels, he said: "At any time those terrorists may come to Port-au-Prince and kill thousands of people." 

The insurgents have overrun half of the country since the rebellion began three weeks ago. 
Hundreds of Aristide sup­porters, some armed with machetes and pistols, gath­ered Thursday in front of the National Palace and, with teenagers driving bulldozers and forklifts, started building a defensive rampart. 
"If Aristide goes, cut off their heads and burn down their houses!" they shout­ed, echoing the war cry of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the Haitian general who ousted French colonizers from Haiti to end slavery 200 years ago. The Aristide loyalists shouted epithets against France. 
As rumors spread that the rebels were arriving by boat, truckloads of Aristide supporters armed with old pistols were seen heading toward the seaside Carrefour neighborhood. 
In Carrefour, gunmen fired shots at the home of Haiti's most prominent architect, Albert Mangones, and wounded a security guard, a family member said. The French Embassy was calling the police to try to evacuate Mangones' widow, an eld­erly French citizen, and their daughter. 
Rebel leader Guy Philippe said the pro­Aristide militants, called chimeres or angry young men, were not his enemies. 
"We are calling for every­body to stay home, not to fight against us because we are fighting for them," Philippe said in an inter­view with The Associated Press in the northern city of Cap-Haitien. 
"All those chimeres, we have nothing against them," he said. "We know Mr. Aristide gave them some money and we know how poor they are." 
Some 90 miles to the south, Port-au-Prince was a city on edge. 
Americans with M-16s guarded U.N. workers and their families on the way to the airport, passing street barricades of wrecked, abandoned cars, rock and tires built by Aristide sup­porters to block the city from an assault. 
Military helicopters of the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, were ferrying people fro~ the Dominican Embassy to the airport. 
Senate approves handgun safety lock 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A Senate agree­ment requiring child safety locks on 
U.S. handguns gave Democrats encouragement Thursday that renewing an assault weapons ban might also become part of a package to protect gun makers and sellers from gun crime lawsuits. 
The GOP-controlled Senate voted 70-27 to require all handguns sold in the United States to have child safety locks, adding the measure to the leg­islation providing the gun industry immunity from suits when a legally sold gun is subsequently used in a crime. 
Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer of California and Herb Kohl of Wisconsin argued that requiring child safety locks on newly pur­chased handguns would help reduce the number of children accidentally killed by handguns in the home. Every 48 hours, a child is killed through an accidental shooting, Boxer said. 
"If we were to pass this legislation and it became the law of the land, the number of children involved in the number of accidental shootings would go way down," she said. 
Kohl said the bill "is not a panacea. It will not prevent every single avoid­able firearm-related accident. But the fact is that all parents want to protect their children.· This legisla­tion will ensure that people purchase child-safety locks when they buy guns. Those who buy locks are more likely to use them. That much we know is certain." 
The Senate in 1999 passed similar legislation but the House refused to approve the measure. 
Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, the sponsor of the gunmaker immunity legislation, argued against the meas­ure, saying gun manufacturers already are working on the problem. Craig said the amendment would be an intrusion of the federal govern­ment into people's private homes.

Debate team encourages support at weekend tournament 
By K. AARON VAN 
OOSTERHOUT 
News Wricer 
The Notre Dame debate team is inviting any and all students to heckle, cheer or simply observe the upcoming "Irish Invitational" this weekend. 
Starting Saturday at noon and continuing until Sunday after­noon, the team is hosting the largest Midwest invitational of the spring semester, bringing 16 schools to engage in parliamen­tary-style debate at DeBartolo 



Leap year

when he realized his birthday was celebrated differently from his friends, he has been aware of the uniqueness of his leap year birthday for as long as he can remember. Rather than believing his birthday loses sig­nificance as because he can only celebrate it on its exact day once every four years, Doversberger thinks that it becomes more special because of its rareness. 
"Unlike a typical yearly birthday, when I explain to people when I was born and how I go about celebrating my birthday, they remember it. As a result, I think it gains signifi­cance because it is unique," he said. 
Lindsey agreed with Doversberger, saying that leap year birthdays are more excit­ing to celebrate because they happen so infrequently. She first learned that her Feb. 29 birthday was special when she and her family celebrated her first "real" birthday when she turned four. Instead of being disappointed in what appeared to be a lack of actual birth­days, Lindsey found humor in her situation. 
"I thought it was funny," Lindsey said. "Of all the years, months, days and times to be born, I was born on a leap year. [It's] the story of my life." 
In non-leap years, both Doversberger and Lindsey cel­ebrate their birthday on March 1, as they were born on the

dent clubs on campus to per­form, including the First Class Steppers and the Ballet Folklorico. 
"We are aiming to show­case Filipino culture and cel­ebrate it with the Notre Dame and South Bend com­munities," Magno said. 
Vinalo said FASO, a student organization that is dedicat­ed to "sharing culture and building a Filipino communi­ty on campus," hopes to raise awareness of the Filipino culture by hosting the event. 
The event will take begin at 6 p.m. Saturday. Dinner will be served at 6:30 p.m., and the dance show will start at 7:30p.m. 
Tickets will be available at the door, costing $5 for fac­ulty and students, and $7 for general admission.

Hall. 
"Crowds are definitely encour­aged," team president Meghan Callahan-Peters. "There's heck­ling involved, and you can shame people." 
This is the second invitational in as many years Notre Dame has hosted. The number of schools attending has doubled, this year including such institu­tions as Indiana University, Hillsdale College, Purdue University and the University of South Carolina. 
"[Hosting] elevates a school's prestige. The program as a whole gets a boost," Callahan said. "It brings more involvement from the Notre Dame communi­
ty." 
As tournament director, team coach Kate Huetteman sent out invitations to each school, peti­tioned alumni to judge for the tournament and .selected the "resolutions" for the debates. 
Resolutions, or debate topics, come primarily from the political realm, ranging from internation­al relations to domestic politics. Past topics include Bush's policy on Iraq both before and after the war. 
"You usually have to be more up to date as well as just have a wider knowledge base, because you never know what the topic is going to be," Callahan said. 
On the other hand, policy debate demands more facts and evidence to be successful. 
"[Parliamentary debate] defi­nitely teaches you how to think on your feet," Callahan said. "Even ifyou don't know an exact fact about a topic, you can come 'up with a logical problem with it." 
Already a formidable opponent in debate circles, the team fin­ished eighth last year in the National Parliamentary Debate Association's season-long sweep­stakes. "Sweepstakes awards" are given only to the top schools at any particular tournament. 
According to Callahan, the Notre Dame team is one of the best in the nation. This coming weekend still looms large, how­ever, and "there's definitely more pressure" to perform well at home, Callahan said. "It should be a good tournament."

60th day of the year. While nei­ther one has specific traditions for the day, each one cele­brates with a little more fan­fare when Feb. 29 rolls around every four years. 
"Someone usually gives me a 'you're turning three, four or five years old' card," Lindsey said. "They also Uokingly] tell me I'm tall or smart for my age." 
Over the years, both students have also found other perks to being a birthday-celebrity of sorts. Doversberger has appeared in a local newspaper or on television every real birthday of his life and has received free $25 gift certifi­cates from the University Park Mall in Mishawaka. 
Although Lindsey has not received any special treatment as of late, when she was younger she often won extra prizes at fairs or in games. Recently, her birthday has been of more use to friends and family who have tried to utilize it to win free items of their own. 

Perhaps one of the greatest benefits Doversberger and Lindsey gained due to their leap year birthdays is the fact that it sets them apart from the multitude of other students at Notre Dame. 
"[Another] great thing about being born on a leap year is that I will always be able to tell people I was a student at the University of Notre Dame before my fifth birthday," said Doversberger.

IN BRIEF 
Justice Dept. blocks Oracle takeover SAN FRANCISCO -The U.S. Justice Department sued Thursday to block Oracle Corp.'s hostile $9.4 billion bid for rival business software maker PeopleSoft Inc., raising the like­lihood the proposed shotgun marriage won't 
happen. 
Seven states joined the Justice Department in a lawsuit that contends a combination between Oracle and PeopleSoft would stifle competition in the $20 billion market for business applica­tions software -the computer coding that auto­mates a wide range of administrative tasks. 
The antitrust challenge represents a major blow to Oracle, which has been stalking its rival for nearly nine months, and a coup for PeopleSoft, which rallied its customers to help persuade the Justice Department to derail the deal. 
Redwood Shores-based Oracle could still win · the antitrust battle in court, but that fight could last for months, and time isn't on Oracle's side. Oracle is trying to seize control of PeopleSoft's board of directors in a shareholder vote sched­uled March 25. 
Wall Street remains unchanged 
NEW YORK-Wall Street stumbled through a mostly lifeless session Thursday as bargain hunters gave technology stocks a moderate lift but struggling defense contractors kept blue chips under pressure. 
A Commerce Department report th'at orders for big-ticket items from factories fell by 1.8 percent in January limited investors' enthusi­asm, but analysts were not concerned that this presaged a steeper decline. While the indexes have registered losses in five of the last six ses­sions, the market has shown great resiliency .. 
"I don't think the numbers are so out of whack. But it's giving more cause to take some profits," Carl said. 
"We've had a fine run-up, we're not seeing crazy swings, so [the market's] handling every­thing well. I don't see anything horrible on the horizon now.'' The Dow Jones industrial average lost 21.48, or 0.2 percent, to 10,580.14, after advancing 35.25 Wednesday.

Dollar pushes higher against euro 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -The dollar extended its broad-based gains Thursday amid growing concern that the European Central Bank may lower interest rates to subvert the strength of the euro. 
The dollar rose to its highest level in nearly three months at 
109.82 yen and a one-month peak against the Swiss franc of 1.2711 francs. The euro also· sank as far as $1.2386, a level not seen since the beginning of January. 
Investor uncertainty about offi­cial European resolve to keep the euro from renewing a push toward all-time highs reached last week above $1.29 has led to increasingly volatile swings in the foreign­exchange market. 
Disappointing January durable goods and weekly initial claims for unemployment benefits data out of the U.S. resulted in a swing of nearly a cent in the euro against the dollar before the market set­tled back into the middle of its overnight ranges. 
In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.2439 cents, down from $1.2495 late Wednesday. The dollar was quoted at 109.63 yen, up from 109.02 yen late Wednesday. It was also quoted at 1.2677 Swiss francs, up from 1.2600, and 1.3416 Canadian dol­lars, up from 1.3345. The British pound fell to $1.8608 from $1.8713. 
The dollar has surged about 4 percent against the euro and yen over the past week, sending many investors to the sidelines ahead of the ECB's monetary policy meeting next Thursday. 
Most economists expect ECB to keep its main target rate at the current 2 percent level at its policy meeting next week, but European leaders have increased pressure on the central bank to act on the euro, saying the currency's strength is hurting exports from the region. 
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who is expected to bring up foreign-exchange policy when he visits with President Bush on Friday, has urged the ECB to consider using monetary policy as a tool against the currency. 
"Major imbalances in the global economy and fluctuations in exchange rates give us cause for serious concerns," Schroeder said Thursday in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in Chicago. 
French Prime Minister Jean­Pierre Raffarin said he shared Schroeder's view on rates, citing the "brutal nature" of the euro's rise. 
"This indicates that there is some consensus between not only the ECB but also finance ministers that verbal intervention is the first line of defense," said Michael Woolfolk. senior currency strategist at Bank of New York. 
"I expect the Europeans to follow through with continued verbal intervention, as it appears to be working for the time being.'' 
Euro-zone data on inflation and economic sentiment due out Friday could shed some light on whether the ECB will consider a rate cut. and some market participants are expecting the numbers to disap­point.

Abuse study concludes 4 percent of priests accused 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A national, church-sanctioned study docu­menting sex abuse by U.S. Roman Catholic clergy found that about 4 percent of clerics have been accused of molesting minors since 1950, a diocese said Thursday. 
The Diocese of Yakima, Wash., said in a news release that the survey compiled by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice found 4,392 of the 109,694 clergy who served over that five-decade period faced allegations of abuse. 
The survey was overseen by the National Review Board, a lay watchdog panel the bishops formed at the height of the abuse crisis. The review board had a Friday morning news conference scheduled in Washingtoll to discuss the report and a companion study on how the abuse crisis devel­oped. 
Dioceses nationwide received 10,667 abuse claims since 1950, according to the news release. Of those, claims by 6,700 were substantiated. About 3,300 were not investi-· gated because the accused cler­gymen were dead. 
Another 1,000 or so claims proved to be unsubstantiated, the diocese said. 
The national report also tal­lied abuse-related costs at $533.4 million. 
A source who has read both the John Jay tally of abuse cases and the report on causes provided some other findings to the AP on condition of anonymity. 
The causes report places much of the blame on bishops, saying "moral laxity" in disci­plining offenders created an atmosphere that allowed the crisis to occur. 
The report acknowledges that some bishops recognized the gravity of the problem early on and spent years lobbying the Vatican to change church law so they could move faster against abusers. 
The study also said the bish­ops were sometimes ill-served by the therapists and lawyers they sought out for guidance. 
Still. there have been wide­spread reports of bishops who sheltered abusers and the review board used harsh lan­guage to criticize churchmen who failed to act. It said these bishops were guilty of "neglect" and insensitivity toward victims that allowed the "smoke of Satan" to enter the church, the source said. 
The raw numbers of abuse claims and accused clergy are higher than previously estimat­ed by the media, victims groups and church officials. 
Estimates of the number of guilty clerics have varied dra­matically. Church officials have said anywhere between 1 per­cent and 3 percent of clergy abused minors. 
The Rev. Andrew Greeley, a sociologist at the University of Chicago, put the number at 4 percent. Psychologist Richard Sipe, a former monk who researches sexuality in the priesthood, said it could be as high as 5 percent. 
The bishops have apologized repeatedly for any wrongdoing and have enacted several reforms to protect children since the long-simmering abuse problem erupted more than two years ago in Boston. The discipline policy they adopted in June 2002 bars sex offenders from all public ministry. 
The bishops authorized the new, landmark studies to restore trust in their leader­ship. No other profession or religious group has exposed itself to such scrutiny on the abuse issue, even though molestation is an acknowledged problem among coaches, teach­ers and clergy of other faiths. 
The prelates said they want­ed to undertake the investiga­tion to demonstrate their will­ingness to confront abuse in the church. 
Victims, however, say the bishops acted only under intense public pressure and said any study by the church is bound to underestimate the number of abuse cases. 
In Boston, where the national crisis began with the case of rogue priest John Geoghan, officials said Thursday that 162 archdiocesan priests -about 7 percent of those who served over the last half-century ­had been accused of abuse. 
But plaintiffs' attorney Mitchell Garabedian scoffed at the count. 
"We have an entity here that has allowed the wholesale sex­ual abuse of children by clergy, and to allow them to count the numbers just doesn't make any sense," he said. "There is a huge credibility problem here."

Critiquing the Notre Dame student election 
I do not personally know Charlie Ebersol, but from what I read in The Observer, it seems that many coordi­nated opposition to his bid for student body president despite his extensive experience. His opponents claim 
Gary Caruso 
that he drives a gas guzzling, envi­ronment-choking Hummer and may Capitol even torture small Comments animals in the back seat. In essence, they suggest that Ebersol lacks the testosterone to become stu­dent body president. 
In the rough and tumble unreal world of academia, election campaigns can become far worse an experience than any national effort. I should know. Thirty-three years ago I ran for student body president, losing to a guy dressed in a Burger King crown with his kitten as his running mate. My campaign offered many sound, sensi­ble and realistic solutions to the cam­pus problems of parking, dining, book­store prices and social life. But stu­dents saw no relevance in our sitting student body president who, in exchange for a letter of recommenda­tion to Yale law school, ignored a turnout of nearly 2,000 students and caved to the administration's proposed ban of beer kegs on campus. 
Why should a contemporary campus electorate, like Americans in 2000, vote for the most experienced candi­date when the issues of the day do not seem as pressing as they might some day become? Nobody really cares about what may lurk beyond the hori­zon. All of us vote our immediate interests. Many of us vote our greed and fears. 
It is ironic that the 2004 Notre Dame student election in many ways mirrors the 2000 presidential race, replete with similar voting trends, an uncer­tain outcome and Elliott Poindexter playing the vote keeper role of Katherine Harris. Unfortunately, Ebersol must endure a loss in part because of an archaic runoff election system and in part as a hostage of his own public persona. 
While Ebersol swept nearly all of the women's dormitories, he nearly lost all of the men's dormitories. His strengths were women, freshmen and sopho­mores. Obviously such liberal elitist characteristics as sensitivity and ideal­ism alone could not carry Ebersol to victory.. He lost the vote of off-campus students like Gore lost the Christian coalition. Upperclassmen in 2004 rejected Ebersollike the angry, gun­toting NASCAR Bubba voters who could not relate to Gore's 2000 effort. 
Gore's losses in Tennessee and West Virginia equated to Ebersol's loss of campus men. The male voting block yearned for an important reason to better identify with Ebersol. He could have better related by going duck hunting like Dick Cheney or at least publicly quoting Digger's basketball record when leading at half-time. 
Ebersol's campaign on the final bal­lot further parallels 2000 in that he faced his own version of Ralph Nader as a third option. What student gov­ernment academic imbecile included an option to abstain on the run-off bal­lot? Maybe the initial ballot should include an area for "none of the above," but never on a final ballot when only two tickets have qualified and successfully advanced. That ballot flaw is like allowing Howard Dean to appear again in November. 
I personally oppose any form of runoff in our public election system, opting for one ballot listing all oppo­nents where the winner takes all. This applies to party primary elections where a party nominee is selected as well as in the general election where all party nominees and independents compete. However, for campus elec­tions, I might be persuaded to accept some form of a primary style effort other than a runoff format. 
Runoff systems are post-Civil War concoctions, originally established to prevent a substantial block of minority voters, in some cases the largest seg­ment of the voting electorate, from electing one of their own. Since alone minorities rarely can muster more than 50 percent of the electorate, big­ots rigged the electoral system so that "like-minded folk" could gang up against such minority efforts when they qualified for a runoff. Regrettably, the runoff system still exists today, primarily in regions of this nation where the electorate pro­nounces all six syllables in the word "school." 
Despite the drama of this year's stu­dent election, Ebersol's legacy on cam­pus will not be completely written until next school year, when Americans vote for a new president. Like many students who ganged up against Ebersol in favor of Istvan in the runoff election, Democrats will ignore Nader to defeat Bush this November. Only then will Ebersol's legacy be written. He will have been the campus version of both AI Gore in 2000 and George Bush in 2004. 
Legacies have a way of changing over time. As alumni, we who endured the betrayal of our student body presi­dent defeated him twice on the nation­al alumni ballot. Funny how politics brings out the worst in everyone.

QUOTE OF THE DAY 
.. 
..Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored., 
Aldous Huxley writer 


LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Community responds to comments about Lenten food options 

I am writing in response to tpe Feb. 26 article submitted by Chris Vierig. I was a student at Saint Mary's from 1995 to 1997 and graduated from Notre Dame in 1999. In 2002, I received my J.D. from the law school. Each year over that span of time, someone lodged a complaint in some manner about not serving meat in the dining halls during Lent. Mr. Vierig suggests that this is the University's "fas­cist" way of imposing Catholicism on non­Catholic students. He has. of course. also suggested some other ways in which the University is oppressing him because he is not Catholic. The last time I checked, Notre Dame is a private, Catholic institu­tion; therefore, it is the school's preroga­tive to follow the traditions of the Catholic faith in whatever manner it deems appro­priate. 
Mr. Vierig indicates that he was equally aware of Notre Dame's Catholic affiliation when he accepted the University's invita­tion to enter the class of 2007. 
The dining hall staff is not forcing stu­dents to pray before their meals; students are not directed to fast during Lent; Burger King is not shut down for 40 dayS"; and the University does not require atten­dance at Sunday Mass. It has bothered me for some years to hear students com­plain about the religious values that Notre Dame has so wrongly thrust upon them. The University does not force stu­dents to do anything in contravention of their own religious beliefs. However, the University merely asks you to respect the traditions of the faith upon which Notre Dame was founded. Limiting the stu­dents' selection of food one day a week for 40 days hardly seems like religious persecution. I would suggest that Mr. Vierig's outrage might be better directed at something more meaningful than miss­ing dining hall meatloaf.

Freshman determination 
commendable, but point is lost 
According to Chris Vierig's letter in yes­terday's Viewpoint, "the Notre Dame administration has crossed the line into fascism by forcing their views upon us." You're kidding? It took you a semester and a half of college to figure that out? I defi­nitely applaud your freshman-like deter­mination to speak out and express your differing opinions, but you are just wasting your time -I realize the irony in saying that you are "wasting your time" when, in fact, I am also wasting my time by responding to your letter. However, you probably should take some time and talk to an upperclassman and discover that the University has not just recently "been going down a slippery slope by forcefully exercising its iron fist more and more." 
During my freshman year, five years ago, hundreds of dorm parties used to radiate through campus every weekend. Dorms thumped with bass as strobe lights from cleared-out rooms flashed into the quads. If you even talk to someone that went here 15 years ago, he or she will tell you crazy keg-tossing stories on North Quad during AnTostal. Granted, the anni­hilation of the O'Neill Mardi Gras is unfor­tunate, but it was only a tiny obstacle in the way of the administration, as are you and I. 
You expressed your "right to choose"-in your article as well, but you chose to come to Notre Dame, and consequently relin­quished said rights. However, I will give you some real choices. If you want to eat meat on Fridays, walk to McDonalds. If you want to get away from the administra­tion's "iron fist," move off campus. If you want hard liquor and excitement in South Bend, go to Boat Club. While the adminis­tration holds all the cards at Notre Dame, you still do have choices. Before you can be happy here, you have to understand that and respect it. 
My suggestion to you, Mr. Vierig, is to try and understand that some things at Notre Dame are always changing while others never will, but either way there isn't a 
thing you can do about it ­ unless you  
have a lot of money.

Stop being offended by 
Catholic traditions 
After nearly four years of dining hall food, I am often disappointed at what I see when I enter the food lines. I must, however, give the din­ing hall credit for not serving meat on Lenten Fridays and Ash Wednesday. As a practicing Catholic, I am also a practicing student who keeps quite busy and has a lot of work to do on a daily basis. Often the first thing on my mind is not "Oh shoot! I cannot have meat today." I'd like to thank the dining hall for reminding me that it is, in fact, the season of Lent. Yes, I know that eat­ing meat on a Friday will not kill me or condemn me to eternal damna­tion, but I do remember that Lent is a time in which we remember Christ's sacrifice. For the majority of students here who practice the faith that this University builds itself on, I see the dining hall's no meat policy as helpful, and I extend my gratitude to food services for upholding the beliefs our university is founded upon. 
Another student wrote on Feb. 26 that he was "offended and angry" at the dining hall for not serving meat. He accused our administration of fascism for not offering meat in the dining hall: To him I say, if you are offended by a religion that preaches salvation and forgiveness for all ­which last time I checked weren't major tenets of fascism -then per­haps you should be more accepting of the environment that you are in. Next time my Jewish friends at home invite me to a Seder meal, I won't get offended that I have to eat bitter herbs and unleavened bread rather than prime rib and a baked potato. I will be mindful of the sacrifices that their ancestors made thousands of years ago and the traditions that their religion carries today. 
Stop being so "offended" by Catholic traditions. If you must eat meat, go to Burger King. A cheese­burger costs less than $1 there, so it won't destroy your flex points either. 
Chris Baughman sen tor Keenan Hall Feb. 25 
Lent equals sacrifice, not fascism 
They even took the bacon bits? Those fascist pigs. How dare they try to impose a belief system that only 85 percent of the student pop­ulation believes in? How dare those who claim to run the University in the best interests of the students deny their Atkins-happy charges of all that protein in favor of promot­ing the very values upon which the University was founded? It's forced religion, oppression and the begin­ning of a neo-fascist movement spearheaded by the Pope himself­or maybe just Bill Kirk. 
Or maybe it's Lent and another freshman class got the surprise of their college careers when they walked into the dining halls on Wednesday. First of all, Notre Dame didn't continue down any slippery slope or cross any line by removing meat from the dining halls in observance of the Lenten season ­this isn't a n~w tactic they're using to ruin the best four years of your life. And second, they're not forcing anyone to practice Catholicism -if they wanted to do that they would drag you to Mass, kicking and screaming, and shove the Eucharist down your throat. 
The Lenten season was not creat­ed to promote a vegetarian lifestyle. Nor was it conceived to force Catholic beliefs upon unsus­pecting freshmen. Most people associate the words reflection, penance, prayer, preparation, humility and sacrifice with Lent. not fascism. Notre Dame is a highly spiritual community. Over 150 
Masses a week, chapels in every 
dorm and a tradition rooted in the 
Christian faith. You knew that com­ing in. Accepting the invitation to 
attend Notre Dame is accepting an 
education that stems from that faith. And that doesn't stay in the 
classroom. 
Chris Vierig "was offended and angry" when he walked into the dining hall on Ash Wednesday. I was offended and angry when I read his letter on Thursday because I don't know if he appreci­ates where he is. Whether you're a Catholic who doesn't like sacrificing your chicken patties or a non­Catholic student, please realize that the University does what it does to promote its values and teachings, and in this case, try and remind you what sacrifice truly means. If you're not up for all that, fine. No one is going to force you. Go over to LaFortune and partake of the many fine eateries that will gladly serve you all the meat you want on any given Friday between now and Easter. But don't write letters criti­cizing Notre Dame administrators. Instead of complaining about what the University is taking away from you this Lenten season, look · around and realize what they're giving you.

Tragedy sho-wi11 Saint Mary'~ 
Shakespeare's Othello is brought to O'Laughlin Auditori 
By JONATHAN RETARTHA 
Scene Writer 
The tragic story of "Othello" comes to Saint Mary's this weekend as the Guthrie Theater presents its production of one of Shakespeare's most well-known plays. "Othello" tells the story of a Venetian general who has just wed the daughter of a wealthy senator, Barbantio. Barbantio strongly objects to his daughter Desdemona's mar­riage to a minority. War calls Othello away to the island of Cyprus to battle the Turks forc­ing Othello and Desdemona leave. One of Othello's soldiers, Iago, is bitterly angry with Othello for naming another soldier, Cassio, to the position of lieutenant instead of him. He devises a plan to get Cassio fired and to have Desdemona plead for his job. In the process, Iago plants the seed of jealousy in Othello's mind and the moor beings a vengeful tirade to uncover the truth. 
The feature role of the play is obviously that of Othello, the general who is driven mad with jealously. The role of Othello prob­ably boasts the largest record of A-list actors in all of Shakespeare. Acting greats such as Laurence Fishburne, Patrick Stewart and

letting his evil side seep through in his inter­actions with other characters. 
Cheyenne Casebier plays Desdemona, the wife of Othello. While her initial scenes tend to be a little weak, she shows tremendous chemistry with Purry. The two really seem to be in love -another trait missing from many other productions where Othello is played as cold and stubborn. 
Kris L. Nelson has a strong supporting role in that of Roderigo, companion to Iago. He plays the role as slightly goofy, but always offers tremendous balance when having to compete with the vivid portrayal of Iago. It is certainly a role that can be overpowered by Iago, but Nelson holds his own beautifully. 
Virginia S. Burke plays Emilia, wife to Iago and caretaker of Desdemona. While her role is very small for the majority of the play, she erupts as the source of moral truth during the death scene. Shakespeare always enjoyed putting the source of morality in the most common character, and Burke commands the stage during the climax of the play. 
"Othello" is being produced by the Guthrie Theater, a company originating in Minneapolis and St. Paul that has brought stage productions to the upper midwest for 40 years. It has a season of 11 plays, playing on their main stage, second stage and on tour. They also work very closely with area stu­dents in the locations they tour to, and help in commissioning high school productions and 
B.F.A. actor training programs. Their recent tour is funded by the National Endowment for the Arts, a program to bring Shakespeare to small cities around the United States. The pro­gram was started by Jack Valenti, CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America, and first lady Laura Bush to help spread Shakespeare's works to over 100 cities across the country. 
"Othello" is a stirring work ofjealousy, lies and murder. The Guthrie Theater offers a tremen... dously professional production highlighting fan­tastic actors with Broadway caliber sets, lighting and music. It is truly the best Shakespeare expe­rience to come to South Bend all year. 
"Othello" plays at the O'Laughlin Auditorium at Saint Mary's College tonight at 7 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets are $25.50 for adults. $23.50 for seniors. $20.50 for the Notre Dame and 'saint Mary's community and $12 for students and family at the 2 p.m. matinees. For tickets, call the Saint Mary's Box Office at 574-284-4626.

Associated Press 
CHICAGO -In a flash, the ball that came to sym­bolize the Chicago Cubs' cursed history was blown up Thursday night, reduced to a pile of thread by a Hollywood special effects expert. 
Hundreds of fans sang "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" before the ball ­the foul fly touched by Steve Bartman in last October's playoffs -was obliterated. 
Bartman had not been expected to attend the event, held in a tent outside Harry Caray's Restaurant. Some fans were decked out in Cubs gear, others wore replicas of the famous broadcaster's signature glasses and one man was covered in ivy. 
"I feel it's finished, it's done and we're ready to move on and now I'm ready to play ball," fan Jessica Scroggin said. 
The stunt was designed by Oscar winner Michael Lantieri, who worked on "Jurassic Park" and "Back to the Future." 
"We're using a combina­tion of pressure, heat and explosives in this bullet­proof tank to destroy that ball so it will not resemble a ball at all when we're fin­ished," Lantieri said earlier. 
Because the explosive send-off came outside in a tent, some fans missed it. 
''I'm somewhat disap­pointed, it was a little anti­climactic for us," Adam Fluck said. 
Whether. the ball was pos­sessed by the curse that leg­end says afllicts the Cubs or not, fans were happy to see it go. To some, the destruc­tion is a sign of the good things to come this season. 
"I think it's very appropri­ate, it's symbolic of a new beginning," Rachel Cannon said. 
Claudette Dockery agreed. 
"The can cremate the ball for all I care or send it over Lake Michigan, the best I believe is yet to come," she said. 
Cubs fans are ready to move on from the infamous moment. 
With the Cubs leading the Florida Marlins 3-0 in Game 6 of the NL championship series and just five outs from their ftrst World Series appearance since 1945, Bartman reached for the ball hit by Luis Castillo. 
From his front-row seat at Wrigley Field, Bartman deflected the ball away from left fielder Moises Alou. The Cubs then gave up eight runs to the Marlins, and squandered another lead in Game 7 the next night.

Softball has tough weekend lineup 
By HEATHER VAN 
HOEGARDEN 
Sports Writer 
In arguably the most presti­gious tournament in college softball, the Irish hope that they can avoid the one thing that has plagued them early this season 
-rain.  
Last week­ 
end's  Palm  
Springs  
Classic  saw  
the  Irish  
endure three  
days of rain.  
Their  final  
game against  
No.  Booth11  
Tennessee  
was  cancelled  due  to  the  
inclement weather.  
Notre  Dame  travels  to  

Columbus, Ga., today to face some of the top teams in the nation in the National Fastpitch Coaches Association (NFCA) Leadoff Classic. In a tourna­ment that features five of the top seven teams in the NCFA top 25, the Irish hope to gain some quality wins, as they face two ranked opponents in the same number of days. 
The tournament, which is being held at South Commons Softball Complex, a former Olympic site, kicks off today with pool play. The Irish (5-3) start things off with Northwestern State (8-5) today at 2:30 p.m. In the nightcap, Notre Dame is set to square off with No. 6 Georgia (9-2) at 5 
p.m. Pool play concludes Saturday at 12:30 p.m., when the Irish face No. 24 Cal State Fullerton (3-6). 
The matchup with Georgia marks the first time these. two teams have met. After pool play, the teams are split up into bracket play, guaranteeing each team at least two more games during the weekend. 
The 24-team tournament fea­tures the top two teams from each NFCA region. This is Notre Dame's sixth overall appear­ance in the tournament, and third consecutive year. This year's field contains 13 top-25 teams along with the U.S. Olympic team. 

Notre Dame hopes that its early season experience will begin to pay dividends for a roster that only includes one .., senior, Nicole deFau. However, the young Irish have had some early season success. Just last weekend, the Irish defeated Utah 4-3 before losing to Pacific 12-1 and No. 8 Stanford 4-2. They ended the Palm Springs Classic with a 10-0 loss to the 
U.S. Olympic team, but held them to one run over four innings. 
The Irish have been led this early season by sophomore shortstop Sara Schoonaert. She posted the Irish's only hits of the game against the Olympic team and was perfect defen­sively. She will bat second this weekend -a jump from her nine spot last weekend. Megan Ciolli, named to the USA Softball Player of the Year to Watch list, added two hits against Utah to lead the Irish to their lone victory last weekend. 
Notre Dame has also received strong pitching performances from sophomore Heather Booth. Booth, last year's Big East Rookie of the Year, posted two consecutive complete game victories, her second coming against Utah. 
Defensively, the Irish outfield has been outstanding, especial­ly against Stanford last week­end. deFau made a home run­robbing catch to keep the Irish within striking distance. 
Following this weekend, the Irish have three more road tournaments. After this stretch, they will have played eight ranked teams.

"We have to match up with their athleticism," Corrigan said. "Still, in any first game, you're really concentrating on yourself. You can't worry about anyone else. Having seen them play once, that's still only one game. Without a tremendous amount of scout­ing. we have to rely on our

Goalie Stewart Crosland made 18 saves. 
The teams have developed a rivalry with the consecutive early season matches. The games have become solid tests on schedules that have increased in difficulty for the Irish. 
"Every year this has been a great game, often the most exciting each year," head coach Kevin Corrigan said. "We've both got indoor facili­ties. This is an early weekend for either team to play unless we have indoor facilities, and both of us do. So we've devel­oped a sort of tradition.

"Since the fall started, we have had a lot of different opportunities to get better," Corrigan said. "We had two different competitions in the fall and played number of good teams. We played the three exhibitions in the spring." 
Last season began with three straight Irish wins over Penn State, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. A win out of the gate against a talented squad like the Nittany Lions is what Notre Dame needs to jump­start its season. Corrigan and the players realize that. 
"We're more than ready," Corrigan said. "We're extremely anxious."

Irish prepare to host rival IU

Coach Jay Louderback pre­dicts a tough match at every position when the Irish host No. 36 Indiana Sunday. 
"We always have a good rivalry with Indiana," Louderback said. "Even if one team is ranked a lot higher than the other, it's still a close, tight match." 
Traditionally, the Hoosiers have won past matches against the Irish, leading the series 12-7. However, Indiana has not won a match against Notre Dame since the 2001-02

The No. 26 Irish (6-1) are on a five-match winning streak after a 6-1 win over No. 20 Brigham Young University 6-1. 
The Hoosiers (5-2) are com­ing off of an upset of No. 12 Kentucky 5-2. nearly sweeping the singles. Kentucky claimed the doubles point, despite Indiana having what Louderback calls "an ofT year."

NO TRACK AND FIELD 
Irish elect to skip U.S. Championships 
By MIKE GILLOON 
Spons Writer 
The Notre Dame indoor track and field teams will be able to go outside and enjoy the beautiful weather this weekend. After both teams finished second in last week's Big East Conference Championships, they will take this weekend off to rest. 
The USA Track and Field indoor Championships are being held today and Sattrrday in Boston, but Irish assistant coach Tom Connelly said Notre Dame will not be sending any participants. 
"The kids ran so hard last week at the Big East," he said. "We decided it would be best to ease our way back into training and risk having too much recovery instead of too little." 
The Irish ran well last week as a number of athletes took horne individual awards. Selirn Nurudeen won the conference championship and set a Big East record by running the men's 60­meter dash in 7. 78 seconds. Lauren King won her second straight conference title in the mile run in a time of 4:53.95. Sophomore Molly Huddle also made her mark last week as she was one of three runners to break the conference record in the 31,000 meters. 
Connelly, the women's distance coach, was thrilled with these performances. 
"Kerry Meagher, Lauren King and Molly Huddle were otrr work­horses," he said. "Kerry was in a lot of races and Molly ran very hard all weekend. They have a lot of experience, and they knew what they had to do." 
Connelly mentioned that the teams as a whole were pleased with their performances at the Big East. 
"Our kids competed really hard," he said. "Miami finished ahead of our women but Miami is one of the top teams in the nation. Our kids just kept lining up and running and did about every+Jling they could." 
The Alex Wilson Invitational will be held at Notre Dame next weekend. Connelly wants to use that meet to get some more team members qualified for the NCAA Championships, to be held March 12-13 in Fayetteville, Ark. 
"There are a lot of kids on our team who we want to get quali­fied next week," Connelly said~ "We also want to fine tune the rest ofthe people who are already set to go to nationals." 
Connelly believes the team is still confident as it heads into the horne stretch of the indoor sea­son. 
"The only way for runners to gain confidence in themselves is to run fast," he said. "Our kids ran very fast last weekend."

The No. 17 Irish look to start the season on the right foot when they head west to lock horns with a pair of California squads this weekend. 
After facing the University of California at Berkeley today at 3:30p.m., the Irish head some 50 miles south to Stanford to take on the No. 14 Cardinal at 12 p.m. Sunday. 
Due to a number of factors, coach Tracy Coyne isn't exactly sure what to expect from the Golden Bears.

"We're going to do the best we can to balance everything out," Coyne said. "It will be a chal­lenge, but I feel confident in our ability to face that challenge head on and perform well." 
Following a 17-9 thrashing of Team Canada in exhibition play Feb. 14, the Irish finished up a short preseason at the presti­gious Princeton Invitational Saturday. 
The team competed in a unique arrangement that allowed the Irish to compete against defend­ing champion and No. 1 Princeton, No. 7 Dartmouth and No. 9 Ohio State -the

Coyne said. ''I'm expecting them to be pretty good, but in all honestly I'm expecting to win." 
The Irish, on the other hand, are more than familiar with the Cardinal. After a number of squandered opportunities led to a 14-13 double overtime heart­breaker against Stanford's last season, Notre Dame is eager for a little payback. 
"I definitely think this is one of the games on our schedule that we're really looking forward to playing," Coyne said. "We know they're going to be a good team, and we're looking forward to [the game]. It's a revenge type ofsitu­ation." 
In addition to the level of com­petition, the Irish will be forced to battle the fatigue involved with both playing and traveling. Nevertheless, Coyne believes the shutout of Ohio State. However, the Irish ran into trouble with the pair of Ivy League squads. Dartmouth held off Notre Dame for a 12-8 victory, and Princeton made short work of the Irish to the tune of a 7-0 shut out.

It gets monotonous when you're [training] inside for six weeks, but we got through it, and we're looking forward to getting started."

LeWis indicted on drug charges 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -One of Jamal Lewis' lawyers believes the evi­dence prosecutors used to obtain an indictment may actually clear the Baltimore Ravens running back of federal drug charges. 
Lewis was released Thursday on $500,000 bond after he pleaded innocent to charges that he tried to help a childhood 
friend buy cocaine in the sum­
mer of2000. 
After a brief hearing, defense 
attorney Ed Garland said that a 
recorded telephone conversation 
cited by federal prosecutors is . open to interpretation. 
"They may have omitted things 
that should have been in there," 
Garland said. "We believe it will show he is innocent." 
Lewis stood outside the federal courthouse in the rain and made a brief statement. 
"I just want to say it's extreme­ly important to me that my fami­ly, my friends, my fans and the 
· Ravens organization know that I am innocent and I thank every­one for their continued support," Lewis said.

The Irish have been plagued by nagging injuries, and senior tri-captain Luis Haddock and sophomore Eric Langenkamp were sidelined for Thursday's contest.

''I think Brent played pretty well, and Barry [King] extracted himself from a 4-0 deficit and played well from that point on," Bayliss said. "But you could just see the confidence in the Illinois players' eyes .... 
At doubles, D'Amico and Keckley lost to No. 8 Brian Wilson and Stolt 8-5 at the top spot. No. 18 Michael Calkins and Martin defeated Scott and Bass 8-4 at two, and DeHeart and Jones topped King and Paul Hidaka 8-5.

Mired in a two-game losing streak where a win in just one of those games would have solidified this team's claim for a NCAA Tournament berth, Jones knows as a captain he has to work. with Irish coach Mike Brey to keep the team positive. 
"We have to make sure every­body's mood is up as we have done for the whole season up until this point," Jones said. 
With the injuries suffered by almost every Irish player mak­ing significant contributions this season, Brey's squad has had to deal with more adversity this year than any other season of his in South Bend. According to Brey, overcoming all of the injuries and getting into the national spotlight as a possible NCAA Tournament t.eam is something more than anyone could have hoped for.

After dropping a tough game to Pittsburgh and winning three straight to gain some momen­tum, the Irish stopped making their shots. Whether that's a credit to the opponents' defense or just going cold, Brey knows his team relies on the outside shot and it has to go in for the Irish to win. 
"We've got to make some shots outside, whether it's against a zone or a man-to­man, because of who we are now with the personnel avail­able," Brey said. "A couple of those things have to go in. When a couple go in, we are a little more confident." 
"Hopefully a couple will go in [when we are] in Los Angeles because we are _going to keep firing them."

Irish take on first-place Michigan this weekend 
ByJUSTIN SCHUVER 
Associa£e Spons Ediwr 
In what has sounded like a broken record this season, the Irish again will take on a ranked team this weekend. The difference is that this series is at home, where the Irish have a 12-game unbeat­en streak (10-0-2). 
Notre Dame (15-11-4, 11-10­3 in the CCHA) will put that impressive streak on the line when they face the CCI-IA's first-place team No. 4 Michigan (21-8-1, 16-5-1) tonight and Saturday at the Joyce Center. 
The Irish have played nine games so far this season against ranked teams, collect­ing a 4-4-1 record in those games-including a 1-0 win over then-No. 1 Boston College Oct. 
by one point and fifth-place Alaska Fairbanks by two points. One advantage Notre Dame has over these teams is that the Irish have games in hand (one game in hand on WMU and two games in hand on UAF). 
''I've been in situations near the end of a season where you have to hope that another team loses games, and it's lousy," Poulin said. "It's terri­ble watching the scoreboard and hoping that somebody else does something. I would rather have it in our hands, I would rather have Notre Dame play to decide where Notre Dame is going to go in the postseason." 
Although Michigan has had a distinct advantage in the series (55-39-5), the record is much closer in games played at the Joyce C e n t e r (Michigan leads

"[Our difficult schedule] has really prepared us for games like this," Irish coach Dave Poulin said. "It really does prepare you to go out and play a game like this -there's nothing that can compare to playing a Boston College at Boston College or a game against Maine. 
"Those kinds of games really prepare you for the big confer­ence weekends like this one." 
The Irish enter the weekend in seventh place in the CCHA with 25 points. They trail sixth-place Western Michigan

since a 5-3 loss to Bowling Green Oct. 17. 
"I really think we've got a real advantage [at the Joyce Center]." Poulin said. "We've just created a great atmos­phere here -the band's been tremendous, the students, the fans, the energy, the horn ­every part of it has added to the atmosphere."

game has been the play of its goalies -sophomore Alvaro Montoya for the Wolverines and junior Morgan Cey and freshman David Brown for the Irish. 
In a recently-released NHL Central Scouting rankings·, Montoya was ranked the No. 1 collegiate goaltender eligible for this year's NHL draft, wit4 Brown ranked No. 2. 
"I think these are probably three of the top goalies in the country, and there will be a lot of focus on them, but I also think their teams play great defense in front of them," Poulin said. "There's a lot of components that make up a 
good goalie, but it certainly helps to have defensively­sound players in front." 
Michigan has one of the best offenses in the conference, with an average of 3.84 goals per game. A large percentage of that offense comes from the Wolverines' power play, which scores at a 21.8 percent rate and an average of 1.28 power play goals per game. 
Notre Dame's penalty kill has been just as impressive. The Irish have killed 33 con­secutive penalties and have killed 89 percent overall (121 of 136) to lead the CCHA and rank third in the nation. 
"The special teams will be 
enormous," Poulin said. "You're getting the No~ 1 penalty kill against the No. 1 power play this weekend, and it's huge. Part of our success on the kill has been because we've been taking fewer penalties -it's a lot easier to kill three or four penalties than six or seven." 
Notre Dame faces Michigan at 8:05 p.m. tonight at the Joyce Center. That game will be broadcast nationally on College Sports Television. Face-off Saturday is scheduled for 7:05p.m.

Irish have chance of a lifetime this weekend 

Notre Dame and Michigan. At the Joyce Center. With home-ice advantage for the first round of the CCHA playoffs on the line. It just doesn't get any bigger than this. 
Michigan is, and has always been, "the" team in the CCHA. Th.ey've won numerous national champi­onships and conference champi­onships, and go into each season expecting to win another. 
This is a team that helped sell 74,554 seats at the Michigan State football sta­dium when they played the Spartans in college hockey's first ever outdoor game in 2001. This is a team that has not had a losing season since 1986­

going to be up for it, and hopefully we can come away with a win or two." 
The Irish will have a great opportunity this weekend to silence their doubters and to make a statement in front of a national audience. Tonight's game will be nationally broadcast on College Sports Television and the college hockey world will be watching to see how the Irish compete against "the" team in the CCHA. 
In their last series against a top-ranked team in the CCI-lA, back on Feb. 6 and 7 against Miami (Ohio) the Irish simply did not look like they could com pete with the Redllawks, falling by scores of 5-2 and 2-0.

the season. 4-1 Saturday. 
Notre Dame 

was off last weekend, and has spent the last two weeks of practice preparing for these key games in its schedule. 
"This off week allowed us to get healthy and rest up our minds going into this big series," Poulin said. "The energy's been high all week in practice and hope­fully that will carry over to 
OFFENSE 
this weekend." 
The Irish have certainly shown they are capable of beating the best teams in the country already this season. Notre Dame defeat­ed then-No. 1 Boston College 1-0 on the road back on Oct. 24, ruining the Golden Eagles' home open­er. 
The team has also defeat­ed then-ranked teams No. 3 Maine, No. 4 Wisconsin and No_. 15 Ohio State this sea­son, with all those victories coming away from the Joyce Center. Notre Dame is cur­rently ranked No. 17 in RPI and has three quality wins, tied for nrst overall. 
With a successful outing against Michigan and a few wins in postseason play, it would not be presumptuous to assume that the Irish would have quite an attrac­tive resume for the NCAA Tournament selection com­mittee. 
The Irish have never advanced to the 16-team NCAA Tournament in the school's history. 
"From good to great doesn't happen overnight," Poulin said. "It happens over a period of time, but there are significant points that can give you the chance to go to that next level. We're a good team, 
we're in the top 20 in the 
countryand rank high in 
several statistical cate­
gories. 
"We're a good hockey 
team, but the chance to be 
great is ahead of us. There 
are certain points along the 
way that are magnified, and 
I think this weekend is one 
of them." · 
When the puck drops 
tonight, Notre Dame will get 
that chance.

DEFENSE SPECIAL TEAMS GOALTENDING INTANGIBLES 

Poulin has taken the Irish to the Super Six Championship three of his last four years. He has made the most of his recruiting, with stalwarts such as Wes O'Neill and David Brown already making major contributions this year.  The Irish offense has been the team's Achilles heel at times. The team does not get much offense outside of the trio of Rob Globke, Aaron Gill and Mike Walsh. Notre Dame scores a lot of its goals as the result of going hard to the net.  Notre Dame's defense is one of the best in the country, ranked ninth overall in scoring defense with a goals against average of 2.37. The Irish win a lot of games by close margins as a result of a defense that keeps the team in nearly every game.  The Irish penalty kill has successfully staved off 33 consecutive penalties coming into this weekend. Notre Dame's penalty kill is ranked third in the country with an 89 per­cent rate.  This might be Notre Dame's biggest strength this season. The tandem of Morgan Cey and David Brown have combined for six shutouts this season. Brown is tied for third nationally in save percentage.  The Irish have only lost one game at home this season and cur­rently have a 12 game unbeaten streak. Despite playing in a makeshift hockey rink, Notre Dame's students and fans have helped create a true home-ice advantage.  
Rod Berensen is entering his 20th sea­son behind the Michigan bench. There is little he hasn't done, having already won two NCAA championships. The Wolverines have advanced to the NCAA Tournament 13 straight years.  The Wolverines score lots of goals, with an average of 3.84 goals per game. Michigan has one of the most balanced offenses in the country, with 13 players with at least 10 points so far this sea­son.  Defensively the Wolverines are strong, only giving up 2.37 goals per game. The defense ean hold leads, with the team holding a 16-2-0 record leading after one period.  The Wolverines have the top power play in the CCHA, collecting at a 21.8 percent clip so far this season. Their penalty kill is not quite as impressive, at 84.7 percent. That can be a problem, as the team takes a lot of penalties.  AI Montoya has qui­etly had an impressive season in net for the Wolverines. With so much offense around him, he has been over­looked at times but has solid stats with a .907 save percentage and a 2.41 GAA.  Michigan is used to being one of the power­house hockey programs in the country, and this year is no exception. The Wolverines know they only need three points to clinch the CCIIA regular season championship.
