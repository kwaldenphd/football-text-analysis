Anti-abortion activist defends his controversial methods 

By CHRIS SKORCZ 
~nlor StaffReporter 
IJeclaring that we have "lost a sense of the value of man," pro·life activist joseph Scheidler in a lecture last night emphasized the need for continued anti-abortion activities and defended his methods that many people:, including some: of his fellow pro·llfe activists, have: found con· troversial. 
"I've always been an activist. I have seen an enormous growth of concern for the abortion conflict and feel that we must teach to anyone who will listen," Scheidler told a crowd in the auditorium ofthe Memorial Library. 
"l believe In the words of Jesus that whatever we do to the least of our brothers, that we do unto him. And I also believe that we are now strong enough to shut down a por· lion of the abortion Industry," he said. 
Scheidler said that in order to shut down the industry, "we have to fol­low people around. Some people say that we are not nice, but abortionists are not nice people. They are mur· derers, not doctors, for they do not heal anyone. 
"If you don't try it, it won't hap· pen," he said. "The Lord wants us to 

do it because he can't do it without 
us. That is not how he works for he 
won't force the human will." 
A major obstacle that the pro-life 
movement must overcome is the 
1973 Supreme Court decision in tJ,e 
Roe vs. Wade case, according to 
Scheidler. Claiming that the 
Supreme Court was "wrong in 
saying that 'thou may kill,' " Scheid· 
ler insisted that the mere fact that 
such a decision has become law 
does not make it right. ' "Some laws must be disobeyed. 
You are morally bound to disobey 
such a law," Scheidler said. 
And it is this moral obligation to 
disobey such laws that Scheidler cited as the primary reason for the pro-life movement's vehement ef. forts to remove such pro-choice political figures as Senator Bob Pack· wood of Oregon and former con· gresswoman Geraldine Ferraro. 
"Governments are for people and ifyou don't care about life at its ear· liest stages, if you don't care about people, you should not be in govern· ment," he said. 
Scheidler provided several reasons for the tremendous "popularity" ofabortions, especially since the famous Roe vs. Wade deci­sion. According to him, one of the primary reasons for the large num· bers of abortions being performed today is a "playboy philosophy" that is present among today's young men. 
Scheidler explained this philosophy as one in which "women are seen as objects, things, pieces of meat. And this attitude has had a devastating effect on our young men. These young men tend to demean women and it is dreadfully harmful." 
Another reason given by Scheid· ler for the prevalence: of abortions nationwide is the financial pressure felt by many medical school stu· dents who sometimes incur debts

Alcohol awareness must increase 
"Heading to Senior Bar tonight?" 
"Yeah, and after that there's a party at Campus View." "I'm going to get ripped this weekend!" "We'II get some seniors to make a beer run." 
Everyone at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's has heard sentences like these before. Most have spoken them in one version or another. What clearer signals are there that another weekend is about to begin? 
To most students, such words are harmless descrip­tions ofa night's activities, and at times, the products of a week full ofstress. 
But to others, these words take on a different meaning. They become not an occasional indulgence, but a routine. Somewhere along the line they stop being fun, and become compulsion. 
Such is the origin ofthe student alcoholic. 
The problem is more widespread than many would like to believe. Statistics es­timate that one in every 12 
Americans is an alcoholic, awareness week scheduled and the Irish-Catholic for February. Events will in­nature of Notre Dame only clude lectures, discussions compounds the problem.

Characteristically, the 1'14~K tuEIMHOLT 
University's main solution is punishment. According to du Lac, intoxication will result in anything from dismis­sal to suspensions, fines, or a mere referral to Psyc­hological Services. Such an arbitrary system does little 
more than confuse and alienate students and skirts the problem. 
In May 1984, the University took a major step by im­plementing a new alcohol policy. The campus went dry (except in an' alcoholic's prime drinking hideout -his own room). Rules were tightened and threats of an even dryer campus made. 
But, a year and a half later, the policy's most impor­tant part, a program ofalcohol awareness, has yet to be developed. Without such a program, the policy has caused a lot grieffor ordinary students while doinglittle for alcoholics, whom it was meant to help. 
In the absence ofdecisive action from the University, however, students finally have begun to take charge. According to Mark H., a recovered alcoholic who is spearheading alcohol awareness efforts on campus, 

Mary Healy 
Accent Editor 
"The alcohol policy was done with good intentions but I don't think it's achieving the purpose it set out to ac­hieve. The University hasn't followed through." 
Recently Mark submitted a proposal to the Hall Presi­dents' Council asking that it support his idea to offer a course at Notre Dame on addictions, a course he believes is a crucial step toward alcohol awareness. He is planning petitions to be circulated in the dorms. 
Even student government has taken action by creat­ing the position of Alcohol Commissioner. This year's 
commissioner, Fifi Paraiso, 
is organizing an alcohol 
IO·")I Awareness Week at the Col­

lege. Events will include talks on the history of drinking at Satnt Mary's, the per­sonal story ofa recovering alcoholic, and the benefits of endorphins or "natural highs." 
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings are being held on both campuses. At the meetings, a recovered alcoholic relates his or her personal story, followed by an open discussion. 
An open AA meeting (for anyone interested in learn­ing more about alcoholism) was held in Dillon Hall last month and attended by at least 15 students. Another, geared to women, will be held Monday at 7 p.m. in Breen-Phillips. 
Aclosed AA meeting, for those who believe they may have an alcohol problem, will be held Tuesday night at 
7:45 in O'Laughlin Auditorium. 
Alcohol abuse on campus is a problem which previously has been met with bumbling ineptitude. But as students face it head on with determination and creativity, the result will be a real improvement in the heart ofthe problem.

Principle is Important 
Parietals are a positive influence on the residentiality of Notre Dame and distinguish it from other universities. Unfortunately, the severe penalty inflicted upon students who violate this rule also distinguishes Notre Dame. 
The punishment of suspension or dismissal regardless of circumstances contradicts the Catholic nature of the University. Removing a student from Notre Dame when there is no moral issue in question is detrimental to both the students and our community. When the punishment is so unforgiving that it denies the Notre Dame and Christian ideals of compassion for one's fellow man in a time of real need, something is wrong with the principle. 
This has been the case recently and will continue to blemish the character of the school unless you, the parents, students and faculty of the University, Please take action against this unjust penalty. take the time to write Vice President of Student Affairs Father David Tyson to show your displeasure with this punishment.

The resolution demanded that Healy refund the money and make a formal apology to the senate and stu­dent body. 
The resolution was defeated 1 1-4. 
"I do question was It serving stu­dent government or Bill Healy the student. Most students said that It's serving Bill Healy," Culum said. 
But Judicial Council Coordinator Karen Ingwersen disagreed with this view. "I think the letter told students what student government Is doing," Ingwersen said. 
Senator Chris Abood said he thought Healy had ev~ry right to spend the money and that the senate could not force him to refund it. 
In other business, the senate un­animously passed a resolution sponsored by Culum requesting the administration to clarify its rul~s regarding where and when a student can be punished. 
The resolution also expressed the senate's dissatisfaction with the ad­ministration's treatment of Dillon Hall residents who sponsored a tall­gater In Ann Arbor, Mich. 
"When you read du Lac It's v~ry vague," said Culum. "We want parameters made as to when we will be made accountable.

Soviet journalists to conduct Reagan interview today 
WASHINGTON President Reagan, in a pre-summit gesture to the Soviet Union, will be questioned today by four journalists from Mos­cow in the first interview granted by an American president to the Soviet press in nearly a quarter ofa century. 
j
The session, at 2 p.m. EST in the Oval Office, is "a unique and historic opponunity for the president to communicate directly with the people of the Soviet Union," said White House spokesman Larry Speakes. "We hope it is a sign of a new and more open information policy on the part of the Soviet Union." 
Shooting in mall kills 2 
AIII!Odated Press 
SPRINGFIELD, Pa. -A woman in 
army fatigues and black boots 
opened fire with a semiautomatic 
rifle in a crowded shopping mall yes­
terday, killing a man and a 4-year-old 
boy, and wounding eight others 
before she was subdued by a 
passerby, police said. 
The 28-year-old woman was taken 
into custody following the 4 p.m. 
rampage at the Springfield Mall in 
Delaware County, said Springfield 
Township Police Chief George Hill. 
Police then closed the shopping 
center. 
Police had dealt with the woman 
before because of "emotional 
problems," said John McKenna of 
the Delaware County district attor­
ney's office. Neither he nor Hill 
would identify her. 
The woman got out of her car at 
an entrance to the mall and began 
shooting the .22-caliber rifle at a 
woman using an automatic bank 
machine, but missed her, Hill said. 
"Then she began firing at 
everybody and anybody who got in 
her path," he said. 
A 4-year-old boy near the mall 
entrance was shot fatally, Hill said. 
She then moved inside the mall, 
turning and firing as she worked her 
way through the crowded main 
walkway, firing more than 15 shots 
in less than five minutes, Hill said. 
"The woman went on a random 
shooting rampage until she was 
wrestled to the ground by a college 
student" outside a shoe store, he 
said. 
Jack Laufer, 24, of Medina, 
"grabbed her from behind, wrestled 
her to the ground and kicked the 
rifle away," Hill said. 
She still had several rounds in the 
rifle when the student jumped her, 
he said. 
It was not known immediately 
where the 40-year-old man was 
slain. 
The victims, who ranged in age 
from 2 to 67, were taken to six 
hospitals.

No restrictions have been imposed on the Soviets' questions, although they are likely to focus on Reagan's summit Nov. 19-20 with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Geneva and superpower relations, Speakes .said. He said the United States has not asked to review in ad­vance what will be published. 
"They will repon it as they wish to repon it," he said. Likewise, he said there was no requirement for the Soviets to publish the full text of the questions and answers. 
"We think a sufficient amount of the interview will be conveyed," Speakes said. "We have no reserva­tions about the matter." He said the material probably will be published first on Sunday in the Soviet govern­ment newspaper Izvestia, followed by the release of a complete transcript by the White House. 
In other developments related to the summit: 
It 
was announced that Reagan will address a joint session of Congress at 9 p.m. EST on Nov. 21, immediately upon his return from Geneva. On his way back to Was­hington, Reagan will stop off for two hours in Brussels to report to allied leaders at NATO headquarters on the summit. 

Reagan 
said he was "personally hopeful'' and "striving" to present a counteroffer -before the summit -to the recent arms proposal from Mos­cow, which calls for a 50 percent reduction in strategic nuclear

weapons. In an interview with Britain's BBC radio, Reagan said the Soviet proposal contains both "seeds to nurture" as well as "some thing that we believe are so disad­vantageous to us that they should be negotiated and some changes made." 
Reagan, asked by the BBC what he hoped to accomplish in the sum­mit, said, "I think that the most that we could get out is if we could eliminate some ofthe paranoia, ifwe could reduce the hostility, the suspicion that keeps our two countries particularly . . . at odds with each other." 
Speakes said the journalists would have about a half hour with Reagan. Their questions will be posed to Reagan in Russian, and translated into English by an interpreter. Reagan's replies will not be translated into Russian on the spot because ofthe journalists' fluency in English, Speakes said. 
The White House will provide the Soviets with a Russian language translation of the interview, Speakes said. 
"We will certainly be able to read their newspaper to see if it is published in its entirety and see if the translation agrees with our trans­lation," Speakes added. 
He said the Soviets have not replied yet to a longstanding U.S. proposal for Reagan to appear on Soviet television.

Democrats criticize Reagan's SS cuts 

WASHINGTON -Congressional Democrats charged yesterday that President Reagan's attempt to cut 17,000 positions from Social Security's staff by 1990 is a back­door effort to erode service and un­dermine support for the program. 
Several senators and representatives held a news con­ference to release copies of internal Social Security documents discuss­ing possible cutbacks in service. 
"It's all a very clevergame to build up public antipathy and resentment of the program," said Sen. Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, where offi­cials are worried acutely about a potential loss of thousands of jobs at the Social Security Administration headquarters in Baltimore. 
The Reagan administration has acknowledged previously it wants I to eliminate 17,000 of Social , Security's 79,600 jobs by 1990 through attrition. But spokesman James Brown said yesterday, "There is absolutely no list of offices to be closed or combined." 
No position will be eliminated "if it would reduce the level of service we give to the public," he said. 
Twenty-four members of the House, including two Republicans, Virginia Smith of Nebraska and Clarence MillerofOhio, signed a let­ter urging colleagues to accept a Senate appropriations rider that would bar Social Security from cut­ting 1,000 jobs or closing offices in fiscal 1986. 
Sen. Lawton Chiles, D·Fla., the aut­hor with Sarbanes of that prohibi­tion, said lines at the nation's 1,300 Social Security offices already are "too long" and any plan for further cutbacks Is "reprehensible." 
Social Security has already reduced Its staff by the equivalent of 7,000 fuU-tlme workers In the past four years. 
An Aug. 29, 198S, a memo by Louis Enoff, deputy Social Security commissioner for programs and policy, said clerks spend the: largest amount of time helping people piece together all the information needed to get a retirement benefit.

Security tight for Ghandi's 

anniversary 
Assoclated Press 
NEW DELHI, India Sharpshooters in trees will help guard Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi when he addresses a rally expected to number a million people today, the anniversary ofhis mother's assas­sination. 
Angry Sikh militants in Punjab called a counterrally to glorify her slain Sikh assassin as a martyr. 
Elaborate security plans, includ­ing helicopters, were laid out yester­day for the New Delhi rally honoring Indira Gandhi, Rajiv's mother and predecessor. 
"Security is so tight that even birds will not reach him (Gandhi)," the Statesman newspaper reported. 
lbroughout the capital, more than 35,000 police and security troops were posted to prevent Sikh terrorist attacks on the first anniver­sary of the day when Gandhi's own security guards shot her on the gar­den path of her residential com­pound. 
Speakers at the rally will include Mother Teresa ofCalcutta, winner of the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for working with slumdwellers. 
One Sikh guard, Satwant Singh, is 
on trial for murder in Mrs. G;mdhi's 
death. Two other Sikhs are charged 
with conspiracy. The government 
says a second Sikh gunman, Beant 
Singh, was killed at the scene by 
police. 
The government says the prime 
minister was killed to avenge her or­
dering the army attack on the Gol­
den Temple in Amritsar in June 
1984 to root out Sikh terrorists. 
More than 1,200 people died during 
the assault. 
In Sikh-dominated Punjab: 
security forces were bolstered as 
militants put up hundreds ofposters 
of Beant Singh and other slain ex­
tremists and set a rally for today in 
the Golden Temple, the holiest 
shrine of the Sikh religion. 
Activists demanding a separate 
Sikh nation called for a "Beant Singh 
Martyr's Day Rally," hailing him as 
"the man who saved the falling tur­
bans ofthe Sikhs ... the Sikh nation's 
leading warrior." 
India has 13 million Sikhs, who 
make up 2 percent ofits 750 million 
population. Most Sikhs want greater 
autonomy for their state.

Board stepping toward 
increased effectiveness 
Twice a year a group of SO people visits Notre Dame. This is the University's Board ofTrustees, the school's ultimate governing body. Until now students have had only a muffled voice on this board. 
Soon the student voice well may be amplified. Two ofthe board's four commit­tees . the university relations and academic and faculty affairs committees -are considering admitting student members. Because the committee is the backbone of the board, student committee members would allow the student body to par­ticipate meaningfully in governing the University. From their seats on these two committees, students would have potential for substantial input to the board. 
Anthony Earley, chairman of the student affairs committee, said students al­ready occupy seats on his committee. But these "student c~mmittee ~ember~," to this date, have been permitted to attend only select meetmgs ofthetr commtt­tee. 
It is doubtful a student will occupy a seat on the investment committee in the near future. Last week Robert Wilmouth, chairman ofthis committee, said such a position would provide more of a learning experi~n.ce for t?e student member than a source of positive input to the board. By htdmg behmd such an excuse, Wilmouth is denying the intelligence of Notre Dame students and ignoring the other merits ofa student committee member. 
The ad hoc committee on South African investments demonstrates that stu­dents are knowledgeable on investment issues and are able to deal with them responsibly. On controversial issues such as tuition increases and University in­vestments in South Africa, the trustees are often viewed as villains. The presence ofa student on the Investment committee would help defuse such an attitude and untangle the lines ofcommunication between the students and what they view as the powers that be. 
To be as an effective body as possible the board needs to seek out all perspectives of Notre Dame. Because students are the main focus of the Univer­sity, their viewpoint must not be overlooked or_stifled. . .. 
Establishing student committee members wtth full commtttee prtvtleges and responsibilities would be a giant step toward effective and pro~er student par­ticipation in governing their university. But ifstudents are permttted to serve on the hoard's individual committees, why not on the full board? 
The trustees argued that a student trustee with full voting rights and pri~ileges would not be as effective as student committee members. Many have satd that most of the board's decisions arc determined by consensus, not by actual votes, and that most of the actual work of the board is doric within the committees. 
Given such an organizational structure, a student on the board would not hinder its work. On the contrary, the establishment of a student trustee would symbolize the University's acknowledgement of the value and necessity of stu­dents in attaining a complete view of the University. 
In looking at the: results of last week's trustee meeting it is obviou~ the board wants student participation in the governing process. Student commtttee mem­bers would be a first step toward unmuzzling the student voice on the board. The final step must provide a voice in which a student speaks clearly as a full trustee.

Filial appreciation, love develop from maturity 
In December of 1967 I lost my position as only son. At the time I did not know what my new position entailed, and although I doubt that 1fully understand the position now, it is becoming clearer what it means to have a brother. 
The 18 years since that December day have been filled with many things inherent to the family situation: name-calling, tattle-taling, fighting and competing. 
johnA. Mennell guest column 
The name-calling continues, though often filled with more adult terms, and rarely meant as seriously or with the same criticism that it had in earlier years. The tattle-taling has changed to the telling oftall tales, and where I often felt cheated by the tattle-taling, I am now baffled by the ingenious tales. The physi­cal fighting has ended, probably to my advantage, as lifting for me consists of moving my dining hall tray to the conveyor belt ofthe South Dining Hall but for him it is weights. 
The competition through the years has been sometimes fun and often quite intense. As children we both played basketball and baseball. We both had some talent and were solid contributors to our respective teams. While we never played on the same team or in the same league, I often felt the need to better the performance of my younger brother. I did not want to be shown up. 
The competition followed us into the clas­sroom where we were both good students, but I never wanted my brother to get better grades than I did. I was determined to go to Notre Dame and knew I needed good grades to get here. Grades came easily for me in high school and my goal was realized. 
My brother did not have the luck with grades that I did in my first years of high school, nor did he have my goals. Everyone who ever talked to him realized that he was intelligent, but his creative mind just was not excited by the thrill of trigonometric calcula­tions. He may have felt the need to compete with the marks ofhis.older brother and sister, and has shown that he can. 
The competition went beyond the field and the classroom as sibling rivalries often do. I had troubles sometimes accepting his suc­cesses; instead viewing them as shortcomings of my own. He had different goals which would lead to successes that I could never ex­perience for myself. 
As we have grown older our interests have diversified and we have started doing things

that are more difficult to compare. My brother began running and I took to my own activities. 
While I did run cross-country in seventh grade, I realized that it was not an activity for me. I often finished In the top ten, but rarely were there more than 15 people In the race. 
My brother began running after my early retirement but at a younger age than my start. He did well, but he did not often win, regularly beaten by his good friend from across the street. Even in junior high school when when two runners on his team consis­tently had better times than my brother, he continued working hard at his running. Heap­peared the third best runner but was never discouraged. He realized the merits ofwhat he had done better than I had when I ran, and better than winning the races, worked harder to become a winner. 
I do not think I have ever worked as hard at anything as he has at running. Not many people have worked that hard at anything, and I wish 1 could say I had. While I have envied his determination, I also realized I could never compete with him in running. Rather than sulldng, or trying to knock his achievements, I have realized the best thing a brother can do is take pride In his sibling's accomplishments. 
Rather than talk about my brother who is the third best runner on his high school team, 1 can brag that I am the brother of a determined kid who has run daily through the biting cold of Minnesota winters. He has become the third best, behind two of the fastest runners In the state, on an undefeated cross-country team which Is facing only the state meet. He got there only by struggling five kilometers with the pain of tendonitis tearing at his knee. Had he not run with that pain, he and his teammates would not have won the regional meet that qualified them for the state competition next Saturday. 
There was a time when I might have been more envious and less proud of his ac­complishments. I won one letter in high school for tennis In my senior year -the same year that he won his first letter in track as a high school freshman. Now he will be com­peting in the state cross country meet. 
Regardless of what happens at Saturday's Minnesota State High School League Cross Country Meet there will be two definite win­ners: my younger brother who has worked for years to get to where he is, and his older brot­her who realizes what an accomplishment It Is.

America should assist blacks in South Africa 
DearEditor: 
Those who call for the withdrawal of ~ American companies from South Africa are r right on target; but they focus too narrowly on 
one aspect ofa much largerproblem. Not only
~ 
-ought the United States end its political andr economic collusion with the white govern­ment ofSouth Africa, it ought also to offer as­
r 
ssistance, at least moral if not material, to the African National Congress and other political factions which struggle to throw offthe chains ofoppression within that country. 
However tragic, the day has long since passed when South African blacks can achieve their freedom by non-violent methods of rebellion. The white government has proved itself intransigent to the point of filnaticism; and the genie ofpolitical unrest among blacks can no longer be put back into the bottle. As Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. once remarked, "A closed society in the defense of evil institu­tions creates moral differences ru too profound to be solved by compromise. The unhappy fact is that man occasionally works himselfinto a log-jam; and the log-jam must be burst by violence." 
The question regarding South Africa is not r whether there will come a revolution. It has 
,.. 
already begun. The question is whether r America can still remove its own interests 
r 
from the log-jam. Surely our national security
r 
(not to mention the demands of conscience)
r 
r suggests that we should withdraw the last r vestiges of American support from that op­r pressive system and instead throw in our lot 
with those who strive to bring it tumbling down.

Assessment of problem leaves much desired 
Dear Editor: 
It would be difficult for me to convey ef­fectively the rage I felt after reading the View­point article by Ken Andre on Oct. 18. Therefore, a systematic critique of his presentation will have to suffice. 
Andre began his piece accurately with an assessment ofthe South African situation. The arguments he puts forth concerning economic sanctions against South Africa however, left much to be desired. 
The first contention, that apartheid is a political problem not an economic one, demonstrates not onlya lack ofunderstanding of the situation in South Africa but a fun­damentally erroneous conception ofpolitical­economy in general. As much as corporate executives deny the link, politics and economics are inextricably entwined, even in the ·~free market" of the United States. This relationship exists to an evengreater extent in the Republic ofSouth Africa. 
How can Andre claim that apartheid is not 
,an economic problem when the white minority prohibits black South Africans from owning property in so called "white areas", and maintains a stronghold over the owner­ship ofall productive sec~ors ofthe economy? Does he not know that blacks do not own the gold and diamond mines, the large farms, nor the high-tech industries? Blacks do not realize profits in South Africa. Instead they provide a source of cheap labor by which the powerful white minority obtains the profit. 
Two criticisms concerning Andre's second point on economic sanctions against South Africa can also be made. It seems it was not long ago that I stood on the steps of the Ad­ministration Building and heard the now in­famous statement that should U.S. firms divest from South Africa, theJapanese and West Ger­mans, who are not as concerned with social issues, would buy up U.S. interests. Little did I expect to see that same weak argument 
reiterated in The Observer a week later. As 
Mary Frances Berry pointedly asked at her 
lecture on Oct. 11, should we cavort with evil 
because ifwe don't someone else will? I think 
not. 

Secondly, Andre points to the failure of 
sanctions against Rhodesia as a justisfication 
for not imposing them against South Africa. 
One of the reasons these sanctions "didn't 
work" was the failure to fully implement 
them. Let us not forget the Byrd Amendment 
which allowed U.S. firms to import chrome 
and other minerals in spite of the sanctions. 
Perhaps if the sanctions had effectively been 
enforced, Zimbabwe would have been a free 
nation much sooner. 

Additionally, Andre claims that the frequent 
use ofeconomic sanctions to achieve political 
ends has resulted in a perception ofthe United 
States abroad as an unreliable supplier. I find it 
strange that this argument received little at­
tention when President Ronald Reagan 
imposed sanctions against Nicaragua. 
The third aspect of Andre's cost benefit 
analysis examines the cost ofsanctions against 
South Africa to the United States. I did not 
realize that the goal of sanctions against any 
country was to improve the U.S. economy. 
Certainly the potential for suffering by U.S. in­
dustry as a result of sanctions exists, but no 
one said fighting apartheid would be acostless 
battle. As black South African leaders have 
told us, they themselves would rather suffer 
briefly now than continue to suffer endlessly 
under the oppression ofapartheid. 
Arguments against economic sanctions fur­ther demonstrate patronizing, paternalistic at­titude that pervades this University. For some reason, the beliefexists at Notre Dame and in the White House that the United States knows what is best for South Africans living under the apartheid system. Foolishly, we think that we 
have solutions to their problems. In actuality, South Africans realize that only they can change their country, but not at the exclusion of outside assistance. Black South African leaders are urging the United States to come through with that aid in the form ofsanctions against the government of P.W. Botha. The best we can do is to heed their call. 
Margarita M. Rose Notre Dame graduate student 
Kevin Howard answers attack on his position 
Dear Editor: 

I would like to address some points made by John Ginty, a student senator, and the co­writers in their letter of Oct. 29. It would seem logical that someone involved in stu­dent government would try to get filets straight before committing near-libelous statements to print. 
To begin with, it is interesting to note that "it is no secret that the chairman of the Hall President's Council has the most to gain by making the Student Senate a scapegoat for the Healy-Lawrence administration's ineptitude." Also, I was in on "the IDthy grab for power when I signed the proposal for the abolish­ment of the senate. By the elimination of the senate, I will lose the only vote I have with regard to student government, as I will not sit on the Campus Life Council, the body which will effectively address student issues. The senate has been incredibly inept in fulfilling this role. You, Ginty, and the other four senators sit on the CLC with an HPC representative, currently Carroll Hall Presi­dent Steve Kern. I see absolutely no way in which I"gain power" as a result ofmy actions; in filet, the proposed move will increase your power. And now I suggest we declare a moratorium on the use of that word. 
nd then I read I was a "main instigator be­hind the student government debacle last spring." I was not on the CREST restructuring committee. I voted for this proposal as a mem­ber of the senate, but only with provisions asked for and often attained. I felt it was a good proposal but agree that it was unconstitu­tional. A "main instigator"? Please. Do not at­tempt to associate my name with such negative images when you couldn't even get the facts straight. 
You conclude by stating "Howard, (Lee) Broussard, and (Karen) Ingerswen have no constituencynd serve no purpose as mem­bers of the senate. Yet these so-called student 'leaders' abolish themselves and resign from the Student Senate so that some real work can be done." Precisely. You understand our point at long last, Ginty and friends. We serve no purpose on the senate and should be removed to allow the CLC to be the forum for the stu­dents to voice their opinions. Allow me to do my job, and Broussard and Ingwersen theirs, without the conflicts within the senate. Wit­hout the senate, even senators might ac­complish something. And none of us have resigned our positions on the senate, nor will we. I will not even mention the incorrect usage ofthe word "abolish." 
I am very proud of the members who sit on the HPC, their mature attitudes and their open minds throughout this confusing issue and our history as an effective body. Our record speaks for itself. I will thank you if, in the future, you do not drag the HPC's good name down by your silly allegations, Ginty and fel­low signers. 
Kevin Howard HPC Chairman 

There is much to be learned from the Reformation 
"How would things look ifRome (without ceasing to be Rome) were one day simply to overtake us (Protestants) andplace us tn the shadows, sofar as the renewing ofthe Church through the Word and the Spirit ofthe Gospel is concerned?" -Karl Barth

r r 
r This day, Oct. 31, 1985, this All Saints' Eve, ,.. we observe the 468th anniversary of the ,.. Protestant Reformation. Should we rejoice or 
should we mourn?
r-
We rightly mourn the divisiveness that frag­mented the unity ofthe Christ's Mystical Body and that gave rise to the scandal of a divided r house preaching reconciliation. Yet, we do r even better to mourn how little of the 
r: Reformation, our Reformation, we have 
r 
chosen to own. 
r 
The Protestant Reformation is our (Roman Catholicism's) Reformation as well as "their's" because it was God's chastisement of a people who had gone astray and become confused. The Spirit ofthe Reformation was a historical manifestation of the prophetic im­pulse. This is not to say that all ofits prophets acted in perfect harmony with the Holy Spirit at all times and in all places. There are prop­hets in every age who, like Jonah, are more possessed of self than they are possessed of God; and then there are others, likeJeremiah, who possess "the gift oftears." But who is the wise man? The one who judges the messenger or the one who judge the message? 
What, then, is the central thrust of the Reformation, and is it compatible with true Catholicity? Modern ecumenical dialogue has made apparent that the primary emphases of the Reformation, certainly at least at their core if not necessarily in every particular expression, stem from basic biblical prin­ciples. They are principles that sorely need to be reiterated for today's Christians: for Cat­holics, who still have much to absorb, and for Protestants, who have forgotten much. 
First of all, the Reformers emphasized, or more clearly, said not~ng new, but only restated and clarified that which is eternally true, that we are justified and made right with God by faith alone (Eph 2:8; Rom 3:28). Good works are indeed important, but form and expression are subordinate to substance and value. Faith, not good works per se, pleases our Divine Lover because the healthy Finally, the Reformers reaffirmed the relationship depends more on the state ofthe "priesthood of all believers" ( 1 Pe 2:5-9; Rev heart (will) than on the external (acts). The 5:10). The Lutherans and the Calvinists did not person who presumes to earn salvation and denigrate the ordained ministry but simply in­
reconciliation aspires to the impossible and the odious: attempting to earn love freely given. Yet, how many people today sincerely but wrongfully think that a merely moral and/or dutiful life will get them to heaven? 
Second in importance only to the necessity ofinner conversion is the Reformer's stress on holding a high view of the Bible. Why? Recall the words of St. Jerome, Doctor and Father: "He who does not know Scripture does not know Jesus Christ." Yet, little comfort to know that many mainline Protestants are even worse off. Fundamentalists, we say, know a lot of Bible but very little (good) theology. But are we really better off if we know very little Bible and a lot of bad theology? H. Richard Niebuhr jabs at those clerics and theologians who tell us: "A God without wrath brought men without sin into a kingdom without judgement through the ministrations of a Christ without a cross." Traditionalists. Progressives. Without the word of God, we think like mere wo(men) (Rom 12:2; Mt 22:29).

sisted that both responsibility and power be restored to the whole People of God. To paraphrase St. John Chrysostom: to say that monks should strive for sanctity and that lay people need only avoid hell, is a doctrine of devils. Yet, there are still many parishes and congregations that seem like one-(wo)man shows while scores ofparishioners each week put in thousands of (wo)man hours into ot­her, less important causes than the work of advancing the Kingdom of God ( 1 Cor 12:12­27; 2 Cor 5: 11-21; Vatican II, "Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity," Article 2,6, 7,10,13 ).

~
the Iron Curtain 
HANNES HACKER 
featuns Writer 
A 
mericans hear of the Soviet 
Union every day on the news or 
in the papers, yet few ofus have a 
clear picture of what life is like in 
what President Reagan called "the 
Evil Empire." Terms like chis cause 
us to wonder even more, what it is 
like to live in the Soviet Union? To 
say the least, an "Evil Empire" 
which buffers itself from the West 
behind an Iron Curtain is a mys­
terious creature. 
However, some Notre Dame 
students have had the opportunity 
to go behind this Iron Curtain and 
see the Soviet Union for themselves. 
Three of these students are Edward 
j. Sheeran, David lmmonen, and Mike Kucher. Although their stay was short, they still had an oppor­tunity to experience the country and its people enough to satisfy curiosity and learn a great deal about the Soviet Union. 
The first thing these students saw 
in the Soviet Union was a guide 
from INTOURIST, the Soviet 
government tourist agency. 
Sheeran, a Notre Dame law student 
who went to the Soviet Union while 
he was an undergraduate here, was 
surprised to find that his guide 
recognized him as well as the other 
students in his group from the 
photos they sent on their visa ap· 
plications. 
These applicatons asked for back­ground information and Sheeran felt lucky that his did not ask for his military background: he was an ROTC cadet at the time and he felt this would cause the Soviets to deny him an entrance visa. 
Sheeran described his guide as a "friendly but dogmatic" person who would not hesitate to criticize 
U.S. policies. He also mentioned that the guides had to report their 
location and that of their group to 
the KGB every day. For this reason, 
they would turn down invitations 
to dinner with the students. 
In addition Sheeran said, "Foreigners are mistrusted and 


j 
their freedom is strictly limited while guests in the Soviet Union." j The reason for this, he said, is that 
l J the Soviet government wants to avoid foreigners mixing with its population. 
In order to restrict his group's freedom, his itinerary was made so tight as to discourage independent exploration. 
lmmonen, junior in the College ofArts and Letters, had a different experience with his guide, who was much more open and even made jokes about the KGB. Also, his guide "only mildly discouraged going away from the group." However, he went on to add that, "everything was planned so there wasn't much opportunity to do it." 
lmmonen speculated that the difference between these guides could have been due to the fact that his group was primarily from Austria, a neutral country, where Sheeran's group came from London. 
One common stereotype ofRus­sians that Sheeran found to be untrue was that Russians are back­ward, cold, and ignorant. He said that Russians are very warm, Intel- ligent, and curious people, but it is not always manifested due to mistrust offoreigners induced by the state. 
Sheeran also noticed, "The people, generally, are not salified

discreetly under a sweater foil 
another attempt to steal something 
tasty from the cafeteria. 
An alert Unlverstly Food Services worker is poised at the door ready to disarm the culprit, as the student specta!Ors become more aware of each move the opponents make. 
The Fudgesicle Fiend slides the plain, brown box on to a chair as she spots what Is awaiting her and stops to discuss the dilemma with the people seated at the nearest table. 
At the same time, the relentless worker flusters a bit, attempting to watch every move the Fiend makes while still appearing to concentrate on the paperwork in her hands. 
After consulting her accomplice, the Fudgeslcle Fiend stands and chats a bit more, appearing to the worker to be in a deep conversa­tion. 
The Fiend's eyes flicker to the opposite side ofthe cafeteria and the door located at that end, open and unguarded, calling her name. 
The tension rises as the worker waits for the Fiend to make her move and the Fiend contemplates just what her next move shosuld be. 
like a thiefin the night, she goes for it. Heading for the door at a steady jog, the Fudgesicle Fiend eludes the unsuspecting worker! 
The worker doesn't lose much time, though. Realizing her suspect has outwitted her, the worker chases after her. THe worker moves slowly at first but soon picks up the pace. 
Suddenly, she drops her keys! The crowd sucks in their breath. "Will she pick them up or continue her pursuit?" they wonder. 
In one deft move, as if to answer the question without It even being verbalized, she sweeps her keys up offthe floor and continues the chase. 
The crowd cheers her on as she reaches the edge ofthe room and disappears behind the doors, seeking out her suspect. 

"Did they get away with it?" 
"I wonder Ifshe caught them?" 
"She should have left the keys!" 
Curiosity fills the air as the stu­
dents try to settle down to their 
reubens, leftover ravioli, and legal 
fudgesides. 
Then... she emerges. 
Victorious and with the evidence in her own hot little hands, the pride of Univeristy Food Services returns to the dining room amid roars, cheers, and extensive hand clapping. 
It seems a standing ovation is appropriate for the moment but our heroine is back to her job at the bat ofan eye. 
She returns to the checking area and is then seen recounting her colorful tale to her co-workers, a huge grin on her face. 
Another great day at the North Dining Hall for our unwavering worker. But, another futile attempt for the Fudgesicle Fiend and her cohorts. 
With heads hanging, the Fudgesicle Fiend and her com­panions return to their rooms, plotting all the way how to palm those popsicles tomorrow.

He also cited a growing resur­gence offaith among Russia's youth. 
He felt that this was due to a dis­satisfaction with party teachings, but not a total rejection ofthem. 
Kueber also noticed the amount ofreligious beliefamong the Rus­sian citizens, saying, "No matter

nlike most Notre Dame stu­
dents who will just go home 
over Christmas break, a small group 
of them will also visit the Soviet 
Union. jim Butterfield, a graduate 
student in Soviet Studies, is organiz­
ing a trip to the Soviet Union in the beginning ofjanuary. 
Butterfield explained the purpose of the trip, "It's hard to appreciate what it's like being Rus­sian without actually going there. You can read about it in the paper or in books, but its not the same thing as experiencing it first hand." 
The trip starts from Kennedy International Airport in New York onjanuary 2. (This date allows interested students to spend Christmas at home.) It is up to the student to be in New York on the second, but if there is enough inter­est, a domestic group rate to New York could be arranged.

he loud, staccato knocks upon the doors ofthe stu­dents' rooms were scarcely ack­nowledged. It was all too easy to roll over and hit the snooze button on the alarm clock as it obnoxiously signalled the rude hour of3:30a.m. With a tremen­dous amount ofeffort, and more than a little help from their roommates, the members ofthe University ofNotre Dame In­nsbruck Program slowly arose from the haven oftheir beds to get ready for church. This would be no ordinary Mass, however, as the location was the tiny European country ofLiech­tenstein and the celebrant was PopeJohn Paul II. 
Scarcely a "Guten Morgen" was heard as most ofthe group of twenty seven and their direc­tor David L. Schindler boarded their bus at 5 a.m., half an hour later than planned. The gorgeous Austrian countryside was scarcely appreciated during this Sheeran's gro~p asked to visit Mos­cow University, the tour guide brushed them off saying, "Nothing would interest you there." 
Perhaps the most educational aspect of the visit was experiencing, first hand, a society without basic human rights. Traveling students were well aware of the fact that they could easily get into trouble for as little as saying something wrong. 
Aman approached Sheeran's group in Moscow and said he was a dissident and wanted to know 
five-hour trip from Salzburg, 
Austria to liechtenstein's capital 
city ofVaduz; at this point the 
view behind closed eyelids was 
quite enough for these Domers. 
At least they arived fairly 
refreshed at the entrance to the 
Sport Park Eschen-Mauren, a 
large field upon which a huge 
platform, bleachers, and roped­
offstanding areas had been con­
structed. The group members 
spent the hour before the Mass 
listening to unfamiliar voices 
give speeches over a loud­

speaker in German. "What? That 
was the prince ofLiechtenstein? 
I didn't know they even had · one!" said one confused listener. 
Soon it was 11 a.m. and time 
for the pope's entrance. Luckily, 
only half ofthe expected 50,000 
people were in attendance, so 
most ofthe students had an ex­
cellent view ofjohn Paul II as he 
drove by in his clear plastic­
shielded "Pope-Mobile," perhaps 
no more than ten feet away. · 
The date was Sunday, Septem­
ber 8, the Church's designated 
day for celebrating the birthday 
ofthe Virgin Mary. The Pope read aloud the Gospel according to Matthew, recounting how an angel toldjoseph not to be afraid to take a pregnant Mary as his wife. This theme was recounted inJohn Paul Il's 40-minute homily on the worth of the family and marriage. 
"The Catholic Church will not stop repeating its principles and those in particular that concern the problems ofunmarried couples living together, in­fidelity in marriage, divorce, and abortion," asserted the pope to the people ofLiechtenstein, 85 percent ofwhom are Catholic. 
The members ofthe program expressed a variety ofreasons for wanting to see the pope. "My grandmother would have killed me if I didn't go!" states Notre Dame sophomore joAnne Bar­bera. 
"It gave me goosebumps," says Patty Scallen, a sophomore from Saint Mary's. "There was only one kid in front of me and then the pope. It was great -the guy second next to God driving by us." 
The itinerary includes visits in Leningrad, Moscow, and Tbilisi, the capital ofthe Georgian republic. This last stop is meant to show the diversity of the Soviet Union, since Tbilisi has a different climate, heritage, people and history than the other two cities. 
There will also be an opportunity 
to sightsee in Helsinki. 
The deadline for sign-up was Monday, however students can still sign up if they pay a late fee. Also any student wishir;tg to sign up should already have a passport. 
The total price for the trip, late fees included, is about S I 500, but if enough students sign up, this price could drop to as low as S1325. These prices include round trip transportation from New York to South Bend (arriving on the night before registration ),room and board, guide costs and visa ex­penses. 
For further questions, interested students should contact the depart­ment ofgovernment and interna­tional studies. 

where he could find other dissi­dents. Sheeran wanted to help him, but he did not want to take the chance that the man was really a KGB agent, so he did not even answer him. 
All ofthe students who visited the Soviet Union thought it was an educational experience. Kueber summed it up: "Russia is a fascinat­ing land, and there's much Americans can learn by going there. Americans should make an effort to study Russia, their land, their culture, and their language."

now shell-shocked Valparaiso goaltender. About three minutes later, on probably the best play of the game, co-captain David Miles scored on a header from freshman Tommy Gerlacher's assist to stake the Irish to an insurmountable 6-1 lead. 
Valparaiso scored two late goals 
to make the final 6-3, but Coach Grace didn't think that his team got complacent with a five goal lead. 
"I played 25 guys," explained Grace. "Heck, at one point I had five goalies on the field. I thought everyone was intense until the end." 
This ·victory brings the team's record to 6-11-4, with one game remammg Friday against tough Loyola on Alumni Field at 2 pm.

San Antonio Spurs guard John Paxson has signed a free-agent of­fer sheet with the Chicago Bulls, according to officials of the Na­tional Basketball Association team. 
The Spurs have 15 days to match Chicago's offer, Bull's spokesman Tim Hallam said Tuesday, adding that the terms of the offer were not available. 
The 6-2 former Notre Dame player was the Spur's first-round pick, the 19th selection overall, in the 1983 NBA draft. 
He averaged 6.2 points and 3 assists in 78 games last season.

Wildcats OK investigation by NCAA 
~dPR:U 
LEXINGTON, Ky. ·The University of Kentucky has advised the NCAA that it would cooperate with any In­vestigation into repons that basket· ball players accepted cash and other gifts from boosters, an official said. 
"We've been advised we would receive any assistance that we deem appropriate from the institution," said David Berst, the National Col· legiate Athletic Association's en­forcement director. 
Berst said UK invited the NCAA "to participate In the collection of information" about the alleged violations. He declined to say whet· her an actual investigation by the NCAA had begun. 
Berst said that, in general, lnves· ligations involving former players can take longer than those Involving current ones unless the school In· 
volved asks  for  an  Immediate in­ 
quiry.  
The  Lexington  Herald-Leader  

reported Sunday that 26 former Wildcats said they had accepted money from boosters. The players 
also said they sold their free season tickets for Sl,000 or more each and received excessive payments for speaking engagements. All violate NCAA rules. 
UK already had announced that It had begun an internal investigation of the reports and had notified the NCAA and the Southeastern Con· ference. 
Brereton Jones, a member of UK's board of trustees, said he did not know whether the university had invited the NCAA ln. However, he said a "call for the investigation is ap· propriate." 
But, he said, "I wouldn't imagine that an independent Investigation would come up with any different results" than what appeared in the Herald-Leader. 
"I'm just very saddened. Unfor­tunately, it seems to be a sign ofthe times, not just at UK but for aU other colleges," he said. "I hope this kind of expose will help force the issue" of Improper payments In collegiate 
athletics.

Field Hockey team routs Valpo, 9-1 
By KENT R. WELDON 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame field hockey team made its last match of the season an exciting one, as a relent­less Irish offense posted a 9-l victory over Valparaiso yesterday. This vic­tory upped the team's final regular season record to 10-6-2. 
This victory did not come as a surprise to Irish Head CoachJill Un­denfeld since the Irish downed Val­paraiso 9-0. in an early season scrimmage in which the Irish were without two starters. 
"They were all good goals, but we just weren't challenged today," Un­denfeld said. 
The Irish coach was right, as the best defense proved to be a strong offense. Notre Dame's goalies only had to make three saves on the day as the Irish offense peppered the Val­paraiso goalie with 35 shots on goal. 
Corinne DiGiacomo started the rally with a goal just two minutes into the game, and then she followed with the next three Irish goals making it a four goal outin_g. 
Melissa Sommer picked up the next three goals after assisting DiGiacomo on an earlier score. Meg McGlinn finished the scoring with two goals, while Molly McCabe had three assists. 
"Corinne and Melissa had great games for us today," Undenfeld noted. 
The Irish coach said that she was happy to see her nonstarters all get a chance to play. 
"It was hard for the substitutes since they aren't used to playing together, but they did a good job," commented Undenfeld. 
The second team fared as well as the starters, posting three of the Irish goals, but they also allowed a late second half goal which kept Val· paraiso happy and Notre Dame from a shutout. 
Undenfeld noted that second teamers Caroline Berezny, Christine Sweeney and Joanne Marshall all played well. 
"Caroline will be a strong player and starter for us next year," lin· defeld said. 
Although the Irish have finished their regular season schedule, they are not done as they will travel to the Midwest Regional Tourney Nov. 8· I 0. There the Irish will face some tough squads in Eastern Kentucky, Louisville, Southern Illinois and Southwest Missouri. 
Irish

with some of the regulars to keep the chance of a sweep from slipping away, scoring 13 of the next 14 points. Freshman Mary Kay Waller came to life to key the rally with two kills, two blocks and an ace. 
While Lambert wasn't totally happy with the play ofhis bench, he did see some play to his liking. 
"After winning the first two games, I wanted to give everybody a chance to play," said Lambert. "We had our mental lapses, but I was happy to see us come back. I espe­cially thought Rochelle Holder played well, considering it was the first she has played this season. 
Everybody will need to be ready 
Sunday for the match with DePaul. 
The Blue Demons sit atop the Norh 
Star Conference with a 6-0 record, 
while Notre Dame is next at 5-l, so 
the match will be important in 
seedings for the upcoming con­
ference tournament.

with Indiana scheduled for next 
Tuesday at the ACC will not be held.

Sternberg's two scores pace Irish to 6-3 soccer win over Valparaiso 
By PETE SKIKO 
Sports Writer 
Wednesday's Notre Dame men's soccer game against Valparaiso started out on a very familiar note for the Irish · slow. Mickey Cseri's indirect kick off of a restart 12 minutes into the first half put Val· paraiso up 1·0, i;)ut the Irish roared back to score six unanswered goals to put the game away, winning by a score of6-3. 
"I felt we started slowly again, and I was disappointed that we gave up the restart goal," said second-year head coach Dennis Grace. "But we came back tough and played some smart soccer." 
Joe Sternberg opened the Irish scoring at the 16:33 mark ofthe first half. He scored after Notre Dame was awarded a penalty kick for a Val­paraiso tripping violation inside the penalty box. Sternberg scored two goals and had an assist on the day, raising his team-leading goal total to nine. 
"Since the season's.halfway mark, Joe's really come into his own," commented Grace. "Once (Chris) Telk went down with an injury, we had to put Joe back to midfield, and he's made me look like a great coach because that's where he was born to play." 
Pat Szanto opened the second-half scoring off of a free kick by senior Stuart McDonald, deftly faking past a defender and firing into the corner ofthe goal. That put the Irish on top, 
2-1. 
At this point, Notre Dame began to dominate the game, as the majority of the play took place in Valparaiso's end. Junior forward Bill Gross tallied on a nice feed from Sternberg with ten minutes gone in the second half, and then Sternberg followed with his second goal. The Valparaiso goalie committed himself by going after a loose ball, but Sternberg beat him to it, flicked it past him and steered it in. 
Sophomore Bruce McCourt pushed the lead to 5·1 with 21 minutes left, taking a pass from Randy Morris and blasting it past a

Notre Dame volleyball team beats St. Francis in three straight games 
By CHUCK FREEBY 
Sports Writer 
It was an inconsistent, uninspiring and certaiilly not an artistic perfor· mance by the Notre Dame volleyball team to say the least. 
To say the most, it was a win. 
That's all that really mattered to the Notre Dame volleyball squad Wednesday night at the ACC, as the Irish struggled to a three-game sweep over St. Francis (ill.), 1 5· 7, 15·12, 1 5·12. 
The victory, Notre Dame's second in _a row, raised the: Irish slate to 9· 
15. Meanwhile, the Lady Saints tumbled to 24-25. More impor· tantly, it keeps any momentum Notre Dame: has rolling towards Sun­day's North Star Conference show­down with DePaul in Chicago. 
Nevertheless, the Irish will have to play much better than they did against the Saintsifthey are to knock off DePaul. Notre Dame combined flashes of brilliance with streaks of bad play to leave head coach Art Lambert with mixed feelings. 
"I'm happy with the win, but we still have too many unforced errors," noted the Irish coach. "It was ob· vious we couldn't put the ball down tonight, and that was due to a com· bination offactors." 
Not the least of which is the fact the Irish are in transition at the set· ter slot. Sophomore Jill Suglich has moved to outside hitter where she can better use her passing and defensive skills, putting classmate Kathleen Morin in the setter's role. While Morin's statistics were not im· pressive Wednesday night, it was clear she is still making progress in adjusting to her new role. 
"This was only Morin's fourth game at setter, so to ask her to do it all is a little much," commented Lambert. "She's doing a nice job, though, and we need Suglich for pas· sing and defense." 
The Irish had problems at times in both those areas Wednesday, as they were forced to come from behind fn all three games oftheir sweep. Notre Dame started quickly, bolting to a 5· 0 lead by dominating the net. Those unforced errors that Lambert men· tioned started cropping up, though, and consecutive kills byJulie Kruger and Jody McCormick rallied the Saints to a 7·51ead. 
That would be all for the Saint comeback, as Notre Dame scored the next 1 0 points to win game one. 
Maureen Shea collected three kills to key the spurt, including the game­winner, while St. Francis helped with five unforced errors. 
Game two followed the same pat· tern, as the Irish jumped to a 4-1 lead on the net play ofSuglich. St. Francis regrouped following a timeout, however, and an ace by Sheavoun Pivaronas tied the game at four. 
The Saints then proceeded to score the next five points, three of them comingon consecutive kills by Dawn Maxwell, to JO on top 9·4. That meant it was time for another Irish comeback. 
Everybody contributed to this one, as four Irish players came up with kills during a 1 0-1 scoringspurt which helped pace Notre Dame to a 15-12 win. 
Game three gave members of the small group of 92 people on hand a lesson in what eternity is. The game featured 45 side outs and a number of unforced errors, as neither team looked like they wanted to win. The Irish looked partcularly sloppy in fal· ling behind 11·2. 
By this time, Lambert had cleared his bench, and the reserves teamed see IRISH, page 14

Only 900 tickets left for '85-'86 basketball 
Special to The Obllerver 
Any student who has yet to purchase his 1985-86 basketball ticket may have cause for alarm. When the ticket windows dosed yester­day at 6 p.m., only about 900 tickets remained, according to the estimation of Notre Dame Assistant Ticket Manager Ron Vogler. 
Freshmen are scheduled to pick up their tickets today from 1:30·6 
p.m. at Gate 3 of the ACC, and there is some chance that the ticket supply could run out before everyone gets an opportunity to buy one. 
On Tuesday, Notre Dame Ticket Manager Mike Bobinski had expressed his belief that there was no need for anyone to worry about the ticket office running out of student tickets. At that time, approximately 2,000 total tickets had been sold the first two days to the junior and senior classes, including all 1,575 lower arena seats. 
According to Vogler, yesterday's sale to sophomores, law and graduate students was about 1,400, consuming the bleacher seats in sections 103, 104, 105, 106 and all but four rows of 107. What is left for today's sale is the rest of 107 and all of 108, as well as seats in sections 115 and 116 behind the basket on the east end ofthe ACC. 
Cost ofthe bleacher seats is S39. 
Irish defense won't rest this week against Navy 
When Notre Dame takes on Navy in a nationally· televised contest Saturday afternon, the spotlight will be on the matchup between two of the nation's top tailbacks, Allen Pinkett of the Irish and Napolean McCallum of the Midshipmen. But don't be surprised lf it's the Notre Dame defense that steals the show. 
This is a unit that has slowly but surely gotten itself together over the past several weeks, after hitting its low point in a 35·17loss to Purdue a month ago. It is a unit that features a secondary that is coming into its own, a solid corps oflinebackers that is playing up to expectations, and a group of defensive linemen that are performing above and beyond the call ofduty. 
The latter group has been particularly impressive oflate, if only for its ability to cope with adversity. When left tackle Greg Dingens went down with a leg injury against Army two weeks ago, he joined right tackle Wally Kleine and noseguard Mike Griffin on the sidelines. Of those three, only Kleine has a good chance ofmaking it back this season, but that won't be for at least two more weeks. 
But even with three ofits top performers out ofaction, the defensive line has kept chugging along. The Irish defense has given up just one rushing touchdown in the last 1 5 quarters, and a lot of the credit goes to a couple of reserve linemen, as well as a new defensive formation that has made things easieron the linemen that are still healthy. 
The reserves that have held the line together lately are senior noseguard Mike Kiernan and sophomore tackleJeff Kunz. Keirnan saw his playing time reduced when Eric Dorsey was moved from right tackle to noseguard in the beginning ofthe season, but since then the injury situation has pressed him back into duty. When Kleine went down,

Football Notebook 
Dingens was moved from left to right tackle so that Dorsey could move back to the left side where he is admittedly more comfortable. That move made Kiernan the starter at noseguard again. 
Kunz, meanwhile, has stepped in for Dingens at right tackle and is making rapid progress. In his last two games he has recorded 15 tackles. The injury problems have likewise meant more playing time for sophomores Matt Dingens and Bob Martz, and both appear to be coming along well. 
But that still adds up to only five down linemen with any sort ofgame experience, and that's not enough to run a 3-4 defense week in and week out. This is why the Irish defensive coaches made the intelligent move to 4-3 defensive alignment (or 2·5, if you prefer) that includes two outside linebackers at the defensive end spots. The alignment uses Dorsey and Kunz as the down linemen, and makes good use of Notre Dame's abundance of ex­perienced linebackers. 
One of those linebackers, senior captain Tony Furjanic, has paced the defense with 87 tackles this season. He was named Midwest Player of the Week on defentie by the As· sociated Press for his efforts in the Notre Dame's 3 7· 3 win over USC last Saturday, as the Irish held an opponent wit· hout a touchdown for the first time since a 42·0 rout of Army in 1983. Furjanic recorded 10 solos and 15 total tackles as Notre Dame's defense shut down an offense that had rolled up 93 points in its two previous games. 
Furjanic's inside help has come mainly from Mike Kovaleski and Ron Weissenhofer, while the new alignment has enabled outside linebackers Mike Larkin, Rick DiBer­nardo, Robert Banks, and Cedric Figaro to get more playing time. The results against USC speak for themselves, par· ticularly in the area of rushing defense, where the Trojans were held to 102 net yards on 34 attempts. 
Trojan quarterback Sean Salisbury managed to have a solid game Saturday, connectingon 21-of-34 passes for 191 yards, but the Irish secondary did the job when it had to. The defensive backs gave up the short pass but didn't allow themselves to get beat for the long gain, which is a big reason why USC managed just three points Saturday. 
EXTRA POINTS . Starting quarterback Steve Beuerlein will definitely be available for the Navy game. Beuerlein injured his throwing arm last week against USC, but had full rotation of the arm on Tuesday and began practicing on Wednesday. The injury occurred on Beuerlein's six-yard touchdown run in the first quarter. . The medical report is not as favorable for back-up strong safety Brandy Wells. The sophomore pulled an abdominal muscle against USC and will miss the Navy game. . · The Navy game will be carried by ABC, with air time slated for 3:30 p.m. Musco will once again be on hand to provide the portable lighting.
