Take Ten teaches conflict resolution through the Robinson Learning Center 
By MADELINE BUCKLEY News Writer 
As violence in schools contin­ues to trouble the American education system, Notre Dame students are visiting South Bend area schools to teach healthy conflict resolution through the Robinson Learning Center. 
The center runs the Take Ten program, a program geared toward preventing violence in South Bend and Mishawaka schools. Its mantra is "Talk it out, walk it out, wait it out," and the curriculum encourages stu­dents from kindergarten to high school to "take ten deep breaths

New CSC construction underway 
After $14 million, revamped Center will be four stories high and provide needed space 
By KATE MCCLELLAND News Writer 
A quick walk across the north end of campus will show that the new year has brought more new construc­tion to Notre Dame. 
Ground recently broke on the new Center for Social Concerns building, which is projected to be finished in the summer of 2009. 
At four stories high and 64,000 square feet, the new Center will provide the much needed space and resources that the old Center -at only 11,400 square feet -lacked. 
The Institute for Church Life will be moving from its

College alumna survives bombing 
By KATIE KOHLER Saint Mary's Editor 
Saint Mary's alumna Suzanne Seidl Griffin sur­vived a suicide bombing attack in Kabul, Afghanistan while working as senior proj­ect manager of education for the Save the Children USA program in Kabul. 
The attack took place at the Serena Hotel in Kabul on Jan. 14 and was the deadliest direct attack on a hotel in Kabul since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. 
Griffin was in the gym dur­ing the attack. 
"There was blood on the 
floor all the way to the 
kitchen. There was a lot of 
blood in the lobby," Griffin 
told the Associated Press. 
"There were shell castings outside." Last year, S a i n t Mary's awarded Griffin, a 1967 grad­uate of the College, the Humanitas Award, an award the College

By KATIE KOHLER Saint Mary's Editor 
For a few moments, mem­bers of the Saint Mary's Women's Choir and Madrigal Singers had their primetime television debut as winners of the NBC competition "Clash of the Choirs." 
Both choirs were featured on Dec. 17 as part of the four-night competition. Choir director and Music Department chair Nancy Menk heard about the com­petition through a choral Listserv and asked her choirs if they wanted to participate. 
The competition was open to any choir, from five to 500 singers, Menk said. 
"We had to choose from four or five pieces to sing, and we already had a couple of them prepared once I heard about it, so we were all ready to go," she said. 
The Women's Choir per­formed "Amazing Grace" and the Madrigal singers sang "We Wish You a Merry Christmas." 
Each of the choirs was fea­tured in the national Holiday Challenge competition and both were recognized as two

By KAREN LANGLEY 
News Editor 
Longtime Notre Dame employ­ee Patricia McAdams was badly injured in a car accident Sunday while returning from the women's basketball game in West Virginia. 
McAdams, a computer support technician in the Main Building, is in critical but stable condition in Parkview Hospital in Fort Wayne, a hospital spokesman said Tuesday afternoon. She was flown to Parkview from the scene of the accident on Interstate 69 in Fort Wayne. 
Office of Information Technologies phones have been deluged with calls from people inquiring about McAdams' con­dition, A'lsociate Provost Gordon Wishon said. 
"We're just devastated to learn of the accident," said Wishon, who is OJT's chief information officer. "Patricia is such a valued member of our family and the whole Notre Dame family." 
The accident occurred just after 10 p.m. Sunday night. McAdams was standing outside her parked car, between the pas­senger's side door and the guardrail, when a passing car lost control and struck her car, The Journal Gazette of Fort Wayne reported Monday. McAdams was then struck by

Hoek Band oll'ernd the per-feet solution to my subconscious yearn­ings to lm a superstar. 
The iclna of my voice amplified to 120 decibels -whether in Madison Square Garden or my tiny room in Fisher Hall -excited me beyond belief'. 
Once American Gladiators was over Monday night, we went to work. It took three of us 20 minutes to decipher the destinations of the myriad wires and plugs befim1 we got going, but once we did, it was glorious. 
Crnating our characters otlemd me anothnr escape from reality. My pale, skinny, 5-foot-11 frame has never exactly intimidated anyone. But my muscular 6-fiJOt-8 alter-ego, with his purplish-yellow mohawk, ripped jeans and tight black T-shirt. scams the beje­sus out of people. 
When our band. Alliteration, got its first gig, palpable tension rippled through the room. On our first song, Weezer's "Say It Ain't So," that tension crackml; we failed miserably. The crowd throw things on stage in protest. But the loss of a few fans eould not d11ter us. 
We soon masternd our respective trades, and began to rock. We now play "Say It Ain't So" bPtter than Weezer Pver eould. And don't even think about Hadiolwad's "Creep;" thanks to a cameo by our RA, who busted out 98 percent of the notes correctly, you would swear Thorn Yorke was in the room. 
Whether I pound out a beat on the drums or anchor the tune with a steady ba<>s groove or unleash a powerful ren­dition of Metallica's "Enter Sandman," I feel like I'm a part of something. I'm a cog in a gear, a piece of a puzzle, a quarter of a string quartet. If that quar­tet could replicate Nine Inch Nails flaw­lessly. 
What's more, I'm surrounded by superior talent. My friends are all more fake-musically inclined than I am, so Alliteration ha'> nowhere to go but up. We'll be taking home Electromusic Grammys in no time. 
We tore up the States-Chicago, Seattle, IA, NYC-so we took our act overseas. We hit Stockholm, Amsterdam and London and shredded them too. We won a van, played charity gigs (fi~r the kids). stole groupies and earned a manager and bodyguards. We're living the dream, playing Mark Wahlbnrg in our real-life version of Hock Star. 
Hock Band brings out the best in peo­ple. You're never so connected to some­one as when you'rn crammed elbow to elbow eranking out great tunes. 
Want proof it can elevate people to another level? I just watched my inebri­ated bandmate stumble across his room and f~tll helplessly beneath his futon. But as I write this, he's playing the drums like Charlie Watts in London. 
All in a day's work for a roek star.

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 
Group w-ill a111end docu111ent 
Goal is to 'refresh' student government at SMC, Hodges says 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY 
News Wri[er 
The Board of Governance Constitution may see some changes this semester in order to improve student govern­ment, chief of staff Sarita Fritzler said at Tuesday's meeting. 
In the group's first meeting of the semester, revising the document was the primary focus. 
In order to refresh the board, student body pres­ident Kim Hodges said this semester members would "take [the constitu­tion] apart piece by piece." The constitution includes the jobs and job descriptions of the board. The board will do evalua­tions and review, correct and update the docu­ment. 
Once members have made the necessary cor­rections, the document will be presented to the Constitutional Review Committee for approval. BOG must then consent to the changes made by the review committee. 
These changes are the board's attempt to improve the student gov­ernment by trying to ensure that the execu­tives and commissioners are getting their jobs done, Fritzler said.

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Members discuss allocation of funds 
By JOSEPH McMAHON

In a short, sparsely attended meeting, the Council of Representatives started the new semester with a discussion on the review and allocation of 
funds made by the Financial Management Board (FMB). 
The FMB, which is com­posed of all the treasurers of the organizations represented by COR, was pleased with the fiscal responsibility of all groups involved and made only sever­al small changes to its original 
plans for the spring allocation. 
"It was our job to evaluate the spending of each organization and to make sure everyone is being fiscally responsible," said junior Kadeja Gaines, the Student Union treasurer and FMB member. The group was pleased with its findings, Gaines said. 
Gaines pointed to the Off­Campus Council as an example, which returned $500 that it felt it no longer needed. In addition, the Club Coordination Council received an extra $826 and the Student Union Board received an additional $7,000.

Bush: Oil prices threaten US economy 
RIYADH. Saudi Arabia -President Bush warned Tuesday that surging oil prices threaten the U.S. economy and urged OPEC nations to boost their output. His plea drew little sympathy from oil-rich Sauru Arabia, which said production levels appear normal. 
Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also pressed Arab countries to do more to reach out to Israel and help achieve a Mideast peace agreement before the president's term runs out next January. Avoiding specific orders to Arab allies, Rice said the delicate question of ruplomatic relations with Israel, the Arab world's historical enemy, was "another matter and undoubtedly down the road." 
Taliban targets restaurants in Kabul 
KABUL-The Taliban said Tuesday that its sui­cide bombers would attack restaurants where Westerners eat in Kabul, an ominous new threat that forced American and European workers to restrict outings in the Afghan capital. 
The country's intelligence chief linked Monday's deadly attack on the Serena Hotel -a well­guarded, high-proftle property in Kabul frequent­ed by Westerners -to a Pakistani militant. Afghan officials arrested four people, and said they included one of the three attackers, who was disguised in a police uniform for the assault. 
The death toll in the bombing and shooting attack on the hotel rose to eight. An American, a Norwegian journalist and a Filipina who rued of her wounds Tuesday were among those killed. 
"We will target all these restaurants in Kabul where foreigners are eating," Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told The Associated Press by telephone.

Myanmar refugees flee to Fort Wayne 
FORT WAYNE -Northeastern Indiana chari­ties bracing for another wave of refugees fleeing Myanmar's repressive regime say $133,000 in grants from Catholic Charities will help provide health care to the often sickly new arrivals. 
Catholic Charities, the local State Department­approved refugee-sponsoring agency, expects about 30 refugees to arrive in Fort Wayne in early February from Myanmar, also known as Burma. 
Those arrivals will be the first of an estimated 800 to 1,000 new refugees from Myanmar who will settle in the city this year, said Debbie Schmidt, executive director of Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Fort Wayne/South Bend. 
"We have a massive amount of refugees com­ing in," said Schmidt, who was in Washington, D.C., last week to lobby for additional aid for Catholic Charities and other local agencies serv­ing the refugees. 
Romney wins Michigan primary 
Candidate's victory reinvigorates presidential campaign, fuels Republican race 
Associated Press 

DETROIT -Mitt Romney scored his first major pri­mary victory Tuesday, a des­perately needed win in his native Michigan that gave his weakened presidential candidacy new life. It set the stage for a wide-open Republican showdown in South Carolina in just four days. 
Three GOP candidates now have won in the first four states to vote in the 2008 primary season, roil­ing a nomination fight that lacks a clear favorite as the race moves south for the first time. 
The former Massachusetts governor defeated John McCain, the Arizona senator who was hoping that inde­pendents and Democrats would join Republicans to help him repeat his 2000 triumph here. Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, trailed in third, and former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson is making a last stand in South Carolina. 
"It's a victory of optimism over Washington-style pes­simism," Romney said in an Associated Press telephone interview from Southfield, Mich., echoing his campaign speeches and taking a poke at McCain, the four-term senator he beat.

The program -which was first a subset of the Center for Social Concerns, and later part of Hobinson Learning Center ­receives significant support from the Notre Dame community.

"One of the things about Take Ten that we stress to the volun­teers is that it is flexible," she said. "The students have creativi­ty, and they can put some of their own input into the curriculum." 
At the end of the program, the volunteers evaluate the students' growth and receive input from the teachers. 
"The way the curriculum works, we have an evaluation process in place. We give a pre­and post-test to see if the kids are actually learning what we teach them," Kyes said. "Our research shows that we are making some changes in their minds, and the teachers think that the climate is better because of the program." 
Kyes also believes that the Notre Dame volunteers get as much out of the program as the students do. 
"One of the side effects that comes out of Take Ten is that a lot of the college student<> end up forming mentorships with the kids. They build a relationship with a child," Kyes said.

IN BRIEF Supreme Court rules against investors 
WASHINGTON -The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday against investors who sue businesses that help manipulate stock prices of publicly traded companies. 
In a 5-3 decision that split along conserva­tive-liberal lines, the court gave a measure of protection from securities lawsuits to suppli­ers, banks. accountants and law firms that do business with corporations engaging in securi­ties fraud. 
The ruling comes at a pivotal point for a sim­ilar class-action lawsuit covering more than a million shareholders who invested in scandal­ridden Enron Corp. Stockholders in Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, are seeking more than $30 billion from Wall Street investment banks, alleging they schemed with Enron to hide its financial problems. "This is a very anti-investor opinion and it could severely impact the ongoing Enron case," said Patrick Coughlin, lead attorney for Enron investors. 
Retailers experience decline in sales 
WASHINGTON -Consumer spending, the critical bulwark that has kept the country out of recession, is showing signs of cracking. Retail sales plunged by 0.4 percent last month as consumers handed retailers their worst Christmas in five years. Consumers have been battered by a sinking housing market, rising unemployment and the credit crunch. 
The Commerce Department's sales report Tuesday was just the latest in a string of weak­er-than-expected numbers that have econo­mists worried that the current economic expansion, now in its seventh year, could be in danger of faltering. 
Analysts said the worry is that all the prob­lems weighing on the economy could prompt consumers -who account for two-thirds of economic activity -to sharply limit or even stop shopping. Already, consumer confidence has slipped significantly amid the oil price spi­ral and the continuing housing slump. At the same time, some of the nation's biggest finan­cial institutions have reported billions of dol­lars in losses stemming from a meltdown in the mortgage market. 
Citigroup reports $10 billion loss 
Company suffers worst deficit in history; economic data suggests impending recession 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Bad bets on mortgages drove a $10 billion loss for Citigroup Inc. in the last three months of 2007. the worst in its 196­year history, adding to a wave of weak economic data pointing toward a recession. 
The nation's largest bank also announced Tuesday it had cut 4,200 jobs and slashed its dividend, and the poor performance forced Citi to turn to foreign investors for an infusion of cash. 
The news helped drag the Dow .Iones industrial aver­age down more than 277 points and wiped out almost $10 billion in market value in Citigroup stock alone. Shares in the bank skidded 7 percent to a new five-year low. 
The biggest hit came from a $1 9.1 billion writedown in the value of the bank's investment portfolio. But it also set aside $4 billion Tuesday to cover anticipated losses on loans to U.S. con­sumers -a sign that deflat­ed home prices, high energy and food costs and rising unemployment are making it difficult for many cus­tomers to keep up with their payments. further this year and by a mortgage and housing quarter results were "unac­

New Trump tower's construction stopped 
New York buildings commissioner halts building's progress after a worker plummets 40 stories to his death 
Associated l'ress 
NEW YOHK Donald Trump introduced the gleam­ing Trump Sollo on his TV show "The Apprentice" and hosted a red-carpet press event in the half-built sky­scraper four months ago, announeing that it was already a big suceess.

The victim was identified as Yurly Vanschytskyy, whose age was not available. Two other workers were hospital­ized with serious injuries. The accident happened when forms used to pour concrete somehow gave way while a crane was helping with the job. 
The workers were doing what amounts to some of the most dangerous work any­where -toiling with heavy equipment hundreds of feet above the city. A man wash­ing windows late last year miraculously survived after plunging almost 500 feet

The Trump SoHo project received several violations in the last year, although Lancaster acknowledged it's common for big building projects to receive numerous citations. 
In one case, neighbors reported that a crane hoist­ing steel rods swung and hit a nearby building. In anoth­er, a neighbor said a crane hit her building and broke a window. Last month, the builders were cited after a neighbor said a erane acci­dentally dumped cement on a neighboring property. 
The new Trump tower on the western edge of the artsy Sollo enclave has been con­troversial from the start, in part because it is several times the height of surround­ing industrial structures. 
Sehed uled to open in spring 2009, it is being mar­keted as a condo hotel. Buyers of the units will be permitted to stay in them for no more than 120 days in a year; the rooms will be rent­ed to hotel guests the rest of the time. 
The arrangement was negotiated with city officials because new apartment buildings are prohibited by the area's zoning, but hotels are allowed.

Freedom in decline, survey says 
World study shows 2.4 billion people in 56 countries are not free 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Freedom declined in 2007 for a second consecutive year as 36 per­cent of the people in the world -about half of them in China -were not living in freedom, according to a sur­vey by a private democracy watchdog organization. 
Nearly four times as many countries showed significant declines during the year as registered improvements, the New York-based Freedom House reported. While the number of countries judged not free declined by two to 43 last year "there were many and overwhelmingly negative changes within countries already designated not free," the survey found. 
The number of' countries judged free stood at 90, rep­resenting 4 7 percent of the world's 193 countries, and those considered partly free stood at 60, or 31 percent. 
Those found not free accounted for nearly 2.4 bil­lion people, about half of them living in China. 
Expectations of government concessions on human rights or modest democratic reforms in advance of the 2008 Summer Olympics did not pan out in China, where the regime continued to crack down on political activists, Internet journalists and human rights lawyers, the report said. 
Reversals in freedom were seen in one-fifth of the world's countries, including Pakistan, Kenya, Egypt, Nigeria and Venezuela. One country, Mauritania, joined the list of democracies, while three, the Philippines, Bangladesh and Kenya, dropped off it. 
Two countries, Thailand and Togo, were upgraded from not free to partly free. 
South Asia, the former Soviet Union and the Middle East did particularly poorly, giving "an alarming signal about the development of freedom worldwide, some­thing formerly viewed as inevitable," said Jennifer Windsor, executive director of Freedom House. 
Four stark reminders of the perilous condition of freedom were singled out: 
-Parliamentary elections in Hussia were held under patently unfair conditions. 
-Democracy in Georgia was sullied by imposition of a state of emergency and a vio­lent police crackdown on demonstrators. 
-In Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto was assassinated, and terrorism by Islamic extrem­ists rose. 
-In Kenya, hundreds were killed in rioting in the wake of "highly credible reports of vote-rigging by the govern­ment" in the country's presi­dential election. 
in Hussia, political parties 

and candidates who chal­lenged President Vladimir Putin were sidelined, and the news media, largely con­trolled by the state and Putin's supporters, gave over­whelming coverage to the president and his allies while the opposition was kept frag­mented and tame. 
Using its enormous oil and gas resources, Hussia exerts influence in former Soviet republics, providing political, moral and material support to authoritarian regimes that dominate Central Asia, the report said. 
Three of the countries in the region, Belarus, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, have consis­tently ranked among the world's most repressive soci­eties, Freedom House said. 
Modest gains in the Middle East, where President Bush focused his hopes for demo­cratic change, carne to an end last year, the report said, with major declines in both the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli-occupied territo­ries. 
The Authority was down­rated from partly free to not free, due to the collapse of a unified government after Barnas took over Gaza. Israel's military incursions, restrictions on delivery of food and violent dispersal of protests led to a decline in civil liberties, Freedom House said. 
Bridge collapse caused by error 
-Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Steel 
plates connecting beams in the 
Interstate 35W bridge in 
Minneapolis were too thin by 
half and fractured, "the criti­
cal factor" in the collapse that 
killed 13 people and injured 
145, the National 
Transportation Safety Board 
said Tuesday. 

The connectors, called gus­set plates, were roughly half the l-inch thickness they should have been because of a design error, NTSB Chairman Mark Hosenker said. Investigators found 16 frac­tured gusset plates from the bridge's center span. 
"It is the undersizing of the design which we believe is the critical factor here. It is the critical factor that began the process of this collapse. That's what failed," Hosenker said at a news conference. 
What caused the bridge to collapse during rush-hour traf­fic in the early evening of Aug. 1 -"the straw that broke the camel's back," as Rosenker put it-was not yet known, he said. A final report by the NTSB was expected this fall. 
The Minneapolis span was a steel-deek truss bridge that opened in 1967. Rosenker said it wasn't clear how the design flaw made it into the bridge because investigators couldn't fmd the design calculations. 
The bridge was called "frac­ture critical," or lacking redundancies, meaning that a failure of any number of struc­tural elements would cause the entire bridge to collapse. 
Rosenker said the safety board had no evidence that the deficiencies in the Minneapolis bridge design "are widespread or go beyond this bridge." 
However, the NTSB couldn't discount the possibility of simi­lar errors in other like bridges, he said, and cautioned that states and contractors should look at the original design cal­culations for such bridges before they undertake "future operational changes." The NTSB issued a safety recom­mendation to the Transportation Department's Federal Highway Administration suggesting that the agency require bridge owners to do so. 
Transportation Secretary Mary Peters called on states to calculate how changes in bridge weight, capacity or evolving bridge conditions will affect gusset plates."With a few calculations, we can help reassure travelers that our bridges remain safe," Peters said in a statement. 
Rosenker noted that struc­tural weight had been added to the Minneapolis bridge in two major renovations, in the 1970s and 1990s.

After returning home from another wildly unsuecessl'ul Las Vegas trip two weeks ago, I had the misfortune of watehing most of the ABUFaeebook debate between the leading Hepubliean contenders. The live "mainstream" can­didates sparred f(w an hour and a half' in what looked like a eompetition for the crown of village idiot. Fortunately, ABC News decided to also indude Hon Paul, the ten-term Congressman from Texas, in order to introdueP. some rationality into the debate. 
One ineident in partieular stands out in my mind. The moderator, Charlie Gibson, said that our foreign poliey used to be based upon defensn, rathP.r than oll'ense. America would form allianees and would only 1mgage another eountry militarily with international consensus. America would not initiate hostilities; America would only attack if' attacked. I lowever, America abandoned this poliey in favor of preemptive war with the invasion of Iraq by thP Bush Administration. To use the words of the moderator, the "Bush Doctrinp," meant that the U.S. has "a right to a pn~-ernptive attack, that we ean attack if this country feels threat­ened." It was on this basis that the U.S. invaded Iraq. Gibson then asked each candidate whether his agreed with the Bush Doctrine. 
In response, Ron Paul said that he fully supported the foreign policy that helped elect Bush in 2000, namely a humble for­eign policy, no nation building, and minding our own business. In fact, he reminded the Republieans that they were very critical of Bill Clinton's involvement in Kosovo and bombing oflraq. Aecepting the Bush Doctrine would be the first time in our nation's history that 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 

we accepted as our policy that we start 
the wars. 

Paul then said the real issue of the 
campaign is the nature of terrorism, 
specilieally why the terrorists hate 
America so much that they would sacri­
liee their own lives to kill innocent 
American civilians. It is not because we 
are free or prosperous. It is because the 
United States invades Middle Eastern 
countries, occupies their eountries, has 
bases in their countries and holy land, 
props up di<tatorial regimes and has 
been doing so for over fifty years. It is 
because they object to our continued 
presence and influence in their internal 
afTairs. Osama bin Laden told the world 
after Septembnr 11th that "I swear to 
God that America will not live in peace 
beforn all thn army of infidels depart the 
land of' the prophet Muhammad." Our 
bases in Saudi Arabia were the excuse 
for that day. 

But surely, no one with even half' a 
brain could object to the argument that 
U.S. foreign policy is the motivating fac­tor in terrorism against the United States'? Wrong. Every single one of' the 
other eandidates rejected this self-evi­
dent line of reasoning. Paul's comments 
snt on· a ten minute long heated but sadly 
amusing exchange in which every other 
candidate argued against the obvious. 
Mitt Homney blamed terrorist attacks not on U.S. foreign poliey, but on "radical jihad" that is trying to take down every government and replace them with radi­cal Islamic theoeraeies. Pretend that Homney is correct and the real reason that the terrorists attack Ameriea is their desire to institute Islamic theocracies around the world. If this is their goal, why then aren't they trying to bring down China, Luxenbourg or Sweeden? Indeed, how does attacking America in any way help them to institute an Islamic theocracy in America? If U.S. foreign pol­icy has nothing to do with why they attack us, then isn't atheist China a more guilty target that the U.S.? Isn't it obvious that the main targets of terrorism -the U.S., Israel, England, and Spain-were 
supporters of U.S. foreign policy in the 
Middle East? Appanmtly not. As Paul 
said later in the debate, the question 
they are unwilling to ask is why is it that 
they attack Ameriea but not others. 
Thompson dedared his support for the Bush Doctrine. Giuliani then said that Paul's analysis of the situation was "seri­ously flawed" and then stated that the terrorism threat that America faces "has nothing to do with our foreign policy" and is "completely irrelevant." Seriously. 
Paul asked them to visualizn how we would feel if China came from halfway around the world and said "We want you to live like us. We want you to have our economic system. We want bases on your land." Clearly, America would be furious, and rightfully so. Hather than respond, Homney maturely accused Paul of' "read­ing their propaganda." Hw:kabee then agreed with Romney's position. 
It is a sad testament to the Hepubliean Party that someone who says that tho threat of' terrorism has absolutely noth­ing to do with the United Statns' foreign policy could possibly be taken seriously. Not only are Giuliani and his lilllow goons taken seriously. they represent the mainstream of the party. Meanwhiln, tlw only man who actually represents the things Hepublicans routinely pay lip service to-fnderalism, free trade, low taxes, cutting spending, sound money, balanced budgets, deregulation. the Constitution, freedom and poaco -is about as popular as a wet !'art in a sauna within Hepublican Party establishmnnt. Ron Paul is too honest for his own good, and the liars around him know it. America deserves better than them.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Finding happiness 
I fear for the future of our generation. For some reason it seems that it has become cool to become "chill"-to just not care. I fear that we have created a new mantra for our generation: "Shun the soul who cares too much. Relax. Put out the fire." And we wonder why, five years down the road, we feel our lives are empty as we dread Monday through Friday just to get to the glorious weekend. 
Happiness was a philosophical college dream. How often do you go on vacation from school or work, hoping that that is where you can fmd happiness? And when you come back to "real life," does it hurt when you realize that true, lasting happi­ness has evaded you once again? As you awake in your bed, it is again Monday. And you think two things: "I cannot wait to get back here. I cannot wait until the week­end." The weekend arrives and you are only saddened that it has not come sooner. Happiness? Please, I am just trying to sur­vive the week. As if we were meant to squander away our lives merely surviving. 
Where do we find this happiness that often seems so fleeting and elusive? It is not to be found in some far off vacation time on the calendar of tomorrows. Rather, it is to be found today and it is to be found within you! It is to be found in the grateful discovery and humble exploitation of the gifts that God has hardwired into your own heart. Never surrender your spirit to those unspoken, yet potent societal rules that hold you to the standard of being lifelessly "chill"-a vicious euphemism that domes­ticates our true and unbridled desires. 
The late theologian Howard Thurman once quipped. "Don't ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive ... what the world needs is people who have come alive." Let that holy fire that burns within you be visible through the song of your life. Fire spreads. So light your candle now and find that incredible life that awaits you.

I want 1 Heroes' back, but I'm on their side 

I think it would be super cool to be a television writer. They get to create all the amazing shows we watch and become addicted to. You know that deep do\\-n you cannot focus on day-to-day life without having your weekly dose of "Grey's Anatomy," "Heroes," "John Stewart" or "Family Guy." Yes, there is that underlying motivation to promote the writers' cause because we so

strike? It is important to understand why

East

inherently affects us all. According to the 
Carolinian

Writers' Guild of America, the studios are depriving the writers of these hit television shows, along with those of talk shows and late night programs, of their proper compensation considering the rise in television DVD sales, Internet promotions on iTunes and other web sources, and the networks' allowing shows to be posted on studio websites. 
According to recent news releases, Tina Fey ("30 Rock"), Tim King ("Heroes"), Seth McFarlane ("Family Guy"), Matthew Perry ("Friends") and dozens of other actors who support writers stormed the picket lines, and unfortunately, the networks are not understand­ing. Seriously? How can they not? 
The writers are the most imperative part of a television show. Without them, there would be no witty jokes, no sappy love stories and no quirky nerds stealing the hearts of the nation. Writers work their creative minds off to provide the general public with some ounce of culture, and the networks repay them by undercutting their genius with lacking compensation. 
The networks say they will not consider negotiations until the strik­ers return to work, whereas the picketers refuse to return without talking first. It is a game of chicken, and we would all like to see the writers win. The movie industry will not suffer because the studios have screenplays stacked up from years past, and they can choose from the scripts they already paid for. Even then, screenplay writers join the ranks and walk the lines. The Director's Guild of America contains numerous writers and directors walking the picket line, so it is hard to understand why they are being stubborn and refusing to talk (*cough* greed *cough*). 
Despite my desire to enter the television writing field, it is the ethi­cal obligation to side with the writers because they are underappreci­ated for their hard work, and if the actors are acknowledging them, so should the rest of us. 
In addition, regardless of the fact that it would pave a smoother way for aspiring television writers of the future, it means our shows could enjoy full-length seasons. I don't know about you, but if I have to be left hanging as to whether or not HRG and Claire find each other again on "Heroes," I am not going to be a happy camper.

CA~T & ~CRIPT MAKE 

ONE OF THE BEfiT OF 2007 
By T. EDWARD ANDREWS Scene Editor 
Whether talking on her hamburger phone, slurping down massive blue slurpees or puking them back up in her stepmom's favorite pottery, free-wheeling Juno MacGuff {Ellen Page) finds herself faced with the same problems as any other high-school junior stuck in suburban America: homework, gossiping girls and battling boredom. 
However, after an in-chair sexual encounter with then-boyfriend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera), Juno fmds herself immersed in a very adult situation, cour­tesy of a copious amount of Sunny Delite and the unanticipated results of a pregrmn­cy test: She's expecting. 
"Juno" follows its titular character as she navigates the nine months and several sea­sons of her pregnaney, dealing with boy troubles, the mean stares of high school mean girls and fmding a way to secure a future for her unborn child. 
Rookie of the year and stripper-turned­screenwriter Diablo Cody excels in her debut effort, providing "Juno's" talented and deep east with a lively, snappy script that gives every actor in it memorable lines and good material. 
Like Ms. Cody herself, in Juno she has created a larger-than-life dynamo \Nith a name to match. As Juno says while her mounting pregnancy eauses her waistline to balloon, ''I'm a planet." Everything in the film revolves around her, and Ellen Page delivers the goods as a sarcastic small­town girl with a big mouth. Although her quips and quirks project Juno's carefree attitude, Page manages to convey an inno­cence and sensitivity even as Juno compen­sates for the difficulty of her pregnancy with her over-the-top antics. She remains every bit a teenager stuck in a tough situa­tion. At times cynical, crass but always pre­cocious, Juno MacGuff doesn't take guff from anyone, but she does need the sup­port of her friends and family. 
Michael Cera continues to amuse audi­ences and make them laugh with his awk­ward on-screen antics as Juno's boyfriend Paulie Bleeker, a dedicated cross-country runner with a penehant for orange Tic Tacs and a knack for impregnating his girl­friend. Cera also manages to show some skin onscreen in sporting a pair of rather revealing short shorts to better display his pasty runner's thighs. 
Rounding out the cast are comedy sta­ples Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner as Mark and Vanessa Loring, the yuppie couple that wants to adopt Juno's child. Garner surprises as Vanessa, delivering a convincing and earnest performance as a wannabe mommy. For his part, Bateman does well in a more serious role than his typic,al comedic fare. 
Actor J.K. Sinunons also performs well in a supporting role as Mac MacGuff, Juno's gruff. blue-collar dad who dotes on his 
da_ughter and also may have 
given her that mouth of hers. During a meet-and-greet with Mark and Vanessa Loring, the would-be adop­tive parents of Juno's unborn child, Juno replies that she would like a Maker's Mark bourbon whiskey. Seeing the shocked expression on Vanessa's face, Mac MacGutr quickly explains, "Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor. Just one of her many genetic gifts."

Juno shakes hands with boyfriend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). 
Much like last summer's blockbuster hit "Knocked Up," "Juno" takes the serious su~ject of pregnancy and manages to have fun with it while acknowledging the gravity of the situation. 
Diablo Cody's humorous but heartfelt screenplay can't help but succeed in the hands of a talented cast. With its mix of laughs, romantic comedy and touching moments, "Juno" stands out as one of the best movies of 2007.

10 things I love about 
Juno 
"Juno" is one of my new favorite movies and it could quite possibly crack my sacred top 10 list if it keeps stealing my heart each time I see it 
(that's three  
times so far).  Cassie Belek  
The last  
recent movie  Scene &  
to accomplish  Heard  
such a feat  
was love of my  

life Judd Apatow's "The 40­Year-Old Virgin." I knew I would enjoy "Juno"; I just was­n't expecting to fall in love with the film and all its characters. So while "Juno" fights for a spot on my top 1 0 list of favorite movies, I'll offer another list of the top 10 rea­sons why I love "Juno." 
10. Rollo, the convenience store clerk, portrayed by Rainn Wilson. Wilson is a scene steal­er even in the tiniest of roles. 
9. Juno's hamburger phone. It has to be the coolest on­screen phone since Nickelodeon's "Clarissa Explains it All." 
8. Mark and Vanessa's photos hanging in the stairwell. They are the epitome of yuppy love, and I can't quite get the image of Jason·Bateman's goofy, glee­ful smile out of myhead. · 
7. Michael Cera's legs: Talk about sex appeal. 
6. Jennifer Garner's perform­ance. Garner's portrayal of a yuppy woman wanting a baby isn't to be overlooked. She makes us love and understand her initially icy character, and she has a special knack for making me cry. 
5. When Juno is asked how far along she is, she responds, ''I'm a junior," missing the ref­erence to her pregnancy. Despite Juno's maturity, the film does well in subtly remind­ing us that she is still very much a teenager. 
4. Bren telling off the ultra­sound technician for insulting Juno. The next time someone insults me. I want Allison Janney in my corner. Maybe she could whip out some of that snappy Aaron Sorkin "West Wing" dialogue and hurl it their way. 
3. The soundtrack. With tracks from Kimya Dawson, the Moldy Peaches and Buddy Holly, the music seamlessly floats in and out of the film, setting the tone and adding a bit of whimsy. 
2. The characters' little quirks that make them all so unique: Bren 's obsession with dogs, Bleeker's addiction to orange Tic Tacs and Leah's love for old men expressed by the collage in her bedroom. 
1. Juno's profession of love to Bleeker. She lets herself feel and speaks from the heart without putting up guards or relying on her wit. Honest to blog, it's one of the sweetest "I love you's" in film.

WASHINGTON -Barry Bonds' team should have reported concerns about the home run king's per­sonal trainer to Major League Baseball, com­missioner Bud Selig told Congress on Tuesday during a hearing on the sport's steroids era. 
Even though no players were present, unlike the theatrical March 2005 session, the names of Bonds, seven-time Cy Young Award winner Hoger Clemens and 2002 AL MVP Miguel Tejada all were raised during the 4-hour, 15-minute proceedings prompted by last month's Mitchell 

IN BRIEF 

'Pacman' Jones accused of 
hitting woman in strip club 
NASHVILLE, Tenn.-A woman is seeking an arrest warrant against sus­pended Titans cornerback Adam "Pacman" Jones, claiming he punched her at an Atlanta strip club. 
Fulton County Magistrate Court offi­cials told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Wanda S. Jackson askRd lor the warrant after a Jan. 3 alterca­tion at the Body Tap Strip Club. 
Jackson, an attorney, says she was in the club's office when an angry Jones accused managers of stealing his money and bracelet. Jackson said Jones lunged at her numerous times and then "sucker punched" her in the left eye. 
Jackson did not immediately return a phone message requesting comment. Jones' attorney Manny Arora said no warrant has been issued against Jones. 
Last month Jones pleaded no contest to a disorderly conduct charge related to a strip club shooting in Las Vegas that left one man paralyzed. 
Report. 

Selig and union leader Donald Fehr sat side-by­side before a House com­mittee friendlier in tone than three years ago yet still concerned about how serious baseball is in dealing with its doping problem. 
Before any of Tuesday's testimony, which began with former Senate majority leader George Mitchell appearing for 
two  hours,  House  
Oversight  and  
Government  Reform  

Committee chairman Henry Waxman announced he and rank­ing Republican Tom Davis asked the Justice 
Department to look into whether Tejada lied to committee staffers when questioned in connection to Rafael Palmeiro's per­jury case in 2005. 
Tejada's older brother, Freddy, was killed Tuesday in a motorcycle accident in the Dominican Republic, said the Aguilas Cibaenas, the shortstop's winter league team. Tejada, who had been scheduled to play Tuesday night, wasn't at the ballpark and could 
not  immediately  be  
reached for comment.  
Since  the  release  of

Trinidad and Jones to fight
in New York 
NEW YORK -Felix Trinidad and Roy Jones Jr. will be fighting more than just each other on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden. 
They'll also be fighting percep­tions that both are far past their primes. 
Jones, considered the pound-for­pound king for the better part of a decade, turned 39 this week. He showed up to a news conference at the Garden on Tuesday with a beard that made him appear much older, though he promised to shave it off when he makes weight of 170 pounds. 
He's fought just twice sincn losing an unanimous decision to Antonio Tarver in 2005, both lackluster decisions against lesser opponents. For Jones (51-4, 38 knockouts), this 12-round fight represents one last step before a potential super-mid­dleweight title bout -a road block to a ninth world title. 
scheduled to testify at a separate hearing Feb. 13, along with his former trainer, Brian McNamee, who said he injected Clemens with steroids and human growth hor­mone. 
Clemens has vehement­ly denied the allegations. 
But Bonds was brought up by Waxman, who asked Selig whether the San Francisco Giants should have reported their concerns about Bonds' trainer, Greg Anderson, and the slug­ger's alleged steroid use to the commissioner's office. 
"Of course, Selig responded. 

Duke lacrosse prosecutor
files for bankruplcy 
HALEIGII, N.C.-The disgraced former prosecutor who led the debunked Duke lacrosse rape case filed for bankruptcy Tuesday, citing more than $180 million in liabili­ties -the majority from the threat of two pending lawsuits.Mike Nifong reported $243,898 in assets of real and personal property to 
U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The filing came the same day he and other defendants were required to respond to a sweeping federal law­suit filed in October by the three exonerated players whom Nifong had falsely accused of rape. 
In the lawsuit, attorneys for Heade Seligmann, Collin Finnerty and Dave Evans accuse Nifong, the city of Durham, police investigators and others of conducting "one of the most chilling episodes of pre­meditated police, prosecutorial and scientific misconduct in modern American history."

2016 OLYMPICS 
Chicago reveals Olyinpic plans 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Organizers of the American bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics unveiled details of their plan Tuesday, promising a "spectacular" lake­front experience in the heart of the nation's third-largest city. 
Chicago's plan clusters the majority of venues in four sites near downtown and along the shores of Lake Michigan, the world's fifth-largest lake. Ninety­one percent of athletes would be within 15 minutes or less of their venues, and the Olympic stadium would be a six-minute drive from the village. 
"The plan envisions the games woven into the landscape of Chicago's century-old lakefront and in walking distance," of many cultural and entertain­ment attractions and sports facilities, said Patrick Hyan, chief organizer of Chicago 2016. 
"We believe Chicago promises a spectacular Olympic experi­ence in the center of our city, in the heartland of this great coun­try," Ryan said. 
Details of the plan -which includes 16 new permanent and temporary venues and money to make existing venues Olympic caliber at an estimated cost of $900 million -were included in a questionnaire submitted to the International Olympic Committee and released by Chicago bid organizers. 
It does not include a $1 billion athlete's village, a public-private venture officials said will be built regardless of whether Chicago gets the games. 
Chicago would hold the games July 22-Aug. 7, 2016. The para­lympics would follow Aug. 18­28. 
Chicago 2016 organizers esti­mated the games would gener­ate $2.5 billion in revenue just from domestic marketing, including sponsorships, licensed merchandise and ticket sales. Organizers would give 500,000 free tickets to Chicago school­children. 
"The people of Chicago will experience these games like no people of any Olympic city before them," said Doug Arnot, operations chief for Chicago 2016. 
As Chicago released its bid documents, details also emerged Tuesday about plans for the other six bid cities. 
Tokyo said 95 percent of its competition venues would be within five miles of downtown. Organizers in Madrid, Spain, said the eastern edge of its city would be the focus for the Olympics. There would be 15 competition venues there, and all but five of the 30 venues would be about seven miles from the city center. 
Chicago organizers said their plan for clustering the Games downtown and near Lake Michigan is unique. 
"Compact is one thing, it's where it's compact," Arnot said. "We've taken the very heart of the city and put so much of the games right there. That is unparalleled in any games." 
For example, the trip from the athletes' village to the stadium -that Ryan says during the games would be a six-minute drive because of dedicated Olympic lanes -is at most 14 minutes in normal traffic, according to the bid document. 
Besides Chicago, Tokyo, and Madrid, the other bid cities are Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Baku, Azerbaijan; Doha, Qatar; and Prague, Czech Republic. 

The IOC will whittle the seven applicant cities to an unspecified number of candidate cities in June. The IOC will select the host city in October 2009. 
Chicago's price tag is likely to grow if history is any guide. Costs for the 2012 London Olympics are now more than triple original estimates, topping $19 billion. 
The Chicago bid documents don't give a total price tag for the games, but Ryan said com­parisons to London's ballooning costs aren't fair. London is undertaking a major urban redevelopment as part of its games, including decontaminat­ing land from years of industrial use. 
"Have you been to the East End of London recently? That's been a desolate area for cen­turies. This is a rebuilding of something that is critical to London," Hyan said. 
Of Chicago's 27 venues, 22 already are built or would be temporary structures. The Olympic stadium will carry the biggest expense, costing nearly $386 million in 2007 dollars. But an unidentified developer was part of the design process, and already has committed to build­ing it for that amount. 
The questionnaire submitted to the IOC by Chicago and other bid cities covers everything from competition venues and financ­ing to security and transporta­tion. It's part of the process for the IOC to pick a host city next year. 
Chicago 2016 estimates it will spend $49.3 million in its bid process, and that assumes it will be one of the finalists chosen in June. Ryan pledged all of that money will come from private sources. 

Associated Press 
MELBOUHNE, Australia ­Sick and tired of talk about his stomach bug, Roger Federer wanted to show he was in Grand Slam form. 
He left nobody in doubt. 
The man who has had the No. 1 ranking just about glued to him for almost four years began his bid for a third straight 
Australian Open title Tuesday by doing something he had never done at Melbourne Park. 
He opened the season's first major without dropping a game in the first set at Rod Laver Arena, beating Argentina's Diego Hartfield 6-0, 6-3, 6-0. In eight previous trips to Melbourne, he had never swept the opening set. 
Federer has not played a competitive match in two months. He withdrew from the Kooyong exhibition last week after being told by doctors he had food poisoning, causing speculation about his fitness. 
"I could have maybe played on Saturday, but I didn't want all the fuss -the media, ana­lyzing my game, thinking they know best and all that," Federer said. "I took an extra day. It's tough, but I played a couple of sets out here the last few days and it's paid off." 
Unable to get his usual fine­tuning done at Kooyong, Federer had to settle for doing it in real time. He tested his entire arsenal, mixing his pow­erful backhands and forehands with some rushes to the net, and alternating serves wide and down the line on the new blue surface. 
"Everything was working per­fectly," said Federer, who is 26­1 in the last four Australian Opens and has figured in the last 10 Grand Slam finals. "I never expect a result this extreme obviously, but I was playing well in practice, moving well, serving well, and condi­tions were perfect." 
Just before Federer went on court, things turned violent among spectators during a match between Greece's Konstantinos Economidis and seventh-seeded Fernando Gonzalez of Chile, last year's losing finalist. 
Tournament officials said play was interrupted for five min­utes while police subdued three people with pepper spray. Five were evicted and banned from the venue for at least 24 hours. 
Wimbledon champion Venus Williams played her first match in three years at the Australian Open. She downed China's Yan Zi 6-2, 7-5 but hit 29 unforced errors and only 19 winners. 
"Errors happen," Williams said. "That's tennis." 
She was a first-round loser in 2006 and missed last year because of injuries, watching from a distance when sister Serena made a stunning run to the title. 
Serena Williams, unseeded and ranked No. 81 when she beat top-seeded Maria Sharapova in last year's final, plays Wednesday in the second round against China's Yuan Meng. 
No. 5 Sharapova has the toughest second-round match of the highly ranked players, facing 2000 Australian champi­on Lindsay Davenport in the night match on center court Wednesday. 
Davenport is in her first Grand Slam and only fifth tour­nament since returning to the tour following the birth last June of her son. She needed three sets to beat Italy's Sara Errani in the first round and extend her record to 19-1 since her comeback. 
No. 1 Justine Henin will open on center court against Olga Poutchkova. No. 10 Marion Bartoli, the only player to beat Henin in the last six months ­in the Wimbledon semifmals ­was the highest of four seeded women players ousted in the first round Tuesday, losing to Sweden's Sofia Arvidsson. 
Advancing were No. 2-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova, No. 4 Ana lvanovic, No. 6 Anna Chakvetadze, No. 9 Daniela Hantuchova and No. 14 Nadia Petrova.

Balanced attack helps Hawks hold off Nuggets 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -After Denver's big three was reduced to one, the Nuggets' big comeback against Atlanta ended. 
Carmelo Anthony, Allen Iverson and J.H. Smith com­bined f'or 84 points, but Iverson and Smith wPre ejected with 
38.9 seconds left and the Hawks held of'f a late rally by the Denver Nuggets for a 104-93 victory on Tuesday night. 
lvnrson was railed for turnovers on consecutive pos­snssions in the last 90 seconds, the second with 38.9 seconds left and Atlanta's ltmd down to 8 at 101-93. 
Iverson. who argued that he was routed on each play, protested to ofl1cials and was ejected by official John Goble. Smith joined the argument after the second call and was ejected. 
"I thought it was two no­calls," Iverson said. "I was upset about it. At that juncture or the game, those calls mat­tered. Once you take those two possessions away from us and at the time I didn't think we had the opportunity and I just react­ed the way I reacted." 
Smith caused a stir in the stands when he threw his head­band and jersey into the crowd af'ter leaving the court. 
Anthony scored 36 points, Iverson had 27 and Smith 21. Only two other Denver players scored. Denver had been 12-2 when Anthony scored 27 or more. 
The Hawks won with superior balance. 
Joe Johnson led Atlanta with 22, including 17 in the first half. Marvin Williams scored 19 and Josh Childress 17 as six Atlanta 
players scored in double fig­
ures. 
"We're playing well," Williams said. "We're playing together." 
Iverson appeared to be pushed by Atlanta's Anthony Johnson when he was called for the lirst turnover with 1:27 left. Iverson protested the call but didn't draw a technical. He earned two technicals when arguing his second turnover, again whlm guarded closely by Johnson. 
"It's an obvious push in the back," Iverson said. "Two pos­sessions. I watched it on film. Obviously, two shoves in the back. H's a good thing for their team, they got away with it. I'm pretty sure they're pretty happy about the way those two plays ended." 
Denver coach George Karl said at least one of Goble's turnover calls against Iverson was bad. 
"He got bumped out of bounds on the first one," Karl said. "I don't know about the second one. 
"It was just a young referee made a judgment call that we didn't gain an advantage on. I think the first one made him not call the second one. It's kind of human nature." 
Denver trailed by 25 early in the third quarter but cut the lead to 101-93 on Anthony's fallaway with 1:50 left. 
"A.I. and Carmelo are great players," Childress said. "You know they're going to get theirs, so you have to limit everybody else." 
The Hawks (17 -17) have two straight wins since commission­er David Stern ruled Friday 


NFL 
Carter, Green among Hall of Fa111e finalists 


Associated Press 
CANTON, Ohio -Cris Carter and Darrell Green are finalists in balloting for the Pro Football llall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. 
Carter, a star wide receiver for the Eagles and Vikings, and Hndskins cornerback Green are among 17 finalists who will be considered for nlnetion on Feb. 2, 2008, the day before thP Super Bowl. 
Carter spent 1987-89 with Philadnlphia, then 1990-2001 with Minnesota before ending his career with a season as a Dolphin. In 2000, he became the second player in NFL his­tory to catch 1.000 career passes, behind only Jerry Rice. He finished his career with 1,101 receptions, second on the all-time list; had 130 TD catches, also second; and gained 1,000 yards receiving in eight straight seasons. Carter was a member of the NFL's 1990s all-decade team. 
Green spent all 20 of his seasons in Washington, tying a league record with one team, and played 295 games after being a first-round draft pick in 1983. lie holds the NFL mark with at least one interception in 19 consecutive seasons and made 54 inter­ceptions overall for 621 yards and six TDs. Considered one of the best shutdown corner­backs in football, he also was one of the league's fastest players and a first-rate punt returner. Green also was on the NFL's 1990s team. 
The other finalists, of which a minimum of four candidates and a maximum of seven can be chosen, are 12 modern-era players. They are defensive ends Fred Dean and Richard Dent; linebackers Randy Gradishar, Derrick Thomas and Andre Tippett; guards Russ Grimm, Bob Kuechenberg and Randall McDaniel; punter Ray Guy; wide receivers Art Monk and Andre Reed; and tackle Gary Zimmerman. 
The contributor finalist is former commissioner Paul Tagliabue. The Senior Committee nominees, announced last August, are Chicago Cardinals back Marshall Goldberg and Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Emmitt Thomas. 
To be elected, a finalist must receive a minimum of 80 percent of the 44 votes. 

they must replay the final 51.9 seconds of a Dec. 19 game against the Miami Heat on March 8. 
"As far as I'm concerned, we're over .500," said Hawks coach Mike Woodson. "We'll deal with that in March." 
Woodson's only complaint was his team's sluggish finish against the Nuggets. 
"We have to learn how to fin­ish games strong," he said. "I thought we had some slippage down near the end." 
There were two ties in the opening minutes but Atlanta never trailed. 
Marcus Camby's jam cut the lead to 12 at 97-85 with 4 min­utes left. Anthony Johnson, who had 13 points, and Josh Smith answered with baskets for Atlanta. 
The Nuggets were short­handed and potentially distract­ed. Teammate Nene underwent surgery Monday in Denver to remove a testicular tumor. A biopsy will determine if it was cancerous. 
The Nuggets also were with­out starting forward Kenyon Martin, who returned to the team hotel after having a staph infection on his buttock treated before the game. 
"We gotta deal with what we got," Iverson said. "Nobody's gonna feel sorry for us and we can't feel sorry for ourselves. We understand that we're in a tough situation right now but if we stay together then we can get out of it."

Garrett tneets again for Ravens job 
Associated Press 
OWINGS MILLS, Md. ­Dallas Cowboys offensive coor­dinator Jason Garrett spent more than six hours Tuesday interviewing for the head coaching job of the Baltimore Ravens, but left the team's training facility without filling the vacancy. 
The 41-year-old Garrett was the first person to receive a sec­ond interview for the job, which became open when owner Steve Bisciotti fired Brian Billick on Dec. 31. 
"I had a really productive day today," Garrett said. ''I'm going to continue through this process I'm in right now and at some point we'll make some decisions on both sides." 
Garrett met with Bisciotti, team president Dick Cass and general manager Ozzie Newsome. 
Ravens spokesman Kevin Byrne said, "We had a good day of interviews. It's the start of the second round. We have more interviews for the second round later on in the week." 
Neither Garrett nor the Ravens said a contract had been placed on the table, or that the Cowboys had offered a counterproposal. 
"It was a great day. I had a chance to start this process last week, and was excited to come back and visit again," Garrett said. "It's been an exciting time for me to be here." 
Newsome declined comment, and Bisciotti was not made available. Newsome will be out of town Wednesday, and inter­view sessions could resume as soon as Thursday.

Garrett has attracted interest from the Ravens because of his success in Dallas. In his first season as the architect of the Cowboys' offense, Garrett directed an attack that ranked second in the NFL with 455 points. Quarterback Tony Romo set franchise records with 36 touchdown passes and 4,211 yards passing. 
The Ravens, meanwhile, are looking to cure a stagnant offense that this season ranked 22nd in total yardage and was 24th with 17.2 points per game. In nine years under Billick, the Ravens never ranked higher than 14th in total offense. 
Dallas was third in total offense this season, averaging 
365.7 yards per game. But the Cowboys averaged only 10.5 points in their final four games, including a 21-17 playoff loss to the New York Giants on Sunday that took the luster ofT Dallas' 13-3 record during the regular season. 
Garrett began his second interview with Baltimore on Monday night. He arrived at the team's training complex Tuesday morning with his wife, Brill, and spent much of the day negotiating a deal. 
Garrett has connections to members of the search commit­tee. He and Cass are Princeton graduates. And Garrett's father, Jim Garrett, coached vice presi­dent of football administration Pat Moriarty, when Moriarty was with the Cleveland Browns. 
The Ravens are also interest­ed in Philadelphia Eagles sec­ondary coach John Harbaugh, who was a finalist for the UCLA job that went to former Ravens offensive coordinator Rick Neuheisel.

WVU to investigate missing documents RODRIGUEZ

AP A Mountaineer fan protests Rich Rodriguez's departure from West Virginia at the Fiesta Bowl. After the former coach left for Michigan, 
several football files disappeared. 
Associated Press 
MORGANTOWN, W.Va. ­West Virginia is investigating the disappearance of records associated with the school's football program, a topic the agent for former coach Hich Rodriguez says will be addressed in court documents when the time is right. 
Citing anonymous sources, The Charleston Gazette report­ed Tuesday that files kept in Hodriguez's private office disap­peared between Dec. 16 and Jan. :3, along with strength and conditioning records from the weight room. 
Assistant athletic director Mike Fragalfl told The Associated Press some Iiles are missing but that he does not know what was in them. The athletic department won't have any further comment until its investigation is finished, he said. 
The newspaper report claimed the missing documents included players' personal con­tact information, scholarship payments and class attendance records, as well as strength and conditioning records and photo­graphs that tracked players' physical progress. 
WVU is suing Rodriguez, who accepted the head coaching job at Michigan last month, to col­lect on a $4 million buyout clause in his contract. A response is due in about a week, and agent Mike Brown told The Associated Press late Tuesday that's when his client will respond to most of the accusations in the newspaper report. 
The report has "a lot of misin­formation and untruthful state­ments," Brown said. 
Brown denied Rodriguez kept a personal file on each player and that a strength coordinator took photos of them. Every time players were tested. he added, "those records were given to the head coach and every assis­tant coach." 
That means current head 
coach Bill Stewart should have copies. 
"Regarding the class atten­dance records, I sure hope that West Virginia's compliance and academic office keeps those records because if they don't, they have serious institutional control problems," he said. 
Brown said the university also should have any records involv­ing the finances of the summer camps it ran. 
lie declined to answer ques­tions about whether Rodriguez removed or destroyed docu­ments. 
"There's a process that's now in place that has to be followed" because of the litigation. Brown said. "There is an appropriate time we can make comments and statements in regard to the allegations in the lawsuit and the allegations and statements that have been made by individ­uals in West Virginia." 
Those individuals, he noted, include both Gov. Joe Mancl1in and WVU president Mike Garrison. 
After Rodriguez resigned, Manchin blamed "high-priced agents" for the departure of a West Virginia native who had said his lifelong goal was to coach at his alma mater. 
Since his departure, relatives of Rodriguez say they've been harassed and threatened. His mother, Arleen, said the coach's home was also vandalized. and dozens of groups devoted to her son's downfall have appeared on the Facebook social net­working site. 
Feeding fan fury is that after seven seasons in Morgantown. Rodriguez raided the Mountaineers' program, taking assistant coaches and perhaps reeruits with him, as well as the six-member strength and condi­tioning staff. 
Several wealthy football boosters claim there was behind-the-scenes tension between Rodriguez and the WVU administration, but the coach has yet to publicly dis­cuss the matter.

DAYI'ONA BEACI I, Fla. -Dale Earnhardt .Jr. is aln~ady fnnling thn prnssure, and the season has­n't flVeJl started. 
As his winless stn~ak nnars two years, NASCAH's most popular drivnr knows lw must produeo in his nnw llendriek Motorsports ridn. 
Anxious about the new job and the pressuro of driving for the ditn team, l·:arnhardt showed up a wonk early at prnseason testing just to talk to his rww teammates. 
Back this week to actually drive his No. 88 ChovroiPt, Earnhardt went right to work.

Four months later, he decided to leave his late father's company and embarked on the most fren­zind frnn agency in NASCAR his­tory. Courted by just about every car owner in the industry, he set­tled on Hendrick in June and anxiously awaited switching teams. 
Now that he's officially a Ilcndriek driver, he knows the expectations are immense. Ilnndriek drivnrs won 18 of 36 racns last season. and Johnson is the two-time defending Cup champion.

NFL 
Seahawks coach Holmgren considers future 
Associated Press 
KIRKLAND, Wash. -It only felt like a retirement. 
Mike Holmgren looked nerv­ous. He leaned forward and pushed his hands into the arm­rest of his chair. A half-dozen photographers jostled for posi­tion around him. They flashed at each of the Seattle Seahawks coach's expressions. 
There were smiles. Deadpan stares. And. when reminded how much Seattle wants him to stay, there was obvious emo­tion in reddened eyes and pressed lips. 
'Tm kind of getting the feel­ing you guys are moving me toward the door here," Holmgren, 59. said Tuesday, chuckling during his annual season-ending news confer­ence, which offered more hints that the most successful coach in Seahawks history may retire after 16 seasons. 
Seattle will find out soon. Holmgren said he could decide "perhaps" by next week, after he spends a few days talking with his wife, Kathy, at their home in Arizona. 
"We're going to bang around some stuff and talk about the future. We have our lists [of pros and cons] made up," he said, adding he is or soon will be seeking the advice of Joe Gibbs, Bill Cowher, Bill Parcells and Tony Dungy. 
All have recently retired from coaching or, in Dungy's case with Indianapolis, is consider­ing it. 
Holmgren was speaking three days after Seattle's fifth consec­utive postseason appearance ended with a 42-20 loss to Green Bay in the NFC divisional playoffs. He sees three options for next season: retirement, which he's contemplating for the third consecutive offseason; completion of the final year of the two-year contract he signed soon after the Seahawks' loss in the Super Bowl 23 months ago; or something he prefers over option two, something he called "longer, larger" -a new extension to stay in Seattle. 
When asked if the Seahawks have already offered him a new deal, Holmgren said, "Let's not get too specific." 
"There are very few Joe Paternos around," he said of college football's 81-year-old coach at Penn State. 
"It just takes a lot out of you, so at the end of the season you're tired." 
Holmgren told his players Sunday in a final team meeting that he needed time to clear his head before deciding whether he would return. 
''I've heard talk like that for so long, for so many years with him. I think the best thing we do as football players is we worry about the stuff that we can control," said Pro Bowl quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, for whom Holmgren traded with .Green Bay to make him Seattle's starter in 2001. 
"Obviously, Coach knows how we feel about him. He's meant a lot to the turnaround of this franchise." 
His record with Green Bay and Seattle, where he arrived in 1999, is 170-110, one win behind Gibbs for lOth in NFL history. Holmgren is 86-68 in nine seasons with Seattle. He passed Chuck Knox this season for most victories by a Seahawks coach. 

Seattle won its fourth consec­utive NFC West title in 2007 and will return the core of its team next season. Five of the Seahawks' six division titles have come with Holmgren. 
Yet Holmgren said maybe, after seven years and two Super Bowls in Green Bay and another Super Bowl appear­ance in Seaitle, it's time for someone else. 
The nearest and most quali­fied someone else is former Falcons coach Jim Mora, now a Seahawks assistant. Mora was due to leave Wednesday for Washington to interview for the head job with the Hedskins. 
Holmgren acknowledged all his assistant coaches are "in a little limbo," too. 
"In fairness to everybody, there's also a time where maybe it's time for someone else to get you over the hump," Holmgren said of the Seahawks, who are without a league title since their incep­tion in 1976. 
"You start thinking, 'Are they still listening to me? Am I still as effective as I once was?"' 
It's the most open he's been in discussing retirement, which he has hinted for months he may do this offseason. 
But, he emphasized, he has­n't decided anything. Yet. 
"It's not going to be a long thing. Just bear with me a little bit," he said. 
Holmgren also announced leading receiver Deion Branch will have knee surgery that's likely to keep him out past next season's opener. 
Branch sought the second opinion this week of noted spe­cialist Dr. James Andrews, who confirmed the team's diagnosis of a torn anterior cruciate liga­ment in Branch's left knee. Andrews will perform the sur­gery in Alabama "soon," Holmgren said. The coach esti­mated that the former Super Bowl MVP, injured early in the loss to the Packers, will miss at least nine months. 

Shaun Alexander, the league MVP two seasons ago who just finished his least productive season as a starter, will have surgery to repair the left wrist he broke in the season opener. It never healed under the cast with which he played the rest of the season, as doctors hoped. 
Holmgren also said All-Pro left tackle Walter Jones, who turns 34 Saturday, is likely to have surgery on his chronically sore left shoulder for the sec­ond consecutive offseason. 
As for his own health, Holmgren scoffed at Sunday's revelation from linebacker Julian Peterson that the coach had a gall bladder problem this season. 
The coach said health is not a factor in the decision on his future. 
"No, I'm good.... I feel fine," Holmgren said. 

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Boston College upsets Hurricanes in 21st straight series win 

Associated Press 
BOSTON -Tyrelle Blair blocked five shots against Miami, and that was enough to make the Hurricanes worry about him every time they put the ball up. 
"I think he changed more shots than he blocked," Boston College coach AI Skinner said after the Eagles beat No. 21 Miami 76-66 on Tuesday night. "That's probably as impor­tant." 
Blair had 11 points and 12 rebounds to go with his blocks, and Rakim Sanders scored 20 points to lead BC to its 13th consecutive victory over the Hurricanes. Tyrese Rice had 14 points, eight rebounds and six assists as BC (12-4, 3-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) beat a ranked opponent for the first time since last February. 
Jack McClinton scored 20 points on 6-for-26 shooting for Miami, which had won consec­utive games since it lost to Winthrop on Dec. 29 to snap a season-opening 12-game win­ning streak. James Dews scored 15 points for the Hurricanes (14-2, 1-1), who would have tied the best start in school history with a win. 
The Eagles had lost two of three -a 25-point defeat to No. 3 Kansas and another that was even more embarrassing: 57-51 at home to Robert Morris last Monday. 
"Coach called us out after the Kansas game," Rice said. "We took it to heart. We tried to prove that we could be better than people think we can." 
Boston College scored 14 of the first 16 points and led 50­27 with 11:26 to play before McClinton hit a 3-pointer to start a 23-10 run that pulled Miami back into the game. He had 13 points in all over the five-minute span, including three 3-pointers. 
The Hurricanes were still down 68-58 with 3:13 left, but despite their full-court pres­sure and fouling they couldn't get any closer than nine points. BC hit 14 of 18 free throws down the stretch. 
"We obviously got off to a slow start. They just took it to us," Miami coach Prank Haith said. "Rakim Sanders was amazing. Blair just intimidated our guys. The first two plays of the game, we tried to get the ball inside. We need to get the ball inside, but Blair affected us." 
It was BC's first victory over a ranked opponent since it beat then-No. 16 Virginia Tech last Feb. 3. 
Miami, which leads the ACC in 3-point percentage, was just 8-of-26 from beyond the arc, making 3-of-13 in the first half. Miami missed its first 13 3­point attempts in Saturday's victory over Georgia Tech, and missed 14 of its first 15 shots overall against BC. 
"We came out with a noncha­lant attitude and didn't execute as well as we should have. That attitude put us in a hole," McClinton said. "It's on us. There's really nothing the coaches can do. We have to prepare for the challenge." 
In November, BC snapped a 15-game losing streak against Miami in football -its first vic­tory over tho Hurricanes since the "Hail Plutie" pass ended one of the greatest games in college history. But Miami's chances of ending its losing streak against BC in basketball disappeared quickly. 
The Hurricanes missed their first five shots before McClinton hit a jumper, while Boston College scored the first eight points of the game and opened a 14-2 lead with 13:21 left in the first half. 
The Eagles made it 20-4 before the Hurricanes strung some offense together, cutting the deficit to 20-1 0 on two 3­pointers by Dews. BC took a 17 -point lead on John Oates' 3­pointer with just under 2 min­utes left and led 36-22 at half­time. 
Miami shot 26.5 percent (9­for-34) in the first half, making 3-of-13 from 3-point range, and totaling just three assists as a team.

The Belles started their break with a loss to undefeat­ed Hope, the top-ranked team in the MIAA. Saint Mary's con­tinued with two wins against North Park and Kenyon and a loss to Otterbein to close out 2007. 
"Our team has seen some very good competition over the holiday break, both in and out of conference play," Belles head coach Jennifer Henley said.

Saint Mary's had one meet over winter break -a dual meet against unbeaten Hope -and fell to the Flying Dutch 
In the Jan. 11 meet. Hope was able to win 10 of the 16 events and moved its record to a perfect 5-0 overall and 4-0 in dual meets. 
Meanwhile, the Belles dropped to 5-2 overall and 2­1 in dual meets on the year. 
The meet started out elose, but Hope was able to win seven consecutive events to seal the victory. Although it is the first season of diving for Saint Mary's after a two-year hiatus, Leah Bocinsky was able to win the three-meter diving competition, finishing as one of the strongest com­petitors in the meet. 
Senior captain Kelly Tighe won the individual 200-yard race with a time of 2:29 to win that event for the Belles. Another strong finisher was fellow captain Melissa Gerbeth, who won the 500­yard freestyle with a time of 5:26.

But llarangody said the Irish rwver questioned their ability to grind out the win. 
"We're a confident group and snven points isn't anything to us," llarangody said. "Everyone on the team knows what we're capable of." 
TIHl Irish displayed their propensity for scoring in bunches in the second half. 
With 14:30 left, llarangody made a short jumper to cap an 11-0 Notre Dame run and give the Irish a 4X-42 lead. The Irish never allowed Cincinnati to dose the gap to fewer than three points the rest of the game and led by as many as 19. 
To the delight of the Joyce Center crowd. Irish sophomore guard Jonathan Peoples threw down a breakaway dunk with four seconds left in the game. 

"lie pumped his shoes up, I guess," Jackson said of his tnamrnate's aerial mmwuver. "He had the air-pumps on." 
The Irish shot 6-of-25 from the field in the opening frame, and no player for either team scored more than seven points in the first half. 
But Brey said the team closNI the game wnll enough to leave him confident for Saturday's showdown with No. 5 Gnorgntown in Washington, D.C. 
"I look at it always as the glass half-full," Brey said. "We just played a great half before we go play Georgetown." 
Marquette 92, 
Notre Dame 66 
MILWAUKEE -The Notre Dame team that won its first two Big East games forgot to board the bus destined for the Bradley Center on Saturday, and the Marquette club that lost to West Virginia and strug­gled against bottom-dwelling Seton Hall didn't show up either. 

The result'? A Marquette blowout of Notre Dame that allowed many in the packed arena to leave early and get home in time for the start of the Green Bay Packers playoff game against the Seattle Sllahawks. 
"I did a double take to make sure that counted as one loss," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "They were fabulous. The last eight, nine minutes, man, I'm saying, 'I want to get guys out and get them ready for Tuesday because we're not closing the gap today.' Everybody in the building knew that. They were putting on their Brett Favre jerseys with 10 minutes to play." 
Thanks to a lethal combina­tion of lightning-quick guard play on both ends of the 11oor and dead-eye outside shooting, No. 13 Marquette dealt the Irish a blow to their confi-

"It's really important to con­tinue to land elite guys one right after another because that breeds competition," Frank said. 
Notre Dame's recruiting elass is ranked No. 1 in the nation by Scout.com, just ahead of Alabama and Georgia. As of Tuesday, it fea­tured 22 players.

donee and their worst loss in the 109 meetings between the two schools. 
Marquette shot 12-for-24 from three-point range and had live players score double ligures. 
Guard Jerel McNeil led the way with 18, forward Lazar Ilayward netted 17 to go along with 11 rebounds, and guard Dominic James had 16 points and seven assists. 
The Golden Eagles were as balanced ofTensively as a skilled tight-rope walker. Notre Dame, if on that same high wire. would have crashed to the ground. 
Marquette had trouble stop­ping Irish forward Luke llarangody, who had 29 points to lead Notre Dame, but after Harangody, Notre Dame's pro­duetion on offense fell consid­erably. Forward Rob Kurz was the only other Irish player in double figures with 11 points. Guard Kyle McAlarney, who had a career-high 32 points against Connecticut. had a hard time getting open against Marquette's pressure defense and finished with only eight points. 
"Nothing really went well for us," Brey said. "But it was a lot of Marquette playing very, very well. A lot of guys for them made big shots and big plays." 
A Kurz 3-pointer cut Marquette's lead to live with 
17:12 to play, but after that, the rout was on. Marquette went on a 10-1 run over the next two minutes. James, who finished the first half with just three points had five points and two assists during that key run which put the lead baek up to 14. (56-42). 
forward Wesley Matthews, who finished with 15, extend­ed Marquette's lead to 20 with

we wantnd to do." 

Notre Dame opened confcnmcn play with an 82-74 win over Louisville on .Jan. 8. Irish guard Charel Allen scored 2fi points on 1 0-of-16 shooting and grabbed nine rebounds, her best porform­anee of the year. The teams were tied at the half, but a 10-2 Irish run in the second half helped Notre Dame pull away. Freshman forward Devereaux Peters earned her first start in the game. 
Notre Dame ranks third in the Big East in scoring, but against West Virginia it forgot why and how. The Irish shot 17.9 percent from the field in the first half and scored only 11 points at the break. 
"I kept looking out there going, 'What can I do'?'," McGraw said. 
The Irish found their way in thll second half and worked their way back into the game. Notre Dame trailed by three with 1:22 remaining,· but the Mountaineers made a field goal and eight tim! shots that put the game out or reach. Notre Dame's 11 first-half points was a school-record low. 
"I felt we played individually instead of as a team," McGraw said. "They needed to work together a little bit more, and that's why I felt there was a big change in the second half because we did work togllther a lot more." 
Freshman guard Brittany Mallory hit a season-high three 3­point shots in the game. The Irish recruited Mallory for her long­range abilities. and McGraw said she likes Mallory on the perime­ter. 
"We need a 3-point thrnat, and I think she has to bn that threat

(and current No. 7) Michigan State to a 1-1 tie. 
"We haven't played our best hockey, that's for sure," said senior center Mark Van Guilder, whose 18 points (8 goals, 10 assists) are second on the team to Erik Condra's 27 points (1 0 goals, 17 assists). "I think if we keep playing well defensively, the puck will start going in for 
us." 

The return of freshman defensemen Ian Cole from U.S. Junior competition and Teddy Ruth from injury, described by Jackson as "two of our best shots from the point, and two of our grittiest defensemen," should help cure some of the team's recent struggles, espe­cially when it comes to the fatigue of their fellow defense­men. 
As Cole and Huth return, how­ever, the Irish lost another emerging freshman in forward Robin Bergman. Bergman, a native of Stockholm, Sweden, has decided not to return to the University this semester, return­ing to his US! IL team in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 
"It was a culmination of things for [Robin] -nothing negative," Jackson said of the freshman who netted one goal and six assists in 20 games played. "It was all a little overwhelming for him: the academics, the sched­ule with hockey and training ... it's a pretty tough and demand­ing thing, and for freshmen, sometimes it's a bit of a culture shock." 
Bergman could still potentially return to Notre Dame and the for us," McGraw said. 
The Irish also defeated IUPUI, St. Francis and Hichmond during the break. 
Notre Dame continues confer­ence play against Villanova tonight at 7 in the .Joyce Center. The Wildcats ( 11-5, 1-2 Big East) defeated Georgetown on Saturday 57-51 at home, after dropping two of thrnn. 
Villanova, McGraw said. plays a five-guard system, similar to Notre Dame's four-guard style. The system is especially taxing on the larger Irish team, MeGraw said. 
"They have a lot of motion in their ofl'ense, so it's very difficult and they're very, very, very smart," McGraw said. 'They read the defense well, and they look at every opportunity to get an open shot. It makes it really hard defensively for our big guys, espe­cially, to guard them." 
Notre Dame may play five guards to counter the ofl'ense, an option McGraw said the team did last year and something she referred to as Plan B. 
The Wildcats have three play­ers -forwards Stacie Witman and Laura Kurz and forward/cen­ter Lisa Karcic -who average in double figures. The trio has scored 98 of the Wildcats' 106 poinLo.; in the past two games and scored Villanova's only points in its 51-49 loss to Seton I !all on Jan. 8. 
McGraw said Peters will come off the bench against Villanova despite earning a starting nod against Louisville. 
"She does great things when she's in there," McGraw said. "Maybe with this game in partic­ular she can watch a little bit more, and see what she can see from the bench."

team, as defenseman Luke Lucyk did after leaving the school early last year for ;moth­er season in juniors, but, as Jackson said, "it's in [Bergman's! hands." 
With No. 1 Michigan looming ahead this weekend, the Irish will neml to rid themselves of their winter doldrums in a hurry if they hope to compete. The Wolverines will have home-ice advantage Friday before the two teams take center-stage at The Palace of Auburn Ilills. Jackson says the Palace showcase will allow the Irish to "sell our game" to Michigan-based alum­ni and potential recruits alike, as well as a[I'ording current players tho opportunity to play in a large, storied venue. It will also bring in additional revnnue for the hockey program. 
So while the Irish, who were 20-5-1 through 26 games a year ago, may not have the ideal record or the nation's top-rank­ing (as they did last season) to show for their efl'orts thus far, a difTieult schedule has already begun to prepare the tP.am for its broader goals: tournament play. 
"(Playing such a tough sched­ule) kind of gets to you a little bit. but I think it's only going to make us better for the end of the season," Van Guilder said. "When it comes down to it, you're going to have to beat top­ranked teams in the CCII/\ play­oils. 
"Last year, we may have peaked a little bit earlier, but I'd prefer playing our best hockey come tournament time, and there's plenty of time to build toward the playoffs."

Even without a bowl game to play in, it was a busy holiday season for Notre Dame. 
Irish coach Charlie Weis saw one player transfer, than wel­comed back three who announced they will apply for a fifth year. 
On Jan. 8, Weis released a statement announcing that linebacker Maurice Crum. defensive lineman Justin Brown and cornerback Terrail Lambert will apply for a fifth year of eligibility. 
Crum started all 12 games last season and ranked fourth on the team in tackles with 84. lie also intercepted two pass­es, recovered two fumbles and scored a touchdown in the team's 20-6 win over UCLA on Oct. 6. 
Lambert also started every game last season, recording 34 tackles and one intercep­tion. Brown played in 10 games, started live and made 30 tackles and one sack. 
In the same statement, Weis announced that sophomore cornerback Munir Prince has elected to leave the University and will enroll elsewhere.

Offense struggles in six break games 
By MATT GAMBER Sports Writer 
After posting a 2-3-1 mark during an up-and-down holiday break during which the No. 8 Irish failed to win consecutive games, Notre Dame saw its reeord fall to 18-7-1 and its ranking drop two spots. 
Much of the blame for the sud­den cold stretch can be attrib­uted to its inability to score four or more goals in any of its games over break. Conversely, during a nine-game winning streak directly preceding the winter break, the Irish scored four or more goals eight times. 
"I am eoncerned about [the lack of scoring[, but I'm hoping we'll get out of it sooner rather than later," Irish coach Jeff Jaekson said. "It's better that it happens now rather than in March." 
Speeial teams play has emerged as a concern for the Irish, between a sputtering power-play unit mired in a 0-for­30 streak and a penalty-killing unit that has taken a dip as of late. Changes have been made, but consistency has become Jaekson's main priority. 
"Changing things isn't the answer anymore," Jackson said. "You get to the point where you keep changing things, and it only magnilles the problem. It's just a matter of putting the right chemistry set together." 
The Irish rode a nine-game winning streak heading into the Lightning College Hockey Classic in St. Petersburg, Fla., but fell 4­:~ to Massachusetts, now ranked No. 10, in the tourney opener on Dec. 29. They defeated Rensselaer 3-1 the next day. 
The Irish then traveled to Marquette, Mich., and took a split in a two-game set with Northern Michigan. After losing the first game 2-1 on Jan. 4., Notre Dame took game two the next day by the same margin before traveling to East Lansing, Mieh., and falling to Michigan State 3-1 on Jan. 11. 
In their first home game since a 5-0 thrashing of Nebraska­Omaha on Dec. 1, the Irish final­ly returned to the Joyce Center of Jan. 13, playing then-No. 9

The Irish won four of their six games over the break, but their perimeter defense haunted them once again. 
No. 17 Notre Dame lost both games played against ranked teams -at home against No. 2 Tennessee 87-63 on Jan. 5 and at No. 14 West Virginia 56-50 Sunday. The Irish {13-3, 1-1 Big East) allowed 11 three-pointers against Tennessee, their highest

Bjorklund destroyed the Irish defense, hitting 7 -of-9 on 3-point attempts. Irish coaeh Muffet McGraw called her team's per­formance a "total breakdown of the defense." 
Volunteers forward Candace Parker added 20 points and eight rebounds. McGraw said the team may have focused its defense too much on Parker, something it did not intend to do. 
"We really weren't planning on trying to shut Parker down," McGraw said. "We were going to double team her if she got the ball. We kind of triple-teamed her sometimes, and double-
