SMC counseling center offers more than senior career guidance service 
By SHARON HOUK 
News Staff 
Desperate seniors seeking em­
ployment are not the only students 
to whom the Saint Mary's Counsel­
ing and Career Development Center 
caters: Even freshmen can take ad­
vantage of programs ranging from 
career guidance to eating concerns 
groups. 
The center offers a wide variety of programs this year designed for all undergraduate students. Career de­velopment is of special interest to seniors, but the center offers pro­grams for students from their fresh­man year through graduation. 
According to the center's director, Mary DePauw, it is impor­tant that students start considering career directions at the beginning of their college years. Providing fresh­men with a smoother transition is the center's focus for the incoming class. The center's programs for freshmen include a workshop on academic skills and a special one­hour program entitled "Freshman Goal Exploration-A 4-Year Plan" on 
Sept. 12 from 6:30·7:30 p.m. in Regina Hall. 
The center also provides sop­homores with career development programs and workshops on choos­ing a major. juniors and seniors may take advantage of such programs as Resume Writing, Interviewing Skills, and Assertive job Search Tactics. 
All students have access to the recently updated, reorganized and 
expanded Career Resource Center located in 168 LeMans Hall. The Career Resource Center contains resource material on nearly every aspect of making a career choice. In a comfortable atmosphere, a student may browse through books on top­ics such as stress management, the Peace Corps, specific job vacancies and internships. The shelves also hold literature from many corpora­tions and organizations as well as a reference guide to the career choices and addresses of recent Saint Mary's alumnae. 
The Counseling and Career De­velopment Center at Saint Mary's was established in 1978 when the counseling center and the career de­velopment center were con­solidated. DePauw says she feels personal issues cannot be separated from career development. A more efficient and effective program is provided by a single center address­ing various student needs. 
Since DePauw became director of the center in the fall of 1980 there has been significant growth in pro­grams offered. The center has always offered programs for underclas· smen, but is continually adjusting it­self to student needs. 
DePauw stresses that the center does not function as a vocational compass. She says she believes stu­dents can be overly concerned about molding themselves to a career and, as a result, neglect their education. Others neglect develop·

U.S. only nation to veto U.N. resolution condemning Israel 
Associated l"ress 
The United States yesterday vetoed a Security Council resolution demanding that the Israeli army in southern Lebanon remove "obstacles to the restoration of nor­mal conditions in the areas under its occupation." 
The vote was 14-1. 
The resolution called on Israel "to respect strictly the rights ofthe civil­ian population under its occupa­tion." It demanded that Israel open all roads and lift restrictions on the movement ofpeople and goods and the operation of Lebanese govern· ment institutions. 
Warren Clark, the U.S. representa­tive at the council, cast the veto and said, "We cannot be a party to an un­balanced solution which takes a one· sided, myopic look at only one part ofthe problem." 
"We believe it is unrealistic and unreasonable for the council to ad­dress the question of foreign forces in southern Lebanon and humanitarian and security problems there, without dealing with these same problems in all ofLebanon," he added. 
'Orientation Counseling' welcome replacement for SMC 'Big Sisters' 
By MARY HEILMANN 
StaffReporter 
'Orientation Counseling' was pro­vided to Saint Mary's freshmen upon thier arrival this year in an attempt to ease the transition into college life, replacing th~ Big Sister/ Little Sister orientation program that had previously been used. 
The new program was instituted "to give a much more complete ori­entation" and to correct the prob­lems that have plagued the Big Sister program in past years, Orientation Week Chairman Carol Hastings said. 
"The big problem with the Big Sister program was that not enough girls volunteered to be big sisters, and, for the most part, the commit· ment of those who did never lasted. lbis was complicated by the diffi­culty of organizing activities for such a large group of people, and in communicating these activities to the whole campus," Hastings said. 
Under the Orientation Counsel­ing program, which was originated by Director of Student Activities Mary Ann O'Donnell, freshmen were divided into groups of ten to twelve students under the guidance of an upperclassman orientation counselor. The orientation coun­selor was then responsible for coor­dinating all aspects of orientation­academic, social, and spiritual­within her group, as well as facilitat· ing interactions between other orientation groups and the Notre Dame community. 
Orientation counselors were re­quired to attend three two-hour training sessions last spring and were issued handbooks delineating their duties, which included con-

tacting each of the girls in their group during the summer, as well as greeting them individually upon their arrival at Saint Mary's. 
Michelle Coleman, a sophomore orientation counselor, praised the program, saying,"Being an orienta· tion counselor was really fun. It was a neat way to meet the freshmen, to take them around, and to make them feel at home. And it's great for the freshmen because they get to meet one upperclassman plus nine other freshmen." 
Under the Big Sister program, stu· dents had complained that few so­cial activities were planned and that many big sisters lacked the commit· ment necessary for successful and lasting relationships.

Aryeh Levin, deputy Israeli ambas­sasor to the United Nations, said the area under Israeli occupation has been kept free ofthe bloody turmoil and upheaval plaguing the rest of Lebanon. 
"In the month of August, for in­stance, not one Lebanese was killed in the south. ·But according to Lebanese police sources, some 21 5 were killed elsewhere in Lebanon," Levin said. He described charges of Israeli mistreatment of Lebanese citizens as "patent nonsense."

Hands down, McDonald's is the winner in the great fast-food race 
Somewhere on Madison Avenue somebody has con­
vinced someone that Burger King has a chance of 
beating out McDonald's. Forget it. 
I don't like Burger King. After being pounded this summer by television ads espousing the greatness of flame broiling, I dedded one day at work to part from my Big Mac routine and give this upstart a try. Terrible. I waited in line 15 minutes as one employee stood before one cash register and hollered "Need a Whopper'' into a microphone for each of the 15 cus­tamers who wanted one. Another employee rushed about in greasy topsiders filling orders one item at a time. When I got my Whopper, it was cold. I'm not arguing all Whoppers are cold, but let's just say I've never had a cold Big Mac. A Big Mac has fresh, crisp salad dressings. When you bite into a Whopper, an entire garden of almost-whole

And it's probably the same people who are trying to make us think we like Pepsi more than Coke. In grocery stores, they give us sips of Coke and sips of Pepsi and a saltine cracker in between. Is that the challenge? The Great Pepsi Challenge? As Mean joe Greene would say, give us a case and we'll think about it.

Surely there are more important issues in the world but when the armed forces spend S 1 billion on fast-food contracts, the powers-that-be need to be informed by the citizenry. I cast my vote for McDonald's and raise my glass ofCoke in a toast to the Admirals. 
The Navy knows. Now let's hope the Army and Air Force correct their wayward path. The only consola­tion is that the soldiers and the pilots didn't choose the Huddle. But at least the Huddle serves Coke.

Khadafy regains post after coup attempt fails 
Associated Press 

EDITOR'S note : Correspondent john Winn Miller recently spent ninedays in Libya onhissecond ex­tended visit to the North African na­tion. The sources for this story asked not to be identifiedforfear of retaliation or diplomatic repercus­sions. 
Four months after surviving a coup attempt, Col. Moammar Khadafy has regained full control of the country using youthful shock troops, prison camps and televised executions by strangulation. 
During 15 years ofnearly absolute rule ofthis North African nation, the 42-year-old Khadafy has survived at least six coup attempts, diplomats say. 
But the last one, on May 8, against Khadafy's heavily fortified barracks· home in Tripoli was different. This time it wasn't the military but a small band ofcivilians that carried out the attempt. Most of the commandos, perhaps a dozen, were trapped by Libyan forces in an apartment build­ing and killed, sources say. 
For the next month and a half Libya was swept by a reign of terror instigated by Khadafy and carried out by fanatic young supporters known as Revolutionary Commit· tees. The armed youths prowled the streets arresting anyone they deemed suspicious. Shots rang out throughout the nights almost to the end ofJune, residents said. 
Diplomats said 12 people offi· dally were executed but the num· ber may be closer to 120. 
"Seven were brutally strangled with clothes-hanging wire on televi· sion. It was obscene. They died very

slowly while the kids slapped them 
on their faces," one diplomat said. 
The public executions ended be­
cause of protests at home and from 
other Arab countries, the diplomats 
said. 
As many as 5,000 people -includ· 
ing Westerners -were rounded up 
by the Revolutionary Committees 
and locked up in "concentration 
camps" in the desert, they said. 
Many were only held a few days until 
they could prove who they were, 
said the diplomats, who said they es­
timated "thousands" remained im­
prisoned. 
At the end of June, the 
Revolutionary Committees disap­
peared from the streets but they are . 
still around -if operating more dis­
creetly. Diplomats believe there are 
only a few thousand people in the 
Revolutionary Committees but that 
they are enough to control the 
country. 
"As long as you have a big army 
and the Revolutionary Committees, 
it is easy to control the country. 
There are only 3.5 million Libyans, 
after all," one diplomat said. 
There is, however, growing frustraion among the civilian popu­lation because of a shortage of con­sumer goods caused by dwindling oil revenues and Khadafy's attempts to wipe out small businesses and replace them with government-run stores. 
But the main problem he mayface is with the army, the diplomats say. 
"Khadafy's relations with the army are oft'and on all the time," said one diplomat, citing the number of military coup attempts. "They get special privileges in stores, houses, cars," he said.

Hastings said that the official com­mitment of the orientation coun­selors ends at October break, when most freshmen "are over that initial 
homesickness of the first few months." Most orientation coun­selors, however, plan to contiue their involvement with their orien­tation group. 
"I'm trying to keep in touch with my group and plan activities with other groups and with similar groups at Notre Dame," said Cole­man. "The program's been such a success already that I want to con­tinue to be a part of my freshmen's lives, not just as a leader, but as a friend."

ster Yasuhiro Nakasone for 90 minutes. Foreign Ministry spokes­man Shiro Amaye said the Japanese leader praised South Korea both for its defense efforts and its attempts to initiate a dialogue with communist North Korea. 
But the climax of the day, and probably of the trip, came Thursday evening at a state banquet when Hirohito, 83, delivered an an­ticipated expression of regret for 
Japan's past domination of Korea. 
"It is indeed regrettable that there was an unfortunate past between us for a period in this century, and I 
believe  that  it  should  not  be  
repeated again," he said.  
Hirohito's  statement  stopped  
short  of  the  direct  apology  

demanded by many Koreans; who remain bitter about Japan's harsh colonial subjugation of the Korean peninsula from 1910 until 1945. 
Hirohito added that he hoped Chun's visit would further promote the "new-born relationship between our two countries." 
Hirohito, who became emperor in 1925, was regarded as a semi-divine ruler over Japan and its vassals until 1945 when World War II ended, al­though the military held actual 
power. He is now symbolic head of state. 
In his address, Chun said he had "listened solemnly" to the em­peror's remarks on the past, and said the "unfortunate past ... should be made to serve as the cuitivation ofan even closer relationship between Korea andJapan in the future." 
He too spoke of the "beginning of the new era ofpartnership."

"liberal arts skills are the essential 
marketable skills," says DePauw. In 
her opinion, conceptual problem­
solving, communication, and human 
relations are key in career success. 
The center's structure as a 
combined counseling and career 
center makes it a rarity in collegiate 
services, DePauw said. The same 
center that offers a liberal arts in­
ternship program offers an eating 
concerns group. 
DePauw says she is pleased with this rounded ·approach, and adds that her center hopes to challange the students "to look at the social justice implications of any career decision." She says it is a mistake to limit social justice to temporary volunteer programs. 
The center publishes their "Red­Topped" Bulletin monthly to an­nounce programs and provide other imponant information about its services.

to do what is within the law. We don't want to get sued," Kearny said. 
A study which Kearney com­pleted last September and presented to Library Director Robert Miller, the Library Administrative Commit­tee, and other administrative groups including the University Council spurred the changes. 
The new policy is not expected to interfere with normal use of the reserve book room. The teaching statl's reaction should not be 'exceedingly adverse' because the li­brary has been successful in the past obtaining permission from publish­ing companies to photocopy copyrighted materials, Kearny said. 
Stanford University and Penn State University have implemented similar policies as a result of the 1978law. 
The Library intends to keep one copy ofrequested materials on hand for every 10 to 1 5 students, but will not ask publishers for permission to make more than 1 0 copies ofa given work, although this permission is of­ten volunteered, Kearny said.

Brazilian theologian faces doctrinal interrogation 
Associated Press 
Leonardo Boff, a Brazilian theolo­gian who faces doctrinal interroga­tion at the Vatican today, says he seeks simply to "take seriously" Popejohn Paul Il's call for the clergy to defend the poor. 
But Bofl's vision of liberation the­ology, which has questioned th.e au­thority of the hierarchy and condemned the status quo in Latin America, has drawn questions at a time when Rome is chastising some theologians for applying "Marxist concepts" to the poverty struggle in Latin America. 
"If there is punishment, I will ac­cept it, although not without sor­row," Boff said in a recent interview at the Franciscan monastery in Petropolis, a mountain city 40 miles north of Rio where he lives and teaches. "I prefer to go with the church, rather than to walk alone with my theology." 

Botl, 45, is a leading spokesman of liberation theology, a Latin Ameri­can movement born in the 1960s which preaches the liberating force of the Gospel against social oppres­sion and says the church should actively side with the poor. 
Critics charge that liberation the­ology endorses Marxism. Boff denies it, but says Marxist anaylsis is "instrumental" in discovering what makes poor people poor, and says Karl Marx is "typical of great spirits who seriously dedicated themselves to thinking and who unveiled new dimensions of reality." 
'Ibese new dimensions threaten 
to split the traditional, Rome­
centered church and the progres­

sive clergy in Brazil and other Third World countries. 
On Monday, the Vatican's Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine ofthe Faith, formerly in the Inquisitional Office, released a 35-page critique of liberation theology, explicitly rejecting Marxism as an instrument for analyzing social conditions. 
In reply, the Brazilian Bishops Conference, the ruling body of this country's strongly activist church, issued a terse statement urging a "close study" of Bofl's writings to "avoid errors about the healthy and legitimate liberation theology." 
"My summons to Rome ... is a global judgementofour church, that goes into the cellars of society and attends to the outcasts, the miserable and the poor," Buff said at 
a  news  conference  before  his  
departure.  
Ironically,  Buff  says  he  was  

strongly influenced in his graduate studies by West German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger -the head of the Holy Congregation who will be his interrogator in Rome. 
Ratzinger has called liberation theology "a fundamental danger for the faith of the church" and criticized ideologies which "use Marxist analysis to interpret not only history and the life of society but also the very Bible and the Chris­tian message." 
Boff has written numerous arti­cles and 32 books. The last one, "Church: Charisma and Power," published in 1981 but not yet available in English, was condemned by an archdiocesan tribunal in Rio de janeiro and has now brought the summons to Rome. 
Vatican sees presence of Marxism in 'liberation theology' movement 
Associated Press 
In "liberation theology," Christ's words are wielded as a weapon to help the poor and oppressed. But the Vatican is growing increasingly uneasy over signs of Marxism in the movement. 
Earlier this week, the Vatican declared that the liberation theol­ogy preached by activist clergy in Latin America and elsewhere in the Third World is heavily influenced by the Marxist theory of "class struggle" -of poor against rich. The church must work "without being 'against' anyone," Pope John Paul II says. 
One of the movement's leading theorists, the Brazilian priest Rev. Leonardo Boff, has been summoned to Rome, and on Friday he will be questioned by the Roman Catholic Church's official watchdogs on doctrine, who will look for possible doctrinal errors in his writings. 
Liberation theology, born two decades ago in Latin America, has come to embrace many streams of contemporary religious thinking. At its center, however, is the applica­tion of]esus Christ's teachings to im­prove the lives ofthe downtrodden. 
"I discovered that poverty was something to be fought against," wrote the Rev. Gustavo Gutierrez, a Peruvian regarded as the father of liberation theology. ".. .It became crystal clear that in order to serve the poor, one had to move into poli­tical action." 
The action has included thousands of"base communities" in Latin America, the United States, the Philippines, Tanzania and other countries, groups of several dozen lay people who work to raise social awareness in conjunction with New Testament teaching, often through

instruction in reading and writing, in voting rights and similar areas. 
The activism has sometimes been militant. A legendary figure in the Latin American church is the Rev. Camillo Torres, a 37-year-old priest who took up arms, joined the rebels of his native Colombia and died in a shootout with the army in 1966. 
The Vatican, in a major report last Monday on the movement, used the term in the plural, referring to "theologies ofliberation." 
Apparently to show the sometimes imprecise nature ofwhat the movement includes, the report 
The book is a collection of 13 es­says that criticize what Boff calls the "authoritarianisn., dogmatism and concentration of power" in the Roman Catholic Church. Boff sug­gests this criticism was the real rea­son he was summoned to Rome. 
"The great fear that liberation theology provokes (among church leaders) . . . is not for resorting to Marxist analysis. It is for demanding that the church break its ties with the oppressors," he said in a pub­lished interview last week. 
Two other Buff books -"Jesus Christ Liberator," published in 1971, and "Eclesiogenese," pub­lished in 1977 · also drew questions from the Vatican. 
Uberation theology was born, Boff says, in the 1960s among middle-class university students "who became aware of the iniquity of the capitalist system for the over­whelming majority ofour people." 
In Brazil, the per capita income is $2,240, but two-thirds of the people survive on less than $1,500 a year. Millions live in slums known as "favelas" on the outskirts of big cities, usually without electricity and running water. There is no gov­ernment welfare or unemployment insurance, only a very basic and much-criticized national health ser· vice. 
Boff was born the southern Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. His father, an Italian immigrant and former Jesuit seminarian, encour­aged the family's 11 children to read, debate and meditate. Botfs brother, Clodovis, who has also written on liberation theology, wa-; recently suspended from a teaching post at the pontifical University of Rio de 
Janiero by Cardinal Eugenio de Araujo Sales.

added: "as with all movements of ideas, the 'theologies of liberation' present diverse theological posi­tions. Their doctrinal frontiers are badly defined." 
The Vatican report took pains to emphasize church concern for the poor and oppressed but criticized the link between liberation theology and Marxist revolutionary ideas. 
The Marxist theory of class struggle underlies liberation theol­ogy's aims of freeing the poor from wealthy landowners, military dic­tators and foreign capital interests, the Vatican said.

the administration's foreign policy achievements, he claimed a half­dozen, including improvements in Central America and better relations with China and Pakistan. He didn't mention the Middle East. 
The omission is not surprising be­cause it was in the Middle East that the administration met with its most dramatic and visible foreign policy failures -the retreat from Lebanon after 264 Americans were killed, and 
.APPboto 
the shelving of President Reagan's 
1982 Arab-Israeli peace initiative. 
The administration had focused 
more attention on the Middle East 
than on any other area of the world ­
until the withdrawal from Lebanon. 
But if the Mideast setbacks cost 
Reagan significantly at the polls in 
November, it will be because voters 
conclude on their own that the ef­
fort wasn't worth the cost. 
Walter F. Mondale, the Demo­cratic presidential challenger, has given no indication he will try to elevate the setbacks into major cam­paign issues. 
Some debate is likely, however. Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, the Demo­cratic vice presidential candidate, said in Portland, Ore., Wednesday that in situations such as Lebanon, "Let's send in the diplomats before the Marines." 
She said the U.S. mission in Lebanon was never adequately ex­plained and called the death of U.S. servicemen "an outrage." 
Aides to Mondale say he will criticize some aspects of Reagan's Mideast policy, particularly the timing and execution. 
But Mondale would be hard­pressed to unload on Reagan for events in Lebanon because Mondale generally favored U.S. actions there. Additionally, Israel favored the American involvement, and Mondale is as anxious as Reagan to showcase his pro-Israeli credentials. 
Mondale didn't like Reagan's Mideast peace initiative, but will be restrained in his criticism by the real possibility that a new Israeli govern­ment might show interest. He wouldn't want to be out of step on such a key issue. 
Reagan hardly mentions the Middle East in his speeches, al­though he did claim in a speech to B'nai B'rith on Thursday that there is "far greater cause for hope" of a Mideast peace now than there was 
he took offic while ack­

nowledging a permament peace still is not at hand. But Lebanon could cast a shadow over Reagan's campaign. 
The total American dead there far exceeded the number of U.S. sol­diers killed in hostile situations during the Carter administration. 
Although Reagan had said those responsible for the attack on the Marine headquarters "must be dealt justice -and they will be," there never was any direct American retaliation. Neither was there retaliation for the bombing of the

U.S. Embassy in Beirut on April 18, 1983 that killed 63 persons, includ­ing 1 7 Americans. 
Reagan's Mideast peace initiative, unveiled with fanfare on Sept. 1, 1982, was shelved after both Israel and jordan rejected it. The plan called for Jordan to join Israel in peace talks aimed at creating self­government for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and GazaStrip. 
Mondale has faulted the initiative 
rael-departure from the 1978 Camp 
David peace accords forged by the 
Carter administration. He feels that 
Reagan blundered by not moving 
quickly upon taking office to follow 
up on the progress already achieved 
under Camp David. 
Since the Middle East setbacks, 

Reagan has taken an unambiguously 
pro-Israeli position on most issues. 
Even where there are disagree­
ments, such as over Israeli settle· 
ments in occupied Arab lands, the 
relationship With Israel is sure to 
remain intact and most likely will 
thrive. It's a virtual certainty either 
man would ask Congress to approve 
more money, beyond the $2.6 bil­
lion Israel already is likely to receive 
in fiscal 1985, to help Israel out ofits 
horrendous economic problems, in­
cluding an inflation rate of more 
than 400 percent. 
Israeli government leaders seem comfortable with Reagan and satisfied with the present state of U.S.-Israeli relations, in spite ofsome bumpy beginnings. They are partie· ularly pleased by the start ofa strate­gic U.S.-Israeli military relationship, which Mondale also supports. 
There are differences in the posi­tions ofthe two candidates. Mondale says he would move the U.S. Em­bassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move opposed by the administra· tion. He also says he wouldn't sell AWACS and other sophisticated arms to moderate Arab nations as the administration has done. 
Both Reagan and Mondale would be expected to push anew for a las­ting Arab-Israeli peace -with Reagan reviving his initiative and Mondale favoring the more ambiguous negotiations envisioned in the Camp David accords. Neither would ap­pear to want to get extensively in· volved in Lebanon, barring some unseen and dramatic improvement. 
Mondale also has no apparent major differences with Reagan on shipping.

Letters to a lonely God 
A Catholic university? 
by Rev. Robert Griffin 
features columnist 
E
very year, somebody nice, or not so nice, decides to write an article or term paper asking the question: "Is Notre Dame still Cath­olic?" One could answer, "By whose standards?" but that would seem evasive. Notre Dame is not Catholic now in the way it was Catholic in 1944; however, the Catholic Church isn't Catholic the way it was in 1944. Yet the 1944 model ofCatholicism is the only model a few highly conservative Catholics appreciate. In 1944, the Church was still closed in like a ghetto, defending itself against the Protestants. In 1959, a jolly, fat pope proposed opening the win­dows ofthe Church, letting in the fresh winds ofchange and updating. The word "Catholic" has implied something less narrow and monolit­hic ever since. 
I am not a theologian or a flaming liberal. I was ordained in 1954, and lived very comfortably inside the ghetto; as a priest, I felt safe and privileged there. I've done my share ofresisting the changes, and I still get confused by the viewpoints of young priests. I've learned to live with the fact that there are different styles ofbeing Catholic. That doesn't mean you can believe just anything and still be credible as a practitioner ofthe religion. As a communion ofbelievers accepting Christ as the Lord, we still have standards. Creeds, sacraments, and commandments are important. I'm not free to do my own thing, or ignore the pope. Two Scriptural insights keep me reasonably tolerant: the first is what Christ said: "I have other sheep that are not of this fold." The second is from St. Paul: "We see truth darkly, as though in a mirror." 
The wordstyle is not a theologi­cal term; it's a way ofdescribing the differences among believers. Some Christians, talking about faith, keep their Bibles in hand, willing and able to cite chapter and verse. Some place their trust in the intercessions of Mary; Lourdes and Fatima, for them, were more grace-filled events than the Sermon on the Mount. Some pay a lot ofattention to the charismatic experiences, like speak­ing in tongues. Some become pas­sionate about the liberation ofthe poor. Some need orthodoxy as it was defended in the six centuries between St. Thomas Aquinas and Vatican I. Some act as though all theology handed down from the time of the Fathers until Vatican II were pious legends. Some, hearing a weather report from the Vatican, seem willing to defend it as a defini­tion ex cathedra offaith and morals. Some are willing to subscribe to anything, as long as they can seem liberal, and contradict the pope. Perhaps they kid themselves in thinking they're not on the way to becoming dropouts, but who am I to judge? Many, belonging to the mainstream, try to sew all ofit, or part ofit, into a seamless garment: the Bible, the Holy Spirit, papal authority, social activism, the rituals and beliefofthe tradition. Others, not sure who they are, are haunted by ghosts from their school days with the nuns, because doubt too is part ofthe Catholic experience. 

Ifyou ask, is Notre Dame still Catholic? I would like to know, from whose point ofview? A Bibli­cal fundamentalist would deny that this campus knows Christ. Some conservatives see liberals as the enemies inside the camp, poisoning the well. Once, back East, I heard a seminary teacher wishing that the old-fashioned pastors could be flushed down the toilet. A charis­matic might consider the rest ofus only half alive to grace. An inner city worker may feel that the Es­tablishment keeps missing the point ofChristianity. 
At Notre Dame, Catholics differ­ing in style get along pretty well. I receive the Eucharist at Mass, along with a nun, a seminarian, and a group ofstudents. The nun, passing the tabernacle, genuflects; the seminarian bows his head; many of the students do neither. Which of us believes in the Real Presence? Probably all ofus. Which of us believes in the doctrine of tran­substantiation? Ifthe Church insists on this doctrine as the exclusive way ofdescribing what happens to bread and wine at Mass, I hope all of us believe in transubstantiation. Is it an article offaith, or are there other explanations of the Real Presence Catholics can be comfortable with? From what I read, theologians think there are differing ways ofconsider­ing the mystery. Is Notre Dame Catholic? It is profoundly and 
gloriously Catholic, though the 
question seems dumb, like asking a 
soldier whether war is hell. 1 spend 
my life being selfconsciously Cath­
olic, dealing with other Catholics 
who know who they are. We don't 
necessarily agree on the nature of 
sacraments. 
Ifyou're going to ask if Notre Dame is Catholic, you'd better understand what it means to be Catholic as the Church is Catholic. Catholic includes ancient, modern, and future worlds beyond the im­aginings of the Baltimore catechism with its simple questions. Martin Luther and Hans Kung are Catholic, as much as you may regret them. The "Syllabus ofErrors" was Catho­lic, though ifyou were familiar with it, it could embarrass you. James Joyce's "Ulysses" is as Catholic as the cathedral at Chartres, though it parodies Holy Ireland. The European theologians with tough sounding names borrow philosophical systems from thinkers who claim God is dead, as a way of freshening Catholic dogmas. The Berrigans protesting Vietnam were Catholic witnesses. Graham Greene's whiskey priest who was impure with a woman was a Catho­lic saint. Catholic poets, like St. Francis and Gerard Manley Hop­kins, have celebrated the physical universe, showplace ofGod's shining glory, as a sacrament of Christ, Who redeemed the world into Catholic grace. "Catholic" is not just a local watchword of tribal loyalty describing students making the way ofthe cross. 
Can I write the article asking if Notre Dame is Catholic, though I'm not an expert on religion? Ofcourse I can write it, if I have the humility to recognize my limitation..'i as an observer. One ofthe mistakes of believers is to make God and the Church as small as themselves, as though Christianity had no tradition or history it would be helpful to know about. 
Please notice ifI'm smiling, pardner, if, after two semesters of theology, I start insisting this school isn't Catholic. I'd be naive to volun­teer to serve as grand inquisitor. It would be smarter to question the structural soundness of the Empire State Building from my experience in industrial design class, where we studied the layout ofa McDonald's stand.

'Tightrope' is all Eastwood, but the act is getting old 
by Paul Cimino 
features staffwriter 
I 
didn't get to see "Sudden Im­pact" or "Firefox," but I've always been a Clint Eastwood fan and when "Tightrope" came along 1 decided that it was about time I got to see one of Clint's newer films. It was not one of my better decisions. 
"Tightrope" stars Eastwood as a New Orleans detective named W es Block who is investigating a plague ofbrutal rape-murders. That's a quick overview-underneath, there are a number ofother stories going on at the same time. 
Block has been having problems with his wife for some time. She finally moves out and hooks up with a well-to-do type, leaving Block to take care oftheir two daughters, Amanda {played by Alison Eastwood) and Penny Uennifer Beck). Block's work demands that he be on call 24 hours a day, and as such, the kids see more oftheir babysitter than him. In any event they still greatly favor Block to their mother. 

Block has another problem. He craves sex and spends much of his time after dinner wandering the streets of the famous French Quar­ter in search ofnew experiences. He finds a numerous assortment of them (hence the film'sR rating). 
As the story develops, night by night, women whom Block had recently "been" with are systemati­cally murdered. Block feels it is his responsibility to solve the mystery. He also feels threatened by the murderer and realizes that he is unintentionally endangering his family and his newest girlfriend, Beryl Thibodeaux, (Genevieve Bujold) who runs the local rape clinic. After consulting with her on the rape-murders, Block cannot help but fall in love with her. She proves to be invaluable in helping Block solve the case and straighten out his life. 
In critiquing this movie, let me first say that die-hard Eastwood fans will enjoy this film from the start. Eastwood is his usual self; a rough looking character with an almost unchanging facial expression which he effectively uses to convey his inner turmoil. The act, however, is getting old. 
We also get a few glimpses of Clint in a father role. It is difficult to adjust to this notion because he is usually stereotyped as .a rough cowboy or the famous cop "Dirty Harry" Calahan. The film is in all 
aspects, a totally Eastwood film. He 
makes the movie, and what good 
that is in the film can be attributed 
to no one but him. 
Bujold is unconvincing in her minor role. She makes appearances only from time to time and when she does show up, plays a character with no apparent feeling. Her slight accent (it sounds Russian) further detracts from her character. Al­though she is a great help to Block, we really could have done without her. 
The only other characters deserv­ing ofany mention are Block's children. Alison Eastwood and Jennifer Beck are very believable and create a welcome contrast to Clint's nocturnal meanderings. Alison is in fact our hero's real-life daughter and makes her screen debut in "Tighttope." 
The movie on the whole leaves much to be desired. It was mostly filmed at night and is inundated with a shadowy feeling which becomes depressing. Further, it has no real storyline or build-up in the plot before the last half hour. Block walks the streets by night and has his fun; another girl gets killed; he goesto the scene ofthe crime and gets filled in; there is a short daylight scene; and then everything starts all over again. By the middle of the movie, this becomes ex­tremely banal. {It was at this point that I noticed two ofmy com­panions were sleeping rather soundly.) 
On the whole, "Tightrope" is not one ofEastwood's better efforts, especially considering that he also produced the film. 
My advice would be to save your money and buy someone a little gift. You will undoubtedly get a better feeling and more satisfaction than from this movie. 




A calmer Faust heads into his fourth season 
After three disappointing years, the Irish coach is learning to deal with the pressures of his job 

The Game Plan·Talented Irish could make life miserable for outmatched 
By LARRY BURKE 
Gerry Faust 
Sports Writer 
Irish head coach 
Gerry Faust is through talking. 
He has endured all the ups and downs that the 1983 season produced. He has heard all the rumors, survived the negative publicity and listened to the grumbling ofdisappointed fans. Most ofall, he's lasted through the intense pressure that has been building over the past three years. 
Better change that last part toalleged pressure. How's that? Well, as much as it may surprise some people, Irish 
head coach Gerry Faust is as calm and relaxed as ever ­just the way a head coach should be. And he is well aware of the truth of the old saying -"Talk is cheap." 
"The important thing," says Faust, "is that talk and goals and all that doesn't really mean much ifyou don't go out and play sixty minutes offootball." 
And what was that about pressure? 
"I'm probably more relaxed than I've been since I've been here," says the Irish coach, "because now we've got things going the way I want them going. It took three years to build the foundation, and we've got that completed now. I think things are starting to roll the way I want them to." 
No one knows better than Faust, however, what a tough three years it has been. High hopes ofbig bowl games, unbeaten seasons, and national championships that he had back in 1981 turned into the disappointing reality of three rollercoaster seasons and a combined record of 18-15-1. 
"It's been frustrating to both the players and the coaches not to finish with a better record the last three years," says Faust. "But I've always had a philosophy

Sports Writer 
In most people's minds, the most difficult aspect ofthe Purdue game for Notre Dame will be getting the 145 busloads ofstudents to arrive to the Hoosier Dome Saturday before the 12:30 p.m. start. 
However, even after last season's 52-6 mauling of the Boilermakers, Head Coach Gerry Faust is preaching caution about the 1984 Purdue squad. 
"Purdue is a heck ofa team," Faust says. "Any team that gains over 400 total yards against you is a pretty good offensive team. I'd also like to see a football team that can win and has seven turnovers in a game. This is a new year, we're not playing a game last year, and I'm sure Purdue feels the same way." 
The Boilers return 3 7 lettermen, but lost half of their starters from last season. Many players got the chance to play in '83, but, many still lack game experience. 
Purdue's offense against Notre Dame's defense: 
The Irish defense, apparently the only aspect of the Notre Dame attack which has a weakness, could suffer if the newcomers in the secondary unravel. 
Defensive coordinator Andy Christoff has implemented an attacking defense, which could make the Irish vulnerable to giving up the big play, a problem Notre Dame suffered last season, in addition to giving up short gains. 
"We will be looking to make more big plays on defense ourselves," Christoff says. 
With five players available to fill the three line posi­tions, the Irish should have no problem controlling the line ofscrimmage. Add the talent ofNotre Dame's hard-hitting linebackers, and domination is a possibility. 
Purdue does have experience on its offensive line, but you won't see the names of the linemen dotting all­America lists. Even though Purdue's line averages 6-2, 264 pounds, expect to see Irish blue in the Boiler backfield. 
Of Purdue's seven offensive starters gone from 1983, five of them were in the skill positions. Purdue was wiped out in the backfield, losing its three leading ground gainers. Rodney Carter, who saw limited action last 
 Boilers if they are able to avoid giving up the big play 
Where the rest ofthe Purdue ground attack will come from is uncertain, but Purdue Head Coach Leon Burtnett has confidence in his team's running game. 
The Purdue backfield can catch the ball, though. Look for the Boilers to throw to their running backs, especially in the direction ofRobert Banks, who steps into the injured Mike Larkin's line backing position. 
Ifthere is a way Purdue will be able to move the football, it will be through the air. The only question will be who is going to be throwing the ball. Scott Campbell, latest in the line of Purdue phenom quarterbacks, is gone. 
"We're down to two quarterbacks," says Burtnett, who is waiting until Saturday to announce the starter. "It's now betweenJim Everett and Doug Downing, and neither one has stepped forward with the consistency to start. We're concerned with which one ofthose can get us into the end zone." 
Everett, a junior with limited game experience, should get the nod over the freshman Downing. 
Jeff Price and Steve Griffin, Purdue's first-and third­leading receivers in 1983, return at wide receiver and flanker, respectively. Last season's backup tight end, Marty Scott also is back. 
Faust does admit the Irish defensive weakness is in the secondary. "We are inexperienced as a whole," Faust says. "But our DB's have been working very well together. It's hard to judge how good they're going to be until they go up against an opponent." 
Purdue's offense may have averaged over 400 yards total offense last season, but on Saturday, expect it to move slower than rush-hour traffic on the Loop. 
Notre Dame'~ offense against Purdue's defense: 
Although the Purdue defense returns seven starters and several lettermen, the Boilers' lack the talent on the defensive unit to contend with the powerful Irish offense. 
Purdue's defense is highly suspect at linebacker, with two oflast season's regulars departing the scene. Kevin Sumlin, the leading tackler for the Boilers in 1983, is the only returning linebacker. 
Three ofthe front five also graduated, and the lack of game experience of the replacements might be a big factor against Notre Dame's formidable offensive line. 
that there's a reason for everything. As many times as 
the ball has bounced against us, our turn will come 
when it'll bounce our way. I think we started to see 
that happen in the Liberty Bowl." 
Ah, the Uberty Bowl. That was Notre Dame's first venture into post-season play under Faust, and while the Irish didn't exactly run rings around the Eagles of Boston College (frozen turf and twelve-degree temperatures made any kind of running difficult) Faust's team accomplished something that they hadn't done in the entire 1983 season-namely, beat a ranked team with a winning record. Notre Dame also avoided losing the final game ofthe season for the first time since 1979. More importantly, the Irish displayed a dominant running game that starred tailback Allen Pinkett ( 11 I yards on 28 carries) and fullback Chris Smith ( 104 yards on 18 carries), as well as a gutsy defense that stopped the Eagles when the game was on the line. 
As tough as the Irish were against BC, Faust believes that the best is yet to come. 
"We were a better football team this spring than we were after the Boston College game," says Faust. "I thought we were a good football team against BC, but I thought that by the end of the spring we had improved even more. Our goal was to get better than we were in the spring for the Purdue game, and we won't know that until game day." 
But Faust does know that there is a lot to be exited about as far as his 1984 squad is concerned. 
"The young men came back this summer in top shape," says the Irish coach, "and they've worked awfully hard. They really have a closeness that I think

Smith, and Notre Dame should score even more than the 33 points that the Purdue defense gave up per game last season. 
The Purdue secondary is the highlight of the defensive unit, returning three offour players, including free safety Ron Woodson, who drew all-America mention as a freshman.

Rule Changes 
The NCAA Football Rules Committee has made several changes which will go into effect during the 1984 season. A couple of those changes will be very noticeable to fans. 

Until this year, defensive pass interference had been a spot penalty -in other words, the ball was moved to the point where the infraction occurred. This season, for the first time, defensive pass interference is a 15-yard penalty and an auto­matic first down. 

The 
other noticeable change is onthe kickoffs. In order to increase the number of kickoff returns, a new rule states that kickoffs that travel beyond the end zone in the air will be brought out to the 30-yard line, rather than the 20 as in past years. 


Other rule changes include: 

Decreasing the amount of legal clips. 

Modifying 
the rules on "crackback" blocks. 



Making more specific definitions of permissable types of equipment. 


Reducing the penalty for violation of the two-yard zone when a player is making an unmolested fair catch from fifteen yards to five yards. 


Penalizing 1 5 y~ds an offensive player who grabs a face mask.

Don't Drive Drunk 
Tomorrow, the students of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's will be in the 
Hoosier Dome. 
Tonight and tomorrow night, they'll be on the town. And in the bars. 
The temptation to drink and drink heavily outside the jurisdiction of the 
Great Alcohol Policy will be high indeed in Indianapolis. The University says drunkenness is a problem among students. Perhaps. 'The Indiana State Police say it's a crime, especially ifyou're driving. That's definite. 
Drinking and driving don't mix, but the new alcohol policy seems to have forced the two together. Two separate off-campus parties last weekend each drew crowds of500 people or more. Police were called to break them up, and nine people were eventually arrested. 
It's scary to think how everyone got home. 
Among 15-to 24-year-olds, drunk driving is the number one cause ofdeath. According to the Governor's Task Force to Reduce Drunk Driving, one out of every 10 drivers during weekend nights is drunk. The statistics are awesome. But think for a moment beyond the statistics: a mother, a father, a teenage brother and the hurt of those who live to remember. Drunk driving breaks hearts. 
No one is saying that people should stop drinking or that people should stop having a good time. just promise yourself and your friends that you'll never drive after you've had too many. 
Have a blast in Indianapolis, but hey, let's be careful down there.

P.O.Box Q  
Mosquito virus Dear Editor: Friday's Observer carried an article entitled 'A Merciful Killing" that contains an error I feel must be pointed out. Mr. Cimino wrote that "Tracy was bitten by a mosquito carrying a herpes simplex strain of viral encephalitis." At best, medical history has been made, at worst a family has been greatly misinformed concerning their daughter's illness. Herpes simplex is a virus that is transmitted from person to person, generally throu~ con­tact with virus-laden saliva. Most cliildren become infected before the age of 5 and remain infected for life -the virus resides in a latent state in nerve tissues. When the virus is reactivated due to stress in the human host such as fever, sunburn, menstruation, and so forth, the most common symptom is the "cold sore" or fever blister." Worldwide 70-90 per­cent of adults have antibody to herpes type I virus so the majority of people have been in­fected with this virus. On rare occasions, reac­tivation of the virus results in an infection of the central nervous system, and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) results. This rare illness is frequently fatal. Mosquitoes carry a variety of viruses that  that would have permitted identification of president in student affairs, as quoted in The the virus, and shown that it wa., not mosquito­Observer on Saturday, August 25, "This is borne.

Coupled with misin­enough to vote in public elections, serve in formation, a patient or their family may never the armed forces, and yes, drink alcohol in know what caused the illness. much ofthe free world. Notre Dame truly has many of the finest young men and women in Paul R. Grimstad, Director the country, and we deserve to be treated as LaboratoryforArbovirus adults. The policies of the administration Research andSuroeillance restrict our lives in many ways; both the good times, and the mistakes that we will inevitably make. I am not asking to put a keg in my closet; I would simple like to make a few decisions for myself.In loco parentis jeffCoyle Sophomore Dear Editor: No, this is not another letter attacking the alcohol policy: the administration is under the Skorcz response impression that we are their children in all regards, not simply on Friday and Saturday iJear J::ditor: night. Under the administration's policy ofin After reading Chris Skorcz's response to the locoparentis, the administration believes that "Freshmen's Comprehensive Guide to the it has the right to be our parents while we are Campus," we felt compelled to respond im­away from home.

For at all amused by the infantile nature of the let­years the admissions department and its ter. leader, John Goldrick, current associate vice Mr. Skorcz showed a very obvious president for resident life, prided itself on ad­deficiency in humor in writing such an asinine mitting some of the brightest and most response.

Yet once admitted, the students best, and letters like Skorcz's just give all fresh­were treated like children. The alcohol policy, men a bad name.  New patriotism DearEduor: After reading Bill Healy's Wednesday edito­rial "The Gipper Wants ND," I feel compelled to respond in the utmost enthusiastic manner. In the words of the Republican party, "This is the clearest choice we have had in years." Compared to the anarchy that existed in the United States during the term ofthe Carter ad­ministration, America appears to be a ship on tranquil waters. With the economy shining brighter than it has for the past 50 years, and with our position in worldwide political circles garnering more respect with each policy decision, our nation seems to be climb­ing out ofthe Carter/Mondale abyss ofthe late '70's. As a further point not mentioned in the edi· torial, over the last four years the internal character ofthe United States has undergone a complete facelift. Most people (myselfinclud­ing) feel much more proud to be an American now than after the previous administration. Increased military recruitment and flag waving, and even the national fervor over the Olympics exemplify the fact that many Americans are proud to have the letters "USA" tatooed across their garmentry. I say again-the choice is simple. On the first Tuesday in November you will have to con­-trast two diametrically opposed political ideologies: a decadent liberalism mixed in the  

also infect the central nervous system. In the Midwest we have at least 6 mosquito-borne viruses that can cause encephalitis in humans. However, herpes simplex virus is not one of them; it is simply not a mosquito-borne virus. There are unfortunate cases where uni­nformed doctors have told parents that the encephalitis their child was suffering from was caused by a mosquito bite when in fact the docwr had not even taken blood samples parietals, pre-ordained class schedules, end­less lines, a laundry service for males, maids, approval of our choice of movies, and the presence ofreligious fathers, brothers, and/or sisters in each hall are just some examples of our adolescent treatment. 
Th~ limitations on parties in private rooms are another example of administrative med­dling in our private lives. This action was defended by Sister Jean Lenz, assistant vice 
What is really disturbing in this case is that up to now we had been impressed by Notre Dame's admission standards and the genuine intelligence exhibited by most everyone we've met. 
Perhaps Mr. Skorcz should lighten up and take himself a little less seriously.

tar pits ofpast failure or a new conservatism, a bright torch to light the way to a shining future for the United States and the world. All that is asked is that we, on November 6, make the logical choice, the right choice -the only choice. Remember, when the curtain is drawn and the lever is about to be pulled, vote with your head, not in spite ofit.

McEnroe reaches 
U.S. Open semifinals 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Despite a flurry of adverse line calls and a warning from the umpire, top-seeded john McEnroe corralled his anger and collared a spot in the U.S. Open Ten­nis Championships semifinals with a 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Gene Mayer last night. 

McEnroe, seeking his fourth title in America's premier tennis event, next will meet Jimmy Connors, who has won here on the hardcourts at the National Tennis Center the last ·' 
two years.
Connors advanced earlier in the day by eliminating Great Britain's John Lloyd 7·5, 6-2, 6-0. 
The fiery McEnroe, visibily hold­ing his famed temper in check, closed out his battle with the unseeded Mayer in typical McEnroe flair, firing a pair of aces on the the last two points of the match. 
Then, as he walked across the court, leaving the scene of his latest success, McEnroe stopped and

raised his hand hil.dl, like a matador, 

turning completely around in a sa­·~

"We're going to go with a three­man rotation," said Stock, "even though through spring practice Pat Cusack (a junior walk-on at the flanker position) has done a real fine job.

"It'll depend on the contest," says Stock. "If Purdue is up to stopping our run, then of course the pass is

With so many weapons, the Irish will be tough to beat tomorrow. 
Abraham decides on Syracuse 
Associated Press 
SYRACUSE, N.Y. · Tailback Byron Abraham, who on Monday announced his plans to transfer from Notre Dame, said yesterday that he will enroll at Syracuse. One of the most highly recruited football players in New York state after his 1982 senior season, Abraham will be returning home to play for the Orangemen. 
He will have to sit out the cur­rent football season but will be eligible to play in 1985. 
Abraham said on Wednesday that he had lost hope of cracking the starting lineup with the Irish, where, of course, tailback Allen Pinkett has two more years to play. 
"I just wasn't happy there -not with football, not with the social life, not with anything," said Abraham. "I guess I'm just a New York boy." 
Syracuse coach Dick MacPher­son has awarded Abraham a pre­viously uncommitted scholarship. Notre Dame released Abraham after he talked with Coach Gerry Faust. Without the release, Abraham would have been ineligible for financial aid while redshirting this year at Syracuse.

Faces Purdue Sunday 

Field hockey team opens season 
By TOM FAY 
Sports Writer 
A young, but aggressive, Irish field hockey team is tuning up for its season opener against Purdue, which happens Sunday at 3 p.m. on Alumni Field. First-year head coach Jill Undenfield is optimistic about the team, although she is not too familar with the opponents on the schedule. 
lbis year's squad is definitely young. Only one senior, co-captain Toby Martin, is on the team. Along with this year's other co-captain, junior goalie Patti Galagher, Martin will try to lead the Irish to another winning season. 
Notre Dame's strong point this year will be its defense. Anchoring that defense will be Galagher, who is looking forward to another out­standing season, and a pair of juniors, Christina Weinman and Regina Degnan. Also helping out 
around the net will be Mary Rose Rodgers, another junior. 
Woodley throws two TD passes 

Steelers topple Jets, 23-17 
Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.-David Woodley, coming back four days after a concussion, tossed two short touchdown passes, and Gary Ander­son booted three field goals, as the Pittsburgh Steelers topped the New York Jets, 23-17, last night in a mistake-filled game. 
Woodley, knocked out oflast Sun­day's opening-game loss to Kansas City in the third quarter, hit rookie Louis Lipps with a 6-yard TD pass in 
the ftrst period. Then, he tossed a 3­yard lob that another rookie, Weegie Thompson, plucked out ofthe air for the go-ahead score in the third per­iod. 
Anderson had field goals of32 and 43 yards in the second quarter, and 27 in the fourth quarter. But he hooked two more, one from 27 and one from 30 yards out. 
The Jets, playing before a crowd of 70,654 in their first regular­season home game at Giants Stadium -they moved from New York's Shea 
Stadium after last season -had taken a 14-13 lead on Bobby Humphery's 97-yard touchdown return with the second-half kickoff. It was the Jets' 
first touchdown on a kickoff return since Burgess Owens did it against Denver in 1973. 
But New York, also 1-1, could hold the lead for only a little more than two minutes. On the fit'st play after Greg Buttle intercepted a Woodley pass at theJets 4 2, quarter­
back Pat Ryan was forced to back­pedal under a Steeler blitz. As he did, he hit his right knee with the ball and 
The best has a taste all its own. 

Offensively, Notre Dame is count­ing on the services of sophomore Corinne DiGiacomo to fill the huge hole left in the line-up by the gradua­tion of its all-time leading scorer, Claire Henry. But ifDiGiacomo con-

Jill Lindenfield 
tinues to progress from her 18-goal season as a freshman, then that hole should be adequately covered. 
Another outstanding offensive force returning for the Irish is junior Molly McCabe. McCabe, a halfback, 
it squirted to the turf, ro be picked up by Robin Cole and returned to theJets 13. 
Three plays later, Woodley lobbed the ball into the air from the 3-yard line where the 6-6 Thompson leaped over Davlin Mullen to pull it in to give the Steelers a 20-14 lead. 
The Jets had a chance to regain the lead later in the period when Chuck Ramsey's punt bounced off the leg ofSteelers rookie Terry Long 
and was recovered by Greg Bingham at the Pittsburgh 49. After the Jets 

is a superb playmaker who is closing in on the Notre Dame all-time assist 
mark held by Giana Marrone. McCabe needs only five more assists to shatter the record. 
Along with junior Melissa Som­mer, the two should provide an of­fensive punch that will be needed if the team is to have any success this year. 
Other strong points for the Irish include speed, aggressiveness, and the good relationship that has developed between Coach Linden­field and her players. 
If keys like DiGiacomo and Galag­her can come through with superb seasons, the team can get improve­ment in passing that would build a potent offensive attack, and fresh­men hopefuls like Mary Jane Beetel, Janet Budnick, Maureen O'Neil, Joanne Marshall, and Benet DeBerry can contribute somewhat, then the Irish will be on their way to a very successful season. After that, things can only get better because of how young the team is. 
moved to the Pittsburgh 10, they were pushed back by a sack and two penalties. So, they had to settle for Pat Leahy's 52-yard field goal, the 
longest in Jets history, that made it 20-17. 
Pittsburgh then marched 79 yards in 10 plays for Anderson's 27-yard field goal. 
Pittsburgh'" Sam Washington in­tercepted two Ryan passes to stop two late Jet possessions, and Rick Woods picked off a desperation toss from Ryan on the game's last play. 
Brian Lawton powers Team USA over Czechoslovakia 
Associated Press 
BUFFALO, N.Y. · Two second­period goals by the Minnesota North Stars' Brian Lawton snapped a 1-1 tie and powered Team USA to a 3-2 Canada Cup victory over Czechos­lovakia yesterday. 
Lawton chopped a rebound out of the air past Czechoslovakia goalie Dominik Hasek to give the United States the lead and then added the 
winning goal eight minutes later on a setup by Bobby Carpenter. 
Neal Broten, who also plays for the National Hockey League's North Stars, scored in the first period. 

Vincent Lukac scored both goalsfor the Czechoslovaks. 
The victory gave the U.S. a 2-0-1 record in the six-nation round­robin tournamentJ while the Czec­hoslovaks droppeo to 0-2-1.

When the ball is hit onto the field, the batsmen have the choice of either running to the other wicket or of staying at their own. If they decide to run, both batsmen must run at the same time and reach the safety area. This is considered a run and they continue to bat. The bowler continues to bowl un­til he has bowled six balls, which is called an over; then a new bowler takes his pia~ at the other end. This pattern continues until the wickets are all dislodged or thirty overs have been bowled. The four ways a batsmanis consid­ered out are: ( 1 ) bowled, which is when the ball hits a wicket; ( 2) a fielder catches the ball; ( 3) a run­out, which is when a fielder throws the ball in and knocks down a wicket before the batsman reaches the safety crease; (4) leg before wicket (LBW) out, which is when the batsman gets hit by the ball, but the umpire rules that it would have hit a wicket; and ( 5) stumped, which is when a batsman gets outside of his safety crease and the wicket-keeper knocks down a wicket before the batsman can get back into the four­foot box. The object of the game, as it is with most games, is to score more runs than the other team. When Sunday rolls around and the excitement of Saturday's football game with Purdue has worn off, a cricket match might just be worth your while. No matter what the outcome, it will probably be like nothing you've ever seen in your life_ 
Cubs 4, Expos 1 
Associated Press MONTREAL · Ryne Sandberg's sacrifice fly scored Bob Dernier from third in the eighth to lead the Chicago Cubs to a 4-1 victory over the Montreal Expos last ni~t.

Irish go for national championship 

By MARY SIEGER 
Sports Writer 
This is it. This is the year to win the NCAA Division II national cham­pionship. 
At least that's what members of the Notre Dame women's tennis team say. Since the squad is in better shape, better spirits, and more am­bitious than last season, it will pursue its goal more aggressively than in the past. 

"It's do or die for us this season since it's our last one in Division II," explained Notre Dame head coach Sharon Petro. "The conference is in­sisting we move up to Division I, meaning we won't be in contention'\ ~ ' for NCAA national championships."
' 

The Irish begin their quest for the national championship today as the team travels to West I..ayfayette, Ind., to face the Purdue Boilermakers in their first dual meet of the season. 
This afternoon's meet against the Boilermakers promises to be a diffi­cult challenge for the Irish. Two years ago, the Boilermakers easily defeated Notre Dame, while last season the Irish rebounded to soundly defeat them. Now the Boilermakers are looking 
' i .. ' to even the score.

Associated Press 
The Big Tenfootball season opens in full force tomorrow highlighted by top-ranked and defending na­tional champion Miami's invasion of 14th-ranked Michigan before a sel­lout throng of 104,000 at Ann Arbor. 
Although Michigan coach Bo Schembechler would like to have played at least one game before en­countering the powerful Hur­ricanes, the possibilities of an upset loom big. 
Miami already has played two games, defeating then top-ranked Auburn, 20-18, Aug. 27, and follow­ing that with a 32-20 triumph over Florida last Saturday. The Hur­ricanes will be playing their third game in a period of 12 days. 
"Those were two physical games and we have a lot of injuries," said Hurricane first-year coach Jimmy Johnson. "The schedule is taking its toll, the players and the coaches are drained. We did not play as well as we can Saturday. We don't have the spark we had." 
In a way, Schembechler likes the idea ofopening against Miami. 
"Playing the No. 1 team is an inter­esting way to open the season," said Schembechler, "a little different than playing a non-ranked team. We're lookingforward to this game.

After the Purdue meet, the team plans to rejoin other Notre Dame students at the Hoosier Dome, and then remain in Indianapolis for a North Star Conference meet against Butler University on Sunday. The Irish expect to defeat Butler, and Petro is hoping to tally a score similar to last year's 9-0 rout.

"Quarterback is our strong posi­
tion and we will throw more this 
year," promised Bo, who in the past 
has not been exactly a disciple ofthe 
aerial game. 

If the Wolverines are to spring an 
upset, they will have to stop the 
Miami passing attack led by Bernie 
Kosar who has passed for more than 
200 yards in six consecutive games 
and has three games of 300 or more 
yards. 

~ "Kosar has a good arm, is tall and blessed with good receivers," said Schembechler.

Ohio State, No. 6, will take on Oregon State; Notre Dame, No. 7, faces Purdue in Indianapolis'Hoosier Dome; 1Oth-ranked lowa will be home against rival Iowa State, and Northwestern, a 24-16 loser to defending champion Illinois in last week's season and conference opener, goes to 19th-ranked Wash­ington. 
The rest ofthe schedule finds Mis­souri at Illinois, Rice at Minnesota, Northern illinois at Wisconsin, In­diana at Duke1 and Michigan State at Colorado.

win," explained Lafratta. However, there are two new faces in the Notre Dame line-up who show great potential for the squad. Junior Izzy O'Brien, a transfer stu­dent from the University of Mic­higan, and freshman Michelle Dasso are both expected to add a new di­mension to the team. "Izzy will wind up in the middle of the line-up and Michelle will prob­ably be playing at number six," says Petro. "Michelle should move up in the line-up as she starts playing bet­ter." Last May, the Irish took a disap­pointing third place at the national tournament in Chattanooga, Tenn. In the semi-final round, Notre Dame lost to the University of Tennessee­Chattanooga, which eventually won the national championship. "It's disappointing because we came so close to winning and we really could have done it," explained l..afratta. "They were the national champs and, as we started to play, we realized we could win. They just happened to get more points. Now we know we can do it." Since the final matches of the na­tional tournament were lost in the third sets, Petro suspects intensive conditioning will give the team the boost it needs to win the national title. "Our emphasis will be on condi­tioning, anticipation and footwork," said Petro. "Ifwe work on that, then we'll stand a good chance ofwinning the nationals." 
from a broken leg suffered last May and is available. 
Purdue Coach Leon Burtnett has decided on his quarterback but refuses to announce it until gametime. It'll be between Jim Everett and Doug Downing. 
"We've prepared for both of them," said Notre Dame Coach Gerry Faust, who will go with sopho­more Steve Beuerlein, a starter in eight games last season. 
Wisconsin lost Randy Wright but Coach Dave McClain appears com­fortable with Mike Howard and said, "We like the progress Mike Howard has made and, hopefully, by mid­season we will not miss Randy Wright." 
Veterans will man quarterback positions at most Big Ten schools this season with Chuck Long at Iowa, Jack Trudeau at Illinois, Sandy Schwab at Northwestern, Steve Bradley at Indiana, Brett Sadek at Minnesota, and Dave Yarema at Mic­higan State.

India vs. "The World" 

Cricket comes to Notre Dame 
ByTOMYOON 
Sports Writer 
This Sunday at 11 :30 a.m. behind Stepan Center, the gentlemen's game of cricket will be played for the first time at Notre Dame. The game is being sponsored by the In­ternational Students Organization, and will showcase a meeting be­tween India, which is captained by Hemant Tiwari, and "The World," which is captained by Winston Grif­fin. 
Cricket, which is the mother sport of baseball, originated in England and later spread to its various colonies. The game is now played in England, Australia, the West Indies, India, Pakistan, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, and South Africa, a country which is banned from international competition. Cricket is the national summer sport for each of these countries, much as baseball is for the United States. 

The game ofcricket is played with two teams, each consisting of I 1 players who all dress in white. lbe field is oval-shaped and measures ap­proximately 100 yards by 70 yards. The 22-yard-long rectangular area in the middle of the field is called the pitch, and fans will find that this is 
where  most  of  the  action  takes  
place.  
There  are  three  positions  in  
cricket;  the  bowler,  the  wicket­ 

keeper, and the fielders. The bowler, who serves the same function as a pitcher in baseball, hurls the ball, which is made of leather and harder than a baseball, toward the batsman at about 80 miles per hour. But unlike baseball where the strike zone is horizontal, the strike zone is vertical from the ground up to the waist. 
Behind the batsman is the wicket­keeper, who is equivalent to the catcher, and the other nine players are the fielders, who play without gloves. At opposite ends of the pitch are wickets, equivalent to the bases in baseball. 
In playing cricket, one batsman is at each wicket, each able to hit the ball. The bowler starts by running from outside the pitch area and, upon reaching the pitch line, bowls the ball to the batsmen, who can hit it in any direction. If the ball is hit and rolls out of the boundary, the team is awarded four runs, but ifthe

Was 1983 season slap that Irish needed? 
You may remember the old aftershave commercial where a guy get:'! slapped in the face and says, "Thanks, I needed that." Well, it may be too early to tell, but it appears that the 1983 football season may just have been the slap that Notre Dame -both fans and team, alike -needed. 
At the time the entire '83 season was unraveling, I doubt few people were thinking that this might be the season that finally got the Irish rolling. This still may not prove to be the case, but, with the Purdue opener only a day away, it really appears that everybody is approach­ing the season in the right way. 
What last season did was convince everybody sur­rounding Notre Dame football to calm down. This doesn't mean that people sat down and told themselves d1at they were losing their cool and that they needed to change. What it means is that all of us have finally decided to take a more low-key, let's-wait-and-see ap­proach. 
Last year at this time, everyone was talking national championship. The schedule was one of the easiest in a long time and, we were told, the team had finally put everything together. A 52-6 win over Purdue just added to the wild emotion. By the end of the year, though, everyone was screamtng for Gerry Faust's head and some were even talking about how they didn't care about football any more. 
This year, more people are talking about the bus trip to the Hoosier Dome than are talking about the ~me. Preseason polls are nice to look at, but most realize that they don't mean much. 
These types ofwild swings in emotion are so charac­teristic ofNotre Dame football fans. Notre Dame people 

Mike Sullivan 
Sports Editor 

can become so emotional, so fanatical, about their team that they reach the point of being obnoxious. When the team is winning, the coach and players are the most loved people in the world. But, when the team is strug­gling like it has the past three years, the coach and players have to shield themselves from the taunts, criticisms and "expert" solutions. 
That is why Notre Dame fans are the best around when things are going well, and brutal when things aren't. 
It appears now, though, that these fans, or at least the student body, have decided not to get too excited-yet. Everyone is as anxious as everfor the season to start, but they are being much more careful than in the past. They have learned to take nothing for granted. They have learned not to take it for granted that Notre Dame will go to a major bowl. They have learned not to take it for granted that Notre Dame will beat teams like Oregon and Arizona. They have learned not to take it for granted that God made Notre Dame Number One. 
Everybody knows that there is a huge amount of tal­ent on this Notre Dame team. But everybody also has learned that it takes more than talent to win football games. 
Even more importantly, the football team is begin­ning to realize it. It may be wishful thinking, but even emotional Gerry Faust seems to have calmed down. He isn't talking as much as he has in the past, preferring to keep his attention on the football field. He knows that he has been too much of a cheerleader during games. He knows that he can improve as a coach. And, as long as he realizes it, it's a step in the right direction. 
The players, too, have taken a much more business­like approach. They admit that they took a few teams lightly. They also realize that they sometimes got too emotional in games where the breaks went against them. They say that they are just going to go out and play 60 minutes of tough football. 
This all sounds great, but, ofcourse, all that matters is what happens on the field. Actions really do speak louder than words. By now, we all know this, though. 
Ofcourse, maybe all ofthis is wishful thinking. Maybe this season will turn out like the past three. Maybe the team will win big early and fold in November. Maybe everyone will be hanging "Oust Faust" banners from their windows. 
Then again, maybe not. 
If the team does well this season, the old fanaticism may come back. But, then, we don't want to look so far down the road. The only road we need to look down is Route 31 on the way to Indianapolis. 
If you recall that aftershave commercial, the hero of the story had lost control of his plane and was heading for a crash. Then the slap in the face allowed him to regain control. Notre Dame football needed a slap in the face to get back to its winning tradition. Let's hope that 1983 was that slap.
