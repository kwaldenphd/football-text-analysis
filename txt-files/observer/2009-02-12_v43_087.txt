By MADELINE BUCKLEY 
News Writer 

The Grant Schmidt-Cynthia Weber ticket emphasized its experience and platform research while the Laura Burdick-Derek Sanchez ticket accused their opponents of recycling"ideas from old cam­paigns in the run-off debate for student bony president and vice president Wednesday night in LaFortune. 
Schmidt, a junior, and Weber, a sophomore, along with juniors Burdick and Sanchez, advanced to com­pete in the run-off election after neither ticket won 50 

percent of the vote in the general election Monday. 
The debate, moderated by George Chamberlain, presi­dent of the Judicial Council, featured questions from the Council and the audience wit~ a chance for the candi­dates to give a rebuttaJ. 
Schmidt and Weber said they present a comprehen­sive and well-researched platform with feasible ideas. 
"I think a lot of people have questioned our taxi reform," Schmidt said. "But these are things I have been looking at for a really long time. We need to accomplish these big initiatives."

Knights raise money for several charities 

Organization collects $48,325 from selling steak sandwichs at home football games 
said the 2008 profit was good considering there was one fewer home game than recent years, and that the weather was rainy the day of the Michigan game. 
On a football weekend with good weather, they sell about 3,000 steaks, said Redden, a junior at Notre Dame. 
"People buy them faster than we can make them, so there:s always more of a demand than we can get them cooked," he said. "So one of the challenges is to get started early enough that you can make enough of a

There's a lot of money in steak sandwiches, at least when you sell them prior to Notre Dame home football games. 
The Notre Dame chapter of the Knights of Columbus made a profit of $48,325 dur­ing the 2008 football season. The Knights, a fraternal serv­ice organization, are current­ly in the process of distribut­ing these funds to several charities, as they do every year.

Exhibit features poet's works 
Ingeborg Bachmann's life and literary achievements on display at library 
By LIZ LEFEBVRE 
News Writer 
The prominent exhibit "Writing Against War" fea­turing the life and works of renown Austrian-born poet Ingeborg Bachmann will open on the second floor of the llesburgh Library Thursday at 5 p.m. 
The multi-media display focuses specifically on the theme of war throughout Bachmann's life and literary achievements. 
The ceremony will feature a presentation and reading by poet and Bachmann translator Peter Filkins of Bard College. A reception will follow the event. 
The exhibit will be on dis­play at Notre Dame through March 8. This is the first stop on the exhibit's United States tour, though it has been traveling throughout Europe since 2003. The Austrian Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs provided the exhibit and it has already appeared at 57 dif­ferent locations and been translated into seven lan­guages. 
Bachmann, a famous writer of poems, radio plays, short stories, novels and literary theory essays, became one of the leading voices in post-war German literature. Her works repre­sent a large body of anti­war writing, as she used language to challenge the chronic state of war in the world. Each year a presti­gious award is given out in her name and memory to an outstanding work of Germanophone literature. 

German professor and Nanovic Institute fellow, Anita McChesney was responsible for bringing the exhibit to Notre Dame. 
"Ingeborg Bachmann's works present singular vision of literary protests against wars that touched her life, and they reflect both a criticism of war's atrocities as well as the continued hope for peace," McChesney said. "This

Caiilpuses, conununity seek better relationship 
By SARAH MERVOSH 
News Writer 

Improving relationships between Notre Dame students and South Bend residents and concerns with otT-campus hous­ing were two issues discussed Wednesday at the Community Campus Advisory Coalition (CCAC) meeting, held at the County-City Building in South Bend. 
Student and faculty represen­tatives from Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross met with South Bend Police Department (SBPD) officers and leaders from the community for the third time this year to talk about communi­ty and student related issues. 
Council chairman Al Kirsits said one issue of concern between community members and students are parties and alcohol-related matters. But overall, the number of parties and incidents involving drinking has been down this year, he said. 
Kirsits said the best way to handle alcohol-related issues is continued education. 
The coalition would like to set up a booth on alcohol awareness at a spring event on campus and look into educating students by having them drive golf carts while wearing D.U.I goggles. The goggles distort the wearer's vision as if they were intoxicat­

Web site discussed. ininformal meeting 
By MADELINE BUCKLEY 
News Writer 
·Student Senate held an informal meeting Wednesday to discuss the creation of a Web site with information about South Bend geared towards students. 
The meeting was informal because the group lacked enough members for quorum and could not call the meeting to order. 
Community Relations com­mittee chair Gus Gari said the off-campus Web site will be broken up into tabs routing students to different cate­gories, such as entertainment, off-campus livisg, safety and security and more. 
"The bottom line is this is useful to the entire student body," he said. 
For example, Gari said the site will have information about different off-campus housing options and how to sign a lease for students who are contemplating moving. The housing options tab would give students all the informa­

On Saturday -known to some as Valentine's Day, to others as Singles Awareness Day, still to others as Jon McLaughlin Day -pitchers and catchers will begin reporting to their spring training camps all along the warm parts of the country. 
Actually, the pitchers and catchers of one team will start reporting on Friday the 13th. Interesting that the Yankees think of themselves as above bad luck. 
Baseball season is my favorite part of the year. I'm a happier person when I have sports to ease my stress, and basketball just doesn't cut it. Granted, sometimes it adds to my stress, but that's what you get for being a Notre Dame student from Cleveland. 
The new season is al!eady brim­ming with storylines, including yet another steroid scandal, C.C. Sabathia in those oh-so-slimming pinstripes, and my personal favorite, Manny-Being-Unemployed. 
In my mind, though, the new sea­son is still a blank slate. 
Anything can happen over the course of five months and 162 base­ball games. Every year, experts make predictions, and every year, they're proved completely wrong. 
Remember the beginning of 2008's season, when the Tigers were sup­posed to score 1000 runs and easily win the World Series? Remember the end of the 2008 season, when the Tigers finished last, behind the Kansas City Royals? 
I feel the urge to make fun of the Yankees and Cubs more, but it's not fair because I've already targeted them. Plus, it's just too easy. 
The point is that, lame as it sounds, every team is undefeated right now. 
There's a point in every season where the general attitude among Indians fans switches from "It's Tribe Time Now!" to "There's always next year... " 
Well, guess what. It's 2009. It's Tribe Time Now. And there's always this year.

Italy's politicalland~cape discussed 
Ambassador Guido Lenzi addresses country's history and origins 
By BECKY HOGAN News Wrirer 
In the Gallery of Bond Hall, adorned by Roman casts and sculptures, Italian ambassa­dor Guido Lenzi described Italy's complicated character to a packed room on Wednesday. 
"Italy is a country of con­tradictions. It's a land of improvisation -things are made up at the spur of the moment, and inventiveness is part of the life of everybody," Lenzi said. 
Lenzi described Italy as a "grown-up teenager" because it is "full of life, inventive and smiling but totally irresponsi­ble." 
He explained the nation's history and origins. 
"Italy is a very young coun­try ... younger than the United States. It is a young country that has had a hard time holding itself together." 
According to Lenzi, Italy's fragmented nature can be attributed to the city-states, which preceded Italy's unifi­cation. 
"The city-states account for the fact that local allegiances are much stronger nowadays. People are first Florentine and Tuscan, and only eventu­ally Italian," Lenzi said. "They are very provincial and local-minded ... which is the strength of Italy, but also means that it is not a coher­ent whole." 
He said that bureaucracy does not play a fundamental role in Italian politics because people have learned

Italy needs to make itself more accessible to the inter­national community, he said. 
"Now we need Italy for the Europeans, for the European Union, for the Mediterranean, for the Balkan states. All of this has to be made coherent," Lenzi said. 
The Italian parliamentary democracy includes a strong parliament and a weak presi­dency, which has allowed for the spread of democracy and has ensured tl).at the country remains united, he said. 
He also discussed how the 
However, he argued that Italy's current prime minster, Silvio Berlusconi, is not to blame for Italy's polit­ical struggles. 
"[Berlusconi] is not the cause .of the Italian woes, Berlusconi is the conse­quence of such a state of affairs. He did not want to have an organ­
ized party. He was fed up with party system .... Everybody in Italy was involved in that system, you can't point the finger [at Berlusconi]," he said. 
Lenzi concluded that because Italy is a multilater­al-minded country without a strong national interest, it has an important role in international relations. 
"Italy is a front-line state. We have to be considered as a country that matters in pre­senting a united stance," he said. "Italy is a party-goer ... it is the most multilateral­minded country in Europe."

The Irish Marauders, a color guard and exhibition drill team of the Notre Dame Army ROTC, recently received an invitation to perform at the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York City, Officer-in-Charge, Justin Figueredo said. 
"We are really excited to be invited to march in this parade and provide the colors in a nationally televised event -not many teams are invited, so it is a huge honor to be recognized and invited to participate and represent Notre Dame," Figueredo, a senior, said. 
The team provides color guard for sporting leagues and charities off campus, and rep­resents Notre Dame:s Army ROTC at various events and functions throughout the nation. 
"Not many people know about the other component of the Irish Marauders ... the drill team," Figueredo said. 
The drill team is made up of about 17 Army ROTC students in all classes and has practice every week, he said. The Marauders are a voluntary group f!tr personal develop­ment, he said. 
"Since it is intended to be for enjoyment and the development of personal discipline, there are no tryouts for the team or cuts from the team," Figueredo said. 
He adds that their mission is "to develop leadership, confi­dence and teamwork while learning the art of Army cere­monies and rifle and exhibition drill techniques, including spins, throws and other maneu­vers." 
The team's performances involve silent drill, which requires that all rifle move­ments be executed at precise moments. 
"Our performances are a real show of discipline," adds Figueredo. "We move and spin our rifles with no beat or count­ing, but rather create our own beat which requires that all members be mentally sound and in complete sync with one another in order for it to work." 
Though they are challenging, the performances are also meant to be fun and exciting for team members and viewers alike, he said. 
The drill team's performances are "a lot of fun to watch and really demonstrate the values of the Army ROTC program. They are especially enjoyable for the team members." 
The Marauders drill team has been looking forward to its per­formance at the Irish women's basketball game Wednesday night, he said. 
"It is the team's first perform­ance outside the battalion and a great opportunity to show the public our drill team," says Figueredo. "Public performance is such a rewarding part of our practice and the team really enjoys putting on these exhibi­tions."

Election brings no peace to Israel 
JERUSALEM -Inconclusive election results sent Israel into political limbo Wednesday with both Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and hard-line leader Benjamin Netanyahu claiming victory and leaving the kingmaker role to a rising political hawk with an anti-Arab platform. 
Livni's Kadima Party won 28 seats, just one more than Netanyahu's Likud, in Tuesday's election for the 120-member parliament, according to nearly complete results. With neither party winning a clear majority, nei­ther can govern alone. Gains by right-wing parties give Netanyahu a better chance of forming a coalition with his natural allies. 
The results set the stage for what could be weeks of coalition negotiations. Israeli media reported the first meetings were scheduled for Wednesday.

The hospital was without its principal water supply Wednesday after a break to a city water main. Service was restored about 4 p.m., some 15 hours after the water main broke. 
Spokesman Sam Rogers says a boil advi­sory remains in effect for drinking water, so bottled water is being distributed to the hospital's 350 patients. But patients rtow can take showers and flush their toilets.

N. Korea preps long-range missile test 
Country scraps peace agreements, seeks to provoke neighbor and 'Win Obama's attention 
Associated Press 
SEOUL, South Korea ­North Korea appears to be gearing up for another long­range missile test, the latest in a series of provocative acts seemingly aimed at stoking tensions with South Korea and winning the attention of the new U.S. president. 
In recent weeks, Pyongyang has declared it will scrap peace agreements with Seoul and warned of war on the Korean peninsu­la. Reports that it could be preparing to test a missile capable of reaching the western United States have added to the anxiety. 
South Koreas Yonhap news agency reported Wednesday that a vehicle carrying radar equipment was seen moving to a launch site on the Norths eastern coast from a munitions fac­tory near Pyongyang. 
"It can be analyzed that the North is proceeding with a missile launch preparation in stages," Yonhap quoted a South Korean government official it did not name as saying.

"Over half the drivers in the cab companies work independently, and you think you can use the ticket, but they'll say 'I work independ­ently,"' she said. 
Schmidt also said both he and Weber bring experience to the roles, as Schmidt cur­rently serves as student body vice president and Weber is the sophomore class presi­dent. 
Burdick argued that as ath­letic co-chairs in the Hall Presidents Council, she and Sanchez have been part of many student groups, so they know what students want their leaders to accomplish. 
"Derek and I feel that since we have been a part of all these student groups, we get a lot better feedback," Burdick said. 
Sanchez said the biggest strength of the Burdick­Sanchez ticket is originality, and he attacked Schmidt and Weber's platform for "piggy­backing old ideas." 
"It's really easy to say you have a lot of research done when the ideas are old," he said. 
A question from the Judicial Council asked Burdick and Sanchez about the feasibility of their tuition reform plan. 
Sanchez said he and Burdick have discussed tuition with Joseph Russo, director of Financial Aid at Notre Dame and researched a public service loan pro­gram. Additionally, he said they want to lower the Student Activities fee. 
"Student Activity fees are something we can control," he said. "The more they go up, the more they burden our families." 
In response, Schmidt said the Student Activities fee did not rise under his current administration with student body president Bob Reish. It is currently at about $95 and will not increase, he said. 
Weber said she and Schmidt realize tuition is a significant issue for students, so they will push for textbook price reform. 
"We can't lower tuition but we can work at textbook prices and prices in the Huddle," she said. 
Burdick said textbook price reform was a platform idea presented last year in the Reish-Schmidt campaign, and pointed out that Schmidt and Weber can't decrease prices in the Huddle, they will only be able to display them.

Schmidt expanded on his textbook reform plan, explaining that student gov­ernment would challenge the monopoly the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore has on the classroom materials by mak­ing the ISBN numbers public and presenting a cheaper alternative.

Sanchez attacked this idea, stating that it is unoriginal, and claiming that the Burdick-Sanchez ticket will bring originality to the office.

ed. 
The Coalition also discussed zoning regulations that state where students can and cannot live ofT-campus. 
Council attorney Kathy Cekanski-Farrand said there have been two cases this year where students have had to find another residence mid­year because they were living in a house illegally. 
This typically doesn't hap­pen, but she is "afraid it's lead­ing towards Ibecoming) the norm," she said. 
Common Council member Ann Puzzello said single-family neighborhoods such as Harter Heights, are not meant for stu­dent housing. 
"Any student rentals in that neighborhood that involve more than two unrelated stu­dents are illegal, to be perfectly honest," Puzzello said. 
There are always exceptions, which is why this problem is hard to enforce. For example, a resident in a single-family area is able to rent out his or her house to one student, but is not allowed to nmt it out to two unrelated students, Puzzello said. 
New laws specifying zoning regulations might help, Kirsits said. 
"What we have now is very weak and I think we need to get some stronger base there so we can pursue this," he said. 
He also suggested informing students' parents about which areas are legal for their chil­dren to live in. 
Another problem addressed at the meeting was how to improve relationships between students who live off campus and their neighbors. 
"Four doors down, I have some college kids living there ... and it's been a disaster," said Kirsits, who clarified that by disaster, he meant that he had very little relations with them. "It has been difficult to get to know those guys and I've tried reaching out," Kirsits said. 
Student body president Bob Reish also saw the lack of rela­tionship between oiT-eampus students and community mem­bers. 
"There's still a feeling from that," Reish said. 

For example, there were some block parties held by community members, which few students attended, and block parties held by students, which few community mem­bers attended, he said. 
To improve such problems, Reish recommended an event that would push students and community members together in a way that would force them to communicate. 
He suggested having a com­munity service day where stu­dents and community members would do service together. 
This led to a more general discussion about the relation­ship between South Bend resi­dents and the University. 
Marguerite Taylor, a resident of the North East neighbor­hood, said many South Bend residents feel detached from University life. 
"[My fatherllived in the same house more than 60 years within walking distance of the campus and he'd never been on ... And l don't think he is unusual," Taylor said. 
Puzzello expressed interest in getting a tour of campus, or coming to campus for an event. 
"Just once, II'd like for com­munity members to) come in your area and enjoy some­thing," Puzzello said. 
Reish said there are events on campus that invite commu­nity members to participate. He pointed out the Keenan Hall Great Pumpkin event around Halloween. 
"Tours of campus might be a great start" in making commu­nity members feel welcome on campus, he said. 
But Reish also pushed for CCAC to take action. 
"I think this year has been more ... updates rather than action," he said. 
He said he thinks CCAC is a body that can unite the com­munity and the school, and hopes the council will focus on "community building, as opposed to being reactive." 
In an effort to open campus up to community members, the next meeting will be held at Notre Dame. It will be held at the end of March, although no date is finalized.

continuity with the previous administration is necessary. 
"There are a lot of things that will get carried over, and there are a lot of things that still need to get done," he said. 
Weber said a campaign platform is basically a plan for the year, so it makes sense to continue with the productive efforts of the old administration. 
When asked what the can­didates believe are the most 
However, Schmidt said that while they take the job seri­ously, they are regular col­lege students too. 
"We are normal students," he said. ''I'm from Dallas, Texas, she's from Tennessee. I like baseball and she likes guitar." 
Students will vote in the run-off election between 8 
a.m. and 8 p.m. Thursday.

IN BRIEF 
Madoff wife withdraws $15 million 
BOSTON -The wife of disgraced money manager Bernard Madoff withdrew more than $15 million from a firm co-owned by her husband-including $10 million on the day their children turned her husband over to authorities for overseeing an alleged $50 billion Ponzi scheme, the top securities reg­ulator in Massachusetts said Wednesday. 
Secretary of State William Galvin said Ruth Madoff. 67, withdrew $5.5 million on Nov. 25 and $10 million on Dec. 10 -the day before Bernard Madoff was arrested ­from Cohmad Securities Corp., a New York firm co-owned by her husband. I 
The secretary cited wire transfer records produced by Cohmad as proof of the with­drawals. They came as Madoff's scheme was unraveling as investors filed $7 billion worth of redemption requests. 
They also appeared to follow what authorities consider a disturbing trend on the part of the Madoffs to hide money that could be used to reimburse burned investors.

WASHINGTON -Facing a disgusted pub­lic and Congress, bank CEOs agreed with demands for greater accountability Wednesday in the first testimony on how they're spending money from the taxpayer­funded $700 billion bailout. 
"Both our firm and our industry have far to go to regain the trust of taxpayers, investors and public officials," John J. Mack, head of Morgan Stanley, told the House Financial Institutions Committee. 
Added JP Morgan Chase & Co.'s Jamie Dimon: "We stand ready to do our part going forward." 
The eight top bankers appearing before the panel were generally contrite and con­ceded they have work to do to win over a bitter public and an exasperated Congress. They had little choice but to acknowledge as much, given intense anger and anxiety as the troubled financial system continues to spiral downward in an ever-worsening recession. 

Congress, president pass stimulus bill 
Democrats work quickly to clear the way for $790 billion to help economy 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Moving with lightning speed, the Democratic-controlled Congress and White House agreed Wednesday on a compromise $790 billion economic stimulus bill designed to create millions of jobs in a nation reeling from recession. President Barack Obama could sign the measure within days. 
"More than one-third of this bill is dedicated to pro­viding tax relief for middle­class families, cutting taxes for 95 percent of American workers," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid at a Capitol news confer­ence where he was joined by moderates from both parties whose support is essential for the legisla­tion's final passage.

Last week the Notre Dame Office of International Studies (OIS) posted its decisions for the current sophomore class regarding their junior year study abroad aspirations. As some of my friends excitedly tore open letters, I began to think back to the application process myself. 
By any standard, the OIS is an over­whelming success. They successfully enroll nearly 40 percent of the stu­dent population into study abroad programs, and feature a wide range of programs across quite a few countries. U.S. News and World Report has given the Notre Dame OIS top marks for its study abroad. They have programs for students of every school, both undergraduate and graduate. 
However, there are a few issues with the process of applying for sophomore undergrads that are overly complicat­ed, confusing and hazy. First, the application process has come to resemble the arduous task that apply­ing to college was in the first place. I have heard the terms "get in" and "have an edge" used far more fre­quently for the study abroad process than I think is healthy. While the need to evaluate the appropriateness of can­didates for a program is necessary for the reputation of the department abroad and even just for space consid­erations, the confusion and stress inherent in the current process is not. 
If OIS wants the process to be com­petitive in this way, however, then it should takes steps to level the informa­tion playing field for applicants. In thinking back to my experiences in applying the college, I can't help but remember the magazines and books that included not only write-ups on the

experiences that different institutions provide, but also the statistical data proliling their students bodies. This included any number of metrics, from standardized test score averages, to acceptance ratf~. mean GPA, etc. They also would include information con­cerning the application process and evaluation standards. This set of infor­mation was essential in deciding which schools were appropriate for me both personally and academically. 
Simply providing this information would be the best way to improve this competitive application process. Right now, most of this information is sup­plied to prospective applicants through anecdotal situations and hearsay. This sort of information can l?e highly mis­leading, and for some students, fatal to their study abroad chances. 
While I (unfortunately) cannot docu­ment this, I have heard that the popu­lar Dublin, Ireland program is quite competitive. In one case, I heard that a 
3.7 was the bare minimum to "get in." In another, I heard it was a 3.2. Regardless, I was able to figure out, generally speaking, that Dublin was tough. A borderline student not privy to any of this information at all, may lead their application with Dublin or even put all of his eggs in just one bas­ket. In my own case, I based my own evaluation of my chances of accept­ance on the only student I could even find who had applied to the same pro­gram. 
Cleverer students who are generally more aware of the gossip surrounding each location's competitiveness maneuver differently, however, and exhibit a sort of flight to safety. With only one application and one chance this is the easiest way to ensure an experience abroad. 
To its credit, OIS has attempted to eliminate some of these problems by allowing students to apply to multiple programs and then ranking them in order of preference. The issue, again, is lack of information concerning the consequences of these decisions. At the first big meeting of my sophomore year, someone asked how a program's rank affects its chances of being accepted. The answer we were given was unclear and we came away with only a vague idea of what the best strategy for applying was. 
Posting some measurements and sta­tistics similar to those in a Fiske guide would eliminate many of these prob­lems. Even just a GPA range and acceptance rate would help consider­ably. With this information, Notre Dame students already savvy in com­petitive application processes would be more self-selecting in their choices. Borderline students would know which programs offer their best chance of acceptance, and the most qualified applicants would be confident in their decision to compete in one of the tougher programs. This could also expedite the process by eliminating a number of applications for students who are not confident enough to apply to only one or two places, but instead work on five or six applications. 
Ultimately, OIS does its best to try and sort everybody out into a predeter­mined number of spots. The depart­ment would help itself immeasurably if it acknowledged the necessary compe­tition that arises from the scarcity of spots more openly, and provided more of the information necessary about the process and competition itself in addi­tion to the great information already provided about the benefits and expe­rience accrued from each program. ­This would enable students to be more self sorting and cognizant of their chances of success come February.

IEWPOINT
Thursday, February 12, 2009 page 9 
Will Jesus show for the Louisville game tonight? 
What would be a justifiable spiritual insight from Campus Ministry to get us through our men's basketball team's seven-game losing streak? All of us­fans, players and coaches -have been 
disappointed and  
discouraged at how  Fr. Lou DeiFra  
the season has  
gone. But, ifsport  Faithpoint  
is a metaphor for  
life, then enduring  

unexpected losing streaks can teach us something about responding to disap­pointment in our own lives. But what? Or as the old bracelets would say: What Would Jesus Do ... on a seven-game los­ing streak? 
The easy -but ultimately dis-spiriting -answer is that, when we fail, God does­n't care. God's love is totally uncondition­al. God's love is constant, and non­dependent on our performance. While these things are certainly true, alone they seem to blaze a spiritually futile path. Because they come dangerously close to suggesting that what we do, and how well we do it, is ultimately meaningless. True enough, God's love for the members of our athletic teams has absolutely nothing to do with whether they win or lose, any more than God's love for us changes according to our GPA. But do we really wish to conclude that our efforts, then, mean nothing to God? 
Several Gospels point to the contrary. Perhaps most famously, the Parable of the Talents suggests that God rewards the efforts of those who invest their talents wisely, while being slightly less enthralled with ones who bury them. True, the Sermon on the Mount lauds the poor and the meek, but stops short of justifying los­ing on purpose, or not caring about our efforts. Mter all, Jesus concludes, "You are the light of the world. This light is not to be placed under a bushel basket." 
What the people in the Gospels do, and how well they do it, often matters -a ton. Peter and Andrew, James and John, have to make a decision about the use of their gifts when Jesus passes them on the seashore. Their heroic ending is not pre­determined; they could be (un)known today as four mildly successful Galilean fishermen. Contrast the woman at the well with the rich young man -both encounter Jesus' invitation to use their gifts in a stunningly converted way. One follows, and thrives. The other departs downcast. Our choices matter. 
In fact, it seems fair to say that the Gospels teach us that God cares deeply about our decisions about how to spend our lives and talents, and the energy and exuberance we invest in carrying them out. So, it cannot be the case that, because God's love is unconditional, therefore, it simply doesn't matter how much energy we spend in sharing our gifts. 
Still, before we go too far, we must con­tend with Jesus' lauding of the poor and mourning in that Sermon on the Mount. We must contend with Jesus' clear prefer­ence for sinners, tax collectors, and pros­titutes -surely not shining examples of folks maxing out their God-given talents. And we must contend, above all, with the central symbol of our faith-Jesus, mira­cle-worker and preacher extraordinaire, maxing out gifts like no one before ­hanging from a Cross -utterly defeated. 
The response of Christianity to human failure is profound, and complex -and fittingly so, for such is our existence. Our faith ought to match our experience in terms of profundity and complexity. Interpretations of Christianity that water down our disappointments and failures to "God will take care of everything in the end" may provide some temporary sooth­ing, but do they really convince and satis­fy us? 
Gazing at the Cross, it is difficult to think that Christianity is a religion that will claim to defend against losing streaks, preserve us from any and all hurt, or rid the world of suffering anytime soon. What the Cross does teach us is that some failure and disappointment -even sometimes great, seemingly insurmount­able failure and disappointment -is inevitable. If you're going to play the game, you're going to have losing streaks. If you're going to live, you're going to experience frustration and disappoint­ment. 
And what the Cross further teaches is that God is deeply present for it all. In fact, this central symbol of our faith con­tains within it the deepest promise of hope -that where we seem to fail, there God is most intensely present to us, trans­forming our failures and weaknesses into opportunities for new, resurrected life. As St. Paul wrote so full of hope, so defiant in the face of his weakness: "Where sin abounds, there grace abounds all the more." 
Or, as Jesus will gently point out in tonight's pre-game: "Where losing abounds, there you have to rebound all the more."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Genuine beauty and hook-ups 
How does beauty play into the hook-up cul­ture? What's the difference between external and internal beauty? What is "internal beau­ty?" Is there an inherent beauty in all of us? Why do people continue to hook-up? Can hooking-up be a hurtful addiction? Does hooking up validate our self-worth, through a recognition of external or internal beauty? 
Chances are, you have your own opinion on some, or all, of the above questions. There is no denying that the hook-up culture is alive and present at Notre Dame, and the underly­ing issues of beauty and respect deserve to be examined in the context of "why" hook-ups happen. Understanding that there may or may not be a "correct answer" to these ques­tions, the Edith Stein Project, an initiative of the Identity Project of Notre Dame, seeks to answer these questions through a six-student panel on Friday, Feb. 13 at 2:15p.m. in McKenna Hall, Room 102. 
The session will start with a brief presenta­tion on self-image and eating disorders by Caroline Lashutka, followed by a six-student panel that will present on the above ques­tions. The six students are: Nathan Loyd from ND Right to Life and Pure Love Club, Jim Redden and Michael Bohnert from the Knights of Columbus, Mark Skylling from Iron Sharpens Iron, and ND students Melissa Buddie and Katie Michel. While all panelists agree that we are called to live up to the inherent dignity of human beings, their views on internal and external beauty, as well as the hook-up culture, are varied. Each panelist will provide a personal testimony on how they see beauty in our society and how the forces of external or internal beauty play into hook­ing up, if at all. 
Whether you love a good hook-up, or are repulsed by the hook-up culture, this panel is for you. If you've done it a few times and are tempted or disgusted by the idea of doing it again, this panel is also for you.

Adtninistration kills fun 
I am not so much responding to Trey's comments ("Tradition never graduates," Feb. 9) as I am agreeing with them. In terms of society, Notre Dame separates itself from other schools from the start by having things like parietals and no frats or sororities. In our history, we have more than made up for it with dorm life rivaled by no one else. Is it even a question why so few students move off campus? 
With that dorm life has come some gre'at dorm tradi­tions. Both of my parents went here, and so for most of my life, I have gotten to listen to them talk about their times here. Now that I am a student I hear even more. Sometimes I go to dinner with my parents and their friends from school and I can tell you this: When they go down memory lane they are not talking about studying for tests and going to mass every Sunday. They tell stories involving alcohol (just a little), about going on panty raids to Saint Mary's, amazing dorm events and sneaking their cars on campus past the security guards. It's these traditions that keep our alumni so tight. 
I don't think the administration realizes how good they have it with this student body. In terms of immaturity and 
An epiphany 
Students of Notre Dame, I have seen the light, the beacon of eternal hope that Ms. Michelle Fordice lit for me and my peers in the Inside Column "Fashion at ND. Or Not" (Feb. 10). For so many yeaFs I have been marching around this dark cold world dressed no better than a slovenly mountain climbing gardener. In my foolish, self absorbed 19-year-old mind I completely for­got that I am the center of everyone's attention. How could I have been so inconsiderate when I dressed myself in the morn­ing? How dare I offend the eyes of those around me when I walk to class charading as a sherpa with my poor jeans stuffed visciously into my Ugg boots. What was I thinking wearing those sweatpants? Damn you sweatpants! Damn you and your false promises of comfort and your whispers of warmth. All the long days of my life I have been disgracing myself, my family, and my friends . 
Never again shall I dare to join the drones as they walk to DeBartolo in their North Face jackets and their classless boots. What right have I to wear mountainous paraphenalia? South Bend is probably the fifth flattest place on the planet, I say "If you can't see the mountain, don't act like you can." I am trad­ing in my blasphemous fleece for classic camo, with a military flare, and turning in my Uggs for a pointed toe and some extra height and by God ifI fall, I will fall in glory! 
P.S. I would like to take this time to issue a public apology to my legs. I'm sorry I turned you into stumps, you deserve better.

rowdiness we are nothing compared to the students at schools like Michigan, Penn State and USC, whose week­ends start on Wednesday nights. We are a different type of student body. 
That is why we chose to go here. We study, worship, and do service work, but we want to have fun with that as well. I am not a big partier, but I certainly understand that over­stressed young adults need to let go on the weekends and just have fun. Personally, when I get older, I want to be able to tell my kids about all the fun I had at school similar to what my father has told me. It certainly feels like the administration is doing all they can to eliminate that. They need to take-a lesson from history and Prohibition. If you try to take away our means of having fun, we will just find somewhere else to do it, and I'm sure the administration would love more off-campus parties.

The Manti cotneth 
On Feb. 4, Hawaiian Linebacker Manti Te'o signed his letter of intent to play football at our beloved Notre Dame. The very next day, Editor-in-Chief Chris Hine claimed that the expectation placed upon his soldiers was "absurd talk" ("Kids are too young to warrant such hype," Feb. 5). Absurd? Is it absurd to assume that Manti will tackle 100 people per game, sack 40 quarterbacks, intercept 21 passes, score 12 defensive touchdowns, beat USC, win tl1e Heisman, crush Tim Tebow, and save the economy, all the while leading us to the first of four consecutive undefeat­ed seasons and national championships?

Another week another dining hall dish! This week's recipes are .a bit varied, but they are all pretty tasty. The microwave has been out of commission at North for about a week, so hopefully it will return soon. In the meantime, all of these dish­es can be made without our favorite contraption. And as a special bonus? Look forward to the special Valentine's ·Day Dining Hall Dish tomorrow. · 
This week's recipes: 
Kicked Up Macaroni and Cheese 
Macaroni and cheese is that 
great homey meal that only improves with experimenta­tion. There are thousands of recipes out there putting varia­tions on this dish and starting with the basic macaroni and cheese the dining hall offers, you can have your own fun. 
Fill a bowl with as much macaroni and cheese as you want. 
Top with red pepper flakes and some blue cheese (Be careful not to overdo either. They both pack a pretty good punch, so you don't need a ton to get lots of flavor). The hot macaroni and cheese base should melt the blue cheese. 
Add in some steamed broc­coli (you will have to cut it up to make it bite-sized). 
Mix together. Feel free to try the same idea using different new ingredients. 
Mashed Sweet Potato 
The dining halls have baked sweet potatoes fairly often, and there is a lot you can do with them. This recipe is one of the easiest places to start. Most people think white when they think mashed potatoes, but using sweet potatoes puts a great twist on the traditional. The pepper and salt help to balance out the sweetness. 
Pick up a baked sweet pota­to. 
Remove the potato skins. 
Add a pat of butter, a lot· of pepper and some salt. If you have a sweet tooth you can add a small dab of maple syrup too. 
Mash it up with a fork, like you were making regular mashed potatoes. Enjoy. 
Quick Tip 

Make chili cheese fries! Take some French fries and top them with chili from the soup area (make sure to get a ladle with as little broth as possible so that the fries don't get soggy) and cheese. You can top it with sour cream and scal­lions if you like as well. Delicious. Thanks to Charlie Vogelheim for this idea.

MLB 
Ex-girlfriend files $15 n1illion la-wsuit against Alon1ar 
Dall alleges that Alomar insisted on having unprotected sex even though he showed symptoms of HIV 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -An ex-girl­friend of Roberto Alomar filed an explosive lawsuit alleging the former baseball star insist­ed on unprotected sex for four years despite having AIDS. 
The lawsuit, filed Jan. 30 and transferred to U.S. District Court on Wednesday, contains accusations that could not be corroborated but portray Alomar as someone who demanded sex without a con­dom despite showing obvious signs of HIV. 
Ilya Dall is seeking at least $15 million in punitive dam­ages from the 41-year-old for­mer infielder. Alomar, who was once engaged to tennis star Mary Pierce, spent 17 years in the majors and was one of the game's great s~cond basemen. 
.Calls seeking comment to lawyers for Alomar and Dall were not immediately returned. Alomar lawyer Charles Bach told the New York Daily News the allega­tions are "frivolous and base­less." 
News of the lawsuit was "something out of the blue," 
Alomar's father, Sandy Alomar Sr., told El Nuevo Dia newspa­per in Puerto Rico. "We've never talked about something like this." 
Dall said the two began dat­ing in spring 2002 and had unprotected sex for the next four years. She said that on several occasions during that time, Alomar refused to get tested for HIV, despite severe fatigue, sores on his mouth and throat, a constant cough and an infection of the esopha­gus that is associated with AIDS. 
She said Alomar finally relented and tested positive for HIV in February 2006. 
Dall said she was angered by the disclosure and was tested herself; the result was nega­tive. She said follow-up exams determined that Alomar had full-blown AIDS. 
By then, she said Alomar had purple skin, was foaming at the mouth and was too sick to walk, forcing him to need a wheelchair to get around at an airport. 
Dall said the ordeal caused her severe emotional and men­tal distress and fear she may one day test positive for HIV herself. 
She called the conduct of Alomar "outrageous with wan­ton reckless disregard of the health, safety and well-being" of Dall. 
The lawsuit does not say why Dall continued to have unpro­tected sex with Alomar. Dall said the couple lived together until last year. 
Alomar was one of baseball's best players in the 1990s, making 12 straight All-Star appearances and winning two World Series with the Toronto Blue Jays. 
A career .300 hitter with 10 Gold Gloves, Alomar broke in with the San Diego Padres in 1988 and also played for the Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Indians, New York Mets, Arizona Diamondbacks and Chicago White Sox. He was out of baseball by 2005. 
One of the most memorable moments of Alomar's career came in 1996, when he became enraged after a third strike and spit on umpire John Hirschbeck. He drew a five­game suspension that was later overturned.

Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Brett Favre's done with football-again. 
The 39-year-old quarter­back called the New York Jets on Wednesday morning to say he's retiring after 18 seasons, ending a record-setting career in which he became one of the NFL's all-time greats. 
"He felt he had given us everything he had," general manager Mike Tannenbaum said, "and it was time for him to move on." 
Favre, who retired last March only to return with the Jets, kept this goodbye simple -no tearful farewell or jam­packed news conferenr,e. 
His decision came six weeks after his only season with the 
IN BRIEF Tejada ~nters. guilty plea 
on stermd pel)ury charges 
WASHINGTON -Dressed in a defen­dant's dark suit instead of an All-Star's crisp uniform, Miguel Tejada became the first high-profile player convicted of a crime stemming from baseball's steroids era, pleading guilty Wednesday in federal court to misleading Congress about the use of performance-enhanc­ing drugs. 
Under a plea agreement with the same prosecutors pursuing a perjury indictment against Roger Clemens, Tejada admitted he withheld informa­tion about an ex-teammate's use of steroids and human growth hormone when questioned by a House commit­tee's investigators in August 2005. 
Tejada -the 2002 American League MVP with the Oakland Athletics and a five-time All-Star shortstop now with the Houston Astros -also acknowledged he bought HGH while playing for the A's, but said he threw the drugs away without using them. Prosecutors said they have no evidence to contradict that. 
Jets ended in disappointment as New York failed to make the playoffs. In an e-mail to ESPN, Favre said he had no regrets about finishing his career in New York and praised Tannenbaum, owner Woody Johnson and fired coach Eric Mangini. 
"My time with the Jets was short, but I'm honored to be given that chance," Favre wrote in the e-mail. 
If this is indeed it for Favre, he leaves the game with a slew of records, including career touchdown passes (464), completions (5,720), yards passing (65,127), regu­lar-season victories (169) and interceptions (310). 
"With Brett, there was always the possibility that he 
Beckham ties record for 
most match apperances 
EVILLE, Spain -David Beckham has equaled Bobby Moore's record for most appearances by an England player other than a goal­keeper. 
Beckham replaced Stewart Downing in the 46th minute of an exhibition game in Spain on Tuesday. That gave him 108 appearances for his country, second only to goalkeeper Peter Shilton's 125. 
The 33-year-old midfielder moved from the Los Angeles Galaxy to AC Milan on loan in January. He want­ed to stay in shape in hopes of win­ning a spot on the national team. 
The loan expires March 8 but Beckham hopes for a permanent transfer. He is looking to improve his chances of playing at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa if England qualifies. Major League Soccer set a Friday deadline for an agreement with A,C Milan. 
wouldn't play the second year," Johnson said. "We were hoping to get one good year out of Brett Favre. We picked him based on, in our opinion, his giving us the best chance to win last season. We were dis­appointed not to have made the Super Bowl, but we did some very good things with Brett." 
And the team doesn't expect Favre, acquired by New York last August after a bitter breakup with Green Bay, to change his mind. 
"He did not ask to be released," Tannenbaum said. "Everything he said was, he is done playing football. We have our plan according to that, and we're going to move for­ward." 
Armstrong's personal dru~ 
test plan falls througli 
DENVER -Lance Armstrong scrapped his much-publicized plan to set up an independent drug-test­ing program on Wednesday because of high costs and nearly impossible logistics. 
When Armstrong announced his comeback last year, the seven-time Tour de France winner said he wanted to prove he was clean, and was teaming with anti-doping expert Don Catlin, who would test him and post the results online. 
But Catlin told The Associated Press that after months of negotia­tions, both sides realized the pro­gram wasn't workable this year. 
"It was going to be difficult," Catlin said. "There were so many issues in trying to get this going ­legal issues, financial issues, and we sort of tried every which way. Finally, it made more sense to put it aside for the moment and maybe take it up at another time." 
Running back Thomas Jones and safety Kerry Rhodes were critical after the season of Favre and his per­formance. The Jets went from 8-3 to missing the playoffs. Favre threw nine interceptions as the Jets went 1-4 down the stretch, and a torn right biceps might have contributed. 
Still, Favre had nothing but positive things to say about his Jets experience. 
"Mike and Woody, as well as the entire organization, have been nothing short of out­standing," Favre said in thee­maiL "My teammates ­Thomas (Jones) and Kerry (Rhodes) included -were a pleasure to play with. Eric could not have been any bet­ter. I ellioyed playing for him."

used to seeing," Louisville coach Jeff Walz said. "She occupies so many people because she can score so quick. And she found a way to get to the free throw line and hits three big threes." 
To get to the charity stripe, McCoughtry heaved a despera­tion shot with one second remaining on the shot clock and was fouled by Irish point guard Melissa Lechlitner. 
Irish coach Muffet McGraw was unsure about whether a foul was the correct call. 
"I didn't [think it was a foul], but I'm sitting on the Notre Dame side [of the court]," McGraw said. "It thought it was all-ball. And it was kind of not really even a shot. She barely had control when she shot it, so I thought maybe we'd get lucky there and go get the rebound." 
But regardless of whether or not the foul was legitimate, McGraw said that was the most important moment of the game. 
"That was key, that put it to a two-possesion game," McGraw said. "That really hurt us." 
McCoughtry was a little more confident that the officials made the correct decision. 
"I just felt her swat down on me," she said. " ... I always feel like I am fouled." 
McCoughtry finished the game with 20 points and 11 rebounds, one of two Cardinals with double-doubles against Notre Dame. The other, for­ward Candyce Bingham, had 21 points and 12 rebounds. 
McGraw said she was disap­pointed that her team could not complete a comeback late in the game. 
"I thought we did some good things to get it close, and then we turned it over or we would just make a critical mistake at the wrong time." 
Even more important for the Louisville effort was McCoughtry's defense. The Cardinals forward was the leader of the Louisville press, and provided a constant force in the half-court defense, nab-

. "She's really athletic but you can't let it get to you, and I think she got a couple of easy steals today, too, because we weren't taking care of the ball," Irish guard Ashley Barlow said. 
McGraw said McCoughtry is one of best anticipators in the country in the passing lanes. 
"It's hard to prepare [for playing McCoughtry] because she's everywhere defensively and she plays the passing lane so well. We were trying not to throw it near her and we didn't execute that very well," McGraw said. 
Earlier in the second half the Irish had a chance to pull ahead of Louisville. Notre Dame fell behind by 10 points going into halftime, but a 13-4 run capped by a Barlow layup brought the score to 42-41 Louisville. Cardinals forward Keisha Hines responded 10 seconds later with a layup of her own, sparking a 13-0 run. The Irish did not score again until freshman guard Natalie Novosel made a layup with 
5:20 later. 
"There were a few turnovers and layups in there and that just hurt us. We just didn't han­dle the press well, missed some shots, they got some easy ones," McGraw said. "I thought they beat our zone inside a lot, which was disappointing." 
In the loss, the Irish had three players score in double figures: forward Becca Bruszewski (18). Natalie Novosel (17) and Barlow (16). 
Note: 
+When Irish guard Ashley Barlow sank a free throw with 3 7 seconds left to make the score 66-63, she had also just scored her l,OOOth career point at Notre Dame. 
"I think in the junior year, it's an outstanding accomplish­ment and Ashley has always been an incredibly hard-work­er," McGraw said. "She's always inside trying to help the team win in any way she can; she's unselfish. So it's a great accomplishment for her."

DURHAM, N.C. -Ty Lawson 
helped Tyler Hansbrough 
make it four in a row at 
Cameron Indoor Stadium, 
while keeping himself perfect 
against North Carolina's most 
despised rival. 

Lawson scored 21 of his 25 
points in the second half, and 
No. 3 North Carolina rallied 
past No. 6 Duke 101-87 on 
Wednesday night. 

Hansbrough scored 17 points -and hit another late 3-point­er -for the Tar Heels (22-2, 8-2). who became the first .team in nine seasons to hit 
triple digits against Duke. 

They came on strong down 
the stretch, using late runs of 
2 5-11 and 14-0 to first take the 
lead for good and then stretch 
it to 17. In the process, they 
snapped the Blue Devils' 14­
game home court winning 
streak while claiming first 
place in the Atlantic Coast 
Conference standings. 

Wayne Ellington and Danny 
Green added 15 points apiece. 
Green and Hansbrough joined 
former Wake Forest standouts 
Tim Duncan and Rusty LaRue 
as the only players to beat 
Mike Krzyzewski four straight 
times on the Cameron court 
that now bears his name. 

Kyle Singler scored 22 points 
and Jon Scheyer added 20 to 
lead Duke (20-4, 7 -3), which 
kept up with the uptempo Tar 
Heels for about 30 minutes 
before spiraling to its fifth loss 
in six meetings with its hated 
rival located 8 miles down 
Tobacco Road. 

Gerald Henderson finished 
with 17 points -but was just 
1-for 9 in the second half for 
the Blue Devils, and that's 
when they let this one get 
away. 

Duke led 56-48 in the early 
moments of the half before 
North Carolina took command, 
with Hansbrough hitting a 
short jumper with just under 
18 minutes remaining. That 
started the Lawson-led 25-11 
burst in which the efficient Tar 
Heels took the lead for good, 
coming away with points on 12 
of 15 trips downcourt. 

Then, Lawson gave North 
Carolina all the separation it 
needed a short while later, 
when he scored nine of the 12 
straight points reeled off by the 
Tar Heels. His three-point play 
with 3:42 remaining put them 
up 88-71. 

That came two possessions 
after Hansbrough pulled up 
over David McClure and 
knocked down a 3-pointer; 
three seasons ago, Hansbrough 
hit a 3 at Cameron that he still 
insists is his favorite shot. 

That put the Tar Heels well 
on their way to their first 100­
point performance in the rival­
ry since their thrilling double­
1995, and made them the first 
visiting team to win here since 
they did it last March. 

Nolan Smith added 11 points 
for Duke, which allowed 100 
points for the first time since a 
109-100 victory over Virginia 
in January 2000. 

But for a while, it looked like 
the Blue Devils might be the 
first team to 100. 

Duke shot 62 percent while 
coming on strong late during a 
first half that was rather mis­
erable for the Tar Heels' top 
three players. Hansbrough, 
Lawson and Ellington were a 
combined 3-for-12 from the 
field, and Hansbrough, saddled with two fouls, was benched for the final 4:11. 
Duke used a 22-5 run in which they hit 9-of-11 shots over a 5 1/2-minute span late in the first half -a run capped by Singler's baseline jumper with 4:55 remaining­to take a 40-34 lead. 
The Blue Devils held North Carolina to two field goals over the half's final 7 1/2 minutes, then pushed their lead to 50­41 on Scheyer's free throw with 46.4 seconds left -the first time the Tar Heels allowed a team to score 50 in a half since December. 
But that was well before they got back to the fast tempo that helped them take an early dou­ble-figure lead. North Carolina jumped out to a 20-10 lead roughly 5 1/2 minutes in after some remarkably efficient play in which it scored on 10 of 11 possessions. 
Connecticut 63, Syracuse 49 
STORRS, Conn. -Jim Calhoun and Jim Boeheim have both coached for more than three decades and the battles between their teams have created one of college basketball's top rivalries. 
The two were in total agree­ment after Calhoun's top­ranked Connecticut Huskies won their 12th straight game, 63-49 over Boeheim's 23rd­ranked Syracuse Orange on Wednesday night: Hasheem Thabeet is one of the best defensive big men to play in the Big East. 
The 7-foot-3 Thabeet had eight points, 16 rebounds and seven blocks and affected even more shots as the Huskies sent the Orange to their fifth loss in six games. 
"We're not the best offensive team in the league but we're a pretty good defensive team with Hasheem in the middle," Calhoun said. "He affected 20 penetrations in the lane. Don't get caught up in stats with him, even as good as they are, because he is one of the most amazing forces in basketball in America." 
Boeheim called Thabeet a "tremendous defensive player." 
''I've said it before and I still believe he's the best we've had in this league. We're an inside this season, Albion snapped the Belles' six-game confer­ence win streak, so Saint Mary's will be looking to reverse fortune this time around as the team still has a shot at first place in the con­ference.

Heels, Huskies beat rivals 
tea,m and takes that away from you." 
The Orange came in averag­ing 80 points per game, sec­ond-best in the league. 
"Holding them to 49, that was the most impressive thing to me," said A.J. Price, who had 17 points for the Huskies (23-1, 11-1 Big East), who have won three games since assuming the No. 1 spot in The Associated Press' poll last week 
They overcame a sloppy first half by cutting down the turnovers and hitting 3-point­ers, pulling away with a 12-0 run that gave Connecticut a 56-40 lead midway through the second half. 
The Huskies had to play almost the entire game without second-leading scorer Jerome Dyson who injured his knee just over 4 minutes in and did­n't return. 
~son banged knees with a Syracuse player as he fought through a screen with 15:44 to play in the first half and remained on the court for sev­eral minutes before being helped to the locker room by two teammates. Dyson, who averages 13.7 points, never returned to the game. School officials said he would be taken for an MRI and X-rays on Thursday but that there was no structural damage, just a severely bruised right knee. 
Jonny Flynn had 16 points for Syracuse (18-7, 6-6), which was ranked as high as No. 8 before the skid that may now see the Orange drap out of the national rankings. 
"We had some really good opportunities early and didn't take advantage of them," Boeheim said. "That first half we played as good as we are capable of defensively but we just couldn't do anything offen­sively and he had a lot to do with that." 
Connecticut managed to take a 30-27 halftime lead despite committing 14 turnovers ­two more than its season aver­age for a game -and going 2­for-8 from 3-point range. 
The Huskies had six turnovers in the second half and they hit three of their first attempts from 3-point range, the last of those by Craig Austrie during the big run.

Park leads Irish squad to twelfth-place finish 
Sophomore finishes in four-way tie for 20th 
By NATHANIEL LEE 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame finished 12th at the Northrop Grumman Regional in a field full of top-ranked teams in Palos Verdes, Calif. 
No. 3 Arizona State came into the day leading the field, and combined for a 15-over par total to hold on for the win. Sundevils golfer Juliana Murcia turned in yet another solid performance, shooting 2-over par to bring her total for the tournament to a l-over 214,· eight strokes ahead of second­place finisher Carlota Ciganda, also of Arizona State. 
After Wednesday's final round, the Irish came out in 12th place, with a .104-over par 956. Leading the Irish for the third day was sopho­more All-American So-Hyun Park, who finished in a four­way tie for 20th place. She turned in a final-round 6­over 77, finishing 20-over for the three rounds. 
Freshman Becca Huffer finished behind Park in a tie 
for 41st. Her 6-over per­formance was her best of the tournament and brought her stroke total to 237, 24­over par, 
Rounding out the squad were the solid performances from Junior Annie Brophy, senior captain Lisa Maunu and sophomore Katie Conway. Brophy shot a 1­over par for the day, the best performance by an Irish golfer at the tourna­ment, and finished tied for 44th place at 240 strokes. 
Maunu's 8-over final­round score of 79 brought her to a to taI of 2 4 7 , 3 4 strokes over par for all three rounds, causing her to drop seven places down to 65th in the field. Conway capped off the Irish with her own 8-over performance on the day. She finished in 73rd place, shooting 37-over par on a 250-stroke effort. 
The Irish will now have a long break before traveling to Baton Rouge, La., for the Cleveland/LSU Classic on March 13th.

Weighting it out 
Weeks before the opening bell sounds this Sunday, boxers began their fight to get in shape. This week is crunch time for the fighters working to cut weight and make their final preparations. Senior Matt Posluszny, above, knows the ropes after three years in the Bouts. He said his final week is about mentally preparing, but that didnJ keep him from bundling up to break a good sweat. Knott junior Adam Steinbach, below, will make his boxing debut Sunday night. Steinbach has been training since last May and has !ost over 30 pounds in the process. After two final days of pushing himself to the limit, he tipped the scales at 160 pounds Tuesday night, his lightest since junior high. -Photos by Ian Gavlick

Louisville picks up win at Joyce Center 
By JAY FITZPATRICK 
Sports Writer 
Despite giving up a 13-0 run, having two Louisville players register double-doubles, and shooting only 37.9 percent from the floor, No. 22 Notre Dame still had a chance to win at the end of Wednesday night's game. Angel McCoughtry made sure they didn't. 
The 6-foot-1 Louisville senior forward nailed three free throws with 1:16 remaining in the game to push the score to 66-61, which all but crushed any attempt at an Irish come­back. The No. 12 Cardinals went on to win 71-65.

House of Cards 

Team must toughen up in coming gan1es 
Louisville came into the Joyce Center looking to knock the Irish around, and well, can you blame them? Notre Dame hasn't exactly made a name for itself as one of the more physical teams in the Big East. 
Just take a look at the Irish roster and you'll see that jun­ior center Erica Williamson is the tallest they've got, measuring at 6-foot-4. And even just watching Notre Dame next to another team during the national anthem, you'd have to be blind

Hanson, Thang sidelined 
Coach Jackson says others must step up to ease pain of losses 
By SAM WERNER Sports Writer 
After a virtually injury-free season to date, the Irish saw two of their top forwards, Christian Hanson and Ryan Thang, go down in Friday's win over Ohio State. Thang is expected to miss four to six weeks with a high ankle sprain, while Hanson is week-to-week after suffering a slight concussion. 
While there is a chance that Hanson could play this weekend against Northern Michigan, the earliest Thang could see the ice again is the second round of the CCHA playoffs.

Hoopsters slam du~ Adrian on hotne floor 
By ROBERT GRAHAM 
Sports Writer 

After losing to Hope a week and a half ago, the Belles knew the only way they would have a shot at the conference title would be if they won all of their remaining five games. After a scrappy, hard-fought win against Adrian last night at the Angela Athletic Complex, Saint Mary's is more than halfway there in terms of accomplishing that goal. 
Saint Mary's (14-8, 12-2) pulled ahead early in the sec­ond half to defeat the visiting Bulldogs 77-71 after only being ahead 42-41 at half­time. 
The game was a change of pace for the Belles, who have been on both sides of blowouts in three of their last four games, the most recent of which was a 66-39 win against Alma. 
After leading by one at the half, Saint Mary's fell behind by five to Adrian until there were about 10 minutes remi­aning. After a 9-0 rally, the Belles jumped ahead 65-59 and lead the rest of the way. 
The win extended the school record for most MIAA confer­ence wins in a season to 12 and the team's 14 wins over­all are the most since 1993. 
Senior forward Erin Newsom recorded her sixth double-double of the season, scoring 22 points and grab­bing 11 rebounds. Freshman guard Patsy Mahoney also contributed 22 points and freshman forward Kelley Murphy contributed 14 points to the winning effort.
