IN BRIEF 
Cat Stevens songs have been banned by an Indianapolis radio station because of the former pop singer's support of Ayatollah Khomeini's condemnation of "The Satanic Verses." The radio station WXTZ-FM made the announce­ment Monday. Stevens, who now lives in London under the name Yussef Islam, said he supported Khomeini's call for the death of author Salman"'Rushdie. "If someone defames the Prophet, he must die," said Stevens. "WXTZ does not believe it's appropriate to support in any way this type of international terrorism, nor do we believe in the advocating of murder in any way, much less in a manner than imperils freedom of expression,'' said Randy Harrison, operations manager for the easy listening sta­tion. -Associated Press ap-na-02-28-89 1449est

February: A time to complain, but not to act 
February must be that time of the year. That time when everyone has nothing better to do with their time in sunny South Bend but complain, whine, and moan about anything that suits their fancy. 
It seems as though February at Notre Dame brings out the worst in people. It's true that compared to the football season there is nothing to do on weekends and that this is compounded by the infamous lake-effect weather but February isn't all that bad. Is it? 
We've complained about Sports Illustrated's sexist swimsuit issue, the lousy food in the dining hall, the closing of the 24-hour Oak Room, JPW weekend, hell, we've even complained about the complaints (this column included). 
I don't know why February effects everyone so. Maybe it is the shortness of the month, maybe it is the weather, or maybe it's a let down after the football season. Who can say for sure? 
For whatever reason it is strange that of all the months of the year, we pick February to complain in. It is almost like national complaining month. 
The interesting thing about all of the whining we as students have been doing for the past 28 days is that in the midst of this onslaught of complaints there has also been a considerable amount of apathy. (Here comes my complaint). 
Most everyone on campus thinks Notre Dame is one of the most apathetic places on earth. We complain about this constantly. 
They all want someone else to take the initative and change the attitudes around campus. "Notre Dame stinks, I wish there was something to do on weekends," is just one 

example of this attitude. 

Don't get me wrong. There are some students who make an effort to make a difference, but the majority of students are like a friend who lives next to me in the dorm. This friend is constantly telling me that The Observer should do this, that and the other thing to fix things around campus. "Someone really should write about this teacher's lousy teaching," he'll tell me. 
To some extent he's right, The Observer is hardly exempt, but he is really just trying to get someone else to do his work for him. He doesn't want to make an effort to write a letter to the editor himself. He wants someone else to do it. 
Regretfully this friend is not alone. Student government, in an effort to assist students with class selection, distributed course evaluation questionaires to all the students on campus. About 400 students responded. 
Students complain about classes, but when someone makes an effort to help, they decide not to assist in the process. 
I am not sure why so few responded, but I'd say a large

number of the respondents figured it wasn't worth their time. "Enough people will fill them out, they don't need mine," seems to be the pervasive attitude. 
How wrong all these people are. Your response does make a difference. Take for example the student body election. Only 3, 711 students voted in Monday's election. If only II more people had voted for Matt Breslin there would have been no need for a run-off. In this instance every seemingly insignificant vote would probably have made a difference in the final outcome. 
Where does all of this leave us on the first day of a brand new month? Well, we have managed to voice a lot of complaints and get some dialogue this past month, but we have also complained about things without presenting an alternative we are willing to follow through on. Getting people to want to change something is a lot easier than actually getting them to change it. 
Since February was the month of bitching and apathy, let's try to make March the month of acting and suggesting ways to change the system. 
March is coming in like a lion, and hopefully will go out like a lamb.

Garzia upgraded to good condition 
Observer Staff Report 
Saint Mary's Junior Ursula Garzia has been upgraded to good condition Tuesday after­noon, following a car accident in which she was injured early Saturday morning. 
Junior Michael Stonebreaker, who was the driver of the car involved in the one-car accident, remained in fair condition late Tuesday, said a Memorial Hospital spokesperson. 
Stonebreaker and Garzia were injured when Stonebreaker's car ran off the road on U.S. 31133 and struck a sign pole. Tests after the acci­dent showed Stonebreaker had a blood-alcohol level of .157 per­cent. Indiana's legal intoxica­tion level is .10 percent. 
No decision has been made regarding punishment of Stonebreaker, said Associate Sports Information Director John Heisler. Heisler said Head Coach Lou Holtz had returned to campus late Tuesday after­noon and has not had a chance to either review the accident

"Our only concern at this point is for their health," Heis­ler said. It would be several days at least before any type of decision regarding punish­ment would be made, Heisler said. 
Heisler said that all Univer­sity policies regarding alcohol abuse would be upheld. He said any further action would be up to Holtz. 
University policy requires evaluation and counseling of students who abuse alcohol and the possible loss of campus driving privileges for alcohol­related driving offenses, said Denny Moore, assistant direc­tor of public relations and in­formation. 
In an unrelated case, Heisler said that disciplinary action taken against Sophomore tail­back Tony Brooks barring him from extracurricular activities was a decision made outside the athletic department. Heis­ler would not speculate on the reason behind the suspension.

Democratic Socialist speaks on poverty in U.S. from 50s to 80s 
By DANNIKA SIMPSON News Staff 
Michael Harrington, national co-chairperson of the Demo­cratic Socialists of America, examined poverty in America 
from the  1950's  through  the  
1980's  in  a  lecture  Tuesday  
night.  

Harrington said that Lyndon Johnson's "unconditional war on poverty" in 1964 was under­emphasized because of the Vietnam War. He did praise Johnson for "cutting poverty of the aging in half" by establish­ing Medicare and covering the eldery under Social Security. He also praised the Johnson ad­ministration for establishing

job training and legal services for the poor. 
Harrington said that poverty was an "integrated problem" in the 1950s and 60s, which af­fected blacks, whites and Hispanics. He also stated that before Johnson many of the el­derly were poor because of lack of benefits to help them with their health and day-to-day living. 
Harrington stated that, in contrast, the "new poor are overwhelming the working poor." Many people who work have low paying "poverty part­time jobs without any kind of medical coverge." · Many P®ple have to take these part-

time jobs after being laid off 
from previous jobs, he said, 
and they are therefore "sliding 
down the social ladder." 
Harrington compared the 
U:S. system to Japan's, where, "executives go to the same bathroom as employees" and workers "have lifetime guaranteed employment." He said that the U.S. should incor­porate some aspects of the Ja­panese system into its own in order to make it more economi­cally just. 
Harrington said he thinks that we "can't have a war on poverty because the majority of Americans are not affluent.'' He thinks that in order to solve the poverty problem we must "link the struggle against povertry in the U.S. to the struggle against poverty in the world" because it would be wrong to have an America that was just in an unjust world. 
Harrington's lecture, which was held at the library auditorium, was sponsored by the Kellogg Institute for Inter­national Studies, the Govern­ment departmemt, and student government.

the basis of unfounded rumor. I've known John Tower a long time, longer than many that are criticizing him out there in various walks of life." 
Bush said he thought that Americans had "an innate sense of fair play" about such matters and said he did not think that Tower should be judged on the basis of percep­tions about his character. 
"So, if somebody has a spe­cific objection, fine," he said. "They have a right to state it."

Registrar handles many duties 
By KELLEY TUTHILL Staff Reporter 
Registering all University 
students for next semester isn't 
the Registrar's only headache-­
the office also allots clas­
srooms, compiles the informa­
tion in the course schedule 
booklet and sets the final exam 
schedule. 
First preference for clas­srooms is awarded to the de­partment whose building the room is in, said Daniel Winicur, dean of administration and registrar. "For example, a chemistry or physics class would have first preference for a room in Nieuwland," said Winicur.­
"Then we look at the history. If one faculty member has taught in the room for years, we take that into account," said Winicur. However, if the room size and the type of room does not suit the class, it is unlikely that the professor would keep the room, said Winicur. 
The particular departments who sponsor the class decide the maximum and minimum number of students, said Winicur. "We assign clas­srooms based on the maximum number of students." 
Mter registration, the Office of the Registrar has a better idea of class size, said Winicur. At this time there is a readjust­ment of classrooms. Another adjustment occurs at the end of the summer when freshmen and graduate class sizes are available, said Winicur. Clas­srooms are also adjusted fur­ther at addtlrop week. 
The faculty has a fair amount of say on the classrooms that they are assigned, especially if a particular type of room is needed to teach a certain class, said Winicur. If a class has three or fewer students the classroom will be taken away, if the space is needed, said Winicur. 

Last semester, for the first time that Winicur can remem­ber, there were more classes scheduled at a given time than classrooms available. He said the busiest times are Mon.tWedHri., 10:00 a.m. and 
11:00 a.m. and Tues.tThurs. at 9:30a.m. and 11:00 a.m. When a "classroom crunch" such as this occurs, the Registrar will go to a department that has several classes scheduled at that time and ask them to move some classes around, accor­ding to Winicur. 
"Some departments like math and engineering histori­cally get together to work out conflicts," said Winicur. Once the preliminary course infor­mation is back from the depart­ments, it is entered into a com­puter, said Winicur. The course information is sent back to the departments for review before the actual course selection booklet is printed, said Winicur. 
The departments offering the course also decide if a class is going to be registration by per­mission only, said Winicur. Ho~~ver, the departments are asked to meet the guidelines set up by the Office of the Registrar. "We ask for jus­tification of why a particular class needs to be 'check­marked,' " said Winicur. 
"We want to make sure that all students have access to classes," said Winicur. He added that the University is trying to cut back on the num­ber of "checkmarked" classes. 
For example, a music clas~ that required an audition would have to be registration by per­mission only, said Winicur. 
There are several reasons why the course schedule book­let may not specify a professor, said Winicur. The department may not have hired someone yet and consequently are un­able to list a professor's name. The second possibility is that

tne department has yet to 
decide on a professor, said 
Winicur. 
This spring's exam schedule was made up in the fall semes­ter of 1988, said Winicur. The schedule is based upon the exam schedule from the year before, said Winicur. For ex­ample, this spring's schedule depends on when last spring's exams were held. 
"We move the exam that was held on Friday last year to the first day this year," said Winicur. Every other exam is moved up accordingly. 
The schedule is sent to the assistant and associate deans of each college, said Winciur. The deans look over the schedule and problems are dis­cussed at a later meeting, said Winicur. 
"At the meeting, the schedule is amended and if there are conflicts, we clear them up. But when one dean makes a change it affects an­other," said Winicur. The schedule is also coordinated with Saint Mary's College, said Winicur. 
The fall exam schedule is set up in the early summer, said Winicur. The courses offered must be known prior to scheduling exams, he said. En­rollment numbers are also im­portant because there are few large classrooms that must be saved for large classes' exams, said Winicur. 
This spring registration will begin on April20 and the course selection booklet should be available after March 30, said Winicur.

By MAURA KRAUSE Staff Reporter 
Constitutional amendments were unanimously approved for the Student Union Board by the Hall Presidents' Council last night, and activities for Spring Break and St. Patrick's Day were also discussed. 
The changes, approved first by the student senate, con­cerned tha addition of a new article, creating a council com­posed of the student body pres­ident, the SUB manager, and the HPC chairperson. The changes will go into effect im­mediately. 
In other news, Rich Daly, as­sistant director of alumni clubs, spoke to the council about the Alumni Association's spring break support program. Each year, the Alumni Associ­ation travels to the school­sponsored break location. This year, the association will travel to South Padre Island. 
The association will provide free long distance phone calls, orange juice, Coke products and morning newspapers to students on break in the area. There will also be an incoming phone number for emer­gencies. However, "the Alumni Association will not be acting in loco parentis," said Daly. Students should bring a N.D;SMC I.D., said Daly.

Following a campaign that many observers found tame by Chicago's raucous standards, turnout in the primary election was lower than expected, and black turnout was running about 10 percentage points behind white turnout, the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners said. 
That allowed Daley to build up overwhelming margins on the predominantly white Southwest and Northeast sides. Sawyer was unable to overcome them with weakened

At the same time, the elections board said the number of Republican ballots cast totaled about 25,000-­some 50 percent more than in the previous election. 
Usually, a victory in a Chicago Democratic primary is enough to ensure victory in the general election. 
But this year could be different. The GOP primary took on unusual interest in the past week when former Democratic Alderman Edward Vrdolyak announced a last-minute write-in campaign against endorsed GOP candidate Herbert Sohn.

Indiana House approves 'beer baron bill' 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS-The In­diana House approved the con­troversial "beer baron bill" Tuesday as opponents tried to rally beer drinkers to fight the measure. 
Lawmakers voted 60-40 for House Bill 2055, which would permit breweries to establish exclusive territories for the dis­tribution of beer. The proposal would repeal a 10-year-old Al­coholic Beverage Commission rule banning exclusive beer territories. 
H.B. 2055 now goes to the Sen­ate, where opponents hope to defeat it. 
Grant Monahan, president of the Indiana Retail Council, said his group probably will keep up an advertising campaign aimed at getting beer drinkers to call their lawmakers. 
"If this bill had come down on Wednesday or Thursday, and the public had had a chance to have input, I think the vote would have been dif­ferent," said Monahan. 
A group of retailers took out a full-page advertisement in The Indianapolis Star on Tues­day to argue against the bill, claiming it will boost beer prices substantially. 
Rep. Marc Carmichael, D­Muncie, denied his bill would do that. He argued that "in the long run, it will allow beer prices to go down." 
Carmichael claimed the ABC rule "literally turned an indus­try upside down." He charged the rule was a deliberate at­tempt to shift sales of beer from one group of distributors to another. 
The ABC rule has forced many local, family-owned dis­tributorships out of business, said Carmichael, who left his job with a South Bend dis­tributor after the rule was ap­proved. If left unchecked, the rule could lead to creation of a few large distributorships that would control many brands of beer, he said. 
Indiana now has about 80 dis­tributors, compared with more than 200 when the ABC rule took effect, said Carmichael.

English-speakers lose Quebec's lingual battle 
Associated Press 
MONTREAL-It appeared the French and English lan­guages could live together in Quebec after separatist fervor abated nearly a decade ago, but the struggle resumed in December and French appears to have won. 
New issues arise constantly, such as whether the inside of a bus is really outside for sign purposes, and the answer al­most every time is that the signs must be only in French. The English-speaking minority, although dis­gruntled, appears to accept that the fight is lost. 
"Resigned is probably the right catchword," said Donald Taylor, a psychology professor at McGill University. 
Language is "a symbol of identity and it also is a resource that has associated power, and status, and success and access:' he said. "So these ap­parently minor events evoke ·:ery primary feelings.'' 
Quebec was a battleground of culture and language in the 1970s between the 81 percent with French heritage and a minority with a cultural kin­ship to Ontario and the other English-speaking provinces. 
Power shifted to the French­speaking majority in those years but the separatist tide ebbed after 1980, and with it the dispute over language, when Quebec voters rejected a sovereignty referendum. 
Then came a ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada in December that a 1977 Quebec law requiring all signs to be in French was unconstitutional. The court said French could be required to predominate on all signs but other languages could not be prohibited. 
The provincial government, which has broader powers than state governments in the United States, overrode the decision with new legislation for the language on signs. 
Bill 178, as it is known, re­quires that all outdoor signs still be solely in French, but for the first time since 1977 allowed bilingual indoor signs.

"The surge in consumption pulled in more fmports witn the result that the deterioration in the trade deficit was worse than previously assumed," said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National As­sociation of Manufacturers. 
It marked the second con­secutive quarter that the GNP trade deficit worsened and served to emphasize economists' contention that America's trade woes are a long way from being solved. 
The fourth quarter figure was depressed by the lingering effects of last summer's drought. Without the drought effects, the economy would have expanded at a 3.1 percent rate.

Soviet magazine says gov't told ·'political lies' 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW-A prominent state-run magazine has scath­ingly criticized the Communist Party, accusing it of spreading "political lies" that have deceived the Soviet people for generations. 
The unprecedented attack in the literary monthly Novy Mir also questioned the rationale of the 20 million-member party's legal monopoly on power, enshrined by the 1977 Constitu­tion, and says genuine democracy is impossible until the party permits open dissent in its ranks. 
Even in the franker atmo­sphere fostered by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's cam­paign for "glasnost," or greater openness, such harsh criticism of Communist Party practices in an official Soviet publication would have recently seemed impossible. 
The article, by widely known sociologist Igor M. Klyamkin, also hints at the central paradox of Gorbachev's blueprint for political change, by noting that Soviet "democratization" is taking place in a system where one party has declared itself soci­ety's sole legitimate ruler. 
The criticism comes at a time when Soviets are prepar­ing for their first national mul­ticandiate elections.

Economists expect recession by end of 1990 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The eco­nomy will slow substantially in 1989 with rising inflation and higher interest rates likely to topple the country into a reces­sion before the end of next year, the nation's top business economists predicted Monday. 
The National Association of Business Economists said a survey of its members found them slightly more optimistic about growth prospects for this year than they were three months ago. 
But by lopsided numbers, the economists were still predict­ing that the most likely date for the start of the next recession was 1990. 
Three out of four of the economists surveyed expected a new recession sometime in the next two years. However, the number predicting a downturn in 1989 dropped from 40 percent to 19 percent in the latest survey. 
Jay Woodworth, president of the association, said that economists were more optimis­tic about 1989 in part because of signs that auto sales, retail spending and housing construc­tion were holding up even with the increase in interest rates. 
"The business economists feel that this expansion is not at the end of its string yet. We probably have another year or so to go," Woodworth, senior domestic economist at Bankers Trust Co. of New York, said at a news briefing. 
The new survey was taken before the latest round of credit-tightening on the part of the Federal Reserve Board. Last Friday, the Fed boosted its discount rate, the interest it charges to make loans to fin­ancial institutions, to 7 percent. A hike in the discount rate is the most dramatic signal the central bank can send of its in­tentions to push interest rates higher to dampen an over­heated economy. 
The business economists ex­pressed strong support for the Fed's inflation-fighting battle, 

Small firms can profit by better college relations 
Special to The Observer 
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.-Can small, high­technology firms benefit from improved relation­ships with colleges and uni­versities? 
Apreliminary study of 200 high-growth firms says "yes, .. but the study indi­cates that universities and industry need to clarify their needs and expectations. 
The study was conducted by two Purdue University researchers to gather data on how small firms develop and maintain relationships with colleges and univer­sities. The study was de­signed to gather data prior to a more comprehensive in­vestigation. 
In general, executives feel that universities need to be more practical in their re­

to the needs of industry, says Greg Legan, assistant to the head of Purdue's Depart­ment of Computer Science and co-researcher for the study. 
While executives place high priority on better relationships, they demon­strate little willingness to in­vest in developing those relationships, says Legan. 
"Only eight of the res­
ponding firms have a full­
time university relations co­
ordinator, although 58 
percent of the respondents 
have an employee with that 
as a part-time responsibil­
ity," he says. 
''Our research.and obser­vations suggest thatJhe col­lege relations position in most small companies is a low-priority position with ex- tremely high turnover.'' 

with 70 percent expecting the board to boost interest rates further in the next six months. Woodward said the inflation­
ary pressures, if they do not 
start receding, would likely 
take their toll on the expansion, 
which has already lasted a 
peacetime record of six years. 
"Inflation rates of 5 percent to 5.25 percent are too high to be consistent with long-term growth and over time they would send the economy into a recession," he said. 
The median forecast for growth this year, as measured by the gross national product, was 2.7 percent, up slightly from a 2.5 percent estimate made by the business economists three months ago. The economy grew at a four­year high of 3.8 percent last year. 
The Bush administration has based its first budget on an es­timate that the economy will slow only modestly in 1989 to a growth rate of 3.2 percent, but this estimate is about one-half percentage point higher than

Nicaragua hit by hyperinflation 
Associated Press 

MANAGUA, Nicaragua-The young businesswoman looked tense and worried when the morning papers brought the news of the cordoba's fifth devaluation this year. 
The government's latest devaluation of the national cur­rency meant only one thing: higher prices for food and transport; higher costs for doing business; yet another round of belt-tightening. 
"If we ate meat three times a week, now we'll eat it once a week and so on until we become vegetarians," the woman said, toying with the pencil at her desk. "But even vegetables are expensive--when you can find them." 
The woman and her husband are urban professionals in their early 30s with a small business. They are expecting their third child. 
In private conversations, the two spoke of the hardships the middle class is enduring as a result of Nicaragua's economic crisis and the thought that crosses so many people's minds: pack up and leave for the United States, where many have relatives and friends. 
The devaluation of the cor­doba is part of the govern­ment's efforts to halt hyper­inflation. 
To control runaway inflation that reached 20,000 percent in 1988 and 97 percent in January alone, the government is firing more than 30,000 workers, slashing public spending and tightly restricting credit. 
"You keep cutting back and cutting back (on the household budget), but now I'm wonder­ing what else I can eliminate," the woman added. 
"And if that's us and people like us," she said, leaning for­ward to emphasize her point, "can you imagine what poor people are going through?" 
Poor and middle-class people are leaving the country in droves, undeterred even by a get-tough U.S. immigration policy that took effect last Tuesday. 
Despite a tripling of the price for a new passport, Nicaraguarans still flock to im­migration offices. 
At the new rate, a typical monthly salary of 200,000 cor­dobas is worth $52. Many professionals earn up to 500,000 cordobas a month, which trans­lates to only $131. A new pas­sport costs 150,000 cordobas. 
A senior Western diplomat said figures compiled from various sources indicate that from 1979--when the leftist San­dinistas came to power-­through 1987, Nicaraguara lost about 8,500 professionals. 
The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said about 2,000 professionals and business people left the country in 1988 alone--despite the sig­ning of a preliminary peace ac­cord in March. · 

Employee stock ownership plans not always a good deal 
By LOUIS RUYKEYSER Business Writer 
You're an ordinary working stiff in a big corporation. Sud­denly your mean old boss starts talking as if we were the rich Uncle Harry you always wished you had. Out of the goodness of his heart, he tells you, he's going to give you and the rest of the labor force a piece of the action. 
How good a deal is this real­ly? And is it just possible that somebody along the way is get­ting snookered? 
Could be--even though there's a growing trend among major corporations to adopt ESOPs (employee stock ownership plans) that give their employees a stake in the business. Companies like Texaco, Proctor & Gamble, Polaroid, J.C. Penny, Avis, and Hospital Corporation of America have gone this route, swelling the number of ESOP plans to an estimated 8,000. 

ESOPs have always been a sort of tax dodge. Low-interest loans are made by an outside lender to a trust set up for a company's employees. The trust buys shares in the com­pany. The company gets the money. But unliuke other forms of borrowing, the com­pany's cash contributions to the ESOP (with which these loans are actually repaid) are fully deductible, principle as well as interest. 
The leading evangelist for ESOPs is San  Francisco lawyer Louis Kelso, who made a major convert in 1973 of Sen. Russel Long, then chairman of the Senate Finance Commit­tee. Highly favorable law was written. The idea was that it would help privately owned companies whose owners wanted to retire, and would give workers the opportunity to become capitalists, even on a small scale. 

From the start, there were serious questions about using the tax code for this purpose. Cr1tics ranged across the eco­nomic spectrum from Milton Friedman to Paul Samuelson, who denounced the plan as a loophole. 
But perhaps the most serious reservation was that ESOPs were making an implied prom­ise on which they might not be able to deliver. ESOPs look like retirement plans and have been launched mostly through the federal penion laws. Congress, however, exempted ESOPs from key pension safeguards that could spell dis­
aster for a floundering compa­ny. 
In other words, instead of a pension plan based on sensible diversification, workers, might be putting all their eggs in the same basket from which they pluck their paychecks. If the basket collapses, as companies are known to do, look out! 
Indeed, when I pressed Kelso on this once, he acknowledged that he would not recommend ESOPs for "companies that are unsuccessful, companies 
that are unprofitable," adding frankly: "It's no substitute for good management." 
Now, to these traditional con­cerns about ESOPs, comes a new one. Within the last year or two, many large firms have jumped on the ESOP band­wagon as a financing vehicle to make leveraged buyouts, prevent hostile takeovers, rid themselves of unprofitable divisions, or just reap rewards by selling out at astronomical prices to the firms' employees while giving them only a pas­sive role in managment. 
Joseph Blasi, management professor and author of the recent book "Employee Ownership: Revolution or Ripoff?" put it to me bluntly: "All too often. . . employee ownership is abused by managers who exploit it for their own purposes." 
At its best, employee owner­ship can provide financial se­curity and job protection. But workers offered such a plan should remember the oldest rule in investing: caveat emptor. Otherwise, they may find themselves in the goats ... in an ESOPs fable.

The new modern version of Heaven 
Editor's note: The following fictional article is a satirical account which represents the author's personal views. 
Some time ago I had a very interest­ing experience during one of my late­night visits to the Grotto. No sooner did I reach for my rosary beads than Our Lady, in person, appeared to me, saying "I've been meaning to ask you a favor, Glenn. There have been some pretty strange things happening in Heaven lately, and I'd like you to take a look around. It seems that some nit­wits have staged a coup, and are trying to destroy my son's Church. I'll give you an assumed identity." As soon as I replied "Sure thing, old girl," I im­mediately found myself standing on a platform of clouds, underneath an arch with the inscription 'The Pearly Gate.' 
Glenn Fogarty 
with no apologies 

A bespectacled man in a three-piece suit soon approached me, just as I was remarking, "So, this must be Heaven." The man replied: 
"Well, we liberal theologians are still debating whether this place actually exists or not. When we decide that it does exist, then it will. Not a moment sooner.'' 
"Who are you?" I asked. 
"Oh, forgive me," he replied. "I'm Fr. Charles Current. I'll be your guide to Heaven. You must be Mr. Fogarty, the rep from the Church of Atheism. Atheism is such a grand faith. We liberal theologians have been toying with the idea of incorporating it into our Catholic theology, you know. We must be ecumenical! " 
"Well, uh..." 
"Let me show you around. You'lllike our new setup. You've heard the saying 'All roads lead to Rome'? Well, we've completely rerouted Heaven's highway system. Now all roads lead away from Rome! Aren't we clever?" 
Riding in a cloud-car with Fr. Cur­rent down Karl Rahner Boulevard, the main drag, I was able to peruse many of Heaven's new features. One could see shopping malls, teeming with won­derful stores like "Ray Hunthausen's Annul-mart, $1.98 Annulment Spe­cials!," "Andrew Greeley's Adult Bookshop," and "Liturgies R Us." There was even a multiplex cinema showing round-the-clock screenings of 'The Last Temptation of Christ' in every theatre, with free commentary from eminent theologians after each show. Fr. Current turned to me and said: 
"Isn't it just wonderful? I bet you never thought Heaven was as good as this. No more 'New Jerusalem' stuff. There's my favorite store over there! It's called 'The Religious Super­market.' You can buy any doctrine or heresy you want there, provided that it isn't approved by the Vatican.'' 
"Can I even buy voodoo or paganism, and incorporate it into liberal theol­ogy?" 
"Oh, sure. I do that all the time. Their Shinto is especially tasty. I make my favorite dishes with the 'Shake &Bake' Religion mix. Just put the ingredients you want in a bag, shake, put it in the oven, and you have your own gourmet heresy! Last night I used some Manic­haeism, some Gnosticism, and just plain old Hedonism, mixed it with Ar­rogance and a dash of paprika, and voila! Charles Current Casserole!" 
Wondering where all the 'big' people in Heaven were, I began to ask Current a few questions: 
"Ah, Fr. Current, where's this Jesus fellow?" 
"Well, he's under guard in our new Schillebeeckx Prison. Would you believe that he actually denied that that fine film was about him? Or that he wasn't actually a woman? He even sup­ports 'Humanae Vitae! I suspect the guy's a Vatican agent.'' 

"Mary?" 

"Same place. Annoying woman. Al­ways trying to steal the glory from us theologians. By the way, I highly doubt that she was a virgin.'' 
"St. Paul?" 

"That fascist, sexist pig? We locked him up long ago. He and that Jesus char­acter just don't belong in the twentieth century. They both oppose women's or­dination, too.'' 
"St. Michael the Archangel?" 
"A warmonger! A foe of peace and justice! We burned him at the stake last week. No use for intolerant people like him in our new heaven.'' 
Soon thereafter, Current stopped the cloud-car, saying, "Well, we're here!" 
"Where?" 

"Why, Red Square, downtown Managua! In honor of our favorite Mar­xist slave pen, of course. Liberation theology, you know. We're going to erect statues of the New Holy Trinity in the center of the square this week! Marx, Lenin, and Daniel Berrigan. Has a nice theological ring to it, don't you think?" 
Suddenly a loudspeaker started blaring the message: 
"Silence. This is Big Doubter speak­ing. Today you shall think the thought 'You can be too loyal to the Pope. You can be to emphatic about the divinity of Christ.'" 
"Words of Wisdom," Current said. "Over there's our new Buddhist Temple, the centerpiece of our neW\ Heaven. Ecumenism, you know. We have a Catholic chapel over here, for decorative purposes. We only play one hymn, 'Non Serviam.'" 
"So I see. What does God have to say about all this?" 
"God? We're not on speaking terms with Him. If we got involved with God, it would send a chilling effect over all theological innovation.'' 
"What a pity.'' 

"Would you believe that He actually had th~ .. l:l.!IQl:lCity to ~ay t_~t 'He wa!i being patient with us, but that He would be forced to discipline us soon'? Dis­cipline the Third Magisterum? Never! I suspected He was a Vatican stooge all along.'' 
"Well, can I speak to Him?" 
"No, but you can speak to the person we've appointed to be 'God' in His stead: Hans Kung, Kung of Kings, Lord of Liberal Theology. There he is, sitting on his high pedestal now!" 
I crossed Red Square to the pedestal and asked, "What in the world are you doing up there, Herr Kung?" 
He replied, "Ah, sir, I walk upon the air and look down on the Vatican from a superior standpoint." 
I answered, "Well, I suppose it's bet­ter that you sneer at the Pope from a pedestal in the air than do it from the ground.'' 
Precisely. Only by dangling my mind in the heavens and mingling my rare thought with ethereal air could I ever achieve strict theological arrogance." 
I replied, "Well, that's all very nice," and turning to Fr. Current said, "I think I've had my fill of the new Heaven.'' 
"Aren't you going to stay for our Woodstock Hedonistic Lovefest? It'll be just like the 60's! Free abortions, too. Abortion isn't a black and white issue, you know.. .'' 
"I think I'll take my leave. Mary, if you'll do the honors?" Suddenly I found myself back at the Grotto. Was I ever glad to be back at Notre Dame, a real Catholic place. Walking across campus, however, I noticed an an­nouncement proclaiming "This week! Bus trips to see 'The Last Temptation of Christ'.'' Well, maybe not so Catholic after all.

Asst. Treasurer's job now open 
Dear Editor: 
Each year we see and hear about the many activities offered by the student organizations on campus. However, most of us do not realize that our $55 student activity fee provides the fun­ding for these various groups and the activities they sponsor. In fact, close to $400,000 is collected from the student activity fee and the student body trea­surer is responsible for budgeting this sum to the many organizations which rely on it for their operations. These include: student government, SUB, the class governments, each dorm and the Hall Presidents' Council, the Judicial and Off-Campus Councils, and over 120 other clubs and organizations on campus. 
Once the budgeting process has been completed in April of each year, the student body treasurer is responsible for maintaining an accurate record of all finances and dispersing the all­ocated funds to the organizations men­tioned above. The student body trea­surer serves on the Student Senate, the Student Union Board Steering Commit­tee (the monitoring board for SUB), the Student Business Board (the monitor­ing board for the student-run busi­nesses in LaFortune as well as Ad­works), and as chairman of the Student Senate Budget and Finace Committee, where it is the treasurer's duty to see that each eligible organization on campus receives funding for the follow­ing year. 
If you are interested in sharing some of this responsibility, student govern­ment needs you. Each year in March, interviews are held to select someone to serve as the assistant student body 

treasurer. Applicants must be sop­homores in the College of Business Ad­ministration.~During the chosen appli­cant's junior year, he or she will serve as the assistant treasurer in a learning capacity to become familiar with the financial operations of student govern­ment. Then, on April 1, 1990, he or she will assume the role of student body treasurer. Thus, the person chosen will have the opportunity to serve under two different student government ad­ministrations. 
As the current assistant student body treasurer, I would encourage anyone eligible to apply for the position. This past year has been both challenging and rewarding in helping me prepare for the future. Through this job, I have been able to gain practical experience and help make important decisions. In many ways, this job has been compa­rable to a summer internship. I have gained a greater understanding of busi­ness, leadership qualities, and experi­ence in dealing with people in general. I am looking forward to sharing my experience with the new assistant trea­surer next year. 
Applications for the assistant student body treasurer's position may be ob­tained in the Treasurer's Office on the second floor of LaFortune, between 12 and 4 p.m. this week. All applications are due this Thursday at 4 p.m., and interviews will be held after spring break. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to stop by or call the Treasurer's Office, or to pursue this interest. The position of assistant stu­dent body treasurer provides a great learning experience, one which can only be built upon in the future.

The power of the poor 
Editor's note: The author ofthis article participated in an Urban Plunge at St. Josaphat Church in Chicago from Jan. 11-13. 
One of the main issues that arose on my first night of the Urban Plunge as Fr. Grassi led us around his parish neighborhood was that being poor means more than a lack of material goods. It also means a lack of political strength, so that the poor often feel helpless about changing or controlling their situation. I learned that in this atmosphere, the Church becomes a 
John Halpin 
guest column 
trusted friend, the only resort a person may have in asking for help. Fr. Grassi explained that although the Church also has limited power, it can serve as a voice for the poor, and work to organize them so that they can increase their own power and begin to feel more of a sense of control over their destiny. 
The very next day this point became a vivid reality when we visited the parish of St. Agatha and their ever­optimistic and energetic priest, Fr. Mike Ivers. Fr. Ivers gave each of us an individual tour of his area, and as he was walking around with Jim Mer­curio, they came across a lady who had just then been evicted from her house. Apparently there was a dispute over ownership of the house and the pay­ment of property taxes. This is a legal problem that Fr. Ivers could not deal with himself, so he decided to help this lady by calling a lawyer he knew. Fur­thermore, it just so happened that a reporter for the Chigago Tribune was also on the tour. He asked the lady if she would like press coverage of what had happened to her. If the lawyers could not help her, possibly the power of public opinion could. 
The situation was really a very strik­ing one. Here was a woman standing in front of the home she had woken up in that morning, and now there was a group of men putting boards over all 

the windows and the door of that house. 
The sensation I felt as I watched this 
scene was one of corruption--a corrup­
tion of those in control of this situation. There seemed to be a total disregard for this woman's rights and welfare. I wondered to myself who this woman would have turned to if Fr. Ivers was not available to her, or if she lived in an area where the Church was very pas­sive. 
Of course, I do not really know the complete circumstances of why she was being evicted, and it is possible that there is a good and legitimate rea­son why she should not be allowed to live there. However, even if this is so, the lack of respect shown for this lady is inexcusable no matter what the cir­cumstances. The attitude displayed towards her I think, may reflect a gen­eral overall attitude that landlords and the Chicago government take toward the poor. I found it very interesting to learn how important the Church can be 
also said he would like to see his lead­ership role in the community taken over by members of the community it­self. He stressed that one must not take a paternal attitude towards the poor. as an advocate for the poor, in this climate of lack of respect and concern. In conjunction with this, Fr. Ivers 
One should help the poor so that even­tually they will be able to help them­selves. In his Church there is a painting of the Last Supper, and all those seated around the table are represented by various black leaders. This is the Church's way of being sensitive to the needs of its people and identifying with them. Fr. Ivers understands the impor­tance of role models in a child's devel­opment, and this painting, combined with his efforts to develop Black leaders within the community, are ex­amples of how he is trying to provide these role models.

Prisoner's rights not 
0 

violated by US 

Dear Editor: 
I feel I must reply to Maura O'Siochain's letter criticizing our gov­ernment's handling of the United Kingdom's request for the extradition of Joseph Doherty. Ms. O'Siochain states Mr. Doherty has been held in this country for over five years without charge, in violation of his rights, while the U.K. has tried to extradite him for "political" crimes. 
Mr. Doherty, a member of the provisional Irish Republican Army, was convicted in the U.K. in 1981 of the murder of a British army captain. He escaped from prison that same year and fled to the United States, where he was arrested in 1983 for illegally enter­ing the country without a passport. The 
U.K. 
requested extradition, but Judge Sirozzo of the Southern District of New York ruled that Mr. Doherty's crimes came within the political activities ex­ception to the U.S.-U.K. extradition treaty existing at that time, and so he denied extradition. If that treaty was still in effect today, the reasoning be­hind Judge Sirozzo's ruling would deny extradition to the U.K. of those who bombed Pan Am flight 103. The U.S. Senate moved quickly to pass a new extradition treaty that retroactively in­cluded such political offenses as the murder of a British soldier. Since that time, he has been fighting extradition for the murder, and deportation to the 

U.K. 
(he is a British citizen) for his illegal entry into this country. She states that four other federal district court judges have ruled that Mr. Doherty's crimes were political. This is not correct. Judge Sirozzo's ruling is, unfortunately, not subject to appeal. Therefore, the U.S. government was forced to mount four separate col­lateral attacks (an attack questioning the proceedings, not the substantive ruling). All four were dismissed on procedural grounds, not because Mr. 


·--' ' 
Doherty's crimes were political. 
Mr. Doherty has not been held with­out charge, as she would have us to believe. He is free to leave this country at any time, as long as he is willing to return to the U.K. to serve out his life­sentence. His legal rights have been in no way violated in this country. 
She states that Mr. Doherty seeks po­litical asylum in the U.S. This also is not correct. He is trying to be ex­tradited to the Republic of Ireland, where he is only under a 10-year sen­tence for other crimes. I have no doubt these are political also. 
She tells us that the British legal sys­tem has been criticized by governments worldwide as being unfair to Irish defendants. This is true. The govern­ments of such countries as Cuba, Libya, and Iran have all been highly critical of Britisb justice. Fortunately, their opinions carry little weight in the UK or elseshere. 
She ends by saying that as an Irish­American I should be angered by this great travesty of justice. I do feel anger, but it is directed at those who would wrap a murderer in the Irish tri­color and try to convince me he's a vic­tim.

Diversity not always desirable 
Dear Editor: 
English Department Chairman Joseph Buttigeig (The Observer, Feb. 
24) thinks that Notre Dame ought to honor Common Sense's two-year an­niversary. To the professor, it is a daring project accomplished by "a group of selfless student and faculty volunteers." It is a travesty of justice to Professor Buttigeig that Common Sense has not been recognized because it is a "voice of diversity." 
From reading Buttigieg's remarks, it would appear that Common Sense was a learned journal engineered by a group of brave and noble martyrs for the cause of The Truth. From reading Common Sense, it would appear that Buttigeig's judgment is serverely im­paired. This newspaper has published

articles which are offensive to the Cath­olic faith. To refresh your memory, Professor, Common Sense writers have called Cardinal Ratzinger "a Nazi," they've published scandalously absurd articles about the late Monsignor Escriva and the Catholic lay group that he founded, Opus Dei, and of course, they've poked fun at our Holy Father, John Paul II. Perhaps the folks who produce Common Sense like to criticize everything under the sun which doesn't fit their "progressive" viewpoint, but these Catholic priests that they've of­fended are inspirational figures to mil­lions of Catholics the world over: Ratzinger serves in a critical post in the Vatican heirarchy, Escriva has been nominated for canonization by one third of the Church's bishops, and the Pope is the Vicar of Christ on earth. While priestly celibacy may be a "sexual disorder" to the Common Sense staff, to Catholics, it is a sign of a person who has responded to a calling from God to give himself entirely to the 
people as "alter Christus." Few things in the world are more beautiful than the priestly ministry. Yet to the folks behind Common Sense, it is something to be made fun of, an anachronism in our modern, "progressive" brave new world. 
It cannot_ be denied that Common Sense brings diversity to the Notre Dame media, but from the tone of some of its articles, it does not appear to be a good type of diversity. While every­one is entitled to his1ler opinion, there are limits to tolerance. When individ­uals blaspheme the sacred, when they live in a Catholic University, yet dem­onstrate very little respect for the Cath­olic faith, then they do not deserve our toleration because they do not respect our beliefs. For Professor Buttigieg to demand that we honor Common Sense, it would appear that we would be dis­honoring our Catholic faith.

KYM MACARTHUR accent writer 
W
hen the lights dim and the audience hushes, only one sound invades the movie theatre--the steady "drip, drip" of water. The audience is overwhelmed by the intricate layers of rich sensory images presented in the opening scene of "Tap." 
From the outset of "Tap," in which Max Washington (Gregory Hines) dances with a frantic nervousness in his jail cell, you know that you have to like tap dancing to like this appropriately-titled film. 
Max grew up a black kid in the ghetto with an extraordi­nary talent for dancing. Disil­lusioned by the poverty of his hard-working father, also a dancer, Max turns to crime. Although his shady career pays well, eventually the law catches up with him and Max lands in jail. 
Upon his release, Max returns to the familiar streets, taking a job as a dishwasher and waiting for a better offer. Amy, his ex­girlfriend (Suzzanne Douglas), and Little Mo (Sammy Davis Jr.), her fa­ther, are now running the dance studio once owned by Max's late father. Little Mo sees in Max the possibility of realizing his dream of in­tegrating tap and modern rock. Amy sees Max as a man she still loves, but isn't sure she can live with. 
Although the story line holds its own, the truly out­standing aspect of "Tap" is the choreography. Henry LeTang, a New York native who has worked with dancers and boxers alike, colors the film with memorable dance scenes. The rhythm is con­tagious, transmitting the pul­sating drama of life itself-­the tap dance is life. 
Writer I director Nick Castle merges two art forms, and is so successful due to the artistic capability of Hines, Davis, and Douglas. "Tap" is a movie which will make you tap your feet as well as touch your emotions, 
The hard edges of the real world are glossed-over, and extreme realists will object, but "Tap" certainly enter­tains. If you've had enough of reality--midterms, winter, bad SYR dates--surrender to the excitement of "Tap."

hen a student drops a glass or breaks a bowl in the dining hall, heads turn to look and scattered cheers break out. This occassional embarassing moment may be funny to on-lookers. However, such an incident is funny only once or twice. One hour and a half of objects (often price­less ones) being destroyed be<!omes tedious. Unfortun­ately, this is exactly what happens in the new John Candy comedy, "Who's Harry Crumb?" 
There does happen to be a plot somewhere among the debris of ruined living rooms and offices. Harry Crumb (John Candy) is the last "in a long line of great Crumb detectives." He is called in by the home office to solve the kidnapping of Jennifer Downing, daughter of multi­millionaire P.J. Downing. 
The president of Crumb and 
Bill Watterson 

Crumb, Eliot Draisen (played by Jeffrey Jones) calls Harry to take this case based on his belief that Crumb is hope­lessly incompetent. This is because Draisen is actually the kidnapper, trying to get $10 million dollars from Downing. By doing this, he hopes to convince Downing's wife, Helen, to leave her hus­band for him and his new­found money. 
Draisen's obsession with Helen (played by Annie Potts) allows him to overlook the fact that she is only con­cerned with money. What he does not realize, however, is that Helen is actually plot­ting, with her tennis pro boyfriend, to kill Downing for his millions. It becomes Crumb's job to wade through this mess of greed and deceit. He eventually does, through no fault of his own. 
Candy, always willing to appear foolish to get a laugh, takes things too far in this film. In one visit to Downing's office, he gets bit­ten by a piranha and kills it, puts both hands into a trayful of fish hooks, and destroys an antique model of a ship along with the glass case it sits in. 
Not only is Crumb's clumsi­ness over-emphasized, but his considerable frame is of­ten taken advantage of for laughs. As one of his many subtle disguises, Crumb dresses as a jockey when he goes to the racetrack. He gets firmly stuck while talking on the phone in a booth designed for jockeys. 
Annie Potts does a wonder­ful job as Helen Downing, the cheating, greedy wife. This role is so unlike the one she has on the TV series, "Designing Women," that it is fun to watch. The sight of her repeatedly smacking and berating her brainless boyfriend is hysterical. She plays the part well of a wo­man who really does not care what man she is with, as long as he has money. 
Jeffrey Jones also makes the movie more enjoyable with his performance as Draisen. In this film, his obsessed character is some­what similar to the high school principal he played in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." The lengths Draisen goes to so as to insure his future with Helen are unbelievable. His exterior look of a successful business executive amusingly contrasts with his inner sleaziness. 
The promotions for this movie claim Crumb has "nerves of steel, body of iron, and brain of stone." The brain part quickly becomes apparent. Crumb never really solves any part of the case. The solutions fall directly into his bumbling path. 
This film fails when it tries to imitate the style of others such as "Airplane" and "The Naked Gun." The humorous slapstick quality of these movies is nowhere to be found in "Who's Harry Crumb?" The only crumbs anyone should see are those found on dining hall tables.

Agents may be tried apart 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO--A defense attorney on Tuesday sought to have sports agent Lloyd Bloom tried separately from colleague Norby Walters onfederal charges including racketeering and extortion. Both men are.accused of using cash and threats to line up college athletes as clients. 
At a brief hearing, U.S. district Judge George Marovich said he would rule on the motion Wednesday before empaneling the jury. Marovich also postponed until Wednesday ruling on a move by prosecutors to introduce new evidence, and on a request by defense attorney Robert Gold to remove himself as Walter's attorney if that evidence is allowed.. 
Prosecutors had indicated Monday that they might seek new charges against Walters, who already faces counts of wire fraud, mail fraud, and extortion. Bloom faces similar charges. 
But U.S. attorney Anton Valukas told Marovich Tuesday that they would instead seek only to submit the new evidence. 
Gold said the evidence could cause him to remove himself from the case by requiring him to testify in Walters' defense. 
Defense attorney Dan Webb said he wanted to have Bloom tried separately from Walters because their defenses could conflict with each other. The trial of the New York­based agents was to begin here Wednesday. 
Marovich reiterated Tuesday his irritation at the prospect of delaying the case, telling attorneys for both sides, "As I indicated to you yesterday, I wanted to put the tourniquet on our baby and stop the bleeding." 
He told the attorneys to outline their motions at a private hearing in his chambers, and said he would be ready to rule Wednesday. 
"I don't mean to be wishy-washy, but somebody is going to go to trial Wednesday," Marovich said. 
Prosecutors contend that Walters, 58, and Bloom, 29, backed by a reputed mobster, used lucrative bonuses to sign college athletes to contracts, then threatened to break their legs--or worse--if they tried to back out. 
The case is being closely monitored because it raises serious questions about the structure and practice of big-money college athletics, especially football programs that are lucrative for schools. 
Several professional athletes who dealt with the two agents are expected to be called as witnesses. 
Walters and Bloom are accused of offering cash, cars, clothing, concert tickets and trips to dozens of college athletes in exchange for signed--and usually postdated--agreements giving them exclusive rights to represent the athletes in professional contract negotiations. 
The government says such agreements defra4ded the universities involved because the athletes continued to receive athletic scholarships even though those same 
contracts made them ineligible under NCAA rules. 
The indictment also alleges that the two agents threatened the players with physical or economic harm if they wanted out to back out of the contracts..

Irish tennis faces challenges in southern California 
By BOB MITCHELL Sports Writer 
"Make sure you bring your suntan lotion, bathing suit and a towel. 
"Oh yeah, bring a tennis racket or two, and maybe we'll hit around." 
Although these aren't the ex­act words of Head Coach Bob Bayliss, the Notre Dame men's tennis trip to California will not be all relaxation. In between the fun and sun, the 11-4 Irish will stop in Westwood, Ca., and hit around with the No.1 team in collegiate tennis, UCLA on March 6. The following day, the to Southern Cal's Marks Stadium to take the court against the No.12 Trojans. 
"The trip is a chance to con­tinue to compete, to improve and to challenge ourselves," said Bayliss. "Yet it is some­thing of a reward for a job well done so far this season." 
Before those uphill battles, Notre Dame will hold over in La Jolla, Ca. to partake in the Pacific Coast Doubles compe­tition from March 3-5. At the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club, some premier collegiate schools will enter their doubles teams to fight for the crown. The Irish will enter four duos Also, the PCD will acclamate the Irish to the outdoor setting of all four of its matches in Cal­ifornia. "The Pacific Coast Doubles will give us a chance to compete a:t a high level," said Bayliss. "But it will ease the grind of dual matches." 


To continue its Top 25 schedule, the Irish will combat the best that collegiate tennis has to offer when they take on the Bruins. Looking for the first victory against a Top 25 foe, UCLA is not likely to fall prey, and grant the Irish their wish. 
"We have no illusions," said Bayliss. "We have nothing to lose. But by no means are we just showing up to say we played UCLA. We want to see what we can do." 
Playing UCLA will probably put a loss on their record, but the Irish, according to Bayliss, benefit in other ways. 
"Going against UCLA helps us recruit," said second-year head coach Bob Bayliss. "A kid knows that if he comes here that he can play the best. Also, it is good to measure yourself against the best." 
With the top ranking, it is not coincidental that UCLA has a long list of excellent players. No.1 Buff Farrow is at the top of that list. Farrow, who finished No.5 last year in the nation, currently holds the No.10 slot. Farrow is an excel­lent all-court player whose strength is his serve-and-volley approach to the game. 


The Bruins' No. 1 doubles team of Pat Galbraith-Brian Garrow is the defending NCAA champions and currently the No.1 ranked team in the country. 
"I'm not worried about the wmnmg or losing," said Bayliss. "Win, lose or draw, we should be out there compet­ing." 
Regardless of the outcome of the UCLA contests, the Irish must hop over to the USC campus on March 7. The Trojans, who have 12 National Tennis Championship banners (second to UCLA's 15) boast of a No.12 national ranking. Con­tinuing the legend of Wimbel­don champion and alumni Stan Smith is No. 1Byron Black. The 5-9 Zimbabwe native, ranked 27th in pre-season rankings,

Once again the Irish are the clear underdogs in this matchup, but Bayliss is eyeing a competitive match. 
"I told my players not to be suprised if they find them­selves in a competetive match," said Bayliss. "USC is a scrappy, confident team. Also, Californian teams tend to think there is no way they can lose to an eastern school." 
To conclude spring break, the Irish will take on the Navy's Midshipmen in La Jolla on March 9. Although unranked, Navy is a formidable foe that the Irish can not afford to take lightly. For Bayliss, the Navy ­matchup has specific sig­nificance since he coached there from 1970-1984 and holds the distinction of the only men's tennis coach not to lose to Army. 
"They're not as match ready as we are but they are very anxious and dangerous," said Bayliss. "Navy has one of the best teams they've had in several years.

Schoendienst, Barlick elected to Hall of Fame 
Associated Press 
TAMPA, Fla. --Former St. Louis Cardinals second baseman Red Schoendienst and National League umpire Al Barlick were elected to baseball's Hall of Fame Tues­day by the veterans commit­tee. 
Schoendienst played 18 years in the majors, 14 with the Cards, and was the Cardinals manager from 1965-75. He cur­rently is a coach on Whitey Herzog's St. Louis staff.

B.P. still would not quit, ral­lying to within four at 34-30. But the Blitz did not score again as Lewis scored the last eight points of the ball game. 

Ellen Mouch of Lewis led all scorers with 15 points, while Ciccone and Marcie Powell had 8 points apiece for the Rebels. Mangan finished with 14 for the Blitz. The Rebels killed B.P. with their free throw shooting. Lewis tallied 15 baskets in 21 attempts from the charity stripe, while B.P. hit 6 of 10. 
B.P. coach Jeff Heilert said the Lewis man-to-man defense really hurt his team. 
"We haven't seen man-to­man defense in ages," he said. "I can't remember the last time we've had to play against a defense like this. We tried a lot of different things today, we'll just have to figure out what works for Thursday." 
Lewis coaches Tom Zidar and Mark Laboe were obvi­ously pleased with their team's performance. 
"I guess it helped us to play a couple of games in a row," said Zidar. "We've gotten a lot better. The run we had at the end of Monday's game against

"We have to shoot the ball really well," said Zidar, "because we don't get a lot of offensive rebounds. When we don't shoot well, we're not a very good team." 
Breen~Phillips, on the other hand, has to take better care of the ball and make the most of its height inside to have a chance at becoming Interhall champions on Thursday. With Mangan and junior Vicki Buth, the Blitz have the best one-two inside scoring punch in the league, and they will have to make the most of it to beat Lewis in the championship game.

Mter reading last week's issue of Sports Illustrated--an issue which focused on the com­plete lawlessness of Oklahoma's football program--1 was appalled at the depths to which college football has fallen. 
And, like every other student with a deep loyalty to a school, I tried to convince myself that no matter how badly the boys act at times, nothing they could do would bring that type of embarrassment to this school. 
After all, isn't this Notre Dame, home of all that is good and decent in the world?

"·~ 
Doesn't the constant reminder of the Virgin Mary sitting on the Golden Dome watching over our every move prevent our players and students from defiling the school's name with unseemly behavior? 
None of us are that naive. 
But I didn't think that in one week two of our football team's most prominent athletes would play such a major role in dragging our university down to the level of such paragons of morality as Oklahoma, SMU, or Miami for that matter. 
This is not the say that the actions by two players necessarily condemns the entire team or is indicative of a growing lack of concern by the players for the school and the ideals which it represents. 
But how can we stereotype schools such as Miami as breeding grounds for illiterate con­victs and piously speak as if we--supposedly the nation's premier Catholic university--are any different when two of our players spend the offseason inventing new driving tech­niques on the streets of South Bend. 
I'm afraid this is blatant hypocrisy. 
If our football players--or any other students participating in activities in the school's name--are good enough to represent Notre Dame on the field, they should be mature enough to take responsibility for their actions 

off. 
There are those who say that these players are being wrongly showered in media atten­tion normal students would not receive. 
But when you agree to accept the media in all your glory--after the big win, after a na­tional championship--you have to be ready to be bombarded by it when your actions aren't quite as admirable. 
Many people, especially children, respect the team for its accomplishments and look up the the players as role models. 
Maybe society puts too much pressure on its exemplary athletes. Maybe we expect too much when we ask them to live by the same standards as the rest of us. 
But I would hope that the discipline and dedication it takes to be a varsity athletes would help make these players be better people, better citizens, and not the latest faces on the police lineup. 
Needless to say, Notre Dame is no Okla­homa. 
Our team has no Charles Thompsons charged with selling cocaine. The Irish don't have players like Jerry Parks, shooting fellow teammates in the chest after disagreements. 
But too often, it is easy to hide behind the aura of Notre Dame. 
Lets just admit that we can't expect everyone--especially 6'5, 220-pound men who pay their way through school by participating in a violent contact sport called football--to be saints. 
But that doesn't exempt anyone from the constraints which guide the rest of society. Its time to either live up to the ideals which this university supposedly espouses or ignore our obligation to stand above such behavior. 
Lets make sure that the next time a Notre Dame a football player appears on the cover of Sports Illustrated, it is to celebrate another victory and not to be ushered into a police squad car in hand cuffs dressed in orange prison suit.

Canadian drug inquiry starts 

Associated Press 
TORONTO--The federal inquiry into drugs and athletics prompted by the disqualification from the Olympics of Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson resumed Tuesday with hints of startling testimony to come. 
Commission counsel Robert Armstrong said he anticipates that athletes who will appear during the inquiry's review of track and field will admit to steroid use. 
He said the extent of the 
admissions "probably" will be 
greater than ever heard anywhere 
before and he urged that no one be 
penalized for his candor. 
Ontario Associate Chief Justice 
Charles Dubin, appointed by the 
federal government to investigate 
drug abuse in Canadian amateur 
athletics after the Olympic scandal 
last September, said there was 
merit to the observation and it 

would be considered at the proper 
time. 

The commission has sweeping 
powers to summon. and hear 
testimony but has no mandate to 
sanction. It could issue 
recommendations that could be 
followed by the Canadian Track 
and Field Association, however. 
Appearing for what is certain to 
be days of testimony was Charlie 
Francis, Johnson's coach since the 
sprinter first came to the 
Scarborough Optimists Track and 
Field Club at age 15. 
The coach, who detailed the accomplishments of his runners with a remarkably accurate recall, has not spoken publicly since Johnson was stripped of the 100­. meter gold medal at Seoul after a positive test for anabolic steroids. 
Francis said Johnson first came 
to the track club with his older 
brother, Eddie, in 1977 and 
showed little indication of becoming a world champion at that young age. 
Johnson, now 27, was showing promise by 1981 and by 1986 was ranked No. 1 in the world in the 100 meters. 
Francis offered detailed testimony of building his group of sprinters from four in 1976 to some 30 who garnered an impressive collection of national domination and international wins. 
In his only comment on the Seoul scandal since September, he issued a brief statement last fall that suggested the sprinter's urine test may have been sabotaged. 
"Such a test result defies all logic and, in my opinion, can only be explained by a deliberate manipulation of the testing process," Francis said in the Oct. 3 statement.

Dear Irish Items, 
I'm writing to request that you inform your sports-minded student body that we on the 
U.S. Olympic Committee tend to spare no expense in order that our athletes get the best preparation possible. 
Dear Mr. Steinbrenner, 
Sounds like a good idea. It. sure has worked well for your Yankees, hasn't it George? 
Dear Irish Items, 
I hear Oklahoma is getting a new defensive coordinator. 
Dear Heff, 
Yes they are. And his motto is, "The best defense is a cri­minal offense." 

Dear Irish Items, 
I'm guilty. I admit that I sit home on Friday nights and look at my Sports Illustrated Swim­suit Issue wishing Notre Dame girls looked like that. Dear Stumped in Stanford, 
That's OK. Maybe there's a nomination for Defense Secre­tary in your future. Dear Irish Items, 
Everyone talks about in­flated prices at the Bookstore. Have you come across any bar­gains since you've been at Notre Dame? 
Dear Napes, 
There was the time that The Sun Devil House ran out of glasses in Phoenix at the post­Fiesta Bowl party. Do you con­sider 50 cents for a cupped handful of beer a bargain? Dear Irish Items, 
Why can't the band perform while the ball is in play during basketball games anymore? 
Dear JB, The answer is obvious. Be­cause if the band played then 

· the cheerleaders would prob­ably dance. And if the cheer­leaders were dancing and cheering it would be so hard to concentrate on the game. Dear Irish Items, 
You make my liver quiver. 
Dear Kelley, Stay away from my photo album. 
Dear Irish Items, 
You call yourself a writer? Ha! How much longer do we have to put up with your once­a-week waste of 16 inches of newspaper space? 
Dear Dad, 
Just one more column after Spring Break. (P.S. Send money).

By DAVE McMAHON Sports Writer 
Morrissey forced a final game to determine the men's Interhall basketball champion last night by outscoring Fisher 18-8 in the fourth quarter en route to a 46-36 victory over the Green Wave. Action gets un­derway tonight at 6 p.m. in Gym 2 of the Joyce ACC for the final battle. 
Mter Morrissey posted a 20­18 halftime advantage, Fisher tied the score the score at 28 to end the third quarter. A 30-29 Green Wave lead was enough to inspire the Manor to imple­ment its fast paced offense, reeling off eight unanswered points to post a 37-30 lead with 
4:12 remaining. 
"We ran our fastbreak well, but we didn't do a good job of shutting down Todd Wagenblast," said Morrissey's Tom Veltz. Wagenblast finshed the night with 14 points. 
Freshman Rod Culver poured out nine points in the fourth quarter before ending with 13 for the Manor. Soph­mores Derrick Johnson and Veltz each contributed 11 points to the Morrissey cause. Kevin Keyes and Ed Larkin scored 7 and 4 points, respec­tively. "We had a height ad­vantage and just took it right at them," said Johnson. "We had more of a great all around team performance rather than looking for just one key player." 
Fisher, which came into the game having won 11 consecu­tive games, lost for the first time this season. The Green Wave was led by Wagenblast and Paul Fulling, who scored nine points. Despite a well-

played first half, the Green Wave slowly faded in the second. The Manor converted on its fastbreak attempts and a few untimely Fisher turn­overs led to a less than par per­formance in the final quarter. 
"Our defensive intensity was not as high as it should have been," said Fisher's Fulling. "We gave them too many open shots, which we can't do against a team with their shoot­ing ability.'' 
In tonight's game to decide the champion, both teams will stick with the same game plans that were used last night. 
"We'll try to run the break again and play a little better 
on defense," said Veltz. Fisher hopes to end season with a single against eleven wins.  the loss

Irish, DePaul crash the boards 
By MARTY S'PRASEN Sports Editor 

Notre Dame basketball co­ach Digger Phelps knows his team has a lot of rebounding to do when it hosts DePaul tonight at the Joyce ACC. 
First, the Irish will have to rebound from their collapse against Georgia Tech this past Saturday, in which Notre Dame blew a 17-point lead, gave up 60 points in the second half and lost 90-80. But more importantly for tonight's 8 p.m.

"They've got great athletes and they really pound the boards," said Phelps, whose 17­6team ranks third in the nation in rebounding margin with a difference of more than nine per game. "Our concern is not letting them get the second and third efforts on offensive rebounding situations." 
DePaul has a rebounding margin of plus-five.
