By PATRICK O'CONNOR 
Staff Reporter 
Although surveys estimate that as many as 66 percent of the students at some univer­sities cheat on exams, cheating is much less a problem at Notre Dame, according to faculty members. 
"Our faculty doesn't per­ceive (cheating) as a big prob­lem," said Jerry Marley, assis­tant dean of the College of Engineering. He said the fac­ulty has "been in a mode of at­tempting to conduct exams that limit the opportunity to cheat." 
"Cheating is not at all a big problem . . . as long as I watch 
over (the students)," said His­tory Professor Leon Bernard. 
The College of Engineering has only one or two cases a year, said James Taylor, dean 
'of the College of Engineering. 
~, 
Formal charges are filed only occasionally, he said. 
Mary Clancy, assistant pro­fessor of biological sciences, however, estimated that in a large class of 200 students, as many as 20 percent may take an exam dishonestly while less than 1 percent are caught.

Ashes to ashes 
By JIM LANG News Staff 
Seniors involved in the job­hunting process this year have a definite advantage over those who graduated in 1987, accor­ding to Kitty Arnold, director of Career and Placement Ser­vices. 
Arnold expained that in 1987­88 "we're having a much more positive interviewing year." So far there has been a 27 percent increase in the number of in­terviews held on-campus this year. That should taper off to about a 15 percent increase by spring, said Arnold. 
Of those seniors who take ad­vantage of Career and Place­ment Services, Arnold esti­mated that approximately 50 to 60 percent successfully locate jobs in their fields. At least 80 percent of those are accounting majors. The remaining percentage is divided mainly between MBA's and finance majors. 
The primary consideration for most seniors who are nar­rowing down offers is the ac­tual job function they will per­form, said Arnold. They are most concerned about whether they will be happy in a certain position, she said. 
Another important consider­ation for many seniors is loca­tion, Arnold said. "Most people have a preference, but for some that preference is much more stronger." 
In addition, there are several other factors to be considered, such as the nature of the com­pany and compensation. For senior Mike Albertone, who recently landed an accounting job with Price-Waterhouse, compensation came first. 
''Any of the Big 8 accounting firms are similar in most ways but money," said Albertone,

Delay sought in Beauchamp trial 
Associated Press 
PONTIAC, Mich. -A judge will decide Monday whether to grant a motion to delay the trial of an Ohio man charged in the slayings of the parents of Notre Dame Executive Vice President William Beauchamp. 
Defense attorney Cyril Hall asked for the murder trial of Michael Root, 30, to be delayed for 10 days after the prosecution asked that an independent expert be al­lowed to examine new evidence that could physi­cally link Root to the vic­tims. 

The Youngstown man is charged with first-degree murder and first-degree cri­minal sexual conduct in the Sept. 8 slaying of Marion and Edward Beauchamp in their home in Ferndale, a Detroit suburb. 
Oakland County Circuit Judge Robert Anderson was to rule on the motion Wed­nesday, but postponed the decision until Monday mor­ning, according to a court administrator. No reason was given for the adjourn­ment. 


Leave taken by Fisher rector 
By MICHELLE LAROSE 
News Staff 
Brother Edward Luther, Fis­her Hall rector, left Fisher Wednesday to enter a one-week alcoholism assessment pro­gram, according to Father David Tyson, vice president for Student Affairs. 
The program will determine if Luther needs long-term treatment, Tyson said. 
Fisher Hall residents learned of Luther's leaving Wednesday 
night  at  a  mandatory  hall  
meeting called by Tyson.  
Assistant  Rector  Joe  Ross  

will serve as acting rector, Tys~m said. 
"Brother Ed is still the rector of Fisher Hall and will be on his return to campus," Tyson said. 
Luther entered a program at Guest House, a treatment cen­ter for alcoholic priests and brothers in Michigan, after an "intervention" Wednesday at 11 a.m. by concerned members of his religious order. 
"The intervention is basi­cally a meeting that could be between family members or friends and the individual that expresses concern in a positive light, but also focuses on any problem pattern that may have developed'', said Tyson after the hall meeting. 
Father Steve Newton, a Holy Cross associate who has had extensive experience in alcohol counseling, said Luther would undergo physical, psychologi­cal and emotional tests at Guest House to determine if al­coholism is present. 
Wish your friends a Happy Birthday through Observer advertising. Call 239·5303 for details. 
Newton said at the end of the week, based on the diagnosis, Luther could enter a three­month, long-term treatment program. He said the treat­ment program for alcoholic priests and brothers is longer than regular programs, be­cause many of them come in with a lot of "excess baggage" that prohibits them from seeing their alcoholism as a "disease, rather than a moral or ethical fault." 
Tyson also said the hall would be informed of the diag­nosis. 
Tyson said there had been concern for some time on the part of other members of the religious community, but also said· they were "very optimis­tic" about the treatment out­come. 
Luther is in his second year as rector of Fisher. He was pre­viously rector of Morrissey Hall. 
A Fisher resident assistant said Luther was great to work for and he would like to see him back as soon as possible.

Reagan budget sent for Congress debate 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Reagan on Wednesday prepared to send his fiscal1989 spending plan to Congress and launch the last and likely least contentious budget debate of his presidency. 
The $1.1 trillion fiscal blueprint being unveiled Thursday was expected to reprise Reagan's oft-rejected requests for cutting domestic programs, with some new proposals for transferring gov­ernment functions including parks management and per­haps Amtrak railroad service to private industry. 
But the plan also was being crafted to comply with the spending agreement reached last fall in the budget "sum­mit" between Reagan and con­gressional leaders. 
Since the budget summit agreement spells out overall spending and tax levels, includ­ing allocations for the military, domestic programs and foreign aid, this year's battles

Tim Dempsey, Resident of Dismas House 
were expected to focus on the details rather than the thrust of the budget priorities. 
The pact should help smooth the budget's path through Congress, since the balance be­tween domestic and military spending totals is annually one of the most difficult. 
ln addition, Democratic leaders have pledged to speed the process and avoid packing all spending into a single, mas­sive bill as they did in a $600 billion mea!O;ure last year. 
When Reagan pledged in his State of the Union address never again to sign such legis­lation, "he was preaching to a choir already converted," House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said this week. 
White House estimates show his plan, under the administra­tion's own assumptions of how the economy will fare next year, would produce a deficit of $143 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.

Higgins, head of the 75-man, multinational observer group attached to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, was kid­napped in southernmost Lebanon after returning from talks with Shiite Moslem militia officials. 
He is one of 36 members of the U.N. Truce Supervisory Or­ganization, which observes United Nations efforts to keep the peace along Israel's volatile borders with its Arab neighbors. 
The observer team has been operating since 1949 and fewer than 20 of the American mem­bers are assigned to duties along the Lebanese-Israeli bor­der, the State Department said. 
Department Charles Redman, asked if the United States will continue taking part in the observer mis­sions, replied: "Yes."

get people to ask them ques­tions on campus," Doyle said. 
"The Georgetowns, the Ivies (colleges) and the Stanfords, look to us to see what's going on at Notre Dame," he added. 
Communication between stu­dent government and the stu­dents is also a priority, Doyle said. 
"What we would like to do is improve communications and then, hopefully, from that im­prove the image of student gov­ernment," Doyle noted. 
Doyle said he would like to have a weekly column in the student publications to inform the students of what is going on. 
Students could also write in to the column, he added. 
"Student government sort of gets lost a little bit ... with the student body because people don't know what is going on," said Doyle. 
The student publications are read by most of the students, he noted. 
"If people just knew what was going on in student govern­ment then they'd be more likely to get involved," he said. 
. Doyle said he hopes to im­prove relations with University administrators by having them sit in on student government meetings as observers.

A thief took the T.V. from a group of law students at Kentucky last month. A thief entered a student lounge where several law students were watching the program, "Superior Court." The man said he was with the company that had rented the television to the school, and that he needed it back. The students asked him to wait until the show was over, so he watched the rest of the program with them. Some of the students then helped the thief take the television from a wall rack.

Third World cuisine was served at Santa Clara University recently, as students turned in their evening meals in order to become more aware of world hunger.

Obsession leads to killing 
Associated Press 

SUNNYVALE, Calif. -A four­year obsession with a co­worker's smile ended with a Silicon Valley technician blast­ing into a top-secret defense plant, killing seven people with a shotgun and wounding four, including the woman who spurned him, police said Wed­nesday . 
"I'm not crazy -I know I will die as a result of this," Robert Wade Farley, 39, told hostage negotiator Ruben Grijalva before surrendering Tuesday night, more than five hours after a fusillade announced his arrival at the ESL Inc. plant. He had been fired from his

$36,000-a-year job there in May 
1986 for poor performance. 

"It didn't appear there was any way he could have been stopped," said police Capt. AI Scott. 
Flags flew at half-staff at the ESL complex on Wednesday, and employees appeared som­ber. Counselors were available for those who needed help . 
Grijalva said the price of sur­render was a turkey-and-ham sandwich and a soda. "He sur­rendered for a No. 26 from Togo's and a Diet Pepsi," said the Sunnyvale Public Safety Department negotiator. 
Grijalva quoted Farley as saying the attack stemmed from his obsession with en­gineer Laura Black, 26. 
"He said he was in love with 
her from the first moment he 
saw her," Grijalva told the San 
Francisco Examiner. "It was 
her smile. 
"He knew she was not at­
tracted to him, but he told her 
it wouldn't end until either she 
went out with him or he died." 
Little was known of Farley's past, Scott said. He was never married and had no children. Farley had relatives in Califor­nia, Texas and Germany and had served 11 years in the Navy, mostly shore duty, Scott said. 
The incident began at about 
2:55 p.m. PST when Farley drove up in a rented motor home at ESL, which holds mil­lions of dollars in contracts with the Department of Defense and other government agencies. 
Police later found more 
weapons, ammunition and 
cans of gasoline in the motor 
home, Scott said. 
"He had a lot of guns and a 
lot of gun knowledge -ap­
parently a lifetime hobby," 
Scott said.

Campaign coverage lacks substance 
You really have to admire Dan, Tom and Peter. They are really doing the best they can with such limited materi­al. You could not take your average three guys off of the street and have them turn an immensely boring elec­tion into a tedious, mind-numbing ex­ercise in futility. What is even more admirable is that these three guys get paid a lot of money for doing this. 
Brian Broderick 
r sincerely yours 
You know who they are. These three guys come on television at various times to report on how some of our fa­vorite candidates are doing in the cur­rent primary or caucus which they tell us that we should be interested in. First they make an assumption that the gen­eral public really cares that George Bush defeated Robert Dole in New Hampshire, or that the only people who voted for AI Haig were immediate fam­ily members and then they proceed to deluge us with meaningless charts, uni­nteresting percentages and generally inane analysts in order to better explain what has just happened. We get such insightful commentary telling us that George Bush has regained momentum in the race or that, with only three votes, Al Haig will probably have to leave the race. 
What is even more annoying is listen­ing to all of the political pundits the next day. This little practice becomes excruciatingly painful as all of our psuedo-analysts merely repeat what the clown on television said the night before. This "monday morning" politicking proves my theory that this whole primary-caucus system stag­nates whatever potential intellect there is out there in society. 
It is not fair to put all of the blame on our esteemed national newscasters and their team of crack(pot) analysts. We have to take a close look at the jokers who are actually seeking their party's nomination. 
It is apparent now that each party has its own version of the three wise men, or the three stooges, depending on how you look at it. As the old saying goes, "never h1,1s so little been said by so many.'' The origin of this quote prob­ably comes from any observer of a Notre Dame student body presidential race. Oh sure,. it was amusing at first, Bush and Dole's childish sniping, Gary Hart's libidinous journey through politics and Paul Simon's All-American good looks. But the novelty of it all wore off in about an hour. Now we are stuck with six men running around the country stumping to gain delegates, 


Doonesbury 
and a few other pretenders who do not realize that there are better things to do with their money than squandering it on hopeless causes. 
Now please do not accuse me of being apathetic. I honestly believe that we Americans need a good leader after eight years of incompetent bumbling. But I do not believe that any of the cur­rent crop of candidates has the capacity to be president. 
We need to find a middle ground be­tween the charismatic personality and the issue-minded technocrat. There must be someone out there in this great country of ours who can combine intel­lect with personality, who can express his ideas on issues without being as dull as golf on television. In the meantime we are stuck with Dan, Tom and Peter and their incessant ramblings on exit polling and momentum. By the way, I hear Jacques Cousteau has a fascinat­ing special on the underwater mating habits of crustaceans next primary day on PBS. Tune in.

P.O. Box Q 
Boycott's strength lies in awareness 
Dear Editor: 
In a Feb. 9 Observer guest column, Kevin Smant opposed the recent plea for a Coca Cola boycott. Smant accuses this campus of having a one-item foreign policy agenda, namely South Mrican apartheid. He suggests that this is because nothing else catches policymakers' attention. He suggests that these efforts by local activists are futile. Wrong. These people are truly concerned with worldwide injustice and certainly one can understand that the relatively small number of activists re­quires that they concentrate their ef­forts for any impact whatsover. He cites thousands of Mghan children's hands being blown off by Soviet ''toys,'' the oppression of the Haitian people and the Vietnamese boat people. Agreed; but do these make apartheid protests meaningless? Do they make apartheid less offensive? 
I suggest that before condemning "our local activists" for their narrow­mindedness towards a chosen issue, we step aside and see the basic good of what they are trying to accomplish. We should have the insight to realize that a college professor's weeklong hunger strike against Contra aid should not be thoughtlessy rebuked with a sarcastic statement of its lack of effect on minds in Washington, but rather seen as some­one bringing attention to what he believes is right or maybe its potential effect on minds at Notre Dame and in the community. In a representative democracy such as ours, beyonci ou

duty to vote, it is up to the citizens to voice themselves on whatever issues they see fit. The point is not whether it directly changes minds in Washington, but that there are people telling us that they feel so strongly about these issues. 
These things are not done, as Smant charges, "just because they feel good or because slogans sound good" but to try to raise awareness in a carefree society. Mr. Smant says punishing South Mrica economically is not the an­swer; though he refrains from suggest­ing any other plausible possibilities, at least he agrees there's a problem.

Dear Editor: 
I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest appreciation and gratitude to all the performers of the 1988 Talent Show. To all the Notre Dame singers, dancers, lip-singers, dramatists, bands, emcees, "bumpers," "grinders," "pinch-and­squeezers" (however risky you may have been), you did an excellent job of presenting your talents Saturday night. 
But the show would never have been the success that it was without you, the audience. I thank those who coopera­tively supported this annual function. Just know that you are truly appreciat­ed. God Bless.

Collection concentrates 
on all aspects of sports 
H
CHRISTINE GREGORY accent writer ow many times have you walked by the Department of Special Collections and won­dered what was there? Come on, you know where It Is. As you go Into the library from campus, you pass the Periodi­cal Room on your left and the Department of Special Collec­tions on your right. As for what's there, several collections can be found. Among them are the Rare Book Collection, the Notre Dame Collection (a his­torical record of the University), and the Sports Research Collec­tion. 
''I'm not so much a sports fan, yelling and screaming for 
my team to win at all costs, as I am a fan of sport" says Jethro Kyles, curator of the Sports Research Collection. "And as It relates to research, I'm not Into numbers and sta· tistics as much as I am into seeing the overall picture: the socio-logical factors, the aca­demic consequences In the case of collegiate sport, and the historical aspects that sur­round sports. If someone calls from any one of those fields and wants Information, I have to be able to give them that." 
Kyles describes his duties as "coordinating various sports formats Into a resource cen­ter." And that is primarily what the Collection functions as. Students writing papers, aut­hors researching books, and network employees producing programs have all tapped the collection's resources during Kyles' six years as curator. "And of course there are the fans," he says. "You meet some great people. There will be guys who come here who played for Rockne. They'll be all friendly and outgoing as can be, and then I'll show them Rock's sweater that he used to wear to practice and they'll get real quiet and just stand there looking at it." 
Despite its abundance of sports artifacts, the collection is not primarily a museum. And although many people assume it's a "mini-shrine of Notre 
Dame," the collection is not that either. "We're proud of how broad the collection is," says Kyles. "And apart from the films, about 85 percent of the collection is non-Notre Dame." 
It is the expansiveness of the collection that is so impressive, making it "undoubtedly, the best collection in the United States." While some other schools have collections, they are very regional in scope. The University of Michigan's re­sources, for example, focus on hunting. fishing. and other Mid­western sports. Notre Dame's is not like that. 
First there are programs and guides. Thousands of them. They range from the Papoose Bowl (football) in 1946 and Notre Dame's opener in 1899 

(complete with color cover) to 
Spalding's basketball guide of 
1919. The guide features the 
rules, stars, and equipment of 
the day, including a basket 
with no hole and a ball with a 
seam. "We try to get to the 
origin," says Kyles. "To get 
back to the very earliest we 
can." 

There are also thousands of 
miscellaneous publications and 
magazines (40,000 total, and 
167 different titles). Prized 
pieces in this section include 
The Police Gazette of 1955, a 
magazine similar to Sports Il­
lustrated. One particular issue 
featured a picture of a young 
Joan Collins on the cover with 
the caption, "A Bad Girl Who 
Made Good." "We can see how 
magazines have changed: what 
was acceptable then. and what 
is now," says Kyles. Also, there 
are three first edition copies of 
Sports Illustrated, dated August 
16, 1954. "But what's really 
special is this," says Kyles. He 
pulls out a magazine from 
December 5, 195.3. It is a dum­
my, for the now entitled New 
Sport Magazine. This is what 
later became Sports Illustrated. 
Finally, there are the films: 
5,.300 reels. Many are of Notre 
Dame sports, and they have all 
been cleaned and in some 
cases edited. Often they will be 
pulled and use_d during televi· 
sion broadcasts. According to 
Kyles, "The reason you can see 
them on TV is because we take .good care of them. We make 
sure they're preserved." There 
are also reels and videotapes 
of professional games. 

The collection still does not stop there. There are I 00, 000 pieces of personal correspond­ence. There are scrapbooks. Additionally, Kyles has estab­lished a "strong network" around the country, with other libraries, sports organizations (including teams), and sports Halls of Fame. Therefore, if someone needs a material that Notre Dame doesn't have, Kyles can get the information or a copy from somewhere else. 
Lastly, there is the memorabilia: the "Knute Rockne: All-American" script; the football helmets and baseball mitts from the 20's; the baseball auto· graphed by Babe Ruth; and Joe Frazier's sparring gloves from the fight with Muhammad Ali. And on and on. There is not such an emphasis on international ma­terials, but the Olympics and Pan Am Games are represented in terms of resources and souvenirs alike. 
Kyles affirms that the mainte­nance of the collection is "con­cerned with the academic pur­suit of sports." Indeed, there is much to be learned from this collection which has been praised in the New York Times and Smithsonian maga-zine. Next time you don't feel like taking that left turn into the library, take a right into the Sports Research Collection in­stead. You'll be trans· ported back in time, and you may also pick up more than trivia and statistics about your favorite sport or athlete. 
What do you think of JPW? 
Complied by Cara Anthony and Christine Walsh Photos by Zoltan <Jry 
"At JPW lastyear, we had a dance, a dinner, and Sunday brunch. Probably about two-thirds to three-quarters of the junior's par­ents come. But. more parents would come, If It were held when the weather was better. Some par­ents adopt a junior for the weekend because their parents couldn't come. One bad thing about JPW Is that It's so expen­sive. The dinners can run up to $25 a head." 
Maureen Lynch 


Senior 
"My parents are coming out for JPW. I'm psyched. It should be a lot of fun. Your parents get to meet your friends and room­mates' parents. JPW can get pretty expensive, but my parents are paying for it. I think It's a good Idea that there aren't any other parties on campus JPW weekend. It's only one weekend out of the year, and we did It for all the other classes." 
Pat Marschall Junior 
"I don't think they should prohibit parties for JPW. Parents should get a realistic look ofcampus life. It's good to keep socializing low­key, but we shouldn't be putting on a false show for the parents. 
I don't look at the weekend as being any different on my part. It'sjust like a football weekend." 
Jill Simchuk Freshman 


"When I was an undergraduate at Saint Mary's, we had Sophomore Parents' Weekend. I think It's a great Idea. Parents get to see the University, and how their kids are living." 

Joanie McKenna Graduate student 


"They should give us every oppor­tunity to get away from the juniors and their parents. Actual­ly, they can do whatever they want, as long as they don't bother anyone else. If I were a junior, I'd tell my parents to stay as far away from campus as possible. The last thing we need around here Is a bunch of people running around In plaid pants." 
Chris Kametz Freshman 


"I think JPW Is a good Idea. I wish we weren't limited to three families per table. That breaks up a quad. It's a pain that we can only have two guests come. You can 't have your grandparents or little sister come as well. I think It's an excellent tradition, be· cause It's one ofthe last years you can really be with your parents. And It's good time spent with them."

USA starting to make strides with their figure skating pairs 
Associated Press 
CALGARY, Alberta-The Soviets may have won the gold, but the Americans put on their best showing in pairs skating in Olympic history. And U.S. coaches say it's just going to get better. 
American skaters Jill Watson of Bloomington, Ind., and Peter Oppegard skated for a bronze medal, while teammates Gil­lian Wachsman and Todd Wag­goner placed fifth -the first time_ two U.S. couples have placed in the top five since Olympic figure skating began in 1908. 
The third U.S. team, Kim and Wayne Seybold of Marion, Ind., placed lOth in Tuesday night's performance at the Sad­dledome. 
"We're right in there with the Russians, so that's a first," said Pauline Williams, who coaches Wachsman and Wag­goner. "And we have a lot more depth than we've ever had .. in years to come, other pairs teams will be able to keep this up." 

Ekaterina Gordeeva and Ser­gei Grinkov breezed into first place, extending a string of So­viet gold medals in the event that began in 1964, when the legendary Lyudmila Belousova and Oleg Protopopov won the pairs at the Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria. 
In second place were 1984 Olympic pairs champions Elena Valova and Oleg Vasiliev, while a third Soviet couple, Larisa Seleznova and Oleg Makarov a, came from be­hind to finish fourth. 
Oppegard, 28, of Knoxville, Tenn., took his and Watson's strong finish as a good omen. It was only the second bronze for the United States in that event and was the first U.S. medal of the current Games. 
"I think we are showing that the Americans have become very strong in the pairs event and will be a force to reckon with in the future," he said. 
Williams and other U.S. coaches including pairs coach Ron Ludington say dozens of strong pairs skaters are com­ing up through the ranks. 
They point to Californians Kristi Yamaguchi and Rudi Galindo as a prime example of what could become a winning tradition.

Zurbriggen can't get 2ndgold; Calgary wind alters schedule 
Associated Press 

CALGARY, Alberta-Pirmin Zurbriggen lost his shot at a second gold medal in a tangle of skis and poles. 
Unrelenting winds that reached 50 mph wrought havoc on the Olympic schedule, delaying the double-gold quest of Matti Nykanen, the "Flying Finn." Nykanen was going after an unprecedented second victory in ski jumping when the 90-meter team event was postponed until Thursday. 
The final two runs of the wo­men's luge also were postponed. 
The Soviet Union picked up two more medals -a silver and bronze from its women's cross­country team -to run its count to nine. That's six more than Finland, Switzerland and the Netherlands. 
The United States still has just one medal, a pairs figure skating bronze by Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard that could have been a silver except for Watson's costly pratfall. Speed skater Eric Flaim almost got the United States its second medal in the 5,000-meter speed skating event. He missed the bronze by 1.17 seconds, finish­ing fourth. 
Zurbriggen had only to finish the second ruri of a slalom race, and he would have earned his 

second gold, in a new Olympic event called the combined, a downhill-slalom hybrid. In­stead, he fell when he hooked a gate with his right ski, and that ended any talk of an Alpine sweep. 
"I felt I was skiing well, and I was very surprised to see the gates between my skis," the 25­year-old Swiss said. "I am dis­appointed, but the downhill was my main goal, and I still have more chances for gold." 

Zurbriggen, one of the most 
versatile skiers in the world, 
won the traditional downhill 
gold medal on Monday, then 
finished first in the combined 
downhill Tuesday. And talk 
was: is this the next Jean­
Claude Killy? can Zurbriggen 
sweep all the Alpine events, as 
Killy did in 1968 and as Toni 
Sailer did in 1956? 
He provided the answer Wed­
nesday, but with the addition 
of two more Alpine events, 
Zurbriggen still could win four 
golds, one more than either 
Killy or Sailer. Standing in his 
way will be the Italian, Alberto 
Tomba, the best slalom skier 
in the world and the man bat­
tling Zurbriggen for the World 
Cup title. 
Matikainen, a bronze medalist at 10 kilometers, won the women's 5-kilometer cross­country race, beating Tamara Tokhonova of the Soviet Union by a 1.3 seconds. Ventsene, who won the 10 kilometers, was third.

lnterhall hockey roundup 
Grace, 'Naugh reach playoffs 
By KELLY TOWNSEND Sports Writer 
In Interhall hockey action this week, Grace and Cavanaugh clinched playoff spots, while St. Ed'sHoly Cross has taken the game off the ice and into the NVA office with a protest against Keenan follow­ing Tuesday night's game. 
On Monday night, Grace gave a preview of things to come with a 13-3 drubbing of Dillon. Grace's high score was due in part to hard-playing Eric Dallas and fast-skating Steve Bishop. Dallas scored five goals for Grace with Bishop also getting a hat trick (three goals). 
The second part of Grace's success was a change in the gameplan, according to team captain Mark Galis. 
"We switched from three average lines to two strong lines," said Galis. "With the switch everything just came to­gether." 
Another team that clinched a 
spot in the playoffs was 
Cavanaugh with a 3-1 victory 
over Pangborn. 
Following scores by both teams early in the first half, the pressure of getting a playoff spot turned the game into a "hackfest." This led to both verbal and physical abuse hv both players and fans. 
By late in the second half, the Cr~saders were able to regain therr heads. The "Mexican Line'', led by Jim Mejia, put the pressure on Pangborn's goalie res~lting in a second goal by MeJia and an insurance goal by Don Chisholm. 
Keenan came from behind late in the second half to beat the combined St. Ed's-Holy Cross team 4-2 on Tuesday. Brian McMahon's two goals led Keenan to its first win this season. 

The win, however, could be marred by a protest lodged by St. Ed's-Holy Cross coach Paul Arends. Arends' protest is in answer to Keenan's use of at least one player who is not a Keenan resident. Jim Roll, the player in question, is currently a resident of Stanford. Arends brought the violation to the at­tention of the referees and the Keenan bench during halftime. 
"The coach from St. Ed's came over and told us that if we used Jim in the second half, he would protest," said Keenan's captain Bill Grunert. 
Grunert also admitted to having one player from Carroll and one from off-campus, both of whom have played most of the season for Keenan. Hopes of a playoff bid for St. Ed's­Holy Cross rests on the decision of the NVA office. Until the NVA Hockey Commissioner makes that decision, however, the game will stand as a 4-2 Keenan win. 
Well, here we go again ... 
NCAA investigating SMU in sports besides football 
Associated Press 
DALLAS-Southern Method­ist University, whose football program is serving the stiffest penalty ever imposed, is being investigated by the NCAA for possible rules violations in other sports, Athletic Director Doug Single confirmed Wed­nesday. 
Single said the NCAA is fol­lowing up on allegations revealed in a seven-month study of SMU athletics by a private investigative firm the university hired, the Dallas Times Herald reported Wed­nesday in a copyright story. 
The NCAA has not indicated which sports are under inves­tigation, but a source close to the inquiry told the newspaper the internal report focused on men's basketball and track.

other teams spread out their 
points and don't finish right be­
hind us." 
Notre Dame will face Purdue 
and ~ndiana along with Ball 
State, Indiana State and South­
ern Indiana, which is, accor­
ding to Piane, "a very good 
Division II school." 
Over 20 schools will compete in what amounts to yet another tough meet for the Irish. Piane is looking for a top three finish from his athletes. 
"Indiana and Purdue are both capable of placing in the top four of the Big Ten," said Piane. "Purdue is insisting that they can even win the Big Ten. Indiana State is a much improved team and Ball State was the Mid-American Confer­ence cross country champion, so naturally they'll be tough in the distance events. I think we can place in the top three if everything goes right." 
Among the athletes that Piane is counting on to perform well is sophomore Mike O'Connor. Also being expected to have an exceptional meet are junior Ron Markezich and senior co-captain Dan Garrett. 
Markezich and Garrett both will be among the favorites in the 3000 meters. 
Single told The Associated Press on Wednesday he could not comment on which sports were being investigated. 
"Well, obviously the school's position is to fully disclose the information and we'll cooperate fully with the inves­tigation," he said. "This (investigation) was initiated last summer by us and is just ongoing." 
Single said the NCAA would look at the school's internal report and then decide if it should investigate further. 
SMU basketball Coach Dave Bliss said, "Doug Single speaks for SMU. I can't comment on that." 
SMU track Coach Ted McLaughlin could not be reached for comment by the AP. 

David Berst, the NCAA's director of enforcement con­firmed Tuesday that the NCAA is looking into SMU's report and is working to corroborate the university's findings while developing information from sources outside the private in­vestigation. 
An unidentified source told 
the newspaper, "The most serious problems focused 3:round the track te_am and par-

Special to the Observer 

The Notre Dame women's basketball team won its fourth straight game Wednesday night, breezing past Cleveland State 87-69 on the road. 
Heidi Bunek led the Irish with 28 points, 22 of them com­ing in the first half. Bunek also pulled down a team-high nine rebounds. 
Sandy Botham added 14 points, while Krissi Davis chipped in with 10 (shooting 5­of-5 from the field). Mary Gavin dished off 10 assists, marking the third straight game in which she has had double figures in that category. 
Notre Dame never had any problems with the Vikings, breaking out to a 46-24 halftime lead. The Irish led by as many as 31 points in the second half, as all nine healthy team memembers saw playing time. 
The victory over Cleveland State marked Notre Dame's fourth win in its last five road games. The Irish now stand at 16-6 and next play Marquette, also on the road, Saturday at 5:00p.m.

Tennis 
continued from page 16 
Notre Dame's singles lineup this weekend will include fresh­man CeCe Cahill at the top seed, followed by senior cap­tain Michelle Dasso, sopho­more Alice Lohrer, freshman Kim Pacella, freshman Cathy Bradshaw and sophomore Jackie Uhll. 
The doubles pairs will be Cahill and Dasso, Pacella and· Lohrer and Bradshaw with either Uhll or sophomore Pat O'Byrne. 
Notre Dame will have to rely on a singles lineup that includes three freshmen. But then again, the top two singles records last fall came from freshmen. 
While Cahill posted a 21-1 record as the top seed last fall, Pacella recorded an 11-5 singles record and an 11-4 doubles mark. 
"She (Pacella) has really come a long way," said Gelfman. "She's a team person and has a terrific personality. She has a lot of raw skills and more athletic ability than anyone I've seen." 
Pacella's success in the fall answered several of her own questions, as the Toledo, Ohio, native did not know what to ex­pect coming into college play. 
"In Junior tennis, you knew who you were playing, and you were thinking, 'I have to beat this girl. She beat me last time,"' said Pacella, recalling 
her pre-collegiate competi­tions. "Now, I was just a fresh­man, and nobody knew who I was. I just went out and played because now I didn't know the people I was playing." 
At Notre Dame Academy in Toledo, Pacella never lost a regular season matCh and cap­tained a state championship team her junior_ y~r. But she thought the Junior competitions were more beneficial. 
She started playing competi­tively at the age of 11 and, during her junior year, was ranked 23rd in the Western Tennis Association. 
Her work eventually resulted in her goal of playing collegiate tennis. She didn't have much trouble choosing her college. 
"I've grown up wanting to go here," said Pacella. "My grandparents taught here, my dad went to law school here and my room has Notre Dame stuff all over it. 
"Whenever there was an ar­ticle (about the ND tennis

her," says the third-year Irish coac~. "We're just trying to get her m control, and if we can harness and direct that, she can only get better. 
"I wasn't exactly sure of how she'd handle the pressure of playing in college," Gelfman continued, "but she can remain calm all the time. That's the difference between Kim and a lot of other players."

No miracles this time as USSR holds off USA 


Associated Press 
CALGARY, Alberta-The 
U.S. hockey team ran out of miracles Wednesday night, losing 7-5 to the Soviet Union in their first Winter Olympic meeting since the stunning American victory at the 1980 Lake Placid Games. 
This one fell just short for the United States, which rallied from a 6-2 deficit to 6-5 but couldn't get even, despite out­shooting the high-powered Soviets 12-4 in the final period. 
The loss left the Americans on the brink of elimination from making the medals round, with a 1-2 record and having to beat Norway and West Germany to even have a chance. The defending gold medalist Soviets are now 3-0 and virtually assured a spot in the medals round. 
The top three teams from each of the two pools make the medals round. 
With V aicheslev Fetisov, their all-star defenseman from their main Red Army club, leading the way with two goals and three assists, the Soviets continued the domination of Americans in international play. 
The victory was the sixth in eight meetings with the United States in Olympic play since the Soviets played their first Olympic game in 1956. The only time the Americans have beaten the Soviets in the Olym­pics came in the gold-medal winning years of 1960 and 1980, the last time a dramatic 4-3 vic­tory that was coined the "Miracle on Ice" at Lake Placid, N.Y. 
The Soviets have never lost to the Americans at the World Championships, holding a 22-0 advantage. 
The Soviets looked every bit the team that U.S. coach Dave Peterson called the strongest in the Winter Olympics. 

Fetisov set up Sergei Makarov at 7: 23 and then Alexei Kasatonov at 9:41 to help the Soviets grab a 2-0 lead after one period. 
Fetisov also set up Kasatonov's second goal at 
8: 58 of the second period and later scored himself at 18:46 to give the Soviets a 6-2 lead after 
two periods. Both of Kasatonov's goals and the one by Fetisov came on the power play. 
The Americans made things interesting on Lane Mac­Donald's second goal of the game and one by Scott Fusco in the first six minutes of the third period, but the Soviets held on to improve their chances for the six-team medal round and dampening those of the Americans. 
Fetisov then scored the clincher when he sailed in from the blue line, split the U.S. defense and put a backhander past Chris Terreri with 2: 01 left. 
The Soviets have two games left in the preliminary round, against unbeaten West Ger­many on Friday and third­seeded Czechoslovakia on Sun­day. 
The Soviets needed a clutch performance by goaltender Sergei Mylnikov to hold off the Americans, who charged back with three straight goals in the third period. 
MacDonald scored his second of the game when he tipped in a rebound at 3: 15. Fusco drove one in from the high slot at 5: 47 and Todd Oker­lund knocked in a rebound at 
10:52 to make it 6-5 Soviets. 
The Americans continued to pour it on with their offensive style and really threw a scare into the Soviets at the end, al­most tying it when Brian Leetch hit the post with 7:30 to go. 
Mylnikov wound up making 25 saves in the game. Mter giving up six goals on 24 shots in the first two periods, the Americans allowed only Fetisov's clinching goal in the final 20 minutes, when they got off only four shots. 
The Soviets dominated the 
first two periods, outshooting 
the Americans 24-19. 
They took a 1-0 lead when 
Fetisov fed Makarov at the red 
line and the Soviet forward put 
a backhander past Terreri for 
a 1-0 lead. As they have been
