Bush proposes tax alternative to bill 
WASHINGTON (AP) -On the verge of vetoing a family leave bill for the second time, Presi­dent Bush on Wednesday be­latedly proposed a $500 million tax credit alternative to the Democrats' compulsory ap­proach. 
Bush complained it was "very peculiar and highly political" for the Democrats to wait this late in the election year to re­new the fight over whether businesses should be required to give workers unpaid time off to care for a newborn child or sick relative. 
But Bush, who has positioned the GOP as the defender of fam­ily values, let two years lapse after his last veto of a family leave bill before rushing out his voluntary proposal with the ink still wet. 
"Today, George Bush showed his true colors on family val­ues," Democratic nominee Bill Clinton said in a statement dis­tributed by his campaign. "Given a chance to help work­ing families, he's walked away again." 
"After four years of denying working Americans the right that people in 72 other nations have, Bush offered a last­minute mandate," said Clinton, who strongly supports the Democrats' bill. "His tax credit does nothing to guarantee that workers will have leave or a job if they're allowed to return." 
Bush said the Democrats sat on their own proposal for a year. 
"Unfortunately, they and my opponents believe in a gov­ernment-dictated mandate that increases costs and loses jobs," said Bush, adding, "There's an awful lot of politics at play here." 
The bill passed by Congress would require employers with more than 50 workers to allow employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually to deal with medical emergencies, in-· eluding the birth of a child, 
Students cheered ND walk-on 
By MICHELLE CROUCH News Writer 
With one minute remaining in the Notre Dame*Georgia Tech game in 1975. one stu­dent started chanting "We want Rudy! We want Rudy!" Soon, the whole student section had picked up the chant. 
The Irish were beating Georgia Tech 24-3 with 27 seconds remaining when walk-on Dan "Rudy» Ruettiger entered the game as defensive end. 
Ruettiger played the first two downs of his college career, made one tackle for a five-yard-loss and was

adoption or a sickness in the family. 
Bush's proposal would allow businesses with fewer than 500 workers to write off their taxes up to $20 per day for as many as 60 days of leave a year per worker, or a maximum of $1,200 per employee. 
The White House said Bush would pay for the tax credits by cutting other spending. Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the minority whip, said Bush would propose trimming doctors' and hospitals' lab fees and other administrative costs paid for by the government. 
Bush said at a meeting with GOP leaders that "There's some $60 billion that (the Office of Management and Budget) knows about where we can al­locate to this." 
Rep. Patricia Schroeder. D­Colo., called Bush's proposal "half-baked" and said if Bush knows where $60 billion can be found, he should spend some of it on Head Start, immunization and nutrition programs for poor children. 
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said nine out of 10 workers in big-and medium-sized companies al­ready have family leave plans. 
"The great need is at the lower end," he said, but the Democrats' bill "doesn't apply to companies under 50 people." 
Fitzwater said the White House made overtures before to the Democratic leaders. but "they refused to discuss any­thing that was not mandated." 
The family leave bill passed both chambers with bipartisan support, and Republican back­ers expressed skepticism at Bush's tax-credit proposal. 
Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said she was "somewhat per­plexed" by the timing of Bush's proposal. "It may be an inter­esting supplement, but it is not a substitute for this bill," she said.

Keeling: Thinking will stop spread of AIDS 
By MARA DIVIS News Writer 
Only individual thinking and decision-making will stop the spread of AIDS and other sexu­ally transmitted diseases in a world dominated by media im­ages of consumers' idealism, according to Dr. Richard Keel­ing, director of the Student Health Center at the University ofVirginia. 
Victims of these diseases are guilty of nothing other than growing up in the image-ori­ented world of the 1980's and 1990's, said Keeling, an expert on AIDS awareness and educa­tion. 
Throughout childhood and adolescence, students are con­tinually sent messages to "Just Say No," he said in a lecture at Saint Mary's yesterday. 
Thinking is what students need to do before making deci­sions about behavior, Keeling said. Ads such as Nike's "Just do it," and the "Just say no" campaign encourage this lack of thought. 
"Don't say no, don't say just do it," he said. "(Say) I must decide for myself what I am going to do. I've got to make this work for myself." 
"We tend to model what we see,'' he continued. "Most cul­tures raise their children that way. We don't know what we are." 
Using slides of popular adver­tisements for clothing, fra­grance, athletic shoes, and beauty items to explain how image-oriented media plays on people's low self-concept, Keel­ing said that society and the media raise children to emulate what they see, and the college experience further adds a unique opportunity to be influ­enced by new models. 
"We want to fit in," he said. "We've got a lot of people to watch. Where we once saw our own experience, we now watch

ND '76 football_player to be subject of film shot on campus 
By SARAH DORAN News Writer 
The story of 1976 Notre Dame graduate and football player Daniel "Rudy" Ruettiger will be the subject of a feature film that will be shot entirely on campus later this fall, according to Richard Conklin, associate vice president for University relations. 
The film, "Rudy," "is not a football movie," said Ruettiger. "It is an account of the human spirit, relationships, people having dreams, blue collar life and the dream of a son in a Catholic family of fourteen," he said. 
Ruettinger came up with the idea for the film when he ad­dressed a Notre Dame Club in 1982 and they responded to it by saying that his story should be told to the public, he said. He continued to speak to alumni centers, high schools and or­ganizations that all reiterated the need for the account to be told on a larger basis, he said. 
Through various friends and contacts in the film industry, Reuttinger was able to find a production company, director and screenwriter to put his story on film. The film will be a Tri-Star Pictures production that will be directed by David Anspaugh and written by screen writer Angelo Pizzo, both of whom teamed up for the 1986 hit "Hoosiers," said Reuttinger. 
The actors for the film have not yet been confirmed, but Reuttinger said that Sean Aston had been meP-tioned to play him and that other actors proposed to star in the film may include John Voigt and Ned Beatty. 
The story is an inspirational account, said Reuttinger. It be­gins with his participation in a retreat held at Notre Dame during his senior year in high school. The retreat sparked his love of the University and desire to be a student here. Un­fortunately, he said, he "did not have the grades and was not exactly a prime candidate for admission." 
After high school graduation, Ruettinger worked for a power plant for two years, served in the Navy for two years, and then returned to the power plant for two more years, he said. 
All of this time, he continued to dream of attending Notre Dame and during a visit for a football game, found a way to achieve this dream by attending Holy Cross Junior College, he said. 
Ruettinger applied to Notre Dame twice and was rejected twice before his eventual accep­tance that came upon his grad­uation from Holy Cross, he said. He entered Notre Dame as a junior at the age of 25 and walked on to the football team in 197'"4 under the then Irish coach Ara Parseighian, he said. 
Due to Parseghian's retire­ment after the 1974 season, Ruettinger was forced to again try out for the team for Coach Dan Devine. 
He once again achieved walk on status, but due to a new NCAA rule that season, stating that only a certain amount of players can dress for a home game and, conversely, a certain amount for an away game, Ruettinger had never dressed for a game with only one home game left in the season. But, at Notre Dame all seniors are able to dress for the last game of their senior season. He was almost the exception to this rule, he said. 
Ruettinger was able to dress for the final home game against Georgia Tech. He was put into the game with 27 seconds remaining and made the last tackle of the game, he said. 
"'Rudy'" will be the story of human perseverance," said Ruettinger.

ND family member is back 
The phrase "Notre----------­

It was an event that occurred 34 weeks ago late tonight that defined

News Copy Editor 

the term for many of us..------------­On that night, the bus carrying the women's swim team back to campus after a meet against Northwestern skidded to a premature halt that resulted in the deaths of two freshman swimmers and the serious injury of a third. 
The way that this tragedy brought the University together is unparalleled in any way. As we mourned the loss of the two women and shared the grief of their families and of the team, we rallied around the recovery of Haley Scott, who suffered a grave spinal injury that shattered a portion of her backbone and left her temporarily paralyzed. 
Her story was told by media spanning the country. Scott received letters from Vice President Dan Quayle, from swim teams across the country, from famous actors and musicians, from friends of the University and even from random well-wishers who knew nothing about her other than the gravity of her injury. 
The campus supported her on a large scale by having each student, instructor and administrator sign what may be the largest get well card ever. Individually, visitors came bearing stuffed animals, flowers, food, even daily Yo-Cream taken from the dining hall in a thermos. 
Any injury to the spine is an extremely serious one that, if one is able to recover from it, can often take years. That is what makes Scott's story all the more fantastic. She wiggled her toes the Tuesday after the accident. (The feeling of euphoria in her hospital room at the time was so great that her roommate took still pictures of the moving toes to capture the moment.) 
Scott's spirit gave back to the Notre Dame community tenfold what it had given her in support. Her determination and recovery helped in countless ways to alleviate the grief of the tragic accident. 
Early this summer while most of Scott's peers were engrossed in their summer jobs and relaxation, she underwent two additional surgeries to further correct her injury. Doctors predicted that her recovery would force her to stay at home for the fall semester. But, again Haley pulled an enormous recovery and returned to school last Friday. 
Throughout our lives we will encounter events that call for our support and aid. In the continuing recovery of Haley Scott, the "Notre Dame Family" has provided the means of support that has infinitely contributed to her incredible recovery. 
But, more importantly, her character, attitude, determination and recovery has given the "Notre Dame Family" much more support and recovery than it could ever give her.

City enacts 'domestic partnership' law 
cAMBRIDGE, Mass. -The City Council voted to adopt the state's frrst ordinance broadening the legal definition of families to include gay and lesbian couples. Cambridge is the 19th city in the nation to adopt a "domestic partnership" law that extends some of the legal rights provided married couples to homosexual partners, according to city council member Alice Wolf. The ordinance will take effect in November and allow homo­sexual couples to be considered a family upon registering with the city. Among other things, the law will guarantee homosexual couples visitation rights to hospitals and de­tention centers and provide health care benefits for city employees and their partners. 

Kimg turns down settlement offer 
LOS ANGELES-Rodney King turneo down an offer of $1.25 million from the City Council to settle his police­brutality lawsuit. King had sought $6 million to settle the lawsuit he filed after his videotaped beating by four Los Angeles officers in 1991. The couneil voted on Tuesday to offer King a lump sum of $250,000 and set up a $1 million fund that would pay $75,000 a year for a guaranteed 20 years. City Attorney James Hahn said the value of the offer could exceed $3 million, depending on how long the 27­year-old King lives.. King's lawyer, Steven Lerman, immediately rejected the offer as "indieative of a gross insensitivity" toward King. Lerman said he will prepare his case for trial, which would follow a criminal case brought against the four officers by the U.S. Justice Department. That trial is expected to begin in February. King initially sued for $56 million.

Teen shaves female profile off head 
coLUMBUS, Ind. -Cindy Clark wasn't going to split hairs with school officials when they ordered her 13­year-old stepson to shave the profile of a nude woman off the back of his head. The eighth-grader showed up at Central Middle School this month sporting the haircut, which features an arrow near his neck and at about mid­cranium the female figure that is popular on truck mud flaps. The arrow was plainly visible, but the profile was somewhat obscured by longer locks. Although Jeremy claimed that he showed off his 'do only during lunch period and between classes, school officials said the haircut caused a disturbance. Jeremy was given the op­tion of serving an in-school suspension until his hair grew out or shaving it off.

Britain tries to stabilize the pound 
LONDON (AP) -Britain fran­tically tried to stabilize the weakening pound Wednesday by hiking interest rates, buying large amounts of the currency and suspending its foreign-ex­change links to other European countries. 
Britain's actions intensified a sense that cooperation among the powerful nations of Western Europe is splintering even as they are seeking to forge closer unity. 
That added to the monetary turmoil gripping Europe and spread economic anxiety else­where, including the United States, which already is grap­pling with a stunted economy and an uncertain outlook. 
Capping one of the most con­vulsive and frenetic trading days ever, the Treasury an­nounced late Wednesday it would suspend the pound from the European exchange rate mechanism, which sets maxi­mum fluctuation rates for ma­jor European currencies. 
This means Britain no longer is obligated to use interest rate adjustments to keep the pound within limits specified by agreement with its European trading partners. The move al­lows the pound to reach what­ever level is determined by the global currency market. 
"The new exchange rate will depend on what the market fixes," British Treasury spokesman Richard Evans said. "The market is so volatile, it's impossible to say what that might be now." 
In New York, where fmancial markets were still open at the time of the announcement, the pound continued to plunge. It was quoted at $1.7990 half an hour after the announcement after falling from $1.8695 dur­ing the European trading day. 
Earlier in the day, the Bank of England had announced two sharp increases in its base in­terest rate, first from 10 per­cent to 12 percent. When that failed to lift the pound, the bank raised the rate to 15 percent. 
Amid the announcements Wednesday evening, the bank said it would rescind the second increase, leaving its base rate at 12 percent, still among the highest in the world. 
Interest rates are a key tool countries use to defend the value of their currencies. Higher rates make a currency worth more but they stifle eco­nomic expansion by making it more expensive to borrow. When one country raises rates, it puts pressure on others to do likewise. 
Britain's move was only part of an increasingly chaotic eco­nomic situation in Europe that has unnerved financial markets in recent weeks.

Bosnian Serbs call for a cease-fire 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP)­An assembly of Bosnian Serbs declared their intention to remain in Yugoslavia on Wednesday and called on Bosnia's beleaguered govern­ment to agree to a cease-fire in the embattled republic. 
The Serbs appeared to be staking out a bargaining posi­tion two days before peace talks between Bosnia's Muslims, Serbs and Croats are set to be­gin in Geneva. The Serbs claim to hold two-thirds of Bosnian territory. 
There was no immediate re­sponse from the Muslim-led Bosnian government, which fears the Muslims could be left empty-handed if the republic is divided between Serbs and Croats.

Dustin Stwalley, a Sorin hall sophomore, locates his bundle of freshly cleaned clothes at St. Michael's laundry yesterday. 
The Muslims have a shaky al­liance with the Croats, some of whom have said they wish to unite a chunk of Bosnia with Croatia, another former Yu­goslav republic. 
The United Nations has de­manded the warring parties recognize Bosnia's current borders, but many fighters ap­pear convinced that an eventual settlement of the Balkan war will involve recognition of land seized by combatants. 
Fighting sparked by Bosnia's secession from Yugoslavia in February has already killed more than 10,000 and dis­placed more than 1 million people. 
On Wednesday, government forces dug into new positions in a western Sarajevo suburb in anticipation of another push by Serb forces. 
Sarajevo residents ventured out of their homes despite oc­casional shelling overnight. 
ln related events Wednesday: 
In New York, U.N. diplomats said Russia had agreed not to veto the suspension of Serb-led Yugoslavia. The United States and European Community plan to oust Yugoslavia from the General Assembly and other 
U.N. agencies to punish the Serbs for their involvement in Bosnia's war. 
In Moscow, Yugoslav Premier Milan Panic said Yugoslavia would then reapply for its U.N. seat, and Russian Foreign Min­ister Andrei Kozyrev said he would support the move, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. 
European Community envoy Lord Owen and U.N. represen­tative Cyrus Vance, the former 
U.S. secretary of state, said peace talks scheduled to begin Friday in Geneva would con­tinue regardless of whether Yugoslavia were suspended from the United Nations.

Bad checks, ethical lapses take toll on incumbents 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Bad checks, ethical lapses and other questionable behavior are tak­ing their toll on congressional candidates in a primary season that already has set a record for bounced incumbents. 
Problem checks at the House bank played a significant role in the defeats Tuesday of Reps. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., and Chester Atkins, D-Mass. 
Their losses bring to 19 the number of fallen House incum­bents so far, one more than the record set in 1946. More de­feats are certain in the few re­mammg primaries, with Louisiana's Oct. 3 open primary featuring two incumbent-vs.­incumbent races. 
And even more lawmakers are expected to fall in Nov. 
"It's not a surprise," author Suzanne Garment said of the latest primary results. "Americans have always hated politicians in general and have been quite tolerant of their own representatives." 
"For the past 25 years, noth­ing has come out of Washington but scandal news... People are

starting to view their own representatives as substan­dard." 
A total of 95 House and Sen­ate posts will have new faces come January. 
In addition to the defeated House incumbents, 65 members have decided to retire or seek other office, and two died this past week. Seven senators are stepping down, one lost in the primary and one is deceased. 
Nine-term lawmaker Solarz was weakened by his 743 overdrafts at the now-defunct House bank and a newly drawn district that is predominantly Hispanic. Nydia Velazquez, former secretary of the De­partment of Puerto Rican Community Affairs, stopped Solarz, 33 percent to 27 per­cent. 
The party's nod is tantamount to election in the largely Democratic district.

Mom sues to stop T.V. ads 
JEFFERSONVILLE, Ind. (AP) -A woman has filed a lawsuit to stop four Louisville, Ky. television stations from broadcasting graphic anti-abortion ads sponsored by congressional candidate Michael Bailey. 
Kathryn Copeland ofJeffer­sonville said she is "just a mom. trying to protect her kids'' after she filed the lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court in New Albany on behalf of her 8-year-old soq; Christopher, and 7-year­old daughter. Katie. 
Copeland is asking Judge s. Hug)l Dillin for an immediate injunction against the ads' airings. 
Bailey said his campaign ads are "no different from showing bodies from other atrocities." The lawsuit's claim that the spots are obscene will fail, he said, because they are not sexual in nature.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Clinton's speech ironic at ND 
Dear Editor: 
I can't help but ask-did any­one else see the irony in the content and location of Gover­nor Clinton's speech last Fri­day? 
He cites the U.S. Catholic Bishop's letters on the economy "Economic Justice For All" and "Putting Children First" in order to advocate national poli­cies for parental leave, health care reform and the provision of government subsidized child care centers. 
Yet, the policies he hopes to enact for the national economy are not even applied on this most Catholic of campuses. Faculty and staff lack access to parental leave. 
No on-site child care center exists and according top a recent survey by the Graduate Student Union many married student families do not have health insurance for their spouses or children. 
Will it take the election of a Southern Baptist to the presi­dency of the United States to make the Catholic social policy effective on the Notre Dame campus? 
Reynold F. Nesiba Off-campus Sept. 12, 1992 
Reaction to candidate shows hypocrisy 
Dear Editor: 
Having witnessed the manner in which the University community warmly rolled out the proverbial "red carpet" for the visit of one Mr. Bill Clinton (who is rumored to be some sort of political candidate) this past Friday, I am reminded of a similar campaign visit to this campus by a Mr. George Bush in 1988, which was received by that same University commu­nity (or elements thereoO with a curiously dissimilar reaction. 
At that time, many faculty members, students, and College Democrats (whose objectivity could hardly be doubted, as they were all honorable men and women) vociferously protested Mr. Bush's visit, charging that a 'politically mo­tivated' campaign speech was improper fare for this campus. 
I will never forget the valiant efforts made by those objective, politically tolerant members of the faculty and student body, standing steadfastly by their principles, all in an attempt to prevent and protest Mr. Bush's campaign speech way back in 
DOONESBURY 
1988 (which, alas, so few her may recall.) 
Mr. Clinton's visit, however, has left me perplexed, wonder­ing where those principled lib­eral/left-wing members of our community were last week, ready like Minutemen to once again protest yet another politi­cally motivated campaign speech without regard to the candidate's ideology. 
Of course, I would never insinuate that Notre Dame's liberals use a hypo-critical dou­ble standard regarding political speeches (that are more com­patible with their wise ideol­ogy), since it is well-known that these individuals are all honor­able men and women. 
The very least they could have done for the occasion, to prove their principled objectivity with regard to all political speeches and demonstrate their lack of hospitality to politicians of every stripe, was to invite last year's valedictorian to denounce Bill Clinton as well immediately before his speech. 
That particular young lady felt that allowing George Bush to speak here amounted to a tacit endorsement of his policies. 
Now some people might infer that, since no denunciation of Mr. Clinton was forthcoming on the dais before his speech last week, Notre Dame's heroic liberals have in effect stated that a tacit endorsement of Clinton is OK, while a tacit en­dorsement of Bush is not. 
I must contest such an overly hasty conclusion, since our lib­erals made it clear in both 1988 and prior to last year's gradua­tion that they are opposed to candidate speeches in general on principle alone. 
I refuse to doubt their word, since Notre Dame's liberals once again proved last week (by failing to protest last week's campaign speech) that they are indeed honorable men and women, who "stick to their guns" with no hypocrisy and double standard whatsoever.

Dear Editor: 
I was very interested in see­ing and hearing Gov. Clinton Friday. I got in line at 10:20 
a.m. behind perhaps 150 peo­ple, some of whom had come quite early. By 11:55 the line snaked back and forth in front of Stepan Center, and then all over the basketball courts, but I was right behind the first bend in the line. 
Then the doors were opened. I was so astonished to see the end of the line rushing the doors, and so convinced that Notre Dame students simply did not behave this way, that I tried to follow the line; I was naive. The people at the end of the line got in, including many who had just arrived. 
At 12:55 p.m. the doors were closed. I did not get in, nor did others who had come even earlier. We got to hear the speech over tiny speakers set

up outside. We were very near the front, however, so I retained a little hope I might see Clinton after the speech. 
I was once again mistaken. At 1:50 p.m., the doors opened and 2,100 people poured out-and stood in front of those of us who had waited for so long. I left in disgust, and I was not the only one. 
Stepan personnel who had watched the line all morning seemed to vanish when the doors opened, so they are partly to blame for not keeping order. However, this isn't kindergarten. College students should not need to be told to stay in line and wait their turn. Such selfish and childish be­havior should embarrass the University and the individuals responsible.

Dear Editor: 
As sophomores, we have an interest in the role of those elite few who rule in our class coun­
cil. Actually, this elite few is comprised of no less than sixty­three people. 
We understand the need for a large number of people to manage the limited affairs of our class. Nevertheless, we cannot fathom any need for twenty-three people to plan a social activity. 
Nor can we begin to comprehend why putting together a Class Mass takes the concerted effort of seven intel­ligent individuals. 
We must question the ability of an organization that requires three chiefs of staff to function efficiently. 
We also question a selection process that leads to the ap­pointment of the two room­mates of the president, and three of the roommates of the· vice-president to the class council. 
We can understand the doling out of appointments to close friends, but pork-barreling of this magnitude is entirely inap­propriate. 
We expect our sophomore class council to play an exten­sive role in planning activities, but the officers, by creating this bureaucratic octopus have re­strained their ability to function as an efficient organization. 
While we feel that all the members are dedicated· and competent, these members cannot perform their best working within such a large framework.

Rugby 
continued from page 16 
football is constant action. It's continuous like soccer." 
One of the similarities be­tween rugby and football is in scoring. Rugby's version of a touchdown,,called a try, is worth five points, and a suc­cessful conversion after a try is good for two points. Three points are awarded for a suc­cessful penalty kick. 
Each year CARFU hosts a tournament to decide the rep­resentatives to the Midwestern Tournament. The winner of the Midwest qualifies to advance to the national tournament. 
In the last few years, the Notre Dame team has enjoyed a large measure of success in the CARFU the past two seasons, winning both tournaments by a composite score of 114-13, and finishing third in the Midwestern Tournament last year. 
There are 15 players on the field for each team at any one time, divided into three groups. Eight guys play forward, which places a reliance on big, strong guys, while the quicker guys are backs, of whom there are six. The final spot is manned by the serum-half, who is similar to a midfielder in soccer. 
Reasons for getting involved with the sport vary, and most of the players actually began playing while at Notre Dame. 
"About 95% of the players 
never played in high school," said McNeive. "I was sick of normal sports, and I wanted to play something in college." 
Lyman's reasons were slightly different. 
"I like the camraderie, and going out and knocking people around. Plus, it's a better way to keep in shape than interhall football." 
That camraderie is important for the players, who say they enjoy the social aspect of hanging out with the other players, not only on their team, but with the other teams. 
The Irish competed against the University of Michigan this past weekend, a non-CARFU team. 
The bigger, more expe­rienced Wolverines beat Notre Dame 27-0, but the Irish hope to rebound at Bowling Green this weekend and home against Michigan State next weekend. 
On the weekend of October 3, the Irish will travel to Chicago for the CARFU Tournament. 
Once the fall season is over, the team takes a short break, and then begins preparing for its spring season. 
T~ams that qualify for Nationals this fall have the spring to prepare for those championships. 
So the next nice fall weekend the rugby team is home, wan­der on over and see how the sport that spawned football is played. And take in a game that is enjoyable in its own right, not just for its more famous cousin.

Bulls, Heat help hurricane victims 
MIAMI (AP) -The Chicago Bulls will play the Miami Heat in an exhibition game on Oct. 19 to raise money for the rebuilding of hurricane­devastated South Florida. 
Proceeds from the benefit game, which the teams hope will raise $500,000, will go to the coalition We Will Rebuild, Heat managing partner Lewis Schaffel said Wednesday. 
"Having this game is the best and most immediate way we know to help those who were affected by this tragic storm," Schaffel said. "This is some­thing we feel good about.... 
This is something we believe we must do." 
Schaffel said the idea to help victims of Hurricane Andrew stemmed from an offer of help from the Bulls' Michael Jordan. Schaffel said Jordan had ap­proached Heat partner Billy Cunningham at a North Carolina golf outing days after the storm struck and asked, "What can I do?" 
The league and the NBA Players Association had to ap­prove the game at the Miami Arena since the Bulls already had the maximum eight exhibi­tion games allowed, Schaffel said. 
"The Heat, the Bulls and the players' associ;~.tion were very much aware that by simply playing one extra game, they could do a world of good," NBA commissioner David Stern said in a statement. 
Chicago Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said contributing to the hurricane relief effort is his team's way of giving something back to fans. 
About 700 floor seats will be set aside for school children from the areas hit hardest by the hurricane. 
White finally comes into own for Oilers 
HOUSTON (AP) -With a 6­foot-1, 222-pound frame held up by size 13-EEE feet, running back Lorenzo White looks out of place in a lineup of Houston Oilers receivers. 
Looks can be deceiving. 
"He's tremendous in the open field," quarterback Warren Moon said. "You wouldn't think he could move the way he does, but he has quick feet and can break the long one." 
White did just that in Sunday's 20-10 victory over Indianapolis, catching four passes for 106 yards, one a screen pass that he turned into a 69-yard touchdown play. 
"He not only catches the ball, he makes people miss after the catch," Moon said. "I said be­fore the season I wanted to get him the ball, and that's what we've been doing." 
After four years of struggling for status with the Oilers, White finally feels he's becoming an all-around running back. 
In two games, White has rushed 30 times for 169 yards and he's caught seven passes for 130 yards. His 69-yard touchdown is his longest catch and he had a 44-yard run against Pittsburgh. 
Catching passes isn't a sud­den phenomenon for White. He caught 39 in 1990 and 27 last year in 13 games. 
"People always said, 'I didn't know you could catch the ball,~ White said. "That's because I never had to catch the ball be­fore. But I can do it." 
He likes his new role. 
"You have to be a complete running back," White said. "That's the title that I like, be­ing able to do it all. But, cri­tiquing myself, it was just an OK game. I blew a lot of as­signments or I would have caught the ball more." 
White started the season campaigning for more running time. Little did he realize that his receiving would help his running. 
"As far as running, I felt good," White said. "Once we started screening and catching those balls, their defense couldn't use those linebackers to come down and blitz like they did. 
"It helped me get open in the field, and we've got linemen and receivers that can run down the field with you." 
Coach Jack Pardee hopes to use White's full range of talents Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs (2-0) in the Astrodome. 
"This is more of a middle screen instead of a side screen," Pardee said. "Lorenzo is getting away from the spy that's looking for him. That's the big difference. 
"It also helps slow down the rush. That's what you need a screen for, to slow it down. They were doing some stuff that was hard to pick out."

McDonald surprise starter 
CINCINNATI (AP) -Rookie inside linebacker Ricardo McDonald, brother of Notre Dame linebacker -Devon McDonald, is to start for the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday at Green Bay because a knee injury may have cost veteran Ray Bentley the rest of his sea­son. 
McDonald, a fourth-round draft choice from the University of Pittsburgh, took over in the first quarter of Sunday's 24-21 victory over the Los Angeles Raiders after Bentley suffered torn ligaments in his left knee defending against a running play. 
McDonald contributed eight tackles, tying for the team high, and one tipped pass as the Bengals limited the Raiders to 87 yards rushing. The Bengals are now unbeaten in two games. 
Coach Dave Shula said the loss of Bentley. signed as a free agent after six years with Buffalo, will hurt. Bentley had called signals for the defense, a job that now falls to linebacker Kevin Walker. But McDonald is regarded as a promising player. 
"We feel that Rico has a real bright future as a linebacker in this league for many years to come," Shula said. "His education will now o full force. as far as on-the-field, on-the-job training." 
On Tuesday, the Bengals re­placed Bentley on the roster by signing former New York Giants linebacker Gary Reasons. The 6-foot-4, 235­pound Reasons played eight seasons with the Giants, including the 1986 and 1990 Super Bowl champions. He lost his starting job in the Giants' preseason this year to Steve DeOssie, then strained a knee ligament and was released on an injury settlement. That meant the Giants could not sign him for four weeks, and he was free to sign with any other team. 
Reasons said he is glad to be with the Bengals, who have overhauled their defense under Shula and defensive coordinator Ron Lynn. 
"I think they thought my knee was worse than it was," Reasons said of the Giants. ''I'm healthy. I'm ready to play. 
"This is a good opportunity," he said. "It's a team with a new defense that's doing well. I'm excited." 
Also with the Bengals is cornerback Mitchell Price, who missed the preseason and the season's first two games be­cause of a contract holdout. He was paid $90,000 last year as a punt returner and backup cornerback.

Lanza no longer worries about making the team. He will probably take the spring semester off to play with the Under-Twenty National Team at a March tournament in Australia. When asked to predict this season, Lanza sports the smile of someone 
getting to quarterback Kirk Herbstreit. That's why he is happy the Buckeyes will be on the road Saturday, playing No. 8 Syracuse. "It's unfortunate you're in your own stadium and you're getting booed," Herbstreit said this week. "I don't know if they're booing me or if they're booing the offense or if they're booing coach (John) Cooper. "I'm actually looking forward to getting on the road and getting away from our crowd." Ohio State, No. 21 in the rankings, has won both of its games, both before crowds in excess of 89,000 at Ohio Sta­dium. Despite being favored by 17 points, the Buckeyes survived a 20-19 scare against Louisville in the opener. The outcome was not sealed until the Cardinals, 2-9 a year ago, threw an incomplete pass on a two-point conversion with 33 seconds left. Then, last Saturday, Ohio State struggled before beating in­state rival Bowling Green 17-6. 
For the second game in a row, the Buckeyes were outgained in total offense. Herbstreit suffeped a sprained ankle on the first series against returned to help the Buckeyes overcome a 6-0 second-quarter deficit. Herbstreit, who was on crutches Monday and used a cane Tuesday, expects to play Saturday against Syracuse, which beat Ohio State 24-17 in the Hall of Fame Bowl on New Year's Day.

Expansion teams long On history, · 
sh0 rt on WinS 
The Florida Marlins and Colorado Rockies will cast their fortunes exactly two months from today in the Major League expansion draft on November 17. 
The last expansion draft occurred in 1977. Fifteen years later, the two American League expansion teams are headed in opposite directions. 
The Toronto Blue Jays cast their seed on. fallow ground, opting to build for the future-"Rome was not built in a day." The Blue Jays invested in young, inexpensive talent and cultivated it with the best scouts and coaches. Players like Tony Fernandez, Fred McGriff and Dave Stieb are but a few of bumper crops from Toronto's system. 
Toronto has hovered atop the standings for the past six years. With a winner, they invested in the ultra­modern Sky Dome, which draws the league's most fans partly because of its spectacle-the retractable dome, the huge scoreboard, bar and hotel. But even after the thrill wears off, Sky Dome will continue to draw crowds because the Blue Jays built a strong team foundation. 
The Seattle Mariners, by contrast, cast their seed on fallow ground, opting to sign expensive free agents and washed out veterans. Familiar names like Richie Zisk and Gaylord Perry couldn't cut the mustard. 
Last season, the M's finally avoided a losing season, but this season returned to familiar territory-dead last. To rescue themselves from financial dis­aster, the owners may evacuate the Kingdome. But any city wanting a disastrous major league franchise like the Mariners would be better off getting something else, say, locusts. 
This year's expansion draft puts the weight of the world on the shoulders of Marlins' general manager Dave Dom­browski and Rockies GM Bob Gebhard, their scouts and advisors. The owners, the cities of Miami and Denver, the fans, and baseball as an institution will hinge on the decisions of these men. 
Let's review the complex procedure in this year's draft: 
It 
lasts three rounds, with each expansion team picking a total of 36 players. 

The 
existing 26 teams protect 15 players. 

Players 
with no-trade clauses in their contract, and players with at least ten years major league experience in­cluding five with their current team, can refuse to be drafted. 

Minor 
league players under age 22 cannot be selected. 


In each of the first two rounds, each of the 26 teams lose one player. 

After 
the first round, each team protects four additional players. 


While existing Major League teams face the possibility of losing two or three minor-impact players, expansion teams confront their ultimate fate. 
Will the Rockies and Marlins fill their rosters with marginal major league cast-offs or with minor leaguers with a potential for greatness? The answer is blowing in the wind.

The Saint Mary's soccer team has found both qualities in The two are beginning their third year together, and if the senior forward Stacy Winget and junior forward Megan Dal­last two years are any indication of what the Belles can expect, saso. it should be a successful season. 
"They feed off of one another and encourage quality play. "We don't have to talk anymore. She knows I'll be there and I know she'll be there," Dalsaso. "This is good because if you talk too much on offense, the defenders can take advantage of that." 
"I know where she is at all times. I am confident in giving her the ball," Winget agreed. 
Last year, Stacey scored one less goal and had one less assist than Megan. Both, however, are in the top three of the all-time Saint Mary's scoring list. According to coach VanMeter they are "the best 1-2 scoring combination I've had at Saint Mary's." 
According to Dalsaso, the equality of talent helps to push them. "You always have something to pace yourself with. Stacey is that for me. It never becomes anything personal though." 
Both players realize the importance of each member of the team. "As captain (along with senior Kristen Crowley and Dalsaso), I want to push each player to accel so that the team can do its best," Winget said. 
Dalsaso added,"I would like to see more players involved in the scoring, that way all feel more a part of the action." 
The Belles will be turning to the duo as they work toward a bid for nationals. Last year they were ranked ninteenth in the nation, but failed to get a bid after their final game was can­celled due to snow. 
This year the tournament has been expanded to twenty spots, with two hundred teams competing. 
The Belles only have fourteen games this year, which is fewer than most schools, so there is more pressure to win each and every one. 
In order to do this, the team must stay focused on goals. "We need to be more intense and take things more seriously,"
