ANKARA, Turkey (APJ-U.S., 
British and French aircraft on 
Sunday dropped tons of 
supplies to Iraqi refugees on 
the Turkish and Iranian bor­
ders, and the first U.S. troops 
reached a remote refugee camp 
to aid in the relief effort. 
In northern Iraq. Kurdish 
mbel leaders said their fighters 
turned back another attempt 
Sunday by Iraqi troops to push 
into the rebel-held mountains. 
They said the Iraqis were 
trying to cut off escape routes 
for the refugees. 
About 500,000 refugees, mostly Kurds. have fled north­ern Iraq to the rugged, moun­tainous Turkish border and another 900,000 have sought refuge in Iran, officials in both countries say. 
The Kurds fear the wrath of 
Saddam Hussein following their 
failed rebtlllion that began after 
his army was routed by the al­
lies in the Persian Gulf War. In 
the mountains. the refugees 
have faced hunger, disease and 
death. 
Saddam has insisted innocent 
civilians have nothing to fear 
from his troops, and urged 
Kurds to return to their homes. 
Iraqi radio reported Sunday 
that Saddam made the assur­
ances a day earlier during a 
visit to northern Iraq.

Deickmann awarded fellowship 
By JOSEPH ADAMS 
News Writer 
Mt~lissa Deickmann, a gradu­ate student in the department of eivil engineering, has been named a National Science Foundation fellow. 
Dieckmann. who is studying for a Ph.D. in environmental engineering, will receive a $14,000 stipend for research. She said that her project is "the photodegradation of aromatic pollutants using radiation and semiconducting surfaces." 
In addition to her fellowship, Dieckmann recently won first prize in an competition spon­sored by the Environmental Engineering Division of the American Society of Civil Engineers. 
Dieckmann said that the contest required the submission of an "essay written on some technical or non-technical" aspect of environmental engi­neering. She will present her papt~r. "An Analysis of Modeling Teehniques in Pollution Management of Natural Water Systnms," at the organization's annual meeting next July in Reno, Nevada. 
Dieckmann is in her first ytmr of graduate study at Notre Dame. She said that after she obtains her doctorate, she will pursue a career in teaching.

GENOA, Italy (AP) -Rocked by one last explosion, a fire­ravaged tanker holding millions of gallons of oil sank Sunday ofT the Italian Riviera, and .experts worked to avert an ecological catastrophe in the Mediterranean. 
The Cypriot-registered tanker Haven appeared to have remained intact on the sandy sea bottom 1 1/2 miles ofT the Italian shore and it was believed most of the vessel's crude remained inside, officials said. 
However, patches of oil washed ashore on several stretches of beach along a 15­mile swath of the resort coast west of Genoa, and currents moved other slicks that one official described as "leopard spots" on the sea. 
The officials said no further oil spills had surfaced by late Sunday, but that they were waiting for a better assessment from footage taken by underwater robots deployed around the wreck. 
The Haven exploded Thursday, starting a fire that spewed black, thick smoke for 
four days. Three more explosions rocked the sea on

north of the line. 

The number of American troops involved in the effort to aid the refugees increased Sunday when 3,500 members of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit arrived at the Turkish port of lskenderun. That brought the number of 
U.S. military personnel involved in the operation to about 8,000, said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Philip Crowley. 
Crowley, a spokesman for the U.S.-Turkish lncirlik air base ­which is coordinating relief efforts -said the troops ar­rived with 16 heavy-lift heli­copters. 
Also, American soldiers ar­rived at Turkey's refugee camp of lsikveren, the first U.S. troops to arrive at any camp in the area. Crowley said they would assess refugee needs and teach them to put up shelters and provide first aid. 
The Isikveren camp lies in an almost inaccessible part of Turkey, on the western part of the Turkish border with Iraq. It is the largest single settlement, with more than 100,000 refugees. 
To the east, refugees trekking to Iran found equally arduous conditions. Snow is piled thick beside the road, and tempera­tures plunge below freezing at night. 
AP correspondent John Pomfret, with refugees in east­ern Iraq, said the acute short-

Tanker explodes and sinks off Riviera coast 
A joint statement issued by the ministers of civil defense and environment said the damage was "containable." 
"Now we have to cross our 
fingers and hope that the crude 
still inside the tanker does not 
come out," they said. 
The tanker had held nearly 42 million gallons of Iranian crude. A Genoa port authority official, giving "an extremely rough" estimate, said perhaps 15 million gallons of that had burned up in the fires. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. 
The tanker went down in waters about 240 feet deep ofT the resort town of Arenzano, 16 miles from Genoa. 
As the tanker sank, there was worry it would cause the Mediterranean's worst environmental disaster. 
Greenpeace, the international environmental organization, surveyed the area with a helicopter and said oil from the ship could be seen in spots in a 40-square-mile area. 
"We are afraid of a black summer," said Giandomenico Olivieri, a tourist official in Celie Ligure, where the beach was spotted with tar.

courtesy of Public Marketing Associates. 
The unfortunate situation developed last summer when a young lady representing Public Marketing Associates came to my door 
soliciting magazine subscriptions. 
I thought a subscription would be a great way to get mail at least once a week while having some casual reading to put on the coffee table. 
After informing me that it would take 60 to 90 days for the subscription to begin, I obliged the solicitor and wrote her a check for 
her services. I anxiously awaited the arrival of my first issue. And today, over ten months later, I am still waiting. 
When I returned to school, each daily run to the mailbox resulted in utter disappointment as I reached in to touch the cold steel walls and nothing else. 
After five months of waiting, I suspected a problem. I phoned the company, who in­formed me of a nling mistake saying, "Your 
subscription will start within four weeks." After more disappointing mailbox runs, I called again. An operator assured my sub­scription would soon commence. 
When December passed, I'd had enough. I phoned the Public Marketing Associates and requested a refund. I was informed that a 
written request was necessary. So I wrote. Instead of a refund, I received a form saying "your subscription was misentered. The situation will be rectified." 
They offered me another subscription in compensation for the inconvenience. I could choose from a list offering such male favorites 
as McCalls and Savvy . 
I couldn't believe it; this firm couldn't correctly process one subscription in over ten months, what would lead me to think that I would receive my favorite women's magazine in addition to my first nonexistent 
subscription in "just four short weeks.n 
I have since written and called several times. Apparently, I haven't been speaking the same language as the "friendly operators". 
Their only reply has been "No sir, no refund". They also referred me to a manager to whom two letters generated no response. I question the manager's existence since she is always "not in today" when I make my routine call. All I want is a refund. I learned a lesson about using well-known and respected ftrms when doing business. I 
hope others learn from my mistake. And I still haven't received anything.

Brazilians denounce government 
.RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil -Brazil's most prominent political activists have joined for the ftrst time to denounce the government, saying it has failed to end violence against children and the poor and enact land reforms. The killings of children are allegedly carried out by death squads, police and security guards paid by shopowners seeking to prevent thefts and assaults. Currently, about 2 percent of farmers own about half all arable land while an estimated 15 million landless peasants struggle to survive. President Fernando Collor de Mello promised to implement a major agrarian reform program when he took office last year, but little changes have been made. 
Clock Fetches $500,000 At Auction 
GENEVA, Switzerland-A small travel clock used by Napoleon during his Egyptian military campaign fetched a record $509,000 at an auction of historic timepieces Sunday, auctioneers said. Clocks and watches once owned by King George IV of England, Queen Marie Christine of Spain and by the late virtuoso Arthur Rubinstein were among items sold by Geneva's Habsburg auctioneers. The clocks and watches were made by a Swiss company founded 200 years ago by Abraham Louis Breguet, who invented the self-winding watch, the anti-shock system and other pioneering features of watch production. The gilt-bronze clock sold in less than two minutes of bidding, but the auction house would not disclose the buyer.

Fame is a goldmine for Holliday 
LOS ANGELES, Ca -The plumbing supply manager who videotaped police officers beating a black motorist has acquired a lawyer, a manager and a Beverly Hills agent to help him mine his involuntary celebrity. Holliday earned $500 when he sold his videotape of the March 3 beating in suburban Lake View Terrace to a television station. Since then, a Japanese TV reporter paid Holliday $1,000 for an interview and Geraldo Rivera gave him $600 for appearing on his talk show. Also being considered are a contribution by Holliday to a book on the Los Angeles Police Department, a television movie and a TV series about citizen crime-busters, and a "Crimebuster" toy with the "George Holliday Crimebuster Badge" and a camera. 

Eliminating heart disease 
BOSTON, Ma. -If scientists achieved the impossible goal of eliminating all heart disease, the victory would add just three years to the average American's life span, a study concludes. Heart disease, which kills 500,000 Americans annually, is the country's leading cause of death. The researchers said that while the gain in longevity from eliminating heart disease may seem surprisingly small, their finding reflects the difficulty of pushing back the boundaries of old age. Even if people escape the No. 1 killer, a host of other ailments are likely to quickly take its place as people reach their 80s and beyond.

New cheerleading squad selected for Notre Dame 
By PAUL PEARSON Associate News Editor 
After two days of backflips and handstands. the 1991-92 Notre Dame cheerleading squad was announced Saturday night. 
Dan Wagner was selected to be the leprechaun for the 1991-92 year. Wagner beat out four other candidates for the position. 
The women's squad consists of Cheryl Cihak, Jessica Chiappetta, Betsy Ciarimboli, Jenny Finn, Mary Malone, Angie Jones and Laura Garza, all NO students. Dana BeiTrondo, a Saint Mary's student, will serve as the al­ternate. 
The men's squad consists of Tyler Moore, Matt Raulston, Mike Trainor, Tim Trainor, John Stavrakos, Diego Miron and Ryan Roberts. Clement Yoo will serve as the alter­nate. 
According to Tad Majerak, husband of cheerleading coach Maria Majerak, the cheerleaders prepared for the· tryouts for six weeks. The tryout sessions took place Friday and Saturday and were judged by a six-judge panel, which included Maria Majerak. 

Mr. Majerak said the cheer­leaders were judged based on personal interviews, required skills, optional routines, and performance of a "hell dance" which the candidates learned one night before the tryouts. The leprechaun candidates were judged on improvisation skills and performance of an optional routine. 
Thirty-nine women and 13 men tried out for the 16 cheerleader positions. All re­turning cheerleaders were re­quired to try out again. 
The captains for next year's squad have not been chosen. Mr. Majerak said the captains will probably be selected next week. 
According to Mr. Majerak, the new cheerleaders will get the next week off, but will then practice for five days straight to prepare for the annual Blue-Gold Game April 27.

Alexander announces school plan 
WASHINGTON (AP) -After barely a month on the job, Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander has gotten President Bush's backing for a far­reaching package of reforms that include national student tests and experiments with radically new ways of running schools. 
Bush, who pledged during his 1988 campaign to be the "education president," will un­veil the school reform package at the White House on Thursday after a luncheon with governors, an administration official said Sunday. 
The fast-track initiative will embrace some of the same edu­cation themes that Bush and former President Reagan have sounded before: expanding parental choice in education and improving literacy and job training programs for dropouts, displaced workers and other adults. 
Hut it will also put Hush's stamp -and Alexander's -on some radically new ideas. in­cluding pressing ahead to de­velop a type of national student testing program, as a presiden­tial advisory panel recently rec­ommended. 
Alexander is a former gover­nor of Tennessee who was president of the University of Tennessee when Bush nomi­nated him Dec. 17 to succeed Lauro Cavazos. 
He wou Bush's backing for his reform ideas within days of his March 18 swearing-in, said chief Education Department spokeswoman Etta Fielek. 
Alexander has cleaned house at the Education Department and lured David Kearns, a former chairman of Xerox Corp., as his deputy secretary. 
The reform package is still evolving, Fielek said.

Police recover 20 van Goghs after art theft 

AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -Two armed robbers stole 20 paintings by Vincent van Gogh on Sunday in the Netherlands' priciest art theft but abandoned the works less than an hour later outside a railway station, police said. 
The haul from the Vincent van Gogh National Museum, which included the final version of his masterpiece "The Potato Eaters," was worth "hundreds of millions" of dollars, police spokesman Klaas Wilting said. 
"Still Life With Sunflowers" and "Still life With Irises" were among the other paintings. They are both part of separate series the Dutch painter did on flowers before his suicide in 1890, and other paintings in those series have broken art

FDA links breast implants to cancer risk 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Food and Drug Administration is studying a possible link be­tween a commonly used cos­metic breast implant and a cancer-causing agent, an FDA spokeswoman said Sunday. 
The implant is made by Surgitek, a subsidiary of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., and is marketed under the trade names Meme and Replicon. 
The New York Times, in its Sunday editions, quoted un­named scientists familiar with the experiments as saying pre­liminary calculations indicated the implant might cause cancer at the rate of 200 to 400 cases a year for every million women in whom it is inserted. 
Karen Garoukian Ferraro, a spokeswoman for the company in Racine, Wis., said Surgitek

age of supplies has forced the refugees to share everything. On one rock, seven men huddled under one blanket. Nearby, a cup of water was passed around a family of eight, he said. 
At another mountain camp, Uzumlu, reporters said Turkish soldiers were now allowing refugees to drive about 20 miles into Turkey with trucks and tractors to pick up relief supplies. That was a departure from previous Turkish practice. 
The airdrops are crucial for inaccessible mountainous ar­eas, but the falling packages ­which weigh more than a ton -can be a threat to the refugees below. 
At the Uzumlu settlement, desperate refugees braved a minefield to pick up crates dropped from three U.S. trans­port planes. No one was hurt. But crates dropped from a fourth plane later hit a rocky outcropping and their contents spilled down the hill, setting off a series of explosions. 
A day earlier, a woman and a child were killed by a crate that fell among the ragtag tent set­tlement in the muddy valley and surrounding hills. "It hit my wife on the temple and blood gushed out of her nose," wept the dead woman's husband. 
Crowley said any deaths or injuries associated with the re­lief effort were "very unfortu­had done its own studies and believes that its product is safe. 
The product consists of silicon coated with a polyurethane foam to avert development of painful and unsightly lumps. 
Susan Cruzan said she had been told results of a laboratory study were expected to be available within a week or two. 
Cruzan said the FDA study concerned the potential breakdown of the coating to a chemical known as 2-toluene, or TDA, which causes liver cancer in rats and other re­search animals. 
"The FDA has conducted the laboratory study and it is ana­lyzing the results of the break­down of the polyurethane to TDA," she said. "There are not any results from that study yet." 
time we know that we're saving thousands of lives with the blankets, clothing, food and water we're dropping." 
At Incirlik, American, British and French transport planes were taking off for the border at the rate of three every 30 minutes, Crowley said. Each aircraft carried 32 tons of aid. 
Even with the stepped-up ef­fort, the British Red Cross said the situation in the region was heard a noise and was con­fronted by a pistol-wielding man wearing a ski mask, police said. 
Police assume the gunman hid in the museum after it closed Saturday. 
The robber ordered the guard to turn off the museum's in­frared alarm system and. then open the front entrance to admit a second man, the police said. One of the guards was locked in a room, and the other was held at gunpoint, police told a news conference. 
The robbers spent two hours packing the paintings in the garment bags and then fled. 
Wagenaar said the gunmen spoke English and sounded like they were American. 
Van Leeuwen said the three ripped paintings were probably damaged when they were stacked and stuffed into the bags used by the the bandits. 
The damaged works were: "Still Life with Bible," painted in 1885; "Still Life With Lemons, Pears and Grapes," painted in 1887; and "Wheatfields." 
The museum director said the other 17 paintings were not se­riously damaged, but some had canvas tears. 
"The Potato Eaters," Van Gogh's poignant 1885 depiction of 19th century rural poverty in the Netherlands, was one of the museum's most valuable hold­ings. 
The robbery was the latest in a series of thefts at the nation's extensive network of museums. 
The government-operated museum does not insure its art holdings because of the price­less value of the Dutch art her­itage, which includes tens of thousands of works. 
Van Goghs have commanded record-setting prices at art auctions around the world in recent years. 
Ferraro said that Surgitek scientists, after examining dis­solution of the coating in a lab­oratory setting, had concluded dissolution of the polyurethane was minimal. 
On April 10, the FDA gave makers of silicone breast im­plants 90 days to prove that they are safe or to stop selling them. 
Breast implants were on the market in 1976, when Congress gave the FDA authority to regu­late them, and were "grandfathered" into the mar­ket. 
In 1988, the agency classified them as among the most strin­gently regulated medical de­vices, giving it authority to ask for evidence of their safety after a 30-month waiting period. 

miles away. There were no ar­rests. 
"If you look at the way it was done, you would presume it was well planned, but if you look at the outcome, it looks like pure amateurish," said a police spokesman, Foeke Wagenaar. 
Three of the paintings were seriously ripped, said Ronald van Leeuwen, director of the museum, which claims to have the largest and most vari6d collection of the 19th century impressionist's work. 
One of the damaged works was the vivid, haunting "Wheatfields With Crows," which Van Gogh painted in the French town of Auvers-sur-Oise about a month before his sui­cide. 
The holdup began at 3 a.m., when one of two night guards 
"horrific" and appealed for funds to support the relief ef­fort. 
Turkey has provided tons of aid to the refugees on its bor­der, but it is demanding inter­national help. NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner agreed Sunday that caring for the refugees on the Turkish and Iranian borders was "a prob­lem of the international com­munity."

"The Kennedys have deep pockets and long arms -and they are doing everything they can to get out of this," said a local bar employee who has been dogged by Kennedy inves­tigators. "They haven't left me alone and I'm only talking to them to get them off my back." 
The employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity, works at the Safari & Polo Club, a small bar with a jungle motif where the woman and her friends were known to visit. 
lie said late Saturday that the woman was in the bar the night of March 29 and the Kennedy investigators were interested in how much she drank before the alleged attack early March 30. 
"That's where they seemed to be leading," he said. "She had something to drink, but she didn't leave here drunk." 
The woman's attorney, David Roth, sharply criticized the three private detectives Friday, accusing them of witness-tam­pering and obstruction of jus­tice. 
Mark Schnapp, attorney for suspect William Kennedy Smith, the 30-year-old nephew of Sen. Ted Kennedy, says the investigators are just doing their jobs. 
"There's been no intimidation 
or any attempt to intimidate 
any witness in the case, at least 
by our investigators," Schnapp 
said. 

Smith has denied wrongdoing in the alleged assault. No charges have been filed. 
The lead Kennedy investiga­tor is Tom Myers, a former FBI investigator for 21 years, who says he is "simply out to get the truth." 
Smith, a Georgetown University medical student, says the woman's claims she was raped are a lie and force was never used. She responded through Roth Friday that her claims· are true and denounced Smith's statement. 
At the Au Bar, the expensive nightclub where Smith, his un­cle and cousin Patrick Kennedy met the woman the night of March 29, police investigators have been asking how much the woman had to drink. 
"The first people they talked to were my valets," said Au Bar manager Stuart Liechenstein. "They wanted to know what kind of shape she was in when she got here and how she looked when she left." 
Liechenstein. who did not comment on her condition that night, said he was not aware of Kennedy investigators being at his club, although they report­edly have talked to anyone who might have information. 
He hasn't minded the atten­tion. 
People crowded into Au Bar on Saturday night to dine on $30 entrees in the subdued, elegant atmosphere. 
"This was supposed to be our last night before we closed for the season," Liechenstein said over blaring dance music. "But now we're staying open for an­other two weeks. This has been great for us." 
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) ­The final withdrawal of American combat troops from southern Iraq began Sunday, 88 days after the United States launched its massive offensive to drive Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait. 
American troop strength in the region -which had peaked at more than half a million ­has now dropped below 300,000, the military said Sunday. 
U.S. officers said the pullout officially ends the occupation of southern Iraq, but that American warplanes will re­main in the air to protect the withdrawing ground troops. They spoke on condition of anonymity. 
The officers estimated there were at least 40,000 American troops, perhaps more, in southern Iraq, but they could not give a precise figure. 
They said a division-sized force of 10,000 to 15,000 troops would temporarily remain in the newly established demilitarized zone until a 1,440-member U.N. peacekeep­ing force is in place. 
All of the other U.S. troops will return home as soon as possible, the U.S. officers said. 
The zone reaches six miles into Iraq from the Kuwaiti border, but U.S. officers said this is a technical point and that the troop movement essentially will end the U.S. occupation of Iraqi territory. 
The move back to the demili­tarized zone will be completed within a few days, they said. 
The U.S. military also said the United States and its allies would not abandon more than 40,000 refugees in southern Iraq, many of whom oppose Saddam Hussein. It said the al­lies would protect them from reprisals and feed and house them. 
The command issued an invi­tation to any refugees in the area occupied by the Americans to move with them into the demilitarized zone. If they do, "they will be provided assis­tance and protection by coali­tion forces," the Central Command said. 
Military sources said President Bush issued the with­drawal orders to hasten the American pullout to avoid being dragged into Iraqi's civil war for a prolonged period and risk further American casualties.

Shamir says he has conflicting reports on Baker's Mid-East trip 

JERUSALEM (AP) -Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leav­ing Israel on Sunday for a frrst­ever meeting with his Soviet counterpart, said he had mixed feelings about U.S. efforts to bring peace to the Middle East. 
Speaking to reporters at Ben Gurion International Airport before flying to London, Shamir also said Secretary of State James A. Baker III's stepped-up Middle East diplomacy "proves that there is something in it, something to talk about." 
Shamir said he did not have a full report on Baker's talks with Egyptian, Syrian, Saudi and Jordanian officials during Baker's tour of the region last week. 
But from what he had heard, Shamir said, "There are posi­tive things and less positive things; there are things that are agreed and things that are not agreed." He would not give any details. 
Shamir left for London a short time later. In the British capital, he is to meet with Soviet Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov. He said he would ask Moscow to renew full diplomatic ties with Israel as a condition for involvement in Middle East peace talks. 
Baker is expected back in the Middle East in about two weeks. Shamir said he had the impression that the U.S. official felt there were possibilities "and the need not to relax what is called momentum." 
An Israeli newspaper on Sunday quoted Shamir as say­ing he envisions Palestinian

NOTICE TO MEMBERS OF 
NOTRE DAME FEDERAL CREDIT UNION 
As part of an audit of Notre Dame Federal Cred~ 
 Union as of March 3 t , 1991 , the Supervisory Committee has recently distributed statements to 
all members. If you did not receive your statement or if the balances do not agree with 
self-government in the occupied territories, with Arab ministers for education, justice, health and trade. 
Security and foreign affairs would remain under Israeli control, he told the daily AI Hamishmar. 
Shamir confirmed to re­porters that these powers were being offered to the Palestinians, and noted they are part of the 1978 Camp David Accords on which the Egyptian­Israeli peace was founded. 
He also appeared to be re­newing elements of Israel's 1989 peace plan. That proposal called for elections and interim autonomy for the 1. 7 million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip be­fore negotiating the rmal status of the lands. 
Shamir spent two days dis­cussing that peace plan with Baker, who visited Jerusalem last week. The Palestinians op­pose autonomy as a permanent arrangement, but would accept it if it was a temporary step toward full Palestinian sovereignty in the West Bank and Gaza. 
Baker is seeking Arab agree­ment to participat~ in a peace conference. Israel sees it as a brief one-time event involving Arab governments, to be fol­lowed immediately by separate, direct negotiations between Israel and each Arab state. 
On another matter, Shamir played down Housing Minister Ariel Sharon's promises to step up Jewish settlement building in the occupied territories.

He said Sharon was doing nothing without government approval and added, "There is more publicity here than facts." 
Construction in the occupied lands "continues all the time, it is natural. There is life there, so there is development," Shamir said. 
Asked if he was aware of all Sharon's settlement plans, Shamir replied, "I don't have to go into details -if you are constructing one house or two houses it doesn't require special permission of the government and it does not have to come to my knowledge." 
Led by Sharon, Cabinet critics claim Israel's peace proposals will bring pressure for territo­rial concessions. 
Sharon has also accused Shamir of making decisions without consulting with his ministers, but the housing min­ister is not believed to represent the majority view of the 20-man Cabinet. 
Foreign Minister David Levy on Sunday rebuked hard-line Cabinet colleagues for portray­ing Israel's peace proposal as a threat to its security. 
"That ministers in the gov­ernment should attack the gov­ernment and portray it as hav­ing sold out the country ... this is irresponsible," Levy told re­porters after the weekly Cabinet session. 
In agreeing to a regional con­ference, Israel and the United States had "removed land mines" on the road to peace, Levy said.

Leprachaun tryouts 
Two of the candidates try out for the position of Leprachaun for the 91-92 season before an attentive audience. Dan Wagner, not pictured, was chosen to be Leprachaun. 
Gun control bills dominate NRA meeting 
SAN ANTONIO (AP) -A bill that would require waiting pe­riods before the purchase of handguns drew more attention than usual to the annual con­vention of the National IUfle Association, which opposes the legislation. 
In some ways it was business as usual at the three-day con­vention, which ended Sunday. 
Rifles, pistols, camouflage garb and taxidermists filled hundreds of booths. Young and old, women and men, pollee of­fleers and Cub Scouts Inspected products and collected T-shirts and brochures. 
But more outsiders than usual monitored the NRA's 120th annual convention because of debate over the so-called Brady bill, which would require a seven-day waiting period before handgun purchases. 
"We're certainly getting more national media attention this year than previous years. But the NRA has been a lightning rod for a number of years," said Richard Feldman, the asso­ciation's national grassroots coordinator for the gun control Issue. 
The NRA opposes the Brady bill, claiming waiting periods do not keep criminals from ac­quiring guns but do deny law­abiding citizens the right to self­protection. The bill was named for former White House press secretary James Brady, who was seriously wounded in 1981 during the attempted assassina­tion of President Reagan. 
Reagan, a member of the NRA, recently spoke out in fa­vor of the bill. 
The convention passed a reso­lution opposing the Brady bill and urged members to write their congressmen. In addition, the NRA last week mailed out 30,000.fllers nationwide on the gun control debate.

A view of the Cypriot tanker "Haven" after an explosion turned it into a "ball of fire" off the Genoa harbor Thursday. At least six crewmen died and twenty-eight were injured. 
Many taxed by today's deadline 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The deadline nears. The IRS waits. The taxpayer panics. 
It's a taxing time for all Americans, but especially for the millions who have waited until the last minute to file their 1990 federal tax returns -and for Postal Service and IRS em­ployees who have to deal with the annual April 15 onslaught. 
The Internal Revenue Service expects to receive 27 million re­turns at its 10 processing cen­ters this week -nearly one of every four that will be filed this year. 
Most people must file by mid­night Monday, but several mil­lion will take longer. 
The IRS said many of its of­fices and its toll-free telephone number-800-829-1040­would remain open into the evening to answer taxpayer questions. But don't expect in­stant service; repeated tries often are required in the best of times to get through to an IRS operator. 
Many post offices, especially in metropolitan areas, will sta­tion clerks outside to allow mo­torists to drop off returns without leaving their cars. 
In some areas, Tax Night has become a social event. 
Outside the post office in Norfolk, Va., according to the Postal Service, WAFX radio "will have Abe Lincoln, a chief justice and Uncle Sam passing out stamps. Grandma will be cutting and passing out slices of apple pie and they'll also have live music and hot dogs." 
The IRS will send volunteers inside the lobby of the Milwaukee Post Office to fill out simple returns and offer advice on the more complicated re­turns. Anyone in the Los Angeles basin will be able to determine the closest post office open until midnight by dialing a special number. 
Postal authorities in New York City are opening all 21 windows in the James A. Farley Building for 24 hours Monday. In addition to selling stamps and envelopes, the Postal Service says, "to ease the pain of filing taxes, both Excedrin and Maalox will be in front of the building giving out free samples." 
Five million or more couples and individuals are expected to escape the filing-deadline rush by getting an automatic four­month extension simply by mailing a Form 4868 before midnight. That form won't get you more time to pay whatever is owed; a check for the out­standing balance must accom­pany the form. 
A two-month extension is available without asking for those whose home and main place of business are outside the United States and Puerto Rico. 
Military personnel who served in the Persian Gulf area at any time since Aug. 2 have at least 180 days after Monday to file. Most have automatic extensions of up to 285 days and no penalty or interest will be charged on payments that otherwise would have been due Monday. 
Those military taxpayers who are due refunds will begin earning interest Monday, even if they use the extension to delay filing for several months. 
Those special breaks also are available to Red Cross workers, accredited journalists and other personnel who were in the Persian Gulf in what the law considers to be a role support­ing the military. 
The IRS estimates that once all the extensions have expired, a record 113 million couples and individuals will have filed returns for 1990. 
In the most recent report on the filing season, the IRS re­ported it had received nearly 67 million returns through April 5 and had processed 86 percent of them. 
Of those processed, 79.7 per­cent had qualified for tax re­funds, averaging $902. 
From the IRS perspective, one of the biggest success stories of the year has been that more than 7 million electronic re­turns have been filed. Those re­turns, sent directly into an IRS computer by authorized opera­tors, result in fewer errors, considerably lower processing costs and much faster refunds. 
The IRS offered these sugges­tions for last-minute filers: 
Check 
and recheck your math. You may round off to the nearer dollar. 


Be sure the return is signed; if it's a joint return both spouses must sign. 

If 
you don't itemize, be sure you claim the proper standard deduction for your age and fil­ing status. 

Attach 
your W-2 forms and any supplementary forms or schedules. 

Use

RECORD OIL SPILLS The following is a list of record oil spills from ships. In shipping, oil normally is measured by ton. Generally. the amount of tons can be multiplied by seven to estimate the number of barrels spilled; eaeh barrel contains 42 gallons. However. the exact number of barrnls in a ton varies according to the type of oil. By comparison, the worst oil spill ip U.S. history, the March 24, 1989, spill from the Exxon Valdez off Alaska, was nearly 11 million gallons. That translates as roughly 35,000 to 40,000 tons using the seven barrels per ton rule of thumb.

Census: Ind. getting older 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -With more Hoosiers in the upper age brackets than in the past, se­niors will be getting more at­tention from businesses, ex­perts predict. 
Census figures show that in the past decade the Hoosier population aged a little faster than the population in some other states. 
The experts say growth com­panies in the 1990s will include those offering investment ad­vice, dry cleaning, maid service, lawn care and recreational merchandise. 
In 1980, the median age of Indiana residents was 29.2 years, below the national aver­age of 29.8 years, said Jerome McKibben, demographer of the Indiana Business Research Center.  
Because of a large migration of young people from the state in the last decade, Indiana's median age has almost caught up with the new national me­dian age of 33 years, McKibben said. 
The outbound migration of about 284,000 Hoosiers was largely caused by a lack of jobs for young people entering the labor market, McKibben said. The job shortage was worsened by the recession in the early 1980s. 
Though the number of people over 65 years of age has risen, there is not yet the urgent need to build retirement communi­ties, marketing experts said. 
That's because the largest segment of the population con­sists of the baby boomers, now in their 30s and 40s and still too young for retirement. 
To succeed in the 1990s, businesses must understand the wants of those in their 40s, marketing experts said. 
Middle-aged Hoosiers will have less time for chores, begin to save for retirement and want to spend what leisure time they have on recreation. 
Thomas Hustad, a marketing professor at Indiana University, predicts that the 1990s will the be decade of "de-yuppi­fication."

INDIANA BUSINESS BRIEFS 
EVANSVILLE-Holland Dairy customers will be able to buy half-gallons of milk in pouches rather than cartons beginning next week. 
Company President Earl Carter said the pouches will reduce waste volume at landfills by 95 percent and waste weight by 75 percent. 
The pouches also are reusable and recyclable, officials said Thursday. 
The pouches will be made from a plastic film produced by du Pont of Canada, Carter said. They already are used in Canada and some areas of the United States, he added. 
Holland is offering for sale as a one-time purchase a rigid pitcher for use with the milk packaged in the pouches. 
Carter said the dairy expects to eventually switch to pouched products in other sizes. Consumers should be able to buy milk in pouches at no extra cost, he said. 
The new packages will be on the shelves at environmentally con­scious grocery stores Monday, Carter said. 
INDIANAPOLIS -Eli Lilly & co. is producing heart pacemakers at a new factory on Puerto Rico's north coast, eco­nomic development officials say. 
CPI Caribe employs 80 workers at the pacemaker plant in Do­rado, the U.S. territory's Economic Development Administration said Wednesday. 
CPl. Caribe is a subsidiary of Lilly's Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. di­vision, which is based in St. Paul, Minn. Lilly, headquartered in Indianapolis, also produces pharmaceu­ticals in Puerto Rico and has two plants employing 1,100 workers. 
FORT WAYNE-Uncoln National Corp. said Thursday that its property-casualty operations have suffered an estimated $34 million in storm-related losses for the first quarter. 
Storm activity from southern California to western New York resulted in more than $20 million in claims during March alone, Lincoln National said. The claims included damage from tornadoes and high winds in Indiana and other Midwest states at the end o the month. 
"The amount of insured losses reported to Lincoln National from the March storms is comparable to that from Hurricane Hugo in September 1989," said Ian Rolland, the company's president and chief executive officer. Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston and other parts of South Carolina. 
The storm losses will hurt quarterly earnings, Rolland said, but he declined to be more specific. Quarterly results are due to be re­leased May 2.

Big Three automakers report business losses 
DETROIT (AP)-The nation's Big Three automakers, mired in a recession and a stubborn slump in car and truck sales, are preparing to announce their worst financial quarter ever. about $2.4 billion in red ink. 
Part of the reason for the huge first-quarter 1991 losses are labor contracts the au­tomakers signed last year with the United Auto Workers union (UAW), auto analysts said. 
The expected January-March losses by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. come atop $2.1 billion in losses during the final three months of 1990, the previous worst quarter in history. 
If the analysts' first-quarter predictions are correct, that means the Big Three will lose about $4.5 billion in six months, or $18 for every man, woman and child living in the United States. 
"I think it's safe to say that the worst is behind us," said analyst Douglas Laughlin of Bear, Stearns & Co. of New York. "But it doesn't take a lot to look better." 
The bulk of the losses can be traced to four factors: 
Unexpectedly 
weak orders from dealers. Automakers are wholesalers that make their money selling cars and trucks to dealers. When dealers rein in orders, automakers' profits suffer. 

Higher-than-anticipated 
la­bor costs. When the dealers slowed their orders, automak­ers shut down plants temporar­ily. But they have UAW con­tracts that require continued payment of laid-off workers, draining supplemental unem­ployment benefit funds faster than originally thought. 

A 
high percentage of fleet sales. Automakers sell cars to corporations and rental car companies on a much narrower profit margin than when cars are sold individually to dealers.

Dear Editor: 
Most white students on this campus (and I emphasize most) are ignorant and are comfort­able living in their ignorance. Granted this is a generalization, but it is no less what these spineless students do behind closed doors or through The Observer as an April Fool's joke. To take the matter a step further, the Notre Dame admin­istration promotes racism itself. Sure this may come as a shock to most "good" white Catholic Domers, but it is true nevertheless. 
No, this is not another Black screaming "racism," but if someone wants to know, I will tell what I am. I am an African student who is tired of the Notre Dame mythology, false

yardwork, and winterizing. 
Since a good portion of the work was handled inside the houses, the weather did not af­fect the project as much as it could have. 
"It (the affects of the weather) wasn't as bad as ev­eryone expected it too be," said Heisler. 
There were some trouble spots, though. According to Brian Torrez, a junior from Keenan, the main project at his assigned site involved painting the outside of a house. The weather prevented this task from being accomplished and there was little to be done in the house's interior. 
The owners of the home "appreciated what was done," said Torrez, "but I wish we could have done more." 
For the most part, relations between students and other members of the community were extremely good. Although one student said that there was an obvious difference between the two workers, most students felt that the two worked well together. 
"The key was cooperation." said Valerie Hicks from Saint Mary's. "We couldn't have done anything if we had all just grabbed a brush and started to paint." 
Amy Krattenmaker, a Notre Dame freshman. said, "The other members of the commu­nity who were helping were great. They were fun to talk to and very helpful." 
In spite of all the hard work, students found a way to make the day enjoyable. 
"What made it (the day) so fun was that the people who were there wanted to be there," Hicks said. 
Higgins added. "the people definitely made it fun. I went in there knowing so few, and left knowing so many." 
Shabaaz. who has been in­volved with Christmas in April for all three years, expressed that he was pleased with the people he had working for him Saturday. 
"I had an excellent crew this year," he said. "Last year I had too many people ... too many is just as bad as too few. (Saturday) it seemed like I had the right number." 
Most of the crews finished their work by 3:00 p.m. "I was surprised that we could finish the house we did," Williams said. 
Hicks compared her feeling at the end of the day to witnessing a Cinderella story. "In a matter of hours the house transformed into something liveable:" 
Part of the reason volunteers found the experience so valu­able was the reaction of the homeowners. 
Sandy Hernandez. a sopho­more from Saint Mary's, said that towards the end of the day she caught a glimpse of Christine Hudson who owned the house the house where she worked. "It seemed like she was really happy." she said. "It made me feel like I was really helping her out." 
Hudson confirmed Hernandez' observation. She said, "It looks so different. Everyone has been really nice. Nice work!" 
Volunteers were invited to a reception at the West Side Democratic Club begining at 
3:30 p.m.. There workers had a chance to relax and enjoy the results of their work with the new people they had met. 
The general feeling was one of satisfaction and success. 
"I think it (the day as a whole) just proves that each person can make a difference in their own way," said Hicks later. 
Higgins agreed. "I plan on doing it all four years I'm here."

NEW YORK (AP) -It was another walk-over for the New York Mets. 
Hubie Brooks and Rick Cerone hit ·two-run singles in the first inning and the New York Mets beat the Montreal Expos 7-1 Sunday behind a five-hitter by Frank Viola {1-0). 
The Mets drew seven more walks, including Brooks and pinch-hitter Dave Magadan with the bases loaded in the seventh inning. In seven games, the Mets have walked 55 times, twice any other team's total in the majors. 
"It's incredible how much we've walked," Viola said. "I went up to the plate swinging, just to speed up the game." 
"Every time we look up on the scoreboard, the count is 2­arid-0," Montreal manager Buck Rodgers said. "We're giving away two or three runs every game. Once we stop beating ourselves, maybe we can start beating someone else." 
Cardinals 11, Phillies 7 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) -Felix Jose drove in four runs with a homer and a bases-loaded dou­ble. 
Bryn Smith (2-0) allowed six hits and six runs in seven in­nings, but two of the runs were unearned because of two St. Louis errors. Lee Smith, who has saved the Cardinals' three victories, got the final four outs.

Cubs 6, Pirates 4 
CHICAGO (AP) Stan Belinda walked Chico Walker to load the bases in the eighth in­ning and walked Doug Dascenzo to force home the go­ahead run. 
Shawon Dunston opened the eighth with a single off Belinda (0-1) and Gary Scott beat out a bunt single. After the walks, Mark Grace hit a run-scoring groundout for a two-run lead. 
Braves 12, Reds 1 
CINCINNATI (AP) -Tom Glavine beat Cincinnati for the ninth time in 11 career deci­sions and Rafael Belliard had three hits and drove in three runs.

AMERICAN LEAGUE Blue Jays 9, Brewers 0 
Jimmy Key felt in tip-top shape going into Sunday's game against Milwaukee. He felt even better when Toronto scored six runs in the second inning. 
Key pitched a two-hitter and rookie Mark Whiten singled twice in the six-run second as the Blue Jays beat the Brewers at the SkyDome. 
At 5-2. the Blue Jays are off to their best start since the club's inaugural season in 1977. 
"I was up to 117 pitches and I wasn't even tired," Key said. "One of the keys for me today was getting ahead with a first­pitch fastball then coming over the top with my curve. Mind you, it makes your job easier when you have a big lead to work with." 
Key (2-0) struck out five and walked two in recording his fifth career shutout and 21st complete game.

BOSTON (AP) -Albert Belle hit two homers and drove in four runs and knuckleballer Tom Candiotti pitched four-hit ball over seven innings, leading Cleveland over Boston. , 
Belle, who led the majors with 11 home.runs in spring training after missing most of 1990 while in a rehab program for alcoholism, hit a two-run homer off Greg Harris (0-2) in the first inning, added a solo shot, his third in six games, in the sixth and had an RBI single in a two-run seventh against reliever Dana Kiecker. 
Angels 9, Twins 4 
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) Former Twin Gary Gaetti, booed at the Metrodome during the ·weekend, drove in four to help California beat Jack Morris and Minnesota. 
It was also a big day for Luis Polonia. The diminutive out­fielder had three hits, scored three runs and stole three bases as the Angels improved to 5-1. It equals California's best start even, also achieved in 1970 and 1974. 
Royals 5, Yankees 3 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) ­Kirk Gibson hit two homers and drove in four runs and Mike Boddicker gave up no runs in eight innings as Kansas City beat New York. 
Gibson, who signed as a free agent with the Royals over the winter, homered in the first and eighth innings. His last two-homer game was for Los Angeles at Chicago on July 14, 1988. 
Rangers 15, Orioles 3 

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) ­Nolan Ryan beat Baltimore for the first time since April 20, 1976, allowing two hits and striking out nine in seven in­nings as Texas pounded the Orioles. 
Ryan (1-1) got off to a shaky start, giving up a three-run homer to Sam Horn in the first inning. But he settled down and allowed only Glenn Davis' third-inning single after that as the Rangers broke a season­opening four-game losing streak. 
A's 7, Mariners 6 

OAKLAND, Calif. -Seattle blew a chance to halt Dave Stewart's 20-game April winning streak as Oakland rallied from a five-run deficit to beat the winless Mariners. 
Mark McGwire's two-out single in the ninth inning off reliever Mike Jackson (0-1) drove home Dave Henderson from second base with the game-winning run to give the A's the victory and drop the Mariners to 0-6. 
Rookie Dana Allison, the A's fourth pitcher, worked the final inning for his first win. 
The Mariners led 5-0 after two innings, but the A's tied it 6-6 in sixth to preserve Stewart's streak. Stewart is 16­2 lifetime against Seattle.

Blackhawks eliminated by Minnesota; St Louis wins 
(AP) -The season ended for the Chicago Blackhawks on Sunday night, while the St. Louis Blues and Calgary Flames kept theirs going. 
The Blackhawks, the NHL's No. 1 team during the regular season, suffered a shocking first-round knockout with a 3-1 defeat by the lowly Minnesota North Stars. 
In winning the Norris Division series in six games, the North Stars became the first team in 20 years with a first-round upset of the NHL regular­season champion. 
Jon Casey made 26 saves and Brian Bellows had two goals and an assist to lead Minnesota. 
The Blackhawks weren't just beaten by Minnesota, they were dominated. The North Stars outscored the Blackhawks 12-2 the last three games and out­shot them 222-159 in the series. 
The North Stars' last series victory came against St. Louis six years ago and their last seven-game series win was against St. Louis in 1984, the same year they posted their only previous playoff victory over Chicago. 
Blues 3, Red Wings 0 

The Blues, fighting for a small piece of NHL history, beat Detroit on goals by Dave Tomlinson, Jeff Brown and Dave Lowry. 
It was the fifth shutout this season for Vincent Riendeau, who handled 23 shots. The Blues had 21 shots on Tim Cheveldae. It was the first time Detroit had been held scoreless in a playoff game since 1978 and the first shutout by the Blues since 1984. 
The Blues are bidding to be­come the eighth team to rally from a 3-1 deficit to win an NHL playoff series. It was last done by the Edmonton Oilers last season in the first round against Winnipeg. The New York Islanders have done it twice and the Red Wings once. Other teams to accomplish the feat are Toronto, Washington and Los Angeles. 
Smythe Division Flames 2, Oilers 1, OT 
Theoren Fleury scored a great breakaway goal at 4:40 of overtime as Calgary defeated Edmonton to stay alive in the playoffs. 
Fleury, the Flames' leading scorer during the regular sea­son with 51 goals, intercepted Mark Messier's cross-ice pass and broke in all alone on goal­tender Grant Fuhr. He slid the puck between Fuhr's legs for his first goal of the playoffs. 
Paul Ranheim also scored for the Flames, with Fleury earning an assist on the goal. Craig Simpson scored for the Oilers, who have blown a 3-1 series lead once before and lost -to the Los Angeles Kings in 1989. 
Fuhr's Calgary counterpart, Mike Vernon, was also brilliant. But Fuhr was tested far more and made a slew of memorable saves. 

Celtics defeat Knicks to move within one game of Bulls 
BOSTON (AP) -Kevin Gamble and Robert Parish led a 17-6 run at the end of the third quarter, lifting the Boston Celtics within one game of the NBA's Eastern Conference lead with a 115-102 victory over the New York Knicks on Sunday. 
Boston (56-22) is trying to catch Chicago (57 -21) for first place and homecourt advantage throughout the conference playoffs. The Bulls were idle Sunday. Each team has four regular-season games left. 
The Knicks lost their 20th consecutive regular-season game in Boston since last winning on Feb. 29, 1984. New York's only victory in Boston in its last 29 games came in the fifth and deciding game of last season's opening playoff round. Boston's 35-5 home record is the best in the NBA. 
The Celtics, who swept their five-game season series against New York, were led by Gamble with 28, Parish with 23 and Reggie Lewis with 20. Larry Bird missed his fourth consecutive game with back spasms. 
Bullets 1 01, Heat 96 

LANDOVER, Md. Washington handed the Miami Heat its 12th consecutive road loss as Ledell Eackles scored nine points in an 18-5 fourth­quarter run. 
Eackles scored 16 of his 17 points in the second half and Harvey Grant had 18 of his 26 in the final two periods, including six in the pivotal surge that gave the Bullets a secure 87-77 lead with 4:24 left. 
Sherman Douglas scored 26 points for the Heat, which lost its sixth game in the last seven. 
Wolves 96, 76ers 88 
PHILADELPHIA -Tony Campbell scored 23 points and Doug West added a season-high 17 as the Minnesota snapped a seven-game losing streak. The Timberwolves, who led by 19 in the third quarter, had won just one of their previous 20 road games. 
Minnesota held an 84-71 lead with 7:34 left, but Armon Gilliam scored six points during a 12-4 run to bring the 76ers to 88-83 with 2:56 remaining. Rick Mahorn's free throws with 
1:08 left made it 90-86. 
Spurs 109, Suns 101

Negele Knight scored 27 points and Jeff Hornacek 20 for the Suns, who had a club­record 16 blocked shots -six by Mark West. The previous record was 15, set Jan. 25 against Seattle. 
Phoenix played its fifth straight game without Kevin Johnson and Dan Majerle because of injuries. Tom Chambers, who sat out three games with lower back spasms, was held to four points on 2­for-15 shooting.

lan Woosnam stands tall in Masters' green jacket 
AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -The little one finally won a big one. 
The Welshman Ian Woosnam, who has labored in the shadow of his more famous European frinnds, made a par putt just about as long as his 5 feet, 4 inches to turn back Tom Watson on the last hole Sunday and win the 55th Masters. 
lie won his first major with a scrambling par to finish off a final round of par 72 and a 11­under-par 277 total. 
Jose Maria Olazabal, a 25­year-old Spaniard, took second, one shot back after the 41­ynar-old Watson double-bo­gnyed thn 18th. 
Olazabal, who also bogeyed 18, shot 70. 
Watson. who played with Woosnam in the final group on thn Augusta National Golf Club course, rode a pair of eagles into a tie for the lflad going to the final hole. 
But then it all came apart for Watson, who was grimly at­tnmpting to snap a 4-year non­winning string. 
lie drove into deep rough on thn right, bunkered his second, came out long and missed a 25­foot downhill, par-saving putt. 
Aftt~r Woosnam had holed out the winner, Watson missed his 8-foot comebacker, and saw his comeback dreams end on a 3­putt double-bogey.

The closing 73 dropped him into a tie with Steve Pate, 1984 Masters winner Ben Crenshaw and 41-year-old Lanny Wadkins at 277. 
Pate, who started the day's play nine shots off the pace, scored an eagle-3 on the eighth hole, played the par-5's five un­der and saved a 65 with a 45­foot par putt on the final hole. 
Crenshaw also had an eagle, his on the 15th, but didn't give himself a chance on the last three holes. He had a 68. 
Wadkins missed two short putts and twice stubbed chip shots in a frustrating 71. 
Jodie Mudd, Australian Ian Baker-Finch and Andrew Magee were tied at 280. Mudd shot 69 over the final 18 holes of the year's first major golf championship, while Magee and Baker-Finch each had a 70. 
Woosnam's triumph over a host of contenders -at least seven men had a chance to win it over the back nine -ex­tended European domination of this event, as well as world golf. 
His last-hole par, manufac­tured from a drive far to the left onto a members' practice tee, marked the fourth consecutive year the green jacket of a Masters winner has

Strike The Gold new Derby ~-favorite Fly So Free loses by two lengths at Blue Grass Stakes 
(AP) -Add Strike the Gold to the list of Kentucky Derby con­tenders. 
Strike the Gold, a loser by one length to Fly So Free in last month's Florida Derby, came back with a three-length victory Saturday in the $400,800 Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland. 
"I know my horse and my horse is getting better," said Nick Zito, trainer of Strike the Gold. "I said all week, if he (Fly So Free) waited for my horse, he'd be in trouble." 
Fly So Free, winner of five straight stakes races before Saturday's loss, stayed with pacesetter Nowork All Play throughout the race. 
Strike the Gold charged past Fly So Free at the head of the stretch' and won comfortably in 
1:48 2-5 for the 1 1/8 miles. He paid $7.80, $2.20 and $2.40 for his second victory in seven ca­reer starts. Fly So Free, a 1-5 favorite, returned $2.10 and $2.10, with Nowork All Play $2.40 to show. 
Also possibly in the May 4 Kentucky Derby mix are Green Alligator, winner of Saturday's $300,000 California Derby at Golden Gate Fields, and per­haps even lightly raced Tank, who took the $150,000 Garden State Stakes at Garden State Park. 
Green Alligator, $11, overtook Slew the Surgeon in the stretch to score a head victory as Split Run, the 8-5 favorite, finished next to last. The time was 1:47 4-5 for the 1 1/8 miles. 
Trainer Murray Johnson said the win did not guarantee a start in the Kentucky Derby. 
"We're on our way to Kentucky with the stable, so we can't count out the Kentucky Derby," he said. "But the Belmont is our next major goal. I'd like to run once before the Belmont, and the Derby could be that once." 
Tank, $6.60, won the 1 1/8­mile Grade III Garden State Stakes by 7 1/2 lengths. 
"He's the best 3-year-old I've 
ever ridden," jockey Rick 
Wilson said. "He has enough 
ability for the Derby, but he 
may need some more experi­
ence. I don't know how good 
this colt is. He scares me. He 
scares me." 
It was the first stakes win for 
Tank, the son of 1985 
Preakness winner Tank's 
Prospect, and his third win in 
five career starts. 
In Sunday races: 
Bill Shoemaker, critically in­
jured in a car accident last 
week, got the biggest win of his 
career as a trainer as Fire the 
Groom, $12.20, won the 
$211,350 Santa Anita 
Breeders' Cup. 
Ridden by Gary Stevens, Fire 
The Groom rallied after run­
ning 10 lengths off the pace to 
win the mile race on turf for 
fillies and mares. Shoemaker's 
assistant trainer, Patrick 
Gallagher, saddled the winner. 
"It's very gratifying to win 
(for Shoemaker)," Stevens said. 
"It feels good, but it would feel 
better if he was here with us. 
I'll be at the hospital to give 
him a blow-by-blow descrip­
tion." 

Lite Light, $3.80, ridden by 
Corey Nakatani, handed 
Withallprobability the first loss 
of her brief career, winning by 
two lengths in the $250,000 
Fantasy Stakes at Oaklawn 
Park. 

Ambassador In Love, $15.60, 
beat All Smarts by one length in the $91,650 Dewitt Clinton Handicap at Aqueduct. Ambassador In Love, ridden by ~·orge Chavez and assigned 120 pounds, covered seven furlongs in 1:23 3-5 in besting a tO­horse field of 3-year-olds for his third victory in 11 career 
starts. 

Feline of Payne, $5, survived 
interference claims to win the 
Royal Harmony Purse at 
Sportsman's Park. Feline of 
Payne won by three lengths 
over Digital Dash. 
J.R.'s Horizon, $17.40, led 
wire to wire on a muddy track 
to win the 37th running of the John B. Campbell Handicap at Pimlico Race Course. Favorite Reputed Testamony, who car­ried four pounds more than any of the others in the field and seven more than the winner, rallied from last place in the fi­nal three furlongs to come up a nose short. 
In another Saturday race, Festin, $24.20, won the $500,000 Oaklawn Handicap, while Unbridled, last year's Kentucky Derby winner, was sent off as the 2-1 second choice and finished fifth. 
Primal, a 25-1 shot, was sec­ond and Jolie's Halo, the 8-5 favorite, third.

has had its ups and downs, but we ended the season on a good note. We realized how close we were this season, and next spring we'll have some more depth, so I think everything is going to get better." 
The Irish finished on a good note, but it was probably not enough to turn the heads of the NCAA selection committee. The Irish played the type of sched­ule necessary to get into the tournament, but dropping the close matches against ranked teams hurt. Louderback said he would be very surprised if the team made the tournament, but added that some Irish could make the individual tournament when invitations are extended in late April. 
Said Louderback, "I think that first and second singles 

(Tracy Barton and  Melissa  
Harris)  and  first  doubles  
(Barton  and  Christy  

Faustmann) deserve to go to the NCAA individual tourna­ment. They have had great sea­sons."

Lax squad tough in defeat 
By DAVE McMAHON 
Associate Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame lacrosse team put together one of its best defensive efforts of the season Saturday against 14th­ranked Cornell, but the Irish lacked in the offensive depart­ment as the visiting Big Red dropped Notre Dame 10-3. 
"We held a very good team to 10 goals and played a lot of de­fense doing it." said Irish Coach Kevin Corrigan. 
Despite a Cornell motion of­fense that could have easily led to overpursuit from the Irish defenders, the Irish (4-5) main­tained their poise from the out­set. Cornell (7-2) took a 2-0 lead into the second quarter, as the Irish came up empty on four first quarter shots. Cornell began the second quarter with a gift, increasing its lead to 3-0 after a shot blocked by Irish goalie Pat Finn dribbled past the goal-line. 
Sophomore Brian Mayglothing put the Irish on the board at 5:05 of the second quarter, completing a patient offensive threat downfield. Cornell quickly countered, scoring twice within a minute as defenseman Tony Morgan went unscathed past the Irish defense to put Cornell ahead at 5-l. 
"They (Notre Dame) have some good attack persondel and we denied them the oppor­tunity to go to the cage," said Cornell Coach Richie Moran, in his 23rd season with the Big Red. "We have good team speed and that helped us." 
The Big Red cranked out four unanswered goals in the third quarter, increasing its lead to 
Golf team wins Illinois tourney behind Phares 
Special to The Observer 
The Notre Dame women's golf team captured the team title at this weekend's Bradley Lady Braves Invitational in Peoria, Ill. 
The Irish blazed their way to a 27-hole finish of 500, six strokes better than runner-up Southwest Missouri State at 
506. Notre Dame shot an open­ing round 18 of 324, followed by an abbreviated 9-hole sec­ond round of 176. The 36-hole tourney was limited to 27 holes due to rain. 
Sophomore Kathy Phares led the Irish with a 123 (80-43) scorecard and finished runner up to Southwest Missouri State's Camilla Oderling by one stroke in the individual compe­tition. Fellow sophomore Cappy Mack tied for third place (80­45), and senior captain Roberta Bryer snared fifth place honors with a 148 (80-48) tally. 
"I figured if we had played our normal game, we would have won this tournament," said coach Tom Hanlon. "If the weather had been better, we would have won by more." 
The tournament win is the 
second in the three-year history 
of the women's varsity gol 
program. Notre Dame won its 
first women's golf tournament 
on September 21, 1989 at thP 
Indianapolis Lady Greyhound 
Invitational in Indianapolis. 

10-1 before the Irish responded with two goals with less than five minutes remaining in the game. Junior Brian Schirf scored at the 4:57 mark before senior midfielder John Capano squeaked a behind-the-back shot into the Cornell cage three minutes later. 
"We played a game-and-a­half or two games worth of de­fense," said Notre Dame coach Kevin Corrigan. "We've just got to do a better job offensively against a team like Cornell." 
The Irish offensive threat was minimal, as Cornell took 15 more shots than Notre Dame, due in part to a favorable 11-5 margin in face-offs won.

to play catch-up against a po­tentially powerful offense. 
"We've got to get in a scoring groove early," said Capano, who snagged six ground balls. "When we don't score early, the offense gets dejected and then we're back to playing more de­fense." 
While anything less than a win is unsatisfactory to an Irish squad which has the· NCAA tournament as its final goal, the loss shouldn't do much harm to the young squad. "We know that we can play with anyone in the country," said senior defenseman Eamon McAnaney, who finished with six ground balls. "We're fo­cused as a team and know what we have to do in these next five games." Despite being down 10-1, the Irish never conceded to a Cornell team that could be on the post-season schedule for the Irish. ''I'm not disappointed with the effort our guys gave," said Corrigan. "We'll have better days than this if we continue to play as hard as we did."

Men's track sees improvement 

By LYNNE BRAGG 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame Men's track team came away from this past weekend's Dogwood Helays in Tennessee with one thing on their minds: improvement. 
The track team, though they did not bring many of members with them, participated in three full days of events. 
The Irish used the meet as a preparation for their upcoming invitational meets, and is also looking to qualify several team members for the ICAAAAs (May 18-19). 
"We used this weekend as a chance for us to compete with some experienced teams," se­nior Hyan Cahill said."We were also hoping some more guys would qualify for the IC4As this weekend." 
In Thursday's events, Cahill placed third in the invitational 5000 meter run. With a time of 14:00.41, he beat Notre Dame's

Six members of the Notre Dame women's track team made the trip to Knoxville, Tennessee this weekend to par­ticipate in the Dogwood Helays, with mixed results. 
On Thursday, sophomore Lisa Gorski (10:24.74) and junior Diana Bradley (10:26.41) fin­ished sixth and ninth, respec­tively, in the open 3000-meter 
run,  won  by  Western  
Michigan's  Stacey  Kilburn  
(9:53.34).  

It was the collegiate debut for both Gorski and Bradley in this event, so both decided to run together and give each other support during the seven and a half lap race. 
"We didn't know exactly how we were going to run the race, so we used each other to pace one another," Bradley said. "I'm happy with my time; it was

previous outdoor best time of 
14:26.97 in this event, set by Mike O'Connor at the Rice Invitational. 
In the 10,000 meter run, Pat Kearns earned fifth-place honors with a time of 30:03.50, followed by teammate Nick Radkewich in tenth place(30:14.00). 
Friday, J.T. Burke ran a per­sonal outdoor best in the open 1500 meters with a time of 
about what I thought I would do going in." 
"I definitely would not have done as well without her help," said Gorski. 
Also on Thursday, senior Jenny Ledrick finished 16th in a field of 34 runners in the invitational portion of the 5000. Ledrick's time of 17:41.42, while well off the winning pace of Alena Palmquist of Nike South (16:17.61), was a per­sonal record by two seconds. 
In Friday's preliminary rounds of the 800, freshman Laura Guyer finished fifth in her heat in a time of 2:21.80. 
On Saturday, Gorski and Bradley again teamed up, this time in the second section of the 1500 prelims, but on this day, their finishes were re­versed. 
Bradley took the lead on the third lap and held it until the final 50 meters, finishing third 3:55.26. Burke's previous best was set at Rice, where he ran 3:56.86. 
The Irish had a strong show­ing in the field events at the re­lays. 
Greg Matteo took third in the pole vault, clearing 14-6. 
John Cole had the strongest performance for the field team, jumping 6-9 in the high jump. 
The Irish duo of .Jon Smerek and Tony Smith captured fifth and sixth places, respectively, in the discus. Smerek had a personal best of 151-8, which topped his ICAAAA qualifying throw. Tony Smith hurled 158-6 in the event. 
In the final day of action, the Notre Dame 4 x 400 meter re­lay finished in 15th place with a time of 3:17.24. With this time the relay team beat their best indoor time of 3:17.80 set at the Quad meet in early April. 
The men's track team is now looking towards the Indiana Intercollegiates April 20th. 

Irish women run well in Dogwoods Gorski, Bradley help each oth,er in collegiate debuts 
(4:46.75)  behind  Western  
Carolina's  Susie  Gardner  
(4:45.73)  and  Western  

Michigan's Moreen Manning (4:46.52). Gorski, meanwhile, felt ill throughout the race and finished ninth in the heat. 
"I wasn't expecting them to pass me with such force," Bradley said. "It caught me off­guard. But while I would have liked to have run faster and, of course, to have won, I am happy with how I competed." 
In other action Saturday, two Irish freshman sprinters ran in the preliminaries of the 100. Ashia Price finished fifth in her heat (12.68), while Latrese Waters took second in hers (12.60). 
For a first-year squad, being invited to the Dogwood Helays, one of the most prestigious meets in the country, is an honor, one which Gorski be­lieves Notre Dame made the most of.

Yet the Irish sparkled in the field as well, committing no er­rors to the Musketeers' three. The fielding, however, only served to complement the pitching performance of Tom Price (3-2) and Tony Livorsi, who combined to hold Xavier to five earned runs on eight hits, four wa)ks and throe strikeouts. 
With the conclusion of the weekend action, Notre Dame has won nine in a row over Xavier and 10 of the last 11 versus the Musketeers. The Irish hold a commanding 40-19 lead in the series between the schools. 
Notre Dame is back in action tonight against the University of Illinois-Chicago at seven p.m. at Coveleski Stadium.

Bookstore seeds Tequila, Gauchos, 4 Men win 
By RICHARD MATHURIN Sports Writer 
The opening round games of Bookstore Basketball XX came to a close over the weekend with no real surprises and all of the top teams advancing. 
Top 16 seed Tequila White Lightning X cruised to an easy 21-6 victory Saturday over Muckluck. Shannon Cullinan led the victors with 7 points, while Eric Jones and Mike McKinnon chipped in with 6 apiece. 
"They were a good team, we were just much bigger. It really helps having 6' 8" Jim Dolan throwing outlet passes to start the fast break," commented Cullinan. 
Also on Saturday, the Gauchos, another ranked team, advanced with a 21-5 victory over Todd, Ryan, Tally, Dave, and Doug: 5 Guys without Stupid Girlfriends. Former Stanford interhall star Rob Vazquez led the way with 8 points and 3 rebounds for the winners. An interesting side­note to the game was that Todd, Ryan,... all showed dressed in costumes, including those of a clown and a doctor. 

"We had fun playing a clown, a doctor, and an aviator, but we were kind of hoping to get some competition going into the next round," said Vazquez. 
On Sunday, powerhouse 4 Men with an Attitude crushed its opening round opponent Please don't Hurt Us, 21-0. 4 Men were led by football star Demetrius DuBose, who had 6 points, along with John Rapchinski who added 5 points. 
"It wasn't a real test, but we're just five friends out hav­ing fun. It's our goal to make it to the finals," said Rapchinski. 
An offshoot of 1990 champi­onship team Malicious Prostitution, Malicious Prosecution advanced in their first round game with a 21-7 victory over Mohammed and the Creeping Flows. Richard Howling paced Malicious with 6 points, while championship member Jon Bergman tossed in 5 points. 
"It was good to get going, but we were a little rusty," said Bergman. 
On Friday, the two top Observer Bookstore Basketball team names, Sleeping with Bienemy: The Ty Detmer Story and Two Rosses don't make a Right both advanced. 
Mike Scarsella and Brian Nash both hit for 8 points leading Bienemy to a hard fought victory over Harry, I need the Powder 21-19. 
Two Rosses had a much easier time in their game de­feating A Win and a Prayer 21­
11. Dave Pasquale led the win­ners with 5 points and 8 re­bounds. 
Finally, in a game resched­uled from Thursday, 1990 run­ner-up Adworks defeated Sad­dam, Digger, and Three Other Guys without an Offense 21-7. Adworks was led by Derrick Johnson in the victory. 
Second round action contin­ues this week, as the tourna­ment pushes toward the Sunday, April 28 final. 
Just Chillin', an easy victor in its opening game Thursday, will take on Armed & Dangerous today at 4:00 on Stepan Court One, while Malicious Prosecution takes on Darkside: The Final Chapter on Bookstore court 9.

Softball team drops two in Motor City 
By JIM VOGL 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame and Detroit softball teams showed why they are considered the two top con­tenders for the Midwestern Collegiate Conference champi­onship as they met in a rain­dampened doubleheader in Detroit on Saturday. 
The Lady Titans took the Irish for a pair of 1-0 victories, avenging a pair of losses by the same score last year. Beginning conference play with two tough wins, Detroit is also hoping to avenge Notre Dame's triumph in the MCC champi­onship after Detroit had owned the crown the three previous seasons. The Lady Titans' overall record improved to 24­13, while the Irish dropped to 18-18 and 6-2 in the confer­ence. 
The first game matched Notre Dame junior Missy Linn and Detroit junior Teresa Emery in a tight pitching duel. Emery's strong bid for a perfect game ended when Ruth Kmak stroked a one-out single in the seventh inning. The Lady Titans also struggled against

Linn, managing just three hits through the first seven innings as the game remained scoreless. 
Detroit struck the game's only blow in the bottom of the eighth, beginning with Deanna Kitchenmaster's lead-off single. She advanced to second on a single by Jacqui Pitts. One out later, Debbie Harlukowicz, who leads the MCC with a .374 bat­ting average, singled to bring home Kitchenmaster for the game winner. 
In the nightcap, the pitcher's duel featured Irish sophomore Staci Alford and Detroit fresh­man Cheryl Miles. This time, the Lady Titans struck early. 
Stefanie Hayes, last year's All-MCC selection at third base, singled to lead off the bottom of the second inning and promptly stole second. She ad­vanced to third on an error and, with two out, a single by senior Lori Pelchat drove in the second game's only run. 
"It wasn't like their pitchers just mowed us down. They only struck out one of our batters. We hit the ball hard but right at people and their defense made some great plays," said Notre Dame Coach Brian Boulac. 
"It was raining when we left and when we got there, and we just weren't in the right mental frame of mind to play," Boulac added.

Irish baseball victorious in duel with Musketeers 
By DAVE DIETEMAN 
Sports Editor 
Although the rains which flooded Coveleski Stadium Sunday came to a halt, Xavier's string of bad luck against Notre Dame did not. 
The Irish (19-12), who trailed 6-4 going into the fmal frame of game one, returned from a lengthy rain delay in explosive style as they deftly outdueled the Musketeers 7-6 and 9-3. 
"We played so poorly in that first game," said Notre Dame coach Pat Murphy. "We had some confusion on our defen­sive switches because we were doing it so much; there were just communication problems. We had some unfortunate plays, but this is a fundamen­tally sound team for the most part." 
Prior to the rain delay, Xavier starter Bernie Cuervo retired Matt Haas on a fly to center­field and surrendered a single to Greg Layson. Xavier coach Larry Redwine then staged a stall-tactics pitching change, inserting T.R. O'Brien to face Craig Counsell. 
O'Brien worked a 3-1 count on Counsell when the torrential downpour came to stop play for 
 
40 minutes. When play re­sumed, new Xavier pitcher Scott Tanguay walked Counsell and retired Jacobs on a fly to shortstop. With two outs, run­ners on first and second and his team trailing by two runs, Eric Danapilis stepped to the plate and crushed Tanguay's first offering 370 feet to left centerfield for a two-run dou­ble, tying the game. 


& Joe Blnklewlcz 
Yet Danapilis, who was in at second with a stand-up double, took third on the throw to the plate. The catcher alertly at­tempted to gun down Danapilis going to third, but the throw was mishandled by third base­man Brad Parker, allowing Danapilis to plate the winning run. Alan Walania pitched the final inning and 1/3 to win in relief of David Sinnes. 
The spectacular comeback, however, was not the game's only highlight. In the second in­ning, first baseman Joe Binkiewicz launched a strato­spheric home run well over the centerfield wall, which stands 405 feet from home plate. The wall, which is approximately 35 feet high, had never before been hit by a batted ball, let alone surmounted. Estimates put the length of Binkiewicz's shot, his sixth of the season, at 450 feet. 
"I felt really confident at the plate today," said Binkiewicz. "I went up there really aggres­sively and I felt good. The pitcher made a mistake-he threw that pitch right down the middle, I read it, got my bat out 
Irish men dominate AII-MCC team 
ObMrVer Staff Report 
The Notre Dame men's tennis team took one more step in its quest for an NCAA tournament bid this weekend, winning the MCC Championships in grand fashion. 
The Irish, with 78 points, seized first place, followed by Detroit (53), Marquette (49), Butler (40), Xavier (37), Saint Louis (34), Evansville (33) and Dayton (9). Notre Dame coach Bob Bayliss was named the 1991 MCC Coach of the Year, while Chuck Coleman, Will Forsyth, Mark Schmidt, Ron Rosas, Chris Wojtalik and Tom North were named to the 1991 All-MCC Team. 
Notre Dame, in winning the MCC championship for the third consecutive time, tied the MCC record for most consecutive championships. The record had been jointly held by Oklahoma City (1981, '82, '83) and Oral Roberts (1984, '85, '86). 

The two Irish doubles titles won this weekend give the Irish a total of nine MCC doubles titles, which puts Notre Dame at second on the all-time MCC record list. 
The Irish number three doubles semifinal loss to Detroit was the first match which Notre Dame has lost in the MCC championships since rejoining the MCC in 1989. 
The second place finish by the University of Detroit was the best ever for the Titans, in addition to being their highest point total ever. 
Digger unearths top recruit 
Observer Staff Report 
The Notre Dame men's bas­ketball team has signed an­

r other recruit to add to a list already ranked 16th by two major scouting bureaus. 
Lamarr Justice, a 6-3, 160­pound guard from Batavia, Ill., averaged 15.0 points, 4.0 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 1.8 steals in leading Batavia High School to a 27-2 record last season. 
He was named the most valuable player in the Little Seven Conference as well as receiving honorable mention all-state honors. He also is an all-state track star and member of Batavia's soccer team. 

"Lamarr has a very strong chance of starting at point guard for us next season. He is a very aggressive type of player," Irish coach Digger Phelps said. "(With) the loss of Tim Singleton to graduation and knowing that Elmer Bennett had problems playing point guard last season, the staff decided we needed a true point guard." 
 
all the way and hit it good." 

Binkiewicz was appreciative of the power surge he gets from aluminum bats. 
"We use wood bats in the fall," said Binkiewicz, "and they make you a better hitter be­cause of the weight distribu­tion. If you don't hit on the meat of a wooden bat, the bat breaks. So you learn to really put the meat of the bat on the ball. If you change to an alu­minum bat and hit the ball square, it really takes off on you. There is no comparison to aluminum." 
This season, Binkiewicz has only tallied 13 base hits-5even of which have been home runs and two of which have been doubles. Additionally, Binkiewicz entered Sunday's action against Xavier (12-24) with a slugging percentage of .750, but left slugging .923. For the weekend, the native of Wintersville, Ohio, went 4-for-9 with four runs scored and six RBI. Danapilis put up similar numbers, going 7-for-11 with four runs scored and six RBI. 
In the nightcap, the Irish con­tinued Notre Dame pounded Xavier starter Tim Lyons early and often, spanking him for four earned runs on four hits and four walks in the first one and 2/3 innings. 
The Irish blew the game open in the seventh inning, as they scored five runs on a stand-up double by pinch-hitter Mike Rooney, an RBI single by Jacobs, a bunt single by Danapilis, a Binkiewicz home run (scoring Jacobs and Danapilis ahead of him) and a Matt Haas solo shot. 

Alan Walania (6-4) pitched the first five innings of Game Two for his second win of the day. This was the second time this season that Walania won both games of a doubleheader. He had previously done so against Saint Mary's (Texas), winning the first game in relief and the second game starting. 
In the second game against Xavier, Walania surrendered three runs (all earned) on seven hits and no walks while fanning two. Chris Michalak (three in­nings) and Joe Binkiewicz (one inning) closed out the game on the mound for Notre Dame. 
"Binkiewicz has been the cat­alyst to our last five wins, one way or another," said Murphy. "Him and Mike Coss have given us a leadership attitude that we've had only sporadically."

Women's tennis migrates south Irish end season with win over Deacons 
By RICH SZABO 
Sports Writer 

In what could be classified as a learning year, the Notre Dame women's tennis team closed out the spring season splitting matches down in Knoxville against Tennessee and Wake Forest.

Though the Volunteers are a safe bet to make the NCAA tournament, the Irish are used to playing this type of national competition. However, the Irish

were overmatched against Tennessee. 
"I was a little disappointed in the way we played against Tennessee," said Irish coach Jay Louderback. "We did not compete very well, but we bounced back well against Wake Forest. 
Against the Demon Deacons, the Irish finally pulled out a close one, winning 5-4. The match was tied 3-3 after sin­gles. Barton defeated Celine Menain 4-6, 6-3, 6-0 at first singles, and Harris beat Karin Dallwitz 6-3, 6-3 at second. Lisa Tholen won the fourth­singles slot for the other Irish singles point, defeating Diane McKeon 6-3, 2-6, 6-3. 
With the match tied 3-3, the doubles matches took front stage. The Irish captured frrst doubles, with Barton and Faustmann beating Menain and Tracy Zawacki 6-3, 6-4. At third doubles, Wake Forest's tandem of Dallwitz and Celine Tournant swept past Kristy Doran and Vitale 6-2, 6-4. 
The match hinged on second doubles. After splitting the frrst two sets 6-7, 6-2, Bende and Tholen won the final set 6-4 over McKeon and Liz Barker to clinch the match for the Irish. 
Notre Dame played a brutal schedule this year, facing 12 teams either ranked or receiv­ing votes in the top-2 5 poll. The Irish compiled a 3-9 record against these teams, which is admirable, considering that this team is very young, and only one of those matches, against LSU, was played at home. 
"Coming in to the year, I did not think we would be ranked," said Louderback. "It was def­initely a surprise. This season will help us for next year, for we've been there, in the top 25, playing ranked teams." 
Senior captain Kim Pacella, playing in her last match, said, "It was very good to win a close match, especially my last match. We finally got a good break. This year we had lots of chances, but we lost a lot of close ones. It was a growing year, and I think next year will be a good year for them. I'll miss playing for Notre Dame."
