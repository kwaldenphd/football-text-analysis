In a fireside chat on· a cold winter to the voters who narrowly elected · night, Carter asked the nation to him, Carter declared, "As Presi­rekindle a spirit of unity like that of dent I will not be able to provide World War II days, so as to cope everything that everyone of you with energy, economic and an array might like.

sense," he said. · 
"Not because of war,. but be­cause we realize that we must" act together to solve our problems and because we are ready to trust one another." · 
Carter spoke first of enelgy, saying that a permanent policy to deal with that problem is one of his most urgent projects. He· praised Congress for its quick passage of the emergency natural gas act he signed hours earlier. . 
"But the real problem -our failure to plan for the future or to take energy conservation seriously -started long before . this winter 
and will take . much longer solve," he said. ''This winter has made us realize that we have to act," said.  to all he.  
Long-term program  

Carter said he will complete by April 20 a long-term energy pro" gram emphasizing ·conservation. He said the nation now . wastes more energy than it imports. 
"We must face the fact that the energy shortage is permanent,'' he said. '~There is no way we can soive it quickly." · 
"But if we all cooperate and make modest sacrifices, ibve learn office." 
·After listing a series of adminis­tration goals ranging from the formulation of a comprehensive energy policy to efforts at bettering relations with the Soviet Union and China, Carter again paid tribute to former President Gerald R. Ford as he concluded his talk with an appeal for "joing efforts and mutual sacrifice." 
"With the help of my predeces­
. sor," he said, "we have come through a very difficult period in our nation's history. Butfor almost ten years, we have not had the sense of common national inte­rest." 
" ... Because ofthe division in our country, many of us cannot remem­her a time when we really felt 
united." 
· Carter pledged anew to foster a sense of national community by conducting "an open administra­tion, with frequent press confer­ences and reports to the people and with 'town hall' meetings across 
. the nation where you can criticize, make suggestions and ask ques­tions." 
The President disclosed that he and his advisers ''are also planning with some of the radio networks live call-in sessions during which I can accept your phone calls and

Reorganized government 

In promising to reorganize what he termed "our confused and wasteful system" of government, Carter said "the place to start is at the top-in the White House." 
"I am reducing the size of the White House staff by nearly one-third and have asked the members ofthe Cabinet to do the same at the top staff level. Soon I will put a ceiling on the number of people employed by federal government agencies. so we can bring the growth of government under con­trol." 
At the outset, as he spoke from a stiff-backed chair before a log fire in the White House library, Carter said he takes "very seriously" his campaign commitments and beli­eves "they were the reason I was elected." 
He said, "I want you to know I intend to carry them out." 
Carter cited the d~"velopment of a national energy policy as "one of our most urgent projects." 
However, he argued that the problem can be dealt with more effectively if Congress agrees to consolidate more than SO different agencies that now have a_ hand in energy policy into a single energy· department "to bring oraer out of this chaos." 
As for his broader energy plan, he said it will emphasize conserva­tion, the development of coal re­serves, increased research on solar energy and the maintenance of "'strict safeguards on necessary atomic energy prod~ction." 
Seeming to suggest that his call for lowered thermostats in winter­time become a permanent part of American life, he said: 
"All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats at 65 degrees during the daytime and 55 degrees at night, we could save half the current shortage of natural gas.'' 
Proposals In Congress 
Carter also placed considerable emphasis on his proposals now before Congress to jack up the economy with a $31-billion, two­year program of tax law changes and job programs. 
"I realize that very few people will think that this total economic plan is perfect," he said. "Many groups would like to see more of one kind of aid and less of another. 
''But I am confident that this is the best type or t>alance plan we can produce for the over-all econo­mic health of the nation. 
"It will produce steady, balan­ced, sustainable growth. It does not ignore inflation to solve unem­ployment or visa versa." 
Contending that he "took office in the middle of the worst economic slowdown in the last 40 years," the President said that high unemploy­ment has been costing the average American family $1,800 a year in income and the U.S. treasury $40 billion annually in revenues. 
In discussing the way govern­ment operates, Carter claimed to have already "eliminated expen­sive and unnecessary luxuries, such as door-to-door limousine service for many officials," includ­ing his key White House aides. 
"Government officials can't be sensitive to your problems if we are living like royalty here in Washing­ton," he said. 
Carter at that point voiced a request that American refrain from sending gifts to him or members of his family, "while I am deeply grateful for the many good wishes that lie behind them." 
The President promised that he would work to cut down govern­

Federal relief due for Indiana 
INDIANAPOUS [AP] President 
Carter ordered federal aid for 
weather-beaten Indiana on Wed­
nesday and considered declaring 
the state a disaster area as the 
worsening energy crisis threatened 
homes heated by kerosene. 
State Energy Director Thomas 
Kibler said 195 homes in the 
Richmond area near the Ohio 
border and an undetermined num­
ber of others near Columbus were 
out of kerosene. There were 
contingency plans to house those 
families in National Guard shelters, 
but for the time being most were 
heated by burning wood, instead of 
kerosene, in stoves. 
Richmond Mayor Clifford Dick-
man also said his city, the state's 
13th largest with a population of 
44,000, was critically short of fuel 
oil, with about a two-week supply. 
Downtown businesses and shop­
ping centers agreed to cut their 
hours to 42-54 a week, instead of 
the normal 60-72, to conserve fuel. 
Still recovering from last week's 
blizzard and fuel shortages caused 
by, the coldest winter in history, 
Hoosiers braced for more bad 
weather Wednesday night and 
Thursday. The National Weather· 
Service· forecast one to three inches of new show, mixed with ·freezing rain and sleet in central 
and southern Indiana. 
Responding to a request from 
Gov. Otis_ B. Bowen on Monday, 
Carter declared a state of emer­
gency in Indiana because of the 
impact of ice and snow on vital 
transportations arteries within the 
state. The action will make federal 
aid available for relief efforts in' 
areas designated by the Federal 
Disaster Assistance Administration 
FDAA. An FDAA spokesman said an­other Bowen request to declare the state a major disaster area was pending. William J. Watt, the 
'governor's chief energy adviser, said he expected the disaster declaration to come yet this week, making farmers, businessmen, cities and towns eligible for federal money to recover their losses from the cold winter and energy short­age. 
A White House spokesman said . the emergency aid ordered by . Carter will be used to reopen ''vital supply routes to agricultural, educa­
tional, governmental, commercial and industrial establishments and such other emergency systems as· may be required to save lives and protect property, public health and safety." 
The first five counties declared eligible for help were Cass, La ..Grange, Fulton, Jay andSt. Joseph 
· but an aide to Sen. Birch Bayh, D-Ind., said more will be named later. Watt also said he had a verbal commitment from-the Federal Energy Administration to seek emergency allocations of kerosene for the state. He said even if extra kerosene is found, it will ta.ke two to four days to distribute it. Besides the 195 families without kerosene, Kibler said others have only a 24-hour supply. The average family uses about 10-15 gallons of kerosene per day, he added. 
The Richmond and Columbus areas were the first to report their supplies had run out, but Kibler said others might follow if the cold weather continues and additional kerosene is slow in coming. He 
_said more than 433,000 homes in Indiana are heated with fuel oil and kerosene 
Mary Jackson, director of the Wayne County Community Action Commission in Richmond, said about 700 homes in the area are . threatened by the shortage. "We are out of No. 1 oil kerosene, just out period,'' she said. 
Her office is prepared to move families to shelters, and provide food and blankets, but "thus far we've been able to get wood for them to burn in their stoves and people are keeping warm to the degree they're not ready to move out of their homes," Mrs. Jackson said. 
Mayor Dickman urged all resi­dents to turn their thermostats to 60 degrees and called on the governor· and the legislature to "put teeth in fuel conservation measures." 
He said most distributiors have the same allocations as last year, when the winter was much milder. Richmond's largest oil dealer, Douglas Warfield, told reporters after meeting with the mayor that his February allocation is 460,000 gallons. He sold about one million in January alone, Warfield said. 
"I know it's somewhat shocking and sudden, but we've definitely got a serious fuel porblem due to a shortage of oil, and I know other agencies' action will soon show people it's no joke," Dickman said. · 
"The dealers are laying all their ..:ards on the table. There's no oil." 
Meanwhile, the State Employ­ment Security Division said about 1,200 workers laid off because of fuel shortages in the last week were recalled to, their jobs Tuesday and Wednesday, most of them in Fort Wayne, _Muncie and Indianapolis. But that still left at least 50,800 out of work, officials said.

Appeal pending · 


Court case threatens Affirmative Action 
by Bonnie Solow and David Osbome Paciftc News Service 

Legal experts say it could be the most important civil rights case in 20 years. Black, Chicano and other minority critics say it's a set-up. 
The case is Bakke v. the Regents of the University of California (UC). 
In a landmark decision last September, the California Supreme Court ruled the special admissions program forminorities at UC-Davis Medical School was unconstitution­al because it discriminated against whites. 
Minorities charge that the de­fendant, UC, never tried to win the case. And now that the University has appealed the decision to the 
U.S. Supreme Court, these same critics fear that an inadequate defense could hurt every affirma­tive action program in the nation. 
While activist critics are organiz­ing public demonstrations, a coali­tion including the United Auto Workers, the National Urban Lea­gue, the ational Conference of Black Lawyers and the Mexican­American Legal Defense and Edu­cation Fund has filed a brief they hope will persuade the Supreme Court not to take the case. 
The high court has stayed the California court's ruling, indicating it will probably take the case. Should it uphold the California decision, say Prof. Ralph Smith of the National Conference of Black 
Lawyers  and  the  University  of  
Pennsylvania  Law  School,  "It  
would have  a  catastrophic effect,  

wiping out (special admissions) programs all over the country" and spilling over to threaten affirmative 
·action job programs. T~ case stems trom a charge by Allen Bakke, a white who w!ls twice,, 
rejected by the UC-Davis Medical I School, that his Fourteenth_ Amendments-rights to equal pro-M tection under the law had been i violated. 
Bakke contends he was rejected 
solely because the UC-Davis spe­
cial admissions program, which · reserves 10 out of 100 places for 
minorities, let a less qualified 
minority student take his place. 
His suit resulted in a California 
ruling that a qualified white cann.:~t 
be refused admission so that a less 
qualified minority person can be 
educated. 
Reagan appointees influential 
Many minority lawyers believe the UC Regents, dominated by conservative appointiees of ex­governor Ronald Reagan, chose not to present a strong defense of minority admissions programs. 
"The University's primary effort was not to win," but "to obtain a definitive rule on its special admis­sions program," says Armando Menocal, a lawyer for one of the nation's largest public interest Jaw firms, Public Advocates. 
''All the University had to Jose was a program they never wanted," adds University of San Francisco Law Professor Charles Lawrence. 
UC presented as evidence only one affidavit and one deposition, both from UC-Davis, Admissions Director Dr. George Lowrey, It gave no oral testimot:ty and called no expert witnesses or members of the minority communities involved. 
"To allow a case of the magni­tude and impact of Bakke to be decided without an opportunity for minorities to present vital evi­dence ... is a travesty of justice," 
Accounting students offer income tax assistance 
Jean Powley Staff Reporter 

For the fifth consecutive year, Notre Dame's Department of Ac­countancy is sponsoring a Tax Assistance Program (TAP) to pro­vide free income tax preparation service to low-income individuals in the South Bend area. 
The 43 senior accounting majors involved in the three credit pass/­fail course will work one evening a week in one of the nine centers around the city. At least on ecenter will be open every night of the week through April 15, except Sundays. 
The two basic purposes of TAP are to help low-income families prepare their tax returns and to give accounting students their first tax esperience out in the "real world," stated Kenneth milani, assistant professor of accounancy and faculty coordinator for TAP. 
"The students really seem to enjoy it (the program). In fact, some students even decide to go into taxes when they're through, which is the best feedback in the world," Milani said. 
TAP has become so popular that over 150 students applied for the program and a lottery had to be used to choose the 43 participants. 
Begun by an MBA student and a law student in 1972, TAP was originally designed to assist low income taxpayers who were not aware of Indiana's eight-dollar per person state sales tax credit. Although the tax credit was later rescinded, the program continued because it was discovered that these taxpayers needed assistance on the tax eturn itself. 
In 1973 the College of Business Administration adopted TAP as its own project and the Department of Accountancy took charge of the program, which is different from a strictly voluntary basis. later it was incorporated into the curricu­lum as a three credit work-study program because of the great amount of time involved. 
Last year, approximately 800 returns were completed by stu­dents in the program, obtaining about $100,000 in refunds for their clients. Milani estimated that roughly 500 taxpayers were reach­
ed by the project. 
TAP has neverhad a tax return come back from the Internal Reve­nue Service(IRS) because of a mistake. Milani explained, how­ever, that thereis very little chance of either an IRS audit or a serious 
mistake with returns of low-income families. 
The feedback from clients has been "fantastic," Milani said. There have been many letters thanking the students and have been "asked to return time and time again by several organiza­
tions," Miller added. Milani said the program has been so successfu that he will continue it as long as he is teaching at Notre Dame. "I put a very high priority on this program during the second semester of each year," he emphasized. 
RA open house planned at SMC 
Last weekend's snow storm can­celled the open house scheduled for Saint Mary's advisor applicants. This Sunday, Feb. 6, applicants are encouraged to visit the halls from 2 to 4 p.m. 
The purpose of the open house is to give applicants the opportunity to meet the hall directors in each hall as well as consulting with the current resident advisor staff. 
writes Charles Lawrence in a legal journal attack on Bakke. 
Some minority lawyers have even suggested there was a collu­sion between UC and Bakke. Most also believe UC put up too weak a legal case to risk a U.S. Supreme Court precedent on the minority admissions. 
''This is a terribly important question for this society," says the National Conference of Black Law­yer's Ralph Smith. "It's one the Supreme Court will have to rule on. 
But the issues should be presented fairly and clearly to the Court. The Bakke case doesn't do this." 
Donald Reidhaar, chief attorney for the UC Regents, denies the University presented a weak case. The written evidence submitted to the court by UC, he said, "includ­ed a great deal of statistical information and documentation." 
"The case fairly and squarely presents the issue of admissabi­lity" of UC's special program for minorities, he says. "The (U.S. Supreme) Court will find some way to rule without undermining the programs." 
The California Ruling 

The California Supreme Court's ruling in favor of Bakke was based on three conclusions . First, it ruled that Bakke was better quali­fied than the minority students admitted under UC-Davis 's special program -a point disputed by UC. 
Minority lawyers object to this conclusion, arguing that the stan­dardized tests and grade point averages that maKe up a good part of UC's criteria for admission are culturally biased against non­whites. 
The court's second conclusion was that UC.Davis was not guilty of "past discrimination." The Su­preme Court has often required proof of such past discrimination before ruling affirmative action programs ·constitutional. 
In this case, UC took tne position that it had not discriminated in the past, a stand that has led to the most bitter criticism from minori­ties, who believe it severely weak­ened UC's case. 
They think UC could easily have proved past discriminaion, but did not because it was unwilling to accuse itself publicly. 
While the California Supreme Court was considering the case, the American Medical School's first year, 1968, it admitted no black or Chicano students, and the next year only one Chicano and two blacks were enrolled among a class of SO. 


Comparing this to the fact that blacks and Chicanos make up 20 percent of California's population, the brief argued that Davis "had no choice but to take affirmative action to remedy the de facto segrega­tion." 
UC lawyer Reidnaar responds that although the school's use of test scores and grades resulted in "nearly all white classes," there was "never any intent on the part of the school to discriminate against minorities." 
Other minority lawyers have argued that UC could have pointed to past discrimination in the ele­mentary and secondary schools feeding into the University of California system. 
James Bell, a spokesman for the Black Law Students Association at UC's Hastings College of Law, points to one reason UC may have taken its stand. "The UC Regents couldn't admit they discriminated in the past or they would have been subject to suits from third world people," he charges. 
Finally, the California court con­cluded that UC had failed to prove that a special admissions program based on race was the option open to UC that least discriminated against whites. For racial admis­sions programs, the courts require that a school prove there is "a compelling state interest" requir­ing the program and that there is no alternative to racial classifica­tions. 
In this case, the court agreed that there was a compelling state interest in integrating the medical school but suggested alternatives such as setting up a special program for the economically, ra­ther than racially disadvantaged. 
Some minority lawyers in Cali­fornia believe such alternatives can be designed, though they doubt they will be as effective as racial quotas. But they fear that the conservative U.S. Supreme Court will take a much broader sweep, closing off even these options. 
If that happens, law and medical school deans across the country agree; there will be almost no minority students left in their schools.

Lawyers say Ray acted alone 
WASHINGTON [AP]  After a ten-month review, a team of Jus­tice Department lawyers has con­cluded that James Earl Ray acted alone in the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, informed de­partment sources said yesterday.

"Soon I will put a ceiling on the number of people by federal go­vernment agencies so we can bring the growth of government under control," he said. 
Carter also said his administra­tion would attempt to promote respect for human rights abroad but not to the point where it jeopardized friendly relations with other countries. 
He noted the State Department already had informed the Soviet Union it disaeproved of that coun­try's efforts to repress Soviet human rights activist Andrei Sakharov. 
"We will continue to express our concern about violations of human rights, as we have during the last week, without upsetting our efforts toward friendly relations with other countries," the President said. 
"I want our nation's actions abroad to make you proud." 
Carter noted he had pledged during his campaign to maintain a strong defense and said he intend­ed to have a "strong lean, efficient fighting force." 
The lawyers rejectedtheoriesthat Ray was only a cog in a conspiracy to assassinate the Nobel Prize­winning civil rights leader, the sources said. 
The team of lawyers from the department'li Office of Professional Responsibility delivered its report to former Atty. Gen. Edward H. Levi shortly before he left office Jan. 20. 
The department plans to make public a "sanitized version" of the report, deleting names of informers and other sensitive material, the 
. sources said. . But the public release has been delayed because department offi­~ials want to avoid the a~ral!.£e_ 
of trying to influence the House of Representatives in its debate about launching a lengthy and costly new invstigation of the murders of King and President John F. Kennedy. 
When the House completes its action, the department will release its own report. 
King was shot to death on a motel balcony in Memphis in April 1968. 
Ray pleaded guilty to King's murder. But he told the court he did not agree with statements by the prosecution and his own attor­ney that there was no conspiracy in the case.

Officials deny dangerous DNA experiments 
by Barb laDghemy Senior Staff Reporter and Drew Bauer Staff Reporter 
Allegations that Notre Dame is under contract with Miles Labora­tories and is "secretly experimen­ting with a dangerous and highly volitile technology called recombin­ant DNA" have been dismissed by University officials. 
Jerry Rifkin of the Peoples Business Commission (PBC) has written a _letter accusing the Uni­

-versity of experimenting with recombinant DNA "to artificially produce novel new 'forms of life' never before existent in the_ natural evolutionary order." The letter has been distributed to several halls on campus. Alumni 
Hall reportedly had 200 copies of the letter put under the room doors. 
Dr. Robert J. Erickson, assistant faculty fellow in microbiology, who is presently conducting research supported by Miles Laboratories, stated that his work is "simply a continuation of studies on the genetics of bacteria, specifically of the genus Bacilli, that were started over 20 years ago." 
"At the present time there are no 'recombinant DNA' experi­ments being performed by Miles personnel at the University of Notre Dame," declared Erickson. 
Richard W. Conklin, director of Information Services, stated, "The research being conducted by Dr. Robert J. Erickson is not the kind of DNA research which has caused 2ontroversy at other uf!!\'_ersities. 
The DNA issue was spurred by debates in Cambridge, Mass. last summer when the city council voted a moratorium on the research after critics described the possible hazards to Mayor Alfred E. Vel­lucci. 
An article in The Chronicle of IDgher Education explained that studies known as "recombinant DNA" research involve combining a strip of genes from a cell of a higher organism with the genes in a lower organism, such as a bacteria, so that the foreign genes can be studied in a simpler environment.'' 
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is 
the basic building block of genes, which are the units that control heredity. 
Conklin feels that the PBC picked up the description of the University's involvement in DNA research from an erroneous des­cription in New Times Magazine, which stated that Notre Dame was conducting secret research in this field. "Dr. Erickson's research is not secret. He intends to publish the results of his research," Conk­lin stated. 
Another possible origin of the letter distributed by Rifkin may be a call Dr. Morris Pollard, chairman of the department of Microbiology, received from PBC. According to Pollard, he was asked if there was any genetic or biological research being done at the university. Pollard answered that there was, but that he couldn't say anymore and that the caller should talk to Miles. 
Alcoholism Week events planned 
by Joan Fremeau 
"The worst thing you can do about alcoholism is nothing" is the theme of Alcoholism Action Week (AAW), Feb. 6-13, an alcohol awareness campaign sponsored by St. Joseph County Alcoholism Council, stated Theresa Kline of the Alcoholism Council of St. Joseph County. 
Indiana's Governor Otis R. Bo­wen proclaimes February as Alco­holism Awareness and Action Month, the first state-wide effort to increase awareness concerning al­coholism and its effects. 
Action is the key to the local program, emphasized Kline. "We will encourage alcoholics and their families to take positive action against this disease." , 
"Ignorance about alcoholism, or covering up the problem only makes treatment more difficult. Our goal is to make people examine their attitudes, inform them of the symptoms, and get them to seek help as soon as possible," Kline explained. 
Throughout the week, local chur­ches, media, and schools will participate in the campaign. Feb.6 is Alcoholism Action Sunday in area churches. "Inserts on alcohol­ism will appear in many church bulletins, and clergy have been asked to talk on the subject at services," explained Peggy Cron­in, alcohol and drug counselor at the Notre Dame Infirmary. 

Sunday at 4:30p.m., WNDU-TV will present "Living Sober: The Class of '76," a documentarry taped at a California garden party including interviews with recover­ing alcoholics from all walks of life. 
WNDU will also sponsor a five­part feature series entitled "Young Drunks". Produced by Marcia Ladendorff of WNDU News, the series will consider the increasing incidence of teenage drinking and focus on reasons for teen drinking and alcoholism, the role of parents and where teens can find help in their community. The series will appear on the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. news broadcasts beginning Mon­day Feb. 7. 
WSBT-TV will also devote time to AAW. Monday morning, view­ers will ~~_able to phQne questions llbout alcoholism to "The Dorothy Frisk Show.'' ''The Afternoon Show" will also consider the pt;ob­Iems of alcoholism.

Handicap needs discussed 
by John O'Donnell 
Efforts are being made to help alleviate the University's physical · barriers to the handicapped, accor­ding to Bernie Cantu, president of the committee for Integration of Physically Handicapped (CIPH). 
"Institutions of higher lear­ning," Cantu states, "should be accessible to everyone, not just those of 'perfect health' ". 
Last year, under the direction of Jill Robinson, this committee dealt with the architectural problems that face the handicapped. CIPH met with the administration to discuss making buildings on cam­pus more accessible to handicap­ped. They also discussed lowering the curbs. 
The efforts of last year, accor­ding to Cantu, were a success. Over the summer the curbs were cut at the comers of the ACC and the Post Office Ramps were also constructed leading to the Hayes­Heady Building and at the rear of the Nieuwland Science Hall. 
-. 

The CIPH plans to meet in two weeks. Cantu indicated that the committee will work with ACC officials to provide reserve seating areas for the handicapped at foot­ball and basketball games. Com­plaints have been received from visiting spectators that no reserved space is allocated for the handi­capped, and Cantu stated that CIPH intends to eliminate this , problem. 
CIPH wi11 also discuss security in the parking lots. Cantu stressed that the handicapped should be allowed to drive on campus, but are presently denied this right. 
Cantu further mentioned that other things need to be done, such as the transferring of classes from the fourth floor of the Administra­tion Building for those who are handicapped. In order to meet these objectives, CIPH will nego­tiate with the Registrar's Office. 
CIPH holds meetings approxi­mately once a month. Anyone interested in joining CIPH should contact either Cantu, 1222, or Jill Robinson. 287-8253.

Edward W. (Moose) Krause, .director of athletics, is honorary chairman of Alcoholism Awareness 
and Action Month as well as the St. Joseph Alcoholism Council chair­man. Involved in the Alcoholism Council for eight years, Krause has 
been influential in seeking state aid 
for treatment centers and counsel­ing programs. 
Expressing his concern Krause 
said, "Alcoholism is a serious
disease, afflicting millions of peo­pie, their families and their jobs. fhere is a stigma attached to the alcoholic as a 'skid row bum.' Actually, the 'bum' is a minority. Alcoholism strikes people in all walks of life, regardless of age of position." 
-The main thrust of this week's program is to educate the public about the dangers of alcoholism, and about available help, Krause noted. "Statistics show that a good percentage of alcoholics do recover with proper treatment. There is a way out," he concluded. 
South Bend is considered to have one of the best rehabilitation programs in the state, noted Kline. There are many facilities for treat­ment and for family counseling, she stated.

Recruiting: a pressure business 

by Monte Towle Sports Writer 
The foUowing is the third in a four-part series concerning coUege recruiting of high school athletes. The final segment wHl appear tomorrow. 
Albert King is a 6'6" high school senior in a Brooklyn school. He also happens to be one of the best high school basketball players in the country. As written in a Sports IDustrated issue last August, " ...e­very college in the country that wants a national basketball cham­pionship is after him ... they have been watching him since he was 14; that's when the terrible pres­sures began to build." 
Often overlooked in the college 
· recruiting business is the tremen­dous pressure felt by some of the top prospects as they are recruited by colleges all over the country. What most recruiters don't realize is that these high school players are only teenagers still growing up while still trying to take in their respective high school lives. Some coaches are not only unsympathetic with the pressures felt by the high school prospects, they expect them to handle it in stride. "I think all high school kids survive the recruiting process," Washington State's George Ravel­ing expressed. "We don't live in the cotton candy existence that educators like to expound. These kids have to learn that college sports recruiting is big business. How life is really lived and how it should be lived are two different things." Albert King began experiencing the big business life when he was only 14 years old. The younger brother of Tennessee star Bernard King, Albert caught the eye of scouts with his extraordinary skills at an early age. The Sports mustrated article gave an indication of the younger King's talents by quoting George Murden, a coach in the Bedford­Stuyvesant Restoration's youth division. "He's much better than either Abdui-Jabbar or Connie Hawkins was at that age (14)," he said. "In fact, I believe he's better than any high school player in the city right now." King certainly was a basketball star at this early age, having the ability to dribble, shoot and dunk the ball in various manners remini­scent of a present day Julius Erving. Word was quickly out on 

his unique ·basketball abilities and it wasn't long before he found himself unable to hide from ·the. pressures of the sports world. Everybody wanted to know him, to touch him, to play basketball with him. Even high schools were · recruiting him. . 
One high school wanted him to come so that he could escape the_ ghetto environment he was in. It . was so bad, that the entire town was after him. Not only were·they ready to make him· mayor,. the wealthy citizens of the eastern tow:n . were ready to back him with free clothes, free food, an apart~ent and other luxuries And this was only high school! · 
For a period of time, Albert King went into seclusion, seeking to avoid the pressures which were bound to destroy him before he was out of high school. They didn't. Today, he is a senior at · Fort Hamilton High School; one of. the nation's best players on.an average high school team. He is probably . the most highly recruited player in the nation right now. ·. 
Not only is the. New York area a favorite of college basketball re-. cruiters, there are many parts of the country that produce their fair share of players. Various coaches have their own favorite regions for searching for future talent. 
Vermont coach Pete Salzberg is content to concentrate his searches· within the confines of the East. 
"We set up our recruiting on a geographical basis," Salzberg des­cribed. "We concentrate our re­cruiting in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and New Eng­land. Beyond this area, we only go after those players taller than 6'7", We can get enough shorter players around here." · 
Salzberg does admit that Califor-. nia probably has the most good high school basketball players in the country. However, he and · Villanova coach Rollie Massimino are quick to point out that the supply of high school players has grown much larger in recent years because there are more people available to play the sport. . 
Meanwhile, UCLA coach Gene Bartow sees a variation in the inost productive regions of the country unlike Washington State coach George Raveling who sticks to the Midwest for his main supply of talent. 
''The most productive region of · the country varies from year to year," Bartow theorized. "One year it can be the West Coast 
-by its electrical scoring, which 
. designates when the touches hit, and if the touches ate in a valid target area. . The entire torso, front and back, 
comprises the valid target area. This excludes the head, arms, and whereas. in another year it could be the Midwestor the East." 
"One highly recruited California native who chose to head Midwest to play for Notre Dame instead of 
· staying near· home is Rich Bran­iting. Now.a freshman guard for the Fighting Irish,. Branning was re­cognized around the country as a bonafide blue chipper, the type of prospect who could help a college team immediately. While being recruited; Branning was able to ward off the pressur;es that accom­pariy otller high school products 
. like him-Albert King for instance. 
"I 'started being scouted be­tween my ·.sophomore and junior years in high school," recalled 'Bt:aiming. "But it wasn't until after my junior year that college coaches teally·began talking to me. When I look back,· I can say that recruiting ·was an enjoyable thing for me. I 
· guess I was lucky.'' 

Maybe some luck, but it pro­babl)f had something to do with the organizational work carried out by the-California native along with his parents and coach. In this way, Branning .was able to ward off incessant -pe&tering of coaches while concentrating on his school­work and playing basketball his senior year. · 
"'My parents, coach and I met before my senior year and began to set some guidelines," Branning .stated. "Coac;:hes knew if they didn't follow the rules, then I would 
drop  consideration  for  their  
schools.".  ·  
Once  his  high  school  began  

_practice on 'November 1 of his secnior year, Branning limited himself to accepting only one coach's call per weekend. When the season actually began, the 6'3" guard· no longer accepted any phone calls. Only his parents and coach were· allowed to talk to coaches over the phone. · "Aslong as schools kept in touch with me through letters, then I kept them in my considerations," Bran­ning admitted. "Eventually though, I narrowed my prospective list to 25 schools; those that really 
-showed interest in me. I would have been wasting both my time · and the time of the school if I had kept them hanging on the line even 
Women fencers prepare 
by EUeen O'Grady ND Women's Sports Editor 

One of the most successful women's teams at Notre Dame is the women's varsity fencing team . 
.At the same time, it is probably the least well known. 
This year;s squad returns with definite ·contenders for the Great Lakes Tournament and other Wo­men's National Tournaments, as well. They deserve some attention. 
Since the varsity ruling last May, 
. the former ND-SMC fencing club split into two separate teams. The Irish team now consists of: Cathy Buzard, Terri Foley, Karen Lacity, Chris Marciniak, Trish O'Donnel, and Kathy Valdiserri. All but Foley return experienced to the squad. 
Valdiserri is the real veteran of the ·team. A former Great Lakes Fencing Champion, and winner of the Indiana State Divisionals for two ~onsecutive years; she captains the women again this year. 
Coach Tom Coye calls her a "hard competitor and the mainstay ofthe team." He adds: "I expect an excellent performance from her during the regular season and in the Great Lakes Competition again this year." 
All the women compete only in foil competition, unlike the men who fence foil, epee, and sabre.
