jailed Times reporter's sentence 
HACKENSACK, N.J. [AP]­New York Times reporter Myron Farber was released from jail yesterday after the State Supreme Court stayed his indefinite jail sentence pending an appeal of his contempt conviction. 
"I'm delighted to be out," Farber said. "It's enormously gratifying of the Supreme Court of New Jersey to take up the matter." 

Farber, accompanied by execu­tives and lawyers for the Times, said he believes he will be vindi­cated of contempt for not turning 
over his notes  on  a  widely publi­ 
cized murder case.  
The  court  stayed  all  civil  and  

criminal penalties against Farber and the Times pending an appeal of their contempt citations. 
As a result of the ruling, Farber was ordered released and a $5,000

Bland explains new fire regulations 
by Mark Rust Staff Reporter 

It appears as though students are following the newly defined fire regulations, according to Fire Chief Jack Bland. "I doubt at this time that we'll have an inspection," he stated yesterday, noting that most campus room construction will be finishin_g this weekend. 
"I've been  around  to  
several halls  so far," sa id  
Bland,  "and  they  all  seem  to  

understand what the regulations 
are.'' 
The regulations --primarily new­ly defined terms in DuLac for room design and appendage --had been a source of confusion for a number of students as the school term began. 
"What can be hard to under­stand?," Bland asked. "All the rules are spelled out in DuLac. It's all there and very clear on page 40 --as clear as we could get it." 
Many students have not yet received their copies of DuLac though, according to Bland. they should by next week. For students who have not read their copy yet, ~land offered a sampler of regula­tions. 
"Elevated beds are allowed, as long as they are at least 36 inches 
from the ceiling and not connected to the wall," he said. "Lofts, defined as a ceiling or room within a room, are illegal as are para­
chutes or fishnets draped from the ceilin_g." 
Bland was also rather specific on panelling --it is not allowed --but was less strong in his interpretation on the application of the rules to the use of corkboards in rooms, especially that which is used to hide lockers that divide a room. 
"Look, we don't want to get real technical," he concluded, "we just want to provide maximum protec­tion while allowing students maxi­mum freedom. We hope everyone will use their head in complying with the rules. We want to create an atmosphere of trust and cooper­ation." 
Bland pointed out that last year's Providence University fire --in which seven co-eds were killed -­was a "surface" fire. 
"And that." Bland observed, "is what theseregulationstry to protect against; surface fire. It is the most common type of fire in our institu­tion." 
The fire department plans to publish and distribute among stu­dents an additional "Fire Safety" sheet to provide them with added information on fire prevention. 
Senior Bar remodels 
by Joe Slovinec 

According to Senior Bar manager Pat Jordan. the Senior Bar is 
"trying  to  appeal  to  as  many  
people  as  possible by  having  a  
different  atmosphere."  with  the  

addition of two bars and a disco dance floor upstairs. a dining area. and a game room in the basement. 
The Senior Bar. which opens this evening, has made many changes in its facilities for its members and guests this year. 
In addition to the new disco dance floor. complete with disc­jockey stand, the Senior Bar staff placed new curtains, walpaper, plumbing fixtures and a vanity in the girl's washroom. "We are adding a new dining area with a hamburger grill," Jordan said. Plaques of Notre Dame football teams from the past forty years will decorate the walls of the dining area. The basement, which previ­ously contained only pipes and furnaces. has been converted into a game room, complete with wall stucco paint and paneling. Patrons can now enjoy bowling. pinball, a juke box, and a pool table in the game room. 
The exterior bar has been con­verted into a beer garden filled with sand. The beer garden has benches and railroad ties around the bushes and trees to "beautify it," and make it possible for people to "relax out there." .Jordan said. 
The remodeling cost $25,000. 
"We had 35 people here ten days early to fix up the whole place," Jordan said. "The bar opened on registration day. which is the earliest the Senior Bar has ever opened. 
The Senior Bar staff wants to try and"make it a quality place rather than just a drinking hall." Jordan said. As a result. 1300 bar cards have been sold thus far, which is 450 ahead of last year, and it is expected that more will be sold. 
"Expectations have been met" in the success of the Senior Bar, Jordan said. He concluded, "We have got more than the South Bend bars and we appeal to a better cross-section, despite the fact that Fat Wallys has reopened. We honestly feel that we have put a great place together. We feel that we have put in the work and it is going to pay off. We are looking forward to another great year." 
Grand Opening 

The Senior Bar will hold it. Grand Opening celebration tonigh at 8 p.m. with specials all night long. The bar features a new gameroom located in the base­ment. Door prizes will also be awarded.

New rectors, assistants join staffs 
by Ann Gales News Editor 

Seven new rectors --in Alumni, Carroll, Fl'anner, Grace, Lewis, Morrissey and Sorin Halls --and 15 new assistant rectors have joined the residence hall head staff this semester. 
Only the head staffs of Breen Phillips, Farley, Fischer, Howard Lyons, Stanford and Walsb ··seven of Notre Dame's 22 dorms -­maintain continuity in the hall staffs as much as possible." 
Green added, however, that he was fortunate in finding highly qualified persons to fill the posi­tions vacated by the resigning rectors and assistant rectors. 
In Alumni, Fr. George Rozum, assistant rector of Holy Cross last year, replaced Bro. John Benesh as rector. Benesh, who also served as the director of student activities, who also served as dtrector of Student Housing. Mahoney, from Louisville, KY, is pursuing a graduate degree at Notre Dame. Mulcahy is presently teaching at Notre Dame High School in Niles. 
Replacing Fr. Thomas Splain, who has returned to the University of San Francisco, as rector of Grace Hall is Bro. Charles Burke. Burke has worked for -several different Notre Dame offices, including the Notre Dame Counseling Center and D.C. Luther served as house manager at Moreau Seminary for several years. 
David. Porterfield, who will be ordained a priest this spring, has replaced Fr. KeVin Kearny -as rector of Sorin. Kearny will pursue a doctral degree in Chemistry at Yale University. 
The 15 new assistant rectors include: Sheila Murphy, Badin; Fr. John Reedy, Carroll; Fr. David Fedor, Cavanaugh; Father Michael McCafferty, Dillon; Peter Greco and Fr. Oliver Wiliams, Flanner; Robert Gabriele, Grace; Bro. David Warnke, Holy Cross; Jaime Saavedra, Keenan; Mary St. Ville, Lewis; Daniel Buckley, Morrissey; Bro. John Doran, Pangborn; Bro. Mark Cavanaugh, St. Ed's; Fr. Donald Kemper, Sorin; and Phillip McKiernan, Zahm. 

remain unchanged. According to Father Greg Green, assistant vice­president for Student Affairs, this represents "an unusually high 45 percent change in the head staff since last year." 
Green attributed the high turn­over rate mainly to former staff personnel completing their studies at Notre Dame and leaving. He termed this year's high turnover ''unfortunate,'' stating that ''for the most part we have a desire to

ND recieves grant for new galler 
Notre Dame has received a gift of $250,000 from Walter R. Beardsley to endow a new gallery of Twenti­eth Century art. 
The Walter R. Beardsley Endow­ment for Modern Art will enable the University to display many of its Twentieth Century treasures that long have been relegated to vaults because of the inadequacy of present facilities. The Beardsley Gallery will occupy half of the second floor of the Snite Museum of Art, a $2 million expansion of the present O'Shaughnessy Hall gallery scheduled to open next year. 
In accepting the benefaction, University President Fr. Theodore Hesburgh said; ''The Beardsley endowment is a splendid vehicle for fine arts education and will bring great pleasure not only to our students but also to the art public served by our museum. The endowment will enable us to achieve a degree of professionalism and distinction in our galleries that is consistent with the goals of the University." 

' .... 

Beardsiey served as Chairman of the Board of Miles Laboratories, Elkhart, In., from 1961 to 1973. 
In 1968, Beardsley became a charter member of the Art Gallery's Advisory Council. That year, the Art Gallery exhibited several works from his private collections, including paintings and sculptures by Rodin, O'Keeffe and Chagall. For the last decade

Vikings, Oilers to rule in Central' 
(continued from page B) CHICAGO BEARS-The Bears have had a poor pre-season, but they may be able to turn around before the season gets started. Walter Payton is in the franchise, as he goes so goes the team. Hopefully, Payton's shoulder problems will not affect his ball-carrying ability. If he is not able to perform close to last year's standards, the Bears may be in trouble. 
As for the rest of the offense, Bob Avellini has yet to prove that he is a major le.;tgue quarterback. Handing-off is an easy job, it's his passing which is not quite up to snuff. James Scott is the best Bear wideout. The offensive line was the heart of the offense last season and it should remain so this year. Center Dan Peiffer will be missed. Noah Jackson, Revie Sorey, Ted Albrecht, and Dennis Lick are all young and strong. Barring injury, they should be able to work as a unit for a long time. 
The Bears defense has some question marks. Waymond Bryant was put on the injured reserve list and is not available for this season. The Bears linebacking corps was thin before the Joss of Bryant. The defensive line has no real star now that Wally Chambers has departed. The secondary is now the best part of the defense. Safties Gary Fencik and Doug Plank are probably the second best set of deep backs in the league after the Cowboys' Waters and Harris. 
The Bears' season depends on Payton and the linebacking crew. If Payton is healthy and two players are found to aid Doug Buffone behind the line, the Bears may be in business. Look for about a .500 season in Chicago. DETROIT LIONS-Monte Clark moves in to coach the Lions this year and he will be rebuilding. The Lions have been an average NFL team for the past few years, they win a few tight games, lose a few other and end up 
just south of a .500 record. 
The Lion offense has two of the best tight ends in the

league. Charlie Young, the old man, has had many fine years in pro ball and he still has a few left. Upstart .::>avid Hill is just beginning to make his mark around the league. They both should see a lot of action. The quarterback should be Greg Landry, who has distin­guished himself more as arunner than as a passer. Running backs Dexter Bussey and Lawrence Gaines provide a more than adequate ground game. 
The Lions offensive line is average. 
The heart of the Lions defense is their linebacking. Paul Naumoff, Ed O'Neill and Charlie Weaver have a lot of playing experience. The secondary is improving with James Hunter and former Notre Dame All-Am­erican Luther Bradley moving in. Larry Hand is the steadiest performer on the defensive line. 
Clark's first year should be one of gettin acquainted in Detroit with the Lions finishing with six or seven wins. TAMPA BAY BUCANEERS-The Bucs have been one of the worst teams in football over the past few seasons, but this year they may begin to climb out of that hole. 
The best part of the team is its defense. LeRoy Selmon is a fine defensive end and Dave Peer is a good defensive tackle. Add Wally Chambers and Ernie Holmes, if he can shed some weight, to this group and you have the line of a championship team. The linebackers aren't bad either. Richard Wood is better as a Buc than he ever was as a _Jet and Dewey Selmon seems to have adjusted well to the middle linebacker position. Mike Washington is the best defensive back.

to season slump 
Tampa Bay had problems scoring points last year and 
they probably won't score a whole lot of points this 
year, but they whould be improved. Doug Williams 
~oldout did not help his chances at quarterback:but he 
ts the man for ~h future. He should ·win the job later in 
the season. Rtcky Bell had an average rookie season 
but he may be rea~y to break loose. He needs blocking 
though and that ts not the Bucs long suit. Morris 
Owens has been the best Tampa receiver for their first 
two seasons. Jimmy Giles, acquired from Houston 
should help. ' 
The Bucs finished last season with their first two 
wins ever; they should be able to improve on that 
record this vear. 

GREEN BA-Y PACKERS-Will the Pack ever be back? Well at the rate they're going it will be a very long time. Bart Starr has been with the team for three seasons 
now and their has been little, if any improvement. 
The offense is dormant. Lynn Dickey has been a hard luck quarterback and his sub David Whitehurst is not ready yet for the big time. Willard Harrel is a swift back and Barty Smith is a power runner, but they need an offensive line. Mark Koncar is the only real horse up front. Steve Odom is a small but effective wide receiver and Rich McGeorge is a solid but slow tight end. Top pick James Lofton from Stanford should fit right away and become a star. 
The Packers defense has some holes. The most notable is at linebacker where Fred Carr must be replaced. Youngsters Mike Butler and Ezra Johnson ar~ ?eveloping on the front line. The secondary with Wtlhe ~uchanon, Steve Luke, Johnnie Gray and M.C. McCoy ts the best area of the team. 
The !'ackers have been a dismal team in recent years and thts year should be no different.

Freshmen survive pre-season drills 
by Ray O'Brien Sports Editor 

The first few weeks in a new environment is a new experience for a college freshman. Living conditions are different and there arc courses to worry about. But imagine the traumatic adjustment of going from the reverie of All-America status to the rank of third string player in just six short months, and then on top of that add all the miseries of just being a "typical" freshman. You are beginning to get the idea of what it means to be a freshman football player at Notre Dame .. 
While most of the Class of 1982 arrived over the weekend, the frosh loothall players will be compleing their third glorious week at duLac. While most of the new faces are ,lowly conditioned to college l"la~ses, the new players have been \Ubjcctcd to grueling "two-a-day" prarticcs and bombarded with an l"ntircly new f<x>tball system. They ioin a team that has just won a National Championship and has ,onw of the most experienced and talented players in the country. 
It is a time of reproving one's self and staring at the bottom. While it ~ounds like a very humbling exper­ience, you won't hear any of these new players complaining. 
·"I just try and force myself to be open minded about it," explains running back Pete Buchanan. "By going in open minded, I realize that I am probably not going to play much but I have time to learn." Buchanan is a perfect example of the high school player who was "All-Everything" his senior year and now finds himself behind three or four upper classmen. But Buchanan knew what he was getting into before he got to South Bend since he lived up the road in Plymouth. However, there are always going to be surprises. 
"I really wasn't ready for this kind of hitting," said Buchanan. "In high school I could run over most guys but here even the defensive backs can hurt you." If a 6-3,220 pound fullback is being hit hard out there, than it is a wonder that the other freshmen survived the "two-a-day" drills. 
While the physical adjustments are severe, there is also a psycho­logical effect. "Practices are more competitive and you have to be on through the drills of 

the ball," added the ex-Columbus High star. "You could fool around a little before but everything is so concentrated now and there is so much to learn." 
For freshman Dean Masztak that psychological adjustment included pinching himself just to make sure he was really. at Notre Dame. 
"I still can't believe I'm here," the big tight end commented. "It has taken a while to settle down and even think about playing football." 
Masztak also comes to ND with All-America credentials but the idea of starting at the bottom doesn't phase him in the least. "Notre Dame has been with me since I was a little kid because 
. 

my father was a Notre Dame nut. I tried to keep an open mind when I was deciding where to go last spring but when I stepped out of the car and looked up at the sun shining on the Golden Dome it was all over." 
Masztak survived the early fall drills with a couple of stars to his credit, but he is not getting over zealous. "I just want to get my feet wet my first year," explain the Toledo, Ohio native. "I really don't expect to just walk over people." Masztak has certainly felt the physical and psychological strain of the double workouts, and feels that he could do much more given the time to improve. 
Every freshman has to leave his or her family when they enroll in college, but what about the football frosh who had his father as a coach. 
"There is no change in the relationship I have with my new coaches," offers Steve Cichy. "Every freshman is in the same boat. There is that pressure fromeveryone who expects you to do well." That pressure doubles when you are a consensus high school All-American as this defen­sive back was. 
The defensive back position also demands more learning and con­centration than other positions. This shows in Cichy's approach to the opening workouts. "You really have to be ready for practice," offers the versatile newcomer. "We all have to prove ourst:lves so getting up for practice is almost like preparing for a game." 
With Saturday's scrimmage 
completed and the first game less than two weeks away, the freshmen begin to evaluate their perfor­mances to this date. "I've been pretty satisfied with myself," notes Cichy, "But I don't think you should really look back right now because you have so much learning ahead of you." 
While Steve Cichy must say goodbye to his father-coach, Mike Boushka gets to be close once against to his older brother Dick. But these family get togethers are not what you would expect. Mike Boushka lines -up at the flanker position while Dick Boushka plays the cornerback position on defense. 
So when they do run into one another on the field, there are no friendly hello's. Mike insists his family ties don't get in the way. 
"It doesn't matter who lines up on the other side," explains the highly touted freshman, "you are out there to show the coaches what you can do and you have to work for w )la t you're going to get." Boushka feels that he was well prepared for his first two weeks especially since he has that older brother that has been through it once before. 
However, there is no substitute for experience. The unanimous feeling among the freshmen is that high school practices were nothing like their initiation drills. The only reason they don't feel the strain is that there i~ not enough time in the day to experience that. Pete Buchanan summed up most of the newcomers sentiments when he declared, "I'm sure glad the two-a-days ari! over; now only if the season would start!"

Are Oilers play-off bound?

The two central division in the National Football League are almost exact opposites. The AFC Central is one of the best divisions in the league. t is a highly competitive division in which each team has a good chance to wind up on top. The NFC Central, meanwhile, is one of the worst divisions in the league. The Vikings have dominated this division for the past decade and they should continue to do so this season. Not only is the NFC a poor division but it is getting \\orse. The Tampa Bay Bucaneers have been added to this division. That is a good example of the NFL's non-geographical alignments. 
AFCCENTRAL 
HOUSTON OILERS-How could anyone possibly pick the Oilers to beat the Steelers and the Bengals? First of all, the Oilers have come very close to winning this division in recent seasons. In fact, Commissioner Pete Rozelle last year made a public apology to the Oilers after an incorrect referee's call had cost them a game. Had they won that game, the Oilers would have been division champs. 
The Houston offense should be one of the best in the league this season. The new man in town is former Texas All-American running back Earl Campbell. Last year's Heisman Trophy winner was the first selection in the May draft and he should help the Oilers right away. His running mate could be Anthony Davis, Ronnie Coleman, Tim Wilson or Rob Carpenter. All of them are better than average backs. Quarterback Dan Pastorini is finally ready to settle down in Houston after signing a long term contract with the club. He may just be ready to reach the superstar level that so many people expect him to attain. Pasorini's receivers are among the best in the league. Bill "White Shoes" Johnson may be better knows for his dazzling punt rdurns but he is a fine target. Ken Burrough is one of the best deep threats in the game. Rich Caster, recently acquired from the Jets, may not be the best blocker at tight end, but he too is a deep threat. The Houston offensive line is just average, but with all the offensive firepower, they should be no liability. 
The Houston defense is led by linebacker Robert Brazile. Although he is only entering his fourth season, Brazile has received all-Pro honors for the past two seasons. He may be the best linebacker in the game right now. Fellow linebacker Ted Washington has a knack for coming up with the big play. The three-man line is anchored by Elvin Bethea and Curly Culp. The secondary is spearheaded by safety Mike Weger. 
The Oilers may seem like a longshot, but the additions of Campbell and Caster will make their offense score points. Their defense is above average and will hold most Houston opponents in check. Look for the Oilers to make the AFC playoffs for the first time ever. 
PITTSBURGH STEELERS-Although the Steelers have fallen somewhat in the past year or so, they are still one of the better teams in the league. 
Terry Bradshaw is once again the Pittsburgh quarterback. 
Back-up Mike Kruczek may see a lot of playing time, however, because Bradshaw has a long history of injuries. Franco Harris is the main threat in the Sleeter running game and Rocky Bleier is a solid, if unspectacular back. Bennie Cunningham, John Stallworth and Lynn Swann are a fine trio of receivers. The Steelers have traded a few of their offensive lineman in recent seasons but that unit remains solid. Guard John Hicks was acquired by Pittsburgh in the off-season but he was just .waived. (Anyone who say Hicks play in New York certainly does not expect him to make the team either.) 
The names on the Steelers defensive unit are still the same. Messers, Greene, Greenwook, \\'hite, Lambert, Ham, and Blount are still part of one of the League's superior defenses. The only loss on defense is that of 
J.T. Thomas. The young cornerback was found to have a blood disorder which will prevent him from playing football. His absence may hurt. 
All in all this is another solid Steeler team which will be in the thick of things in the AFC Central and should wind up with a wild card playoff berth. 
CINCINNATI BENGALS-One of the most often asked questions around football circles is "why don't the Bengals win?" This year the answer to that question may be a bit easier. Quarterback Ken Anderson was injured in an exhibiion game and will be out for at least the first few weeks uf the season. This shifts the offensive load to backup John Reaves. 
The Cincinnati running game is in good shape with the Ohio State backfield of Archie Griffin and Pete Johnson. Griffin and Johnson run behind one of the better offensive lines in the league. Like the Oilers and the Steelers, the Bengals possess a good pair of wide receivers. Isaac Curtis, who is coming back from knee surgery in his college days at Oklahoma, is just starting to blossom. 
The Bengal defense boasts one of the youngest front fours in football. Eddie Edward and Wilson Whitley are both entering their second .vear, Gary Burley isin his third season, and Ross Browner, when he returns from his injury is a rookie. The best lineback is Jim LeClair. The secondary has lost Tommy Casanova to retirement and LeMar Parrish to the Redskins. The Bengals may be weak on pass coverage; 
The Bengals should have another frustrating year. The loss of Anderson will hurt them in the early going, and even if he comes back the Bengals may not be able to catch up.

CLEVELAND BROWNS-Alas, the poor Browns... they play in a division where the three opposing teams are superior. New coach Sam Rutigliano will have his hands full trying to keep the Browns at their current level of play. 
The Browns' quarter back is Brian Sipe, unless he loses his job to rookie sensation Mark Miller. Greg Pruitt is one running back. He's had three straight 1000 yard seasons for Cleveland. Either Cleo Miller, Larry Pole, or Mike Pruitt will be in the backfield. The Browns wide receivers are Dave Logan and Reggie Rucker. The offensive line is fair. 
The Browns defense may be in trouble if Jerry Sherk cannot perform up to par. Sherk has been the mainstay of the defensive line and if he's unable to perform the Brown's might come out a little more. porous. The Browns drafted linebacker Clay Matthews from USC but he has been hurt for most of the pre-season. Thorn Darden is the best deep back. 
The Browns areone)f the average teams ofthe NFL, not good enough to win a playoff berth, but able to pull a few upsets. The number of upsets they pull this season will depend on the play of their defense. 
NFCCENTRAL 
MINNESOTA VIKINGS-The Vikings should be able to yawn their way to the NFC playoffs once this season. Bud Grant's troops have been atop this division for a long time and they should remain there this season. 
Fran Tarkenton returns from his first major injury to lead the Vikings. Tarkenton may be gettin older, but he still has enough game to be effective. The backup QB, Tommy Kramer, will be ready in case there are any problems. Chuck Foreman is a complete running back who is always a plus for the offense. Rickey Young, obtained from San Diego a few weeks ago, should complement Foreman well. Wide receivers Sammie White and Ahmad Rahshad are very capable. Bob Tucker should take over at tight end for the Vikes. All-star guard Ed White has been traded, but the Viking line remains solid. Ron Yary is one of the best in the league at tackle. 
The Viking defense just keeps rolling along. The from wall still reads Eller, Page, Sutherland, and Marshall, although subs Mark Mullaney, James White and Rookie Randy Holloway could see considerable action this season. The toplinebackers are Jeff Seimon and Matt Blair. Nate Allen is the best defender against the pass. 
The Vikings should have a t~pical season with 12 or so wins and a berth in the playoffs.
