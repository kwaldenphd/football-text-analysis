BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP)-Iranian crowds mixed sobs of mourning with chants of "Death to America!" yesterday as the nation buried its president and prime minister as mar­tyrs cut down in Sunday's assassina­tion bombing. 
President Mohammad Ali Rajai, who held the office for 27 days before his death, and Prime Minister MohammadJavad Bahonar, in office for just 25 days, were buried in Teh­ran's Behesht Zahra Cemetery in services that drew a crowd reported numbering 2.5 million people. 
In a speech broadcast by Tehran Radio, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini promised new elections to replace the "martyrs," vowing their deaths would not alter the course of the Is­lamic fundamentalist revolution that he leads. 
It was the second time in two 

months that Khomeini's top Islamic 
leadership had been wiped out in 
blasts and fire. 
On June 28, an explosion at the headquarters of the ruling Islamic Revolutionary Party killed Ayatollah Mohammad Hussein Beheshti, con­sidered the second-most powerful figure in Iran after Khomeini, and more than 70 other leaders. 
As the funeral procession wound through the streets of Iran, mour­ners demanded the deaths of ex­President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr and opposition Mujahadeen Khalq leader Massoud Rajavi. Both fled to

school football teams wm soon be 
defending the athletic honor of 
Uons and Tigers and Bears across 
the land. At halftime, marching 
bands will swarm on the gridiron in 
high-stepping splendor. 
Off the field, math club members 

will twist Rubik's Cubes, and 
choruses will begin practicing for 
Christmas concerts. 
Extracurricular activities are the 

icing on America's academic cake. In 
most communities, they are taken 
for granted. 
But in suburban Bethel Park, stu­dents this year will pay to play. For the first time, kids who want to par­ticipate in various activities are being charged users' fees. 
"Why? Our taxes are very high and we're trying to do anything we can to avoid raising ing them furth," athletic directorJoe Lodge said. 
"Some school districts have flat 

out eliminated their extracurricular 
activities because they simply don't 
have ways to fund them," he added. 
I.odgc was referring to Massachu­setl-!1, where voters approved Proposition 2 last November. That tax-cutting measure: has rcuccd municipal revenues by SSOO million this year. In the· schools, non­academic activities and courses arc bearing the brunt. 
"We're trying to avoid that panic situation. We thought it would be a good idea to get a juntp on what ap­pears to be a trend," I.odgc said in a tdcphonc interview. 
The fcc varies with the activity. Football is tht· most expensive at J3S per student. Boys' basketball is J32, girls' volleyball JIO. Most non­athletic programs, like the astronomy club and the student newspaper, cost a nominal $I or $2. 
I.odge said the amount of equip­ment and supplies used was the criterion for setting the rates. 
Frank I.avalle, director ofbusiness affairs, said Bethel Park spent about 1265,000 on non-academic ac­tivities last year. The figure includes salaries and supplies. 
The fees wiJJ bring in an esti':llated $15,000 to $18,000. "That was enough to be significant, hut not so much in an opening year that it would be outrageous," I.odge said. 
The Bethel Park School District, which has a student population of 6,400, Is located in an aftluent com­munity in the rolling hills south of Pittsburgh. 

Parents look upon the district's education and recreation program with pride. The school also excels in athletics. The football team, 9-3 last year, was the western Pennsylvania runner-up in its category. The bas­ketbal and baseball teams won their· conferences and both the boys' and girls' swimming teams won the state championships last year. 
The new fees have caused hardly a ripple among students, probably be­cause most parents are picking up the cost. But even among the adults, there's been little negative reaction, school officials said.·

The blast came at a time of growing opposition by many West Germans to U.S. defense policies. Two weeks ago a American military facility in Berlin was bombed, but there were no injuries. 
No one claimed responsibility for yesterday morning's explosion. West German sources said it was believed to have come from a bomb placed in a Volkswagen sedan in a parking lot outside the headquarters buildings of the U.S. Air Force

Student Body President Don Murday opened the Student Senate's first meeting of the year last night by announcing the Uni­versity's agreement to help finan­cially guarantee the success of the Chautauqua Coffeehouse. 
Terming the $20,000 line of credit "a major commitment to the students," Murday expressed optimism about the Student Uni­on's ability to present "first-rate" shows. "I'm sure people are going to come out," he said. 
According to Mun~ay, half of the fund transfers to the Student Union immediately upon re­quest, the remainder after con­sultation with Mr. Thomas Mason, Vice President for Busi­ness Affairs and Fr. Van Wolvlear, Vice President for Student Affairs. 
Opened on a trial basis by the Student Union last spring, the Chautauqua live entertainment offers live entertainment in an in­

formal environment. I.ocated on the second floor ofI.afortune Stu­dent Center, it operates on a br~ak-even basis. Murday hopes the money enables the Student Union to sponsor -more am­bitious shows.

Seven separate explosions in uma, Peru, includ­ing blasts at the U.S. Embassy and the residence ofAmbassador Edwin 
G. Corr, caused heavy damage and killed two people today, police reported. The nearly simultaneous explosions shortly after 2 a.m. at the U.S. diplomatic installations coincided with detonations at the Ford Motor Co., the Bank of America and the local distributors of Coca-Cola and the G. Berckemeyer and Co. milk products ad­ministrative offices, which represents Carnation Milk in Peru. The seventh blast was at a private home where a fire killed two people and injured seven others, police said. -AP 
Drivers ended their month-long search 
through the Andrea Doria's murky corpse yesterday and prepared to weigh anchor with a locked safe and an answer to the liner's "last mystery." The divers found the hole that the Stockholm opened in the Andrea Doria's side 2S years ago, expedition leader Peter Gimbel said Sunday. It was so large and so deep, he said, that it ended speculation about whether a missing watertight door caused the ship to sink so quickly. The expedition made what spokeswoman LiUian Pickard termed "a very, very tough decision" to abandon the search for the purser's safe in the first-class lounge. Instead, she said, divers spent yesterday on final filming for a documentary on the expedition. The support vessel Sea Level II was to hoist anchor today and arrive back in Montauk, N.Y., tomorrow. -AP 
A small-town judge who presided ove; the landmark criminal liability trial against Ford Motor Co. has died of cancer in a Winamac hospital. He was 62. Services are planned for Thursday morning for Pulaski Circuit Judge Harold R. Staffeldt, who died late Sunday. Staffeldt once conceded he deserved some criticism for his handling of the 10-week trial-the first criminal trial against a major corporation. Ford was accused in the deaths of three teen-age giris whose 1973 Pinto automobile burst into flames when struck from behind by a van in Elkhart County on Aug. I 0, 1978. The 1980 trial, venued to this northern Indiana farming community of about 2,400, ended when a jury of seven men and five women acquitted the automaker of criminal charges brought by an Elkhart County grand jury. The charges were based on a 1977 Indiana law holding corpora-. tions as well as individuals subject to criminal prosecution. Staffeldt is survived by his wife of 32 years, Helen, and two sons. -AP 
Reflecting growing patience with President Reagan's African policy, a high-level delegation from black African nations called yesterday for immediate steps toward independence for Namibia. However, the delegation carefully avoided any direct criticism of the administration after a meeting of nearly two hours with Secretary ofState Alexander M. HaigJr. The delegation was led by Robert Ouko, foreign minister of Kenya. The administration has been trying to avoid antagonizing black African nations on the Namibian issue while also seeking an agreement for independence for the mineral-rich country that will be accept;tble to South Africa, which has been dragging its heels on relinquishing control of Namibia. Critics have said the Reagan administration's go-slow appro;~ch on the issue is one reason more progress toward Namibian independence has not been made. -AP 
Religious leaders, officials and 2,500 Viennese -both gentiles andJews -walked the narrow cobblestone streets ofthe old city yesterday in a procession mourning victims of the weekend grenade attack on a synagogue. Memorial services were held in the street outside the 155-year-old Israelite Temple, a bouquet offlowers marking a doorstep left bloodstained in the Saturday attack which killed an elderly man and a young woman. Twenty people were injured. Three suspects, described by police as Arabs, were in cus­tody, but the authorities said one appears not to have been involved. Authorities released six others yesterday saying they were not in­volved. Pulice said they did not know who was behind the attack, although one of the suspects claimed ties to the Palestine Liberation Organization. The PLO has repudiated the claim and condemned the attack. -AP 
Chase Manhattan Bank lowered its prime lending rate by one-half of a percentage point to 20 percent today, breaking ranks with the rest ofthe banking industry and sparking new hopes for a sustained decline in interest rates. The move marked the first change in the prime rate since July 8, and analysts said they expected other major banks to follow Chase's lead. Chase is the third-largest bank in the nation. Chase's action followed a better -than-expected money supply report by the Federal Reserve Board on Friday. The Federal Reserve said the basic measure ofthe money supply had declined S3.7 billion in the third week ofAugust. Some economists said that decline would allow the Federal Reserve to provide additional reserves to the banking network, paving the way for further drops in interst rates. The prime rate is the interest banks charge on most shortterm loans to top-rated commercial borrowers. businesses generally are charged at least I percentage point above the prime. The prime rate does not apply to consumer loans. -Ap. ;

WSND, Notre Dame's student-run radio station, plans to hold auditions Sept. 1 and Sept. 2 from 6 p.m. to 11 
p.m. on the first floor of O'Shaugnessy Hall. Positions remain open in announcing. reporting. production, sales, promotion, public relations, and engineering. The job openings require no prior ex­perience. 
WSND station manager Tom Nes­singer said "there will be no significant changes in either the AM or FM line-ups this year. We'll just continue building on the basic programs developed three years ago." 1978 marked the addition of a music format to the AM station and an overall empha~is on variety for both stations. 
AM programmer Kevin Leitten an­nounces his station's new slogan as the alternative. "We basically stick to Billboard's top one hundred, but requests always take priority. We don't want to be labelled as a hard rock station or as a pop station, says l.citten. 
Nes.<tinger labels WSND-AM unique because of its attempt to of­fer new bands and new releases con­siderable airtime. 
Slight changes in this year's news coverage include expanded news programs at midnight and 6 p.m.; a Talk it up show currently in the plan­ning stages; and a guest interview program dealing with on-campus personalities, slated for Thusday evenings from I 0:30-I I p.m. In addi­
tion,  a  P.H.S.  series,  ·Energy  
Perspecti ves,  airs  offered  in  one  
minute  intervals  throughout  the  
day.  

Bob Lewandowski's Sports Inter­view, offered during the expanded 6p.m. news, marks this year's major sports addition. Interviews with sports personalities such as Art Schliester, Bob Griese, Bear Bryant, as well a'i all opposing football coaches constitute the format. Other sports programming includes Sports Showcao;e at 6-7p.m. Wednes­days, Speaking of Sports at 12-12:30 Wednesday evenings, and Sports Sunday at II a.m. to noon. 
WSND-FM, a non-advertising clas­sical station, continues this year with its airing of in-house special produ<.·tions and live orchestra con­certs. Kris Allen, FM program dircc­tor, emphasizes the variety her station offers in the classical realm as well. "We try to avoid overdoing the same old worn out works. We stay away from repeating the favorites, both modern and ancient, and in­troduce fresh works as much as pos­sible, Allen said. 
The station regularly offers concerts of the Boston Symphony, Metropolitan Opera, New York Phil­harmonic, Chicago Symphony, and Milwaukee Symphony. By courtesy of the University Artist Series, WSND-FM this year offers the Cleveland 6rchestra, which Allen terms one ofthe best. 

Other new programming includes Professor Danehy's theme show Operas from Shakespeare on Sunday nights and a talk show Encounters, currently without a time slot.

Burns seeks 'senseofcollege' 
By CAROL CAMP 
News Staff 
Dr. Robert Burns will assume the position of acting dean of the Col­lege of Arts and Letters during the 1981-1982 school year. 
Commenting on his qualifications for the task, Dr. Burns stated, "I've been at Notre Dame for twenty-four years and I know the College inside and out -I had better!" 
The dean received his under­graduate degree in history at Nor­theastern University in Boston in 1948, and earned his Ph.D in 1960 at Harvard. Since 1957, he served as part of Notre Dame's history depart­ment, teaching British, European, and Irish history, as well as Western history. He maintained a role in ad­ministrative work in various capacities since 1968. 
Dr. Burns describes his views concerning the strengths and weaknesses of the College of Arts and Letters as an examination of the needs arid goals ofthe college. 
The College needs to develop more interdisciplinary programs, Dr. Burns stated, adding "Notre Dame is much less interdisciplinary than its peer institutions." He believes this results from the as­sociation of faculty members to their department rather than with the college as a whole. 
''In other words, we need to develop a better sense of college," he said.

into an All Savers Certificate. Some institutions have been offering cash bonuses; others promise annual in­terest rates of up to 50 percent on the "repo" part ofthe deals. 
On Saturday, however, the IRS in an unusual weekend announcement · said it had "substantial doubt about (the) income tax consequences" of the package investments. 

It added: "interest from All Savers Certificates issued under the condi­tions stated in advertisements placed by financial institutions may not qualify for tax-free treatment un­der the 1981 act." 
The IRS did not give any specific reasons for its warning. 
One possible problem is that many of the programs make the in­terest payments on the "repos" con­ditional on the customer's investment in an All Savers Cerif­icate. 

If the customer does not buy a certificate, he or she forfeits the in­terest on the "repo." If the "repo" and the certificate are considered as one transaction, the total interest paid could be higher than 70 per­cent of the rate on one-year Treasury bills. That would make the investment ineligible for the tax ex­emption. 
Some institutions said that they did not require reinvestment in an All Savers Certificate and therefore thought their programs were safe. 
For example,Joe Scully, president of St. Paul Federal Savings & loan in Chicago, said that customers who in­vested in repurchase agreements had signed authorizations to have their money converted into All Savers Certificates, but people who chose to revoke the authorizations would not be penalized. "We don't have the linkage problem as far as I know," he said. "We have two separate plans and they are not inter­dependent." 

Adding to the confusion, meanwhile, was the fact that several federal regulatory agencies were considering whether to allow people to withdraw money from certificates of deposit, without the usual penalties, to invest in the All Savers Certificates. 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., with authority over 9,300 state-chartered banks, said Monday that such withdrawals would be allowed.

Shortly after the explosion, security guards scaled off the base to all but "mission essential" person· nel. Military police in full battle dress and carrying M -16 rifles ringed the parking area. But Air Force spokesman Maj. Tracy McCollester insisted base operations continued normally. 
U.S. Officials also stepped up security at other installations in West Germany, where some 260,000 U.S. troops are stationed. 
In Frankfurt, military police. searched for bombs at the post ex· change, the hcadquartcs orthe U.S. V corps and other installations with­out turning up any further devices. 
The West German Federal Criminal Office took over the inves­tigation ofthe Ramstein explosion. 
The explosion occurred shortly after 7 a.m. local time and apparently came from an automobile parked in a lot in front of the adjacent head­quarters buildings of the U.S. Air Force Europe and ofthe North Atlat· nk Tn·aty Organization air com­mand, West German police said. 
Witnesses said the bomb, which went off as the first stream of civilians and military personnel were reporting for work, shattered car windshields and blew out ·win­dows and interior walls in nearby buildings. 

"Thank the Lord the explosion oc­curred before most people reported for work or we would have had a lot more injuries," an Air Force spokes­man said. He said damage was ex­tensive. 
A spokesman at the West German Federal Criminal Office in nearby Karlsruhe told The Associated Press that German ()authorities believe the explosion was the work of ter­r~>rists, but he gave no further details. No group claimed responabllity. 
"The cause of the explosion has not been determined," a brief Air Force statement said. 
U.S. officials denied Ger­man radio reports that a second bomb was found near the base. 
Yesterday's blast was the second this month aimed at U.S. milltary facilities in Germany. On Aug. 18, small pipebombs exploded at a U.S. garrison in West Berlin, causing minor damage, but no injuries.

Hermann's successor 
Campbell, Gates vie for PU job 
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.. -~AP) Purdue University has had a long line of top-notch quarterbacks, including Len Dawson, Bob Griese, Mike ·Phipps and, of course, Mark Herrmann. 
The latest candidates for the pres­tigious position, now battling for the starting spot vacated by the graduated Hermann, are Scott Campbell and Larry Gates. Campbell has the job for now, but Gates won't let him relax a minute. 
"The competition is friendly, and it makes us better players, from which we get a better team," says Gates, who figured to be Herrmann's backup quarterback last year before a summer auto accident sidelined him for the season. 
"I feel like I've finally got an op­portunity," said Gates, whose lean, 6-foot-5 build and drop-back passing form are reminiscent of Herrmann. "I just hope to have a good preseason and work hard on the things I've been doing." 
Campbell was thrown into action as.a starter against Notre Dame in his first collegiate game as a freshman last year when Herrmann was out with a thumb injury. Purdue lost 31­10, but Campbell completed 17 of 26 passes for 178 yards and no inter­ceptions. 
"I was very nervous at the start of the Notre Dame game," he said. "But that experience will help me this year. I showed last year that I can do the job. It helped my confidence." 
Campbell, a 6-foot, 197-pound sophomore, is quite different from Herrmann. He's smaller, a better runner and has a different per­sonality. As a result, Purdue's offense will have a new wrinkle this season. 
"We'll still pass a lot, but we'll probably run a little more," said Campbell. "We'll run the option some. i won't get carried away. The coaches have told me I'm No.1 (quarterback) so it's up to the other guys to beat me out. If I don't per­form, they'll change it, but I plan on doing the job and keeping my posi­tion." 
Campbell said he felt honored being the backup to Herrmann, major college football's all-time pas­sing leader. 
"I learned"so much about the of­fense, aboult reading patterns, 
throw the ball ... 

"A lot ofguys want to play as fresh­men, but I didn't," he continued. "I felt it was perfect to get the system down for a year, to adjust, and then come in as a sophomore as No.1." 
A year earlier, it was Gates who was Herrmann's understudy The accident that left him with a separated shoulder, broken clavicle, collapsed lung and concussion changed that. 
Coach Jim Young calls Campbell "a competitive, winning quarter­back who has a good arm and the ability to run. He is really an out­standingall-around quarterback. But Larry Gates is still in the picture. He has a strongarm and is a winner who had two excellent games for us two 
defenses, turning, when to the -years ago."

Houston reactivates Richard 
HOUSTON (AP) Houston Astros pitcherJ.R. Richard, continu­ing a remarkable come-back from a life-threatening stroke 13 months ago, will be reactivated Tuesday and could pitch against the New York Mets during the team's current home stand. 
Astros Manager Bill Virdon would not say specifically when Richard would pitch, but said he was ready to rejoin the team. 
"We don't have to take the step now when he's going to pitch," Vir­don said. "It could be Tuesday or it could be Sept. 25. I told him it just depends on what happens down the road." 
"It's a psychological boostfor him and his 
teammates.  Whether  
or  not he's  able  to  
pitch  is  up  -to  the  
manager."  


Richard's tragic odyssey started July 30, 1980, when he suffered a stroke during a workout in the Astrodome. Richard underwent emergency surgery immediately to remove a blood clot from his neck. 
Amazingly, Richard was able to report to spring training in February 
"' with his teammates and started specialized work-outs aimed toward his dream -to pitch again in the major leagues. 
The dream took another step for­ward Sunday, when the Astros an­nounced that Richard and first baseman Mike Ivie would be reac­tivated Tuesday. Ivie had been on the team's disabled list, suffering from mental exhaustion. 
Astros General Manager AI Rosen said Richard's return was a reward. 
"He's worked hard to get himself into condition," Rosen said. "It's a psychological boost for him and his teammates. Whether or not he's able to pitch is up to the manager." 
Virdon said he was impressed with Richard after watching him throw 20 minutes ofbatting practice Saturday. Virdon said Richard's per­formance was instrumental in the decision to reactivate the 1980 All­Star starting pitcher for the National League.

Galbreath was the Saints' No.2 draft pick in 1976. He and Chuck Muncie were thunder and lightning in the New Orleans backfield for several seasons. But they were benched early in last year's 1-1 5 season, then Muncie was traded to San Diego after four games.

Blache is also impressed with the new crop of freshman backs, espe­cially tailback Chris Smith and ful­lback Mark Brooks, both from Cincinnati. "They're both fine run­ners," said Blache, "better than any of us expected Both will definitely see action this season." 
The Irish coachingstaffgot its first look at its backfield contingent in last Saturday's scrimmage and, ex­cept for a few minor errors, were generally pleased by the results. "Overall, we had a good scrimmage," Blache said. "But we still have to eliminate the little er­rors -the problems in discipline and concentration, like faking and running our courses. But they're on­ly minor; no missed assignments oc anything like that." 
So, when the "new and improved" Fighting Irish take the field Septem­ber 12 against LSU, the least of their worries should be the performance of the backfield. That will allow them to concentrate on other, more important matters -lilce what color shoes to where with their new out­fits.

Royalsfire Frey 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. tAP) -The Kansas City Royals announced today Jim Frey has been fired as manager and former New York Yankees Manager Dick Howser named as his replacement. 
Howser was introduced at a 1 p.m. news conference at Royals Stadium. 
"This was a very difficult decision for us to make, especially for me per­sonally," said joe Burke. Royals vice president and general manager. "Jim Frey is one of the most loyal, ded­icated and hardworking individuals I have had the good fortune to be as­sociated with in my long baseball career. 
Howser is 45 and a veteran of 22 years of pro baseball. He was manager of the 1980 Eastern Divi­sion champion Yankees when he guided the club to a 103-59 record. That .635 percentage was best in major league baseball for the regular season. It was only the fourth time in history a first-year manager had won 
100 or more games.

sion commentator. 
He was tl "ankel:'·;' third base coach from l7v-' to I c 1 and served as head baseball co at Florida State in 1979, where !~am ha(! a 43-16-I record.

Backfield features new-position 
Tuesday, September 1, 1981 -page 12 

By CHRIS NEEDLES 
Sports Writer 
For months now, Notre Dame football fans have been inundated with news and general gossip about their "new look" Fighting Irish. 
Of course, there is a new head coach, Gerry Faust, who hopes to wake up the echoes that have been lulled to sleep the past few years by too many third-down punts and not enough offensive creativity. But most everyone now knows enough about Faust to write a biography on him. 
Then there arc the new uniforms, a stylish mixture of blue and gold that, if they don't help win football games, at least should place the team atop Mr. Blackwell's next "Best Dressed" list. But one can get a good look at these on the cover of the 1981 Notre Dame Football Guide, right next to the drawing of Bob Crable and Phil Carter doing their schoolwork. 
But now, with the 1981 season opener just II days away, there is nothing much else left to talk about except football. And nowhere else will this "new look" be more in evidence than on offense, most espe­cially in the backfield. 
Gerry Fau~t's new offense, borrowed from his days at Moeller High, features a brand new position -wingback -_and a lot of motion, most of which will take place in the backfield. The tailback and fullback positions remain intact, but the addi­tion of the wingback, who can line up either in the backfield as a run­ning back or in the slot as a flanker, creates endless play-calling options for Faust and his staff. 
"The wingback should be the best athlete we have," says Faust, "or at least one of the best. It has to be someone who is really diversified because he'll be asked to do so many different things." 
Former flanker Tony Hunter, a two-year starter, has been tabbed as the new wingback, without much argument from the critics. The 6-5, 220 lb. junior, who had a superb freshman season but who was limited somewhat by injuries last year, is generally regarded as the team's most versatile performer. Last season, Hunter caught 23 passes to lead the team, and also displayed his rushing ability by gaining 52 yards on five end-around plays. 
Naturally, Hunter is pleased with the change of positions, which also brings with it an increased involve­ment in the offense. ''I'll still be primarily a receiver, plus I'll be in motion a lot," Hunter said. "But lots of times I'll tine up in a 'full house' backfield, which will give me the op­tion to run the ball, too. 
"It's tough to learn a new position, but I really like it. It requires a lot of physical stamina on my part, but I enjoy the increased responsibility" 
There is a potential problem, however, with the newly-created position, one that is adding a few wrinkles to the brow of backfield coach Greg Blache. "We have a definite problem in regards to depth at the wingback position," Blache said yesterday. "Tony Hunter is healthy and he's taking to the new position well, but there is still room for improvement from him. 
"After that, though, we've got problems. 1i'im Tripp (who was slated to be Hunter's backup) will be out at least four weeks with a sprained knee. Past that, we're pret­ty thin. 
"If Tony were to get injured," Blache continued, "we'd probably switch one of our tailbacks to

Northwestern leads the way 
EDITOR'S NOTE: Severalpublicationspublish a ver­sion of"The Bottom Ten." This one ts unique to The Observer. 
AUFHORS' NOTE: "The Bottom Ten" is a light­hearted, often tasteless, look at college football polls. Anything contained herein that offends anyone is ab­solutely intlfmtional. 
Far be it from the Bottom Ten ~oters to learn from their mistakes. 
In 1979, the Florida Gators topped the end-of-se:t!ion poll with an 0-10-1 record. So voters made them the pre-season favorite to repeat as the nation's worst team in 1980. Dt:spite a heroic last-second loss to Georgia, Florida finished with a dismal 8-3 record before going on to the Tangerine BowL 
Northwestern finished last year in the sunspot, with a perfect O-Il slate. That fact, coupled with the loss of several statters, has convinced voters to once again rank them number one, as the 1981 season gets under­
way. 
Teams like UTEP, Penn and Columbia should be 
familiar to Bottom Ten devotees. But, alas, there are 
several traditional powerhouses whose programs have 
sufferred unfortunate improvement. 
The return to power of a Republican administration, 


and the resulting increases in defense spending, have 
doomed Army and Navy to moderate success. That 
much is evident from pre-season scrimmages in North 
Korea and the Mediterranean. 
Don't look for Chuck Fairbanks and Colorado in the polls this year. The Endangered Species Act has rescued the Buffaloes. The annual mid-summer meetingofthe Bottom Ten voters, held this year in Kansas City, was a smash. The announcement that former Arizona St., Mis­souri, Green Bay and Notre Dame mentor Dan Devine had been elected to the Bottom Ten Hall Of Fame brought the house down. 
Here, then, are the 1981 rankings with 1980 records in parenthesis: 
I) Northwestern (0-11) -Denny Green inherits Wildcats' five-year record of 3-51-1.
