Nazz Deli opens this Friday

Service and menu changes will mark the opening of the Nazz Deli on Friday, Oct. 8, from 10 p.m. to 1 
a.m. 

Counter service in the Darby's 
Place snack bar will replace the former waitresses and table service according to Mr. Tom Grogan, 
Huddle manager. Menus will be provided on each table listing the w~7kend of~erings. . 
The basic staple Is the famous Nazzwich, still for sale by the inch at 20 cents an inch," stated 
Grog·an. Toasted bagels with cream 
cheese. another popular item, will
also be retained. Different kinds of deli-type sandwiches, such as pas­trami and chipped ham, will be 
offered. Thechoiceofcoldcutswill
change from week to week . 

A new menu addition will be a selection of ·various coffees and teas. The beverages and their prices per cup are as follo..,s: (coffees)anisette, au chocolate, cinnamon, de menthe, 35 cents; sanka, 20 cents; (teas) darjeeling, iasimine, oolong, 25 cents; orange pekoe, 20 cents. Hot apple cider and lemonade will also be served. 
"The idea is this food is com­pletely different from Huddle food," . Grogan said. Huddle employees will operate the deli, but the menus will not coincide. 
Grogan stressed that the deli set-up is still open to suggestions. He is presently considering the possibility of a cheese platter. "Our best gauge is our sales," Grogan stated. "We'll adjust the menu to the student reactions. The beverage selection was a sugges­tion of the students last year." 
The deli project is a joint effort with the Nazz coordinators. Ac­cording to Grogan. "We are work­ing together to get a more coordi­nated effort -to put food and entertainment together."

The entertainment will include theater as well as vocal and instrumental music, according to Fanning. A Neil Simon play was recently presented, and a "Jacques Brei" review is planned for the last 
weekend in October and the first in November. 
Fanning stated that the Nazz has more money to bring in outside performers this year. However, the major source of talent comes 
from student volunteers. Fanning noted that many campus perfor­mers have strong reputations and attract a regular following. 
There is no specific procedure to be followed in order to perform. "If anybody would like to perform, they contact me," stated Fanning. "I don't audition anyone. If they want to play, I trust that they're good enough and have enough songs." 
The style of music varies from folk singers and guitarists to the jazz combo. "We try to keep it pretty diversified,'' Fanning stressed.

Staff Reporter 
Assistant Director of Student Activities John Reid announced the assignment of places for concession stands for the remaining home football games. 
Twelve positions are open each weekend for a total of thirty-six over the remaining three home football games. 
Reid stated that the policy of the Student Activities Office was to "service as many students as possible." In keeping with this policy, the Activities Office aw'!rds a stand to a single group if it is considered large enough. 
"If a group is exceptionally large. such as the freshman class, then two dates may be awarded. In some cases. "Reid said, "groups are doubled up at one stand if they

president, said that two residents 
went to the hospital with eye 
injuries. A Keenan freshman, who 
had his tooth chipped related, 
"The pillow was pretty packed; he

were apparently not limited to

However, signs announcing the 
event were evident in the hallway

Rector of Stanford, Brother Via­

no connection between the pillow

represent a small number of students." 
Reid stated that the types of groups eligible include halls, for whom this benefit was originally scheduled; classes, such as the class of '79; and clubs registered with the Activities Office. Classes are usually the largest groups, and thus are awarded two dates. 
Groups must enter a lottery, which assigns locations for the stands. The Student Activities Office holds the lottery and then issues permits to the groups for their assigned spots. 
The group must always have the permit with them and also must abide by health regulations. Health regulations include keeping the hands of the workers clean and the area around the food free from filth, Reid stated.

In a memo to all participating students Reid listed some safety rules such as "keeping grills up off the ground and putting out coals to prevent fires." The fire depart­ment was called to put out a fire "started due to the carelessness in this regard on one occasion last year," Reid's memo said. 
In addition, Reid's office asks eack group for a resume on the amount of food and merchandise sold, and the quantity of materials, such as charcoal, hamburgers and soda, that was used. 
This practice has been helpful in the past, according to Reid, in giving other groups an idea of what to buy and sell. Reid said that many groups sell what they have left over to other groups to avoid waste and reduce losses. 
The Knights of Columbus is given a stand for each game and does not participate in the lottery since the proceeds go to Cervilla. a home for retarded young adults. 
A check of applications this year bv the Activities office found some g~oups to be ficticious. existing only on paper. Reid stated that these "students were operating the stands for personal gain." Reid referred the four students involved to Dean Roemer and all were fined. 
Reid added that the office does not run periodic checks since they "assume the applications to be valid." 
The recent investigation was the result of suspicions within the Activities office about the legiti­macy of some groups. 
Reid concluded that the purpose of the organization is to assist the largest number of students pos­sible. and although he does not want to be a disciplinarian, those who usc ·the concession stands solclv for personal gain will be repri.manded. 
Last year at the Keenan-Stanford game. a protest was filed by Keenan. Originally Keenan lost 6-0, but after the protest meeting, Keenan was awarded the game. 
Yesterday, Keenan beat Stan­ford 18-0. Three players were taken to the hospital. two with knee injuries and one with a possible concussion. Conyers remarked, "Keenan is very strong. We have a strong government, judicial board, and a great spirit in the dorm. We want to do everything well. Stanford has us beat in hockey." (Continued on page 6)

the mediation of problems between the administration and faculty and the research of economic or ~ocial matters relevant to educators. 
Standing committees investigate questions concerning academic freedom and tenure. governance. the status of women and the economic situation of the profes­sion at Notre Dame. Any complica­tions concerning these matters are ironed out by these committees. 
Robinson cited an instance where there was a question in the Academic Council regarding the notification of faculty in cases where their contract was not re­newed. In this situation, a state­ment to the Council from the president of the A.A.U.P. was necessary to resolve the controver­sy. 
Studies regarding salary. retire­ment income. major medical insur­ance. and the education of faculty children are among those gathered thusfar by the Notre Dame chapter. 
Robins-on noted that upon the chapter's recommendation, hteNa­tional A.A.U.P. selected University President Theodore Hesburgh as
the 1970 recipient of the Alexander Meiklejohn Award for "outstand­ing contribution to academic free­dom... The Notre Dame chapter also sends annual figures to the National A.A.U.P. on faculty sala­ries and benefits. Asked how Notre Dame professors rank on faculty compensation, Robinson res­ponded wryly.

opinion 

Thinking? 
It is "more than possible, what with all the studying and learning, sports and rushing around that goes on here, that people do not spend enough time thinking. 
The immediate reply to this statement might be a somewhat indignant. "What? Not me, I spent all night last night thinking. I studied chemistry. ( ... or philo­sophy....or physics, ... <;>r Account· ing)". 
The problem lies in the different understandings of the word ''think­ing·'. There is a difference between "thinking something", and "think­ing about something". 
There are two levels to consider here. On the first level, a person 'thinks' a thought, ''I'm bored". On the second level a person 'thinks about' a thought already conceived. "I know I'm bored, so what do I do?" 
Teilhard Chardin believed that it is this capacity to think on a second level that distinguishes human beings from animals. We not only "know something", that is.we have le?rned it; we ''know that we know"--we can wonder about what it is we have learned. 
We arrange our first level know­ledge into our own specific order of priorities. On the second level, using our knowledge, we form relationships between ourselves and things not ourselves. We decide how we should act, and are able to judge whether or not our actions are right or wrong. People do not do enough thinking of this kind. 
It is not enough to learn the techniques of an operation, whether it be a math problem, or a philosophy treatise. We should also understand what it is we are doing. 
"I can do it, but I don't know what I'm doing." is a typical human complaint. When an as­sembly-line worker connects a blue wire to a red knob, the worker knows what he is doing in the sense that he can say "I am connecting a blue wire to a red knob." He generally has no idea of what he is doing in the sense that he knows why making this connection works in the finished product. 
It is important that we learn to know what we are doing in the deeper sense, and why. We should watch to see what effect our actions have on ourselves and others. We should question ourselves and our priorities over and over again. Are we doing what's good for us? Are we doing what's good for others? (These two things are not neces­sarily mutually exclusive.) It is our responsibility to search for more input and think about it. 
When people say of a book, "Wow, that book made me think," they do not mean that they have understood only the plot or char­acters. They mean they have 
mike richter 
somehow been broadened. They 
have been induced to question and 
reconsider their priorities. 
Our time spent here at school should not be spent only studying and learning skills, but also consid­ering what having these skills will mean to us and the world around us. 
A values seminar is now offered to seniors for the purpose of encouraging them to think. Such questions as: What are we doing here?, What are our goals?, What should they be?, What do we want to make of ourselves?, Will we as Notre Dame graduates have any responsibility to anyone but .our­selves?, What about our com­munity? All these questions should be thought about, not only by seniors, and not only in a classroom once a week. They shouid become a part of us. We should ask them over and over to keep us thinking. 
If we continue to learn, without thinking and questioning what it is that we are learning or how what we learn fits into us as people, the result will be graduates who, like automatons, are capable of per­forming tasks. They will have no conception of what they are doing, or why. They will not know who they are, or where they are going. They will not be aware enough to discern whether what they are domg IS right or wrong, nor realize it is important to know the dif­ference.

Sexism at Rag 
Dear Editor: 

Sexism is a hard enough battle to fight on this campus without the endorsement it has recently been getting from the campus news­paper. I am referring here, not only to its review of Holly's Landing but also its moronic critique of "Char­lie's Angels" and its most recent insult, "Away Cheerleader of the Week." 
Not only is it insulting to those expecting better taste than a pin-up in their campus newspaper, but it is an insult to our own cheerleaders 
who work  very  hard and  receive  
one  token  article  a  year  in  The  
Observer.  

In their attempt to become a mod and relevant facet of Notre Dame life. the editors of The Observer are losing touch with the social aware­ness many are beginning to realize in the "real world." 
The editors should at least be aware enough to realize that com­ments like, "I can't write about "Charlie's Angels" because my editors don't allow me to drool on the copy,'' are not funny. They are insulting. 
The Holly's Landing review has already been criticized, the "Char­lie's Angels" comments were done on a sixth grade mentality and the "Away Cheerleader of the Week" pin-up is nothing more than some­thing for a lonely Domer to think about after he's sure his roommate is asleep. 
IfObserver editors are not aware enough to catch these slip-ups and put a halt to them, perhaps they should recruit an advisor to help them. The students will only begin to respect The Observer when the 
editors begin to.

Dear Editor: 
Although a careful reading of the transcripts from the food sales arbitration proceedings, provided to both halls by Dean Roemer, would dispense with most of the questions raised by Steve Soinnick (in his Letter to the Editor--"Food Sales Decision Attacked), we at Keenan feel obligated to respond briefly in order to set the public record straight. 
First, in regards to the question of common space, Mr. Sonnick bases his attack on an earlier comment made by Fr. Lally which was apparently misunderstood. Certainly the basement of 'Keenan is university property and, there­fore, the location of Za-land alone does not create a legal basis for our claim. However, the laundry room at Farley is university property as well and yet does not constitute common ground for all male residents on the North Quad. 
Furthermore, while not serving as a strictlY, legal claim. Our contention that the present ar­rangement is an infringement on our community space is a valid claim which was not contested by Fr. Lally. The Standford attempt to pick on the technicality of a University definition then, just didn't carry any weight in arbitra­tion. 
Mr. Sonnick then delivered an unwarranted attack on Dean Roe­mer, an arbitrator that they them­selves helped to select. An arbitrator's obligation is to be fair, but not to render a decision which appears acceptable to both sides . Our very resort to compulsory arbitration indicates that neither side could· agree on what was best and thus the decision of the arbitrator cannot be expected to appease both sides totally. To infer, in any way, that Dean Roemer did not approach the proceedings with a fair and open mind would be unjustified. 
_ As far as "copping out" goes, Stanford's interest in community between the halls has not been reflected in their willingness to share the work evenly during Za-land's first few weeks this year. Seeing as how food sales has been the source of conflict between the two halls, its separation would appear to be the answer to our grief. Finally, unlike Mr. Sonnick, we don't wonder about this decision's effect on America; we only wonder why Stanford can't set up their own operation.

WASHINGTON--I keep wracking my brain trying to think what the Great Debate between Gerry Ford and Jimmy Carter could have used, and the only thing I keep coming up with is Howard Cosell. Had Ho­ward been the sole questioner, it's doubtful that anyone would have called the confrontation between the two presidential candidates boring. 
This is the way it would have gone if the League of Women Voters had had the good sense to turn over the debate to America's favorite sportscaster: 
''Good evening, ladies and gen­tlemen. This is Howard Cosell speaking to you from ringside at the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia. We are about to watch a 90-minute debate between two '?lediocre men who, frankly, surpnsed me by getting the nom­inations of their respective parties. I'm sorry, folks, but I'm telling it like it is. 
"Jimmy Carter is practically an unknown politician who squeaked through the primaries to become the Democratic Party candidate. He has little or no experience in government and is as confused about the issues as any man this reporter has ever watched. 
"His opponent became Presi­dent by accident, and Gerry Ford, if you want my honest opinion, will never go down in history with the great ones. Even as the incumbent President of the United States, he just managed to squeak out a narrow victory over the former actor and ex-governor of California who, in my book, was miscast as 'The Gipper' in a 'B' movie titled 'Knute Rockne.' · 
"Now, gentlemen, I am going to ask you some questions and I want tstraight answers. 
"My first question is to you, Mr. 
President. Why did you pardon a · ~ro~k who. admitted to obstructing · JUStice wh1le he held the highest 
office in the land?'' 

"Well, Howard, I thought he had suffered enough. He had been forced to resign from the highest office in the land and I believed that was punishment enough." 
"A likely story, Mr. President, but I just can't buy it. I know for a fact that Gen. AI Haig came to you and proposed a pardon for Nixon before Tricky Dick offered to resign. But that's neither here nor there. My next question.is to you, Mr. Carter. What makes you think you have the experience and ability

"I didn't leave a mess in Georgia. When I became governor there ,;rere 200 separate bureaus ~nd ... 
"Mr. Carter, can we leave statistics out of this? Just answer the question yes or no." 
"Yes or no what?" 

"I thought as much. You're still as confused about the issues as when you started the campaign. All right, let's go on to something else. Mr. President, where do you stand on taxes?" 
"I believe the middle-class work­er should get some tax relief, and I have proposed several bills which the Democratic Congress has seen fit..." 
"Mr. President, may I remind you we're on the air and no one cares what disagreements you have with Congress. Mr. Carter, would you please answer the question?" 
"I believe that if you read my tax proposals, you will see I am for cutting out tax loopholes for the rich and the large corporations and helping the little fellow who cannot avail himself of high-priced lawyers and accountants who ... " 
"I'm sorry, Governor, we have to keep moving along and since neither one of you has answered the question, let me ask this of you. Where do you stand on the FBI and CIA violating the laws of the land, Mr. President?"

"That's your story. Mr. Carter, what do you have to say about Mr. Ford's ridiculous response?" 
Suddenly the sound goes off as Gov. Carter starts to speak. 
Twenty-eight minutes later it is resotred. Cose)l is speaking. "Ladies and gentlemen, as you are aware, we lost the· sound for the past 28 minutes which, in my personal opinion, was a blessing. There doesn't seem to be any necessity to continue this discus­sion because it certainly wasn't the type of debate we had been led to believe it would be.

Horsepower ~---------The Prophesy 
By Lisa Moore 
"He blinded six horses with a metal spike ... " 

There is one emotion which indicates the success of an intensely played and intense­ly felt drama --intellectual exhaustion. After enthusiastically expressing my ap­preciation at the curtain ·call following Peter Shaffer's Equus Saturday night, I leaned back in my red velvet seat realizing that I was emotionally drained after having witnessed -yes, I will venture to say it -the best theatrical production I have ever seen on any stage. 
Equus is a thoroughly modern produc­tion. Stripped of realistic setting and unleashed of conventional boundaries of time and place, it portrays a dissection of the psyches of its two main characters: the seventeen-year-old psychotic Alan Strang (Bill Barrett) and the middle-aged psychia­trist, Martin Dysart (David Leary). 
Some audience members sat on semicir­cular bleachers on the Morris Civic stage creating the illusion of an observation deck of doctors circled around on operating table. Fitting -for we witnessed a gradual . but sure stripping of superficial defenses and the exposure of two souls: one .perverted because of his lack of it. 
The stage was made of stack wood, and resembled in shaped and purpose a boxing ring. Serving as psychiatrist's office, a field of sexual ecstacy, a skin-flick theatre and a dark stable which houses sexual initiation. the stage primarily encloses and faces characters against agressive and fierce opponents which inevitably turn out to be their own personalities. The lighting was expressive and very complimentary to the action, except for one obnoxious follow spot, always abrupt and always a second behind the performer. 
Anthony Perkins, Anthony Hopkins and the god himself, Richard Burton, have played the challenging role of Dr. Martin Dysart on the New York stage. But David Leary, who was the understudy for the Burton show, was superb. With a voice suggestive of Burton's and a domineering and attractive presence, he was the bridge between the audience and the heightened dramatic forms of the play. His brilliant command and control of the character allowed us to sympathize with and share Dysart's strange feelings of envy toward Alan's passion and see the doctor's awakening to his own disease: bondage to a life devoid of fervor. 
Mr. Barrett, who portrayed Alan, did so with ease and sensitivity, yet making Alan appear immature. But the scenes in which Alan triumphantly rides his god, Equua, in a misty Hampshire field exploited all of toe emotion that Shaffer's script offers and his dialogues with Dysart evoke that pleasing blend of amusement and intrigue. 
Times must be a-changin'; a nude scene took place on a stage in.South Bend, Indiana this weekend ... twice. There were no nervous coughs or uneasy snickers. The scene was meant to shock -indeed it did ­you could have heard a horse's breath in that auditorium. The audience had caught the extreme intensity, appreciated it, and responded to it with silence and utmost attention -this is the highest expression of respect an artist can'receive. It is a natural metaphor, this gesture of complete expo­sure, of stripping away the superficial to shed light on an inner truth beyond any psychological garments. And if a nude scene works here in Hoosierland, you know it works. 
The supporting cast, who shared the bleacher seats with some actual audience members left nothing to be desired. We saw each of them in light of their relation to Alan: the magistrate who heard his case, his parents, his girlfriend and his gods, the horses. 
The Romans set their actors upon elevating shoes and gave them huge, symbolic masks to wear. Here, in a modern play which questions society's use for a god, six horses are protrayed by men in brown turtleneck sweaters, 4" high metal "hooves", wearing wire masks which outline the form of horses' heads. Through mime, we actually see horses, though no attempt is made at realism. The power of the human ability to imagine is exploited by a technical designer with a keen sense of symbol. Result: art. 
I had read and studied Equus several times before this Saturday night, and entered that gaudy theatre wondering if I could be genuinely shocked or intrigued by .what it could offer. But when I heard the clomps of those metal hooves on the wooden stage and heard Alan's cry of "Hal Ha!" as his field of worship spun faster and faster. and heard Dysart speak those powerful monologues, I knew different. I knew then the supremecy of the dramatic production over the literary form and felt an empathy with Dysart in the realization that the sensual gut emotion is more truly human than the intellect.

The MagiiiflCeilt Obsession 
By David 0'Keefe 
Michael and Elizabeth Courtland (Ciff Robertson and Genevieve Bujold) repre­sent, as a guest at their tenth anniversary party it, "the last great romance of our time." They are a beautiful young couple, very, rich, very happy and very much in love. 
As the movie begins, the party has ended and Michael and Elizabeth prepare to share an intimate moment of lovemaking_ when cries are heard from their young daughter's room. Michael looks lovingly after Elizabeth as she goes to soothe her baby's nightmare. She is gone too long, and when Michael follows her to the room he into a nightmare of his own. The room is empty; a ransom note hangs from the bedpost. 
The police-are notified the next day and convince Courtland to let them handle the matter. He goes through with the plan that leads them to the kidnapers' hideout. But the abductors escape with the girl and Elizabeth as hostages. The police pursue them, only to have the chase end when the kidnapers' car runs off a bridge, explodes in flames and plunges into the Mississippi. 
Sixteen years later we see Michael at his office, still a very handsome and wealthy man. But his eyes are still misted as they were that night so long ago when the flames of the wreckage were reflected in his stare. It has been 16 years and he has not forgotten, nor has he forgiven himself for their deaths. 
He is looking forward to the business trip to Venice. He had met Elizabeth in Venice, and upon arriving goes to visit the church where he first saw her. As he walks up th aisle, he looks sad, and his thoughts are far away. And then, there in the church, working on the restoration of a religious

''Break heart, I prithee, break ... '' King lear (V,iii) 
Bernard' Shaw's Heartbreak House is packed with a prophetic fury; although not originally produced until1920 it was begun before the war (1913) and it is the most turbulent of Shaw's plays. It illustrates that the playwright was far from cheerful and delightfully eccentric. The pessimistic tone and dark mood of the play suggest that Shaw was coming close to discontent, if not total despair. Shaw's own romantic­ism had been lost in the face of the war, yet he continued to lash out at the aimlessness he thought to be the disease of the times. 
The negative side of the play deals with the tragic, complex confusion and empti­ness of ethical standards and the inability of man to wish, will or create. The positive side of the play deals with every man's search for identity and every man's attempt through contemplation to discover his own real desires. 
Shaw fills the plot of the play with a series of implausible happenings and the entire play has the quality of a dream. The characters themselves are dreamlike and the play has more of the flavor of Alice in Wonderland, a fantasia or a cornucopia of absurd events. 
It was a new mood filled with new dramatic devices for Shaw. He discourag­ed too much concentration on a single character and Frederi~ Syburg, the director of the current ND-SMC production, sue­ceeds in placing a Chekovian emphasis upon the group picture. Nevertheless, individual performances stand out, as they always do in college productions, and several are worthy of attention. 
Through the character of Captain Shot-over, Shaw expresses the idleness and ennui of his characters and Shaw is also able to display his anger at society through the old captain and his desire to "Blow up the human race if it goes too far." 
Daniel Daily, in the role of Shotover, has finally found a part that fits him perfectly. Mr. Daily carefully portrays the eighty-eight year old captain as a Don Quixote who has lost his romantic enthusiasm. Yet Mr. Daily evinces a subtlety that is even greater than this. He gently places the captain somewhere between Quixote's triumphant assertion "I kno\\· who I am and what I can be" and Lear's fearful question "who is it that can tell me who I am?" The most important nuance for the actor playing the role of Shotover is to allow us to see the captain's sagacity as a mask or pose and Mr. Daily achieves this. He has built heartbreak house as his own Noah's ark and he looks comfortable in it. 
Mr. Daily.shares the opemng scene of the play with Bridget Ragan in the character of Ellie Dunn. If Shotover is at home in Heartbreak House, Ellie never quite fits. Ellie's main function in the play is that of a pupil and the entire play turns upon her performance. The house be­comes her classroom where she learns the ease with which her preconceived defini­tions can be penetrated and destroyed by alien definitions. Miss Ragan shows us every side of Ellie and her transition from eager ingenue to a mature woman with a firm willingness to fight for what she wants is achieved with the charm, grace and control of an experienced actress. Miss Ragan has little trouble convincing us that Ellie is shucked of her illusions and that she of all the characters is ripest for a broken heart. 
Michele Roberge. as the mischevi,lu~ fox Hesione, along with Mr. Daily and Mi~~ Ragan, seem to be the only people in thi~ production capable of handling Shaw's language. Matt McKenzie. as Hector Hushabye. has the onlv voice for the comic and at times even fa~cical diction of the play that is so important in marking the casual and intense relationships in the house. but Mr. McKenzie too often weave~ in and out of both a Yorkshire and New York accent. However. he docs let us ~cc Hector as the cool hcro-pt,~cur. a comedic Hamlet and unphilosophil'al Don Juan. who is himself aware that his histrionics are melodramatic and absurd. With the exception of his brief bit of fencing business in Act I. Mr. McKenzie. like Celeste Volz. as Ariadne, rarclv lets us see the person behind the pose.· 
Steve Rogers. as Randall Utterwood. Lous St. Ville as Nurse Guincss and John 
P. Walker as the Burglar. deserve special mention for the manner in which thev capture a true British spirit and a naturalness on stage that Shaw himself would be pleased with. 
The only unfortunate f1gure in Mr. Syburg's group picture is Stephen Hudock as Boss Mangan. Boss is intended to represent Shaw's conception of contempor· ary industrial capitalism. But Mr. Hudock gives us only a caricature of a caricature and we can't believe in him. 
One of the most impressive aspects of the production is the setting and lighting by a newcomer to the theatre department, Mr. David Weber. Mr. Weber's work is the most· imaginative and best executed that I've seen on the O'Laughlin stage. He shows all of the concern for detail that Shaw requires. 
Mr. Weber has the supreme gift of the artist: he knows when to stop. Costume designer, and fellow newcomer, Diana Hawfield, however, does not. I can't help but feel that Ms. Hawfield is too often gratuitously indulging in her own creative fancies. Shaw requires that Miss Dunn be "Nicely but not expensively dressed" -· he does not require that her first act dress look like a .costume let alone baggy women's lingerie.

cannot in all fairness be told suspense and 
without ruining the movie. Suffice it to say 
that the surprises and indentitites revealed 
in the rest of the film constitute a classic 
work of suspense and mystery on film. 
So begins Obession, Director Brian De 
Palma's bold sojourn into the territory that 
up until now has been the .exclusive realm 
of Alfred Hitchcock. From the very 
beginning, Obsession hits like a river to the 
gut and rarely lets go. We are always 
unsure, often confused, and never relived. 
It is an intense movie, emotionally 
exhausting and powerfully suspenseful. It 
is a fine example of an all but forgotten 
formula that has been left to Hitchcock 
alone to develop, most likely because no 
one until DePalma dared to take him on. 
But with Obsession, De Palma designates 
himself heir-apparent to the master of 
psycholocical thriller. 

Cliff Robertson is cast in a very diffecult role. Micael Courtland experiences a vast and varied emotions, often simultaneously, . and Robertson sometimes seems as con­fused by his character as we are. But he is ultimately convincing primarily owing to the versatility that makes him equally adept with the meaningful phrase as the 
with the longing gaze. 

Obsession is a triumph of mind over 
matter. It is so well done that the intrinsic 
improbablility of the plot never becomes 
problem. Our willingness to believe sub­
verts our cynicism and releases us from our 
self-inflicted bondage to realism. Hope­
fully, Obsession marks a new beginning in 
film instead of representing the last great 
romance of our time. . 
Frontie_r Reuisited 
By David Buchbinder 
The allure of that ever receding line of the frontier has long been a major theme of American literature and art. The unknown quantity just beyond the horizon has always driven us to ever greater heights-­or to ever greater depths. . 
There are but two options in relation to the frontier. One can adapt to it, or one can conquer and pacify it, destroying it in the process. Americans, in our ignorance, chose the latter course. The Return of A Man Called Horse, now playing at the Scottsdale Theatre, opts for the former course, giving us in the. process a somewhat romanticiz.ed view of what should have been. 
The Return of A Man Called Horse is one of the better films to appear in South Bend in quite some time. Shifting from the white man's mercenary exploitation and con­quest of he American frontier, to the hypocritical pretense of pre-Victorian England and then back to a romantic construction of our lost frontier, Horse portrays the continuing exploits of Lord John Morgan (extremely well played by Richard Harris) as he seeks to liberate himse'!f and the Yellow Hands Sioux from an apparent hopelessness of existence-­Morgan's in the soul and the Yellow Hantls' in body. 
The film even tells us that there is a legend of such a creature among the Sioux. Historical fact tells us otherwise, and the film alludes to this in a discussion of the asymmetrical property values of the White and Red man. 
Morgan tries. at one point. to explain to his adopted tribe that man owns land. This is incomprehensible to the Yellow Hands who reply, "How can man own land?" Harris can give no reason.; to the Yellow Hands, but the answer is simple, The White men have guns, hence power. 
The cinematography in Horse is excel­lent. The hearty of the Northern Plains as portrayed in the film serves as more than mere backdrop, playing its own part in the dynamic scheme of this film. The musical score, although not perfection, is quite good and often helps to clarigy some subtle points of comparison between the Northern Plains circa 1830 and England of the same period. The authenticity present in all of Harris' frontier films is also substantially retained in this latest attempt. · 
Containing enough adventure and action to entertain most, Horse is still rich in texture and structural depth. One can view the film from perspectives of romanticism, religious allegory or even Twentieth Cen­tury National Liberation. 
It is often said that sequels do not compare to the original film. The Return of a Man Called Horse is an exception to this. It is a must for any fan of the original (A Man Called Horse) but stands by itself as a first rate work of cinematic art.

Oktoberfest arrived early on the St. Mary's campus this year. The two-day long celebration was "a great success" according to Mary Klassen. Social Commision presi­dent. 
Highlights of the Fest included hall decorations, Happy Hour, a beer garden. a Regina dance featuring Sahara and the Marx Brothers' film "Horsefeathers." Campus sidewalks and two of the shuttle buses were also decorated for the event. 
The annual affair, a welcome orcak from tests and papers, was the result of weeks of preparation.

Thanks to the band, Sahara, the Regina dance was a tremendous ;uccess. Baggiano added. 
Regina Hall also went on to win he hall decorating contest with 1mrals in "The Sound of Music" heme. Each floor in Regina was Jecorated by its residents, in a
