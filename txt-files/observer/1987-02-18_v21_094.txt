Whatever happened to all the steelworkers in Pittsburgh? 
I remember driving through the steel mill district while growing up in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. I would sit in the back seat of my dad's car and peek out the window at all the men wearing the funny helmets and carrying lunch boxes and walking everywhere, swarm­ing around the car so that my dad had to drive very slowly. 
No matter when we drove along the stretch of road that was home to the Jones and Laughlin and the U.S. Steel plants, the scene was always the same. Morning, noon and late at night, when the fires from the coke ovens would light up the sky, the stacks would belch smoke and the whistles would blow and the men were there. There were so many of them that they scared me, and I would crouch down in the seat until we left the district. 
I still feel a sort of fear when I drive through the Southside mill district of Pittsburgh, but not because I'm afraid of the crowds of steel­workers coming home after a day's work. There simply are no workers walking the streets; in fact, there's no one there at all. 
You can't help but think of where all the people went, of what all the workers did when the whistle blew for good and the jobs they had planned to have for the rest of their lives were merely casualties of what some people like to call the recession. They seem to have just faded into the unemployment statistics, a footnote in the history of the city they had helped to build. 
I read an article a few weeks ago which gave a glowing report of the nation's economy. Un­employment is down, the economy is on the upswing, and "middle class" Americans are enjoying a higher standard of living than they have in years. 
And if you visit downtown Pittsburgh today, this optimism seems to be well-founded. Bil­lboards proclaiming Pittsburgh to be the na­tion's £1 city pepper the hillsides. Orange detour signs and traffic snarls greet the visitor on every street corner, signals that the city is rebuilding and renovating. 
As much as I love my home city, though, I can't help thinking about the incongruity of elaborate buildings being raised mere blocks from the shells of steel mills. I think about the Glass Palace built in Victorian England, a trib­ute to 19th century industrialization in Britain. 

The glass walls were transparent, however; one could see through them to reveal the social miseries industrialization produced, portrayed by Dickens in such novels as "Bleak House" and "Hard Times." 
It seems that the pattern has repeated itself in American cities of the eighties, only this time it is industrialization which has fallen upon hard times, and the glass palace in Pittsburgh is a monument to the high-technology which has replaced the factories. 
People say such things as "They could get a job if they wanted one" and "They should have seen it coming" when talking about the plight of unemployed steelworkers, as if they deserve their joblessness. Americans don't want to look beyond the display of economic prosperity they have built and see the very real and very human consequences. They pretend nothing happened in cities like Pittsburgh and Youngstown and Gary. 
But anyone who peeked out the back-seat win­dow at the crowds of men swarming around the animated factories of the 60s and 70s still can't believe "it" came and the mills closed. And still can't help wondering what happened to all those men.

Witness recalls horrors of death camp at Nazi trial 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM -A trial wit­ness recounted the horrors of Treblinka Tuesday and the brutal role played by "Ivan the Terrible," the death camp guard who Is­rael says later became Ohio autoworker John Demjan­juk. 
Yitzhak Arad said Ivan and another Ukrainian-born Nazi guard named Nicolai "used to stand near the en­trance (of the gas cham­bers), driving the Jews to their deaths under a shower of blows and beatings . . . using bayonets or metal bars or whatever was avail­able." 
Demjanjuk, wearing the same brown suit he has worn at all his court appearances since his extradition to Is­rael one year ago, listened to Arad's testimony without showing emotion. It was the second day of his trial. 
He leaned forward at times, fiddling with his ear­phones through which he heard a simultaneous trans­lation from Hebrew into En­glish. Occasionally he yawned. 

Demjanjuk, retired now and stripped of his U.S. citizenship, says he is not Ivan the Terrible and never was at Treblinka. 
Arad, whose entire family was killed in the Holocaust, wrote a book on Treblinka and is director of the Y ad Vashem Holocaust Museum. 
He said he came across Ivan the Terrible's name in the testimony of Treblinka survivors and of Nazi SS guards tried in Duesseldorf, Germany. 
"We encountered the names of two Ukrainians, Ivan who was nicknamed 'the Terrible' and Nicolai," Arad said. "They were des­cribed as operating the motors of the gas cham­bers." 
About 850,000 victims, mostly Polish Jews, were gassed to death at Treblinka in Nazi-occupied Poland in 1942-43 during World War II. 
In a 26-page indictment, Demjanjuk is charged with "crimes against the Jewish people, crimes against humanity, war crimes.''

Psychiatrist: surrogate didn't mean threats 
Associated Press 
HACKENSACK, N.J.-A sur­rogate mother who threatened to kill herself and her baby didn't mean it and was simply using "any weapon that she had handy" to keep the biolog­ical father from taking her daughter, a psychiatrist tes­tified Tuesday. 
Mary Beth Whitehead had no intention of carrying out the threats made in a telephone call to William Stern in July, Donald Klein, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia Uni­versity, testified as the trial over the fate of "Baby M" resumed after a six-day recess. 
Klein disputed reports that said Whitehead suffers from mental problems and would be an unfit parent. Those reports, he said, are inaccurate because they look at her only during a difficult period in her life. 

"Whitehead is in a terrible fix right now,'' said Klein, who was called by Whitehead's at­torneys to testify in the un­precedented custody trial over the 11-month-old baby. 
Klein was the first expert wit­ness to disagree with the three reports prepared by mental health professionals hired by the baby's court-appointed guardian, Lorraine Abraham. 
Abraham has said she relied on the reports in recommend­ing that Whitehead be denied custody and visitation rights immediately and that the baby be reared by Stern and his wife, Elizabeth. 
The Tenafly couple hired Whitehead to be artificially in­seminated with Stern's sperm and bear them a baby. Mter the child's March 27 birth, however, the 29-year-old Brick Township homemaker changed her mind, turned down the

Professor says we must continue to protest 
By MARK C. DICKINSON Senior Staff Reporter 
Americans must continue to protest apartheid in South Africa according to Howard University professor Dr. Mary Francis Berry.~ 
During a lecture in the Li­brary Auditorium last night, Berry said that despite U.S. sanctions and the change in the American attitude toward apartheid, "Freedom has not come to the people of South Africa," and added, "I don't know when it will come." 
A member of the steering committee for the Free South African Movement, Berry said Congress has responded to apartheid with "sanctions legislation " but she feels the measures aren't strong enough. 
She also called recent U.S. business disinvestment from South Africa "phoney, play like

disinvestment.'' Berry said 
U.S. companies leave the country but they still sell their products through local workers. 
A professor of history and 
law, Berry said the Free South 
African Movement has pro­
posed that Congress take a fur­
ther step against apartheid by 
providing economic aid to 
neighboring states industrially 
dependent on South Mrica. "If 
we can make the front line 
states independent of South 
Africa. . . it will be another 
death blow to the regime in 
South Africa." 

The group has also called for 
Japan, Great Britain, West 
Germany, Israel and other 
countries to join in multilateral 
sanctions against South Mrica. 
Berry calls sanctions "short 
term pain for long term gain." 
"It is not correct to say that 
there have been no changes in­
stigated by the regime in South 
Mrica," said Berry, referring 
to new government measures 
allowing interracial marriages 
and the sale of alcohol to hotel 
and restaurant guests regard­
less of race. Yet she called 
these measures ''petty apar­
theid." 

Berry said it is important 
that the apartheid issue remain 
visible in the media. The South 
African government thinks it 
can eliminate opposition to its 
policies by censoring the 
country's press, she said. 

Berry asked Americans to continue to fight apartheid by writing letters and sending telegrams to local legislators, but she said "We have our work 
cut out for us." 
Berry's lecture was co­sponsered by Black Studies at Notre Dame, Oaklawn Center and the Decio Foundation. 




Election

Brennan said the elections 
showed a "good turn-out" with 
a total of 3,711 valid votes being 
cast, a figure which roughly 
parallels that of last year's stu­
dent participation. 
All 24 dorms were won by 
either Cooke, Willis or 
Rodgers. In all Cooke was sup­
ported by 18 dorms and Willis 
by 4. Rodgers won 2 halls as 
well as the off-campus vote. 
Grace and Breen-Phillips

dates Cooke and Bink, while 
Willis and Nonnenkamp held 
Zahm and Badin, their home 
dorms. Cooke and Bink carried the remaining dorms, with the exception of Walsh and Lyons, which went to Willis and Non­nenkamp, and Fisher and Dil­lon, home strongholds of Rodgers and Eckelkamp. 

Although acknowledging that "we're excited about the results," the frontrunner Cooke said, "It's a whole new election. Everyone is even again in the upcoming run-off?' 
Willis, who with running mate Cathy Nonnenkamp will oppose them in the upcoming run-off election said," I hope people who voted for other can­didates will realize we are the most experienced ticket with good ideas and a plan for im­plementing them.'' 
Rodgers said he had no com­ment except that "We wish the candidates a lot of luck."

Star Wars deployment decision to be early 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The Reagan administration told Congress on Tuesday that it is moving to an early decision on whether to deploy Star Wars technology in space and defended as legal a key part of its controversial re­search program. 
President Reagan, in a letter to congressional leaders ac­companying an administration report on adherence with arms control treaties, also at­tempted to assure Congress that the United States is abiding by its arms control pacts amid Soviet charges of 
U.S. treaty violations. 
Reagan administration critics--and Soviet leader Mik­hail Gorbachev --have assailed the administration's move toward a so-called "broad" in­terpretation of the 1972 Anti­ballistic Missile Treaty. 
Such an interpretation of the pact, which limits the testing and deployment of missile defenses, would permit a wider range of experiments under Reagan's space-based Strate­gic Defense Initiative, better known as Star Wars. 
Although Reagan has deter­mined that his broad interpre­tation of the pact is legally sound, the administration has held to the more restrictive view of the treaty so far in its anti-missile testing. 
The Reagan administration also said it had informed the Soviet Union that a broad in­terpretation of the treaty was "fully justified." 
Charles Redman, the State Department spokesman, said Soviet negotiators had "solicited our views" on several occasions at the arms control talks in Geneva. "We've responded by explain­ing the broad interpretation and why we believe it is fully justified," the U.S. official said. 
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Tuesday that the Pentagon is putting to­gether a list of Star Wars ex­periments which could go ahead under the so-called "broad" interpretation but which would be banned by the "narrow" view of the pact. 
That list will likely be sent to Reagan within a couple of weeks, Weinberger told the Senate Armed Services Com­mittee. 
He also defended Reagan's right to interpret the treaty, despite what Congress thought it was approving when it adopted the pact more than a decade ago. 
"The president is perfectly within his constitutional and le­gal rights to interpret the treaty," said Weinberger. 
"This president is not unilater­to negotiate new arms control ally changing the interpreta­pacts with the Soviets. Casting tion or the meaning.

Pair of severed legs found by wedding party members 
Associated Press 
CONNERSVILLE, Ind.-A pair of severed legs found in a wooded area during the weekend are believed to be those of a Cincinnati woman reported missing last week, Indiana State Police offi­cials said Tuesday. 
ISP detective Phillip Wiet­holter said a pair of tan suede boots, socks and blue jeans found on the legs had been identified as the prop­erty of Monica Denise Lemen, 21. 
Lemen's father had filed a missing person report with Cincinnati police on Feb. 10 after she failed to report for work at a local bakery. 
At a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Wiethol­ter said family members had positively identified the articles of clothing. Also, Lemen's father told officials he had been with his daughter when she pur­chased the boots. 

The soles of the boots carried markings, which were identified by the same store. 
"In my own mind, I'm sure the victim is Lemen," Wietholter said. 
The detective said Indiana authorities would continue to look for a crime scene, but much of the investigation would be turned over to Cin­cinnati and Ohio authorities. 
The legs were found by members of a wedding party Saturday afternoon in a wooded area near Little Cedar Baptist Church on 
U.S. 52 near Brookville. 

The legs had been severed about 8 inches above the knee with a sharp object.

Recent developments may change abortion issue· 
& a a & a . ,. ~ . --.... ---·_ ­
a a ..__ 
The debate on abortion last Feb. 9 was doubly disappointing. Neither Pro­fessor Maguire nor Father Burtchaell discussed the topic at issue: "Recent developments and reflection provide authentic reasons to reconsider the vir­tually total Christian (sic) disapproval of abortion." The positions they took could have been taken any time in the last 1,000 years. But there actually are recent developments that affect our view of abortion. 
Julian Pleasants 
guest column 
On the one side, modern biology makes it clear that a new human indi­vidual begins life when the genetic ma­terial of sperm and ovum fuse about 20 hours after the sperm has penetrated the ovum. This fact alone may not settle the moral questions of abortion but it makes ridiculous using Aristotle's opinions as to when human life begins, as well as the Supreme Court's profes­sion of ignorance on the subject. 
On the other side of the argument, the very latest developments in the tec­nique of abortion change it from direct killing to indirect killing, and in some cases, from indirect killing to not kil­ling at all. This changes both our way of doing abortion and our way of viewing abortion. The newest method of abortion, still being tested in other coutries, involves a new anti-steroid drug RU486. A woman takes the drug as soon as she suspects she has missed a period and it induces a menstrual flow, whether she is pregnant or not. If a fertilized ovum is present (and she will never know) it is washed out intact by the flow and dies from lack of sus­tenance, not from being torn to pieces by suction. 
Other drugs of the prostaglandin class, still being investigated, could potentially expel older fetuses in good condition. Dramatic breakthroughs in prematur~ infant care, such as use of germfree isolators and artificial placentas, could carry them to term. In such cases abortion would not be kil­ling at all, and a fetus would die only if doubly rejected, by its mother and by the community. 
Changing abortion from direct killing to indirect killing changes the argu­ment against it from the proscription of murder to the prescription of oblig­atory maternal care. The obligation to care for the unborn life now becomes as prescriptive as two of the other obligations Father Burtchaelllisted as being uniquely Christian in the generosity they demand of us. He listed love of the poor, the enemy, and the spouse. 
But the official Church has been far from absolute in prescribing what we have to do for the poor, even when lives are at stake. The cost of a gourmet meal, converted to antibiotics or vac­cines for a Central American dispen­sary, could probably save at least one life. The cost of a year's tuition, if sent to an African bush hospital, could un­doubtedly save some lives, perhaps dozens. 
Neither has the official Church pre­sented the love of enemies in absolute terms, while recommending non­violence, especially to poor peasants with leftist tendencies, the Church al­lows us to do our enemies in, even by direct killing, under some circum­stances. It does not spell out how much we must sacrfice to avoid war with the enemy. If we took all the time we spend watching sports and used it for actions to reverse the nuclear arms race, we could save hundreds of millions from destruction by accidental nuclear war, fast approaching 100% probability. While alerting us to our obligation to peace-making, the Church has not spe­cified its demands on our time. 
Only in the case of a pregnant woman does the offical Church prescribe an ab­solute obligation. This is partly because of the understanding that she took the obligation on herself by the act of in­tercourse. But that is clearly not the case in rape or incest, and that is why many people who otherwise oppose abortion would allow it in such cases. But there are many other cases of un­freedom, and situations in which the extent and risks of the obligation could have have been foreseen. 
The above seem to be authentic reasons, resulting from recent develop­ments, for reconsidering the extent of the official Catholic ban on abortions, and for giving theologians the right, even the duty, to discuss it. But whatever happens or doesn't happen to the offical ban, it must be made clear to Catholics that the ban is neither revelation nor infallible. On this point I am sure that both the debaters agree. 
The Church does not make moral law, and its interpretations of natural law are no better than its understanding of nature. Catholics can and must make up their own consciences on the matter, giving long and respectful considera­tion to the specifics of the official Church's position, but also to their own experience and understanding. What we must hold on to is the essential part of the Catholic tradition, a generous response to the needs of others, even the least of His sisters and brothers.

P.O.Box Q 
Little hope found in homeless and hungry 
Dear Edttor: 
We are not writing this letter to preach about poverty or open a long winded written debate over the prob­lem of the homeless. We are hoping to correct the comments in Marilyn Benchik's column on the impoverished Americans in the Feb. 4 Observer. The poor beggars of Chicago touched her heart and brought her to the clear realization of the American frontier spirit alive and well in the destitute and homeless of our cities. We admire very much the courage of the poor -we ad­mire the guts they have to survive a life not fit for human existence. 
The independence and carefree spirit people idealistically connect with the 
Doonesbury 
poor is another romantic twist to this tale. The hungry and homeless confront daily the problems of survivial, their cares and problems are much greater than ours. We cannot see how a student could actually believe a beggar has more independence than any of us. We have opportunities and resources to ex­pand ourselves as far as any of us ever wished. If you want to naively believe that living on the streets without a fam­ily or friends is independence, than it is still a fantasy you are living. 
These independent frontiersmen of our urban desert are dependent. They are dependent on alcohol and drugs. These dependencies are sickness. The poverty of our nation is the greatest sickness though. Alcohol and drugs might be all these "courageous and in­dependent" people have. Our govern­ment and we, the priviledged class, have turned our backs or done little but offer naive and self -indulgent commen­tary on this very real disease of our land. 
Over this last break both of us par­ticipated in the Urban Plunge, in New York City and Washington D.C. The homeless and poor are not a community full of inspiration and hope. This is not cynicism, this is the truth. The problem of hunger and homelessness is the most immediate problem we are faced with today. There are people going hungry a few yards from Capitol Hill. There are 30,000 people sleeping in the streets of New York city tonight. These acts are neither heroic-nor examples of hardfought independence. These are people victimized by a system that is controlled by a government that is blind to the needs of these people. These are human beings who deserve the right to food and work and shelter. A study done on the homeless in Phoenix found that 91 % of the homeless do not want to be homeless. After working in a South Bend shelter, we know this is true. 
The frontiersmen of America were out seeking adventure. Life on the streets is not an adventure for these people, it is survival. To idealistically comment on the bravery and indepen­dence of these very needy people is to propagate the lies that this country has lived with for too long regarding the homeless. These human beings should touch our hearts, touch them so deeply that we would commit ourselves to en­ding this evil. This would not be another display of romantic courage, it would simply be the right thing to do.

When students strike 




T he power of the people. 
I have never seen it used to 
such effectiveness as I did in 
the months of November and 
December when France was 
filled with striking university 
and high school students. The 
students were unhappy with 
the projected "Devaquet law." 
Alain Devaquet was the 
minister of higher education 
and, although the proposed 
law was not instigated by 
him, he was linked with it in 
the students' and the public's 
eyes. 

Most French universities are 
public. The only entrance re­
quirement is that one must 
have passed the baccalaureat 
Mary Berger 
C'est Ia Vie 

exam at the end of high school. If one succeeds at this, acceptance at a state university is guaranteed. The inscription fees are very low (less than O!Je hundred dol­lars per year) and much gov­ernment aid is given. When one graduates and seeks em­ployment, the reputation of his school does not play a large role in the employer's decision because at this time, a degree from one school is the same as a degree from another. All diplomas from public universities are equiva­lent --the name of the institu­tion does not appear on them. 
The proposed law would have created more require­ments and a selection process for acceptance. Tuition would have risen at certain schools and the same would have been considered "better" than others because the new law would have permitted schools to put their names on the diplomas. 
The students adamantly op­posed these changes for many reasons. For one thing, many students could not have afforded the increase in fees that attendance at a "good" university would have en­tailed. The school my French sister attends is not consid­ered strong In her field of foreign languages. Had the law passed and school reputa­tions begun to play an impor­tant role in career place­ments, she would have had to leave home to attend one of the "better" universities. Stu­dents did not want discrimina­tion or selection to play a part in their acceptance to univer­sities or in their future careers. 
Thus, in the middle of No­vember, the students went on strike. 
They did not attend classes. Instead, they marched in the streets and protested all over France. Huge demonstrations were held In Paris at the Sor­bonne as well as in every col­

lege town. On one of the big­
gest days of the protest, 
almost one million students 
filled the streets of Paris and 
about 6, 000 gathered in 
Angers. Train loads and train 
loads of students from all 
over the country travelled to 
Paris; one group from Mar­
seille even let their feet do 
the talking and made the trip 
on foot. 
Violence was not a part of 
the students' actions. They 
protested calmly and made 
every attempt at peaceful 
negotiation. The government 
did not follow through on 
their end, however, until it 
was too late. 
On Friday, Dec. 4, 1986, Malik Oussekine died. He was 22 years old, of Algerian des­cent, and a real estatte major at the Ecole Superior d'lmmobilier. Despite a kid­ney problem, he participated in sports and was "quiet" as friends reported. 
A large demonstration took place that Friday night and by that time, the atmosphere had become violent. Policemen rode in pairs on motorcycles; one drove and the other perched on back while putting down resistors with a club. 
It is not known if Oussekine was protesting or how in­volved he was In the demonstration. It is known, however, that he was brutally beaten by the police that first Friday of December and died that evening. His death was at first officially attributed to a cardiac arrest or problems with his kidneys. Had he not been beaten, though, he probably would not have died. 
The police brutality was in­humane, but it appear to have been politically neces­sary. Not until after the vio­lence did the government seriously react. Devaquet turned in his resignation, and the proposed law was withdrawn only after cars were turned over and burned in response the innocent young man's death. 
Just as in May of 1968 when student unrest led to all-out, nationwide strikes and unrest, November and December of 1986 may have also made the history books. On the Monday following Ous­sekine's death, an hour was set aside by most people in the country in honor of the young man. A general strike by some of the major French Unions ~as called for Wednes· day, Dec. I 0 as the entire na­tion became involved in what was now a political problem. The strike did not take place, but a nationwide day of protest against police brutality was held. 
The students united behind what they believed in. For two full weeks they did not attend classes but instead organized demonstrations, protested, and worked to communicate with the government. Friends and family supported their fight. No one just sat back and said, "Well, it is all in the government's hands. There is nothing we can do." 
What a great lesson from which to learn. No matter what the cause, if there are supporters who really, truly have faith in their beliefs and there are enough of them, and they push hard enough, 
changes can happen. One cannot sit back and say, "there Is nothing we can do." Whatever you do will make a difference. It may be a small change or a history-making one, but it will be something.

Trial date set for accused Colt Trudeau 
Associated Press 

INDIANAPOLIS -A trial date of April2 was set Tuesday for Indianapolis Colts quarter­back Jack Trudeau, who pleaded innocent to charges of disorderly conduct and battery on a police officer following a fight outside a downtown bar. 
Trudeau and a friend, also charged with disorderly con­duct, claim they were attacked by three other men, who fled the scene and were not pursued by police. 
"See his face?" attorney John Moses said, pointing to Trudeau, who appeared in Municipal Court with both eyes blackened and with a small bandage above his left eyebrow. Trudeau also said he had been struck over the back of the head with a beer bottle. 
Trudeau, 24, and his friend, Joseph C. Venkus, 25, a third­year law student from Oak Lawn, Ill., pleaded innocent to the charges.

Guidry 
continuedfrom page 16 
9-12, but the Yankees and Guidry could not decide if he should receive $850,000 or $825,000 next year. I know $25,000 is a heckuva lot of money, but with those num­bers, couldn't one side or the other have decided the negotiating games should stop so the baseball games could start for Guidry? 
Alexander, a journeyman who has spent considerable time on the waiver list, has nixed an offer comparable to Guidry's. Does he know of some abilities he possesses that he has yet to bless the baseball world with yet, or is he just ar­rogant? Or a bad gambler? 
Stubborn heads have prevailed and the Unsigned Eight, or The Eight Who Must Wait, are out in left field figura­tively instead of literally. The odd thing is that while the four real impact players are out there for the taking, no owners are taking. 
The owners keep telling themselves that they can't use these free agents. Nobody can use a catcher of Parrish's or Gedman's quality or an out­fielder like Andre Dawson? I don't think that's the case. 
Who wouldn't like Tim Raines chasing down balls in center field and leading off? The Dodgers say they are in­terested in Raines but he has priced himself out of their range. How can this be the case for a team that draws three million fans per season? Maybe, if the owners keep tel­ling themselves they can't use them, maybe they will con­vince themselves, if nobody else. 
The owners know they are guilty of collusion in an attempt to slow bidding wars for players going to different teams, and the players know they are being paid ridiculous sums of money. As long as the owners can keep the line on salaries tight, fine. But it 
Mattingly nets biggest award ever 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Don Mattingly of the New York Yankees on Tuesday became the highest­paid player produced by 13 years of salary arbitration, winning a one-year contract worth $1,975,000. 
Reacting to the news from his Tampa, Fla., office, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner hinted he might file a grievance of the award, which surpassed the $1,850,000 contract won last Friday by pitcher Jack Morris of the Detroit Tigers. 
"He (Mattingly) and I were very close to an agreement, but both the player and his agent came back and said they were getting pressure from the union" to go through arbitra­tion, Steinbrenner said. "I'm not sure that's totally ungriev­able. It may be grievable." 
Don Fehr, executive director 
of the Major League Players 
Association, called Steinbren­
ner's charge "patent 
claptrap." 
"This is a bully acting like 
somebody in the corner," Fehr 
said. 
seems mevitable that eventu­ally Steinbrenner or Ted Turner will break the bond and sign a big-name player for big­time money, or another owner will fear they will do so and bid higher on a player to keep the big boys from getting him. It's easy for the players to keep testing the market, but it's not so easy for the owners to keep their wallets closed when a talented free agent is offering his services. 
Either way, the gentleman's 
agreement will be broken, and 
salaries will continue to elevate to new levels of absurdity. 
Perhaps the most bizarre sit­uation to come out of the Un­signed Eight, involves Gedman and Boone. Rumors are blowing around, saying that Boone and Gedman are putting together agreements with their teams. To e'1able them to play at the be~:.ming of the season, each will sign with the other's team. The teams will then swap the players back to their original teams, waiving no­trade clauses in the process, thus giving the exact same ef­feet as if they had signed with their original teams in the first place. 
As with most of the free agent cases, don't you think there's an easier way? 


Stanford, Sorin, Morrissey nail down leads, leave others scrambling in IH playoff hunt 
By GREG ANDRES 
Sports Writer 
Teams scrambled, scratched and clawed for a spot amongst interhall basketball's elite last week. In the final week of ac­tion, teams vied for berths in the interhall post-season clas­sic and the right to be crowned number-one. 
Stanford, Sorin and Morris­sey all improved on their per­fect marks and assured them­selves an opportunity for post-season A-league play. 
Clashes amongst the leaders in each of the three A divisions proved disappointing for each of the underdogs. 
Stanford moved to 7-0 and possession of the Big Sky title with a six-point victory over second-place St. Ed's. Keenan A1 will take on St. Ed's tonight for the remaining spot. 
Sorin, meanwhile, improved its record to 7-0 by taking the Big 10 title from Pangborn. This left Holy Cross, at 5-1, in the second slot with a playoff berth. 
In ACC action finally, Mor­
rissey took out Off-Campus and 
Dillon to clinch the ACC lead. 
One ACC team which will not 
be going to the playoffs but 
which ended the season on a 
positive note nevertheless is 
the Carroll Hall Vermin, which 
strutted to their first interhall 
A-league victory of the season. 
The win was also the first of 
their history. 
The prey of the Vermin, 
meanwhile, was none other 
than ACC-power Dillon Big 
Red. Dillon, unbeaten before 
the start of the week, fell by 
five points, 48-43. 
"We were down by four at half but it was still competitive and we just kept it going,'' noted Carroll player-coach Scotty Lawlis. "Then we went up by five and they got a little rattled." 
Freshman Carroll player Craig Brummel admitted he "never expected it", and conceded Dillon had played without the services of two of its better players. 

It was Brummel's sharp 
shooting, in fact, that kept the 
Carroll hopes alive before 
teammate Bobby Kloska's free 
throws down the stretch could 
ice the victory. As Kloska 
stated afterward, "It was a 
Carroll moment." 

For the Big Red, though, it was their second loss in as many games and it forced a showdown with Off -Campus for the remaining playoff spot to represent the ACC. 
In the B bracket Sorin B at 6-0 was the toughest of the Major Independents, leaving Dillon B2 and Howard to battle to extend their seasons. 
Dillon B1 took control of the SEC at 6-0, with Off Campus right behind at 5-1. 
Stanford B1 took the PAC 10 title at 5-1, edging out Dillon B3 and Morrissey B Gold, teams with identical records of 4-2. The remaining berth from the Pac 10 went to 5-1 Keenan. 
Cavanaugh, meanwhile, glided to a 6-0 record and the ECAC title leaving Grace B2 in second.

Forfeitures, low-scoring contests mark week of women's IH action 

By THERESA KELLY Sports Writer 
Low-scoring and no-scoring games highlighted last week's action as women's interhall basketball continued through the second half of its 1987 season. 
Breen-Phillips A (5-2) took steps to secure a playoff spot by beating Walsh. In a slow­starting game, Walsh led 6-3 after the first quarter and held on to the three-point lead at the half. 
"Neither team had many players, and we were all kind of tired," said Breen-Phillips captain Carol Cavaliere, "but I guess we wore Walsh down at the end.'' 
Wear them down they did. Trailing 15-13 after the third quarter, B-P scored 16 points in the final eight minutes to win 29-19. Ann Curoe led the victors with 14 points, while Walsh fell to 1-4. 
In a game that was also close until the final quarter, Lyons won its third in a row, beating Lewis B 31-17. Lewis protested the game because Lyons was allowed to start with only four players. The fifth showed up at the start of the second quarter with Lewis ahead by four. 

"We had to forfeit our first game of the year because the ref wouldn't let us start with four," said Sheila Horox, the Lewis captain. "And now we lost this game, even though they didn't have five players at the tip-off." 
Lyons is 5-1 and Lewis B 2-3 pending a decision from Non­Varsity Athletics on the protest. 
The Lewis A team fared bet­ter Sunday with a victory over Farley B. 
In other "action" Sunday, Farley A ran its record to 6-1, scoring its fourth straight vic­tory with a forfeit win over Badin. Three of Farley's six wins have been by forfeit. Pasquerilla East remained un­defeated at 7-0, also done the easy way as Breen-Phillips B forfeited. Farley A and P.E. won't be idle for long, though. They play each other on Sun­day In what may be the best game of the interhall season. 
Other upcoming action in­cludes Farley B against B-P A and Lewis B against Walsh (both games tonight). 

Fordham 
continued/rom page 16 
Rookie-of-the-Year, is averag­ing 11.8 points and 6.3 rebounds a game. At the other forward is 6-5 junior Tom Parotta, who 

has scored 9.4 points a game 
and hauled down 3.1 rebounds. 
6-7 Doug Bantom helps out up 
front with 3.1 points per game. 
Senior Frank Williams heads 
up the pivot for the Rams. At 
6-7, Williams has averaged 11.5 
points and 6.3 rebounds. 
"Paterno, Parotta and 
Franco give them a solid group 
of players all about 6-5," said 
Phelps, "to go with Williams 
on the boards and Pedro, a guy 
who really has given them a lift 
with his scoring.'' 
Even without Sean Conner, 
who continues to recover from 
his ankle injury, Notre Dame 
will work to exploit the shorter 
Rams up front. The 15-7 Irish 
will be looking to win their third 
straight before traveling for a 
game at Utah on Saturday. 
"Fordham beat LaSalle once and went overtime with them in the other game," said Phelps, "so that will give them the confidence to play against us. With the MAAC schedule behind them at this point, I'm sure they'll be trying to make an impression with their three intersectional games against us, Texas and Marquette." 
With a strong efort, the Irish hope to leave New York with their 16th victory -and the Rams still looking to make their marks against the Lon­ghorns and Warriors.

Sophomore captain 
Durso helps ND wrestle way to top 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
Two years ago Jerry Durso thought he was headed for 
,. 
Lehigh University, an estab­lished wrestling school near his own home. Instead, the West Millington, N. J. native finds himself as the captain of a team trying to start its own wrestling tradition. 
"Lehigh was about an hour from my house, and I always wanted to go there as a kid," said Durso. "When Notre Dame started to build its wres­tling program, I kind of got in­terested. I liked the idea that the program was building." 
When Irish coach Fran McCann attended the New Jer­sey high school state cham­pionships, he was not aware that Durso was considering Notre Dame. 
"When we went to the New Jersey state tournament, we were recruiting another per­son. We saw Jerry, and we thought he was the best kid in the state, but we thought he was going to Lehigh," said McCann. 
Durso eventually became the last person to sign with Notre Dame that year, changing McCann's first true recruiting class from· a good group to a class that was named the fourth best in the country. 

Fran McCann 
While the Notre Dame team started to establish itself as a squad thateanwrestle with na­tional powers, Durso wasted no time making a name for him­self in the Midwest. 
The. freshman-laden Irish took Clemson and Nebraska to the final match in dual meets, and easily won the National Catholic Invifational that year.~ The 134-pound Durso led the. way with a final record of 38-9. 
"The thing that showed us a lot was when, last year, he won in the St. Louis Open. Not that many freshmen do well in it, but Jerry just came out of nowhere and won it,'' said McCann. "He won it this year, and he has a chance to win it four years in a row, and that's never been done before." 
This year, as a sophomore captain of the young team, Durso has been able to over­come what could be considered an inconsistent start and a mid­s~ason shoulder injury to post a 25-5 record so far. 
"Early in the year, his weight wasn't stabiliz~d, and that affected him mentally," said McCann. "Now, he's in good shape, he feels good, and he's wrestling well." 
Durso also has been able to 
keep the team's disappointing 
1-9 dual meet record and injury 
problems behind him to con­
centrate on his individual 
goals. 
"In the beginning, it was a 
tough thing for everyone to go 
through, but we're at the point now where we're expecting anything. I don't know what else can happen," said Durso. "It was hard keeping team morale because it seemed every day someone was getting hurt, but at the middle of the season, the coach said we have to start worrying about our­selves and individual things." 
One thing Durso can try to achieve is reaching Nationals ­a feat he could not achieve last year after getting injured at regionals. 
"One of our team goals was to send guys to Nationals, and we still can do that~" said Durso. "Individually, my goal is that I want to be an all­American. It's a possibility, but I have to wrestle the best I can. There are no easy matches." 
McCann is a little more en­thusiastic about Durso's chances at regionals. 
"If he's on top of his game and is up and motivated, no one can touch him. I have that much confidence in him," said 

Durso also has built up his individual reputation, and Notre Dame's wrestling reputation, over the last two years. 
"Durso has developed a name for himself. Last week, he wrestled the fourth-ranked kid in the country, and he knew he had to be at the top of his game to beat Durso,'' said McCann. "Before, when you wrestled Notre Dame, it didn't really matter. You just had to show up and win. We're slowly changing that idea. Through in­dividuals we're building our reputation, and we just have to get more people of Durso's caliber." 
Led by Durso, the Irish go on the road to face Illinois State tonight. Notre Dame will be forfeiting 12 points to Illinois State because of injuries to Pat Boyd and Tom Ryan. 
"They're a solid team," said McCann. "It will be tough to win especially in the condition we're in right now."

Irish, Fordham get set for battle in Big Apple 
By ERIC SCHEUERMANN Sports Writer 
NEW YORK -The Notre Dame basketball team is ready for a breather. But the Rams of Fordham promise to be less than supportive in this quest when they take on the Irish tonight at 9: 05 here at Madison Square Garden in the second game of a doubleheader (following the DePaul-Iona contest). 
"We always look forward to playing at the Garden, espe­cially since it's like coming home for David Rivers and Gary Voce," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps. "Having coached at Fordham, I know what playing Notre Dame means to them and that has been reflected in how compet­itive the games between the two teams have been." 
Another tough game should probably be expected from the 13-13 Rams, although the Irish have won three straight over the squad from the Bronx. The Rams are led in the backcourt by 6-3 junior Greg Pedro, a transfer from Michigan State who is averaging 14.3 points and 3.5 rebounds per game. Pedro gives the Rams a three­point threat, as he has made 45 of the bombs while shooting 49 percent from behind the line. 
6-5 senior Joe Franco is the other half of a strong guard tan­dem, averaging 14.8 points and 
3.3 rebounds while also putting in some time at small forward. Freshman Andre McClendon and seniors Lonnie Jones and Eric Brooks give help off the bench in the backcourt.
