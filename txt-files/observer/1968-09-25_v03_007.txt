U.S. Must Apologize? 
TOKYO (liPI )-North Korea said Tuesday the United States must apologize for conducting spy activities in its waters before it will consider releasing the crew of the USS Pueblo. 
It was the first public statement on the Pueblo crew's release by North Korea since the nat ion's 20th anniversary 15 days ago. At that time, speculation ran high the release of the 82 crewmen was imminent. 

Tuesday's declaration was broadcast by the Korean central news agency and monitored in Tokyo. The announcer said the statement appeared in the North Korean newspaper Ro dong Shinmoon. 

Priests Urge Arbitration 
WASIIINGTON (UPI)-A nationwide organization of Roman Catholic priests moved Tuesday to exert pressure on Patrick Cardinal O'Boyle to submit his birth control dispute with 44 local priests to impartial arbitration. 

A spokesman for the 72 year old archbishop of Washington immediately made clear he had no intention of doing so. "Cardinal ()'Boyle's posit ion is that this is a doctrinal matter and is not subject to arbitration or mediation," the spokesman said. 
The call for arbitration came from leaders of the National Federation of Priest ' Councils, whose 120 affiliates represent about half the nation's catholic priests. 
Plot Against Hubie? 
MINNEAPOLIS (UPI) Hubert II. Humphrey charged Tuesday his campaign was the target of highly disciplined, well organized eff6rt to wreck the Democratic Party and the United States. 
The vice president also said Richard M. Nixon may force a defeat of of the Nuclear proliferation treaty by his "stalling" on its ratification. 
llumphrey told a news conference here that those who had been heckling his appearances were "not just hecklers, but highly disciplined, well organized agitators-..sorne of them anarchists and some of these groups arc dedicated to destroying the Democratic Party and destroying this country." 

US. Guilty? 
NEW YORK (UPI) A left wing publication reported Tuesday that the commanding officer of the Pueblo told its correspondent he deliberately moved the intelligence ship into North Korean territorial waters under orders to test the Communist response to such an intrusion. 
The Guardian, which describes itself as an "Independent Radical Newsweekly," said Capt. Uoyd Bucher made the admission Sept. 12 during a five hour news conference and elaborated in a private interview later with Guardian correspondent Lionel Martin.

ASP Unveils New Program 
Action Student Party leader Peter r(elly last night unveiled a three part program of student action which will serve as basis for the ASP Senate campaign. The ASP plan presented at a candidates meeting, calls for restructuring of the University Student Life Council to allow for greater student paricipation, legitimatization of the role of the off-campus student through more proportional representation in the Student Senate as well as revision of university housing regulations, and revamping of the student body constitution. 
Leading off discussion of the program, Kelly contended "Last Thursday we decided to call for Senate consideration of the Student Life Council. Rossie accepted what we called for and thus the Senate elections are scheduled before the Council meets. However, this is not enough to provide for true consideration and representation. We should allow the Senate to review the SLC decisions. I think there ought to be recall if a student member of the Council is unrepresentative. This year the Student Life Council will be the biggest issue in the Senate campaign. If it were not for us, the SLC would have automatically begun its deliberations unrepresentative, circumventing the duly elected Senate, and with no popular check on its actions." 
Concerning off-campus living, Junior Sam Boyle spoke strongly in favor of the ASP program. Boyle maintained "the basic thing about off-campus is that we're five years behind the rest of the university. We have a severe: housing problem and an archaic landlady system_" Blasting the system of certification of housing by the Dean of Students office, Boyle contended "They don't have to live in those 

places." 

Junior Pat Barbolla supported Boyle's stand, detailing his own efforts to obtain permission, with parental approval, to live in an apartment. Bar bolla and Junior Stay Senator Mike Kendall stressed the fact that housing decisions are made by the administration and not students. Kendall remarked "The essential point is that no matter what the Administration had done we still live in a non-representative society." 
The candidates meeting, besides witnessing the three basic ASP points, saw Chairman Kelly unveil plans for a full slate of candidates in the Senate elections. Kelly stated "This is our first opportunity to be a true majority party. Only when the students organize can student influence be achieved_ The University has come a long way in the last three years as a result of our programs_ This is a time for students to say they are in favor of student power-That is why we will run a full slate." 
In a fighting speech on the Senate, Stay Senator Kendall backed up Kelly, contending "The students feel a lot of what 
goes on in the Senate is 
irrelevant. However, the Senate 
can be more than it has been. 
Each Senator maintains a duty 
to represent those who have 
elected him. It is necessary for 
the ASP to offer a choice of 
leadership and clear stands on 
issues. ASP must be both a 
vehicle of true student 
representation and a vehicle of 
student power-
ASP campaign chairman Hill Beyer concluded the meeting with an outline of campaign procedures. Terming the Senate campaign "the most sophisticated and best organized yet," Beyer went on to outline plans for both a campus-wide ASP campaign and campaigns of individual candidates in halls_ 
The ASP Endorsements Committee will meet tonite to consider adding onto the three 
major programs presented last night and consider additional candidates to fill hall slates. As to off-campus, where a profusion of ASP candidates exists, a primary will be held Thursday afternoon at the Library coffee hour to determine five nominees_ 
ASP Chairman Kelly announced, too, that primaries will be used to determine candidates in other halls. At last night's meeting, ASP candidates were announced for fifteen halls with assurances from Kelly that a full slate would be on the ballot. 

Ghost Painters Whitewash Badin 
Mysteriously Monday night, the porch of Badin Hall, or at least most of it, was painted a stunning white (O'Brien off-white as campus regulations stipulate). Permission to paint the sagging structure had been previously refused by the administration. 
Representatives from Badin blamed the men of Sorin, who suspected Walsh Hall, who passed the buck to Stanford, who, in turn, pointed a finger of guilt at the girls of LeMans Hall SMC (who are infamously reknowned for painting visible surfaces and then giving the brush-off). 
Badin Hall president Dave Ryan was forlorn, "Now that the damage has been done, and the aesthetic beauty of our hall tainted, my only hope is that those responsible will finish by some time this week." Badin rector Fr. Burke was equally perplexed and shaken by the experience. 
The only tangible evi dcnce uncovered(besides the remainder of the porch) was a half dozen size-9 white footprints and two white handprints left by an 

apparently clumsy prankster just beneath the porch. Underground reports· indicated that the pamt job 

should be completed by some time this morning. Presently, Chief of Security Arthur Pears is undecided as to whether an 
investigation will be conducted. Meanwhile, an expert from Chicago has been called in to administer lie detector tests.

MBA To Graduate First Class 
The Master's Degree in Business Administration at Notre Dame is alive and well in the new Hayes-Healy Center. 
The  charter  class  of  
approximately  50  students will  
graduate  at  the  end  of  the  

current academic year. 
According to Raymond Murphy, Dean of the College of Business, the program is "a good integration of the Chicmgo and Harvard type program." 
"We are training our students for managerial positions at the division level rather than for staff positions," said Dean Murphy, "The emphasis of the program is on the business mechanism as a whole. This means that there is little specialization in, say, accounting. This has become fairly standard in the MBA programs." 
Under the direction of John 
R. Malone, Assistant Dean of the College of Business, the graduate program is rapidly becoming one of the best in the country. Students have been recruited· from 38 universities and more than 20 states. There are also students from Europe and latin America. 
"We think that we are already competing with the more established programs," said Dean Malone. "We have the already excellent reputation of both the College of Business and the whole university to draw on." 
Dean Malone's enthusiasm has infected the entire program. We have a very ambitious program here," said Business Professor Joseph Sequin. "Thecourses are environmental. We are training our students to assume the role of a businessman in all realms of community life. This includes the social and human elements as well as the day-to-day problems on the job." 
"There is a very challenging program here," said Ronald Malanga, a first-year student. Ted Jacobs, also a first-year student, feels that "this could become one of the best business schools in the country. Dean Malone is doing an excellent job of setting up a first-rate program right off the bat."

Paul Schroeder 
Hypocrisy 

The "dramatic" confrontation between the Hall Presidents' Council and Father Riehle last Sunday night was anything but dramatic. It was long, tedious, ofter inane and virtually inconclusive. Except perhaps it proved that the HPC is not a meeting ground for mental giants. They blew the golden opportunity to watch the Administration rationalize the obvious paradox which exists here. 
In less than a month the Student Life Council will meet with full powers to legislate on all areas of student life. This could be an historic step in the right direction. It is more than a concession to stude'nt power on the part of the Administration. It is a real admission that students deserve a voice in deciding how their lives are to be regulated. 
How then, can the Administration justify the new prefect system, in theory or in practice? Just as everyone gets set to move ahead and grow up, the Dean of Students seems to be taking a giant step back into the dark ages of paternalism. Why couldn't he have waited six month or a year until the SLC could consider the issue? This was the 
question which could have been asked. But it wasn't. Now we are 
faced with the delightful prospect of living for at least another year 
under the aegis of aggravated hypocrisy. 
The new prefect system is an attempt to treat the symptoms and not the disease. This is a disease peculiar to ND that encourages us to live like hypocrites. We are asked to sustain certain rules which are intolerable. Then we are tacitly told to go ahead and break the rules on football Saturdays as long as we don't get caught. What possible good can a prefect do in the Hall while he is saddled with perpetuating blatant hypocrisy. This is a gross injustice to both the prefect and the student and the addition of more prefects to enforce unenforcable rules can only serve to increase the tension. 
What must be done, and done by the SLC, is an innrediate reapp:aisal of the rules. 
The new prefects are here to stay and undoubtedly they can be of immeasurable aid and assistance to everyone concerned. But their value is severely diminished so long as they must work under existing conditions. 
Epithets like "gestapo" are absurd and dangerous. I can't help feeling that certain Student Government leaders are being forced to resort to name calling only to cover up their own political incompetence in permiting the Administration to establish the system unopposed. So, lets face it, you were outmaneuvered politically. But no amount of political power struggling is going to solve this problem. The solution must come from an entirely different arena -an arena in which hypocrisy is recognized for what it is. And I believe we all have a right to expect this type of honesty from the new Student Life Council. 
An integral part of the philosophy of the program is that the businessman should contribute his skills for the good of the community. "However," said Professor Sequin, "we do teams compete with each other on various problems, much as corporations do. Teams are not selected on a random basis, but are arranged so that each team has a fair cross-section of

The interests of the Notre Dame 

ommunity in the questions of birth lation by no means began with the lication of 1/umana Vitae. The longest 
volvement has been that of Reverend hn A. O'brien, now a research professor 
theology. llis work in the area has ranged from the days of the Depression to last July when he signed the Washington statement disavowing the encyclical. 
Father C''l'rie.l has devoted his life to pastoral work in the Church in t~ e fullest sense of that term. lie has served in various activities, such as Catholic Co-Chairman of the Commission on Rei igious Organizations of National Conference of Christians and Jews. But he is probably best known as a writer, as in fact, what usually pejoratively referred to as a popularizer. The far-reaching effects of his three decades of work on birth control should serve as a warning to academicians who scorn O'Brien's work. 
The most distinctive thing about O'Brien studies of birth control is that they reflect his concerns with the Church as it actually exists today in America. Ilis concerns are with the community of the 
1 Church in process. Speaking, for example, 
of his early involvement he says: I have been deeply involved with the problem of birth control for more than thirty years. During the Great Depression in the early '30s, I was greatly concerned with the pi ight of Catholic families. With mill ions unemployed and on public relief, over the prospect ol a new 
pregnancy when they were unable to 
care for the children they already 
had. They stood in dcspcra te need 
of help. "Liv~ as brother and sister" 
in continual continence was not the 
answer to their problem. 
Dr. O'Brien likewise differs from other commentators on the subject that he did not foresee the necessity of breaking with Church's teaching authority. In a book that was in press when the encyclical was pub I ish ed ,Family Pia nning in an h"xpluding Popularicjn, Dr. O'Brien expressed confidence that the Holy Father might approve "all physically 
harmless met hods of birth control excluding sterilization and abortion." ' 
But this confidence did not prevent Fa I her O'Brien from defending his position by signing the Washington statement and further explaining the possibility of going against the encyclical. 
Another aspect of the work on birth regulation done at Notre Dame is illustrated by the massive work of Dr. John T. Noonan, Jr., called 
Contraception: A ,1/istory of Its Treatment by Catholic 111eolugians and Canonists. Published as a result of work done largely here during his stay of several years :.~t I he Law School, the work is a definitive history of the way the ideas of birth regulation have developed. 
Dr. Noonan traces the existence of contraception to Egyptian documents di.!ting around a millenium and a half 1before Christ'. The Kahun Papyrus, while la~king practical applications today, m1ght be cited as an example out of pure historical interest. Its three different

Get Thee To a Nunnery, Girl 
BY 
MARY MICHAEL FARNUM 
The St. Mary's College answer to overcrowded living conditions is not sending upperclassmen off campus to fend for t hemsclves. Instead they send 75 Freshmen to live in the convent.. 
The girls, part of the 413 member freshman class, were chosen randomly to be assigned to Regina llall. Regina llall is the old novitiate. There heing few novices this year, the lloly Cross order leased the building to the college for usc as a dormitory. No one is saying how they decided upon freshmen as the naturai recipients for such 
living conditions. Perhaps freshmen don't run fast enough. 
The rooms arc all singles, with closets designed with the well dressed sister in mind.---t hat is, two feet wide and seven feet high. Certainly not for the girl with 25 Vill<tgcr skirts, or even with one heavy winter coat: There are three phones on a lloor: something that, in the words of one of the freshmen, "should get us all acquainted with each other." 
Senior Resident Counselor Nancy Enright expre~scd optimism at the prospects for Regina llall this year. "It's no longer a convent. That's something that we'd like really to make clear to both St. Mary's and Notre Dame students. We're thinking of giving the dorm a nickname---something like 'the Party Dorm'---to counterract the image." Miss Enright said that the dorm is already on the way to being organized. "We've had several meetings of all the girls, to decide on such things as hall rules." And if signups from activities night arc any indication of a trend, freshmen from Regina also may be instrumental in forming a new SMC Action Student Party. 
The girls questioned seemed generally happy with the Regina set up. They think that the conditions will be ideal both for forming close friendships and good study habits. There was on I y one seriously negat ivc response. A girl wailed: "I mean, how do you tell an ND guy to pick you up at the convent?"

!lis major thesis is closely related to the conclusions of the majority report of the papa I commission. lie stresses throughout the historical rather than the doctrinal, "on the assumption that historical investigation of secondary causes could be fruitful in exploring similar questions which also have t heologica I solutions." Consequently he characteriz~s his history in terms of "tension, reaction, option, and dcve!opment," with regard to the move m c n I bet ween doc t r ina I development and heresy. lie prophesizes by. indirections, then, one might penphcrally suggests that the way out of tl.c present tension will be in the long run 
one fuvorable to the Church as a whole. But only so by indirections. 
In a series of conferences throughout 1963-65. the University hosted scholars from throughout the country to deal with "The Problem of Population." Each of the three sessions related to a different facet of the contraception dispute in the 
Church: moral and theological, practical, and educational. 
Amont the participants in the conference on moral considerations were the moral theologian Bernard llaring, sociologist, Andrew Greeley, Dean Frederick Crosson, and two dozen other representatives from Catholic universities. A consensus was reached with regard to 
nsiblc nthood" the ion of children docs not constitute 
successful marriage, conjugal love bei csscnt ial for the proper cduca t ion children; Catholic teaching "has notubly refined," now that the Gnost threa~ has saf~ly passed, thereby ncccss1tat111g a re111terprctation of the Natural Law argument; and in the raalm of public policy it was deemed imprudent to agitate for a ban on the sale of con I raccpt ions because of the pluralistic nature of our society. There was considerable disagreement, however, as to the infallibility of the encyclical Casli Connubi. Denials of its infallibility were unsuccessful. Haring's more liberal recommendation with regard to the pill was also untypical. 
Demography proper was teh focal concern at the second conference held in 1964. The report is showered with the usual myriad statistics on birth rates, the s1<11~dard cry for action, and the ha 11-hearted recommendation of 1he rhythm met hod as a stop-gap measure. 
The last session dealt with educational policy and seemed to be the most profitable of I he I hrec. Discussions centered around the genera I themes of how the debate should be conducted in the future. A general resolution was d,rafte~ .and submitted to the Papal CommiSSion wh1ch worked under John and Paul. Unfortunately the statement must have been deemed unl'it for public consumption, because, in the words of the editor, "courtesy and indeed reverence for the position adopted by Pope Paul VI require that this statement be released, if it is to be released, by the Papal Commission and not by us." 
The fire around the engine was quickly extinguished. Ryan was physically uninjured. Ryan is a native of Hamilton, Ohio and a four th year Arts and Letters student. He usually goes by the 
name "Dean."
