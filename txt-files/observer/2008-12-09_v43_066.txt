Returned volunteers cite health, education, language as causes ofhardship 
By ROBERT SINGER News Writer 
Barriers to health, education and language, as well as the corrupting influences of racism and sexism, cause economic hardship and social tension in the developing world. according to the 13 Notre Dame students who presented at the "Cultural Differences and Social Change Student Forum" Monday night.

Senior sponsors meal for homeless 
By LIZ HARTER SainlMary's Editor 
Thanks to a Saint Mary's sen­ior, students were not the only ones able to enjoy the Noble Family Dining Hall's annual Student Christmas and Feast of the Immaculate Conception holi-· day dinner last night. 
About 35 guests, including babies and children, attended the event from the Center for the Homeless in downtown South Bend. 
Senior Theresa Klinkhammer brought the idea to Carrie Call, the director for the Office of Civic and Social Engagement (OCSE). The OCSE is a resource center for the College with infor­mation on community service, one-time volunteer events, serv­ice-learning, special speakers and events relating to communi­ty engagement. 
"Theresa was the one with the idea for the dinner and thougbt it was a great opportu­nity for us to share our bounty," Call said. 
Klinkhammer, a resident assistant in Regina Hall, sent an e-mail to her residents letting them know that the guests would arrive on campus at 5 
p.m. and inviting them to attend the dinner. Call sent an e-mail informing the student body of the eve·nt as well. 
Call told students that they

Exams add stress to the holidays 

National study suggests students underprepared for class, finals; have other priorities 
By AARON STEINER News Writer 
According to a national survey, studying and preparing for class is not high on many students' to do list, and as finals approach, this leaves many students feeling nauseous at the thought of exams. 
The most recent National Survey of Student Engagement, released last month, reported that about one in five students frequently come to class without completing readings or assign­ments -just one example of being underprepared. 
That may or may not be the case at Notre Dame, according to Learning Resource Center (LRC) 
NDSP to offer free winter storage 

Service will be available for bikes, cars and off-campus valuables beginning on Dec. 18 

By LIZ O'DONNELL News Writer 
The Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) are offering free winter storage for both on and off cam­pus students, relieving them of worry about the safety of their items. 
NDSP offers three different stor­age areas for current Notre Dame students. 
Starting Dec. 18, students will have the opportunity to store their bikes in Gate D of the football sta­dium. They can drop their bikes off between the hours of 10 a.m. and4p.m.

But with final exams looming in the days ahead, many students reported feeling overwhelmed by coursework, especially exams. 
Senior Apurva Aslekar said he was "stressed" about the work he has to get done in the coming days. 
"I have 45 pages to write by next Monday," he said. 
Junior Gavin Green said that part of the stress is "the build up at the end of the semester" that really makes things difficult.

The release date for when the bikes will be available for pick-up is yet to be determined, but there is also an option of pick-up by appointment. 
For students who will be leaving their cars on campus over the win­ter break, they can store their vehicles in the D2 South Parking Lot. After 5 p.m. on Dec. 20, the area will be locked and will reopen Sunday Jan. 11 at 9 a.m.

CAMPUS LIFE COUNCIL 

CLCpasses Transfer-0 resolution 
Weekend would focus more on student life 
By AARON STEINER News Writer 
The Campus Life Council unani­mously passed its second resolu­tion of the year Monday, calling for Student Affairs to play an active role in Transfer Orientation. 
Meg MacCaughey, chair of the Task Force on New Student Introduction to Notre Dame, said the resolution seeks to encourage greater involvement of Student Affairs in the orientation. Currently, the Office of Admissions organizes the program. 
"We feel that it has a great aca­demic focus," MacCaughey said of the current format, "but not as much the student life portion of it ... and that's what we're really trying to target." 
The resolution asks Fr. Mark Poorman, the vice president of Student Affairs, to consider creat­ing a review committee to see how Transfer Orientation might better integrate the resources of his office, including the Office of Residence Life and Student Activities. 
Council members questioned whether the task force wanted to change the format to be more like Frosh-0. Some transfer students have expressed concerns that the program would be too much like

Fearing winter in the Bend? 
I can't rom em bcr nxpcriencing a winter without snow. I allegedly lived in the South as an infant, courtesy of an Air Foree dad, but if I lived through a winter without loads of that lluffy white stuff, l'vH chosen to block it out of my memory. 
l'vn bnen a proud resident of New 
Hampshire for the  
past fourteen years -well. when I'm  Analise Lipari  
not living in the  
Bend ­ and even if  
there's no snow on  Scene Editor  
Christmas day, you  
can safely have faith  

that tho good stuff will come eventually. 
There's skiing, sledding and snow­
trekking to be had, and it's all pretty 
wonderful. 
Snow has blanketed campus as well, and I couldn't be happier. I love that crunch underfoot as I cross snow-laden sidewalks, and the twinkle that lingers on your eyelashes after the flurries have melted. There's nothing like making snow angels. or having snowball fights (unless you get one of those back-of-the-neck­and-down-the-collar snowball hits that gives you a head cold. Boo). 
Well, at least during fall semester. 
As I look around a campus clothed in white !luff, I can't help feelif1g a slight sense of dread. Like the ethanol perma­doud that blankets our skyline in a weird, light-orangn haze, the dread of what's to come has me spooked. 
What's got me so concerned? The threat of February. 
I know, I should enjoy the moment and not freak out about the future. (I've tried to apply that Iogie to my s(mior year, by tho way, and have soundly failed.) But if then~·s one thing that can dampen my campus reverie, it's the spring semester wintnr blues. 
You know what I'm talking about -or, if you're freshmen, you will. l don't mean more snnw in general. I'm talking about the oppressive cold, bone-chilling winds and tundra-like fenl to campus that set­tles in during that second month of the year. 
You'II recognize its arrival. People start complaining of backaches from walking bent-over across the South Quad wind tunnel. You 'II start making fish faces whenever you come in from the cold, try­ing to establish feeling in your facial m useles. All semblance of a social life beyond your dorm. your classes and your occasional trips for food will cease, unlnss you, brave soul, dare to trek into the wild. 
l decided to go abroad last spring for a variety of reasons: academic concerns, timing issues, et cetera. Hut I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to skip out on spring sernnstnr winter blues. Turns out that it rarely snows in London, and the only time I experienced real "winter" weather while I was abroad was during a canyon­jumping excursion in the Swiss Alps (which was, by the way, totally ballin'). 
Did I miss the winter weather? Sure ­I'd bn a fool to complain about the joys of snow. 
But did I miss February on campus? IInck no. 
Ultimately, the weather is what you make of it: vow to stay positive, and you will. Me, I'm just trying to enjoy the beauty of the moment, because it will innvitably end too soon.

Woo speaks on business education 
Dean emphasizes importance of broader role of industry in society 
Special to The Observer 
Carolyn Y. Woo, Martin J. Gillen Dean and Ray and Milann Siegfried Chair in Entrepreneurial Studies at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business, was a presenter at the first Global Forum for Responsible Management Education, held Dec. 4 and 5 at the United Nations headquarters in New York City. 
In her remarks during an address to U.N. Secretary­General Ban Ki-moon as part of the global forum, Woo urged attendees to refocus business education away from a too­narrow agenda of wealth-cre­ation for owners only to a broader perspective consider­ing the role of business in solv­ing the pressing global issues of poverty, disease and conflict. 
"In subtle but undeniable ways, through our focus and content, we have let our stu­dents walk away from the big­ger picture and the big respon­sibilities," Woo said. "As we go forward, let it not be our negli­gence that we continue to fos­ter an attitude of disconnected­ness from the common good, a disconnectedness that sows the seeds of unbridled self-inter­est." 
Attended by senior adminis­trators from more than 150 academic institutions around the world, the forum provided a platform to advance the con­cept of corporate responsibility and sustainability in manage­ment education. 
At the close of her address, Woo also requested of the sec­retary-general two hours of programming time to further engage business school deans on this message. Immediately after the conference, Ban sent word to the dean that her request was granted. 
The forum in particular cen­tered on the Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME), a U.N.­backed global initiative devel­oped to promote corporate responsibility and sustainabili­ty in business education. Woo spearheaded an international task force of 60 deans, univer­sity presidents and official rep­resentatives of leading busi­ness schools who developed the initiative, which was launched under the patronage of Ban in July 2007. 
Participating institutions, including the Mendoza College, make a commitment to align their mission and strategy, as well as their core competencies -education, research and thought leadership -with 
U.N. values embodied by the six PRME principles. Actions encouraged under the initia­tive's framework include cur­riculum development around the corporate responsibility agenda and research in sup­port of sustainable manage­ment systems, as well as public advocacy and opinion leader­ship to advance responsible business practices. Currently, more than 175 business schools have endorsed the ini­tiative. 
PRME is part of the U.N. Global Compact, a strategic policy initiative for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with 10 universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environ­ment and anti-corruption. 
"PRME is an important coun­terpoint to the direction that business education has taken over the last 60 years," said Woo, who added that the cur­rent analytical framework often turns human endeavors into competitive battles that glorify a winner-take-all men­tality. In contrast, she described how PRME and the 
U.N. Global Compact re-orders priorities, shifting attention to the fundamental canons of human communities. 
"First, human rights takes precedence over all other interests. As such, economic enterprises must serve people and uphold these rights, not the other way around," Woo said. "Second, as a community, by definition, we flourish and advance collectively, not indi­vidually." This last point calls for "mutuality," a balance between what a person or organization takes and what is given back. 


Keane nallled director of Executive Education 
Special to The Observer 
Sharon E. Keane has been named the director of Executive Education of the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame. 
Keane will provide strategic direction to the Executive MBA programs in South Bend and Chicago, as well as executive non-degree programs, which include custom, online, interna­tional and open-enrollment offerings. 
"The deeply rooted mission of Executive Education at Notre Dame has always been to pre­pare individuals for new levels of leadership that emphasizes not only work performance but also personal integrity and responsi­bility to the greater community," Keane said. ''I'm excited to be carrying forward this tradition." 
In her new role, Keane also will be responsible for oversee­ing the transition to a new Executive Education center. Notre Dame recently received a $20 million gift from alumnus Ralph C. Stayer, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Johnsonville Sausage, for the construction of the new center just south of the business school. 
Keane joined the Executive Education program in August 2000, focusing primarily on developing custom programs, which earned c.t BusinessWeek ranking of 15th among Executive Education custom pro­grams worldwide in 2007. Previously, Keane was a vice president of South Bend, Incl.­based Corporate Staffing Resources. She also worked for the federal government for nine years in policy analysis, sales and consulting positions, and served as a legislative assistant to Sen. Hank Brown, R­Colorado. 
Keane earned a bachelor's degree in the Program of Liberal Studies from Notre Dame and a master's degree in public admin­istration from Syracuse University's Maxwell School. 
"Sharon brings to the position a strong understanding of the challenges faced by executives seeking additional education, particularly in today's ever-more complex global business envi­ronment," said Carolyn Woo, Martin J. Gillen Dean of the Mendoza College. 
Founded in 1980, Notre Dame Executive Education provides leaders in the executive and management ranks the opportu­nity to develop and strengthen their leadership abilities and business acumen skills with an emphasis on values-based prin­ciples in keeping with the Notre Dame mission. Today, Executive Education offers degree as well as non-degree programs in South Bend and Chicago, award­ing about 120 MBA degrees annually and delivering pro­grams throughout the United States and abroad.

Erfan said that it is normal for professors to expect more from students. 
"lligher expectations promote learning," she said. 
For those feeling stressed and underprepared for their finals, Erfan o!1ered some suggestions to students as they approach exam week. 
"First, [students] should not panic," she said. "Second, they should take full advantage of the resourcns the University ... has to oll"er." 
Erfan said students should start by arranging a meeting with their instructors to get a bettor idea about their situa­tion, and to find out what resources are available. 
She also said not to "blame yoursnlf"' li1r past mistakns, but instead to correct them. This ineludes reviewing midtnrms, tests and other assignments. 
"Considnr the linal as the last opportunity to learn what the course is all about." she said. 'This way you remove some of the exam stress since you place the focus ... on learning." 
When the final arrives, stu­dents should remain calm and prepare by taking care of them­selves. 
"Go to the exam room on time and in good physical and mental state," Erfan said. "Eating well and sleeping well during exams week can help."

Greek riots continue for third day 
ATI-!ENS. Greece -Gangs of youths smashed their way through central Athens, Thessalonild and other Greek cities Monday, torching stores, buildings and cars in the third day of mayhem after the fatal police shooting of a teenager. 
In the country's worst rioting in decades, dozens of shops, banks and even luxury hotels had their windows smashed and burned as youths fought running battles with riot police. Black smoke rose above the city center, mingling with douds of tear gas. Broken glass littered the streets.

Taliban vows increase violence 
KABUL, Afghanistan -The Taliban's fugitive leader said the planned increase in U.S. troops in Afghanistan will give his fighters incentive to kill and maim more Americans than ever. 
Mullah Omar, who is believed to be sheltered by fiercely conservative tribesman on the Afghan-Pakistan border, said battles would "flare up" everywhere. 
'The current armed clashes, which now num­ber into tens, will spiral up to hundred of armed clashes. Your current casualties of hundreds will jack up to thousand casualties of dead and injured," said the statement, which was written in broken English and posted on a Web site Sunday that has previously carried militant messages. 
Violence in Afghanistan has spiked in the last two years, and 2008 has been the deadliest year for U.S. troops since the 2001 invasion to oust the Taliban for hosting al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden.

"The house shook; the ground shook. It was like I was frozen in my place," said Steve Krasner, who lives a few blocks from the crash. "It was bigger than any earthquake I e':er felt." 
Calling in gay to work is latest protest 
SAN FRANCISCO -Some same-sex marriage supporters are urging people to "call in gay" Wednesday to show how much the country relies on gays and les­bians, but others question whether it's wise to encourage skipping work given the nation's economic distress. 
Organizers of "Day Without a Gay" ­scheduled to coincide with International Human Hights Day and modeled after sim­ilar work stoppages by Latino immigrants -also are encouraging people to perform volunteer work and refrain from spending money.

Puruse auctions off naming of species 
INDIANAPOLIS-Searching for a truly one-of­a-kind holiday gift, one that could bestow a bit of immortality on a loved one or a friend? 
If so, Purdue University has the goods: The school is auctioning the naming rights to seven newly discovered bats and two turtles. Winning bidders will be able to link for the ages a rela­tive, friend -or even themselves -to an ani­mal's scientific name. 
The first of the nine auctions began Monday when the school put up for grabs the naming rights to a tiny gold and black insect-munching bat found in Central America. 
9 I 11 masterminds plan to confess 
Five men seek to formally confess, throwing Gitmo 9/11 trials into confusion 
Associated Press 
GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba -Khalid . Sheikh Mohammed said Monday he will confess to masterminding the Sept. 11 att_acks, throwing his death­penalty trial into disarray and shocking victims' rela­tives who watched from behind a glass partition. 
Four other men also aban­doned their defenses, in effect daring the Pentagon to grant their wish for martyr­dom. The judge ordered lawyers to advise him by Jan. 4 whether the Pentagon can apply the death penalty -which military prosecu­tors are seeking -without a jury trial. 
"When they admitted their guilt, my reaction was, 'Yes!' My inclination was to jump up and say 'Yay!' But I man­aged to maintain my deco­rum," said Maureen Santora, of Long Island City, New York, whose firefighter son Christopher died responding to the World Trade Center attacks. 

Santora was one of nine victims' relatives watching the proceedings, the first time relatives of the 2,975 people killed in the attacks have been allowed to observe the war-crimes tri­als.

PAKISTAN 

Suspected Mumbai. plotter arrested 
Associated Press 
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -Troops raided a militant camp and arrest-_ ed a suspected mastermind of the Mumbai attacks, Pakistan's first reported response to U.S. 'imd Indian demands for action against alleged plotters on its soil, officials said Monj.ay. 
The arrest in Pakistani Kashmir of Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi could signal the beginning of a wider crackdown aimed at reducing ten­sions between the nuclear-armed neighbors and satisfying Washington. 

Lakhvi is. allegedly a member of Lashkar-e-Taiba, a banned group blamed for other attacks on its soil. Analysts say it was created in the 1980s by Pakistan's intelli­gence agencies to act as a proxy fighting force in Indian Kashmir. 
Many analysts suspect elements within Pakistan's intelligence agen­cies keep some links with Lashkar and other militants, either to use against India or in neighboring Afghanistan, but U.S. counterter­rorism officials say there is no evi­dence linking Pakistan state agen­cies to the Mumbai attacks. 
The United States says Lashkar is linked to al-Qaida. In May, the U.S. 
blocked the assets of Lakhvi and three other alleged members of the group, including its leader, Hafiz Mohammed Saeed. 
Indian officials in New Delhi and Islamabad were not available for comment. 
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack did not confirm Lakhvi's arrest, but said the reported raid was a "positive step." 
India says the 10 gunmen who killed 171 people in the country's financial hub on Nov. 26-29 were Pakistani members of Lashkar-e­Taiba. Washington said Sunday the attack was planned in Pakistan.

Anheuser-Busch InBev to cut 1,400 jobs 
BRUSSELS, Belgium -Anheuser-Busch lnBev announced Monday it would cut some 1,400 U.S. jobs -or another 6 percent of its 
U.S. work force -to help save the world's largest brewor at least $1.5 billion a year. 
It said three-quarters of the jobs cut will dis­appear from Anheuser's North American headquarters in St. Louis, both at downtown offices and a campus in suburban Sunset Hills, Mo. 
A letter employees received Monday said affected workers had not yet been notified, and they will likely be people who hold engi­neering, information technology and other corporate positions. Unionized workers at the company's 12 North American breweries will not be affected. 
laid-off workers sieze factory in protest 
CIIICAGO-The nation's grim economy now has a rallying point: Employees at a window­and-door factory that went out of business have taken over the building in a siege that has come to symbolize the woes of the ordinary worker. 
The Republic Windows and Doors factory elosed abruptly last week after Bank of Amorica canceled the company's financing. Since then, about 200 of the 240 laid-off work-· ors have taken turns occupying the factory, declaring that they will not leave until getting assurancos they will receive severance and accrued vacation pay. 
But the standoff has also come to embody mounting angor over the government's willing­noss to bail out deep-pocketed corporations but not average people. 
"There's a simplicity and straightforward­ness to this particular case that anybody can wrap their head around," said James Thindwa, executive director for the Chicago office of Jobs With Justice, a national coalition of unions, community groups and other organizations. 
Apolinar Cabrera, a 17 -year Republic employee, lost his job and benefits just as his wife is about to deliver their third child. 
"I don't know what to do," said Cabrera, 44, who worked in Republic's shipping depart­ment. He has been shuttling between the plant and horne so he can check on his wife. 
Congress proposes 15B auto bailout 
Congress, Bush administrationnegotiate, are optimistic differences will be solved 
Associated Press 
WASI-IINGTON Congressional Democrats and the White House worked to resolve their last disputes Monday over terms of a $15 billion bailout for U.S. auto makers -complete with a "car czar" to oversee the indus­try's reinvention of itself ­that's expected to come to a vote as early as Wednesday. 
Top Democrats gave the . White House their proposal for rushing short-term loans to Detroit's Big Three through a plan that requires that the industry remake itself in order to survive. The Bush adminis­tration gave a cool initial response, saying the meas­ure didn't do enough to ensure that only viable companies would get longer-term federal help. Negotiators worked into the night Monday to resolve dif­ferences. 
"We've made a lot of progress in recent days to develop legislation to help automakers restructure and achieve long-term via­bility," Dana Perino, the White House press secre­tary, said in a statement. "We'll continue to work with members on both sides of the aisle to achieve legis­lation that protects the good faith investment by taxpay­ers."

Eaeh Christmas Day, the Pope deliv­ers a message "Urbi et Orbi" to the City and the World. Last year, Benedict XVI said that at Christmas, "the great hope that brings happiness entered the world." PHrhaps in his Urbi et Orbi this yHar, Benedict will sound again the Christmas note of hope. It would be familiar to the American people who have just elected a President who promises "change" through "the audacity of hope." That political hop(l, however, is different from the hope Benedict sees in the Christmas event. 
In his 2007 annual Christmas address to Home's univecsity students, the Pope urged them to reneet on "the hope of the modern age" as described in his encyclical Spe Salvi ("In hope we were saved."). From the 17th century on, he said, "human progress" was seen as the work only of "science and technology." Heason and freedom were separated from God so as to construct the "kingdom of man ... in opposition to the kingdom of God." In this "mate­rialistic concept ... changing the eco­nomic and political structures... could finally bring about a just society where peace, freedom and equality reign." The "fundamental error" in this, said Benedict, is that man is not merely the product of economic and social condi­tions. "[W]ithout ethical principles, sci­ence, technology and politics can be used, as ... still happens... for ... the harm of individuals and humanity." 
Some changes promised by our pres­ident-elect could serve as Exhibit A for the truth of that last comment. Barack Obama not only pledges that "the first thing I'd do as President is sign th~ Freedom of Choice Act," which would remove all restrictions on the "funda­mental right" to abortion.-He also strongly supports, and co-sponsored as a Senator, federal funding of embryon­ic stem-cell research (ESCH) beyond the limited funding allowed heretofore. Each embryo is a living human being. In ESCR, human embryos are pro­duced, by cloning or otherwise, for the purpose of killing them by removing their stem cells which are then used for biomedical research. This is not only wrong in itself. It opens the door to the mass production of human beings as objects of science, the cre­ation of "designer" human beings, etc. 


In his 2002 book, "God and the World," Cardinal Joseph Hatzinger, now Benedict XVI, discussed the description in Genesis 3 of the posting of angels east of Eden with naming swords to keep man, after the Fall, from eating of the Tree of Life (p. 133­138). After the Fall, man was forbid­den to eat of that tree which gave immortality, "since to be immortal in this [fallen] condition would ... be perdition." People are now, llatzinger said, "starting to pick from the tree of life and make themselves lords of life and death, to reassemble life." "[Pirecisely what man was supposed to be protected from is now actually hap­pening: he is crossing the final bound­ary ... [Mian makes other men his own artifacts. Man no longer originates in the mystery of'love, by ... conception and birth ... but is produced industrial­ly, like any other product." 
This is serious business, indeed. "[WJe can," said Ratzinger, "be certain of this: God will take action to counter an ultimate crime, an ultimate act of self-destruction, on the part of man. He will take action against the attempt to demean mankind by the production of slave-beings. There are indeed final boundaries we cannot cross without turning into the agents of the destruc­tion of creation itself, without going far beyond the original sin and the first Fall and all its negative consequences." 
In' this presidential interregnum we already know that the "hope" offered by our political messiah includes the utilitarian abuses described above. In that "hope," man can be treated as an object and the intnntional killing of the innocent is an optional problem solving technique. Perhaps some Catholics, especially in the professoriate, will come to reconsider the enormity-and frivolity-of their voting into power a politician committed to the implementation of such a "hopP." 
Christmas tells a different story. Christmas overturned "the world-view of that time. which ... has become fashionable ... again today. It is not ... the laws of matter and of evolution that have the final say, but reason, will, love-a Person ... who in Jesus has revealed himself as Love." Spe Salvi (SS), No. 5. 
The smart guys of the media, the · academy, and the politieal world can't tell you where you came from, where you are going and how you get there. But "Christians ... have a future: it is not that they know the details of what awaits them, but they know in general terms that tlwir life will not end in emptiness. Only when the l'uture is cer­tain as a positive reality Iis itl possible to live the present as well." SS, No. 2. We know this by experience. We ask ourselves, "What's it all for'?'' We look for answers here but we know there has to be more. "[W]e nm1d," said SS, "the grnater and lesser hopes that keep us going day by day." But "any­one who does not know God, even though he may entertain all kinds of hopes, is ultimately without hope, without the great hope that sustains the whole of life." SS, No. 27. 
So what is the lesson of Christmas? As Pope Benedict said last year, it gives us the "great hope" that is true. That hope transcends political counterfeits because the Person born at Christmas is, himself, Truth with a capital T. In him we "have a future." Merry Christmas.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Thanks, -wom.en's soccer 
f 

On behalf of the entire Notre Dame community, I would like to thank the women's soccer team. Your season was an inspiring show of excellence that made everyone proud to be Irish. Throughout the year, you constantly demonstrated your fighting spirit by never becoming complacent. It was clear you were striving to improve every game, always hungry for improvement, which is a difficult level of effort to maintain when you're undefeated. Your first~class behavior on and off the field has made you well-respected and loved by your peers, and we are all so proud of you. The last game of y<mr season didn't go as you planned; this does nothing to weaken the incredible performances that marked your entire year. Keep your heads up and be proud of yourselves. We are.

Crennel working despite job fears

lie has to. It's his job. For at least three more wonks. 
Cronnol, who will likely be f'irod onco the Browns finish this disheartening season, reit­orated Monday that hn isn't worrind about reports that he will be replaced al'tor his fourth year. It's out of his hands, so Crennel. down to playing his third-string quar­terback because of injuries, is f'oeusing only on getting his team rnady to play its last three games. 
"It's tough when you lose. I don't earn what the circum­stances," Crennel said of the engulfing distractions. "If you're in this profession, you don't like losing. But you have to get up every day and do the best that you can. and if the coaeh doesn't get up and do the best he can then it's hard for the players to do the best they can." 
On Sunday, the Browns (4-9) lost for the fifth time in six games, 28-9 to the Tennessee Titans. The loss guaranteed Cleveland its eighth losing sea­son in 10 yoars since returning to thn NFL as an expansion team. The Browns, who have not s1~ored a touchdown in three wneks, are on the verge of another rebuild. 
The hammer will come down soon. 
Changes are coming, with Cre.nnnl nxpncted to be the first to go. Owner Handy Lerner said he will not make a deci­sion on his coach or general manager Phil Savage until after the season. but Crennel's 24-37 record without a playoff appearanee is enough to justify a switch. 
Formnr Pittsburgh Steelers coach Bill Cowher is believed to be Lnrnpr's top ehoiee. llownver. Cowher. who now works as an analyst for CBS, has not indicated whether he will rnturn to coaching. Cowher enjoys his TV gig and recently said lw's leaning toward stay­ing in broadcasting for another yoar. 
If Cowher isn't an option, or is signnd Plsewhern, former Browns eoaeh Marty Schottnnheimer could be. 
ESPN .com reported that Clnvn I and is formulating a backup plan to bring baek 
Schottenheimer if Cowher can't 
be lured out of semi-retire­
ment. Sehottenheimer coached 
the Browns from 1984-88, one 
of the franchise's most success­
ful stretches in the past 45 
years. Sehottenheimer, who 
was lin~d in 2006 by San Diego 
despite leading the Chargers to 
a 14-2 mark, won three divi­
sion titles and went to two AFC 
ehampionship games with the 
Browns. 
Schottenheimer did not 
immediately return a phone 
message_sceking comment. 
On his weekly show on Sirius NFL Hadio, the 65-year-old Schottenheimer was asked if he was in the mix to coach again in Cleveland. 
"I don't see that as being likely at all," he said. "First of all, nobody has presented me with an overture and, secondly, I've kind of aligned myself and my lifp kind of where it is and if thPy want to pay me $30 mil­lion a year I'll have to talk about it. I don't see it (as being) likely." 
Obviously, Schottenheimer was joking about the salary, but Lerner will likely pay what­ever's necessary to get his team, which won 10 games last season, turned around quickly. Crennel has three years remaining on a contract exten­sion he signed after last sea­SOil. That deal is worth close to $4 million per season. 
Schottenheimer was driven out in San Diego because of a personality clash with general manager A.J. Smith. By the end of Sehottenheimer's tenure, he and Smith weren't talking. 
Cleve land's situation hasn't digressed to that point, but Crennel and Savage don't seem to connect, a problem Lerner wants to resolve with his next hire. Schottenheimer said his departure in San Diego would have no bearing on his desire to return to the NFL. 
''I'm a football junkie," he said. "There's no doubt about that. I enjoy it. But that doesn't put me necessarily in a situa­tion where I want to stand there and have every moment that I'm there, making deci­sions and all. The key for me is people. That is the most impor­tant thing." 
Sehottenheimer's experience could make him attractive to Lerner in another role, possibly in Cleveland's front office or on Cowher's stafT. Cowher was an assistant to Schottenheimer with the Browns and later in Kansas City, where he was Schottenheimer's defensive coordinator.

Phelps to publish autobiography 

Associated Press 

Jason Lezak was nearly a full length behind Frenchman Alain Bernard on the final turn of the 400-meter freestyle relay at the Beijing Olympics, putting Michael Phelps' bid for a historic eight gold medals in jeopardy. 
Rut Bernard made "a stu­pid, and what would turn out to be colossal, mistake" that allowed Lezak to pull out an amazing comeback victory. 
Phelps recalls the moment in a new book, "No Limits: The Will to Succeed," avail­able in stores today. 
"After the flip, instead of swimming in the middle of his lane, he had drifted to the left," Phelps writes. "That meant that Jason, now to Bernard's left, could again tuck in behind him. Bernard was d·oing the hard work. Jason was cruising, preparing to slingshot by Bernard." 
Lezak touched the wall first with the fastest relay split in history, helping the U.S. win in a world-record time and give Phelps his second gold of the games. 
In the book, co-authored by Alan Abrahamson of NBCO!ympics.com, Phelps describes himself as a kid who was given to whining and crying, and with his big ears and scrawny build, was con­stantly being picked on. In sixth grade, he was diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperac­tivity disorder and a doctor prescribed the stimulant Ritalin. 
Phelps took three doses daily during the week, includ­ing a lunchtime dose that required a trip to the school nurse's office, which made him stand out among his elassmates. 
By seventh grade, Phelps told his mother he wanted to stop taking·Ritalin. 
"I viewed it as an unneces­sary crutch," he writes. He was weaned off the med­icine. 
"I had proven to myself that I could set a goal and. through willpower and being mentally tough, not only meet 

that goal  but beat it,"  he  
writes.  
Phelps'  mother,  Debbie,  

became a recognizable face in the stands at the Water Cube during the Beijing Olympics. But his father, Fred, was not there and is never mentioned publicly by Phelps. 
In the book, he offers a brief glimpse of their early years together, recalling how his father took him fishing and to Baltimore Orioles games. 

"He taught me to look peo­ple in the eye when I was m·eeting them and to shake hands like I meant it," Phelps writes. "Unquesti"lmably, I inherited my competitive ath­letic drive from him. If I was playing sports, no matter what it was, my father's direction was simple: Go hard and, remember, good guys finish second." 
Phelps' parents were high school sweethearts in a mill town in western Maryland. Fred Phelps, who had played small-college football, moved out of the family's home when Michael was seven, the same year he started swimming. 
"As time went on, we spent less and less time together," Phelps writes. "Eventually, I stopped trying to include him in mv activities and he, in turn, ·stopped trying to involve himself in mine." 
Phelps writes that the last time he saw his father was at his sister Whitney's wedding in October 2005, and they didn't speak. 
"There just hasn't been any­thing to say for a while," he writes. "Maybe there will be later." 
In November 2004, a few months after winning six medals at the Athens Olympics, an under-21 Phelps was charged with DUI. In the book he recounts how his first phone call was to his agent, rather than his mother or coach Rob Bowman, both of whom he said he knew would yell at him. 
Later, he called Bowman, who was supportive but told him, "Michael, just because you want to blow off some steam doesn't mean you can be an idiot." 
Debbie Phelps cried at the news. 
"That hurt worse, maybe, than anything," Phelps writes. "I had never seen my mother that upset." 
In Beijing, Phelps was asked after winning his sixth gold medal what he would say to people who suspected his feats were aided by doping. 
"I know, for me, I am clean," he said. "I purposely wanted to do more tests to prove it." 
Phelps, along with team­mates Dara Torres and Natalie Coughlin, volunteered for extra drug testing leading up to the Olympics.

Associated Press 
LAS VEGAS -Greg Maddux grew up with the same weekend ritual as so many other American kids. 
Tagging along with his big brother, he would run down to the park to play ball against the older guys from the neighborhood in regular Sunday scrim­mages. 
He met a pitching coach who preached movement over velocity, and pretty soon Maddux was striking out those stronger teenagers. Nearly three decades later, he walked away from baseball Monday as one of the greatest pitchers to put on a uniform. 

After 355 wins and 23 major league seasons, Maddux held a 30-minute news conference to announce his retirement on the opening day of the winter meetings -just minutes from his Las Vegas home. 
"I really just came out here today to say thank you," he said in a ballroom at the swanky Bellagio hotel. "I appreciate every­thing this game has given me. It's going to be hard to walk away obviously, but it's time. I have a family now that I need to spend some more time with. I still think I can play the game, but not as well as I would like to, so it's time to say goodbye." 
Next stop, the Hall of Fame. 
Wearing a casual shirt and slacks, Maddux spoke softly on stage and never appeared to get choked up. His parents and family -including brother Mike Maddux, the Texas' Rangers pitching coach and a former big leaguer himself -sat in the front row. 
A large poster with pho­tos of Maddux hung behind the podium. He wa.s introduced by agent Scott Boras, who said "Mad Dog" had a "model" career. 

Maddux leaves with four consecutive NL Cy Young Awards (1992-95) and a 
3.16 ERA, especially impressive in the steroid era. He ranks eighth on the career wins list, with one more victory than Roger Clemens. 
"I never changed," said Maddux, who turns 43 in April. "I think, hey, you locate your fastball and you change speeds no matter who is hitting." 
Maddux spent his final season with the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers. finishing 355­
227. His remarkable resume includes a record 18 Gold Gloves, including one this year. · 
IN BRIEF Star quarterback McCoy to 
stay at Texas another year AUSTIN, Texas-Texas quarterback Colt McCoy confirmed thathe'll return to the Longhorns for his sen­ior season in 2009. 
McCoy has led No. 3 Texas (11-1) to a Fiesta Bowl matchup against Ohio State with 3,445 yards passing and 32 touchdowns, both team records. He's also the team's leading rusher with 576 yards and is expect­ed to be a finalist for the Heisman Trophy this week. 
''I'm not going anywhere," McCoy said in an interview published Monday on the Austin American­Statesman's Web site. 
McCoy said he wants to try to win a national championship next season after falling one spot short of the Bowl Championship Series title game this season. 
McCoy has said all season he plans to be back next year, but said recent­ly that he would at least inquire about his potential draft status. 

Wittman out, McHale in 
as Timberwolves coach 
MINNEAPOLIS -Kevin McHale is leaving Minnesota's front ofl'ice to coach the wayward team he assembled, returning to the side­line after Randy Wittman failed to turn around the rebuilding fran­chise. 
McHale stepped down as Timberwolves vice president of basketball operations on Monday, a position he has held since 1995, to become the coach after owner Glen Taylor fired Wittman. 
The job is not an interim one. McHale said he "plans on being here" for the long term and gen­eral manager Jim Stack and assistant GMs Fred I--loiberg and Rob Babcock will take over h-is executive duties for the remain­der of the season. 
Now it's up to McHale to breathe some life into a team that wasn't responding to the hard­nosed Wittman. 
NFL's career scoring
leader Anderson to retire 
COPENHAGEN, Denmark ­Kicker Morten Andersen, the NFL's career-leading scorer, is retiring because of knee prob­lems. 
The 48-year-old Dane, who scored 2,544 points during his 25-year career, played for the Atlanta Falcons the past two seasons but wasn't able to get a contract this year. Andersen said Monday he has given up his search and his NFL career. 
"I realized I no longer can train in an optimal way because of my knees," Andersen told The Associated Press in a phone interview. "So I am retiring." 
Andersen said that his knees were worn out after so many years as a professional player. 
"It's not that I cannot kick, play golf or go bicycling, but it's not the same anymore," he said.

NCAA FOOTBALL 
Sarkisian faces tough task as Huskies coach 
Associated Press 
SEATTLE -Steve Sarkisian has already been successful selling air. 
So, heek, selling 105 Washington football players, plus wavering recruits, angry fans and turned-off boosters on how he will quickly turn around their rock bottom Huskies should be no prob­lem. 
''I'm going to bring a lot of passion to these kids. We just have to change the way they think," Sarkisian said after bning introduced as Washington's third coach in Jivn years Monday morning. 
Al'ter ending his career as a quartnrback in the Canadian Football League a decade ago, the former star at BYU briefly worked in the dot-com world. 
"I was selling vapor. We hadn't even made a product ynt -but I was selling it," Sarkisian said with a huge smiln. 
Minutes earlier, a couple hundred fans, cheerleaders, alumni and students chanted "Sark!" and the school's band played "Bow Down to Washington," as Southern California's offensive coordi­nator was hailed as the Huskies' anti-Tyrone Willingham, Sarkisian's failed predecessor. 
"I love it. Wow, what a moment!" a wide-eyed Sarkisian said, looking to his lef't past his wife, his 6-year­old daughter, Ashley, and 3­year-old son, Brady. 
There, he saw four shirtless students who had S-A-R-K painted in Husky purple on their chests. 
"I can't wait to get this thing going," he said. 
The 34-year-old Sarkisian got a Jive-year deal worth $10 million plus incentives for his first head coaching job as the third-youngest coach in major college football, after Lane Kiffin of Tennessee and Pat Fitzgerald at Northwestern. Sarkisian will continue to coach USC through its Rose 
Bowl on New Year's Day against Penn State, while recruiting for Washington. 
lie met with his new team on Monday morning and said his first calls to Huskies recruits were going to be Monday afternoon. 
Sarkisian's task seems as tall as nearby Mount Rainier: Turn around a once-proud program that just completed the first 0-12 season in Pac-1 0 history. Washington was the only winless team in major college football, and Willingham was 11-37 in his four seasons with the Huskies. 
"It's going to happen fast," Sarkisian said at a news con­ference at Husky Stadium's Don James Center -named after the coach who led the Huskins to Rose Bowls and national championship con­tnntion, the standard against which Sarkisian will be judged. 
Sarkisian promised to open practicns and the program to boosters, fans, alumni and media. That would be the opposite of Willingham's closed-ranks regime that chafed many around the for­mer powerhouse. 
That would also model the 
program run at USC by 
Sarkisian's mentor, Pete 
Carroll. 
Former Trojans linebacker 
Lofa Tatupu, now a star with the Seattle Seahawks, said Sarkisian has the same energy · and enthusiasm for games and especially practices for which 
Carroll is renowned. 
How open are USC's .prac­
tices? In Los Angeles, rapper 
Snoop Dogg and other stars 
frequently drop by, just for 
fun. 
"Might be tough to get 
Snoop up to the Northwest for 
practices," Tatupu said, 
laughing in the Seahawks' 
locker room in suburban 
Renton. "But Sark's got pull." 
Carroll brought Sarkisian to 
USC as an assistant in 2001, 
made him quarterbacks coach 
the following year and then 
added the title of offensive 
.coordinator in 2007. The 
Trojans are going to their 
eighth bowl. including their 
sixth Rose Bowl as Pac-1 0 
champions, since Sarkisian 
and Carroll arrived. 
Sarkisian spent one year 
with the Oakland Raiders as 
quarterbacks coach in 2004 
before deciding he belonged 
in college football. 
His Washington contract 
starts with a base salary of 
$1.7 5 million in the first year 
and incrementally increases 
each season, up to $2.3 mil­
lion in 2013. It includes incen­
tive clauses worth up to $1.25 
million for championships and 
bowl appearances, something 
the Huskies haven't had since 
2002. There's another 
$250,000 available for reach­
ing academic performance 
goals, plus unspecified bonus­
es for season tickets sold for 
all sports. 
"We think we got our guy," 
university president Mark 
Emmert said. 
Some critics are likely to 
scoff at Washington trusting 
the rebuilding of a program to 
a 34-year-old with no head 
coaching experience. To that, 
Huskies athletic director Scott 
Woodward scoffed back. 
MLB 

Players, teams meet in Vegas 
Yankees, Dodgers have eye on Sabathia as negotiations begin 
Associated Press 
LAS VEGAS -The team names are spelled in lights on a huge board at the Bellagio Race and Sports Book, above dozens of padded brown seats: The Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs are 5-1 co­favorites to win next year's World Series, followed by the Los Angeles Angels and New York Yankees at 6-1. 
Twenty-six teams in all are listed. Sorry, no room for San Diego, Washington, Kansas City and Pittsburgh. 
Viva Las Vegas. 
Welcome to a winter meet­ings like· no other, where the lobby bar sells not hot dogs but Tzar Imperial Transmontanous caviar and foie gras terrine. 
"We're 6-1? That's crazy," Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said. 
General managers, walking the marbled floors past per­oxide blondes in revealing outfits, can head to a black­jack table and then go back to their suites to take a roll on a pitcher or two. 
Joe Maddon, manager of the AL champion Rays, had lunch with free agent Milton Bradley. Chicago Cubs man­ager Lou Piniella was talking in the middle of the casino 
· later in the day. 
"In the old days, the winter meetings would not have taken place here," said Arizona's Roland Hemond, who's been attending these sessions for about a half-cen­tury, "but times change and the game grows. What's a lit­tle difficult is it's so spread out here." 
With 3,933 rooms, the Bellagio can hold even more people than the Opryland (2,881) in Nashville, Tenn., where the meetings were held last year. While that hotel has 
. restaurants that shut down each night far before baseball executives, this is a 24-hour town, perfect for all-night trade-talk sessions. 

"Anybody got a motor 
scooter to get back?" Braves 
manager Bobby Cox quipped 
in the meeting area before 
heading back to the lobby. 
"It's a long walk." 
There's a fake Eiffel Tower 
and Brooklyn Bridge in 
Vegas, but GMs were looking 
for the real thing. 
CC Sabathia and Francisco 
Rodriguez were in town over 
the weekend, so teams want­
ing to make a bigger splash 
than the 1,200-nozzle foun­
tains outside the hotel could 
get an early start on the 
meet-and-greet sessions. Just 
12 of the 171 free agents had 
finalized contract agreements 
ahead of the four-day session. 
What happens in Vegas 
stays in Vegas, or so they say. 
But while it was hard to say 
how much would actually 
happen this week, teams 
were talking shop by early 
Monday. 
After meeting with 
Cashman, Yankees manager 
Joe Girardi and adviser 
Reggie Jackson on Sunday, 
Sabathia met with the GM for 
the second straight day. New 
York made a six-year offer to 
Sabathia more than a month 
ago. 
"We're not being played. 
We're not been manipulated. 
We're not being used," said 
Cashman, who said Sabathia 
was being deliberate in his 
decision-making. 
San Diego general manager 
Kevin Towers indicated the 
Chicago Cubs were the only 
team currently in the running 
to acquire 2007 NL Cy Young 
Award winner Jake Peavy. 
The Padres are trying to 
trade Peavy to trim payroll, but Towers pointed out that the Cubs might need to move some players before a deal ·· could be struck because they agreed to a $52 million, four­yeiu contract with pitcher 
Ryan Dempster. 
"At the end of this week, I'd 
like to know if there's enough 
pieces for a potential deal," 
Towers said. "I don't think it's fair to our fans or our ball­club to drag this thing on." 
Los Angeles Dodgers gener­al manager Ned Colletti said he hadn't heard from repre­sentatives for free-agent slug­ger Manny Ramirez and pitcher Derek Lowe after extending offers. 
"I sense Derek doesn't want to be here," Colletti said. "We're not spending much time to persuade him." 
Colletti also is trying to fill two holes in the infield and he met with representatives !'or free-agent shortstop Rafael FurcaL 
"If Manny Ramirez shows up at spring training in Glendale, Ariz., we'll find him a hat and find him a jersey," Colletti said. "But I can't wait until that day to pursue a third baseman, a shortstop, a starting pitcher." 
Asked if the Dodgers could get in on talks to sign Sabathia, Colletti said: "It's a possibility." 
Detroit and Texas complet­ed the first trade of the ses­sion. The Tigers acquired catcher Gerald Laird from the Hangers in a deal that sent right-handed pitching prospects Guillermo Moscoso and Carlos Melo to Texas. 
Also, pitcher Greg Maddux held a news conference to announce his retirement. The winter meetings are being held just minutes from his Las Vegas home. 
In other news, Major League Baseball planned a Tuesday news conference with the players' association to announce changes designed to strengthen wood bats. Players still would be allowed to use maple bats, however. And former Yankees second baseman Joe Gordon was elected to the Hall of Fame by a 12-member Veterans Committee. 
Also, MLB Advanced Media, the sport's Internet division, announced it was laying off 20 employees, about 4 per­cent of its staff.

Notah Begay, a four-time PGA Tour winner and col­lege teammatfl at Stanford with Tiger Woods, was one of only two qualifiers who fac(HI the to u giHH T PC Stadium course in tlw final round. Two shots below the cut line with four holes to play, Begay ran off three straight birdies for a 67 to make it by one shot.

The par putt broke just enough to tlw right to catch the high -side of the hole and eurl in. giving Collins a 67 and a spot on the PGA Tour. 
"I finally have a home to play, and it's on the greatest tour in the world," Collins said. "It's going to take a while to sink in."

Former Yankee Gordon elected to Hall of F arne 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -Joe Gordon joined former teammates Joe DiMaggio, Lou Gehrig and Bob Feller in tho Hall of Fame. 
For the likes of Joe Torre, 

Jim Kaat and Hon Santo, it 
was another shutout. 
Gordon was eleeted Monday by a 12-member Veterans Committee com­posed of llall members and historians that studied pre­1943 players. A nine-time All-Star, the late second baseman won five World Series titles with the New York Yankees and Cleveland. 
But another panel made up of the living 64 Hall of Famers didn't come dose to picking anyone who started after World War II. Santo fell short, followed by Kaat, Tony Oliva, Gil Hodges and Torre. 
This marked the fourth straight time that nobody was chosen from the newer group. 
"It's not our job to vote someone in," Hall of Fame manager Dick Williams said by phone from Las Vegas, where the results were announced at baseball's win­ter meetings. "It's our job to consider the candidates." 
"I thought Kaat would get in. I voted for him. And I think Joe Torre will, too, when he's done managing," he said. "I missed quite a few times before I got in. I know what that's like." 
It took 7 5 percent -48 votes -for election and Santo did the best with 39. The former Cubs slugger led Kaat (38), Oliva (33), Hodges 
(28) and Torre (19). 
"We just didn't have them lined up, I guess," Williams said. 
Rickey Henderson is the leading candidate in the upcoming Ilall election by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Results will be announced Jan. 12. 
Induction ceremonies in Cooperstown, N.Y., are July 26. 
Gordon got 10 votes, one 
morn than nfleded. He began 
his career in 193R with a 
championship Yanknns team 
that included future llall 
members -DiMaggio, (;nhrig, 
Bill Dickey, Hod HutTing and 
Lefty Gomez. 
"Flash" Gordon playnd in 1948 with tho last Indians team to win the World Series. lie finished in l 950 alongside future llall of Famers Larry I>oby, Lou Boudreau. Bob Lmnon, Early Wynn and Fellnr. 
Gordon was tlw 1942 AL MVP, beating out Triple Crown winnnr Ted Williams, and hit .268 ovnrall with 253 home runs and <J75 HBis, big power numbers for second basemen in that era. lin died in 1978. 
"To mo. he was a major Hall of Farner," Feller said by telephone from Las Vegas. "lle'll probably go in as a Yankee because that's where he had most of his success. But he did well for us in Cleveland. 
"lie was a wild swinger at the plate, a free swinger with power," he said. "lie was an acrobat around the bag, he was all over the place in the field." 
Pitcher Allie Heynolds, traded from Cleveland to the Yankees for Gordon after the 1946 season, fell one vote short of election. 
The Veterans Committee format has been changed twice since 2001, when charges of cronyism followed the election of Bill Mazeroski. The 15-member panel was broadened to include every living Hall member. but it didn't pick anyone in three elections. 
"When our board of direc­tors restructured the Veterans Committee after the 2007 ldection. it did so with the goal of ensuring the voters the living Hall of Famers would review their peers," llall chairman .Jane Forbes Clark said Monday. "The proeess was not redesigned with the goal of necessarily electing some­one." 
The veterans panels will next vote on players in 2010. Managers, umpires and executives will be eonsid­ered in 2009.

Happy Birthday: You can settle differences and complete unfinished business this year. A unique twist of fate will have you moving in directions that you never considered in the past. It will be a time of new beginnings and second chances. A change in lifestyle or your home will help your state of mind. Your numbers are 4, 10, 16, 23, 31, 35,47 
ARIES (March 21-April19): Stop waiting to see what everyone else is going to do when you are the one with the ideas and wherewithal to make things happen. It's your own reluctance that will hold you back when you should be making changes to support your latest goals. *** 
TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Don't be fooled by someone who just wants something from you. It's important to do things for the right reason so you don't have any regrets. An opportunity is available that can stabilize your professional position. *** 
GEMINI (May 21-Jnne 20): Tum everything yot) do into an event. Include all your fa­vorite people to join you in whatever you do. It's the teamwork that will put you in a leadership position and help you control the situation around you. **** 
CANCER (June 21-July 22): Avoid anyone trying to convince you to donate your time or cash to a cause you really can't afford to support. Changes regarding an older family member may leave you with added responsibilities. Deal with what needs to be done and move on. ** 
LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Plan a little get together that will reunite old friends. It's time to enjoy some of the end-of-year festivities and to make a decision that will have an effect on your personal life. Don't spend impulsively. ***** 
VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Decide if you are in the right spot geographically. There is something to be said about moving to a location that is closer to work or can bring you greater opportunities for professional or educational pursuits. *** 
LffiRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): You'll be passionate about everything you do but this can lead to emotional upset and disruptions with friends, peers or neighbors. Try to focus on love and spending time with someone special. Keep things in perspective. *** 
SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Don't waste your time trying to convince others to follow your beliefs. You stand a better chance of getting your way by moving forward alone and seeing who joins in. A service you have to offer can be launched with success. Don't let anyone's negativity lead you into rethinking your strategy. *** 
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Make some alterations at home that will please others. Be careful, however, not to disrupt someone else's plans. Opposition can cause delays if you haven't gotten approval. Love should be one of your focuses for future plans.*** 
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Don't be fooled by what others tell you. You can offer help but not at the expense of losing out somewhere else. Put your own plans first. Don't let someone's anger about your choices stand in your way. ** 
AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): If you can pick up part time work or volunteer for something that might lead to full time work, jump at the chance. Don't let an emotional issue stand in the way of an important decision that will influence your future and your earning potential. **** 
PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Don't count on anything or anyone and you won't be dis­appointed. If you put everything you've got into something you believe in, you will make some forward motion. A questionable partnership must be reviewed. *** 
Birthday Baby: You are unpredictable, engaging and sensitive. You are a participant and a demonstrator. You fear little and will always give everything you've got to win.

Seniors looking to go out on top after rough season with bmvl win 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Editor 
Af'tnr a disappointing finish to the rngular season, Notrn Dame seniors have one last chance to end their up and down football carnnrs on a high note. 
Irish captains Maurice Crum, David (;rirnns and David Bruton met with nwdia Monday to dis­cuss tlwir upeoming appear­ance at the Sheraton llawai'i Bowl against the Hainhow Warriors in llonolulu. 
"This truly is my last chance to leavn a mark in the program, and also give those guys who are coming back somnthing to build ofT of." Crum said. "I real­ly do think that will lw a good way just to leave a good tastn in my mouth." 
The stmior class finished their final season with a 38-3 loss to USC in Los Angeles and also dropped their final home game 
to Syracuse the week before. It was lirst time since 2004 that the Irish lost on Senior Day. Grimes was also excited about the opportunity to freshen his breath, so to speak. 
"Kind of take that bitter taste out of our mouth that we had this last month, and get the sen­iors something to be happy about," he said. 
On top of a chance for redemption, Grimes was also excited to get a chance to get away from the bitter cold of South Bend to the sunny shores of llawai'i. 
"I think there's even more energy, because Hawaii, nice weather, beautiful women," Grimes said. 
Notre Dame had a choice of bowl games to pick from but opted to head to Hawai'i because of the uniq.ue atmos­phtlre, the earlier date -the game will be played at 8 p.m. EST on Dee. 24 -that would allow some players to be home for Christmas and of course the women.

This rneovery marked a m~w start li1r Kuhlke. 
"It was the light at the end o!' the tunnel. and I know this sea­son is going to be great." 
Kuhlke said. 
Last November was the turn­ing point of a shoulder injury, whieh would progressively plague Kuhlke in the pool. The diagnosis was made, and KuhlkP was out of activity for four to six weeks. 
"I had a hole in my rotator culT and labrum." Kuhlke said. "We tried cortisone shots and rehab."

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL COMMENTARY 
Miller no longer with SBT

The biggest change is one that the casual fan might not recog­nize. 
Woody Miller isn't writing for the South Bend Tribune. 
Forrest "Woody" Miller has been covering basketball for the Tribune for as long as anyone can remember, including McGraw, who has been the head coaeh at the University lor over 20 years. He is also the longtime Notre Dame baseball and South Bend Silver Hawks reporter for the Tribune. 
It's not hard to wrack up that kind of resume when you've been with the same paper for more than 50 years. 
But the real shame in this change is that Woody was let go as one of the 56 employees eut loose from the Tribune because of the hrrowing eeonomic crisis. This is not to say the paper eould have refrained from firing anyone, but by letting Woody go, they let go a piece of Tribune-and Notre Dame ­history. 
Woody was indueted into the Indiana Sportswriters and SporL<>casters Assodation I fall of Fame in 2004, and started working with the papor in 1955. lie has covered Irish -baseball since then, including the team's two trips to the College World Series t1957 and 2002).
