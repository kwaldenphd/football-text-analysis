Medicare, Social S~curity in'crease would finance medical insurance 
WASHINGTON AP-President Ford sent Congress his proposals for catastrophic medical insurance for older Americans, coupled with increased Social Security taxes and Medicare contributions. 
Ford said the $4.4 billion in­crease he is asking in Social Security payroll tax increases would not cost any worker more than $1 a week and would "insure the financial integrity" of the system. 
To help pay the estimated $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion cost of insuring the elderly against cata­strophic illness, Ford asked that Medicare patients make larger contributions adn that increases in Medicare payment rates to doctors and hospitals be limited. 
Ford asked Congress to act 
pr.omptly on his proposals, which 
he outlined in his Jan. 19 State of 
the Union message. 
Older Americans have "earned 
the right to live securely, comfor­
tably and independently," the 
President said. 
For 32 million Americans on 
Social Security, Ford said his 
program and his 1977 fiscal budget 
would include full cost-of-living 
increases in monthly benefits to 
offset ''the hardships of inflation'' 
Pre -registration deposit deadline

and they would start going out in checks in July, 1976. 
Administration officials said tyhe actual legislation probably would not be completed in time to get to Congress until March. 
At the Capital, House Speaker Carl Albert was asked about the chances for enactment of Ford's 
proposal's and replied:  "I don't  
look  for  much  change  by  this  
Congress.  "  

Ford's announcement of his pro­posal's came just in advance of the nation's first two primaries in New Hampshire and Florida, both states with a high population of retired people. 
Here are the President's major proposals: 
-An increase in Social Security payroll taxes of three-tenths fo 1 per cent each for employees adn employers. The current Social Security tax of 5.85 per cent on covered wages would go to 6.15 per cent in 1977 on a maximum wage base of $16,500. 
The cost to a worker would range from $15 a year for those earning $5,000 to a maximum fo $49.50. The total taxes paid in 1977 would range from $307 to $1,014 for those taxpayers. Under present law the maximum is $895.05 for 1976 and $965.25 in 1977. 
-For protection against catastro­phic health costs for Medicaid beneficiaries Ford proposed cover­age for unlimited days of hospital and skilled nursing facility care. But the majority of beneficiaries would be required to pay up to $500 per year for hospital and nursing services and $250 a year for doctor and medical services. 
And to help with the increased catastrophic medical costs, Ford asked Congress to limit increases in Medicare payment rates in 1977

and 1978 to 7 per cent a day for hospitals and 4 per cent for physician services. 
The cutback is aimed also to slow down the inflation fo health costs 
by pressing doctors  to keep bills  
down  and  hospitals  to  be  more  
efficient.  

-Medicare patients themselves would share the burden of the new insurance by paying 10 per cent fo hospital and nursing home charges after th first day adn by increasing the existing amount of deductible medical services costs from $60 to $77 annually. 
But no Medicare member would be required to pay more than $500 a year for hospital and nursing costs or $250 a year for physician services. 
Under existing benefits, the patient pays the average first day hospital costs adn nothing for 60 days; after 60 days he pays a certain proportion fo each day.

By "gag rules" 
McCrohon: Free press threatened 
-· -------------~--~--~ 

by Terry Keeney Editor-in-Chief 

Maxwell McCrohon, managing editor of the Chicago Tribune, yesterday warned that American freedom of the press is being threatened by "gag rules" on press coverage of criminal trials and pending revisions of the Fede· ral criminal code. 
McCrohon said that court-impo­sed gags on pre-trial publicity may be extended to other areas of press coverage, while the revisions of the criminal code in Senate Bill 1 (S-1) may hinder information-gathering by the press. 
"The question of press freedom is almost as controversial today as it was during the Revolution and immediately before," McCrohon told the audience of 100 in the Library Auditorium in the first lecture of the 1976 Cardinal O'Hara Memorial Lecture Series. 
Unconstitutional gags 

McCrohon cited the ease of a judge in Baton Rouge who held two reporters in contempt of court for violating a gag rule. Although a higher court declared the gag rule unconstitutional, the contempt ci­tations were upheld. "Even though a gag order may be unconstitutional, newspapers must obey it." McCrohon said. 
A judge imposes a gag rule to limit the pre-trial publicity that might prejudice a jury against a defendant. McCrohon argued that little is actually known about the effect of press· coverage on preju­dice against a defendant in a 
Polish woman to sail solo in race around the world 
GDANSK, Poland (AP) -A 45-year-old Polish woman ship­builder has set out to beat two rivals and become the first woman to sail solo around the world. Her big fears are illness and whales. 
Krystyna Chojnowska-Liskie­wiez. mother of two, left this Polish Baltic city last week aboard a freighter carrying her 31-foot sail­boat "Mazurek" to Las Palmas where she'll start the two-year, 30,000-mile voyage. 
Her route leads through the Panama Canal, past Tahiti and Australia, across the Indian Ocean and around the Cape of Good Hope back to Las Palmas. She plans to buy some supplies along the way and get others from Polish freights in different ports of call. 
Her boat was built by her husband, a master yacht maker. It is made of plastic with a 39-foot mast and Dacron sails, and has a small auxiliary engine, Western made navigation instruments and a two-way radio.

Waltraud Meyer of Austria, whose boat is moored in a Spanish harbor, all ready to sail, and Noriko Kobayashi of Japan," Mrs. Choj­nowska-Liskiewicz said before leav­ing Gdansk. 
"But I heard Waltraud was ill and couldn't leave ahead of me. Noriko has just now finished her trans-Pacific crossing and she too won't be able to leave soon. 
"So, perhaps my dream will come true and I'll be the first." 
Mrs. Chojnowska-Liskiewicz holds a diploma in shipbuilding from the Gdansk Polytechnic School. She began sailing as an undergraduate and 10 years ago won a skipper's license. 
"If I didn't believe in myself I would never even think of sailing around the world. I have a record of 12,000 miles sailed as skipper and enough experience to get me through," she said. 
"I only fear a sudden sickness or food poisoning, or some strange accident like being hit by a whale," she said. 
criminal case. 
Even if pre-trial press coverage were prejudicial, McCrohon noted, a judge has at least ten alternatives to imposing gag rules on the press. "Judges have many excellent safe­guards against prejudicial report­ing before choosing between the First and Sixth Amendments,'' . he said. 
The alternative to gag rules include change of venue, perempt­ory challenges of jury members, jury sequestering and re-trial. 
Dangers of S-1 

McCrohon said he was "horri­fied" at the acceptance of Senate Bill 1 by American legal organiza­tions. He claimed the bill seriously threatens individual liberties and hurts the entire criminal justice procedure. 
''The First Amendment which is almost demolished by this bill is the least of our worries," McCro­hon said. 
One section of S-1 provides a IS-year sentence for persons con­victed of passing government clas­sified information to the press, and a seven-year sentence for members of the press who do not report such to government officials. 
"Ifyou think that won't help stop people in all areas of government from giving information, I don't know what will," McCrohon said. 
Another section of the bill would allow public servants a legal de­fense from criminal prosecution if they felt their conduct were auth­orized by law. Calling this provi­sion a "Nuremberg defense," Mc­Crohon noted that this law would 

have aided certain members of the 
Nixon Administration in Water­
gate-related charges. 
According to McCrohon, other 
unsavory features of S-1 include a 
less specific definition of inciting 
to riot and mandatory sentences for 
certain crimes. 
"If I sound like a revolutionary 
about S-1. I'm proud of it," he 
said. 
Handling Hearst case 
McC:rohon cited the recent Chi­cago Tribune handling of an exclu­sive story on the Patty Hearst case as an example of "a new sense of responsibility on the part of news­papers that is long overdue." 
The Tribune obtained a manu­script in the handwriting of Hearst and SLA abductors William and Emily Harris that the prosection intended to use. The Tribune decided to hold the story about the manuscript, which details Hearst's version of her captivity, until after the jury had been selected and sequestered. 
The exclusive story appeared in the Feb. 6 edition of the Chicago Tribune, almost two weeks after Maxwell McCrohon, managing editor of the Chicago Tribune,the manuscript was obtained.

The Democratic Party is about ·to climax its great egalitarian experiment in this vital election year; they are going to try nomination by lottery. That's right folks, step right up, spin the bottle and run for President. No experience necessary. By and large it probably won't matter who the Democrats nominate. The only interesting Democrat in the race is dull, old "Scoop" Jackson. Scoop has taken some pretty tough stands and he has spoken out on some politically taboo issues like detente and busing. His problem is that only insomniacs can hear him speak from beginning to end. 
The other candidates seeking the Democratic nod all look alike. Each one is carefully grooming himself for the role of the true heir to Camelot. The whole business would be depressing if it were not so utterly comical. 
The leading joke by far is "Spread the Bread Fred" Harris. Not since Huey Long has America been blessed with such a loveable, hairbrcHned demigod. Once one of the country's leading hawks and a staunch conservative on economic issues, Harris has since seen the light of day. Amen Brothers. Never let it be said that Fred would be callous enough to. let scruple stand in the way of high office. Fred Harris is the left's answer to George Wallace and he is almost as bright. Lately, he has been promising two chickens in every pot, free pot and an end to all graduated loopholes. This Robin Hood approach to our fiscal crisis may have its appeal but Harris appears to have forgotten that the majority of small homeowners rely on the deduction of mortgage interest, which is a graduated loophole. I guess with all that pie in the sky, the little people won't mind paying higher taxes. 
Indiana's own son, the down-home, good ole boy, Birch Bayh is sure to charm the voters with his curly hair and baby blues. Kicking off his campaign here and speaking in a midwest twang not often heard by his colleagues in Washington, Bayh firmly promised not to invest in the economy of death (whatever that is). Instead he is going to work to make life better for everyone. Gripping stuff, right? That's what I call getting down to the essentials. 
Challenging Bayh's lead in the Mickey Mouse race is Mo Udall. Mo Udall advocates a planned economy. That's not surprising since he is enjoying a one hundred thousand dollar campaign dole from the taxpayers and they can plan on more of the same if Mo is elected. Mo Udall says we need a man of "courage and consistency" for our next president. Judging by his remarks at the Lexington Hotel in New York where he confusingly compared New York City to Saigon, I'd say he has logically excluded himself. 
Terry Sanford, who received the second largest share of matching funds ($214,050), may break way out in the front ... if he gets out of debt. Right now he is one hundred grand in the hole. Fiscal responsibility will be the theme of his campaign. 
Sargent Shriver, a loyal son of Camelot by marriage, may have a chance in Massachusetts if the Kennedy machine can pull the strings. In many respects, Shriver is an appealing candidate except for the fact that he has never held important elected office. Start at the top is Shriver's motto. 
There are more Democrats contending than I can find the space to poke fun at. However, this column would not be complete without honorable mention to that battered warhorse, Hubert Humphrey. Humphrey is not running ... very hard. His strategy is to wait for the party to call him to destiny ... and wait ... and wait.. .. 
Seriously, there is something genuinely tragic in all this. By far the most painful part is that the taxpayer is financing this unsightly mess. The real burn is that for all the rhetoric of "new and imaginative" approaches that these parrots are supposedly offering they are by and large ducking the substantive issues of this election year. Frankly, they are all looking at each other to see who is going to stumble on an issue first. Do they think that a nation which has only recently driven a right wing authoritarian out of the White House is going to leap for joy to elect a left wing authoritarian? 
If this is the best the left can do than liberalism, as it has been understood since the New Deal, has finally gone bankrupt. Its modern apostles are broken records that repeat unfulfilled promises and more of the same programs that have not worked. 
It is ironic that the l?arty which offers so many, offers so little

joni's newest shows changes in her life and st~le 
Someday, in the unfantomable future, when Rock Music has run its full gamut and has died a natural death, the historians will praise the name of Joni Mitchell. They will point to her lyrics and ponder their meanings.tThey will study her distictive musical style and marvel. They will study endlessy, videotapes of her concerts and will be amazed by her ability to steal a thousand hearts at each concert. They will 
send their students to listen to selected 
recordings of her material and tests will be 
taken to see if the students of tomorrow can 
relate to the music of the past. And, one 
the albums over which the student of 
tomorrow will sweat over and desperately 
try to memorize will be "The Hissing or 
Summer Lawns" which was released way back in 1976. 
Why will Joni Mitchell become a great 
artist of our time? One reason is that Joni Mitchell is both a musician and a poetess. Her lyrics are strong and discriptive, filled with images of modern-day life and love. Her music is complex and enticing, played in a seldom-used key with a style that is both flowing yet folksy. Her performances are a study in charisma and sensualness. And her finest quality is that her music actually lives and changes with the 
,

the hiding place--­
changes in her life and in the world. Even though her music is constantly changing, her style doesn't and that is what makes 
her a truely great artist. 
Joni's newest album, "The Hissing or Summer Lawns" is a hint of another change in Ms. Mitchell's life. Her message this time is not one of personal heartbreak and loneliness but rather, one of social commentary and true love. Her music has changed some too, with the emphasis on a driving, jazz-like rythmn section and less on her own high harmonies 
It would seem safe to credit these changes to some events in her own personal life, namely her long-standing relationship with LA Express drummer John Guerin 
wro has affected both her music and her 
li e. 
The changes that has marked her material since her collaberation with Tom Scott's LA Express develops fully in this album and begins to wander off into other realms. Her lyrics now reflect a older and more wiser woman, one that has transcended above most of the personal and has gone on to try to verbalize some of the 

a ~~jesus movie'' that works 
I'm sure we've all seen "Jesus movies," those goody-goody stories with the great­ness of God piled on thicker than the white polish on Pat Boone's shoes. These picture s are usually so fabricated that everyone walks away cynically agnostic. The problem of these pictures are the produc­tion budget is extremely low, the acting is extremely poor and 3, the plot is extremely simple; that is, "Person is mixed up; person finds Jesus; person lives forever in God's grace." 
The Hiding Place, currently playing a limited engagement at the Town and Country II, breaks the mold of typical religious pictures. It is the story of Connie TenBoom and her family during World War II. She and her sister decide to harbor Jewish fugitives in Holland, though they themselves are not Jews. They are caught and sent to a prison camp where they live the tragedy of the political prisoner. The TenBooms are a religious family. It is this faith that helps the two sisters through the pains of the "work camp." so, then, the movie offers insight into a subject rarely dealt with: the plight of the woman in war-time Europe. 
Newcomer Jeanette Clift plays Connie TenBoom and Julie Harris effectively portrays her sister, Betsie. It is surprising that Miss Clift was chosen for such a difficult role, but she plays it beautifully as she moves from uncertainty to confidence in her life. Betsie is the vehicle of Connie's change. She (Betsie) places her life in 
tom walrath 
God's hands and helps Connie find the strength to avade her misery. Several minor roles are played well. Elain Heckart, academy award winner for her role as the mother in Butterflies are Free, is excellent as the worldly wise prisoner. One will also notice Arthur O'Connell in the role of Papa Ten Boom. (He's the guy who sells Crest toothpaste to little kids on T.V.; he's much better here.) 
The "Jesus message" in The IDdlng Place is prevalent but not overbearing. It is, rather, an important part of the story. It is that because His a true story, completely true with every sad detail. The real Connie TenBoom is still living and appears at the finish to tell the audience why she wrote the story, and why the film had to be made. 
It is a story of survival throughout unbearable tortures. It is a depressing story. It is a story of the presence of Jesus in the lives of a family who kept their faith when many more lost theirs. Because it is a true story, this film goes beyond other religious films. Through fine acting and suspenseful filming it becomes an impor­tant film of the World War II, prisoner camp game. The IDdlng Place gives us a chance to see just what went on in the lives of those who were brave enough to harbor Jews from the Nazis. It helps us see that women, too, suffered in prison 
camps .. And it shows how faith in Jesus Christ helped two women through that suffering. I recommend this film for all. 
greatest thrills and frustrations of modern American life. In the dropping of some of her self-pity-evaluations she has also become a viable social critic. All this while 
retaining the beauty of being a hopeless romantic lost amid the glow of the barroom TV set. 
. Side one opens with "In France They Kiss On Main Street", a rollicking,frivolus song that is already getting over-played on some FM stations. It sounds very much like her gold-winning single"Free Man ~n Paris" from her previous \album. The background vocals are quite interesting and upon examination, one will find that she '."as abilly assisted by Grham Nash, David Crosby and James Taylor. The next 
song, "The Jungle Line" is the most haunting song of the whole album. The instrumentation in this song is a Moog Synthesiser and the warrior drums fo the African Burundi tribe. Thats all. Needless to say, the sound is quite different and not quite like anything else in popular or non-popular music. It is however, quite appropriate for the lyrics which are a comdemnation of the New York City jungle, symbolized by the jungle line of the 
Brooklyn Bridge. Words cannot quite describe the feeling one gets from this song because it is, as Joni noted, a "total work concieved graphically, musically, 
lyrically and accidentally-as a whole." Commercially, the song is a bust, but art rarely is commercial and the music moguls won't push anything that will not sell. One mus~ at least try to listen to this cut though, and Just for oneself. The next two songs are of the "Down in the Streets Joni" variety of the previous couple of years. If you liked some of her material from the COURT AND SPARK album, then "Edith and the Kingpin" and "Don't Interrupt the Sor­row" will send you off into a Saturday night haze. The firey "Don't Interrupt the Sorrow," the flip side to "In France, They Kiss on Main St." is Joni at her pouty, sensual best. The brass backup (minus Tom Scott) is outrageous and the bass is dominating, as it does throughout the album . Curiously, a very mellow and introspective song, "Shades of Scarlet ­c.onquering" follows, displaying a vastly different side of Joni. This is material similar to her earliest albums in which she is the eternal flowerchild, the loving virgin. 
Society usually locks up people that have as many sides as this woman but fortunately, they haven't figured out her songs yet. The song also displays some of the hidden musical talent of Ms. Mitchell in the form of some very nice but lonesome piano playing. At this mellow point in your listening experience, the side is over and you must get up and desperately flip over the album. 
The title song, "The Hissing of Summer Lawns" opens up the second side. It is excellent in that respect because the tune is uptempo and jazzy but the emotion behind the song is mellow. It is, as one Grace Hall resident put it, "morning-after music''; exhilarating yet very warm and comfortable. Note too, her incredible control of her voice as a lead musical

song IS almost a scrapbook of her various 
gyles .!hroughout _the years. '.'The Boho 
ance .. first start~ tn the early simple style 
?f the . Folky Jom" but soon revvs up to a 
Jazzy b1g ban~ style of the "Sexy Joni." 
T~e next song IS actually two songs in one, 
With the Johnny Mandel song "Center­
piece" being sandwitched in the middle of 
the Mitchell-penned "Harry's House." 
Her tune is too much like "Court and 
Spark" for my tastes but the inclusion of 
the bluesy "Centerpiece" makes the song 
a hit. The most amazing thing about 
"Centerpiece" is how much Joni Mitchell 
really does sound like Billie Holliday. I 
never made the connection before but it is 
an interesting point for musiophiles to 
ponder. The next song only adds to the 
difficulty of trying to classify her music. 
"Sweet Bird" is another throwback to the early simple style. The only instrumenta­tion is a couple of guitars and her voice still has the clear, piercing style of old. The close of the album is probably the most confusing and emotion-evoking of any of her previous works. This is Joni at her most artistic and least commercial; creating music into tones and tones into audio imagery. If this description is confusing, welcome to the club, because I am confused by this song. There is a point in music when the artist goes off into a tangent that few can follow into. This does not mean that the materiaJ is bad, just difficult. This particular tangent of hers is one in which she combines her voice with a Sacred Heart-style organ, flowing freely between the two. It is not a comfortable song and few will appreciate it, but it is encouraging to see a top artist trying a radically different idea in music. 
The other stars of the album are her bassist, Max Bennett and her drummer­boyfriend-guide, John Guerin. They are the backbone of the whole album and the m_ain people behind _her newer style (along with Tom Scott). VIbraphonist (yes, they are ~oming back) Victor Feldman is good but IS overpowered in the mixing while guitarists Robben Ford and Larry Carleton are dominating but not overly impressive throughout. The inside of the album cover will go well beside your pin-up of Miss December and the outside is another one of Ms. Mitchell's little side projects. The recording quality is average Asylum Rec­ords quality, meaning that you should check out the record before you leave the store. If you own anything above a Western Auto cheapie stereo, you should make sure that t~e pr~ssing is of listenable quality or you will m1ss a lot of the material. 
This album will probably not sell as well as some of her other albums and will probably not get as kind reviews as the last two did. But the album is representative of a change in a great artist's style and as such a landmark, deserves the proper recognition. Musical giants come rarely and they should be appreciated when they are around. Hopefully, we will appreciate Joni Mitchell's genius as much as those kids will in the future.

1ng's thoroughbred is good ---but could be better 
Any album Carole King has made since 
TAPESTRY has been compared to that platinum !Jius best seller. TAPESTRY was not only King's best selling album, but probably her best work period. That disc epitomizes King at her best , crisp lead vocals with perfect harmonies and instru­mentation that complimented King's vo­cals nicely while never becoming imposing. 
She later decided to experiment with different music styles--including a Latin i~~ue~ce and increased instrumental par­ticipatiOn. These efforts did not fare well, expecially commercially, when compared to TAPESTRY. 
In light of this, it seems as if Carole King has returned to same style that character­ized TAPESTRY. As a matter of fact, many of the songs off her new album THOROUGHBRED sound like a few off of TAPESTRY. The opening chords of "Only Love is Real" sounds like a dead ringer for "It's Too Late." 
This is not to slight the album. THOROUGHBRED offers very listenable music and the album grows on you. However, none of the songs tends to distinguish itself with the exception of "Ambrosia." Not surprisingly, this is one of the few songs on the album that does not deal with the usual King themes of amorous confessions or letters of love put to music. Instead, she and co-author David Palmer write about the drink of the gods that offers a form of escape; an escape greatly needed. 
OH AMBROSIA POUR IT SWEET AND 
SLOW I NEED TO BE REPLENISHED I NEED TO OVERFLOW 
LET MY SENSES KNOW YOUR POWER LET YOUR HOLY MIX DISTILL OH AMBROSIA LET MY SPIRIT DRINK ITS FILL 
More typical of the rest of the writing on the album is "I'd Like to Know You Better." The lyrics are a perfect example of the previously mentioned confessions of love. 
I'D LIKE TO KNOW YOU BETTER BEING WITH YOU FEELS SO GOOD TO 
ME  
IN  A  WORLD  OF  DISTRAUG HT  HU  
MANITY  
YOU  HAVE  BROUGHT  ME  TO  MY  

SANITY 
King's vocals are as good as ever. While s~e is not able to belt out a line like Carly S1mon or make you feel like she's whispering in your ear like Joni Mitchell King always manages to convey a stron~ sense of emotion in her songs. This album is certainly no exception. 
Her back-up vocals and those of old friend James Taylor and new friends Graham Nash and David Crosby are also excellent. Russell Kunkel on drums and Leland Sklar on bass provide a light, basic downbeat to match King's simple keyboard 



gregg bangs 
work. Waddy Wachtel and Danny Kortch­mar provide the guitar work. Although most of their playing is basic back-up to the vocals, some of their filler solos are excellent. Tom Scott has a few solos on sax and, if for nothing else, is welcome for the diversification of his instrument. All in all, the instrumentation is very tight. 
THOROUGHBRED is a good album, but it leaves you with the nagging suspicion that it could be better. When King adds the vocals and instrumentation to her songs, the result is fine. The problem has nothing to do with the arrangements but with the songs themselves. King has written better--perhaps she is trying to cover them up with fine production work. This is not to say King should completely abandon her approach to writing, but a few more songs like ''Ambrosia'' wouldn't hurt matters. In fact, it would make something like "I'd Like to Know You Better" stand out. Which is what this album needs----to stand out a little

A program is now being pulled together by the staff of the Volun­
slightly over the past semester, according to Fr. Thomas Stella, the agency's director. 
The recently-expanded agency completed another successful sem­ester in which it again realized its goal of providing various services to the South Bend community with the intention of making a definite impact for the good of the area. 
Stella said the work of the many programs connected with Volun­teer Services has helped dispel the old notions that members of a college community generally care little about the affairs and condi­tions of the communities that lie outside its grounds. 
The agency has been recently expanded through the institution of such programs as the Parish Part­nership, in which students help coordinate and plan parish activi­ties, and the newly-formed Manasa project, which is an arm of the Memorial Hospital. 

Stella said each hall on campus seems to have adopted a certain agency of the Volunteer Services. The halls work with the Services in providing the necessary manpower for the program. 
The staff of the Volunteer Ser­vices is now preparing an informal evaluation of its efforts and pro­grams which will be conducted in late March or early April, accor­ding to Stella. 
The purpose of such an evalua­tion will be to gauge the success of the organization's efforts and mea­sure student reaction to  these efforts. A successful evaluation might also point to programs that might be needed in the community, stated Stella. 
The agency is also about to distribute a booklet on volunteer­ism which wil serve as a guide to the various programs which oper-

Harrises denounce Hearst for 'saving her own skin' 
(continued from page 1) communique about the bank rob­bery. During cross-examination, U.S. Atty. James L. Browning handed Miss Hearst the sawed-off semi­automatic rifle she allegedly car­ried during the bank robbery. She held it in both hands, examined it 
closely  and  identified  it  as  her  
weapon.  
Asked how she could  tell,  she  
said,  ''from  the  stock  and  the  

bolt." 
Browning also sought to impli­cate the newspaper heiress in apparent plans for another, later bank robbery in the Sacramento area. Bailey counseled her to invoke the Sth Amendment against self-incrimination, but the judge barred further questioning on the subject and she remained silent. 
Meanwhile, William and Emily Harris, denounced by Patricia Hearst as enemies who held her captive with death threats, will not testify against her at her bank robbery trial, their attorney said late Monday. 
"There can be quarrels in the family, but that doesn't mean that Y9U run over to the other side," said Leonard W einglass in a tele­phone interview from his Los Angeles office. 

Weinglass said the Harrises, awaiting trial in Los Angeles, have been approached by the govern­ment with requests to testify at the trial. 
"But the Harrises are not in the business of sending anyone to jail," Weinglass said. 
The Harrises, who are scheduled for trial on kidnaping, robbery and assault charges, said last week they want a postponement until Miss Hearst, a codefendant, can be tried with them. 
They accused her of trying to "save her own skin" at their expense and said Miss Hearst was never forced to join the Symbionese Liberation Army. 
Weinglass said the Harrises plan to issue no further statements concerning Miss Hearst's testi­mony.

ACC, dorms big ND tour sites 
by Mike Kenahan Staff Reporter 
Boasting one of the most beaut­iful campuses in the country, Notre Dame has become quite a tourist attraction. 
Thousands of people flock onto the campus yearly. Most are here for athletic events; many are interested high school students and prospective Notre Dame freshmen and some are just plain sightseers. 
To handle the heavy task of giving these tourists an Irish welcome, the Admissions Office, under the coordination of Fr. David Tyson and Jossi Jeffries, has put together what some call the most effective tour operation in Notre Dame's history. 
Tyson attributes this year's success in tours to one thing ­organization. "This is the most organized year we've had so far," said Tyson, an admissions counsel· or and assistant rector at Dillon Hall. He pointed out that Jeffries does the actual organizing and makes the arrangements with the guides. 
The tours are given on a daily basis by a team of guides who are paid for their services. According to Tyson, this is another big difference"In the pa.st when a tour was needed, the receptionist would have to scrape someone up at the last minute. The way it is arranged today eliminates this problem," he said.

Second-half rally spurs Irish win 
by Bill Brink Sports Editor 
If Notre Dame thought they were adding a pushover when they selected St. Bonaventure as their extra game this season, they found out different last night. Spurred by Greg Sander's game­high 30 points, the Bonnies battled the Irish well into the second half before finally succumbing, 95-80, in front of the sellout crowd of 11,345 that filled the Notre Dame ACC last night. 
Irish superstar Adrian Dantley, who recovered from a cold first half to score 27 points, and freshman Bernard Rencher led ND as they pulled away from a determined Bonnie squad in the last fourteen minutes of the game. Rencher's 13 points broke his career-high, which he had achieved against Davidson just two days before. The Irish turned in another great team effort as five players scored in double figures. 
"I had a lot of respect for St. 

.. Bonaventure before the game," said ND coach Digger Phelps. "They're quick, they got some some good kids, and they never give up. We had to play very, very hard to win." Indeed, the Irish did have to struggle to keep ahead of St. Bonaventure, especially in the first half. With Dantley in the process of going 3 for 11 in the field, and with Greg Sanders hitting 9 of 12,

Notre Dame's constantly travel­ing yet consistently winning fenc­ing team moves to Detroit Saturday to tangle with both the University of Detroit and Chicago. The Irish swordsmen will be hoping to repeat their performances of last year against both as they defeated each handily. 
With their three victories this past weekend Notre Dame upped its season record to 13-0. They have now tied the longest winning streak in Notre Dame fencing history at 31, not paralleled since the 1967-68 seasons. If Coach Mike DeCicco's team can win its first match this Saturday, then it will be the sole owner of the win streak statistic. 
This past Saturday the Irish defeated Tri-State, 21-6, Wisconsin Parkside, 23-4 and rival Wayne State, 15-12. It was the second time this season that Tri-State and Wayne State have been beaten by Fourteen minutes into the game they had a 32-31 lead. Only Dave Batton, who was scoring from virtually everywhere, kept the Irish in command. 

Sanders, meanwhile, was deva­stating underneath, using his agil­ity and quickness to slip around the ND defenders. When Sanders wasn't hitting, fleet-footed guard Glenn Hagan was, popping from the outside to notch 10 first half points. Defensively, the Bonnies 2-3 zone collapsed all over Dantley and forced him to shoot under a lot of pressure. Batton and freshman Bruce Flowers took up the slack until A.D. picked up to score the last five points of the half and take a 44-36 lead at intermission. Dantley also took over first place in the most free throws made cate­gory when he sunk his fourth foul shot of the game with 5:20 to go in the half. 
The second half opened up with a fast pace and some torrid shooting. Flowers and Ray 'Dice' Martin hit two buckets apiece for ND and Sanders continued to be hot for St. Bonaventure. Bob Rozyzcko, the Bonnies' leading scorer for the season, began to come alive after scoring just four points in the first half. With 5:20 gone in the second half he hit his sixth point to bring the Bonnies within three, 56-53. But Dantley pulled the Irish away, hittting eight of their next ten points and Rencher came on to dazzle the crowd with a fancy offensive per-
Notre Dame. 
The sabre and foil teams compil­ed identical 22-5 records on the day while the epee team managed a 15-12 outcome. Mike Sullivan con­tinues to lead the sabre fencers as he took four bouts and lost his first of the season to last year's NCAA sabre champion, Yuri Rabinovich. Sullivan's teammate, Sam DiFiglio, also turned in an impressive per­formance as he captured five matches and lost only one, also to Rabinovich. In the foil weapon, sophomore Mike McCahey had a perfect day by winning all seven of his bouts, three versus Wisconsin­Parkside. 
Saturday's action in Detroit is slated to begin at 10 a.m. Notre Dame will travel again next week­end to Columbus, Ohio and will return home February 28 to fence against Wisconsin and Illinois. 
formance. When he hit two quick lay-ups to put ND up 78-64 Bonnie coach Jim Satalin called time out with 8:26 remaining. 
But Satalin's squad, though they never gave up, could not catch the Irish. Dantley hit five straight points, and Rencher sandwiched five more around buckets by Flow­ers and Bill Paterno, and the Irish had their largest lead of the ballgame, 92-71, with 3:06 left in the game. The reserves came on to finish the game by the final fifteen-point margin. 
"We were ready for the zone," said Phelps, "but the problem was they switched to their secondary defense, the man-to-man, and we couldn't execute well enough. Plus we missed alot of shots, which we seem to be doing with alot of consistency here lately. But we just tried to keep up our 28 foot defense and play consistenly and aggressively. We didn't do any­thing different, we just played better in the second half." 
The Irish, by virture of their 22 of 31 field shooting in the second half, upped their percentage to .555 for the game. Dantley hit 5 of 7 after intermission to finish with 8 of 19 for the night. He made 11 of 17 from the foul line. Flowers, Batton and Martin helped the percentage by hitting 7 of 8, 7 of 9 and 5 of 6 respectively. Batton finished with 15 points, second to Dantley, while Flowers had 14 and Martin 10. Bill Paterno added eight more points and Duck Williams six. Toby Knight led the Irish in rebounds with ten, followed by Flowers' nine caroms. 
For St. Bonaventure, Sanders' total of thirty points was followed by Hagan's 16 markers. Bonnie center Essie Hollis added thirteen and Rozyzcko had twelve. Reserve
