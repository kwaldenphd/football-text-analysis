Sharing my sister's identity 
"Yes, she looks like me. NO-she is not my twin-she is my YOUNGER sister," I have to constantly tell people when Sarah and I are together. 
I was blessed, (only now that I am not living in the house any longer do I think of it that way), with Nellie Williams three younger sisters and one brother. Sarah is the closest to me in age. Saint Mary's 
This past weekend was Photo Editor the first time she has been able to come to campus to visit me. After seventeen years of sharing a room with her, secrets every night with her, a year of sharing a car with her, and millions of minutes spent fighting with her, I actually miss her at college (or maybe it's just her clothes). Either way, I was excited for her to visit me and to be able to share my life here with her (not to mention, take her to some parties). 
My mom called the night my sister arrived with some last minute advice, worried to think of what two of her daughters could do together. 
"Remember, the money I sent with Sarah is not to buy beer," my mom said as I rolled my eyes at my grinning sister. We had a whole weekend ahead of us. 
But by Friday night, my nerves were already worn with my sister. She had come ready to shop. We had spent the whole day at the mall, she had already called her boyfriend twice, and it was getting harder to convince her to let me borrow her clothes. After shopping all day again on Saturday in Chicago, (we had to find the perfect prom dress for Sarah). I was exhausted. Especially at the thought of all my studying and home­work I still had to get done. 
It's stressful bringing someone from "out­side" of campus into your life on campus. College life is already so incredibly busy and you just want that other person to fit perfect­ly into your daily routine of classes and friendships and to love your college as much as you do. Although l don't exactly know how I would feel if Sarah came to college here, I at least wanted her to want to come here. I wanted her to think I was a "cool" big sister and wish to be like me. 
During one of our "arguments," (you couldn't expect us to go a whole weekend without one, could you?) I discovered how much Sarah hates being compared to me. I never thought it was such a big deal until she mentioned it this weekend. She complained of how she always felt she was being measured up to me. It's funny because we're not even alike. That's one of the reasons I like her, because she's not like me. Do you remember when you were younger how you always had to say to other kids. "Stop copying me?" We didn't want anyone else to steal our ideas then. Those ideas helped mold us into the young adults we are today. We don't want to lose our identity. 
As we grow older (and more tolerant of each other) my respect for my little sister grows. She is not only my sister. but also my confidant, and always has a new wardrobe for me to wear.

Mich. St. preparation prevents riot 
EAST LANSING, Mich. 

More than 600 people filled the streets near Cedar Village Apartments Saturday night, celebrating Michigan State University's win over Iowa State in the NCAA Basketball Tournament. But the scene of chant­ing partiers was very different from a year ago, when nearly 10,000 people stormed East Lansing's streets on March 27 and 28. "Both the university and the city made a real conscious effort to educate the community that type of behavior is scary," East Lansing Mayor Pro Tern Beth Schwarze said. "With the winds [Saturday). Cedar Village could have burned down." The March 27-28, 1999, riot resulted in 132 arrests, including 71 of MSU students. That massive enforce­ment -mixed with university and community efforts -may have played a large role in deterring people from rioting Saturday. Prosecutors sported a remark­able 86 percent conviction rate, sentencing 113 people for 55 felonies and 58 misdemeanors. "I think all of those things have provided a wake-up call," MSU spokesman Terry Denbow said. "We owe a lot of cred­it to our students and credit to our university commu-

Yale orders Versity.com to pull notes from Web 
PRINCETON, N.J. 

A recent controversy at Yale University has brought Versity.com, an Internet company that provides lecture notes for courses at about 150 colleges and universities nation­wide, to the forefront of a continuing debate over professors' intellectual property rights. 
Versity.com pays students for their lecture notes and then makes the notes available online. At most schools, however, the company docs not seek the permission of profes­sors from whose courses material is posted. 
Versity.com pulled all notes from c9urses at Yale last month, several days after the university demanded that it do so. 
"Yale sent Versity.com a cease and desist order objecting to what they were doing," according to a state-

ment by Yale assistant director for institutional issues Thomas Violante. "They complied and took down the Yale notes. We said we will meet with them at a later date." 
Versity.com manager of campus relations Jennifer Keesler explained the company's reason for pulling the material from the site. "We removed the notes because we respect the students, faculty and administration 
Compiled from U-Wire reports 
at Yale," she said. "Beyond that, we hope this leads to us learning more about their needs." 
Though the Website allows users to get notes for about 7,000 classes, it does not offer notes from any Princeton courses. 
According to Keesler, the company does not play a role on the Princeton campus because of a lack of student interest. Versity.com did not receive the "overwhelming student demand for notes" from Princeton under­graduates that it had from students at other schools, she said. 
Dean of unde·rgraduate students Kathleen Deignan said she believes this lack of demand is the result of specific university regulations that preclude the sale of lecture notes. "The university has a policy that long predated Versity.com," she said. 
Ohio court defends college records 
COLUMBUS. Ohio 
A recent federal court decision added another twist to the manner in which Ohio State and Miami (Ohio) Universities must handle students' disciplinary records. The federal district court ruled that the records arc protected from public release under the Family Educational Hights and Privacy Act (FERPA) or the Buckley Amendment. According to the decision, OSU and Miami University have been violating FERPA by releasing student disciplinary records, along with per­sonally identifiable information to a national newspa­per, The Chronicle of Higher Education. The act defines education records arc defined as follows: "Those records, files, and documents and other materials that contain information directly related to a student; and are maintained by an educational agency or by a per­son acting for such an agency." Despite what is said in FERPA, opponents believe it is in the best interest of the public to have access to this information. According to 
S. Daniel Carter, vice president of Security on Campus, lnc.. "The Department of Education is just stopping the schools from doing something they didn't want to do."

Verret,  a  French  and  

communications major and member of the Notre Dame Marching Band, began vol­u n tec ring at Logan last fall. Initially. she was unsure of her ability to help center clients. 
"When I went out after the first time I visited [Logan Center} and got the tour. I want to run out and cry in my car," Verret said. "I didn't know if I'd be able to handle it. It's kind of a shock, and humbling, so many people in one place who have a disability." 
In addition to Best Buddies, Verret volunteers weekly in an adult rehabil­itation program, helping to feed and entertain adults, many of who are restricted to wheelchairs and cannot speak. She plans to contin­ue service work and might partici pate after grad ua­t ion in the L'arche pro­gram, in which volunteers live in community with mentally disabled adults.

Reno defends her actions during Waco confrontation

WASHINGTON 

Attorney General Janet Reno testified Tuesday that she never gave approvaJ for tanks to demolish the Branch Davidians' compound near \Vaco, Texas and does not believe the FBI intentional­ly did so ­say lawyers for the sect w h o deposed her for their wrongful-death la,vsuit against the government. 
But tlrn Davidians' lead coun­sel. emerging from the rare deposition of an attorney gener­al, said Reno was less than forthcoming in discussing whether the FBI intended to dis­mantle the complex during its 
tear-gassing operation  - an  
interpretation  rejected  by  
Beno's aides.  

"The only issue where we felt that she was less than candid was on the demolition," Houston lawyer Michael Caddell said out­side the Justice Department. "The problem that she's got is she testified to Congress

others from gunshot wounds. 
The governn:ient insists they

A day later, Reno went on 

television to accept responsibili­
ty -an act that earned her 
widespread acdaim. 
Although congressional hear­ings that year on Waco were ovenvhelmingly supportive of' Heno, her decision to use tear gas was sharply questioned dur­ing hearings in 1995, th11 first year the Republicans controlled Congress. 
And then the issuP faded -largely from view until last August, ·when the government was forced to acknowledge that the FBI had used potentially incendiary tear gas canisters despite Heno's orders to the con­trary. 
Reno acknowledged Tuesday that the operations plan she approved did not authorize the use of pyrotechnic tear gas, flash-bang devices inside the Davidians' Mount Carmel retreat, or building demolition, Cadden said. 
"She also testified she was

Attorney Michael 
Bradford of Texas, one of five Justice lawyers who flanked Reno at the two-hour deposi­tion, disputed Caddell's claim. "We would strongly disagree with his interpretation," he said. 
"She was forthcoming and candid and answered all the questions. lier testimony will speak for itself, but it was con­sistent throughout the deposi­tion with her past testimony," said Bradford, who is one of the government's chief defenders in thn Davidian litigation. 
For Heno, Waco has bem1 a rrnver-cnding crisis. 
The deadly standoff betwem1 tlrn Branch Davidians and foder­al law (Jnf'orcement bc~gan in February 1993 -just W(JC ks before Hcno took ol'licc -,-vith a shootout as Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents tried to serve weapons warrants on Davidian leader David Koresh. Four agents and six Davidians diPCI. 
That was followed by a 51-day 
ordered the 

dismantling of' the Davidians' complex several hours into the operation -in defiance of the Heno-approved p Ian that permitted such destruction only after 48 hours if the tear-gassing proved unsuccessful. 
While Reno refused to acknowledge deliberate demoli­tion occurred, Caddell said she did concede that the on-scene commanders would have been required to consult with FBI leadership in Washington before speeding up the plan -which didn't occur. 
Bradford declined to discuss Heno's testimony, saying the foderal district judge presiding over the case ordered deposi­tions scaled for 30 days. 
"The judge has expressed a fairly strong preference that we not get inlo a public debate over depositions, so I do not want to go point-by-point through the deposition," he said. 
Caddell said he will rnhiasP both lfono's deposition and a videotape of the proceeding in 30 days. 
The attorney said he does not hold Reno responsible for any negligence at Waco. 
But he is using his depositions with Reno and other high-rank­ing FBI officials to buttress his contention that the FBl's on­scene commanders -special agent in charge Jeffrey Jamar and Hostage Rescue Team leader Richard Hogers -deviat­ed from the approved operations plan by escalating the tear-gas insertion and destroying the building. 
He also faults Jamar's decision to hold back fire trucks at a checkpoint while the building was consumed by flames. 
Jamar told Congress in 1995 
that he kept the fire trucks at bay for fear firefighters might be shot. The government contends any actions Jamar or Rogers took that day fell within their discretionary authority. 
Also Tuesday, a federal judge in Waco granted a plaintiffs' request to dismiss their part of a case against an FBI sharpshoot­er.

President enters Southern flag debate

With a visit to a historically black South Carolina college, President Clinton is wading into the debate over display of t h e

T h e symbol­ism will be potent and the political undertones strong Wednesday as Clinton appears at a $500-per-person fund-raiser honoring Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. 
Along with many other blacks in South Carolina, Clyburn wants the flag removed from atop the South Carolina Statehouse. 
Clyburn said he wanted Wednesday's event held at Allen University to make a statement, evm though

"I want to make a statement about that flag every chance I ·get," Clyburn said recently. 
By his presencn at the school, founded in 1870 by the African Methodist Eph;copal Church, Clinton will ally himself with the move­ment to remove the flag as a symbol of racism. said Bruce Ransom, a political science professor at South Carolina's Clemson University.

talking about the flag. and he's there with Clyburn," Ransom said. "As far as sym­bolism, there's a bundle all together there." 
Supporters say the flag, which has flown atop the Statehouse since 1962, hon­ors those who died in the Civil War. 
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is leading a tourism boycott of South 
Carolina until  the  flag  is  
removed.  
This  week,  the  NAACP  

offered some support for a compromise proposed by state legislators on both sides of the flag issue. The plan would remove the flag from the Statehouse dome but erect other Civil War-era flags on the Capitol grounds. 
"The president will talk about the flag and he will talk more broadly about toler­ance," White House spokesman Jake Siewert said Tuesday. 
Clinton will likely expand on rhetoric he used this month at a commemoration of the civil rights march in Selma, Ala. 
"As long as the wav­

And in a state likely to vote Hepublican in the fall, Clinton will point to the political con­troversy over the flag in this year's pivotal South Carolina GOP primary. 
Presumptive Republican presidential nominee George Bush demurred on the ques­tion of whether the flag belongs at the Statehouse, calling it a local issue. 
Bush's former GOP chal­lenger. John McCain, also refused to take a position.

Netanyahu denies
U.S. under human rights accusations 
Assocjated Press 
BEIJING 

Ahead of a visit by President Clinton's scrurity advisfH, China accusnd \t\'ashington today of demonstrating a dou­ble standard by seeking U.N. censure of Beijing dospite having its own "very serious human rights problem." 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi's com­ments came just hours before National Security Adviser Sandy Hergcr was due in Beijing for talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu Hongji and thPir foreign policy team. 
Berger is one of the most senior Clinton administration officials to visit since U.S.­China ties plummflted after NATO bombed the Chinesc Embassy in Yugoslavia during tlrn fighting over Kosovo 10 1/2 months ago. 
Berger, who accompanicd Clinton to South Asia last week, is expected to discuss shared U.S. and Chinese con­cerns over Pakistan and India·s nuclear programs. !In also will likdy raisP human rights concflrns and reiterate appeals for Chinese restraint following Taiwan's presiden­tial election 10 days ago. 
Chin a is fighting a U.S. effort at the current meeting of thn U.N. Jluman Hights Commission in Geneva to cen­sure Beijing for what Washington says is a worsen­ing Chinese rights record. 
Sun, the Chinese spokesman, predicted the U.S. effort would fail, as similar . attempts have in previous vears. IIP said tlw U.N. com­inission should not be a forum 
for political confrontation and Beijing opened what both

he said. 
Police said that a seven­
month investigation indicated 
that Netanyahu should be 
charged with fraud, attempted

of trust and obstruction of' jus­
tice . 
His lawyer, Yaacov 
Weinroth, called the police 
report "sloppy." He said it 
"confirms what we thought ­
the case is one big nothing." 
The attorney general, 
Elyakim Rubinstein, will make 
the final decision on whether 
to indict. It was unclear how 
long that process might take. 

Arguing his case, Netanyahu said police interrogated him as to whether a small, valuable -pendant was among the state gifts. When he got home from that particular interrogation session, he said he and his wife "turned the house upside 
down" and found the pendant. 
They took it to an appraiser, 
and were told it is worth less 
than a dollar, Netanyahu said, 
waving the tiny pin before the 
TV cameras. 
Asked what the most difficult 
moment was since the probe 
began, Netanyahu stopped and 
looked down. After long sec­
onds of silence, he said his 8­
year-old son Yair was torment­
ed at school because of the 
probe and his mother, Cila, 
died with the charges still 
hanging over him.

Births to unwed mothers hit high 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

Women in their 20s helped fuel a baby boomlet that pushed U.S. births up 2 per­cent in 1998. the first increase in several years, said a govern­ment report released Tuesday. 
The increase reflected 
growth in the number of 
women entering childbearing

1998 and accounted for nearly half of all babies born that year, reported the National Center for Health Statistics. But unlike the 1990s, when teenagers were having children at alarming rates. today's unwed mothers are more likely to be in their 20s and 30s. 
Hesearclwrs attribute the change to a big drop in teen births, confidence in the boom­ing economy and more relaxed attitudes about unwed moth­ers. 
"The social disapproval fac­tor has definitely lessened," said Stephani<' Ventura, lead author of the report compiled from stat<' birth data. 
There were 3.94 million births in 1998, compared to 
3.88 million children born in 1997. The fertility rate, a mea­sure of births among women of 
child bearing agf~. was 65.6 percent to 87.4 births per births for every 1,000 females, 1,000 women -the highest up from 65 births per 1,000. rate since 1965.

Some 1.29 million babies were born to single women in 1998, up 3 percent from the prior year and the highest number reported since the government started collecting birth data in the early 1900s. 
One reason for the rise was a larger population of unmarried women of child bearing age. The number of single women between 15 and 44 rose to 
29.2 milJion women in 1998 from 28.6 million in 1997. 
Unwed women in their 20s and 30s had higher birth rates. and that was true for both white and black women. Birth rates for unwed Hispanic women in that age group fell, the report showed. 
Birth rates for all women in the 20s and 30s was also on tlrn rise. After falling during the 1990s, the birth rate for women between 20 and 24 ­the principal childbearing ages -rose 1 percent to 111.2 births per 1,000. The rate for wnmen aged 30 to 34 rose 2

"Non-married does not nec­essari Iy mean that it's the mother alone without a father," said Darroch, citing a government study that showed about 4 percent of women, or about 2.6 million, living with partners. 
Donna Shalala, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the trend was cause for concern. 
"The increase in births to unmarried mothers, as well as the increase in teen mothers who smoke, are troubling," said Shalala. 
Other findings:

Smoking among pregnant teens increased, especially among blacks. 

. 
The proportion of women beginning prenatal care in the first trimester continued to rise 


an encouraging sign because early care can increase the chances of having a healthy baby. 
. Multiple births continued to increase, a phenomenon tied to the use of fertility drugs.

Scientists develop healthier soy oil 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON 
Government scientists have developed a new soy­bean that's healthier for the heart because the oil need not go through a process that produces artery-clog­ging trans fatty acids and it has less than half the satu­rated fat of conventional soybeans. 
Food manufacturers ­who use soybean oil in everything from margarine to crackers -are eager to get the healthier oil because of Food and Drug Administration plans to 
require the listing of trans fats on food nutri­tion labels. 
Consumers won't see the new product before next year at the earliest, however, because the first com­mercial crop being plant­
ed  next  
month  in  
N  o  r  t  h  

Carolina will 

be saved for seed and test­ing. 
The new soybean holds "excellent potential" for food makers and "will pro­vide the needed flexibility to be used in a wide variety of products," the Institute of Shortening and Edible Oils said in a recent letter to the United Soybean Board, a producer group that helped fund the USDA research. The institute represents companies that process veg­etable oils. 
"Just by changing the kind of oil that's used by food manufacturers and restau­rants would go a long way to reducing heart disease in this country," Margo Wootan, director of nutri­tional policy for the Center 
for Science in the Public Interest, said Tuesday. 
The new soybean was developed by Agriculture Department scientists in Raleigh, N.C., using conven­tional breeding methods, not the genetic engineering that has become controver­sial in Europe and Asia. 
More than 80 percent of the vegetable oil used in cooking and food manufac­turing comes from soybeans because of its relatively low price and wide availability. 
But soybean oil cannot be used for cooking unless it is hydrogenated to extend its shelf life and improve its flavor. Hydrogenation, 

"Just by changing the kind ofoil that's used by food manufacturers and restaurants would go a long way in reducing heart disease in this country. ,, 
Margo Wootan director of nutritional policy, Center for Science in the Public Interest 
w hi Ch a I s o solidifies the oil, removes linolenic acid that causes the oil to t a s t e rancid w h e n heated. The new soybeans have a third as m u c h linolenic acid as 
conventional varieties. 
Hydrogenated oil would still be needed for some products, such as baked goods, to give them the proper texture and body, but manufacturers could blend in oil that isn't hydro­genated to lower the overall content of trans fat, accord­ing to industry experts. 
Health experts say trans fatty acids may be even worse for the heart than saturated fat. Studies indi­cate that eating trans fat increases LDL-cholesterol, often called "bad choles­terol," which increases the risk of heart diseasn. At tlrn same time, it reduces levels of HDL, the "good choles­terol" that is good for the heart.

Forgive others as Jesus forgave us 
In a recent bible study group, we dis­cussed the story of "The Lost Son," also known as "The Prodigal Son." This is the parable in the gospel of Luke that details the life of a young man who squandered his inheritance on prostitutes and other frivolous things. Upon his return home, with nothing left, his father wekomed him back with open arms. He forgavP his youngest son without condition or hesitation. 
Although I had heard this parable many times. it wasn't until recent­ly that I thought about what it had to do with me. \\'hat does it mean for all of us today? Even though it was written cPnturies ago, its purpose is timeless. 
It is human nature to reh~asc emo­tions when something has affected us deeply. \iVhether we arc moved to tears ofjoy or sorrow. our minds seldom for­get that initial feeling of what moved us in the first place. This is applicable to our relationships with others. The majority of us function in a world where we build relationships on trust. 
The rnlationship we have with our parents is also based on trust. From birth, we were taught that with unac­ceptable behavior, certain conse­quenc:es result. It may take a lot of beg­ging, ,vashing dishes. sorting laundry and other tasks to "get back in good graces." Time heals all wounds, right? If this is human nature. then why did Jesus find it necessary to tell us the story of a father who forgave so Pasily? 
Take~ dose friends for example. Heal friPndships develop over time. A dose friend has hurt us at some point in our lives. Many of us have been hurt by the same friend manv times. Sometimes we forgive, sometimes we do not. Rarely do we forget. If the friend were truly sorry for their actions, and wanted to re­enter into a loving relationship, is it the Christian thing to make .that road back as difficult as possible? ls it the Christian thing to extend our arms without condition or hesitation? Should we strive to be like that forgiving father? 

This same parable mentions the eldest son as one who dedicated his lif'e to serving his father. He too was a recipient of his father's wealth. Instead of spending all of his money, like his brother, he continued to serve his father and never disobeyed him. Upon hearing the news that his father was rejoicing because of the younger broth­er's return. the eldest brother grew angry and critical. 
Often we want credit t'or things that we should be doing in the first place. \Ve often want to be rewarded for deeds that are respectful and "morally right... Along with this desire to be rec­ognized romes a criticism of those who stray f'rom the path that is accepted. We question. like the brother, reward­ing people whom we think should not be rewarded. Is criticizing and judging others based on our standards the morally right thing to do? 
Perhaps the answer lies in treating people with that golden rule we learned in the first grade: 'Treat others the way you want to be treated.' Perhaps we should view ea.ch other's sins as equal. One person's sin should not be viewed as bigger then our own. In th,~ fmd, God judges us all and does not discriminate. I do not believe that IJr, is selective in determining sin. I do not believe there is some big contest at the end of tlrn world railed "\Vho's the biggest sinner." 
Perhaps this is why Jesus died for all of us. Perhaps this is why it is so easy for the Lord to forgive us. \Ve all make mistakes, yet He always welcomes us back with open arms and no questions asked -withbut condition or hesita­tion. 
I certainly understand the difficulty in forgiving those who may have hurt us deeply. I struggle with the question of "well. they did it once, they'll probably do it again." It is hard to release pain. It is hard to forgive peopln we sometimes think should not be forgiven. But who are we to judge? 
Easter is certainly not that far away. This is the time that we should rd1ect on our own actions as well as the actions of others. Perhaps it is within our human natun~ to forgive others as Jesus forgave us. 
When you feel as though someone has betrayed you. it feels like disregarding that person is the easiest thing to do. You may not speak anymore; you may not even sec each other anymore. How easy it is to sweep something, or sonw­one. under the carpet. But, they are still there. That foeling insidP of you, that voice from within, that might be some­one asking for forgiveness. \Vhcn you keep so much hate and ang('r bottled up inside of you. it can literally feel like it is eating you alivc-1. 
Forgiveness is not just for the person who wants to be forgiven. It is also for the person ,,vho forgives. \-Vhichtwf~r pArson we may be, we arc all equal in spite of our faults. We are all judged and we arc all forgiven. without condi­tion or hesitation. PArhaps now is the time to extend this same grace to tl10s<' around us. Perhaps they may ne,~d it. 
Perhaps we do too.

Bridging the gap between· people 
I realized how important the challenge is for us to "bridge the gap between people." It is often easier to talk about the importance of "relationships" and quickly become caught up in many responsibilities in "our own cirdes." It is often easier to think and Father preach about "my Don McNeil! neighbor" than to be open to encounters 
For a More

and fears. 
Morn than three 
decades ago. Notre Dame invited a priest 
psychologist from Ilolland named Henri 
Nouwrn to tl~ach in the Psychology 
Departnwnt. Ih~nri challenged me and many 
of' my Holy Cross colleagues and hundreds 
or stud(rnl"i to move beyond foar and self­
preoccupation toward love and experiential 
learning to discover the complexities of 
responding to the needs of "our neighbors." 
I think that the reflections of Henri in the last book he wrote before his sudden death in 1996 might m,sist us in this communitv to rnl1ect on our response to Jubilee Debt  Helief and many other issues facing Notre Damr now and in the years ahead. Please mad slowlv three reflections he shared in his book "i3read for the Journey: J\ Day Book for \Visdom and Faith." This is one of' morn than 40 books of Henri in the area of spirituality which have now been published and continue to be translated and published, especially in the Spanish-speaking world at this time. 
I lundn~ds of thousands ofChristians arc following meditations in a booklet "From the l lousP of Fear to thP Ilouse of Love" and taken from his book and lecturos on "The Heturn of thn Prodigal Son" during this Lent. These passages have helped me put the challenge of our response to Jubilee Debt Hnlief and othm· social concerns in perspt~c­tivo. 
Crossing the Hoad for One Another: "We become neighbors when we are willing to cross the road for one another. Them is so much separation and segregation: between black people and white people. between gay people and straight people. bfitween young people and old prn,ple, bf'tween skk people and healthy pcopln. between prisoners and free p1~oph~. bPtwe<'n Jews and Gentiles. Muslims and Christians. Protestants and Catholics, Greek Catholics and Latin Catholics. 
There is a lot of road crossing to do. We arc all very busy in our own circles. We have our own people to go to and our own affairs to take care of. But if we could cross the road once in a while and pay attention to what is happ,,ning on the other side, we might indeed become neighbors." 
Bridging the Gap Betwefm Prople: "To bl'come neighbors is to bridge the gap between people. As long as then~ is distance bPtwrcn us and we cannot look into one another's Pyes, all sorts of false ideas and images arise. We give them names. make jokes about tlrnm. cover them with our prej­udices. and avoid direct contact. We think of them as enemies. We forget that they love as we love. rare for their children as we earn !'or ours. beconrn sick and die as W<' do. We forget that they are our brothers and sisters and treat them as objecl"i that can be destroyed at will. 
Only whPn W(\ hav<' thP courage to cross thP road and look in one another's eyes can we see there that we arc children of the 
same God and members of the same human 
family." 

The speakers coming from other countries 
for this week would not have been possible 
without Father Tom McDermott, who hosted 
a group of Notre Dame faculty and staff in 
Uganda and Kenya this pa.<;t June. The 
group realized how important it would be to 
invite speakers to "cross the road to ND" 
from various settings impacted by incredible 
debt which is hampering the poor. 
Tom is a Holy Cross priest who, for me, has been a witness to the above words and spirit of Ilenri Nouwen while he was here on campus for six years working with Campus Ministry and "bridging the gap" between the people off-campus and entities like the Center for Social Concerns. His spirit, his way of loving each individual person and ability to enter into the joys and sorrows of life have been a gift to this campus. We cele­brate his return for this challenging week focusing on debt relief and our call for glob­al solidarity and response. Upon return to Africa, we hope Tom will continue "bridging the gap" by facilitating an international summer service project in Uganda for African-American Notre Dame studenli; in 2001. 
\\!hat about "crossing the road for one another" in our local Notre Dame-South Bend relationships? I am grateful that this year that there is renewed energy and vision thanks to Lou Nanni as Executive Assistant to Monk, to explore "bridging the gap" between the University and neighborhoods in South Bend, especially in the Northeast Neighborhood and the West Side. 
I have watched studenl"i in our seminar on Christian leadership listen to neighbors express their concerns and needs. We at the CSC are exploring the challenge for improved relationships for most studenli, and residents in the Northeast Neighborhood with revitalized vision and passion for shared and collaborative leader­ship. These are great signs of hope for the future. 
I condude with an expression ofgratitude for the words and deeds of Pope John Paul II in his recent trip to the Holy Land. During his time the Pope has dearly lived out the spirit of these passages from Henri Nouwen. I lis gesture at the Wailing Wall in asking forgiveness from the Jewish community for the centuries ofChristian sins of commission and omission which have caused great pain and need reconciliation. It was a gesture in a moment of silence and deep prayer. May we follow his example in praying and then acting in response to the challenges related to debt relief which can impact the lives of millions of people if we all work together in "bridging the gap" creatively. 
Don A4cNeill. CSC, is lhe founder and exec­utive director ofthe Center for Social Concerns. The Center for 5,ocial Concerns column runs every other ~Vednesday. 
lie asks that anyone interested in follow­ing up what they have learned and respond­ed to this week on debt relief or exploring creative ways lo develop relationships and programs with the South Bend residents in the Northeast Neighborhood contact the Center for Social Concerns at ND.ndcn­trsc. l@nd.edu.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Donate bone marrow today and save lives 
As you may or may not know, I have been diagnosed with leukemia. For those of you who have been so gracious to write or say prayers, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Those letters get me through everyday. 
The doctors don't think I have the best of odds. The doctors can go to BC for all I'm concerned. So, I write one telling you that, hate it or love it, I WILL be among you next year. 
Secondly, I write about the upcoming bone marrow drive. Please go. I know I probably wouldn't, I would be hanging out or doing a well overdue paper or just napping or who knows what. Maybe I would want to and I'd forget, giving it a shrug at the salad bar at NDH that night. 
Please don't do that. They say blood is the gift of life. It is true. I have received many need blood transfusions since I've been here. Bone marrow is the gift of a LIFETIME. One is NOT guaranteed a bone marrow match. If you don't get one. most likely, you die. If you do, you have a chance to live. 
It will be quick and easy to get tested, and if you were ever one day selected it would be equally pain free. And someone's daughter, wife, sister or mother would live. 
Please go. 

I see a lot of people everyday whose lives are depending on it.

Vote for resolution on IBM pensions 
I am writing to respectfully ask that all faculty, staff, students and alumni who hold stock in the IBM corporation carefully consider the IBM stock­holder proxy votes you make in the coming days leading to the annual stockholder's meeting on April 25. 
In the case of the IBM employees' resolution on retirement and retire­ment medical, I am asking that you vote all IBM stock held in favor of the resolution. 
The entire text of the resolution can be found in the recent annual meet­ing notice which also outlines the board of director's election and other business to be held at the annual meeting. In summary. IBM decided to change the pension plan from the long-held traditional plan to a cash bal­ance plan. 
The net result to tens of thousands of IBMers was a drastic 30 to 50 per­cent cut in retirement benefits. The public outcry and resultant Senate hearings forced IBM to restore some benefits to a subset of employees in the hopes of quelling the criticism. However, IBM chose to use age as a cri­teria for determining who received and who did not receive benefits under · the old plan. That age is 40. 
Hundreds of Notre Dame alumni who graduated after 1981 are still severely affected by this change. For example, I started in 1983 and was fully vested in IBM's retirement plan in 1988. In mid-1999 I was removed from the old plan and placed into the cash balance plan for the simple rea­son that I was not quite 40 years-old. The personal cost to me was an approximate 40 percent loss in pension value. If I had been one year older and worked seven fewer years at IBM, I would have received my full pen­sion. 
This raiding of the pension plan was done at a time of record IBM earn­ings. In the early 1990s, when IBM still held respect for the individual high, the IBM pension fund was left untouched despite the fact the companv was losing billions of dollars. · 
My story is not at all unusual. and in fact it is rather average.· I sincerely hope that a Catholic university that prides itself on teaching Christian and moral values to il;; students and the community at large will carefully con­sider its vote on this issue and cast a vote in favor of' the stockholder resolu­tion.

Out of the garbage and into the history books 
I had sonw Garbagr Pail Kids when I was younger. People ah\'ays act surprised when Garbage Pail Kids come up in con­vrrsation. but seriously. nOJH' of us will rver f'orgf't ... Scotty Potty. /\dam Bomb. Corrodr.d Carl and Junkf'ood John -just to nam{' a few. Some otlH'r fun names of Garbage Pail Kids 

are Dirty Ilarry. Hob Slob, Varicosr \\'avne, Fake Jake. Shrunktn Ed and Clu;rkv Charles. 
The Garbage Pail Phenonunon was pret­ty amazing. Four mf'n started it and thf'n got Topps Cards to carry thr first series. Art Spit>gt>lman \\'as one of tho four. He also wrotr the Pulitzer PrizP winning Maus 
II. For those of' vou who don't know, ~1aus II is a cartoon about the holocaust !which Art's fathPr ,.,·as a survivor of) in which Jpwish pPople arf' depicted as mice and Nazis are depicted as cats. It is often hard­bound, so we are talking serious comic-book action. 
Another crPator of Garbage Pail Kids was Mark Newgarden. I couldn't dig up 
Scott Little 
just a little 

anything on this guy, but he was involved in the comic busi­ness as well. ThP third creator was John Pound. This guy. as well. was a comic book artist. Ile did most of the illustrations. llis artwork is renowned in the comic book world. He also rer,ently canw up with a set of trading cards railed "Meanie BabiPs." And the fourth creator is Jay Lynch who wrote for \1ad magazine. Bazooka Joe comics. did illustrations for the Chicago Sun and worked on some underground comic books. 
If you'll remember, bark in the '80s, a popul-ar toy for girls to have was the Cabbage Patch Kid. ThPse big-headed. dim­pled, orphan children didn't offer boys very much. They had birth certificates to fill out and cute names. It was really way too much responsibility. Boys had little they could do. \Ve could pretend that the Cabbage Patch Kids didn't exist by immersing ourselves in He-Man or GI Joe. But it is hard to do wh<'n your neighbors won't stop riding around on their new Cabbage Patch Big \Vheel. and every commercial break during afternoon cartoons boasts of the latest Cabbage Patch Kid. They wPre always coming out with new ideas: Oriental Cabbage Patrh Kid, Black Cabbage Patch Kid, Tcrnthing Cabbage Patch Kid and First day at school Cabbage Patch Kid. Thf' only real ans\.ver to this invasion of girl culture was a direct attack. 
And thus, the Garbage Pail Kid was a knight in shining armor. I don't mean to make it sound like it was only for boys. There were many noble girls fighting for the cause as well. But it was kind of known that the Cabbage Patch was girl ter­ritory and if you were in it -and a guy -you wouldn't be considered a boy for very long. 
The first series of Garbage Pail Kids cards came in 1985. There were 15 series total. All in all there were 620 cards, but each card had a twin. A twin was the exact same card with a different name on the bottom. For example, Up Chuck and Heavin' Strven. and Boozin' Bruce and 0runk Ken. So all in all. there werf' actually 1,240 Garbage Pail Cards to collect ­plus at least one was a triple. There were also different, big­ger collectibles. too. The very, very first card -card one, series one -was Nasty Nick. and his twin Evil Ed. 
Garbage Pail Kids can still be found today. They can be bought and sold on the Internet. The most expensive price you'll encounter is $225 for the box set of series one. The prices of individual cards are actually quite reasonable though. Maybe someday we'll have a Garbage Pail Kids of Notre Dame. \Ve could even create some of our own. Like Patty 0'Splatty, or Father Plutoni Torn, Tony Screw Driver or Father Edward Sore in the Face. 
The Garbage Pail Kid Phenomenon was rather short-lived, thanks to worried moms. Moms hated Garbage Pail Kids. They were repulsive and often depicted things that couldn't be mentioned at thP dinner table. There was going to be a Garbage Pail Kids cartoon in 1988 on CBS Saturday mornings, but it never aired because so many concerned mothers called in. 
The legacy did move on though. Garbage Pail Kids went international. In France they were called "The Trash Can Kids" and in Australia th(~Y were called "Thi~ Garbage Pail Gang." They were almost all bootleg cards. There have even brPn sightings of GPKs in Israel. In a sense, they will live on forever. and like most great ideas. their sprc~ad can't ever be stopped. \Ve can only hope that future generations will be cre­ative enough to solve social problems using methods similar to those of the Garbage Pail Kids. . 
PS: Sorry there are no pictures of GPKs here. I would have gladly put some here if they let me.

Renowned composer g 

By KATIE McVOY Scene Wrirer 

If you watched all of the Aca.demy Awards Sunday night, you might know that composer John Corigliano's score for "The Hed Violin" won thf' Oscar for Best Original Score. Corigliano vvas one of several com­posers mrntioned in a discussion about composers who cross over tlw line between writing music for film and concPrt compos­ing. 
Dr. Michael Schelle. a professor at Butler University. gave a lecture entitled. "The Gold Chain around the Hairy Chest of Hollywood," on Monday in the Little Theatre at Saint Mary's College. 
One may wonder why anyone would attend a lecture with that title, or why. for 
that matter, anyone would  use  that  as  a  
title.  
Schelle said. "Many directors feel  that  

the musi<:al score of the film is the gold chain around an otherwise hairy opera­tion." He found the metaphiJr while researching his recent book "The Score." 
Music in Hollywood films has changed a lot since the advent of sound in pictures. Early in the 1930s. Hollywood composers worked with existing compositions and fit­ted them for the films they were working on. The original "Dracula." starring Bela Lugosi, has a score that would sound very familiar to anyone who is part of the ballet world. "Dracula" and the ballet "Swan Lake" claim the same score. 
In the middle years of Hollywood. the 1940s and 1950s, many composers kept one foot in the concert composition busi­ness while keeping the other foot in film composing. 
Today, however. there is very little cross over remaining. Most composers focus either on film or concert music and only dabble in the other field occasionally. For example, Corigliano is a concPrt composer who has only written scores for three movies. 
On the other side of composing. Thomas Newman. who has written the scores for "Arne ·,,. t>><,0a t " "The Gree M·te"1 an
,r1,,an u y. , .,n , d "The Shawshank Redemption," recently wrote a piece for the world famous Cleveland Orchestra. 
Schelle attributes the greater isolation partly to differences in the two versions of the industry: "Hollywood composers are used to having the best players and record­ing until they get the best sound. They're not used to a whole union orchestra who has complaints. But a concert composer would be floored by Hollywood musicians not complaining." 
Following his brief introduction to music in the film industry. Schelle showed the

iives lecture at SMC 

NELLIE WILLIAMS/The Observer 

:mts Monday about composing and the 
h, entitled "The Gold Chain around the 
,mposers who cross the line between 
.J 
existing music to new composition. 
Bernard Herman was next in the line­up. Herman's name may be familiar from the credits of one of the many Alfred llitchcock movies for which he composed scores. This particular movie for which Herman composed. "Hangover Square," was a lesser known piece about a mad composer. This piece shows dramatically thr: crossover between film and concert composition. Along with an original 

ek of Mar. 20-26 
score to und<>rwritc the action, Herman 
also had to compose a 12-mintitc piano 
concerto for the mad composer to play 
in the final minutes of the film. In this 
case. Herman's music "underscored the 
action and was the action," Schelle 
said. 

The next film rlip Schelle shovvcd 
would have looked verv familiar to anv 
four vcar old if onlv the director had 
added a dancing ca,;delabra. An origi­
nal vPrsion of' "Beauty and the Beast," 
with a scon written by George Aurich, 
showed a European movie that made 
use of' music. Europeans today are 
more likely to be composing both for 
the concert hall and for films. 

Movie music experienced a new phe­nomenon that came directly from Japan. The score from the movie "Ran," a violent Japanese film about samurai, began a new trend called composing against thP action. f-ilm composers todav still make frequent use of this stvle: when sound effects of a very vio­lent or disturbing scene fade away and are replaced by a floating melody. 
"Our emotional reaction to what is going on is really captured in the score," Schelle said. He showed "Hevolution," a film that appeared onscreen in the l 980s, as an example of' this kind of music. 
Schelle then showed a clip of a film that had a scon' composed by Aaron Copeland. Copeland, who died recently. is still hailed as the Dean of' American Music. If is concert compositions are playt!d by orchnstras \\'orld wide. lie also crossed over thl' line and explored the world of movie music. 
Ip addition to famous movies. such as "Of !\.1ice and Men." Copeland composed the score for a film called "Something \Vild." In this film. the film watcher hears a side of Copeland's music that Americans seldom recognize. 
"As !the main character) falls into her dream." Schelle said. "We get the dark side of' Copeland that we don't know ~o much about in this country." 
As a finale for his lecture, Schelle showed a piece of film that had a score composed by one of the premier con cert composers in Japan, Akira If'ukube. lfukube, whose compositions are known world wide, composed the score for the original "Godzilla." Schelle added an interesting piece of film trivia: Godzilla's growl was created by playing descending notes on the E chord of a double bass backwards. 
So. "The Gold Chain around the Hairy Chest of' Hollywood" proved to be a wonderful exploration into the world of movie music.

AP ENTERTAINMENT BRIEFS 
Diva Whitney Houston was suddenly replaced by Faith Hill at the Oscars due to a bad rehearsal. Her publicist claims her dismissal was caused by a sore throat, rather than her poor performance.

Hill replaces Houston at Oscars 
LOS ANGELES 

The official word is that a sore throat kept Whitney Houston from singing at the Academy Awards. A newspaper, however, reported that she was dropped from the show after bombing in rehearsals. . . 
The New York Post on Tuesday quoted unidentified sources as saymg that Burt Bacharach, a musical director for the Oscar ceremony. was so frustrat­ed with Houston during rehearsals last week that he pulled the plug on her performance. 
Houston's publicists said the singer backed out because her throat was sore. 
"J was in the rehearsal myself the whole time. and it was really obvious the poor lady was having a problem with her throat," Oscar show publicist Jane LaBonte said Tuesday. 
Houston. Bacharach and others involved in the show decided that it would be better if she did not perform, LaBonte said. Ilouston was scheduled to join other singers in a medley of movie songs. She ,vas replaced by country singer f-aith Hill. The Post quoted a source as saying Houston sho":?d up for re~~a.~sal last Thursday, gave Bacharach only 15 minutes and was totally out of it. 
A source told the paper that Houston seemed a bit "discombobulated" dur­ing further rehearsals Friday. missing a cue and singing the wrong song. That's when Bacharach decided to replace her, the source said. 
Priestly on probation for drunk driving 
LOS ANGELES 

Former "Beverlv Hills 9021 O" star Jason Priestley pleaded no contest 
Tuesday to drunke·n driving in a crash that totalled his car and injured a 
friend. He was given five days at a rehab center and three years on proba­
tion. 

Priestley, 30. entered the plea through an atto~n?y to a reduced ch!1~ge of 
misdemeanor driving under the influence with mJury. The actor ongmally 
faced felony charges in the Dec. 3 wreck that left his passenger with a bro­ken arm. "It worked out well, considering," said Peter Knecht, Priestly's attorney. 
'Tm happy with the result, and so is he." Priestley has said he swerved to avoid hitting a deer just before the wreck. 
Swank's speech infuriates mother 
LINCOLN. Neb. Hilary Swank's Oscar acceptance speech infuriated JoAnn Brandon, whose daughter was portrayed by Swank in "Boys Don't Cry.".. ,, 
Brandon said she objected when the actress thanked Brandon Teena -a name that Brandon's daughter, Teena Brandon, used instead of her given name -and referred to her as a man. 
"That set me off," JoAnn Brandon said. "She should not stand up there and thank my child. I get tired of people taking credit for what they don't know." As the film recounts, Teena Brandon posed as a man. dated a woman and then was killed at 21 bv two men after they learned her secret. 
JoAnn Brandon criticized the filmmakers for failing to explain that her daughter was sexually molested by a man as a girl. She said Teena Brandon br,gan dressing in men's clothing and dating women. 
"She pretended she was a man so no other man could touch her." she said. 
Prime Minister commits social faux pas 
CANBERRA. Australia Prime Minister John Howard may have breached royal protocol by touch­ing Queen Elizabeth II. TV images showed Howard apparently putting his hand on the queen's back as he introduced her to dignitaries at a reception Monday. Howard dismissed the brouhaha and refused to reveal whether he had touched the queen. "It is terrific to see the press focusing on the big political issue of the day," he said. sarcastically. 
In 1992, then-Prime Minister Paul Keating touched the queen's back dur­ing her visit to Australia. One British tabloid branded Keating "The Lizard of Oz" for the encounter.

NFL 
Johnson disagrees with Jets 
Associated Press 
PALM BEACH, Fla. 

The rift between the New York Jets and star receiver Keyshawn Johnson grew Tuesday when Johnson said he felt "disrespected" by the team. 
Johnson wants to have his contract renegotiated. lie has two years remaining on the deal he signed when drafted No. 1 overall in 1996, at an average of about $2 million. He feels vastly underpaid and has pointed to other NFL receivers with lesser credentials who make more. 
In a conference call from Los Angeles, Johnson said he is closer than ever to not wanting to play for the Jets again. 
Saints' Williams hires new agent 
Associated Press 
PALM BEACH, Fla. 

Ricky Williams, whose incentive-laden contract with the New Orleans Saints back­fired on him last season, has fired his agent and hired Leigh Steinberg. 
Williams had been repre­sented by Leland Harvey, who works for the rapper Master

based on incentives. many of which were triggered upon reaching 1,600 yards in a sea­son. 
Williams was troubled all year by injuries and finished with just 884 yards on 253 carries. Edgerrin James, whom Indianapolis chose ahead of Williams, made near­ly $15 million last season. James is represented by Steinberg, one of the NFL's upper-echelon agents. 
Earlier this month, Williams was quoted in Sports Illustrated as saying he'd pre­

JeL'i coach Al Groh reiterated earlier this week the team will not trade Johnson, nor will it renegotiate his contract. New team owner Woody Johnson said he believes Keyshawn Johnson should honor his con­tract. 
"He is a member of the team and has a contract with the team," Woody Johnson said Monday at the NFL's annual meetings. "I think contracts are a part of this society and con­tracts are important.

Steinberg  said  he  has  

already talked to Randy Mueller, the Saints' new gen­eral manager, and will even­tually renegotiate Williams' contract. "I always renegoti­ate," said Steinberg, who has re-done deals for Steve Young and Troy Aikman more than a dozen times.

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
Gwynn looks to top 3,000-hit club

PEOHI!\, Ariz. 

So what does Tony Gwynn do for an encore now that he's in the 3,000-hit club?

Wagner for the NL lead with eight. 
Win the World Series title that's eluded him his whole career? He'd love to do that, but the pitching-thin San Diego Padres make no secret that they're building toward 2002 and their new down­town ballpark. not an NL pen­nant like they won two years ago. 
How about simply staying healthy? "That's my only goal," said Gwynn, who

gle into right­r.enter field at Montreal on Aug. 6 for his 3.000th hit. his first r,motion was relief. His milestone season hadn't exactly been a joyride. 
He'd gotten off to a hot start, then strained his left calf on May 21. Missing 44 games on two separate trips to the disabled list meant tak­ing 11 weeks to get the final 25 hits. Evervbodv was ready to relebrate; eve.rybody was asking him what it was like approaching the exclusive mark. 
And Gwynn wasn't altogeth­er thrilled. 
"It just draggr.d on and on and on" Gwvnn said. "You're just sitting there on the DL. waiting to come off. I think if I could have stayed healthy last vear and just kind of methodi­~:ally gotten 72 hits, I'd proba­blv feel a little bit difforent about it. But right now. I'm just glad that part of it is over." 
The lefty finished the season 18th on the career list with 
3.067 hits and with a .338 average, one point short of his career average. He then hit the weight room to strengtlrnn his leg and worked on his mechanics. lie says he feels good swinging the bat and 
bouncing around on the bases. 
Then came a couple of reminders that the end of his career isn't that far off. 
First, the Padres refused to guarantee his contract for 2001. instead giving him a $2 million bonus on top of this year's $4. 3 million salary in exchange for accepting a $6 million dub option for 2001. Gwynn can automatically trig­ger the option with 502 plate appearances this year, the same number needed to quali­fy for the batting title. 
Gwynn would receive a $2 million buyout in the unlikely event the Padres chose not to exercise the option on their most famous player. 
"I can imagine he will be here next year, but the reason we put that in there is because we wanted to address the issue of health and age," 
club presi­

another high probability that we would exercise it." 
Gwynn wou Id like to take care of business by getting the 502 plate appearances. But he'll have to do so knowing that due to his age and history of leg injuries, he'II be getting more days off as dictated by manager Bruce Bochy. 
And both Bochy and Gwynn know tlrn fans will be keeping track or the plate appear­ances. 
"The last thing I really want to know is contracts." Bochy said. "I talked to Tony about it and he agrees, we've got to do what's right for him and what's right for the balldub. If that's giving him a day or get­ting him off his legs late in a game, I'm going to do it. 
"Honestly, I would want him to get that [the 5021. It means we're going to be a better club if he gets at least that many." 
Bochv wishes he would have rested VGwynn more early last season. Gwynn promises not to gripe about playing time, but hopes that he won't have to sit much if he's playing well. 
Someone recently slipped a magazine into Gwynn's locker with the headline. "Turning 40."

Williams breaks bone in foot 
Associated Press 
TUCSON. Ariz. 

The Arizona Diamondbacks' bid to repeat as NL West cham­pions suffered a severe jolt Tuesday when All-Star third baseman 
M a t t \tVilliams broke a bone in his right foot in an exhibi­tion game against the Seattle 


Mariners. Williams 
T e a m spokesman Mike Swanson said Williams will be sidelined about six weeks, and foot spe­cialist Dr. Peter Mitchell said the injury would not require surgery. 
Williams fouled Frankie Rodriguez's pitch off the foot in the second inning, but complet­ed his at bat, lining out to cen­ter. He was replaced by Lenny Harris in the top of the third inning. 
"Obviously. I'm disappoint­

ed," Williams said. "I was real­ly looking forward to beginning the season and playing on opening day. There are some things, especially in this game. that you can't control." 
The Diamondbacks have plenty of talent to sucr.eed without him, Williams said. 
"Fortunately, we have a lot of great players on this team. and our team will be just fine and play well," he said, "and I look forward to getting back as soon as possible." 
Williams was taken to a hos­pital for X-rays, which showed his second metatarsal was bro­ken. He left for Phoenix, where he met with Mitchell. 
"It's a non-displaced fracture of the second metatarsal whkh won't require surgery," Mitchell said. 
ln 1995, a break in the same bone sidelined Williams for 68 games with the San Francisco Giants. On June 3 of that year, Williams fouled a ball off his right foot on a pitch from Philadelphia's Paul Quantrill. He underwent surgery to have pins inserted in the foot. At the time of that injury. Williams was hitting .381. 
"It's a tremendous loss," teammate Greg Colbrunn said. "He's the kev hitter in our line­up and defensively. But the realization is he's not going to be around here for however long they say. You can't sit around and cry about it. You have to move on and do other things to help make up for it." 
The injury came in the Diamondbacks' final game before breaking their spring training camp and moving back to Phoenix. It made for a solemn departure for the play­ers. 
"That's everybody's fear. for something like that to happen the last week of spring train­ing," reliever Dan Plesac said. "When it happens during the season, somehow it's easier to swallow. For it to happen down here when the games don't mean anything, it stinks." 
v\Tilliams is the team's acknowledged leader in the clubhouse. 
"His presence and leadership are just as important as his ability," reliever Darren Holmes said.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL 

Davis, Pyatt suspended after arrest 
Associated Press 
LEXINGTON, Ky. 
Kentucky football players Garry Davis and Brad Pyatt have been suspended from the team following their arrests after police broke up a late­night party at Davis' house. coach Hal Mumme said Tuesday. 
Davis, 22. a junior wide receiver. was charged with disorderly conduct and allow­ing nine minors to possess alcohol. Police halted the party early Saturday morning at his home near campus. 

Pyatt, 19, a freshman wide receiver. was charged with criminal mischief. Officers said he damaged a police car. 
The suspensions will remain in effect until their legal issues are resolved, Mumme said. 
Davis and Pyatt wouldn't be required to forfeit their schol­arships under the university's student-athlete alcohol policy because no DUI charge was involved, a statement from the university said. 
But an athlete charged with public intoxication or under­age consumption would be put on probation and be required to attend counseling. 
The statement said Mumme would have no further com­ment on the matter. 
Davis played in l O games last season, catching 26 pass­es for 312 yards and one touchdown. 
The arrests came less than two weeks after junior corner­back Jeremy Bowie was arrested in Lexington on drunken driving charges. Bowie also has been suspend­ed from the team. 
Spring practice begins Wednesday.

NHL 
Rangers fire general manager and coach 
Associated Press 

NEW YOHK 

With only four games left and the playoffs out of reach for the third straight season, the New York Rangers deaned house Tuesday. firing general manag­er Neil Smith and coach John Muckier. 
Smith. in his 11th vear as GM and president, was· in charge when the Hangers won the 1994 Stanley Cup -ending a 54-year drough.t. But he has not come close to matching that success. 
The Rangers, who have the NHL's largest payroll at $61 million. are five points behind Buffalo in the race for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. New York (29-38-11-:1) has lost five straight games and is 1-8-1 in its last 1Ogames. 
"Once you make a decision like this, the sooner the better " Madison Square Garden pres·i­dent Dave Checketts said. "\.Ve made the decision last night. I didn't see any reason to wait." 
Muckier was in his second full season as New York's coach after getting the job on Feb. 19. 1998. He replaced the fired Colin Campbell, now the NHL's disciplinarian. 
Assistant John Tortorella will coach the team through the final four games. Checketts said a GM will bf' hired and he will pick the next coach. 
A source dose to the team said Wayne Gretzky will be involved in helping select a new coach and genPral manager. but Checketts would not com­ment on possible successors. 
"He's a former Hanger and one of the great all-time play­ers," Checketts said of Gretzky, whose last three NHL seasons were spent in New York. "I don't expect him to be a part of that process." 
The final blows for Muckier and Smith were home-and­home embarrassments on Sunday and Monday in which the Rangers were beaten 8-2 and 6-0 by Detroit. 
Madison Square Gardtm fans booed the players and shouted for \1uckler's dismissal. They got their wish a day later. 
"It's going to be a tremen­dous amount of work, and it's going to require new leader­ship," Checketts said of the rebuilding process. "There 
should be more scoring, more defense, more pride in the Hanger jersey. 
"I \.Vant to dd what I have to to make it work for the fans. They deserve so much more." 
If the Rangers fa.ii to qualify for the postseason, it will be the first time since 1963-66 they have missed the playoffs in three consecutive vears. 
"At best it was disappointing, at worst embarrassing," Checketts said. 
New York'.s loss to Detroit on Monday also ensured the Hangers' third straight home­losing record. That hasn't hap­pened since 1957-58 through 1959-60. 
"At times things don't work out as planned and this is one of those times," Checketts said. "In the best interests of the franchise and our fans, it has become clear that we have to go in a different direction." 
As coach of Edmonton and Buffalo. Muckier never missed the playoffs in six seasons. lie was 70-91-24, plus three regu­lation ties, in 185 games with the Rangers. 
Muckier coached Edmonton to the Stanley Cup title in 1990 and the conference finals the following year. He served as Buffalo's general manager and coach for two seasons, before relinquishing the coaching job in 1995. 
After a seven-game winning streak turned the Hangers' for­tunes around. the club is 6-15­4 since February's All-Star weekend. 
"These decisions are made about results," Checketts said. "Our record since the All-Star break has clearly brought this al~ t,~> a head. Losing creates this. 

The Hangers' last playoff appearance in 1997 lasted until the conference finals when the club was eliminated in rive games. Those were Mark Messier's last games with New York before he left for Vancouver as a free agent. 
Acquisitions such as Theo Fleury.· Slyvain Lefebvre, Stephane Quintal and Tim Taylor, and the re-signing of captain Brian Leetch to a big contract failed to pay off. 
'Tm not taking myself out of responsibility for what hap­pened," Checketts said. "None of the free agents has per­formed the way we thought they would."

Associated Press 

FRESNO. Cali[ 
Fresno State is investigating reports that several members of the basketball team received free meals from a local restaurant even after the owner was warned such handouts could violate college athletic rules. 
Ted Kunishige, owner of Tomodachi Japanese Hestaurant and a basketball booster regularly seen at Selland Arena games. admit­ted to The Fresno Bee last week he had given away "sev­eral thousand dollars" worth of free food to the players during the past seven years. 
Seniors Larry Abney and Terrance Roberson. who helped Fresno State reach the NCAA tournament for the first time in 16 years this sea­son, have confirmed they both ate free meals at Kunishige's restaurant during their col­lege careers, the newspaper reported. 
''I'd go in there and pull my money out to pay, and some­times he'd tell me to put it away, and sometimes I paid," Abney said. 
Athletic director Al Bohl told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Benjamin Quillian, the university's vice president for administration, is conducting a review with the assistance of outside

counsel. 
"We're cooperating fully 
with the NCAA and will have 
no further comments until the 
review is completed," he said. 
Under NCAA rulP-s. coaches are permitted to accept extra benefits such as free mP-als, but student-athletes are not allowed to receive any extra benefits unless they are authorized through a special arrangement. Agency spokes­woman Jane Jankowski on Tuesday said the "basic rule of thumb" is that provisions such as meals arc not viola­tions "if it can be demonstrat­ed that the same benefit is available to other students.", 
Jankowski said she could not confirm whether there was an investigation outside the university's internal probe. She also declined to discuss possible penalties in such cases or the agency's history of disciplining schools found to be in violation of meal policies. saying it would only be speculation. 
Bohl told The Bee that the university took steps to stop possible NCAA violations as early as 1997, sending a let­ter to Kunishige. In January 1998. Bohl's department sent a letter to coach Jerry Tarkanian inquiring about Kunishige's repeated pres­ence in seats allocated to Tarkanian as part of his con­tract. The Bee reported.

Some time soon, he may return to his homeland and complete the cycle by helping in some ,vay to bring about a much more important victory. 
"I think about Sudan a lot," said Duany, his voice betraying a slight Indiana twang. "I worry about the children who don't get the chances I got. It's important for me to make the most of my opportu­nities and then try to make a difference."

Billy Donovan Pelphrey got
for athletes when your Florida head coach a job coaching 
career ends that way." Pelphrey said Tuesday. 
His career ended on a play that ranks up there with The Catch and the Immaculate Rer.eption in the collective memory of American sports fans. 
Or, from Pelphrey's end of the action, it might draw comparisons to Bill Buckner's bobble or Jackie Smith's dropped touchdown catr.h in the Super Bowl. 
There Wf~re 2.1 seconds remaining in overtime of the 1992 East regional final. Kentuckv's Sean Woods hit a rum1er in the lane to put the \Vildcats up by one. 
After a timeout, Duke's Grant Hill released the ball from the o'pposite baseline. Laettncr ran up l'rom the baseline and snuggled himself near Pelphrey at the free throw line. The replay shows the ball just missing Pelphrey's outstretched hands. A full five inr.hes taller than Pelphrey, Laettner collected the pass, then turned around and made the shot, a 16­foot jumper. 
"It was so real to me." Pelphrey said, recalling the sensation of the ball hitting his hands, one that turned out not to be reaL 
Duke won 104-103. Pelphrey and the rest of that brokenhearted team dropped to the floor in 
shock. Their season ended one win, one point and one miraculous play away from a chance at their first and only Final Four. 
It was the last chance at redemption for Pelphrey 
and the other seniors  on  
that team.  
They  had  come  to  

Kentucky in 1987. before 
NCAA sinctions tarnished 
both the reputation and 
hopes of one of the coun­try's most storied pro­grams. They had been part of the only team to post a losing record since the days before Adolph Hupp. 
Somehow. they had scratched their way back to respectability, then excellence, and were about to formally shed the label as being "the guys who were at Kentucky when Kentucky was bad," as Pelphrey puts it. 
"\Ve had put all our eggs in one basket and losing wasn't in the equation," he said. "To have it end so abruptly, and with things so 
at Oklahoma State for Eddie Sutton. the coach who recruited him to Kentucky in the late 1980s. Then, another twist of fate: Billy Donovan lured Pelphrey to Marshall in 1994, and Pelphrey missed Oklahoma State's trip to the Final four a year later. 
"He came so close," Donovan said. "Now, all of the sudden, he's in this sit­uation. For him to be able to go to the Final Four right now ... to me, that's what brings a smile to my face." 
Pelphrey's. too. 
I Ie has two kids now and a bright future. Some say the 31-year-old assistan t could be a head coach as soon as next season. 
"He's verv intense," senior Kenyan \Veaks said. "lie gives you great detail. lie really breaks down what other teams like to do. He knows the game." 
Several seasons away from the heartbreak have added perspective. Pelphrey doesn't think anything will ever replace the void of not going to the Final Four as a player. 
"But I can walk in my kids' rooms at night and they don't care one way or another whether that shot went in or out," he said. "The way things turned out. I can't say my life would be any better right now had that shot not gone down."

lead. the Irish gave the Nittany Lions every rhance possible for a comeback. PPnn State's play­ers rebounded several missed Irish baskets. and the Irish com­mitted four consecutive turnovers. Junior guard Joe Crispin hit two Penn State bas­kets to bring the Nittany Lions to within seven at 18-11. 
But Penn State didn't gain much at Notrr Danrn·s expt>nse. A trey by Irish frt>shman Jere Macura put the Irish back ahead by 10. Then Dillon s,.,,iped a steal. taking it tlw length of the tloor for a fast break layup. and the Irish were once more in con­trol. 
"Every time they made a run. we were able to countrr that run." Murphy said. 
The Nittany Lions kept looking to narrow the gap. Crispin nailed a three-pointer. First Team Ing Ten player Jarrett Stephens dunk0d the ball for two points. and teammate Titus Ivory scored three on a bucket and foul shot. 
Just as quickly as the Irish began to fade away. their lead dropping to four at 27-23 late in thP first half. they went on a 13­
J 
I point run. Everybody got into thf' act as Macura put back a Carroll miss. Graves dropped in four points and Carroll went for a wide-open layup. The sweetest play of the game came foll<nving a Nittany Lions turnover ·with 5.1 seconds to go in the first period. Notre Dame called timeout to plan its posses­sion. Thf' Irish threw a cross­court inbounds pass to Dillon. He lobbed it inside to Murphy. \\/ho muscled in two of his 18 points and nailed the free throw to go with the hoop. "We had a good run late in the 
l 
first half," Doherty said. "Jere Macura was pretty darn good on the offensive boards. and I think that was a big key for us to get that lead back to 15 at half­time." 
The two teams played another 20 minutes of ball, but that was 
__ mainly for show, as they decided the outcome in the first half. Penn State never got closer than 12 in the second stanza. The defensive intensity of the Irish forced the Nittany Lions into shooting just 33 percent from the field and committing 20 turnovers. "You·ve got to put the ball in the hole to sustain your defense," Penn State coach Jerry Dunn said. "\Vhon you couple tho turnovers and the poor shooting performance, it can be detrimental to your defense. We had some decent looks at the basket, and we pkked a bad time to shoot poor­ly." Carroll in particular was impressive defensively. He tal­lied four steals. intercepting Penn State passes with a verti­cal jump that seemed high enough to scale Mount Everest. lie also hit six of eight free throws down the stretch to cement the outcome. "I was impressed with our guys' intensity," Doherty said. "These kids. they want to win." The Irish are going for one more ,vin Thursday when they !'ace the \Vake Forest Deamon Deacons in the NIT cha~piw onship. ·

quiet as a mouse and the "Let's go Irish" chant echoed loud and clear at Madison Square Garden. 
"I thought the Penn State fans were great and l thought our fans were great," said first-year head coach Matt Doherty, whosfl Irish squad went wire to wire for the victory. "It was a good college basketball atmosphere." 
Notre Dame answered ev,~ry Penn State basket in the first 10 minutes of the second half and wouldn't let the feisty Nittany Lions back in the gamt:""!. 
Tuesday's win was a total team effort, as eight Irish play~ ers contributed with four or more poinl5. Doherty also got 23 points from his bench. 
"I think [the balance] was great," sophomore All-American Troy Murphy said. "Penn State was unable to focus on anybo_dy and with Jere [Macura] hitting those threes early, it opened up the inside. We have some grr~at shooters and we showed we can spread it out." 
Doherty was also pleased with his team's mental attitude prior to and during the game. 
"I was happy vith the defen­sive intensity and that we were able to maintain it in the second half," Doherty said. "It's tough to play with a lead against a dan­gerous team like Penn State and they didn't allow them to get a string going in the second half. 
"I had to threaten them some with electric. shocks from the trainers," Doherty joked. "But thes<' kids want to win and I'm glad we have tho opportunity in tlw NIT to play for a rhampi­onship." 
So far Pverything is going right for the Irish in that quest. Thoy definitely have the motivation. 
"We are using this NIT to show people that we belonged in the NCAA Tournament." Murphy said. "We are doing that so far." 
They also seem to bo very comfortable at the Madison Square Garden. 

"I like playing here-," Murphy said. "This is our fifth game here and it's a nice placo to play." 
Now that the ingredient<-; are in place. Murphy and the Irish am in position to bring home the school's first-ever postseason title. 
"There are only a fev, teams that end their season with a win," sophomore David Graves said."If'we win, we will be one of them. So that will just be the icing on the cake. No one expected us to be here and it is a relief to prove them all wrong." 
ButDoherty doesn't know the meaning of relief. When he is on the sideline coaching. he tries his best to keep himsfllf out of that comfort zone. 
"Hight now I feel in control," Doherty said following the victo­ry. "But I never feel comfortable during the game. I'm always worried. I yanked Jimmy when he thre\\· the ball away t\,\'icc and didn't contest a short jumper. lie walked off the court with a smile on his face, but I wasn't in the mood to smile. I wasn't comfortable until thPrP vvere 30 seconds left and WP were up 20." 
Don't worry Matt. One morn victory and you·11 feel enough relief' and gratification lo last you through the offseason.

"There are a lot or good

"We've played against them 
before but who knows when 
you start playing outside -any­
thing can happen in Bookstore." 
Versatility, the surprise of the 
1999 tournament finds itself at 
the No. 3 spot, after making a 
Cinderella-like run to the finals 
last year. Four out of' five play­
rrs arr returning to the team: 
captain Chris Dillon, Joe Lillis. 
James Cochran and Jason 
Childress. Thcv lost a valuable 
player in Jo.hn Hiltz, who 
walked on to the Notre Dame 
varsity basketball team and is 
ineligible for the tournament, 
but gains some sharp shooting 
in newcomer Hoss I lanson. 
"John had a great tournament last year. but Hoss is a good player," said Dillon. "We lose some size but gain a littlP bit of' shooting touch." 
The addition of Hanson allows 
for a restrur.tured game plan 
that Versatility thinks will help 
them in the tournament. 
"Hiltz took over sr,oring for us last year -he was the guy tak­ing most of' our shots," said Dillon. "This year, we're not as on<'-dimensional. It opens up a lot of opportunity for us to spn~ad our offense around." 
V<' rsati lity knows what to expect from the top seeds if they meet in tlrn-tournament. Dillon's squad lost to the mcm­be rs of Keyplay.com in this year's intrrhall tournament and also fell to NDToday.r.om during Midnight Madness. 
"That's probably why we're ranked thret\ but when you get to the top teams you can really throw the rankings out the win­dow," said Dillon. "We're just 
going to go in and play hard." 
Bookstore Basketball's 1999 
Championship team, Malicious 
Prosecution dropped from its 
No. 3 ranking last year to the 
16th spot in this year's tourna­
ment. 
Captain JC Coury is the lone 
returner for the skilled team, 
but with four new talented play­
ers in Justin Crawford, Jason 
Sr.hauer, Mike Oesterle and 
Steve Orloski, Malicious 
Prosecution is ready to defend 
its title. 
"\Vn expected the ranking to 
come as it did," said Coury. 
"When you lose four guys you 
expect to see a drop. But our 
strength is shooting -anyone 
can shoot very well from any­
where on the court and we're 
comfortable playing together." 
In addition to the thousands 
of registered players in this 
year's tournaments, several 
varsity athletes will be plaving 
for ranked teams. · 
Sophomore football player Tony Fisher is making a repeat appearance on sixth-ranked Cor.oa Butter, while teammates Bobby Brown and Arnaz Battle will test their basketball skills on No. 10 Rampage. 
Eleventh-ranked Ilit Squad will benefit from the ball han­dling skills of Raki Nelson and Eric Chappel, while Tom Lopienski will suit up for No. 14 The Individuals. 
Varsity soccer standout Reggie McKnight's team. Like ·whoa, comes in at No. 15 in the tournament seedings.

In men's play. top seeds lived up to their hype as pool play unfolded on Saturday. Michigan rolled through three opponents. as did the Irish in their pool. Playing tight zone defense spearheaded by Cory Padesky. the Irish overr.ame a 12-10 deficit in the opening round to subdue a strong Dayton squad, 15 -10.

By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN Asso<:1.Hc: Sports Editor

Senior point guard Jimmy Dillon marked the game's tempo, giving the Irish their first two points on the way to a.15-2 earlv lead. Dillon, better known for passing off an open look to his teammates than for taking the ball to the hoop, started the Irish scoring off \\'ith an off-bal­ance jumper as the shot clock ran down. 
"I think Jimmy's first shot of the game kind of set it all off," sophomore forward David Graves said. "You never really expect that coming from Jimmy.'' 
The Irish opened things up with wide open three-pointers by All-American Troy Murphy and freshman guard Matt Carroll. followed by two Graves free throws. As the Irish domi­nated· the boards. sophomore f'onvard Harold Swanagan scored in the paint and back-up point guard Martin lngelsby swished a trey. 
Six Irish players scored in the first six minutes of play. helping demolish the Nittany Lions· hopes of victory. 
"The last five games or so, Coach has really stressed for us to come out and be the aggres­sors." Murphy said. "Right from the start, we wanted to be the aggressors. I think that we did a good job of that tonight, and kind of got them back on their heels a little bit at first."
