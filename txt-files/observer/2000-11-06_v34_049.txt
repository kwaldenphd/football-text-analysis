Hitting the books with Alliance for Catholic Education 
Former ACE pupils return to the program that once inspired them 
By KATE NAGENGAST 
· Assistant News Editor 
Notre Dame's renowned ser­vice through teaching program, the Alliance for Catholic Education (ACE), not only pro­vides understaffed parochial schools with teachers -but also works to foster mentoring relationships between the stu­dents and their teachers. These teachers, however, are students themselves -recent college graduates working to Dame without the ACE teach­ers' [influence) .... Ali the teachers were very informa­tive," said Tai Romero, a fresh­man who had ACE teachers at her high school, Bishop Sullivan in Baton Rouge, La. "Everybody in Louisiana stays in Louisiana because the state has a great tuition assistance program ... so it was really tempting to stay 'there. but the education is obvi­ously not the standard of Notre Dame. The ACE teachers were there to tell us to trv different 
things."

Founded in 1994, the program has grown immensely and continues to flourish. This year the program placed 151 teachers in 13 states and 25 dioceses. As a result of three new grants, schools in 11 more states and 22 more dioce­ses will receive teachers who have been prepared according to the ACE model by next fall. 
Notre Dame students not only serve as teachers in the ACE program now, but some of them were the pupils. A number of current Notre Dame under­classmen studied under ACE teachers in high school -an experience they deemed instru­mental in making their college decisions. 
"I never would have even imagined coming to Notre 
school and before I met my ACE teachers, I had no concept of Notre Dame, or of college at all for that mat­ter. But they would share their stories and in one instance even -because we are all big Louisiana State fans in Louisiana -my ACE Spanish teacher forced us to listen to Notre Dame's fight song," he said. "Seeing her example ­how well-rounded, how spiritu­al and smart she is -it stuck with me that that was a product of Notre Dame because all the other ACE teachers that fol­lowed were like that so I knew that was where I wanted to be." 
T8aching by example is just one of the values the ACE pro­gram instills in its teachers.

An ACE teacher tackles another day ofschool in Jacksonville

McCain stops in South Bend to support Chocola Congress bid 
By JASON ·McFARLEY 
Assistant News Editor 
Just over a week after presidential candidate George W. Bush visited Michiana, other promi­nent Republicans were on hand Saturday to rally support for congressional nominee Chris Chocola's campaign. 
Among them was U.S. Senator John McCain, who urged voters to elect Chocola in a Third District race that McCain and others said might determine control of the House of Hcpresen tatives. 
McCain. who said he was campaigning in tightly contested congressional districts to help Hepublicans maintain control of the House, por­trayed Chocola as a candidate who would bring strong values to government. 
"What's important is we have a man of decen­cy and integrity. We need this kind of represen­tation in Washington," McCain said of Chocola, who's campaign for incumbent Democrat Tim Rocmcr's seat has gained momentum in recent weeks. On Oct. 27, Texas Gov. George W. Bush stopped in South Bend. 
McCain, who vied against Bush for the GOP presidential nomination, told an enthusiastic audience inside a hangar at the South Bend Regional Airport that Chocola will work for cam­paign finance reform, one of McCain's signature issues. The Arizona senator said as well that Chocola will "be an independent voice" in bring-

Arriving at the blue, two­story cinder block school at 6:10, he goes directly upstairs to his seventh grade class­room. He eats breakfast and reads the local newspaper, and at 7:05, begins to write a science exam for his eighth grade class, which he will give later in the day. 
Students begin to walk in at 
7:40. Nineteen students are present when Chris, standing behind a white podium at the front of the room, says calmly, "Put your social studies books, spelling books and your gym shoes in your lockers. Ones ­go to your lockers." The class is dismissed one number at a time to the blue lockers in the classroom. While other stu­dents are putting their things away, three girls walk in late and put their things away qui­etly.

I low many or you are as anxious as I am for this entire presidential election to be over and done with?

look forward to the election's conclusion. 
The constant barrage never seems to end, and 

it has reached a point where I cannot open a 
paper or turn on a television without being con­
fronted with one or the presidential candidates 
claiming to be better than their opponent. 
This technique of negative campaigning and "dirty politics" used by the different candidates is just frustrating. Everyone knows that the candi­dates are not perfect. and like everyone else, they have made mistakes in their lives. 
Nevertheless, it has become an accepted politi­

cal technique for candidates to smear the reputa­
tions of their opponents. Too often in today's 
political arena, politicians appeal to the almighty 
vote. and never stop to think about the overall 
ramifications of their decisions on the personal 
lives or their opponents. 
For instance, in a desperate attempt to garner a few extra votes in the closing days of the elec­tion, Gore's team recently released a statement claiming that Bush was convicted ofa DUI 20 years ago. What does this really accomplish? Gore's plan to smear Bush's reputation in the hope that it may sway some undecided voters just frustrates people and makes them even more disenchanted with the entire political process. 
On top of pursonal attacks, both parties also put out commercials that question the proposed plans of their rivals. Gore produced a commer­cial claiming that Bush promised both the elderly and the young social security money that he does not have to give. In response, Bush's team released a commercial claiming that Gore used "fuzzy math" in his proposals, and that he is deliberately lying to the American people. These commercials succeed in confusing voters, and make them even more unsure about which can­didate is speaking the truth. 
The exorbitant amount of nasty and unneces­sary political and personal bashings has gotten out of hand. The negative campaigning has not affected my vote, but it has given me a huge headache. 
It is my sincere hope that eventually political candidates will refrain from personal attacks, and will solely focus on the issues. To their cred­it, both Bush and Gore have done a fine job of establishing the differences in their two posi­tions, and in providing two distinct platforms that voters can choose from. It is unfortunate that in the final few weeks of their campaigns, they have resorted to petty political techniques. As a young, idealistic voter, l am anxiously waiting for a can­didate to emerge that will rise above dirty cam­paigning techniques and partisan politics.

College newspapers release endorsements 
LOS ANGELES. Ca. 

The editorial boards of college newspapers around the nation arc weighing in on who they support for president in the upcoming election. 
But coming to that decision can be challenging for editorial boards, which are sometimes split along ide­ological lines. 
While many college newspapers have not published their decisions yet, a random sample of those that have show a decidedly Democratic lean. 
But some are also taking the Nader factor into consideration. 
Though the editorial board of University of Michigan's newspaper, The Michigan Daily said it supported Gore, it acknowledged several of Green Party candidate Ralph

Civil rights ignored by colleges 
ATHENS, Ohio 
American colleges and universities routinely betray the nation's and the students' liberties through cen­soring speech and hiding shady practices in the shad­ows, said Alan Kors, president of the Foundation for the Individual Rights in Education, in a speech in Ohio University's Irvine Auditorium. "Universities cannot deny in public what they do in private," said Kors. a University of Pennsylvania professor. "The mere thought of public exposure most often works." Kors explained the students who fought for freedoms are now the ones who deny rights in campus speech and in judiciaries proceedings. in an effort to save students from themselves." It's a new standard of bad faith," he said to an audience of roughly 50. "Freedom of the students was the first thing to be sacrificed." Judiciaries in America are run by parti­san people with agendas other than justice, Kors said. Instead, judiciaries are controlled by officials who want to use the system as a means to advance their political agendas.

WASHINGTON STATE 
Students at high risk for mono 
PULLMAN, Wash. 
Young adults have a higher probability of contract­ing mononucleosis, said Mary C. Steed, the nurse coordinator for Washington State University Health and Wellness Services. According to medical records at HWS, 47 students tested positive for mononucleo­sis since January. People often perceive mononucleo­sis as being hfghly contagious, Steed said, but in actuality, it is not easily transferable. Mononucleosis, usually referred to as mono or the "kissing disease," is most commonly contracted through sharing, such as drinks, cigarettes or lipstick. Mono is most preva­lent in October and November, said Dennis J. Garcia, a family and sports medicine physician for IIWS. Garcia said he believes the reason for a higher fre­quency in the fall and early winter is due to colder weather. Students start hanging out indoors with other people and they decrease their amount of phys­ical activity. He said a lack of physical activity depresses the immune system, which makes people more susceptible to infection.

pleated cotton skirts down to their knees with white, short­slceved, button down shirts. They wear white socks and black shoes. Their shirts, like the boy's white polo shirts. must be buttoned all the way up and their shoes tied at all times. 
Chris officially begins the day at 7:45 with one Hail Mary, fol­lowed by a scripture reading. He raises his voice over a noisy truck on the road that runs right behind the school to finish the reading from St. Luke before he instructs the class, "Now work quietly on your journal entries. Tho sentences are on the board, as usual." 
For the first time, there is silence as the students work on the sentences for 10 minutes. While they're working, Chris walks around the room to keep them on task. One boy, Daunte, begins to talk. Chris passes his desk and taps on the student's desk lightly with his fingertips, alerting Daunte (but not the rest of the class) of his presence and therefore reminding him to continue working. 
At 11, Chris's seventh grade switches to another classroom for math. The eighth-grade class, Chris's class from last year. comes in for the day's sci­ence lesson. 
The minute this class walks in, Chris lets his guard down. He laughs and jokes with his students. When one student ceases to quiet down, Chris says, "You're reminding me of one of the original rap songs. Are you familiar with 'Pushing me to the edge?"' The class bursts into laughter and a few students finish the popular song, "We're try-ing not to lose our heads." The class then qui­ets down as Chris hands out science tests to the students. 
Chris said that the difference between the way he taught last year and the way he teaches this year is very significant. "This year I'm giving them more structure. l know I have to be more organized about the little things that, in the begin­ning. I didn't think mattered." 
He jokes around with his class from last year a lot, but does, so very :,~rely with this year s class. I m much more distanced this year -I'm not their pal. My relationship with my kids from last year is too much like they am my younger siblings. But l think I'm setting myself up so that second semes­ter, I can be their pal. and they'll still respect me." 
Chris uses last year's experi­ence paired with the advice and examples of the administrators and other teachers to know how he can contribute to this school's success. 
''My biggest strength as a teacher here is that l'm mold­able. The administration and the teachers know these kids; they know their culture and their needs, and I don't. They can make me into the kind of teacher they need for the school." 
"Structure is the most impor­tant thing, and t help to main­tain that. From the minute they walk in the door, they have structure," he said. "Even little things--tying shoes up, for example, or not wearing their

coats in class--are important in providing structure. The kids try to anything they can to dif­ferentiate themselves, but so much of the structure comes from knowing you have to con­form to the rules if you want to stay at this school." 
Sister Elise Kennedy, princi­pal of St. Pius, agrees that class management is one of the hard­est aspects of teaching for any teacher, especially for young teachers. 
But the structure their school provides is vital to the school's mission. 
"Many of the kids here live very poor lives. We want to provide stability for them here · because they don't necessarily have it at home," she said. 
"Our school has greatly bene­fited from the ACE program. The teachers who come here are young and enthusiastic. Their enthusiasm sparks enthu­siasm among the rest of the fac­ulty to make sure that the stu­dents succeed," said Elise. 
At the end of the day, Chris goes outside with a few student council members to sell candy and soda for fundraising. Ile jokes around with the students before heading hack up to his room. 
Chris is sitting at his desk when an eighth-grade student, Kyron, runs in and asks Mr. Adrian to come back down to the parking lot because there is an emergency. Not knowing what happened, but picturing many frightening possibilities, Chris runs down to the parking lot. 
There is an accident -both his and Margaret Oakar's (another ACE teacher at St. 
Pius) cars were hit in the park­ing lot. No one was hurt, but neither of their cars can be dri­ven. At about 6., the second­grade teacher takes Chris and Margaret home. 
The day didn't quite end up how Chris had planned it. Although structure and stability are two things that Chris strives most to provide for his stu­dents, they are two things that he does not truly have much control over. But he and Margaret have a community waiting for them at home to talk to. 
During their community din­ner that night, Chris and Margaret tell their story. Instead of despair, the rest of the community responds with laughter. They laugh at the bizarre turn of events for the St. Pius teachers, and they all laugh as each person shares events of his or her day with everyone else. 
The stability that the commu­nity support provides for each member helps each teacher to deal with the problems and issues that arise during the day. They help each other to be fresh teachers every day. striv­ing to provide the structure that their students need to succeed. 
After dinner, the teachers busy themselves with lesson planning, talking to friends and family on the phone, or visiting with each other. Chris works on his portfolio for the academ­ic portion of the program before going to bed in the home that is as quiet now as it was when the day began. 
And then a night of sleep to prepare for another day of school.

McCain also interjected some humor into his speech. At times, the senator's talk resembled a stand-up comedy routine. During through the appearance, McCain directed some barbs at his own unsuccessful presiden­tial bid.

McCain joined other Hepublicans Saturday in urging the importance of Chocola's election. 
Virginia congressman Tom Davis took time during the rally 
to  direct  sharp  barbs  at  
Chocola's  opponent,  Tim  
Hoerner.  

"Yes, I am from Virginia. Yes, I am Tim Roemer's congress­man," Davis said in reference to the issue Chocola has made to Roemer·s residence outside tho Washington, D.C., area. 
Davis and South Carolina con­gressman Lindsey Graham both said that a win for Chocola would be an early signal of Ilepublican control of the House. 
"In Indiana, where the polls close the earliest in the nation, if you elect Chris Chocola, we've won the House," Davis said. 
Graham, a House manager during the impeachment of President Rill Clinton said vot­ing in the election Tuesday would be "payback time" for congressmen who supported Clinton throughout the case. 
"Looking back on that impeachment process, didn't it just make you want to choke some folks?" Graham quipped. 
Oklahoma congressman J.C. Watts' appearance at the rally Saturday was cancelled due the the recent death of his father. 

Hepublican gubernatorial candidate David McIntosh and other GOP candidates for state, local and county elections also made appearances.

Romero, who now works in 
the ACE office on campus and 
hopes to one day be an ACE 
teacher herself, said the pro­
gram is reaching ils goals. 

"They have personal goals and community goals. Their personal goals are to get their masters in education ... but as teachers they are not only sup­posed to teach their subject matter, but also Christian morality and set an example," said Romero. "I think they were really good examples. They did a lot of things for each other, they were always there to lend a hand." 
Romero is not the only ACE pupil who has considered car­rying on that helping tradition as an ACE teacher. Kat Walsh. a sophomore from St. Joseph Academy in Brownsville, Texas, hopes to one-day return to her hometown as an ACE teacher. "I want to do ACE, but I hope to go to Brownsville, because I want to give back to the community that I came from.

Selassie reburied amidst controversy 
Associated Press 
ADDIS ABABA 
Bells tolled and thousands of Ethiopians wailed and applauded Sunday as Haile Selassie, their last emperor, was finally laid to rest 25 years after his mysterious death. 
As leaders of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church stood by, resplen­dent in their colorful robes, elderly veterans of Ethiopia's 1936-41 strug­gle against Italian occupation carried the coffin -draped in the nation's red, green and gold nag -up the steps of Trinity Cathedral. The emperor's family, friends and associ­ates embraced at their first public gathering since 1974, when he was overthrown by Marxist military offi­cers. 
A crypt had been waiting at the· cathedral since Haile Selassie's remains were discovered under a concrete slab on the grounds of his former palace in 1992 -17 years after he died under house arrest. 
Officially, his death at age 83 was due to complications from a prostate condition. The Haile Selassie I Foundation, which had worked for eight years to give the emperor a suitable burial, claims he was assas­sinated. During a trial that seeks to bring members of the 197 4-91 regime of Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam to justice for the killings of dissidents and monarchy loyalists, two of the emperor's personal ser­vants testified that he was killed on a night they were ordered out of his room. 
Haile Selassie, who assumed the throne in 1930, was the last in a line of emperors who forged the modern Ethiopian state out of an ancient land of feuding chieftains. To his supporters, his rule was a time of peace and stability during which modern education was introduced in the oldest independent state in Africa. Critics say he was too slow in reforming a feudal society. 
Sisay Taddese, a 19-year-old stu­dent who was kicking a soccer ball around with friends as the funeral cortcge passed between Bahta Taika church -where Haile Selassie's remains had laid since 1992 -and Meskel, the city's main square, said he believed the emperor was "a responsible leader who ran a benev­olent government." 
Since the 1974 revolution that ousted him dissolved into terror, Ethiopians have suffered a series of wrenching events. A cataclysmic 1984-85 famine devastated the nation and the 1991 ouster of Mengistu by another group of rebels sent the nation of 62 million reeling once again. 
While the funeral could be seen as the end of an era, the nation remains one of the world's 10 poorest coun­tries and has yet to formally end a two-year border war with neighbor­ing Eritrea. 
The government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, which grew out of the rebel movement that ousted Mengistu, made no formal statement about Haile Selassie until last week. when it called him "a tyrant and oppressor of the masses." 

Although the foundation issued an open invitation to the government to attend the funeral, no one official showed up, and state-run broadcast media -the only ones operating in this Horn of Africa nation. -did not mention the event. 
Randi Ronning Balsvik. a history professor at Norway's Tromso University and an Ethiopian special­ist. said Meles' government had "played it all very safely" by allowing the funeral to take place, yet making clear its position on Haile Selassie's legacy. 
In town for an international con­ference on Ethiopian studies, she said she felt she had "really observed a moment in his\ory." 
Although many people too young to have lived through them express nostalgia for the days of the last emperor "when life was orderly and prices didn't rise all the time," in the words of 21-year-old student Addesalem Tesfaye; there is little sense here of a serious movement to reinstate the monarchy. 
"We want to rehabilitate his name, but not only his name, that of Ethiopia as well, and our own histo­ry," said Wolde-Semait Gebre-Wold, who was a senior official under the emperor and an organizer of the funeral. 


ISRAEL 

Two Palestinians shot in Gaza Strip 
Associated. Press 
JERUSALEM 
Scattered clashes Sunday across the Gaza Strip and West Bank left two Palestinians dead, 17 injured and tensions high despite a truce agreement and plans for upcoming meetings in Washington. 
President Clinton, who has been trying restore calm to the region, will play host to Palestinian leader Vasser Arafat on Thursday, and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak three days later, on Nov. 12, the White House said Sunday, 
Both Palestinians killed Sunday were shot dead. in the Gaza Strip. One was Maher Mouhmad Alsaidi, a 16-year-old boy hit in the head during a con­frontation near the Al Bureij refugee camp, according to Shifa hospital director Mouawia Hassanian. 
At least 10 Palestinians were wounded in Gaza, and seven were hurt in the West Bank in a clash out­side Bethlehem, to the south of Jerusalem, according to Palestinian security forces. 
In the West Bank, two Jewish settlers, a man and a woman, were wounded when Palestinian assailants ambushed their car and opened fire, set­tler spokesmen said. The military command con­firmed the shooting inci­dent. 

In a plea for peace, tens of thousands of Israelis filled a Tel Aviv square on Saturday night to pay trib­ute to former prime minis­ter Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated at the site five years ago by an ultranationalist Israeli opposed to trading land for peace with the Palestinians. 
The current violence has hardened attitudes on both sides and put seven years of peace negotia­tions on hold. Many dovish Israelis, including some of those at the rally, said their faith in the peace process has been shaken. Many Palestinians, mean­while, said they have little to show for the lengthy negotiations. 
Barak on Sunday told his Cabinet that the large turnout was "an impres­sive and emotional demonstration" of the Israeli commitment to peace. 
"It's unfortunate that on the other side such a demonstration of the peace process could not occur," he said in a refer­ence to the Palestinians. 
8OSNIA~HERZEGOVINA 

41 Muslim villagers finally laid to rest 
Associated .Press 
NOVOSEOCI 
Forty-one Muslims came home Sunday to this hamlet now settled by Serbs, and they were buried by dis­placed and dispersed families who had spent eight years praying they might still be alive. 
It was yet another Bosnian drama, a vignet'te of life in a patchwork country that cannot find peace five years after the Dayton accords ended its war. 
Novoseoci died on Sept. 22, 1992, when Serb units assembled the small farming population in front of the mosque. Forty-five males were marched away. Damir Ocuz. at 14. was the youngest. Edhem Karie was 
85. Everyone else fled. 
Until September of this year, sur­vivors could only guess that their worst fears were true. Eventually, a dying Serb with a bad conscience told authorities what many people had suspected. Crews went to work at Ivan Polje, three miles from here. 
"We had to move tons of garbage and also 15-ton chunks of the mosque the Serbs destroyed before we uncovered the mass grave," said Amor Masovic, head of the Bosnian missing persons agency. "First we located a thigh bone. Then, all the rest." 

Four of the missing were not found. 
Masovic said Serbs had smashed the bodies together with a bulldozer, creating a nightmare puzzle for forensic experts who sought to iden­tify the remains. When initial work was completed. family members were asked for confirmation.

Modern examples of corpo­rate welfare include grants from the federal government to pharmaceutical companies to develop new drugs, only to gouge the taxpayers who fund­ed the research when they pur­chase the medicine. Nader also cited the sale of national lands containing valuable gold and silver to foreign interests and excessive military spending as among the abuses of taxpayer money by corporations.

Nader: DC is 'effectively a colony' Election 
Bush cares only for the 

By ANNE-MARIE MATTINGLY News Editor 
WASHINGTON, DC 

The failure to provide Americans residing in the District of Columbia with a voting Congressional repre­sentative is to treat them as second-class citizens. said Green Party presidential can­didate Ralph Nader Sunday. 
Nader gathered with DC Statehood Green Party candi­dates to call for change for DC's residents, claiming that the disparity between the rights of the citizens of states and those of the district con­tradicts the principles of democracy. 
"The district is supposed to be the symbol of the freedoms for which this nation stands. The light of democracy is sup­posed to shine from the District of Columbia, but it does not illuminate this city," Nader said, 
"The core is hollow. The val­ues of equality and political participation that the city is promised are denied right here in our nation's capitol." 
Because the district does not have the full powers of a state, members of Congress are responsible for approving its budget and have the power to overturn any action of the city's government, Nader explained. 
Because district residents 

have no voting Congressional 
representative, the have no 
say in how the $2 billion they 
pay in federal income taxes 
each year is spent. 
"The District of Columbia is effectively a colony. with all local decisions directly subject to change by a Congress that is largely out of touch with local realities," said Nader. 
"The United States is the only democracy in the entire world that deprives the resi­dents of its capitol city the basic rights granted to all other citizens." 
Unaccountable power such as that Congress has over the District of Columbia necessari­ly results in uninformed deci­sions leading to a dysfunction­al system. said Nader. 
The city has an infant them from Congressional con­trol, said Nader. Republican presidential candidate George 
W. Bush does not support statehood for the district and Democratic candidate Al Gore, who supported statehood ten years ago, has been silent on the issue since that time, he explained, 
Instead, district residents who seek their full democratic rights must depend on minor parties Jike the Green party for support. 
Nader pledged that he and running mate Winona LaDuke would focus on statehood for the district so that Congress

Unchecked power also results in apathy among citi­zens for their government, Nader explained. 
"It chokes the ability and destroys the responsibility of, people to govern themselves. There's no place in the world where second-class citizens live side by side with first­class citizens and fare as well. It just doesn't happen," he said.

vania before the election, but was also going to Florida before voters render their decision. 
Most national polls give a slight edge to Bush. but Gore is running strong in some big battleground states and the two are often crossing paths contesting the same states. 
Pennsylvania and Michigan are key to Gore's hopes, while he hopes to steal an unexpect­ed victory in Florida that would be· a body blow to Bush's hopes by grabbing that state's 25 electoral votes. 
There was little subtlety in the campaign's close. Bush was making his core argument that voters are ready for a change after eight years of controversy under President Clinton, whifo Gore was saying the administration has gotten the economy perking and vot­ers should keep the prosperity going. 
Under those themes, Bush 
contrasts

Both also claimed backing from unlikely quarters. Bush pointed to a sign declaring a Democrat to be backing Bush. "You're not alone, buddy," Bush chortled. 
"I saw a sign over there that said 'Republicans for Gore' and I appreciate that," said Gore. 
Gore warned that middle­class families have the biggest stake in this year's election. 
"My friends, we need to respond to the needs of work­ing families," said Gore. "I will be a president for the working people." 
Both were preparing to head home to await the verdict from voters. Bush plans to watch returns in Austin, Texas, while Gore heads to Nashville to await the outcome of this year's marathon presidential campaign.

The evening news in Russia is eye­opening these days. Every week on M1 a small television station out of Moscow, young women deliver newscasts while either undressing, being undressed by others or already naked. The pro­
Scott Blaszak
gram is "The Naked 
Truth," and every 
Saturday viewers 
The Early 
tune in to watch 
Hussian Party boss­Essays 
es and members of 
Parliament inter­
viewed by professional, attractive, naked 
reporters. It's great television, as the 
uncomfortable interviewees try their 
damnedest to look anywhere but at the 
pretty Hussian girl with the microphone. 
Sex sells, and the ratings reflect it, but don't mistake "The Naked Truth" for simple exploitation. Women like Svetlana Pecotska, the Ukrainian actress turned anchor. aren't being exploited -they're in on the joke. And "The Naked Truth" is social satire of the best kind because it's indecipherable. So what's it satirizing'? The news, according to Sergei Moskvin, the creator of the program. Listen to just the audio, and the program comes oIT as straight and dry as any news broadcast. Watch just the visual, and you've got absurd pornography. 
The message, Mr. Moskvin explains, is that the news should not be taken so seriously. "The Naked Truth" is, accord­ing to him, an attack on pompous, ego­centric television news reporters. What Mr Moskvin is asking is, I think, why has journalism become entertainment'? Sounds to me like a message as relevant here in America as in Eastern Europe. 
These days, "Sports Center" broad­casts resemble stand-up comedy rou­tines, as each anchor's catch phrases and shtick obscure the simple details of the games themselves. Anchor Stuart Scott describes athletes performing well as "straight butter" and "as cool as the other side of the pillow." Over a home run highlight, Kenny Mayne imperson­ates the batter, shouting, "I am king of the diamond. Let there be a grand club­house feast. Bring me the finest meats 
and cheeses throughout the land." 
Instead of converting anchors to enter­
tainers, though, why not just put enter­
tainers behind the desk? Monday Night 
Football has, by tossing Dennis Miller a 
headset and hoping that his erudite allu­
sions boost sluggish ratings of the last 
few years. Football fans are left scratch­
ing their heads and reaching for encyclo­
pedias -who is Sylvia Plath and what is 
her relevance to New England's kicking 
game'? Try as he might, Miller can't help 
but become the focus of attention. And 
it's this approach that has become so 
prevalent in journalism these days. 
Everyone's a star, from your local tele­vision news anchor to investigative reporters. It's no longer about the story. It's about who's telling it to you. who got the exclusive, who broke the story first. Of course, the truly journalistic response to these ideas is, who cares'? Just give us the news. But with ratings and advertis­ing wielding so much power in reporting these days, credibility and responsibility are often jettisoned for pizzazz. 
Take ABC News, for example, which proclaims itself "America's Number One News Source." When "America's Number One News Source" granted Monica Lewinski the international broadcast rights for her interview with Barbara Walters (netting Lewinski a cool million). it was an embarrassing bench­mark for major network news coverage. 
Just last year, ABC News faced even more chagrin when it's Earth Day inter­view of President Clinton by Leonardo DiCaprio miscarried -Leo froze in front of the Commander-in-Chief, responding, "Wow," to the president's explanation of how the White House had become more energy efficient. ABC has been castigated ever since for the incident, but really it's just one of many instances of the major networks turning the spotlight onto themselves. 
Yet, the major networks avoid the dis­cussion of themselves as a business. With the entire business world seemingly about to merge into four monster compa­nies, rarely do the major news organiza­tions acknowledge the effect these merg­ers -often involving themselves -have on their reporting. NBC is now owned by Microsoft. Think that doesn't affect their coverage of the anti-trust trial'? You're hard pressed to ever hear anything posi­tive about the Fighting Irish on ESPN because ESPN is owned by Disney, who owns ABC, whose Saturday regional col­lege football programming competes directly with NBC's exclusive contract with Notre Dame. Profit margins, ratings and business mergers shape the news of the 21st Century. 

So what will it come down to, Dan Rather opening the "CBS Evening News" buck-naked? Most likely no. but I don't think the ridicule of Mr. Moskvin 's nude news is lost on American journalism. The line separating journalism and entertain­ment has blurred. Since sex and violence define entertainment, it follows that jour­nalism turn sexy and violcmt. And it has. Still, we don't have to watch it. and undoubtedly audiences are partly to blame for favoring irresponsible news coverage. Credible news reporting exislc; in this day and age. It's on CBS and it's called 60 Minutes and it's full of' integri­ty, but I don't know anyone under 40 who watches it anymore. 
Mr. Moskvin, on the other hand, now there's a man in tune with what the pub­lic wants to see. Building on the popular­ity of' "The Naked Truth," he's got a new talk show in the works that will resemble "Larry King Live" and star the newly-dis­covered John dePalrna. Each week, dePalma will instigate thoughtl'ul dia­logue about such topics as politics, love and western philosophy with famous, reputable guests. Is Mr. Moskvin aban­doning his satirical bent and trying his hand at straight news'? Not so much. John dePalrna is a chimpanzee.

Pyros and Weasels share a spirited rivalry 
By KATIE MALMQUIST Scene Writer 
The energy generated by the rivalry between the Pasquerillas might be enough to light Mod Quad for a week. Many students claim to have witnessed the surge of that competi­tive impulse, drawing lines of separation between the two women's dorms. 
"You won't see many people walking along the walkway that separates Pasquerilla East from Pasquerilla West," said Andrea Gonzalez, a senior resident assistant in PW. 
Of course sharing a name, a distinct location on campus and a history would naturally feed the fire between these two dorms as each vies for its own identity. Still a closer look reveals that both the Pasquerillas have a lot to distinguish themselves and a lot to be proud of. 
Pasquerilla West 
Pasquerilla West, along with Pasquerilla East, was founded in 1981 with the generous help of Frank and Sylvia Pasquerilla, residents of Johnston, Penn. Both dorms have remained women's resi­everyone loves it here. We're dences since that year.

Like the women of PW, the Pyros are well aware of their distance from campus, but they aren't too concerned. 
"We're a little removed from the action ... we don't get to hear the band on Saturday morn­ings" said Villaruz. "but at the same time, we're air conditioned." Seems like a small price to pay. 
Still. PE's location puts no barriers on their strong service commit­ments. Every year they make sack lunches for the homeless during the first six weeks of fall semester, and they take up a weekly donation after mass to help sup­port PE graduates who are out there somewhere doing service work. 
"We have really active service commissioners this year," said Fischer. "They try to get us all involved in a lot of activi­ties." 
Outside of these service activities, however, the Pyros spread their flames across campus with many dorm-wide activities that let off steam. 
"The football team is usually a big thing," said Fischer, who mentioned that PE could boast three 

trips to the finals in the stadium 
in the past four years. Pyromania Week takes place every fall the week before the all hall dance and includes activi­ties like assassins, ice skating, and social mixers between the women of PE and their dates. The dance culminates the week of celebration. and this year's theme of "Heaven and 
the week, the Weasel with the most points is crowned queen at the dance. 
"Queen Week is a time for people to just take a break, enjoy themselves and get spirit­ed about the dance," said Kelly. 
Other dorm-wide events include multiple barbecues, one held in the fall, another in February and always one on the last day of classes. 
Football is also very impor­tant to P.W. residents. 
"There is a lot of passion about our football team here in PW," said Bruno. 
According to freshman quar­ter-back, Leslie Schmidt, "We had a really great season ,,. [though we wereJ upset that it's been cut shorter than usual." 
Though P.W. will be losing some key players this year, they are confident that inner-hall football will remain an impor­tant part of their dorm experi­ence. 
Perhaps the most unique way the Weasels let loose is their annual skydiving trip. Every spring a group of 15-25 girls heads out for a day of tandem skydiving, 
"For a lot of girls it's their first jump, but they keep coming back every year," said senior 
R.A. Andrea Conzalez, who felt that it was a very important bonding experience for the ,vomen of PW. 
And what about their claim that "West is best'"? 
"We do have a fun-loving rivalry with PE," said Bruno, "but we really do respect each other." 
Pasquerilla East 
The Pasq uerilla East Pyros may share a name with P.W., but they do a good job of distin­guishing themse-lves from their twin dorm. 
They were also founded in 1981, ·with the help Frank and Sylvia Pasquerilla, and they too find themselves set off in Mod Quad. But ultimately, they feel their level of spirit and devotion of hospitality separates them and sets them a notch above PW.

EVANSTON, Ill. 
The victory at Wisconsin came when the Badgers were short-handed. Michigan State? Turns out, the Spartans weren't all that good. And ral­lying to beat Minnesota? llardly a Big Ten powerhouse. 
For all those who doubted No. 12 Northwestern -and yes, there were plenty of you -this one's for you. 
Just try to play down this victory. a 54-51 shootout over Michigan on Saturday. That'd be the same Michigan with the storied tradition, the winged helmets and the 11 national titles. 
"WOOO-YEAJI!" linebacker Kevin Bentley screamed as students flooded the field after the game and tried to bring down the north goal post. "It's great!'' 
Northwestern (7-2, 5-1 Big Ten) jumped nine spots in the poll to No. 12 with the victory. while Michigan (6-3. 4-2) dropped eight spots to No. 20. 
"Because of our history, they really see us as a novelty. We feel like everybody's just waiting for us to lose,", Northwestern running back Damien Anderson said earlier in the week. 
That's why beating Michigan was oh, so sweet. A perennial powerhouse, Michigan leads the conference with 39 Big Ten titles. Since 1966, Northwestern had managed to beat the Wolverines just twice. 
But this was no fluke. 
Michigan. They scored on 10 of their 14 possessions. 
"I thought they would score, coming into the game," Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said. "But I saw them almost scoring at will." 
Equally stunning was Northwestern's balance. The Wildcats rushed for 332 yards and passed for 322. Anderson had 268 yards and two touch­downs on 31 carries, the sec­on d-h ig hcst outing of his career. 
Kustok passed for two touchdowns and ran for two more. Simmons caught 12 passes for 124 yards. 
Michigan put up some gaudy numbers of its own, gaining 535 yards on 81 plays. Anthony Thomas ran for 199 yards and three scores. and David Terrel! caught nine passes for 117 yards and three TDs. 
Drew Henson was 23-of-35 for 312 yards. Marquise Walker caught nine passes for 134 yards. 
"To play that well offensive­ly and not win it is disappoint­ing," Carr said. "Especially with the championship on the line." 
Michigan scored on its first four possessions as it jumped out to a 28-10 lead. But Northwestern quickly rallied, scoring on seven straight pos­sessions to take a 46-45 lead on Tim Long's 41-yard field goal with 12: 30 left in the game. 
That's when things really 
Simmons leaped high in the air after he caught the pass. almost looking like he was going to dunk the ball through the goal posts. and the first sellout crowd at Ryan Field since 1998 went into a frenzy. 
As time expired, the fans poured onto the field, sur­rounding the players in the north end zone. 


attempt failed and Michigan was left to sit on a 51-46 lead with 8:34 still to play. 
The Wildcats gave the Wolverines a scare with 1 :38 left, but Anderson dropped a sure 12-yard touchdown pass when he lost the ball in the lights at the goal line. 
"I felt the game was won," Terrell said.

WOMEN'S INTERHALL PLAYOFFS 
Whirlwinds wipe out Wild Wolllen, Ducks defeat CriIDe 
By IAUREN CONTI and SUSAN CARPENTER 
Sports Writers 
The Welsh Whirlwinds contin­ued their undefeated season on Sunday, beating thr Walsh Wild Women 16-0 in the semifinal round of the women's interhall playoffs. 
The decisive shutout. however, simply wasn't enough for the title-hungry No. 1 seeded Whirlwinds. 
"We could have played a lot better," said coach Casey Bouton. "We didn't execute as well as we have in the past." 
The Wild Women managed to throw off the Welsh defensr early in the game with a new and unusual offensive formation. 
"It wasn't like anything we've ever played against before," said Welsh captain Maria Feilmeyer. "And we had a couple of mis­takes because of it. But our defense caught on pretty quick after that." 
Walsh stuck with its character­isticallv strong defense. however, despite missing senior safety and punter Courtney Schaefer. 
"I think [the defense] played solid. but I'd say we were affect­ed by the fact that Courtney was out of town. She's a really experi­enced player," said sophomore substitute punter Karina Mayorga. 
The Wild Women still managed to hold the game scoreless until late in the second half. largely due to lineman Angela Polsinelli, who batted down a Rak pass and had several key tackles. 
"Walsh had a really good defensive line today, especially Polsinelli," Bouton said. 
Though Welsh may have taken a little while to gather its off en ­sive momentum, by its second possession, they were mo,ing the ball effectively with nearly every pass. With 1:25 remaining in the half, a 15-yard pass by Rak con­nectrd with running back .Jen Grubb, who ran it in to put Welsh up on the board. The Whirlwinds successfully completed the ensu­ing two-point conversion to bring the score to 8-0. 
Despite keeping up the solid defensive play throughout the second half. the Wild Women were unable to stop the Whirlwinds. and couldn't seem to move the ball comparatively on offense. 
Walsh seemed to be on the move when Alison Troy inter­cepted a Rak pass and ran it up to Walsh's 20-yard line. 
"We'd been saying all day long that we needed to get a turnover," said Melissa Beiting, Walsh captain. "Our safety and our corners were right there the whole game. we just needed to get a hand on it. Alison really stepped up." 
Walsh then passed to receiver Kay Scanlan. who broke away for a 60-yard run that brought the ball up to about one foot from goal. The Wild Women were unable to capitalize. however, as Welsh's defense thwarted attempt after attempt to score. Finally, an interception by Welsh's Colleen O'Connor ended the Wild Women's chances at a touchdown. 
"They were just a better team than us today," said Walsh of the game. 
Howard 25, Off-Campus 0 
The underdog triumphe~ again Sunday as Howard defeated Off­Campus 25-0. 
The Oucks' offense led by quar­terback Jill Veselik, dominated throughout the game. getting the ball in the end zone by capitaliz­ing on turnovers and excellent field position. On the second drive of the game, after an inter­ception by Jill Harris, Veselik elected to hold on to the football and run in for a touchdown to put her team up first. 
Elizabeth Klimcck nabbed a pass for an interception to set her team up for their next touch­down. Ten yards out, the Crime's aggressive defense looked as though they were going to drop Veselik for a huge loss in yardage. The athletic Veselik evaded their tackles and connect­ed with receiver Vanessa Nero to add another six points. The pass for the extra point was tipped off of the fingers of one Duck receiv­er and into the hands of Elizabeth Klimek to put Howard up 13-0 at halftime. 
In the second, Off-Campus began their series deep in their own territory. Jill Harris grabbed her second interception of the day and ran back from the five­yard line for the touchdown. 
The Howard defense shut down the Off-Campus offense time and again, while the Duck otfonse amassed 25 unanswered points. Howard coach Paul Guzzetta credited quarterback Jill Veselik for leading their team to the win. 


"She's tough as nails," Guzzetta said. "She came out and had an excellent game." 
With three interceptions, the defense was a powerful force to be reckoned with. "The defense came up huge today," said coach Brad Untiedt. "They came up with big plays that gave us the momentum." 
"It was a whole team effort on both sides of the ball," Veselik said. 

For next week's game, she said that they are going to continue to practice hard, but they are not going to change their general strategy. 
"[We are going to] go with what works." she said. 
Off-Campus coach Paul Diamantopoulos summed up the game as "the first time all season when the ball didn't go our way." 
Coach Dan Laughlin agreed. 
"They [Howard] played a good game," he said. "The ball bounced their way."

Knott knocks Sorin out of playoffs 6-0 

By JOHNNY LEITNER 
Sports Writer 
When Knott and Sorin met in last year's interhall foot­ball championship game, their combined offenses scored 30 points. In Sunday's rematch, they racked up a grand total of six. However, the end result was the same ­the Juggs of Knott Hall tri­umphed 6-0 in a hotly con­tested affair. 
Both teams felt that the game was an intense and hard-hitting affair. 
"We expected a battle ­and we were evenly matched," said Sorin captain Mike Crowe. "The small things made the difference." 
Knott captain Pat Virtue 


agreed. 
"It was low-scoring like a lot of playoff g a m e s between two tough teams," he said. 
The first half was char­acterized by turnovers and penalties . After the numerous posession changes. the half ended with no touch­

0. 
Crowe saw the defensive performances and turnovers as the crucial aspects of the 
game. 
"The defense really stepped it up and gave us some good opportunities -we just didn't make them count," he said. 
Sorin 's offense took the field with five minutes remaining, but was stymied by a Knott defense that could sense a sixth consecutive shutout in the making. 
Knott regained possession. On their first play from scrim­mage, Otter defender Jim Vavricek sustained a poten­tially serious injury to the neck. Action shifted to a nearby field while Vavricek awaited an ambulance. Vavricek was taken to the emergency room at St.

"In a game like this -it was hard to keep momentum going," Crowe said. 
Strong defensive play by both teams resumed in the second half. Again, turnovers were common in the second half and Sorin had a key fumble at the outset of the fourth quarter. 
Knott maintained posses­sion thanks to a fumble recovery by Ro-Jand Newrones and moved 25 yards en route to a one-yard touchdown gal­lop by John Bisanz. A missed extra point left the score at 6­

"We were able to capitalize off good field position, and our defense stood its ground and played great -especially in pass coverage." 
Virtue thought that the key performers for the Juggs were the offensive linemen, who performed well after a tough game against Zahm, and John Bisanz, who played for Virtue after he twisted his ankle. 
"John is a great athlete and scored our only touchdown," said Virtue, who added that his ankle would be fine for the upcoming championship

Sorin will lose Crowe to graduation this year, as well as coach Fred Faber. 
"Fred has been the back­bone and brains of this team, and we have to give him a -lot of credit," said Crowe, who mentioned that Faber was unable to be on the field this year due to previous injuries. "He's been responsi­ble for success­fully preparing us -I think of him as being a player-coach." 
"Our overall team effort was very good, and we've had a good season," added Crowe.

"We never got too down on ourselves after the fumble," said Keenan captain Herb Giorgio. "But it did force us into overtime where we were concerned about containing them from the 10­yard line." 
Giorgio's defense did hold on to give him the opportunity to win the game in the second over­time, after missing a 19-yard attempt in the first overtime. This time, he put the 38-yard kick through the uprights. 
"After that first kick [missed] my heart just dropped," said Groebner. "I didn't know what to think. I just had to get ready to play defense. I didn't know if I would get another shot. There was a lot of pressure because it means so much to the guys on the team. I am just glad I was able to make it the second time." 
After the winning kick, the would-be goat became the hero and Keenan had its ticket to Notre Dame Stadium and the interhall championship game.

Irish sweep weekend matches, rise to 21-5 on season 
By RACHAEL PROTZMAN 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame volleyball earned its 21st win of the sea­son and 10th conference vic­tory following this weekend's games over 
Boston College, N o r t h Carolina a n d Providence. 
"This was an impor­tant week 

for us to Girton 
g a i n momentum going into the end of the sea­son. We showed some pretty solid play throughout the weekend, in all the matches," 
said sophomore Keara Coughlin. "Our ball control was consistently good throughout the weekend. It was a very positive weekend." 
The frish topped Boston College f'riday in a three­game match. 
"Everyone on the team par­ticipated in the win over Boston College,'' Coughlin said. 
The Irish swept the Tarheels in three games (15-6, 15-13, 15-4). Notre Dame jumped into the match to grab an 11-1 lead in game one before allowing the Tarheels an opportunity to catch up. North Carolina struck back harder in game two, tying the game

When she entered the game early in the second half. the 5-foot-9 Joyce show·ed she could be a key replacement for Danielle Green, last year's starting shooting guard.
