WASIIINGTON (UI'l) President Nixon proposed a hroad reform of the draft yesterday calling for a lottery system of selection which would make the youngest men most vulnerable. 
Under his plan. their maximum vulnerability to the draft would last for one year only between age 19-20 -rather than for the seven years, from agt• 19 26, during which the draft hangs over the ht•ads of eligible youths today. 
In a special mess<.~ge to Congress, Nixon put aside until "more stahle world conditions" prevail his campaign pledge for replacing the draft with an all volunteer army. In the meantime, he said, "we must do everything we can to limit the disruption caused by the system and to make it as fair as possible." At the core of the President's proposal is a system of random selection so that chance

McKeithen moved after students set fire to a big construction company truck on the campus, tried to keep firemen from putting out the flames, and were repulsed by st<Jtc police who fired tear gas at the unruly crowd. 
The students threw up barricades and built bonfires on the streets in the second consecutive day of unrest on the campus. One student was arrested for throwing a fire bomb at a state trooper.

Tower heads plan 
Sunday night, the first step was taken toward the formation of the hall govern mcnt for towers f\ and B. Both towers will be considered one hall, with 
one rector. 
Under the chairmanship of Paul Dillenhcrger, three commit­tees were set up. A constitu­tiona! COPlmittee, which has the responsibility of setting up a constitution by which to govern the hall; a judicial committee, which has to set up a working judicial system; and an orienta­tion committee. which is to handle the hall life orientation of incoming freshmen. The first two committees' tasks are dir­
ectly concerned with  the estab­ 
lishmcnt  of  parietal  hours  for  
the hall.  

After agreeing to set up the three com mittccs, various things were discussed. Among them was the source of income which the hall must develop, in order to sponsor parties, and other events. Here a problem arose 
because, while other halls derive a large part of their income from food sales, the new dorms have 
food machines owned by the university. 
When asked if the university could be persuaded to give the hall part of the funds from the machines, Dillenbcrger said "I seriously doubt it." 
The idea of a hall tax was 
discussed, with a majority of the memhers in favor of some kind of fcc charged in order to raise funds. 
The meeting broke down into three groups, comprising of those who joined the individual committees, Chairmen and dates for meeting were decided upon during this week. 
Dillenberger said, "The chair­men will be ultimately respon­sible for the work that his com­
expected to remain in contact 

with committeemen during the 
summer." 
Yesterday, darifications of the campus-wide rennovation program were released. Work will begin on the thirteen dorms no later than the end of the summer school session (August). Some of the remodelling might even begin while summer school is still in progress. 
The four-man suites will be furnished with three easy chairs and two lamps besides the usual furniture supplied. 
Next year there will be 5,264 on-campus students.
