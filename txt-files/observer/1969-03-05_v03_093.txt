Freedoms Foundation winner speaks of patriotism 
BY Ted Price Campus Editor. 

The man who was probably the first to be called "Black Panther" didn't earn the name for a militant political outlook. He won it for militantly piloting his F-80 during the Korean War and being one of the few Black fighter pilots in the Air Force at the time. Black power came to the fore again in Vietnam in 1967 as a member of the famed "Wolfpack" of the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing which holds the record for the most aircraft shot down during a single day hy a single unit. 
But for Col. Daniel "Chappie" James, it wasn't always easy being a Negro in the Air Force. A 1942 graduate of Tuskegee 
Institute, his first assignment was to the James said that enemies of the US get 332nd Composite Group under Col. (later the wrong impression of American youth Gen.) Benjamin 0. Davis. when they see news reports of demon­

"This is our nation, a great nation, a nation of laws," he said. ',We owe a debt to her to preserve and to better her. The Black people of the United States have gained and ~ill continue to gain, by the grace of God, but only through real Americanism, which seeks advancement in the proper manner." 

RMN press conference reviews European trip 
(UP() President Nixon said yesterday that he h~liev~s the Soviet Union wants to keep thl' West Berlin situation from heat­ing up to avoid j~apardizing high lev~l nl·gotiations "in th~ wings" between Russia and the United Stall'S. 
Speaking at a nationally broadc<tst White llous~ nl~Ws conference on the CVl' of the disputed West (;erman election of a federul president in West Berlin, the President said "The situation seems to ltaVl' lcvekd off" recently. 
lie said Ill' ami Secretary of Stutc William P. Rogers had told Soviet i\ mhassador Anatoly F. Dohrynin that any communist harassment in West Berlin "could jeopardize the progress that we sec in other areas." 
He added: "At this time, I believe that the Soviet Union docs not want the situation heated up to jeopardize more important negotiations with the United States." 
Reporting to the nation on his eight day tour of Western Europe, from which he returned to Washington Sunday night, the President said his discussions in five Allied capitals was a prelude to an East-West summit meeting "at a later date" not yet decid­ed. 
Nixon said that the United States had been carefully asses­sing the communist offensive in Vietna rn hut that it had not yet decided on its response. 
Noting that the United States had not thus far taken "precipi­tous action," Nixon warned the communists that this restraint should not he taken as a sign of weakness. 
"We will not tolerate a viola­tion of the understanding" bet ween the United States and North Vietnam which led to the bombing halt last Nov. I, Presi­dent Nixon said. 
Nixon noted that in recent attacks the American casualty rate had doubled, and he stres­sed that this factor reinforced the U.S. determination to deliver what he described only as "an appropriate response" at a time of its choosing. 
However, Nixon d~clared that tin· communist offensive "has failed." 
As for his European trip, the President said it helped l'stablish "a new relationship of trust and 
confidence" between the United Stat~s and the continent.

attention," he said, "should be the center of our concern, should not be taken for grantl'd. It will not he." 
He said he found Europeans "highly sensitive" about the possibility of a U.S.-Soviet dom­inance of world affairs in which the two great powers make bilat­eral decisions affecting other countries without consulting them. 
The President said he inten­
ded to establish close tics with 
the Vatican in Rome but he has 
not yet decided whether to send 
an ambassador to the Roman 
Catholic city state. 
He said he and State Depart­
ment advisers intended to have 
the very closest consultation and 
discussion with the Vatican." 
Nixon said he would an­nounce the first of next week his decision on whether to go ahead with construction of Antibal­listic Missile ABM system for defense of U.S. cities against attack by intercontinental mis­siles. 
Asked about the chances for West German ratification of the ban of spreading nuclear weap­ons between nations, Nixon said he felt the Germans would even­tually approve the controls. 
He said particularly that U.S. relations with France arc "dif­fcrcnt and improved" as a result of the trip and that President Charles de Gaulle had offered his cooperation in finding solutions to troublesome world problems.

Despite this indica­ting fact, infirmary officials were unable to single out the SOH as the initiator of the trouble, and added that other causes such as spoiled food from vending mach­ines or intestinal flu might have caused the illness. 
B. Mehall, Director of Food Service, commented that although those students affected were from the SDH, there is a wide variety of meals to which individual victims would put the blame. He emphasized that some of those complaining had only

Another,  more  likely,  abuse  would  be for  the  status  quo  to  

continue, that is, for students to continue bringing, or overlook the bringing in of, girls whenever they feel like it. The SLC did not pass a limited number of hours as a first step to something broader; it passed limited hours because it thought limited hours best, and expects them to be observed. Non-observance could lead to a switch of votes when the bill is , evicwcd at the end of this year, after the experimental time period. 
The whole situation will be to a great extent a test of student responsibility, an idea which has suffered grievous blows this year, especially at the hands of the Honor Council action. Many people have faith in the students, but most have a certain amount of doubt mingled with that faith. The experimental period, though it may seem like sugar-coating, may play a very important part in shaping attitudes toward student responsibility in all segments of the campus.

Freshman quartet helps track cause 
By MIKE PAVLIN 
Observer Sports Writer 
Adding to the buoyancy of Coach Alex Wilson's track fortunes this winter have been the performances of a handful of outstanding freshmen. Elio l'olsclli has come down from Windsor, Ontario to become ND's top man in the shot put. In the Central Collegiate Conference Meet, he provided a pair of fifth-place finishes in the Shot and 35-l'ound Weight Throw.

Irish grappler Jim Hansen was an 8-1 victor last night in the 152-pound class. 
Best ND grapplers 
go 8-2-1 
The Notre Dame grapplers mowed down Wheaton (Ill.) Col­lege 23·6 last night in the Convo for the finest record in their 13-year history. The Irish finished the dual-meet season 8-2, a win percentage of .800. Coach Tom Fallon's charges also took first place in the six-team Rochester Tech Tournament. 
Tom Ciacco began the Irish romp with a crushing 15-1 decision in the 123 lh. class. The next four categories also fell to Notre Dame, including a pin by Ken Ryan at 145 lob., giving the Irish an almost insurmountable 17-0 lead.

specialty, then placed sewnd in 
the Mile Run in last Saturday's 
meet against Miami of Ohio. 
Two more frosh making big 

noise arc the "Mutt and Jeff" 
team of Mike McMannon and 
Kevin McAuliffe in the jumping 
events. McMannon, who comes 
from II ighland Heights, Ky. 
(about 20 miles south of 
Covington), stands 6-7 hut 
weighs in at only 165 poinds. In 
fact, if he and Boh Whitmore 
shook hands, they'd he a 
goa I post. 
But Mike has used his long 

stride and excellent speed well 
enough to become the top ND 
jumper, with two records 
a lre;1dy to his credit. Last 
Saturday, he long-jumped 24-1 
for a new indoor record to go 
along with his 49-5Y2 triple jump 
mark, established earlier against 
Indiana. 
McMannon's chief 

competition on the Irish squad 
comes from McAuliffe, who is 
5-7 and 140 pounds. Kevin, 
hometown: Syracuse NY, has 
been hampered this season by a 
hone bruise in his foot. 
Nevertheless, he camt on to 
place second to Mike in the 
Long Jump versus Miami. 
Both freshmen were high 

school standouts. Mikt set the 
Kentucky state Triple Jump 
record as a junior and won both 
jump events in the Mason-Dixon 
Games. He leaped 24-91/z (his 
career best) in the Long Jump at 
the Mansfield (Ohio) Invitational 
Meet in his senior year bcfofl~ 
suffering a pulled leg muscle. 
Kevin was the city champion in 
Syracuse in both events, with a 
21-9 long jump and a 46-4 triple 
jump to his credit. 
Several days ago, the jumpers 

sat in front of their lickcrs and 
engaged in some banter over 
their physical attributes. Mike 
admitted that his long legs gave 
him an advantage in reach, hut 
Kevin claimed his legs were 
stronger. '!I've pressed 
500-something pounds on the 
machine (special strength 
indicator) in the weight room." 
McMannon has used his height 
and long stride in other events. 
lie placed second in Saturday's 
High Jump and ran a leg on the 
victorious Mile-Relay team. In 
practice, he has turned out a 
49.2 quarter-mile. Kevin also ran the 440 in high school, in the respectable time of 52 seconds. 
To the Science major, who thinks "track meet" is something served at the North Dining Hall, the Long Jump looks absurdly simple. Run like hell and jump. But that's like saying that Austin Carr just picks up a basketball and heaves it. Factors such as speed, control, and lift arc important for a successful leap. "And you can't emphasize one over another", warns McMannon. "A perfect jump is the combination

Guard Tom Mt·Kinley signed with Montreal while tackle George Kunz was named to the 1968 Aca­demic All-America Team. 
of all these points, and a perfect jump is an accident." 
"We usually warm up about an hour before the meet," adds Kevin. "And lake three practice jumps plus 'run-throughs'. I take a jump with my sweats on, with the pants off, and finally with just my uniform on." A runner's "steps" can he thrown crucially off hy even the weight difference in the sweat clothes. 
The Triple Jump, or Hop, Skip and Jump, presents another problem. llere sheer speed is not necl~ssarily everything, rather a jumper must carry controlled momentum through two "one-footed" steps before taking-off on the final jump. Mike says he slows down slightly, while Kevin stays about the same. McAuliffe laughs, "But thl' Triple Jump usually follows the Long Jump so by that time you're so tired you run as hard as you can." 
To keep in shape, Kevin, Mike, and the other Irish jumpers must run daily on the troubll·some new track. They too have their complaints about blisters. For jumping purposes, however, they like the surface. "I think the runway is rather fast", says Mike, "Although it seems to be getting slower. I wonder of all those people walking over it (from Hockey games) has something to do with it." Kevin is also partial to the track if only because "in high school the best I did was 21-9. In my first meet here, I went 22-9. 
Interview over, both jumpers headed for the showers. They, along with PoiseIIi and Brady, are c x pcricncing thl~ heady feeling of coming in at the bottom and gravitating right to 
th<~ ton.

No boycotts, no strikes 
"(iod Bless Tommy Smith and John Carlos." "ND is the Epitome of Hypocricy. Be Christian." "Alumni, What Matters More? Football or the Moral Integrity of ND?" "Heshurgh of the Civil Rights Commission: Look in Your Own Backyard." 
And there was one more conspicuous sign at that black demonstration, preliminary to the Notre Damc-<;eorgia Tech football game last Nov. 16. It read. "Ara, the Day of the White Backfield is Past Ask Leroy. Ask O.J ." 
There is a strong feeling among black students that Irish football coaches intentionally keep blacks out of the offensive backfield and consequently, out of the spotlight. They cite the case of Larr; Schumacher, who was an offensive star in high school and returned a kickoff 83 yards for a touchdown against Michigan State as a freshmen, before being moved to defensive linebacker. Some blacks believe Ernie Jackson should havt' hcen ~iven an opportunity to play 

Larry Schumacher Austin Carr offensive halfback with the varsity. Four days after the Georgia Tech demonstration, Ara Parscghian labeled Negro sentiments "dissl'nt without havin~ all the facts." Ara told the Indianapolis Downtown Quarterback Club he would be delighted to have both Simpson and Keyes and all other capable Negro gridders. "Notrl' Dame has many more applications for admittance than it can accept," said Ara. "The combined qualifications for scholarship and athletic ability arc high. We do have five Negro hays on our freshman team. We had to go to five different states to get them." Less than a month later, Notre Dame's black athletes were newsmakcrs again. Arthur McFarland, president of the Afro-American Society, had presented a list of seven grievances to the University Oct. 3. Now it was Dec. 4 and McFarland was not pleased with the consideration his list had been given. He demanded a satisfactory response from the administration hy 5 pm Dec. 6. If none was forthcoming, he promised an expression of discontent Dec. 7 at the ND-UCLA basketball game. McFarland hinted it might be a student demonstration or a boycott hy the five Negro cagers. Since then, he says he has lcarnl·d the impossibility of a boycott. Enter Austin Carr, who, in this era of vanilla-flavored, straight-lace, down-the-middle quotes, is a refreshing interviewee. "I didn't know anything about a boycott until I read it in the OBSERVER," said Austin. "I've only been to one of those Afro-American Society meetings. I just don't have the time. I have practice every day and I'm hustin' my can just to make C's and stay eligible. "I couldn't boycott a game. They'd take my scholarship way and then what would I have'! I'd be out of school and maybe they wouldn't get their demands anyway. "I'm willing to help-the black cause as long as I don't hurt myself too much. I just have two more years (of college) to go and I'm not going to mess it up now," Austin concluded. Two events, occurring within a month of each other, made it obvious that Notre Dame's black student was powerless to do more than carry a sign. The Afro-American Society could not usc hlack athletes as a wedge to obtain concessions from the University. Furthermore, the possibility of a black athlete strike here (a Ia California, Wisconsin) was made remote hy the athletes, themsl'lvcs, when they pledged allegiance to their coaches. "We all respect Coach Dec," says Collis Jones. "Take the question of wearing 'naturals', for instance. He never said anything to us about it. But Wl' know how he feels so we keep it at a modcratl' length ·~ "Ara's a good head," says Tony Capers. "When I talk to him, it's man-to-man. He respects you."
