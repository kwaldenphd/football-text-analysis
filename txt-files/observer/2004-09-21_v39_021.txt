Owners put Turtle Creek up for sale 
Apartments billed at $12.25 million 
By KATE ANTONACCI News Writer 
Owners of Turtle Creek Apartments, the popular stu­dent off-campus housing area east of Notre Dame, have decid­ed to sell the complex, property manager Tammy Michelbrink said Monday. 
According to Michelbrink, Turtle Creek's owners are ask­ing $12.25 million for the prop­erty and have no specific rea­son for selling. The 192-unit housing complex is listed for sale by Los Angeles-based real estate firm CB Richard Ellis. 
Turtle Creek Apartments, 
which includes a swimming pool, sand volleyball cout, pic­nic areas, grills, clubhouse and a 24-hour laundry center, hous­es primarily Notre Dame stu­dents. The average size per unit is 865 square feet. 
Michelbrink said Turtle Creek would continue to operate nor­mally throughout the sale. 
"We have already begun the application and lease signing process for 2005-06," she said. "No matter who owns Turtle Creek it will always remain <1ne of the number one choices for students wanting to Jive off­campus."

Safe Bus plan met with concerns 
Funding, locations, NDSP involvement still up in the air 
By MARY KATE MALONE and 
AMANDA MICHAELS 
News Writers 
Members of the Council of Representatives voiced their con­stituencies' concerns about the proposed Notre Dame SafeBus at Monday's meeting. 
The SafeBus, part of student body president Adam Istvan's campaign platform, would serve as an alternative mode of trans­portation for students going to parties at off-campus residences or bars. 
Currently no concrete plans for how to implement the measure exist, as Istvan is still gauging student and administration feed­back. 
Though representatives report­ed positive responses to the idea, they brought up questions of funding, pick-up and drop-off locations and Notre Dame

panel in the first of many election season events spon­sored by the Center for Social Concerns and others. 
While all four professors highlighted the issue of the war in Iraq, each focused on a different area concerning the war. 
According to Lindley, one of the biggest security threats facing the United States is the problem of "loose nukes" in the former Soviet Union. 
"Facilities are largely unguarded," Lindley said. 
Prior to Sept. 11 and after, some analysts drew attention to the problem as a major security threat, but the cur­rent Bush administration has instead focused on the war in Iraq, according to Lindley. 
"Between a glass that's empty, cracked and broken, and a glass that's a quarter full, I'll choose the latter," he said. 
Ruccio focused on issues concerning economics, includ­ing international trade pacts and negotiations, immigration and energy concerns for America. 
"How do we manage our relations with oil-producing nations?" Ruccio said. 
Some oil-producing nations are those who harbor many terrorists and commit viola­tions of human rights that the United States must keep in

Legal downloading service not an option 
ND doesn't pursue music program 
By DAN TOLER News Writer 
To satisfy students' interest in music downloading, while avoiding clashes over illegal filesharing, many colleges ­including nearby Purdue University -are considering formal campus-wide pro­grams that would allow stu­dents to purchase songs legally. However, the University currently. has no plans to open a similar serv­ice, said Katie Christman, help desk manager at the Office of Information Technologies. 
Last year, the Office of Residence Life and Housing sent emails to specific stu­dents instructing them to remove downloaded music from their computers or face possible disciplinary action. This move came as a result of the lawsuit filed by the Recording Industry Association of America against students who were illegally downloading music at a variety of universities, including Notre Dame. 

"The OIT doesn't condone the use ·Of file-sharing pro­grams such as Kazaa," Chrisman said, but added that the University does not monitor student computers for file-sharing programs. Notre Dame will become involved only if contacted by the University's General Counsel, generally in the event of a lawsuit. 
Despite these actions, illegal file sharing and downloading at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's is still widespread. 
But at West Lafayette, stu­dents will soon be able to get their music legally. Purdue

Lacking the Irish luck 
Being a prestigious university. it is only natural that Notre Dame would provide us with a world renowned, state-of-the­art traffic force. Students should salute the Notre Dame Security/Police for their traffic patrol skills. Surrounded by the

patrolling our cam­
pus for unautho­
rized vehicles. Of course, the most suspi­
cious and dangerous automobiles are 
those owned and operated by the Notre 
Dame students, themselves. This deter­
mined. defensive squad, known as the 
NDSP, has therefore made it virtually 
impossible for students to get their cars 
on campus. 
Except for the lucky few who have 
green cards for swiping, all those wanting 
to gain access to campus roads must 
come face to face with th·e indomitable 
NDSP. These encounters are a certainty if 
one wants to avoid the excruciatingly, 
long walk from D6 or D2000. Depending 
on the day and the officer, some students 
may be lucky enough to have their vehi­
cle welcomed on campus. 
I applaud anyone who can devise an 
ingenious scheme to allow NDSP to per­
mit them on the streets of Notre Dame 
proper. Forget the practical reasons: car­
rying groceries, picking up a friend, being 
late for dass, walking alone in the dark or 
simply leaving something behind. Oh, and 
one might think that pouring rain, freez­
ing drizzle or a white-out would be an 
acceptable excuse. No Way! The NDSP 
assists in building our character by giving 
us the opportunity of trudging back to our 
donn, soaking wet or freezing cold. 
Be grateful that the Stephan Center 
parking lot is located extremely close to 
the infirmary. If you come down with 
pneumonia, need to get stitches or have 
to have a broken bone realigned, it's only 
a short stroll away. 
So what exactly docs it take to get on 
campus? Not even the "Luck of the Irish" 
will secure a spot for your car on campus! 
A classic excuse used to be, '1ust get­ting back from the airport with luggage." This worked for my entire sophomore year. Then, the technically advanced NDSP equipped its offiecrs with flash­lights. Now they simply request, "Pop open that trunk." Keep an empty piece of luggage in the trunk or backseat at all times. 
Last year, two boys wanted to pick up their friends to go to the movies. Before leaving their off-campus residence, they dL'>mantlcd their computer and placed it in the front seat of their car. Whether or not the NDSP believed their concocted story, the students were allowed access to the roads of Notre Dame. Only a Notre Dame student can fully appreciate the excitement that comes when a friend ealls to inform you, "''m on campus in front of your donn!" 
Unfortunately, Notre Dame students arc forced to continue to engage in cre­ative measures to get on campus. There is, however, one foolproof way. llave a parent in the car with you at all times. When mom or dad is sitting next to you, the NDSP welcome you on campus with a bright smile! Your parent smiles back, tells the officer to have a nice day, then turns to you and says, "Everyone is so friendly."

Students get shot glasses before homecoming 
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.­Officials at Rio Grande High School aren't ·getting a buzz from the school's homecoming memento. 
Nearly 100 shot glasses etched with "Dreams Will Come True 2004" were handed out in advance of the celebration last week -until the principal got word of it. 
"It's not an appropriate message to send out," Principal AI Sanchez said Thursday after putting a stop to the giveaway. "We'll never do that again." 

School activities director James Chavez took the blame -saying the cheap­est glass was a $1.32 shot glass. He said he thought they could be used to hold candles or toothpicks, not alcohol. 
"We emphasized this is not for drinking," Chavez said.

Pedro Garza, 19; Joshua Hackey, 19; and Nathaniel Hackey, 21; were arrested Saturday on felony charges of making and discharging a destructive device. The older Hackey is in the Army and his brother is in the Coast Guard, the Polk County Sheriff's Office said. 
"One of the guys said they got a bad milkshake, and they played a prank on them," sheriff's Maj. Sammy Taylor said.

Stnaller enrolltnent leads to shortfalls 
By KELLY MEEHAN 
News Writer 
Due to decreased enrollment at Saint Mary's, the Board of Governance will face a budget cut of roughly $9,000, students said at Monday's board meeting. Students spent the meeting reviewing and approving the budget. 
"This is the primary budget that we need to approve, and I will have Student Diversity Board, Residence Hall Association and individual class allotments next week," treasur­er Molly Welton said. 
Student Activities Commissioner Lauren Fabina told the board that next week is Saint Mary's Pride Week, and Pride Week T-shirts will be sold for $6 all week in front of Haggar Hall. 
Ticket vouchers for the Emerson Drive concert will also be available Sept. 26-27 and can be redeemed Sept. 29 to Oct. 1 for the actual concert ticket. Tickets will be $5 for stu­dents and $10 for public. 
"This should be a really big event with a huge turnout," Fabina said. 
Admissions commissioner Katie Press said this year the College will have 19 tour guides with 10 students serving as backups. She also said the admissions office has an unusu­ally high amount of freshmen interested in hosting prospective students. 
"We have not had too many prospective students yet, but I imagine that within the next two to three weeks the numbers will really increase," Press said. 
Mission commissioner Mary Beth Swyart told the board the College is asking students to help keep energy costs low by turning off lights when not in use or taking shorter showers. 
Junior class president Danielle Lerner reported the junior class will be selling pop and pizza after this week's Notre Dame football game. 
"Since the game will be so late, the dining hall will be closed and this will be a great way for everyone to enjoy some food afterwards," Lerner said. 
Freshmen elections will be held today, elections commis­sioner Anna Bauer said. If a run-off is necessary, it will be held Thursday. A total of seven tickets are running, Bauer said.

According to COR members, the majority of students questioned expressed great concern about NDSP taking advantage of the sit­uation and citing intoxicated, underage students getting off the bus. 
"Most are worried about NDSP hanging out at Main Circle and picking people off as they come back," Student Union Board man­ager Jimmy Flaherty said. 
Istvan said he plans to speak with NDSP administrators, but added that he hoped they would be happy with the knowledge that students were coming back to Notre Dame safely.

Floods kill at least 241 in Haiti 
GONAIVES, Haiti -Rescuers pulled bod­ies from receding floodwaters Monday that had raged through parts of Haiti's third­largest city, swept people from their homes and forced survivors to spend the night in trees, atop cars and on rooftops. The rapid­ly rising death toll from Tropical Storm Jeanne's weekend devastation stood at 241. 
"We expect to find dozens more bodies, especially in Gonaives," Dieufort Deslorges, a spokesman for Haiti's civil protection agency, told The Associated Press. 
Jeanne's torrential rains claimed victims from Haiti's southern peninsula to the north-coast town of Port-de-Paix, which had the second-highest death toll -40, he said. More than 130 were killed in Gonaives. 
U.N. fighting war against poverty 
UNITED NATIONS -The leaders of France and Brazil on Monday warned that poverty leads to violence and urged the international community to find ways to narrow the gap between rich and poor, casting a spotlight on the more than 1 bil­lion people living on less than $1 per day. 
President Bush skipped two high-level meetings, held on the eve of the annual 
U.N. General Assembly gathering, that focused on the impact of globalization and on ways to finance the war against poverty. One of the forums drew more than 50 world leaders. 
Bush's speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday also will emphasize international humanitarian concerns as the world body begins two weeks of meetings amid an upsurge of violence in Iraq and a massive humanitarian crisis in western Sudan.

Kerry said Bush misused power 
NEW YORK -Staking out new ground on Iraq, Sen. John Kerry said Monday he would not have overthrown Saddam Hussein had he been in the White House, and he accused President Bush of "stubborn incompetence," dishonesty and colossal failures of judg­ment. Bush said Kerry was flip-flopping. 
Less than two years after voting to give Bush authority to invade Iraq, the Democratic candidate said the president had misused that power by rushing to war without the backing of allies, a post-war plan or proper equipment for U.S. troops. "None of which I would have done," Kerry said. 
"Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator who deserves his own special place in hell," he added. "But that was not, in itself, a rea­son to go to war. The satisfaction we take in his downfall does not hide this fact: We have traded a dictator for a chaos that has left America less secure."

CBS apologizes for Bush story 
Network concedes it can't vouch for authenticity ofdocuments on Bush Guard duty 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -CBS News apologized Monday for a "mistake in judg­ment" in its story ques­tioning President Bush's National Guard service, claiming it was misled by the source of documents that several experts have dismissed as fakes. 
The network said it would appoint an inde­pendent panel to look at its reporting about the memos. The story has mushroomed into a major media scandal, threaten­ing the reputations of CBS News and chief anchor Dan Rather. 
It also became an issue in the presidential cam­paign. The White House said the affair raises questions about the con­nections between CBS's source, retired Texas National Guard officer Bill Burkett, and Democrat John Kerry's campaign. 
Rather joined CBS News President Andrew Heyward in issuing an apology Monday. 
"We made a mistake in judgment, and for that I am sorry," Rather said. "It was an error that was made, however, in good faith and in the spirit of trying to carry on a CBS News tradition of inves­tigative reporting without fear or favoritism." 
Almost immediately 
after the story aired Sept. 
8, document experts 
questioned memos pur­
portedly written by Bush's 
late squadron leader, Lt. 
Col. Jerry B. Killian, say­
ing they appeared to have 
been created on a com­
puter and not on the kind 
of typewriter in use dur­
ing the 1970s. 
CBS strongly defended 
its story. It wasn't until a 
week later after 
Killian's former secretary 
said she believed the 
memos were fake -did 
the news division admit 
they were questionable. 
Burkett admitted this 
weekend to CBS that he 


lied about obtaining the documents from another former National Guard member, the network said. CBS hasn't been able to conclusively tell how he got them, or even defi­nitely tell whether they're fakes or not. But the net­work has given up trying to defend them. 
"Based on what we now know, CBS News cannot prove that the documents are authentic, which is the only acceptable jour­nalistic standard to justify using them in the report," Heyward said. "We should not have used them." 
The Associated Press could not immediately reach Burkett for com­ment. Rather was set to interview Burkett Monday night on CBS' evening news program. 
Heyward told The Associated Press it was not clear what, if any, dis­ciplinary action would be taken against CBS News employees. Besides taint­ing the network's flagship broadcast, "60 Minutes," the report was a damag­ing blow to Rather, 7 2. Some have suggested the scandal, along with the low ratings of the "CBS Evening News," could hasten Rather's retire­ment. 

"Please know that noth­ing is more important to us than people's trust in our ability and our com­mitment to report fairly and truthfully," Rather said. 
Alex Jones, director of Harvard University's Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, said it appeared to be an honest mistake by CBS, not a willful attempt to deceive. But he said the network was too slow to respond. 
"I think that their delay­ing and obvious resist­ance to acknowledge the evident realities has kept the story alive a lot longer than it needed to be and was a lot more damaging to CBS than it needed to be," he said. 
For "60 Minutes," it's the biggest ethical mess since the 1995 incident captured in the movie "The Insider," which depicted the news­magazine caving to pres­sure from CBS lawyers and not airing a whistle-blowing report from an ex-tobacco executive. 
Jones said questions will probably center on the story's producer, Mary Mapes. She's one of the network's top investiga­tors and broke the story of the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal photos. Her immediate boss is Josh Howard, recently named executive producer of the "60 Minutes" Wednesday edition. 
White House press sec­retary Scott McClellan said the White House appreciated CBS's expres­sion of regret but that there were still serious questions about Burkett. 
"Bill Burkett, who CBS now says is their source, in fact is not an unim­peachable source as was previously claimed," McLellan said. "Bill Burkett is a source who has been discredited and so this raises a lot of questions. There were media reports about Mr. Burkett having senior level contacts with the Kerry campaign." 
TheKerry campaign has 
said it had nothing to do 
with the story. 
Video on Web shows beheading 
Associated Press 

BAGHDAD, Iraq-A video posted Monday on a Web site showed the beheading of a man identified as American civil engineer Eugene Armstrong. The militant group led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi claimed responsibility for the slaying and 
said another hostage  - either an  
American or a Briton  - would be  
killed in 24 hours.  

The grisly decapitation was the latest killing in a particularly vio­lent month in Iraq, with more than 300 people dead in insurgent attacks and U.S. military strikes over the past seven days. Earlier Monday, gunmen in Baghdad assassinated two clerics from a powerful Sunni Muslim group that has served as a mediator to release hostages. 
The video of the beheading of the man believed to be Armstrong sur­faced soon after the expiration of a 48-hour deadline set earlier by al­Zarqawi's Tawhid and Jihad group for the beheading of the three civil engineers. The men -Armstrong, American Jack Hensley and Briton Kenneth Bigley -were abducted Thursday from their home in a wealthy Baghdad neighborhood. 
A militant whose voice resembled al-Zarqawi, who has been linked to al-Qaida, read a statement in the video saying the next hostage would be killed in 24 hours unless all Muslim women prisoners are released from U.S. military jails. 
"You, sister, rejoice. God's sol­diers are coming to get you out of your chains and restore your purity by returning you to your mother and father," he said before grab­bing the hostage, seated at his feet, and cutting his throat. 
In Washington, a U.S. off-icial, speaking on condition of anonymi­ty, said Armstrong's body had been recovered, but the official would provide no information about where or when.

INDONESIA 

Ex-general takes leads in election returns 
Susilo Yudhoyono expected to defeat incumbent Megawati 
Associated Press 
JAKARTA, Indonesia -A U.S.-trained former general who led the fight against al­Qaida-linked extremists in Indonesia appeared headed for a landslide victory Tuesday in a presidential runoff heralded as a key step for democracy in the world's most populous Muslim nation. 
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who focused his campaign on fixing the economy and cracking down on corruption, had 60 per­cent of the votes with nearly half counted early Tuesday. Incumbent President Megawati Sukarnoputri had 40 percent. 
The General Election Commission said about 122 million votes were cast dur­ing Monday's balloting. Voter turnout was about 80 percent. 
The Washington-based National Democratic Institute, the international arm of the Democratic Party, said its "Quick Count" sur­vey gave Yudhoyono 61 per­cent and Megawati 39 per­cent. The group, which based its forecast on counts at selected voting stations, accurately predicted the results of Indonesia's parlia­mentary elections in April and the first round of the presidential election in July, in which Yudhoyono and Megawati were the two leaders. 


Yudhoyono declined to for­mally claim victory late Monday, but told reporters: "I am grateful to God, and thankful to the people of Indonesia who have given me ... that kind of support." 
Megawati, who had stabi­lized the economy but saw her popularity wane because of anger over continuing graft, did not concede, say­ing she would await the announcement of official results in early October. 
The election was held to choose Indonesia's fourth head of state since wide­spread street protests over an economic slump forced an end to the 32-year dicta­torship of former military leader Suharto in 1998. 
The polls were free of vio­lence and accusations of fraud in a further boost to an orderly succession in Indonesia that is being held up as evidence that democ­racy can prosper in the Muslim world, most of which is ruled by authoritarian regimes. 
While Yudhoyono appealed to Washington because of his hard line against terror­ists in this strategically located nation that stretches under Southeast Asia from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean, most Indonesians were concerned about the economy and corruption. 
The 55-year-old retired soldier said his priorities are building up an economy that is growing much slower than Indonesia's neighbors, attacking graft and provid­ing jobs for the country's 210 million people. 
But he also promised to crack down harder on Jemaah Islamiyah, a group with links to al-Qaida that has been blamed for three bloody terror attacks -the Sept. 9 truck bombing out­side the Australian Embassy, last year's bombing at the Marriott hotel in Jakarta and the 2002 bombings in a nightclub district on the resort island of Bali. 
As security minister under Megawati, Yudhoyono over­saw a campaign that is thought to have dispersed Jemaah Islamiyah's mem­bers, forcing them to split up into smaller groups with less coordination. 
"Yudhoyono is strong, car­ing. He is hard. He is best for Indonesia," said Marni, a 37-year-old housekeeper who like many Indonesians uses only one name. 
Megawati will remain a force. Her Indonesian Party of Struggle and Suharto's former Golkar Party emerged from April's parlia­mentary elections as the largest factions in the legis­lature, each winning about a fifth of the seats. 
Yudhoyono~ new Democratic Party won just 8 percent of the seats, so his government will have to rely on a wide coalition of secular and moderate religious par­ties. But the projected size of his victory Monday should strengthen him in dealing with parliament. 
Under Suharto, lawmakers -not voters -picked the head of state in a system the dictator abused to maintain his grip on power. Monday's vote was the first time Indonesians directly elected their leader.

IN BRIEF 

Delta tries to prevent bankruptcy 
ATLANTA-Delta Air Lines' pilots union agreed Monday to allow the struggling carrier to bring pilots out of retirement on a limited basis to deal with staff shortages that threaten to ground flights. 
The move came after the company agreed not to terminate the pilots' pension plan before February even if it files for bankruptcy. 
The tentative agreement must be ratified by the 7,500 active Delta pilots. The nation's third­largest airline has warned that it would have to file for bankruptcy if did not stem a wave of early pilot retirements by the end of September. 
The agreement still does not resolve Delta's larger problem: getting the pilots to agree to $1 billion in concessions. The Atlanta-based airline has also warned of the possibility of a Chapter 11 filing without the concessions. 
Delta fears that its pilots could jump ship en masse because they are worried about their pensions amid United Airlines' threat to termi­nate its employee retirement plans. Several hundred Delta pilots have retired early in recent months, and more have threatened such moves. chief executive Gerald Grinstein has said. 
The pilots union said there will be a "random selection process" for those in the post-retire­ment pool, which can be tapped only when staffmg falls below a certain level. 
Oil prices advance to new high 
WASHINGTON -Oil prices advanced to their highest level in a month Monday, sur­passing $46 a barrel, as supply constraints in the United States and Russia piqued the nerves of a market already edgy about the world's limited production capabilities and ris­ing demand. 
Cash-strapped Russian oil giant Yukos said it would halt some oil exports to China, while 
U.S. petroleum inventories are expected to decline again this week due to production, refining and shipping delays caused by Hurricane Ivan. 
Neither factor is itself a punishing blow to the global supply chain, analysts said, though each is enough to test the nerves oftraders already worried that there might not be enough excess output capacity to handle a more serious, prolonged disruption. 
Jury selection begins for criminal trial involving former engery-trading giant 
Associated Press 

HOUSTON -A judge overseeing the first criminal trial involving former Enron Corp. executives told prospective jurors Monday he didn't expect them to have "come out of some hole somewhere" and not know of the former energy­trading giant. 
Those chosen for the panel will decide if four for­mer Merrill Lynch & Co. executives and two former midlevel Enron executives participated in the sham sale of electricity-producing Nigerian barges to the bro­kerage in 1999 to prop up Enron's earnings. 
On Monday, lawyers whit­tled the 150-member pool to 50 candidates, and were expected to return Tuesday to seat 12 jurors and four alternates. 
U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein told the prospective jurors he expected they wouldn't have "come out of some hole somewhere" and would at least would have heard of Enron or the demise of Arthur Andersen, convicted two years ago of covering up for its account­ing client.

Fannie Mae manipulated earnings 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON-Federal regulators have found evidence suggesting that mortgage giant Fannie Mae manipu­lated earnings to facilitate bigger bonuses to executives, according to a lawmaker familiar with the fmdings. 
In an eight-month investigation, the agency that supervises Fannie Mae found a pattern of manipulation aimed at smoothing out volatility in profits from quarter to quarter similar to that which occurred at rival Freddie Mac -whose understatement of billions in profits prompted a man­agement shake-up and a $125 million government fme. 
The agency. the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, was presenting its new report criticizing Fannie Mae's accounting practices to the board of the government-spon­sored company on Monday. 
The report provides "a strong indi­cation that Fannie Mae manipulated earnings in a way that appears to be smoothing," said Michael DiResto, spokesman for Rep. Richard Baker, R­La., who has been briefed on the OFHEO fmdings. 
DiResto was confirming a report in Monday's Wall Street Journal. He said that Baker, who heads a House panel that oversees the two mortgage giants, had a "strong concern" that increasing executive bonuses may have been a factor behind the faulty accounting. 
OFHEO spokeswoman Corinne Russell declined comment, as did Janice Daue, a spokeswoman for Fannie Mae. 
Fannie Mae's chairman and chief executive, Franklin Raines, has defended the company's accounting and said that it has unfairly suffered "collateral damage" from the account­ing crisis at Freddie Mac. 
Washington-based Fannie Mae is the second-largest U.S. financial insti­tution behind Citigroup. 
Its accounting came under close scrutiny after Freddie Mac, its smaller rival in the multitrillion-dollar home mortgage market, disclosed in June 2003 that it had understated profits.

EPA to create new rules for -waste 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Trying to overcome a possibly crippling court decision, the Environmental Protection Agency hopes to have a propos­al by early next year on new radiation exposure limits at a proposed nuclear waste site in Nevada. 
Jeffrey Ilolmstead, chief of EPA's air and radiation pro­grams, told a panel of scientists Monday that a wide range of options is being considered that would not require Congress to intervene in the politically charged issue. 
The future of the waste proj­ect at Yucca Mountain in the Nevada desert was put into jeopardy when a federal appeals court rejected an EPA radiation exposure standard in 

Fact-finding done in DeLay case 
Ethics committee to present news on majority leader 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON House ethics committee leaders said Monday they soon will present the panel with information on Majority Leader Torn DeLay's conduct and recommend whether to undertake a full investigation. 
The announcement from Chairman Joel Hefley, R-Colo., and Alan Mollohan, D-W.Va., did not say whether the com­mittee would be convened this week on a complaint that DeLay misused his office for political purposes. 
"In the near future we will be presenting to the committee the information we have obtained and recommendations for com­mittee action," the written statement said. 
A three-part complaint was filed by a Democratic lawmaker defeated in the primary, Hep. Chris Bell of Texas. The 10­member committee, equally divided by party, could send the allegations to an investigative subcommittee, dismiss some allegations while ordering a probe of others or throw out the complaint. 
Two allegations directly involve use of DeLay's congres­sional office. 
One accuses the Texas Hepublican of soliciting corpo­rate contributions in return for help on legislation. A second contends he improperly used his staff to contact U.S. aviation authorities and ask them to track down Texas Democratic legislators who had fled the state while trying to thwart a DeLay-backed redistricting plan. 
The third allegation accuses DeLay of using his political action committees to distribute money from corporations to Texas legislative candidates in violation of state law. 
DeLay has replied to the com­mittee, but has not released his response publicly. 
In related developments: 
+ A grand jury in Austin, Texas, was expected to meet Tuesday in its investigation of July that was tied to 10,000 years into the future, even though some of the waste will be at its most dangerous thou­sands of years later. 
The court said EPA failed to take into account a 1995 National Academy of Sciences recommendation that the stan­dard be set at periods of peak­radiation, although Congress required that the recommenda­tions be followed. Opponents of the project have argued that the design of the waste site as it is now contemplated cannot meet a standard set that far into the future. 
Members of the Board of Hadioactive Waste Management, a part of the National Academy of Sciences, examined at a meeting Monday the implications of the court case and possible options for election spending by a political action committee associated with DeLay, Texans for a Hepublican Majority. Bell's corn­plaint contends the same politi­cal committee sent $190,000 in corporate money to the Hepublican National Committee in an illegal scheme to give money to Texas state legislative candidates. The grand jury is looking into similar allegations. 
+ 
Bell asked the ethics commit­tee, formally the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, to subpoena a report that could provide insight into one of his aJlegations. The report, pre­pared for Westar Energy, inves­tigated the company's 2002 plan to influence pending feder­al legislation by making politi­cal donations. 

+ 
A group seeking an inde­pendent investigator in the case ran newspaper ads this week in Hefley's and Mollohan's horne states. The ads accuse the com­mittee members of keeping their heads in the sand and "choosing to play ostrich rather than investigate" DeLay. 



future action. The board fre­quently offers a forum to exam­ine waste management issues. 
Robert Fri. chairman of the National Academy panel that wrote the 1995 report cited by the court, suggested the EPA satisfy the court's objections only by significantly altering its standard more in line with what his group had recom­mended. 
That would involve going well beyond 10,000 years, but not necessarily so far into the future that risk modeling, or even the proposed Yucca design, might be useless, Fri suggested. 
EPA would have to adopt a less conservative approach to determining public risks from exposure, said Fri, a scholar at the environmental think tank Resources for the Future.

Candidates agree on presidential debates 
Bush, Kerry to participate in three sessions 
Associated Press 
DERRY, N.H. -Negotiators for President Bush and Democrat John Kerry agreed Monday to three 90-minute debates beginning Sept. 30, including one town-hall format with questions from undecided voters. 
The two campaigns essential­ly went along with recommen­dations from the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates -except for the pro­posed subject matter of the first and third debates. 
The topic of the first meeting will be foreign policy and homeland security, rather than the economy as the commission had suggested. The final debate, which was to be on for­eign policy, will now be about the economy. 
Details of the agreement were announced by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the chief negotiator for Bush, and attorney Vernon Jordan for Kerry. 
The first debate will be Sept. 30 at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Fla. The second, a town-hall style format, will be Oct. 8 at Washington University in St. Louis, and the third will beheld Oct. 13 at Arizona State University in Tempe. 
One vice presidential debate between Vice President Dick Cheney and Democratic vice presidential nominee John Edwards takes place Oct. 5 at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. 

Bush and Kerry "are pleased with today's announcement and look forward to the deba.tes," Baker and Jordan said in a joint statement. Details were outlined in an accompanying 32-page document. 
Kerry's campaign agreed to the commission's proposal for venues, dates and moderators in July, about a month after the commission released its sched­ule. Bush's campaign at first sought only to limit the scope to two presidential debates and one vice presidential debate, according to those familiar with the negotiations. 
The campaigns also agreed to the commission's choice of moderators: Jim Lehrer of PBS for the first, Charles Gibson of ABC for the second, Bob Schieffer of CBS for the third, and Gwen Ifill of PBS for the vice presidential debate. 
The commission only invited the two major-party candi­dates. In the agreement, Bush and Kerry said that should cir­cumstances change, and a third-party candidate be added, the candidate would have to abide by terms of their agreB­ment. 
GOP leads in financial backing 

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The GOP's qecision to hold its presidential nominating convention a month later than the Democratic gathering is giving President Bush a big financial advantage in the campaign's fmal weeks. 
Not only does Democratic hopeful John Kerry have to make his $7 5 million in full government financing for the general-election campaign stretch a month longer than Bush does, but the Democratic National Committee has also started burning through the money it has banked to pro­mote its nominee faster than the Republican National Committee has. 
Kerry spent $10 million of his $75 million government check last month, starting September with $62 million left. The DNC started this month with $56 million in the bank after spend­ing roughly $46 million in August, much of it on TV and radio ads supporting Kerry and opposing Bush. 
The Republican National 
Committee spent about $20 million in August, starting September with nearly $94 million on hand. The party nominated Bush on Sept. 2, putting an end to his private campaign fund-raising just over a month after Kerry's nomination put an end to his. 
Both parties are aggressively raising money to spend in the presidential race, In addition to the unlimited amounts they can spend independent of their nominees, each can spend roughly $16 million in coordi­nation with them.

John Kerry on Iraq: a reasoned approach 

You've heard the jokes on both sides. Daddy's Texas cowboy paints the war on terror in black and white, unable or refusing to acknowledge the com­plexities of the situation abroad. The bleeding heart liber­al equivocates on the Katie Boyle issues at stake while babbling on about a For what it's few Purple Hearts he worth may or may not have earned during Vietnam. 
I have a suggestion. Forget about President Bush and Sen. John Kerry's respective military records. I guaran­tee that you can find many soldiers who have proven more heroic than they. In addition, the legitimacy of Vietnam is still debated today. Bush's father allegedly pulled strings to place him in the National Guard. Blame him for this opportunism if you will, but many would have done the same. Some also question Bush's fulfillment of his National Guard duties. 
Conversely. Kerry did a shortened tour of duty in Vietnam. Some, howev­er, question his motivation and honors earned. Squabbling over which man was more patriotic over a quarter of a century ago is a waste of time. 
More importantly, consider that the blatant manipulation of facts by politi­cal candidates could, in layman's terms, be called lying. I do not consid­er giving a deliberate false impression to be anything else. I do not claim that the Democratic Party or its candidate has never engaged in this act. I would, however, like to point out the mind­boggling level of stupidity the Republican Party assigns the average voter in this election. 
I am astonished that the Republicans have chosen to make Ken:y's military service a key issue this year as they attempt to attack him and fortify their 'tough on terror' image. I hear Bush captures rattlesnakes too. 
Barehanded. 

The reason, however, that I am so surprised at the Republican National Committee's decision to prioritize this issue in conjunction with the war on terror is the relative weakness of its position. Bush's record aside, Vice President Dick Cheney obtained five deferments during the Vietnam War, and is quoted as saying, "I had other priorities in the '60s than military service." Attorney General John 
OBSERVER POLL 
Ashcroft was granted an eyebrow­
raising seven deferments. 
Given these facts, why would Republicans invite such accusations? Considering the Republican machine's assault on war veteran Sen. John McCain in the last election, one could surmise that it has the mentality of a rabid dog, attacking anything which agitates it. This comparison, however, is not my answer. 
Perhaps Karl Rove decided it was easier to attack Kerry's past than his policies. Vietnam still captures the attention of many Americans, and Kerry has consistently demonstrated both logic and intelligence in his Senate votes on war and terrorism. 
It is true that Kerry's opinions on war and terror are not simple. Neither is the situation abroad. For this rea­son, he is. correct. One can only sur­mise that the snide remarks accusing Kerry of flip-flopping on the issues are meant to appeal to the voter who can't be bothered to read a paragraph fol­lowing his line of thought. There are many such voters. Hopefully, you aren't one of them. 
Kerry voted for the war in Iraq. He continues to be supportive of this war. He believes, however, that the Bush administration should have recruited allies to aid America after its invasion. Kerry did vote against funding the war. With this decision, he intended to make a public statement regarding the Bush's handling of the Iraqi situation and his decision to take the country further into debt to fund the war with Iraq instead of repealing tax cuts. Kerry has always maintained that had the bill been in danger of not passing. he would never have endangered our troops in his second vote against it. 
In Europe last year, I realized the strength of anti-American sentiment abroad. 
I use the phrase 'anti-American' hesitantly, as in most cases I was met with incredible politeness and civility. The name "George Bush," however, was not. 
If elected, Kerry will help to raise America's image from the graveyard of unilateralism. Not only does the simple choice of Kerry make a strong state­ment to the rest of the world, he will counteract the current egotistical view of our nation the Bush administration perpetuates. Kerry claims he will try to adhere to the advice of the United 
Nations. Despite Bush's flat repudia­
tion of weapons of mass destruction. 
in 2003 at the U.N. General Assembly, 
the United States was the only nation 
to vote against the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty. 
In an even more telling move, the 
United States, India and Micronesia 
were the sole votes against a plan to 
prevent nuclear proliferation in the 
Middle East. Were this technology its 
reason for preemptively attacking 
Iraq, one would think such a strategy 
would be approved. 
Fighting the war on terror without revamping America's image assumes the war on terror can be won with guns and firepower. Without discount­ing its importance in this effort, if America does not directly counteract the imperialist portrayal it projects even in Western Europe, how will she refute the slander of radical ideo­logues in the Middle East? Instead, in many cases, the United States has strengthened the perception of an imperious America that lacks respect for other cultures. The sympathy our nation garnered after Sept. 11 is giv­ing way to the increasing popularity of jihad in the Middle East, promulgating support for terrorist attacks. 
A decisive victory has never been possible in the war on terror. What America needs is the slow transforma­tion of a world view. Of course, one cannot rule out the use of aggressive tactics. But the Bush administration's dependence upon them is only likely to antagonize those who have not yet left America's side. 
When accepting the Democratic nomination, Kerry quoted a former, great President. "I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side." 
America needs a change in its approach to foreign policy and the war on terror. 
That change will come with the elec­tion of John Kerry.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Battling over the right to life 
1 am loathe to state the obvious to the learned fellows that make up the phi-· losophy faculty, but the battle over the right to life-each individual human being's fundamental right to receive and preserve the incidents of their unique creation in due course-has never and should never be about "whether life begins at conception." If such was the case, Hoe v. Wade could be overruled, re-decided and (unfortu­nately) reaffirmed monthly -the fruit of whatever "Studies-Have-Shown" bestseller happens to appear embold­ened by our academic journals, chock full of words like "inadequate cellular respiration." 
Whether life scientifically begins at conception is a question that, if answered affirmatively, would surely benefit the pro-life movement. Nevertheless, it remains but a red-her­ring enabling those who deny a funda­mental right to life from the starting point of human development to avert their eyes in a principled way from what technology has evolved to reveal since Roe v. Wade -ultrasound pic­tures of hearts beating; babies being born premature at four to five months gestation, yet thriving; the in-womb surgery to correct spina-bifida. 
By inserting highly technical lan­guage into their arguments, our profes­sionals obscure the humanness of the new entity, and ask the laity to ignore mere fundamental logic: once created through seed and soil, the entity begun is an entity human. It shall not mutate into a dog or a shark; it is not, as Ben Stein said recently on C-Span, "Jell-0." Like some convicted soldier crawling up perilous Iwo Jima to a destination of victory, whatever "it" "is" unabashedly reaches for the tools to grow into what society might in its ever-unprincipled short-sightedness recognize as a human being-e.g. some appearance we can at least measure against Mona Lisa or David. For thousands of years -excepting Roman barbarism -we could trust that nothing short of nature's will-a defect in the process itself-could prevent "its" suc­cessful ascent to its birthright. 
Indeed, we might easily replace our so­called "conceit" of thinking of human life as a "con­catenation of atomic points in time" because the worthy understudy has more experience in the spot­light of his­tory any­way. We may there­fore think anew of the "right" to human life as "sparking" with a moment of atomic preci­sion. We mark this moment by our logic, as described above, and concede to it by our own ignorance after. It is not for us to obstruct the process that will produce Edward Maniers and William Shakespeares. For if it was, for example, what harm could "Prof. X" find in the time-adven­turing conceits of an outspoken col­league, who, having been recently embarrassed by X's challenging expose' in an academic journal, travels back to "A.D. X: moment of concep­tion," and proceeds to prevent any fur-

Rock the Democratic vote? 
The College Democrats and Rock the Vote came to the College Republicans meeting on Wednesday with a proposal. They requested assistance with their program, designed to register voters throughout the South Bend area, and then to provide transportation for those voters to the polls.. Needless to say, their cause is a noble one. It is important that everyone have the abili­ty to vote. 
The problem perceived by the College Republicans with that program was that the precincts being serviced are over­whelmingly Democratic precincts. Republicans are not trying to destroy democracy, but they are trying to get a Republican governor (Mitch Daniels) and a Republican senator (Chris Chocola) elected this November. 
The College Democrats and Rock the Vote were asking the College Republicans to support a program that could potentially thwart the campaigns of these two candi­dates. 
As many College Republicans expected, an article about Wednesday's meeting was published in the Viewpoint. Philip Wells wrote that the College Republicans "voted unanimously against democracy ... based on prejudicial assumptions regarding race and income." I think Wells was at the wrong meeting, because at the College Republicans meeting I attended Wednesday, race and income were never mentioned. 
The motion to support the Rock the Vote program failed because the College Republicans support Daniels and Chocola, not because they hate democracy or because they are racially and economically prejudiced. Wells may as well have said, "The College Republicans are big fans of Senator Ted Kennedy," because that state­ment would be every bit as true as his statement about our vote against democra­cy because of "racial and economic profil­ing." 
Wells also commented that the College Republicans would prefer Democrats to stay silent and not vote in November. This is certainly not true. 
I will say, however, that decisions are made by those who show up, and it is not the responsibility of the College Republicans to solicit Democratic votes. The College Republicans cannot and will not be blamed for poor Democratic voter turnout, nor will they stand by while their support for democnicy is questioned as a result of their support for Republican can­didates.

ther development? Under Manier's "atomic theory" has any personal "right" of Prof. X himself been infringed? 
I should say, "yes," in a resounding "war-cry" of injustice. A collateral retort that traces the ipjustice simply to the temporal want and choice of X's loving parents merits no dis­cussion here, where it is the 
right of X (post-facto, if you will), a 
real person, with whom we are con­cerned. Put simply, if you prefer to bequeath 

your right to exist and grow and learn-from your own "it" conception until death -to the willfulness of anotlier of God's fallen creatures ­how much you are "wanted"-I suggest you install an extra lock on your door, and hire a lob­byist in Congress-you're not get­ting any younger. 
Manier suggests the derision and division caused by alleged hate-filled life issues polarization "destroys the spirit of agape love essential to a cul­ture of life." I cannot disagree-inci­dentally, I hope Manier may challenge stereotypes reducing the pro-life move­ment to war-like, epithet-chanting fanatics. 
Admittedly, invoking visualizations of the Nazi holocaust or slavery have an incendiary impact, but the intent is to charitably remind the ever-selfish and non-agape human community that it has before forgotten who was human -or had the right to be called "human"-and might have done so again -no less than 40 million times. Paused reflection on these images offers us all a potential escape from the unforgiving weight of tomorrow's con­demnation -the rest of the history book that follows our deeds now. 
Manier will no doubt recall that "agape" love is "self-giving" love. I have found Paul's own verse a master­ful depiction of what this must be: 
"Have among yourselves the same attitude that is also yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality as something to be grasped. Rather, he emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, coming in human likeness ... " (Philippians 2:6-7). 
We, also, are called to pour out our own selves; let our resources and our love and support flow so that nothing is left. This includes loving those "Samaritans" who differ from you politically and morally, but it necessari­ly, fundamentally includes opening your arms, as Christ-whether you call Him divine or no -did on His cross, accepting what suffering and sacrifice may come, but welcoming all life to pass through its ordained gates. And if that welcoming means a contin­uing "civil-war" of ideology, "then let it come ... and let it be, finally, the last battle of the American Revolution." (cf. Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams, Amistad). 
Andrew Hiller law student Sept. 20 

Definition of a 
College Republican 
As co-President of the College Republicans, I would like to clear something up lest there be any mistake. Neither I, the officers of the club, nor the College Republicans as a club are racist in any manner. Such suggestions merely evince the bitter nature of those who propose this initiative. I myself am a minority and first­generation American; my father was born in Bogota, Colombia and did not immigrate to America until he was 20. This decision had nothing to do with race and everything to do with the num­bers. To suggest otherwise is offensive, hurtful and degrading. 
Our club researched the issue and saw that the Transpo routes travel directly through heavily Democratic districts. In essence, we would be campaigning for the opposite party. Therefore, we decided this was not an endeavor that we could afford to waste pre­cious time and resources on. We instructed the Democrats that if they wished to go ahead with this effort they could do so but we would not put our name on a purely partisan effort. 
The College Republicans are not anti-democratic. If the Democratic Party wants to go out and register their own, that is fme with us, but please do not try and convince us it is in our own interest and a bi-partisan effort. Our club is called the College Republicans and not the College Voter Initiative Club; it is our job to help the local campaigns of Republican candidates not to become involved in counter-pro­ductive, biased efforts. In fact, we have gone out into the community and campaigned for Chris Chocola ever since the mid-term elections two years ago. My freshman year, I went door-to­door for the Congressman; so I resent the implication that we want nothing to do with South 
I 
I

Bend. The reality is that we 
should rather get involved in I I community outreach and cam­I paigning that is not slanted against the candidates that we spend so much time helping.

DVD REVIEWS 

'Mystic River' delivers drama, intrigue 
By JULIE HYNES Scrnr Critic 
. 

Clint Eastwood's "Mystic IUver" might be the most scintillating crime film coming out on DVD in recent weeks. Based on the best-selling novel by Dennis Lehane, the lilm is sure to keep your interest piqued for the duration. The movie also boasts an all-star cast including Sean Penn, Tim Hobbins, Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne. 
"Mystic Hiver" starts out by 11ashing back 25 years ago to a fateful day on the streets of Boston. Jimmy Markum (Penn). Dave Boyle (Hobbins) and Sean Devine (Bacon) are playing a game of stickball when a car rolls up and a well-dressed gentlemen steps out iden­tifying himself as a police officer. lie lectures the boys. sending Jimmy and Sean home. The officer tells Dave. he must get into his car because the offi­cer is going to drive him home. At this point the audience has an inkling that something is not quite right with this set up. There is an ominous feeling that

It turns out the well-dressed man is no police officer. He is in fact a sex offender. Luckily, Dave is able to escape after a horrifying experience and returns home. 
But it is here that "Mystic River" rais­es one of several thought provoking questions. Can victims of such violent sexual abuse really go on with their lives? Twenty-five years later some­thing about him is definitely discon­certing. There is an emptiness in his blue eyes that one can't help but notice. 
Tragedy st.rikes the community and brings Jimmy, Dave and Sean together again when Jimmy's daughter Katie is brutally murder·ed after a night out with the girls. The police know that Dave was at the bar Katie was last seen at that night. They do not know that the very same night he came home covered in blood with a fuzzy story about killing a sex offender. 
As the film progresses, Dave becomes more and more of a prominent suspect. His wife looks through the paper each day hoping to find sup­port for her husband's story with no luck. Can Sean solve this homicide before Jimmy decides to ·take matters into his 
own hands?

The movie remains largely faithful to the comic, with only minor changes. Frank Castle, the Punisher's alter ego, hasn't developed psychic powers. or the ability to turn green when angry. He's an average guy, so driven by grief that he accomplishes feats that some would consider impossible. After his family is killed, Frank proceeds to take on the Saint crime organization, led by Howard Saint (John Travolta). Travolta plays the malevolent role decently, but does not come off as evil as his character in "Face/Off." 
However, there are some still minor complaints with the acting in general. Thomas Jane, the actor who plays Frank Castle, does a commendable job 
·playing the Punisher. It's not the great­est acting performance ever, but it was convincing. And when compared to the people who were offered the position first, such as Yin Diesel. the acting could be seen as Oscar-worthy. The support­
ing roles are somewhat comedic, which interfere with the dark nature of the movie. While the humor is nice because it lightens an otherwise terribly dark movie, it feels out of place at times and ruins the mood. 
The DVD video trans­fer is a decent one. Video and audio quality are both quite good. The By MARK BEMENDERFER 
Scrnr Critic 

!laving a bad day? Well. "The Punisher" is a great movie to put things into perspective. No matter how bad your day is going. there is almost no way that it could top the one for Frank Castle, the main character in "The Punisher." In the span of 30 minutes he loses his entire family, including all in­laws and distant relatives. And that is just the beginning. 
Far from being the feel-good movie of the year, "The Punisher" is however one of the better comic book movies to have been released. While it doesn't quite reach the high standards set by the "Spider-Man" and "X-Men" franchises, it still rises above the generic tripe that Hollywood calls an action movie. 
The characters and concept for "The Punisher" were derived from the pages of Marvel comics. Originally set in a vil­lainous role, creator Stan Lee felt the Punisher was too sympathetic a charac­ter to be pegged a total rogue. So he definitely not someone to mess with. 

Robbins gives a haunting perform­ance. It is impossible to determine if his character is a dangerous killer or a guy who just hasn't been completely there since that fateful car ride. Bacon helps give the movie a balanced feel as his character keeps his wits about him in the midst of chaos. Fishburne has a supporting role as one of the investiga­tors of the murder. 
"Mystic River" will not disappoint. It is hard to do the film justice on paper because it is impossible to cover all of the complex. varying subplots and to write about all of the twists would ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it. 
But do yourself the favor of renting it. It's a great alternative to the always­enjoyable romantic comedy that often finds its way into a dorm DVD player. Popcorn is recommended -you will need something to chew nervously on during the intensely suspenseful moments.

darker colors are slightly off. so a TV that has a hard time with black scales might not show this movie under the best light, especially because a lot of scenes take place at night. 
The extras on the DVD are quite nice with. deleted scenes, commentaries and featurettes being included. The com­mentaries give the viewer some more depth, such as comments by the director that tell the viewer how the limited film budget caused certain scenes to be cut. With a larger budget, this movie would have easily been a rival to the other released superhero adventures. 
Hopefully a sequel will address many of the plot ideas mentioned in the spe­cial features on the disc. Overall, "The Punisher" is a good movie with some very decent action scenes and a truly awesome fight scene involving wrestler Kevin Nash. With some good special fea­tures and decent video and audio trans­fers, this is definitely a recommended DVD for fans to pick up.

MOVIE REVIEW 

Film serves up new shot at old game 

By LIZ BYRUM Scene Writer 

The new film "Wimbledon," a roman­tic comedy produced by the company who brought "Notting Hill" and "Bridget Jones' Diary" to the big screen, takes a new approach to the classic story of the underdog. In the movie, Peter Colt (Paul Bettany) intrigues the audience as he strives for the impossible at Wimbledon and steals the heart of American tennis star Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst). 
Peter Colt is a former tennis great who was once ranked 11th in the world, but has since 
Colt's life as he tries to fulfill his dream of winning the men's singles title against the best young tennis players in the world. His family gives the movie needed depth, as well as a wonderful taste of British humor. Although they each play minor parts in the film, the actors who portray Colt's mother, father and brother each fit their roles very well. 
"Wimbledon" also shows an aspect of a sport that many people never see. 
That is the role a parent sometimes plays in the life of a grown athlete. In the movie, Lizzie's father, Dennis Bradbury (Sam Neill). wants to control every aspect of her life in order to see 
her win. As the 
fallen from glory -story plays out,

Wimbledon, the The relation­

most prestigious ten­nis tournament in the world. 

Throughout the movie, Colt's luck takes him through ups and downs both professionally and personally. Finding love gives him the confidence he needs to fight back after years of defeat, but he isn't sure it will be enough to take him back to the top. Bettany's perform­ance is a believable one that leaves you rooting for the underdog. 
"Wimbledon" provides a comical and touching portrayal of many aspects of 
ship Colt has with his practice partner and best friend, German tennis champion Dieter Proll (Nicolaj Coster Waldau). also pro­vides an important aspect to "Wimbledon" by showing the support and encouragement friends and com­petitors can have for one another. Even for someone who doesn't play sports, this relationship could teach an impor­tant lesson about loyalty and friendship. On the opposite· end of the spectrum is the young Jake Hammond (Austin Nichols). the favorite in the tourna­ment, and Colt's personal and profes­sional enemy from the beginning. With a small, but significant role, Hammond is truly a character the audience loves to hate. 
At first glance, this story may seem like nothing more than a sappy romance that only teenage girls would enjoy. However, it is much more than that. It is a story that brings together aspects of love and athletics in a way that is not seen very often at the movies. It may take a certain kind of guy to appreciate what is put across in the film, but it is definitely worth a try. Through impressive acting, great writ­ing and a complex storyline, "Wimbledon" rises above the average teen movie.

'Sopranos,' HBO triumph at Emmys 
Associated Press 

"The Sopranos" finally whacked its competitors in the best drama category at: the Emmy Awards, and a comedy series victory for ratings-starved "Arrested Development" proved some­body was watching. But it was HBO and its record-breaking "Angels in America" that fluttered away with the most trophies. 
IIBO's megahit about a New Jersey mob family collected the best drama Emmy on its fifth try Sunday, and the channel's "Sex and the City" and "Angels in America" helped cable over­shadow the traditional networks. 
"We've put a lot of work into it and I think we've gotten better. It's good that it finally paid off." series creator David Chase said of "The Sopranos," which is entering its last season. 
MeaPwhile, the theme was "gone, but not forgotten" in many of the acting categories as stars who ended their runs as beloved characters on "The Sopranos," "Frasier" and "Sex and the City" collected most of the series tro­phies. 
Drea de Matteo, who played the ill­fated mob girlfriend Adriana Ia Cerva on "The Sopranos," won for best drama series supporting actress, while Michael Imperioli, who played her backstabbing boyfriend Christopher Moltisanti, col­lected supporting drama-series actor. 
"There are so many people that are responsible for this, that if I even try to thank any of them right now, I might puke, choke, cry or die. And you've already seen me do that," said de Matteo, whose character met a grim end last season. She's now on NBC's "Friends" spinoff "Joey." 
Mirroring the concern in Hollywood over the dwindling number and quality of situation comedies, the four major comedy acting awards each went for work in a series that has ended. Kelsey Grammer won his fourth Emmy for best actor in a comedy for "Frasier" and Sarah Jessica Parker won best actress for "Sex and the City." 
"I had the most extraordinary life on television," Grammer said. "Frasier was a gift in my life and the people that I got to meet and work with were the gre~.test and this is just the cherry on top. 
David Hyde Pierce won a supporting actor award for "Frasier," which ended an 11-year run this spring, and Cynthia Nixon won best supporting actress for "Sex and the City." 
"In sitcom school they tell you how great it is to have a long-running show," said Hyde Pierce, "but they don't tell you how hard it is to say goodbye." 
Although cable ruled the night, Fox's "Arrested Development" provided a rare bright spot for broadcast televi­sion, winning as best comedy series after a freshman year that was critical­ly acclaimed but low rated. 
"This is so huge for us. You know what? Let's watch it," series creator Mitchell Hurwitz urged viewers. 
The broadcast networks also claimed honors for Allison Janney of NBC's "The West Wing" and James Spader of ABC's "The Practice," who won best actor awards for drama. 
"You've all made wonderful choices in shoes and dresses tonight and you all look absolutely beautiful," Spader said in a lighthearted acceptance. 
"Angels in America," the miniseries adaptation of Tony Kushner's Pulitzer Prize-winning play about the 1980s AIDS crisis, won seven Emmys, includ­ing outstanding miniseries and acting trophies for Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Mary-Louise Parker and Jeffrey Wright. Kushner received a best writing award and Mike Nichols won best director. 
The two-part series proved a record breaker. With the four Emmys won Sept. 12 at the creative arts awards, it exceeded the nine awards "Roots" won in 1977 to become the most honored m1mseries _ and matched the·11 won by "Eleanor and Franklin" in 1976, the most for any program in one season. 
Streep praised Kushner's words as the reason for the TV miniseries' sue-cess. 

"The bravest thing in the world is that writer who sits alone in a room and works out his grief, his rage, his imagi­nation and his deep desire to make peo­ple laugh. And he makes a work of art that then transforms the world with the truth, because that's all we want, you know," she said. "It's all we need." 
The edgier programming on cable has come to overshadow the more restrained fare found on network televi­sion, where language, violence and sex are dealt with obliquely. 
HBO received a dominant 32 awards. Fox collected 10, followed by NBC with 8, ABC and PBS with seven each and CBS with two.

Chicago splits doubleheader against Florida 

Cubs win game one, remain half-game back of the Giants 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -The Chicago Cubs' 24-hour visit to Miami included a brief stay atop the NL wild­card standings. Then they lost their lead because they couldn't beat David Weathers. 
The journeyman right-hander, making his first start in six years. limited Chicago to two hits and one run in five innings, and the Florida Marlins won 5­2 for a split of their double­header Monday. 
Mark Prior allowed just five hits in 7 2-3 innings and out­pitched Carl Pavano in the opener to help the Cubs win 5­1. 
With the victory in Game 1, Chicago climbed one percent­age point ahead of San Francisco in the wild-card race. But the Cubs ended the day where they started: a half-game behind the idle Giants. 
"We've been knocking on first place for a while," Chicago manager Dusty Baker said. "We'll keep knocking until we kick the door in." 
The Marlins, who had hoped to gain ground with a sweep, instead remained 4 1/2 games behind San Francisco. The defending World Series champi­ons have no games left against the four teams ahead of them. 

"Time's running out on us," manager Jack McKeon said. "Maybe it's not going to happen. But as long as we've got the least bit of life, we'll give it a run." 
Weathers (7 -7) showed the Marlins that anything is possi­ble. Pitching for his third team this season, he came into the game 0-4 lifetime against the Cubs with an 11.44 ERA. But he earned a standing ovation from fans behind the Florida dugout when he walked off the mound after the fifth with a 5-1 lead. 
"It felt good to go out there and do something to help, instead of sitting around collect­ing a free check," Weathers said. 
Rudy Seanez pitched out of a jam in the sixth, and Guillermo Mota and Armando Benitez completed the five-hitter. Benitez worked the ninth for his 44th save, a career high and the most in the NL. 
Florida ri"ght fielder Juan Encarnacion helped out his closer in the ninth with a leap­ing catch to rob pinch-hitter Todd Walker of a two-run homer. 
"I hate to say you'd almost rather strike out," Walker said. "But that was disappointing." 
Damion Easley had a three­run homer and an RBI double off Matt Clement (9-13). Michael Barrett hit his 16th home run for the Cubs, who were elimi­nated Saturday from the NL

Central race -even though St. Louis manager Tony La Russa refused to permit a celebration or acknowledge his team clinched the division. 
St. Louis has 97 victories. and the best Chicago can do is 96. 
The Cubs and Marlins would have preferred Monday off as originally scheduled. For the Cubs, the split came during a stretch of four road games in three days in three cities. Miami was added to the itinerary to make up two games postponed during Labor Day weekend because of Hurricane Frances. 
The doubleheader was the third for the Marlins in 11 days, and the grind has depleted their pitching while all but dashing their hopes of returning to the playoffs. 
"The last three weeks have been tough," McKeon said. "To go through what we did, no other club in this league has done it. And yet to be still bat­tling and fighting and thinking we've got a chance, it's a credit to the guys."  
Announced attendance was 37,412, but it was a late-arriv­ing crowd. Game 1 began in front of about 5,000 spectators, many of them blue-clad fans who did plenty of cheering as Chicago took a 4-1 lead with three runs in the second against Pavano (17-7). 
Corey Patterson's two-run double put the Cubs ahead to stay, and Prior (6-4) beat Florida for the second time in 10 days. He threw a season­high 129 pitches on an 84­degree afternoon. 
''I'm finally hitting my stride and pitching up to my capabili­ty," said Prior, who missed the first two months of the season with a sore right Achilles' ten­don. "It was fun to go out there and get it done." 
Prior gave up a run in the first but didn't allow a runner to reach third after that. He struck out nine and walked one. 
"A very impressive perform­ance," Baker said. "That's what you like to see this time of year in the stretch run." 
Baker held Sammy Sosa and two other regulars out of the lineup in the opener, but the Cubs still got 16 hits. Pavano gave up five runs and 12 hits in six innings and lost his second start in a row. 
"I guess he's entitled to a cou­ple of mediocre ones," McKeon said. 
In the. nightcap, Easley's first­inning homer caromed off the screen attached to the left-field foul pole. 
"You don't like to make it that close, but you take it," he said. 
Florida made it 5-1 in the third on RBI doubles from Miguel Cabrera and Easley, ending Clement's afternoon after just 2 1-3 innings. The right-hander is 2-9 in his past 17 starts. Cardinals 7, Brewers 4

AP Philadelphia Eagles receiver Terrell Owens dives past Minnesota Vikings cornerback Antoine Winfield at the end of a 45-yard touchdown In the fourth quarter of the Eagles' 27-16 victory. 

McNabb, Eagles dispose of VIkings 27-16 
Associated Press 

PHILADELPHIA­Donovan McNabb didn't need much of Terrell Owens on Monday night. Daunte Culpepper could have used a lot more of Randy Moss. 
In a strange game featur­ing lots of long drives but not many points, the Philadelphia Eagles rode the running and passing of McNabb past the Minnesota Vikings 27-16. Of the four big offensive stars, only McNabb glit­tered, and Culpepper hurt his team badly with a fum­ble inside the Philadelphia 1-yard line. 
The Eagles' 2-0 start at the Line is a switch from last season, when they lost the first two games at their new home. The Vikings (1­
1) have lost 16 of their last 17 outdoor regular-season games. 
Neither defense was par­ticularly responsible for the lack of scoring. Time­consuming marches ate up chunks of yards, but the end zone was elusive for Minnesota until 3 1/2 min­utes were left -even though the Vikings had the ball for nearly 38 minutes. 
That was not problematic for Philadelphia because McNabb made several big plays in throwing for 245 yards. He passed for two scores, including the clincher to Owens for 45 yards with 7:40 remaining, and ran for another. 
Otherwise, Owens, who had three TD receptions in his Eagles debut last week, didn't have a big impact with four catches for 79 yards. 
Moss, whose costly offen­sive pass interference penalty was his most note­worthy play until a 4-yard TD catch in the final min­utes, did have eight recep­tions for 69 yards. 
But the Vikings kept bog­ging down in or near the red zone, in part because Moss was blanketed and 
Culpepper was sacked four times. Culpepper finished 37­for-47 for 343 yards. 
Morten Andersen, at 44 the league's oldest player, appeared in his 340th NIL game, tying George Blanda's record. The 23­year veteran's left leg looked plenty strong as he made three field goals, including a 42-yarder to open the scoring. But he was short on a 44-yarder with 9:14 remaining. 
Brian Westbrook domi­nated the Eagles' 72-yard march to a 7-3 lead on their first series. He was involved in six of the 11 plays, gaining 44 yards. 
IN BRIEF 

Former Irish back injures
shoulder 

IRVING, Texas -Cowboys rookie running back Julius Jones broke his left shoulder and is expected to be out about two months. 
Coach Bill Parcells said Monday he didn't know exactly when Jones, a second-round pick from Notre Dame, was injured during a 19-12 win over Cleveland on Sunday. 
"I'm sad to lose the player, sorry for him," Parcells said. 
Parcells said Jones probably will not need surgery. But if Jones is like­ly to he out more than half the sea­son, the team might put him on injured reserve. 
For now, Parcells said the team probably won't sign another running back. Eddie George and ReShard Lee are expected to get more carries in place of Jones. 
Jones missed the opener because of a rib injury during the preseason. Richie Anderson was inactive against Cleveland because of a knee prob­lem, hut Parcells expected him to return to practice this week. Wolfmeyer acquitted in 
Danton liit man case 
EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. -A young Missouri woman was acquitted Monday of charges she helped for­mer NHL player Mike Danton hire a hit man in a failed plot to kill his agent. 
The federal jury deliberated more than three hours before clearing 19­year-old Katie Wolfmeyer in the scheme, which unraveled in April when the man recruited for the hit notified authorities. 
"I knew all along that I was inno­cent," the young woman said, reiter­ating her claim that the FBI had twisted her story and used it against her. ''I'm glad the jury saw through all that." 
Prosecutors, who had argued that jurors should look past Wolfmeyer's sobbing testimony and her claims the FBI was plotting against her, did not take questions after the verdict but 
released a statement. De La Hoya faces uncertain 
future after knockout loss 
LAS VEGAS -Oscar De La Iloya predicted before he met Bernard Hopkins that the fight would define his career, and sadly it might. 
Knocked out by a punch to the liver, De La Hoya must deal with the fact he has come up short in some of his biggest fights. 
De La Hoya made at least $30 mil­lion to fight Hopkins, but the ques­tions afterward weren't about money. He has plenty of that, but he might be nearing the end of a once brilliant career. 
"I really can't answer that now," De La Hoya said. "You know us fight­ers have a love-hate relationship with boxing." 
Hopkins seems to have a much bet­ter future ahead, after doing nothing but win hut gettting little out of it until De La Hoya handed him a $10 million payday that he didn't have to work that hard to earn.

Washington hopes to improve on 0-2 start 
By PAT LEONARD 
Associate Sports Editor 
Keith Gilbertson did not script 
the season to begin this way. 
The Washington Huskies' 
head coach has started his sec­
ond season 0-2 after early 
home losses to unranked 
teams. 
Fresno State erupted in a 21­
point fourth quarter to take 
Washington's opener at Husky 
Stadium, 35-16, and UClA run­
ning back Maurice Drew cut up 
the Huskies' defense for a 
five touchdowns in a 37-31 
Bruins win Saturday. 
"(Saturday was a] terrible 
struggle," Gilbertson said. "We 
have a lot of concerns with 
what happened to our defense. 
On several occasions you'll see 
we'll run around a scheme 
when we're supposed to take 
them on." 
Drew ran for touchdowns of 
47, 62, 58,15 and 37 yards. 
"There's also the cases where 
[the UCLA offensive linemen! 
grabbed us and threw us on the 
ground," Gilbertson said. "If 
you look at the tape of the 
game, we have a lot of guys on 
the ground." 
Gilbertson was disappointed with every aspect of his team's defensive effort against UCLA. lie said players who made good tackles often had missed their original assignment and were out of position. 
But there is not a shortage of 
bright spots for the Huskies. 
"I think the offense played better," Gilbertson said. "We ran it pretty consistently ... we made some good decisions." 
Kenny James rushed 27 times for 133 yards, and Washington finished with 219 total rushing yards. But quarterback Casey Paus made the biggest differ­ence, going 13-of-28 for 200 yards and two touchdowns. 
"One thing I was pleased with was we did not turn the ball over," Gilbertson said. 
Paus threw three intercep­tions against Fresno State. The Bulldogs returned two of those interceptions -and a fourth quarter fumble -for touch­downs. But Paus played well enough against UCLA-putting up 24 first quarter points -to stay in Gilbertson's good graces. 
"Casey will get 75 to 80 per­cent of the snaps this week and 80 to 90 percent of those snaps will come with the first-team offense," Gilbertson said. 
The last two Husky teams to start 0-2 rebounded to have winning seasons and appear in bowls. But a 2004 turnaround becomes harder when the first road game takes a team to Notre Dame Stadium. 
"If you were 2-0, it'd be tough to go in there," Gilbertson said. "We certainly have a lot of respect for the traditions and game and atmosphere at Notre Dame. It's ... been a tough place to play for generations. 
"Now you've still got to play the game ... against a good team. And once all that settles down, it's our team versus their team between the stripes. But of course there's a special uniqueness about playing at Notre Dame ... I mean, come on, it's one of the great places in all of college football." 
Last season, Washington trav­eled to Ohio State and California for its two biggest road games. The Huskies lost in Columbus to Ohio State, 28-9, and California, 54-7. 

"We've had some tough road trips," Gilbertson said. "We've been to some landmark places. It would be nice to win one of those games."

Starting from its own 15 because of a clipping penalty, the Knights gave Stanford prime field position when defensive line­terback Matt Hughie said, "but they wore down our defense toward the end." 
Morrissey came into the game as the prohibitive favorite, com­ing off an undefeated regular season in 2003. The Angry Mob, who went 1-3 last fall, unveiled new offensive and defensive

"That was a play we haven't practiced much," said Hughie, who completed three passes for 64 yards and a touchdown. "We needed something they hadn't seen." 
The Angry Mob's 5-3 defense, however, was not nearly as effective as Milligan hoped at defending the Manorites' pow­erful backfield. Morrissey rushed for 114 yards, including 86 on 15 carries by Klein.

O'Neill had some quick suc­cess with outside runs by Brian Stein, as the Morrissey defense looked confused in the face of the fakes and reverses. 
"We get a lot of different looks out of the wing-T," Hughie said. "When the defense starts cheat­ing over in one direction, we'll flip it around and go the other way." 
However, the Mob couldn't turn the solid running into points, and a four-yard punt on their second possession trans­lated into a Morrissey touch­down. 
O'Neill closed within one early in the second half when Hughie completed a 48-yard pass down to the Morrissey 17-yard line and then connected for his team's only touchdown four plays later.

WOMEN'S INTERHALL GOLD LEAGUE 

Defending champion Badin beats Lewis 
By MIKE TENNANT, BRAD 
WALLACE and KYLE CASSILY 
Sports Writers 
Defending champion Badin started the year off right Sunday afternoon, defeating Lewis 7-0 in a rematch of last year's championship game. 
The Bullfrogs scored the only points of the game early in the second half when quar­terback and senior captain Stephanie Heath connected with Lizzi Shappell for a 10­yard touchdown pass. lleath ran in the extra point herself, and that was all Badin would

Badin captain 
Badin tried a balanced run­ning and passing attack, but the Lewis defense led by line­backer and senior captain Sheila Dawes was solid as a wall. 
"In the first half of the first game you always have lots of jitters," Heath said. 
Lewis also had trouble on offense and failed to take advantage of a struggling Bullfrog offense. The Chicks played much of the first half in Badin territory but were not able to strike pay dirt. 
After starting just short of midfield, the Chicks offense, led by quarterback Meg Bustin, drove deep into Badin territory only to have a pass dropped in the end zone. Two plays later. Bustin threw an Pangborn Phoxes Sunday afternoon. The key to the Whirlwind victory proved to be their passing attack. espe­cially late in the game. 

The Whirlwinds got off to a great start early with Lauren Osterhus' 60-yard punt return registering the first score of the game. 
"I got some great blocking on my return. Right when I got the ball, my blockers cre­ated a huge hole and as soon as I was through I was wide open," Osterhus said. 
After a failed point-after­touchdown attempt, both 
teams' defenses 
took over. ending 
ing game came 
alive. 

With about nine minutes remaining, quarterback Melissa Sands capped a 60­yard Welsh Family drive with a 40-yard touchdown pass to Lauren Hoeck. 
"Melissa threw a p·erfect pass. She hit me on the run, and it was all easy from there," Hoeck explained. "I think we started finding holes in the Pangborn defense and our offense just started to click." 
Sands connected with Lauren Prease from eight yards in the corner of the end zone late in the game for the Whirlwinds' final score, jump­ing to a 19-0 lead over the Phoxes. The Welsh Family defense lived up to preseason 
expectations, shutting down the Pangborn offense throughout the game. . 
Captain Mary Prendergast was not surprised by the defensive dominance of her team. 
"This was a testament to all of our hard work," Prendergast said. "Our other captain, Daphne Zeringue, kept telling us to play like it was a 0-0 game, and that's what we did. We're just going to keep playing that way for the rest of the season." 
Though disappointed with the outcome of the game, Pangborn captain Katie Murray feels her team will benefit from the experience. 
"The first game of the sea­son is always a learning expe­rience," Murray said. "Today, we saw a lot of things that we did well and some things that we need to work on. We're going to work on those things in practice and be ready when our next game comes around." Lyons 26, Howard 0 
For the second year in a row the rector of Howard must ruefully wear the cos­tume of a lion. After Lyons beat the Ducks 26-0 Sunday, the costume must be worn, as tradition is honored. 

Every year a wager is made that the loser must wear the costume of the victorious dorm's mascot. Howard has come up on the short end yet again. continuing an overall seven-game losing streak that began last season. 
Lyons came into the game very prepared. The Lions had practiced consistently for over two weeks and were confident in the team's ability. 
Lyons captain Traci Kazmerski named her team's top priorities as working together, concentrating on teamwork and taking the game more seriously. It worked for the Lyons as the team won handily over the Howard Ducks. 
The Ducks may have taken a tough loss, but that doesn't diminishes their hopes for this upcoming season. 
Ducks captain Callie Whelan is looking to improve by sheer numbers, as double the num. her of players came out this year than the previous year. She is also glad to have an experienced core of players being complemented by a very athletic and fast freshman class. 
The Ducks take on Badin Thursday at 8 p.m. on Riehle West Field. 
The Lyons face Pangborn Thursday at 9 p.m. on Riehle West Field as well.

put more points on the board," Irish quarterback Brady Quinn said. "When we got in the red zone costly turnovers just kind of hurt 
us," 
Even with the somewhat ugly win, it's a lot easier than talking after a disappointing result. 
"It's a lot better to clean up some mistakes after a win than after a loss," tight end Anthony Fasano said. 
Regardless of how they 


closed out the game, the Irish got the job done on the road, at night against a team that has usually dominated them over the past seven years. 
When it's broken down like that, a win is good enough. 
"Absolutely, we felt like we could have finished it earlier in the game rather than at the end. But a win's a win," run­ning back Ryan Grant said. "We're not satisfied with the way we win because of the way we know we didn't play our style of ball, but we're excited we got the 'W. "'

interception, ending Lewis' best chance of the afternoon. 
"We came really ready to play," Dawes said afterward. "We just got a few bad breaks and couldn't finish things off." 
The Lewis pass rush that had held Badin and Heath at bay in the first half was nowhere to be found after halftime. The Bullfrogs marched 60 yards down the field on their first possession of the new half. thanks to some timely scrambling by Heath and a couple Lewis penalties. 
On fourth-and-goal from just inside the Lewis 20-yard line Badin drew a pass inter­ference call, resulting in the ball being placed inside the 10 along with a fresh set of downs for the Bullfrogs. Shortly after, Heath connected with Shappell for what would be the winning score. 
"In the second half, we knew what we had to do; what adjustments we had to make," Heath said of her offense. 
The Badin defense made adjustments as well, and Bustin was not able to get the Lewis attack off the ground. 
Badin continues its season Thursday night at 8 p.m. against Howard on Riehle Field. 
Lewis' next game is also against the Ducks from Howard and is scheduled for Sunday at 5 p.m. on West Quad. Welsh Family 19, Pangborn 0

"Calls do not always go the way you want them to. but it happens to everyone," Huffer said. "Walsh came out ready to play and they had a great fight." 
According to the Wild Women, both the offense and defense bat­tled throughout the game. 
"Our defense was solid," Campbell said. "And our offensive line was fantastic." 
To begin the second half. the momentum continued for Walsh as an interception was made by Katie llesmond on the Cavanaugh 15-yard line. 
But the intensity quickly shifted to the Chaos as sophomore Brigette Sanchez sacked Campbell and gave Cavanaugh a chance to 

score with 10 minutes left. "Our defense was outstanding," Ruffer said. "They saved us." 
But the Cavanaugh offense could not take advantage of the opportunity and the game resulted in a tie. · 
Despite both teams failing to score, the fmal result did not rep­resent the impression Walsh left on the field. 
"They [Walsh] are a great team, they have come a long way," Ruffer said. "People underestimat­ed their ability and they shouldn't have."

"Since it was the first game, I'm fairly happy with the way we played," O'Keefe said. "We were missing a couple of guys, made a few mistakes, dropped a pitch ... it was the turnovers that really killed us."

Two interhall football rivals came face-to-face Sunday with . Siegfried proving victorious by a score of 13-10 over its fellow Mod Quad dorm Knott. 
"We arc disappointed," Knott co-captain Joe McCarthy. "But we learned a lot about [our team). 
"We expected to score some more," Siegfried co-captain Kevin Phipps said. "We changed things for last week after the scrimmage that we didn't like." 
Knott was first to score with a field goal by Eric Wooldridge. Before halftime, Siegfried scored a touchdown. and the extra point attempt was good to make the score 7-3 in favor of the Hamblers. 
After halftime, Siegfried recovered a fumble by Knott. This led to a second touchdown for Siegfried, but Knott blocked the extra point attempt. 
Knott scored a touchdown to make it a three-point game, but Siegfried ultimately prevailed with the close win. 
"We had some bad penal­ties," Knott co-captain Jason Creek said. "We had some slop­py plays. But our offensive line did a great job" 
Siegfried had to deal with the loss of their safety, in the game. A member of the offensive line took on that job. 
"He blitzed and knocked out the mouth guard of their quar­terback," Siegfried co-captain John Hughes said. 
The game was well attended by fans of both teams. whose animosity toward each other produced a lively atmosphere. 
Siegfried was very excited to have won the game. "I've been here four years and 
we  haven't  lost  to  Knott,"  
Hughes said.  
The Juggerknotts  are  not  

about to let this game bring them down. "We can't beat ourselves up over the game," McCarthy said. 
Siegfried takes on Carroll Sunday while Knott will face with St Ed's. 

Zahm 20, St. Ed's 6 
The Stedsmen never knew 
what hit them. 
Zahm came out to open the game with a new wrinkle in its offensive scheme. and it worked like a charm as the Rabid Bats cruised to a 20-6 season open­ing win. 
That wrinkle was the veer option, which the Rabid Bats ran to perfection in the first half. 
Zahm won the opening toss and elected to receive, and promptly rammed the ball down the throat of the Stedsmen defense. The Rabid Bats began their drive with a pass, then stayed with the run game as they marched 65 yards in a little under 10 minutes to take the lead. 
The drive was capped off by a 5-yard option, in which the Stedsmen overcommitted to Zahm quarterback Sean Wieland. allowing Corey Brisee to scamper into the end zone untouched. 
St. Ed's went three-and-out on its first possession, which allowed Zahm to manufacture yet another long touchdown drive, this time capped off by a short pass from Wieland to Brisee. 
Fullback Eric Tarnowski scored the third Zahm touch­down. 
The second half did not bring much life to the Stedsrnen offense as St. Ed's continued to struggle to move the ball down­field. 
T-hrough the first three quar­ters of the game, the Rabid Bats had only played eight snaps on the defensive side of the ball. 
"The strength of our team this year is our offensive line," said Zahm captain Kyle Jones prior to the game. 
The Rabid Bats' front five proved its worth Sunday, open­ing huge holes for the Zahm tailbacks all day long. 
After Zahm opened up a 20-0 lead. the Stedsmen finally got on the board. The St. Ed's offense ripped off a huge 55­yard touchdown run. Although it appeared that the Stedsmen tailback was forced out of bounds at the five, officials cred­ited him with the score. 
Zahm looks to run its record to 2-0 Sunday against Fisher. St. Ed's looks to get on the right side of the win-loss column against Knott in a match up of 0­1 teams.

game. I feel good about how we're playing at ~he moment. 
"The team chemistry is improving with each game, and we're doing good things -we just need to stick the ball in the back of the net." 
Saint Mary's hopes it will not face similar problems scoring in today's game. Albion's offensive attack includes four girls in the top-15 goal scorers in the con­ference, and four in the top 15 for conference points. Despite the Belles' strong defense, it will be critical not to fall behind such a strong scoring team. 
"They'll come with a talented attack team. We're just going to have to defend well," Mackenzie said. "It'll definitely be a pivotal game for us in terms of our MIAA chances, even though it's only the fifth game." 
The Belles will rely on their strong defense, featuring the flat-back-four system, to keep the Albion scorers in check. Although the Belles have played fewer games than most of the other teams in the division, Saint Mary's currently has the fewest goals allowed in the con­ference. 
"They're still trying to get in the groove with the flat-back­four. but they're doing a great job making adjustments," Mackenzie said. "I wouldn't be using it unless I believed they could play it successfully." 
With the majority of their schedule comprised of confer­ence games, the Belles know how important it will be to take home a win against Albion. 
"Having such a heavy confer­ence schedule, every game mat­ters. We just hope we can put it together with all the talent we have," Mackenzie said. "We need to come out relaxed, and if we play our game, the wins and losses will take care of them­selves." 
Besides the conference impli­cations, Saint Mary's looks for­ward to its most competitive test of the. season thus far. 
"I hope we come fired up from the kickoff." Mackenzie said. "If you're a competitor. you can't wait to play them. We can't wait to see how we stack up, to see how we play against them. If we play our style of soccer, it should be a great game to watch."

"That was very disappointing because we spent so much time on special teams for that to go out and happen it took a little bit out of the team," punt returner Carlyle Holiday said. "We are going to come back strong this week. We know spe­cial teams are a big part of the game and an area that can con­trol the game. 
"We've got a lot of work this week in trying to get big plays to happen for this team." 
Despite putting up a season­high 31 points, the offense was­n't immune from being critical of its performance. The unit committed three turnovers in Michigan State territory, includ­ing one at the goal line. 
Converting those opportuni­ties would have put the Spartans away earlier in the second half. Finding that con­sistency for 60 minutes will save the Irish' from having to make big plays later in the game, like the third-down con­versions the Irish made in the fourth quarter.

Belles get ready for Albion 
By RYAN DUFFY Sports Writer 
On the road to the MIAA championship, the Belles are hoping that today's game against Albion will be remem­bered more as a speed bump than a roadblock. 
Although the Belles remain undefeated in MIM play with a record of 2-0-1. Albion presents the first significant challenge visiting Saint Mary's for today's 4 p.m. game. 
"They [Albion] will be a good competitor. then~·s no way around. it," coach Caryn Mackenzie said. "Without ques­tion. this is the toughest game 
to  date in conference.  Our  
women  know it and  are  pre­

The Belles enter this game after numerous missed oppor­tunities prevented them from coming home with a victory in Saturday's game against Alma. 
"We played well on Saturday. even if we came away with a tie," Mackenzie said. "We did a lot of good things in the last

Fisher opens with victory 
By THOMAS STILES, ABBY 
RJCHARDSON and JORDAN 
BELTZ 
Sports Writers 
Freshmen are not supposed to have an immediate impact on the outcomes of games. Apparently. Pat Gotebeski did not get that memo. 
Gotebeski, Fisher's freshman quarterback, helped lead the Green Wave to a 13-7 victory over Sorin Sunday by complet­ing 7 -of-11 passes for 90 yards and a touchdown. lie also ran for 15 yards, including anuther touchdown on a quarterback sneak from the 1-yard line. 

"lnterhall football was a lot more competitive than I thought," Gotebeski said. 
Both teams had some trouble getting their offenses going, as the defenses dominated during the entire first half and most of the second. 
Fisher c,mly accumulated 150 yards of total offense compared to 110 yards for Sorin. The run­ning game for each team was basically non-existent the entire game, with neither gaining more than 50 yards on the ground. 
Fisher's defense was in the face of Sorin quarterback Collin O'Keefe all game. registering two sacks along with consistent pressure which resulted in three Otter turnovers, including a piv­otal fumble ofT a botched pitch late in the game. That last turnover set up the game-win­ning play for Fisher. 
"The defensive line was really the key to the game for us," Fisher captain and running back Andrew Pfister said. "They real­ly stepped it up with the pres­sure." 
Gotebeski threw a 30-yard touchdown strike through dou­ble coverage to sophomore wide receiver Pat Donnelly, who used his height to pull down the pass as he fell into the end zone. The catch was especially satisfying for Donnelly. 
"It was great to redeem myself after a few drops," Donnelly said. "It felt great to make that play. Pat just kind of threw it up there for me." 
The Otters were relentless however, stopping Fisher for the rest of the game and giving their offense a few more chances as time wound down. 
Fisher tried to run out the clock with a few kneels, but was forced to punt with about 10 seconds left. The snap was botched, however, giving Sorin four seconds to heave the ball into the end zone from 40 yards away. But Fisher's secondary knocked the ball down to seal the victory.

Walsh, Cavanaugh play to a scoreless tie 
Preseason No. 1 has difficulty on offense against Wild Women 
By DAN TAPETILLO and "KATE SERYAK 
Sports Writers 
According to the preseason polls, Cavanaugh was destined to be a top contender for this year's championship game. This was questioned during last Sunday's 0­0 tie against Walsh. 
Heading into the game, the Chaos were ranked No. 1 in the polls and were firmly aware of last season's 21-0 domination against the Wild Women. 
But these memories were soon forgotten when rants and cheers came from the Walsh fans proving the Wild Women came ready to play. 

The Chaos did not have an answer for the Wild Women defense and had three missed opportunities to score a touch­down from the 10-yard line. ' Among these three attempts was a catch made by capt~n Jenny Nokes from quarterback Lisa Ruffer that was called out-of­bounds. 
"We had trouble executing offensively," Rufl'er said. "We've got to get our heads into it a lot more." 
Seniors Karla Bell and Amanda Borys led a Walsh defense that caused problems for the Chaos. 
In addition to Walsh's defense. Cavanaugh also had several ques­
