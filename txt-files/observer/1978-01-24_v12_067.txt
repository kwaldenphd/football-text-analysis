NLRB charges Notre Dame .with unfair labor practices 
Mike Jlklenour Staff Keportel' 

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has <:barged Notre Dame with unfair labor practices in connection with workers' attempts to unionize. A hearing has been set for Feb. 15. 
The charges, madt: last Friday by the NLRB, stem from an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charge filed last Oct. 31 by the Teamsters Local 364. 
The ULP alleges that the Uni­versity was attempting to stop the unionization efforts of its emplo­yees by subcontracting out its food services operations to SAGA, an­nouncing salary and employee (insurance) benefits in the midst of union activity, and threatening to subcontract its grou.ndkeeping op­erations to an outside firm. 
Thomas J. Mason, vice-presi­dent for Business Affairs, issued a letter yesterday t:xplaining the University's position in the matter. While the letter is dated Jan. 23, it responds only to the ULP charges and does not directly address itself to the charges made by the NLRB. 
The letter's basic assertion is 

that the University has at no time 
engaged in the acti,ities alleged by 
the Teamsters and the University is 
willing to substantiate this in public 
at an NLRB hearing. 
~ike Lawrence, assistant busi­

ness representative of the teamster 
Local 364, remarked, "I am de­
lighted by the NLRB's action I'm 
looking forward to the 15th." 
Joseph Duffey, NLRB field ex­

aminer investigating the charge, 
was quoted yesterday by the South 
Bend Tribune as having called on 
the University on Jan. 4 to "im­
mediately cancel its food services 
contract with SAGA and restore the 
food operations to the pre-existing 
conditions administered by the 
University." 
The article also said that Duffey 

stated that Notn: Dame "must 
agree to announce pay increases 
and other benefits for the purpose 
of lessening their interest in union­
ization and must not subcontract or threaten to subcontract any work," or otherwise discouragf: workers' attempts to unionize. 
Notre Dame refused to agree with duffey's suggestions, acco~d­ing to the Tribune. The next action of the NLRB was to issue last Friday the formal charge notifica­
tion of the public hearing. The hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m., Feb. 15, in the City-County Building in South Bend. In a Tetter dated yesterday and addressed to the faculty, staff and students of Notre Dame, Mason charged the Teamsters with block­ing the proceedings of the 21 groundskeepers attempt to act as a collective bargaining unit. 
Mason, in his statement, said that the University is "unprepared to receive the NLRB bargaining unit determination, but the Team­sters have decided to block the proceecdings." 
Mason stated that the Unfair Labor practice charge against the University is preventing the NLRB from making its determination. "The ULP," Mason asserted, "is without merit and the University intends to reject the charges through appropriate channels." 
At the NLRB hearing, the Uni­versity will present evidence and prove that the charges are false, Mason states. 
"The Teamsters merely need to ask the NLRB to proceed with the ULP processing, but the Teamsters will not allow this to happen," Mason continued in his statement. 
Lawrence admitted, ''The local union has not asked the NLRB to proceed with the Unit Determina­tion on the advice of our attor­neys," but did not comment on whether this had any connection with the consideration of the ULP. 
Mason, in closing, stressed that "the University is not afraid of dealing with the NLRB decision on a bargaining unit; it is the Team­sters who are causing the present long delay. 

1979 Carter budget calls for tax cuts 
Washington (AP)-President Carter sent Congress a 1979 budget yesterday calling for $25 billion in tax cuts, higher spending on de­fense, energy and education, but no big outlays for wholly new programs. 
Even so, the magnitude of the proposed spending, $500.2 billion, brought critical comment from some key members of Congress. 
"Iwould like to see us under $500 billion,'' House Speaku Thomas P. O'Neill told reporters. 
Rep. George H. Mahon (Dallas, Tex.), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, re­called that a $6 billion budget was considered unbelievably high in 1935, the year he intered Congress. Mahon applauded Carter's an­nounced intention of working with the private sector of the economy to reduce unemployment.. But he said 
accompanying proposals for spen­
ding and large tax cuts to stimulate 
the economy involve considerable 
risks and "the greatest risk ap­
pears to be inflation.'' 
The budget estimates $439.6 billion in receipts against the outlays. This would leave the government operating in the red by 
60.6 billion, only a little less than the estimated $61.9 billion deficit for the present year. 
Chairman Robert N. Giaimo (D­Conn.) of the House Budget Com­mittee, said the contemplated def­icit is "much too high in times of solid economic growth." 
Praising Carter for calling for restraints on spooding, Giaimo added, "It is now up to the Congress to commit i~_to similsu­
restraints, otherwise the deficit will continue at levels that will be impossible to defend before the 
Mardi Gras booth con­struction has begun, turning Stepan Center 
into a  builder's work­ 
shop.  The theme  of  
Mardi  Gras  1978  is  

"Expo N.D." Con­struction will continue until Feb. 3. The dealers will then man the booths until Feb.

American public." 
Carter reiterated his commitment to a balanced budget but acknow­ledged that the target date of 1981, which he set during his presidential campaign, might be missed if the economy needed more tax cut tonic during the intervening years. 
Overalll, his budget set spending $38 billion higher than the present year's estimated total, and receipts $39.2 billion higher. 
Chairman Al Ullman (D-Ore.) of the tax writing House Ways and Means Committee, who had al­ready called the administration tax reduction proposals excessive, questioned also the extent to which proposed tax tightening, projected to recoup some of the lost revenues would be approved. 
He said Carter "included $9 billion of pickups from reform, more than two thirds ofwhich is not going to happen." 
Mahon said he opposes "so called reforms which would hit most heavily on middle class America," including elimination of deductions for sales and gasoline taxes. 
O'Neill, however, said he thinks such reforms could pass in the House, since they involve rPlatively small sums for each taxpayer, though large amounts for the Treasury in the aggregate. 
He said Democrats always stood for employment, wages and a strong economy "and we are not going to sactifice those for in­creases in defense or any other." 
Alumni Board of Directors meets, .confirms resolution 
by Peggy McGull'e Senior Staff Keportel' 

The Notre Dame Alumni Board of Directors had "a very fruitful and productive'' meeting last weekend, according to John N. Cackley, executive director of the 19 member board. President Joseph B. McGlynn, Jr., an attor­ney from St. Louis, Mo., conducted all of the business sessions which ran from Thursday until Saturday, at various locations on campus. 
The Board, which meets three times each year, confirmed an earlier resolution to sponsor a picnic before this spring's Blue­Gold game, Cackley stated. The picnic will be for members of the senior class, Alumni Cub presi­~ents, and secretaries representing each class of alumni. 
The Board also approved a suggestion to invite these same class secretaries to campus the first week of May for a national meet­ing, the executive director con­tinued. 
Various speakers addressed the group during the four-day period. Thomas J. Suddes, coordinator of development staff in the depart­ment of Public Relations and Development, updated the Board members on the latest statistics and information on the Campaign for Notre Dame, the University's current fund drive. 
Fr. Joseph L. Walter, chairman of the Pre-Professional Studies, 
' explained his program to Board members on Friday. The featured speaker at a dinner Saturday night was Dr. Thomas P. Carney, a member of the University Board of Trustees. The University Chorale performed for the Boafd before Carney's speech.

ND Chemistry Professor receives rf!search grant 
Hemophilia is a familiar blood disorder, but it's only one of several bleeding diseases--one for each.. of the enzymes needed to form and dissolve blood clots in the human..body. 
Dr. Francis J. Castellino, profes­sor of chemistry, recently received a grant of $73,535 from the National Institutes of Health to study the mechanisms· of blood clot formation. He is doing origina1 research on the four coagulation enzymes--prothrombin and factors VII, IX, and X--which require Vitamin K in their functiopal formation. 
"By understanding the· basic mechanisms, the basic chemistry, of these factors, we can suggest approaches for clinicians trying to identifY specific blood disorders-­bleeding problems after surgery, for example," Castellino says. "And therapy depends on accurate identification." 
.... A biochemist who joined the University faculty in 1970, he also has studied the mechanisms of blood clot dissolution. His research group has established the existence i' and significance of two major forms ' of plasminogen, a precursor of the blood clot-dissolving enzyme, plasmin, a:s well as the chemical mechanism of plasmin formation from plasminogen.. 
Blood clots, called fibrin, are produced continually in the blood­stream for two reasons, Cast(Jllino explains. Fib!'in is D((eded as a template for building new tissue, and it also repllirs ruptured blood vessels and damaged tissiie. 
Bleeding problems occur when the body produces either too many clots or not enough, or when clots dissolve eithe·r too fast or not fast enough. The problem for the clinician is identifying the deficient clotting factor.

Motivating factor one: I enjoy abou. diamonds with any­who is interested. As a uate Gemologist, I've spent ' of my adult life learning about and other fine gem­stones. In fact, I even teach classes · gemology at a little University lca.mJ>US across town. So as long as persist in: (a) getting engaged, 
(b) learning, I will look forward to you about my passion. Motivating factor two: Sadly, students who purchase en­lgagelrnettlt diamonds wind up "re­Iess than full value for their lin've~;tmtent." Every year I come contact with students vho have victimized by "special sales" 
discounts'' on engage­diamonds that are nothing than eyewash. Now, since of you operate on something

bit of knowledge before you start shopping. Logic is a poor basis for an engagement, but a solid basis for selecting an engagement ring. \ Motivating factor three: I'm guessing that the more you know about diamonds, the more tempted you'll be to visit my Diamond Import Company. Whether you ultimately decide to buy from me or not, I will promise you that you'll know more about diamonds when you leave than you did when you came in. You'll know how they're classified in terms of quality and color, how they're priced, and why ~o seemingly similar !;>tones may have very different values. You and your chosen one will have full useage of my Gemological labora­tory and research library, and can make your selection in an atmos­phere of absolute privacy. 
So much for my motivations. If you're still skeptical, then perhaps you'll be curious enough to speak with me first hand. I'm at Diamond Import Company, in the lobby of the St. Joseph Bank Building in downtown South Bend, or by phone at 287-1421. · 
Next week, I'll look at diamond classifications systems, or "what you should tell the jeweler who offers you a 'real deal' or a 'perfect blue-white' diamond."

Marta Brace, nurse and mid-wife, will discuss the topic "Women and Health,"Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., -in Stapelton Lounge in LeMans Hall. The lecture is the second in the "Women's Awareness" series sponsored by St. Mary's student government and the Office of Student Activities. 
The purpose of the series, accor­

and feelings covering a wide range of images of women.'' 
She added, "These are not just lectures, but more like informal presentations that include ample time for discussion.''

·P_anel sayS diet prevents disease 
W ASHlNGTON (AP)-A Se~ate panel that incited an argument with the American Medical Association (AMA) and major food ihdustry groups is sticking to its advice that consumers can lessen their chances of getting killer diseases 'by chang­ing their-diets. 
The Committ~e on Nutrition yesterdayreleased the second edi­tion of its staff study, "Dietary Goals for the Unitf!d States," after making only minor changes from the earlier report issued a year ago. 
There had been speculation among critics of the 1977 report that the committ;;:e rwould with­draw some of its dietary recom­mendations but the major elements of th'at report remain in,tact. 
The new version again recom­mends that Americans decrease comsumption of processed sugars, eggs and salt. It suggests substitu­ting skim milk for whole milk and increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. 
The most important change came in a recommendation to decrease consumption of meat, a ,proposal that brought heavy criticism from cattle producers. The new edition changed this to "decrease consum­ption of animlll fat.'' This would allow for consumption of lean meats, but not su<:h foods as the thick, juicy steak. 
The report said that cancer, heart disease, diabetes and hyper­tension are associated with the rich American diet. 
I 

Committee Chairman George McGovern, a Democrat from the beef-producing state of South Da­kota, endorsed the second edition despite some misgivings from some other committee members. 
McGovern, the 1972 Democratic presidential candidate, said In a forward to the new edition that the recommendations are ''based on current scientific evidence and provide guidance for making per­sonal decisions about one's diet." He said the 124 page report offers ''nutrition knowledge with which Americans can begin to take repon­sibjlity for maintaining their health· and reducing their risk of illness." 
In a9dition to cattl(! producers, the first report was criticized by egg producers , sugar interests and the canning and dairy indus-· tries. 
However, the broadest attack came from the AMA, which said there is no proof that diet is related to disease. It also said that changing American eating habits might lead to economic dislocation. 
The AMA said, ''Insufficient evidence exists at this time to support the need for or the benefit from major changes in 1the national diet as proposed." 
The medical association said the relationship between diet and deaths from heart dise21se is "sug­gestive, fragmentary and even conflicting." The links between diet and cancer of the colon and breast cancer are "very tenuous," it s~tid. And it said thert: is no proof ''salt consumption is a major factor in causing hypertension.'' 
However, many nutri1tionists and health professionals endorsed the dietary goals. 
Community Nutrition Institute, a nonprofit organization interested in good and nutrition programs, said what bothered the AMA was that the recommended dietary goals "infringed on the do<:tor-patient relationship." Nutritionists con-

At Last, We Cheer 
It was a great day for the Irish Sunday afternoon when Dan Devine strode fearles­sly to center court. There were no boos, no jeers; in fact, the applause truly ''shook down the thunder.'' This was the head coach of football's Fighting Irish, the man who worked the magic of the Green Machine that started Notre Dame rolling to the National Championship. 
The spectacle of this lt$iversity' s head football coach dodging appearances at pep rallies and before alumni groups for fear of boos and cries of ''Dump Devine,'' has ­been an embarassing blot on our preten­sions to both sportsmanship and Christian­iy. Something is wrong when the basketball coach delivers the exhortation to victory on the eve of the Southern Cal game. 
Devine came to Notre Dame in the worst circumstances possible: under heavy attack in Green Bay, he was succeeding a tremendously popular coach, a coach with the animation and charisma that is not part of Devine's make-up. From all indication, Devine also met with something less than complete cooperation from his team. Several players criticized him openly. He was not well-liked. 
In a recent interview with Bob Broeg, sports editor of the St. Louis Post-Dis­patch, Nip lfeisenfels, linebacker at Mizzou under Devine, recalled: "As undergraduates, we scoffed at some things he said and were aggravated by others. lfe didn't really like him that much either, but Dan Devine motivated us and got us to really thinking that playing the g arne of the moment was the most important thing we'd ever do." · 
"So many of the things he stressed about life have proved out since I left the campus and rve found that he has done so much for so many of his former players who really didn't know he cared that much when he held them at arm's length at the time they were playing for him. 
lfeisenfel's Devine is unsensational, but inspiring nonetheless, undemonstra­tive, but still caring. He cared enough for the student body to help arrange a Cotton Bowl charter. And he cares enough about Notre Dame to want to stay, despite the tension of the past three years. , 
It won't really matter that Notre Dame the football team won the 1977 National Championship ifNotre Dame the Christian community fails to give Dan Devine the understanding and acceptance that has been too long withheld.

--.--.--.--.-john borkowski 
Editor's Note: ''The Observer statements" mentioned In the fol­lowing oolnmn were made by Notre Dame Debate Connell President Jim Maniace and should have been attributed to him In the article. The Observer is happy to set the record straight on the Debate ConneD's One record. 
I have just read the article written by Tony Pace of The Observer on Oct. 17, 1977, proclaiming the return to national prominence of the Notre Dame Debate Team for the first time in thirteen years. Th~;:r~; is no doubt that this year's debate team is one of the better squads Notre Dame has had in quite a long while. I wish the team, and Bill Wians as coach, the greatest success, and hope that they do indeed surpass the best debate teams Notre Dame has seen. 
However, Tbe Observer's state­ment that Notre Dame debate has not seen national prominence for thirt~en years, and Tbe Observer's statement that the debate council has won no awards for the past ten years, are simply gross errors of fact which should not stand uncor­rected. Such inaccurate statements do great injustice to a large number of ovtstanding students who have, within the past thirteen years, achieved comparable or greater national prominence than the mem­bers of this year's team, albeit not with as much campus fanfare or publicity. 

· Notre Dame is one of the founders of what is today the largest debate organization in the country: DSR-TKA. Notte Dame has con­tinued to· produce debate teams that have been prolific in terms of both awards and over-all accom­plishment. During the past six years Notre Dame has done exceptionally well in tournaments with ninety or more co~peting teams, including: 
1971 
At Tulane, Notre Dame reached quarterfinals ·and received a fifth place trophy. 
1972 
At Tulane, Notre Dame reached semifinals, and received a third place trophy. 
At Northwestern, Tom Gies and Mike Connor won six and lost two, placing seventeenth. 
At Kentucky, Tom Gies and Mike Connor reached semifinals, receiv­ing a third place trophy. In the same tournament, Jack Keeney and Tom King won seven and lost one, and reached quarterfinals, receiving a fifth place trophy. 
1973 

At Southwest Missouri State, Brian Kelly and Jack Keeney won seven and lost one, reaching quar­terfinals and receiving a fifth place trophy. 
At Kentucky, Jack Keeney and I won five and lost three. 
At Emory, Jack Keeney and I won 
five and lost three. 
Other outstanding performances 
at tournaments having between forty and eighty schools competing have included placing several times , at Loyola, taking first place in 1972 at the Citadel, and taking first place in 1973 at Kent State Univer­
sity. 
Jeff Rajchel and Dave Hayes have yet to be outdone in their perfor­mance in 1973 when, beating national powers including Ken­tucky and Catholic Univ., they placed third in the country in novice nationals. That same year Jack Keeney and I each took outstanding speaker awards as well as the third place trophy at the Citadel, losing only to West Geor­gia, the eventual national cham­pions, after beating Tulane and Alabama. In the 1975-76 school year, Mark Zenger and Jim Man­iace capped a successful season by taking first place at an international debate tournament at the Univ. of Hawaii, defeating Oregon in the final round. 
Notre Dame has annually hosted a national invitational debate tour­nament which, in 1974 and 1975, attracted the largest number of prestigious schools it had gotten since the early 1960's. The debate council has always been active in community activities, frequently judging in state and local high school debate tournaments and accepting invitations to debate before audiences. My first contact with Notre Dame debate was watching an exhibi~ion debate between Notre Dame and the Univ. of Pittsburgh at St. Ignatius High School in Cleveland, Ohio. 
The above items do not come close to summarizing the past thirteen years of trophies won or promi­nence achieved by the Notre Dame Debate Council. The debate team has, over the past eight years, often been competitive with the best of the nation's debate teams, holding its own with schools having extensive departmental undergrad­uate and graduate programs in speech and debate, having quali­fied professors devoting their life­times to coaching debate, and giving full and partial scholarships to recruit the best talent from high school. Notre Dame relies on full­time students for coaching, has a budget far below most similarly competitive programs, ha5 limited research facilities, and has given no scholarships to incoming stu­dents. 
Despite all these odds, many Notre Dame students over the past thirteen years have gained hard­earned national recognition for forensic accomplishment. It would be a shame if all their achieve­ments were just left to a passing phrase in your article--to wipe those achievements out with a sentence or two is a travesty.

The special beat of 

Steve Calonje 
Dear Editor: 
We'll miss him in the Nazz and most everywhere else, too. He had such a "feel" and there were none better. Most of us knew him or at least his beat. It won't be the same without him. 
The coming jazz festival surely would have found him the best; it was his tum. Won't we dedicate CJF '78 to Steve Calonje, jazz drummer, victim of hit and run?

ND, Texas fans insulted in 

'Mav~ricks' 
Dear Editor: 
Reed King's article "Irish Mavericks in Longhorn Country" is the only bad memory I have of Notre Dame's bowling in Dallas. It is a shame that The Observer staff allowed such a distasteful article to be printed in a newspaper which is representative of the Notre Dame community. Having lived in Dallas for the last eight years, I found Mr. King's description of Dallas as a "cowtown" with "thirty million wetbacks'' to be obviously dis­torted, but his comments on the typical ND and Texas fans are what have caused my bad feelings and this reply. 
One of my older brothers and his 

wife graduated from the University word of Mr. King -for the benefit of Texas last year, and I would be of the good names of the University embarrassed to admit my associa­of Texas and Notre Dame students tion with ND if they (or any other and alumni. person for that matter) got wind of

Paris kidnapping 


Belgian noblernan abducted 
PARIS [API -Masked gunmen ambushed an automobile carrying Baron Edouard-Jean Empain in central Paris yesterday and abduc­ted the Belgian nobleman, who is one of Europe's richest industrial­ists and heads a giant conglomer­ate with interests in the United States. 
Hours after the late morning abduction, the 40-year-old baron's family still had not received a ransom demand, authorities said. There was no firm clue to whether he was kidnapped for money or for political motives. 
Police were mobilized nation­wide and at France's borders in the hunt for Empain, father of three and scion of a long powerful industrial family. 
Police said Empain's chauffeur was in severe shock after being 
Wilmington 10 membErs receive reduced sente~nces 
RALEIGH· N.C. (AP)-Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. yesterday reduced the sentences of nine imprisoned members of the Wil­mington 10, making all but one of them eligible for parole this year, but denied petitions seeking a full pardon for members of the group. 
Hunt's decision was contained in the script of a statewide television broadcast. 
The sentence of the Rev. Ben Chavis, leader of the group, was reduced to permit parole eligibility on Jan. 1, 1980-two years earlier than before the governor's action. 
The sentence of Ann Sheppard Turner, the only woman' and the only white among the defendants, was unchanged. Mrs. Turner already is free on parole. 
Hunt's announcement was carried live from his Capitol office on nearly every television station in North Carolina. 
Chavis and eight other black men were convicted of fire bombing Mike's Grocery, a white-owned store in a black neighborhood of Wilmington, N.C., during racial violence in that port city in Feb. 1971. They also were convicted of conspiracy and other charges and received prison sentences of more than 20 years each. 
Chavis was accused by prose­cution witnesses of instructing others in the firebombing and drew the longest sentence, 25 to 29 years for burning and four to five years for conspiracy. 
Mrs. Turner was convicted on a lesser charge of being an accessory. 
"From all that I have learned in reviewing this case, I have con­cluded that there wa'> a fair trial, the jury made the right decision and the appellate courts reviewed it properly and ruled correctly," hunt said. 
"I have confidence in what our courts and judges have done. Accordingly, I cannot and I will not pardon these defendants." 
Several foreign governments, in­cluding the Soviet Union have called the case an example of human rights violations in the United States. Amnesty Inter­national, winner of last year's Nobel Peace Prize, has cited the 10 as "prisoners of conscience." 
Chavis was a field worker for the United Church of Chri~;t Commis­sion for Racial Justice and was sent to Wilmington to help quell the

Police, recounting what the chauffeur and other eye-witnesses told them, said Empain drove from his apartment building on a quiet, fashionable streetL paralleling the Avenue Foch at about 11 a.m. yesterday. 
A few yards away a small truck had been parked out from the curb. As Empain's driver tried to man­euver around it, a man on a motorbike suddenly fell in front of the car forcing it to stop. 
Another truck then roared up from behind, masked men jumped from the two trucks and the motorbike rider pulled out a revol­ver, police said. The chauffeur was dragged from the car, beaten and thrown into the truck. Three or four kidnappers piled into Empain's car · and sped off with the industrialist, the second truck following. 
The driver was released a few minutes later less than a mile away and notified police, who already had been alerted by an eyewitness. One of the trucks was found nearby and police determined it had been stolen two weeks ago.

Rumour is reality as Franconia College closes 


CONCORD N.H. (AP] -After 1 years of fighting financial prob­lems, bad publicity, and conserva­tives, Franconia College, an avant­garde school born in the tumultous 1960s, closed yesterday with hardly any warning. 
"We heard rumors Saturday and didn't get official notice until Sunday," said Pat Grady, 22, an arts major from Sayville, N.Y. 
"Today I'm trying to deal with it ...I'm hurting," she said. 
She had expected the spring semester to begin on schedule tomorrow. 
But from the time the school set up in a former White Mountains resort hotel in 1963, it had been fighting a losing battle, going through six presidents, surviving an attack by the state to revoke its certification, and weathering ad­verse publicity. 
On Sunday, the 20-member board of trustees decided the financial problems were insur­mountable, and voted unanimously to close and try to place the 300 students plus faculty in other schools. 
A formal news statement said that decreased enrollments, spiral· ing costs, deteriorating facilities and a long·term debt "have limited the school's flexibility." . 
Since 1968, about 75 colleges in the United States have closed, but it is unclear whether there is any trend in this direction. The number of colleges open has increased, and officials at two other experimental colleges say most of Franconia's problems were unique. 
Ira Goldenberg, the college's president, had said it was running at a deficit this year of j,140,000. Contacted yesterday by tekphone, he said its total debt anwunted to $1.3 million, and the fa, ~~lty had not been paid for December and January. 
"I don't think the e::p.-riment failed.'' he said, because in his 2 112 years as president the college had established new programs "that made educational sense." But he added "that we couldn't overcome the sins of the past," including an ultra-permissive image and ''a disastrous financial situation." 
When it first opened, the college had few friends in New Hamp­shire's conservative North Coun­try. It was criticized for its courses, which had no grades, and which along with more standard offerings included such subjects as draft evasion, women's liberation, prison reform, mountain climbing, carpentry and ~ourmet cooking. 
Among Goldenberg's innova­tions were a human services pro­gram for the elderly, a prison education program, and programs in which students became advo­cates for the poor in employment and welfare matters. 
Goldenberg said he hopes other colleges in the state will pick up those programs. He also said he does not know where he will go. 
Over the years, the college was raided by state police in efforts to find drugs, and was denounced editorially for transgressions rang­ing from sex on campus to com­plaints about dog-soiled dormi­tories. 
But John Lyman, a Franconia selectman, said yesterday that times had changed. "Ten years ago," he said, "there would have been people who would have said 'good riddance' or 'so what?' but that picture has turned around ... The college has been a plus.'' He said the town would lose financial­ly. 
Figures from the federal Office of Education show a fluctuating pattern for college closings since 1969 -as few as three in one year and as many as 13 -alongside a sympathetic neighboring colleges, tried to block a federal grant for a ogy professor at Harvard and Yale,

The task force, chaired by Vir ginia Davidson, a Rochester, N.Y. lay woman, includes Biblir.al scho­lars, theologians and spe· ~'!.liSts in counseling, medicine and tJ.e social sciences. 
The issue grew out of q · query 
posed by the New·York City presbytery, the local church gover­ning unit, asking the national assembly to rule in 1976 whether an acknowledged homosexual, otherwise qualified, could be or­dained. 
That assembly held that such an ordination ''would at the present time be injudicious if not im­proper,'' but set up the special task force to provide more light on the question. 
In effect, the task force majority said decisions about ordination should be left where they always have been with local congregations and local governing presbyteries having the duty of determining "the fitness of candidates." 
The report said the local units, if the recommendations are adopted, may take divergent courses on the matter. It said the policy would "threaten the unity" of the church "only if we allow it to undennine our common ultimate loyalty to Jesus Christ." 
In recent times, two ac­knowledged homosexuals have been ordained in U.S. churches, but in both cases, the steps were taken by local church units without approval of the denominations as a whole.

Vida's Blues 
============================================================================================ One Man's View
Spring training begins in four weeks and Vida Blue doesn't have a team. The Cincinnati Reds fully believe and expect Vida to be wearing a Reds' uniform in Tampa, but, alas, Bowie Kuhn has different notions. 
Yes, Bowie has once again taken it upon himself to uphold and preserve the  'best interests of baseball." He did it so wonderfully in the summer of 1976 that he probably feels it is his duty to do it now. 
So, a grand trial is currently being held in Bowie's New York offices. The chief culprit is Bowie's favorite owner, Charlie Finley. Finley sold or traded (depending on your use of the English language) Blue to Cincinnati for minor league first baseman Dave Revering and $1.75 million in December. And Bowie is afraid that this is bad for baseball. 
If the plot sounds familiar, you are obviously a baseball fan. Not more than 18 months ago . Kuh~ pr~vented Finley from disposing of sO?n-to-be free agents Joe Rudt, RoUte Fmgers and Blue for cash sums totalmg $3.5 · million. The sales weren't in the best interest of baseball. 
The fact that Finley was a businessman and was attempting to execute sound business sense in dealing the ghree players while he could receive something in return mattered not to Kuhn. Only that Charley Finley was disrupting the sacred structure of the game. 
The next logical question I can think of is, "Was Kuhn's action beneficial in upholding the best interests?" Well, Oakland had the second worst record in the majors this past season, fielding a team comprised primarily of triple-A stars. But, I'm sure the fact that Finley lost those three players and received nothing in return had nothing to do with Oakland's decline. It was probably a poor managing job. 
I guess it was in the best interests of baseball that Oakland lose six front-line players to the initial free-agent draft. After all, Oakland is such a baseball hotbed that it would readily support a team that couldn't win 70 games. And the fact that Blue wasn't a free agent and had to stay in Oakland certainly helped the team quite a bit on the field. 
Maybe Bowie feels that baseball is better off with a mediocre team in Oakland. Maybe he feels baseball is better off without Charlie Finley. But Bowie seems to have the wrong best interests in mind. 
· What about Vida Blue's best interests? Was it better for Vida to stay and Oakland where he could single handedly pull a team from the doldrums and lead them back to respectability? Or should Vida be allowed to bring his obvious talents elsewhere for better use? those are the questions the Almighty Kuhn is faced with. 
The irony of the situation is that Kuhn may be wasting his time. Blue 
has filed a lawsuit in California against Finley charging fraud. Blue claims that Finley signed him to a contract on June 15, 1976 under the stipulation that Blul' '"iould not be traded. One hour later came the attempted sale to the '{ ankees. 
Blue feels Finley acted as an agent for the Yankees and "conned" him into signing the contract. If the court agrees, Blue will become a free agent a Ia Catfish Hunter. Then, it will be time for Bowie Kuhn to discover "the best interests of Vida Blue."
