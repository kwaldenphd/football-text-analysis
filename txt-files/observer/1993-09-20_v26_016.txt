Ruling clears the way for Demjanjuk to leave Israel 
By ALLYN FISHER 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM 
Israel's Supreme Court cleared the way Sunday for the release of John Demjanjuk, set­ting aside appeals for a new Nazi war crimes trial after de­laying his departure five times. 
The ruling was expected to conclude a long saga involving the retired Ohio auto worker. He was acquitted July 29 of be­ing "Ivan the Terrible," a Nazi guard who operated gas cham­bers at Poland's Treblinka Death Camp during World War II. 
Demjanjuk was free to leave Israel immediately, officials said. But his attorney and fam­ily were working out details of his departure and asked that he be kept in protective custody. Demjanjuk's son-in-law and a 
U.S. Rep., James Traficant, D­Ohio, planned to leave Monday to escort Demjanjuk. 
Traficant said he expected Demjanjuk to be back in the United States before Friday. 
The ruling by Justice Theodore Orr was the sixth time the court has dealt with Demjanjuk's case since his ac­quittal, when a five-member panel said there was reason­able doubt about his identity as Ivan the Terrible but found that he had been present at other Nazi camps. 
Orr rejected appeals by Holocaust survivors and Nazi hunters who sought to have Demjanjuk retried on charges that he was at the Sobibor death camp as well as concen­tration camps. They had mounted an international search for Sobibor survivors who could identify Demjanjuk. 
Orr's ruling refused requests for a broader panel of justices to review evidence to see if a new trial could be justified. 
Israel's Attorney General 
Yosef Harish already had de­cided not to prosecute Demjanjuk further, saying the evidence was too weak and there was risk of double jeop­ardy, or trying him twice on the same charges. The Supreme Court needed exceptional cir­cumstances to overturn the attorney general's decision. Orr's ruling meant those cir­cumstances did not exist in Demjanjuk's case. 
Justice Ministry spokesman Etty Eshed said Orr also can­celed a restraining order that had kept the 73-year-old Demjanjuk in an isolation cell at Ayalon prison near Tel Aviv. 


Israel, Egypt to sign peace declaration within months 
By NEJLA SAMMAKIA 
Associated Press 
ALEXANDRIA, Egypt 

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and said "most, maybe all" Arab nations are ready to follow Israel and the PLO to­ward peace. 
Speaking to reporters after a two-hour summit with Rabin, Mubarak said he expects Israel and Syria would sign a declara­tion of peace within months. Mubarak said he'll try to speed their negotiations. 
"Every country in the area wants peace," Mubarak said with Rabin at his side. "Enough hatred and bloodshed and killing, and using our revenues for war. I can tell you most, maybe all the Arab world sup­ports the step forward for peace." 
Syrian President Hafez Assad, in an interview with an Egyptian newspaper, said he was angry that Arafat negoti­ated an accord with Israel se­cretly, but said Syria would continue peace talks with Israel. 
Rabin hastily arranged Sunday's summit at the Mediterranean resort to win support from friendly Arabs for 

Minister shot during church service 
Associated Press 
NORTH SALEM, Ind. 

A Methodist minister was fin­ishing his sermon Sunday when a woman shot him to death in front of his horrified congrega­tion and 13-year-old daughter, police said. A woman he once dated was arrested. 
The Rev. Roland Phillips, 36, of North Salem, was concluding the sermon before about 25 people at the United Methodist Church when he was shot three times in the chest, said Lt. Terry Brinker, a Hendricks County Sheriffs spokesman. He died on the way to a hospital. 
Brinker said Elizabeth Mayberry of Bloomington ap­proached Phillips during the sermon and asked to speak with him, but the minister asked her to wait until he was finished. 
Mayberry then stood next to Phillips until he was concluding the sermon, when she pulled out a gun and shot him three times in the chest, Brinker said. 
Authorities said a member of the congregation wrestled Mayberry to the ground while another parishioner took away the gun. A fourth shot was fired during the struggle, but it harmlessly hit a railing in front of the congregation. 
Mayberry, 36, was held at the Hendricks County Jail.She was expected to make a court ap­pearance Monday, Brinker said. 
Phillips, who was divorced, once dated Mayberry, Brinker said.But he added that police had no idea what prompted the killing. 
The minister's 13-year-old daughter, Rachel, was in church when her father was killed, Brinker said.

Women's forum to be held tonight 
By JULIE BARRETT 
Associate News Ediwr 

Providing an open forum for women as well as men to speak out about women-related issues and experiences at Notre Dame, and discussing ongoing efforts and new ideas to tackle some of these issues is the goal of "ND Women Speak Out," a project cosponsored by Graduate and Undergraduate Student Governments tonight at 7:30 in 101 DeBartolo Hall. 
The first part of the forum 
will feature speakers from dif­
ferent groups on campus, in­
cluding representatives from 
Cafnpus Alliance for Rape 
Elimination (C.A.R.E.) and Sex 
Offense Services (S.O.S.), to 
present their own experiences 
and efforts concerning 
women's issues at Notre Dame. 
Then the floor will be opened 
to anyone who wants to share 
their own experiences or con­
cerns. 

"We hope to find out what 
women are concerned about on 
campus by providing an open 
space for them to talk about 
these issues affecting them 
here at Notre Dame," said ju­
nior Katie Glynn, Student 
Government Women's 
Resource Committee commis­
sioner. "And we hope to raise 
awareness about these issues 
and possibly get their support 
for things such as the Women's 
Resource Center." 

She added, "We encourage 
men to come as well, because 
many of these issues don't just 
affect women, and resolving 
these issues will benefit every­
one."

INSIDE COLUMN 
Do S.U.D.S. officers serve and protect? 

Two Saturdays ago, I was at a small party at my friend's house on Navarre Street. There were around 30 people there. No one milled around outside. The music was not heard by the surrounding neigh-· bors. Everything was under control, and no problems were being caused. 
Then, before we knew it, four S.U.D.S. (Stop Underage Drinking and Sales) officers were knocking on the door, telling us that everyone had to leave, and had to show identification before leaving. Two more policemen were stationed at the back door to prevent anyone's escape. 
Sixteen students received citations that night for underage drinking, while the residents of the house were found in violation of a South Bend noise ordinance. 
This was a small party, with everyone know­ing almost everyone else at the party. The music was not loud enough to be disturbing; designated drivers were designated and stay­ing sober. Who were we harming? What prob­lems were we causing? 
The officers were upset because there was underage drinking going on inside the premis­es. This indeed occurred, but was it so bad that it warranted the Saint Joseph County Police to send two female officers into the party as plants, and then to have an additional six officers outside? 
Were we so harmful that the officers had to seek out crime, going into a house party that was disturbing no one? Mter the bust, one of the residents went around to his neighbors that night to see if the music had been too loud; every neighbor replied that they had heard nothing, and had in fact been woken up by the flashing lights of the police cars. 
Were there were no other more serious crimes occurring on a Saturday night than some kids drinking in a house, crimes which might have been prevented had eight addition­al officers been on the lookout? 
Actually, there were. Not three blocks from Navarre St. is the Lafayette Square apartment complex, a complex where one fifth (6 out of 
30) of the student apartments have been bur­glarized. This same night; while eight officers were otherwise occupied with some underage drinkers, an apartment at Lafayette Square was broken into. 
Which is worse, having people afraid to go down into their own basements in the middle of the day, to leave their homes for a half hour, or to have some friends drinking respon­sibly together? 
The situation at Lafayette Square has gotten so bad that a friend of mine has moved out of her apartment because she is too frightened to sleep in her basement bedroom. Yet rather than deal with this more serious problem, the police instead seek out harmless college drinkers who are relatively easier to appre­hend. 
The South Bend police force doesn't have to go into our houses to find something to do. There's already more than enough crime for them to handle.

New Miss America will help homeless 
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. 

It may be pursuing a new image, but the Miss America pageant hasn't left all of its beauty contest traditions behind. 
Newly crowned Miss America Kimberly Clarice Aiken took a customary seaside frolic in front of a pack of pho­tographers on Sunday. And, unlike her predecessor, Leanza Cornett, the 18-year-old Aiken said she likes to wear the rhinestone crown. 
One of the youngest women to hold the title, Aiken ­Miss South Carolina -bested 49 women to win the 1994 title Saturday night. 
"This has all been very overwhelming for me," she told reporters Sunday. "I am willing to accept the re­sponsibilities. 
Looking composed despite little sleep and a bad cold, Aiken said she wants to spend the next year working to help the homeless. 
"My main goal is to get homeless people off the streets and get people who may become homeless not to be in that situation," she said. ''I'd like to make the greatest difference." 
Aiken is founder and president of the Homeless Education and Resource Organization in her hometown of Columbia, S.C. She said she has worked with children who live in homeless shelters and transitional housing. 
As part of a new format for the 73-year-old pageant, contestants had to do their own hair and make-up and the dress code for the evening wear competition was re­laxed. 
Miss Georgia, Kara Kim Martin, 23, of Statesboro was first runnerup; Miss Ohio, Titilayo Adedokun, 20, of Cincinnati, second runnerup; Miss Oregon, Elizabeth Jeanne Simmons, 23, of Bandon, third runnerup; and Miss Virginia, Nancy Glisson, 22, of Williamsburg, fourth runnerup. 
Arnold had been vocal in the past about the few nomina­tions her popular series had won. Her co-star, Laurie Metcalf, won her second consecu­tive Emmy for supporting actress in a comedy, giving the 
show a total of three awards in its five-year history. 
Ted Danson claimed the Emmy for best actor in a com­edy series for "Cheers," the long-running NBC program which concluded this year. CBS' "Northern Exposure"-with a leading 16 nom­inations _also was shut out. In the category that pitted talk show competitors David 
Letterman, on the old "Late Night" NBC program, and Jay Leno of NBC's "Tonight Show" against each other, NBC's "Saturday Night Live" instead snuck away with 
the trophy for outstanding variety, music or comedy series. 
Veterans must change views ofVietnam 
KOKOMO, Ind. 
The men and women who served in Vietnam have been unfairly portrayed as everything from murderers and dope addicts, and it is up to veterans to set the record straight, Air Force disc jockey Adrian Cronauer said. 
"I never met a single murderer. never met a single rapist. I never met a single dope addict. I never met a sin­

gle baby killer. I never met a single closet peacenik or any ne'er-do-wells," Cronauer said in a speech to veter­ans Saturday in Kokomo. 
"What I did meet were a lot of honorable men and women who may not have been too happy about where they found themselves, but who were bound and de­termined to do their duty as well and as professionally as they could," he added. 
Cronauer, a communications lawyer, was the model for Robin Williams' break-the-mold disc jockey in Vietnam in the movie "Good Morning, Vietnam." 
The movie based on him was half true and half "Hollywood exaggeration," Cronauer said. Though he did teach English while he was off-duty, Cronauer said he never taught the Vietnamese in his class to swear. 
And he said there never were the bags of fan mail and hundreds of phone calls for him that the movie depicted. 
"I mean think about it. There aren't any phone booths out in the rice paddies -where are you gonna call from?" Cronauer said.

EAST ORANGE, N.J. 
A 15-year-old boy driving a stolen car was fatally shot by police officers who tried to ar­rest him and a passenger fol­lowing a brief chase, authori­ties said Sunday. 
Alquan Brown of Irvington was killed just before midnight Saturday after the 1989 Oldsmobile he was driving struck a metal post at a service station. 
The Esse.x County Prosecutor's office said Brown tried to flee as officers strug­gled to gain control of the car, and that three officers opened fire when he drove directly at one of them. The three were treated at a hospital for minor injuries. 
A 16-year-old Newark boy who was riding in the backseat was arrested, and authorities said he would be charged with being in possession of a stolen automobile and assaulting po­lice officers. 
A third person who jumped from the car as police followed it was being sought, said Ray Weiss, a spokesman for the Essex County prosecutor's of­fice. 
The shooting was under in­vestigation and the case will be reviewed by a grand jury, said First Assistant Essex County Prosecutor Peter Francese.

Canadian autoworkers approve Chrysler contract 
Associated Press 
TORONTO 

Chrysler Corp.'s Canadian employees overwhelming ap­proved a contract Sunday that creates new jobs, expands holi­days and raises wages 4.5 per­cent over three years. 
The results affect 10,500 workers at Chrysler's six Canadian plants. 
The three-year deal was hammered out last Tuesday just minutes before a midnight strike deadline. It marked the first time in six rounds of con­tract talks that Canadian au­toworkers have reached a ten­tative accord without going on strike. 
The deal calls for increases of two percent this year, 1.5 per­cent next year and one percent in the final year of the contract. Assembly workers earn an av­erage of about $15 an hour.

The union was expected to announce today which of the remaining two automakers will be its next target. 
The Chrysler deal provides for the creation of more than 600 jobs early next year by the addition of a third shift at the Windsor plant which makes the popular minivan and at a busy LH sedan factory in Brampton. 
The agreement gives em­ployees an extra three days off with pay, which combined with two existing floating days, gives them an additional week's va­cation. That provision alone will create 250 jobs. 
Chrysler's six plants are lo­cated in Ontario. Two are in Windsor where its headquar­ters are located, one is in Toronto, two are in Brampton and one is in Ajax, just east of Toronto.

Time announces major reorganization 
By DAVID KALISH 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

Time Inc. announced a sweeping reorganization Sunday aimed at cutting costs while positioning the company for future growth. 
The reshuffiing includes man­agement changes at Time Inc.'s core New York-based maga­zines, some staff reductions, and the creation of a new busi­ness to market company prod­ucts across a range of media. 
"These latest moves will en­able Time Inc. to expand its magazine, book and multimedia businesses while continuing to enjoy healthy earnings," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Reginald Brack Jr. 
The changes affect Time, Life, Fortune, Sports Illustrated, Money, People and Entertainment Weekly maga­zines.

Alcohol lobbyists battle over tax 
By JIM DRINKARD 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

Tensions in the alcoholic bev­erage industry have erupted into open warfare over which sectors of the business ---'-beer. wine, or hard liquor -should be taxed to help pay for President Clinton's health re­forms. 
The president of the National Beer Wholesalers Association last week wrote a letter accus­ing his counterpart in the liquor industry of mounting "an all­out attack" on beer that "has placed the common interests of the licensed beverage indus­tries in great jeopardy." 
NBWA President Ronald Sarasin told Fred Meister, pres­ident of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS). that Meister "has done more to damage the li­censed beverage industries than all the activities of our most avowed critics." 
The White House still had not reached final decisions Sunday on the precise mix of new taxes it would seek to finance the health care plan. A late draft called for $105 billion through the year 2000, and there were clear indications that a major part would come from a hike of roughly 75 cents a pack in ci-

sibility for financial perfor­mance while trying to improve the quality of each. 
Under the reorganization, new division presidents who oversee publishers will head Time and People magazines. Sports Illustrated already has a president. Fortune and Money magazines will share a group publisher. 
Staff reductions will come mostly through attrition, the company said. There were no estimates of total job reduc­tions, but cuts will be minimal, Time spokesman Peter Costiglio said. 
The moves come as the mag­azines struggle to recover from the industry's recent recession. In the first eight months of 1993, ad pages at Time maga­zine dropped 11.8 percent from the same period during the year before, according to Publishers Information Bureau. That compared with a 2.5 per­cent increase at U.S. News and 
garette taxes. Other revenue could come from a hit on alco­holic beverages. 
Clinton is due to unveil the plan in a speech to Congress on Wednesday night. 
Sarasin's Sept. 15 letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, was writ­ten in response to an appeal by Meister to Clinton not to focus any new taxes on hard liquor. 
In a letter to Clinton on Sept. 3, Meister told the president that "beer, not liquor, is the beverage of choice of the young and drivers." And he said a rumored proposal to single out distilled spirits for new taxation "would perpetuate a 'beer sub­sidy' that is not rational and that sends the wrong message to young people.'' 
Meister's letter was followed by a blitzkrieg advertising cam­paign calling a liquor tax unfair and pointing out that 42 per­cent of the price of a typical bottle of liquor now goes for taxes. 
The beer, wine and liquor in­dustries, like many relatively narrow special interests, have banded together over the years with cigarette makers to lobby against new excise levies -so­called "sin taxes" -on their products. 
But such groups also live in constant fear and suspicion World Report and a 2.8 percent decline at Newsweek. 

Ad pages at Sports Illustrated dropped 16.6 percent, Money fell 7.2 percent and Fortune fell three percent, PIB reported. 
Time Inc. also said it would develop and acquire businesses that fit into its strategy of mar­keting its products and services across a range of media outlets. 
Other plans include creating a national sales force to serve advertisers who want to place ads in more than one maga­zine. 
The management changes, which take effect Monday, in­clude: 
Time 
magazine Publisher Lisa Valk Long becomes presi­dent. Jack Haire, regional ad sales vice president in Chicago, becomes publisher. 

David 
Long, Sports Illustrated's regional ad sales vice president, becomes pub­lisher. Donald Elliman Jr. con­tinues as president. 


that their goals will be sold out when the time comes for the coalition to cut fmal deals. 
The alcohol-tobacco alliance, the Coalition Against Regressive Taxation, already hall been fractured this year by Clinton's signal that cigarettes would bear the brunt of new taxes to pay for health care re­form. 
Meister's letter to Clinton struck the most sensitive nerve of the beer industry. He pointed to the disparity between the taxes on an ounce of alcohol in the form of beer or wine, and in the form of distilled liquor. By that measure, liquor taxes already are far higher. 
"The long-held goal of the spirits industry to force up the taxes on beer and wine is now clearly exposed, and DISCUS has stooped to astonishingly low levels to accomplish its purpose," Sarasin wrote to Meister. Copies of his letter also were distributed to the NBWA's board of directors and its state executives. 
"Why DISCUS thought it was necessary to dump on beer and wine is beyond me," Sarasin said. "Why should the beer and wine industries continue to work with DISCUS on any issue when it has clearly indicated it intends to destroy us by dra­matically raising our taxes?"

Australia to be a republic 
Associated Press 
DUBLIN, Ireland 
Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating told Britain's Queen Elizabeth II that he hopes to declare his country a republic by 2001. 
Keating took the unusual step Sunday of issuing a statement about his formal audience with the queen on Saturday at Balmoral Castle. 
"I explained to Her Majesty that, notwithstanding the deep respect and warm affection felt towards her by the Australian people. there was a growing feeling that Australia should make the necessary constitu­tional changes to allow the ap­pointment of an Austpalian head of state," he said. 
The changes are needed to clarify Australia's identity as an independent nation, Keating's statement said, adding a refer­endum would be needed to ap­prove the constitutional amend­ments. 
Australia has been an inde­pendent nation since 1901, but the British monarch has re­mained its titular head of state as in other former colonies, such as Canada and New Zealand. 
The queen is represented in Australia by a governor-gen­eral appointed by the govern­ment, but many Australians be­lieve the country should have a resident, elected head of state. 
Keating said it would be ap­propriate for Australia to be­come a republic by 2001, the centenary of the federation of its individual states. 
Australia would remain a member of the Commonwealth, a 50-nation association of Britain and her former colonies, and would welcome visits from the monarch "as head of the Commonwealth and the Queen of the United Kingdom," Keating said.

Columnist finds 'Tarnished Dome' a convertient pretext to grind axe 
Dear Editor: 
In his column of Sept. 13, Kurt Mills appears to be trying -rather desperately -to rec­oncile his own deeply seated conflicts about the character of the school whose name will one day appear on his own diploma. 
His effort takes the form of rhetorical saturation bombing that indiscriminantly targets big-time collegiate football, the press, the Notre Dame student body, football fans and all oth­ers who, in his estimation, are not prone to endorse his unstat­ed but sufficiently perceptible conviction that the Looney and already been infected by the moral virus that, to his way of thinking, must necessarily attend major sports programs. Mr. Mills is resolute in his con­viction that "such programs, by their very nature, corrupt the educational mission of the uni­versity." 
Readers who may have only skimmed Mills' column might want to re-read it and to pay particular attention to the pat­tern of vocabulary he deploys. There is much to be inferred about him and his position from the semantic choices he makes. 
I offer a few especially perti­attempts at irony ("Lou Holtz ­AKA god"); and 4) a tendency to extrapolate in the most out­landish ways (case in point: his assessment of the supposedly deeper signification of the expression "We are NO"). 
The point is that Mills protesteth too much, and his rare homages to less strident modes of argumentation (end of paragraph five and the "may or may not turn out to be valid" with which he closes), do very little to reconcile the mean­spiritedness that subtends the main of his outburst. What is more, his determination to dis­tance himself from what he hoards of sports fans at Notre Dame, gets in the way of the analytical acumen he prizes, promotes, and which he sees as so severely wanting in the insti­tutions (press, University admi111istration, student body, Notre Dame/South Bend com­munity) that he is so quick to indict. 
Not once does he entertain the thought that the book itself may be severely flawed -in intent, interview technique and editorial manipulation; nor does he consider that Under the Tarnished Dome was a project designed for one basic purpose: to make money for Messrs. 

Schuster, in which regard the University of Notre Dame is the only viable prey. 
Have some, even many, Notre Dame supporters instinctively reacted against criticism of "their" school and team. Doubtless. For them, Notre Dame football has become an ideology and as with virtually all ideologies, there is ample room for misdirected ardor. I believe Mr. Mills has shown that he is no more immune to that brand of ardor than those he so soundly wants to spank.

Love Thy Brother 
Chile program promotes service with studies 

By ANALISE TAYLOR 
Accent Writer 

On the west coast of South America lies a newly developed and invigorating academic experience for Notre Dame and Saint Mary's undergraduates: a semester abroad in Sanitago, Chile. 
The Chile program was added to the foreign study sites offered by the Office of International Studies in March, 1993. This program is similar to those at other cities, yet it also has some significant, intriguing differences. 
One of these differences is that stu­dents participating in the program will live with Chilean families in Santiago, as opposed to living in a dorm with only other Notre Dame or Saint Mary's stu­dents. 
Also, students will attend the Catholic University in Santiago, which is also attended by Chilean students. 

The net effect of these aspects is that it ensures that a student will become immersed in the culture and society of Chile, according to Father Don McNeill, CSC, director of Latin American Studies. 
McNeill was also involved in another special aspect of the program, helping to develop a course entitled, "Approaches to Poverty and Development." 
For five credits, students in this optional experiential learning course work with impoverished youth Santiago, attend seminars to get an understanding of the realities of poverty 
"I think the hile progam is the most rigorous and rnqst fruitful because of the Catholic University of Chile. It's one of the top schools in Latin· America."

and development, and take classes about how religion, government and other groups have dealt with poverty and development. 
All participants take part in an orien­tation course of three weeks which includes intensive courses in Spanish conversation, perspectives on Chile and Santiago, and the history, culture, art, and politics of Chile. 
"I think the program offers a unique opportunity for students to enroll in courses with Chilean students at one of the best universities in South America [the Catholic University of Chile]," said Claudia Kselman, associate director of the International Study Programs. 
The program "also gives our students the opportunity to get involved in social 
service through our connections with the Holy Cross Fathers in Santiago," added Kselman. 
Zahm Hall senior Tomas Fernandez agrees about the merits of the universi­ty. "I think the Chile program is the most rigorous and most fruitful because of the Catholic University of Chile," said Fernandez, one of the first participants in the program. "It's one of the top schools in Latin America." 
Fernandez also described one of the unique aspects of his learning during his time in the Chile program. 
"Chile is in transition from a military government to democracy, so partici­pants will live the transition politically and culturally," he said. "It makes you struggle with the issues yourself." 
Going abroad may even answer stu­dents' questions about the Catholic faith, added Fernandez. "Chile is explicitly Catholic, and the experience could enrich the students' faith," he said. 

The first semester at the Catholic University in Santiago begins in early March and runs to July, with the second semester beginning in early August and ending in December. 
The orientation program takes place in the three weeks prior to the first day of classes. 
The cost of the program is un­determined, but has been a little less than a semester at Notre Dame, Kselman said, because of its connection with a program offered by the University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan. 
An informational meeting is planned for Sept. 21, at 6:30p.m. in room 125 of DeBartolo. Deadline for applications is Oct. 15. 
Interested students should contact Claudia Kselman at 631-5882, or Father Tim Scully at 631-7052 or 631-6580.

Kinder and (not so) gentler Irish romp 
Trio of backs do most of damage in second half 
By GEORGE DOHRMANN Sports Editor 
Freshman Randy Kinder seemed to hug every person outside Notre Dame Stadium. 
"This was a special game for me," said the East Lansing native, as relatives and friends engulfed him as he exited the locker room. 
It was a special game for all the Irish run­ning backs, as they combined for 283 yards rushing leading Notre Dame to a 36-14 win over Michigan State Saturday. Kinder shined the brightest, finishing with 94 yards on 12 carries. 
Kinder, Willie Clark and Lee Becton supplied the rushing offense the Irish lacked in its pre­vious two games, allowing Kevin McDougal to become even more effective through the air. The senior quarterback finished 17-23 passing for 185 yards and threw his first touchdown pass of the season. 
"We were much better offensively this week," said Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz. "Backs gave us a boost and I thought

Tight ends finally able to display receiving skills 
By JENNY MARTEN Senior Sports Wri1er 
Irish opponents saw another aspect of the Notre Dame offense on Saturday when Lou Holtz unveiled the tight end pass for the first time. 
With a group of three of the more tal­ented tight ends in the country, it had been a mystery to many observers why Notre Dame had yet to utilize one of the more effec­tive weapons from last year. 
In 1992, the former starting tight end, Irv Smith, averaged 13.1 Oscar McBride yards per catch with 20 receptions for 262 yards while then­junior Oscar McBride had 5 receptions for 29 yards. 
While apparently waiting for the quar­terbacks to mature on the field, the Irish used senior McBride, sophomore Leon Wallace and sophomore Pete Chryplewicz in purely blocking roles against Northwestern and Michigan, but against Michigan State their responsibil­ities were increased. 
When asked why he finally decided to throw to the tight ends, Holtz quipped, "I got tired of answering the question at the Quarterback Club every week." 
He went on to explain that it is never a conscious decision to throw to the tight ends. 
"The read takes you where you have to go. There was nothing said that we were going to go to the tight end. We've run the same patterns from all forma­tions and, basically, whoever happens to be in the right place is the guy that is going to get the ball," said Holtz. 
After the game, Chryplewicz admitted that it had been a long time since the

Kevin McDougal performed well." 
For the second week in a row the turning point in the game came on Notre Dame's final drive of the first half. Taking over near midfield with 
1:04 left in the period, McDougal hit tight end Peter Chryplewicz with passes of six and 18 yards. 
After an 11 yard completion to Mike Miller, McDougal hit Chryplewicz for ten more yards to the four-yard line. On the next play, fullback 1lay Zellars found a seam across the middle and McDougal hit him for the first passing touchdown of the season for the Irish, and boosted Notre Dame's lead to 16­7. 
"Those drives right before half, we just have a way of getting it in there," said Holtz. "We don't do anything special or diiTerent. We just wallow and slop around and end up there." 
Notre Dame owned the second half.

tight ends have been used as receivers, but was quick to hope for the trend to continue. 
"They threw to us five times and none of us dropped it. Hopefully, that's a start," said Chryplewicz. 
Irish senior quarterback Kevin McDougal was duly impressed with his tight ends. He threw five passes to them and all five were caught for significant gains prompting McDougal to promise after the game, "If they keep doing that, I'll keep throwing to them." 
The first tight end pass of 1993 came on a third down and six situation in the first quarter. McDougal dropped a floater over the line to Wallace who ran to make it an eight yard gain and a first down keeping alive a drive which even­tually resulted in a touchdown. 
The play was equally effective with 
1:04 remaining in the first half when McDougal used Chryplewicz three times en route to a quick Irish touchdown. 
During the 49-yard march, Chryplewicz picked up six, 18 and 10­yard gains. On the two long gains, the sophomore from Sterling Heights, Michigan displayed his bulldozer-like rushing style which sent defenders reel­ing. 
Holtz was pleased with his young tight ends. 
"Chryplewicz and Leon Wallace have been playing a lot of tight end because Oscar McBride had a bad ankle," said Holtz. "I thought Chryplewicz played well. From what I saw I thought he caught the ball well." 
McBride got his slice of the tight end pass pie in the fourth quarter when junior quarterback Paul Failla found him open in the middle for a nine yard gain. 
Because of the injury hampering McBride, the entire tight end corps has

All-Big Ten tailback Craig Thomas was held to only four yards in the second half after gaining 56 in the first thirty-minutes of play. 
The Irish offense scored on two Kevin Pendergast field goals and on a one-yard run by freshman fullback Marc Edwards. A twelve yard touch­down pass from McDougal to tailback Lee Becton in the fourth quarter con­cluded the scoring. 
Notre Dame's defense looked impressive against the run and pass, lapsing only on the opening drive and the final series of the game. 
The Spartans were able to march 74 yards on 14 plays on their first possession, taking a 7-0 lead on Thomas' one-yard plunge. Their offense fell silent from there, until Mill Coleman caught a 5-yard pass from Jim Miller with 14 seconds left. 
"I thought after the first drive and the last drive, we played good on defense," said Holtz. "We couldn't have communicated better." 
The Irish defense also adjusted to a confusing tight end motion that the Spartans were using, one they hadn't shown this season but used against Notre Dame last year. 
"It took us a drive or two to realize what they were doing, but after that we were able to adjust," said line­backer Pete Bereich. 
The convincing win went against the prediction that Notre Dame would suffer a letdown after last Saturday's upset win over Michigan. 
"We've been through that kind of thing before, and we wouldn't let it (a letdown) happen," said Bereich.

pant to display a tremendous amount of composure. 
Failla doesn't appear to have it. 

When the fans expressed their dis­pleasure with him Saturday, his classless postgame display made him look more like a whiner than a win­ner. 
Yet somehow he remains a part of the offensive game plan. 
"I felt Paul was our short yardage quarterback this week," Holtz said, explaining why he twice inserted Failla after starting quarterback Kevin McDougal had led the Irish inside the Michigan State ten yard­line. 
"I didn't mind as long as we got in," McDougal said. 
It is really nothing more than a slap in the face to take a quarterback out after he has directed a long drive and give his backup the opportunity to score. 
"You're good enough to get us this far," Holtz seemed to be saying, "but you're not good enough to take us all the way." 
With Failla nursing a sore thumb, McDougal was good enough to take Notre Dame all the way to one of its biggest upsets in years last week against Michigan. 
It wasn't enough. 

Against Michigan State, McDougal completed 17 of 23 passes for 185 yards and two touchdowns. 
It wasn't enough. 

He is securely rooted in the starting position, but Failla's shadow still hounds him, adding extra pressure to every play. 
The battle for the starting job began in the spring, when Holtz named McDougal his No. 1 quarter­back and Failla No. 1-A. 
Both were overshadowed by Freshman Messiah Ron Powlus when fall practice began, but his broken collarbone thrust the co-quarter­backs back into the spotlight. 
Through it all, McDougal has been the ultimate team player, saying over and over again that the quarterback who gives the team the best chance to win should be on the field. 
That's McDougal.

Holtz asks for depth and he gets it 
By GEORGE DOHRMANN 
Sports Editor 
Ask and you shall receive. 
Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz has been desperately searching for depth at the running back spots. After Saturday's win, he got what he was looking for. 
Eight different backs carried the ball, and the result was the best rushing performance of the season. Freshman Randy Kinder and former free safety Willie Clark turned in stel­lar performances in a rotation with starting tailback Lee Becton. 
The trio finished 1-2-3 in rushing, Kinder leading the way with 94 yards and Becton ripping off a 40-yard streak for the game's longest play from scrimmage. 
"They are all different kinds of run­ners," said Holtz. "They all bring something to the offense." 
Saturday each runner showed they can add more to the offense than just depth. 
Clark, who has flip-flopped between free safety and tailback since arriving in South Bend, may be the quickest and most elusive of the Irish but has failed to earn substan­tial time at tailback during his ca­reer. 
Saturday he finished with 37 yards on seven carries, caught an eight yard pass and also had a 30-yard scamper called back after a holding penalty. 
"It was good to get out there and get some carries," said Clark. "I see myself as both a tailback and a safe­ty, and today I was a tailback. Whatever the team needs me to do." 
Kinder didn't find his way into the endzone, but set up three of Notre Dame's scores with his breakaway speed. He hits the hole faster than the other two backs and is more of powerful runner. 
It was the first game that the fresh­

man back showed the fluid running style that made him one of the nation's top high school players in 1992. 
"The coaches stressed protecting the ball and I think I was worried so much about that I didn't just run nat­urally," said Kinder. "I gained my confidence as the game went on and I felt like I made some steps today towards becoming a good back." 
Kinder also had the motivation. Michigan State was his hometown team and he was ridiculed for not staying close to him after graduating from high school. 
"This was a very sepcial game for me," he said. "It was me against those greean and white jerseys." 
Becton remained steady, casually waiting for the blocks to form and taking what the defense gave him, which amounted to 76 yards on only ten carries. He is still the starter, but for now the three man rotation seems to be the way the Irish will lean in the remaining games. 
"The competition is good, it makes all of us work harder," said Becton. "It keeps the backs fresh. That type of rotation is really effective." 
Lost among the performance of the three tailbacks was a solid perfor­mance by fullback Ray Zellars and the first career touchdowns by fresh­man Robert Farmer and Marc Edwards. 
Farmer, who along with Kinder was slated as the Irish tailback of the future, carried only four times but amassed 16 yards. Edwards only got two carries, one being his one-yard touchdown. 
Zellars and Farmer combined with the top three tailbacks to give Notre Dame its best yards per carry aver­age of the season. None of the five averaged less than four yards per carry. Becton and Zellars also had a hand in the passing game, with Zellars adding a touchdown grab and Becton in on three pass receptions. 
"Coach Holtz told all the backs that we were going to get a lot of work," said Kinder. "We all seemed to do well and the line did a tremendous job blocking." 
The success of the younger backs may come at the expense of playing time for Zellars and Becton but nei­ther seems to mind. 
"It is our job to inform them of what they are going to face each week," said Zellars. "Things happen as the season goes on which the younger players are not used too. It is our job to make sure the under­stand what they are going to face."

For thousands of miles along the Eastern seaboard, the Ap­palachian Mountains stretch majestically, an enduring testa­ment to the beauty of the United States. 
Nearby. in the strikingly im­poverished rural towns lying within the shadows of these breathtaking peaks, there is another. more disturbing testa­ment being made about our country, a testament to the dis­parities between the rich and the poor, between the beauty and the ugliness of the United States. 
The Appalachia Seminar, run annually by the Center for Social Concerns every fall and spring break, tries to teach Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students about these dispari­ties. 
It does this by sending approximately 120 students each break to various states within the Appalachia region, where they participate in vari­ous activities within the com­munity, including home repair, clothing and food distribution, farming and children's day care. 
According to the Seminar Learning Agreement which ac­companies the application form, the goal of the Appalachia Seminar is "to introduce the student to the culture and social issues of the Appalachia region through experiential learning." 
This "experiential learning" 
comes in the form of students 
performing physical labor for 
the community, and in discus­
sions with members of the com­
munity and others working at 
the site. 
With 127 spots available and 
around 180 applications 
received each year, some stu­dents must be turned away each year due to space con­straints, according to graduate student Ilene Stanford, Appalachia Seminar coordina­tor. 
But, she added, if a student was turned down once due to a lack of positions, it is almost certain that that student will be accepted for a future seminar. 
Upon acceptance into the seminar, students will attend 

two two-hour orientation semi­nars at the esc. where students will be given background infor­mation about "what issues they will face and the culture they're going into," said Stanford. 
This October break, the 127 accepted students will travel to 11 different sites in Kentucky, West Virginia, Tennessee and Mississippi. 
Among the sites is a four-acre farm in Peace Place, KY. The farm is run by two Franciscan sisters, and aims to care for abused children who have been taken from their families; two to eight children live at the farm throughout the year. 
Students at this site will help in the maintenance of the farm and its buildings, as well as with a clothing distribution cen­ter run by the Sisters.

Saint Mary's soccer outlasts Rockford, 3-1 

By CHERYL GILLILAND 
Sports Writer 

The Saint Mary's soccer team captured a 3-1 victory at Rock­ford College on Thursday, over­coming a tiring bus ride and slow field conditions to post their second win in their first three games. 
"It was a tough game after the long bus ride," said Senior captain Mandy Eiler. "The field had high grass so the game was a lot slower 
.d$· than usual." Tom Van Meter 
Senior Megan Dalsaso knocked in the Belles' first goal twenty min­utes into the game with an assist from Maura Sullivan. 
Rockford scored unexpected­ly on the Belles six minutes later, tying the game at one. 
"We were pretty lethargic at the beginning of the game," commented Coach Tom Van Meter. "We know we didn't play as well as we could have." 
The Belles came back with full force the second half. Dal­saso scored again to begin the half with an unassisted goal. 
"We really dominated the second half," said Van Meter. "Rockford wasn't able to get a shot off on us." 
"Rockford's goal was really unexpected, but we were able to pull out of it during the sec­ond half," added Eiler. 
With four minutes left in the game, freshman Brigid Keyes scored with an assist from freshman Lisa Nichols. 
"We played well once we got ourselves together after the long bus ride," said Nichols. "I feel that we've worked well to­gether as a team given that we've only been working to­gether for the three weeks that we've been here." 
Eiler also feels that the team has come together well. "We played well despite a rough start. Our defense was better, but we're still working on it."

Braves pound lowly Mets to stay in control ofWest 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA 

Tom Glavine became the first National League pitcher in more than 20 years to win 20 games in three consecutive seasons and the Atlanta Braves battered the New York Mets 11-2 to maintain their NL West lead at three games over the San Francisco Giants. 
The Braves, winners of five of six games on this home stand, are 31-7 since Aug. 8, when they were 8 1/2 games behind the Giants. 
Glavine (20-5), the NL's first 20-game winner this season, went six innings, allowing nine hits, two runs, walking one and striking out four. Ferguson Jenkins was the last NL pitcher to win 20 games at least three years in a row, doing it six straight (1967-72). 
Expos 6, Phillies 5 
MONTREAL 

The Montreal Expos, down to their last at-bat against Philadelphia, got a two-out, two-run single from Wil Cordero in the ninth inning to rally past the Phillies Sunday and keep the NL East race close. 
Cordero's bases-loaded hit off 
Mitch Williams (3-6) moved 
Montreal back within four 
games of the first-place 
Phillies. 
A loss would've dropped the 
Expos six games back with only 
13 left in the season, but they 
were helped by a key error in 
the ninth. Montreal has won 22 
of its last 26 games. 

Giants 7, Reds 3 
CINCINNATI 

Matt Williams hit two more homers, giving him 10 in his last 15 games, and drove in five runs as the San Francisco Giants completed a sweep of Cincinnati. The Reds lost their ninth in a row. 
San Francisco arrived at Riverfront Stadium with an eight-game losing streak that ended its 123-day stay in first place and let Atlanta take a four-game lead. The Giants outscored the Reds 26-4 to end the slide and start making up ground. 
Marlins 2, Cubs 1 
CHICAGO 

Chris Hammond allowed four hits in 7 2-3 innings and drove in a run with a squeeze bunt, leading the Florida Marlins over Chicago. 
Hammond (11-11), who had lost seven straight decisions since July 2, struck out four and walked three. Bryan Harvey struck out the side in the ninth for his 45th save in 48 chances. 
Steve Trachsel lost in his ma­jor league debut, allowing two runs and four hits in seven in­nings with five strikeouts and one walk. Jeff Conine hit his 11th homer in the first inning for the Marlins. 
Blue Jays 10, Twins 0 
MINNEAPOLIS 

Toronto won its eighth con­
secutive game and opened a

The winning streak is the longest of the season for the Blue Jays.

a really funny comedy 
By BARRY WILNER 
Associated Press 
Yo, Vinny, way to go. You too, Eric. 
The Cleveland Browns, stymied most of the game, turned to backup quarterback Vinny Testaverde on Sunday. Testaverde turned their game around, replacing Bernie Kosar and leading the Browns from a 13-0 hole to a 19-16 victory over the Los Angeles Raiders. 
"Bernie is our starting quar­terback," Browns coach Bill Belichick said. "He had a little problem with protection. Vinny, on the other hand, scrambles around a little bit. That's what we brought him here for. He stepped up and did a great job for us today." 
Testaverde got plenty of help from Eric Metcalf, who re­turned a free kick 37 yards, then scored on a 1-yard run with 2 seconds remaining. The Browns had no timeouts when they called for the run, and Metcalf swept in untouched. 
"I felt good about it when they called the last play. I was a little surprised that no one touched me," Metcalf said. "This was a confidence-builder. We know now we are never out, we can come back." 
Kosar was lifted after strug­gling to an 8-for-17 perfor­mance for 71 yards. Testaverde finished 10-for-22 for 159 yards and guided the Browns on a 90­yard drive to make it 16-10. 
Raiders punter Jeff Goosett took an intentional safety, then Metcalf had his big return to the Los Angeles 45. Eight plays later, Cleveland .won it. 
Eight teams had byes this week -Miami, Buffalo, the New York Jets, Indianapolis, Chicago, Tampa Bay, Green Bay and Minnesota. 
Seahawks 17, Patriots 14 

At Foxboro, Mass., the Seahawks prevailed in a game between the top two picks in the NFL draft -Rick Mirer of Seattle and Drew Bledsoe of New England. 
Mirer, the No. 2 choice, was 12-for-16 for 117 yards and one touchdown before leaving with blurred vision in the third quar­ter. Bledsoe, the no. 1 choice, was 20-for-44 for 240 yards and a score, but was in­tercepted twice. 
"It's not fair to call it (a per­sonal duel) because everyone out there played hard," Mirer said. "I thought Drew played fine. I played all right, but the game is not just two guys." 
The Seahawks, up 17-0 early in the fourth quarter, received' 174 yards rushing and one touchdown from Chris Warren. Seattle won when rookie Scott Scisson's 54-yard field goal at­tempt bounced off the crossbar with 30 seconds left. 
Cowboys 17, Cardinals 1 0 
At Phoenix, Emmitt Smith came back from his long con­tract holdout and helped the champions to their first victory after two defeats. But it was Smith's replacement, rookie Derrick Lassie, who scored both touchdowns. 
Smith finished with 45 yards on eight carries in less than one half of action. Lassie had 60 in 14 carries and Troy Aikman was 21-for-27 for 281 yards. His favorite target was Alvin Harper with six receptions for 136 yards. 
The Cardinals (1-2) were held to 68 yards rushing. Chargers 18, Oilers 17 
At San Diego, John Carney set the NFL record for consecu­tive field goals at 29 with six against Houston, the final one for 27 yards with three seconds remaining. The Chargers are 2­1 and Carney scored all the points in both victories. 
The Chargers intercepted Warren Moon four times, with Junior Seau getting two. Moon was lifted late in the game, as was San Diego's starting QB. Stan Humphries. 
After Houston backup Cody Carlson directed the Oilers on a 53-yard drive to AI Del Greco's 27-yard field goal for a 17-15 lead, San Diego backup John Friesz moved the Chargers 7 5 yards before Carney's winning kick. 
"I was hoping we'd score a touchdown and I'd only have to kick the extra point," Carney said. "But we moved it down and got it close. That made it nice for me." 
49ers 37, Falcons 30 At San Francisco, Steve Young caught his own deflected 
pass to set up Ricky Watters' 2­yard TO run, and the 49ers (2­
1) handed the Falcons their third straight defeat. 
Young threw for three TDs, Jerry Rice ran 43 yards on a reverse for a score and Watters rushed for 112 yards. 
The 49ers withstood 192 yards rushing by Erric Pegram, starting for the injured Eric Dickerson. No one has ever rushed for more yards against the 49ers. Bobby Hebert added three scoring passes to Andre Rison for Atlanta. 
Eagles 34, Redskins 31 
At Philadelphia, Randall Cunningham threw his third touchdown pass with four sec­onds left as the Eagles rallied from a 21-10 deficit. All three TO tosses were to Calvin Williams, who caught eight passes for 181 yards. His leap­ing 10-yard reception lifted the Eagles to their third straight victory. 
"I just saw the two safeties, caught Randall's eye and he picked me up," Williams said of his winning catch. "We've been doing this for four years now and we're really relaxed in this situation." 
Washington's Cary Conklin, filling in for injured Mark Rypien, also threw for three touchdowns. Washington (1-2) got 154 yards rushing from rookie Reggie Brooks, including an 85-yard TO run. 
Saints 14, Lions 3 
At New Orleans, the defense is no longer resting for the Saints. New Orleans (3-0) ranked an unusually low 26th on defense heading into the game. But Renaldo Turnbull had three sacks, Rickey Jackson recovered two fumbles and the Saints held Detroit (2-1) to 165 yards. Saints rookie Derek Brown rushed for 121 yards on 25 carries. 
Former Saints linebacker Pat Swilling, traded to the Lions last April, played despite the death of his father Saturday. Swilling had only two tackles and jumped offside three times.

Impact game 
in an altogether new way 
By JIM DONAGHY 
Associted Press 
NEW YORK 

The Yankees called it destiny. The Red Sox said it was a darned shame. What it was, was one of the most incredible finishes to a baseball game ever. 
Players, fans and security guards were still buzzing about it Sunday, one day after a 13­year-old boy ran onto the field and saved the Yankees' pen­nant hopes. 
Pinch-hitter Mike Stanley had just hit what appeared to be an easy, game-ending fly ball to left field, giving Boston a 3-1 victory. 
But third base umpire Tim 

Welke was waving his arms 
wildly, indicating a timeout just 
as pitcher Greg Harris was 
making his delivery. After a 
brief argument by manager 
Butch Hobson, the game re­
sumed, and the Yankees scored 
three runs for a 4-3 victory, 
keeping them three games back 
of Toronto on the AL East. 
"A lot has happened this year to make me feel we might win it all," Stanley said. "It seems to be some sort of destiny that we win this division." 
Police wouldn't identify the fan because of his age, but they said he was was part of a church group from upstate New York and that he cried before he was released. 

The boy jumped over a short fence on the third-base side and started running toward second base where he was tackled by security guards. 
"He was frightened," said one police oificer. "I don't think he even noticed the Yankees won." 
In the first three games of the four-game series, 13 people ran on the field. The stadium secu­rity force, one of the largest in baseball, said it was consider­ing deploying more guards around the first row of box seats, but officials said Sunday it's virtually impossible to stop a rowdy fan who wants a moment of glory. 
It was the second time this 
season that the Yankees have 
won at home because of fan in­
terference. On Aug. 15, a 16­
year-old boy reached over the 
right-field fence to catch a ball 
hit by Don Mattingly for a 
game-winning home run.

the Irish not only due to who they beat but also because it was the culmination of the first weekend in which they played to their full potential. 
The team has coasted past its opponents this season without encountering any serious road blocks, yet every game it played seemed to be marred by occa­sional lapses in intensity. 
Irish head coach Chris Petrucelli became so incensed by this fact at practice last Thursday night that he dis­banded the team an hour early. He told his players not to return unless they were ready to play with the desire and the drive that were missing. 
The squad responded to the charge by trouncing rival Michigan State Friday night, 6­0. 
The Irish exploded in the first half with five goals, four which came in the first twenty min­utes. Daws led Notre Dame with an amazing two goal and three assist performance. 
"We played with our hearts, and with one hundred percent intensity," said Daws, who leads the team in scoring with 17 points. "I think every body just played to the fullest and gave everything they had."

"We were too excited," said Spartan head coach Tom Saxton. "Notre Dame is a great soccer team and they took ad­vantage of us." 
With her three assists, sopho­more midfielder Ragen Coyne broke a team record for assists in a season with eleven. Coyne, who was a second team All-record with at least fourteen games remaining in the season. 

"The whole team was on," said Coyne. "When you play to­gether like that, there's no way you're going to lose."

Ohio State rips Pittsburgh for third win 
corned by ... one of the worst teams in Pitt history. 
At least he wasn't greeted by hostile fans, like he was in 1988 when llhe Buckeyes were em­barrassed 42-10 by Pitt in his second game as Ohio State's coach. Some of the Buckeye fans who watched that rout yelled l[)bscenities and pounded angrily on his locker room door, suggesting Cooper was no Woody Hayes or Earle.Bruce. 
Funny how times, and teams, have changed. 
Now, No. 7 Ohio State is a big-time power again, a legiti­mate Top 10 team with speed -and talent and depth -to burn. And Pitt is a punching­bag shell of its former Top 10 self, a defensive doormat that other teams use to pad their statistics and their egos. 
"We don't have any players left frl[)m that team, so we didn't talk about that game," Cooper said after the Buckeyes' 63-28 romp Saturday. "What's the difference between now and 1988? We were inept that day as (Pitt) was today. It was the exact opposite of 1988." 

And for Pitt coach Johnny Majors, it's almost an exact du­plicate of the full-scale rebuild­ing job he mounted upon inher­iting a 1-10 Pitt team in 1973. 
The only difference is that liberal recruiting rules then al­lowed him to bring in dozens of new players immediately. Now, he must play mostly with the talent -or lack thereof -he inherited from former coach Paul Hackett. 
Hackett certainly didn't do him any favors, and neither did former athletic director Ed Bozik, who left behind a Top 10-loaded schedule that makes it almost impossible for a tal­ent-thin team to win. Or even compete. 
"I want to be here when Pitt football comes back," line­backer Tom Tumulty said after Pitt allowed 63 points for the second straight week. "I can't wait to be a Top 10 team again."

Volleyball coasts through Shamrock Invitational 
By TIMOTHY SEYMOUR Sports Wri1er 
Domination is an overused modifier most times, but there are those instances when it be­comes unavoidable. 
This weekend's Shamrock Invitational volleyball tourna­ment was a classic example, as the 16th 
ranked Notre Dame squad took it to each of its op­ponents, drop­ping only one game en route to the champi­


onship. ~ ., 
Behind a JaneUe Kaclan blistering attack that racked up 96 kills, the Irish breezed past Cal State Northridge 15-4, 15-9, 15-10, and then rocked William and Mary 15-6, 15-5, 15-12. After a brief lapse in the opening game, the Irish regained their composure and dropped 23rd ranked New Mexico 11-15, 15­2, 15-7. 16-14, in the finale. 
"Overall, I feel that we played fairly consistently throughout the weekend. We were able to play everyone on the roster. and we showed great persever­ance in the match against New Mexico," remarked Irish head coach Debbie Brown, whose team improved to 8-2 after the tournament. 
The New Mexico match was the one Notre Dame was most concerned with entering the tournament, and for awhile their fears seemed to be war­ranted. The Lobos confidently came out and took the first game, confounding the Irish with a series of difficult short serves and finesse tips over the net. 
"Their short serves really got us out of our rhythm, and we didn't respond well to the soft shots," noted Brown. "However, we made a good adjustment to that, and tried not to give them the chance to string points together." 
The effect of the adjustment was immediate, as the scram­bling Irish defense seemed to be everywhere on the floor in game two, closing down on the openings that had been so prevalent in the first game. Spectacular digs by Nicole Coates and Janelle Karlan, as well as the blocking of Julie Harris and Molly Stark, set the tone as Notre Dame's athleti­cism started to take control. 
"We started off back on our heels," stated Brown. "But our defense really got better. To 
play that kind of defense, you 
have to practice that kind of 
defense, and we work very 
hard on that. It takes all-out 
effort, and I think we gave 
that." 

As the defense turned 
around, the offense took com­
mand, embodied in the spec­
tacular outside hitting of Coates 
and Christy Peters. In a display 
of sheer power volleyball, these 
two took over the match, hitting 
Karlan's sets through blockers 
and down the lines, completely 
turning the tempo of the match. 
Peters, who was deservedly 
selected the tournament's most 
valuable player, time and again 
went up against two Lobo 
blockers and drilled home a 
kill, providing the spark the 
team needed. 
"We tried to focus on getting into the game. After we turned up the intensity, everyone got more involved," stated Peters, whose offensive dominance was a gateway to her teammates involvement. 
As she and Coates were pounding home kills on the out­side, Molly Stark established the inside game with a number of kills off the quickset, and Jenny Birkner got into the act, scoring off backsets from Karlan. 
However, in the tense fourth game, it was Peters who came to the forefront. New Mexico, led by all-tournament perform­ers Alicia Bergman and Laurel Luman, mounted a gritty come­back, but Peters answered every rally with a definitive kill from the side. 
"Christy had a good weekend all around," commented Brown. "When it's crunch time, we're going to her." 
This weekend, she had all the answers, and accompanied by all-tournament teammates Karlan and Stark. the Irish closed out their third ranked opponent of the year in convincing style, further show­ing they are ready to take the national spotlight sooner than later.

Seventh-ranked women's soccer scores huge upset 

The Observer/David Hungeling 

Star freshmen recruit Cindy Daws scored two goals and notched 'four assists in the Irish's two wins this weekend. 
Irish post record eleventh-straight win 
By BRYAN CONNOLLY Assistant Sports Editor 
The confident cheers of the Notre Dame women's soccer team filled the air yesterday afternoon after the Irish scalped the Tribe of William & Mary in what was perhaps the biggest victory in the history of the program. 
The seventh-ranked Irish won by playing with a level of intensity and determination that was unparalleled by the Tribe. They clearly proved they were a better team. 
"We showed that we can play with any team in the country, and not only play with them, but beat them," said Notre Dame head coach Chris Petrucelli. 
"It gives us confidence," noted Irish tri-captain Alison Lester, "because we weren't intimidated by them. We treated them like just any other team." 
Sophomore attacker Rosella Guerrero scored the lone goal for Notre Dame off a corner kick at the 49:11 mark in the second half with freshman midfielder Cindy Daws and junior midfielder Jodi Hartwig assisting. 
Junior Tiffany Thompson's corner kick was first headed by Daws into the crossbar. Hartwig then booted the rebound ofT Tribe goalie Maren Hojas and the deflection headed right to Guerrero, who headed it into the right side of the net. 
"lt was every body's goal," said Guerrero. "I just happened to be the one who put it in." 
Although the Irish only scored one goal, they dominated William & Mary in terms of scoring opportunities and time of possession. Notre Dame outshot the Tribe 18-8 and easily could have scored two or three more goals had luck been on

Men's soccer beats Michigan St., Evansville 
By MIKE NORBUT 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame men's soccer team made a twin killing this weekend, downing rivals Michigan State and Evansville to improve their season record to 4-2. 
In the Irish's 1-0 victory over Evansville yesterday, a goal from junior midfielder Tont Richardson with 6:52 to play in the first half proved to be the game winner. 
"In our game against Evansville last year, Tont left with a broken leg," said Irish coach Mike Berticelli. "It's a tremendous thing for him to come back and play as well as he did." 
Richardson's goal came during an Irish offensive flurry late in the first half. A corner kick by captain Mike Palmer had been booted away towards midfield following a scramble in front of the net. Defenseman Chris Dean drove the ball back into Evansville territory, where Richardson broke open and blasted a 25-yard shot past Purple Ace goalie Steve Hoogerwerf. 
Defense was the story of the contest, as the Irish were led by goalie Bert Bader, who collected nine saves for his second shutout of the season, and de­fensemen Brian Engesser and Dane Whitley. The addition of Kevin Adkisson, who had missed the first four games of the season, also helped Notre Dame to put the clamps on the Evansville offensive surge. 
"When we play Evansville, we expect a physical game," continued Berticelli. "Sometimes it's as much a war as it is a game." 
The physical nature of the game was evident in the number of fouls commit­ted. The Irish tallied 23 fouls, while the Purple Aces finished with 29. The Purple Aces were led by Brian Loftin and Marty Schroering, who each had three shots on goal. 
Evansville dropped to 2-4 on the sea­son, including a 1-2 conference record with its loss yesterday. The Irish are now 2-1 in Midwestern Collegiate Conference action. 
On Friday, the Irish fought off a tena­cious Michigan State squad to capture a 3-2 win on a Ray Prado goal at the 
32:44 mark in the second half. The loss dropped the Spartans to 3-3 on the sea-
