This Saturday the hlack and gold of Purdue will get no sympathy from a pair of !}oiler· maker alumni and thdr son. 
:\-1r. and Mrs. Fritz Kid will he on hand to cheer on their son Blair. as the Fighting Irish take the tldd against the winless Boiler­makers. 
"We went to a tew Purdue games when Blair was seven or eight," said the elder Kid, "when :\-1ike Phipps was quarterback. But there was never am· pressure ti>r Blair to fol­low in that direction. 
"Purdue never really recruited him as strongly as Notre Dame ·and Indiana llniver· sitv did." 
"I did consider going to Purdue," said Blair. "hut only hec;tuse it was an in-state school. Basically it wa.... hetween l.l'. and :"lotre Dame. I really didn't like Purdue that well." 
Blair is not worried ahout any split al­legiances from his parents. "Playing against my parents' alma mater doesn't hother me he­cause tht·y've turned their allegiance to Notre Dame. Dad really wants us to heat Purdue." 
Beating Purdue is on a lot ofpt:ople's minds, especially after last year's game, which the Boilermakers won in the closing seconds, IS-

The Irish Extra-Purdue 



Stopping the Boiler 
Irish can't let Scott Campbell establish the ground game !I 

By SKIP DESJARDIN 
Sports EditorEmeritus 
Last season, as the final seconds ticked away, Scott Campbell led the Purdue Boiler­makers to a come-from-behind win over the Irish. 
In 1980, Campbell came off the bench at the last minute to replace injured starter Mark Herrmann. He was 17-28 for 178 yards in that nationally-televised game. 
"Scott Campbell is an excellent quarter­
back," says Notre Dame Coach Gerry Faust. 
"He scrambles well and he isn't afraid to 
throw on the run. Steve Smith was the kind of 
quarterback who'd always run ifwe broke the 
containment. But Campbell is different. He 
can, and will, run. But he throws well on the 
run, and that scares us." 
There is little question that Campbell is the key to Purdue's chances this weekend. His ~uccess, however, may hinge -not on his arm -but on the runners behind him. 
The Irish secondary is still somewhat of a question mark. They must prepare for an aerial onslaught on the part of the Boiler­makers. If Campbell can establish a running game, he can keep Notre Dame's def<;nsive backtleld off-balance. They will not· be able to hang back, waiting for Campbell to throw. 
They will have to give up a half step, just in case the Boilers run. 
Play-action passes by Campbell could freeze Irish defenders just long enough to free up a receiver. And that will mean trouble for Notre Dame. 
Purdue is led by tailback Mel Gray. In two games thus far, he has gained 164 yards on 32 carries. Had Purdue been closer to Stanford or Minnesota, they might have been able to run more, and Gray would have even more im­pressive stats. 
But his running ability is impressive as it is. The junior college transfer earned JC All­America honors at Coffeyville in Kansas. He adds an element of quickness to the Boiler backfield that has been lacking in recent seasons. 
Gray is only '5-9, 16-t, but he's a durable, strong runner who can physically· handle a pounding. 
Joining him in the backtleld will he fresh­man power-runner Rodney Carter. The 6-2, 190-lh. runner is -li~e Gray -averaging over t1ve yards per carry. He complemt:nts Gray's styk, as well. While Gray h the spt:edster, the Boilers rely on Carter for the 
"must" yards. 

The Irish defensive lint: will have to play as well as the did last week to shut down tht: run­ning game. for the first time since 1974, Mich­igan was held to under I00 yards rushing. 
Kevin (;riffith, who sacked Steve Smith three times last week, will be chasing Campbell out of tht' pocket again. That leaves much of the burden for stopping the run to Mikt' Gann. Tht' sophomore lint:man was im­pressive in his most extensive action to date last week. Like all the front men, he must repeat that performance. 
There is more good news for the Irish as well. Tackle Tim Marshall, who missed time with a sprained foot, is listed as "probable" for this weekend. 
"We knew we had to be quicker and more physical up front," said faust of last week's game. "I think we've made progress in that direction. 
"But the key against Michigan was pressur­ing Steve Smith and keeping him from option­ing the way he likes to. Campbell presents an entirely different set of problems for us defensively." 
The secondary, which allowed Smith to pass for 186 yards last week, must be allowed to key on the pass. That means that Griffith, Gann and the other men up front for the Irish must shut down the Boiler running game.

Switch to tight end was his own idea 
.. 

By TIM DOYLE 
.\jwrts Writer 
Versatilitv and enthusiasm are great assets for an athlete to possess. Ma~y coaches would he pleased to have players with one or the other of these characteristics. Once in a great while a unique player comes along who is able to express both of these characteristics. John Swt'eney not only possesses versatility and enthusiasm, but seems to have a never-ending supply of both. 
After starting at fullback for three seasons. Sweeney, a 6-2, 21""~­lb. senior. began spring football practice at fullback, but soon started to spend time practicing at tight end due to the discovery ofa much-improved Larry Moriarty at fullback. 
Some players might be upset about losing a position at which they started 30 games over three· years. but Swet'ney is philosophical. "It was hard to handle at t1rst hut I have accepted it now. If Moriarty can keep up like Saturday, then he definitely deserves to be in there. I just want to play wherever l can help."· 
/ 

Coach Tom Lichtenberg, offensive coordinator, praise.~ Sweent'v's versatilitv, "John is so valuable to us because he is an excelln~t blocker ;nd can play fullback or tight end. Halfway through spring practice John appraocht'd Coach Faust and me with the proposal ofmoving to tight end. He is such a team player, he onlv wants what is best ti>r the team.' 
A p<;sition change can often prest'nt a player with adjustment prohlems. However, going from fullback to tight end b quite natural for Sweeney. He has the experience of a blocking back and has good hands. 
"Although he has had no prior experknce at tight end," Lichtenberg notes. "he has adjusted' extremely well." 
Sweeney has enjoyed the adjustment. "I like playing tight end. especially in this offense. Because the tight end sees the ball a lot. I teet it is somewhat easier than fullback because you don't take as many hard hits."

Skip Desjardin 
Last week was the tlrst time Sweeney played 
tight end in an actual game. "The tirst series I 
was in there I was so excited and nervous that 
I misrt"ad the defense a couple of times, but 
the next series I was alright." 
With Mark Bavaro out of action for a few 
weeks, Sweeney will take on a more important 
role. "We will use John as more of a primary 
receiver when he is in there this week -as 
opposed to a blocking tight end," says Lich­
tenberg. 
Swet'ney is also the special teams captain, 
another t'Xample of his versatility. 
As tht' lkertield, Ill., native approaches the ·end of his stay at Notre Dame, he realizes he has a :-vide-open future. "I plan to take the MCAT's this spring tht'n look at medical schools. As htr as prokssional football is con­cerned, I will just have to wait until spring." 
For now, however, Sweeney will follow in the footsteps of former teammate Pete Buc­hanan. Last season, Buchanan moved from ful· !back to tight end as well. The reason? There was already a superb athlete ahead of him in the fullback slot, and Buchanan wanted to play. He knew he couldn't heat out the man above him on tht' depth chart. So he made a change. 
That man's name" 
John Swt'eney. 
lk has come full circle in a short time. But Sweeney has lost none of the enthusiasm about which his coaches ra\'e. He's still out to do what he can -'-wherever he can -to help the Irish.

Library's trading post dedicated 
By BARBARA PI1TS 
News Staff 
"Trading Post No. 6", the recent replacement for the familiar "Moses" statue on the second floor of the Memorial Library, was ded­icated yesterday afternoon in a brief ceremony on the second floor lob­by. 
The subject offrequent questions and occasional jokes since its arrival at the beginning of this semester, "Trading Post No. 6" was an integral part of New York Stock Exchange history, having been in use on the floor for more than 50 years. 
John Phelan, Jr., current presidem and chief operating officer of the New York Stock Exchange, spoke at the ceremony. 
Comparing the Stock Exchange to the-University, Phelan said that both are recognized institutions in the United States today, and that, the Post is "reallypeople", as is the Uni­versity. 
Hundreds of people have been as­sociated with the the Stock Exchange, including many Notre Dame graduates, according to Phelan. These individuals have been involved in the "enormous and

Allied takes over Bendix Corp. 
NEW YORK (AP) -Allied Cor­poration settled the tangled takeover fight between Martin Marietta Corporation and Bendix Corporation late yesterday with an agreement to buy Bendix for about s I.9 billion and gain a significant stake in Marietta as well. 
The companies said Allied would buy the Bendix shares recently purchased hy :'vtarietta, and after­ward would acquire the rest of Ben­dix's stock in a merger, according to a joint statement. 
Allied hau jumped into the fight 

on Wednesday with an agreement to 
merge with Bendix and swallow 
Marietta, too. But shortly afterward Marietta bought 44 percent of Ben­dix's stock. forcing Allied to recon­sider its ambitious, S2. ~hill ion plan. 
Marietta would buy hack I9.I million of the approximately 25.5 million Marietta shares that Bendix had purchased under its contested takeover offer. Marietta would pay the same price that Bendix paid, S--tH a share, or about S9I 5 million. 
As a result. Allied would still hold the 6.4 million :\1arietta shares cur­rently held hy Bendix and not sub­ject to the huyhack agreement. the companies said. Allied said its Marietta holding would represent

Phelan hopes that "Trading Post No. 6" will become as special a part of Notre Dame as it was a part of the Stock Exchange. Phelan also expressed gratitude that "we (the University) had the foresight to in­stall the Trading Post and install Moses one floor below." 
Commenting on the recent bull­ish activities on the Market, Phelan sees the flurry of trading as a "harvest of spring." Phelan pointed out that experts say the nation has witnessed the bottoming out of the recession, with interest rates gradually dropping and controls easing up. The recent August­September peak has heen inter­preted as good news hy those who are currently unemployed, said Phelan, and he hopes that the "spring harvest" has not ripened too soon. 
Thomas Coleman, a I956 graduate of the University and a cur­rent member of the Exchange, provided the funds needed to refur­bish the Post and to transport it to the University. 
Coleman, who is a current mem­

ber of the ND College of Business

expressed satisfaction at being able 
to aid in providing a part of history 
for the University. 
Also speaking at the ceremony 

was Professor Edward Trubac, chair­
man of the Department of Finance and Business Economics. Trubac, a native New Yorker, was pleased with the adde.d touch of New York, and also by the fact that the "Stock Exchange represents tradi­tion .. .like here at Notre Dame." 
Trubac expressed surprise at the contrast of environments apparent in the harried world of the Stock Ex­change and the relative calm of the library. He revealed a bit ofpersonal disappointment at the location of the Trading Post, preferring that it be placed in the business building. 
Dean Frank Reilly, of the College ofBusiness Administration, offered a differing opinion when he said the "business building is really no place to put a magnificent piece and give it the attention it deserves." He added that the Trading Post deserves "maximum exposure," such as it will receive in the library. 
The Master ofCeremonies Robert Miller, director of university libraries, revealed that he was originally skeptical of the presence of the Trading Post, but is now "excited" hy its unique history. 
Kathryn Findling, president of the Finance Club, also present at the ceremony, said she was grateful to Phelan and Coleman for the Trading Post because it provides a under­standing of history for the students. 
"Trading Post No. 6" is one of seven posts currently renovated and on display at institutions throughout the United States. Two others are located at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington and Harvard Univer­sity. 



New York mayor loses inprimaries 
NEW YORK (AP)-Shunning the hrash, wisecracking style that helped make him a national figure, Mayor Edward Koch reflected yes­terday on his startling loss in the primary race for governor and con­cluded, "I tried my hestand my hest wasn't good enough." 
''I'm not going to engage in Friday­morning quarterbacking," the characteristically soft-spoken Koch said as he faced reporters in City Hall. About 50 municipal workers applauded as he entered. 
Although the 5..,-year-old mayor would not speculate on why he lost to Lieutenant Governor Mario Cuomo in the Democratic primary, his campaign workers did. Speaking privately, aides said they had-overes­timated the mayor's strength in the city, which he carried hy a fraction ofa point, not the I 0 points they had expected. 
They also speculated that the mas­sacre of Palestinian women and children in Beirut had a negative ef­fect on Koch, who is Jewish and has heen an outspoken supporter of Is­rael and its invasion of Lebanon. 
The advisers said a Playboy magazine interview in which Koch made disparaging remarks about rural and suburban life probably had little effect. 
They said Koch carried the subur­ban counties, as expected, and lost as expected in more rural areas. What the advisers were at a loss to explain was the mayor's narrow margin ofvictory in New York City.· 
The mayor, who wa'i re-elected with :s percent of the vote in I9Hl, got a hare 50 percent of the vote here in the governor's race. 
Koch, who had not lost an elec­tion since he was defeated in a state Assembly bid .20 years ago, wa~ rumored to have had thoughts ahout a vice-presidential hid in I9H4 ­had he made it to the governor's mansion in Albany. 

Koch refused to speculate about his future yesterday. ''I'm the mayor for the balance of three years and that's enough," he said. 
He offered his support to Cuomo, whom he heat in the I977 mayoral race, and said he would now con­centrate on running the nation's lar­gest city. 
"I want to make it very clear," Koch said. "I am not depressed." 
Cuomo took 670,804 votes, or 53 percent, to 5~7,7SI, or 47 percent, for Koch. 
In the Republican race, mil­lionaire businessman Lewis Lehrman swainpe(J former U.S. At­torney Paul Curran nearly 4-1, 45I,086 vot~s to 109,964. 
In other statewide races, U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan easily won renomination and will be opposed by Assemblywoman Florence Sullivan, who won a three­way Republican primary.

In what is believed to be the first such interview she has given since her hus­band's death, she says, "It is in the morning when I miss him most of all." "To wake up alone is dreadful. That was our special time to talk. Then, and just before we went to sleep," Mrs. Sadat told Express reporter Catherine Olsen in the family's sun drenched summer home in Alexandria.

Californiawill havea garbage crisis by 1987. when half of the state's dumps will fill up, a state agency warns. "The garbage crisis will cost each California family hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in the next decade," and cut yearly disposal capacity by 20 million tons, says Terry Trumbull, head of the Solid Waste Management Board. Alternatives to landfills, such as recy· cling, composts and "waste·to-energy" systems must be developed to offset dump shutdowns, the agency recommended in a report released Thursday. California now has the capacity to dispose of.H.S million tons ofsolid waste a year in 3S61andfills, the report said.

Purdue rates near top in mathematics, science 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Purdue University was among the nation's major research campuses to get high ratings in a report judging the schools' scholastic quality of math and science departments. 
The California Institute of Tech­nology was ranked No. I, either alone or with others, in three of six fields based on professors' .ratings of the institutions' "scholarly quality." 
Porter E. Coggeshall of the Na­tional Research Council, who was staff director for the study, said Purdue ranked in the top I 0 in ar­ticles published in scientific journals regarding chemistry, mathematics and statistics-biostatistics. 
Purdue also rated in the top ofthe nation's universities for the scholar­ly quality ofits statistics-biostatistics program, the study showed. 
The evaluations were based on a survey of I, I 55 math and science professors, or about 8 percent of all 
U.S. professors in those fields. 
Two other Golden State schools, the University ofCalifornia-Berkeley and Stanford, each held two No. I rankings, as did the nation's oldest 
university, Harvard. 
In addition to Harvard, the Ea.~t Coast was represented by Princeton, ranked No. I in mathematics, and the ,\ta.~sachusetts Institute of Tech­nology, which shared top hilling in chemistry. 
CIT led the pack in geosciences, shared top billing with Harvard in physics and w;L~ in a four-way tie for tlrst in chemistry with Berkeley, Harvard and !\liT

Israeli newspapcr~ questioned anew the ofticial Israeli version of events surrounding the refugee camp slaughter, which has been blamed on Lebanese Christian militiamen. 
The papers said Israeli comman­ders in Beirut knew by II p.m. Thursday, September 16-the tirst day of the ma.~sacre, that civilians were being killed. Israeli Deli:nse Minister Ariel Sharon has said the Is­raelis did not know the killings were going on until the next day, after which the Israelis intervened. 
Thejerusalem Post reported that the Israeli commander in Beirut received a message from a Christian Phalange leader in one ofthe camps,

On a separate ranking on the es­timated influence of articles in scientific journals attributed to the colleges' graduate programs in 1978-79, Berkeley was No. 1 in mathematics and statistics; MIT in physics; UCLA in geosciences; the University of Wisconsin in chemistry and the University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign in com­puter sciences. 
The rankings were among 16 separate measures produced in a two-year, 5500,000 study published Thursday with the imprimatur of four prestigious academic groups, the American Council of Learned Societies, the American Council on Education, the Social Services Research Council and the National Research Council. 
It was funded by the Mellon, Ford and Sloan foundations, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the Nation­al Academy ofSciences.

The mass grave unearthed yester­day was discovered near the Chatilia camp. Jean-Jacques Kurz, an Interna­tional Red Cross spokesman, said the

This brought to ~I~ the total number of bodies reported found by Red Cross teams searching piles of rubble at the Sabra and Chatilla camps. 
Lebanesc Prosecutor General Camille <ieagea, who is heading an investigation of the killings, said ';9-, bodies had been discovered thus far, however, and more than 2,000 people were missing. 
He said his tigures were compiled from all rclief agencies involved in the recovery operation. Kurz has said some refugees removed relatives' bodies before Red Cross workers arrived at the camps, and civil deti:nse workers had dug up other bodies. 
Relief workers say the exact num­ber of deaths may never he known since the mass graves believed dug by Christian militiamen have been ditlicult to tind. 
The slaughter prompted the Lebanese government to request the return of french, Italian and li.S. troops -the con'iponents of the peace-keeping ti>rce that oversaw the evacuation of Palestine Libera­tion Organization guerrillas from west Beirut Iasr month. 
The new peacekeeping force is expected to remain until the Lebanese authorities can assume to­tal control ofthe nation's capiral.

Israel's state radio yesterday said all Israeli forces will he out of west Beirut by tomorrow.

Role of conscience 

Dear Editor, 
I am sorry to see that thc: writing stylc: of :\1ichad Monk has hec:n so dc:c:ply affc:cted by the Dartmouth Re1ieu. Thc:re is so much in his article: in Thursday's Obsener that nec:ds addressing, hut I will limit mysc:lf to the outstanding issue, that of Bc:njamin Sas­way's decision not to registc:r with thc: Sc:kctivc: Sc:rvicc:. 
·,\1y hllhc:r wa,, a military officer for morc: than thirty years, and I've: rarely met a tinc:r man. I think one: can in conscience: serve: in the: armc:d l(>rces; howc:vc:r. registration with the Selective: Sc:rvicc: is not just signing a "name to a blue and white card" anymore: than marriage: is the signing of a marriage certiticatc:. To say such a thing hc:lies linle knowledge: of the rotc: of conscit:"nce. We: have no higher guide: than consckncc:; to be 
consckntious is our tirst obligation. 
You obviously disagree: with Bc:njamin Sasway's decision. I do not. Rather than accusing him of"dabhling in hallucinogc:nic drugs" or of hl'ing "extrc:mc:ly stupid," wc: should congratulate him for his courage:. Hc: has stood up for what he hc:ld to hc: right. c:ven to the: point of going to jail. We should all hc: hlc:~sc:d with ~uch courage:. Hathc:r than hc:tray his conscic:ncc: which told him to do the: will of the: Fathc:r. Our Lord died at Homan hands. 
So ,\1r. ,\1onk, I both caution you to hc: mort: sensitive to the rotc: ofconscience and ask you to refrain from such rash j udgmc:nts. You would hc: doing your readc:rs a st:r\'icc. 
Sincerely, Hrother Henedict, O.S.H.

John Fought takes Southern Open lead 
By TOM SALADINO 
AP Sports Writer 
COI.liMBUS, Ga. (AP) -John Fought, the I979 rookie of the year who quit the tour earlier this year in frustration, fired a 4-under-par 66 yesterday to take a one-stroke lead after the second round of the S250,000 Southern Open golf tournament. 
Fought, who had a 67 Thursday, has a I :\:1 total, one shot ahead of first round co-leader Bobby Clam­pen, who had a 69 Friday for a I :\4 total over the par-"'0, 6,79I-yard Green Island Country Club course. 
Both Fought and Clampett are graduates of Brigham Young Univer­sity. 
Fought, who won two tourna­ments in his rookie year and earned SI OH,OOO, has earned less than 59:\,000 in the three years since, including only S9,"'9H this year. 
The 2H-year-old, who abo won the I97"' U.S. Amateur, had tour birdies, including a 15-ti>Oter on the l-ith hole and a 10-footer on I 5, to take the lead in the battle for the S-i5,000 tlrst prize. 
Fought quit the tour in midseason after only eight tournaments and took off for four months before returning about eight weeks ago. 
"I just wanted to get away.! didn't touch a club for two months. I just wanted to sort out my thoughts," said Fought. who worked for his father as an accountant and then resumed practicing ti>r two months before returning. 
"I knew I was going to come back. I just had to get away. I had put too much pressure on myself, and it was wearing me out," he said. 
Clamp~:tt, 22, a non-winner in two 
· years on he tour, had a round that included tive birdies and tour bogeys. 
"Today has shown me that there is room for practice. I need to get out and work at it," said Clampett, who went 9-under before bogeying three of the last tlve holes. 
While not winning on the tour, Clampett has tlnished secoqd .tive times. He was third this year in the 
U.S. Open and led the British Open ti>r two round.s. 
Two shots back at I 5"i were George Burns and Tim Simpson. Burns had a 6H and Simpson had a 69. 
Andy Bean, Wally Armstrong and Chip Beck were at I:'>6. Bean and Be­ck had 6-s; Armstrong had a -o.

Cards,3, Cubs 1 

~;T. LOl 11S (AP) -John Stuper fired a four-hitter and Ken Oberkfell's run-scoring intield single capped a two-run eighth inning, carrying the St. Louis Cardinals to a :\-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs Friday night. 
The Cards maintained their -i game lead over second-place Philadelphia in the National League East, as the Phillies nipped New York 2-1 Friday. The victory also reduced the Cards' magic number to five. 
Stup'er,  9-6,  posted  his  third  
straight victory  and  second  com­ 
plete game ofthe season.  

Tommy Herr opened the eighth with a single off Bill Campbell, :\-6. Lonnie Smith then sacriticed before Keith Hernandez was walked inten­tionally. Hendrick's infield single loaded the bases, Gene Tenace delivered a pinch-hit sacrifice fly and Oberkfell followed with his RBI single.

terbacks, he does admit to the hoopla and a show business atmos­phere surrounding the contest, which will attract a packed house of more than 70,000. 
Illinois has developed a tough defense to go with its gaudy offense led by Eason's passing, but White doesn't think there will he any pressure on his Illini. 
"The pressure is on Pitt," said White. "We were not picked to win the national championship. We welcome this game. It gives us a chance ro evaluate our program at Illinois." 
The Big Ten teams hope to im­prove on their 4-7 record this season against outside competition. 
There are three night games on the schedule with undefeated Min­nesota taking on Washington State, Iowa playing at Arizona and Indiana hosting Syracuse in the first night football game at home for the Hoosiers. 
Then there's the Northern lllinob at Northwestern clash. Northwes­tern hopes to snap "The Streak," which has reached a major college NCAA record of 5-I losses and ~orth­ern Illinois hopes to avoid being "The Victim." 
There will be a lot to evaluate in the I'CL-\-.\Iichigan contest. Some tecll'CLA, and not lOp-ranked Wash­ington. is the power in the l'ac-1 0. But how far has I CI.A come from Its :\:\-1 ! Bluehonnett Bowl loss to 1\lichigan last season' 
I'CLA pounded \X'bconsin 51-26 last wet:k under the passing attack of Tom RamseY who completed I­passes for 260 \·ards while 1\lichigan dropped a 2 5-I-decision at Notre Dame.

NEW YORK (AP)-Jack Donlan and Ed Garvey, the chief negotiators for the National Football League owners' group and players' union, will meet this weekend at an undis­closed site in hopes of settling the four-day-old strike, the Management Council said Friday. 
Jim Miller, public relations direc­tor of the owners' unit, would not reveal the make-up of the negotiat­ing committees but said he did not expect Pete Rozelle, the NFL com­missioner, would take part in the talks. 
Donlan, executive director of the Management Council, and Garvey, his counterpart with the union, agreed in telephone conversations to meet. It was the first major development since the talks broke off Sept.17, three days before the strike began. 
That strike has now wiped out 14

Major fOOtball showdowns on tap today 
By HERSCHEL NISSENSON andJOE MOOSHIL 
Tbe Associated Press 

The second-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers set many records while crushing New Mexico State 68-0 last week, but the only record they're shooting for today is 3-0. 
The Cornhuskers take a 2-0 mark to State College, Pa., for a nationally televised clash with eighth-ranked Penn State (CBS-TV, 3:30 p.m., EDT), which already owns a 3-0 log. The winner will have to be con­sidered a serious challenger for the national championship. 
Meanwhile, Washington, the No.I team in the Associated Press poll, begins defense of its Pacific-1 0 crown with a home game against winless Oregon, third-ranked Pitt visits No.l9 Illinois and fourth-rated Alabama hosts Vanderbilt in a South­eastern Conference game. 
Rounding out the Top Ten, fifth­ranked Florida plays host to Mississippi, State, No.6 Southern Methodist entertains Texas Chris­tian in a night contest, No.7 Georgia visits South Carolina at night, Missis­sippi meets No.9 Arkansas under the lights in Little Rock, and Purdue faces No.1 0 Notre Dame in South Bend. 
In the Second Ten, Army is at No.ll North Carolina, No. I 2 UCLA is at No. 20 Michigan, Stanford is at No.l3 Ohio State (ABC-TV, noon, EDT), No. 14 Arizona State is at California, Richmond is at l\lo.l 5 West Virginia, Michigan State is at No.l6 Miami, Fla., Missouri is at No.1 7 Texas in a night game and No.18 Southern Cal is at Oklahoma. 
Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne knows his team will have it much tougher against Penn State than a week ago when the Cornhuskers set NCAA records for total offense ( 883 yards), first downs ( 4 3 ), most rus­hing yards without a loss (677), and rushing first downs ( 36). 
"We'll find out a lot about our­selves in the next two or three weeks," Osborne says. "We'll play some great football teams in Penn State and Auburn, and Colorado might be pretty good, too." 
In two games, Nebraska has out­rushed its opposition l ,020 yards to 
190. At one time, this loomed as a duel between tailbacks Mike Rozier of the Cornhuskers and Penn State's Curt Warner, but the Nittany Lions are throwing the football this year and Warner has rushed for just 143 yards, while Todd Blackledge has thrown four touchdown passes in each of Penn State's three victories. 
"We're 3-0 and that's pretty good," says Coach joe Paterno. "We're getting better, there's more cohesion. We are more comfortable with the new offense, particularly with the passing game. We're getting better with the running game, but we're still making too many mistakes. We're not sustaining our blocks long enough to open holes." 
Florida, which owns victories over Miami and Southern Cal, swings into SEC play against Missis· sippi State, a game which Coach Charley Pell calls the start of the Gators' "second season." 
"We are encouraged from the results of the first two games but the challenge of what is to come is mighty big," Pell says. "There is no question that the first two games are important developments however. 
they will become iust individual and isolated success if the squad thinks they have now climbed the moun· tain. We can't let overcondfidence enter the picture. There have been other Florida teams which have got­ten off to some pretty impressive starts, but were unable to build upon that success." 
The Southern Cal-Oklahoma game will not he televised after all, since the NCAA got a stay of a U.S. District Court ruling which had overturned the new four-year TV pact with ABC and CBS. Oklahoma had sold the USC game to a local sta­tion for S250,000, but the stay killed that deal. 
Last year's game in Los Angleles was a memorable one, with USC pul­ling out a 28-24 triumph on 7-yard' pass from john Mazur to Fred Cornwell with two seconds left. Mazur has since trar.sferred to Texas A&M and sophomore Sean Salisbury is the new Trojan quarterback. 
"I see nothing different about this year's Southern California team ex­cept that they've lost a game," says Oklahoma Coach Barry Switzer: "They still have as many great ath­letes playing for them as any great team in the country and I'm sure that tlrst-game loss made them even more determined to win the remain­der of their games. 
"Last year, we played for the No.I 
spot in the nation, and even though 
that's not the case this year, it is still a 
very critical contest for both of us, 
mainly hecause we did lose our 
openers." 
Big Ten football tt:ams sur­

find a lot of the answt:rs today aftt:r 
the air is clt:ared from an ambitious schedule matching many of tht: na­tion's top-ranked teams and a num­ber of tht: more tutstanding individuals. 
Topping the slate will be the clash at Champaign, IlL, whert: third­ranked and undefeated Pittsburgh, led by Dan Marino, goes up against undefeated and 19th-ranked Illinois, led by Tony Eason. 
Marino and Eason are among the nation's more heralded quarter­backs. Although lllini Coach Mike White doesn't want to look at the

the Cincinnati Bengals' Monday 
night v1s1t to the Browns in 
Cleveland, called off yesterday by 
the league. 

As usual, the NFL's statement was 
a briefone, saying only that the game 
"will not be played" because of the 
players' strike, rather than referring 
to it being postponed or canceled. It 
was the 14th game to be scratched, 
the others being Thursday night's 
Atlanta-at Kansas City game and 
tomorrow's 12-game schedule. 

Rozelle had said he would be wil­ling to sit in on the bargaining, but only as a mediator, not a negotiator. That was his first substantive move in the dispute. Earlier he had confined his comments to saying he was staying close to the situation and would be willing to work be­
hind the scene to help resolve it. 

"Just as the players have a paid 
negotiator in Ed Garvey, the owners 
have their paid negotiator in Jack 
Donlan," Rozelle said. If both sides 
want me to help, I'll be glad ..." 

The first serious break in the uni­
on ranks appeared to be occurring in New Orleans, where Russell Erxleben, the punter and player rep­resentative of the Saints, said he was canvassing his teammates to see -how they felt about the union's 
wage-scale demands. 

Erxleben also said he had been reprimanded by Garvey for speaking out publicly about the union's demand that all players' base salaries be determined strictly by time of service, without regard to talent or position. 
"If the players want it, fine," 
Erxleben said. "If not, let the voices 
be heard. I am by no means wanting 
to mess up the whole union. We're. 
behind every team in the league. But 
we just want to find out ifeverybody 
still feels the same. 
Sunday college games a real possibility 
MISSION, Kan. ( AP)-The NCAA gave the go-ahead yesterday for live network tt:lecasts of college football games on Sundays during the National Foothall League players strike. 
The t1rst Sunday telecast could he Oct. 3. pending approval of the plan hy ABC, CBS and the Turner 1-lroadcasting System, said Tom Hansen, assistant executive director ofthe NCAA and director of its college tilOtball programming. 
The plan, designt:d to givt: the nt:tworks greater tlexibility in choosing games, was approved yesterday hy the NCAA Council. 
Hansen said the council had agret:d to limit tht: Sunday telecasts to just one game in any area pt:r wt:ek. This could mean ont: game tt:lecast nationally, or two or mort: aired on a rt:gional basis.

Burtnett starting over 
After years in the trenches, Purdue's coach settles down

The Purdue Exponent 
WEST LAfAYETTE, Ind. -After I~ years of coaching, Leon Burtnett has made it to the top. 
Since becoming Purdue's ;'lOth head ti>otball coach after Jim Young's resignation last year, Burtnett has found the job demand· ing of both hi~ time and energy. 
"The major change from assistant coach to head coach b that it demands more time." Burtnett says. "It demand~ that you plan out your whole day. I have 10 make ~ure I leave time ti>r the coaching end of the job." 
During the summer. Burtnett was kept busy speaking at variou~ alumni functions. "It gave me a chance to meet a lot of nt·w people," he says. "I had done it hdilre as an assistant, so it wasn't a~ if I was going in cold. I just hadn't done it as much heti>re." 
Burtnett found that he must also spend more time recruiting. "As an assistant coach, Iwas assigned a certain area to cover.'' says the ~9-ycar-old rookie coach. "If! tlnished in my area. Jim had me

Like Burtne t tt, Young and Rogers both were 
defensive coaches before becoming head 
coaches. "I feel it is an advantage to have been 
a defensive coach," Burtnett savs. "I coached 
the secondary which gives me. an advantage 
because I know how to hurt it the most. I feel! 
can also help the quarterbacks by recognizing 
the coverage being put on them." 
After years of moving, Burtnett, his wife _Cecilia and his three children call Purdue home. "The area is an ideal place for raising a family," Burtnett says, admiringly. "Two ofmy children were horn here. I like the com­munity and the support it gives the team." 
But Burtnett has not gotten the breaks 
necessary in order to he a successful first-year 
coach. During the course of the year, Purdue 
lost seven players due to academic and per­
sonal reasons, and iniuries. 
Against Minnesota last Saturday, Purdue 
lost its eighth player. defensive lineman Paul 
Hanna, to a knee injury. 
But despite the two lopsided losses (.35-1 oJ to Stanford and ~(,-I 0 to Minnesota), Burtnett has not given up, at kast not yet. "Naturally we have a Ion~ way to go as a football team.," he concedes. "We plaved two good first halves in both games and we have totally fal­len apart in the second haif The biggest con­

Notre Dame will have to do the things faust speaks ofagainst a Boilermaker squad that has given up 92H total yards in hack-to-hack losses to Stanti>rd ( y;.I oJ) and \-1inne~ota ( ~6-I 0 ). 
"That total is a little hit deceiving because you can't forget that (Stanti>rd's All-American quarterback)John Elway accounted for quite a hit of that yardage and he's as good as anybody around," said Faust. "They (Purdue) are breaking in some new people at certain 
_positions hut don't he surprised if some of them come into their own this week against us. It seems like playing against Notre Dame docs that to people anytime we play." 
If the new people faust speaks of do come into their own, it would give Purdue its first victory at Notre Dame Stadium since I9~'!. when the Boilers upset the Irish ;'li-20. 
At stake is the Shillelagh Trophy -given to the winner of the Notre Dame-Purdue game since 19S~. During that time, Notre Dame has won it I~ times. the Boilers 12. 
The Shillelagh is one of many reasons this intra-state rivalry always ranks as one of the most emotional games ofeach season for both teams. 
"When a team plays emotional games like we have the past two weeks, you can have let­downs," said tlrst-year Purdue Coach Leon Burtnett. "That's what's happening to this football team, they have doubts about their abilities. The kids want to win so had it's effecting their play. They have 10 relax and have fun." 
The Boilers shouldn't expect too much fun facing a :'llotre Dame defense that held \1ichi­gan to oJ I yards rushing and sacked quarter­hack Steve Smith eight times for 5oJ yards in losses. 
"They have the personnel, there's no doubt," said Burtnett. "I think they surprised everyone la.~t year when they went S-6 with the personnel they have. Their defense was good last year. Now their offense looks much more consistent." 
Notre Dame's new-timnd offensive consis­tency hegins with junior quarterback Blair Kiel, who had the best day ofhis career against \1ichigan with IS completions on 22 attempts for I-t I yards. for his efforts. Kiel received the game hall from his teammates, Notre Dame's most valuable player award from ABC and a double dose ofconfidence from himself. 
"Blair Kiel looked a lot better in his first

And so will fullback Larry Moriarty. who rushed for I I6 yards on 16 carries against the Wolverines. Kiel's well-timed short passes, mixed with the strong running game provided bv Moriartv and tailbacks Phil Carter and Greg B~ll. have kept Burtnett in his office watching game tilms until the wee hour~ ofevery morn­ing this week.

"I remember that we won our tirst gamt: last year." said faust, who is being perhap.o, overly­cautious in his predictions for the remainder 

ofthe season. "Things didn't go too well for us
