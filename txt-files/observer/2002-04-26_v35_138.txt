Seniors wait, search for jobs 
By LIZ KAHLING 
News Writer 
As graduation looms closer for seniors, they are bombarded with the ubiquitous question, "What are you doing next year?" Most of the seniors have an answer, but there are a number who are still weighing options and still looking. 
It's been a discouraging year for hiring with the recession that begin in March 2001, the Sept. 11 tragedy and the Enron and Andersen scandal. 
"It's a very different job mar­ket in comparison to years past, " says Lee Svete, director of the Career Center. He reports national on campus recruiting down 36 percent this year. Making matters worse is the fact that last year's class was over-hired and some are now only starting their jobs. 
Particularly hard hit were the 65 Notre Dame juniors and seniors who were affected by the Andersen meltdown. Alums have also contacted the Career Center to help them relocate. In response, the Career Center has held two meetings to discuss research on the Web and utiliz­ing alumni contacts. Additionally, a listserv was formed to report any internship or job possibilities. 
Senior Catherine Sanders is among the group who is still waiting to hear from a partner in Andersen if her position will still be available. 
"Everything is uncertain right now, a lot of us are just waiting for things to shake out," she said. Sanders Is among a group who still hasn't heard for sure if her offer has been rescinded. She is on an e-mail list at the Career Center that notifies her of possible alternatives or strategies to make it through this unpredictable time. 
"It's hard to look for a position now because a lot of jobs have been snapped up at this point of the year. A lot of seniors don't know what they're doing. It's a touchy subject," Sanders said. 
But there has been a lot of late recruiting this year as the economy begins a slow recov­ery. Just this week, Pace Global Energy Services and Hewitt Associates called the Career Center about job positions. Hewitt is hiring 50-60 business analysts. Svete also reports that the government is hiring like crazy because anywhere between 25 to 30 percent of the government workforce is retir­ing, many of them baby boomers. 
A new service available at the Career Center this spring is the City Tour informational meet­ings that highlight job opportu­nities in 12 major metropolitan cities including. 
"We collected the best info we could find on each city," said Svete. 
Students can visit the website and find a short description of the city life and connect to links to major employers in the public and private sectors, the fastest growing companies in the city, and sample companies by industry. 
Career service doesn't end for students after graduating. 


Leprechauns entertain the crowd 
By JUSTIN KRIVICKAS 
News Writer 
Cheering on the crowds in a traditional green suit, the Notre Dame Leprechaun has become a legendary symbol of Irish spirit. This figure is the ambas­sador of t h e University both on and off the field and can be seen at most varsity sporting events. 
To ensure that most sports can have the Leprechaun pre­sent, the University now has two positions: a Varsity and Olympic leprechaun. Varsity Leprechaun Michael Macaluso performs at football games, men's basketball games and pep rallies, while Olympic Leprechaun John Bisanz per­forms at men's and women's 

soccer, volleyball and women's basketball games. 
Watching Notre Dame foot­ball games as a kid, I thought the Leprechaun had the best job in the world," said Bisanz, "You really can't beat 
being out 

on the playing field with the athletes you've admired for so long and joining 
Bisanz the Notre Dame faith­ful in support of them." 
The Leprechaun can be seen in the national spotlight at parades and benefits. "To be honest. those visits are my favorite part of the job," said Macaluso, "because it's the time when I get to really inter­act with different people." 
The selection process to become the Leprechaun is long and detailed. The first facet includes writing a one-
page essay and involve three weeks of practicing with the cheerleading squad in early April. Outgoing varsity Leprechaun Adam Urra worked with the group and exposed them to situations that arise, such as interviews with the media and interaction with opposing fans. 
"We also did a lot of physical training to get used to the rig­ors of being the Leprechaun," said Bisanz. 
The selection panel consists of an athletic department member, an alumnus, a mem­ber of the university adminis­tration, a staff member, a for­
mer  Leprechaun  and  the  
cheer coach.  
The  culmination  of  the  

three-week tryout process ends with a mock pep rally for the Leprechaun hopefuls and a formal interview with a panel of judges to answer questions about the University.

ResLife listens to 


alleged rape case 
By HELENA PAYNE 
News Editor 
The University held a closed dis­ciplinary hearing Thursday for the 20-year-old female student who alleged she was raped March 28 in an off-campus house by four male students associated with the Notre Dame football team. 
The alleged victim and the four suspects, one former and three current football players, were pre­viously scheduled for an April 17 hearing with the Office of Residence Llfe and Housing that was postponed until Thursday. 
The hearing began around 9 

a.m. and lasted through most of the afternoon, television state­ment WSBT reported. 
Because of the hearing, the three suspects were not present at Thursday's football practice, the last one before Saturday's Blue and Gold game. 
Head coach Tyrone Willingham told reporters Thursday that the players had not been removed from the team.

The sweetest 



Cupcake 

When my friends and I moved into our off-cam­pus house last August we had the hardest time making it a home. Courtesy of our parents, we all con­tributed used furniture and a varied and colorful assort­ment of silverware and dish­es. Even with these tokens from home, our house just couldn't feel right. 
Until I brought an adorable little white fluflball back with me after a short weekend home in September. 
Cupcake, a Persian-like barncat with blue eyes and a calico tail, made herself wel­come in our house right from the start. 
For the first 13 years of her life, Cupcake spent her days outside, chasing mice and catching birds. Growing up a barncat, she never had the little luxuries afforded to her indoor counterparts. When she breezed into our house back in the fall, she brought with her a breath of life and humor we never knew. 
It took her a few days to warm up to her new surroundings. She wasn't used to the confinement of a house and she chose to hide underneath my bed until I drew her out with the promise of food and affection. Since then, she hasn't spent one minute alone ifsomeone was in the house. According to Cupcake, every open lap is an invita­tion for attention. 
Everyting Cupcake does makes us laugh. She finds great interest in paper, batting it aroWld as though it were a prized shrew. Whenever we all sit together deep in coversation, Cupcake looks as though she is listening intently and contributing in earnest. She even willingly takes rides in our homemade papoose when the mood strikes her. 
Surprisingly. our guy friends love her almost as much as I do. They've nicknamed her Mrs. Norris or Mrs. Jinx, depending on who you ask. Whenever they come over for a visit, she jumps right up and takes a nap on any willing lap. Cupcake especially likes it when they sleep over on our couch, finding a warm nook in which to snooze for the night. 
I don't want to sound like one ofthose "cat peo­ple" who obsess over their feline with the same ferociousness as a teenager at an N'Sync concert, but Cupcake is by the far the world's cutest kitty cat. I adore her and I make a point of telling her this several times a day. As a result, my room­mates claim she is the most spoiled and egotisti­cal cat they've ever witnessed. She expects con­stant adoration and attention. Without it, she complains. Loudly. 
Granted, Cupcake may try our patience at times. She'll meow outside our bedroom doors early in the morning. She leaves long white strands of fur all over our black pants. She's even been known to cough up a few hairballs. 
But, we all agree, this yearjust wouldn't have been quite as complete without our little Mups.

BROWN UNIVERSITY 

Students create Internet magazine 
PROVIDENCE, R.l. 
Glimpse, an Internet magazine founded by Brown University students last year, is looking to hit the big time. Glimpse examines international issues and cul­tures from the perspective of students studying abroad. The National Geographic Society contributed $15,000 and nine computers to The Glimpse Foundation, the student-run nonprofit that publishes the magazine, to fund an office in downtown Providence, R.I. Glimpse likely also will receive a $38,000 grant from National Geographic, said presi­dent and publisher Nick Fitzhugh. This summer the online magazine hopes to become an online resource center for study abroad students, a syndication ser­vice, an organizer of international conferences and a scholarship fund, Fitzhugh said. He said the maga­zine will be distributed in print to colleges across the country. Students studying abroad write most of the articles in Glimpse and draw on their experiences and conversations with the local population. 
INDIANA UNIVERSITY 

Students deal with limited daycare 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. 

Senior Erin Fagg had to wait nearly 17 months before she could register her 3-year-old son in the daycare she wanted. A single mother, Fagg said she wanted the best for Kaiden Thomas, but she wound up on a lengthy waiting list for one of Indiana University's best daycare centers. In the meantime, she enrolled Kaiden in an unlicensed center unaffili­ated with the University. "I was very discouraged," Fagg said. "You want your child -if you're not rais­ing him -in just as good of hands as you would take care of him." But at Indiana there aren't enough hands. University childcare offers eight spaces licensed by the state for infants, creating a waitlist of about 65 families at the only center offering such ser­vice -Campus View Child Care Center. Knee High Day Care Cooperative, an unlicensed co-op. also tends to children as young as six months and enrolls up to 14 families. A parent would have to sign up for infant care when she is pregnant.

Ohio recalls hot dogs 
Associated Press 
CINCINNATI 

A Cincinnati meat processor is recalling 140,000 pounds of frankfurters and hot dogs that may be contaminated with a germ that can cause a poten­tially fatal disease, the Agriculture Department's food safety service said Thursday. 
John Morrell & Co. volootarily reported the danger of Listeria monocytogenes, the service said in a statement. It produced the food on March 5 and distributed it to retail outlets nationwide. 
Listeria can cause listeriosis, a rare but potentially fatal dis­ease. Healthy people are rarely susceptible, but people with weak immune systems are par­ticularly at risk. Especially sus­ceptible are infants, the frail, the elderly, chronic disease suf­ferers, HIV-infected people and patients undergoing chemother­apy. 
"Because of the potential for foodborne illness. we want con­sumers to be aware of the recall," said Llnda Swacina, the service's assistant administra­tor. Shoppers should return the products to the point of pur­chase. 
The meat industry wants to rewrite rules from the former Clinton administration that would require makers of hot dogs, cold cuts and other ready­to-eat meat products test plant equipment for Listeria monocy­togen es, saying they are too restrictive. 
The Bush administration is undertaking an analysis of the risk and has delayed enforce­ment of the Clinton-era rules. 
The food service statement did not explain where and how John Morell discovered the dan­ger.

GSU honors Krum and Hahnenberg 
By ANDREW THAGARD 
Assistant News Ediror 
The Graduate Student Union recognized graduate students Carly Krum and Edward Hahnenberg for their teaching abilities. 
The organi­zation awarded K r u m Outstan­d i n g Graduate Teaching Assistant 

a n d Krum Hahnen­berg Outstanding Graduate Instructor of 2001. 
"It's so shocking. I've never taught before," said Krum after receiving the designa­tion. "I told my class right away. Teaching them is such a joy and any recognition [beyond that] is just icing on the cake." 
"It's a wonderful recogni­tion," echoed Hahnenberg. "I think I had such great stu­dents -that helped for sure. Their questions and insights really made it a great experi­ence." 
The two received their des­ignations after an intense selection process, according to Stephanie Arnett, chairperson of the GSU Academic Affairs Committee. GSU received 13 nominations from graduate students and faculty members. The committee reviewed TCEs and additional information submitted by the applicants including letters from students and the course syllabus. 

"People included different things," Arnett said. "It made it interesting, but it also made judging more difficult." 
Hahnenberg and Krum stood out, according to Arnett. because of the difference they made in undergraduate edu­
cation. 
"I really saw that these peo­ple were having a big impact on under­graduates," Arnett said. "A lot of times grad­

uate students are removed by research. It's really a great experience for the graduate students to get to know the students and share their expe­riences." 
Both Hahnenberg and Krum are Notre Dame alums.

Krum, in fact, referred to undergraduate staples like Boat Club and SYRs to teach her students about imperfect verb forms. She also has had her class over for dinner. 
Hahnenberg, whose classes studied the Bible, had his stu­dents watch movies and ana­lyze how Jesus was portrayed in artwork, including Notre Dame's "Touchdown Jesus_" But, he also tried to empha­size the importance of being a proactive student. 
"The goal is not to give answers but to get students to ask big questions," he said.

TLC singer killed in car crash 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA 

Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, the effervescent, sometimes volatile rapping member of the Grammy-winning trio TLC, was killed in a car crash in Honduras, her record company said early Friday. 
Lopes, 31, was in the Central American nation for a vacation, Arista Records' senior vice presi­dent of publicity Laura Swanson told The Associated Press. Lopes was reportedly among seven people in the car Thursday night and the only fatality. 
"No words can possibly express the sorrow and sadness I feel for this most devastating loss," said Arista president L.A. Reid, who helped shape the career of the Atlanta-based R&B group, one of the best-selling female groups in history. 
''Lisa was not only a gifted and talented musical inspiration, but more importantly, she was like a daughter to me. My thoughts and prayers are with Lisa's fam­ily and friends. Her legacy will be remembered forever." 
The location of the car crash 
was not immediately deter­
mined. It was unclear whether 
she was wearing a seatbelt.

12 hurt in New York City explosion 
Associated Press 
An explosion that may have been caused-by chemi­cals stored in a basement rocked a 10-story commer­ci a I building Thursday, hurling glass and rubble across a city block and injuring 42 people, at least 10 of them critically. 
Authorities quickly ruled out terrorism, though the blast conjured up memories of Sept. 11 for some in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. 
"It was a giant boom -a real giant boom," said Bill Beek, who lives a half-block away. "It sounded like an airplane crashing." 
"First we thought it was a bomb," said Alex Vargas, 
28. a student at Apex Technical School next door. "We all had to leave by the back stairs. People were yelling· and screaming. 'Hurry up!"' 
Victims were taken to the hospital with burns, severe head injuries, broken bones and cuts after the 11: 30 
a.m. blast. 
Chemicals stored in the basement by a sign compa­ny were being investigated as a possible factor, said Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta. Plumbers had been working on the boiler in the building at the time, hut that did not appear to be the cause, investigators said. 
Kaltech sign company's general manager Phil Morgan said he felt two consecutive blasts in the company's ground-floor offices. 
"One pushed me up from my chair, the second one had me out of my chair," he said. When it was over, the ceiling and a wall had come down. "Everything moved. The air was filled with 
dust.n 
Windows along the block of West 19th Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues were blown out, and sever­al people were injured by flying glass. 
The facade of the building was damaged and several walls were blown out, but it appeared to be structurally sound, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. 
Police and more than 100 firefighters poured into the area. Some victims, dazed and bloody, sat on the curb awaiting medical attention. 
The building housed the sign company and other commercial tenants, said Sid Dinsay, a spokesman for the city Office of Emergency Management. Neighbors said the building was also used for storage by the Apex school, which teaches welding, automotive repair and other trades. 
Property records show that the building is owned bv 19th Street Associates 
LLC. The office of Steven Kaufman, a principal in the firm, said he had no imme­diate comment.

selected from this arduous try­out, the work just begins for them. Practice is four days a week for two hours each day. Also, there are mandato­ry lifting sessions three io four days a week for an hour. 
"With the preparation, games and community com­mitments, being · the Leprechaun is a pretty work intensive position," said Bisanz. "But it is completely rewarding and the work pays off. Being the Leprechaun pri­marily requires an insatiable love for Notre Dame and I've had that ever since I can remember. I am just going to try my best to keep the,fans fired up and wanting to come back for more." 
Scholarships are not given out for the holders of the Leprechaun position. Additionally, a Leprechaun must participate for three years on the cheer squad in order to attain a monogram. Many sports give monograms for playing only one year or even one play. Monogramming, a distin­guished honor for Notre Dame athletes, requires three years of hard work. 
Even though students must participate in countless hours of practice, the downsides to being the Leprechaun has not deterred Macaluso and Bisanz. 
"I've always loved this University and its athletic pro­gram and I thought becoming the Leprechaun was the best opportunity to share that love with others," said Bisanz. 
Macaluso remembers when he first wanted to be the Leprechaun. 
"Watching Mike Brown and the cheerleaders as a fresh­man, I thought it looked like so much fun and something that would be very worthwhile and an amazing experience," he said. "I was just looking to have fun with [my] time here at Notre Dame." 
Last year, Macaluso served as the Olympic Leprechaun, which he said greatly pre­pared him for the Varsity posi­tion. 
"The most important part 

about this job, though, is being willing and able to show your love and enthusiasm for Notre Dame," he said. " There's a ton of Notre Dame nuts out there, and I'm just another one of them." 
"I know that I'll have the support and help of the cheer­leaders and my coaches when­ever I find myself in a tough situation," said Macaluso. 
Bisanz added, "I can't wait for next year to get started and begin what looks to be another successful year in Notre Dame athletics." 
"Every time I'm in that suit, on a court or field, I know I'm not out there just for me," Macaluso said. 'Tm there for the fans -to make them have a good time and to represent Notre Dame and all it stands for. Over a century of fans, alumni, teams. faculty, stu­dents, service, and Catholic faith, the Leprechauns are the foremost collegiate icon in the country, and not only that, we represent the best university in the country."

Prosecutors won't seek the death penalty against actor Robert Blake if he is convicted of murdering his wife, the district attorney's office said Thursday. Prosecutors will instead seek a sentence of life in prison without parole, the office said. Blake was charged Monday with fatally shooting his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, 44, after a dinner outing last May. Prosecutors said the 68-year-old actor and his bodyguard, Earle Caldwell, plotted the slaying for months.

Fisherman prevent suicide attempt: 
Three fishermen rescued a man who jumped from a bridge into the White River in an apparent suicide attempt. "He said he had got­ten to the bridge and didn't feel like living any­more," said Eddie Brochin, a professional fish­ing guide. "He said the only thing he thought about before he jumped was his daughter and granddaughter. I told him it wasn't his time to go." The man, whose name was not released, was sent to Methodist Hospital for treatment. Police said the man likely would have drowned had the fishermen not intervened.

BETHLEHEM 
In a day punctuated by exchanges of gunfire and the evacuation of a small number of Palestinian men at the Church of the Nativity, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators failed today to reach terms to end a three-week-long siege but agreed to inter­im steps toward a settle­ment. 
The two sides committed to releasing about a dozen youths from the compound -including two who the Israeli military said were 10 years old -and to removing the remains of two gunmen killed in the first days of the fighting. 

But negotiators remained unable to agree on the central question of which people inside the basilica were to be consid­ered terrorists, and how they would be handled upon their surrender. 
Talks were scheduled to resume on Thursday. Salah Taamari, the chief Palestinian negotiator, struck a moderate tone late tonight. "The meeting was constructive," he said. 
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon also expressed confidence that the issues could be resolved soon. "I believe that it will not take too long," Mr. Sharon said. 
Tonight's meeting, the third session in two days, began moments after a brief gun battle at the church had killed one Palestinian and slightly wounded an Israeli soldier and sent the Palestinian negotiators and their Israeli military escorts scrambling for cover. 
It was further under­mined by the intractability of both sides on the cen­tral questions about iden­tifying the terrorists and d.efining their fate. 
Israel wants the Palestinians to provide a full roster of people within the compound's walls, from which it would select men it accuses of terror­ism. 

The Palestinians have refused, and instead have asked Israel to hand over a list of people whose arrest it seeks. 
Virtually all the estimat­ed 250 people in the church are thought to be civilians, clergymen or Palestinian Authority police officers or security officials. 
But a senior Israeli offi­cial said today that about 30 gunmen are wanted for terrorism, including two men accused of killing an American-born architect, Avi Boaz, in January.

Tenn. doctors sue over managed care program 
Associated Press 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. 
Tennessee ·s largest physi­cian's organization sued the state's four biggest health insurers Thursday, alleging their managed care practices threaten patients' health. 
The Tennessee Medical Association's class-action law­suits filed in state court name Aetna Inc. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee, CIGNA HealthCare and United HealthCare. 
They allege that because of the "extra.ordi­nary unequal could not comment in detail, but he called it "shortsighted." 
"We do everything we can do to keep health insurance afford­able," he said. 
Representatives of United, Aetna and CIGNA said they had not seen the lawsuits and declined comment. 
Dr. Mickey McAdoo, president elect of the TMA, said the asso­ciation and its individual mem­bers have been bringing their concerns to the insurance com­panies almost daily, but to no avail. 
In addition to the TMA law­suits, four individual physician

The association says the four companies comprise 70 percent of the HMO market in Tennessee and insure nearly 
2.4 million people in managed care plans across the state. 
The lawsuits seek to stop a number of business practices that TMA alleges delay, deny or reduce payments to physicians. 
For example, they claim the insurance companies "bundle" several physician services together to lower reimburse­ments and deny higher reim­bursements for complicated medical cases in which doctors spend extra time and resources. 
Ron Harr, a spokesman for Blue Cross Blue Shield, said he had not seen the lawsuit and paid in full,

The TMA lawsuits do not seek monetary damages; they ask that the court stop "these wrongful and financially puni­tive practices." 
Managed care has been under legal challenge in several states. 
Physicians' groups in New York and South Carolina have filed similar lawsuits this year. A federal lawsuit against major health care companies is pend­ing in Florida by 600,000 doc­tors who claim they are rou­tinely shortchanged on reim­bursement claims through "institutionalized underpay­ments."

WASHINGTON 
Motorists can rest assured that their gas-guzzling SUVs won't be threatened by new energy legislation moving through Congress. And there's good news there too for farm­ers and wind turbine opera­tors. 
But environmentalists are in an uproar, and California law­makers predict gasoline short­ages and price spikes. 
The impact of a broad ener­gy bill passed by the Senate on Thursday can be expected to .touch a wide array of peo­ple, industries and businesses -that is if it ever gets out of Congress. Although passed by a wide margin, 88-11, it must still be merged with a starkly different bill that the House passed last year. 
After the Senate vote, President Bush appeared con­fident a compromise could be reached. Between the two bills, he said, there were "the elements of a comprehensive energy policy" that include "the major conservation and environmentally responsible production measures needed to reduce our reliance on for­eign sources of energy." 
This legislation "should increase our energy indepen­dence," said Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., although he made clear there were dif­ferences with the House. He call the Senate-passed bill "a far more responsible, progres­sive, consumer-friendly ener­gy policy" than the House bill, which largely mirrored the president's priorities. 
The Senate rejected Bush's top energy priority: oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. That is

The Senate's refusal to open the Alaska wildlife refuge to oil companies was one of the few victories for environmen­talists over the six weeks that senators deliberated energy policy. 
The disappointments ranged from rejection of even modest steps to improve automobile fuel efficiency to -in the final hours ..:_ stripping the bill of a requirement that the Energy Department impose the more aggressive efficiency stan­dards for air conditioners that had been proposed by the Clinton administration. 
"Finding environmentally friendly provisions in this bill is like looking for a needle in a haystack," complained Elizabeth Thompson, legisla­ther the House 
nor Senate bills address the issue in any significant way, so the SUVs are safe no matter who's right. 
The bill also would require more ethanol use in gasoline, resulting in a tripling of ethanol production to 5 billion gallons a year by 2012, a boon to farmers. 
The ethanol mandate sur­vived despite repeated attempts by senators from California and New York to have it removed, or at least phased in more slowly. When the Senate refused even to postpone its implementation for a year, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., accused farm-state senators of ignor­ing the harm that might come to California, where she said a lack of ethanol could produce gasoline shortages and price spikes.

Catholics see child abuse as-global 
Associated. Press 
DUBLIN 

Catholics worldwide on Thursday welcomed Pope John Paul II's unprecedented summit with U.S. cardinals as a good start to tackling child abuse within the Catholic church, but court cases kept surfacing to remind the Vatican that this is a global scandal. 
In Ireland. 70-year-old Morris Tobin. a retired member of the Christian Brothers teaching order, appeared in court Thursday to face 173 charges of molesting 25 schoolboys in act unless the problem is already in great proportions," said the Rev. Robert Reyes, a parish priest in the Philippines, where another priest has been jailed on suspicion of raping a 14-year-old girl. "We don't real­ize the defect .until it is too big to solve." 
The Vatican has not offered a blanket policy for Catholics worldwide on whether they should report alleged abuse to church officials or civil authori­ties, leaving the advice to bish­ops. 
In Puerto Rico, Archbishop Roberto Gonzalez Nieves said

"You'd

"The pope needs to take a long, hard look at what his church has tried to cover up in Ireland. in Canada, in Australia, in his own Polish homeland ­probably everywhere, if the truth ever comes out." 
In many countries, church offi­cials and Roman Catholic faith­ful were weighing the U.S. cardi­nals' words versus the policies on sexual abuse being adopted by their own clergymen. Some suggested the church's response looked like too little, too late. 
"The Catholic Church does not

"It's better that complainants go straight to civil authorities because it creates an impression of impartiality in the church," Nieves said. 
Newspaper editorials world­wide remarked on the unprece­dented nature of the Vatican summit. Many expressed hope that the church would build momentum toward wider reforms. 
"This was a landmark occa­sion, which ... has broken through the atmosphere of silence and denial hitherto marking the Vatican's approach to this issue," declared the Irish Times, the paper of record in this predominantly Catholic nation. 
''Dirty linen washed in public," read a headline in the La Stampa newspaper in Rome. 
The rival Corriere della Sera newspaper credited the U.S. media's "daily hammering" for forcing the pope and his visitors to behave with uncharacteristic openness. 
In Britain, an officially Protestant nation, the conserva­tive Daily Telegraph warned that some of the church's sternest critics had an anti­Catholic agenda." 
"A minority wishes to destroy the church and will use pedophilia as a handy weapon to do so," said the Telegraph, Britain's top-circulation broad­sheet. It said calls for the church to soften its policy of priestly celibacy represented a "gross fallacy." 
"A man does not become a pedophile for want of a wife," the paper said. 
In Austria, too, church officials djsmissed any connection between the priestly celibacy and deviant sexual behavior among a minority of priests. 
"It must be mentioned that many cases of child abuse occur in families. There, the celibacy duty plays no role at all," said Bishop Egon Kapellari. 
But the Irish Times questioned whether the church's policies on the priesthood could withstand a future wave ofscandals. 
It noted that ordinations had already fallen to unacceptable levels. 
"The Vatican has clearly set its face against any move to change celibacy rules or to open up the question of women priests," the Irish Times said. "In the longer term it is likely to find these issues cannot he held at bay and may come to be seen as the most rational way to renew the church." 

Twelve die in bomb explosion in Pakistan 
Associated Press 
ISI.AMABAD. Pakistan 

A bomb ripped through a Shiite Muslim mosque deep in the interior of Pakistan's east­ern Punjab province, killing 12 worshippers, all of them women, and wounding several others, hospital officials said Friday. 
It's not known who planted the powerful device that exploded near midnight Thursday in Bukker, about Pakistan's military president Gen. Pervez Musharraf. The organization reviles Shiite Muslims. 
Since January, dozens of Shiite Muslims have been killed in Pakistan. Many of the deaths have been target killings and have occurred both in the Punjab province and in the country's southern Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital.

"The bomb was planted on the women's side and all the dead were women," said Nisar, who was contacted by tele­phone. 
Police have not made any arrests, but Pakistan, and east­ern Punjab province in particu­lar, has been wracked by reli­giously motivated violence in recent years. 
Previous attacks against Shiite Muslims have been car­ried out by members of the vio­lent Sipah-e-Sahaba or Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet group, banned by known if the 
killings were carried out by the same people or organization. 
No one has claimed responsi­bility for any of the killings. 
Previously Hasan Turabi, the head of a banned Shiite Muslim group, Tehrik-e-Jafria, blamed the upsurge in killings of Shiite 
Muslims  on  the  return  to  
Pakistan  of militant Sunni  
Muslims  from  neighboring  

Afghanistan following the col­lapse of the hardline Taliban. 
Turabi said the Taliban, a movement dominated by Sunni Muslims, espoused the same philosophy as Pakistan's radical Sunni Muslims. and harbored those who had killed Shiite Muslims in Pakistan. With the fall of the Taliban these radical elements returned home, he said.

Syed Sirajuddin is Malaysia's 12th king under a rotational system created after indepen­dence from Britain in 1957 to spread the power among the sultans and rajas who had ruled over fiefdoms for hun­dreds of years. 
Malaysia's kings do not inherit the throne. Instead, hereditarv rulers from nine of Malaysia's 13 states meet every five years -earlier if a reigning monarch dies -and appoint a successor by secret ballot. 
But political power resides with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has led Malaysia for 21 years. and a parliament elected every five years. 
Under changes instituted in 1990, the king can reject a parliamentary decision and lawmakers have to reconsider it. But if they pass it again, the bill becomes law.

Hundreds of thousands of people marched in French cities Thursday in opposition to far-right presidential can­did ate Jean-Marie Le Pen, who blamed rival incumbent Jacques Chirac for encourag­ing the protests. 
The marches were part of the continuing rise street protests following Sunday's first round of the presidential election, when Le Pen quali­fied to face the conservative Chirac in a

As the protests swelled, Le Pen issued a statement say­ing he was the victim of a "campaign of hatred and lies." 
Le Pen, a member of the European Parliament, also criticized what he called the "scandalous interference of prime ministers" from the European Union.

Chirac, in a prime-time television interview Wednesday, praised the protests against Le Pen. Speaking on France-2 televi­sion, he urged protesters to show "determination" -but in a "dignified and reason­able" manner.

He also said Chirac has been "formally crowned as the uncontested leader of the French Left." 
"But I am the candidate of France -against euro-glob­alization," Le Pen was quoted as saying. 
France's best-known intel­lectuals including Bernard-Henri Levy and Andre Glucksman 
endorsed Chirac in a state­ment published Thursday in the newspaper Le Monde. 
Jewish and Muslim leaders in southern Marseille also united behind Chirac, saying Le Pen was the "candidate of hatred and xenophobia." 
Until last Sunday, France was preparing for a sleepy presidential race, with all polls predicting a run-off between Chirac and Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. 
Bored with the top con­tenders, a record 28 percent of voters abstained. Chirac received nearly 20 percent of votes, Le Pen nearly 17 per­cent and Prime Minister Lionel J ospin about 16 per­cent. 
At a campaign stop Thursday, Chirac said voters delivered their message clearly. 
"The worry, the discontent. the demand for a new direc­tion, I heard them ... and l want to respond," he said in Lyon. 
He also said he was con­cerned about the extreme right in France. . "What is at stake ... is mov­ing aside the old demons of extremist temptation that has already caused so much pain in.the history of humankind," 
he said. 
Human rights groups and political parties jointly called Thursday for weekend protests in m a j o r French cities. 
L a r g e protests also were called for Wednesday 

to mark May Day, when Le Pen plans his annual march honoring Joan of Arc. 
One anti-Le Pen group said its protest would begin on a central Paris bridge, where on May 1, 1995, a 29-year­old Moroccan man drowned after being pushed into the Seine by a group of National Front supporters at an anti­immigrant rally.

Bidding farewell to seniors 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Coverage of "Galileo" was simplistic 
I was very frustrated by both the review of the spring Film, Television and Theater (FIT) mainstage, "The Llfe of Galileo," as well as the accompanying editorial charging departmental shows with blandness and a "general lack of proper theatrical focus." 
I personally believe that all the conceptual choices came together in a subtle but cen-­trally cohesive way to stimulate our under­standing of the beautifully complex and multi-layered text, though I don't have the space to explain why here. But while I don't propose a wholesale rejection of the criti­cism -whether or not the choices ultimate­ly worked is a subjective judgment -critics have a responsibility to provide intelligent and, wherever possible, objective reports about what their experiences were like so that readers can make a well-founded choice about attendance. The articles were so fraught with over-simplification and self­contradiction that the campus community was done a great disservice in this respect. 
The review. for example, discussed "alien­ation effect," a central element of the show's aesthetic, as though it was a nega tive thing. Alienation effect does not merely use "overly philosophic or exaggeratedly straightforward lines and stage settings that [don't] appeal aesthetically," associating it only with a didacticism that is by implica­tion unappealing to the average Notre Dame audience member. Actually, alienation has more to do with a way ofseeing, with an ability to be self-aware of one's responses to what one witnesses onstage. The techniques used to accomplish this can be highly varied and, believe it or not, very aesthetically stimulating. Its intended use in a show should thus not be used to frighten people away who perhaps aren't familiar with the term, as it appears to have been used (per­haps unintentionally) in the review. 
In addition, the author appears to funda­mentally misunderstand what it means to stage a text. He writes, "It is irrelevant if FIT agrees with the portrayal of Virginia [in the scriptJ as weak, or not." Actually, as a theater artist, that is precisely the decision one must make. The text does not dictate its meaning clearly in black and white -it must be interpreted. 
But the most frustrating element was the author's self-contradiction. While early in the article he claims that "the show is intel­ligently put together" and that "aesthetical­ly, the show is a knockout," he goes on to claim that "the production has a number of dubious choices," with central elements that are "pointless," that the show is pulled "down into a bit of an incoherency," and ultimately that "while Brecht wanted his audiences to leave thinking, the audience of this production will leave wondering what the hell FIT was thinking." I can only won­der how the author hoped his readership could reconcile these polar statements. 
The review and the editorial call for a more intelligent conceptualization of FIT mainstages. Perhaps that is a fair statement to make -but what is ce.rtain is that the campus community is in need ofmore intel­ligent criticism on behalfof The Observer.

Inconsistencies in Pax Christi proposal 
I would like to point out a couple of the inconsistencies in Pax Christi's ideas about the ROTC programs. These inconsistencies are generally focused on their idea that all ROTC students should be required to take a class on just war theory. Now, I think that ifwe are to force these cadets and midshipmen to take these classes, we should take a closer look at the motives behind this wish. 
The class would supposedly educate them for tough moral decisions that they will have to make upon entering their careers in the services. The ques­tion I pose is this: Why would the University not require morality classes for every student at Notre Dame? Each and every student will be going out into the world and will be forced to make hard moral decisions at some point. While we, as students, are required to take two theology classes, these class­es do not necessarily have to address morality or even Christianity. (Try tak­ing Chinese Ways of Thought.) Why not make it mandatory for every student to attend Mass? Why not make every student memorize the Catechism? 
The truth is that, as students, we are given the choice to learn about moral­ity in the method that we feel best approaches our needs. A student that is an atheist can attend this school, meet every requirement, and leave with a high moral code without ever attending a single mass or writing a paper about the Catholic Church. Forcing the ROTC students to take classes on just war theo­ry is a ridiculous proposal. Having the class available to the students is appro­priate. Offering retreats for the ROTC students during which they can discuss issues of morality in the armed forces is appropriate. Having open forums where the ROTC students can go and discuss with professors and other stu­dents their concerns for the future is appropriate. All this has been done. However.., forcing them to take a class on just war theory because they appar­ently can not possibly come to any kind of moral code without the help of the infallible Catholic Church makes as much sense as taking attendance at church. 
To burst Pax Christi's bubble ofignorance. not every student at Notre Dame is a Catholic, nor should every student be. The ROTC students have every asset they need in order to learn more about just war theory and what kind of morality is expected of a Catholic during war should they wish to do so. In this, University President Father Edward Malloy has not failed them at all.

As inevitable as seasonal changes, classes of students march through educa­tional institutions. With spring comes the departure of Notre Dame's class of 2002. This year's seniors will be known as the first terror-hardened graduates since Pearl Harbor and the last hard alcohol con­sumers on campus. 
Today's seniors enter a much more unstable economy, more so this year than during the entire preceding decade. They leave their Catholic Disneyland campus setting dur­ing a time of moral crisis in the Catholic Church. What lies ahead for them is not as bad as the 1970's raging Vietnam War nor as good as the booming 1990's economy. What lies ahead of them is what they make of it. · 
A wise father once told his son, "At the end of your life, it's not what you did in life that matters. It's how well you did it and who surrounded you." 
The quote comes from a fictitious par­ent in a Disney movie, but it rings true as seniors prepare for the "real world."

makes an impact within our communities. 
At the very least, Notre Dame students learn of community through the religious aspect of the University and the concen­trated campus setting. If nothing else, osmosis develops an appreciation of the Catholic Church. How many times have students wondered why parish services could not be as personally rewarding as those on campus? 
Catholics are saddened about the cur­rent crisis in the American Church com­munity, but we should also be relieved that through an open dialogue it is being corrected. It can be a catalyst for change within the Church in less open countries throughout the world. lt may also finally bring the debate regarding married and women priests to the forefront of the mind of the cardinal who will succeed Pope John Paul II. 
A truly pure community is not one based on the Nazi pure-blood theory. Rather, a true community is one of inclu­sion. To achieve community everyone must embrace acceptance and reject exclusion. While an overwhelming majori­ty of Notre Dame students as well as fac­ulty are Catholic, the University has expe­rienced its best moments when accep­tance and understanding were the basis for its actions. It is a tragic commentary on the University's history that it took until this year to hire its first African­American head coach. 
As a nation we are at our best when we embrace and understand others rather than selectively discriminate. Political campaigns tend to accent the nasty nega­tives in hopes of persuading voters to reject an opponent. 

As individuals, we are most civilized when we are not hypocritical but tolerant. Those who say they are right and will not compromise have a false sense of commu­nity, one of selectivity and limitations. Those who think their god is the only god are examples of why Northern Ireland or Israel are such killing fields. 
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay. R­Texas, recently told a gathering of evan­gelical Christians in Pearland, Texas, that two of his state's major universities no longer provide a "Godly educa­tion." He said, "Don't .send your kids to Baylor. And don't send vour kids to [Texas] t\&M." 
The problem, accord­ing to reports on the Internet, is that DeLay was expelled from Baylor. He was report­edly known as "Hot Tub Tom" for his frequent trips across the border to Mexico during his stay at Baylor. Maybe he thought that Baylor should have dealt with him sooner. 
The keys to a successful life include the advice from the Disney father to surround yourself with good people and do well whatever interests you. It sometimes calls for bold action to create an atmosphere of community. The Pope apologizing to Muslims for past ills of the Church is probably the single most important act of community outreach in our time. 
Successful persons are the ones who teach and encourage little leaguers rather than pressure them to win. Successful persons are like my fellow Notre Dame classmate, not the one who contributed the largest single financial contribution to the University but the one who has no realjob except playing the ponies. He and his heart of gold support disadvantaged, uneducated and poor neighbors in his modest midwestern town. Every month, another family or drifter spends time eat­
ing the equivalent of a feast and feels the warmth and love of my 
unselfish classmate. The Class of 2002 will dis­perse throughout our 
nation and the worlc:\. 
Many will become finan­cially wealthy. Many will work in positions that they love. Most will not achieve fame out­side their local commu­nities, but that is a uni­

verse in itself where the smallest of gestures can be the most effective. But if the Class of 2002 can collectively sift through divisive issues with a live-and­let-live attitude, they will be the gre<!_test class to ever graduate.

Freshmen Shantha Ready and Tom "Doogie" Sutton rehearse for "Slop Culture," one of the four one-act plays being performed tonight as part of the "Freshmen Four." 
The4 freshman of the theatre 
By C. SPENCER BEGGS 
Scene Editor 
Some remember their first time on stage as being paralyzed in a spotlight while play­ing a tree in a third-grade production of "The Wizard of Oz." Some never made it to the auditions. 
Tonight, a group of students will get to put whatever theatre experiences they've had behind them and take the stage at Notre Dame for the first time. 
"The Freshmen Four" or "The Frosh 4," consists of four short one-act plays where all the acting, directing and technical work is done by freshmen. Sophomores Justin Williams, Meg Ryan and Cheryl Turski serve as producers and resource persons for the show. Williams and Ryan each directed a play in the show last year and Turski starred in another. 
"It was one of the best experiences of my freshman year and we felt if we didn't put it up nobody would," Turski said. 
Though some members of the production have had previous theatre experience, the production is a unique opportunity for first­year students who are curious about cam­pus theatre or were unsuccessful in getting a part in other campus productions to take a little bit of the campus spotlight in a learning and supportive environment. 
"I tried out for these plays because I hadn't done theatre in months and it felt really strange," freshman Shantha Ready said. 
This year's plays are all comedies. "Slop Culture," which is directed by freshman Steve Hoeplinger, is a humorous commen­tary on the shared experience of the chil­dren of the '90s: hours upon hours of bad television. "Naomi in the Living Room," a comedy by Christopher Durang, is directed by Hallie Taylor. The show is a manic evening in the life of Naomi, an insane woman whose son, John, and his new fiancee have come to visit. 
"Date with a Stranger," directed by Paul Sifuentes, is a candid peek into a date where a man and woman attempt to get to know each other through sexual innuendo and back-and-forth statements, counter­statements and retractions. "Time Flies," directed by Molly Topper, is the life of two mayflies that live for only 14 hours. 
For the most part, the rehearsal process for thfl shows is laid back. Thfl casts get very close because it is a learning experi­ence for all of them. lloeplinger thinks the rehearsal process has allowed him to apply and understand many of the techniques he learned in his "Acting: Process" class this semester, hut he credits his cast with mak­ing the process a positive experience. 
"It's been really easy because I tell my actors to do something and they usually do something better than I asked ... it's been a blast, and H's what I look forward to every night," Hoeplinger said. 
"The Freshmen Plays" will be performed tonight in the Hesburgh Library auditorium at 7:30 p.m. General admission is $3. Tickets will be available only at the door.

After a 42-year haul, the long·est-running musical on Broadway, "The Fantasticks," recently closed its doors on Jan. 
13. However, the famous love story that has become so memo­rable in American society lives on. This weekend on campus, The Farley Hall Players will perform their own version of "The Fantasticks." 
The musical itself is relatively simple and small. This is not "Les Miserables" with swarming crowds and intricate subplots. "The Fantasticks" is a clever and charming story filled with love, deception and eventually, renewal. In the words of Lizzie Bracken, the show's director, the production "is a great size musical for Farley Hall Players and is told in a simply beautiful way. The characters are interesting and provide a great oppor­tunity for the actors." 
The set is very plain, consisting of two chairs, an imaginary wall, a curtain backdrop that changes throughout the perfor­mance and a few props. This humble setting works well with the basic storyline and cast of eight characters. "There aren't many boundaries so every person involved in the production can be as creative as they want," Bracken said. 
The musical starts off with an overture presented by the pianist, Lauren Prieto. 1'hroughout the show, Prieto skillfully plays each melody. Her timing and rhythm keep the show going at a constant rate. 
The short intro segues into "Try to Remember," perhaps the

Expectations raised high one more time 
It's spring and the usual signs that spring is here have hit campus:_ Pig Tostal, fris­bee on the quad, snow and the Blue-Gold game.
This . year, like 
every year. expecta­tions are 
high as spring practice ends and fans look ahead to the fall. They're thinking that maybe, just maybe, this will be the year the Irish come home with a national championship 
Fans, coaches and players this vear sound a lot like the they·did last year. 
Bob Davie had high expecta­tions of his team last year. 
"Things look pretty good and I think we have a good chance to be successful," he said at the start of spring. 
He wanted to take his pro­gram to the next level. 
Wide receiver David Givens also had high expectations last year. 
"I think it's possible that we could win a national champi­onship this coming year," he said. " ... It's an attainable goal." 
Unfortunately for last year's Irish, those expectations fell a 

little flat. So it's something of 
a surprise that the fans arc 
back on the bandwagon this 
year, talking about how many 
games the Irish will win and 
mulling over opinions about 
the new Irish head coach. 
Despite the 5-6 record last 
season, that little black rain 
cloud that followed the foot­
ball team last year seems to be 
disappearing. 
"There has been this cloud, I 
think I labeled it the Eeyore 
cloud, there is this sense that 
something is wrong, that 
something is not right, that we 
lost something," said Irish 
head coach Tyrone 
Willingham as his team began 
practice this year. " ... That's 
the first thing we've got to cre­
ate is a positive feel, a positive 
nature about this program." 
That seems to have hap­
pened. at least for the fans. 
And they have a lot to expect 
this year. 
There are expectations of 
the new head coach who is so 
different than head coach Bob 
Davie, the silent coach who is 
going to return Notre Dame to 
national prominence. 
There are expectations 
about the new West Coast­
style offense that promises to 
be more explosive and more 
exciting than the usual play up 
the middle. Expectations that have kept fans on the edge of ·their seat waiting to see who 
will line up behind center 
come fall. 
There are expectations that 
Notre Dame will stun the 
nation in the Kickoff Classic on Aug. 31 and that maybe, _just maybe, the Hail Mary pass will really work this year. 

The coaches have high expectations as well. Willingham will accept nothing less than the pursuit of perfec­tion. Wide receivers coach Trent Miles expects his play­ers, who are adjusting to a totally new offensive scheme, to give up the excuse that they're learning and be suc­cessful today. 
"I personally expect us to be good now," he said."... I don't expect them to settle for [a bad practice], to just put if off as if Tm only learning.' That's bullcrap. Lei's go out there and expect to be good right now." · 
So that's where things stand. Coaches, fans, players expect to go out there and be good right now. Saturday they'll see how realistic those expecta­tions are. 
As the Irish take the field on Saturday in front of some­where around 20,000 fans, avid Irish watchers from all over the country will get their first taste of 2002 Irish foot­ball. They expect to see a pre­view of next season, from offensive plays to defensive schemes and special teams line-ups. 
They expect to be able to spend the next four months talking about what the Blue­Gold game says about the fall season. Maybe if Carlyle Holiday or Matt LoVecchio takes more snaps, they can talk about who they expect to be the quarterback. Maybe they can talk about who they expect to be the go-to receiver for those third-and-15 plays. 


But there's something we all must keep in mind. 
Our expectations may not be met. The 2002 season could end and they could be unful­filled or they could exceeded. 
Expectations are high. Now it's just a matter of time to see if those expectations are placed on a team that can meet them.

Players to watch 


Quarterbacks 
Which player will be taking the snap come fall is still up in the air. Carlyle Holiday was Notre Dame's man last year after sophomore Matt Lovecchio (bottom right) struggled in the first two games of last season, but LoVecchio started seven games as a freshman, including the 2001 Fiesta Bowl. Holiday worked well in a duck-and-run offense but it is still unclear how his passing game will develop. LoVecchio has had more experience with the pass and it is quite possible that he will line up behind center in the fall. Third-stringer Jared Clark pulled himself out of the running last week and moved to tight end. 
Running backs 
With the graduation of running backs Tony Fisher and Terrance Howard, the main running backs responsibility will probably fall on rising senior Julius Jones (top left). Fifth-year senior full­back Tom Lopienski should see some more carries, although the new offensive style will make less use of the run. Rising sophomore Ryan Grant (bottom left) and fifth-year senior Mike McNair may also make solid contributions to the Irish run game. 
Offensive line 
The Irish offensive line is probably the most experienced part of the team. Despite the gradua­tion of Kurt Vollers, the Irish return five lineman with loads of experience -Jordan Black, Jeff Faine, Sean Milligan, Sean Mahan and Brennan Curtin. The line has two years of experience and looked as if it was really beginning to gel at the end of last season. Black, Milligan and Mahan bounced between positions but seem to have settled into place in spring practice. Rising sophomore Mark LeVoir could step in if one of those five gets injured. 
Wide receivers 
With the new West Coast-style offense, the wide receivers should receive some new national atten­tion. After graduating David Givens and Javin Hunter, the wide receiver position wide open. Arnaz Battle, who did nothing extraordinary in his first year as a flanker, has spent most of spring practice on the sidelines nursing an injury. Rising junior Omar Jenkins leads the returning receivers in receptions with seven. Ronnie Rodamer (top right), Lorenzo Crawford and rising sophomore Carlos Campbell have one each. 

Defensive line 
The loss of Tony Weaver and Grant Irons will be a blow Lo the Irish defensive line. Returning starters fifth-year senior Ryan Roberts and rising seniors Darrell Campbell and Cedric Hilliard will have to lead the defensive line, which suffers from a lack of depth. Rising junior Kyle Budinseck will probably step in place as starters. 
Linebackers 

With the exit of Rocky Boiman and Tyreo Harrison, Courtney Watson is the lone returning starter. The linebackers will have some adjusting to do, but the Irish have the numbers to fill the holes. Fifth-year sflnior Carlos Pierre-Antoine, ris­ing junior Mike Goulsby and rising sophomores Corey Mays and Brandon Hoyte may be able to crack the starting line-up. 
Secondary 

The secondary is Notre Dame's strongest unit. With only Ron Israel graduating, the Irish have plenty of depth. Fifth-year seniors Donald Dykes and Shane Walton, rising seniors Glenn Earl, Gerome Sapp and Jason Beckstrom, rising juniors Vontez Duff, Abram Elam and Preston Jackson and rising sophomore Dwight Ellick can all make solid contributions. The leading safeties, who provide a combination of talent and experience, should begin to emerge on Saturday. 
Special teams 
Nicholas Setta will return for the Irish after being the leading scorer on more than one occassion last season, but will have to find a new holder with the graduation of Adam Tibhle·. Setta will be joined by classmate Joey Hidbold, who was the Irish punter last season. Who will return kickoffs and punts remains questionable hut Jones and Vontez Duff, along with Walton and speedy wide receiver Matt Shelton, have seen action in practice.

IL He served a one-year stint as a gradu­
assistant for the Spartans before going ,o Central Michigan. Willingham then noved from Michigan State to North :arolina State to Rice, where he also umped into an internship program with ;he San Francisco 49ers designed to help 
inority coaches move into the NFL. 
There, Willingham got to know Dennis reen. The two had coached on opposite teams 
d had been mutual acquaintances for veral years. But Green, who worked with e 49ers, needed a racquetball partner in e morning. Since Willingham didn't mind aking up early, he agreed to play. The two clicked immediately. 
"We had that opportunity to get a feel for each other and to get a feel for what he thought on certain issues and what I thought on certain issues," Willingham said. "We had very similar minds." 
A few years later, when Green was look­ing to fill a position on his staff at Stanford, he hired Willingham as the running backs coach. And when Green left for the Minnesota Vikings in 1992, Willingham fol­lowed him. 
"I think there are a lot of people Coach Green could have picked," Willingham said. "l feel very fortunate that he picked me." 
Those who have worked with both Green and Willingham saw similarities in coach­ing styles when Willingham left Minnesota for his first head coaching position at Stanford in 1995. Willingham opted to teach and instruct rather than scream and yell. 
"He grew up under the Denny Green sys­tem and he's very similar to Denny in the way he approaches the program, his sys­tem, his philosophy and his values," said Irish secondary coach Trent Walters, who worked with Green and Willingham in Minnesota. 
In practices, when a player makes a mis­take, Willingham will raise his voice only once -only because it's necessary to get the player's attention. He motions for the player to come next to him and in low, controlled tones, calmly explains the mis­take. He trades flashes of greatness for consistency and treats All-Americans the same as walk-ons. 
Willingham wants to create a well­rounded person, not just a football machine. He evaluates success based on the physical, mental and spiritual develop­ment of his players. The poster boy for micro-managers, Willingham instructs his players on everything from how to read a blitz to how to hold a fork at the dinner table. 
The result is lasting admiration for the head coach. 
"I think he demands a whole lot, but everything he demands, he can do," said former Stanford receiver Troy Walters, now with the Indianapolis Colts. "He's a guy you want to go to war with. He's been in the same situations, he's had to over­come a lot of things, and he's had to work hard in life. You believe what he says and that he can do stuff because he's coming from the same situation." 
"Just because he's not vocal with screaming and yelling doesn't mean he's not intense," Notre Dame receivers coach Trent Miles said. "He knows exactly what he wants, and he doesn't have to scream and yell to get it out of people all the time." 
With respect came success. Willingham led the Cardinals to a 44-36-1 record over six years, a Rose Bowl berth and a top 10 BCS finish. He was selected Pac-10 Coach of the Year twice. Coaches longed to work on the same staff with the man who had a reputation for ,getting involved in every facet of the team without stepping on assis­tant coaches' toes. 
But Wil!ingham will have none of the praise. 
"I don't see myself as being any different from anybody else," he said. "In the greater scheme of things, I'm just another man." 
The second meeting 
\Vhiie didn't agree. It had been nearly three weeks since O'Leary resigned and White was reluctant to select another coach until Stanford's season was over. He wanted to talk to Willingham again, 
Willingham certainly didn't expect anoth­er call from White. He remembered look­ing at the television on the morning of Dec. 14, the day headlines screamed across ESPN that O'Leary had been forced to resign as head coach of the Irish, But Willingham wasn't planning on fielding another call from Notre Dame. 

"I didn't expect to hear from them again," Willingham said. "There was noth­ing that would lead me to believe that." 
Mere hours after Stanford lost to Georgia Tech in the Seattle Bowl, White was on the phone asking Leland for permission to talk to Willingham again. He talked to the coach the next day. 

"Ty, would you have a sincern inten)st in this thing?" White asked. 
"Kevin, you made a mistake," Willingham said. "You should have hired me, I'm the guy. I would love to be at Notre Da.m.e.n 
II. was as if someone cranked the volume knob to full blast. 
"I was looking for a gusher," White said after Willingham finally gushed. He had the same passion for Notre Dame as the fiery O'Leary -he just showed it different­ly. 
Over the next day or two, Willingham evaluated the possible scenarios. He talked with nearly every major person involved in his life. He talked about the increased pres­sure at Notre Dame with his brother. He talked about moving to Indiana with his wife. He talked about the thrill of a new challenge with Dungy. And he talked with Leland. 
"He was sort of, to me, casual about his interest in the job," the Stanford athletic director said. "Until he took it." 
Suddenly, the two-year-old joke between Leland and White didn't seem all that funny anymore -at least to Leland. White, on the other hand, was giddy. It took near­ly a month, but he finally found the man who could hear the music. 
Facing the music 

Notre Dame welcomed the new Irish football coach just as quickly as he left Stanford. The mayor of South Bend pre­sented him with a key to the city. Fans praised the hire. Players welcomed him with open arms. 
"He's got his hands in everything," Notre Dame center Jeff Faine said. "Offensive line, running backs, defensive backs, you feel like he's coaching everybody. I love it." 
"The way he came across and the things he said, it was so easy to talk to him," said Irish kicker Nicholas Setta. "There was no hesitation. You knew the guys were going to have great respect for him and you knew it was going to be a great thing." 
After the pomp died down, Willingham looked a Notre Dame community starved for football glory in the eye and promised he would win. 
Pressure didn't matter to Willingham. He saw a challenge. He took the job. He won't change. Instead, he believes things around 
him will. 

"His whole thing is that he's got to win there because that's the best college job in the country," said Baggett, who has stayed in weekly contact with his former college roommate. "It's a big challenge for him, hut he's fired up about it." 
Willingham is nearly settled into his new life at Notre Dame. He still lives out of a hotel room, but he already has his prized stereo system set up in his office. Sometimes, during the day, sounds of the Notre Dame marching band faintly res­onate from Willingham's office. 
"Other days, I might listen to gospel, rhythm and blues. But today," the head coach said with a grin, "today is my fight song day." 
Willingham has heard the music. He knows what is expected of him. He under­stands that nothing less than perfection is expected at Notre Dame. 
And he loves it. 

"That's the goal, to be perfect," he said. "That's the goal, that's the joy. The chase is better than the capture. That, to me, is a great way to live as a person and an ath­lete, to be perfect, to be the best I can be."

class in quest for success 
Preston pushes for victory on and offthe field 
By JOE HETTLER Assistant Sporn Editor 
When talking about football, Notre Dame running backs and special teams coach Buzz Preston sounds a lot like head coach T y r o n e Willingham. 
Both expect the same things out of their players and have simi­lar philoso­phies on foot­ba11 -they want their Buzz Preston players to win running backs in every aspect of life. These similar beliefs may explain why Preston fits so well on Willingham's staff. 


"I expect them to give their best every time and try to not only be good football players but good peo­ple," Preston said. "Hopefully, try to reach for everything they want, try to be everything they can in life." 
What if his players do not give their best? 
"That's not an option," Preston said. "I don't give up on kids. I don't ever think you should give up anyone unless they give up on themselves, that's the only way it's not going to happen. In coaching you 're here to help young men grow in every phase of their life and that's what I feel very strongly about." 
Preston started his coaching career at his alma mater, Hawaii, as a graduate assistant for three years. He then headed to Southern Illinois in 1984 to become the wide receivers and defensive backs coach. lirom there, Preston went back to Hawaii as the special teams, wide receivers, defensive backs coach and strength and con­ditioning coordinator. During his time there, Preston helped lead the Rainbows to their first two bowl games in the history of the school's football program. He also was part of the 1992 Hawaii team that went 11-2. 
After five seasons at Washington State and a year at UNLV, Preston was hired by Willingham in 1999 to be the running backs coach at Stanford. During his tenure there, Preston helped build a running game that led the PAC-10 in rush­ing for the first time in its history by notching 201 yards per game. In the first season after taking over, Stanford's running backs doubled their yardage from thfl year before. 
During his years as a member of Willingham's staff, the two have developed a friendship that is strongly based on their beliefs about football and life. 
"[My relationship with Tyrone Willingham] is one of a great deal of respect and admiration," Preston said. "He's a class act. He holds true to all the virtues that I feel that you have to have as a coach and what you want to do for young men and for the game. I consider him a friend and I've just been blessed to have the opportu­nity to part of his program."

Miles focuses on coaching from the beginning 
By KATIE McVOY 
Associate Sports Editor 
In 1986, Trent Miles played his last football game on a Thursday night. By Monday, the Indiana State graduate was coaching. 
Miles, Notre Dame's newest wide receivers coach, had aspirations of playing in the NFL but wound up coaching there instead of playing. 
"I wanted to play pro foot­ball but that didn't work out and I real­ized my senior year that that wasn't going to work out," Miles said. "My last game was a Thursday night, an ESPN game and that Monday I became a coach." 
Miles coached wide receivers with Irish head coach Ty Willingham last year at Stanford and followed him to Notre Dame this winter. Before that, he was at Green Bay as an offensive assis­tant. coaching wide receivers and doing quality control. But if you ask him now which he liked better, coaching in the pros or coaching college, his answer is pretty straight forward."Coaching, just coaching," he said. 
Miles, like most coaches, has been all over the country coaching. He began at his alma mater Indiana State, moved to Fresno State, had an internship with the Seattle Seahawks and spent some time at the University of New Mexico and at the University of Oklahoma. He's coached on both sides of the ball, working with defensive backs and wide receivers and worked with a West Coast offense at Stanford and an option offense at Oklahoma. With that kind of experience, he's taken a lit­tle bit from each place he's been and come up with a coaching phi­losophy ofhis own. 

"I've been able to pull a little bit of different philosophy from every­body," he said. "I was able to work with guys at differrmt places, I felt like I made some good relation­ships." 
And his coaching philosophy is as simple as what he likes to do. 
"Win," he said. 
Miles is a part of a transition for the Notre Dame offense. moving from an option-heavy game to a West Coast-style offense. But the Indiana native, who is finallv back near his family, is ready for anoth­er coaching challenge. 
"I always love a. challenge," he said. "We're in this because of the challenges. If you didn't like chal­lenges you wouldn't be coaching or playing."

Baer comes from Japan to Notre Dame 
ByJOE HETTLER Assistant Sports Editor 

Defensive coordinator Kent Baer did not begin his colle­giate football coaching career in the United States, but over­seas in Japan as the head coach of t h e Yokosuka Seahawks {United States N a v y } team for f o u r vears. Once he got back on to American soil, Baer coached linebackers at Utah State for 5 years, before being their defensive coordinator for three more years. 
After eight more years at defensive coordinator for the University of California and Arizona State, Tyrone Willingham hired Baer as the defensive coordinator of Stanford in 1995. Last year at Stanford, Baer's defense gave up only 109.6 yards on the ground, which was good enough to lead the PAC-10 conference for only the sec­ond time in school history. Surprisingly, from the staff Willingham assembled in 1995, only Baer remains 

with  the  coach  at  Notre  
Dame.  
"I've  been  with  

[Willingham] longer than anybody now," Baer said. 'Tm the only coach left on the staff when we came in, when we first went to Stanford, so we've been through a lot together. He's such a tremendous person, first of all. Not only is he a good person, a great family man, but he's a tremendous football coach." 
Throughout his years of coaching, Baer has made some lasting memories, but one particular memory sticks 
out in his mind most vividly. 
"The ll 999] Rose Bowl comes to mind right now," Baer said. "What a tremen­dous opportunity. I think that's number one, playing in the Rose Bowl, having the kind of year we had, repre­senting the PAC-10 and being the PAC-10 champion was just a special time in my life and coaching career." 
On the field, Baer wants his teams to be aggressive and shut down the oppo­nents running game. However. Baer also pushes his players to become better people off the field as well. 
"Hopefully [his players] walk away saying 'I learned something not only about football, but how to handle situations and about life,"' Baer said.

Simmons and wife are a perfect match

kidney to her husband. 

"It was very much an unselfish act on her part," Simmons said. "It was just the true meaning of marriage 
is all about ... The joke is that she's always with me and that I married the right women." 
While his role at Notre Dame is slightly different from his role with his old team, Bob Simmons don't mind. 
The head coach at Oklahoma State for six sea­sons, Simmons took a year off in 2001 before being hired by Tyrone Willingham to be the linebacker's coach for Notre Dame this season. 
Simmons compiled a 30-38 record at Oklahoma State and led the Cowboys to an Alamo Bowl appearance in 1997, while also collecting Big 12 conference Coach of the Year honors that season. Previously, Simmons had worked as outside lineback­ers and defensive line coach 
at West Virginia and Colorado. At Colorado, Simmons helped lead the Buffaloes to a bowl game in all seven years he was there. 
Simmons left Oklahoma State to become a volunteer consultant for the Big 12 conference. 
Simmons has known Willingham for many years since his days at Oklahoma State. 
"[At Oklahoma State]. we developed, what I think is a real good relationship with him and he wife over the year," he said. "I've always had a lot of respect for Coach Willingham. He's always been a dynamic person with a great intensity for what he wanted to do."

Diedrick returns from Canada to family 
ByANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 

ff Bill Diedrick didn't have a family, chances are pretty good he'd still be in Canada. 
The current Notre Dame offensive coordina­tor spent two years in the Canadian Football League as offensive coordina­tor for the Edmonton Eskimos. Life was good for Diedrick, who coached in a league that featured high­octane offenses. 
"A.-, an olfonsive coach, it was a lot fun," he said. "I don't think I'd like to be a defensive coach." 

The only problem was that Diedrick's family still lived in the United States. And after Diedrick's middle son, Justin, won a high school state cham­pionship, Diedrick realized he missed watching his sons play football. 
So he took some time off coaching football to be with his family. But just one year later, he landed a job at Washington and in 1998 accepted the role or offensive coordinator at Stanford under Tyrone Willingham. 
"He's the reason J wanted to go to Stanford and the reason I followed Wm to Notre Dame," Diedrick said. "I think when you look at how he's not only a wonderful, out'>tanding person he i'l exactly who he is." 
Diedrick utilizes an offensive system that emphasizes bal­ance between the run and the pass, a philosophy that evolved from his coaching days in the CFL. In Canada, teams could pass at will. But teams were 
separated by their ability to run 
the football. And when Diedrick 
went to Washington, he added 
a running game to his wide 
open, West-Coast style of 
olfonse. 
Now an established offensive 
coordinator, Diedrick doesn't 
feel the pressure he once felt 

early in his career to keep mov­ing from position to position. ­Notre Dame is his reward for coaching for 30 years. 
"When you're young, you feel like you need to move to keep moving ahead," he said. "As long as you can keep moving ahead and each opportunity is a higher level, you get forced to that. Once you get to this level and have an opportunity to stay at some place, that's really the goal of a coach. The last four years have been wonderful and I'm looking forward to a won­derful career here."

NHL 
Blues advance, grab series from Blackhawks 
Associatrd Press 
ST. LOUIS 

For Brent Johnson, the end of his long shutout streak was no big deal. 
He allowed three goals in the second period, but wore an ear­to-ear grin after the St. Louis Blues overcame a two-goal deficit to advance to the second round of the NHL playoffs with a 5-3 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks in Game 5 on Thursday night. 
Johnson, in his first season as the starter, blanked the Blackhawks in Games 2, 3 and 4 and is one of only five goalies in NHL history with three shutouts in a playoff series. After 3 hours, 26 minutes and 45 seconds without allowing a goal, he gave up the three, the last two on consecutive shots, as the Blackhawk.s took a 3-1 lead. 
Sure enough, the Blues rallied to tie it at the end of the second period. 
Jamal Mayers' second goal of the playoffs at 6:23 of the third was the difference as the Blackhawks' first playoff appearance in five years was a short one. 
Mayers. who scored a career­best nine goals in 77 regular­season games, snapped the tie by whipping a turnaround shot from the right circle that went between Passmore's pads. Ray Ferraro set up the goal by kick­ing the puck to Mayers from behind the net. 
Mayers thought he surprised Passmore. 
Keith Tkachuk made it a two­goal lead, scoring on a break-in with 4:04 to go. 
Scott Mellanby got his third goal of the series for the Blues. Scott Young and Chris Pronger also scored for the Western Conference's fourth seed. 
Steve Thomas ended Johnson's shutout streak at 4:34 of the second period, the Blackhawks' first goal in the series since Alexander Karpovtsev's game-winner with 
3:10 to go in a 2-1 Game 1 victo­ry. Kyle Calder and Steve Sullivan also scored for the Blackhawks, the fifth seed in the Western Conference, who totaled five goals in five games in the best-of-seven series. 
Bruins 5, Canadiens 2 
A high-scoring but relatively tame playoff series between the Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens turned ugly Thursday night. 
With 1:17 left in Boston's 5-2 victory that evened the best-uf­seven series after four games, Bruins defenseman Kyle McLaren caught Richard Zednik, Montreal's leading scorer, with a vicious elbow that knocked out the forward. McLaren was given a five-minute match penalty. 
Zednik was motionless as he was treated on the ice for about five minutes then was removed on a stretcher and taken to a local hospital with a suspected concussion and facial injuries. 
Montreal coach Michel Therrien threatened retaliation against the Bruins' top players in Game 5 on Saturday in Boston. 
Ftorek refused to comment on the hit, but McLaren said he did nothing wrong. 
The Bruins took a 3-0 lead in the first period on goals from

Stock, Bill Guerin and Martin Lapointe. Brian Rolston added a key short-handed goal in the second and Sergei Samsonov got a goal in the third. 
Zednik scored both Montreal goals on power plays and leads the team with eight points in four games. 
The nastiness started before the hit on Zednik. The Bruins sent Stock,-a fourth-line tough guy, on for a power play with two minutes left to play and Therrien sent out his fighter, Gino Odjick. 
The two squared off and were sent off for fighting. 
The Canadiens were also upset with Guerin, who brought down defenseman Andrei Markov with an open ice knee­check in the second period. Guerin got two minutes for clip­ping. Markov finished the game, but is questionable for Saturday. 
Both Therrien and Odjick compared McLaren's hit on Zednik to the elbow thrown by Tie Domi on New Jersey defenseman Scott Niedermayer during last year's playoffs, which resulted in an eight-game suspension for the Toronto enforcer. 

. NHL spokes~an Frank Brown declined comment, but said the league was aware of the inci­dents. 
Therrien and Ftorek had a shouting match at the benches and the game ended with more fighting in the final minute. A few fans among the jeering capacity crowd of 21,273 threw beer and soda at the Bruins bench. 
Zednik looked to have taunted Byron Dafoe after scoring his second goal of the game, per­haps hoping to put the Bruins goaltender off his game. 
In Game 3 on Tuesday· night, Dafoe allowed three third-period goals in a 5-3 comeback win for Montreal. 
There was no Boston collapse this time. 
Red Wings 4, Canucks 0 
Things are quite different for the Detroit Red Wings than they were a week ago. 
Sergei Fedorov scored two of Detroit's four first-period goals and assisted on another as the Red Wings beat Vancouver 4-0 Thursday night for their third consecutive victory in the best­of-seven series after losing _the

first two games at home. Game 6 is Saturday in Vancouver. 
The last time the Red Wings played in Joe Louis Arena, on Friday night, they were booed, cheered sarcastically and even offered suggestions via chants from their red-clad rabid fans when the Canucks took a 2-0 lead in the rrrst-round series. 
Just 4:02 into the game, Fedorov put Detroit ahead 1-0 with a slap shot between the cir­cles, after Brendan Shanahan's shot rebounded off Dan Cloutier. 
Then the Red Wings chased Cloutier and seemed to take the life out of the Canucks with two goals in a 1:57 span later in the period. 
Dominik Hasek, who made 25 saves. played his third consecu­tive solid game for the Red Wings. 
While the Canucks were failing to score on their third power­play opportunity, Fedorov car­ried the puck through the center of the ice then passed it to Mathieu Dandenault, who beat Cloutier for a short-handed goal from the right circle. 
Chants of "Let's Go Red Wings" replaced the rants of "Shoot The Puck," from Game 2 when Detroit was struggling to score. 
Boyd Devereaux's goal off another rebound gave Detroit a 3-0 lead and sent Cloutier to the bench after stopping just six of nine shots. He was replaced by Peter Skudra, who made his first postseason appearance since playing one playoff game for Pittsburgh two years ago. 
The Red Wings essentially ended the game with their fourth first-period goal, which illustrat­ed the type of night it was for their collection of future Hall of Famers. 
Brett Hull backhanded a pass from the left boards to the front of the net, and Fedorov, with only his right hand on his stick, poked the puck past Skudra as the crowd went wild. 
Vancouver president and gen­eral manager Brian Burke called a news conference to strongly criticize the officiating on Wednesday, After four games Detroit had a 17-16 advantage in power plays.

BOSTON 

Allen Iverson shook off the rust, but his Philadelphia 76ers couldn't shake off Paul Pierce. 
Pierce hit the go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:36 left Thursday night to lead the Boston Celtics to a 93-85 victory over the 76ers and send the defending Eastern Conference champions to the brink of elimination.

Boston took a 2-0 lead despite 29 points from Iverson, who missed the final 14 games of the regu­lar season and struggled in the playoff opener. Game 3 of the five-game series is in Philadelphia on Sunday. 
Antoine Walker had 24 points and 10 rebounds, and Pierce also had 10 rebounds as the Celtics pleased a rau­cous crowd and stayed perfect in the playoffs at the FleetCenter. The last time they made the playoffs was in 1995 -the final season of the Boston Garden and before Walker or Pierce entered the NBA. 
The Sixers led 81-77 with 3:21 left to play when Tony Battie hit a basket and Pierce followed with a jumper -just his second basket of the half -to tie it. Pierce, who led the league in fourth­quarter points in the regular season, followed with a 3-pointer from the right side to give Boston an 84-81 lead it never relinquished.

No. 3 Hope College will be the Belles' last MIAA con­tender. Sophomore first base­man Katie Frigge believes the will otfer the most competition. 
"Hope is in our conference and will be a tougher match for us," said Frigge. "But we will have more fans and more sup­port on our home field.'' 
The Belles did not move from their seventh-place ranking after losing 5-0 and 6-0 in their doubleheader against Calvin on Wednesday. 
Frigge cited a lack of focus 
for their underachiev­ing perfor­mance. 
"Our coach had just told us about his resignation, and we were all kind of flat and not really there; we weren't into 
it," said Frigge. 
The Knights took charge and set the tone for the games with a run in the first inning of the first game. The Belles showed some promise in the third when Erin Sullivan doubled to center

field and made it around the bases, only to be thrown out at home. After a dry spell, with four hits, Calvin got two runs in the fourth inning and then wrapped up the game with two more runs in the sixth. In the second game, Calvin earned two runs in the second, two in the third and the final two in the seventh. 
Despite their two losses, the team plans on entering this weekend's games using the same starting lineup, perhaps with a little variation. Graneff fielded the games against Calvin with Libby Wilhelmy or Kristin Martin as the pitcher, Marnie Walsh as the shortstop, Frigge in left field, Katrina Tebbe in right field, Mandy Hayes at third base, Susan Kutz or Sandy Harmon as catcher, Lynn Lapshan at first base, Rebekah Solmos at second base and Sullivan in center field. 
"Our biggest problem on Wednesday were the errors of not knowing where the play was at," said Harmon. "This weekend we have to get on the ball earlier and improve offen­sively. Just one inning makes the game." 
After a trying season due to the weather, new coaching staff and tough competitors, the biggest challenge for the Belles this weekend will be to enter their games with courage, focus and confidence. 
"Playing hard, playing like a team and having fun in our last games -I think that is what we need," said Harmon.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE 

Irish bounce· back to whip Wildcats 
By CHRIS COLEMAN 
Spores Writer 
Maybe all the Notre Dame women's lacrosse team needed was a wake-up call to remind them that they are the 10th best team in country. 
The Irish put Saturday's loss to Georgetown behind them in an 11-3 victory over Northwestern Thursday. 
The women showed flashes of brilliance, holding a young Northwestern team scoreless for the last 36 minutes of the game and spreading the ball around on the offensive end; however the Irish continue to be plagued by turnovers. 
"A win is a win, but we didn't go out and execute as good was we should have," said Danielle Shearer. 
Execution may prove to be the difference in Notre Dame's final two games of the year. If 10-4 Notre Dame defeats Rutgers and No.12 Vanderbilt, they are all but guaranteed a spot in the tournament. 
"All we need is to win, and we are in the tournament," said captain Tina Fedarcyk. ''They are definitely beatable teams, so as long as we come together and play our game, we'll be fine." 
The Irish have come out slow in several games, and that's hurt the team. Three of Notre Dame's four losses have been by one goal in games where the Irish had mounted a comeback and had momentum 
when time expired. Players know they cannot afford another game like that. 
"Approaching the tourna­ment, we need to play our best and up to the level we know we can." Shearer said. "There are only two games left. We need to step up." 
Shearer, who led the team in points against Northwestern with three goals and one assist, converted a pass from Eleanor Weille to open up the scoring. 
Anne Riley, Alissa Moser and Meredith Simon, who each scored two goals, then gave

the Irish a substantial lead. I 
 I
The Irish were up 6-1 when Northwestern scored two free \ position goals to make the game 6-3 at the half. Those goals were the last looks Northwestern would get all day. 
"We held them scoreless for the whole second half, that's a good thing," said Fedarcyk who is one of the cornerstones on defense. 
Kristen Gaudreau and Lisa Lombardi scored their first goals of the year during the second half of play. Shearer and Simon-also added in to the all-Irish scoring party in the second half. 
The women travel to face Big East opponent Rutgers this Sunday. Rutgers is 7-8 overall and 2-3 in the division.

Lustig opened the game by scoring the first five points for Project Mayhem en route to a 5­1 early lead for the third seed. However, Robster Craws were able to capitalize on Project Mayhem fouls to bring them­selves as close as 17 -14 late in the game. 
Unfortunately for Robster Craws, hot shooting by Lustig, Luke Mueller, Jason Mayes, Doug Wilson and Brian Rush led Project Mayhem to a late run to seal the win. 
No. 4 Lazy Boys beat a scrappy Irish Men squad, 21-17 in other round of 16 action. 
Irish Men, playing without Irish assistant basketball coach Lewis Preston, could not match Lazy Boys height inside. 
Jason Ditsch's strong inside­outside play helped Lazy Boys build a 20-12 lead before Irish Men mounted a last-ditch come­back effort. 
Nick Williams' scrappy point guard play and Brian Kahn's shooting touch rallied the Irish Men to 20-15 before Tommy Walz ended the game with a free throw for Lazy Boys. 
"We are a real fundamentally sound team," Ditsch said. "Toward the end of the game, we started getting away from that and playing a lot of 1-on-1. When we went back to funda­mentals, we were line." 
Williams' refused to use Preston's absence as an excuse for the loss. 
Preston was away on a recruit­ing trip. 
"We've won without him before [in the first round and the round of 64]." Williams said, but acknowledged that his team wa.,; vastly different without Virginia Military Institution's all-time leading shot blocker. "Without him, we have to play five guards." 
In the last game of the night, No. 2 AdWorks All-Stars shot well from the outside and defeat­ed cold-shooting NDToday.com, 21-15. 
Jason Sullivan and Ryan Ostick shot well from the outside for AdWorks, while Carlyle Holiday, Abe Elam and Justin Tuck forced NDToday to defend inside. 
"We were hoping that Sullivan wouldn't shoot well today," NDToday's Ali Tahmasbi said. 
NDToday's zone would have posed a problem for AdWorks if it hadn't shot so well. 
"That's the first we've seen all tournament," Sullivan said. "When you face a zone, you have to shoot well and force them to come out of it. They never came out of it, so we kept getting good looks from the outside." 
AdWorks' strategy on defense was to deny NDToday from get­ting any shots inside. 
"We've got some great athletes that can bai,ically shut down the point guards," Sullivan said. If a team does manage to get inside on AdWorks. Justin Tuck's shot blocking skills give the team a "security blanket," according to Sullivan. 
With the inside denied, NDToday tried to hit long-range shots but couldn't find its shoot­ing touch. 
''I tried to shoot myself out of the slump, and it just didn't hap­pen. That really hurt us," Tahmasbi said. 
AdWorks will play No. 7 Mourning Wood today.

"We knew they'd come out playing hard," said J.A.C.K.S' Kevin Muempfer. "They actually out-hustled us and played really well. Our size helped us and got them in foul trouble." 
"They're a great team and would be favored on paper," said Team 524's Matt Parsons, "but there's a reason they play the games. We wish them good luck the rest of the way." 
"We have the most rabid fans," added 524's Dan O'Boyle. "We were well-hydrated, which was key to our success." 
The only lower-seeded team to advance was No. 9 We Get Wet who defeated No. 8 seed 5 Degree Guarantee 21-18. Down 14-12, Wet went on a 7-2 run to take a 19-16 lead before holding on for the win. 
"We stepped up our defense in the second half," said Wet cap­tain Justin Funk. "We thought we could run on them early, but instead they ran on us. We were more successful once we took our press off." 

No. 5 mmm ... Cheese took an early lead then held on in the second half to advance over Kelly Kapowski 21-18. After Cheese took a 16-13 lead, Kapowski closed to within two on four occasions but could never get closer. 
"Our offensive rebounds by Tony [Carney] and Grant [Gholson] led to some cheap bas­kets," said Cheese's DJ Lipke. "We've been able to do that the last couple games."

Who's Getting Lucky Tonight? advances to final 4 
By MIKE CONNOLLY 
Senior Staff Writer 
No. 4 Who's Getting Lucky Tonight? finally met its match athletically in No. 5 Tanned Mullets Thursday afternoon, but still pulled out a 21-15 win. 
Lucky, with four current or former Welsh Hall interhall foot­ball players, were challenged by the height and athleticism of five members of the Notre Dame women's soccer team. 
"They were obviously great athletes," said Vanessa Llchon of Lucky. "Easily the most athletic team we have played in the tour­nament so far." 
Both teams played strong pres­sure defense and looked to run

when they had openings. Lucky was a little more successful, in large part thanks to the gritty play of Lichon. With her team leading 7-6, Lichon went on a tear. She scored the next five points for Lucky to build a 12-10 lead. 
Kelly Tulisiak, Kate Morrell and Liz Wagner traded buckets with Alex Callan and Anna Benjamin of Lucky to get Tanned Mullets back within one at 14­13. 
Llchon then drove through the lane and hit a one-handed run­ner to spark a 5-0 run for Lucky. Lichon and Callan each scored two, while Benjamin chipped in one. 
Benjamin finished off Tanned Mullets with a jump shot from just inside the foul line an few possessions later. 

The Tanned Mullets, named for women's soccer coach Randy Waldrum's unique sense of style, forced Lucky to shoot mostly from the outside. Mullets' tight 2-3 zone stopped Lucky's usually strong interior passing. 
"We're not really strong shoot­ers so we have to rely on defense," Wagner said. 
The Mullets' strategy was in part aided by Lucky's downgrad­ed roster. Post player Mary Murphy missed her second game in a row while attending her grandmother's funeral. Benjamin has filled in well for Murphy, but Lucky's lineup is much smaller without Murphy. 
"It's tough playing against those packed in zones without our post player," Lichon said, "We are trying to play high-low with five guards."

MEN'S LACROSSE 
Irish look to salvage some pride against Crimson 



ByJOE LICANDRO 
Sports W ricer 
The Notre Dame men's lacrosse team will be looking to shake off the disappointment of its last two games when they travel to Cambridge, Mass., to take on the Harvard Crimson Saturday at 1 p.m. 
Two weeks ago, Notre Dame's offense sputtered in an 11-8 road loss against Army. That loss ended a three-game winning streak for the Irish in which they played their best lacrosse of the year. 
Sunday's one-goal loss to Fairfield was even worse. After struggling most of the contest and finding themselves down six goals with six minutes left in the game. the Irish finally woke up. 
Notre Dame staged a furious comeback, scoring five goals in three minutes to pull within one goal of the Stags. 
Unfortunately, a six-goal 
deficit proved to be just too much as the Irish fell just one goal short of tying the Stags and sending the game to over­time. 
The tough defeat eliminated the Irish from playoff con­tention, and denied them a top finish in the Great Western Lacrosse League for the first time in four years. 
For Notre Dame's seniors, the loss was especially difficult. 
"I've seen the best and worst of Notre Dame lacrosse," senior captain John Flandina said Sunday after the loss. "The year before my freshman year was the last time Notre Dame didn't make the tourna­ment. Last year, we made it all the way to the Final Four. This will be the first time in my career I won't be in the tour­nament. It's just embarrass­ing." 
Even though the Irish know they will not compete in the NCAA Tournament this year, Notre Dame's pride is at stake 


Congratulate this gear's 
in their remaining two games on the road against Harvard this weekend and at home against Ohio State on May 4. 
Head coach Kevi.n Corrigan hopes his team can correct its recent mistakes. 
"I don't know if that last game revealed anything new or profound to us," said Corrigan. ''Real simply. what we ar~ doing in practice is going back to the fundamentals. You have to play hard and passionately every time you play." 
Corrigan does not plan to make any drastic changes in these final two games. He plans to continue using the same lineups and player com­binations that he has played all season. He is not looking toward next year yet. 
"I don't have any major line­up changes planned," said Corrigan. "If I had somebody who could have helped us, they would have already been play­ing. I'm not looking at next year. I'm just looking for us to win these last two games." 
If there is any team that can relate to Notre Dame's frus­trating season, it is Harvard. The Crimson started the sea­son on fire, opening their sea­son with four straight wins. 
Since their initial success, the Crimson's season has been nothing short of a disaster. Harvard has lost seven straight games to fall to 4-7 on the sea­son. 
Just like the Irish, the Crimson are hoping to end the

shambles. The team had gone 15­
29 the previous year, had only four 
scholarship players and had failed 
to finish a season with a winning 
record for five consecutive years. 
In just his first year, Murphy turned the Irish into a 39-22 team. The next year, the Irish won a school-record 48 games and advanced to the NCAA tournament for the first time in 19 years. In each of his next five seasons, the Irish would win at least 40 games, and made the NCAA tournament from 1992-94. 
"I had taken over a program [at Notre Dame] that hadn't won a lot," Murphy said with a chuckle. "It was kind of fun being part of the rise, even though I wasn't the rea­son we got good. The reason we got good is because we had great kids." 
But the Irish did soar under his leadership, from a baseball nobody to a team to be contended with on a yearly basis. 
In 1992, at the height of his suc­cess as coach, national-power Miami offered him a lucrative head coaching deal, but Murphy turned it down. 
"I still believed l had more work to do at Notre Dame," Murphy said. "The [new] stadium wasn't built yet. There were things to still get done." 
Indeed, in 1993 Notre Dame built a 3,000-seat stadium for its base­ball team. In each of those next two years. the Irish went 46-16, and fell just one win short of the College World Series in 1994. 
After his third straight NCAA tournament bid in 1994, it was Arizona State that came knocking on Murphy's door, and this time, he was willing to listen. He accepted the position. 
"In leaving for Arizona State, the time was right in my life," Murphy said. "I needed to do some different things and make some adjust­ments. But just because you leave Notre Dame, it doesn't mean that it doesn't have a lasting effect on you the rest of your life. It was a very special time in my life." 
With the departure of one of its most successful coaches, Notre Dame had some giant shoes to fill. 
Enter current head coach Paul Mainieri. 
Mainieri picked up right where Murphy had left off, leading his Irish squad to a 40-21 record, the most wins ever for a first-year coach at Notre Dame. 
'Tm glad that Coach Murphy left because it gave me an opportunity to come here," Mainieri said with a smile. "It was a very big thing for me to get the opportunity to come to Notre Dame. I've worked very hard to try to continue the excel­lence that he had established and to try to improve upon it. I feel very proud of what we've accomplished in the seven-plus years at Notre Dame." 
In those years, Mainieri has made a significant contribution to the Irish legacy. From 1995-2001, Mainieri and the Irish have stretched Murphy's string of 40-win seasons to 13, highlighted by appearances in the NCAA tourna­ment the past three years and the program's first No. 1 ranking, which occurred during play last season. 
"I knew [the team] was in very capable hands -those of the guy I recommended for the job and thought of as a tremendous coach and a friend," Murphy said of his successor. "With the success they've had, I see that they're always in there. I couldn't tell you the names or the exact stuff some­times. but I can tell you they con­tinue to be very, very good." 
Now Mainieri is becoming a coaching commodity across the nation to teams hoping to lure him away from South Bend. Word was that several teams made some lucrative offers but were turned down by the Irish skipper. 
"I can tell you this: I don't have any deep aspirations that there's a better job out there for me," Mainieri said. "I don't sit around and say. 'Boy. if only I could go to that school.' I don't have any feel­ings about any other school out there." 
Although Mainieri was careful not to pull a Rick Pitino by guaran­teeing that he would never leave, it seems safe to say that he feels very comfortable in his present position. 
"You never say 'never' to any­thing," Mainieri said. "If I were to say that absolutely, unequivocally there would never be anything else, and then something blew you away with the opportunity or if you just wanted a new challenge at some point in your life, you don't want people to think you're a liar. That's why I never say 'never' to anything. But I can tell you that I don't have any other aspirations of any other job out there. I think I've got the best job."

California and a two-run victory at Oklahoma, the Sun Devils are 26-15 and 9-6 in their conference. 
"We're real young this year, real young," Murphy said. "We are very inexperienced and very injured. It came at a bad time, but we're still hanging in there." 
Arizona State is led at the plate by outfield­ers Andre Ethier and Jon Sheaffer, both hit­ting . 36 7 on the year. 
Even though the Sun Devils will prove a daunting opponent for the Irish, especially during a Big East break week, coach Paul Mainieri says his team relishes the opportuni­ty to play such top competition. 
"We are extremely excited about the opportunity to play Arizona State University because ifs a school that has represented excellence in college baseball through the years," Mainieri said. "They represent great­ness. That's where Notre Dame wants to get in the sport of baseball. They are to college baseball what Notre Dame is to football. From that standpoint, I think our players are very excited about that challenge." 
Conditions around Eck Stadium Thursday were extremely helpful to hitters as a steady 20 mile-per-hour wind blew straight out to center field. With an Arizona State team that has been known for its power and the emer­gence of several long-ball hitters for the Irish, conditions could be difficult for pitchers dur­ing the two-game series. 
"If this wind blows like it is today, it's going to be a bizarre game," Mainieri said Thursday afternoon. "There will be a lot of things happening, but I don't know who it will be an advantage to. I know that we get the last at-bat, and that's always important when the wind's blowing out, because they'll have to get us out in that last inning."

Men's and women's squads to race at Drake 
By NOAH AMSTADTER Senior Staff Writer 
Both the Irish men's and women's 4x400-meter relay teams qualified to compete at this weekend's Drake Relays in Des Moines, Iowa. 
But when they take the track, they face completely dif­ferent odds. 
The women's squad -com­prised of sophomores Ayesha Boyd and Kristen Dodd, junior Kymia Love and senior Liz Grow -currently ranks near the top in the country. 
While the team is confident it can come away from Drake with a gold medal, the focus is on running an NCAA Championships automatic qualifying time of 3;33. 
"We should run a 3:33 and hopefully automatically get into nationals," Grow said. "We know our team's capable of doing it, so we just now want to get this out of the way." 
The same team competed at Drake last season, beating a highly ranked Baylor team in the prelims before finishing fourth in the finals with a time of3:37.&3.

Drake as well. Junior Betsy Lazerri is competing in the heptathlon. the only female athlete outside the relay team running for the Irish. 
On the men's side, both freshman Selim Nurudeen and sophomore Napoleon Suarez competed in the 400-meter hurdles Thursday. Suarez fin­ished seventh in his heat, fin­ishing in a time of 54.22, while Nurudeen finished eighth in his heat in 56.72. Nurudeen also competes in the prelims of the 110-meter hurdles today. 
Irish head coach Joe Piane has been highly impressed with Nurudeen's progress this season, even comparing him to former Irish All-American Errol Williams. 
"Selim's consistent," Piane said. "He's doing very well when you consider he's only a freshman. He's running proba­bly as well or better than Errol Williams did at the same stage." 
The Irish distance squad is fielding a 4xl-mile relay group, with senior Pat Conway, sophomore Kevin Somok, freshman Eric Morrison and senior Luke Watson comprising the squad. 
"It's a great field, and Drake is one of the most fun meets that we go to all season," Watson said. "A victory would be great. Other than that, we just want to have a good time." 
The Irish are also sending two field events athletes to Drake -junior javelin thrower Mike Madigan and senior dis­cus thrower Derek Dyer. 
Madigan, who sat out of competition last weekend to take the MCATs, is recovering from a sore elbow. so field events coach Scott Windsor thinks he took his tests at the right time. 
"I think his elbow is better," Windsor said. "He got past the MCATs, he did okay. That weekend off actually turned out to be a blessing in disguise for him." 
Dyer, who competed in California at the Mt. SAC and Pomona invitationals last weekend, is looking for consis­tency in the discus. 
"He had between a 170 and 175 [foot) discus warm-up [throw in California]. and he gets to the competition and it's like he tightens up," Windsor said. "He just needs to learn how to relax and let his body do what it's trained to do, and it'll do it. He's getting way too tensed up." 
The rest of the Irish athletes compete at the Boilermaker Open at Purdue on Saturday, with events beginning at 9

WOMEN'S ROWING 
Big East field up next for Irish ro-wers 
By MARK ZAVODNYIK 
Sports Writer 
After a week off, the Notre Dame Women's rowing team returns to action this week­end at the Big East Rowing Challenge in Worcester. Mass. 
Other than Miami and Villanova, the Irish have yet to face any Big East foes this year. 
"This is a chance for our region to see others in the league," said head coach Martin Stone. 
Over the past two weeks, the Irish have taken advan­tage of the opportunity to do some late-season training. 
Head coach Martin Stone made sure that the Irish uti­lized the sunny weather by doing some rigorous work. 
"We used the last two weeks to gain speed. We went through some of our most difficult training cycles," said Stone. 
The Irish will enter teams in five of the six events in the regatta. Notre Dame will race the first varsity eight, the second varsity eight, two boats in thevarsity four, the first novice eight and the second novice eight. 
Notre Dame is seeded sec­ond in all of the races except the second varsity eight race, which they are seeded first. 
"We are very excited; every boat has the capability of winning," said sophomore Jayme Szefc. 
Even though the Irish were ranked ninth nationally last week and No. 10 this week, they are not concerned abnut not getting more No. 1 seeds in this weekend's regatta. 
"Seeding is an inexact sci­ence. Everybody gains speed over the course of the sea­son," said Stone. 
However, this acclaim on the national level has had some effect on the team's training. 
"Coach expects us to train even harder now that we are ranked in the top 10," said Szefc. 
There is more at stake at the Big East Rowing Challenge than just bragging rights. This is the first in a number of races that deter­mines which teams get to race in the NCAA Championships on June 1 and 2 in Indianapolis. 
"If we win, it helps solidify our chance for the NCAA Championships," Stone said. 
The location for this week end's race is an ideal for a big regatta. The teams will be racing at Lake Quinsigamond. 
"It's a great traditional rowing course. They have had Olympic trials there in the past. It holds major races each year," said Stone. 
With their earlier strong performances this year, cou­pled with intensive training, Stone and the Irish are feel­ing confident. 
"I feel really positive. All of our boats have gained speed. There is no indication that we have slowed down at all," said Stone. 
As with any other regatt,a the Irish expect to win this weekend. 
"We are going in to come out Big East champions."

"We talked about f r o m it going in, and Irish coach Pomeroy 
we knew it was going to be hard. It's tough to really get excited and get up. We just had to take care of busi­ness today, and we did." 
Using Liz Hartmann 's second game-winning home run in as many games and senior Jenny Kriech's first career home run at Ivy Field, the Irish defeated the Mastodons 5-1. The victory extended Notre Dame's win streak to eight games and improved the squad's record to 29-13. 
IUPU-FW jumped on the board in the first with its only run of the game, off Notre Dame pitcher Carrie Wisen. IUPU-FW third baseman Sonia Atienzo led off the game with a single. After Wisen struck out pitcher Mindy Pomeroy, shortstop Angela Grabczak drove a triple to the gap in right center, scoring 
over the left­field fence, giving the Irish a 3-1 lead. 
"(Batting] feels good right now," Hartmann said. "I feel relaxed, and I feel like my hands are flowing where they should." 
With three wins in the past eight days coming on go-ahead hits by freshmen, the Irish are finally benefiting from giving the first-year players early playing time. 
"For our freshmen to come in and do what they've done this year, is huge," Gumpf said. "And what that does, it just takes the pressure off everybody else. I think a big part of it is putting those freshman into the fire like we did in the beginning of the year. So now, they have experi­enced everything. And it has really helped." 
Kriech used her glove and bat to seal the game for Notre Dame. Her diving catch on Mandy Jaffe's fly ball prevented the Mastodons from getting the lead off hitter on base in the fifth. 
Then in the sixth, Kriech made IUPU-FW pay for their fourth error of the game. Second baseman Alexis Madrid reached the miscue by Nicole Stoppenhagen. the second short­stop on the day for the Mastodons. Kriech hit the 2-0 pitch over the center-field fence and finally got her home run at Ivy Field. 
"I think Jenny had a great day," Gumpf said. "I think Jenny hit the ball, and she played great defensively." 
Wisen went the distance for the Irish and improved to 12-4 on the season. The freshman gave up four hits, walked two and struck out 11 but didn't have her best stuff. 
"I just don't think she [Wisen] was as sharp as she usually is," Gumpf said. "I think she just wasn't as sharp." 
This weekend, Notre Dame plays its final Big East road games, with doubleheaders at Boston College Saturday and Providence Sunday. The Eagles are in fourth place in the confer­ence, while the Friars are 4-12 in the Big East. 
"They are both scrappy, and they are both good," Gumpf said. "BC just swept Syracuse, so that tells you right there {how good they are] .... They are two good teams that are going to be pumped and ready for us. We have to go in there and just get after it."

Showdown at the Eck 
 Former Irish coach brings 17th­ranked Sun Devils 
By CHRIS FEDERICO 
Sports Editor 
Today, the Notre Dame baseball team hosts 17th­ranked Arizona State, led by former Irish coach Pat Murphy. The game marks the first time the former Irish coach returns to campus after taking the head baseball coach job with the Sun Devils in 1995. 
"I don't want [the games] to be about me," Murphy said. "I want it to be about the play­ers. I think the most special thing about Notre Dame is the people that go to school here. That's what I learned from being here seven years. The people that go to school here are really special, and I want our kids to experience what it's like." 
The Irish have been playing some of their best ball of the season, winning 11 straight and 20 of their last 22.

Quality coaches collide 
Sometimes it seems like things just work out for the best. 
Today the Irish baseball team hosts Arizona 
State-and former Notre Dame head coach Pat Murphy -fora two-game series against the

ranked Sun 
Devils. 
It will be Murphy's Sports Editor first trip back to campus since 1995, when he became the first head coach in Notre Dame history to leave for anoth­er position. 
"It's really special just to be back," Murphy said. "It's a spe­cial place in my life because it's done so much for me. Notre Dame has been a part of my life even before I coached here ­just being a tremendous fan."

BOOKSTORE BASKETBALL XXXI 
No. 6 Splitters knock out SP Shockers again 
By MIKE CONNOLLY Senior StaffWriter 
Van Giles inside game opened up the Splitters outside shooters as the No. 6 seed beat No. 11 SP Shockers II, 21-14. 
Giles consistently scored on the inside, picking up six points and demanding double teams almost every possession. 
"Usually if I can start hitting some bas­kets, they have to start putting two peo­ple on me; then I can kick it out for open shots," Giles said. 
While the Splitters moved the ball around effectively for open looks, the Shockers went cold early on and couldn't
... 
buy a bucket. The Splitters opened a 12­3 lead before the Shockers finally started scoring. 
'They were a tough team. I give them a lot of credit but we just couldn't hit any shots early on," the Shocker's Ben Gilfillan said. 
This is the second year in a row that the Splitters have eliminated the Shockers. Last year the Splitters beat the Shockers in the round of 32. 
"We were hoping for some revenge but it just didn't happen. They are a senior team so that's all right. We are all just sophomores. We'll be back next year," Gilfillan said. 
The victory was in part a statement a game, according to Giles. He said his team, the pre-tournament No. 4 seed, was very upset about being dropped down to No. 6. Commissioners cited an ankle injury to Splitter's Matt Wolbeck as the reason for the downgrade in ranking. Wolbeck played Thursday's game with a brace on his ankle, but it did not appear to affect his game. 
"Everyone keeps talking about the ankle, but you saw he played fine today," Giles said. "We are tired of hearing about the ankle." 
The Splitters will face third-seeded Project Mayhem in the elite eight. Thanks to the hot shooting of Dan Lustig, Project Mayhem defeated What the Hell are Robster Craws?, 21-16.

. Mourning Wood and Dime Pieces go to extra time for decision 
By ANDY TROEGER Sports Writer 
While the top seven seeds were chal­lenged in Bookstore Basketball action Thursday, all of them held form to advance in tightly contested games. 
The most competitive game of the evening came in the No. 7 seed vs. No. 10 seed game where seventh-ranked Mourning Wood knocked off 10th­ranked Dime Pieces 23-21. 
"It was a real good game," said Wood's Brett Gansen. "There were a lot of fouls. Matt Panzer and Steve Llckus came up big for us." 
The game was tied at 10 before Wood rolled to a 15-12 lead. Pieces tied the game again at 17, but again Wood rolled off consecutive hoops to regain the lead at 19-17. That lead was short-lived as Pieces quickly closed to tie the game again at 19. 
With the game tied again at 20, both teams missed three opportunities to take the lead, including two missed free throws by Pieces. The tie was broken when Panzer hit a basket to give Wood a 21-20 lead. Pieces came back to tie it at 21 on their next possession before another Panzer basket gave Wood the lead for good. Lickus scored the final point in Wood's win. 
"The game was fought hard to the end," said Pieces' Phillip Madonia. "We had our chances, but it was a great game. They just ended up with more points than us." 
"We were a little bigger," added Gansen. "and our size helped us out in the end." 
No. 1 seed black J.A.C.K.S. was chal­lenged by Team 524 before advancing 21-17. Team 524 jumped to a 5-3 lead and tied the game at 11 before J .A.C.K.S scored three straight to take the lead for good.
