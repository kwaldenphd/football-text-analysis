In Brief 
Red would signal "no sale" under a proposal in San­ford, Fla. to color-code the licenses of drunken drivers and thereby restrict their consumption of alcohol. Law enforcement officials and legislators praised the idea, but predicted heavy lobbying against it by vendors of alcoholic beverages. Under the proposed legislation, everyone or­dering a drink at a bar would have to show his driver's license. '!'hose holding red licenses would be refused ser­vice, by law. -Associated Press 
Flying South for the winter is what the Wham-0 Company will be doing when it moves its plant out of Southern California and into Mexico. The company, which produces a half-million Frisbee flying discs a year, is making the move in an effort to be more competitive, according to an announcement made Tuesday by Larry Frazier, manager for the company's San Gabriel, Califor­nia plant. -Associated Press 
The anti-smoking movement has a new gimmick: black-bordered death announcements that tell congress­men one of their constituents has died of a tobacco-related illness. The physicians who started the campaign hope the death notices will personalize some of the 350,000 deaths of current and former smokers. The tobacco industry called them "media hype" and a "grotesque exploitation of personal tragedy,'' an analysis that angered physicians who intend to send the postcards to Washington. -Associ­ated Press

Impoverished Americans should not be patronized 
"Ninety percent of the young people of the ghetto never come in conflict with the law ... Despite the overwhelming odds, the majority ofpeople in the ghetto go on living, go on hoping, go on striving. This is the miracle." 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote these words concerning poverty in America more than 20 
years ago. Poverty is about as timeless as the sun, the moon and the British Crown. King's statement, then, is still applicable to today's society. 
Each time I visit a large city, I try to notice little quirks of human nature that I wouldn't normally have the opportunity to see. (Being a "Bender," it's always fun when I have the chance to expand my mind by really seeing the world.) On a recent trip to Chicago, I noticed two opposite ends of the sociological spectrum. The beggars, representing blatant poverty, first caught my eye, and then the Yuppies appeared on the scene during rush hour. 
The appearance of the beggars stood in direct contrast to that of the industrious Yuppies, who looked like they had just pranced off the pages of Vogue, Cosmopolitan and Gentleman's Quar­
terly. These Young Urban Professionals had 
success written all over their faces. 
But it was the beggars on the street asking for money who really touched my heart. Anyone's first reaction to such a sight might have been one of horror, pity or despair (for the poverty-stricken person and for modern American society in general). These were my first reactions as well. 
But, either I'm a tremendous fan of Charles Dickens (who admired the values, ethics and the determination of Victorian society's desti­tute), or I'm simply a hopeless romantic. The heroic spirit of the impoverished really inspired me. They reflect courageousness, willingness, and true independence. Even the most cynical among us, must admire these qualities. 
A friend of mine commented that the poor didn't need to take refuge in the streets because there were shelters for them to visit in times of trouble. This is true, and in many instances shelters are necessary for people to take refuge. These shelters also help people to make a new start, or they offer opportunities the poor would not have otherwise. 
Shelters do not necessarily take away inde­pendence from people, but the situation is "dif­ferent" for the souls who decide to rough it out on their own. This "roughing-it" attitude

represents a umquely American theme. The United States is renowned for its frontier-spirit, and the independent poor represent a modern frontier-mentality in this country. 
There are numerous opportunities for many students in the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Com­munity to help relieve the plight of the poor. Unfortunately, it is also very easy to patronize this segment of society. 
What some people need to realize is what Dickens realized over 100 years ago. Many of the impoverished may be unable to implement direct change in their present economic situa­tions, but that does not mean the poor are not as moral and independent as anyone else on these two campuses. 
At any rate, the beggars, who for instance played their guitars and saxophones on the street-corners for any pittance that was thrown into their instrument cases, did honest justice to their art. Like their music, the beggars should be recognized, not patronized, for the inspiring contributions which they make.

Reagan's chief of communications adds name to list of resignations 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Patrick Buchanan, President Reagan's combative chief of communi­cations, added his name Tues­day to a growing list of admin­istration resignations, saying he could work for conservative causes more effectively out­side the White House. 
Buchanan, who announced last month that he would not run for president, has seemed frustrated in his two-year cam­paign to get the administration to follow a hardline conserva­tive script. 
Announcing the resignation, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Buchanan "feels he can better influence the issues and politics of 1988 and the direction of the conser­vative movement and Republi­can Party by speaking and writing from a vantage point outside the White House." 
He will leave the $77,400-a­year job March 1, joining an exodus of top administration officials departing with two years left in the administra­tion. 
Fitzwater said the turnover was healthy. "You get a lot of new blood in ... It's good to get new energies in for the last drive." 
Some people delayed their departure, Fitzwater said, "because of the Iranian situa­tion and didn't want to leave while there was difficulty." He was referring to the contro­versy over the secret sale of arms to Iran and the diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels. 
That affair produced a shakeup in Reagan's National Security Council staff and cost the president his national se­

curity adviser, John Poindexter (replaced by Frank Carlucci) and a top aide on the NSC, Oliver North. 
In addition, Reagan has lost his longtime spokesman, Larry Speakes and his deputy, Peter Roussel; CIA director William Casey; political adviser Mitchell Daniels; Cabinet sec­retary Alfred King on; drug­abuse adviser Carlton Turner; and the president's doctor, T. Burton Smith. 
Fitzwater also acknowledged there seems to be "kind of open speculation around town" that Richard Perle, a top adminis­tration policy-maker in arms control, is poised to resign as an assistant secretary of defense. 
He said that Donald Regan would not resign as Reagan's chief of staff, as has been urged by members of Congress and others in the wake of the Iran­Contra scandal.

Liberace comatose, nears death 
Associated Press 
PALM SPRINGS, Calif. ­Liberace lapsed into a coma Tuesday, and a priest was called to prepare for last rites as family and friends kept a vigil at the pianist's desert home, his lawyer said. 
Fans had lighted candles on the curbstone outside the 67-year-old star's home Monday night and remained gathered outside Tuesday. 
"His pulse has gotten weaker, and his breathing has gotten more labored," attorney Joel Strote said out­side the house during a news briefing Tuesday evening. "He can't swallow." 
"He is comatose," Strote said. " ... He is very pale but obviously resting very comfortably. He's not in any pain and basically his family is here--his sister, his deceased brother's wife Laura, his sister's daughter and her husband." 
Asked how long he might survive, Strote said, "It's hard to estimate, but obvi­ously it's not going to be long." 
"It's real touch and go," said his publicist, Denise Collier, by telephone from New York. She said Liberace suffers from anemia, emphysema and heart disease. A spokesman last week denied a published report that he had AIDS. 
Strote said there were no plans to hospitalize Liberace because "there is really nothing that could be done for him in a hospital, and it was his desire to rest com­fortably at home."

Officials propose mandatory AIDS testing in hospitals 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Federal health officials, worried by an in­crease in AIDS among heterosexuals, said Tuesday they may recommend that AIDS blood tests be mandatory for all patients admitted to hospitals and even couples ap­plying for marriage licenses. 
The test for antibodies to the AIDS virus now is required only for blood donors. 
The federal Center for Dis­ease Control has invited 250 public health officials to At­lanta for a public hearing to discuss its proposal, said Dr. Walter Dowdle, the CDC's AIDS director. 
Those invited to the hearing Feb. 24-25 include members of civil liberties groups, who may oppose the proposal, Dowdle said. 
The CDC will decide after the hearing whether to make a for­mal proposal about expanded

Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, moni­tored in Nicosia, quoted a 
Foreign Ministry spokesman in Tehran as denying a U.S. news media report that Waite was in the hands of the Revolutionary Guards in the Bekaa. 
The spokesman said the report was "fabricated by im­testing for AIDS. Such a recom­mendation that state hospitals or government agencies make the tests mandatory would not be binding on them, Dowdle said. 
"What the meeting is really about is to explore the issues related to using the test to prevent further infection. We're looking for a public forum," Dowdle said in an in­terview. "We're saying these are the ways the test might be used. Here are the justifica­tions, here are the obstacles." 
One obstacle, he said, could be a concern over confiden­tiality. Hospitals and govern­ment agencies would have to ensure that test results remain secret to prevent discrimina­tion against AIDS carriers, he said. 
"The person who benefits from the test is the individuai and the contacts of that indi­vidual," Dowdle said.

Big House pay boost takes temporary effect 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Congress allowed itself a $12,100 pay raise, at least temporarily, when the House let pass a mid­night Tuesday deadline for rejecting the hefty pay in­crease. 
Democratic leaders said the House would pass Senate­approved legislation on Wed­nesday that gives $50 million to the homeless and also disap­proves the pay raise. 
But House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of California said it was unclear whether that ac­tion would, in fact, repeal the pay raise because the vote would take place after the mid­night Tuesday deadline. 
Still Coelho said, "There's still going to be a vote" later to repeal the pay raise. "Don't create the impression that we've voided all opportunity" for a repeal, he told reporters. 
House leaders deliberately delayed action on the pay raise by adjourning for the day in early afternoon. When Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., motioned for adjournment, opponents quickly called for a vote but lost 221-17. 
The maneuver brought a firestorm of protest to an issue that is always a nightmare for lawmakers who want a pay raise but are fearful of the po­litical consequences of voting for one. 
Rep. Connie Mack, R-Fla., 
called the adjournment maneu­ver a cleverly designed smokescreen. "We've lost credibility" with the back-door move, he said. 
"The House leadership acted like a thief in the night, skulk­ing away with its ill-gotten gains," added Rep. Tom Petri, R-Wis. 
Consumer advocate Ralph Nader said the maneuver "added treachery to their ar­rogant and avaricious behav­ior," and warned that the public outcry would force Congress to relent. 
In addition to elevating con­gressional pay to $89,500 from the current $77,400, substantial raises were in line for 3,000 high-ranking federal officials and judges. 
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, acknowledged that pay increases for the federal judiciary were a stickier issue because the Constitution for­bids rescission of a judge's pay raise. 
The Senate turned down the pay raises last week, leaving the politically sensitive issue squarely in the House's corner and raising the hackles of some representatives. 
Rep. William Ford, D-Mich., said the senators were trying to "look like heroes and then run for home. That's how I feel about their ungentlemanly con­duct."

Responsible drinking must be allowed on campus 
It appears that last semester's drunk driving accidents have produced their only possible positive result: students are finally dealing with the problem of drinking and driving. In letters to the editor and quotes scattered throughout articles in recent issues of The Obser­ver, students have recognized that this problem is serious and that fault for the recent incidents does not lie in any one cause but in a number of different causes. 
Mike Wilkins 
here, there and back 

While some students have placed blame solely on the administration's al­cohol policy, the majority are willing to acknowledge that drinking and driving is an individual decision and people who go out to drink are going to have to decide not to drive or be willing to pay the consequences. Even students who feel the alcohol policy is the reason for the drinking and driving problem are likely to admit that, alcohol policy or no alcohol policy, people who drink must be responsible for their own ac­tions and have enough common sense not to get behind the wheel of a car. 
Although student reaction indicates most of us are willing to accept blame for the drunk driving problem on campus, reaction from members of the administration has not been nearly as positive. Associate Vice President for Residence Life John Goldrick says the alcohol policy is "not at all" to blame for the recent drunk driving problem, according to Friday's January 23 Ob­server. Fr. David Tyson, vice president for student affairs, notes that "making the alcohol policy tighter or looser is not going to solve the problem .. .I know the student body is waiting for this big bureaucratic reaction from the Univer­sity as far as I'm concerned, there isn't any." 
'The temptation to drink and drive does exist and it's furthered by a policy that has forced students to go off-campus to drink.' 
The administration's reaction to last semester's drunk driving accidents is typical of the University's approach to the issue of drinking on campus. Mem­bers of the administration have worn

blinders as they churned out policy 
upon policy, seemingly oblivious to the 
effect such policy would have on stu­
dent life. Fr. Tyson's remark that the 
University has no reaction to the drunk 
driving problem or the impact of the 
alcohol policy on the problem is just 
another example of the administra­
tion's "sweep our problems under the 
rug" approach to student life. A few 
years ago, the administration was 
awake enough to recognize an alcohol 
problem on campus, a problem that has 
been growing for some time. But rather 
than get tough with the people who 
abused alcohol, the administration 
more or less banned alcohol for the 
majority of students here. Although 
consumption of alcohol was allowed in 
some limited and unrealistic circum­
stances, the administration basically 
pushed Notre Dame's alcohol problem 
into the streets of South Bend. 

So now we have this great alcohol 
policy and there's no more drunk stu­
dents kicking holes in walls and there's 
no more guys trying to out drink each 
other in dorm basements and there's 
no more groups of girls going from 
dorm to dorm to drink and there's no 
more disgusting smell on Saturday and 
Sunday mornings. But the problems the 
alcohol policy was designed to correct 
are still there. Students are still 
abusing alcohol. The only difference is 
that now instead of going from dorm to 
dorm to drink, we're going from bar to 
bar. Instead of throwing up in our party 
rooms, we're killing each other. The 
alcohol policy hasn't worked. If anyth­
ing it has made matters worse. 

Some basic facts of college life seem 
to escape those who are making the 
rules around here. College students are 
going to drink, rules or no rules. Vir­
tually nothing can be done to change 
that. Since students are going to drink 
at college, they should at least learn to 
drink responsibly in a social atmo­
sphere. Therefore, rules should be de­
signed toward teaching and encourag­
ing students to drink responsibly. 
Permitting drinking in the limited cir­
cumstances currently allowed on 
campus does not encourage students to 
drink responsibly. It does encourage 
them to head off-campus where they 
can drink in large groups, in a party­
like atmosphere, and unfortunately, al­
most completely unsupervised. 

The second basic fact of college life overlooked by these rules is that Notre Dame is an island surrounded by, well, nothing. This isn't Indiana tTniversity or Michigan State; you can't walk out the door of your dorm, walk down the street a couple of blocks and be at your favorite watering hole. Here, if you're going off-campus, you're almost cer­tainly going to drive. Now that doesn't mean that you're necessarily going to drink and drive; by now we've all realized that is a poor decision to make. But the bottom line is, the temptation to drink and drive does exist and it's furthered by a policy that has, whether the administration is willing to admit it or not, forced students to go off­campus to drink. 
The answer is not simply to allow drinking the way it was four or more years ago. The majority of students are willing to acknowledge that there was an alcohol problem on campus and that stricter rules on alcohol were certainly needed. But attempts to solve the alco­hol problem have largely failed and have created new and more serious problems. We've tried the old policy and now a new policy is needed. Allow­ing drinking in a realistic but controlled atmosphere is needed. The administra­tion should encourage moderation and help students learn to drink responsib­ly. Students who refuse to drink respon­sibly should be punished, but room should be given for mistakes to be made. Under the current policy, if you make a mistake, you're taking your life into your hands. 
I was here almost three years ago when the alcohol policy was announced. After the protests and all the rest of the nonsense were over, many students voiced their concern that the new policy would just force students to go off campus to drink. The administration didn't want to listen, or, if they did, they didn't give much consideration to those concerns. Now there have been three drunk driving accidents here. Still the administration is unwilling to acknowledge that the alcohol policy has become part of the problem. 
Student reaction to these accidents has shown that we are learning and we know we're at fault and we're at least willing to try to work hard to correct the problem. We're learning from our mistakes. Too bad the administration can't do the same.

P.O.Box Q 

Presidential hopefuls receive encouragement 
Dear Editor: 
They said it couldn't be done. We knew we wouldn't win. We didn't want to win. But it happened. Before we knew it we were the student body president and vice president. And we were scared, real scared. But we lived through the first few weeks and things got better, much better. On February 17, elections will be held for a new pres­ident and vice president. This evening there is a mandatory meeting for prospective candidates. 
Now it's time for someone else to come out of the woodwork. Let's face it, if we can do the job, anyone can. All it takes is a little enthusiasm and creativity. We're going to be honest, you can't do everything. We had a lot of ideas that we just couldn't get away with, no matter how hard we tried. There are a lot of things that go on that

T 
here are some interviews that you just don't want to do. When presented with the rather curious assignment of interviewing television anchor person Maureen Mcfadden, I was excited. But I had some reservations: the topic of the interview, "the importance of writing" seemed rather dubious, I had never actually seen the WNDU news or Mcfad-
A look behind the news 
MARK NEMEC features writer 

P 
icture this: A Notre Dame student Danny Domer, is giving a tour of our beautiful campus to the Smith family, a group from a retirement home In Muskegon, and a man named Morty. Of course, this tour is being given when the weather is reasonable, so visibility is more than a mile. 
As the group walks along the lake behind Lyons hall, Ezekiel continues his tour. "To your left you can see the Knute Rockne memorial and to your right is the ROTC building where all four services of our country are represented." 
"What's that?" little Johnny Smith asks as he points past the ROTC building to a small two-story building with about flve radar dishes In Its back­yard, "It looks like Metroplex from the Transformers." 
"That Is WNDU," Ezekiel replies. "Channel 16 here In South Bend. But that Is too close to the real world of work for many of us, so we do not know much about it." Well friends, I think It Is time we found out about our neighbors behind the golf course. 
WNDU originally broadcast from the Center for Social Con­cerns building behind Breen­Philllps. About flve years ago they moved to their current location along U.S . .31. Accor­ding to Gary Sieber, managing editor of the newsroom, the station serves two purposes. First. they are a commercial broadcasting firm and they must assume all of the respon­sibilities that accompany that title. Secondly, they must pro­vide a learning environment for students wishing to begin a career In their field. This Is their obligation they to Notre Dame. 
A man who helps them fulfill this obligation Is Harold Kevorkian, vice president of WNDU, and professor of the telecommunications internship program at Notre Dame. A select few of his students actu­ally become Interns at WNDU to help them get started In the business. But what about those of us who are Interested In working In television but can't 
et an lnternshi ? What advice den, and from what I had heard about Maureen I was a little bit jealous. 
But when I talked to her on the telephone, -she sounded pleasant enough, so an ap­pointment was set. 
Friday found my car parked in the WNDU guest spot while I was perhaps a bit less com­modiously parked within the glass covered building. Mcfad­den was already I 0 minutes late and thoughts of "Who does she think she is?" percolated 
would we receive? 
"Try to get an M.B.A. and make more money," said Mike Collins, co-anchor of the eve­ning news. "Seriously, though, writing is extremely important. If you cannot express yourself in writing. you are of no value to us. So that is one thing you must do well. Once you get started in this business, you have to be willing to work hard for peanuts for a while until you start to move up in the business." 
Collins' partner at the anchor desk. Maureen Mcfadden, backs up his statement. "Once you are committed to this line of work. you have to take any position that is available. Whe­ther it be camerman or TV 
truck driver, you have to get started somewhere," she said. "My advice to students would be to do as many things as possible In the communica­tions field while you are at school. such as writing for The Observer or working for WVFJ." 
"There is no formula for get­ting a job in telecommunica­tions. It is just a matter of being in the right place at the right time," said Sieber. The validity of this statement is confirmed when you look at the careers of Collins and Mcfadden. 
Mike Collins graduated from Notre Dame in 1967 and after working at WSND he took a part-time job shooting sports film at WSBT, channel 22. He then accepted a job as a reporter for WNDU. "At the time, WNDU was in really bad shape. After I had been there a while, the station had both of their anchors quit within one week. I was then asked one night if I would like to anchor the news. Of course, I said yes." He has worked at WNDU for 18 years and takes pride in the fact that he has never been late for a broadcast. He also sees himself as a newsman and not a personality. "I am intensely shy among groups. Don't get me wrong. I love meeting people. But you'd never catch me just browsing through the mall. I mean, once In a while I'll go to Senior Bar because I know the students just don't care that much. They'll greet you, say a few words, and move on." Collins 
slowly to the surface. Thoughts of "What does she look like?" followed close behind. 
Maureen, (I call her Maureen now) entered fully 15 minutes late, but she looked nothing like the Jean Harlow vixen-type I had pictured. She didn't even wear a fur coat or evening gown, subtle clues that success and popularity in the South Bend area hadn't gone to her head. 
After a somewhat delayed, yet polite introduction, I was 
is married and has two children, ages 18 and three. 
Maureen Mcfadden was born and raised in South Bend. She went to Saint Joe High School and graduated from Saint Mary's in 1979. During the time near her graduation, she had an offer to work in promotion and relations for a certain com­pany but she wanted to see if anything else was available. She talked to Kevorkian and he found her a job offer at U-9.3 radio. She accepted it and be­came the U-9.3 morning news reporter. There she met Jim Dorgan, morning DJ at the time, who would soon become her husband (Sorry guys.) She worked in radio for two years before deciding that she had had enough of getting up at 2:.30 a.m. and made the switch over to television reporting. (Initially, however, she rejected an offer from Collins to be a reporter for WNDU because she was camera shy.) She reported and also hosted Studio 16, a half hour talk show, for a year, and then took over the weekend anchor position. About three years ago, when Kathy Ray, the current co­anchor with Collins, left WNDU, Maureen took over her spot and has been there ever since. 
5o what does this famous TV pair think about Notre Dame students today? 'I think they are nne,' McFadden said. 'I'm a little bit biased, however, seeing as though all my brot­hers went there and my dad taught there. Some things stu­dents do I don't always agree with but for the most part they are fine.' 
'Students haven't really changed that much,' Collins said. 'You could take an Obser­ver from ten years ago, change the names, and put It out as today's edition. The same stuff we argued about as students is the same stuff you guys are arguing about. You also are still living in the same rat-traps I lived in. Hey, I lived in Moris­sey and Cavanaugh so I know what you guys go through.' 
5o there you have It, the big story on WNDU-TV. So the next time you are on a tour of the campus and see all the radar dishes off In the distance, you can tell little Johnny all about our real world neighbors. 
welcomed to the world of 
South Bend broadcasting. We 
passed the security precau­
tions, went up the bar-guarded 
staircase and into the rather 
well-decorated conference 
room. True to my assignment 
I began immediately to ques­
tion her about the importance 
of English writing in her field., 
that of a television anchor wo­
man. 
"Writing is very important; it is one of the most important things in this job," she said to my astonishment. She laughed at my apparent shock. "That's one of the common miscon­ceptions about news anchors-­that we just read the news, either off a paper or a teletype machine. Actually, every news anchor writes his own stories, and those are the ones he reads. So if he can't write well, he's going to be the one to look embarrassed." 
"The working day for a news anchor is really quite long." she continued. "1, for example, come into the studio at 4 o'clock and go to my newsroom desk. I don't have a 'dressing room' or office or anything. I guess in that way it's a lot like a newspaper room, with all the reporters having their own desks but no privacy." she smiled and con­tinued. 
"We get the latest news from the wire services; you know them, AP, UPI. In this area we also get local wire services like NJW, Northwest Indiana Wire, and the Michi~an News Wire. We also get feeds from the major networks in Chicago." 
I then asked what happens after they get the facts from a wire service or network feed. 
"Before we do anything. the producer decides who gets to read what stories. He first decides which stories we want to air at all, and then he tries to balance the broadcast out. You know, do that I don't have to read all fluff and my male co-anchor all substance, the hard news. We also trade off reading the first band of stories; I lead one night he leads the next, or whatever." 
She then explained what hap­pens after the stories are divided between the anchors?" 
"We work on writing up the copy we are going to read that evening. That's pretty hard sometimes because you have to have a catchy opening on the stories, to 'catch' the public interest. That's one way in which the writing for news is different. You can't use the nowerly phrases of creative writing class. You have to pres­ent the facts clearly, but you have to make them interest­ing." I asked her consequently if there was any room for crea­tive writing on her job. 
"It's all creative, actually, even though we get the facts. It's just creative in a different way. Making some stories inter­esting takes a lot of creativity. 
But of course you also have be good at the basic writing skills, like grammar. That's ways the most embarrassing because, usually, you notice your grammar mistakes just you're reading the piece the air, and then it's too They actually encourage us read copy out loud before go on the air. Sometimes j before the camera rolls you can see all of us standing around reading copy to our­selves. It looks pretty funny, 
I'm sure." 
After we prepare the for the evening news show, tell the photographer or whoever is involved that we 
ask him to meet the camera crew. Most of that broadcast will be live, so what we have decide as reporters is what

nt to say and what we want

f the scene for the program. 
can also tell the camera 
n just how long we want 
m to be taking any partlcu­
shot." 
I then Inquired what kind of audience does she broadcast to? That Is, what Is their target 
ucational or economic back­
Maureen thought 
bout this for a while. 
"Of course I am always con­scious of an audience pres­ence, even though the studio Is empty of bystanders. I guess It's Impossible not to be aware with a camera on my face the whole time. But I pretty much follow station policy when I write the stories up. Reporters here are taught to use "small" words rather than big ones when they can. That doesn't mean that we believe our public Is uneducated. Not at all. Analysis had shown that our station has mainly yuppie­type viewers, the young. well­educated professional crowd. But we also have to realize that the public has only a few seconds to catch what the newscaster Is saying. They don't get to read the copy, and they probably don't get to play back the show or segment they missed. We just try to make It as easy for them as possible. We aren't aiming at the  children; our audience Is 18 and over." 
Speaking of public Image, I thought it about time to ask her about her person on the screen. "The physical is Impor­tant. of course, because everybody likes to have an at­tractive person talk to them, but no on will curl up and die If he finds out the next day that a hair was out of place. I have to wear heavy makeup on the set because the lights bleach out skin tones, but I apply everything myself. There are no makeup rooms, or anything like that." 
Thinking of the dressing room analogy, I asked her If she didn't feel like an actress while on camera at times. 
Maureen just laughed. "I really wish I were more of an actress. I took only one acting class, an Intra, at Saint Mary's when I was there. It would be easier for me on camera if I could remove myself from myself, but I can't. It's funny, I think I am more nervous now to go on the air than I was when I started. Then I was in­nocent. now I know how many, many things can go wrong while I'm up there. It's easier for me to speak In front of a crowd than in front of the camera. I'm more comfortable with real people." 
When asked which classes she had taken during her four years at Saint Mary's to prepare for her job at WNDU, Maureen had to think. "I was a speech 
 

major when I graduated, so I'm sure I took things like Public Speaking and Oral lnterp., with Reg Baln. if I can remember. I also took a lot of English and writing classes. I really enjoyed taking those. I know I took a journalism class as well, prob­ably newswrlting. I generally took a lot of liberal arts courses, though." 
I checked my watch. It was 4 pm, and I knew she had to start on her long day's work of writing. So I asked my last question on the official list. and the second last question on my mind. "What advice do you have for me, or for anyone else who would like to break Into the business?" 
"Take as many writing courses as you can," she said Immediately. "Write. Read a lot. Take creative writing classes because it can be very impor­tant when you have to pull something catchy out of your head." She smiled at me, and I felt almost ashamed to ask my last question, but I knew my friends would kill me If I didn't. She laughed as she lead me back through the studios and to the door. 
"No, tell your boyfriend and the other guys at Alumni that I don't color my hair. My hus­band and I just went on a short vacation In Florida, and the sun bleached It out. It's funny how people pay attention to those sort of details."

t's up, it's now and it's '80s. It's the social alternativeI for Winter '87. Yes, sports fans--it's broomball. And not the version played on ice by seven foot muscled jocks, mind you, but the game any ol' couch potato can master, played on South Bend's own Infamous natural resource. Yup, you guessed It--that white stuff. 
Here's your chance to show off the limits of your broomball dexterity and skill amid the dog eat dog world of TOURNAMENT PLAY. Surprise! This great fun Is all sponsored by your friendly neighborhood SAB. 
Yes, folks, It's Wlnterfest time once again, those two short weeks when we try to battle the February blahs and beer bellies.

Lifetime hour (that half-hour channel change can be just agony.) "Broomballlsjust hockey In the snow," ex­
plained tournament co-chairman Mike Arnold. "All you 
need Is a ball and a broom to play and we'll give you all 
that. Just bring your team of five and have fun. Co-ed 
teams are, of course, encouraged." 
Games are scheduled to last about half an hour so frostbite won't be a problem either. The rules for the game are few. The tournament begins Monday, Feb. 9, and continues to Saturday, Feb. 16, assuming that all teams haven't been eliminated by then. "We can't let the game get too rough, and there Is no kicking the ball, but just about everything else Is allowed, "said Arnold. 
"We wanted something different to do In the snow since we do have to live with it, so we figured we'd have this tournament and let people have a little off-the-wall study break." added co-chairman Christian Barrett. 
To top It all off, how about a little fame, fortune, and thrill of victory? I know, you'll just take fortune, but SAB can't provide the beverage money; however It does provide food and tunes. 
"Besides the fact that It'll be a blast, we don't expect you to make a fool out of yourself for nothing. So we have prizes for the top couple of winners like a pizza party at Barnaby's or gift certificates to The Cellar," said Arnold. 
SAB Special Events Commissioner Eric Tlmperman thinks Broomball can become a big part of Wlnterfest, "The tournament Is starting out small-scale now but we would like It to become an annual event, a tradition like Bookstore Basketball," he explained. 
Tlmperman also highlights some other up-and-coming ,. Wlnterfest events. "Winterfest kicks off with a bash Friday night at Theodore's with The Bottom Line. There Is also a Bendix Woods trip, a cross-country ski race,a dorm snow-sculpture contest. and a Multiple Sclerosis Valentine's Day Dance planned--with awards for most of them." 
"Wlnterfest Is just for fun. Don't take It seriously and go out and have a good time," adds Tlmperman. 
So you're sold on broomball and want to know where to sign up? Well, just head on up to the SAB offices on the second floor of Lafortune between 9:30a.m. and 4p.m. with your creative team name and sign on the dotted line. The deadline for team signups Is Thursday, Feb. 5, so hurry and get off that couch.

any maintenance workers cut­ting branches off trees would immediately turn into the jubilant Notre Dame players cutting down the nets, a few feet above the mayhem on the floor. The fact is, this year's squad set the type for its place in the pages of Notre Dame history with the upset over North Carolina. They erased the nightmare of blowing an 11­point lead while succumbing to UCLA's pressure defense and the disillusionment of not being able to come up with a big play to overcome West Virginia. This team, seemingly strug­gling to elevate itelf above mediocrity, has skinned the top dog. And nobody will be able to take that away from them. 
But the team must really turn its attention forward to make the big win as beneficial for them as possible. must forget the glory of day on the big stage. I, on 
other hand, am just a fan. I'm going to savor it for a while

Knight fights back against council criticism by putting his nose in council flower debate 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. Indiana Coach Bob Knight is of­fering his help in resolving a Faculty Council debate on flowers. He says it's his way of showing his appreciation for the council'sinterest in basket­ball. 
Knight, referring to the coun­cil's recent condemnation of verbal and physical abuse of athletes by coaches, sarcastically said he wasn't up­set with the intrusion into his domain. 
And in his weekly television show on Sunday, Knight referred to a bouquet of red 

NV A Olympiad brings people out to compete for Special Olympics 
By THERESA KELLY Sports Writer 
While the real Olympic Games are still a year away, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students will be able to partic­ipate in their own Late Night Olympics, Friday, February 13 from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. in the ACC. 
Sponsored by Non-Varsity Athletics to benefit the St. Joseph County Special Olym­pics, the Late Night Olympics will pit 12 teams of combined dorms against each other in a large Olympic-style sports competition. In addition, there will be a Not-Quite-So-Olympic Games for those who decide to just drop in. 
"We're looking for each team to register and participate in every event," said Sally Deren­goski, Assistant Director of NVA. 
The Olympic sports will in­clude a co-ree obstacle course, broomball, and innertube water polo. Also planped are water lacrosse and Nerf foot­ball for men, as well as tour­naments for men and women in volleyball, indoor soccer, basketball, and racquetball. 
The teams will be made up of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's dorms. Each team antes $100, and earns points for participating in as well as win­ning events. The overall points winner and St. Joseph County Special Olympics will split the proceeds from the event. The grand prize will be awarded and distributed among the two or three halls of the winning team. Donations to the Special Olympics will be accepted. 

Students interested in par­ticipating in the Olympic sports should contact their dorm rep­resentative. The deadline for registration is Monday, February 9. 
In addition to the Olympic events, the Not-Quite-So­Olympic Games also will be held. These games will include such sports as darts, putt-putt, Nerf basketball, pool, and a celebrity dunk tank. 
A Soc Hop will be held by WVFI and the Student Activi­ties Board in the Monogram Room, while University Food Services will sponsor an Olym­pic Village Cafe on the main concourse. 
Derengoski claims the key to the Late Night Olympics is the advanced registration. 
"I have no doubt that people will be interested and excited," she said. "They have to contact their dorm reps for all the in­
formation." 
"We have all the halls com­mitted, with great support from the Hall President's Council," she added, noting that no dorm events have been planned that would conflict with the Late Night Olympics. 
The event will use nearly every facility in the ACC, in­cluding the ice rink, fieldhouse, and pools. 
"We have so much planned, this should go over big," said Derengoski, who also hopes this will become an annual event. "We are fortunate to have so many people interested in making it a success." 
People who fail to sign up for the Olympic sports will not be left out. The Not-Quite-So­Olympic events, the dance, and other events are planned for drop-ins. 
The 12 teams taking part in the Olympic competition, meanwhile, will be constituted in the following manner: PangbornCarrolWarley, Fis­herMowardPasquerilla West, St. Ed'&SoriM..yons, Alumni /August&McCandless, Cavanaugh Moly Cross(ND) !Breen-Phillips, DillorvRegina, Flanner !Walsh, Grace-Badin, Keenan Moly Cross(SMC), Morrissey !Pasquerilla East, Stanford-Lewis, and Zahm !LeMans. 
SMC sets new goal for itself after 65-56 win over St. Fran 
By MARISA A KOSLA Sports Writer 
After defeating league rival St. Francis, 65-56, Saturday at the Angela AthletiQ Facility, the Saint Mary's basketball team has set a new goal. For the win Saturday pushed the Belles record on the season to 8-5 and moved them one step closer to District competition. 
"The team has really pulled together," said Saint Mary's head coach Marvin Wood. "After this weekend's big win the squad is treating every game like a playoff game." 
The keys to the victory over St. Francis came from an ag­gressive offense led by fresh­man Julie Radke, who posted 17 points. Junior Tammye Radke, meanwhile, also chipped in with 11 points while Rachel Bir added 10 points. 
The Belles attribute their recent success to a much greater utilization of their strengths. A balanced offense, coupled with intense rebound-

ing, have placed the team at the top of the NAJA. 
The squad, however, realizes their weakness in the area of consistency, and knows it must maintain an unrelenting inten­sity if it is to reach its new goal of going to Districts. 
"We are the talk of the dis­trict," noted Wood, "because we have beaten some of the best teams while falling to other opponents." 
Another thing Wood and his Belles squad must have if they are going to play in the postseason is the continued contributions of players such as senior Kim Pantelleris, junior Stephanie Duke, and sophomore Jennifer Harte, each of whom complements the Radke sisters and Bir on the court. 
The Belles as a team, mean­while, will get the opportunity to move another step closer to their new goal when they take on Taylor University Saturday at 1 p.m. at the Angela Athletic Facility. 

roses placed between him and host Chuck Marlowe, telling viewers to be sure not to miss the third segment of his show when he would explain the sig­nificance of the flowers. 
When the segment of the show arrived, Knight began: 
"I just kind of figured that the taxpayers of Indiana have paid my salary to coach bas­ketball and I've not gotten into teaching geometry, or physics, or philosophy or anything else," he said. "I've just tried to stick to basketball. 
"To me, I'm not at all upset with that. Knowing how much time I have to put into teaching basketball, for those professors to take time away from their classrooms and their students, to devote it to basketball, just pleases me tremendously, Chuck." 
"I've g6t a suggestion. Since our (university) colors are red and white and everbody likes those colors, why not roses? What's more emblematic of America and what's good about America than roses." 
Knight urged all those who "like roses and the idea of red and white roses instead of petunias or daffodils, write a note to the Bloomington Fac­ulty Council, simply care of In­diana University, Bloomington, Indiana.

Bunek and Botham were not to 
be denied late in the game. 
"This was a good game for 
both Heidi and Sandy, and 
that's very important for us," 
DiStanislao said. "(Western 
Michigan) knew we were 
looking inside and they really 
packed it down. Our ball move­
ment made it so that some gaps 
would open up, and the girls 
found them. It's a real plus to 
see both of them playing well 
at the same time." . The Irish led by as much as 
12 points early in the second 
half after poor shooting (39 per­
cent) plagued Western Mic­
higan in the first 20 minutes, 
but the Broncos' speed began 
to pay off with just over 10 
minutes to play. 
Some nifty inside moves by 
leading Bronco scorer Shannon 
Pickell (17 points) brought 
Western Michigan closer and 
closer, and a Tracy Wells feed 
to Alletta Miller off a fast break 
with slightly less than eight 
minutes to play gave the 
visitors their only lead of the 
game at 52-51. 
A pair of Botham fade-a ways from the baseline put Notre Dame back on top, however, and some key rebounding and inside play down the stretch locked up the win for the Irish, their second in a row. 
"One crucial thing that we've got to work on is our rebound­ing," said DiStanislao, whose squad outboarded the smaller Broncos, 41-39. "We said ear­lier that we had to improve our numbers somewhere, and that rebounding was a good place to do it. We've been having the guards hit the boards a lot more recently and it worked pretty well tonight." 
So well, in fact, that Gavin collected a personal-best eight rebounds in the game, while Toney added six. 
For Western Michigan, last night's loss was its third in a row after starting the cam­paign on a blistering pace. It was also the first time the Broncos have been held to less than 60 points all season. 
The Irish will look to make it three in a row on Saturday when they face a quick Miami (Fla.) team at 1 p.m. at the ACC.

Irish send out message with win over Broncos 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame women's basketball team used Tuesday night's contest against Western Michigan to send out a message to the remaining schools on its 1986-87 schedule. 
Attention, all who are expect­ing the 6-12 Irish to roll over and play dead: this team is playing some ball. 
The high-powered, run-and­gun Broncos made a contest of last night's 65-58 Notre Dame victory with a timely second­half spurt, but the Irish con­trolled both ends of the floor for most of the game and kept their composure in the waning minutes to seal the win. 
"Western Michigan is not a 13-5 team for nothing," said Notre Dame head coach Mary DiStanislao. "They're very ag­gressive and scrappy--a senior 

LaSalle hoping for big ND letdown as teams prepare to battle tonight 
By PETE GEGEN Assistant Sports Editor 
Here's the picture. The Irish are just off one of the biggest wins in Notre Dame basketball history. The players have been watching tapes of the NBC coverage. Banners are flying from dorm windows. Fans are still congratulating the players on the victory. 
Meanwhile, LaSalle is in town preparing for tonight's 
7:30 contest at the ACC. The Explorers have to be hoping for the one thing which usually fol­lows big victories--an Irish let­down. 
"We have to put that all be­hind us," said Irish forward Mark Stevenson. "We still have some tough games left. We'll team. When it was crunch time, they came out and crunched. 
"It's frightening when a team throws a press on you-­especially a successful one--but I thought Didi (sophomore Diondra Toney) and Mary (junior Mary Gavin) really controlled the game when they had to." 
Gavin dished out 11 assists and added 11 points in the game, while Toney chipped in for nine points and set up six Notre Dame buckets. 
But last night's messengers of the recent emergence of the Irish were spreading the word in the paint. Heidi Bunek, a 6-4 sophomore, and 6-2 junior Sandy Botham poured in 19 and 15 points, respectively, and were both in double-figures on the boards with 11 and 10, respectively. 
Even against the packed­down zone of the Broncos, see BRONCOS, page 14 
just try to build on the game we just played." 
LaSalle definitely is not a team to be taken lightly. The Explorers are 11-9, including a 93-86 win over Villanova. And perhaps even more impres­sive, they lost narrowly to both North Carolina, 79-72, and DePaul, 58-54. 
"I really like the way LaSalle plays," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps. "They're scrappy and they hustle, and they really impressed me the way they gave North Carolina fits." 
The Explorers boast one of the hottest freshman players in the country. Forward Lionel Simmons is the leading rookie scorer in the country with an 
18.6 points-per-game average.

"Lionel Simmons is one of the most impressive freshmen I've seen this year," said Phelps. "He's obviously had a huge impact on their team from a scoring and rebounding standpoint, and he really gives them the kind of force you need on the boards." 
LaSalle also has experience in the form of 6-7 senior for­ward Larry Koretz and 6-4 junior guard Tim Legler. Com­bined with 6-1 junior guard Rich Tarr, the trio form a serious threat from three-point range, having made 40.3 per­cent of their shots.

Beating the top-ranked team in the nation is certainly cause for celebration, but it's time to get on with business. It was another historic moment in Notre Dame history, showing that Digger Phelps, the ACC and No. 1 teams mix no better than drinking and driving. The main concern now, however, lies in the remainder of the schedule. 
Notre Dame begins a crucial stretch in the schedule, one that will determine which post-season tournament it will participate in. LaSalle provides the first obstacle tonight, and the Irish will be somewhere above human and a notch below saintly if they avoid a letdown. The Explorers will certainly be searching for an upset, but if Gary Voce can continue rebounding and scoring like he did against North Carlina ... 
Knock it off. That game is over. It's time to move on. 
Well, going against Vanderbilt will be tough on the road, seeing as they are currently 7-2 at home, and they have beaten Indiana, something the Irish couldn't do. Kansas will be a chore. Danny Manning and the Jayhawks are ranked 18th in this week's AP poll and Allen Field House does not treat visitors with much respect. And Larry Brown is such a good coach that you would run out of fingers and toes if you had to count the number of offers Brown has gotten from other basketball teams, both pro and college. But if Sean Connor could launch a few three­pointers like he did Sunday against the Tar Heels . . . 
Stop it. Victories in these upcoming games would put just as big a marker in the "W" column as the North Carolina win did, even if none could approach its appeal with the NCAA tournament selection committee. A win's a win, right? 
And in less than two weeks, those Devils clad in blue from Duke will visit the ACC, to renew the respect of their ACC (Atlantic Coast Conference). They have survived the loss of two NBA first-round draft picks, Johnny Dawkins and Mark Alarie, quite nicely. Duke is ranked 16th by the AP, and it knows all about noisy crowds. Another near­spotless game will be required from the Irish to upset the Blue Devils, but they definitely can do it. Especially if David Rivers can take control in the final minutes like Sunday when he . . . 
Oh, who am I trying to kid? I can't help it if I can't get that upset off my mind. If I tried to watch the CBS Chalk­board explain anything right now, the lines would turn into streams of toilet paper like those that bombarded the floor following the first basket of Sunday's game. IfI would see a prison riot on television, it would turn into the masses of students on the floor after the game in my mind. And
