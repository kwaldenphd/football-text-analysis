Next year. the fee, whi~h has not been increased since the 1980s. will be $65. The . new revenue will be divided up among stu;. dent .organizations, with half ofit.going to clubs. 
While the raise in the fee is notas h1gh иas student body vice president Erek Nass had и originally.hoped, the Student.Unionis happy with the change. 
"Although the original proposal as,k~dJor a $15 increase~> we .и are .still pleased about the. approved increase. ThHr is something that и и has eeen long overdue on campus," Nass 
explained. 
The additional mortey will increase theи budget of student government. which stood at $477,000 for the 1997-98 academic year, to approximately $550,000. That money comes from fees paid by every student. as well as 50 percent of theи proceeds from ..The Shirt"' project.

Saint Mary's achieves School of the Year award 
By KAT RADEMACHER 
News Writer 
Life's a beach at Saint Mary's College. Or at least as far as the Indiana Residence Hall Organization Conference is concerned. 
Last Friday, 140 college students representing 12 Indiana schools arrived at Saint Mary's College for IRHOC '98. Keeping with the conferГence's theme, "Life's a Beach," the stuГdents came dressed in beach gear, ready to learn and share ideas about leadership. 
A year's worth of planning to bring recognition of Saint Mary's to the state of Indiana finally paid off last Saturday when several awards were given to both the College and several students. After a full day of attending a variety of leadership program6, the students gathered for a formal banquet that night to present awards and to close the conference.

mass honors Brumbaugh 
By COLLEEN McCARTHY 
News Writer 
Sttll recovering from the shock of Notre Dame senior Justin Brumbaugh's death on Feb. 8, those he knew, as well as those he did not, gathered to remember and celebrate the life 

. of a person who was a friend, ' an intellectual, a basketball player, a storyteller, and a son. 
Joining in prayer yesterday at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart were friends, family, hallmates from Knott and Flanner, and faculty, administrators, and clergy from the Notre Dame community. 
"We have this tradition of a memorial mass as a liturgical way of bringing people together to celebrate the life of the perГson while helping everyone else to continue to move on," said University President Father Edward Malloy, who presided over the Mass. 
"I think if there is any examГple of the Notre Dame commuГnity rallying together, [Brumbaugh's death] is it," Malloy added. 
He also said that he had received a number of letters from people outside the Notre Dame community who were friends of the Brumbaugh famiГly, and who expressed how impressed they were by the support that came from the 

, University and students. Residents of Brumbaugh's

A number of awards were presented, but the highlight for Saint Mary's was winning the bid for School of the Year. 
Don Shaner, conference veteran from the University of Evansville, shared his thoughts about the conference. 
"These ladies have been in GLACURH [Great Lakes Association of Colleges & Universities Residence Halls] and IRHO [Indiana Residence Hall 
Organization] for only two years and put on a flawless sub-regional 
conference. 
"I can't say enough about the staff and especially the coГchairs. They made our stay a memorable one,

who served as the IRI-IOC advisor. 
Reflecting on the weekend, Moskalick said, "I think this conference and our awards show how far Saint Mary's College has come and what Saint Mary's can accomplish." 
Gundler also had a positive impresГsion of the conference. 
"I am so proud of what we accomГplished this weekend. The women of the conference staff and the Saint Mary's delegation represented the school with class and pride and truly brought out the best in Saint Mary's. It was an honor to work with all of them," Gundler said. 
McNulty elaborated on Saint Mary's success. 
"This conference has been a wonderГful experience for the women of Saint Mary's College. IRHOC is a completely student run conference, and we showed the state of Indiana what the stud~nts of Saint Mary's College can do."

innocently 
Saint Mary's Assistant Sports Editor 
enough. . 
I stood in a line 
with a rowdy crew of students my freshman 
year, anxiously waiting to fill my cup with 
it. It, being that sweet substance we college 
kids take in like water. 
But since that first taste, I think it has 
become a problem. So I'm giving it up for 
Lent, just as a trial period to see how I live 
without it and to realize if it's as serious as 
what I've guessed. 
After my first swallow, I couldn't even 
stand it. The taste was overbearing and I 
practically gagged. It was way too filling 
and heavy, not to mention unhealthy for my 
preference. As my friends devoured theirs 
in seconds, I struggled to get mine down. 
But, oh, how things have changed. 
It only took a few more tries and magicalГ
ly I couldn't get enough. I'm famous for 
being able to take in more than any guy. 
Not that I'm proud of this or anything. 
As I discovered a world of tropical, sweet, 
sour, and fruity flavors, I fell in love with 
this refreshment. I became an expert at 
mixing the perfect flavors for a heavenly 
blend. 
After a long week of stress, nothing comГ
pared to that cold concoction sliding down 
my throat. When I had a full or temporarily 
empty cup in my hand, I could relax and 
make conversation with ease. It somehow 
made the world seem okay. 
Some was even labeled Lite, although this 
isn't half as good as the "real stuff." It 
claims to be made of fairly natural ingrediГ
ents, so it couldn't be too bad for me, I figГ
ured. But no matter what brand or type, I 
reveled in it. 
However, I soon began to overfndulge, 
and it started to control my life. I became 
irritable when it ran out or if a long line 
formed ahead of me. I always wanted more 
and I wanted it fast! I didn't even learn I 
had a limit until I spent hours sick one 
night. 
I realize my reputation has plummeted 
when I get "the look," mostly from other 
females. At first my friends joked about my 
large consumption, but just recently they 
took it upon themselves to "intervene." 
They said they knew all about my secret 
morning sneaks. Ashamed, I admitted the 
truth. My unchecked craving had become so 
enormous that I desired it at least three 
times every day. Sometimes I had four at 
one sitting. Technically, friends informed 
me, that meant I was bingeing. 
I've realized that this is serious. I'm 
embarrassed to admit it, but if I'm not 
indulging in it, I'm often thinking about it. I 
don't want to be like this. It has been a 
waste of time, counterproductive, and occaГ
sionally humiliating. 
That's why during Lent, I will muster all 
of my willpower and take an essential time 
out. Hopefully, I can reexamine who I really 
am and regain some control over my life. 
So right now, I'm taking this opportunity 
to make a solemn vow that will make me a 
better person. I promise myself, my friends 
and classmates, that for 40 days, despite 
peer pressure or craving, I will abstain 
from every flavor and variety of frozen 
yogurt.

Committee to examine possible grade inflation problem 
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. 
As far as grades go, a B just isn't what it used to be -and at the University, that's raising a few eyeГbrows. 
An analysis of the University's grades shows a steady climb in high marks over the last 10 years. During the next few months, a committee will look into rising grade point averages, 
an issue which plagues colleges and universities across the nation. 
At Princeton, a report released this month documents a definite grade inflation trend. The average GPA rose to 3.42 in 1997 from 3.08 in 1973. 
Similarly, the mean GPA at the University ofWashington reached 3.12 in 1996, up from 2.31 in 1964. And at Stanford University, As and Bs make up 80 percent of the grades earned. 
Compared to the higher grades at these schools, the university might be only at the doorstep of the grade inflaГ

NAACP rallies for removal of book 
STATE COLLEGE, Penn. 
Not everybody thinks a boy named Huck should be in school, so some people are trying to get him expelled Гfrom reading lists. However, these efforts to take The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn off mandatory school reading lists have left many university teachers and stuГdents arguing for its right to stay. Earlier this month the state chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People held press conferences across the state urging school districts to drop the novel from their mandatory reading lists. According to an NAACP resolution, the organization finds that the repeatГed use of racial slurs in the novel leads to well-documentГed psychological damage to African-American children's self-esteem, especially in the classroom. Reading the book should be optional, said Sandra Choute, president of the University chapter of the NAACP. "Students who find the book offensive should be able to read another book or be excused from class," Choute said. 
Ћ VALE UNIVERSITY Grad student's forgery trial begins 
NEW HAVEN, Conn. 
Tonica Jenkins, a graduate student, accused in December of forging her application to Yale's Graduate School, will attend a pre-trial hearing in New Haven Superior Court Monday. Jenkins was arrested Dec. 8 after Yale's Graduate School conducted an internal investigation, looking into allegations that Jenkins fabricated her application and recГommendations when applying to Yale's Biological and Biomedical Sciences program. She was charged with first degree larceny, second degree fraud, and attempting to escape custody. Jenkins pleaded innocent to these charges. If convicted, Jenkins could face up to 35 years in prison, said Yale Law professor Steven Duke, who added that Jenkins might only be sentenced with a year of probation if this is her first offense, after which her record would be expunged of any conviction. If this is a second offense, Duke said, a conviction could mean a year of imprisonment.

Possibilities include better academГically prepared students, increasing instruction and grading by nonГtenured professors, and changing philosophies about what grades meaГsure. 
A subcommittee of the university Senate's Committee on Educational Policy is examining whether grade inflation is a problem at the university.

Friends find body of missing student 
TUCSON, Ariz. 
Friends of Anton Bakker said his mother's intuition 
yesterday led them to his body two miles downstream 
from the 80-foot waterfall he tumbled over Sunday 
while trying to rescue a friend's dog. A friend spotted 
Bakker, University of Arizona economics senior. at 
11:30 a.m. two miles downstream from Tanque Verde Falls, said Deputy Jim Ogden, Pima County Sheriff's Department spokesman. Friends, relatives and the Pima County Search and Rescue team have been searching for Bakker since Sunday night. "He probably dislo"dged and flushed out sometime during the night," Ogden said. "Two miles is quite a ways from the falls." No informaГtion regarding Bakker's injuries or cause of death was available, and as of yesterday afternoon, it had not been determined whether an autopsy would be performed, Ogden said. Max Webber, VA senior majoring in English, found Bakker, 2 2, lying halfway on a sandbar in the water. 
Ћ UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN Police arrest former prof after standoff 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. 
A former university English professor, who fled the counГ
try more than 14 years ago with her boyfriend after police 
tried to arrest him on a weapon charge in Ann Arbor, was 
arrested and taken into custody Frid~y after a three-hour 
standoff with police in Lexington, Ky. Bob and Gayl Jones 
shut themselves in her family's house and eluded police for 
three hours Friday before officers stormed the doorway to 
present Jones with the 14-year-old warrant. Bob Jones slit 
his own throat when officers entered the house. He later 
died at the University of Kentucky Hospital. Gayl Jones 
attempted suicide, but officers restrained and arrested her. 
In 1983, Bob Jones, also known as Bob Higgins, waved a 
shotgun at protesters during a gay rights rally in front of 
the federal building on Liberty Street. Higgins, then a local 
business executive, was arrested on charges of a weapons 
violation with intent to frighten. 
"There have been concerns raised around the university for decades about the unreliability of the current grading structure," said Judith Martin, the subcommittee's chair. 
By studying data from the registrar's office spanning several decades, memГhers will attempt to find a concrete picture of the university's grade situaГtion. They could have a report ready by the end of spring quarter. 
Since 1989, the average fall quarter grade point average for university undergraduates has risen to 2.96 from 2.83. 
"This isn't any monumental increase," said John Kellogg, a senior analyst in the Office of Planning and Analysis. But he added, "It's a definite trend." 
And with that trend comes an increase in the percentages of As and Bs earned in several of the university's undergraduate colleges.

"Right now I'm trying to 'sell'

they sponsor me. When I 'sell' a

Other aspects of the training 
program include personal 
coaching, information clinics 
focusing on proper marathon 
attire, fund-raising incentives, 
and advice from a mentor. 
"My mentor, Chris, is a man who has run the race before. He provides mental motivation. Since I can't make all the pracГtices with the group in Chicago, he sends me e-mail about what they are doing. He's also taught me a lot about leukemia," Henshaw said. 
Each runner in the marathon represents a "Patient Hero," a leukemia survivor or current patient. Henshaw's hero is fiveГyear-old Emily Stone. 
"It's neat that I'm running for Emily and that I know her. I don't know the pain she's feelГing, but I know that I'm running and as tired as I get, I know that it'll never be as bad as what she's already been through. She's only five," she said. 
Henshaw plans to run the marathon wearing a shirt on which she has written the names of several leukemia vicГtims. She commented that since she began the training proГgram, she has become more aware of how many lives are affected by leukemia, as well as the diversity of those working for the cure. 
"There are men and women walking. There are 60-year-olds running. The people are all 
ages, shapes, sizes, and speeds, 
but everyone's got the same 
goal," she said. 
"A year ago I didn't know 
anything about marathons, and 
I didn't know anything about 
running except for putting my 
shoes on and going out. Now I 
run with a purpose," Henshaw 
explained. 
Leukemia is a cancer of the 
blood that occurs as a result of 
the mutation of DNA. If this 
occurs in the bone marrow, the 
result is leukemia, and in the 
lymph nodes the result is lymГ
phoma. These malignant cells 
are more able to grow and surГ
vive in the bone marrow, and 
begin to grow uncontrollably, 
replacing normal cells and 
inhibiting marrow function. 
Leukemia can be either acute or chronic. The major differГence between the two leukemias is the rate at which they progress; acute leukemia proceeds at a much greater speed than chronic. Which of these types develops is deterГmined by the DNA mutation and the location of the malignant cells. 
As leukemia proceeds, bone marrow functions less efficientГly, resulting in an insufficient production of red cells, white cells, and platelets. This defiГciency causes anemia, which leads to fatigue, weakness, and a pale color. Falling levels of white cells leave the patient more susceptible to disease, and the low platelet count permits s_pontaneous or prolonged bleeding from small wounds. 
Diagnosis consists of a cell count under a microscope and confirmation by a bone marrow test. Current treatments of choice include chemotherapy and bone marrow transplants.

Beef group aware of Oprah show lineup 
AMARILLO, Texas 
A spokeswoman for a beef industry trade associГation testified yesterday that far from being ambushed, the group knew it would be up against an anti-meat cruГsader on "The Oprah Winfrey Show." Ali sa Harrison, a spokeswoman Winfrey for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, said she approved of allowing specialist Gary Weber to debate vegetarian activist Howard Lyman over whether mad cow disease threatened 
U.S. cattle. "We can take Howard Lyman," Harrison wrote in notes that were entered as evidence. "Confidence in beef is high and we can keep it there. Our members watch Oprah, and if we're not there, they'll want to know why." A group of Texas cattlemen is suing Winfrey, her production company and Lyman for $12 million, saying the April 16, 1996, episode falsely implied mad cow disГease threatened U.S. cattle and caused catГtle prices to plummet. Harrison took the stand as a witness for Winfrey. Weber has testified that the way his comments were edited in the show's final version was unfair. 


Twenty-nine die in India election violence 
NEW DELHI, India 
Leftist guerrillas set off a mine Monday that killed five soldiers sent to guard polling staГtions in India's parliamentary elections. The explosion and other attacks raised the elecГtion-related death toll to 29 over two days. The soldiers were traveling to polling stations in Andhra Pradesh state, where voting in India's staggered nationwide elections picks up again Saturday. Another 37 soldiers were injured. Police suspect the outlawed Peoples War Group, who had urged a boycott of the vote. Balloting Monday in Nagaland and Mizoram, two remote northeastern states, was the third in a six-day eJection. The first two days, Feb. 16 and Sunday, completed votГing for three-fourths of the 543 legislative disГtricts at stake. More than 600 million Indians are eligible to vote. Tribal guerrillas seeking autonomy called for a boycott in Nagaland, supported by opposition parties and student groups. But election officials said turnout was nearly 42 percent. Also Monday, a court reinГstated a right-wing Hindu nationalist governГment dismissed in Uttar Pradesh, India's largest state, over the weekend after two of its coalition partners withdrew support.

Florida's deadliest swarm of tornadoes on record plowed through the central part of the state at the height of tourist season on Monday, killing at least 38 people, including an 18-month-old toddler sucked from its father's arms. Eleven people were reported missing.

for students and student activiГties," club coordinator Tony Siefring said. 
"In the past there has been a big lack of money for clubs. Now they can put on more and bigger events," Siefring explained. 
The new funding will be disГtributed in the same way as in years past. Every club will preГsent a budget for review by the council, which will determine the amount each receives. 
The condition that 50 percent of the new funding be directed toward student clubs was a cruГcial point in the approval of the increase by Student Affairs and the officer's group. In a letter to student body president Matt Griffin, vice president for Student Affairs Patricia O'Hara called that feature the "most persuasive" part of the proposГal. 
Part of the reason for an increase of only $10, instead of the proposed $15, was the range of programs sponsored by the University's operating budget. Major expenditures such as Dome, Scholastic magaГzine, WFVI and WSND are funded by Student Affairs, which has a separate budget from that of student governГment. 
Intramural and club athletics are sponsored by RecSports. At many schools with higher stuГdent activities fees, student govГernments subsidize programs of that nature. 
The $65 student activity fee will come on top of a hall tax which averages $40 and goes to fund a number of student activГities run through the residence halls. 
friend was also mentioned in Foster's homily. He spoke ofhow people felt comfortable going to Brumbaugh with problems or with questions. 
"Justin had the ability to meet with people where they were at and to connect with them," Foster said. 
"He was genuine. He was grounded." 
Foster closed his homily by recognizing Joyce and Keith Brumbaugh, Justin's parents, who attended the Mass. 
"I want to thank you for sharГing Justin with us. You will always be part of our Notre Dame community," Foster said.

"In a short time he had left a deep and lasting imprint on people's life," Father James Foster said of 
Brumbaugh during the homily. 
Last week, Foster visited Brumbaugh's web page to find out "how he defined himself," and this served as the basis for his homily. He also talked to Brumbaugh's friends to get a better idea of how people will remember him. 
Upon viewing his web page, Foster found what Brumbaugh called his "words to live by." The phrase which conveyed Brumbaugh's love of sports was, "Always remember, today is a good day to play basketball."

Computer center expands, gets new name 
Special to The Observer 

The name of the Notre Dame Computer Store has been changed to the "IT Solutions Center" -"IT' signifying "inforГmation technology" -to reflect an expanГsion of both the product selection and serГvices the store offers to University stuГdents, faculty and staff. according to Larry Rapagnani, a.ssistant provost for Information Technologies. 
In coming months, the store, which preГviously sold and supported just Dell, Apple and IBM computers, will expand its system selection and add stafT. 
"The new name is part of our effort in Information Technologies to become more than just a computer department," Rapagnani said. "We plan to use our camГpuswide purchasing power to add a broadГer selection from more PC vendors, and we are adding personnel to improve our response time on campus. All of this, we believe, will enable us to offer better value to Notre Dame students, faculty, staff and departments." 
Concurrent with these changes is the appointment of Dan Brewer as manager of the IT Solutions Center. Brewer has worked for 12 years in the computer prodГucts and services field and has extensive experience with hardware and software vendors including IBM, Zenith, Apple, Novell, Corel, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft. 
"Dan has man11ged staffs of marketing, technical and administrative personnel in four states," Rapagnani said. "He has developed many vendor relationships, creГated contracts, established policies and set standards for products and services. He supports a team atmosphere and is comГmitted to high customer service, values and ethics." 
The IT Solutions Center is located on the ground level of the Computing Center and Math Building and is open weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The Jacques Maritain Center presents 
Fr. John Harvey, OSFS 
Fr. Harvey has spent 38 years specializing in the pastoral care of homosexual persons. He is founder and director of Courage. Courage offers a network of spiritual support groups for men and women with homosexual tendencies who desire to live chaste lives. Courage chapters now serve six Canadian and 29 U.S. dioceses, as well as others in the Phillipines, England, and Ireland. 
In addition to his1985 book,The Homosexual Person: New Thinking in Pastoral Care , Fr. Harvey has recently authored The Truth About Homosexuality: The Cry ofthe Faithful (1996), which Fr. Benedict Groeschel has described as "an excellent summary of the most solid thinking available at the present time on living chastely with homosexuality." In addition to these two titles, he has published over 45 articles on homosexuality, with one forthcoming on "The Pastoral Challenge of Homosexuality on a Catholic Campus." 

Fr. Groeschel writes: "A word of respectful gratitude must be said about Father John Harvey, who has effectively and modestly worked with homosexuals seeking a chaste lifestyle for almost half a century. He has had more than his share of opposition, rejection, and misunderstanding on all sides. Being a real disciple of Christ, he never quit. He has never even thought of quitting. He was and remains way ahead of his time." 
Fr. Harvey will address both the challenge and the hope of being a Christian with homosexual tendencies.

Highly-paid athletes brought us the baseball strike of1994 (which was basically и about millionaire players battling )Vith millionaire own-:Гers in a hotly contested and rivetingrace to see, not who would get to the World Series, but who would get the cash cow), and more recently. the Mike Tyson inciГdent (ear cartilage -the new power food?) and the Lattell Sprewell choking incident. Along. ofcourse, with other events. и 
Is there something about money which justmakes people rude? и и и и 
The amount of moneythat we as Americans give to athletes who can make phenomenal three-pointers and hithome runs is, well, insane~ We only give the и 
President of the United States ofAmerica $2()0~()00 a year,but any NBApla)'er probably makes aboptfiye и tiines that sum. At the very least; that is. . 1 и 
Actually, very few professions can generate the kind ofmoney that acting and professional athletics can get. Professors, who are probably the most educated of all the people in America, get paid squat for passing their knowledge on to us. Other professions. like engineer~ 
и ing, while they get paid well, can't even beginto comГ. pare. their salaries to the ones that professional athletes receive. 
And what makes this gap all the more noticeable is that this isn't justи a .professional phenomenon ... In my high school. the best facilities and the most attention and appreciation wereи given to the sports teams~ while the academic extraЋcurricular activities were given next to nothing. 
In college {read a place ofhigher learning), this differи ence gets even worse. }{ow many people are given full college scholarships based solely on.merit (i.e, academic merit)? Very few thatI have heard about. On the other hand. I know quite a few people who have'receivedfull sports scholarships for their talent in athletics. 
I realize that the basic reason for this is that while sports players generate money through ticket sales, good students don't make any money for their school. We'll pay quite a. bit of money to watch Michael Jordan make a three-pointer. butwould anyone want to pay the same amount (or any amount, for that matter) to watch the Democrats.and Republicans battling over policy in the House? 
Probably not. 

That is why I've come to a solution: Turn the House into one big basketball court. charge admission, and have the Dems and the GOP battle out policy issues while trying to make shots-any kind of shots -from the court. 
And, hey, ifwe're lucky, we might even get Gingrich and Gephardt to bite each other's ears off.

Gospel punty of heart. 
It is unadvisable for one to identiГ
fy oneself as "gay" or "lesbian," 
moreover, because it gives the 
impression that one's homosexual 
orientation is his or her most imporГ
tant characteristic. In this regard, 
the 1986 Letter from the 
Congregation for the Doctrine of the 
Faith ~ays th.at "the hu~an person, 
made m the unage and likeness of 
God, can hardly be adequately 
described by a reductionist referГ
~nce,to his or her sexual orientaГ
tlon. . . . 
Sexuality IS a g1ft of God e~pressed in the u?itive and procreи ative good ofmarnage. The docuГment "Always Our Children" very correctly points out that homogeniГtal behaviour is objectively immoral, because only in the two-in-one-flesh u.nion.of a man an.d .woman in marГrtage IS sexual actiVIty moral, and because homogenital behaviour is not open to the possible creation of human life. The document also corГreedy dis~inguishes. between homogemtal behaviour and homoГsex.ual orientation. In this regard, while the document correctly points ?ut th~t ~he h?mosexua~ orientation IS not. m Itself Immoral, It neglects to mentiOn that the homosexual orienи tation is objectively disordered (Congrgation for the Doctrine of the F?-ith, Letter to the Roman Catholic Bishops of the World, sect. 3). 
lnstead, it says that "sexuality is a gift from God" and then goes on to quote the Catechism of the Catholic Church, no. 2333: "Everyone... should ~ckn?w~~dge ~nd accept his sexual Identity. The Idea conveyed is that homosexuality is also a gift from God, and should be accepted ~one's fiXed and permanent idenГtity; howeve~. th~ actual quote from the Cathechism, Everyone, man and woman, should acknowledge and accept his sexual identity," is part of a paragraph describing the complementarity of man and woman in married life and in sociГety. It is incorrect to use this quote as ajust~ficatton that one should accept his or her homosexuality as a fixed state or as a pBrmanent and defining "identity." With regard to sexuality, it is generally more accuГrate to speak of "sexual attraction" rather than "sexual identity." The conviction tpat a sexual attraction is a stable or fundamental dimension of one's personality" has no support from Catholic teaching. 
The 1986 Letter to the Bishops of 
F th
a er John Harve
J 
the Catholic Church on the Pastoral 
Care of Homosexual Persons (PCHP) _ 
warned that, in some cases, "an 
overly benign interpretation was 
given to the homosexual condition 
itself, some going so far as to call it 
neutral or even good. ".HomosexualГ
ity, however, as the CDF has stated, 
is "objectively disordered" because 
it urges a person, not toward the 
inherent good of marriage and proГ
creation, but toward sinful conduct. 
The document "Always Our 
Children" in several places fails to 
make this clear, and may cause 
uninformed persons to conclude 
that homosexuality is a normal variГ
ant of sexual development, someГ
thing which is contrary to the 
explicit statements in the catechism 
and in the Vatican pastoral letters 
of 1976, 1986, and 1992. 
The document quotes the followи ing phrase: "homosexuals who are definitively such because of some kind of innate instinct," from the 1975 Declaration on Certain Questions Concerning Sexual Ethics. This phrase is an inaccurate transГlation of the Latin quasi innatus, which would be better translated: "as ifinnate." The frrst Italian ediГtion of the Catholic Catechism which used the word "innate" in describГing the homosexual orientation was revised. Cardinal Ratzinger explained the reason for the change: "One objection was that we made people think homosexual tenГdency was innate, that it was already present at the moment of birth or conception of the person. Many competent experts said that this has not been proven." 
In addressing how a parent should deal with an adolescent who is confused about his sexual identiГty, the document says, "If your son or daughter is an adolescent, it is possible that he or she may be experimenting with some homosexГual behaviours as part of the process of coming to terms with sexual identity. Isolated acts do not make someone homosexual. Adolescence is often accompanied by anxiety or confusion about sexuГal identity. Sometimes the best approach may be a 'wait and see' attitude, while you try to maintain a trusting relationship and provide various kinds of support, informaГtion and encouragement." 
This "wait and see" attitude, howГever, could be very dangerous. If someone is attracted to drugs or to alcohol, we do not accept that attraction as a given, or indicate that it is beyond their power to reject. The truth is that we are dealing with an objective disorder within the person. The parent should do everything possible to help the youth to move away from this particular attraction, and from the surroundings which encourage him to act out. If pastors are going to advise parents concerning homoГsexuality, they should remind parГents that their first obligation is to protect the child from immoral and 
dangerous behaviour. 
Given the epidemic of sexually 
transmitted diseases, including HIV 
disease, among male homosexuals, 
advising parents to adopt a "wait 
and see attitude" to same-sex 
experimentation among adolescents 
is an invitation to tragedy. If the 
male child has been involved in 
homosexual behaviour, he ought to 
be immediately tested, because in 
several large cities, a significant 
number of youth who were involved 
in homosexual activity became HIV и 
positive. New studies show that 9 
percent of homosexually active 
males aged 20 to 22 are already 
HIV positive. The earlier a boy 
becomes involved in same-sex 
behavior, the more likely he will 
become HIV positive or infected 
with other possibly fatal sexually 
transmitted diseases such as hepatiГ
tis and human papilloma virus. The 
document seems to imply, moreГ
over, that "experimenting with 
some homosexual behaviors as part 
of the process of coming to terms 
with sexual identity" is part of a 
normal developmental process. On 
the contrary, adolescents should be 
discouraged from experimenting 
with illicit sexual behavior-
whether it be homosexual or betГ
erosexual-for such behavior is 
both immoral and futile. When 
seeking professional help, the parГ
ents should choose a knowledgeable 
counselor who respects the moral 
teaching of the Church. 
The document's defmition of 
chastity is inadequate, moreover, in 
stating that "chastity means inteГ
grating one's thoughts, feelings, and 
actions in the area of human sexuГ
ality, in a way that values and 
respects one's own dignity and that 
of others." One can easily imagine и 
an argument that one can "inteГ
gy:ate" the "thoughts, feelings, and 
actions" that stem from one's "innate" homosexual orientation "in a way that values and respects one's own dignity." Indeed the docи ument seems to leave the field open for such an argument. This is clearly inferior to the defmition of chastity offered by the Catechism at 2337: "Chastity means the successГful integration of sexuality within the person and thus the inner unity of man in his bodily and spiritual being. Sexuality, in which man'sГbelonging to the bodily and biologiГcal world is expressed, becomes personal and truly human when it is integrated into the relationship of one person to another, in the comГplete and lifelong mutual gift of a man and a woman." Why avoid such clarity in favour of such ambiГguity? 
When the document speaks of "the power and freedom of sexualiГty" as "gifts of God," it would be helpful to show the relationship between freedom and truth, as our present Holy Father does in Veritatis Splendor, and contrast it 

Ћ 
with the "slavery to sin" which is experienced by those who are trapped in the cycle of compulsive behaviour so prevalent among those who are involved in illicit sexual activity. This would be an opportuГnity to show how the power of grace can overcome any human weakГness. As St. Paul tells us: "The triГals that you have to bear are no more than people normally have ... You can trust God not to let you be tried beyond your strength, and with any trial he will give you a way out of it, and the strength to bear it" (I Corinthians, 10: 1 3; 1 Corinthians 6:9-1 1). 
While recognizing the hard work of the authors of"Always Our ChHdren" and the sense of compasГsion they conveyed, I believe that in the areas mentioned the document stands in need of substantive reviГsion.

Do you thinl{ there should be a Blacl{ History Month? 

"Yes, I think so. It's a good idea to learn about other people's cultures as well as your own. Although I'd like to see other months focusing on other ethnicities as well."

Justin Crawford Law Student, Fischer Graduate Residence 
"I don't think it's the ideal answer to the

N
otice anything about February except that the weather is unseasonably warm? It's Black History Month, but bet you could not tell. That is probably because just like most of black history, it is ignored by the majority of Americans. It's funny that everyone on this campus seems to know when it's Groundhog Day or Columbus Day among other insignificant holidays but Black History Month just passes this campus by like the wind off Lake Michigan. Could it be that this occurs because black people have no history or culture, or could it be because Blacks have historically been denied their rightful place in American histoГry? 
One might ask why do we need a whole month for black history? They might argue, "If we have a Black History Month, what about a White History Month?" Let us contemplate this. The majority of holidays celebrated by white America in all actuality do not apply to black Americans. For instance, let's look at the holiday of Independence Day. For many Americans this is perhaps the greatest national holiГday that this country celebrates. This is the day when the liberty-loving colonists won freedom from the tyrannical rule of the British. 

Black Americans fought valiantly beside their white counterparts; in fact the first casualty of the Revolution was Crispus Attucks, a black man. Blacks fought with the hope that by fighting for their country they would be freed from the bonds of slavГery. However, after the war was won by the colonists, these very whites who had risked their lives in the name of freedom, justice and liberty continued to enslave the same people who had helped them achieve this independence. Yet, Ameriea expects blacks to ignore this minor detail and celebrate the Fourth of July as if they had gained freedom on this day. The Fourth of July

ous, but should be looked upon with disgust because it serves as a reminder of yet another time when their ancestors laid their Jives on the line for a freedom that they would not share. 
Okay, Independence Day, that is one holiday that is not much cause for celebration for blacks. Let's try Presidents Day. Presidents Day is a celebration of America's forefather5 George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Arc they the forefathers of black people one may ask? Well, maybe Washington because he was probably sleepГing with his slaves. But seriously, how can black Americans celebrate the very peoГple who practiced and condoned slavery? It should be common knowledge that Washington owned slaves. "But what about good old Abc, he freed the slaves with 

h e 
Emancipation Proclamation," you might say. Yes he did eventually free the enslaved, but not in the Emancipation Proclamation, and when he did free the slaves it was for his own selfish purposГes. He was a firm believer in the inferiorГity of blacks. T h e Proclamation only freed those slaves in states that had seceded from

ffOR~ MOH1H? 
in essence, he was freeing slaves under a foreign government. How could he free slaves that were not under his jurisdiction? Answer: He could not. He did not care if blacks were slaves, he just wanted to preserve the Union. It should be somewhat difficult for blacks to be jubilant about someone who kept their ancestors enslaved. By asking blacks to ignore these facts, America is asking them to disregard their heritage. Therefore, Presidents Day is yet another holiday that should be more painful for blacks than one that evokes pride and nationalism. 
For those of you who still believe that Black History Month-is not relevant even though many of these holidays could evoke feelings of pain and injustice for a large segment of the population, then why not explore other options for national holidays? By doing this maybe one's opinion will change when the shoe is on the other foot. 
Blacks are asked to ignore the racist sentiment underlying these holidays because they were good for the country. Are blacks not part of this country? Well, of course they are. Then why not celebrate days that were beneficial for them and their ancestors? For instance, how about Nat Turner Day? Turner was a slave who believed that God called him to lead his people from the bonds of slavery. He led an uprising and killed 55 whites before his battle for freedom was ended. 
Now maybe some blacks would view Turner as a hero because, just like the colonists in the American Revolution, he fought bravely for the liberty of his people. Under this context, these whites were just casualties that come with any fight for freedom. Or, maybe whites would view this event as a massacre, as it is labeled in history books, because it was their people who were killed. Everyone, at least one would hope, knows that slavery was wrong so this struggle against a practice so contradictory to the values of this country should be viewed with pride. But. it is doubtful doubt that there will be a holiday celebrating Nat Turner because it is unlikely that white Americans can look past the fact that whites were killed by black man, even if it was justified. Yet, America asks blacks to do this exact thing. 
Maybe Nat Turner Day is not palatable to some, but how about someone a little more modern, like Malcolm X. He was another great иAmerican her?, was he not? He inspired pride and unity in the black community. Malcolm Xи advocated selfГreliance in eduГcation, employГment and poliГtics. Yet, while he-. exulted the positive aspects of the black culГture, he also called white people "devils" and believed black people should separate themselves from the evil ways ways of these "devils." Why not have a holiГday for him, his opinions on whites should not overshadow all the positive things he did, 
just as people are expected not to let Washington's owning slav8s overshadow his great accomГplishments. . ~._-------------------:---------l 

There w iII be Illustration courtesy of "Four Centuries of Black Life: African American History" 
no need for Black History Month if America starts celebrating other great American people and events that are not just for whites such as Martin Delaney. Marcus Gatvey, and the passing of the 13th Amendment which abolished slavery (Black 
lhdependence Day). . 
Black History Month is not just a month isolated from the rest of America who is not black. Black history is American history. Blacks have been in this country as lollg or longer than any whites, they have fought in every war that this country has bf'l\!n engaged in -even while being denied the very freedom for which they fought. Black people are at the core of the very foundation of this country and have conГtributed many inventions, discoveries and literatures that have become what is knOWn as the American culture. 
Continually the achievements of blacks have gone unnoticed. For centuries their creativities and inventions were stifled and stolen by the whites who oppressed them. Without black history the true and accurate history of America cannot be told. Until this history is told then we must keep Black History Month to bring these pa~t and present struggles to light to acknowledge the many contributions of black!, irt this country.

Fourth place finish disappoints 
ByMATTYUNG 
Sporrs Writer 

After a long and fruitful journey. the Irish swimming team finally completed its 1997-98 season with the culГminating Big East Championships in Pittsburgh. Entering the Big East Championships, the Irish had an outstanding 11-1 record in the regular season. their only loss coming at the hands of Texas Christian in early November. This was the team's best season since going 12-1 in 1989-90 and the seaГson's success carried over into the championship .meet. In each of their past two appearГ
_i ances, Notre Dame finished seventh out of 13 teams, which was a higher finish that other teams expected. At this year's meet, however, the Irish caught everyone's attenГtion with their impressive fourth place finish. "The meet was a dream for us," head coach Tim Welsh said. "We were seventh the last two years and hoped to move up in the standings, but to move to fourth was a giant step for us. It took everyone to reach fourth." On Wednesday, the first day of competition, sophomore diver Herb Huesman placed fourth in the three-meter divГing, scoring 480.75, finishing behind three Miami divers. Notre Dame's 200-medley relay (Chris Fugate, Steele Whowell, Rob Fetter, and Russell Preston) also earned a fourth-place finish with a time of 1:33.29, breaking the seven-year-old school recoFd of 1:33.49 and giving the Irish their highest relay finish in three Big East appearances. "It's been a really, really good season," said sophomore Rob Fetter. "We got a lot of wins, which is always a lot of fun. We'll train this spring and summer and get back into the swing of things and do pretty well next year." The 200 freestyle relay team (Mike Doyle, Ron Royer, Vince Kuna, and Ray Fitzpatrick) finished seventh in 1:23.54. Miami dominated day one with 121 points, but the Irish remained close in fourth place with 69 points. only two points behind second-place St. 
John's. 
On the second day of compeГtition, the 400-meter medley relay (Fugate, Whowell, Scott Zumbach, and Fetter) sped through the water in a 3:22;87 effort, breaking the five-year-old record of 
3:23.93. Fugate was instruГmental in the race, leading off with a school-record 100 backstroke time of 51.81. 
_ Later, Fugate would use his talents to place third in the 200 individual medley with a time of 1:51.18. Fetter folГlowed in eighth place at 
1:54.00. In a familiar perforГmance, Huesman finished fourth in the one-meter diving with 471.10 points, trailing only the Miami divers. Huesman, who will continue to train for the NCAA zone diving meet over spring break, was pleased wi.th the meet, "Hopefully it will be a good building block for the NCAAs." 
Senior Ron Royer finished 1Oth in the 50 freestyle in 
21.09 and another school record was broken when John Lubker powered to the wall in the 500 freestyle in a mere 4:31.41. 
''I finally got under 21 secГonds," said Royer, who swam a personal best of 20.98 in the preliminaries. 
"This was a great night for us," said head coach Welsh. "Three school records fell and we are swimming extremely well." 
The day's strong perforГmance moved the Irish past St. John's, but Pittsburgh overtook Notre Dame, keeping the Irish in fourth place. 
Friday's competition was intense, with the meet half over and each event becoming more vital to the team's finish. The 400 individual medley was one race in which the Irish collected a healthy servГing of points. Zumbach placed third and broke his own school record with a time of 
3:58.44. At his heels were teammates Ryan Verlin in fifth in 4:00.54, and Lubker in ninth in 4:03.20. The 100 breaststroke was another strong event for the Irish. Whowell finished lOth in 
57.41 and was followed by Dan Szilier in 13th with a time of 57.93 and Antonio Fonseca in 15th in a time of 58.25. 
Fugate finished ninth in the 100 backstroke and set a school record with a blazing 
51.55. The 800 freestyle relay (Royer, Wes Richardson. Brian Najarian, and Fitzpatrick) finished fifth in 
6:49.76. Fetter placed 14th in the 100 butterfly in 5L 30, Fitzpatrick placed fifth in the 200 freestyle with a time of 1:40.52, and Fugate and Preston finished eighth and 15th in the 100 backstroke with respective times of 51.55 and 53.32. Notre Dame again finished the day in fourth place. 
The final day of competition displayed a stellar perforГmance by the Irish distancers. Lubker finished second in the 1650 freestyle and set a new school record. Lubker was closely followed by fresliman phenom James Scott-Browne in third place, Sean Casey in 13th, and Richardson in 14th. 
Fugate took 13th in the 200 backstroke and Fitzpatrick and Fetter placed 11th and 13th, respectively, in the 100 freestyle. The tandem of Szilier and Whowell placed sixth and 11th in the 200 breaststroke, and Zumbach and Verlin placed fifth and 1Oth in the 200 butterfly. The 400 freestyle relay (Royer. Preston, Fetter, and Fitzpatrick) placed 1Oth with a time of 3:08.91. 
With the best season finish 
for any current Irish swimГ
mer, the Irish now have the 
opportunity to build upon 
their suc_cess with off-season 
training. Seniors Brian 
Najarian, Ron Royer, Steve 
Cardwell, and Slade Stolz now 
pass the torch to the rest of 
the team with undaunted conГ
fidence in them and coach 
Tim Welsh. 
Royer. who attended high school with teammate Najarian commented, "Now. that's it's over, I'm just glad we could end with a successГful season. In high school, we [Royer and Najarian] came into a not-so-good program, but left it with a champiГonship. The same type of thing happened at Notre Dame. When we came here, the program wasn't as strong as it is now, and it was a relief to come out the way we did my senior year."

ond and seven behind first-place Northwestern. The 607 is the best 36-hole performance the team has had in its ten-year existence. 
"I am very happy with the perГformance of the team," said women's golf coach Ross Smith, "On the second day everyone played consistent and the girls all knew they had a shot at winГning the tournament. It was just outstanding performance by this team." 
Sophomore golfer Andrea Klee commented on the second round, "We were all so happy. We all knew that we had these types of rounds inside of us. We just needed to put them all together at the same time." 
The first day of action saw the Irish come out rusty and slugГgish and resulted in them shootГing a 312 (+24). A few of the bright stars for the team on Friday were senior captain Katie King (75), sophomore Andrea Klee (78), and freshman Mary Klein (78). King's score put her in second place after day one of the event with Klee and Klein just out of 10th place. 
The second day saw a turn of events for the ladies. The rust that was present the first day had rubbed off and the Irish put together their best round ever with a seven-over-par 150. All but one Notre Dame golfer shot lower than 80, with four achievГing a 75 or lower. King continГued her outstanding play for the Irish shooting a 7 4 for combined score of 149 and a third-place finish. The five-over-par 149 is the best 36 holes King has shot in her career at Notre Dame, and the third place finish is secГond only to her second-place finГish at the Illinois State Classic last year. 
"I had the typical freshman adjustments to make when I came here, but once I got used to them and relaxed I was able to focus," commented Klee on her turnaround. "Plus, I worked on my swing and my game over the summer and it allowed me to straighten out some of the probГlems I had." 
"I was very proud to see Andrea shoot the way she did," stated Smith. She struggled last year and it was good to see her make the adjustments and improve her game. I am conГvinced that she will continue to get better."

Take two: Women repeat at Big East Championships 
By BRIAN KESSLER 
Sports Writer 

The 24th-ranked Notre Dame women's swimming and diving team lapped the competition in the pool this weekend on its way to repeating as Big East Champions. The Irish won in dominating fashion, capturing first place in 10 events and outscoring their closest oppoГnent, Villanova, by nearly 200 points. 
"It was really exciting to win by that much," commented Carrie Nixon. "It puts us as the leaders of the Big East, but makes our claim that much stronger." 
Senior captain Linda Gallo lead the way once again for the 
\._ Irish, winning three individual events. On Thursday, Gallo broke her own school record and posted a new meet record in the 500 freestyle with a time of 4:48, automatically qualifying her for the NCAA Championships. "Linda's just amazing and she's such a leader," said Nixon, who followed Gallo with a secГond-place finish in the 50 free. "Her win in the 500 inspired all of us to swim better." Nixon's second-place finish along with Irish victories in the 200 and 400 medley relays posiГtioned the swimmers in first place after two days of competiГtion. On Friday, sophomore Liz Barger picked up where the Irish left off a day earlier. Barger set a school record in the 100 butterfly (55.70) and earned NCAA consideration. Allison Newell finished just under a secГond later and captured third in the event. Nixon placed sixth. Gallo won her second event in as many days by setting a school, meet, and pool record, in the 200 frcestlye. Gallo earned 
NCAA consideration with her time of 1:49.44 and her teamГmates followed closely behind as Kristen Van Saun, Katie Collins and Brenda Reilly helped the Irish capture four of the top eight spots in the 200. 
Sophomore All-American Shannon Suddarth was next up on the blocks for the women and had a tough act to follow. Suddarth proved she was up to the challenge by qualifying for NCMs and setting school, meet, and pool records in the 100 breaststroke (1 :02 .07). Brittany Kline finished fourth in the event. 
Tiffany O'Brien placed second in the 400 individual medley and Anne Iacobucci took fifth. The Irish closed the day with a win in the 800 freestyle relay and entered the final day of swimГming with a 170-point lead. 
Saturday brought more indiГvidual success for the swimГmers, even though the team championship was already clinched. Gallo broke her own school record in the 1,650 freestyle and claimed her third individual event of the champiГonships. Suddarth was brilliant in the 200 breaststroke and qualified for NCAAs with her time of 2:13.99. Barger capГtured her second event with a victory in the 200 butterfly 
(2:01.45) and O'Brien placed second in the 200 backstroke. 
Gallo's performance earned her women's swimmer of the meet honors and Bailey Weathers was named coach of the year for the second consecuГtive season. 
"Bailey does a great job," Nixon said. "This award is wellГdeserved. He pushes us really hard in practice and it pays off." 
The Big East champions will have their last chance to qualify for NCAAs at this weekend's Shamrock Classic.

Freshman Cardona dazzles crowd, opponent 
By MIKE DAY 
Sporrs Editor 
With his shoes laced up and his gloves strapped on, he entered the ring for the first time in his life on Monday evening. 
Although he had no boxing experience prior to last night's opening round at the Joyce Center, freshman Adrian Cardona was rewarded with the No. 2 seed in the 55Гpound division for his remarkable talГent and hard work over the last six weeks. 
With all eyes glued in his direction, Cardona squared ofT with senior Brendan Reilly in what was perhaps the night's most anxiously awaited debut. Considering all the pressure that comes with being the secГond seed as a freshГ
man, Cardona did not disappoint. 
In fact, he thrived. The newГcomer to Bengal Bouts pounded on Reilly for nearly a round and a half before the fight was stopped, and he was rewarded with a TKO victory. 
"My only fighting experience was in street fights," said Cardona. "It felt good to get out there and gain some experiГence. I've got a long way to go, but this was a great way to start." 
Cardona's thundering right hook and lightning quick jab may have given boxing fans a sign of things to come in the future. In fact, four years from now, people just might look back to Feb. 23, 1998 as a day a star was born.

who tried to combat Smith's controlled approach. "I tried to keep composed," said Smith. "(Paulsen) was a shorter fightГer, so I just let him come to me." 
Smith's unanimous decision victory in the 180-pound class sets up a Wednesday meeting with top-seeded Mike Rornanchek, who also happens to be his best friend in the club. 
"It's going to be tough on Wednesday," said Smith. "Mike's a real strong fighter, and he's one of my best friends here. We practice together all the time. 
"I'll be concentrating on fighting the same kind of fight. [My height) will be something that can work to my advanГtage. Right now my jab is my best punch, and that's what I'm going to be working on." 
Hometown favorite Joey Leniski (Mishawaka, Ind.) rode the vocal support of the crowd to a split decision win over senior Josh Akers in another 180-pound bout. Leniski conГtrolled the center of the ring, cornering Akers on the ropes for much of the fight, although Akers landed a few hard shots of his own to keep it close. 
In the semifinals, Leniski faces Daniel Prince, whose accurate jabs and stamina carГried the junior past Matt Hodgcrs. Two standing-eight counts spelled trouble for Hodgers early, but the senior fought back in the third round

In the 150-pound division, top seeds Fred Kelly and Stefan Molina had little trouble with their opening round opponents. Despite a strong effort from freshman Dennis Abdelnour, Kelly advanced to the semifinals with a victory by unanimous decision. 
"After last year, I'm not taking anything for granted," said Kelly, referring to his surprise loss to Ted Pagano in the finals a year ago. "I was starting to

In the first of two 185-pound bouts, Fred Wulfs quest for a title ended just 16 seconds after it began. Senior Matt Lubbers landed a crushing blow to Wulf's head that caused an uncontrollable noseГbleed, halting the fight. 
"I was surprised and disapГpointed," said Lubbers of his short-lived Bengal Bouts debut. "I wanted to at least go three rounds in [the ring]. It was a shame it had to end this way, I think it would have been a good fight." 
Lubbers now faces top-seedГed Dave Butz, who earned a first-round bye. 
''I'd say this is somewhat of a disadvantage because I really wanted to get in there and get comfortable with the atmosГphere, and maybe try some new things before Wednesday," said Lubbers. 
Tim Neagle also advanced to the semifinals in the 185Гpound class with a unanimous decision win over Stephen Pfeiffer. Neagle's uppercuts made the difference in the slugfest, as the two fighters tried to overpower each other with brute strength. 
Heavyweights Felipe Reynoso and Andy Riederer squared ofT in the final quarterfinal bout, with Riederer coming away with a split-decision victory after pummeling Reynoso and forcing two standing eights to the delight of the thinning crowd. 
Hiederer now faces returning champion Dave Monahan in the semifinal round Wednesday.

In the first fight, senior Andrew Yang pulled out a splitГdecision victory in a battle that could have gone either way. Meanwhile, No. 2-seed David Murphy lived up to his ranking on Monday, defeating seventhГseed Rick Johnson by unaniГmous decision. 
"It's hard to explain, but for some reason, it's difficult going up against a lefty," said Murphy about Johnson. "You never really know what to expect.

Ћ WOMEN'S TENNIS 
Irish netters have mixed results at Nationals 
By TIM CASEY 
Sports Writer 

The women's tennis team had a chance last weekend to see where they match up with the best teams in the country. The result -they proved that they deserve to be mentioned with the best. 
Sixteen of the top 25 teams in the country were in Madison, Wis., to compete in the National Team Indoor Tournament. The Irish finished the weekend with a 1-2 record, which included two close losses. 
On Friday, the 15th-ranked Irish lost a tight 5-4 match in the first round against Vanderbilt University. The Commodores were the 16thГranked team in the country prior to the match against the Irish. The top three singles players all scored victories for Notre Dame. Junior Jennifer Hall scored a 6-3, 6-1 victory over Kristy Blumberg at first singles. Hall is ranked 19th in the latest Intercollegiate Tennis Association singles rankings. At second singles, freshman Michelle Dasso won 6-4, 6-1 over Julie Ditty. Dasso is curГrently 27th, while Ditty is 46th in the country. Third singles player Marisa Velasco rallied from a first-set loss, to beat Callie Creighton, 4-6, 6-1, 6-0. Dasso and Velasco also teamed up at second doubles for an impressive 8-0 shutout of Staci Ryan and Kristen Radford. 
Notre Dame dominated 17thГranked South Alabama in the consolation round on Saturday. All five singles players won in straight sets. Tiffany Gates and

Kelly Zalinski avenged close three set losses against Vanderbilt with impressive vicГtories at fourth and fifth singles, respectively. Gates, a senior, beat South Alabama's Gaelle Gouttefarde 6-3, 6-4 while sophomore Zalinski blanked Melanie Pieterse, 6-0, 6-0. The doubles matches were not played because the Irish were already ahead by an insurГmountable 5-0 margin. 
With the win over South Alabama, the Irish advanced to take on 9th-ranked Mississippi. Mississippi boasts a strong lineГup which includes two of the top 15 players in the country along with other solid players. Earlier in the tournament, Mississippi beat second-ranked UCLA 5-4. The two teams split the singles before Mississippi won the two doubles matches to record a 5-3 victory. 

The Notre Dame women's tennis squad rebounded from a loss to Vanderbilt with a 5-0 victory over No. 17 South Alabama.

ence on your day. 
Taurus:You may be faced 
with disillusion or disappointГ
ment today. Even though you 
have been working hard, it is 
still insufficient. It is too easy 
to become impatient with othГ
ers who do not understand 
your problem. 
Gemini:Motivational speakГ
ers and surrealists alike can 
expect a wonderful day. Plans 
and visions fill your head, 
some of them strange, all of 
them possible. You are 
allowed to take back what you 
said yesterday. 
Cancer:You can only hide for so long before you have to come out and face the music. Something you have been dreading may not be so bad after all. Ignore your feelings and lead with your thoughts. 
Leo:Your chances for sucГcess are excellent, but so is the possibility of sabotaging your own efforts. Competition may lead to your downfall. Be satisfied with what you get today. 
Virgo: If you are stuck today, this may be a good time to help others. A change in the weather finds you improperly dressed. Take extra vitamins to keep up your resistance.

Bouts start 1Nith a bang 
Farrell, Molloy advance easily over competition 
By KATHLEEN LOPEZ Assistanr Sports Editor 
Last night, loads of young, talented fighters were looking for their time to steal the show. They did not. 
In the opening round of the 68th Bengal Bouts, the majority of the top seeds advanced with ease. ln the 160-pound weight class, senior and defending champion Chip Farrell advanced to the semifinals by unanimous decision over Robert Vuolo. 
"I was hoping to get in a good fight," Farrell said. "I wasn't going out there to beat anyone up. Mostly, I just wanted to work on my fundamentals." 
While Vuolo had the height advantage, Farrell managed to land the majority of his combinations, along with a strong right cross which knocked Vuolo to his knee. 
"My jab was working well," Farrell said. "Throwing hard rights was working too." 
Farrell will take on fifth-seeded sophomore Timothy DeFors. DeFors relied on his strong right and his sheer power lifted him to a win over sophomore John Berry by split decision. 
In the lower half of the 160-pound weight class, the No. 2 and No. 3-seeds easily advanced. Sophomore Tom Biolchini and junior John DeSplinter will meet in the semis in what promises to be one of the top fights on Wednesday night. 
DeSplinter faced some spirited competition in junior Dennis Jovellanos. His wild techГnique almost pushed DeSplinter out of the ring. 
"He slowed down my jab because I didn't

Irish end regular season at home 
By BILL HART Sporrs Writer 
The Fighting Irish women's basketball team hopes to end the regular season on a posiГtive note at 7 p.m. tonight, when it faces off against conГference rival Rutgers in the final home game of the season. 
Even though a game between two of the top teams in the Big East is notable on any particuГlar day, the fact that two memГbers of the Notre Dame squad will take the floor of the Joyce Center for the final time makes the contest vn more memorble than it would be otherwise. 
The Scarlet Knights are on a 10-game win streak after a 70Г56 victory over Pittsburgh on Wednesday and a dramatic 57Г54 win over Boston College on Saturday. Against the Eagles, sophomore guard Shawnetta Stewart hit a 50-foot jumper as the clock expired for the home win. The victory secured the Big East 7 regular season diviГsional title for the Knights, as well as the No. 2 seed in the

Big East Championship. Against Pittsburgh, Rutgers hit six of seven three-pointers in the first half to build a 33-24 lead at the intermission. Stewart had an all-around perГformance with game highs of 20 points and eight rebounds to go with two assists and three steals. Junior guard Tomora Young scored 16 points, including four shots from long range. 
"They're a very feisty _team," senior guard Mollie Peirick said about the Scarlet Knights. "and an athletic squad. They're just a really tough team, especially when it comes to rebounding." 
Rutgers can boast of one achievement that no one in the Big East has been able to duplicate this season. Earlier this year, the Scarlet Knights handed Connecticut its first conference loss in over two years, defeating the Huskies at home 74-70. In that game, freshman guard Linda Miles tallied 18 points and 11 boards while Young scored 17. 

The Observer/Brandon Candura Fred Kelly had no problem advancing to the semifinals, defeating Dennis Abdelnour in the 150-lb. quarterfinals last night. 
Ho~ever, the Knights will possibly face an even more difГficult task when they face off on Notre Dame's court. While at home this season, the Irish have all but dominated the Joyce Center floor, winning their past 10иgames and sportГing an 11-1 home record. 
The Irish hope the friendly confines of home will help them rebound from a 73-61 loss to Connecticut on Saturday. In one of her strongest efforts of the season, sophomore Niele Ivey led three players in double figures with 20 points, while Peirick and junior Sheila McMillen had 10 and 12 points, respectively. However, the loss was the team's third straight on the road. 
"We just have a lot of youth on our team," head coach Muffet McGraw remarked on the performance. "We had the lead late in the half, but they got four free throws and later took the lead. I think the foul-

175-lb. division has its share of surprise results 
By ALLISON KRILLA Sports Writer 

Maybe it was the argyle socks or the noticeable absence of his constantly bobbing ponytail, but whatever it was, Brian Gaffney took only one minute and 27 seconds to dis-l pose of freshman Eric Saul in the first bout of ~~~ the 175-pound class last night. ! 
"This (fight) was good for me," said Gaffney. "The big thing was that I got the nerves out, and remembered 'I can do this. I've done this before.'" 
The usually free-swinging Gaffney came out under control, utilizing a straight jab and his height advantage to dominate Saul in the ring. 

"This was one of my better fights," said Gaffney. "I found t-hat the straighter my punches, the more effective they were." 1! 
The win sets up a semifinal-round match-! up with sophomore Keith Parendo, who used a barrage of punches to wear down Chad Maestas. Parendo kept Maestas on the ropes I, for the first two rounds, and staved off a 11 valiant comeback effort by the freshman in 11 the final round to win. ! 
Fellow freshman Brian Hobbins, seeded ! sixth, earned a split-decision victory overи ,. third-seeded Jack Barber to earn a spot in 
. the semis against senior Chris Dobranski. I Dobranski landed a majority of jabs to Josh Nelson's jaw, drawing two standing-eight counts in the final rounds of the split-deciГsion win. 
Sophomore Kyle Smith used a decided height advantage to defeat Brendan Paulsen,
