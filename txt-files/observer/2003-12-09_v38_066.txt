Alum donates $6 M to Health Services 
By KATIE LAIRD News Wrirer 
University Health Services received a $6 million donation from Notre Dame alumni William Warren to completely renovate the University's existing health care facility and incorporate Ilealth Services, the Counseling Center and the Office of Drug and Alcohol Education into one facili­ty. 
Ann Klcva, director of Health Services, said she is very eager to begin the reconstruction. 
"We hope to become an accred­ited health care facility. Our care meets the standards, but our building does not," she said. 
The current building docs not meet fire codes, does not have handicap accessibility and lacks central air conditioning. In addi­tion, the water is less than perfect due to pipe lining. The new reno­vation calls for the complete restoration of the building, including new ventilation and electrical, plumbing and fire-pro­tection systems. 
The anticipated cost of the total project is around $9 million, Kleva said. The University hopes to raise the remaining $3 million from funds for building mainte­nance and students' health care services fees. 
"Construction will be limited because we're going to work with the existing building ... it's a beautiful old building, one of the best-built buildings on campus," Klevasaid. 
Health Services will remain centrally located on campus as the University plans to expand Notre Dame's borders in future years. 
The University hopes to begin construction of the facility in May 2005, and anticipates its comple­tion in August 2006. During this period, students will still be able to receive medical and counseling care. 
"There is available space in the security building, so we can pro­vide health care and provide 24-7 care that we have now. We won't have interrupted care," Kleva said. 
Warren, who donated the fund­ing for the facility, is the president of the Warren Foundation in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and is a mem­ber of the Notre Dame Board of Trustees. 
He also funded the construction of the Warren Golf Course on campus a few years ago. lie was recently inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame, where he was recognized for his contri­butions in health care and in higher education through schol­arship funds, endowments and other programs. 
"Historically, a lot of the [Warren] foundation has gone to health care. Mr. Warren is into

Amnesty to erect walls outside of dining halls 
By DUSTIN VONHANDORF 
News Wrirer 
The Notre Dame branch of the Amnesty International social action group will con­struct a wooden wall in front of each dining hall today in response to rising tensions in the Middle East, prompted by a wall erected between Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East. 
AmnestyND did not initial­ly plan to call attention to the tensions, said its presi­dent, Teriss Conterato, but decided to go ahead with the event due to the rising media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
In addition to the increas­ing media coverage, Conterato said AmnestyND is security barrier, but it vio­concerned with the issue late~ so many international "because of the actions of treaties and is cutting off both Israel and Palestine. human rights.

Confessions of an AIM addict 

I'm coming clean. My parents will be ashamed, I know. It is time, however, for me to let go of those conversations that move slower than traffic on a football game weekend, to be free from those Megan O'Neil little yellow smi­ley faces. 
Hi, my name is Wzre Editor Megan and I'm an AIM-oholic. 
Even as I sit here now expressing my desire for rehabilitation, I am chatting away with four different friends, darting from Microsoft Word to AIM. At this point I have typed about five times as much in those little gray boxes as I have on this page. 
The sitmition is even worse when I am actually working on something important, like a phi­losophy paper. I would estimate AIM adds 90 minutes to every five­page paper I write. Further, it jeopardizes the coherency of whatever I finally do turn in to my professor. 
The away message was designed to combat this problem, to empow­er those with a love for the latest, such as myself, with a tool to con­trol themselves. It can be agreed however, that while an excellent concept, it has failed miserably. 
First of all, the composing of away messages has become an art in and of itself. Some detail their entire daily schedule, while others reference inside jokes. It is not uncommon to see inspirational quotes from great minds such as Martin Luther King, Jr., or mes­sages written in foreign lan­guages. Indeed, some students do keep a list of convenient pre­scripted ones such as "class" or "dinner." But admit it, you hate those boring one-worders whether you are addicted or not. 
Second, even with my away mes­sage solidly posted, I cannot resist the urge to check my buddy list every ten minutes or so. On stress­ful days when my condition flares I will read every away message on my list of 107 screen names. Some of them require decoding, of course, and you could say I am inadvertently receiving a degree in away message analysis. 
If AIM is so distracting, you might ask, why do you just not sign on at all? This would seem like the simple solution, but yet another misconception. My need to talk online and to check others' away messages is such that absti­nence is even more distracting than the alternative. I will think about who is on, and what mes­sages are up, to the extent that I might as well be signed on any­way. 
So the struggle continues, day in and day out. At this point, howev­er, I would say it is a losing battle.

IU center breaks world dreidel record 

BLOOMINGTON, Ind.-A Jewish community center at Indiana University says it has broken the world record for spinning drei­dels. 
Officials at the Helene G. Simon Hillel Center in Bloomington set 713 of the traditional Hanukkah toys spinning for 10 seconds on Sunday. They were await­ing official confirmation of the feat by the Guinness Book of World Records. 
The previous record, held by the University of Maryland, involved spin­ning 536 dreidels for 10 seconds in 2000. 
As the crowd gathered before the event, volunteer "spinners" signed in and

So volunteers handed out a second dreidel to most of the crowd, and participants practiced a two-handed technique or tried spinning the dreidels one after the other. 
Hillel Center Rabbi Sue Shifron said Guinness will have to confirm the record by reviewing participant sign-in sheets and any visu­al evidence. The process will take abnut four weeks. 
Secret Service not to investigate Eminem 
WASHINGTON -The 
U.S. Secret Service has looked into reports that 
rapper Eminem wrote lyrics that said ''I'd rather see the president dead," but it doesn't plan a formal investigation, said a Secret Service spokesman. 
John Gill, the spokesman, cautioned such lyrics can have unintended conse­quences on others. 
"The Secret Service has no current plans to open an investigation into this mat­ter," Gill said Monday. But "we are concerned about communications that can be interpreted in a manner perhaps not intended by the artist, and the potential peripheral impact that such lyrics can have on other individuals."

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Members present model of new government structure 
By MATT BRAMANTI 
N<ws Wrirer 
Members of the Council of Beprosentativcs convened Monday night to reline their plans for tho restructuring of the Student Union system. 
At the meeting, the group's last of the scmestP.r, members pre­sented a working model of the new student government struc­
tun~. 
Outgoing student body president Pat I Iallahan said student leaders would continue to develop the proposed structure. "It's the not the final model, but it's what you're going to focus on next semester," Hallahan said. The meeting was his last. as he will graduate in December, turning over his position to vice president Jeremy Lao. 
Under the broad proposal. a student body president, elected by the students, would lead student government. The Council of Heprescntatives would be com­posed of 10 voting members, chaired by the president, who would only vote in the event of a tie. Elected members of the new council would include the student body vice president and each class president. The president would appoint members to represent the Financial Management Board, the Club Coordination Council and the Judicial Council. In addition, the president's chief of staff and the chair of the to-be-created Campus Programming Council would sit on the Council of Hepresentatives. 
The CPC would assume all cam­pus-wide programming efforts, replacing the Student Union Board. In discussions about pro­gramming, council members have said that the current SUB struc­ture is defective. 
"What we have right now is broken," said SUB manager Charlie Ebersol. "We need to cre­ate something that makes more sense." 
In the proposed model, 28 rep­resentatives -one from each res­idence hall and one ofT-campus resident -would sit on the CPC, which would be run by a steering committee overseen by an appointed chairperson. 
Members had differing opinions about how the CPC would be assembled, however. Under one plan. the CPC would have a body -similar to the current Hall Presidents Council -focused on dorm activities. In a competing proposal, hall presidents would meet informally to discuss those issues, while the CPC would focus exclusively on campus-wide events. 
It remained unclear exactly how residence halls would participate in the CPC. Some members called for dorms to elect a vice president, who would sit on the CPC, allow­ing the hall president to focus on dorm matters. Others, like HPC co-chair Sarah Keefer, said the proposal should include more hall leaders. 
"It takes a lot of work to do [programming]. Two people couldn't take on the responsibility for dorm programming and cam­pus programming," Keefer said. 
Hallahan encouraged members to weigh the costs and benefits of the different plans. "We need to lind a balance between one per­son doing everything iJ.nd 900 people doing hardly anything," he said. 
Director of Student Activities Brian Coughlin, who advises the COR, told members that the pro­posals' differences could be ironed out, and should not stall progress. 
"The frustration you're feeling right now might be unnecessary," Coughlin said. 
All members agreed on the basic structure of the policymak­ing side of student government, however. That side, to be called the Campus A!Tairs Council, would effectively replace the Student Senate. The CAC-which would be chaired by the vice president -would consist of 28 members, one from each dorm and one ofT­campus resident. The group would be divided into issue-specif­ic committees for the sake of effi­ciency. 
Lao was optimistic about the future of the Student Union. "We're going to create a new stu­dent government that's leaner and meaner, and we're going to get stuff done," he said. 

Ebersol wasn't as positive, not­ing the slow progress of the restructuring. "We're getting bogged down in titles," he said. "We've spent three and a half months having this debate." 
In other council news: 
+ 
Members voted to increase the number of signatures would-be candidates must gather to run for student body president and vice president. Beginning next semes­ter. a student must assemble 700 student signatures to be eligible for candidacy, up from 300. 

+ 
Judicial Council president Elliot Poindexter said his organization will hold an informational meeting 


for students interested in running for campus-wide office. The meet­ing will be held tonight at 7 p.m. in the Foster Hoom on the third floor of the LaFortune Student Center. 
+ Senior class president Jazmin Garcia said the class of 2004 will sponsor a Christmas party at K's Pub and Grill on Wednesday from 6:30-8:30 p.m. "We're getting together to celebrate the end of classes and to get ready for the men's basketball game against Indiana," Garcia said. "It's a toast to the Christmas season."

Officers pass changes to constitution 
By MEGAN O'NEIL News Writer 
Saint Mary's Board of Governance wrapped up the semester with holiday flair at Monday's meeting as officers unanimously passed minor changes to the student govern­ment constitution and exchanged Christmas gifts. 
Vice President Sarah Brown detailed alterations being made to the structure of the constitu­tion. Most consisted of specific wording changes and chronolo­gy of the document's sections. The description of the Student Government Association, for instance, will not precede the description of BOG. 
Brown also briefly discussed the new constitutional amend­ment process. 
"We just made it a lot clearer and more specific," she explained. 
Constitutional amendment submissions must be sent first to the constitutional committee for review. If approved, it will then move on to BOG where it will be voted on. Under the new rules. rejected amendments cannot be resubmitted without some change. 

"You can't just keep submit­ting the same amendment over and over," said Brown. "You have to change it somehow, whether it be the wording or format."

Saint Mary's students celebrate feast day 
By MEGAN O'NEIL 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's students cele­brated the Feast of the Immaculate Conception with a special dinner, mass and reception Monday. The scheduled events came as part of a new movement on campus to increase devotion to Mary, the College's patroness. 

In an effort to build up awareness for the Feast, a day of holy obligation for Catholics, student govern­ment posted signs around campus reminding students to honor the holy day of their patron saint. Students were encouraged to dress in the color blue, the symbolic color of Mary, as a sign of solidarity and were given blue ribbons to wear. 
Inspiration for the celebra­tion of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception came from such religious celebrations in years past in the Saint Mary's community. 
"We actually just got the idea for the event because we were going through some old stuff." said admissions commissioner Katie Harrison, "and we found that the Immaculate Conception is the patron saint of Saint Mary's." 
Adapting old religious col­lege traditions for the stu­

dent body today has not been easy, however. 
"You have to make it rele­vant to students, because something we had in the 50s might not work today," said Mission Commissioner Leah Holden-Corbett. 
She added that there had been a traditionally strong devotion to Mary at the College in the past, and annual events such as the Madonna Night and May Day were quite popular. In recent years this interest had begun to wane. 
"It is something that has 
been  lost  over  the  more  
recent  years  at  Saint  
Mary's," she said.  

In applying for her student government position, Holden-Corbett hoped that it was something she would be able to change. She and other board members explored ways in which to revitalize interest in the saint. The first step towards this goal, she said, was to honor Mary on her feast day in a way that students of today would enjoy. 
"We are trying to unite the school in new ways that per­tain to students in present days but still maintain the devotion that we had in the past," Holden-Corbett said.

CAMPUS LIFE COUNCIL 
Letter on senior privileges planned 
By ANDREW THAGARD 
Assistant News Editor 
The Campus Life Council tied up loose ends during its last meeting of the fall semester and the final one presided over by Student Body President Pat Hallahan. When the council reconvenes in January, Jeremy Lao, current student body vice president, will oversee the organ­ization. 
"I think we did a decent amount of stuff this semester," Hallahan said to the CLC. "We're making progress in a lot of areas. Keep up the good work." 
Lao promised to work with members to maintain the momentum started by Hallahan. 
"I really look forward to work­ing with everyone next semester," he said. 
During Monday's meeting, the council also discussed the work of the senior privileges task force. Members agreed to draft and send a letter to Father Mark Poorman, vice president of Student Affairs, outlining the research done so far on the feasi­bility of reserved parking for on­campus seniors without taking a position on the option. 
"I hate to see the work that this task force has done just sort of die," said Heather Rakoczy, rec­tor of Pangborn Hall and a mem­ber of CLC, regarding the deci­sion to forward the information. 
The senior privileges task force also informed the CLC that it is continuing to work on the possi­bility of having a weekly senior night at Legends during one of the establishment's slower days. While the event would be adver­tised to seniors, Legends would remain open to the general public during the proposed event. 
"We're continuing to get more senior leaders involved with the discussion," said Elliot Poindexter, Judicial Council presi­dent and a member of the CLC. 
In general, members respond­ed positively to the idea. 
"When someone spends mil­lions of dollars for the Notre Dame community [for building Legends] we should always be thinking of ways to use it," Hallahan said.

Korean museum reveals rifts 
Associated Press LOS ANGELES -A museum expected to unite the city's diverse Korean-American community, the largest outside the mother country, instead has divided it over differences about money and manage­ment. A grand opening ceremony was scheduled for Tuesday at the Korean National Association Memorial Hall, 
though questions about who will run it and even whether admission will be charged were still unanswered. 
Some involved in the dispute said it is a symptom of a com­munity divided between recent Korean immigrants and those whose families have been here for generations. It's a divide experts said is common in Korean-American communi­ties, where large gaps sepa­rate waves of immigrants. 
"What I've noticed is we don't think alike even though we're all Korean," said Christine Lee, a deaconess at the Korean United Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles, one of the parties in the dispute.

IN BRIEF 
Analysts predict no Fed move 
WASHINGTON -The Federal Reserve, linally starting to see the hoped-for rebound in the economy. is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at its last meeting of the year, allowing consumers and businesses to enjoy the lowest rates in decades into the new year. 
Analysts uniformly are predicting that the Fed's target for the federal funds rate, which has been at a 45-year low of 1 percent since June, will not be changed Tuesday even though the economy finally seems to be emerging from an extended period of lacklus­ter growth. 
The funds rate is the interest that banks charge each other for overnight loans. Commercial banks' prime interest rate, the benchmark for millions of consumer and busi­ness loans, moves in lockstep with changes in the funds rate. 
McDonald's stores post gains 
CHICAGO-McDonald's Corp. extended the recovery in its once-slumping restaurants to an eighth straight month, on Monday report­ing a double-digit gain in U.S. same-store sales and a modest improvement in Europe, its second-biggest market. 
Systemwide sales from the more than 30,000 McDonald's-brand restaurants world­wide jumped 14.9 percent from a year earlier as the world's largest fast-food chain contin­ued to benefit from new products, new mar­keting, a stronger economy and the dollar's weakness overseas. 
Court OKs Air Canada infusion 
TOHONTO -A Canadian bankruptcy judge approved a plan by Hong Kong businessman Victor Li to invest $488 million into Air Canada but left the door open Monday for a rival bid by a big U.S. investment company to help bail out the insolvent carrier. 
The court's ruling approved the Air Canada deal with Li's Trinity Time Investments, part of the carrier's plan to secure new financing so it can emerge from bankruptcy restructuring by year's end. Montreal-based Air Canada filed for bankruptcy on April 1.

Bush signs Medicare drug bill 
Seniors will face difficult choices when $400 billion in benefits begin in 2006 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON 
President Bush signed a 
new prescription drug ben­
efit into law Monday as 
part of historic Medicare 
changes that also will con­
front seniors with numer­
ous, sometimes-difficult 
choices on their health care 
coverage. 
Bush said the new drug insurance "will save our seniors from a lot of worry." But the bill's critics said the worries have just begun for Medicare's 40 million older and disabled Americans. 
The government will spend nearly $400 billion over the next 10 years to subsidize prescription drug coverage, which begins in January 2006. At the same time, the government will encourage insurance com­panies to offer private plans to millions of older Americans who now receive health care benefits under terms fixed by the federal government. 
"Medicine has changed but Medicare has not ­until today," Bush said, explaining that prescription drugs and outpatient care have replaced hospital stays over the past two decades. "Our seniors are fully capable of making health care choices, and this bill allows them to do that." 
Republicans generally hailed the signing as a political triumph they could use in next year's election to neutralize Democrats' usual advantage on issues regarding the elderly. 
"Democratic leaders have lashed out at us, at the president and AARP," House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas said. "But Democrats have no one to blame but themselves for their abject failure on health care. We wanted a bill, they just wanted an issue, and now the American people know who took their concerns seriously." 
Democrats pledged to 


Reulers 

President George W. Bush signs the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act as congressional leaders look on Monday. The controver­sial act pledges nearly $400 billion to pay for prescription drugs for seniors. 
fight in the Republican-controlled Congress for changes in the law, princi­pally for measures to bring down the price of prescrip­tion drugs. "You sold us out, so we're going to go all out to repeal what you've done," Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said. 
The first tangible result of the Medicare law will be prescription drug discount cards that the president said would take effect in June. He said seniors will receive a mailing in the spring to explain the card, which will cost no more than $30 a year. It will offer discounts that Bush said will range from 10 to 25 percent off retail prices. Critics say the promise of savings is wildly inflated. 
The president sought to reassure seniors Monday that their choices will be explained to them in detail and that they can keep the health care they have. 
"If you don't want to change your current cover­age, you don't have to change," Bush said. 
But that option may not exist for some seniors. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 2.7 
million retirees will lose the drug coverage they now receive from former employers, although other projections are much smaller. 
Those seniors who now rely on supplemental insur­ance to defray the cost of prescription drugs can choose to keep those so-called Medigap policies instead of signing up for the new benefit, the White House said. However, Medicare beneficiaries can­not be enrolled in both a Medigap plan and the new prescription drug plan. 
Some Medicaid benefici­aries, among the poorest of seniors, also could see restrictions placed on their drug coverage, several health analysts said. 
Whether to sign up for the drug benefit or switch from traditional Medicare to an HMO or preferred provider organization will be a decision that for many seniors will depend on their current or anticipated future spending on drugs. 
After paying for the first $250 in prescriptions, sen­iors will be responsible for 25 percent of the next $2,000 in drug costs. 
Between $2.250 and $5,100 in drug costs, the government will pay noth­ing. Over $5,100, the gov­ernment pays all but 5 per­cent of prescription costs. 
The monthly premium for the drug plan is estimated to-be a national average of $35 in 2006. But the exact shape and cost of the drug benefit also could differ from one region of the country to the next. And nothing in the law pre­eludes private insurers from offering more goner­ous but also more costly plans. 
The president said the average senior will see today's drug bill cut rough­ly in half. but his calcula­tion includes a savings of 20 percent that is not found in the law. Instead, the administration assumes that insurers will take advantage of seniors' aggregate purchasing power to negotiate drug prices that are on average 20 percent less than today's retail prices. 
The discount drug card will offer the administra­tion a test run of how well it can explain seniors' choices. 

Time Warner to offer voice on Net 
Associated Press 
KANSAS CITY, Mo.-Time Warner Cable announced a deal Monday with Sprint Corp. and MCI Inc. to offer phone service using the up-and-com­ing voice-over-Internet technology, one of the surest signs yet that cable companies are assaulting the local phone industry. 
While other cable companies sell phone service to their customers in selected markets, this deal is the first time the "voice-over-IP" technology will power nearly nationwide phone service by a cable company. 
"We've moved out of the talking stages and into the reality," said Jeff Kagan, an independent industry ana­lyst based in Atlanta. "2004 is going to be the year cable and phone com­panies get into each other's business and start competing." 

The technology will let Time Warner customers make calls with their regular phones, but the calls will travel as packets of data over the cable line that feeds into the house, rather than going through tradition­al, circuit-based phone wires. 
At a switching station, the calls will be transferred to either the MCI or Sprint phone networks and into the traditional format that reaches most phone users. 
Though the quality of voice-over-IP calls often aren't quite up to the standard of the traditional telephone networks. the technology is improv­ing. 
That gives cable companies an efii­cient way to break into the phone business. Meanwhile, telephone providers are increasingly going after the cable companies by cutting prices on digital subscriber line (DSL) high-speed Internet service and by bundling satellite TV service with local phone bills. 
Overland Park, Kan.-based Sprint and Ashburn, Va.-based MCJ, for­merly known as WorldCom Inc., said they were in talks to facilitate phone service for other cable providers but provided no other details. 
The companies provided no details about how much the deal was worth.

CDC to monitor flu complications 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA-The nation's health agency plans to closely watch flu complications among children, who have swamped hospitals in some states and surprised doctors with the severity of their illnesses. 
A new concern is the rise of a common drug-resistant staph infection that is complicating efforts to treat children with the flu. an official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. 
Tim Uyeki, epidemiologist with the influenza branch of CDC. said that some children have died from the staph infec­tions -a phenomenon the CDC has not seen before. 
Flu complications for chil­dren have always been dire: pneumonia, kidney and heart failure, possible brain damage. 
"We've just never seen them in the proportions we've seen them this year," said Steve Schexnayder, chief of pediatric critical care at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock. 
From Texas to California, children's hospitals have been swamped with sick children ­many of them desperately ill. 
The waiting room at Children's Hospital Central California in Madera was standing room only during the Thanksgiving holiday, and hos­pital officials said nearly every child tested positive for the flu. 
Children's Medical Center in Dallas has seen more than 500 kids with the flU: since October. One day last week, two dozen more appeared, most with enough lung disease to be put on ventilators, said Jane Siegel. 
"Because it seems to be a strain that has not circulated in the U.S. before and is not well-covered by the existing vaccine, we're seeing far more cases," said James Todd, direc­tor of epidemiology of Denver Children's Hospital. "Just because you're seeing more cases, you're seeing more com­plications." 
Doctors say some children are coming into hospitals with so much damage they are put on heart-lung bypass machines just to stay alive. 
Others face additional prob­lems: Nine-year-old Nick Collins at Arkansas Children's Hospital needed four chest tubes to drain fluid from holes in his lungs caused by bacterial pneumonia. Doctors are trying to prevent a blood clot from killing him. 
He also had methicillin­resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a usually mild infection which led to his severe pneumonia. Staph bac­teria are commonly found on the skin or in the nose and often go undetected. 
Uyeki said the children with staph-related flu likely picked up the bacteria before they were hospitalized. In October CDC warned parents that many school athletes had been found to carry MRSA. 

These infections don't nor­mally cause pneumonia with­out the flu virus, said Dr. Frederick Hayden, a flu expert and professor of internal medi­cine at the University of Virginia. 
But the flu virus can impair the body's ability to fight the bacteria and expel it. The bac­teria, in turn, can produce enzymes that enhance the flu's ability to infect cells. he said. 
Nick, a healthy boy until he got the flu in early November, is doing better, having been removed from a ventilator on Friday. But he'll likely have to stay in the hospital through the end of the year, his mother says. 
"It's scary to find that some­thing as common as the flu can cause something this major every year," said his mother, Kim Collins of Texarkana, Texas. "We sit around for days in awe of the fact the flu has caused all of this." 
Flu and its complications are the sixth leading cause of death nationally among chil­dren age 4 and younger, according to the CDC. 
Anecdotally, this flu season seems to be worse for children. But because the CDC doesn't keep track of flu deaths, it's unclear how much worse. This year the agency is planning to collect data on children who die from the flu, those with MRSA, and those who develop brain damage, said Keiji Fukuda, chief of epidemiology in the CDC's influenza branch. 

Psychologist said Malva was spotter, not shooter 
Associated Press 
CHESAPEAKE, Va. -Lee Boyd Malvo was th spotter ­not the shooter -in all but one of last year's sniper killings, Malvo told a psychologist, con­tradicting the confession he gave to police. 
Malvo blamed himself for the arrest of sniper mastermind John Allen Muhammad, and felt compelled to take the blame for the sniper rampage, psychologist Dewey Cornell tes­tified Monday at Malvo's trial. 
Malva's confession -in which he claimed he wa.s the shooter in all of last year's sniper shootings in metropoli­tan Washington that left 10 dead -was "an attempt to sacrifice himself and claim credit to spare Mr. Muhammad," said Cornell, of the University of Virginia. 
"He felt responsible for their being caught by falling asleep, and he blamed himself for the failure of their mission," Cornell said. Malvo and Muhammad were arrested while sleeping in a car at a highway rest stop in Maryland. 
Malvo is presenting an insan­ity defense to capital murder charges in the Oct. 14, 2002, slaying of FBI analyst Linda Franklin outside a Home Depot. The defense claims he was brainwashed by Muhammad and could no longer tell right from wrong. 
Cornell said that after Malvo had been indoctrinated by Muhammad. "he believed what he was doing was right and that John Muhammad was a chosen person of Allah." 
Cornell diagnosed Malvo with a dissociative disorder, a form of mental illness in which a person loses touch with reality and his own identity becomes distorted. Cornell gave no opin­ion on whether the mental dis­ease rose to the level of insani­ty. 
"This was a very unusual, rare case," he said. 
Prosecutor Robert Horan Jr. expressed skepticism about the diagnosis, saying that a disso­ciative disorder from brain­washing is poorly defined in the medical literature. 
While Malva's lawyers admit he took part in the killings. they have disputed that he was the triggerman. If the jury rejects the insanity defense but concludes that the government could not prove Malvo was the triggerman. it may be more dif­ficult to obtain a death penalty under Virginia law. 
Cornell said Muhammad and Malvo often discussed right and wrong, and Muhammad told him "that right and wrong do not exist." 
Muhammad said the two were in a war, and that "the winners in a war determine which killings are right and wrong," Cornell said.

South Dakota congressman convicted of manslaughter 
Associated Press 
FIANDHEAU, S.D. -In a ver­diet that could bring an abrupt end to a three-decade political career. a jury convicted Hep. Bill Janklow of manslaughter Monday for a collision that killed a motorcyclist. rejecting the con­gressman's claim that he wa.<> dis­orhmted by a diabetic reaction. 
The jury in Janklow's boyhood hometown deliberated for about live hours before returning its verdict. 
Janklow appeared stunned as the verdict was read. lie walked steadily out of the courtroom, got in a vehicle driven by his son and left the courthouse. He refused to respond to questions shouted by a horde of reporters. 
Janklow, 64, was convicted of second-degree manslaughter, reckless driving, running a stop sign and speeding for the Aug. 16 crash that killed Handy Scott, 55, a farmer from Hardwick, Minn. Prosecutors said Janklow was traveling more than 70 mph in his white Cadillac when he crashed with Scott's Harley­Davidson. 
Janklow could get up to 10 years in prison on the manslaughter charge and also 

face a House ethics committee investigation that could lead to his expulsion. Judge Rodney Steele set sentencing for Jan. 20. 
Jurors left the courthouse with­out talking to reporters. '}'hey were escorted out by the sheriff, who said the jurors don't want to talk to the media. Both prosecu­tor Bill Ellingson and defense attorney Ed Evans refused com­ment. 
Janklow, a Republican, was elected to South Dakota's lone !louse seat last year following an 
· extraordinary political career in which he served four years as state attorney general in the 1970s and 16 years as governor. During his two stints as governor, Janklow won over legions of vot­ers in heavily conservative South Dakota with his tough-talking, maverick style. 
His trial created a scenario that once would have seemed unthinkable in this rural state: the enormously powerful Janklow on trial for manslaugh­ter in the farming community where he grew up. 
The trial began Dec. 1 with a jury-selection process that revealed Janklow's widespread popularity in Flandreau, a town of about 2,000 people. Several jury candidates knew Janklow and his family, including one who shook hands with the former governor as he len the court­room. 
Once a panel was chosen. jurors witnessed several emo­tional images during five days of testimony, including Janklow in tears as he described his grief over the crash. A man who was riding motorcycles with Scott cried as he recalled finding the victim's mangled body in a soy­bean field. Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, himself a pillar of South Dakota politics, also took the stand.

Associated Press STANFORD, Ca. -Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry proposed a broad eco­nomic recovery program that ties job creation to technological innovation, investment and training as he campaigns in a Silicon Valley still reeling from the technology bust. "Today, an agenda for high­tech is an agenda for our eco­nomic future," the Massachusetts senator said in a speech Monday at Stanford University. "And the promise of the Information Age was more than a bubble-it was a break­through from which we will never turn back." Kerry's praise for Silicon Valley's fabled garage-based startup companies and the soar­ing possibilities of the Internet carried an ironic note: Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean cat­apulted to the top of the field through his campaign's innova­tive use of the Internet in fund­raising and organization. With Dean dominating polls in New Hampshire, Kerry's aides released a memo over the weekend that said the senator now is "competing for the top three spots in Iowa and top two in New Hampshire." The memo noted that any candidate who gets 15 percent of the vote will win delegates to the party's national convention. It also cited statistics from 2000 that showed 82 percent of New Hampshire Democrats didn't decide for whom to vote until after Jan. 1. In Iowa on Monday, the Kerry campaign described plans for a 
live broadcast with uncommit­ted voters to broaden his appeal in the state and a separate push to attract veterans and women. Staffers said they arc increasing the size of their Iowa organiza­tion, in part by bringing in workers from other states. 
In his remarks at Stanford, Kerry charged President Bush with having an "anti-science attitude" that had hindered research into stem cells and global warming. He also blamed Bush for the loss of 3 million jobs nationwide, including thou­sands of high-tech jobs in New Hampshire. 
Kerry outlined five major goals of his job-creation plan of encouraging technological inno­vation by investing in small technology companies, offering tax credits for research and development, and expanding broadband Internet capability; improving high-tech infrastruc­ture and making Internet access universally available; strength­ening markets by enforcing trade law, preventing intellectu­al piracy, boosting corporate accountability and balancing the federal budget; preparing students for the work force by improving math and science education and making college more affordable; using technol­ogy to improve health and safe­ty through biotechnology, stein­cell research and national secu­rity. 
Kerry also used the forum to continue his criticism of Bush's handling of Iraq, accusing the president of using "hubris and swagger" in his handling of international affairs. 

Godfather of funk arrested for possession 
Associated Press 
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -Funk music pioneer George Clinton was arrested and charged with drug possession after allegedly admitting to an officer he had cocaine in his pocket. · 
Clinton, of Tallahassee, was arrested Saturday and released on bond, according to jail offi­cials, who wouldn't release any other information. 
The musician's lawyer, Shoshana Zisk of San Francisco, didn't immediately return a call for comment. 
Clinton's home number is unlisted. 
Clinton, 63, who headed the funk bands Parliament and Funkadelic -and the collabo­ration later known as P-Funk­in the 1970s and 1980s is con­sidered a father of the genre. In 1983, Clinton's solo record, "Atomic Dog," rose to the top of the H&B charts. 
Clinton was sitting by himself in a car in a gas station parking lot early Saturday when a police officer approached him, said Tallahassee Police spokesman Stewart Clendinen.

treasured figures when they died last week. 

Both attended Notre Dame and returned to bolster the University and the surrounding community with their energy and talents. Moore, a member of the founding staff of The Observer, spent 20 years working in journalism and corporate relations both in this country and in Ireland. He returned to Notre Dame to work in public relations in 1988, was promoted to director in 1990 and served as the official spokesman for the University until 2002, when he was appointed associate vice president of public affairs and communication. He was universally respected for his tact, personality and deep faith. His love for God and the University shone through his service and his actions every day. 
Powers, an inductee in the Indiana Journalism Hall of Fame, led a journalistic life about which most reporters 
LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

idolized him, hanging on his advice and criti­
cism about work and journalism. The University established an internship at The Tribune in his name. 
These two men embodied the spirit of Notre Dame. They gave their all to their families, their communities, their jobs and the University. Everyone who knew them -and those who knew of them -knew of this dedication and aspired to live by their examples. 
Moore lived for people, always remembering faces and names-and no one will ever forget his. Powers provided his students with an example of excellence and dedication and will be remembered as a legend. The University suf­fered a great loss with their deaths, as Notre Dame would not be what it is today without the differences they made 
· with their lives. May we all aspire to live lives so great. 

Does pornography plague ND? 
What is the most harmful addiction facing men of the Notre Dame cam­pus? Surprisingly it's not alcohol or any narcotic; it's pornography. 
Although pornography affects both men and women, this addiction is pri­marily one of males; yet it involves everyone. Pornography has long-last­ing, damaging effects; it is a fantasy world and a gross misrepresentation of the body and sexuality. 
The human body is not the air­brushed, plastic surgery fantasy of XXX material. No one's body looks like that, or will stay that way. Men, what happens when your wife has children and the curves you married begin to sag? Women, do you want to worry about your husband always looking at women with better bodies? 
This is why Ms. Griswold effectively compares pornography to slavery in her Dec. 3 letter; it reduces people to objects, mere role players to be used rather than people to be loved. Sex becomes selfish gratification rather than a gift of self, and its beauty is dis­torted into something dehumanizing. 

Surprisingly, many men are unaware of tpe subtle danger of pornography; they are unknowingly training themselves to get their sexual "fix," becoming slaves to their sex drive. The result is a dysfunctional sex life and a distorted view of life and relationships. One becomes incapable of healthy relationships and a normal marriage. 
The disastrous effects are manifest­ed later in life: divorce, multiple mar­riages, broken families and heartache for children, the extended family and the entire community. 
This is the reality of pornography; it is never an isolated act. It affects all of society. and this dirty secret will make itself known. Yet we are all responsi­ble. Women, don't reduce yourselves to objects for men to use by the way you dress and act. Men, even if women do, that gives you no right to abuse them. 
Here Mr. Duda in his letter makes a weak argument by saying "All have made the choice to be there." This argument is a smoke screen that fails to address the actual problem of pornography and its effects. The "right to choose" says nothing about the choice itself. Kids choose to play with fire. Teenagers choose to use drugs. Their choices do not justify their actions. 
So the question remains: Do you want to have healthy relationships and a strong marriage and family in the future? 
If the answer is yes, then everyone must begin to say no to pornography right now.

A Call to 
good, old 203 Sorin 
Action
llall, I am going to write this, my final column of my tirst semester as an Observer columnist, about the most mainstream thing on America's plate these days: Christmas. Just don't count on me being too con­ventional. 
When I begin to reflect upon the holi­day that more Americans enjoy than any other, I lind myself torn. Of course I want to condemn the rampant materi­alism, consumerism and commercial­ism that plague modern Christmas, but I have to admit that I. too, love running down the stairs in the Quaranta house on Christmas morning, pushing my brother and sister to the side that I might gel the first look at the presents under the tree. 
This leaves me with one grand ques­tion: Can we have a modern Christmas with materialism and still pursue a just. humane and meaningful celebra­tion of the birth of Christ, who is the light and redemption of the world for all who call themselves Christian? 
For the sake of argument and because I will never give up my lie­Man action tigures, I am going to wager a yes. 
Of course. this does not mean that I am sanctioning or recommending the sort of materialistic approach to Christmas that so often pervades Macy's, Michigan Avenue in Chicago and even our own God-given Notre Dame Bookstore. At what point does Christmas become more about buying gifts and spending money than showing love and celebrating hope? How much can one justify buying in a world where more than 3 billion people live with under $2 per day? These are all questions that each individual must evalu­ate. 
The question that I want to tackle is this: How can we act, in simple and real ways, to make this Christmas sea­son a more just and humane time? 
I want to suggest four ways that we can do so. These simple acts take lit­tle time, little money and little effort, but they can make a huge difference. 
First, one way to promote jus­tice this Christmas is to be conscious of the places and com­panies from which we buy our gifts. We all have significant power as consumers to support compa­nies that promote just practices ver­sus those that are guilty of such crimes as treating women unfairly, using sweatshop labor and polluting the envi­ronment. A good place to start for such empowered and focused consumerism is www.idealswork.com. 
A second way to promote a just and 


LETTER TO THE EDITOR Committing to both God and politics 
BJ Strew's Dec. 8 column, "Bush's imperial theology," attempts to strike the worst fears in Americans. In it, he not only por­trays America's president as a 19th-century imperialist stalwart, but he also compares President Bush's ideology to that of the ter­rorist group Al-Qaeda. Such fear­mongering and degradation is not only divisive, but it is rather unhelpful to the effort of helping our country during this time of war. 

I do not know for Strew, but as for me, I do believe there is evil in the world. Slavery was evil, as was the Holocaust; ditto for the gulags of the Soviet Union. The use of the term "evil," by our President mere­ly illustrates an otherwise abstract adversary to common folks in America: he is calling it as he sees it. Any reasonable American, regardless of his or her position on the Iraqi War, agrees that there is a such thing as good and evil in this world, and Saddam Hussein sure isn't on the side of good. 
Moreover, the magazine that Mr. Strew quotes from, "The Nation," is not known for its American-friend­ly articles. In fact, its most recent online version has a piece that blames the riots of the 1970s not on drug-crazed draft-dodgers, but rather on men who actually went to Vietnam to defend America. against communist insurgency: "Thirty-five years ago, hundreds of thousands of people took angrily to the streets, universities were taken over and a sitting President was hounded from the White House because of people like Wesley Clark." Clark was then a Lieutenant in the Army and felt it his duty to serve America. 
It is no wonder that this fringe element of American politics is always the most critical of those who serve "a higher calling" and seek guidance from God while doing so. It is clear that the likes of "The Nation" and Mr. Strew don't think too highly of tradition-minded Americans. whether President Bush or General Clark. Thus, regardless of your party affiliation, let not this fringe element question your com­mitment to God, Country or Notre Dame. Instead, let us unite to ensure that light will overcome darkness throughout the world.

humane world this Christmas is to make donations to charities as part of or in place of giving gifts to another person. A good friend of mine of the 
more radical nature is asking for his parents to donate money to OxFam International, an organization that focuses on development in the third world, rather than give gifts, but not everyone needs to go that far. There are so many charities 
and organiza­tions, though, which are in 
dire need for 
. · funds and could use as much help as they can get. A couple good ones, for a start, are Maryknoll, 
Catholic Relief Services and Catholic Charities. Third, one can 
give the gift of commitment. The holiday season is a perfect time to make 
a commitment to vol­unteer in a local soup 
kitchen. become more politically engaged or do some other small act for the 
common good. Imagine if everyone committed to spending the same amount of time that they went shop­ping to doing some sort of community service. 
Fourth and finally, we can give the gift of time. By this, I mean we should make it a point to spend more time with those around us, especially family and friends. Amidst our hectic, work­driven existences, it is important to make time to sit down, drink coffee and develop fellowship. Christmas, in its purest sense, is about love, which finds its home most clearly in community (and coffee). 
Very often, our actions at Christmas, aimed at showing our love for someone close to us, cause the suffering of many people that we will never know. It does not have to be this way. In the end, rather than playing to a zero-sum game as we so easily can do, we arc able to play to a positive-sum game, where everyone wins and justice rolls forth. 
If and when we do these four things, the world will become more just and humane. Through these practices, we will also be making our own holiday celebrations more fultilling and mean­ingful. 
Though it is unlikely that this piece of Christmas literature will tinct its way into the box of such classics as "A Christmas Carol" or "The Charlie Brown Christmas" special, at least I appeased my roommate, made an argument for justice. did not offend too many people and did not call for revo­lution.

CONCERT REVIEW 

Bebop Rocksteady intpresses Reekers crowd 
By PAUL STEINLE 
Scene Critic 
I've seen Bebop Rocksteady before, off and on, since 7th grade. Three guys playing covers isn't exactly groundbreaking material. We've all seen and heard it before; BBR represents the latest incarna­tion of three guys playing songs they didn't write. 
So what led me to Reekers on this Saturday night? If I really wanted to appease my appetite for music, I could always go to Legends and lis­ten to a pretty boy with a sweet voice croon sappy acoustic love songs to a 90 percent female audi­ence or I could swing into South Bend and check out the thriving bohemian arts scene -and we all know it's there 

with BBR. Play a cover, do sorr e­thing funny. Play a cover, do some­thing funny. 
It's not my place to criticize the lack of original material in BBH's seL They are capable musicians. Featuring Andrew Zwers on bass and Justin Oppel on drums, each song was full of spirit and was played with a unique twist that comes to define BBR. 
Despite a late start and slight unpreparedness evident by t.1e arguments about which songs to play, BBR displayed an enthusia~m that carried over to the good-siz~d crowd present. 
The set was comprised of two types of songs: those written in t.1e 1970s and those written in the 1990s -Green Day to the Doobie Brothers, from Blink-182 to

Standing on stage with horn­rimmed glasses and a sweater vest, lead singer/guitarist Matt Fantazier bore a certain resemblance to one Rivers Cuomo. I was not surprised, therefore, when BBR played Weezer's "Don't Let Go" early in their set. 
Yet I was greatly amused when Fantazier ended the song by tossing a sweater vest to a pretty young lady in the audience. This sequence of events summarizes an evening 
better than no 

punk at all, and technically, 70s rock isn't all th'l.t bad. Afterall, Lynrd Skynrd d.d release an album the same year as the Stooges, right? No complaints, given the circumstances. However, I must question the choice to plE.y "Fortunate Son" by CCR.

Zwers's John Fogerty-influ­enced vocals could use some work however, as he missed the stuttering 

present on "My Sharona" by the Knack. 
A little more stage presence wouldn't hurt the band either, yet this won't be a difficult obstacle to overcome, given BBR's obvi­ous love of the spotlight. And kudos to drum­mer Justin Oppel: anyone who brings their drum set to one of Notre Dame's cell-block dorm rooms deserves our respect. Either you truly have a passion for music, or you enjoy putting as much junk as possible in your room. I believe in the former.

as BBH played. I couldn't help it. They're funny. Like the kid who tells so many dumb jokes that by the 20th time you feel your ribs breaking from laughing; that's BBR. Perfectly harmless, unconcerned with being "cool." They just want to rock, and they want you along with them. 
Artistic vision is not a prerogative. Radiohead, they are not, but hey, this isn't NYU. This is Notre Dame. 
It's wonderful to see three guys who scoff at taking themselves seriously. Bebop Rocksteady supplies a sense of humor to a university that sorely needs it. 
Now if we could only get a band to supply a more progressive way of thinking.

ALBUM REVIEW 

'In Time': A brief history of R.E.M. 
By MOLLY GRIFFIN 
Scene Music Critic 
R.E.M. does not look or act like a typical rock band. Michael Stipe, the lead singer, is tall, lanky and bald and the other band members don't have a visible tattoo, piercing or obnoxious dye job among them. The fact that they've been around long enough to put out their "best of" CD, In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003, pro­vides further proof of their distinct difference from the rest of rock and roll. 

The CD covers R.E.M.'s music from the release of their album, Gree1::, which was the first that gained any major national attention. This unfor­tunately keeps their infamously karaoke-unfriendly song, "It's the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)," off of the album. 
Aside from that major exclusion, the album includes a variety of their most famous songs, as well as a few lesser­known but equally good ones. In Time spans from "Man on the Moon" tJ "Everybody Hurts," and to their most 
famous song, "Losing M.v Religion." 
Songs that aren't quite a.;; famous but still provide perspec­tive on R.E.M.':; style and caree  include "At M'f Most Beautiful;, and "Daysleeper" from their 199B disc Up; "E-Bow the Letter" and "Electrolite" from 1996's New Adventures in Hi-Fi and "The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight" from Automatic 

for the People ir 
1992. 
The CD also includes two new songs, "Bad Day" a n d "Animal," which are surprisingly good and add to the album as a whole which is a rare occur­rence, consid­ering the kind 

of hastily thrown together "new" songs that are usually included with greatest hits COs. "Bad Day" is reminiscent of "It's the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)" because of it's rapid-fire delivery and up-beat tempo, and "Animal" has a more driving melody. 
The booklet included with the CD contains the background behind each song on the album and the insight provided on the sources of or mean­ings behind some of the songs is fasci­nating, not just for R.E.M. fans but also for anyone with an interest in how music comes to fruition. 
Nothing other than the background to songs is included in the booklet and lyrics, like on most R.E.M. albums, and must be hunted down on the Internet because the band doesn't include them. 
Overall, In Time is an enjoyable CD, and it represents the breadth of R.E.M.'s career, but it doesn't have the depth that a band with the longevity and talent of R.E.M. deserves. Granted, summarizing their lengthy career in one disc is a near impossible task, and In Time is a valiant effort, but it just feels incomplete. 
The music itself suffers nothing by being on the disk, but R.E.M. as a band isn't adequately represented by the material included. If they had just taken the risk and made it a two-disc set, it would have been a much more complete and satisfying effort.

DVD REVIEW 
A DVD fit for a blockbuster 
By MOLLY GRIFFIN Scene Movie Critic 
Sometimes, watching a "summer" movie you enjoyed in theaters after it is roleased on DVD makes you wonder if you'd been out in the heat too long. Notorious for having little to no plot and more than enough spPrial offects to make up for that vacuum in the story line, they fre­quently have the shelf life of a dairy product. 
Summer movies are a lot like Popsicles: they're perfect in the summer, but come January their appeal is gone. X2: X-Men United, surprisingly breaks this trend. It had everything that makes a great summer flick, but it doesn't Jose its charm on subsequent viewings. It also breaks the mold of most Sl'(jUPis by being just as good, if not bPtt.Pr. than thP original. 
Htturning from thP first X-Men i'iltu are Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). Storm (llalle Berry), Hogue (Anna Paquin). Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Cyclops (James Marsden), as well as their villainous mutant coun­terparts Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Mystique (Rebecca Rom ij n -Stamos). 
Joining the cast are Nightcrawler (Alan Cummings). a blue, German monk who can teleport, and Deathstryke (Kelly Hu). a sort of female Wolverine in serious need of a manicure. 
It can be a little hard at times lo keep track of all of the mutants and their individual background stories, but fans will appreciate glimpses of characters like Colossus and Beast who played a large role in the comic and cartoon but not on the big screen. 
X2 picks up where the first movie left off, following the exploits of Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his school for gifted youngsters-a.k.a. mutants. 
The twist with X2 is that they bring back the same villains from the first film, but instead of fighting these same forces, the X-Men must unite with them to fight an even greater threat. 
Mutant registration acts arc being pushed through congress. and General William Stryker (Brian Cox) 
is dedicated to hunting every mutant down. Stryker is a great vil­lain, and the second movie proves to be highly entertaining, although a bit on the slow side at times. 
The two-disc DVD set of X2: X-Men United provides a ton of extras, and the additions prove to be a fitting addition to the 

Photo courtesy of WW1N.Im1oo.c1Jm Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Pyro (Aaron Stanford) and Rogue (Anna Paquin) find themselves in a tight spot in 'X2: X-Men United.' 
film itself: The sound and picture on the discs are good, and the sound­track, as with most big, action-driv­en films, is quite loud and bombas­tic. 
Extras include interviews and dis­cussions with the director, produc­ers, writers and cinematographers about various facets of the film, and there is an almost hour-long docu­mentary about the production and the biographies of the individual characters, which includes cast and crew interviews. 
There are several special effects explanations, including many 
regarding Nightcrawler and one focusing on the Wolverine/Deathstryke fight, and there are pieces on the costumes, music and design for the film. Also included are trailers. webcast high­lights from interviews for the film's release and a photo gallery. 
All in all, this DVD is a fitting addition to a film with a fan base and a history that demands more than the average from a DVD.

'Last Samurai' cruises to box office win 
Auo<iatrd Press 
The /,ast Samurai came in first at the weekend box office as the Tom Cruise war epic cut down the compe­tition with $24.4 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. 
In the film, Cruise plays a down­trodden Civil War veteran who roelaims honor by forging a bond with samurai warriors-despite having been brought to Japan to quash their rebellion by training a mercenary army for the Japanese 
nrnperor. 
Cruise's other recent films have opened stronger, such as the $35.6 million debut for Minority Report and the $57.8 million opening of Mission: Impossible II. Samurai, which is nearly two-and-a-half hours long, had a similar opening gross to Vanilla Sky, which collected $25 million in its first weekend. 
"It's almost a lock that every time lw opens a movie it comes in at No. 1. This guy is box office insurance per­sonified," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Exhibitor Helations. "For an H-rated film, a very long film. a period epic­
think this speaks to Tom Cruise's drawing power." 
The debut of Samurai toppled last week's No. 1 movie, Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the 1/at, which fell to fifth place with $7.3 million. 
So far, Cat has earned a total of $85.5 million, according to Universal Pictures, placing it far behind the studio's 2000 Jim Currey comedy Dr. Seuss · How the Grinch Stole Christmas, which had collected about $172 million at the same point in its release. Grinch ultimately earned $260 million by the end of its run. 
The Jessica Alba aspiring-dancer melodrama Honey, the only other new movie opening in wide release, ranked second this weekend with $14 million despite generally poor reviews, some of which compared its story to the infamous Mariah Carey bomb Glitter. 
It's a strong opening for the former star of TV's Dark Angel, and distribu­tor Universal Pictures said the audi­ence for Honey was about 75 percent under 21 and 74 percent female. That proved to be wise counter pro­gramming against Samurai, which had audiences skewing older and predominantly male, Dergarabedian said. 
"Universal selected just the right movie to go up against The Last Samurai, the two movies couldn't be more different," he said. 
In only 126 theaters, a re-release of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rir?g added $431,000 to that film's total gross, bringing it to $313.8 million. 
New Line Cinema is reissuing the previous two films to a handful of theaters in advance of the Dec. 17 debut of the final Rings installment: The Return of the King. This coming week, The Two Towers will be in the­aters again. 
There's a moviegoing vacuum that usually follows the weekend after the Thanksgiving holiday, and many of the top holdover movies saw ticket sales drop by more than 60 percent this weekend. Snowfall in the north-

eastern states may also have kept people at home and away from the­aters. 
Nonetheless, the overall box-office was up about 34 percent. The top 12 movies took in $91.8 million from Friday to Sunday compared to $68.5 million from the same weekend last year, when Die Another Day and Analyze That topped the box-office.

Maddux, Braves part ways after 11 seasons 

Team declines arbitration with long-time starter

ATLANTA -If Greg Maddux stays true to form -and does­n't he always?-the 300th win should come shortly after next year's All Star game. 
He won't get it wearing an Atlanta uniform. 
The Braves bid adieu to their longtime ace, cutting ties with Maddux by declining to offer arbitration by a midnight Sunday deadline. While the decision had been expected for weeks. if not months, it still marked the end

That was only the beginning of the Braves' new world, which calls for the team to pursue its 13th straight division title with a much-smaller payroll. 
But Schllerholz confidently predicted that Atlanta will again be a contender in the NL East, even with lower-salaried play­ers. 
"We shouldn't worry what the team's roster looks like today," he said. "We have a lot of time to work on the construction of our roster. This is a meaningless date in terms of what our team will look like on opening day. We will have a very good team." 
The team is pursuing a trade or signing to fill Sheffield's spot -Jose Cruz Jr., Jose Guillen and Jacque Jones have been mentioned as possibilities ­and the top of the rotation is still strong with Russ Ortiz, Mike Hampton and Horacio Ramirez. 
· "I think it's going to be very interesting, and maybe very exciting for the fans," Schuerholz said. "While we have said goodbye to some favorite players over the years, I think they're going to be excited by the new look, the new mix." 
Asked what he'll remember 
about the right-hander, 
Schuerholz paused for a 
moment. 

"Just his consistency," the GM 
finally said. "Just his consistent

Kansas drops after loss to Stanford 
Associated Press 
Three weeks, three No. 1s. 
Florida moved into the top spot in The Associated Press college basketball poll Monday, the third straight week there has been a new No. 1 team. 
The Gators (5-0) moved up one spot to replace Kansas, which lost 64-58 to Stanford on Saturday. The Jayhawks held the No. 1 ranking for just one week after replacing Connecticut; the Huskies were on top for the preseason and the first two weeks of the regular season. 
Stanford, which beat a No. 1 team for the third time in school history, had the week's biggest jump, moving from 21st to 13th. 
The last time there were three No. 1 teams in as many weeks was the end of the 1999-00 season, when Stanford.

O'Leary, the former Georgia Tech coach, wasn't out of work long after his brief stay at Notre Dame. After leaving in mid-December 2001, O'Leary was hired by the Vikings less than a month later. 
At Georgia Tech, O'Leary had a 52-33 record from 1994­2001. UCF athletic director Steve Orsini was Georgia Tech's senior associate athletic director during O'Leary's tenure there. 
O'Leary will finish the season with Minnesota, which is 8-5 and in position to make the playoffs. 
He is a taking over a Central Florida program battered by losses on the field and disci­pline problems off the field. 
Although the Golden Knights were expected to contend in the Mid-American Conference's East Division, their 3-9 record was their worst since 1984. Coincidentally, that was the last year the program lost a coach during the season. 
In addition, the Knights had eight players, including four starters, suspended this season for various infractions. 
O'Leary's five-year contract reportedly was worth about $700,000 annually. 
That financial package would be far mon'l than what UCF has paid in the past. Kruczek made $185,000 a year. 
Central Florida spokesman John Marini said he did not know the details of O'Leary's contract. 
Central Florida has been competing at the Division 1-A level for eight years, and the 2002 season was its first as a member of a conference after 23 years as an independent.

"I see the University of Central Florida as a sleeping giant," O'Leary said at a news conference. 
O'Leary acknowledged the problems in his past, saying he was ready to move on. He had lied about earning a master's degree and receiving three let­ters playing football at New Hampshire. He resigned less than a week after Notre Dame hired him in 2001. 
"I made a terrible, terrible mistake as a youngster and I paid a dear price for it," he said. ''I'm truly sorry for that ... My past is my past." 
Central Florida president John Hitt said a thorough background check was done on O'Leary, and he was confi­dent he made the right deci­sion in hiring him. 
"I think he deserves another chance," Hitt said. "How he handles that chance, of course, we'll all be watching to see."

NHL 
Hullm_oves to into third place on scoring 
Red Wings jump ahead 2-0, hang on to win 
Associated Press 
DETROIT-Brett Hull moved into third place on the NHL career goal list by scoring 1:51 into overtime Monday night of the Detroit Red Wings' 3-2 vic­tory over the Los Angeles Kings. 
Hull's 732nd goal snapped a tie with Marcel Dionne and moved the Red Wings forward behind only Wayne Gretzky 
(894) and Gordie Howe (801). Hull, who also had an assist, one-timed a shot from the bot­tom of the left circle to give him a goal in his seventh straight game. 
Los Angeles rallied from a 2-0 third-period deficit on goals by Mike Cammalleri and Martin Straka to force overtime. 
Straka tied it at 2 with 2:10 remaining after a turnover by Steve Thomas along the boards. Straka beat Dominik Hasek between the pads with a shot from the bottom of the right cir­cle. 
Cammalleri brought Los Angeles within 2-1 when he scored with 9:06 remaining. 
Brendan Shanahan and Pavel Datsyuk had the other Detroit goals, 
Shanahan's goal was his 544th, tying him for 19th place with Hall of Farner Maurice Richard. 
Red Wings defenseman Chris Chelios left the game early in the second period with a knee injury. He collided with Cammalleri late in the first peri­od and went down holding the knee. He returned for the first shift of the second period, but went to the locker room after that. 
Bruins 2, Senators 2 
Glen Murray had a goal and an assist to lead the Boston Bruins to a 2-2 tie with the Ottawa Senators on Monday night. 
Murray gave the Bruins a 2-1 lead with a breakaway goal 
6:45 into the second period. He stole a pass near center ice, skated in and flipped a back­bander past goaltender Patrick Lalime into the far top corner of the net. 
Lalime made 21 saves in his return from a bout with the-flu that forced him to miss the pre­vious four contests. 
The Senators tied it with 3:39 remaining in the second when defenseman Wade Redden put a rebound past Boston's Andrew Raycraft for his seventh goal of the season. 
The Bruins are 0-2-3 in their last five home games and are winless against Ottawa in four. Boston hasn't beaten the Senators since Nov. 9, 2002. 
Ottawa. which failed to beat the Bruins in its ftrst 22 games. is 13-4-4 in 21 games against them since the start of the 1999-2000 season. 
The lone goal of the first peri­od came when Raycraft's skates slipped from under him, leaving an empty net for forward Vaclav Varada to score his fifth of the season.

Woods wins fifth straight PLOY award 
Associated Press 
THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -A wild season in golf came to a familiar conclusion Monday when Tiger Woods was voted PGA Tour player of the year for the fifth straight time, nar­rowly beating Vijay Singh. 
Woods failed to win the PGA Tour money title or a major championship for the first time since 1998. Still, his peers decided his season was the best on tour. 
Woods won five times, including two World Golf Championships, had the lowest scoring average and was sec­ond on the money list, despite playing only 18 times. 
"There's a tremendous amount of satisfaction because it just shows that guys on the tour respect that I was consis­tent, that I've won numerous times," Woods said. "I think that's what the award reflects." 
The PGA Tour does not release vote totals. 
Ben Curtis was voted rookie of the year for winning the British Open in his first appearance at a major. Peter Jacobsen was voted comeback player of the year for winning the Greater Hartford Open at age 49, his first tour victory in eight years. 
Woods won for the sixth time in seven years; no one else has won player of the year more than twice since it was created in 1990. 
He became the first player since Greg Norman in 1995 to win the award despite not winning a major. 
Woods led the PGA Tour in victories for the fifth straight year, and his 68.41 adjusted scoring average was the sec­ond-lowest in history behind his 68.13 mark in 2000. 
While Woods has said majors are the most important, more than that went into this vote. 
"Number of wins and quality for the entire year," Woods said. "I had the second-lowest scoring average in tour history next to mine in 2000, so that shows I played at a consistent level for the entire year." 
Singh was equally consis­tent, winning four times -in the winter, spring, summer and fall -and ending Woods' four-year reign atop the money list with $7.5 million.

Tean~ starts season 17-3 behind good team chemistry 

Associated Press 
EL ~iEGUNDO, Calif. -Shaquille O'Neal has never been on such a tight-knit team. 
Karl .\1alone is reminded of what it was like to play in high school. 
Hora ~e Grant and Gary Payton love what's happened so far but think there's plenty of room for improvement. 
Yes, the Los Angeles Lakers have hit it off-on the court and away from it. And much faster month. They're 11-0 at home and have won 26 straight regu­lar-season home games since losing to the Knicks 117-110 last February. 
"We're playing well, but we haven't hit our groove yet," Grant said. "The new guys are still learning the offense. When we hit our groove, the league better look out." 
Phil Jackson coached the Chicago Bulls to six champi­onships in the 1990s and the Lakers to three from 2000-02. He acknowledged this season's team has come together faster than he expected.

Nine l)f their victories have been by 15 or more points, and they bring a nine-game winning streak into Tuesday night's game against the New York Knicks. 
The Lakers are 3-0 against the reigning NBA champion San Antonio Spurs. They also col­lected a 22-point victory over an India.na Pacers team that was 14-:~ entering the game. 
The L1kers lost at Memphis, New Orleans and Detroit last closeness O'Neal 
brought up, Jackson smiled and said: ''I've noticed that Shaq has lost his nickname of Mr. Moody. That's a pleasure for us if players get along together. 
''I've been with teams who have had great on-and off­court rapport. I've been with teams who have had on-court rapport and no off-court rap­port. I'm enjoying watching the behavior on airplanes, on buses going to shootarounds." 
Malone, the NBA's second­leading career scorer, and Payton, a nine-time All-Star, joined the Lakers as under­priced free agents during the offseason. 

The Lakers were clearly in need, having been pretty much a two-man team before being eliminated by the Spurs in the Western Conference semifinals. 
Now, O'Neal and Bryant have plenty of support; including the emerging Devean George and Slava Medvedenko, along with Derek Fisher and newcomers Grant and Bryon Russell. 
When Malone and Payton joined the Lakers, both said a championship ring was the thing-something that's eluded them in their sterling careers. 
"''m having a great deal of fun," the 40-year-old Malone said. "The way guys are pulling for each other is very underrat­ed. It's kind of like a high school team. It's not the big things that are keeping my hunger for bas­ketball. It's the little things ­the closeness of the guys. I haven't had that since high school. That says a lot." 
Malone said he's been more impressed with O'Neal than anything else. 
''lie's not looking to score 30 points anymore," Malone said. "He's looking to win ball­games." 
Bryant leads the Lakers in scoring, but still isn't 100 per­cent healthy following offseason operations on his right shoulder and right knee. 
And he's still dealing with a rape charge that figures to go to trial next summer -something that's been a blip on the radar rather than the major distrac­tion many predicted. 
Payton, for one, is surprised the Lakers have done so well. He entered the season believing they wouldn't come together until early next year.

NCAA FOOTBALL 
College bowl system causes annual dilemma 

MLB 
Colon, Angels close to an agreement 

Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Bartolo Colon was close to an agreement with the Anaheim Angels, The Associated Press learned Monday, a contract that would give the team one of the top pitchers on the free-agent market. 
While neither Colon nor the Angels discussed the talks Monday, both Anaheim and the Chicago White Sox believed the right-hander was on the verge of a deal with Anaheim, said two baseball officials who were familiar with details of Colon's negotia­tions with the two teams. The pair spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
Anaheim offered a $48 mil­lion, four-year contract, one of the officials said. Once a pre­liminary agreement is reached, the right-hander still must pass a physical. 
Colon's agent, Mitch Frankel, did not return sever­al telephone calls from The Associated Press. Angels gen­eral manager Bill Stoneman refused to confirm or deny talks. 
"We've been more active 
this offseason than last," Stoneman said. "We're still trying to get some other things done. In terms of what they are, we're only going to comment on that stuff once we do have something that we announce publicly." 
The Angels could be dealing again if the Alex Hodriguez­Manny Hamirez trade goes through. Five-time All-Star shortstop Nomar Garciaparra would be out of a job, and it's believed the Red Sox could trade him to the Angels for a pitcher, possibly Jarrod Washburn, or second base­man Adam Kennedy. 
The Chicago White Sox badly wanted Colon back, with general manager Ken Williams offering a three-year contract worth a reported $36 million -the largest ever for a White Sox pitcher. But Colon rejected the offer in October. 
Though the White Sox offered Colon arbitration Sunday night, Williams seemed resigned Monday to losing the 20-game winner. Asked if he was still negotiat­ing with Colon, Williams said no, but didn't rule out the pos­sibility. 
Associated Press 
The best team in the land? Nobody will know for sure this season. 
What if the winner of the Rose Bowl could play the winner of the Sugar Bowl a week after those big games? Oklahoma vs. Southern California would be a dandy. So would LSU vs. USC. Of course, if Michigan slipped in with its two losses, some folks might be upset, though nobody could say the Wolverines went through the back door. 
A one-game playofl' is one of a handful of solutions that have 11oated around for years in an attempt to crown a true champi­on out of one of the most contro­versial. some say antiquated, concoctions in sporl'i -the col­lege bowl system. 
"We have this conversation every year," Texas coach Mack Brown said. "Unless we change the system, we'll have this con­versation every year." 
The system that gives us No. 1 USC vs. No. 4 Michigan in the Hose Bowl and No. 2 LSU vs. No. 3 Oklahoma in the supposed title game, the Sugar Bowl, is in place for at least two more sea­sons. 
Some tweaking is surely in order. But wholesale changes almost certainly aren't. In fact, while many vocal fans might be irute, at least one expert believes the key decision-makers ­coaches, athletic directors, school presidents -probably will stick with something close to the status quo even when the current contract is up. 
"The overwhelming majority want to keep the bowl system in some form," said Grant Teaff, executive director of the American Football Coaches Association. "Just like with the BCS, you're not going to serve every institution in every confer­ence, even with a playoff sys­tem." 
The most likely change in the contract would involve adding a championship game, or maybe two rounds of playoffs, after bowl season. It's a plan that has been debated quite often. 
Oregon athletic director Bill Moos made the most serious push in 2001, after the Ducks got bypassed for the top bowl in favor of Nebraska, which had lost 62-36 to Colorado and didn't even play in the Big 12 title game. 
The pros for a post-bowl play­ofT: A tournament-style ending would leave less room for debate. For instance, if Oklahoma and Southern Cal each won its bowl game, then played a week later, there would be little doubt about who the real champion was. 
Cons: It adds an extra week of football, something school presi­dents aren't thrilled about. And would fans really pay to go to the Rose Bowl one week, then take another trip for the champi­onship game the next? 
A more radical change would be taking 16 top teams and throwing them into a big tourna­ment, a Ia basketball's March Madness. 
"There needs to be a big play­off," said Texas Tech's Mike Leach, a member of the minority of coaches who would like to see a tournament. "We would do away with putting all this fool-Southern Cal in the Rose Bowl, the winner of the Sugar Bowl will be crowned the champion in both The Associated Press and the coaches' polls because only one team will be left with one loss. 
But if Southern Cal wins, there's a good chance of a split. Coaches don't even vote for the top team in their poll because of an agreement that automatically awards their trophy to the win­ner of the BCS title game. 
ishness into the computer and hoping somehow it is going to come up with the right thing." 
Proponents of that idea say it makes more sense to decide a football title the same way as almost every other champi­onship in major sports. No doubt, it wouldn't reward excel­lence in the regular season as much, but nobody disputes the legitimacy of an NCAA basket­ball champion that gets hot in March and wins it all. 
Critics, however, claim a full­fledged playoff would gut the bowl system as we know it. And no matter how many teams reach the playoffs, there always will be a debate about the third­or ninth-or 17th-ranked team­the frrst one that gets left out. 
Much of how this season will be remembered rides on Michigan, the only team in the Rose-Sugar pairings with more than one loss. 
If Michigan can upset

Serena Williams may sign with Nike 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Serena Williams is close to signing an endorsement contract with Nike, two tennis sources told The Associated Press on Monday, a deal that could be the richest for a female ath­lete in history. 
The multiyear agreement would include royalties and performance bonuses for win­ning Grand Slam tourna­ments or reach-pulled out of every tourna­ment the rest of the year and finished 2003 at No. 3. 

She expects to return to action by the Australian Open. 
Her contract with Puma expired early this year. 
ESPN .com, citing unidenti­fied sources, reported that Williams and Nike agreed to a five-year deal plus a three­year extension that could be worth as much as $55 million. Sports Business Journal reported it is a lifetime 

stakes football. 

Their offensive line was over­whelmed by the Ravens, who sacked Jon Kitna six times and forced two fumbles and two interceptions. Receiver Chad Johnson was double-teamed and didn't catch a pass until the fourth quarter, when the Ravens were pulling away. 
As the game wound down, some Baltimore fans chanted, "Same old Bengals." Bengals coach Marvin Lewis took note and took exception, saying the fans' conclusion was all wrong. 
"We've got a chance to prove that this week," Lewis said. 
He agreed with the assess­ment of several players that the Bengals seemed to be trying too hard during their most impor­tant game in 13 years. Cincinnati hasn't been to the playoffs or had a winning record since 1990. 
"That's what these guys work for, to play games that mean something in December," Lewis said. "You'd like to be doing it with a three-game cushion, but we're not. We don't need to press. We pressed yesterday. 
"We've felt that level of inten­sity, but when you get behind in the game, you have to realize that the only way to get out of this funk is to do things the right way. Don't try to invent plays and do things like that. It's just part of maturity." 
The Bengals have two home games left -against San Francisco on Sunday and against Cleveland -and one in St. Louis on Dec. 21 that will be significant for both teams. 
"At a crucial point in the sea­son, you're going to have to go on the road and play a team that has the same thing on the line that you do," Simmons said. "Hopefully we learned what it's going to take to go into their house and steal a ballgame from them.

could make the contract worth more than the deal with Reebok that Williams' older sister Venus signed in December 2000 after winning Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. That was worth up to $40 million over five years.

If Williams 

does sign with Nike, the company would benefit from her non-tennis interests that have made her more visible, including clothes designing and acting. 
With help from the William Morris agency, she landed roles in a movie called "Beauty Shop" and the Showtime drama "Street Time." 
A 2002 survey of the public relations industry deemed Williams and Tiger Woods the most attractive spokespersons among athletes.

Bengals still eye playoff berth 
Associated Press 

CINCINNATI -The Bengals' worst drubbing since the season opener knocked them out of first place but not out of the playoff chase. They've still got a chance to make it and enough confi­dence to predict it. 
A team that's come so far can't imagine an unhappy ending. 
"With three games left, there's a lot of meaningful football to be played," linebacker Brian Simmons said Monday. "At this point, it's going to be who takes full advantage of those three games they have left." 
The Bengals (7 -6) had a chance to take the equivalent of a two-game lead by beating Baltimore on Sunday. Instead, the Ravens (8-5) pushed them around in a 31-13 defeat that was the Bengals' worst since a season-opening 30-10 loss to Denver. 
Now, the Bengals have to plan on winning their final three games and hope the Ravens or one of the other wild-~ard candi­dates fades down the stretch. Given the way their season has gone, the Bengals expect it. 
"I know everybody's probably going to jump off the bandwag­on," right tackle Willie Anderson said following the game. "But I'll tell you this: We're getting to the playoffs. I guarantee that we'll get to the playoffs. I said it, and remember I said it. We're going to do it." 
With a chance to make them­selves the odds-on favorite to win the AFC North, the Bengals looked like a team not quite ready for the pressure of high-
Mantle MVP award sells for $275,000 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK Mickey Mantle's 1957 MVP award sold for $275,000 Monday night in an auction of items belonging to the family of the late New York Yankees star. 
The hundreds of items ­including other awards, con­tracts and a prize watch ­were offered Monday at Madison Square Garden by the Guernsey's auction house. The items came from the collection of Mantle's widow and two sons. 
The family chose to auction the items to celebrate Mantle's career and "to share the great treasures and fine heritage with the millions who adored him," Guernsey's said in a release. 
The 1957 MVP award was the priciest of the 300 items, all of which sold, according to Kim Anello, of Nancy Seltzer and Associates, a public relations firm working for the auction house. 
Mantle's 1962 MVP award sold for $250,000, and his 1956 Silver Bat batting title award fetched $270,000. Mantle's Hall of Fame gold watch sold for $9,500. 
Also on sale were professional contracts signed by Mantle. His first one, which gave him a $1,150 bonus and $140 a month to play for the Independence (Mo.) Yankees in 1949, sold for $100,000. His last contract, with the New York Yankees in 1968 for $100,000, sold for $5,500. 
The total sale price, including an auction house commission on the items, would be released Tuesday, Anello said.

CLEVELAND -The St. Louis Rams are going back to the playoffs, and their high-potency offense didn't have very much to do with it. 
Aeneas Williams had two interceptions -the first for a 46-yard touchdown -in the final 1 :04 of the first half and the Rams clinched an NFC postseason berth, holding on for a 26-20 win Monday night over the Cleveland Browns. 
Williams' two picks enabled the Rams (10-3) to score 14 points in a 42-sec­ond span at the end of the first half, giving St. Louis a 23-7 lead. 
"All I can say is, he's Aeneas," Rams coach Mike Martz said. "He sets the standard for all of us. He makes the plays in clutch situations.n 
Jeff Wilkins kicked four field goals -26, 28, 29 and 3 7 yards -for the Rams, who won their fifth straight game and advanced to the playoffs for the fourth time in five years. 
"This is just one step," Rams wide receiver Dane Looker said. "We're excited but not overly excited. n

IN BRIEF 

Derrick Strait named best 
defensive player 
CHARLOTTE, North Carolina ­After helping lead his team to a berth in the Sugar Bowl. Oklahoma corner­back Derrick Strait on Monday was awarded the Bronko Nagurski Award as the best aU-around defensive play­er in college football. 
Strait became the second Oklahoma defensive back in the last three seasons to win the award. In 2001, safety Roy Williams won the honor, which is presented annually by the Football Writers Association of American and the Charlotte Touchdown Club. 
The 5-11, 195-pound Strait record­ed 69 tackles -the third-most for the 12-1 Sooners -and intercepted three passes for 127 return yards. The senior set Oklahoma career records for passes broken up, career starts and interception return yards. 
"You see very few players who have the impact on the game like he does," Sooners coach Bob Stoops said. "I in the NFC West, had to withstand a valiant come­back by the Browns (4-9), who were making their first regula~season appearance on "Monday Night Football" since 1995. 
Quarterback Tim Couch rallied Cleveland, but was stripped of the ball by Rams defensive end Brian Young on fourth down with 
1:51 left, and St. Louis ran out the clock. 
Marshall Faulk rushed for more than 100 yards for the fourth straight game, picking up 102 yards on 24 carries. 
Couch went 6-for-9 for 98 yards and threw a 28-yard TO pass to Quincy Morgan after replacing Kelly Holcomb, whose two inter­ceptions just before half­time doomed the Browns. 

"To give up 14 points like that is unforgivable," said Holcomb, whose first shot at being a starting quarter­back has not gone well. "It's all on me. You can't make mistakes like that. They got 14 points ofT me." 
Holcomb. whose 2-yard TD pass in the first quarter gave Cleveland a 7-3 lead. was benched with 17 sec­onds left in the first half. 
Following the game, Browns coach Butch Davis refused to answer ques­tions about his quarterback situation. 
have never seen a guy do what he does." 
In the Sooners' 65-13 thrashing of rival Texas on October 11, Strait had 11 tackles, broke up three passes, recovered two fumbles and had an early interception. He also had an interception and 97-yard return against Texas Tech on November 22. 
U.S. athletes might not wear traditional corors 
RALEIGH, N.C. As a precaution, American track and field athletes at the 2004 Athens Olympics might be discouraged from wearing red, white and blue or anything with "USA" when they are not competing. 
"For security reasons, if that's the way they want to go, that's what we'll do," said U.S. men's track coach George Williams, also track and field coach at St. Augustine's College in Raleigh. 
USA Track & Field spokeswoman Jill Geer said Monday that "off-track uniform issues are governed by the U.S. Olympic Committee." 
"Coaching and managerial teams always look at a number of security issues before any international com­petition, including clothing," Geer said. "For the 2004 Games. the Olympic team is within the oversight of the U.S. Olympic Committee." 
Greece is spending more than $750 million for security -the biggest security budget in Olympic history and more than 3 1/2 times as much as what was spent for the 2000 Sydney Games. Authorities plan to deploy about 50,000 security person­nel -including 16,000 soldiers ­during the games. 
Williams said track officials have suggested ways to lower the profile of American athletes around Athens. 
"They said it would be good if we low-keyed it," he said. But he added: "Some of us are going to look American. We're going to have our Bermuda shorts on and our white tennis shoes. It's going to be hard to do."

Women's ice hockey splits games 
Special to The Observer 
"We had a great weekend and should have had two wins because we totally dominated the play in all six periods. But were 1 and 1 on the weekend. That's right, our first win." With those words, captain Tori Blainey summed up both the frustration of a near sweep and the exhilaration of win­ning as Notre Dame's women's ice hockey club split a pair of games against Oakland U. this weekend. The Irish dropped the Saturday contest 2-1 before rebounding Sunday for a 3-2 victory. 
On Friday. Oakland's Lauren Brick scored the lone goal in the first period with an assist from Melissa Orr. Just 3:30 into the second period, the lead was extended to 2-0 on a goal from Kristin Czarnecki, assisted by Daniela Marrocco. The Irish answered with a goal at 11:37 of the period as Julia LaPointe found the back of the net. with assists credited to Kate Abowd and Karrie Koski. The Irish wasted several excel­lent scoring opportunities and were unable to reward an excellent performance by Becca Frigy making her debut in goal. 
Saturday found a resilient and determined Irish squad strike quickly as Annemarie Kennedy ripped the nets at 
11:10 of the first period and Megan Mattia rifled home a shot just 22 seconds later for a two goal lead.

The Notre Dame bowling club's men's squad competed this weekend in a pair of American Heartland Bowling Conference tournaments. fin­ishing 14th on Saturday and held 13th on Sunday in a 19 team field before having to leave the competition early to return for classes. 
On Saturday, the Irish posted a five man team average of 948 for six games, the best showing by the Irish in recent years. Daniel Martin posted a 217 average, highlighted by a 265 game to lead the Irish. Jim Talamao rolled a 244 game en route to a 202 aver­age. Van Koppersmith and captain Jason Raver earned high games of 226 and 217 while averaging 190 and 188 respectively. Vance McClenton just missed a 200 game, with a high score of 199 as he aver­aged 169.

Happy Birthday: Focus on your goals, take charge of your life, and don't let anyone stand in your way this year. You have too much on the line this year to let small mailers slow you down.

Don't Jet negative friends or relatives give you doubts about your abilities or your self-worth. 5 stars GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Don't feel obligated to pay for others' mistakes. Someone you live with will create problems for you. Distance yourself from personal stress and concentrate on money-making investments. 3 stars CANCER (June 21-July 22): You will have to control your anger. You've been burning the candle at both ends. and your attitude regarding the lack of support and help you are gelling is resulting in friction. 3 stars LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Insincere gestures should be expected when dealing with friends or relatives. Keep your thoughts to yourself if you want to avoid discord. Travel and shopping are your best bets. 3 stars VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Financial problems will escalate. Don't spend money on entertainment or unnecessary items. Losses will occur if you gel involved in questionable investments. 5 stars LIBRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): You can make financial gains through conservative investments or property purchases.

FOOTBALL 
Disappointing season may affect recruiting 
By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 

The frustration dissipated a bit with three straight wins in the month of November, but the Notre Dame football team is now searching for answers to turn around a 5-7 losing season after a 38-12 Joss to Syracuse in its final game. That search has already begun in the recruiting process, as coach Tyrone Willingham's job gets even harder. 
Last season, Willingham rode the wave of momentum from a ten-win season into the month of January. He announced his first recruiting class as Irish head coach, a group ranked top-five in the country behind only programs like rival USC. Notre Dame secured commitments from top prospects such as true fresh­men starters quarterback Brady Quinn, offensive tackle Ryan Harris and defensive end Victor Abiamiri. 
The question now is, will the second go-around be just as successful? 
"I think we are hanging in there," Willingham said. "I think we have got some key players that if we can get the right ones to fall, it will help us." 

Notre Dame has received seven verbal commitments, as no official commitments can be made until the first week of February after bowl games have been played. 
Its most recent recruit is Chicago area cornerback prospect Tregg Duerson. The son of a former Notre Dame football player, Duerson stands at 5-10, 170 pounds and runs a 4.5 60-yard dash. He also played running back at Loyola Academy, where he carried the ball this season 184 times for 1,200 yards. 
Recruiting analysts said Willingham is bringing Duerson in as a defensive back with possibilities of contribut­ing on special teams. 
"We've got to have continued growth and improvement in every area," the coach said. 
Willingham and the Irish struggled this season with the meshing of recruits of two sys­tems -that of former coach

Only 200 IUfans will be allowed into a pre-game meeting 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 

If students thought Indiana University was planning a pep rally in the north dome of the Joyce Center before the Notre Dame-Indiana basketball game Wednesday, they might want to think again. 
A Notre Dame official said Indiana fans will have a gather~ ing in a partitioned section of the Joyce Center, but the gath­ering is similar to other pre­game events the University allows visiting alumni organiza­tions to hold before basketball games. 
The only reason it is in the north dome of the Joyce Center is because another group had already booked the Monogram Room -the room on the sec­ond floor of the Joyce Center where visiting teams' fans nor­mally congregate -for the evening. 
MEN'S BASKETBALL 
IU gathering not a pep rally 

Indiana will have a pre-game meeting before their contest against Torln Francis (above) and the Irish Wednesday. 
"It's not an IU pep rally," Notre Dame sports information director Bernie Cafarelli said. 
Cafarelli added that Notre Dame typically gives any alum­ni club from any visiting school a place to hold a pre-game meeting, just as the Irish often receive a space to meet before games at other school's cam­puses. 
But Notre Dame will only allow up to 200 fans with tick­ets into the partioned area, said Cafarelli, and no Notre Dame students would be admitted. 
Several students, under the impression that Notre Dame was allowing an Indiana pep rally in the Joyce Center, were planning counter-rallies before the basketball game. 
"We don't need anything to transpire from this," Cafarelli said.
