of the midwest. In fact, most warm-blooded 
,.!!!!=======!!!!l!!!!l!!!!!!!!!!!~fiiiJI
mammals, save Santa and a few fervent ski 
buffs, spend the annual South Bend Ice Age 
cursing the slush and snow, complaining about t-----, 
the sub-zero temps and warding off the colds 
and coughs the season invariably brings. 
But while most students judge the arrival of 

winter by the calendar, the first snowfall or the 
number of shopping days til Christmas, I have 
a much more accurate predictor: the boxelder 
bugs. Their arrival is a sure sign the hazy shade 
of winter is just around the corner. 
For those of you not fortunate enough to be 

familiar with this rare breed of bug, these little 
creatures infest many midwest homes during 
the winter months. Any house located even 
remotely near a "boxelder tree" is subject to 
the ungodly insects. Supposedly harmless, the · boxelders' trademark is a thin, red "W" they sport on the back of their jet black coats. Some people claim the "winter worsts" in­clude frostbitten toes, runny noses and cold car 
engines. I beg to differ. In my book, boxelders are more detestable than mile-high snow drifts or soggy long johns any day. 
How do I hate boxelder bugs? Let me count the ways ... 
First of all, boxelders are quite possibly the world's rudest house guests. From the moment of invasion, they make themselves right at home in YOUR home. They apparently have no qualms about barging in on their inadvertent hosts unannounced. And once they've kicked back and settled in, they're around to stay. 
Boxelders aren't exactly skilled in the art of moderation, either. God knows, these bugs don't casually drop in one by one. Instead, they flock to their yearly vacation spot in droves. 
And their travel mates aren't confined to im­mediate blood relatives by a long shot. On the contrary, when they come to visit, they bring along each and every relative they have to share the wealth (yours, that is). 
The entire extended family packs up and tags along --in-laws, great aunts, fifth cousins thrice removed, you name it. I swear my house has become the site of the annual Boxelder Bug Family Reunion. Every winter for as far back as I can remember, good ol' 915 Victoria Place has teemed with more unwanted guests than a Fort Lauderdale "Day's Inn" during Spring Break. 
And talk about over-staying a welcome! Boxelders are notorious for overstepping all bounds of social propriety. As any good guest knows, spending a night or two's fine, and a week's pushing it, but AN ENTIRE SEASON? Faux pas. Faux pas. 
These bugs were out to lunch when they passed out manners at the pearly gates. 
Admittedly, boxelder bugs aren't the most dangerous insects in the world. To my knowl­edge, they don't bite, sting, scratch or marne. But they're so worthless! They serve absolutely no meaningful purpose in llife. They're simply, well, THERE. As far as I'm concerned, they're the dredges of the insect world, the wisdom teeth of the animal kingdom, so to speak. 
Now, I'm sure everyone out there doesn't hold boxelders in such low esteem. My psychological allergy to these bugs is undoubtedly unique. I'm probably the only person around who's on a first-name basis with the exterminator. I even know his phone number by heart. 
But even though boxeldE!r buffs may call me heartless, cruel and cold, I'll stick to my guns. Give me Raid or give me death.

North's trial set back on track 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON---Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial ap­peared to get back on track Wednesday as prosecutors, after meeting with Justice De­partment lawyers, issued guidelines designed to guard against disclosures of classi­fied material by North. 
In a four-paragraph state­ment, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said he will, if necessary, seek an affidavit from Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to prevent the dis­closure of classified informa­tion which could harm national security. 
The statement was worked out with Thornburgh, who said it will permit national security secrets to be protected. 
Hours after the announce­ment, Thornburgh asked the Supreme Court to lift the stay that has delayed the start of the trial and said he will also drop his appeal of rulings by U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell on secrecy issues. Chief Justice William Rehnquist had issued the administrative stay at the Justice Department's re­quest. 
Walsh's statement was in response to an order issued Tuesday by Gesell, who told Thornburgh to stay out of the North case, barring the attor­ney general from filing af­fidavits in "bits and pieces" in response to individual docu­ments or testimony planned by North. Gesell said Walsh "will be recognized as responsible for the day-to-day conduct of this case." 
North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan, was not immediately available for comment. 
Thornburgh, in a statement, endorsed the plan. "The inde­pendent counsel's planned im­plementation of yesterday's district court order provides the government with the sub­stance of what we have been seeking for the past week." 
Walsh's statementalso says Walsh will notify Thornburgh if evidence in any of eight spe­cific categories is to be intro­duced. 
Those categories include in­formation indentifying under­cover CIA officers, and infor­mation revealing locations of CIA stations and U.S. covert activities other than paramilitary support for the Contras. Also included are details about specific CIA operations with foreign intelli­gence services and govern­ment officials as well as information identifying by name or description who are CIA assets or liason officials.

Discipline discussed at Judiciary Council 
By BRADLEY GALKO 
Staff Reporter 

Reducing the anxiety in­
volved with the University's 
disciplinary process was the 
primary objective of a Judicial 
Council meeting Wednesday. 
Ann Firth, director of 
residence life, told the mem­
bers of the council that a 
"clearer understanding of how 
the system works...(would 
help) to reduce some of that 
anxiety." 

She also stressed to the coun­
cil, which is comprised of dorm 
judicial board coordinators, 
that, "You are important 
resource people for the resi­
dents of your hall." It is impor­
tant, she added, that "you have 
accurate information for 
them." 

Arty Feles, judicial coordin­ator for the University, ex­plained, "We needed a way to disseminate information to the students." He invited Firth, Elizabeth Pawlicki and Patrick Doran, assistant direc­tors of residence life, to ad­dress the council as a way of accomplishing this. 
The speakers wanted to dis­pel the perception of their of­fice as being merely givers of punishment. "We...do ad­dress a wrongdoing... but we (also) try to help the individ­ual," said Doran. 
"The 'iron fist' --it's not true," added Feles, "They do a lot more than the judicial af­fairs part of it." 
"One of their (students') basic rights," Doran told the 
council, "is that they be treated 
fairly." He added, however, 
"We feel our students need be 
held accountable for their ac­
tions." 

The speakers continued to 
explain the judicial process by 
telling the council that rule in­
fractions are dealt with in one 
of two ways: conference or ad­
ministrative hearing. 

The decision between confer­
ence or hearing "depends on 
the severity of the potential out­
come," said Doran, "When the 
stakes are higher. . . there 
should be more formality." 
A hearing, and other ele­
ments of the disciplinary 
process, were then re-enacted 
by the guest speakers and 
members of the council. 
An invitation to a hearing is not synonomous with an im­minent suspension, said Firth. "They (hearings) are riot for­gone conclusions," added Pawlicki, "We are serious about the presumption of in­nocence." 
Conferences, the more infor­mal of the two disciplinary procedures, are far more com­mon than hearings. Of 282 cases heard last semester, 87.2 percent were dealt with by con­ference to only 12.8 percent by formal hearing. 
The most common offenses that the Office of Residence Life was called upon to deal with included (from most to least common) intoxication, merchandising (e.g. illegal sale of unlicensed T -shirts) and off-campus complaints.

Lover of Rock Huclson awalrded $14.5 million 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES--Rock Hud­son was guilty of "outrageous conduct" in concealing that he had AIDS from his homosexual lover, a jury ruled Wednesday in awarding the lover $14.5 mil­lion from the late actor's es­tate. 
Marc Christian, 35, won $3.5 million more than he had sought in the case, regarded as a precedent-setting action and watched closely by lawyers. No similar case has had a like result when the plaintiff has not developed AIDS. 
Hudson, the handsome Holly­wood leading man who kept his homosexuality a secret from the public, died Oct. 5, 1985 at age 58, a few months after his battle with AIDS became public knowledge. 
Christian, who smiled when the verdict was read, has con­sistently tested negative for the AIDS virus, but claimed he was entitled to compensation for the emotional distress he suf­fered in fear that he would develop the disease.

The handbook will offer a number of options for dealing with this issue of nontolerance, said Stamile. "We want it to be a comfortable situation." 
"Through the video, we hope to show the reasons why the Honor Code should be imple­mented," said Stamile. The idea of integrity and a sense of community are two reasons why the Honor Code is a good idea, said Stamile. 
The handbook will be essen­tial to faculty members, said Stamile. The committee hopes that in the classroom faculty and students will discuss honor and the ramifications of dis­honesty, said Stamile. 
"The handbook is a good tool for educating the entire Uni­versity community," said Stamile. With the handbook there will not be many different ways to interpret the Honor Code; the handbook creates a uniform document, Stamile said. 
The Honor Code is an experi­mental code and in 1991 the Academic Council will review the code, Williams said. The Academic Council is a group composed of faculty, students and administrators, said Ger-

lach. 
"I hope there is a referendum of the students. I would hate to see another decision from on top," Gerlach said. "The Honor Code must come from a con­sensus of the community." 
"It's imperative that we have an all.school vote," said Stamile. 
Gerlach said he hopes that there will be a vote and that the Academic Council will take the results in very high regard when making their decision. "I think we stand a good chance of winning (student approval for the Honor Code)," he said. 
The main reason that the video and handbook are neces­sary is that when the students vote, they can make an ed­ucated decision, said Stamile. Even if the Honor Code doesn't go through, if the votes are ed­ucated votes, the Committee's efforts were successful, said , , Stamile. 
Williams said that a survey may be just as good as a vote because in a survey the stu­dents can say "if yes, why yes; if no, why no." The Council would take the survey into con­sideration when making their decision, said Williams. 
"I think that there is a clear pattern that the more students understand the code, the more they think it's a good idea," said Williams. "The challenge is to educate."

tions, but does not allow him to proctor the exam" while at V.U. "the Honor System replaced the faculty proctored exams and calls for students to proctor each other." In essence, the only dif­ference is that, at Notre Dame, faculty members and teaching assistants have the practical option to make them­selves available for question clarifica­tion. Faculty and teaching assistants are not active proctors of the exams at all, nor are students acting as policemen. If each student upholds the notion of honor, if there is a basic level of trust between students within the community, and if the same trust is fostered between student and faculty members, there really should be no questions about proctoring. I believe that if it can be done in any community, Notre Dame should stand out as a shining example. 
Once again, I do appreciate your at­tempt to further the education of the student body concerning the Honor Code, yet I regret the fact that the ar­ticle of Feb. 14, while presenting a new perspective of comparison, probably succeeded in producing a few unneces­sary questions in the minds of many students.

Hesburgh library expands service 

Dear Editor: 
We are writing this letter to inform the graduate and undergraduate stu­dent body of the recent change in the Hesburgh Memorial Library's weekend hours as well as to solicit input for other possible future changes in the library schedule. 
Around the middle of last semester, as representatives of the Graduate Stu­dent Union and the undergraduate stu­dent government, we approached the library administration about the possi­bility of extending its hours. Specificaly we requested that they consider extend­ing their evening hours until 1 a.m. (presently 11:45 p.m.) and that the li­brary be opened at 10 a.m. instead of noon on Sundays. 
The library administration's response was positive, and, starting

Article distorts honor code 

Dear Editor: 
While I appreciate a free press and its ability to inform the community, I believe that the information it dissemi­nates should be correct, especially if it relates to topics of controversy. 
The Honor Code is debated back and forth by various members of the Notre Dame community. It is crucial that it be discussed and understood--correct­ly. On Feb. 14, an article by Maura Krause and Kelly Tuthill appeared that compared Notre Dame's Honor Code to those of Valparaiso University and the University of Virginia. While it is diffi­cult to compare our Honor Code to those of two schools whose codes are based on years of tradition and are not evolv­ing as ours certainly must, the expo­sure itself is appreciated. 
If our honor code is to be presented, however, it must be done so fairly. In our discussion of the Honor Code, I spoke with Miss Tuthill about the reasons for its implementation, specif­ically about the need for moral educa­tion and growth to complement the aca­demic, social, and spiritual growth we receive at Notre Dame, the importance of community living, and the absolute necessity of uniformity in dealing with cases of academic dishonesty. 
Upon reading the article, I was surprised to find that I was quoted as saying that the rules for each of the departmental honesty committees are different; this claim is far from true. As I have said, uniformity is a basic part of the Honor Code. Miss Tuthill and I spoke about the reasons that honesty committees remain within in­dividual departments and the inability for one centralized committee to exist at this time. The general procedures to be followed by each committee are indeed uniform and are outlined by the 1988-1989 Du Lac and the tenets of the Honor Code itself. Du Lac does not out­line Honor Code procedures specifi­cally because the Code is experimental and does not apply to the student body at large. 
I will only clarify one more point made in the article. It was mentioned that "Notre Dame's code allows for a professor. . . to remain in the testing room to answer any necessary ques­this semester, the library opens at 10 
a.m. on Sundays. 

Before any other changes can be im­plemented it is necessary to determine whether they are needed. In order to collect this information undergraduate and graduate students are asked to please fill out and send in (via campus mail) the questionnaire that will ap­pear in The Observer today and Friday. Graduates are asked also to complete and send in the questionnaires in the February and March issues of Grad News, the GSU Newsletter. 
Student input will be of decisive im­portance in the planning of library hours for next semester. Your coopera­tion will not only be greatly appreciated but will also make possible an improve­ment in the library services provided to all services.

Bengal poster betrays cause 
Dear Editor: 

After witnessing three years of excel­lent posters advertising the University of Notre Dame Bengal Bouts, we feel there are many compelling reasons for disappointment in this year's effort. For those unfamiliar with the Bengal Bouts, it is a 59-year-old amateur boxing competition held in order to raise money for the poor and mal­nourished people of the country of Bangladesh (formerly Bengal). The theme of the Bouts, coined by founder Dominick J. "Nappy" Napolitano, is "Strong bodies fight that weak bodies may be nourished." This theme is lived out each year by 80-150 Notre Dame men, who spend weeks donating most of their spare time to learning the art of amateur boxing and to conditioning their bodies in preparation for this ex­tremely strenuous sport. As the recruit­ing posters say, "Everyone who fights is a champ--win, place, or show." 
This sentiment of "humble charity" on the part of so many involved with the Bouts has always been well ex­pressed by the Bengal Bouts poster. However, this year's poster, which showcases the officers of the Notre Dame Boxing Club, could not be any less expressive of the themes of this noble cause. The poster has the officers cutely posed and dressed in tuxedos with polka-dot ties. This "bigger-than­life" shot is surrounded by the names and individual accomplishments of an extremely small and select number of boxers. Appallingly, the print size that marks the dates of the Bouts and of Nappy's theme quote is so small that it cannot be read from a distance of more than 12 inches; it is in fact, smaller than the print that marks the names of the officers. Moreover, the 
poster itself leads one to believe that there are only a handful of winners, when the entire purpose of the Bouts ensures that everyone who participates is a champ because the hungry children of Bangladesh truly benefit. 
We wish to take nothing away from the achievements and contributions that these officers have made to the program. Yet the Bengal Bouts have graduated countless numbers of cham­pions, both in and out of the ring, who never participted in such an egotistical poster as this. Nappy himself, who is the greatest contributor to the Bengal Bouts, only appeared on the poster once, after his death in 1987. 
When a poster that should stir the hearts and spirits of the boxers and spectators looks more like an adver­tisement for a men's fashion show, clearly a mistake has been made.

Drug charges rock Oklahoma 
OKLAHOMA CITY--The University of Oklahoma foot­ball team, a perennial power accustomed to battling for na­tional championships, now is fighting for dignity during an outbreak of criminal allega­tions that won't seem to go away. 
Preliminary and detention hearings were scheduled today for starting quarterback Charles Thompson, who was arrested Monday night by FBI agents on a Jan. 26 federal com­plaint of selling cocaine to an undercover agent. 
Just last week, Thompson and Oklahoma placekicker 
R.D. Lashar told students at Jackson elementary school in Norman to avoid drugs, accor­ding to the Daily Oklahoman. 
"They feel betrayed," Dottie Caldwell, prinicipal of Jackson, said of the students. "They were lied to." 
The New York Post quoted Caldwell as saying: "He said that drugs can close the door on life's opportunities and that he was thankful to God for al­lowing him to heal (others by speaking out against it). 
"One child asked him if he was aware of any football players taking drugs," Caldwell told the Post. "His an­swer was open-ended, saying that he did not know of any." 
The governor of Oklahoma says he's disgusted. The other players say they're shocked. And the second largest news­paper in the state is calling for Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer to resign. 
"Nothing less than a new start under new leadership can restore confidence and pride in 
O.U. football. Nothing less, in fact, can save the University of Oklahoma from becoming ana­tional laughingstock," said a Tulsa World editorial in today's editions. 
Switzer listed the players who recently have been ar­rested and said: "Barry Swit­zer should resign because of what they did? No more than I think their mothers and fathers should go to prison to serve their sentences," Switzer told the Oklahoma News Network. 
Media, friends and spec­tators crowded into the court­room Tuesday. Thompson, wearing an orange jumpsuit, was attentive and quiet. He looked at his mother briefly.

IH hockey teams fight for last playoff spots 
By ARTHUR GOLLWITZER Sports Writer The Interhall hockey playoff picture is becoming clearer by the week. The Gold division race has been narrowed to three teams and one big game. In the Blue division, the situation is a bit more complex. Since last Thursday night, Grace and Dillon tied 2-2, as did Off-Campus and Morrissey. In the second game, Morrissey led 2-1, but Off-Campus defen­seman Brendan Max found the net with a slapshot from the point to tie the game. In the game's final minutes, a controversial call eliminated a potential winning goal by Morrissey. Apparently, the Manor had too many men on the ice. Grace then defeated Morris­sey 7-4 Monday night. In the Blue division, Pangborn skated past Sorin 3-1, while Zahm iced Sorin 8-2 and also topped Cavanaugh by a 4-2 score. In its victory over Cavanaugh Monday night, Zahm had only nine players in uniform. Captain Jay Hiniker had nothing but praise for his team. 
"The team played really well as a whole," Hiniker said. 
"There were a couple of early goals scored, and we really did not play that well," said Cavanaugh captain Chris Sullivan, whose squad fell to 3-2 on the season. "We got beaten to the puck." 
These results leave Off­Campus on top of the Gold divi­sion with a record of 4-0-1. Grace is also 4-0-1 and Dillon has a 3-1-1 mark. 
Next week Grace and Off­Campus meet in a game that will decide Dillon's fate. If Grace loses, Dillon's playoff hopes remain alive. There would be a single-game playoff rematch between Dillon and Grace. 
The Blue division playoff sit­uation is dependent upon the upcoming matchup between Alumni and Stanford. Cavanaugh and Zahm are still clinging to slim playoff hopes. 
If Stanford wins next week's confrontation, then Alumni and Stanford get the two playoff spots. If Stanford loses, there could be be a three-way tie be­tween Stanford, Cavanaugh, and Zahm. 
The playoff team would be picked on the basis of goal dif­ferential.

Swim teams ready for MCC meet 
By MARY GARINO Sports Writer 
The men's and women's swim teams travel to St. Louis to compete in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference Cham­pionships on February 16-18. 
Both teams captured first place at the meet last year and are favored to repeat again in 1989. 
The men's team had an easy vicory last year, winning by 200 points over the second place team, Evansville. Evansville, which dominated the MCC Championships before Notre 
underwent earlier in the year 
was aimed at the championship 
meets. 
"We have trained well for a 

long time," Welsh said. "Also, 
we have advanced our perfor­
mance level from week to 
week, so we're prepared to 
race well." 
Before the final events, there 

will be qualifying races, and 
one of Welsh's main concerns 
is qualifying as many people as 
possible. 
"We have to qualify the right 

people in the right events," he 
said. "This is a meet that re­
quires that the winner be deep 
enough to score in all12 events. 
Everybody must contribute in 
order for us to defend our 
title." 
The women's team won by a close score last year, also over Evansville, but the Irish swim­mers might have an easier time this year. Evansville will be their main competition, and they lost several key swim­mers to graduation since 1988. Also, the Irish will have two more divers than last season, which could be a crucial factor. 
Neither of the Notre Dame 

teams will be competing at full 
strength. All of the juniors are 
remaining in South Bend for 
Junior Parents Weekend. In 
fact, there will be very few up­
perclassmen participating. 
The women's team will have 
only two seniors, and the rest 
are sophomores and freshmen. 
"The responsibility is on the 

sophomore class, basically," 
said Welsh. "This is a risk we 
take that makes the challenge 
more exciting." 
A key absence for the wo­men's team is freshman Katie Pamenter, who has been a leading scorer far the Irish this past season. Pamenter has a rotator cuff injury and will not swim. Brian Vogel, the co­capitan of the men's team, is also injured, but Welsh says he will compete. 
The main goal for the Irish will be to swim well, according to Welsh. 
"More important than win­ning is that we swim our best times ever and that everyone scores," he said. "Our satisfac­
tion depends on that, and we're confident that if we do swim well, everything will come out alright."

The Green Wave, who downed Keenan in the first round, was led by Paul Fulling and Chris Rigter. Fulling took control of Fisher's offense throughout the entire game. The 5-11 shooting guard slashed his way to 24 points. Rigter added 10 points to the suprising victory. On the defensive end for the Green Wave, Sean Kriebel was the intimidator down the stretch.

The Notre Dame hockey team, led by captain Matt Han­zel, showered buckets of goals on Lake Forest goalies Steve Collins and Dan Vacco Wednes­day night as the Irish trounced the Foresters 7-2. Hanzel scored a hat-trick, including the first and last goals of a five­goal blast in the second period. 
"We created scoring oppor­tunites tonight," said Irish head coach Ric Schafer. "Too often this year when we worked hard, we couldn't convert. Tonight, it paid off." 
It looked like the Irish (10-25­

Badin upsets PW in first round of playoffs 
By KEN TYSIAC Sports Writer 
Badin upset highly-regarded Pasquerilla West in overtime Monday night to highlight the first round of the women's In­terhall basketball playoffs. 
Breen-Phillips and Lewis also won their first contests in the double-elimination tourna­ment and advanced in the win­ner's bracket. 
Ten first-half points by cen­ter Babs Broemmel staked Badin to an 18-14 halftime lead over P.W., but the stingy full court press employed by P.W. put them back in the game in the second half. With the score tied and 20 seconds left in regulation, the teams ex­changed traveling violations to send the game into overtime.

Learning is a great experience, and given the atmo­sphere at the Joyce ACC on recent weeknights, it's no wonder I've had so much fun. 
On these selected weeknights around 8 p.m., it's hard to tell the difference between the South Dome and the fourth floor of the library (I'll give you a hint: you can find plenty of empty seats in the South Dome).

GIVen the atmosphere, educational opportunities have been plentiful during recent Notre Dame basketball games. Apparently most students d(]J not take advantage of these wonderful opportunities, so this phenomenon will be described through a familiar form. Remember, March madness (a.k.a. advance registration) is coming up soon, so clip and save! SOC :no Sociology of Ticket Usage: Study trends among the haves, the have-nots, and the haves-but-can't-get-rid­ofs, with a special emphasis on empty bleacher sections. PSYCH 334 Psychology of the Cheering(?) Student: Dis­cover why cheering is allowed only in the final five minutes of close games. Examine the reasoning behind the loud moans every time Keith Tower heads to the scorer's table, which answers the question, "Do students believe they can manipulate Digger's psyche?" PSYCH 334L Motivation of the Cheering(?) Student: Mon­itor student response to Digger's "thumbs up" signal and to his "Where's the sixth man?" beratings in the paper. Also includes analysis of season ticket sale data. COTH 112 Budget Choreography: Learn the Notre Dame cheerleader-sanctioned method of app1lying the exact same limited number of hip thrusts, chest expansions (for males) and assorted arm movements to randomly selected musical scores ranging from the sacred fight song to the Fat Boys' "Wipe Out." AMST 323 Culture of Wagering ( checkmarked): A growing field among Notre Dame males, experience students cheering for the opposing teams, and examine how the "power of the point spread" makes Tim Crawford a very popular player and Keith (2-of-16) Adkins an unpopular player in this culture. Crosslisted with MATH 323 Proba­bility. See Alumni Hall for checkmark forms. 
What a bargain--for only $77, experiences in psychology, sociology and COQlmunications abound. Oh yeah, you can watch some pretty good basketball too, but don't tell 
anyone. '
