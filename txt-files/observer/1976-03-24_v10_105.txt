Mardi Gras chalks up record profits 
by Matt Kane Staff Reporter 

The 1976 Mardi Gras Committee released its financial report yester­day showing the greatest profit in Mardi Gras history. Tho. final !igurc, $28,401.53, surpassed the record of $22.118.13 set in 1968 and last year's total of $22,029. 
Financial Director John Hedges said, ''This year's results indicate a sharply increased profit ratio, as well as an outstanding improve­ment in total profit." 
Hedges was surprised by the succes·s of this year's Mardi Gras because of the decrease in atten­dance. "Because attendance was 
down  from  previous  years  I  was  
worried."  he  said,  "yet  we  still  
came out ahead."

constitution was the first order of business and was approved quick­ly. A last-minute amendment was adopted charging the Executive Coordinator with overseeing An Tostal funds. 
The constitution was written primarily to give the HPC more continuity from year to year to eliminate confusion over its pur­pose and procedures. 
The constitution now goes to each hall for final approval. 
In other business the HPC organized two committees to write surveys. One survey will canvass student opinion of the Observer. The other survey is to see if students favor allowing off campus students to play in their former hall's interhall teams. 
The HPC also agreed to elect a sophomore and non-member to its SLC seat. Student Body President Ed Byrne urged the council to elect a sophomore who would serve a two year term to give the student representation on the SLC more continuity. The HPC is now accepting applications from any sophomore of freshman interested in serving on the SLC as the HPC representative. 
HPC Chairman Elton Johnson announced that April is the dead­line for hall to take the rest of their allotment out of the Student Body Treasury. After this date the remaining amount will be pooled in a general fund and the council will then redistribute the money. 
A spokeswoman for the SLC came to urge the HPC members to start hall fellows programs in their halls. A hall fellow is a faculty member who attends hall social activities. The purpose of having a hall fellow is to increase faculty and student contact.

Emotion is fine. But one must consider the results of his actions. The temperance movement was based upon a belief that sounded true. But its proponents failed to note that it was unacceptable to most people. If aboriton is indeed outlawed what would be the consequences? Would this stop women from getting abortions? Abortion has been legalized only in the last few years but in the time when it was not legal. it still did take place. And it still sould if it were banned again. But instead of being done in clean hospital rooms with nearly 1002 safety, abortions would be done in dirty back rooms with rusty scalpels by illiterate personnel. As it is now. abortions are safe and a matter of choice, not a matter of requirement. If outlawed, the only result would be much misery and death. 
It is therefore my view that abortion should be legalized. Those whose personal beliefs or religion are against th is practice will not be criticized for not participating. But similarly one person's moral values can not be imposed upon another. 
Abortion is an issue that splits this nation today. It is a moral issue. Therefore it should not be restrained. Rather, it should be up to the individual whether or not she wishes to use it. No one would be forced to go through the process. but it would be there if a woman wishes to use it. After all, she has to carry the child. The

Without strel·tlamps or moon we were left in almost total darkness. I pawed the air scarchibng for my mother's hand. "Say something again:· I can't find you in the darkness!" I finally found her hand and virtually dragged her down the hallway. Later I discovered 1 hat she had been hanging back in an effort to locate Kathleen. Since my feet were bare (I had not taken the time to put on shoes or bathrobe yet) it was fortunate that the huge gtass window thitt borders part of the hall had not shattered.

When at last Kathleen and Hector emerged from the house with Lisa, we all piled into the little Volkswagen and Hector backed it out into the street. To Kathleen's horror. Hector decided to go back into the house. On the way out, he had noticed that a large bottle of vc~y potent poison (used for ridding plants of certain insects) had been ~mashed on the floor near the kitchen. Its toxic fumes were spreading to all the rooms in the house. Hector took a flashlight, donned a gasmask and reentered the black house which the dim starlight did not penetrate. We strained to sec the ~low_ of his flashlight through some shrubbc j which blocked our view of the doorway. Minutes (1asscd...the car began to tremble, Kathleen

Kathleen became increasingly concerned for his safety. More than half an hour later he tinally locked up the house and joined us in the car. We drove over o his ·parents' home and found everyone safe. Their house had withstood the (tuakc even better than Kathlt:cn and

The next several nights were -pent in the garden of Hector Senior's home. Other relatives gathered there as well. Cots. mattresses, blankets and makeshift tents decorated the lawn. Electricity was restored to our neighborhood late Wednesday night (Feb. 4th) and the water began to dribble hack the following day. but some parts of the city arc still suffering from the absence of one or both of those valuable commodities. 
Under t'ormal circumstances the water supply for Guatemala City is insufficient. . Cor~SC4l1Cnt~y. the .water is turned off entirely dunng ccr~am. hours of the day. In our area we arc lett Without water between 
the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 4:30 a.m. In some of the poorest districts the people do not receive water until very late at night. With buckets in hand, they must wait in long lines to benefit from the one. public, communal spigot. At the best of times the pressure is so low that you cannot expect to usc water simultaneously from two different sources in your home. If one person is already washing the dishes. another cannot take a shower; if the lawn is being watered. the washing machine cannot be run. Fortunately. a huge waterworks project is currf"ntlv under wav to remedy this situation in the ·future. Now, of course, in the aftermath of this national disaster, water has become more precious than gold. 
During the first couple days following the earthquake. over 400 seismic movements were recorded. Although none of the subsequent tremors could even be compared to the destructive force of the original quak· 
their tre4ueucy u1 recurrence and the general dread of another seismological catastrophe have set everyone's nerves on edge.

The sudden and repeated creaking of the house and rattling of windows have become a sickening. taunting ritual. Some people arc still sleeping outside for fear that a second 4uakc will be produced b~· the dis4uictcd earth; many, many more arc camped in yards. streets and empty lots because thcv have no homes to return to. 
The cpic~ntcr was located about 80 kilometers from the capital and registered at

Possibly 20.000 arc dc~d and many tZm·ns were co;nplctcly razed. The capital suffered severe oamage in certain areas (mostly downtown). but the greater portion of th~ city remained intact. Some of the oldest and most beautiful churches were destroyed. As might be expected: thieves have been taking advantage of damaged and unprotected homes. The police have !hrcatcncd to shoot such lawbreakers on sight! In some cases the robbers have even assembled into armed gangs, and many neighborhoods have organizcrl their own patrols (in a program apparently under the direction of the army) to protect property.

a peculiar mouie 
The Devil Is a Woman is a peculiar name for a movie. Indeed, it is a peculiar movie for it rejects any attempt to classify it as comedy or tragedy, parody or reality. 
The audience reaction last night would seem to point to comedy. The film essentially tells the story of the evil and cmelty of one woman. but it is an evil that is at the same time irrepressible and irresistible, attracting and repelling men, often destroying them. It cannot be taken too seriously, nor can it be ignored. Last night's audience laughed at the cruelty of Concha Perez, perhaps because they could not believe its excesses, perhaps because they didn't want to. 
If for no other reason, the movie is 
interestingbecause it provides an opportu­nity for Marlene Dietrich to play her favorite and most famous role, the callous, hP-artbreaking bitch with just a hint of vulnerability that is never really exploited. She doesn't take herself quite as seriously as she did in The Blue Angel, and well she shouldn't. But she can still be as devastating with a frown as with a smile, she can still tease the noblest of men as she flings her shawl over her shoulder, an_d she can still throw her head back and deliver a contemptuous laugh that would make the most honest heart sink. 
The film is set in turn-of-the-century Spain during the carnival week.. There is something mysteriously appropnate about the carnival atmosphere and the grotesque masks. but there is also an unsettling

and Hector) could not be explained in term~

And then there is Concha. She is as enigmatic as she is cruel and heartless, and she is a force so powerful that even she is incapable of controlling it. But if she and the other characters are caricatures and inspire laughter at times, they are like the caricatures in a political cartoon; regard­less of how funny they might often seem. there is always a strong underlying element of very sad truth.
