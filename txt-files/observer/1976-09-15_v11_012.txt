Drug offenders given one year probation 
Two of three Notre Dame stu­dents suspended last spring after their arrest for drug pos­session and dealing are now on a one-year court probation. The other student still awaits trial scheduled for January. All three are now attending other schools. 
Thomas Aynn and Michael Kohlmiller pleaded guilty this July to the lesser charge of possession while the state agreed to move that the count of de­livery of illegal substances be dropped. The court then sus­pended judgement and placed the two men on probation. 
"The court gave these kids a break by withholding judgement,'' Judge Norman Kopec, the pre­siding judge in both cases es­explained. Aynn and Kohlmiller were tried separately. "This means," he continued, "that they have not been technically con­victed.'' 
The third student, Christopher Cannon, has been granted a continuance and his trial is scheduled for January. The exact date has not been determined 
at this time. Cannon is reported to be attending Marquette Law School. He was unavailable for comment. 
Kohlmiller is now attending Cannon College in his hometown 
of Section Four of the Fair Cam­paign Practice Code, which states that a candidate will not offer to the public campaign material that is misleading or untrue. 
Lugar signed an agreement to abide by the standards of the Fair Campaign Practices Committee and returned it to the organization on May 2'6, 1976. The alleged violation concerns a television com­mercial being aired statewide. 
In an advertisement, Lugar claims to have been instrumental in bringing 8,000 jobs per 'year to Indianapolis during his eight-year term as mayor. His campaign headquarters said the figure is based on U.S. Department of Labor Statistics. 
In fact, only 47,600 new jobs were created during Lugar's may­oral term, according to the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics. The jobs were not only in Indiana­polis and Marion County, but also in the seven surrounding counties. If Lugar's claim of64,000 jobs was true, the unemployment rate in Marion County would now be Jess than zero. 
Unemployment figures rose from 
2.2 per cent in Jan. 1968 when Lugar took office, to 5.9 per cent in Dec. 1975 when he stepped down.

"We brought more jobs to Indianapolis and kept more people employed in the face of adversity,·' he declared. 
Another document cited to dis­prove Lugar's claim of aiding the employment situation is an article written by Robert S. K.irk, associate professor of economics at IU-Pur­due University in Indianapolis, and published in the Indiana Business Review recently. 
In that article, Professor Kirk writes, "How well is the Indiana­polis economy recovering? Rel­ative to (Indiana) and national economics, Indianapolis is lagg­ing.''

Ford's programs attacked 
by Gregg B. Bangs Executive Editor 

Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter and his vice-presi­dential running-mate Walter Mon­dale claimed the Ford Administra­tion's management of health funds has resulted in Medicaid scandals and wasted money. 
According to a Sept. 14 Assoc­iated Press report, Carter, while campaigning in Pheonix, Arizona, said he'll raise the issues of aging and health care in his Sept. 23 debate with President Gerald Ford. 
"I'd like to know why after eight years of a Republican administra­tion, we're still losing 25 to SO per cent of all the Medicaid money that's supposed to be for good health care," he said. 
Carter continued, ''The Republi­can administration has just not provided tough, competent man­agement to make our scarce health dollars go to help patients or to prevent disgrace." 
According to the AP report, a Senate sub-committee has recently documented instances of unneces­sary and duplicated health exams and laboratory work for which the government foots the bill. Perhaps as much as half of the $lS billion spent on Medicare is wasted, according to Senate investigators. 
Medicare pays some health bills of the elderly and is financed 
. through social security. Medicaid, on the other hand, is financed by general federal revenues and oper­ated through states. It helps to pay the medical costs of poor people. Carter also said he wanted to ask Ford at the debate why he voted against Medicare when he was in Congress. Carter stated, "When an administration opposes the basic concepts of helping with public funds to provide good health care for our people, it is almost inevit­able that health care programs will not be operated properly." The report said Carter called for "unspecified fiscal and quality controls, investigations, and reor­ganization in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare." Meanwhile, in Pinellas Park, Florida, Sen. Walter Mondale called the Medicaid scandals the result of "a government that is not in charge and rich folks ripping off senior citizens." 
Carter meets with Wallace 

Before leaving for Phoenix, Car­
ter met in Birmingham, Alabama 
with Gov. George Wallace and 
reaffirmed his Southern heritage 
with a strong commitment to the 
area's indigenous conservatism. 
According to a Sept. 13 New 
York Times story, Carter became 
the first member of his party ever 
to seek votes in Alabama, which · last went Democratic in the John F. 
Kennedy year of 1960. 
"We southerners believe in work, 
not welfare," Carter told a crowd at 
a suburban shopping center. 
Wallace, who has always favored 
that type of concept, joined in with 
the applause that followed the 
statement. 
Carter also attacked the tax 
system, labeling it a "disgrace to 
the human race," and said that 
advantages for the wealthy causer' 
troubles for the middle class ar d 
poor. 
He also added that ''The Sc 1 :h 
has always been extremely pa ri J­
tic." 
Throughout all of Carter'& p~r­
formance, Wallace sat in his wheel­
chair and nodded his approval. 
Most of Carter's statements were 
once championed by Wallace, but ' 
not in such a refined way, accord­
ing to the Tim_es story. 
Prison rights sought by Liddy 
DANBURY Conn. AP -G. Gordon Liddy. Watergate burglar and onetime counsel to former President Richard M. Nixon's re­election committee, is now fighting for inmates' rights in the federal prison here. 
Sentenced to teh federal peniten­tiary for his role in the ·watergate scandal. he works as a clerk in the prison power plant and wages war against prison regulations that he says violate prisoners' rights.

Regina Pool out of order 
by Karen Hinks Staff Reporter 

The Regina Hall pool at St. 
Mary's is temporarily out of order. 
The problem is being attributed to 
the filtering system. 
According to Stevie Wernig, vice president of student affairs, the present filtering system cannot adequately clean the volume of water. 
The laxity of hours and the casualness of pool use have kept restrictions to a minimum. En­forcement of showers, essential to entering the pool, was impossible. Both men and women were not required to wear swim caps. 
Another contribution to the filter­ing problem is a leaky roof. The roof was built over the pool two years ago. During rainy periods, impure water leaks into the pool. 
W ernig went on to say that the cause of condensation of water on the ceiling is due to the exh.aust 
system. THe unclean water drips· into the pool. 
W ernig stressed that every effort is being made to repair the system. Student Affairs anticipates com­pletion after the October break. 
''The swim team appears to be at a loss because it is a growing sport at St. Mary's and practices have been temporarily put off," W ernig said. "However, St. Mary's has rented other facilities and practice will begin shortly." 
The Obser\ler is published 111\onday through Friday and v.Eekly during the surrmer session, except during the exams and vacation periods.

until 1981. 
Last February, he was placed in one of several small,· locked cells reserved for disciplining Danbury Federal Correctional Institutional inmat.es. He was accused of being insolent to a guard but was cleared later during an administrative hearing. 
On Aug. 19, Liddy represented himself and other inmates in U.S. District Court in Hartford, where he complained that prisoners placed in "administrative deten­tion were not given adequate explanation for the disciplinary action against them. 
He also argued privileged mail, which can be opened only in the presence of the inmate to whome it is addressed, is being opened outside the inmate addressee's presence. 
U.S. District Court Judge Jon 0. Newman ruled last April that prisoners put in dentention must be given a written explanation. At the same time, Newman designated more categories of mail as "privi­leged.'' 
Liddy's complaints about alleged violations of those decisions are under consideration by Newman, and Danbury Warden George C. Wilkinson refuses to discuss them.

New Hampshire  

Gov. Meldrim Thomson beat Ge­rard Zeiller for the Republican nomination for the governorship. Harry Spanos, a former state senator, won the Democratic nomi­nation. 
Rhode Island Gov. Philip W. Noel, in early returns, was locked in a tight fight with Richard Lorber for the Demo­cratic nomination to U.S. Senate. Lt. Gov. J. Joseph Garrahy beat former Lt. Gov. Giovanni Folcarelli for Democratic nomination for gov­ernor.

Russia may undermine 
black-white conflicts 
DAR ES SALAAM Tanzania AP-A senior American official a­board Henry A. Kissinger's plane charged yesterday the Soviet Union is plotting actively to wreck the secretary of state's bid for black­white peace in turbulent southern Africa. 
Kissinger is portrayed as being not unduly worried or surprised by the alleged Soviet tactics-and to 
., feel that Moscow is struggling as much against the influence of China in Africa as that of America in Britain. Accusations about Soviet moves with regard to Africa emerged as Kissenger landed in Tanzania for . talks with President Julius Nyer­ere. . KLsinger's ali-day meeting with Nyerere today will start the secre­tary's latest attempt at personal shuttle diplomacy. He aims to end what he: "ays is already an i'ntensi­fying war between Soviet-armed black guerrillas and whitle rulers in and around Rhodesia, South Africa and Namibia, South-West Africa. Kissinger hopes also to get, negotiations going for a peaceful transition to black majority rule in both Rhodesia and Namibia and to persuade South African whites to 
dismantle their system of apar­theid, or racial separation. 
The Tanzanian government said Kissinger faces demands from black African presidents that the United States actively support the black guerrilla forces battling white supremacy regimes. 
Reporters traveling with Kissin­ger were told Jacob Malik, the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations and a deputy foreign minister, is a key figure in Mos­cow's alleged attempts to wreck the secretary's mission. 
The senior official aid according to official reports reaching Kissin­ger. Malik is personally warning African envoys to beware of Kis­singer's plans, telling them those plans are racist and aimed at preserving British-American dom­ination in southern Africa. 
Echoed by Moscow propanga media, Soviet ambassadors in most of the 49 countries of Africa and in key European and Asian centers are pushing the Malik line in all their contacts, the senior official said. Their message in essence is that Kissinger's aim is to preserve Western and therefore white sup­remacy in a region whose resources

Flu vaccines-Oct. 8th 
by Alicia Denefe Staff Reporter 

The tentative date for those wanting a swine flu vaccination is October 28, announced vice­president of student affairs, Brother Just Paczesny. Faculty and administrators can receive the vaccination from 8:00 a.m. to 
10:00 
a.m. on this date. Student vaccinations will begin from 

10:00 
a.m. to 4:00 p.m. The program, sponsored by the federal government, is free of charge. 


Swine flu, a strain of human influenza, was isolated during an outbreak of respiratory disease among recruits at Ft. Dix, New Jersey. Twelve cases were con­firmed with one death. Further blood testing of the recruits showed that several · hundred more were infected. With these f<~cts, influenza experts saw the potential for an epidemic. 
"If such an epidemic were to hit the Notre Dame campus, stu­dent health would be over­whelmed," said Notre Dame Viro­logist, Dr. Morris Pollard. 
Fever. aches and pains, head­ache, coughing and difficulty in breathing are some symptoms of the flu. "These last for about 3 or 4 days." said Pollard. 
According to a recent story by the Associated Press, minor side. effects can occur from the vaccin­ation: soreness in the arm, a low fever or a brief tiredness. However, the vaccine contains a killed virus and therefore cannot cause swine flu. Pollard suggested that older people and those in charge of the community, such as firemen and policemen, should definitely re­ceive the vaccination. ''It is vol­untary for others, but it certainly wouldn't hurt," he added.

Collegiate Seminar examined ·restructured
' 
by Karen Hlnks Staff Reporter 

An evaluation of the Collegiate Seminar incurred several changes in the program. 
Collegiate Seminar was instituted in 1954 as an addition to the General Program of Liberal Stud­ies. 
The program is a required two-se­mester course for all liberal arts students except American Studies and general program majors. 
According to Sr. Isabell Charles, dean of the college of arts and letters, a committee was formed last March to evaluate the pro­gram. The committee was com­prised of faculty members and students. The committee found that students objected to the read­ings assigned and the quality of teaching. 
Richard J. Thompson, assistant dean and associate professor of arts 
. and letters. explained the problems arising in having graduate students and law students teaching the seminars. "There is a 'profession­al' and 'chronological' distance between the student and the tea­cher." Thompson said. "We have eliminated this distance. Without exception, the current teaching staff is very qualified." 
Thompson also explained that the readings have been restructured to include a reading list that reflects human culture. The material is very diver~>e andencompassesmany areas. 
"The general feeling of the facul­ty is that to send a student out of Notre Dame with a B.A. degree without having read the classics is doing the student a grave disser­vice," Thompson said. 
The result of the committee investigation also showed the stu­dents' liking of the course. Few took a negative attitude toward the overall program. The Seminar ws rated as being very effective by approximately 54 per ·cent of the students. 
Thompson expressed his feeling that the Collegiate Seminar is the only course offered that is truly interdepartmental. The professor cannot pretend to have all the answers and the result is good discussion and a give and take relationship between student and teacher. 
"I hope the students will give the books and the teachers a chance this year, " Thompson said. "We don't want students to base their opinions on the program of the past."

Dancin' Irish to perform again 
by Kate Smelser Staff Reporter 

The first organizational meeting for students interested in joining Notre Dame's Dancin' Irish was held Monday night in the Lafortune Ballroom. The Dancin' Irish, a drill and precision dance team, will return encouraged by the success of last year's debut. 
According to Bonita Bradshaw, assistant to the coordinator of women's athletics, "The Dancin' Irish are an expression of women's support for Notre Dame, compara­ble to the Irish Guard." The men's dance and drill team carries a longer tradition than the young Dancin' Irish but, in Bradshaw's words, "People got over the new­ness of the idea once they saw us perform." 
At a meeting late last week, last ·semester's members discussed by­laws, promotion, fund-raising and new uniforms. The date for try-outs was left unsettled, and the expected size of the squad is also undetermined. 
The format for Dancin' Irish routines will resemble last year's. Recorded music or the-Notre Dame Band will accompany the squad during their appearnaces at basket­ball games, Mardi Gras, and benefits. Performances at football games were ruled out . because half-time shows were already plan­ned far in advance. 
If interested in trying out for the squad, students, both men and women, are encouraged to volun­teer for activities in Dancin' Irish planning, promotion, fund-raising, and choreography. Bradshaw de­scribed the Dancin' Irish as an excellent opportunity for student _>articipation. "As with any other ~ampus club or organization, one oarticipates for personal growth as well as involvement. The intent of the Dancin' Irish is no different," Bradshaw said.

Students had expressed concern in the cancellation of evening seminars. 
Thompson explained that the evening classes were cancelled in the best interest of students. Scheduled classes in the evening were essential because the classes were being taught by graduate students and law students who must also attend classes during the day. Thompson stated that stu­dents were being cheated of extra­curricular activities because their classes were in competition with basketball games and concerts. The class also conflicted with studying. Evening classes were seen as invitations to the local bars where the seminars turned into bull sessions. The commitees' feeling was that students were being deprived of the full value of the seminars. 
Student reaction to the new change varied. Mark Kline, a junior at Notre Dame viewed the overall change as questionable. 
"I would like to see the return of evening classes because the semi­nar conflicts with a few required courses in my program," Kline explained. "The work load seems to be a little heavy right now, but I do like the idea of students leading class discussions because it en­ables the student to get another viev!point. '' 
Mike O'Connor, another Notre Dame junior, found the revision as being very favorable. "I like it a lot," he said. "The seminars are informal and the books read are the type of books that every one should read at least once in their lives."

As uranium prices skyrocket, 
U.S. oil companies prosper 
by Alan Miller Pacific News Service 

EDITOR'S NOTE: Alan Mlllear Is a former energy and environmental editor for PNS who now teaches on environmental affairs at the Uni­versity of California, Berkeley. 
Although federal grand jury revelations of a secret uranium cartel of foreign governments and corporations have spotlighted in­ternational price fixing, a related area under investigation by the same grand jury has received little attention: big oil's takeover of the 
U.S. uranium industry. 
Over the past decade, major American oil comapanies-including 18 of the top 25--have moved quietly but rapidly to acquire a majority interest in the business of mining and processing uranium, the fuel base of nuclear plants. 
By 1971--the last year the gov­ernment got statistics from the highly secretive uranium industry-­major and minor oil companies controlled 61.8 percent of uranium mining and 50.4 percent of all re­serves, the latter up sharply from 31 percent five years previously. 
Since then, while the price of uranium has skyrocketed from roughly $8 to $40 a pound, the tide of acquisition has accelerated. Gulf has joined Kerr-McGee Oil Co. among the nation's largest ura­nium comapanies, while Atlantic Richfield (Arco) has signed a preliminary merger agreement with Anaconda, another leading uranium mining corporation. 
Exxon, which hdd 5. 9 percent of all reserves in 1971, has obtained uranium mining leases on 400,000 acres of Navajo land in the South­west. And in Washington state, where prospecting for uranium has reached a fever pitch. Reserve Oil, Getty, Exxon and Conoca are all looking for new mining sites. 



Phillips Petroleum, Conoco, Mo­bil and Standard Oil of California have also joined the shift to uranium. 
Ford Foundation energy expert Thomas D. Duchesneau, in a 1975 report to the foundation's Energy Policy Project, concluded that the extensive control of oil companies over "drilling activity, ownership of uranium reserves and mining and milling ... virtually assures the oil interests will continue to be the dominant force in uranium for a long time to come." 
Oil companies also want to buy into nuclear fuel enrichment, cur­rently the reserve of the federal government. The Ford administra­tion is pushing for private rather than public ownership of the next generation of enrichment plants, and Exxon, Signal Oil atld Arco have all expressed interest in building them.

Cou1ncil makes 'value' course new undergrad requirement 
by .1\Uke Towle Staff Reporter 

Beginning with the Class of 1978, a Senior Seminar course on values will be a requirement for all Notre Dame students, according to the Academic Council. This course will be a one-semester, one credit requirement for all under­graduates on a pass-fail basis and is to be administered by each college seperately. 
The creation of this course is a mandate passed by the Academic Council in April, 1975. In sum­mary, the mandate called for the dean of each college to be respons­ible for course organization an dlogistics, and that a pilot Senior Seminar be set up by each college during the 1975-76 academic yfar to be implemented as soon as possi­ble. 
After a year of experimt;ntation, the Senior Seminar on Values has been labeled a partial success and will become a regular part of the curriculum starting with the 1977­78 acad~mic year. 
Dr. Isabel Charles, dean of the College of Arts and Letters stated "It's hard to say just how success­ful the seminar was last year. Some of the Arts and Letters courses were quite successful while others were not. It is clear that student interest waned in the second semester, but that is under­standable. The second semester is always the worst especially for seniors.'' 
Charles added that the seminar is still in the experimental stage ..::?..-! teaching methods are not totally satisfactory.

Chile: brutal police state 

SANTIAGO CIULE As the military government celebrates its third anniversary of rule here, the tail is wagging the dog. 
The tail in this case is the National Intelligence Bureau (DINA), Chile's fanatical secret police agency that is ruining the country's image abroad and in­creasing discontent at home by its severe violations of human rights. 
The dog is Gen. Augusto Pino­chet, who--three months after a military coup overthrew elected President Salvador Allende on Sept. 11, 1973--created DINA out of police and military intelligence units and made the semi-autono­
mous  group  directly  responsible  
only to himself.  
DINA  has  become  a  monster  

with a willing master in its grip, because President Pinochet needs DINA to survive--eveP = ~~ it has already accompl' ;hed it; ori­ginal purpose by ·ushing any semblance of extrerr : left opposi­tion. 
Now, as Pinochet and his rightist civilian advisers establish a top­down, authoritarian regime and impose rich-get-richer economic policies, they must face the active or latent opposition of a growing majority of the entire population. 
Many Chileans--especially among the middle or wealthy classes--hand initially supported the military regime or at least looked the other way when DINA atrocities were first reported be­cause they expected the country would soon return to democratic rule. 
But with the outlawed Allende parties (which won 43 percent of the vote in elections six months before the coup) trying to put together resistance movements,

Board of Regents at SMC to meet 
by Chris Smith Assistant Managing Editor 

The St. Mary's College Board of Regents will meet this weekend at the College. The board is divided into committees, which will discuss development, education, student affairs and the budget. 
St. Mary's College Student Body President. Mary Lou ... ,B-ilek, a member of the Board of Regents, stated that the board would discuss routine matters dealing with the running of the College. She added that the status of parietals would be discussed at the next board meet­ing in January.

all month except to fly to Philadel­
phia for the first of his debates with 
Carter. 
Carter started out in Arizona on Tueday and worked his way to Montana and the Dakotas. Both he and his running mate, Sen. Walter Mondale. accused the Ford ad­ministration of poor management that has turned the Medicare programe into a "National Dis­grace.·· 
Mondale and Carter were to join forces today for appearances in Minnesota. 
Ford spent the day at the White House, but his running mate, Sen. Bob Dole, was campaigning in the West. 
In Pheonix, Ariz., Carter said, 'Td like to know why after eight years of a Republican administra­tion, we're still losing 25 to SO per cent of al the Medicaid money that's supposed to for good health care." 
The Democratic nominee said he wanted to know why Ford, as a congressman, had voted against Medicare, adding "When and ad­ministration opposes the basic concepts of helping with public funds to provide good health care for our people, it is almsot inevit­able that health care progrmss will not be operated properly.'' 
And Carter continued to twit Ford for his stay-at-home campaign strategy, scoffing at Ford's conten­tion that he won't leave Washing­ton until Congress adjourns be­cause he is afraid he House and Senate will "go off the deep end" without him. 
Carter noted that Ford wasn't afraid of leaving Congress alone in Washington during the Republican presidential primaries, recalling that Ford traveled extensively to such states as Mississippi in order to win delegates from Ronald Reagan. 
Turning to his plan for a national health care system, Carter said: "Our country's ready for it, you're ready for it, I'm ready for it, and 
committees. ·' we're going to have it. 
DINA's most important target, the proportion is said to be one in 15. 
In human rights reports com­piled by various international or­ganizations--including the Human Rights Commissions of both the United Nations and the Organiza­tion of American States--DINA has been named responsible for institu­tionalizing torture. Prisoners who survived DINA's secret torture ceenters were transferred to open prison camps have brought out gory accounts of DINA's methods.$ 
In one such report, smuggled out of the Pirque women's prison in late 1975, 66 out of 90 women replied to a uestionnaire about their experiences while being held incommunicado in DINA interro­gation centers. The accounts were written on small scraps of toilet paper and compiled by women prisoners in the relative privacy of women's toilets. 
The women described 11 differ­ent kinds of torture to which they had been submitted. Forty-six wo­men reported being tortured with electric shock; four hanging by arms; three hanging and electri~ city; five immersion in water; 47 beating; 11 "the telephone"-­heavy blows to both ears that frequently result in broken ear drums and deafness; five rape; two broken bones from being run over by cars; seven drugs and hypnosis; one beating with a chain; and ten forced standing for long periods without sleep. 
Thriteen women said they had 

Internally, DINA has imposed its tentacles_on virtually every element of community life--the university, the law profession, unions and the church. 
In August, for example, DINA orgnized a demonstration against three progressive chilean bishops, known for their anti-junta senti­ments, who had been expelled from a church meeting in Ecuador. 
Unfortunately for DINA and Pinochet, the bishops recognized three of the DINA agents and identified them publicly. The revelation and the Church's subse­quent excommunication of the a­gents--the first such retaliation against the junta--caused the pub­lic consternation and even led the ultra-conservative daily El Mercu­rio to call for an investigation. 
But DINA's tactics go far beyond simply organizing rock-throwing crowds. After three years of what the Chilean military calls ''internal war," a pattern of Dina operations has emerged. 
The pattern mcludes periodic mass arrests of suspected activists and their families, interrogation-­usually under torture in secret DINA centers--and, most tragic of all, hte disappearance and pre­sumed murder of up to one-third of those arrested.

The LaFortune Student Center will push back its closing hours until 2 a.m. on Friday nights. The new hours will go into effect "sometime before October break," according to John Reid, assistant director of student activities. 
Previously, the Student Center closed its doors at 12:30 a.m. 
Reid stated that before the new schedule is implemented several problems must be ironed out. Due to several thefts last year, security guards must be present at all time. The longer hours mean a larger bill for security, so the money must be

Last year,The Social Space Com­mission proposed that the Student Center be opened 24 hours. The SLC approved the recommendation but the proposal was never imple­mented. Mike Casey, SLC presi­dent, seemed supportive of the 24 hour lounge, calling it a "good idea.'' He added that the proposal will probably come before the SLC again this fall. 
Congress hurries 
WASHINGTON. AP-Itme IS run­
ning short for the House and

legislation that would renew the

dollars to local governments to use 
pretty much as they wish. 
Members of a House and Senate 
conference committee are faced 
with a $16.3-billion difference in 
S-0-S program seeks volunteers· 
The women's Committee on Sex Offenses is seeking prospective volunteers for S-0-S (Sex Offense Staff), an outreach program for victims of sex offenses and their families. 
S-0-S is a confidential, emotional support and information service available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through Hotline. The nature of S-0-S is crisis intervention. The volunteers work in pairs and can accompany a victim at all points of crisis: hospital. police station, prosecutor's office and court. 
The service is free to any person who calls Hotline. Although the outreach service is limited to St. Joseph County, the volunteers have had telephone contact with people from Michigan and other nearby Indiana counties. 
All volunteers are screened and trained. A ter-session training program will begin in October. The sessions focus on the needs of victims, pshycholgically and emo­tionally. Volunteers are educated in the areas of medical and legal procedures, referrals, and intake procedures. All areas of sexual abuse are discussed; from rape to child molestation to indecent ex­posure. Volunteers are prepared to handle situations which they might encounter as outreach workers. 
Only after successfully com­pleting the training, are volunteers accepted to the staff. The staff currently consists of 28 male and female volunteers. Anyone in­terested in learnin_g more about the two revenue-sharing bills, and they have 2 1/2 weeks to resolve differences before adjourning Oct. 2. 
The Senate on Tuesday voted 80 to 4 for a 5 :Y. -year extension of revenue-sharing that would return $41.2 billion to state and local governments. The House version, passed last June, would continue the program for 3314 years at a cost of $24.9 billion. 
Paul Myer, the White House staff member who worked closely with members of the House and Senate seeking to continue the program, said, "We like the Senate Bill." He predicted that few "on­erous" changes would be made in the House-Senate bill." He pre-
My main concern is, that they have to act quickly." he said. 
In a statement issued after the Senate vote, the White house said President Ford was "extremely pleased" by the bill's passage. He urged the House and Senate to work quickly on a compromise s he ccan have hte Iegilation on his desk before adjournment. 
"To do less would only serve to aggravate the fiscal problems of state and local governments and undermine ecomomic recovery," 
said.

Quiet, but graceful splendor...... . 

by Gregg B. Bangs 

Imagine being an outsider residing for the summer in the Evanston-Wilmette area of Illinois and deciding to take a bicycle ride shortly after you arrive. Not being familiar with the area, you ~et onto Sheridan Road, a north-south thoroughfare that parallels Lake Michigan. 
Sheridan Road, as is all of Evanston, is dominated by half-acre plots that are practically filled by houses built during the twenties. Back then, the plots may have looked merely crowded, but with forty to fifty years of tree and shrub growth added on, the houses now look ridiculously out of proportion to the size of property they-stand on. · 
After passing Evanston General Hospi­tal. you head north toward the Evanston­Wilmette Town border when you see a large expanse of grass on your left. Your eyes follow the grass up to a well-cropped hedge which forces you to look up--and up--in utter amazement. · 
What on God's name is this beautiful, seemingly Oriental type temple doing in the middle of middle America'? And what is the thing anyway? Your curiosity forces you to explore and the trip is well worth it for the Bahai House of Worship is as interesting as it is beautiful. 
The House of Worship was dedicated to public use in 1953. Since then over three million people have visited the structure, which also boasts lovely gardens to match the impressive splendor of its architecture. 
Although deemed a house of worship, there are no outward signs of this building resembling a church or synagogue any way. There are no pulpits, no sermons, no 
Sweet Southside 
by Dominick Salemi 
I remember the first time I heard "I Don't Want To Go Home," I was sitting in some cheap little room with a few of my friends staring at the lodge trophies on the bar and thinking about the date I blew with some sorority. type the week before, why my life was such a failure, and just feeling sorry for myself. All of a sudden from out of the Juke Box. I heard some fine sounding slide and brass with this oh too subtle backdrop of strings. sweep through the bar. 
But it was the chorus that really knocked 
me out: 
I know we had to try 
To reach up and touch the sky, 
Baby whatever happened to you and I 
Hey, I don't want to go home 


In four simple lines I caught all the hope and excitement of getting some unknown girl's attention and knowing at that instant that the sick, funny feeling in the pit of your stomach means you ·don't want to be anywhere or with anyone else but her and then just as suddenly becoming hopelessly lost because you see that she has turned away, leaving you alone again. It wa's at once an exhilarating and depressing sensa­tion. provoking emotions that I could barely explain, much less handle. 
So I listened, and when the song slowly faded with the singer pleading for his girl to come back, I realized that this guy, whoever he was, and I, were attuned to each other. After ascertaining what B12 was on the box, I stumbled out of the bar, oblivious to all my friends who were in the process of drinking themselves into a stupor, and went into the first record store I could find and bought this album. 
Needless to say, I was not disappointed. The Ip was everything I knew it would be only better. Now, if you don't believe it possible to get so worked up over a lump of plastic, then check out for yourself the fine versions of "Broke Down Piece of Man" and "It Ain't the Meat, It's the Motion;" inspired renditions that show the band to be more than mere practitioners of the art of r & b. These guys don't just play this stuff, they live it. , 
If those two cuts don't convince you, then dig the splendid orginals by Stevie Van Zandt and some unknown, but hip dude, named Springsteen who happens to be a good friend of the band. This guy sounds like a real comer if only on the basis of the two originals penned here. 
The band itself is as tight as you could ask for. Perhaps the best thing about the Ip beside Southside's soulful vocals is the s.upport lent by the Miami Horns, who joyfully punctuate most of the up tempo stuff on the disc with some ear-splitting licks. And listen to this hipster Spring­steen shooting straight from the hip, who, while reminiscing about the band's early days, says, "They were each in their own way a living spirit of what, to me, rock and roll is all about. It was music as survival and they lived it down in their souls, night after night." 
If this album is any indication of their present state of mind, you can bet that somewhere tonight a bar in Asbury Park, New Jersey is gonna be open till late. 
rituals and no ceremonies. In fact the only services consist of readings from the texts of the world's known religions. According to the Bahai view, an emphasis is put on individual worship and meditation because they believe every person is responsible for his or her own spiritual development. 
But what is the Bahai religion? According to an informative and colorful brochure given out, the Bahai faith came into being in the middle of the nineteenth century when Baha'u'llah, its prophet­founder. was born in 1817 to a noble Persian family. The brochure states that, "His cause--stands identified with, and revolves around, the principle of the organic· unity of mankind as representing the consummation of the whole process of human evolution.'' 
''This stage in this stupendous evolu­tion','they assert, ·;s not only necessary but ine-vitable, that it is gradually approaching, and that nothing short of the celestial potency with which a divinely ordained Message can claim to be endowed can succeed in establishing is,'' the brochure 
Ramones II?/! 
by Dominick Salemi 
The Ramones are four morons who wear leather jackets and sneakers and think they are very cool. They also happen to be one of the most popular and influential rock bands in NYC. 
Led by Joey Ramone, formerly Sylvain Sylvain of the New York Dolls, the Ramones are a musical phenomenon who have gained prominence by playing some on NY's smaller clubs. notably CBGB in the Village, which has suddenly become the center of a burgeoning underground musical scene. This is not to imply that the Ramones are composers of "music" in the technical sense of the word. What they have chosen to do instead is play simple three-chord rock and roll, very fast and very loud. 
The band has naturally been accused of playing in such a volatile fashion in order to disguise the fact that they don't know what they're doing; but this of course is a misconception; the Ramones know exactly what they're doing. they're just not always in control when they're doing it. 
RAM ONES is Joe and Co.'s first album and most probably their last. Any group that habitually uses the same three chords in every song will rapidly run out of imaginative ways to arrange them. Yet most of the cuts cleverly average around goes on. This explanation is also given in numerous slide shows and films given in the basement of the building. 
The first Bahai community in the United States was founded in Chicago in 1894. Plans for the first House of Worship were begun in 1903. An open competition was held to decide what design would win approval of the Chicago Bahai's. All designs were exhibited in the Smithsonian Institute and French-Canadian architect Louis Bourgeois was declared the winrer. Bourgeois, who had studied at the E.:ole des Beaus Arts in Paris. was the unani­mous selection of forty-nine delegates. 
Bourgeois struggled for eight years previous to the cc.mpetition trying to get an inspiration for the building. When it hit him, he decided to shape the top of the temple in a bell shape because this bell "was the greatest musical instrument we have: it is the conveyor of sound to the greatest distance. It conveys our sorrow~ and our joys--this temple--it is the Great Bell. Calling to America." 
The bell shaped top of the temple stands out from the rest of the building. The white. ornamental forms a combination of religious symbols. make an intricate maze of patterns. When the sunlight pours through them in the early afternoon. the patterns are beautifully reproduced in the shadows cast on the floor. 
The house always seems to have visitors; whether they have come to pray. gawk or enjoy the gardens. After a few visits to the house. you realize that the Bahai house is not out of place at all in Wilmette. In fact, its quiet. but graceful splendor becomes a focal point for this lakeside town. If you're ever in Chicago, whether it's for a day or a summer, on bicycle or car, try to get up to the Bahai House.__ 
two minutes, so you can never really get tired of hearing any of them even though they ALL sound exactly alike. 
As for the individual songs themselves, (if one even bothers to pay attention to such things), they are as idiotic as one could expect, more stupid by far than anything, say Sam the Sham and the Pharoahs or The Royal Guardsman, ever

did. Then again. one has no right to expect <Wlything from an aJl-,um that was produced 
on a penurious budget of $12.000 and was mixed.so that it is impossible to distinguish whet e one cut ends and another begins. 
So why are the Ramones so good? All I 
can say is that you either-like their 
self-styled punk sensibility. with its con­
temptuous attitudes and tacit postures of imbecility inherent in songs like "Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue," or you don't. Still there's no denying the splenetic energy found in "Blitzkrieg Bop." the playful sadism of "Beat on the Brat," the inarticulate sensitivity of "I Just WannaBe Your Boyfirend," or the existential dilem­ma posed in "I Don't Wanna Walk Around With You": 
I don't wanna walk around with you 
I don't wanna walk around with you 
I don't wanna walk around with you 
So why do you wanna walk around with me? 
As any fool can plainly see, this is not the most sophisticated band ever to emerge from New York. yet the release of this lp has found a lot of hip critics attempting to justify their professed enthusiasm for so pedestrian a band by pedantically pro­pounding theories purporting to explain the group's artistic and cultural value. The Ramones haven't any, of course, so there's really no need to allay anyone's suspicions regarding the Ramones by indulging in sesquipedalian antics. After all... , it's only rock and roll.

Boulac: Notre Dame must execute 
by Paul Stevenson 
The Fighting Irish started last Saturday's game against Pitts­burgh in a style reminiscent of Notre Dame of the past, driving from their own 14 yard line, 86 yards to paydirt. 
The Irish tally would turn out ot be their only touchdown of the day as the momentum soon shifted behind Pitt. 
··As the game progressed we became more erratic," Brian Bou­lac. offensive line coach, commen­ted. "It was an uphill battle. We had to throw the ball and Pitt knew it. As we went passing, their defensive changes became more pronounced." 
When a defensive team suspects their opponent will mount a certain attack. their job is simplified. The yuarterback has to lead the team against a prepared defense, thus making his job all the more difticult. 
"We had assignment errors up front and a couple of times a lineman was just beaten," Boulac acknowledged. "You can't blame Rick (Slager) alone for the offensive performance. No one could have gotten out of the situations he was presented with. The quarterback always has to take the blame when he was forced to throw or take a loss be~.ause of assignment break­downs. 
"We take the responsibility of performance as a team." Boulac mentioned. "No one man is singled out, we're a unit." 
A quarterback cannot operate unless he has the 'protection of the offensive line. If the line was deficient. the need for some chan­ges in offensive line personnel may

Chip ·ScanIon =:=:=:=:===============:=:=:=:=:=:=:::::::=:=:=:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 
Chip Shots 
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::=:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::. · Saturday the greatest student body in the world became just another group of students watching their footl;>all team on an autumn afternoon. Seeing the student body sitting for most of the debacle against Pittsburgh Saturday was as disappointing to the football team and the coaching staff as it was to observers from outside the Notre 
Dame community .. Granted it was not the type of game that Notre Dame likes to see; a 
. game that the Irish were never really in after the first half. But in the past the Notre Dame student body has cheered their teams on to some of the most remarkable comebacks in collegiate sports history. 
Two years ago when the Irish were losing a homeopenerto Purdue the students never gave_ up until the final moments of the game. The Boilermakers greeted the Irish with 24 first quarter points and led 24-7 at the half. Irish field general Tom Clements narrowed the score to 24-14 and then 31-20 before time was to run out on the Irish. To all those in the stands it seemed inevitable that the Irish would reverse the situation and that Purdue would find themselves faced with a long ride back to Lafayette. · 
-. On Saturday the present generation of Irish fans were faced with a similar situation and have nothing to be proud about in the losing effort. From the press box, a vantage point that has always yiel.ded visiting sports writers a glimpse of the unusual antics employed by the student body to inspire their Irish, the view was one of serenity. Gone was the sea of arms that was such an awesome sight to intruding teams when they entered no mans land in front of the student body. Missing _ was the roarthatoften halted opposing quarterbacks from calling their cadences and sent them back to the huddle on many occasions. If this is the pattern that the student body is going to follow in the future, aJ.I well and good. But at future pep rallies when a speaker comments on Notre Dame students being the greatest student body in the world, it will be a false pride that starts the crowd cheering, not an intense spirit that used to account for the accolade.

Parseghian keeping busy 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -Last 
Saturday, Ara Parseghian rose ear­
ly, as usual. 
"My first thought was that Notre 
Dame was playing a football game 
and we had to win," he said. 
"Then I realized it's not my 
responsibility any more.'' 
The next morning, following 
Notre Dame's 31-10 loss to Pitt, 
Parseghian went out and hit a few 
golf balls, attended a social brunch 
and flew to Miami to make a 
speech. 
"I didn't have to face all the 
problems a losing coach has to 
face," he said, "but I know how 
Dan Devine must have felt on 
Sunday morning. Then I looked at 
the paper and saw that Bear Bryant 
lostDarreii Royal lost, John Robin­
son lost his debut at Southern Cal, 
.and I thought maybe I'm better off 
doing what I'm doing. I didn't 
have to face all the problems a 
losing coach has to face·.'' 
'.'In fact, I mentioned to my wife how two years ago the pressure to win had become almost an obses­sion and we were both grateful at no longer having to face the consequences of it one way of the other." 
These days, Parseghian--two years removed from the Notre Dame coaching job--is narrating a new syndicated television sports series, some public relations work, fund-raising for multiple sclerosis, selling credit insurance, making .speeches. "I have more than 
enough to do," he said. "I don't 
think I could slow down. I'd 
probably be back in coaching if I 
had nothing to do.'' 
Saturday he also served as color commentator for ABC's telecast of the Notre Dame -Pitt game, an offer he refused a year ago. 
"It was difficult because I spent 11 years coaching at Notre Dame," he said. "I don't think I'd have been able to do a Notre Dame game last year." 
And "coaching" from the TV booth isn't the same as it is down on the field. Early in the second quarter, Parseghian said Notre Dame probably wouldn't pass from its own territory. The Irish 
promptly threw two interceptions possible return to those problems less than 11/2 minutes apart. as a pro coach. But despite all his "I tried to be objective about the current activities and his insistence game," Parseghian said, although that he never again will coach at

Michigan and Ohio State, the big 
two of the Big Ten, took over the 
1-2 positions in The Associated 
Press' first regular season college 
footbal poll Monday with just one 
point separating the two arch-ri­
vals. 
As a result of the weekend's 
wave of upsets, Nebraska surrend­
ered its No. 1 preseason ranking 
and dropped to eighth place while 
Arizona State skidded from third to 
18th. Nebraska was held to a 6-6 
tie by Louisiana State and Arizona 
State bowed to UCLA 28-10. 
Louisiana State, previously unrank­
ed, now is No. 16 and UCLA moved 
up from No. 17 to fifth place. 
The biggest gain was made by Missouri. Unranked in the presea­son poll, the Tigers walloped Southern California 46-25 and zoo­med to sixth while the Trojans reeled from eighth to an also-ran. 
Michigan's Wolverines, runners­up to Nebraska in the preseason ratings, trimmed Wisconsin 40-27 and received 28 first-place votes and 1,077 of a possible 1,220 points in a nation-wide poll of 61 sports writers and broadcasters. Ohio State, which clobbered Michigan State 49-21, pulled down 18 first­place ballots and 1,076 points. 
In third place was Pittsburgh with nine first-place votes and 892 points for a 31-10 thumping of Notre Dame, a setback which dropped the 11th-ranked Irish out of the Top Twenty. 
Oklahoma, trying to make it three national championships in a row, moved up from fifth to fourth with four first-place votes and 865 points for a 24-3 triumph over Vanderbilt. 
The other two first-place ballots went to fifth-place UCLA. The Bruins totaled 731 points. 
Rounding out the Top Ten were Missouri, Penn State, Nebraska, Georgia and Maryland. Penn State, No. 10 in the preseason voting, defeated Stanford 15-12; Georgia climbed from 16th to ninth by outscoring California 36-24 and Maryland jumped from 12th to lOth via a 31-7 trouncing of Richmond.

Although there were weaknesses 

in the offensive line against Pitt, 
there were some good performan­
ces on the parts of Mike Carney 
and Dave Huffman. 
"Mike (Carney) played an out­

standing game, coming out of the 
infirmary after two days with the 
flu," Boulac mentioned. "Dave 
(Huffman), who started his first 
game at center, played extremely 
well against Pittsburgh's AI Roma­
no, one of the top defensive 
linemen in the country." 
"They both played a very good game with very few execution errors," Boulac stated. "However, we still look for them to improve along with the rest of the team.'' 
The Irish must continue to 

improve until they gel as a team. 
This improvement is a difficult 
task, something that will come with 
experience. 
"I feel strongly that we have the talent to be a good offensive team," Boulac said. "We have talented backs, quarterbacks, re­ceivers and linemen. I don't believe we'll face any defense tougher than Pitt's." 
"We're young and we can only get better. We are going to improve. Experience is essential in an offensive line, and we're gaining this experience," he said. 
The Irish have a great deal of improving to do before this Satur­day's contest with Purdue. Past events are only memories now, and Notre Dame can only await the future. "With support, this team can come around and show the student body the potential the have," Boulac concluded.
