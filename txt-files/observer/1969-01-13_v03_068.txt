Surprise Paris Meeting Still Fails 
PARIS (UP!) -The United States and North Vietnam met unexpectedly last night in an effort to get the Paris talks on Vietnam moving during President Johnson's administration, but they failed once again to break the procedural deadlock. 
Cyrus R. Vance, deputy chief of the American delegation to the conference, summoned his North Vietnamese counterpart, Col. Ha Van Lau, to their first secret encounter in 10 days. 
It lasted for two hours and IS minutes and ended on as discouraging a note as previous sessions, an American spokesman said. 


North Irish Leader Rips Catholics 
BELFAST, Northern Ireland (VPI) -Northern Ireland's home affair minister charged yesterday that the aim of the organizers of the current civil rights campaign "appears to be to create civil strife."

Infantry Repulses VietCong at Delta 
SAIGON (UPI)-American infantrymen defending a bivouac in Mekong Delta swamps hurled back a Viet Cong charge before dawn yesterday in heavy fighting that raged for more than an hour. 
The U.S. command said the men of the 9th Infantry Division lost nine killed and 17 wounded while killing at least six VietCong in a force which crept through marshy flatlands and attacked the camp with small arms and rocket grenades. 
Field reports said the Americans, with support from machine guns aboard AC47 "Spookies," sent the Communists reeling back into the rice paddies 60 miles southwest of Saigon shortly after 3 a.m. 
North of Saigon, other U.S. infantrymen broke out of an ambush set up to trap them as they headed to reinforce some embattled buddies a mile away and reported killing 22 North Vietnamese attackers.

Urges Appeal Board 
' 
At a flail Presidents Council meeting last night in the student center am phi theatre Ron Mastriana, co-chairman of the IIPC, summed up a report to be presented before the Student Life Council on January 20. The report was drawn up by the SLC's Subcommittee on Hall Life composed of Mastriana, Rev. James L. Riehle, CSC, and Rev. Ernest J. Bartell, CSC. 
Its provisions deal with a Tripartite Appeals Board, drinking, hall Directors, and parietal hours. The subcommittee suggests that there be set up a Tripartite to which hall presidents can appeal rectors' actions. The report also asks that the University rule this because specified parietal hours deny hall autonomy." 

(When the HPC asked the SLC for the individual hall right to establish parietals last Sunday, the HPC was turned down be­cause of the lack of "strong enough reasons." McKenna is now in the process of drawing up irrefutable reasons for the HPC's request.) 
During the remainder of the HPC meeting McKenna set up four new committees. One's pur­pose is to do research on and find rationale for parietal hours. Another's is to study stay hall room selection plans. Tom Davis of Cavanaugh was put in charge of a permanent committee to do necessary research on anv topic.

In the report, Bartell, Riehle, and Mastriana are asking that certain hours be set aside for parietals on weekends. Mastriana said, "We've been counting our votes and I think we'll get it through. But Hcsburgh and the Board of Trustees still have final veto power." Phil McKenna, chairman of the HPC said, "I hope there arc some students on the SLC who will vote against

Few men can say that they have influenced history, and almost nobody that I can think of on the Notre Dame campus. True, we have had our share of TIME covers but these have celebrated football , nore than they have extolled excellence or influence. Notre-Dame has trained infulential men, but the closest it has come to placing a man in a real power position was with William E. (Remember?) Miller in the 1964 election. 
The year 1968, which vrill be recalled by many men for many reasons, saw a change in that a man from this school helped change the political course of this nation. This man was one of perhaps thirty individuals nationwide who led the campaign against Lyndon Johnson and the War. 
A year ago the United States of America appeared to be a political wasteland. The President was sure of renomination, while George Romney and Richard Nixon shied away fro.n promising voters any choice on Vietnam and nutional goals. Robert Kennedy gave no indication that he would enter the race, and Nelson Rockefeller insisted ''I'm through with Presidential politics." 
However, one man stood up and spoke out 
substantively against the Adninistration. He was­
and is · a diffident and baffling figure, seemingly a 
towering man of courage at one moment and a 
vindictive politician at the next. Whatever would 
happen later in the year, EugcneMcCarthy was in 
New Hampshire giving the voters a choice. He spoke. in a soft voice, and hs message was one of peace. 
Many laughed at McCartl:y, and party hawks bragged he would get no norc than ten percent of the primary vote. The campaign was underfinanccd and unstaffcd. Yet, a braYe group of men stood up with the Senator and worked to make his campaign a reality not just in New llampshire but in places such as Indiana. One of t'wse men was Dr. James Bogle of the Notre Dame C~overnment Department. 
In a way the McCarthy campaign for much of 
the Midwest started with Bogle and started at 
Notre Dame. tinder the leadership of Mary 
Perrone and Chuck Nau the first McCarthy for 
President youth group in the country was formed. 
However, throughout the good moments and the 
bad, the major figure was Bogle. In one of the 
most conscrvati rc states of the U.S., he put 
together a voluntr ~r organization of more than 
9000 people. In less than three months he put 
15,000 miles on a new car travelling throughout 
Indiana urging on those committed to stopping the 
War and the man who caused it. 
Bogle made a unique contribution to Notre 
Dame as he worked excruciatingly hard with 
McCarthy. For the first time a high degree of 
political awareness and activism was stimulated on 
what has been a most peaceful and isolated 
campus. The example of the calm yet intensly 
involved profess01 was followed as hundreds of 
students here worl:ed on the campaigns of Eugene 
McCarthy and Robert Kennedy, as well as the 
unprecedented effort on behalf of Mark llatfield 
at the mock convention. 
In the end the rumpled suits and cracked up car produced a strong moral reward for Bogle, and for all those who were mocked in the early going. McCarthy defeated Johnson in New Hampshire. Two weeks later, following the declaration of the Kennedy candidacy, the President deescalated the War and quit the race. The year 1968 would bring many disapp<intments, but the tide of history had been reversed b¥ a few courageous men. 
There can be no doubt, then, that Notre Dame's 
man of the year is Dr. James Bogle. Along with a 
very few others he stopped Johnson and slowed 
down the War. 
He stood up when others remained silent. Dr. Bogle is an example of the committed man in the modern university. Let us hope others in the fac;:ulty, and perhaps the Government Department as a whole, adopt his as an example of relevance.
