LONDON 
Britain and Ireland remain committed to establishing a peace process in Northern Ireland, but the "the window of opportunity" for progress may be closing, Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds said Sunday. 
In an interview on BBC tele­vision. Reynolds underscored his belief that an apparent will­ingness by the Irish Republican Army to compromise must be seized before it fades away. 
At a meeting planned for Dec. 
3, Reynolds and British Prime Minister John Major are ex­pected to agree on a common approach to promoting peace in the British province. 
Reynolds said he and Major "know exactly what we're try­ing to do -and that is to find a formula for the cessation of vio­lence and get the talks process going as soon as possible." 
If the matter is left until next year, "the atmosphere and the whole environment" to exploit the "window of opportunity may well have disappeared," he said. 

The Reynolds-Major initiative is partly in response to secret talks this year between Gerry Adams, the head of the IRA­supporting Sinn Fein party, and John Hume, the IRA's main Roman Catholic political oppo­nent. 
Hume's Social Democratic and Labor Party rejects the IRA's use of violence in its cam­paign to unite the largely Protestant British province with predominantly Catholic Ireland. 
Hume and Adams this fall presented to the Irish and British leaders a list of princi­ples upon which they agree. 
Those principles have not been made public, but are believed to include an IRA ceasefire partly in exchange for Britain's commitment to promote the union of Ireland and Northern Ireland. 
Major last week reiterated his determination to offer Sinn Fein a role in talks only if the IRA permanently ended its violence first. 
Talks between Burne's SDLP, Northern Ireland's three pro­British parties and the Irish and British governments collapsed in deadlock last November after 18 months. That process excluded Sinn Fein and did not address paramilitary violence directly. 
Efforts to persuade Sinn Fein to abandon its support for vio­lence have received backing from Pope John Paul 1.1 and Cardinal Cahal Daly of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland. 
Daly, a harsh IRA critic, said Sunday that Sinn Fein was be­ing offered something it had never received before in the history of Northern Ireland: equal rights at the talks table. 
Alternative coping is method to rid stress 
By TRACY CRINION · 
News Writer 
The secret to effectively deal­ing with stress lies in finding alternative methods of dealing with it, said Dr. Dominic Vachon of University Counseling Center, at a stress workshop for students held last night. 
Academic life causes anxiety because of its propensity to be overly demanding, especially in graduate school, he said. 
"No one ever says, 'That's enough. People are always asking for more,"' said Vachon. One graduate student likened graduate work at Notre Dame to being on a treadmill, where the more she accomplished, the faster the work came at ber. Other causes of stress are grades and the consistent delay of gratification in the hopes that it will pay off later on, said Vachon. 
"Anxiety," said Vachon, "is a perceived sense of danger. It is a vague threat to one's identity or sense of self." 
However, it has its benefits as well as its costs, he said. Without anxiety, work would never get done, while too much is paralyzing, he said. How much is too much? "When the Notre Dame Power Plant at­tempts to hire you to generate power with your nervous leg shaking," said Vachon, illus­trating humor's power to over­come stress. 
Undergraduate freshmen suf­fer an enormous amount of anxiety, said Vachon. Watching grades fall from consistent A's to B's in high school to C's in college is disastrous to the freshman psyche, he said. "They think, ' I must be a bad student,' without realizing the difference between the two sys­tems," said Vachon. 
Dwelling on stress and anxi­ety will only worsen it, he said, offering several alternative methods of dealing with high­pressure situations; working on things that are within your con­trol, eliminating perfectionist ideals, and employing positive imaging and thinking. 
While anxiety and stress can­not be eliminated, it can be handled, he said, and coped with in several ways. 
"Rehearsal of stressful situa­tions helps," said Vachon. "If you panic in test situations, make up your own test before the actual one." 
Health of the individual is es­sential, he added, urging the audience to think of themselves as intellectual athletes, 
"Athletes do not deprive themselves of food or sleep," Vachon said, "why should you?" 
Having a social life helps to put things into perspective, he added. "A friend, an adviser, even a counselor, can help you see different ways around your anxieties," said Vachon. 
For coping effectively with long-term pressure, Vachon offered five key points: talk to yourself realistically and posi­tively, maintain effective health buffers, use consistent and ef­fective deep relaxation methods and on-the-spot tension reduc­ers, manage time with intelli­gent pacing, balance and orga­nization, and cope construc­tively with difficult events and with temporary distress. 
Vachon cited Football Coach Lou Holtz as a role model. After Saturday's loss to Boston College, Holtz did not "beat himself up." Instead, he asked "what he and the team could learn from their experience. It's important to move on," Vachon said.

INSIDE COLUMN NATION AT AGLANCE 
Who -were the real losers this -weekend? Bobby Bowden was right.________ The one you lose always seems to be the big one. Everyone had overlooked Boston College as another stepping stone to our possi­ble rematch with Florida State. Everyone that is, except for Boston College. To them, this was like Khan facing Kirk for the Eric Ruethling second time. One could Photographerimagine Tom Coughlin sitting at the helm of the Reliant, saying "Do you know, Holtz, the Klingon proverb 'Revenge is a dish best served cold?' It is very cold in South Bend." Now that the damage has been done, many people are looking for people to blame. A big target is Pete Bereich, who let a crucial inter­ception slip through his fingers. It doesn't mat­ter to them that the tempature was hovering around thirty degrees, and he had played four hard quaters of football. Another big target is Bobby Taylor (sorry Bobby), who got burned on a long play, and acted too cautious for the rest of the evening. It doesn't matter that he broke up several passes, and had to hustle all afternoon. Kevin McDougal could also be blamed, for throwing a costly interception, and allowing himself to get blitzed all night long. No one compares this to the clutch passes to Derrick Mayes and the "I am Rick Mier against Penn State" fourth and goal to go to Lake Dawson. One could pick apart the team, citing how they failed to become charged for this game, or by thinking too far ahead. However, lost in the sorrows is Mayes's constant signaling to the crowd to sound it up. Also forgotten is the team that was twenty-one points behind going into the fourth quarter, only to lose it all with a last second field goal. However, the blame can go both ways. The players could blame the crowd, who sold their tickets, and watched it on television. They could also blame the crowd that didn't seem to exist until the fourth quarter, and yet were ready to storm the field as soon as victory seemed evident. They could blame the fair weather friends who cheered them only when they were winners. Everyone knows that in the beginning of the year it seemed that we'd be another six and five team. Everyone had their little digs and cutting comments about some of the players. I did too. Hay "two yards" Zellars. Lee "going back­wards" Becton. As soon as we started winning, we all became interested. Instead of dreaming about next year and Ron "glass man" Powlus, we stand at the end of the season ten and one. How many of you have forgotten the twenty­one point margin given on ESPN between us and Michigan? How many have you forgotten the "well orchestrated pass offense of BYU.... that will certainly rip up the slow pass rush o the Irish." What about "Bill Walsh's pro style offense. and the short pass will certainly hurt the Irish." Do you remember: "By stopping our recievers? Not! By stopping Charlie? Not! ... " Despite the game's slow offensive start, and the defense, constantly running to catch up, the game reminded me of a quote given to me by my swim coach. "Champions are teams who can come back from the greatest of deficits." It is safe to say that losers are the ones who leave after three quarters.

Golf shot leads to war monument 
DENVEH 
Had his golf shot gone straight, George Kaub wouldn't 
have stumbled onto a Civil War monument that had been 
dumped with some junk. On ,Wednesday, the restored 
monument was rededicated with a ceremony featuring a 
cannon-fire salute and men dressed as Union soldiers. 
"All the result of a lousy golf ball?" said Kaub, who found 
the monument last summer while looking through the 
rough at City Park Golf Course. Kaub, 69, began a cam­
paign to save the monument. He spent $8,000 to replace 
a missing brass sundial atop the waist-high stone and 
plaque. The monument was first dedicated 65 years ago 
and displayed in a City Park rose garden. It was moved 
when the Denver Zoo expanded. Two years ago, the 
monument was ditched in the rough after workers 
cleaned out a shed. "George. I'm told if you rotate your 
hips on your follow-through, your ball will be less likely 
to slice," Mayor Wellington Webb quipped at the ceremo­
ny. "Thank goodness your golf ball led us to today." 
Hunters' donated catch helps feed hungry 
CHARLESTON, W.Va. 
From the Hockies to the Appalachians, hunters are 
helping the hungry by donating deer, elk, and other wild 
animals they bag to food banks. For Iris Bostic, who sup­
ports a family of four on her Social Security check, the 
two-pound packages of ground venison she brings home 
from the Mountaineer Food Bank means she doesn't have 
to go without meat. "We wouldn't eat red meat at all if it 
wasn't for the free deer," said Bostic, 64, who lives out­
side Charleston, W.Va. She uses the donated deer meat 
to cook meatloaf, chili. spaghetti sauce and Hamburger 
Helper for her disabled son, foster daughter and grand­
son. The idea of donating game to feed poor people 
started in Texas in 1989; now, there are programs across 
the country, said Lynne Blair, coordinator for Sportsmen 
Against Hunger.

Virginia loses Lego park to California 
MANASSAS, Va. 
Mickey. Minnie and Goofy have apparently scared the Legos right out of Virginia. Danish toymaker Lego Inc. has decided to build its first U.S. theme park in California instead of Virginia, Virginia Gov. Doug Wilder said Thursday. Lego wouldn't confirm the decision, but the company scheduled a news conference for Friday in Carlsbad, Calif., near San Diego. "Seniormost Lego of­ficials from Denmark are flying in now and will make the site selection known then," said Lego spokesman David Lafrennie. Wilder said Lego was worried about compet­ing with the theme park that Walt Disney Co. announced last week it would build in Virginia near Washington, D.C.

Rapper T upac Shakur held in sodomy case 
NEW YORK 
Rapper-actor Tupac Shakur was arrested for allegedly holding a woman down while his friend sodomized her. The arrest came less than three weeks after he was charged with shooting two off-duty Georgia policemen. The 22-year-old, who co-starred with Janet Jackson in the film "Poetic Justice," was among three people ar­rested late Thursday at the Parker Meridien Hotel, said Officer Rosa Atamyildiz, a police spokeswoman. The other two were accused of trying to keep the woman from fleeing after she was attacked. She eventually man­aged to get away. The alleged sodomizer fled the hotel before police arrived and remained at large today. The 20-year-old woman was sodomized after she and Shakur were already inside the bedroom together and his three friends in the suite outside joined them, Atamyildiz said.

Atnerican turns down tnediation 
By SUSAN HIGHTOWER 
Associated Press 
FORT WORTH, Texas 
The chairman of American Airlines dug his heels in Sunday, turning down a call from striking flight attendants for a presidential mediation board while announcing up to two-thirds of this week's flights would be canceled. 
Speaking on the fourth day of the planned 11-day strike by the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, airline Chairman Robert Crandall ac­knowledged that American fell short in notifying passengers about canceled flights, but said it has been impossible to know which flight attendants would report for work and thus which flights would be affected. 
In hopes of placating thou­sands of inconvenienced trav­elers, Crandall said holders of unused, non-refundable tickets could get their money back. In addition to a refund, displaced passengers also will get a $100 voucher towards an American ticket in the coming year. 
The strike by about 21,000 flight attendants has cost the airline at least $10 million per day, Crandall said. 
The airline plans to concen­trate on flights at its main hubs at Dallas, Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico. The airline will also focus on flights from New

STUDENTS CAN HELP IMPROVE "TI-lE GUIDE" 
In order to im­prove future editions of The Guide, Student Gov­ernment is soliciting help from the student body. The publication is pub­lished for the benefit ofthe students at ND, and it will only be successful with your help. 
In order for his or her course to be listed in The Guide, a professor must give permission for evaluations to be distrib­uted to his or her class. Many professors did not participate in the Spring '94 evaluation process, and students need to encour­age them to take part in next semester's Guide. 
If students let their professors know that they liked and used The Guide, participation will increase and the next edition will be more complete.

Earlier Sunday, union President Denise Hedges said she wrote American Chairman Robert Crandall asking him to join her in asking the National Mediation Board to request the emergency paneL 
"With no settlement offer from you in sight and the heavy-traffic holiday period now upon us, we've decided to take the initiative and try to end the strike," Hedges said. 
Crandall rejected the offer, saying an emergency mediation board would put the airline's future in the hands of people under political pressure who have no long-term interest in the company. He added that the mediation board could be expected to split the difference between the two sides' offers 
The mediation board had 
been overseeing contract ne­
gotiations between American 
and the union, which broke off 
due to differences in pay, 
health benefits, staffing and 
scheduling. 
A Transportation Department 
official said it was unclear 
whether the strike would qual­
ify for mediation board arbitra­
tion. The panel intervenes in 
cases where there is a signifi­
cant disruption to the economy. 
It is up to the board, an inde­
pendent government agency, 
and not the White House, to 
determine if the request for 
mediation is appropriate, said 
the official, who spoke on con­
dition of anonymity. 
Students are also needeJ to work on the 1994 and 1995 editions of The Guide. Two chair people will be chosen to head the project and staff members are also needed. Ifyou are interested in helping or have any questions, please call HeatherArnoldat631­7668.

Plan unacceptable for Bosnians 
By MARK PORUBCANSKY Associated Press 
BUCHAREST, Romania 
Desperate to end Bosnia's war, European powers have devised a plan that tries to please everyone but won't sat­isfy those who matter most: the Bosnian government and Serb nationalists. 
The plan, which France and Germany will present to European Community foreign ministers Monday in Luxembourg, further isolates the Sarajevo government while forcing the Serbs to make painful compromises. 
For those reasons, its success is doubtful. 
While most recent fighting in Bosnia has been between Croats and Muslims, it was a Serb-Muslim standoff over small chunks of land in eastern Bosnia, about three percent of Bosnia, that doomed the previ­ous peace plan two months ago. 
It gave the Muslims 31 per­cent, twiee what they now con­trol. Serbs, who hold about 70 percent, would have gotten 51 percent and Croats 18 percent. 
The new plan calls for Bosnian Serbs to relinquish an additional three percent to four percent more of the territory they hold in exchange for a gradual lifting of sanctions against Serb-led Yugoslavia. 
The 12 European Community nations will also consider Monday boosting humanitarian aid for Bosnia, four days after the warring sides guaranteed safe passage for United Nations relief convoys. 
The United States is not en­thusiastic about the peace plan, but has not been a major player on the Bosnian scene lately. 
The approach is popular with Russia, a U.N. Security Council member; Greece, which soon takes up the rotating EC chair; and poor countries such as Homania, Bulgaria and Macedonia that have suffered from lost trade. 
France and Britain say sanc­tions, which would be lifted en­tirely once a comprehensive peace deal is in force, could be suspended when the Serbs start complying. This would give Serbs an incentive to end the conflict, they say. 
The plan also includes a long­range Balkan conference that the Bosnian government seeks. And it urges neighboring Croatia, which opposes lifting the sanctions, to make a deal with Serb insurgents who hold a third of Croatia. 
But plans that make sense for the outside world founder in Bosnia. 
Sarajevo government officials say the plan unfairly puts the onus on them. 
France and Germany "are trying to present us as the side which is for war," said Bosnian government spokesman Kemal Muftic. "They will accuse us in the end of not wanting to stop the war because of some three percent of the territory." 
Muftic stressed the govern­ment was unwilling to sanction Serb seizure of land through the use of murder and terror. 
Recent government battlefield successes in central Bosnia have also apparently enticed the government to hold out for a more favorable settlement. 
Bosnian Serb leader Hadovan Karadzic has said he is willing to consider the proposals. 
But Karadzic is caught be­tween hard-line nationalists who oppose concessions and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who needs sanctions lifted. It is clear that Milosevic, not Karadzic, would benefit. 
Milosevic's Socialists face parliamentary elections next month. Despite hyperinflation, 50 percent unemployment and plummeting living standards, they are likely to win. 
Milosevic has convinced Serbs their problems stem from sanc­tions, rather than his own poli­cies of financing Serb rebels abroad and printing money. 
If he can even hint during the campaign that sanctions may be eased, the Socialists will be unbeatable. 
Karadzic had to fight strident Serb nationalists at home and promise no more compromise to win approval of the previous plan. 
Cardenas rejects debate; opposition to name candidate 
By JOHN RICE 
A.~sociated Press 
MEXICO CITY 
Mexico's largest opposition party prepared to name its presidential candidate Sunday and another opposition leader turned down a challenge to de­bate NAFTA as it goes before the Senate. 
Senate approval of the free trade pact is assured. The gov­erning Institutional Hevolutionary Party, or PHI, controls 61 of the 64 Senate seats. The vote, the only re­quirement to ratify the pact, is scheduled for Monday. 
Federal congressman Diego Fernandez de Cevallos was the favorite to win the nomination of the National Action Party as its candidate for the August 1994 presidential election. 
But Fernandez is given little chance to end the PRJ's 64-year hold on power in the election. Within the coming weeks, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will select the PRI can­didate, who is practically as­sured victory. 
Fernandez also starts the campaign with far less popular appeal than the Democratic Hevolution Party's Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who is again seeking the presidency after running a strong opposition campaign in 1988. 
Fernandez, a 52-year-old lawyer and professor, leads his party's bloc in the Chamber of Deputies, Mexico's equivalent of the House of Hepresentatives. 
National Action, known as the PAN, is Mexico's second-largest

Arafat orders PLO troops to move to self-rule 
By SALAH NASRA WI Associated Press 
TUNIS, Tunisia 
Yasser Arafat has ordered PLO troops in Arab countries to prepare to move into Palestinian self-rule zones after Israel withdraws from occupied territories, a top PLO official said Sunday. 
The Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, who is commander-in-chief of PLO forces, is believed to have is­sued the orders Wednesday. 
Omar Khatib, a liaison officer in charge of Palestinian forces, told The Associated Press in Jordan that up to 3,000 men will assemble in the Jordan Valley bordering Israel and move into the West Bank town of Jericho as soon as Israel gives its approval. 
He estimated that in all, 8,000 PLO fighters will regroup in Jordan and Egypt for rede­ployment in the self-rule zones -Jericho and the Gaza Strip -as policemen. 
Under the peace accord signed by the PLO and Israel on Sept. 13, security in the two occupied zones will be handed over to the PLO after Israel withdraws. Israeli troops are to begin pulling out Dec. 13. The agreement authorized a 
party, but it trails far behind the PRJ, which has run Mexico since it was founded in 1929. 
The PAN has won several major city halls and two gover­norships since 1988 -the only two that the PRJ has ever ad­mitted losing. 
Its free-market, business-ori­ented philosophy is close to the ideology of Salinas, but it criti­cizes the government as un­democratic and too centralized. 
The PAN has also shed some of the intensely nationalist, Roman Catholic aspects of its platform, causing some of the party's old leaders to form a splinter faction, the Democratic Forum, earlier this year.

"strong police force" that will be armed. 
The rest of the occupied territories will gain autonomy later and the final status of the land seized by Israel in 1967 will be determined by negotia­tions during a five-year interim period. 
The PLO expects the accord to lead to an independent Palestine with Israel-annexed Arab east Jerusalem as its capital. 
The two sides, meeting in se­cret talks in Cairo, have been working on details of the Palestinian security in the zones. 
Arafat ordered PLO troops in Iraq to move to Jordan and guerrillas in Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Algeria to move to Egypt, PLO officials said. 
Israeli Police Minister Moshe Shahal said Saturday that Israel will accept the deploy­ment of up to 15,000 Palestinian policemen. Shahal told Radio Israel the force could have armored personnel carriers and light weapons. 
In addition to roughly 8,000 PLO troops to be brought in from other countries, as many as 7,000 Palestinians from the territories will be recruited for the new police force.

Leaks led to subpoena of diaries .1r'House rejects D.C. hid 
By H. JOSEF HEBERT 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Sen. Bob Packwood had de­cided to resign, but changed his mind after congressional staffers leaked his intentions to the Justice Department, prompting a subpoena for his diaries, a leading Republican lawmaker said Sunday. 
"He was ready to resign, he wanted out," Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming said on CBS' "Face the Nation." Simpson accused staffers of the Senate Ethics Committee of thwarting the resignation by leaking word of it to Justice Department lawyers. 
When informed of Packwood's plans, Justice Department lawyers scrambled to issue a formal request for the Oregon Republican's diaries, guarding against their possible destruction once Packwood left the Senate. 
Simpson, a friend of Packwood's, said after Packwood was served with the subpoena Friday, he "had no choice but to stay in the Senate" where he could better defend himself against possible criminal charges. 
After the subpoena was is­sued. any attempt to destroy the diaries would leave Packwood, 61, open to charges of obstructing justice. 
The diaries are central to a Senate investigation into sexual harassment allegations involv­ing complaints from more than two dozen women who said that the Oregon Republican had made unwelcome sexual ad­vances to them over the years. 
Simpson said he would seek an investigation into what role ethics panel staffers might have played in the timing of the Justice Department subpoena. 
Spokesmen for the Ethics Committee and for Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., the panel's chairman, did not return tele­phone messages Sunday. 
The Justice Department's in­terest stems from reports that some entries in the diaries might involve possible conflicts of interest, especially on whether Packwood's defense of Mitsubishi Electronic Co. against unfair trade practice charges might have been linked to a job offer his former wife had received from a company lobbyist. 
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas also said Sunday that Packwood saw an opportunity to elude the inves­tigations by resigning. 
"I think he was close to res­ignation," said Dole. "(But) about that time, the Justice Department came through with the subpoena and he decided not to resign." 
Both Simpson and Dole said the controversy has taken a heavy toll on Packwood, who won re-election to a fifth term last year only days before re­ports of his alleged sexual im­proprieties became public. 
"He's going through a terri­ble, personal turmoil," said Simpson. "He was ready to re­sign, he wanted out. The pain of it, the hounding of it, he wanted to visit with the Ethics Committee one-on-one... (and) that was denied to him." 
Dole said he also was con­cerned about the impact the in­vestigations have had on Packwood's health. "We talked about that. I think he's OK," said Dole on NBC's "Meet the Press." 
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, also on NBC, declined to say whether Packwood should re­sign. "That's his decision," said Mitchell. 
Senate leader is confident Brady Bill will become law 
ByCAROLYNSKORNECK 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
The Brady bill to require a waiting period for handgun purchases has been battered by amendments and political brinksmanship but is sure of enactment, the Senate's Democratic leader said Sunday. 
"The question of timing re­mains up in the air, but the re­sult is not in doubt," Majority Leader George Mitchell said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "It will become law."

However, he said, for that to happen this year, Congress may have to be called back into ses­sion after Thanksgiving ­something the members are loathe to do. 
Attorney General Janet Reno, appearing on CNN's "Late Edition," said, "Ninety-two per­cent of the American people support the Brady bill and it deserves to become law." 
Rep. Charles Schumer, D­N.Y., the bill's chief House sponsor, sounded somewhat pessimistic.

The Senate version includes in the fine print provisions that would: 
• Allow licensed dealers from different states to sell to others face to face. 
"This would allow traveling gun merchants to sell any guns out of the trunks of their cars,"

Schumer contended that Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, a mem­ber of the National Rifle Association board, had blocked any version of the bill other than the one passed by the Senate. He urged other Senate Republicans to prevail upon Craig to drop that position. 
The Senate as a whole has left town. However, key mem­bers remain and they could pass legislation by unanimous consent of their party brethren unless any individual member objects. 
Craig spokesman David Fish said he did not know whether Craig planned to block versions of the bill not passed by the Senate. "When the conference occurs, people will know what people's positions are," he said. 
Schumer said that if the House version of the Brady bill were given a chance, it would get a majority of votes from both chambers.

155 are confirmed dead in Macedonia plane crash 
ByKONSTANTIN TESTORIDES Associated Press 
OHRID, Macedonia 
Hescue workers struggled Sunday to recover the charred remains of 115 people killed when their plane crashed in the rugged, snowy mountains of southwestern Macedonia. 
Only one person aboard the Avioimpex charter flight sur­vived the crash late Saturday night, officials said. A U.N. re­lief worker from war-torn Bosnia was among those killed. 
Villagers, police and airport workers found the fuselage still ablaze when they reached the crash site. Bodies, luggage and debris from the aircraft were scattered about the hillside. 
Policeman Mladen Dimovski described the wreckage as "a virtual torch." 
"It was hard to reach the spot, let alone put out the flames," he said. 
The Soviet-made Yak-42 had flown over the Ohrid airport once late Saturday and was making a second attempt to land when it went down about four miles east of the airport. 
The plane, leased from the Russian carrier Aeroflot, was on a charter flight from Geneva to the Macedonian capital Skopje, but had to divert to Ohrid, 65 miles to the south­west, because of a blizzard at Skopje airport. 
Libya has paid lawyer for advice on bomb case 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 
A lawyer representing fami­lies of five victims of the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing has been paid by the Libyan gov­ernment for advice on turning over two suspects in the case, according to a published re­port. 
Lawyer F. Lee Bailey trav­eled to Libya in August to advise officials on how judicial systems work in various coun­tries in the event that Libya decided to turn the suspects in, The National Law Journal reported in its Monday edition. 
Bailey told the Journal he saw no conflict in representing the victims' families while advising the Libyans on "what the means of surrender should be. The families would be in favor of that. The purpose of my going there was to facili­tate their return to some­where." 
Libyan intelligence agents Abdel Basset Ali Al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah have been indicted in the United States and in Scotland, where the plane was flying when it exploded, on charges that they planted and detonat­ed the bomb that killed 270 people in 1988. 
Bailey said he did not inform his clients of the visit to Libya because it had not been made public. He also stressed that he was not representing the suspects, but merely advising the government on options for their surrender. 
Elizabeth Phillips, former president of Victims of Pan Am 103, said she did not think the families "would want to have him represent Libya." 
Bailey said he told the Libyans the United States will not "settle for anything less than a Scottish trial," and that even an acquittal there would not stop further prosecutions, he told the Journal. He said the Libyans found his advice "not helpful, not cheerful." 
Phone numbers for three of the five families Bailey repre­sent!: were unavailable Sunday. The other two, Florence Ergin of Hartford, Conn., and Norma Leckburg of Cape May, N.J., declined to comment.

Goran Pavlovski, head of the government commission inves­tigating the crash, said the pilot apparently lost control of the plane, despite good visibility and favorable landing condi­tions. 
Officials said 80 percent of the 108 passengers were Yugoslav citizens, most of them ethnic Albanians. 
A French field officer from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees was among the dead. Pierre Oilier, who was in his mid-20s, was headed to a new assignment in Skopje after working in Bosnia-Herzegovina, UNHCR spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said in Geneva. 
The rest were believed to be Macedonian, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported. 
The four members of the flight crew were Russian and the four cabin crew members were Macedonian. 
The sole survivor, a Serb, underwent surgery to stop bleeding in his left lung. He was listed in critical condition. 
A nurse at the scene said four children were among the vic­tims. 
The plane's two black boxes were found intact, Pavlovski said. Russian experts were ex­pected to join the investigation Tuesday. 
Avioimpex is one several air­lines that have sprung up in Macedonia since it split from Yugoslavia last year, overtaxing the new country's airports. 
Macedonia used to be a back­water served by only one or two flights a day. 
That was all changed by in­ternational sanctions on neigh­boring Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, imposed for its role in the ethnic fighting in Bosnia­Herzegovina. 
Passengers from Yugoslavia started converging on Skopje, which at 25 miles from the bor­der became the most con­venient airport for flights to Western Europe. 
The sanctions also ban com­mercial air traffic, grounding Yugoslavia's flag carrier JAT, so many ethnic Albanians from Serbia's southern province of Kosovo fly via Macedonia. 
Caution against military strike voiced 
By JIM ABRAMS 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
The size of the North Korean army and its proximity to the South Korean border compli­cate possibilities for an Israeli­style pre-emptive strike on North Korea's nuclear facilities, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Sunday. 
"I would caution about not having too easy an analogy to what Israel did with Iraq" when it 1981 it bombed a facil­ity near Baghdad believed to house Iraq's nuclear weapons program, Christopher said on ABC's "This Week with David Brinkley." 
About 70 percent of North Korea's force of 1.1 million is massed along the demilitarized zone dividing the two Koreas and only 30 miles from the South Korean capital of Seoul. 
Newsweek, in its edition to be released Monday, cites a classi­fied Pentagon study completed in 1991 that concludes that a quick, massive North Korean attack would overwhelm the 650,000 Korean and 36,000 American troops defending the South. 
Christopher, speaking from Seattle where he was attending an Asian-Pacific economic sum­mit with President Clinton, said there were no plans to increase 
U.S. military presence on the peninsula. 
"I don't have any question in my mind but the North Koreans know that we're there firmly and with a good deal of resolve," he said. "I don't think we need to reinforce our troops there, but if that need comes, I have no question the president will do it." 
North Korea, an isolated communist state, has raised concerns by barring the International Atomic Energy Agency from inspecting a facil­ity where it is believed it is building an atomic bomb. 
Christopher stressed that "we need to exhaust diplomatic means" to defuse the crisis, but that no options had been ruled out. 
He acknowledged that eco­nomic sanctions would have only a limited effect because "North Korea's in a time warp," already cut off from the economic vitality enjoyed by most of the rest of Asia.

Mother of six searches for child care solution 
By DAVE TYLER 
News Writer 
When Kate McMahon tells you she's happy that Notre Dame will be opening a Day Care Center next year, believe her. As a single mother of six, she knows of what she speaks. 
McMahon is a typical working mother, but as she will tell you, there's nothing "typical" about it. McMahon received a mas­ter's degree in Science Administration from Notre Dame this past May, after earn­ing her bachelor's in theology in 1991. She now works at South Bend's St. Joseph's Medical Center as a mission intern, a position that explores and examines hospital-patient­community relations. 
She is active in her children's PTA, and their church youth groups. Somewhere amongst all this, she finds time to cook, clean, and raise a family as a divorced mother in the con­stantly changing University Village. 
Kate McMahon's daily routine reads like a Charles Dickens novel; it never seems to end. She's up at six every morning, making sure her kids get breakfast and get off to school. She drops her youngest off at a local day care center, and then heads to work for nine hours. Afternoons and evenings are a swirling cloud of transporting children to and from different activities, conferences, appoint-

ments, and hurried dinners. Then the hard part: convincing the kids its time to do home­work. "Sometimes I feel more like a taxicab than a mother," admits McMahon. On top of all that, she takes classes as well. It's a delicate balancing act that McMahon says she's learned to handle. 
If there's one conclusion that all this activity leads to, it is a need for day care. It is some­thing McMahon is familiar with, and something she holds some strong beliefs about. "There were times when I almost walked into the Dome and vol­unteered to start a program myself." Understandably so. "Quality child care is something that's hard to find," McMahon said. "Its comforting to know that you're leaving your kids with someone you trust. Its an enormous weight off of your shoulders as a parent." 
That's why McMahon likes the idea of University child care so much. She's been hoping for four years that a University sponsored program would open up. Not only does it give her a place to take her daughter, it gives her peace of mind. "My youngest will enter kinder-
University of Pittsburgh's Child Development Center adapts to demands of its students and faculty 
By KATHY HAUSMANN 
News Writer 
University of Pittsburgh's University Child Development Center (UCDC). shows how important child care facilities are to students, and how they can adapt to fit students' needs. 
UCDC opened in 1984, and its program is searching for a new, larger facility. There are cur­rently 132 children in the UCDC, ranging from 6 weeks to 9 years old. The center is open 51 weeks of the year, can accommodate both students' and faculty's flexible schedules, and now offers evening hours. 
Currently located at the cen­ter of the campus, the 1993-94 budget for the Pittsburgh facili­ty is $700,000. For students, costs not subsidized by the uni­versity are based on the com­bined income of the parents. For faculty and staff, the child's age determines cost, with infant care more expensive than toddlets or older children. 
Sherry Cleary, director of the UCDC, says student "parents need reasonable costs but qual­ity care, and someone needs to subsidize it." 
As far as staff, Cleary's phi­losophy is to "hire the most excellent staff you can find. You want people you can trust and who will commit to the univer­sity." 
Steve Parks, a graduate stu­dent at Pitt with two children at the center, says the facility is "wonderful. I can't imagine any university not having a cen­ter." 
Before he had his children at the University's center, Parks worked several jobs to cover costs of child care. 
Lori Shorr, Parks' wife, believes if it was not for the center, she "would not be in graduate school" because she "couldn't afford care." 
She believes the biggest bene­fit of the center is that it gives her "guilt-free" time to "pursue (her) academic goals to make (her) a better person and moth­er." 
Only within the last year has the UCDC become "student­friendly," with 40% of the enrolled children having stu­dent parents. Before that, many were unhappy with the center. 
Shorr formed a coalition to discuss the child care situation on campus. The coalition worked on a proposal, based on polls of other university child care facilities as examples for improvment. 
Shorr said "This program has really turned around to be more interested in students' needs." 
ND/SMC plans child care expansion for next year 
By DAVE TYLER 
News Writer 
The Early Childhood Development Center, Inc. (ECDC) was established to offer full and part time child care to the staff. faculty, and students of St. Mary's and Notre Dame. 
Because of a gowing waiting list, the ECDC has found it nec­essary to expand. Starting next year, the ECDC, located in Havican Hall at St. Mary's, will open another site on Bulla Rd. across from the O'Hara-Grace Graduate Residences. 
The goal of the child care program is to foster "social, emotional, physical, cognitive and creative development in each child, through experi­enced based, hands-on activi­ties and play." 
"We don't have a curriculum, per se," says Kosik. "We have learning activities that range from feeding ducks in a pond, to taking field trips to see art and music." 
Teachers, parents, and even Notre Dame and St. Mary's stu­dents are involved in the cen­ter's daily activities. Some stu­dents volunteer their time, working for credit towards their degrees. Parents are allowed to walk in at any time and help. Teachers are emi­nently qualified, both profes­sionally and medically. 
"We view the program as an extension of the family, in a way that provides support for the parents, not unnecessary stress," said Kosik. 
The main difference between the new center and the old are new measures designed to eliminate the waiting list. 
"We want to be more accessi­ble to varied time, economic and work schedules," states Kosik. Four crucial additions should make this possible. 
First, the Notre Dame center will accommodate two year olds. St. Mary's previously only accepted 3-6 year olds. 
Second, the center will be open longer, from 5:45 a.m. to 6:00p.m. 
Third, the Center will have a longer operating year than St. Mary's, from 35 to 49 weeks. 
Lastly, the tuition structure will differ. The Notre Dame center will offer income based scholarships, while St. Mary's will continue to give a flat rate to all families, with the oppor­tunity to receive scholarships. 
garten in the fall, but its nice to have a place to take her if I need to." 
McMahon's idea of child care points to a philosophy that is often over looked. Besides eas­ing parental concerns about safety and peace of mind, a daycare should do more. "I think kids need time to be kids," she said. "Challenge them to learn and grow, but give them time to do it. Give them a learning environment that allows them to explore everything around them. It's [Youth] a wonderful time in life that they should enjoy to its fullest. We're just asking them to grow up too fast today." 
The new branch of the ECDC is a welcome addition for Kate McMahon. She's glad to see the university meeting the needs of the community. "So many stu­dents return here after gradu­ating to do post graduate work. And many times, they bring their families with them. By offering quality, affordable, and convenient child care, the University is helping to live up to its mission, and supporting the people who love the school." 
Kate McMahon is probably at work right now, whether it's at St. Joseph's or at being a mom. It's a challenge she has to meet daily. And doing it by herself is no small task. But now she'll have a little help.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Other dangers must be consid­ered as well as drunk driving 
Dear Editor: 
I couldn't agree more with David Kinney's Inside Column (The Observer, Nov. 16). I especially think we should now get behind John Hita and give him support which is indicative of the level of com­passion of this Notre Dame community. 
But I question whether you or any of your fellow students has given thought to the prob­lems: drunk driving, not being able to get a cab, or being on the wrong side of the road­way. 
'what can the com­
munity do to pre­vent this tragedy from ever happening again?' 
Or have you addressed how to prevent such a tragedy in the future? 
The problem of people walking along the road in the dark is not just a problem unique to Notre Dame. Haven't all of us been taught to walk along the road facing the traffic? Why were all these people walking with their baeks to the traflic? I am not saying the tragedy wouldn't have happened if they were walking on the side facing the traffic. but common sense suggests that they prob­ably would have been in bet­ter control or the situation and possibly could have jumped out of the way of the car. 
It seems that this situation of being on the wrong side of the road is growing! I had to

swerve just last week to avoid hitting a person jogging along the road. And he, too. was on the wrong side of the road. I hadn't had any alcohol, but I could possibly have hit the person. Too often I've encoun­tered the problem right here on campus! Please wake up, face the traffic, and if at all possible, wear a reflective vest (They normally cost less than $10 at most sporting goods stores, and they can be folded and put into one's pocket for use when needed) when out after dusk. 
Why did Mr. Hita's so-called friends allow him to drive drunk? What can the commu­nity do to prevent this tragedy from EVER happening again? Can the students form some alliance which would provide taxi service to fellow students who cannot get a ride from a taxi service? Can better efforts be made to better inform all. not just the stu­dents. but the entire commu­nity of how to avoid this mis­take of all these young peo­ple? 
We need to inform everyone of the danger of being out with a bicycle after dark, too. How often this past summer did I see young people out with no lights on their bicy­cles? And who is at fault when someone is run over? 
Except for the grace of God, that could have been any number of people in John Hita's shoes Friday night. My heart goes out to him as well as the family of Mara Fox! !

Tragedy reveals that students do drive drunk 
Dear Editor: 
The thrill of the victory last weekend over Florida State was indeed deflated by the tragic accident that killed Mara Fox. To the Notre Dame Community, especially to her friends and family, memories of the win will forever inspire a terrible feeling of loss. Perhaps along with mourning we can attempt to learn something to prevent such tragedies from occurring again. 
Many ND students could have been John Rita. They are just lucky; Rita was unlucky. His behavior Friday night is not uncommon among the Notre Dame population. Drunk driv­ing is unfortunately socially ac­ceptable. I've heard many sto­ries of people driving drunk to or from off-campus parties or bars. Many times the serious­ness is downplayed: "I was just buzzed" or "I didn't drive far" or "I drove slowly". Well. I'm sure Hita had rationalizations for getting into his car as well. Rationalizations allow people to remove themselves from the reality that when someone gets behind the wheel and is drunk, that someone is a potential killer. 
It is only when this potential becomes reality that the sever­ity stings. Then it's too late. How must Hita feel now. realiz­ing that the consequences of his actions can never be undone and that he will forever live with this horrible truth? 
Nothing can be done after the act has occurred. Mara cannot be brought back. However, such actions can be prevented. Designated drivers should be a real option. Friends really shouldn't let friends drive drunk. Cabs and Weekend Wheels should really be uti­lized. And most importantly. people must realize that no one who gets behind the wheel while intoxicated is exempt from being John Rita. 
Next time you or someone you know gets behind the wheel when drunk, think of John Rita and Mara Fox. 
SARAH MCMAHON Senior Knon Hall 
Time for campus service organization at SMC 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in support of the Saint Mary's College Service Center (SMCSC) which is presently in the hands of the Board of Governance at Saint Mary's. 
I won't feign knowledge of the bureaucratic system on Saint Mary's campus. All I know is that an organization like SMCSC is needed at SMC and the advocates of the proposal are tired of jumping through bureaucratic loopholes to make it happen. 
It seems simple to me that Saint Mary's needs a vehicle through which its women can actually put their Christianity into action. Many of the faculty, staff and students are willing to put in the work to provide that vehicle. 
For some reason, Saint 
Mary's Board of Governance (BOG) is stalling the vote ... maybe in hope that it will be forgotten. WilY? 
If BOG continues to stall the vote, apathy will continue to nourish on Saint Mary's cam­pus. That is not to say most of the students are apathetic; they simply are not offered adequate opportunity to live out a call to service on this campus. This is paradoxical for a Catholic insti­tution that is 150 years old. Saint Mary's BOG should take pride in being pioneers in an effort to alleviate the frustrated students called to Christian ser­vice. Instead of making service opportunity readily available at the single activities night of the year, we should have these options open to students at all times. 
Spes Unica Hesource and Volunteer Center (SUHV) is a paradigm example of student desire to serve. But, the hours and staff are limited. and the students who run it may feel that it is often a thankless task with a small budgnt and not mueh publicity. With SMCSC, SUHV could still have its auton­omy, but its scope would just be expanded. 
It is time BOG approves a campus service organization at Saint Mary's. It is necessary and long overdue. Financial support will definitely come from alumnae and Saint Mary's supporters who see the unfor­tunate gap between rhetoric and reality at Saint Mary's. It is time for the women of Saint Mary's to speak up and support SMCSC.

Destiny Denied 
BC field goal erases classic con1eback 
By GEORGE DOHRMANN Sports Editor 
To control your own destiny and then have that power quickly swept away. 
That is the harsh reality which swept over Notre Dame Stadium Saturday, as the Irish watched Boston College kicker David Gordon connect on a 41-yard field goal as time expired, giving the Eagles a 41-39 win. 
Gordon's kick negated an inspiring comeback by the Irish, who scored 22 points in a little over ten minutes. It also knocked Notre Dame from No. 1 to No. 4 in the polls after a mere week-long reign at the top. 
"It was a great football g-ame, with lots of excitement," said Boston College coach Tom Coughlin. "All we ask for is great effort and we got it. I'm very happy, but humble." 
The win probably cost the Irish a chance at the national championship. A likely matchup with Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl is gone, with hopes of a national title hinging on losses by as many as three teams. 
"It would have been an unbelievable victory," said Irish head coach Lou Holtz. "To be down so far and to come back and have it within your grasp with a minute to go, it's heartbreaking."

Final home game rarely sweet for Irish seniors 
By TIMOTHY SEYMOUR Assistant Spons Ediwr 
Notre Dame Stadium. The Gipper and the four horsemen. 59,075 in the stands for every snap. The dome and touch­down Jesus watching from above. 
These things comprise the vaunted Notre Dame mystique, and are the reason opposing coaches consider Notre Dame the most difficult place to play in college football. 
Players coming to live under the dome expect to win at Notre Dame. They especially expect to win at home, even taking it for granted. If nothing else, the ghosts of Irish past will ensure victory. 
In almost every season win­ning at home is the rule. Notre Dame is 50-17-1 in the last twelve years at Notre Dame Stadium. However, this year's seniors fell victim to a disturb­ing exeeption to this rule. In the same twelve year span, the Irish are a dismal 5-7 in their final home game of the season. 
To a man, the Irish seniors seemnd stunned by the loss. 
''I'm numb," stated Pete Bereich, rarely at a loss for words. 
''I'm in total self-denial right now," said captain Aaron Tay­lor. 
It's unfortunate, but the last time the seniors head through the hallowed tunnel can make or break their season. 
In 1991, the Irish were on a seven game winning streak when Hob Leonard's last sec­ond field goal was partially bloeked. Tenessee eseaped Notre Dame Stadium with a 35­34 upset, leaving the Irish se­niors with permanently scarred memories from their days at home. 
Last season, the opposite was true. Notre Dame's talented senior class of Rick Mirer, Reg­gie Brooks, Irv Smith, and Demetrius DeBose had been termed a disappointment, tying Michigan and getting blown out at home by Stanford. 
Hosting Penn State for their last home game was a chance at redemption. After Mirer capped a rousing last minute drive with a two point conver­sion pass to a diving Brooks in the endzone, the season was a success and the seniors could leave their fans in the glow of victory. 
Saturday's loss becomes all the more frustrating for the Irish seniors, because they didn't have the star names their predecessors did. What they did have was detremination, whieh brough them the No. 1 ranking last year's stars couldn't achieve. 
"It's something you dream about (the national champi­onship)," stated senior captain Jeff Burris, whose all purpose excellence couldn't single hand­edly stop the Boston College machine. "To have that taken away, it's not too pleasing." 
Taylor echoed these senti­ments. "That's the last game I'll ever play in that stadium," he said. "It's disappointing that I'll have to walk away on a down note." 
None of the seniors wanted to walk away. On the fateful last Eagle drive, Taylor and fellow captain Tim Ruddy walked out to o11'er encouragement to their defensive counterparts. 
"They pretty much said, 'We still have a chance. Believe in yourself,"' stated senior Bryant Young. 

Above all, this senior class believed in itself and the Notre Dame tradition. Because. of this, losing their final game in the stadium is that much more painful. . 
"I feel for the seniors," stated coach Lou Holtz. "We all hurt." Still, this year's seniors showed class to the end. 
"This isn't a guessing game," stated Burris. "It's a game of' execution, and Boston College executed better than we did. We have to deal with it and keep moving." 
"We didn't quit," stated senior quarterback Kevin McDougal, who had his best passing game ever. "I'm glad to be on a team like this, where all the guys keep playing hard." 
"Maybe we should go out and beg," joked Taylor. "In a one game shot, they were the better team." 
As Holtz noted after the game, "It's not my style to cam­paign." That rings true for the seniors, who suffered through the most heart-wrenching loss of their careers with dignity. 
That may be what Notre Dame tradition is really about.

Notre Dame had taken the lead a minute before Gordon's kick, when quarterback Kevin McDougal hit Lake Dawson on a four-yard touch­down pass on fourth down with 
1:09 remaining. It was the third score in the fourth quarter for Notre Dame, who trailed 38-17 with eleven minutes left. 
A personal foul against the Irish on the ensuing kickoff gave Boston College the ball at their own 25 instead of their ten. Eagle quarter­back threw incomplete to tight end Pete Mitchell on the first play, and on the second misfired on a pass that went right through the hands of Irish linebacker Pete Bereich. 
"I had the ball and I missed it," said Bereich. "It hit me right in my hands. I'm just numb right now." 
Foley and the Eagle offense caught fire from that point. The senior quarterback hit Mitchell on passes of 12 and 24 yards and .flanker Ivan Boyd for nine more to put Gon;lon in the position for the game winner, the longest kick of his career. 
His kick started right and then darted through the uprights. Joyous Boston College fans imme­diately flooded the field, creating a mob of players, coaches and fans. Some Notre Dame players walked slowly toward the sidelines, others fell frozen to the ground in disbe­lief. 
"l knew I could make the kick," said Gordon. "I got good protection from the line and a good hold. I didn't hit it well, it was kind of low, but it went through." 
The drive was just another in a day full of breakdowns for the Irish defense. 
Notre Dame showed no pass rush to speak off and the usually depen­dent secondary looked a step slow from the opening play. Foley com­pleted 30-48 passes for 315 yards and four touchdowns and fullback Darnell Campbell ran for 132 yards on only 13 carries. 
However, despite the big num­bers, the Irish defense had the game and their season on the line in the final drive, and failed to make the plays. 
"We just didn't execute and they did," said safety Jeff Burris. "We finally got the lead but weren't able to hold." 
Burris and the rest of the Irish seniors watched their final game at Notre Dame turn sour. It was the seventh time in the last 12 years that Irish seniors have gone out losers in their last home game. 
"I don't think you can get any lower than we are now," said Jim Flanigan. 
Boston College controlled every facet of the game until the final ten seconds. They took a 10-0 lead at the end of the first quarter on a Gordon field goal and a four-yard pass from Foley to Boyd. 
The maintained their lead in the second quarter. After Notre Dame cut the lead on a 39-yard pass from McDougal to fullbaek Hay Zellars, Boyd scored his second touchdown on a 36-yard touchdown grab. 
The Irish countered with a one­yard run by Jeff Burris, but Boston College added a score from Mitchell with 21 seconds left, to go ahead 24-14 at the intermission. 
"We were able to move the foot­ball by running and throwing," said Foley. "We had great protection from the line and we can do any­thing if we get good protection." 
Campbell had a 21-yard score to open the third, and after a .Kevin Pendergast field goal cut the lead to 31-17, Foley hit Mitchell from the one to raise Boston College's

The Irish awoke at that point, scoring on a 29-yard run by tail­back Lee Becton and a four-yard run by Zellars after the Irish defense forced Foley and Co. to punt. 
Becton finished the day with 123 yards on 14 carries for his Notre Dame record sixth-straight 100­yard day. lie also eclipsed 1000 yards on the year, only the second back to do that in the Holtz era. 
But he would trade all the records for a win, which the Irish seemed to have after Dawson's catch and before Gordon became the unlikely hero. 
"This loss is devastating," said Holtz. "It hurts.

"This win absolutely means more," said Foley. "Last year we felt they rubbed it in a little."

This year it would be different. That was the quiet goal of the Boston College football team at the beginning of the year. 
Last year's 54-7 loss to the Irish had been an embarrassment. This year it would be different. 
The Eagles entered Saturday's game in a much different frame of mind. There would be no talk of the supremacy of Catholic schools. It would be a football game played by talented athletes, but important to the Boston College mindset, talented on both sides of the ball. 
"They're human beings," said Eagle quarterback Glenn Foley, who single­handedly picked apart the Irish defense in a manner Heisman favorite Charlie Ward couldn't. "Last year we came in here thinking they were larg­er than life. It was a devastating loss." 
Boston College never forgot. They heard the "Overrated" cheer in their sleep. They saw the fake punt on film time and again. And most important­ly, they believed they could beat the Irish. · 
"We have a totally different team this year," stated Boston College coach Tom Coughlin before the game. "This group is hungrier. They b'ave no room for complacency. They feel they haven't achieved a thing yet. Each week is a new exciting challenge for these guys."

CHARLES RICE RIGHT OR WRONG? 
Casting women as priests puts group in time warp 
On Nov. 8, the Committee on Notre Dame's Position on the Ordination of Women (CND­POW), Student Advocates for Inclusive Ministry and four other groups sponsored a panel on ministry and gender in the Catholic Church. Columns and letters in The Observer during the succeeding days focused on the women's ordination ques­tion. 
CNDPOW's recurrent agita­tion conveys the false impres­sion that women's ordination is an open question of civil rights on which politicized pressure tactics are appropriate. 
CNDPOW, in fact, has no rea­son for being. If this university is secular, why should anyone care what "Notre Dame's posi­tion" is on the ordination of women, any more than one should care about the position of General Motors or Burger King'? If, however, Notre Dame is Catholic as it claims to be in a sense, and as CNDPOW claims it to be that identity carries with it an obligation of fidelity to the clear position of the Vicar of Christ on the subject. 
As "Ex Corde Ecclesiae," The Apostolic Constitution on Catholic Universities, put it, "one consequence of [the Catholic university's] essential relationship to the church is that the institutional fidelity of the University to the Christian message includes a recognition of and adherence to the teach­ing authority of the church in matters of faith and morals." If Notre Dame is Catholic, its "position" on the issue is the Church's position and CNDPOW is superfluous. 
The teaching of the Church here is settled and the issue is closed. In his Sept. 16, 1987, address to the American bish­ops, Pope John Paul II stated 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

ture are. The Church's pastoral function ... is not simply a mat­ter of leadership such as could be conferred by the powers exercised in the civil realm... One would seriously mistake the nature of ministerial priest­hood were one to account it a right all human beings have; baptism does not give anyone a right to exercise a public min­istry in the Church. Priesthood ... is the object of a special and completely unmerit­ed call: 'It was not you who chose me; it was I who chose you.' (Jn 15, 16; see Heb 5,4) ... There are women who feel themselves called to the priest­hood. Such an inclination, how­ever, though noble and quite understandable, is not enough to prove a genuine vocation; a vocation is not reducible to a simple interior inclination, which of itself is purely subjec­tive. Since priesthood is a spe­cial ministry of which the Church has charge and control, a vocation also requires authentication by the Church as a constitutive element, for Christ chose 'the men he him­self had decided on' (Mk 3, 13). 
On the other hand, all the baptized do have a call to exer­cise the royal priesthood by offering their lives to God and bearing witness so that God is praised. Women who say they seek the ministerial priesthood are undoubtedly impelled by that "women are not called to the priesthood. Although the teaching of the Church on this point is quite clear, it in now way alters the fact that women 
are indeed an essential part of the Gospel plan to spread the Good News of the kingdom" 
(emphasis in original). 
On Jan. 30, 1977, Pope Paul VI said, "Why can men alone and not women, too, receive the priesthood? ... The reason for the disparity of function is Christ's decision in giving the Church her fundamental struc­ture and her theological anthropology ... Moreover, now that an answer has been given to this question, which some intemperate feminists have ren­dered unnecessarily vexing, we urge women to realize that the Church has no intention of underestimating the precious role they are called to play in the overall plan of God's king­dom and in the temporal sphere as well." 
The papal statements affirm that the church does not have authority to ordain women. It is not like meatless Fridays, com­munion in the hand, or celibacy of the clergy. 
The Declaration on the Ordination of Women, issued in 1976 with the approval of Paul VI, stated that "the Church, which intends to be faithful to the Lord's example, does not regard herself as having the authority to admit women to priestly ordination... The Catholic Church has never held the view that priestly or episco­pal ordination can be validly conferred upon women... It is for the Church to speak through the magisterium on these mat­ters and to determine which elements of the sacraments are immutable and which mutable. The Church is convinced that she may not admit certain changes because she knows that Christ has bound her to act in a certain way ... Behind her practice of conferring priestly ordination only on males lies a tradition coterminous with the history of the Church, universal throughout east and west, and ever watchful in order quickly to suppress abuses. Such a norm, based on the example of Christ, has been followed in the past and is being followed today because it is regarded as con­formed to God's plan for his church." 
CNDPOW responds to this set­tled position by seeking to change it through pressure tac­tics appropriate to the political arena. The Church, however, is not a political organization. And it is not a democracy. 
As Paul VI said in the 1976 Declaration, "It is necessary to keep before our minds how much the Church differs from other societies and how utterly unique her nature and struc-
Drinking mentality must change at ND/SMC 
Dear Editor: 
I heard about the accident on the news, like everyone else. I had the same feelings of horror and sadness that everyone had, I suspect. But there is some­thing more to this tragedy than just the feelings that come with it -there has to be more. 
There's a mentality at this school, and it's everywhere. It's in the administration building, it's in the dorms, it's at Grf)en Field on football weekends, and it's at the Linebacker every Thursday night. It is frighten­ing, and it can have conse­quences even worse than those that rocked the campus this weekend. The mentality? Getting drunk is an okay thing to do. 
Now I've never had a drink before, and so this is going to sound preachy. But maybe someone needs to be preachy about this. If there is something more to be found in the tragic death of Mara Fox, if there is a message and a lesson in all this pain, it is this: Getting drunk is not an okay thing to do. 
Now I'm not talking about a buzz, and I'm not talking about "feeling good." I'm talking about the kind of intoxication whieh keeps you from thinking straight, which prevents you from acting wisely, which makes you do things you would never do sober -the kind of intoxication that puts you behind the wheel on a rainy night at one in the morning after drinking all night. 
Things happen when you're that drunk. A random hook-up, an argument with friends, a fight, an injury. God knows some of those things have hap­pened to me when I was sober on a night out. But the chances of something really bad hap­pening are magnified tenfold when you don't know what 
'we need to figure 
out ways to prac­tice moderation our­selves, and not to depend on other people to do it for us.' 
you're doing, or you've lost con­trol through drinking. 
John Rita is not the only per­son who ever did something stupid when he was drunk. And this thing about "my friends will take care of me ... " -gimme a break. John Rita's friends didn't take care of him. 
Expecting someone else to "take responsibility" for you for a night is stupid. That kind of thing ended with grade school ­we are now all responsible for our actions, and "taking a night off" by drinking oneself into oblivion is to deny the responsi­bility which we claim as young adults. 
It's that same claim of respon­sibility that makes us cry out for an end to parietals and a more liberal drinking policy. But if we're going to act like kids and forfeit our responsibil­ity by getting trashed, how can we ask the Administration to treat us like adults? 
It scares me to see people really drunk. My sister and my close friends have born the brunt of my fear -they know I get very worried when they've been out drinking because I'm afraid they will get drunk and end up doing something they'll regret. But I've learned over the years that there is no such thing as moderation, and I trust my sister and my friends to practice to practice it. But drinking still frightens me because it carries the potential for losing control. 
The thing is, people think it's funny. I remember one night I played drunk to help get a friend out of a situation at a party -falling over myself, look­ing close to throwing up, star­ing blankly into space, the whole deal. The thing that struck me was that most people were laughing at me, high-liv­ing me, encouraging me to drink more. 
That scared me more than anything -that we find humor in someone else completely los­ing control. It was all a game ­a game not too far from the one John Rita played on Friday night. It shocked me to realize that at other times I, too, had found humor in similar situa­tions. But those situations sim­ply are not funny. 
This whole mentality has got to change. And it's not just the students' fault. The University has chosen not to deal with the alcohol issue with its head in­the-sand, keep-it-in-the-room policy.But before pointing fin­gers, we have to look at our­selves. Mara's death should not be just a sad event. It should be a moment of pause for each and every one of us. We need to re-examine the way we look at alcohol and its use. We need to figure out ways to practice moderation ourselves, and not to depend on other people to do it for us. Are we going to let this moment pass us by? 
I never knew Mara-I might have met her once. But there's something here at Notre Dame which binds us all together, weaves our lives into the rich, vibrant tapestry of our commu­nity. Let's not just remember Mara. Let's not just feel sad. Let's do something. Let's make a change.

the desire to serve Christ and the Church. Nor is it surprising that, having once become fully aware of the discrimination to which they have been subjected in the past in the civil sphere, they should desire the minister­ial priesthood. We must not overlook, however, the fact that the priesthood is not something to which the human person has an inherent right but depends on the working out of the mys­tery of Christ and his Church." 
In his World Youth Day address in Denver's McNichols Sports Arena, John Paul II said, "So many problems arise when people think of the Church as 'theirs,' when in fact, she belongs to Christ." He could have had CNDPOW in mind. Their cafeteria, pick-and­choose Catholicism symbolizes the receding tide of the sixties. 
By contrast, John Paul II rep­resents the wave of the Christian future, especially in his appeal to youth. The decline in vocations has bottomed out. Religious congregations, male and female, loyal to the Pope are experiencing remarkable growth. So are some diocesan seminaries. 
The CNDPOW types are in a time warp. Instead of voicing tiresome complaints about what they cannot change, they would better serve the Church and the Notre Dame community by encouraging prayer for increased vocations to the priesthood and religious life. And it would be a refreshing change if the Holy Cross priests at Notre Dame would openly and actively support the teach­ing of the pope on this and other issues.

AIDS quilt project needs your support 
Dear Editor: 
The misconceptions, fears, 
and lack of knowledge 
concerning AIDS has again sur­
faced at the University of Notre 
Dame. The NAMES Project 
AIDS Quilt continues to strug­
gle against these obstacles. 
I was able to view the 
NAMES Quilt in its entirety in 
Washington, D.C. in 1992 and 
this phenomenal experience 
was one which I will never be 
able to forget. 
Preliminary approval has 
been granted to Notre Dame to 
have a portion of the NAMES 
Quilt on display here in 
February. This is a project 
which has the potential to 
make a difference on campus 
by eliminating misconceptions, 
educating people about the 
reality of AIDS and inviting 
people to feel compassion 
rather than a need to judge 
people with HIV/AIDS. 
A project of this magnitude 
cannot occur without the help 
and support of the Notre 
Dame/Saint Mary's Community. 
Volunteers will be needed in 
helping to accomplish these 
very goals, so anyone interest­
ed in helping bring the NAMES 
Quilt to Notre Dame should 
look for notices or call the stu­
dent government office.

Atlanta halts Dallas winning streak with 27-14 upset 
Associated Press 
Once the Dallas Cowboys lost Emmitt Smith, they were lost as well. 
Smith was sidelined with a bruised right quadricep two minutes before halftime and the Cowboys, already missing injured quarterback Troy Aik­man, had their seven-game winning streak Sunday, losing 27-14 in Atlanta. 
"I took a knee to the quad," Smith said. ''I'll take whatever treatment is necessary and see how it goes." 
Dallas (7-3) had not lost since Smith returned from a two­game salary holdout at the start of the season. The Cowboys have a short week, playing Thanksgiving Day against Mi­ami. 
Atlanta's swarming defense, which shut out the Los Angeles Rams last week, blanked Dallas for nearly three quarters. Deion Sanders, one of the Falcons' best defenders, also contributed on offense by catching a 70­yard touchdown pass and high­stepping to the end zone with 
3:51 left. 
Even before Smith was hurt, 
he did little. He was held to 1 
yard on one carry and 9 yards 
on four passes from Bernie 
Kosar. 
"I was very upset," Smith 
said. "We were doing things on 
the field that we usually don't 
do. We weren't doing anything 
right." 
Atlanta (4-6) won for the fourth time in five games. "Some people said we 
wouldn't be here for this ball­game, but not only did we show up, we did a great job," Falcons coach Jerry Glanville said. 
Giants 7, Eagles 3 At Philadelphia, Phil Simms threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Mark Jackson on the first play of the fourth quarter and it was enough to beat the Eagles. The Giants (7-3) won at Veterans Stadium for the first time since 1987. New York went 6-10 last season. Philadelphia (4-6) lost its sixth in a row, its longest skid since a seven-game streak in 
1983. The Eagles tried Ken O'Brien and Bubby Brister at quarterback, but managed only 
Matt Bahr's 35-yard field goal midway in the third quarter. Broncos 37, Steelers 13 
At Denver, John Elway picked apart the NFL's No. 1 defense, completing 18 of 25 passes for 276 yards and one touchdown to beat Pittsburgh. Elway led the Broncos (6-4) to a 20-0 halftime lead. He threw for 230 yards in the first two quarters; the Steelers had been allowing only 226 yards per game. 
The Steelers (6-4) played without injured Barry Foster. His replacement, Leroy Thompson, lost a fumble at the Denver 5 on Pittsburgh's first possession. 
Dolphins 17, Patriots 13 At Miami, Steve DeBerg threw two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter and the Dolphins rallied past New England. De­Berg, the oldest player in the league at 39, completed 16 of 
27 passes for 252 yards and no interceptions. He was signed as a free agent after an injury to Scott Mitchell, who replaced injured Dan Marino. 
Mark Higgs ran for 108 yards for Miami (8-2), giving coach Don Shula his 326th career vic­tory. The Patriots (1-9) have lost five in a row, the last four games by a total of 11 points. They have dropped nine straight to the Dolphins. 
Bills 23, Colts 9 At Orchard Park, N.Y., Jim Kelly came back from last week's concussion and threw 
two touchdown passes that led the Bills over Indianapolis. Kelly was knocked out of a 23-0 
loss in Pittsburgh on Monday night. Thurman Thomas ran for 116 yards for Buffalo (8-2). 
The Colts (3-7) lost for the sixth time in seven games. They made five trips inside the Bills 10, but did not take advantage. 
Jets 17, Bengals 12 At East Rutherford, N.J., Boomer Esiason became the career passing leader among left-handed quarterbacks as New York dropped Cincinnati to 0-10. Esiason, acquired from the Bengals in the offseason, leads the AFC in passing. He threw for 192 yards and in­creased his lifetime total to 28,130, surpassing lefty Kenny Stabler. The Jets (6-4) won their fourth in a row, their longest winning streak since 1986. In the closing seconds, they gave the Bengals a safety instead of punting, then watched Cincin­
nati lateral several times as time ran out on the ensuing free kick. 
Bears 19, Chiefs 17 At Kansas City, Mo., Jeremy Lincoln intercepted a bobbled pass and set up Neal Ander­son's 1-yard touchdown run with 3:09 left that lifted Chicago over the Chiefs. Dave Krieg's pass could not be controlled by Jonathan Hayes deep in Kansas City ter­ritory, and Lincoln intercepted. On third down, Anderson scored. Marcus Allen scored on two short runs in the first 19 min­utes for Kansas City (7-3). Kevin Butler kicked two field goals later in the first half for the Bears (5-5). Packers 26, Lions 17 At Milwaukee, Chris Jacke kicked four field goals, includ­ing a go-ahead 34-yarder with 
9:03 left, and Green Bay beat Detroit. Edgar Bennett scored on two short runs for the Pack­ers (6-4). Green Bay ended the Lions' four-game winning streak and moved within one game of them in the NFC Cen­tral. 
Barry Sanders gained 75 yards on 17 carries for Detroit. He joined Eric Dickerson and Tony Dorsett as the only run­ners to gain 1,000 yards in each of his first five seasons. 
Oilers 27, Browns 20 At Cleveland, Marcus Robert­son intercepted three passes and Gary Brown ran for 194 yards as Houston beat the Browns for its flfth straight vic­
tory. The Oilers (6-4) matched the longest winning streak in team history, last accomplished in 1980. Houston intercepted four passes, recovered a fumble and blocked a punt. 
The Browns (5-5) lost their second straight game since coach Bill Belichick cut quar­terback Bernie Kosar. 
The crowd booed Belichick at the start of the game and chanted "Bill Must Go!" at the end. 
Raiders 12, Chargers 7 At San Diego, Jeff Jaeger kicked four field goals as Los Angeles defeated the Chargers. Jaeger kicked a pair of 20­yarders in the first half. He made a 3 7 -yard kick in the third quarter and a 27-yarder in the fourth quarter. The Raiders (6-4) won for the fourth time in six games.San Diego (4-6) saw Stan Humphries play for the first time in six weeks, but he was just 8-for-12 for 84 yards. Rams 10, Redskins 6 At Anaheim, Calif., T.J. Rub­ley replaced Jim Everett late in the third quarter, threw a touchdown pass and directed another drive to a field goal to rally Los Angeles. In a game matching two slumping teams with problems 
at quarterback, the Rams (3-7) ended a five-game losing streak. 
The Redskins (2-8) failed to score a touchdown for the sec­ond consecutive week and lost for the eighth time in nine games.

the victory. 
There was some debate about who to give credit for the goal, as there was some speculation that Ling never actually got his stick on the puck. 
Nonetheless, it counted and that is all that mattered. "We just cared about winning the game," noted Welch. 
The team had another chance to solidify the respect earned on Friday night, but the Lakers weren't going to be defeated twice on their home ice. LSSU came out with a suffocating de­fense and applied strong pres­sure on Louder. 
They scored twice each pe­riod, with the goals coming from six different skaters. Notre Dame could only muster 15 shots for the entire game and were never a threat. 
John Rushin did prevent the shut-out with his first goal of the season, but there was little else positive to come from Saturday's game. 
However, Friday's perfor­mance provided enough posi­tives for the weekend. "It was a great victory, " observed Schafer. 
"We kept playing and put ourselves in a position to win. To win on the road playing one of the top teams in the country is nice." 
The victory should help the team in the future, as well. First, it will further boost the confidence of the team. They proved to themselves that they can beat anyone in the nation. Second, it showed everyone else that Notre Dame hockey is for real. 
"Now that we beat them, peo­ple can tell our program is up and coming," said freshman winger Ryan Thornton, who is one of six freshman who con­tributed to Friday's big win.

ane. "Mike has been consistent not just throughout this season, but also his entire career. He ran very well at the Districts, and I feel that he has an excel­lent opportunity to earn All­America honors again this year." 
This year's team, however, is about more than just McWilliams. The senior cap­tain is backed up by an extremely strong supporting cast. This team depth has been the Irish's strong point all sea­son, and will be relied on today as much as it has been all sea­son long. 
In addition to McWilliams, the Irish will run juniors John Cowan, Nate Huder, J.R. Meloro, sophomores Derek Seiling and Joe Dunlop, and freshman Matt Althoff at to­day's meet. This talented field of runners may give the Irish a legitimate shot at the title, and should ensure them of their first finish in the top-three since 1990, when they finished third at Knoxville, Tennessee. 
The toughest competition for the Irish will come from top­ranked Arkansas, who will be vying for their fourth straight NCAA title. Also ranked ahead of the Irish are Iowa State, Col­orado, and Portland. Seventeen other teams will be up against the Irish, and a total of around 170 runners will toe the start­ing line. 

While much must be done in order to beat out this incredibly deep field of competitors, it is hard to recognize any one par­ticular factor that will enable the Irish to claim the national title. 
"There is no one factor that will make us run better than we have in the past," said Mike McWilliams. "J.H. Meloro's

Football crown Manor's second title in 1993 
By G.R. NELSON 
Sporrs Writer 
Two outstanding teams squared off at Notre Dame Stadium Sunday for the men's interhall championship, with Morrissey edging Stanford to claim a 9-7 victory and the crown. 
Morrissey used a balanced attack, a big play defense, and a little luck in completing its undefeated season. 
Morrissey, behind its strong offensive line, rushed for over 100 yards and passed for 82 yards. Scott Taylor played his usual near-perfect game, tak­ing only what the Stanford defense would give him and not making any mistakes. 
"Stanford had a great scheme and some good cover guys," said Morrissey quarterback and League MVP Scott Taylor. "I couldn't throw deep." Justin Kruer and Paul Lopach each rushed well for Morrissey. 
Morrissey opened the game with an impressive 64-yard drive, but Stanford's defense stuffed them at the goal line, forcing a field goal. 
"That stand set the tone for the whole game," said Taylor. "It was a classic battle." 
Early in the second half, Stanford marched 65 yards be­hind its great backs, Lamar Guillory and Chris Pollina. Guillory capped the drive with a strong 12-yard run. 
Morrissey then mounted an impressive drive, but was sti­fled late in Stanford territory. However, on their next play, Stanford fumbled, and 
health will contribute to any success we have. We're run­ning well right now, and I feel that this is the best team I've been on since I've been at Notre Dame." 
J.R. Meloro also could not seem to pinpoint any one fac­tor. but also recognized the strength and unity of the team. 
"It was a great feeling going out last week knowing what we needed to do and doing just that," Meloro said. "We just hope we can do the same things at this meet. Mike (McWilliams) will run a good race up front, and it's up to us to do the rest."

Morrissey captain George Heider made the huge recovery. "That was the key play in the game," said Reider. 
Four plays later, Justin Kruer sprinted around the end for a one-yard touchdown. Stanford refused to quit and promptly marched the length of the field. Morrissey defense stiffened, forcing a Stanford field goal at­tempt. 
The steady Chad Smock trot­ted onto the field for a game­winning attempt. Smock was the hero in Stanford's first two playoff games, but this game would be different. Smock's 28-yard attempt sailed wide right. 
"Morrissey is a class team and played a great game," said Stanford captain Chris Pollina. 
Stanford will be back, losing only two players to graduation. "It seems that championship dynasties always begin with a loss," said Stanford's Matt Dowd, "And our team will be a dynasty." 
Morrissey earned the cham­pionship. 
They were the best team all year long, and they backed it up Sunday. 
"It was a great ride,' said Morrissey senior tailback Justin Kruer "We enjoyed every mo­ment of it." And now it is time for Morrissey to enjoy the title. 
"God was with us today," said Morrissey's Reider. "It was a fitting end for a great season." 
The Manor may be establish­ing a dynasty of their own, adding a football championship to last spring's interhall basket­ball title. 
summed up the diagnosis of what must be done today. 
"We had talked with our ath­letes regarding a more aggres­sive start. I felt that this strat­egy worked out well for us, and we certainly don't need to head out any stronger at the National Championships,'' said Piane. "Mike McWilliams has run well for us lately, and responded

Bethany Riddle Senior P.W. QB 
Riddle has led the Weasel off­ense all year, as she continually coupled her touchdown passes with equally impressive rushing statistics. In the championship game, Riddle threw for one touchdown and caught a 70-yard flea-flicker to clinch the 13-7 win and the women's interhall championship. 
The Weasel defense set the tone early when senior Kath­leen Glines made a diving tack­le on a Badin sweep to force the Badin Attitude to punt. 
After stopping PW, Badin got the ball back and drove deep into Weasel territory. 
The Attitude then drove to the PW five but were unable to score. The PW defense came up with four straight stops with an aggressive pass rush and a tight secondary coverage. 
Glines, who forced Badin to throw the ball away on fourth down, was the leader of the Weasel defense. 
"It was a very aggressive game," said Glines. "I was determined to get to the quar­terback." 
After turning the ball over, the Badin defense was able to hold PW and force a punt. 
On the first play after the punt, Badin quarterback Shari Shepard threw a bomb to team­mate Erin Osborne for the score. The extra point was suc­cessful and Badin led 7-0. 
PW finally got the offense go­ing on their next possession. Quarterback Bethany Riddle threw deep to senior Jenny Tate to set up first and goal. The Badin defense then held tough on three consecutive plays to force a fourth and goal. 
On the fourth down play Rid­dle took the snap, rolled to her right and threw a strike to se­nior Bridget Graham for the score. 
The extra point was missed and Badin took a 7-6 lead into halftime. 
Glines explained her team's slow start. "We had to see what would work," noted Glines. "We remained confident in ourselves throughout the game." 
The Weasals quickly found 
out what would work in the 
second half when they came up 
with the biggest play of the 
game.

After losing yards on their first two plays, PW faced third and long from their own ten­yard line. Riddle took the snap, and tossed the ball to Tate. Af­ter faking the run Tate stepped back and looked to pass. She found Riddle streaking uncov­ered down the left sideline. Tate hit Riddle with a perfect pass and Riddle was able to run in 70 yards for the score. 
The flea-flicker, which turned out to be the game winner, put PW ahead 13-6. 
On Badin's next possession, Glines came up with another big play to stop a Badin drive. 
Sophomore Katherine Begert tipped a Badin pass and Glines was able to get under it for the interception. 
Badin, however, did not give up and forced the Weasels to punt after three straight downs. 
Again PW was able to hold the Badin offense. The Attitude faced a fourth and short with time running out on the clock. 
Badin attempted to throw for the first down but the pass was deflected. 
PW then took over with 40 seconds left in the game. The Weasals were able to seal the victory when Riddle connected on a 45-yard bomb to Graham. 
Despite the loss, Badin sopho­more Jill Satanek was happy with their season. 
"We wished it could have 
ended better," said Satanek, 
"But we played the best we 
could." 
Glines was obviously happy with the Weasels' aggressive play. 
"Our mission was to beat the 
Attitude with attitude," said 
Glines. 
The mission was accom­
plished and with it came a 
championship for Pasquerilla

goal," said Connelly. 
The beginning of the season was filled with disappointment for the Irish when a few run-ners decided not to return to the team, and when two of their top runners were hin­dered with injuries. But the team continued to believe they could accomplish their goal of qualifying for the NCAA's. 

"The season seemed to be full of a lot of hardships but looking back I feel It worked out for the best," said Siegel. "People stepped up when they needed to and we came together as a team." 
"It was rough at the begin­ning of the season," said Hood. "But as the season went on p·eople's confidence was brought up, knowing we were actually good and could do well."

SMC swimming and basketball teams kick off seasons 
Basketball drops two at Kalamazoo College 
Swimming strong at Wabash 
Observer Staff Report 
The Saint Mary's swim team got their season off to a good start this weekend in the Wabash Invitational. 
Participating in the meet was the University of Indianapolis, Wheaton College, DePauw Uni­versity, Transylvania, Vin­cennes, and Saint Mary's. 
Overall, the team placed about the same as last year, but they doubled their point total, according to coach Greg Janson. 
The Belles were strong in en­durance, but weak in speed due to the fact that they have been focusing on getting into shape in practices, Janson said. "We can go forever, but just 
not  as  fast  as  we'd  like,"  
Janson commented.  
However,  once  the  team  

gained confidence, their swim­ming improved. 
"I saw a spark when the team gained confidence. This confi­dence from Saturday will go far," Janson said. 
"It was a good team meet," he added. 
Freshman Shannon Kelleher broke the school record in the 500 free-style, and also in the 1650 free-style. She placed third in both events and also placed fourth in the 200 free­style.

As Ohio State players and coaches gathered at the Woody Hayes Athletic Center, they were left with many questions after a 28-0 defeat at Michigan. 
They returned for a brief team meeting Saturday evening with an uncertain future. 
The Buckeyes could have clinched a Rose Bowl berth with a victory over the Wolver­ines, but now must wait for the outcome of the Wisconsin­Michigan State game on Dec. 4 in Tokyo. A Wisconsin defeat would send Ohio State to Pasadena, Calif. 
"It'll be rough waiting for the Michigan State-Wisconsin game, but right now I'm the biggest Michigan State fan there is," said Buckeyes full-
SPORTS BRIEFS 
back Jeff Cothran. "I hate to depend on other teams to help us out." 
If Wisconsin wins a Rose Bowl trip, the bowl picture becomes clouded for the Buck­eyes. 
"We're still in the Rose Bowl picture, but after that, I'm not ready to talk about anything," Ohio State athletic director Jim Jones said Sunday. 
Jones said he had discussed the bowl situation with coach John Cooper, but he would not elaborate. 
Messages requesting com­ment from Cooper were not returned Sunday. 
"It's going to be hard waiting the next two weeks, but right now, we're dealing with this loss," quarterback Bob Hoying said. "To play all season and go undefeated until now, it's diffi-

cult to deal with." 
The Buckeyes are at a disad­vantage because they don't know who they will be playing in a bowl game or where it will be. 
"We don't know who we''re playing, so we can't really pre­pare for anybody," Cooper said Saturday. 
Hoying said that after a few days off, the team will return to working on fundamentals. 
Here are Ohio State's bowl options: 
-If Wisconsin loses or ties against Michigan State, Ohio State would be in the Rose Bowl. 
-If Wisconsin defeats Michi­gan State, the Badgers will rep­resent the Big Ten in the Rose Bowl. 
Wisconsin and Ohio State would end up tied for the league title with identical con­ference records of 7-1-1, but the Badgers would go to Pasadena because Ohio State more recently played in the Rose Bowl game. 
At halftime the Belles were down 42-36. In the second half they made some defensive ad­justments and played a better game, according to Wood. 
The leading scorer was Jen­nie Taubbenheim with 22 points, followed by Anne Mulc­ahy with 19. 
Taubbenheim also had 12 rebounds and Lori Gaddis had five assists. 
In the consolation game against Kalamazoo College on Saturday, the Belles lost 62-60. 
"It was a close game. There wasn't a big spread either way," said Wood. 
At halftime the score was 
tied at 30-30. 
With eight minutes left in the game Katie Lalli fouled out. With five minutes left, Taubbenheim also fouled out. 
"We were 5'7" and under at the finish," Wood said. Taubbenheim led the scoring with 16 points. 
Lalli had 11 rebounds, and Liz Vernasco and Michelle Limb each had three assists. 
"We are hurt by size and in­experience, but overall we played pretty well in both games. I was not disap­pointed," Wood said. 
After big win West Virginia wants respect 
By MAIT HARVEY Associated Pr$ss 
MORGANTOWN, W.Va. West Virginia remains unde­feated and unloved. 
Despite its 17-14 victory over Miami, the Mountaineers (10-0) moved up only four spots to No. 5 in The Associated Press poll released Sunday. And as one of only three undefeated teams left in Division 1-A, coach Don Nehlen believes his team de­serves better. 
"I believe that Nebraska or West Virginia should be No. 1, and if they're No. 1, I think we should be, too," Nehlen said Sunday. 
"But Florida State, regardless of what you say ... they have a loss on their record. And the team they lost to already lost a game. But we still have to play Boston College. And Boston College is probably the hottest team in college football." 
The AP's top four is Florida State (9-1), Nebraska {10-0), Auburn (11-0) and Notre Dame (10-1). 
The Mountaineers are third in the CNN-USA Today poll, behind Nebraska and Florida State. 
While West Virginia's players and coaching staff celebrated Saturday after becoming the first Big East team to beat Mi­ami since the conference start­ed in 1991, the Mountaineers turned their attention Sunday to No. 11 Boston College (8-2, 5­1). which beat Notre Dame 41­39. 
"They've won their last eight games and their offense is hit­ting on all cylinders," West Virginia safety Mike Collins said. "Glenn Foley is hot. lie's probably the hottest quarter­back in the country right now." 
"In the first half, we just didn't play well," Hurricanes quarterback Ryan Collins said.

McWilliams a leader again 
By DYLAN BARMMER Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's cross country season will come to an end today, as the Irish compete in the NCAA Cross Country Championships at Lehigh Uni­versity in Bethlehem, Pennsyl­vania. 
The fifth-ranked Irish team is coming otT a convincing win at the District IV Championships, and will be looking to improve on last year's sixth-place NCAA finish. 
The Irish will be led in their quest for the NCAA title by the indomitable Mike McWilliams, who is vying for his fourth straight All-American selection, a feat that has never before been accomplished by an Irish runner. The senior captain fin­ished 24th overall at last year's NCAA's, with a time of 31:34.1 in the 10,000 meter race. McWilliams was also the Irish's top finisher the two previous years, coming in 34th as a freshman, and 17th in his sophomore season. 
McWilliams' success is not lost on Coach Joe Piane, who can not say enough about his team captain. 
"Meet after meet Mike ex­emplifies what a captain should be to his teammates," says Pi-

Upstart women make first appearance 
By AMY GRIFFIN Sports Writer 
The women's cross country team will make their first appearance ever today in the NCAA championships at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa. 
The 17th-ranked Irish finished sec­ond at the District IV meet last weekend to secure an automatic bid to the NCAA's. 
The second-place finish marked the highest place the women's team has ever finished. Last year the team fell just short of qualifying for the championships when they placed fourth, which was the program's previous best finish. 
"One of our goals this year, and even for the program overall, has been to qualify for the National Championships," said Irish coach Tim Connelly. 
The team accomplished this goal at the District meet when three Irish runners finished in the top 10. Junior Sarah Riley placed fourth overall with a time of 
18:10.4. Teammates junior Kristi Kramer came in eighth at 18:30.7 and freshman standout Emily Hood finished ninth in 18:33.9. 
These runners were strongly supported by the efforts of junior Maureen Kelly, finishing 26th, freshman Carolyn Long, placing 33rd, and sophomore Amy
