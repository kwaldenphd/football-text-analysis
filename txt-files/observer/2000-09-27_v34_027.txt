Going for the gold 
Olympic athletes learn dedication, perseverance and other life-long lessons. 
' 

By KIFLIN TURNER 
News Writer 
When searching for a wm­mon bond between countries competing in the Olympics, one factor can come tu mind -the growing trend of ath­letes being more competitive at an earlier age. 
It may not be surprising to hear of a 15-year old winning a gold medal at the Olympics. What could be surprising, if not alarming, is the amount. or the Jack of concern given to the personal and mental development of these young athletes. 
Many argue that the Olympics serve as a forum to exhibit the ultimate level of athleticism reached through hard work. pain and persever­ance. 
"Stepping up to the plate, and having the courage to compete and try their best ­that's what the Olympics are all about." said Chris Apple, head coach of the men's soc­cer team. Training and com­peting at the Olympic level is not merely a showcase of one's athletic ability. It is about developing the mental capacity to handle defeat and continue trying regardless of what obstacles may exist. 
"Jt builds your character because you spend so much time and effort in training," said Anne Makinen, a member of Notre Dame's women's soc­cer !cam. 
Makinen played on Finland's Women's National Team, and recalled that her experience in playing sports has had an enriching effect on her life. 
"I had a lot of chances to play overseas and to meet other people, and that's prob­ably helped me to shape my views and my perspectives," said Makinen. 
Participating in sports exposes athletes to the funda­mental lesson that losing in life is inevitable. What is more important is how a person chooses to handle defeat that makes the difference. 
"Sport. in general, teaches that it is the competition. not the victory that matters," said Apple. Striving to achieve excellence builds an athlete's character as well, said Apple. 
"Sport teaches young people how to handle adverse situa­tions -it gives them strength later in life and the skills to deal with those situations," said Apple. 
Competitive sports demand discipline and a strong will to

Students discuss Prague 01eeting 
By MYRA McGRlFF 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's students met Tuesday afternoon to discuss the World Bank and International Monetary Fund's (rMF) annual meeting which was held earlier that morning in Prague. 
The issues on the students' table mirrored the issues that originally spawned the April 16 protest in Washington D.C. 
"They (the countries] have to privatize everything like health care, schools, and water after receiving loans. So only those with money now have access to these goods," says Katie Poynter of Peacemakers. 
The charge against the orga­nizations builds around loans givnn to countries in need due to economic problems. The World Bank and the IMF are organizations comprised of over 180 member countries set up to establish economic growth and employment to countries in need. Both organi­zations proposition in revitaliz­ing these economies rest in loaning money to the countries in need. The Joans must be paid back along with interest. Demonstrators see the World Bank and IMF as destroyers of the countries receiving loans. 
So even though monies are distributed to countries in need, those in opposition see an ever-growing gap to repair­ing these countries fallen economies. 
"The IMF gives money to countries in need, bul in the long term solution isn't work­ing," said Maureen Capilla of Peacemakers. "The countries in need have to pay back loans with high interest and in may cases take out more loans just pay the interest. So they're more in debt then when they started." 
The sentiment is that the countries cannot build their economy because of the debt they must pay back. Many of the protesters feel the debt should be forgiven to let these countries rebuild their econo­my. In Tuesday's meeting in Prague, World Bank President James Wolfensohn spoke to the Associated Press about the reform in store for the World Bank as they work in company with I MF. He discussed the introduction of the Poverty Reduction Support Crndit 
The World Bank hopes the new policy will allow for new loans to work in alignment with each countries specific government and policy cycles, giving the countries power over how !he loan is distrib­uted into the economy. 
Reform in the eyes of the protesters reads differently. Some see change coming from restructuring the organiza­tions themselves. 
"Its not like there shouldn't be one {World Bank or IMF). but we don't need one full of corporations," says Poynter. 
Many perceive the involve­ment of corporations within these countries as a long-term threat to the well-being ol'

Freshman ·class elects council representatives 
By JASON McFARLEY Assistant News Editor 
Following a busy week of run­off elections for positions on the freshman class council. as of Tuesday night, 25 of the board's 27 posts had been filled. And the results couldn't have come soon enough for the students who emerged from the run-offs. 
"It's a relief to .finally know that I'll be on the council," said Rob Keller, Siegfried Ilall's win­ner. ''I've been so worried," the 18-year-old New Orleans native admitted. 
Other students expressed simi­lar sentiments. 
''I wasn't too worried about winning, but this definitely comes as a relief." said Dillon Ilall representative Don Norton, 
18. 
Norton, whose sister. Molly, is on the junior class council, said now that his position is secured, he can begin serving his class. 
The Downer's Grove, Ill., native has already established a tenta­tive list of ideas that he would like to see implemented. Among them are setting up a computer lab in Dillon and organizing other Dillon-spccilic events and developing social opportunities for freshmen throughout the year. 
"There seems to be a real need for freshmen events because we don't really have anything as a class after Freshman O[rienta­tionJ," Norton said. 
Lauren Fowler, who was elect­ed Pasquerilla East's representa­tive on Monday, is also primed to begin work on the council. Fowler. of' llouston, said her top priority will be class unity, and she will use ideas from previous councils to achieve it. 
"It's very important to have a united class." said the 18-year­old Fowler. "I'd like to see us do things like class masses and T-

INSIDE COi.LIMN 
Thank you, my friends 
American medicine never ceases to amaze 

me. All the intricate technical terms, all the 
mechanical mumbo jumbo -all the diseases 
that seem so simple but still cannot be cured. 
It amazes me. But, with all the new technolo­

gies still no one can claim 
a cure to the inconsolable Kelly Hager 
feeling after the loss of a 
loved one. 
Too many people. 
Too many friends. Copy Editor 
Too many close friends. 

All taken, seemingly, too 
soon. Why? 
In the beginning of each of their struggles I 

watched my friends attempt to live a lifetime in 
an allotted two. three and six months. I 
watched them count the days on the calendar 
and grumble to themselves. And one by one, I 
watched them press on. and in turn. pass on. 
Like my friends who have gone before me, I have noticed that along with certain medical diagnosis comes the most primitive need to defy death. People say I should be angry, but I'm not. With the help of my friends, I have pro­gressed past that point. To some, dying is the ultimate failure. I, too, used to believe this. But nc,w, looking back, I think di!Terently. 
There is nothing cool about being sick. Nothing redeeming about a terminal illness. There is nothing cool about watching your clos­est buddies face that fate everyday. But in watching them, and living it with them, I learned a very good lesson. And now, with that lesson in my pocket and without that fear ahead of me. I am able to look past an annoy­ing death sentence and continue friendship. And more so. I am able to hold their hand knowing in full faith that death is not an end, but a beginning. 
Still, not a day passes that I don't think of them. I often find myself renecting and remem­bering each of the wonderful men and women whom l became close to. Everyday I am reminded of how much more special my life is because of the lessons they taught both me and the world by fighting. Yes, my friends may be gone, but their gifts and memories will remain with me for my lifetime. Some things will never die. 
Along the path, my vision of practicing medi­cine changed. It is no longer a term associated with the white lab coats of managed health care -those are not the people patients in grim circumstances work the closest with. Whether it is a physical or emotional ailment, medicine is the art of healing. Ultimately, the people who seem to think they are the most insignificant are the bearers ofjoy and hope, and to these people -for both me and my friends -1am eternally grateful. To the work­ers who stayed after hours to pick up the pieces their supervisor's decisions left dangling, and to the friends that found their way in after visiting hours, Thank you. I attribute my perseverance to your encouragement and support. 
And, as I sit here writing this column, I am wearing the biggest goofiest grin. Why? Because, thanks to my friends, I know a feeling that cannot be described by any American medical journal or text. A feeling that can only be comprehended by the few admirable people that have battled long and hard enough: There is only one thing that beats having a full head of hair -the feeling of victory in knowing that you're healthy.

MTV picks participants for forum 
ANN ARBOR 
A bit of urban New York City moved into the University of Michigan's North .Campus Monday as MTV set up stage for the "A Town Hall Forum with Al Gore" to be taped Tuesday. The program, which will air Tuesday night at 8 p.m., will feature univer­sity students questioning the presidential candidate on a range of issues. "We wanted a breadth of top­ics," MTV Vice President of Communications Jeannie Kedas said regarding the selection process of 150 students and residents participating in Tuesday's discussion. Applicants were asked to name three topics they want to discuss as well as a one-liner question. MTV held a technical rehearsal Monday, with a small, random selection of the 150 partici­pants in attendance. While in rehearsal, LSA sopho­more Edgar Zapata said he tried out for the show because he thought it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. "I -can't believe that I'm going to be within 20 feet of Al Gore," he said.

Council forbids lecture note sales 
BERKELEY 

Students who would rather purchase lecture notes from online companies than attend class may soon find themselves scurrying to class at 8 a.m., due to a bill Gov. Gray Davis signed over the weekend. The bill, authored by Assembly member Gloria Romero, prohibits the commercial sale or distribution of lec­ture ·notes at any University of California, California State University or California community college campus, as well as at private universities in the state. Companies that sell nof:_es online are the major target of this legislation, said Dennis Hall, a legisla­tive director in Romero's office. The bill does not apply to companies that operate in collaboration with university administration and faculty, such as Black Lightning, a popular lecture note service on the University of California at Berkeley campus. Companies that sell lecture notes without consent of the university's administration and faculty are now subject to a civil penalty.

Shribman: Politics and entertainment in-tertw-ined 
By MEG DADAY 
NewsWrirer 
Anyone who has opened a newspa­per, turned on the television, listened to the radio, or browsed the Internet throughout the 2000 presidential cam­paign might know that a large part of politics is enfortainment. 
The constant struggle between politi­cians and journalists has lead to "the line between entertainment and poli­tics blurring," said David Shribman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist for The Boston Globe. 
Shribman gavr a lecturr Tuesday in the Ilesburgh Library auditorium titled "The Politics of Entertainment and the Entertainment or Politics." During the lecture, he noted the similarities between politics and the entertainment industry, saying that both "reward style more than content," and "manip­ulate rather than persuade." 
To win voters, Al Gore and George 
W. Bush must deliver their messages to the public through the media. Sometimes. however. the dry messages they delivor do not coincide with jour­nalists' struggle to entertain the pub­lic. 
Noting that the entertainment indus­try recognizes its own similarities to politics, Shribman quoted actor Warren Beatty as saying that there is no real difference between Hollywood and Washington because both are focused on -an audience rememboring a sound bite. 
One major disadvantage Shribman associates with politics becoming more focused on campaigns as a "string of advertising spots" is that "we arc in danger of becoming a nation or specta­tors." 
As politicians try harder to entertain, voters are becoming more passive, warned Shribman. He said that prac­ticing and participating in politics "was the great national sport at the turn of the century" because people were altracted by the barbecues and beer the political parties used to attract vot­ers. Turning control of campaigns over to the media "changed people who run for office and changed the type of peo­ple who are drawn to campaigns." 
The current election. however, will bring about a slight change, Shribman said. "There is a general feeling that the guy in the White House has a lot of personality and that maybe we've had a little bit too much lately." After the scandals of President Bill Clinton, Shribman said he believes the public is looking for a less dynamic leader. 

Shribman said that Al Gore and George W. Bush have a lot more per­sonality and charisma than the media gives them credit for. "The George Herbert Bush and Albert Core I know are different." He describes George 13ush as "exceedingly pleasant, bright, sharp, alert and provocative," although the media has dubbed him a "clumbo." He sees Al Gore as "clever. devilish, provocative, relaxed, and informal," but the press depicts him as "a figure who's nearly embalmed except with different clothes every­day.'' 
Late night entertainers such as David Letterman and Jay Leno encour­age the stereotypes by making fun of the candidates nightly. Thus. the "fixed" public persona of the candi­dates does more to "obscure the candi­dates than illuminate." he said. 
Shribman is Assistant Managing Editor and the Washington bureau chief of The Boston Globe. He is a columnist for the Globe and the National Press Syndil:ate.

Capturing 58 percent of cast ballots, Sablich, a Notre Dame senior, defeated D'Avria, also a senior, by 20 votes to 15. "Turnout was definitely low, and that's disappointing but not surprising," said Tony Wagner, judicial council presi­dent.

Sablick wins off-campus senate race 
to vote. Also, Wagner said the election was "spur-of-the­moment" and without the nor0 mal buzz of campus elections. 
That's due, in part, to the fact that the need for an elec­tion only came about some two weeks ago, when then off­campus senator Phil Dittmar resigned due to schedule con­flicts. 
"We basically had 10 days to put the election together," Wagner said. 
The controversy continued when, on Sunday, the Student Senate called an emergency meeting to consider an appeal by junior Brian Clemency. Clemency had appealed to the senate after the judicial coun­cil's decision to disqualify him from running for off-campus senator. The senate then unanimously rejected Clemency's appeal, concluding that the Zahm Hall resident was ineligible to run for the position. 
Sablich, who said he didn't do any campaigning prior to his victory, believes that despite advertisements in The Observer, the election was not well publicized. "No one knew about it," he said. 
President of O'Neill Hall last year, Sablich said he "felt a void not being involved in stu­dent government this year. "This election sprang up, and I thought I needed to jump on the opportunity." 
The off-campus senator serves in the same capacity as senators from campus resi­dence halls, according to Wagner. Sablich will attend weekly senate meetings, take on committee work and be a representative on the Campus Life Council. 
"It's a big responsibility, but the duties aren't too over­whelming," Sablich said. 'Tm just looking forward to the opportunity to represent my fellow off-campus students."

Web site offers free long-distance calling by application 
By ANDREW THAGARD News Writer 
Broad Point Telecommunications, an Internet startup company, touts the issue of free long distance calls on il-; Web site, www.callfreeway.com. 
Beyond the customer comments prais­ing Broad Point as the "greatest thing since chocolate," Internet users will dis­cover that the company promises up to two hours in free long-distance calls each month to anywhere in the United States. 
The catch, however. is that potential subscribers must fill out a personal appli­cation 011line which dSks such information as ethnic heritage, work status. household income, hobbies and purchase interests. 
/\fter the company processes the appli­cation, members receive a toll-free num­ber and a pin code. Callers then listen to 10 lo 15 second advertisements for everv two minutes of long-distance time they wish to receive. National advertisers include First USA, Toshiba, and TGf Fridays.

Keller agrees. Ile said that his experiences with Notre Dame student government thus far have bolstered his anticipa­tion of serving on the council. "Overall, I'd say I've had a very nice first experience with stu­dent government. It's been really positive," Keller said. 
Elections for remaining council seats are expected to wrap up by Thursday. Once freshman representatives from each University residence hall are elected. the council will meet as a whole later this week. Then, next week the council will elect the class council's executive oflicers. 
In addilion to Fowler. Keller and Norton, other representa­tives elected this week includ­ed Michael Kwiatt of Alumni llall, Nick Williams of Fisher Hall, Al Peetz of Keough Hall, Caroline !foams of Lyons Hall, (name coming soon) of O'Neill llall, Phuc Nguyen of Stanford llall and Dan Maguire of Zahm llall.

lance, customers' calls won't be interrupt­ed by advertisements. Because Broad Point w.orks through customers' phone bills and doesn't require calling through a computer, there are not lags at the begin­ning of the conversation or poor sound quality, according to an August 2000 arti­cle in the The Naked PC. 
"I think some of the information they're asking might be a little too personal. but the idea of free long distance sounds cool." said freshman Chris Scoletti. 
llowever, the company's Web site promises to keep personal information about members confidential. 
"We only provide advertisers with demographic information, nol with our customers' names and addresses," said Drew Blakeman, company spokesperson. 
The company, founded in 1998, initially launched its service in the greater­Pittsburgh area and has since expanded coast to coast. Currently, Broad Point boasts about 500,000 members across the country with around 20 percent of those enrolled in colleges or universities. 
In the coming months, the company hopes to expand outside the US. It also 

plans to launch a new service ,vhich would allow wllers to "bank" their long­distance time by saving minutes earned by listening to advertisements for future calls. 
Blakeman was not certain when these new services would be available, saying only that they would be offered "sometime within the next fow months." 
Despite Broad Point's strong growth up to this point, Blakeman does not sec his wmpany threatening the larger long dis­tance corporations like AT&T, Sprint and MCI. 
"A lot of people use (our service) as a supplement [to other calling plans]." he said. "We use long distance carriers to provide our service." 
'Tm advised that currently there are 52 Notre Dame students who have used Free Way within the past month ... If the same proportion of 40 percent of students who identify their college when registering holds true for ND, that would mean there are about 130 current ND students who use Free Way," Blakeman said. However, "We don't require that people specify their college at registration." he said. 
Anne Marie Roderiques, a 1992 Notre Dame alurnn who currently lives in Washington D.C., has been using the Broad Point service since the two years it has been available, starting when she was in graduate school at George Washington UniversiCy. 
'Tm definitely in the first 1000 people who started using it," she said. 
"It's a very professionally run system," said Roderiques, adding, "l use up my two hours every month. I've actually ordered stuff from some of the ads, too." 
Hoderiqucs recommends the service to Notre Dame students as a supplement to other long distance plans, not just for its economic value but also for its ability to save customers time. 
"It's convenient because you don't have to keep track of another bill [andl you're not liable for stolen calling cards. It's one more bill you don't have to worry about," she said. 
Broadwing Telecommunications, the official long distance carrier of Notre Dame, and parent company Cincinnati Bell did return voice mail messages regarding competition from Free Way.

Six nations, including Venezu­ela, Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Peru, _and Bolivia, venerate Simon Bolivar as their lib­erator from the rule ofSpain. lhis great states­man, writer, and revolutionary general is known 
as the George Washington ofSouthAmerica. Simon Bolivar was borninCaracas(nowin Venezuela)onJuly24, 1783,ofanoble Spanish family. For 20 years Bolivar led the fight to free north­ern SouthAmerica. At his height, between 1825 and 1828, he was president or protector ofGran Colombia (now Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, and Ecuador), Peru, and the newly formed Bolivia. Bolivar was a sincere patriot, devoted to the cause of liberty and equality. While ruler ofVenezuela, he proc1aimed the liberation ofslaves. He also was a pioneer in urging the forma­tion ofa union ofAmerican republics.

Foley: Morals should rule inedia 
By ANDREW THAGARD 
News Writer 
Advertisers and the media need to hold ads to moral and ethical standards, said Archbishop John Foley in a Tuesday night lecture at the Mendoza College of Business Jordan Auditorium. 
~Advertisers ... are morally responsible for what they seek to move people to do," said Foley. 
The Archbishop, author of the Vatican docu­ment "Ethics in Advertising," said the Catholic Church docs not condemn advertising but feels that companies should base their campaigns on "common moral codes." 
"The Catholic Church has been involved in advertising for 2000 years, it's called evange­lization. We believe in our product and we offer more than a lifetime guarantee," he joked. 
"We've gotten nothing but affirmative respons­es." Foley said of the Church's recent publica­tion. 
Foley said the communications industry should base advertising on truth, respect for the dignity of the human pPrson and concern for the com­mon good. The Archbishop admitted that follow­ing these guidelines is often difficult. 
"I quit several jobs and refused to perform many actions for ethical reasons," he said. 
Foley also suggested that the rewards of prac­ticing ethical advertising policies could be great. As editor of the Catholic Standard and Times, a Philadelphia Diocesan publication, he monitored and restricted the content and source of adver­tisements. 
"I thought we would lose money [for practicing these policies] but we ended up making it. Sometimes virtue is its own reward," he said. 
However he commented that advertisers should exercise common sense in their ad cam­paigns. He cited Nestle's infant formula blitz launched in Africa as an example. The ads per­suaded African mothers to switch from breast feeding their babies to using Nestle's product. 
"Moms mixed formula with unsafe water caus­ing some infants to die," Foley said. The Archbishop addressed advertising issues surrounding electronic media. "The Internet is a wonderful opportunity because you can get into homes that could not

otherwise be entered." 

However Foley also warned advertisers and consumers to exercise caution with this more recent form of communication·. 
Foley, a priest of 38 years and a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture, explored ethi­cal advertising issues, not only from a religious viewpoint, but also as a journalist. 
He earned a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University and served on the board of directors of the Catholic Press Association of the United States and Canada from 1977 to 1984. 
Lilly program gives hands-on experience 
By SARAH RYKOWSKI 
Saint Mary's News Editor 
New faces will continue to filter into Saint Mary's Science Hall this year, but unlike most new students, thPy'rc not freshmen. 
The Lilly Lab program, 
. now in its second year, continues to bring high school kids into Saint Mary's labs for hands-on science experience. According to Nancy Nekvasil, head of the Lilly Lab program, this year the labs will mix of biolo­gy and chemistry, and are critical to the community. "Our target audience is the students who don't have a lot of access to laboratories and other facilities," Nekvasil said. "There is such a need. We have a list of 60 schools who are interested." The students come to Saint Mary's to use the labs, and are instructed by a professor during the lab. "They come in whenev­er we can work it out," Nekvasil said. "The facul­ty member finds a time, and then we negotiate with the school." All of the students will be new to the program. Stephen Peters, assistant to the program in chem­istry and physics, has already held one lab ses­sion this year and was very pleased with the results. "They just seemed .very motivated," Peters said. 
New Yorks longest running comedy revue 

"Most of these students don't have facilities for chemistry labs. They come here and do every­thing that they normally couldn't do. It's a real plus." 
Peters is also pleased to see the students learn to navigate through a col­lege campus, which is a different environment from the typical high school scene. 
..lt's good for the college on a whole because it shows our involvement in the community. Some o!' the women in the pro­gram could consider com­ing to Saint Mary's," said Peters. 
Peters also thought that the program had rele­vance to the students' everyday lives outside of school. 
"It is important for stu­dents that age to get some kind of interaction with science because it has rel­evance for everything," Peters said. "We live in a science and technology based society, so they will use what they learn on a daily basis." 
The program is for high-school students, including Catholic schools and homeschoolers. "It feels really overwhelming at times but it is well worth it," Nekvasil said. 
The Lilly labs on Saint Mary's campus are made possible by a grant of $1 million made by the Lilly Foundation last year. The grant expires in December of 2001.

With Congress scrambling to complete last-minute lt~gisla­tion. momentum gathered Tuesday tor two major health proposals

achieve success. These attribut­
es are likely to extend to all 
parts of an athlete's life, as 
mental strength has a direct 
relationship with physical 
strength. 
"I think it is the single most important entity to steer [ath­letes] on the right path oul5ide of religion," said women's head soccer coach, Handy Waldrum. Building honor and values result from the will to succeed and establishing the goals needed to reach that point. 
"With so many other tempta­tions in life, the impact is immeasurable," said Waldrum. By involving young adults to get involved in the sport of better­ing one's self physically and mentally, these athletes will develop a stronger resolve to reject the pressure to succumb to any negative activity. 
Sports are "the best thing to get young people into today," Waldrum said. 
These qualities, while admirable from the spectator's viewpoint are not the only byproducts of Olympic training. 
The typical day for an athlete training for the games may consist of following a strict regi­men of diet and exercise. 
The potential stress levels ollen create a gap between the athletes and their peers that may eventually cause them to feel alienated from the norms oftheir peer group. 
"I think that's the exception. not the rule -most of !the ath­letes] are pretty well adjusted," said Apple. Balancing competi­tion and maintaining a. healthy social life arc feasible qualities that are attained by the majori­the !louse Commerce Committee Tuesday approved a $21 billion boost for Medicare. 
"We'll continue to work on these and other issues," Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said bofore a meeting with GOP leaders on a number of health care issues. 
Ilouse Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas said of Clinton's endorsement, uWe're enthusiastic about that. It was one thing we can do. We're going to continue to work with the White House ... [we] hope we can get them to accept that we must do something on a wider scale than that." 
The movement on the two issues' comes as Republicans and Democrats are gridlocked on their two major goals of the year -passing a prescription drug benefit for seniors and a 
ty of young athletes. 
"I think there can certainly 
be a balance and a means to do· 
both," said Waldrum. 
Focusing on a competitive sport for athletes who have the ability to train at a high level is something that young adults should have the option of pur­suing. 
"If you have a high level ath­lete, and that athlete wants it, then I think it is important to put them in that environment," said Waldrum. 
Ol'ten, the media and public in general tend to place a nega­tive stigma on intensive train­ing and competition. 
''I've always viewed athletics like academics in that, in schools, when you put kids that have a higher ability level into honor programs. then it's OK. but when you put kids that have the athletic ability into higher programs, then people have a problem with it," Waldrum said. 
However. there is some con­cern that young adults training at the Olympic level have an unhealthy amount of stress because of their preoccupation with practicing and reaching a near state of perfection. 
Specifically, in individual events such as gymnastics, Apple said that the likelihood of maladjustment to personal relationships is much higher. 
"There is so much pressure on them at a young age to be perfect," said Apple. "After time, those kids will burn out." 
Parental involvement is key, said Waldrum, but sometimes even this vital influence may not always be positive.

In his letter, Clinton said he supported the Senate version of the reimportation measure, which includes additional safe­guards to ensure the reimport­ed drugs paose no health risks. 
"Though this initiative does not address seniors' most important need -meaningful insurance to cover the costs of expensive medications -it still has real potential to allow consumers to access proscrip­tion drug discounts," Clinton wrote. 
The legislation, while not finalized, aims to allow phar­macists and drug wholesale distributors to import American-made drugs sold abroad for less than they cost in the United States. The Food and Drug Administration would be required to certify that all reimported drugs are safo and e!Tective. 
influences are positive or nega­
tive, said Waldrum. 
The decision, as well as the extent to which these athletes should pursue competition at such a high level should be left to the child, not the parents, said Makinen. Further, if the athlete feels overwhelmed by the intense practice, the child should also have the right to stop training. 
"My parents have always supported me," said Makinen. "If I were to quit today, they would say 'that's OK, that's fine."' 
Because young adults train­ing for Olympic competition take on training as a full-time activity, schoolwork and per­sonal development often take a backseat to the rigors of prac­ticing and staying fit. Training becomes a way of life devoid of healthy relationships with friends and family. 
"They never get to be kids, to go to the movies, they're always concerned about their weight and what foods they can eat," said Apple. 
Balancing practice, relation­ships with family and friends, and schoolwork is a difficult endeavor, and many athletes decide to concentrate on their sport as a career. However, not everyone will achieve excel­lence and attain an Olympic medal. said Waldrum. 
"I think we all have an oblig­ation to steer them in the direc­tion of education -there are so few athletes that actually go on to make it," said Waldrum. 

Court sends Microsoft case to appeals court 
. Decision marks a victory for the software giant 
Associated Press 
WA.."'IIINGTON 

The Supreme Court delayed any quick resolution of the historic Microsoft antitrust case Tuesday, sending it to a federal appeals court in a tactical win for the soft­ware giant. 
The action means a final deci­sion on whether Microsoft must be broken up could be years away. The Justice Department had want­ed the nation's highest court to hear arguments this winter and issue a ruling in the spring: but the justices granted Microsoft's request to send the case to the fed­eral appeals court. 
"This is a serious setback for the government,'' said William Kovacic, a George Washington University law professor and antitrust expert. "Their strategy was to speed this case to resolution as quickly as possible .... I think the government gambled and failed. At this point, I think the possibility of breakup is next to zero." 
Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive oflicer, said Tuesday that his company is not interested in delays. 
"We're interested in speedy res­olutions," Ballmer said in San Francisco. "We want to get this thing moving as quickly as possi­ble. We want to be able to be vindi­cated and move on." 
At the Justice Department, spokeswoman Cina Talamona said: "We look forward to present­ing our case to the Court of Appeals as expeditiously as possi­

The justices got a jump on next Monday's start of the 2000-2001 term. granting review in a dozen cases in addition to the order in the Microsoft caso. 
Microsoft is seeking to overturn 

U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ruling that it engaged in illegally anticompetitive conduct. The judge in June ordered the company split in two. but he postponed enforcement of the order during Microsoft's appeal. 
Within hours of the high court's action Tuesday. the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ordered both sides to propose a schedule for filing briefs in the case. The court ordered Microsof't to submit il<; proposal by Monday al'ternoon, with a govern­ment response due the following Thursday. 
The appeals court decided last summer the Microsoft case would be heard by the full appeals court, rather than a three-judge panel. thereby eliminating one level of appellate review. 
But antitrust experts said it still could be years before a linal rul­ing. After hearing arguments in the case, the appeals court could uphold or reverse Jackson's rul­ings. But it also could send the case back to the judge for further hearings, either on whether Microsoft engaged in illegal con­duct or whether a breakup is the proper remedy.

Gore addresses twentyso01ethings' concerns on MTV 
Associated Press 
ANN AH.BUR, Mich. 

The introduction for J\l Gore's MTV appearance made him older than he really is. But it also celebrated his motorcycle-riding youth when he "even smoked the herb." 
The baby boomer candidate told the twentysomethings to call him Al. 
Occasionally taking a shot at being hip, the Democratic presi­dential nominee fielded dozens of sober questions -on racism, gun control and education ­and sonw offbeat ones, too, at the University of Michigan for the MTV cable channel's "Choose or Lose" program on Tuesday.

"It's a great technology, but it can only be used over the long term if they find a way to protect 

the rights of the artist. If you make something then people take it for nothing, well ... intel­lectual prop­erty is still p r o p erty , " Gore said. 
Gore 
Ile escaped the boxers-or­briefs query that etched MTV's mark on politics when President Clinton replied "usually briefs" at a 1994 youth forum. Instead, one student stumped Gore with. "Paper or plastic:'" 
"Oh. man. I've never figured that one out. Just lump it up in your arms and take it all like that," Gore said, adding with a sigh, "I usually get paper because I like the paper heller." 
Gore's 90-minute questioning on MTV, best known for its music videos, was being broad­cast Tu.,sday night to an es1.i­mated 1 million viewers. It fol­lowed his TV appearances with Oprah Winfrey. Jay Leno and David Letterman, and was part of Gore's effort to mobilize young voters in the battle against Republican rival George W. Bush. 
A survey released this week by the Kaiser Family Foundation and MTV found that less than half of the under-25 crowd is "absolutely" certain to vote in November. 
MTV aired its own rough-cut biography of Gore, identifying him as 53 {he turned 52 on 

March 31), and noting that "he's into P.D.A." (That's "public dis­play of affection," as in his big kiss with wife Tipper at last month's Democratic convention.) 
As for Gore's early resume, M'IV said, "I le listened to rock, rode a motorcycle and even smoked the herb." 
One woman asked Gore about that "herb," telling him a mem­ber of her family was in jail for giving marijuana to a cancer patient. 
The vice president replied that he is against legalizing marijua­na for mcdic,ll use because "thus far, there is absolutely no evi­dence" it is medically effective. 
Gore rel-cased his own bio­graphical ad on Tuesday, the lat­est in a string of positive spots. It opens with highlights of his life: Vietnam veter­an, father of 
four, married "He listened to rock, rode worried that

In a round of rapid-fire ques­tioning, Gore revealed that the rock group Sister Hazel is in his CD player these days, he would cast r,ollege roommate and actor Tommy Lee Jones in the role of AJ Gore, he would invite Lenny Kravitz to perform at the inau­guration and the best perk of being promoted would be Air Force One. 
And if he loses? 
"I would probably be a writer of some kind," the one-time newspaper reporter said. 
Gore defended his support for the death penalty and abortion

MTV representatives said Bush has been invited to make a simi­lar appearance but has not accepted. 
In shirtsleeves, Gore appeared at ease with the young crowd, which included daughter Karcnna, 27. 
"Can I call you Al?" one stu­dent asked. 
"Absolutely," Gore replied. "You know the Paul Simon song, right?"

A black student who described being pulled over while driving and "surrounded by six police cars" pressed Gore on why the administration hasn't issued an executive order banning racial profiling. 
Clinton is gathering evidence for such an order, Gore said. adding that if he is elected, "a ban on racial profiling will be the first civil rights act of the 21st century." ·

WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON? 

QUOTE OF THE DAY 
"Relations between the sexes are so complicated that the only way you can tell if two members of the set are 'going together' is ifthey are married. Then almost certainly, they are not. " 
Cleveland Amory author 
Solving gender puzzles 
My boyfriend and I broke up over the summer. I am fine with this now. I have gotten beyond the point where I never want to look at another guy again and have progressed to the point where I am disinterestedly interested in them Marlaynabecause I know 
Soenneker
that I will probably 
eventually want 
another one. I Here We Go 
think it may be an Again 
addiction. In the 
process of this 
interest. I have noticed some things about guys and girls. 
There are, I have decided. two types of guys. There are nice guys and then there are not-nice guys. I can say this with relative certainty. Guys are sim­pler than girls. There are at least two dozen types of girls. 
There are nice girls. There are not­nice girls. There are nice girls who pre­tend to be not-nice girls. There are not­nice girls who pretend to be nice girls. There are nice girJs who try to seem like they a.re only pretending to be nice girls. There are girls who don't care about guys at all. There are girls who do care about guys but pretend they don't care about them. There are even nice girls who pretend to be not-nice girls pretending to be nice girls who are pretending to not care about guys. It's extremely complicated. 
Guys, however, aren't complicated. There are nice guys and not-nice guys, and that's really about it. Even gay guys fall into these two categories. The problem with this is that girls. being so complicated. think that guys are really more complicated than they are. Guys are aware that girls are not as simple as they are. It frustrates them. But girls see simple guys and think, "He can't possibly be as simple as that. He must really be complicated and tortured underneath." 

Unfortunately for most girls, they think this about the not-nice guys. Instead of saying. "That guy isn't nice," many girls say, "He doesn·t act nice. That must mean that he's really very sensitive underneath and he just needs me to understand him." This mindset usually leads to a relationship of one or two years, sometimes longer, the end of which usually comes at about the same time as the girl realizes that really he is just a not-nice guy. 
As for the nice guys, girls just don't know what to make of them. l think they reverse the not-nice guy logic and decide that if he acts like a nice guy, it must really mean that underneath it all, he's a not-nice guy. So, they won't date him. Which is really poor for the nice guys. 
Two of my best friends back home are classic nice guys. Their names are Matt. Both of them. They complain con­stantly about watching these great girls they know date not-nice guys. These girls date these guys and then come to my nice-guy friends and complain about the not-nice guys. They even say things like. "I wish I could meet some­one .like you." Then. rather than date my nice-guy friends, they go off and date more not-nice guys. This drives my friends nuts. 
I've been telling them for years that eventually we will all turn 25 and the girls will start thinking about finding a guy to marry. Then. I tell them. they will have to beat girls off with a stick. Suddenly. girls will not be interested in understanding the deep. tortured souls 
of the not-nice guys. They will be inter­
ested in finding a guy that they can 
count on to take out the garbage every 
week and clean out the gutters in the 
autumn. This will be very good for my 
nice-guy friends. who are both very 
good at trash-taking-outing and gutter­
cleaning. 

In the meantime, however. nice guys across the country will be doomed to watching really nice girls date their less than nice counterparts. For those nice guys who are fed up with this life. my suggestion is twofold. First of all, they need to start foiling the not-nice guys' image. They need to make the not-nice guys look nice. I suggest things like sending the girl !lowers in the name of the not-nice boyfriend. They could also send them nice e-mails in the name of the not-nice guy. Perhaps love poetry would be appropriate. 
The second part of this plan is that the nice guys need to start projecting an image of not-nice guy-ness. For example, il' they are interested in a girl, rather than listening to her and respecting her as a person, they should simply pressure her constantly to have sex. This works wonders for some rea­son. 
Of course. the nice guys will need to stop projecting this image before we all turn 25 or they will lose the opportunity to beat girls off with a stick. And really, what guy would want to lose that?

Life's lessons 

learned through 

service 

!lave any of you students gone to your advisor and said, ''I really want to join a service program aftn I graduate. What courses should I take to increase my probability of getting into a program'?" 1 assume the answer is no. So how is it that approximately 10 percent of 1:ach graduating class makes thP decision to participate in a ser­
vice program after graduation when, for many, the option wasn't even known when they came to ND/SMC? Given this time when our social problems am so daunting and the solutions seem invisible, how and why have students made this choice? Let me sham with you my thcorv 
I think it's about miracles. More specifically, l think il's about the miracle of relationship. Granted. 17 years ago when I was a senior I 
would have never said that I chose to become a Holv Cross associate because or the miracle of relationship. Yet, years later, l think that my theorv has stood the test of time. 
\Vhen ~e serve others we are deeply and profoundly touched ­we are changed. The first part of the miracle is the decision to make a commitment to others. Yet, the miracle is just beginning. For example, when I was an associate I worked at a home health-care agency whose goal was to provide senior citizens services that would allow them to remain in their own homes. One day I received an intake that instructed me to go to Ellen's house every Wednesday and Friday at 4:00 to wash her feet. l was so psyched, not because I have a foot fetish, but because Ellen lived a block away from the swimming pool that I exercised in daily. I thought to myself, "This is great! llow long can it take to wash a foot, seven minutes? Two feet -I'll be done by 4:15, I can go swimming and be home from work early." 
Now, this is not an example of a shining volunteer who selflessly gives her time to save senior citizens from nursing homes. Yet, I walked into Ellen's house with my 15-minute plan and never left in under an hour. As l would wash her feet. this 96-year-old woman would tell me her life story. She shared with me her deep Southern Baptist faith, her stories of being married for 69 years to the same man, and her amazing reflections.of parenting six children who all preceded her in death. 
What Ellen taught me was the miracle of relationship. I never thought about swimming when I was in her presence. I never thought about getting home from work early. I just thought about being with Ellen. From Ellen, my four housemates. other senior citi­zens who profoundly touched me and from the many wonderful Holy Cross priests we worked with, prayed with and were guided by, I learned lessons that I could have never learned in school. 
I learned things that have applied to my life in a most practical and real way. They have applied in my profession as a therapist who works with families and individuals who struggle to heal from abuse and neglect. I learned that while relationships can wound and cause deep pain, they can also be the most powerful, healing and wonder­ful girt that God gives us. . 
From my volunteer year I received what I believe to be a very fine course in marriage preparation. To live with other people who are just as strong-willed and committed to their values as you are is great training for marriage. As a community we struggled with how to spend our money and time, the balance between work and play, and how to meet individual and community needs. What better way to grow and prepare for marriage? 
If you choose full-time or part-time service after graduation, I encourage you to leave your diplomas at home, to once again give yourself permission to be a student. The people you w~ll serve will teach you how to help them meet their needs. Many of those who you will serve have never gone to college, but hold doctorates in life. If you can give yourself permission to be open and learn, you will once again experience the miracle of relationship. 
Lastly. you are not being sent on a burdensome mission. You are not being sent to save the \Vorld. You will see pain; you will feel sad­ness; you will experience despair. But in all miracles there is intense joy. Don't forget to recognize it and don't forget to celebrate it! 
If you would like more information on post-graduate service opilortuniLies, please come to the Post-graduate Service Fair tonight, 6 -9 p.m. at Stepan Center.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Support third parties 
As the 2000 election draws near, frenzied presidential campaigns once again rage across our nation. Tragically, the effect of irresponsi­ble presidential campaigning is the large-scale trivialization of our most urgent problems in a reality manifested in pitiful voter turnout and an apathetic attitude toward social and envi­ronmental issues. This inaction has allowed the major parties to stay in pownr despite wide­spread dissatisfaction. The Republican and Uemocratic parties. in concert with the media and large corporations, continue to silence grass-roots political movements. By denying third-party candidates media coverage and a place in the debates, they ensure that the voic­es of opposition will not he heard. 
The Commission on Public Debates, an orga­nization funded by the same corporations bankrolling the two parties' campaigns, has implemented a requirement of 15 percent sup­port in national polls. This arbitrary number is prohibitive to any third-party candidate, espe­cially given that he or she would also have no support or coverage from the media. This rul­ing is particularly absurd given that the requirement for Federal Matching Funds is only five percent of the national vote. (For ref­erence, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura was polling at eight percent before being included in the debates. He went on to win the election and drive an unprecedented voter turnout.) The power to stop the downward spiral rests in our hands. 
Our national race this year has a significant third-party candidate who, despite having 64 percent of Americans voicing support for his inclusion in the debates, will not appear in any of the presidential or vice-presidential debates. 


Campaign article biased 
I was greatly disappointed to read the one­sided analysis presented in yesterday's news article written by Ms. Erin LaRuffa, who also happens to be secretary of the College Democrats. While it is commendable that the author is politically active, what was passed off as news in the article, "Bush, Gore campaigns tainted with controversy," was nothing short of Democratic propaganda. Instead of beginning with the breaking news that the Bush cam­paign is now ahead or that the FBI is investi­gating a Gore spy within the Bush campaign, the article recounts a two-week-old allegation against an RNC ad. Moreover, when the article finally does discuss the incident of the stolen Bush videotape, it characterizes the theft as "another problem challenging the Bush cam­paign." Given the current FBI investigation of a Democratic operative, such a characterization is factually incorrect and erroneously places blame for the incident on the Bush campaign instead of on Gore. 
Additionally, the first 95 percent of the article exclusively uses the Bush campaign to illus­trate what it considers mistakes within the presidential race. Though the title implies that the article will discuss both campaigns, only the last 60 words of the article are dedicated to Ralph Nader and vice-presidential candidate Winona LaDuke will represent the Green Party in November due to a grass-roots campaign run by volunteers nationwide. Their names will appear on most (43) states' ballots, and they have also earned a write-in option in five more (including Indiana). While the Green Party's candidates have the wisdom, the ability and the endorsement to lead this nation well, they will receive little national attention simply because they oppose corporate and media influence in the campaign process. Despite filling countless stadiums along their campaign trail, both this astounding level of support and their desper­ately-needed platform of environmental and social reform are kept hidden from most of the nation. 
We need leaders with more respect for our world and its people; with more insight into our future than into corporate fundraising; with more compassion and fundamental capacity to correct our nation's abuses. If we allow res­olute, uncompromising calls for reform into the national spotlight, the silent majority (the poor and the disinterested) would find a voice able to lead us out of this corporate and political quagmire. Stifling the active, democratic and vital objections that third parties offer is a bla­tant subversion of the political process and our country's espoused values. 
I encourage you to visit www.votenader.org as well as www.debatethis.org to learn about including third parties in debates.

an analvsis of Al Gore's recent blunders. 
Appa;ently, the article does not find it impor­tant that Al Gore lied to the public when he said both his mother and dog take the same pain medication (which in fact they do not). Furthermore, the article does not find it news­worthy that Mr. Gore's proposed budget is actually out of balance because he double counts revenue from a new tobacco tax. 
Finally, though the article highlights verbal mistakes made by George Bush, it does not detail any blunders made by Al Gore. Is Al Gore's comment, "I was recently on a tour of Latin America, and the only regret I have was that I didn't study Latin harder in school ... " not a perfect example of a miscue? 
After reading about The Observer's concerns regarding its journalistic integrity, I am very disappointed to see such a slanted and partisan article. In the future, opinions should be con­fined to the Viewpoint page and not thinly veiled as a news story.

The Huyals scored three unearned runs with help from three Detroit errors to tie the game. 
Carlos Beltran hit a two-run single in the sixth to cut the Tigers' lead to 5-3. One of those runs wa·s also unearned, after Billy McMillon misplayed Dye's single to right.

After Cruz homered in the eighth to give the Tigers a o-5 lead, the Royals tied it in the bot­tom half. 
Phillies 10, Cubs 4 
Omar Daal avoided becoming the major league's first 20-game loser in 20 years. 
With Brian Kingman, the last 20-game loser in the majors, watching Daal's second straight start, Daal hit a two-out, two-run double in the second inning as the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Chicago Cubs. 
Daal (4-19) had been 0-7 in eight starts since defeating San Diego on Aug. 8. Ile had been scheduled to start Sunday's sea­son finale at Florida, but said after Tuesday's game that a sore 
knee would prevent him from 
pitching against the Marlins. 
Sammy Sosa started for the 
first time in a week for the Cubs 
and made an error in the first 
inning when he overran Doug 
Glanville's single. Sosa, the 
majors' home run leader with 50, 
had been sidelined with a muscle 
strain in his lower back. He went 
l-for-4. 
Kingman. 46. llew in from Los 
Angeles for Tuesday's game, 
bought a $25 ticket in Section 
120 behind home plate and 
cheered for Daal to win. 
"I want to remain the last 20­
game loser. I enjoy it for some 
strange reason," said Kingman, 
who went 8-20 in 1980 for the 
Oakland Athletics. "I suffered a 
lot that year." 
Kingman also was in the seats 
last Thursday in Philadelphia 
when Daal pitched against the 
New York Mets and didn't get a 
decision. 
"If it goes as for as Florida, I'll

Antonio Alfonseca (5-6) pitched a perfect 10th for the win. The game drew just 8,538.

Braves 7, Mets 1 
The Atlanta Braves clinched the NL East to win their record ninth straight division title, beat­ing the New York Mets behind John Burkett's pitching and Chipper Jones' home run. 
With John Rocker back at Shea Stadium -and dodging a beer bottle on the mound -Atlanta prevented the Mets from wrap­ping up the wild card spot. 
New York would be assured of that berth. however, if both Arizona and Los Angeles lost later in the evening. 
A chilly, damp night robbed Shea of the playoff atmosphere that usually surrounds the Braves-Mets rivalry. The crowd of 48,270 had little to cheer other than Edgardo Alfonzo's home run, and started booing the home team during a sloppy seventh inning. . 
Hocker drew loud jeers when he came running out of the 
Rraves bullpen to relieve in the eighth. A beer bottle landed about 10 feet from him as he prepared to warm up, and police quickly appeared to have the man who threw it in custody in the first-base box scats. 
Hocker retired Robin Ventura on a routine fly to end the inning, looked at the crowd without emotion as he walked off and smiled for his teammates in the dugout. Hoc.ker finished up in the ninth. 
The Braves. who celebrated only as if it were another regu­lar-season win, begin the playoffs on either Oct. 3 or Oct. 4 against either St. Louis or San Francisco. The only sign that this one meant more was when Atlanta rdievers ran out of' the bullpen to join teammates on the infield. 
Atlanta won the NL West from 1991-93 and, after a strike wiped out the end of the 1994 sHason, has won six consecutive NL East championships.

TRACK 

Runyan, Halllilton advance in 1500-meter Oly01pic race 

Associated Press 
SYDNEY, Australia 
Marla Hunyan. the first U.S. paralympian to reach the Olympics, passed her tirst test at the Sydney Games by advancing oul of the qualifying round or the women's 1.500 meters Wednesday (Tuesday night EDT). 
Bunyan, who is legally blind, was joint>d in the semifinals by 
compalriot  Suzy  Favor  
llamilton.  But  Shayne  
Culpepper, a  late replacement  

for the ailing Regina Jacobs, was eliminated. 
In other action on a wet track Wednesday, American Chris llul'flns was fastest in thP 100 meters as the men began the decathlon. Heavy overnight rain had dissipated by the start of' the events, but the track remained slick. 
Hunyan, who has an incur­able retina condition called Stargardt's Disease that has reduced the middle of her eye­sight, qualified by placing sev­enth in her heat in 4 minutes, I0.83 seconds. 
"Visually there were no excuses and no problems, except the finish was very crowded," Hunyan said. "The track was l'ine. It was great running in this stadium in front of this crowd." 
Itunyan missed sixth place in her heat by a hundredth of' a second, meaning she did not automatically qualify for the semifinals but had to wait to learn whether she had a good enough time to qualify. 
"Did I make it? That's all I want to know. The first two laps were very slow. Maybe I shouldn't have let that hap­pen," Hunyan said before find­ing out she indeed had quali­fied. 
Favor llamilton, who also had to overcome major obstacles to reach Sydney, won her heat in 
4:08.08. She had Achilles· ten­don surgery last year and also had to deal with the suicide of' her brother. To remember him, she has resumed using her maiden name -Favor -in competition. 
Bunyan and Favor llamilton still face a daunting task in the 1,500. No American woman has won an Olympic medal at that distance. 
Culpepper was ninth in her heat in 4:12.52. She got a spot in the event when Jacobs, among the favorites in the ·1 .500, withdrew because of a respiratory ailment. 

l luf'lins' time of' 10.48 seconds in the decathlon 100 meters gave him 980 points and the lead after one event of the two­day competition. U.S. teammate Tom Pappas was seventh and Kip Janvrin was 31st among the 38 competitors. 
All three Americans won their heats in the lirst round of' the men's 200. Floyd Heard, John Capel and Coby Miller ­running with a U.S. flag painted on his forehead -easily quali­fied for the second round latPr in the dav. 
Ato Boldon, silver medalist in the I00 last weekend, won his heat in 20.52 seconds. lie is the pre-race favorite, since Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene were injured in the 200-meter final at the U.S. trials and failed to qualify in that event.

U.S. team defends time-killing strategy used in Olympics

Growing up, future North Carolina graduate Kristine Lilly would watch basketball coach Dean Smith's infamously disliked stall tactic known as the "four corners." Little did Lilly know that one day she would experience firsthand just how unpopular such time­wasting can be. 
Lilly and the rest of the usu­ally adored U.S. women's soc­cer team have been booed off the field twice at these Olympics for killing the clock in the final minutes with a one­goal lead. The jeers were espe­cially loud at the end of

Sunday's 1-0 semifinal victory over Brazil, a win that put the 
U.S. team in Thursday's gold medal game against Norway. 
"We've heard from the crowd that ft's not one of their favorite things to watch," Lilly said. "But in the last minutes it has helped us. It may not be the pre.ttiest thing, but it's part of the tactics." 
In Smith's four corners. four players would stand in a big square and p·Jay catch with Phil Ford. The monotonous maneuver was chiefly respon­sible for the introduction of tlrn shot clock to college basketball in the mid-1980s. 
The soccer version could he called "one corner," with Cindy Parlow playing Ford's role. 
"We've heardfrom the crowd that it's not one of their favorite things to watch, but in the last minutes it has helped us. It may not be the pretti­est thing, but it's part of the tactics." 
Kristine Lilly 
U.S. women's soccer player 
Called off the bench as a sub­stitute late in a one-goal game. Parlow will take the ball into the corner at the other team"s end of the field and stand there with her back to net. When players from the other team challenge her, she shuffies the ball from foot to foot and even­tually deflects it off one of their legs and out of bounds, giving the U.S. team a throw-in. 

The throw-in then goes to Parlow. Repeat the above. A few fans leave. Some probably fall asleep. Mo::;t of them boo and whistle. Loudly. 
The architect of the strategy is coach April Heinrichs, another North Carolina gradu­ate. 
"In the past our team would have whacked that ball into the penalty box," Heinrichs said. "The goalkeeper would catch it, run to the front of the 18 (yard box) and punt it 70 yards, and that's certainly not something we want to face." 
ft makes sense. It works. It's within the rules. But few soc­cer fans have seen it before, and foreign journalists unfa­miliar with American "stall ball" have grilled Heinrichs over what they sec as some­thing approaching a blasphemy to the world's most popular game.

tactical application of a game plan," Heinrichs said after the Brazil game. "It's smart. it's thoughtful soccer. That it was frustrating to the Brazilian players, I und.erstand. I was an athlete, and I can totally feel the frustration. It's the equiva­lent of the four-corner offense in basketball when you're up by 10 points with five minutes left." 
Heinrichs, who has never had her team actually practice the clock-killing formation, praises her players for having the discipline to go against their instincts by not advancing the ball toward the net. The centerpiece -er, corner-piece -of it all admits it's harder than it looks. 
"It's difficult for us to do," said Parlow. who actually is the team's leading scorer this year. "Because we love to attack the goal and we love to get shots on goal and we love to score. so it is a little bit of a change in our mentality. But it's a very-tactical move. It kind of takes the wind out of the other team's sails. We put them 120 yards away from our goal. It's very hard to score from there."

Crouch to return for Big 12 opener

LINCOLN. Neb. 
Nebraska quarterback Eric Crouch missed his second straight practice Tuesday. but was expected to return in time for Saturday's Big 12 opener against Missouri. 
Crouch said he was banged up in the No. 1 Cornhuskers' 42-13 win over Iowa on Saturday, when he threw five touchdown passes and ran for 93 yards on 12 carries. He did not dress for practice Tuesday, but didn't appear to have any trouble moving.

"He comes over here and provides for his family and here I was able to represent the country that gave him and my family the opportunity to be free," said Fernandez, who pitched the United States to a 2-1 victory over Japan in the gold medal game Tuesday. 
"There is no dictatorship," she said. her voice breaking as she fought to keep her composure. "To be able to hear the national anthem and know I fought for this country the best way I know how, which is on the softball field. It's a real emotional time." 
And fight she did. Through eight tough innings in the most pressure-packed situa­tion possible. Through a tour­

fernandez had pitched a full seven innings in a 1-0 vic­tory over Australia the previ­ous night. Less than 24 hours later, she was back at it. She didn't have her best stuff and surrendered an early home run. But Fernandez outlasted her opponent once more.

Fernandez walked the third batter she faced and gave up a leadoff single in the second inning, eventually stranding the runner at third. After Japan went down in order in the third, the first batter in the fourth, Reika Utsugi. timed a changcup perfectly and lined the ball to straight­away center. 
Center fielder Laura Berg backpedaled and leaped, but the ball sailed over her glove and cleared the chain-link fence. Japan led 1-0 and the Americans didn't even have a hit. 
'Tm out there for a reason," Berg said. 'Tve got to find a way to catch that ball. I felt I owed Lisa one."

MI just blocked the crowd out and did what f had to do on the field," said Lovecchio. 
In addition to Godsey and LoVecchio, Davie is also look­ing at Clark -a first-team all-state quarterback from Florida. 
"Jared Clark, if he really comes on strong, will put himself in a position to get more snaps," sajd Davie. "But I don't want to waste snaps for a guy I don't know .is going to play in a game." 
Also in the mix is Holiday, whose athleticism tempts Davie. Holiday is unlikely to play, however. because Davie is hesitant to use up a year of eligibility. 
"You know, if it was the ninth or tenth game of the year I would say 'no,' sitting here right now." said Davie of Holiday's chances ofseeing the field this season. "I don't think it would be fair to him, particularly because his freshman year,· he was thrown in there before I think he was ready to be thrown in LoVecchio, Clark and Holiday are all competing for the same spot -and likely will continue t.o compete for the next four seasons -there appears to be little animosity amongst the young quarter­backs.

"Jared and Carlyle, they're right behi~d me. They're two great quarterbacks," said Lovecchio. "I knew ahead of time that they were gonna take other quarterbacks. It turns out that we got a lot. It's fun to go out all together and compete with each other and learn together. I think it's all making us better players." 
With all the young quarter­backs, talk inevitably turns 1.o the possibility of at least one transferring -as did Zak Kustok in 1998 when he was buried behind Jarious Jackson, then-freshman Rattle and Eric Chappell. Lovecchio claims that such thoughts are the furthest thing from the quarterbacks' minds, as they are focused on learning the offense and com­peting. 
"We get along great. We have a lot of fun together. I don't know what's going 1.o happen in the future with any one of us," he said. "I really try not to worry about any­thing. I just try to take things one step at a time. You really can't look too far down in the future."

Runyan overcomes sight problem to compete in Sydney 
Associated Press 
SYDNEY. Australia 

Marla Runyan is roaming around the cafeteria in the Olympic athletes· village with a plastic tray and silverware, hunting for broccoli. She finds a veggie that looks right, only to discover she's filled her plate with spinach. 
Such everyday chores are dif­ficult for Runyan, who is legally blind. Operating her cellphone in Sydney is a major undertak­ing, as is reading her watch.

Hunyan won four events at the I992 Paral.ympics and is the first U.S. paralympian to make the Olympics. She insists her restricted vision is no handicap when she's compet­ing -even though she can't read the lap clock during a race. 
"Running on the track is one of the things I can do well. l just don't see it as being a bar­rier. I have a sense of strength on the track that in other areas of my life I don't have," says Runyan. who can't decipher opponents' race numbers but recognizes them by body shape or hairstyle.

CROSS C.OUNTRY 
Saint Mary's hosts first Ineet in history, finishes seventh 
By MOLLY McVOY Saine Mary's Editor 
For the first time in the team's short history, the Saint Mary's cross-country team hosted a home meet, the MIAA Jamboree, on Saturday. 
"I think it went really well. especially for the first meet at Saint Mary's," said freshman Erin Thayer, the Belles' second place finisher. "J thought there was a lot of support from the students and staff." 
Although Saint Mary's finished seventh in the meet, head coach Dave Barstis was pleased with the team's performance overall. 
"I thought we had a fantastic race for the first race we ever hosted," Barstis said. ''I'm very pleased with how the team ran." 
Junior Casey Kinsella was the top finisher for the Belles, finish­ing 71st with a time of 22:04.4. Barstis was particularly impressed with Kinsella's perfor­mance on Saturday. This was Kinsella's first competition because of an early-season injury.

Saint Mary's pack running abili­ty. Last season, the Belles' trade­mark was the top five finishers crossing the finish line nearly together. Barsits would like to continue that trend this season. 
"I really would like to see our one-five split drop to below 30 seconds," he said. 
In order to accomplish this Saint Mary's has been doing both distance and sprint work­outs in this week's practices. Thayer feels the training is going to make it possible for the team to break the 30-second mark. 
"I think doing the speed work­outs will make the difference," Thayer said. 
Saint Mary's faces Earlham College this weekend in a non­conference meet and. hopes, in addition to tightening the pack, to drop their times. 
"I just want everyone to improve on their times from this weekend," Barstis said. 
Thayer agreed that looking to place higher is not what the team is aiming for, but, _simply improving. 
"Hopefully I can get a better time and that's all I'm aiming for," Thayer said.

Clemson returns to Top Ten rankings 
Associated Press 
CLEMSON, S.C. 

Clemson is back in the Top 10 for the first time in nine years. Now, coach Tommy Bowden says the No. 7 Tigers must prove they deserve that ranking. 
History isn't on their side,

Bowden says. Not only have 
the Tigers (4-0, 2-0 Atlantic 
Coast Conference) failed to 
achieve a Top 25 finish in the 
past seven years, their next 
opponent is Duke, which has a 
habit of upsetting Clemson. 
"I don't know if it's turned 
around," Bowden said of 
Clemson's fortune. "At the end 
of the season, I think our 
ran king will determine 
whether it's turned around or 
not. 

"Seven straight years 
Clemson hasn't finished in the 
Top 25. That's the next step, 
and we haven't taken that 
step yet. We sit here at 4-0 ­
4-7 is not very impressive." 
However, the Tigers have 
been impressive so far this 
season. Clemson leads the 
nation in total offense (510.8 
yards) and scoring defense 
(5.5 points) and has never trailed in the second half. 
"We're playing real well," 
offensive tackle T.J. Watkins 
said. "The coaches are mak­
ing great play-call decisions, 
the quarterback is making 
good decisions on the field, 
the running backs are finding 
the holes, the defense is play­
ing great and giving us good 
field position." 
Quarterback Woodrow Dantzler has been equally impressive. Clemson has kicked off a nationwide cam­paign to promote Dantzler. who leads the ACC in rushing and is ranked third in the nation in pass efficiency, for the Ileisrnan Trophy. 
However, even with Dantzler, the Tigers aren't guaranteed to be successful. Duke (0-4, 0-1) has won three of the last five meetings in Durham, N.C., including an upset of then-No. 7 Clemson on Sept. 30. 1989 -a loss that dropped the Tigers from the Top 10. 
"We have to raise our stan­dards,· Watkins said. "We have to practice like a Top 10  team. Everyone's going to bring their 'A' game on us, and we have to prepare for that, prepare for everybody's best game."

WOMEN'S SOCCER 
Saint Mary's battles to 3-1 loss against Calvin· 

By SARAH RYKOWSKI 
Sports \X'riter 
Ir you asked the players, they wouldn't count this as a loss. 
But the scoreboard told a different story. putting the Belles below the Calvin Knights, 3-1 Tuesday. 
"The score might not reflect it, but this is the best game we have played all season," junior midfielder Adrian Kirby said. "And that is something in itself." 
Discount livo minutes in the first half, and the score may have gone the other way. 
After coming out with great guns in the opening minutes, the Belles allowed a breakaway by Larissa Onderlindel to result in the first score 15 minutes into the game. Onderlindel was assisted by Tricia Dyk, who leads the Knights in poinlr, this season. Then Calvin got a penal­ty kick, which resulted in another goal less than a minute later. That was scored by Stephanie Fritz of the Knights. Four minutes later, Calvin got a second breakaway, and Tara Bergsma put tho Knights up 3-0 in the joust with the Belles. 
"The first half we had it for the first couple minutes," Jessica Klink said. "Then we let down, and I'm not sure why." 
The second half was a different story altogether. In the opening sec­
. onds of that half, Stephanie Artnak took a direct penalty kick on Calvin goalie Heather Vugt, and put it high and into the net. 
"The second half', we were very 
dominant," Klink said. "Once again 
Stephanie pulled through on the 
penalty kick." 
Artnak now has three goals, all 
from penalty kicks, to lead the team 
in scoring. 
The second half' was played mostly 
in the Calvin zone. 
As he did in the win against Adrian, Belles head coach Jason Miligan pulled Tia Kapphahn, the starter in net for the Belles, to send her in at forward and freshman goalie Laura Metzger to the net with 14 minutes to go. With tho action mostly at the other end of the field as the Belles prnssured the Calvin goalie to at least pull the tic, Metzger didn't have much work to do. 
''I didn't know how extremely awesome our defense was until I was in net." Metzger said. "They were taking care of'me out there." 
Kapphahn made 13 saves, and the defense took care of the rest. NI in all, Calvin had 25 shots on the Belles' defense, while the Belles took 10 shots and Knights netminder Vugt made eight saves. 
"The second half, I thought we played really well in general," Klink said. 
Heather Muth led the Belles with three shots on goal, while Artnak was second with two, including her goal. Lynn Taylor, Katie Green, Patricia Wheat, and Shawna Jiannoni each got off a shot against Calvin.

VOLLEYBALL 
Saint Mary's struggles for second win in 2000 season 

Observer SlalT Report 
Notching victories is getting a little easier for the Saint Mary's volleyball team. 
But it doesn't come easy. 
Tuesday's victory against Albion College may have sent cheers reverberating off the walls ot' Angela Athletic Facility. but it didn't come without struggles. With the weight of a 1-11 season weigh­ing against them, the team refused to be satisfied with one victory for the season. In a team me~ting Monday night. they knew that they had to put the pieces together if they were going to notch more than one win. 
"Yesterday during practice we sat down our team and expressed our goals and frus­trations," said junior cu-cap­tain and blocker Jolie LeBeau. "We realized that everyone has to play 100 percent as a person so that we can play 100 percent as a team." 
And while the Belles found ways to put it together in the first match. soundly defeating Albion 15-10, they began to slip in the second and third matches. behind 1-2 going into the fourth match. 
But they weren't going to let it get to them. 
"Even though we lost those two, we were still having fun," LeBeau said. "The first game was definitely motivational. We went into the fourth match and we knew that was our chance. We weren't scared ... we just knew we had to play our best." 
Securing a victory in the fourth, the Helles forced Albion into rally play for the f'ifth game. While both teams scrambled to return the ball, the Belles secured their court and managed to squeak by 15­13. 
But then again, they had his­tory on their side. 
"The four years that we have been playing here, we have not won yet,· said Albion head coach Darrell Sedersten. "We struggled and will continue to struggle. We always find a way to shoot ourselves in the foot." 
For the Belles, the win was assurance that their team struggles could be overconw. 
"W!wt won this game for our team was that each person played their position 100 per­cent," LeBeau said. "And that made our team come togeth­er." 
The Belles were led by LeBeau, who notched 12 kills, one block assist, and two solo blocks. Senior Victoria Butcko had 16 digs in the win. Freshman hitter/setter Leigh Ann Matesich had 18 kills. two aces. and 20 digs. 
We played better as a team overall," said_Matesich. "We started tu gel together more." 
"It was a well timed much needed win," said Saint Mary's Coach Julie Schroeder-Bick. "Lesser teams would have given up; they showed what they were made of." 
The Belles next face-off Sunday at Alma College.
