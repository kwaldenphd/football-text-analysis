In Brief 

The committee set up to discuss the disbandment of the Dancin' Irish has decided on a recom­mendation to present to Executive Vice President Father Edmund Joyce and Vice President for Student Mfairs Fa­ther David Tyson. Father Peter Rocca, the chairman of the committee, however, declined to comment on the re­commendation until he had a chance to meet today with representatives of the Dancin' Irish. Joyce and Tyson will decide on the fate of the group. -The Observer 
The 500 Club in Hammond, Ind., whose criterion for membership is the ability to do 500 sit-ups without stop­ping, now has its first female member -and first senior citizen, to boot. Helen Jones, 67, rolled through 500 "tummy crunches" -knee-to-elbow situps -to become an official member of the group Tuesday at the city-owned Hammond Fitness Center. "I feel just fine -no problem," she said afterward. Last Thursday, Jones told fitness instructor Jack Callahan that she was ready to try joining the club. That morning, she had already ridden her customary five miles on an exercise bike, played volleyball and worked out in the weight room. Associated Press

Could Notre Dame really be a Disney World in disguise? 

There's a couple of sidewalks between long rows of buildings. There's a pretty fountain and lots of people wandering about. There's a big glittering structure in the distance. There's even a souvenir shop and an overpriced restau­rant. 
Sound like Walt Disney World? Yes, a little. 
Sound like Notre Dame? Yes, a lot. 
It's pretty amazing when you think about it. It's almost like Father Ted had been to Disney World when it first opened and decided he wanted a place just like it. They are one and the same, except that Ted couldn't do too much with the weather. 
Look at the cost, for example. Disney World, for one day's admission to the park and meals, will charge you about $60 to $80, depending on how much you eat and which rides you want to go on. The wonderful people (are they really?) at Student Accounts charge us about $73 a day to attend this institution and eat its institutional food. 
Disney World has Main Street. We have the Main Quad. Ours doesn't have a trolley car run­ning down the middle of it. But we do have golf carts and security cars, and someone sponsored a horse ride there once. On autumn Saturdays we have a big brass band wander around to entertain all the clueless people that have never been here before. 
Lo and behold, at the head of Notre Dame's "Main Street," we have our own version of Cin­derella's Castle, our beloved Golden Dome. It's even lit up at night, just like its Florida coun­terpart. And, just like at Disney World, our castle is the entrance to Fantasyland. Yes, you too can walk through the big wooden doors and find yourself in the Freshman Year of Studies offices, where an assorted cast of strange char­acters will entertain you and possibly even sing "It's a small world after all ..."You can even visit the Never-Never Land of St. Michael's Laundry, where little boys never grow up and everything gets lost. 
On the right we have Notre Dame's version of Tomorrowland, adorned with bizarre foun­tains and sparkling new buildings. Look inside the Space Mountain Memorial Library, where it's too dark and lots of people scream inside the cavernous empty spaces. 
On the left is Notre Dame's Adventureland, featuring the Pirates of the Hammes Carib­bean. Walk upstairs through the turnstile and see ferocious pirates crowing over chests of booty as poor peasants walk by burdened with huge piles of books. Then be forcibly dumped into the Notre Dame souvenir shop, with lots

of knicknacks that no one ever uses but everybody buys. 
Out past the Hammes ride is Frontierland, where all kinds of unsavory characters reside in old-time buildings like Carroll and Holy Cross halls. You can even adventure to the jungles on the far side of the lake and watch all sorts of exotic creatures in strange mating rituals. Watch out for the squirrels, though. 
And Notre Dame, like Disney World, wouldn't let you go hungry. Both we and they have over­priced restaurants serving generic food dressed up with exotic-sounding names. Where else can you buy a "Domer Burger" for more than it would cost to buy a pound of hamburger and a bag of hamburger rolls? 
We even beat Walt to the punch on Epcot Center. We've got Saint Mary's College, with the ultimate in modern buildings, futuristic dress, and an auditorium with strange round things on the walls. We've even got a stream­lined transport system to whisk you between them in picturesque comfort. 
Amazing, isn't it? And you thought this was just a college. But it's not. It's a place of make believe, a place with no news broadcasts, no housework, no cares except getting to the next ride before the lines get too long. You don't have to worry about the real world here. 
I can just see Mom and Dad now: "Enjoy it, kids. Tomorrow you'll have to go back to school." 
Aw, Mom, do we have to ...

Student Body Vice President 
Don Montanaro argued the sen­
ate acted correctly in extend­
ing the deadline because Obud 
had not advertised the manda­
tory sign-up meeting adequate­
ly. "There was no ad in The 
Observer. Also only four or five 
eight-and-a-half-by-eleven 
signs were posted in each of the 
dorms and four of the academic 
buildings." 
Brennan said, "There was no 
less publicity this year than in 
previous years, but this is the 
only year in which they decided 
to extend the deadline." 
Brennan acknowledged, however, that no advertise­ment had been placed in The Observer. Nevertheless he argued that a Viewpoint edito­rial written by Dave Miklos, senior class president, had served the purpose. 
When asked who would now supervise the elections already in progress, Montanaro said "It's no more than a statement. It won't have much of an effect on the election process. As it is, the judicial council already plays the role of monitoring the boxes in the dorms. All we have to do is find a way of printing up the ballots, counting the votes, and ensuring that the rules are followed." He said he would meet with judicial coord­inator Maria Cintron and Senior Class President Dave Miklos today to discuss this question. 
The unanimous senate deci­sion to extend the deadline for candidate petitions came last Monday when Steve Dufour,_ candidate for the senior class presidency, and Gene Patton, candidate for the sophomore class presidency, appeared before the senate to request the extension because they said the mandatory Feb. 25 sign-up meeting was not adequately publicized. Dufour, Patton, and Greg Molinsky, a candidate for the junior class presidency, are the only ones so far to have taken advantage of the exten­sion, Brennan said. 
Said Brennan, "The Student Senate in effect changed the rules, and this time they've done it again.

According to Iacono and Morales the recent Scholastic incidents did not affect publication of Dome and Jug­gler. "My initial reaction was that student activities was overly harsh, but I'm glad that it all worked out so agreeably and quickly," said Iacono. 
"The Juggler carried on business as usual, there was no real conflict for us," Morales added. 
According to Lanan all three publications have the responsibilty to abide by the University's ultimate deci­sions. Notre Dame financially subsidizes each publication and resides as publisher. "If everyone follows the agree­ment there shouldn't be any problems in the future," she said.

The Observer 
Intelligence analyst for Navy sentenced to life prison term 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Former ci­vilian Navy intelligence analyst Jonathan Jay Pollard was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison for selling Israel hundreds of secret U.S. mili­tary documents in what prosecutors termed one of the nation's worst spy cases. 
"No, no," screamed his wife, Anne Henderson-Pollard, and she collapsed to the floor after 
U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson announced the life term for her husband. 
His wife, 26, received a five­year prison term for conspiring to receive embezzled govern­ment property and being an ac­cessory after the fact to posses­sion of defense secrets. 
Federal prosecutors said Pollard gave Israel thousands of pages of classified docu­ments, which could fill a room the size of a large closet. 
"This defendant has ad­mitted that he sold to Israel a volume of classified documents 10 feet by 6 feet by 6 feet," As­sistant U.S. Attorney Charles Leeper told the judge. 
Leeper urged the judge to "consider what further unaut­horized disclosure of classified information we can expect" from Pollard in setting the sen­tence for Pollard's conviction of conspiracy to commit espionage. 
"It's clear that his perspec­tive has been so skewed, his view so warped (that) at the first opportunity he is going to go about the business of telling everything he knows to Israel," Leeper added.

Noting the publication of the Tower report last week, Reagan said, "I'm often ac­cused of being an optimist and it's true I had to hunt pretty hard to find any good news in the board's report." 
However, he said he was relieved that it said the presi­dent "does indeed want the full story to be told." 
The address marked Reagan's first detailed response to the Tower commis­sion's criticism of his detached management style and ignor­ance about the details and con­sequences of his arms-to-Iran policy. 
The speech was widely believed to be a crucial step in the White House drive to repair political damage caused by the affair. Two earlier speeches failed to end the controversy or as assistant director next year along with Father George Wis­kirchen, who will remain in his position as assistant director. 
Snavely praised the "won­derful organization" of the bands at Notre Dame. Founded in 1846 as the nation's first col­lege band, the Notre Dame band was among the first to in­clude pageantry, precision drill and the now familiar "pic­ture formations" during pregame and halftime perfor­mances at football games. 
"I won't tamper with tradi­tion," Snavely said, "until I am sure we can do something bet­ter." 
Snavely expressed enthusi­asm for his new position saying "We brought our (University of 
halt the drop in Reagan's popularity in the polls. 
"I take full responsibility for my own actions and for those of my administration," Reagan said. "As angry as I may be about activities under­taken without my knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. As disappointed as I may be in some who served me, I am still the one who must an­swer to the American people for this behavior." 
Reagan said he found the se­cret bank accounts and diverted funds, "personally distasteful," but that he had to admit, "this happened on my watch." 
Discussing the arms-to-Iran policy, Reagan noted that he has said previously that he did not trade weapons for hostages. 
"My heart and my best in­tentions still tell me that is 
true,  but  the  facts  and  the  
evidence  tell  me  it  is  not,"  
Reagan said.

Snavely said he saw the band, student body and ath­letes in action again this year when he attended the basket­ball game against North Carolina in February. "Now is a wonderful time to be coming to Notre Dame," he said. "The football team is on its way back to the very top, the basketball team is having a great season and academics at Notre Dame are just the best."

However, he added, "when it came to managing the NSC staff, let's face it, my style didn't match its previous track record. I have already begun correcting this."

Conscience complicates examination of faith 
The following is the second ofa two-part series. 
What does "conscience is not a mat­ter of one's personal moral preference" mean for those who claim to act accor­ding to their best conscience yet violate a natural law precept? Well, one who is ignorant of a precept is not bound to carry out that precept except insofar as he or she is required to know it. It is the nature of this last clause which is sufficient to correct those who would think that it is always morally right to follow one's conscience as described in that loose sense by Regina Coll. 
Steve Hipp 
guest column 

The Church's position, according to the teaching of St. Thomas (who, by the way, was anything but a dissenter and was never silenced), says that when a man or woman sins in making an error, a false conscience is not enough to excuse him or her, unless that error is about things which he or she is not required to know. If one is obligated to know and act according to some precept, then to act contrarily is morally unacceptable even if his or her conscience approves, and it is his or her responsibility to bring about a change in conscience by educating it (through consulting books, appropriate human sources, and above all praying for supernatural guidance). Hence, such a conscience does not oblige in every event, as some would have us believe. In fact, we are told that while it is true that we should always follow a conscience that is certain, we should never follow a conscience which is in doubt. As responsible Catholics, the spelling out of the particulars of these principles (which are true for all men and women) is no light matter, and we should never think that moral decision­making is so simple as responding to our present self-conscious sense of rightness according to our personal reasoning capacities. It is this; but it is also much more, and particularly with regard to the authority of the Church when concerned with having a truly informed conscience. In the words of John Hardon, "Everything depends upon the degree of sincere certitude we have in facing a moral decision ...The readiness of a Catholic to listen to the Church is a safe index of his good will, as the opposite gives grounds for suspicion of insincerity.'' 
In the case that one's conscience sees evidence in two mutually opposed di­rections, he or she must choose in that direction which sways him or her most. 
Should he or she choose to follow the view of the Church, it is because his or her conscience accepts that the Church is upheld by Christ; and no opposition to authority obtains, for the Church only has the influence of authority on him or her inasmuch as it is freely ac­cepted; part of his or her conscience is formed by belief in the authority of the Church. 
The authority of which I have been speaking means that the Church has as divine mandate to preserve, interpret, promulgate and defend the fixed deposit of faith, revelation. Since the mandate is divine, no human power has the authority to change it, and the Church can neither add nor subtract from revelation, as it is fixed. Being Catholic means, in addition to accept­ing the authority of God, that one also accepts the divinely instituted teaching authority of the Church on the depositum fidei. This is Catholic Faith. 
Misunderstanding or rejecting the Church's teaching office eventually contributes to a weakening of faith. It must be recalled that the motive of faith is not human authority but the fact that God spoke to us, i.e. divine authority; and since God can neither deceive nor be deceived, such authority provides knowledge which is more certain than that which is attainable by mere human reason. Why do Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God? Or that God is triune? Or any other Christian truth for that matter? Certainly not because these truths are attainable by the human intelligence. Nor because they are intrinsically evident and thereby demand assent. But because God revealed these things to man. These truths are "supernatural" truths, truths which are not capable of being learned by unaided human reason, be­cause they transcend the propor­tionalities of human nature. 
Once revelation was closed, with the death of the last apostle, there could be no increase in it, only preservation and diffusion. But human ignorance would still be capable of failing to receive it or to understand it. How then was God to assure that the message of revelation would be faithfully transmitted over time? By establishing a divinely guided vehicle for the conservation and trans­mission of that deposit, a Church. Thus to the hierarchy of the Church is given the teaching authority to proclaim and defend the revealed truth. The magis­terium, or teaching office, was given a special and unique charism enabling it to authoritatively and definitively in­terpret the meaning of the depositum fidei. And in this way the magisterium speaks in the name of Jesus Christ. 
The authority tQ proclaim revelation was not given to the whole Church but only to the successors of the apostles. The magisterium thus consists of the Pope and all the bishops acting in com­munion with him. Within the Twelve, Peter was given the special role of guiding and nourishing the flock (it is not the case that everyone is equal in all the respects which Coll suggests ­besides, pure equality does not produce harmony, but rather an unordered and ineffectual body of chaos); accordihg­ly, the Pope's teaching authority stands for the whole Church, and he possesses the full power to teach on his own, in virtue of his God-given office. A Cath­olic futher believes, as Rev. Roy Lepak tells us, "that the magisterium's spe­cial grace for the interpretation of God's word is operative whether the magisterium is defining a truth infal­libly or not. ..and to the extent that a Catholic is living his grace-life, to that extent is he more or less disposed to listen readily to the magisterium". Furthermore. according to Vatican def­inition (and I will note here that Coli possesses an excellent ability to quote the documents of Vatican II entirely out of context, and with surprising mis­representation), it is not essential for a truth to become a dogma that it be proposed by the extraordinary magis­terium. And the teachings of an encycli­cal or a pontifical decree always remain teachings of the Church, in which she is assisted by the Holy Spirit, and thus they deserve the same internal assent and external acknowledgement claimed for them by Pius XII in Humani Generis. Such teachings by the Church are backed by the promise, "He who listens to you, listens to Me" (Lk 10: 16). 

To support Coli's positions by citing instances where the Church has al­legedly "contradicted her teachings" is dishonest. The evidence of serious historical and theological investigation shows that the development of dogma involves not contradictions, but further elaborations and explications of the Church's teaching. Honesty in research demands that such a distinction be made. Even ordinary magisterium, which may change in its formulation and in its explication of profundity and depth, in no sense, and on no occasion, can be said to mislead the faithful. It makes no sense then to talk about the Church's making substantial future changes in its teaching. The result should be a special and sincere religi­ous allegiance of both intellect and will to the magisterium and its teachings. 
This is not to suggest, as it has some­times been thought, that one cannot in­tellectually examine his or her faith in a critical fashion. The authoritative teaching of the Church is not opposed to individual reflection and understand­ing. There is no reason why one should not apply his or her reasoning faculties to the truths of faith, provided it is done from a standpoint within the faith, a standpoint which is parallel to, and not external to or against the teaching of the Church. Fides quaerens intellec­tum, faith seeking understanding, should characterize theology, and not the other way around. Far from obstructing freedom, the authoritative element is a necessary facilitator of freedom; that authority of the magis­terium, which is at the service of the Truth, is the vehicle by which we can obtain that transcendental freedom; and though certain "liberties" them­selves will have to be set aside, it is only the Truth which "will set you free". The Church's authority is a com­petent source of reliable information and the key to personal freedom, but if it is seen as arbitrary will, then it ap­pears to be an obstacle and limitation to freedom. In the words of St. Paul to Timothy, "the time will surely come, when men will grow tired of sound doctrine, always itching to hear some­thing fresh; and so they will provide 

themselves with a continuous succes­sion of new teachers, as the whim takes them, turning a deaf ear to the truth, bestowing their attention on fables in­stead." 
When what is wanted is denied, strong passions are aroused. We should not be surprised, then, that when Pope Paul told the world that what the world wanted does not comply with proper ethical norms nor could ever constitute meaningful norms for morality, there was a mass turning-away from the teachings of Humanae Vitae and from the authority of the Church to teach. When objective norms based upon the intrinsic value of things are rejected, process theology finds its justification for situation ethics. Since there is no intellectual truth, but only the "truth" of relativity, the new emphasis is on the ongoing learning process, and any interpolation of permanent ethical prin­ciples in the effort to guide individual and social behavior is a violation of the dogma of process. And since every Christian truth is relative to history and culture, they require new interpreta­tion, an interpretation in the spirit of evolution, whereby the adherences of today are archaic, "old nations" tomor­row. In light of this outlook, which is a peculiarly modern phenomenon, it should not surprise us that many of the profound doctrinal truths of revelation are scoffed at in intellectual circles and virtually ignored in modern catacheti­cal texts. What has disturbed me most with regard to the evening's talk is the fact that the many catechumenates and their sponsors were required to partake in this "campus-wide enrichment program...as the major catechetical piece of (their) preparation." 
I invite remarks concerning the above issues, however, with the hope that they be kindly informed, unlike those of Dan Maguire, which merely stab at the Church from behind by mali­ciously sensationalizing what is viewed in a purely negative light while ignoring the profoundly important and deeply rooted commitments which motivate ecclesiastical decision-making. It is indeed sad to see someone like Sr. Regina Coll, whose misinformed teach­ing would, from within, erode the very meaning of Catholicism.

Football players find time for handicapped
Dear Editor: 
On Saturday, Feb. 28, I had the plea­sure of spending time with two groups of special people. The first group was the participants at Logan center. Each week a bunch of mentally retarded folks from town come to a recreation program organized by a group of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. It's a lot of fun for all involved. 
The second group that showed up was the Notre Dame football team. Not just a hand full, but over 30 players showed up at a time on Saturday morning when many folks were probably still in bed. The football players were acompanied by Coach Holtz and several assistants. This was no mere publicity stop for the

team. The players helped out in games, arts and crafts and sing alongs. It was beautiful to see a 200-and-some-odd pounds man holding on his lap, a 70­pound child, who spends most of his time in a wheel chair. I was impressed. 
This only reinforced my opinion of the mystique of the football program. It is not only how they play the game, it's how they play life. They are athletes and humanitarians. The players made a lot of people happy. Their effort takes on added magnitude when you consider the other demands on their time throughout the year (work-outs, spring training, summer session, road trips, and the pressures of being in the spotlight). 
I genuinely appreciate the time they took from their schedule.

features writer 
E 
ntrepreneurshlp Is alive and well at Notre Dame. Witness to the fact are seniors Kevin Christenson and Scott Morrison, chief executive and executive vice president respec­tively of Adworks, the Indepen­dent. student-run advertising business on campus. 
Both students are being fea­tured In the Student Entrepreneurs section of Busi­ness Today, a business maga­zine published In Princeton, 
N.J.• and circulated among uni­versities around the country. The pair were also featured on Channel 16 WNDU news last week. as well as on a recent "Campus Voice" program on the same station. Last week Christenson and Morrison were In Chicago attending the Inter­national Conference of the As­sociation of Collegiate Entrepreneurs, where they gave a seminar on Adworks for a group of about I00 people. Also speaking at the confer­ence were . such well-known entrepreneurs as T. Boone Pickens of Mesa Petroleum, Steven Jobs of Apple Com­puters and Debbie Fields of Mrs. Fields Cookies, as well as other students and entrepreneurs from arountl the world. 
Why all the excitement about Christenson and Morrison? Here's the story: 
Adworks was begun In the fall of 1985 as a small, non­proflt poster business under the control of student govern­ment. When Christenson took over In April 1986, he said he felt the organization was not because of this, when we put 
posters up all over campus, 
card tents In the dining halls, 
etc." 
"Our main goal." adds Mor­
rison, "Is to serve the student 
body, to close the gap and 
help Inform the student body 
on social activities through the 
most effective, highest quality 
ads possible and at as low a 
price as possible (lower than 
people would be able to get If 
they went outside)." 
But when the two returned to 
school In the fall, they found 
themselves facing a big prob­
lem: overdemand. "In Septem­
ber," remembers Christenson, 
"things-just exploded. Right 
away we had to hire a lot of 
people, organize. manage, etc. 
"Yes, we knew we were going ·to be successful, that we were 
"We knew we were 
going to be 
successful, that we 
were going In the 
right direction with 
the company. But we 
didn't know It would 
all happen so quickly. 
One of our biggest 
problems at first 
was that we were 
growing too fast. 
We were getting so 
big." 
Scott Morrison 
going In the right direction with the company," continues Mor­rison, "but we didn't know It would all happen so quickly. One of our biggest problems at first was that we were growing 
lished a strong base from which It can run itself. 
Adworks is structured just like any other corporation. There Is the Chief Executive Officer (Christenson), the Exec­utive VIce President (Morrison), various divisional vice presi­dents, accountants, artists dis­tributors, etc. There Is also an outside board of directors which includes Father William Beauchamp, Father David Tyson, two faculty members and two representatives from Leo Burnett. a national adver­tising agency. Christenson and Morrison will join this group after they graduate this year. 
As far as the actual manag­Ing of the business is con­cerned, Christenson markets the organization to outside cus­tomers and works on plans for expansion. Morrison watches the dally operations of the business and manages the short-term planning. Both are continually engaged in feed­back with each other. Christen­son must know how business is today so he can plan for to­morrow, and Morrison must be familiar with the plans for to­morrow so he can direct today's business accordingly. 
One of the best things about Adworks, according to Mor­rison, Is the experience It pro­vides them and other student employees in marketing and management. Adworks also hones their organizational and management skill. Adworks employs people of all majors (accountancy, marketing. art. computer, Arts and Letters, etc.) and all of them can take what they learn in the class­room and apply it as they

work. gaining invaluable practi­cal experience while they're at 
school. "It's just another way in 
which Adworks serves the stu­dents, in giving them training and practical experience." 
"People ask me how 
I can consider myself 
an entrepreneur If Adworks wasn't my Idea or even my name, but what they don't realize Is that about 80 percent of acknow­ledged entrepreneurs are nQt people with totally new Ideas." 

Kevin Christenson 
Do Christenson and Morrison consider themselves entrepreneurs? As Christenson explains, "People ask me how I can consider myself an entre· 
preneur If Adworks wasn't my 
idea or even my name, but what they don't realize is that about 80 percent of acknowl­edged entrepreneurs are not people with totally new ideas. Debbie Fields didn't invent cookies; she just developed a recipe and expanded the con­cept a little bit. and there we have the very successful Mrs. Fields Cookies. That's exactly what we did with Adworks. It 

was just an expansion of exist­
Ing Ideas to their full potential. 
It's the entrepreneur who has 
the vision to see that new po­
t~ntlal and the drive to achieve 
it... 
Of course, this entrepreneural drive for achievement means that Chris­tenson and Morrison put In 30 to 35 hours a week running the business, In addition to carry­Ing 15 credit hours a semester. "It's very tough to work In school with the business," ad­mits Morrison, "but we make lt. And we even manage a social life, too." 
In the future, Adworks will continue to expand Its services to the surrounding community, adding to the present list of clients which includes Wendy's, Bruno's and Academic Advan­tage, a local schalarshlp ser­vice. Christenson also hopes to spend the summer conducting seminars and marketing the program to other universities across the nation, some of whom have already expressed interest In settng up similar systems on their own cam­puses. Hopefully the Business Today story will generate even more demand.

Baseball team prepares for opener 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
Notre Dame and Indiana may play in the same state, but when the two baseball teams meet this weekend at Bloomington in Notre Dame's season opener, it will be evi­dent how different the teams actually are. 
Indiana is counting on strong performances from returning starters and veteran pitchers to make a run at the Big Ten title. Notre Dame, on the other hand, is hoping its underclas­smen can help the Irish rebound from last year's disap­pointing 22-28 season. 
"Our talent relies on our un­derclassmen. Our only senior position players are John Loughran, Scott Rogers, and · John Gleason," said Head Coach Larry Gallo. 
Nowhere will youth be more important than in the pitching staff. The Notre Dame staff ap­pears to have the potential to better last year's disastrous season 6.25 team earned run average. Still, the Irish will have to answer a few questions about the staff to have a strong season: 
--Can junior Kevin Chenail return to his freshman form (4­0, 3.22 ERA) after being sidelined last year with a shoulder problem? 
--Will underclassmen Brian Piotrowicz, Mike Passilla, and Mike Coffey be able to pitch like they did last fall (one earned run in over 20 innings pitched)? 
--Will Gleason lead what now appears to be an uncertain bul­lpen situation to be consistent? 
"Our best pitching relies on our freshmen and sophomore class," said Gallo. "Gleason's our only senior on the staff, and all we have is three juniors. 
"We lack a tremendous amount of experience in in­nings pitched, but with the staff we have, the majority will be done by sophomores and fresh­men. I feel as though we have a really good hitting team, but if our pitching comes through, 

Larry Gallo 
with guarded optimism I think we can have a pretty good year." 
Gallo is looking at Chenail, Passilla, Piotrowicz, and Robert Fitz to have starting roles, with Gleason and Eric Madson in the bullpen. Tom Howard, Mike Coffey, Paul Mauk, and Derek Madden could end up either starting or relieving. 
"In the fall, Mike Passilla, Brian Piotrowicz, and Mike Coffey looked really good. Tom Howard has had a really good preseason, and he could either start or relieve," said Gallo. "We have about ten guys who can contribute." 
If the Irish can answer their quenstions on the pitching mound, they look solid in al­most every other area. The in­field loses 1986 co-captains Tom Shields and Rich Van­thournout, but looks like it could still end up improving over last year. Steve Sku pi en will start at third base, Pat Pesavento at shortstop, Mike Moshier at second base, and Tim Hutson and Dan Peltier will alternate at first base. Skupien, Pesavento, and Mos­hier all batted over .300 last year. 
"At the infield positions, most of them played together last year. The experience itself in the infield will take care of any leadership roles at all," said Gallo. "Ray Szajko is a ca­pable backup who can play al­most any position, and Skupien can also play shortstop." 
Behind the plate, the Irish still do not have a set starter, but a few people have a chance to earn the starting catching position. The job will probably come down to Chris Flynn, Pat O'Brien, Craig Pavlina, or Don Diebel. Flynn is coming off knee surgery, and looks more likely to be a designated hitter, where Hutson or Peltier might also find playing time. 
Notre Dame's outfield looks like it will be one of the team's biggest assets. Returning senior starters Scott Rogers and John Loughran will play left field and right field, respec­tively. 
Senior captain Ken Soos is academically ineligible and will not be able to play center field this spring. In his place, a pair of freshmen, Kevin Smith and Peltier, will prob­ably spend the most time at center field. Loughran is com­ing off a year where he broke the Notre Dame single season hits record. 
"We're looking for our seniors to provide leadership," said Gallo. "Loughran's a two­time Academic All-American, and he will probably hold many 
season  and  career  hitting  
records  by  the  end  of  the  
season."  

Notre Dame's all-around hit­ting attack looks even more

Sorin defeats Stanford for IH title; 
Brown, indoor track team 


Otters win for 3rd time in 4 years 
look to run wild at IC4A's 
By CHRIS PAULISON 
Sports Writer 
Sorin Hall was crowned champion of Men's "A" League lnterhall basketball after defeating Stanford Hall, 56-50, last night in the ACC Pit. This victory marked the third time in the last four years the Otters have brought home the title to Sorin. 
In winning the champion­ship, Sorin responded to the dif­ficult challenge of having to sweep two games in succesive nights from Stanford in this double-elimination tourna­ment. 
The Otters utilized the mo­mentum they gained in their come-from-behind victory over the Studs Tuesday night when they took to the court last night. Sorin junior point guard Sean Cullinan, the game's leading scorer with 14 points,

the ropes, but MacDonald countered with an effective up­percut. Merkle won on a split decision as the crowd went wild. 
Another crowd-pleasing melee arose between Mike "High" Noone and John "Armed & Dangerous" Alber­tini in the Lightweight division, as Noone took the fight in a split decision. The fight started with a flurry of blows on both sides as Noone battered Albertini into the corner for a standing eight count to end the first round. 
Noone continued to nail Al­bertini with straight punches, and Albertini failed to keep his hands up, resulting in a nasty bloody nose. Noone continued to go to the face in the third, but Albertini hung very tough, taking the blows only to sting Noone on the chin. The fight ended with boisterous ap­plause. 
"I was worried about his big­ger reach," said Noone, "and he had a lot of wind. Speed was definitely my strength. Just like last year, the crowd was a big part of the win. The crowd can be the deciding factor." 
In the Welterweight division, Dan "The Guru" Schneider showed no existential mercy against John "The Zoo Animal" Drew in his split decision vic­tory. The bout started out al­most as a wrestling match, as Drew went after Schneider without abandon but Schneider fought him off with inside punches. 
Schneider waited patiently for "The Zoo Animal" to strike commented on how Tuesday night's win effected his team's play last night. 
"We gained a great deal of confidence with that first win, said Cullinan. They're a great team with guys who've been playing together for three years. We came out of the gate strong and were able to build a big early lead. Luckily they just couldn't come all the way back." 
Sorin substitute Dan Reynolds contributed 8 points in the second quarter, helping the Otters jump out to a 34-19 halftime lead. But Stanford, be­hind the hot shooting of swingman Bill Sullivan, came fighting back outscoring the Ot­ters 13-5 in the third quarter. Sullivan, who led Stanford in scoring with 12 points, and Stud's team captain AI Martin continued this surge, closing 
and ambushed him with a mean right. Schneider resorted to grappling when he was in trouble, but he managed to knock the bleeding Drew back as the third round ended in a draw. 
In the Cruiserweight divi­sion, Fred "Earthdog" Ahlholm and Greg "Skid" Rowe ended their war in a split decision to Rowe. In the first round, both fighters traded

the gap tp one point with two minutes left in the game. 
But Sorin regained their composure, and controlled the final two minutes of play. Otter forwards Mark Trautmann and Steve Beuerlein combined on ten of the game's last 15 points, sealing the victory for Sorin. 
"Our play off the bench was the key," said Sorin captain Mike Scotty. "We were able to use nine players, while they stuck with six guys. They made quite a surge in the second half, but they seemed to run out of gas at the end." 
In "B" League action, Off­Campus defeated Dillon Hall last night, 44-39, forcing a final game to decide its divisional champion. This final game for the B League is slated for Sun­day night at 7 p.m. in the ACC Pit.

On Saturday, the Notre Dame track team will com­pete against a talented field of 121 teams in the IC4A meet, traditionally a show­case for the nation's best. 
The Irish hope to improve on last year's im-pressive ninth place finish and defeat teams such as Boston Uni­versity, George Mason, Vil­lanova and Pittsburgh, who will be vying for a place at the top. 
Leading the 11-man Irish contingent will be junior speedster Tim Brown, who has qualified in both the 55­meter dash and as a part of the distance medley relay. 
"Tim Brown is just a great athlete," said Irish head coach Joe Piane. "He is a tremendous competitor." 
Known for his heroics on the football field, Brown has proven that with or without the football he can consis­tently leave his competition in the dust. 
Joining Brown in the 55­meter dash, if the condition of his leg allows, iWill be junior hurdler Tony Ragunas. Freshman hurdler Glen Watson will also try to continue his success in the high hurdles. 
Junior Nick Sparks and sophomore David Warth will pose a double threat in the 1,000-yard run, and the dis­tance medley relay team of senior Robert Nobles, Brown, sophomore Ron Markezich and freshman Mike O'Connor will try to put another winning combina­tion together against stiff competition. 
In the field events, juniors Chris Matteo and Rich Muench have qualified to compete in the pole vault and the triple jump, respec­tively. Freshman Tom Kraus will take care of the shot put duties. 
With a balanced mixture of experience and youth, the Irish stand a good chance of defeating many of the talented East coast teams, but it is a task that will re­quire the best from each member of the team if they are to be successful. 
hard inside punches, with the "Earthdog" taking a slight ad­vantage. 
Rowe, who actually is not homeless, was a relentless punching machine. Ahlholm came right back at Rowe, but neither could effectively follow their leading strikes. The fight ended with Ahlholm resisting Rowe's inside barrage and catching an off-balance Rowe with a hard right.

game, but also leads the team 
in steals with 44. Most impor­
tantly, Presto is Miami's three­
point specialist. Presto shoots 
a stunning .406 (67-of-165) be­
hind the 19-foot line, which out­
strips the combined total for 
the Irish (31-of-94, .330). 
Presto also leads Miami in 
free throw percentage, burning 
the twine at a .905 clip. 
Foster should substitute 
freely for Miami. Every player 
except for one on the bench 
averages at least 10 minutes 
per game, and that means a 
host of Hurricane reserves. 
Forwards Dennis Burns (8.1 
points, 3.3 rebounds), Lemuel 
Howard (7.0, 3.4), Tim Dawson 
(6.6, 5.1), Mark Richardson 
(6.2, 3.8) and Mike Noblet (4.3, 
2.2) all provide Foster with the depth to support his run-and­gun offense. 
Noblet and sophomore guard 
Joel Warren will compliment 
Presto's shooting from three­
point range, along with an oc­
casional toss by Brown. With 
Horford roaming the boards, 
the Hurricanes hope that the 
bombs that don't fall in the net 
wind up in Horford's hands. 
For all of this free-wheeling 
offense (the Hurricanes 
average 75.9 points per contest, 
somewhat higher than the 64.7 
for the Irish), where the 'Canes 
lack is on defense. Miami al­
lows its opponents to score 76.1 
points every game. 
Losses to common opponents North Carolina (122-77), Duke (74-67), Kansas (82-47), and Dayton (92-78) have served notice that the fledgling pro­gram still has a long way to go.

Tennis team hopes to rebound from injuries 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
Having compiled a 5-5 record so far this season despite the injuries of three key players, the men's ten­nis team will hope to keep overcoming the injury ob­stacles this weekend at Madison, Wisconsin. 
Notre Dame will face the University of Wisconsin at noon on Saturday, then will play Gustavus Adolphus on Sunday at 10 a.m. 
"Wisconsin's in the middle of the pack in the Big Ten, and we've been having trou­ble with Big Ten teams recently, so we're looking for a tough match," said Head Coach Tom Fallon. "We haven't played Gus­tavus Adolphus in a couple of years, but they usually have a good team. They're a Division II school but pretty strong." 
The Irish have had to go without the services of starters Brian Kalbas, Paul Daggs, and Tony Cahill at some point in the season be­cause of injuries. Cahill is still out, but Kalbas and Daggs have now returned to the lineup. 
Fallon has credited the play of three individuals who have stayed healthy throughout the season -Tim Carr, Dan Walsh, and Mike Wallace-for keeping Notre Dame competitive during the injury-plagued season. 
"Carr, our top seed, has played well. Dan Walsh has been alternating between the fifth and sixth seed has had a pretty good year. He beat his opponents from both Ohio and Ohio State last weekend, and he's playing well right now," said Fallon. "Mike Wallace, the fresh­man, lost his match at Ohio State, but that's the first match he's lost this season." 
In this weekend's matches, Carr will be the top seeded player, followed by Dave Reiter, Kalbas, Wal­lace, Walsh, and Daggs. The doubles teams will be Carr 
and  Reiter,  Daggs  and  
Walsh,  and  Wallace  and  
Sean O'Brien.  
"If  everyone's  at  full  

strength, we're hoping to give them some good matches," said Fallon. "Even with us not having Cahill in the lineup, we may not win both matches, but we'll give them better matches than they think."

New ACHA becomes a positive stjep in rebirth of hockey 
By MIKE CHMIEL Sports Writer 
The Kent State Golden Flashes will face off against the Michigan-Dearborn Wolves in the American Collegiate Hockey Association's first ever playoff game this Saturday in the ACC Fieldouse. 
Following the showdown be­tween the No. 2 and No. 4 teams in the ACHA, the regular season champion Lake Forest Foresters will face the Irish in an attempt to advance to Sat­urday's final round and cap­ture the ACHA's first two titles, in what has been a successful first year for the ACHA, accor­ding to Notre Dame Assistant Athletic Director and ACHA Commissioner Brian Boulac. 
"We developed this league because all four schools felt we had something in common," Boulac said. "We're Division I hockey programs with not a lot of financial aid. This league, in its inception, has been compet­itive, and as a result, all four teams played evenly-matched games. We've achieved what we were looking for."

Notre Dame hockey has found a home in the ACHA. Mike Chmiel details the reaction to the new league in preparation for this weekend's playoffs at the ACC.

Dearborn formed the ACHA last June while sharing "a com­mon phi,losophy educationally, athletid1lly, and financially." Financial concerns have plagued each of the schools in the league and have resulted in few, if any, scholarships and little financial aid being made available to hockey players. 
The schools which treat hockey as their primary sport and are able to fund scholar­ships, get the top players each year and easily rise above less­funded programs. The ACHA brought four financially­strapped indepenedents to­gether with hopes of giving these hockey programs and players something to shoot for at the end of the season -an ACHA Championship. 
"We're very, very happy," Lake Forest Head Coach Tony Fritz said. "We needed a league to give our season some meaning. The league is very important to us." 
After the University downgraded the Irish hockey team from varsity status to club status, the Irish became a dominant force in the Central States Collegiate Hockey League before they moved back to Division I as an inde­pendent in 1984. Prior to 1983, the Irish had played in the Western and Central Collegiate Hockey Associations. 
According to Boulac, mem­bership in a league was impor­tant for the Irish because the hockey team is unable to enjoy the independent status of the a football or basketball program which is able to aim for postseason action and a na­tional title. The hockey team "really had no other goal to shoot for," Boulac said. 
NotrP. Dame's desire to form a league and its ability to manage a league with its ad­ministrative and public rela­tions staffs spurred interest in the ACHA and encouraged the other schools to join the Irish. 
"When you're playing as an independent and without schol­arships, there's not really any chance for us to go out and hope to achieve an NCAA tourna­ment bid," Notre Dame Head Coach "Lefty" Smith ex­plained. "As a result, you go all season long, and you're just playing for a record. By having a league, it gives you a little bit of incentive as far as playing, and it also gives you a little something to shoot for at the end of the year." 
League play involves a home-and-home series for each of the schools. Each series in­volves back-to-hack games at a school on Friday and Satur­day nights. 

The ACHA crowns both a reg­ular season champ and a tourn­ament champ. This year's league action saw Lake Forest taking first with an 8-3-1 record in the league and a 15-8-1 record overall. Kent State took second with a 7-5-0 (18-12-0) mark. The Irish wound up in third 4-7-1 (9­18-1) while Michigan-Dearborn finished at 3-7-2 09-18-2). 
"For the first year, we have achieved our goals," Smith said. "We've come to respect one another. We've had very close competition within the league. Everyone in the league has beaten everyone else which is good because you have a lot of parity in the league." 
This weekend's ACHA Cham­pionships will feature two rounds. A tournament cham­pion will be crowned Saturday night. A league Most Valuable Player and ACHA All-Star team will also be named at an ACHA luncheon tomorrow. 
While the ACHA teams have enjoyed the competition in their new league and look for­ward to the season-ending weekend at Notre Dame, there appears to be a general belief in a need to bring two to four more teams into the ACHA in the near future. An eight-or six-team league would result in an even greater level of com­petition. 
"In the future, hopefully, we may be able to attract other schools to play hockey at this level," Boulac said. "We've got a solid base, the competition will continue to improve, we're growing together more as a unit, and we're starting to have something other people will be looking for. Other schools will look at us to see if we stay to­gether." 
According to Smith, many in collegiate hockey have with­held praise for the ACHA be­cause it is a new venture that may or may not survive, and the caliber of competition may still be in doubt. 
"It's an excellent idea," Smith said. "Unfortunately, a four-team league is not as nice as having a six-or an eight­team league, but everything has to start some place. We do envision the fact that within the next two to three years, this league will grow to six or eight teams. Then of course, it will be that much more bona fide." 
Fritz also shares a desire to 
increase the membership in the 
ACHA. Fritz explained that the 
league's format is well­
designed, but more teams 
would make it "more viable." 
According to Smith, the ACHA will also have to attend to other housekeeping details such as officiating and statis­tics. Smith hopes to find more qualified and experienced offi­cials for the league. Smith also hopes to have statistics pub­lished on a weekly basis in an effort to help the coaches and promote the league. 
"We have survived the first year-we've survived it without a lot of serious problems," Smith noted. "We've had close­ness of competition, and if you look outside the scope of our area, our teams have done quite well against outside com­petition. We've certainly an­swered a lot of questions that outsiders had."

SMC swimmers head for NAIA meet in Milwaukee 
If postive mental attitude has anything to do with success, the Saint Mary's varsity swim team stands a good chance of a strong showing at the NAIA Nationals, which will take place on Friday and Saturday at the Walter Schroeder Aquatics Center in Milwaukee. 
Ten members of the team qualified for the com­petition by meeting certain time standards during the regular season. The swimmers will represent Saint Mary's in seven events. 
Senior Margaret Mannion, juniors Meghan Raf­ferty and Jennifer Veselik, and freshman Erin Tierney will swim in 400-yard medley, while Raf­ferty, Tierney, sophomore Peggy Halloran and freshman Julie Courtney will compete in the 400­yard freestyle relay. 
Mannion, senior Patty Juckniess, and sop­homores Mary Beth Hogan and Jenny McDougall will swim in the 200-yard medley, while the team of Juckniess, Rafferty, Tierney and senior Mary Fisher will swim the 200-yard freestyle relay, the Belles' most promising event. 
"Our 200 free relay has a really good time," said Head Coach Nancy Jo Kuzmitz. "They qualified at 1:49.83, and there is a good possibility that they could make it into the top 12." 
Fisher, the Belles' team captain, is equally hope­ful for success in this relay. 
"This year our qualifying time in the 200 free

relay was even lower than it was at nationals last year, so· I think we have a really strong chance of getting to the finals in this event," she said. 
Three Saint Mary's swimmers have qualfied for individual events. Mannion and Tierney made the optional time in the 100-yard breaststroke, com­pleting the event in 1:16.95 and 1:17.11, respective­ly. Rafferty qualfied for the optional time in the 100-yard backstroke, which she swam in 1:08.02. 
The swimmers are quite prepared for the event, according to Kuzmitz, who is eager to attend the competition. 
"We're ready for this big meet," she said. 

"We've been working on meeting the cutoff times for nationals all season, so I think we're well prepared for it." 
Much of the Belles' positive attitude stems from their 5-4 season record, an improvement over past years. In addition, the team ended its season on a positive note, placing fourth at the Grand Rapids Invitational, where Saint Mary's totaled over 200 points. 
"We posted our best times at that meet," Kuz­mitz said. "Ending our season like that was a real plus for us." 
Fisher noted that some changes in the team's season schedule helped the team to improve as well. 
"This year we swam teams that were more in our league, more at our level," she said. "We swam more Tri-Meets, too, which gave us more competition. Our times went up and we benefitted a lot from that." 
While the Belles' first aim is to reach the finals in one or more events at Nationals, their optimistic attitude could result in their achieving an even greater end, receiving All-American or Academic All-American honors.
