WASIIINCTON (AI') -Confu­sion over President Bush's posi­tion on higher taxes slowed eongressional efforts Wednes­day to start work in earnest on a nnw budget agrnement. 
Bush showed no inclination to elarify matters, saying, "Let Congrr.ss elear it up." and threatening to shut down the government again if he doesn't gnt an aeceptahln deal. 
Congressional Democrats complained that an apparent Bush rejection of higher taxes on tlw wnalthiest Americans ­a revnrsal of thn position he took at his news eonference Tunsday -would make it tougher to forge a budget r,om­promise. 
But thnre was no shortage of options, as both Republieans and Democrats began floating new versions of tax and spend­ing plans on Capitol Hill. 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and other law­makers who met with the pres­ident Tuesday night said he had not ruled out the tax boost at that private meeting, as re­ported by Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore. 
White House spokesman Mar­lin Fitzwater told reporters that Bush "listened to" the GOP lawmakers rather than stating a position. 
Bush, on a campaign trip in the South, was asked repeatedly about the matter, but turned away the questions with wisecracks. 
He was asked as he jogged during a break in St. Peters­burg, Fla.. if he would care to clear up the confusion. 
'Confusion?" he responded. 
Was he giving up on his long­sought capital gains tax rate cut, the item the Democrats supposedly were to trade for his support of higher income taxes on rich people? 
"Read my hips," he said, pointing, as he jogged by. Could he clear up his posi­
tion? 
"Let Congress clear it up." 
At a fundraising reception in Atlanta, Bush said he vetoed the temporary spending bill last weekend, shutting down the

Events to focus on alcohol abuse 
By CORINNE PAVLIS 
Saint Mary's Editor 
WllllnesSMC hopes to "raise the student consciousness eon­eerning alcohol abuse on col­lege campuses." said Well­nesSMC director Sue Medley. 
Part of this effort includes a 
spench by Mark Bambek. pro­
fessor of chemistry at Saint 
Mary's, who will address the 
community on the effects of al­
cohol. 
The lecture is part of a series sponsored by WellnnsSMC. the Saint Mary's College wellness program. The organization will sponsor evnnts over the next two weeks in recognition of National Collegiate Alcohol Awareness Week. 
Medley also hopes the pro­grams will present "educational information and some positive alternatives to alcohol consumption." 
The lecture, "Chemical Ef­feets of Alcohol." will be given LeMans Hall at Saint Mary's campus on friday. The event will be preceded by a "Mocktail Hour" at 6 p.m. The event is co-sponsored by the Saint Mary's residence life staff. 
WellnesSMC will also be re­leasing the results of a study conducted on Saint Mary's campus last Spring. The study involved a survey of student use of alcohol and drugs. 
Future events include a tail­gate party before the Air Force game. Beginning at 8:30 a.m., the tailgater will be held on the main avenue leading to Saint Mary's. 
Immediately following the game, a pig roast will take place, co-sponsored by McCan­dless Hall, in front of the Cushwa-Leighton Library. Tickets for the pug roast are priced at $5 per person and are available at the McCandless parietals desk. 
On Oct. 15, a student panel discussion entitled "You and Your Lifestyles: Choices at Saint Mary's College" will be held at 8 p.m. in Stapleton Lounge of LeMans Hall. 
On Oct. 19, a happy hour, open to all Saint Mary's stu­dents, faculty, staff, adminis­trators, and guests, will be held in the Haggar College Center parlor from 4 to 6 p.m. 
In addition, WellnesSMC is S(J.-:"~"ring "Oktoberfest" in conjunction with several local eating and drinking establish­ments. Bracelets will be pro­vided for students who do not wish to drink alcohol while visiting these bars and restau­rants. 
Students wearing the bracelets will receive free soda from servers at the establish­ments during the week of Oct. 15-20. 
Also during the week, Well­nesSMC student members will tie red ribbons on car an­tennas to remind drivers to drink responsibly and to dis­courage driving while under the influence. 
Bracelets, a lists of partici­pating "Oktoberfest" estab­lishments. and red ribbons will be available outside Haggar College Center daily from 11 a.m. -1 p.m., beginning Oct. 15. 
Alcohol education materials and information on nutrition breaks will also be available throughout the week. For more information, contact the WellnesSMC center at 284­5546. Unless indicated, all events are open to students free of charge. 
Kilbourne says alcohol ads promoting a myth 
By DANNIKA SIMPSON 
News Writer 
Jean Kilbourne, a member of the Board of Directors of the National Council on Alcoholism and an internationally recog­nized media critic, told her au­dience last night, "America has a drug problem," and "Alcohol is the nation's number one drug." 
Her lecture. entitled "Under the Influence," focused on the effect the advertising industry has on the consumption of al­cohol in America. "Alcohol is one of the most heavily adver­tised products in our society," she said. 
She compared the advertise­ments to a myth. "All advertis­ing is essentially myth making; (the advertisers] link alcohol with everything alcoholism de­stroys ... The primary fantasy is that alcohol is a magic potion 
said alcohol aetually destroys dreams. but the industry does not show this side of drinking. 
"Again and again we're told it will make us successful." 
The ads also suggest that al­cohol will make us sexy, in­crease sexual function and is linked with risky behavior. Kil­bourne said, "Shakespeare said it best; drink 'provokes the de­sire, but it takes away the per-formance'." 

She also said the alcohol in­dustry attempts to convince people that excessive drinking is normal. She used Michelob to make her point. Over the pjlst ten years the Michelob slogan have changed four times. First, they claimed, "Holidays were made for Michelob." Next, "Weekends were made for Michelob," and eventually they told eon sum ers to "Put a little weekend in your week." Now Michelob is telling consumers that "The night belongs to Michelob." 
According to Kilbourne. this change in slogan mirrors alco­holic progression; a person starts out as a casual drinker and eventually alcohol con­sumption becomes an every day event. She told the audience, "Image how different it would be if (the slogan) was the night belonged to alcohol." 
Kilbourne also said the alco­hol industry "creates a climate ..,of violence." 
She further stated that, "Women's bodies are dehuman­ized, no where more so than al­cohol ads. One-half of all cases of rape and violence is alcohol related." Statistically. a reported 55 percent of all arrests have some link with alcohol. 
Kilbourne said the three pur­poses of advertising are to re­cruit new users, increase the

Homosexuals deserve our tolerance

response from most students faster than Editor-in-Chief 
they can say "homo­phobia." 
Homophobia is the most dangerous pho­bia ailing Notre Dame students today. Many of those who find the idea of a homosexual lifestyle unappealing also choose to feel re­pulsed by homosexuals themselves. 
Right or wrong, they are entitled to their feelings. But when they allow those feelings to take the form of public and private ha­rassment, and· when they deliberately ostra­cize some students because they are differ­ent, it is time to consider whether such prejudices should be fostered in the com­munity. 
I admire the people who will openly come to terms with their sexuality today. It takes guts. I wish I didn't have to say that about them, because it is alarming that it requires so much courage to openly defy the norm on this campus. 
Notre Dame prides itself on its 'family' atmosphere and 'Christian' community. Yet this same community encourages unhealthy attitudes toward homosexuals. Recognizing National Coming Out Day is a necessary gesture from the students if these negative 
·attitudes are to be eliminated from campus. 
It is unrealistic for the Gays and Lesbians at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's to expect voluntary University recognition of their group. I think they realize that. 
It is not unrealistic for them to expect to 
be treated with the same respect as their heterosexual counterparts. This is what they have asked of the student body through the resolution. The Senate and GSU deserve praise for its open-mindedness. It's a pity the Hall Presidents' Council could not follow suit. 
These people have chosen simply to admit that their sexual preferences differ from the accepted norm, not that they engage in ho­mosexual activities. The Notre Dame 'family' is not violating its mission state­ment or Church doctrines by acknowledging that some of its members are different. 
I urge everyone on this campus to be tol­
erant today. All of you have endured trau­
matic periods in your lives. 
For these people, coming to terms with 
their sexuality is one of the most difficult 
tasks they will ever face. Remember thos~ 
times instead of turning your back on these 
people because you don't like homosexual­
ity. 
Accept them, even if you can't empathize 
with them.

Garry Kasparov, the highest-rated player in chess history, had the white pieces and the slight advantage of the first move Wednesday at the resumption of his world championship defense against Anatoly Karpov. Kasparov, 27, known for his bold, attacking style, and Karpov, 39, who favors methodical, defense-minded strategies, opened their long-awaited match Monday night. After five hours and 30 moves apiece, their first game ended in a draw. Analysts said the turning point of Monday night's game was Kasparov's 19th move; attacking Karpov's white rook with his bishop."Karpov played rather list­lessly in the opening, but Kasparov pressed too hard and nearly let [the game] get away," said grandmaster Joel 
Benjamin of New York. 
INDIANA 
Two days after lawmakers put to­gether a compromise plan to expand the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, a Senate committee's action threatened to delay or kill the legislation. The compromise had been finalized Monday by Republican Sens. Richard Lugar and Dan Coats, and Rep. Peter Visclosky, D-Merrillville, who were confident it would be signed by President Bush before Congress adjourned for the year. But, in an unexpected twist, the Senate Energy and Nat­ural Resources Committee adjourned without vot­ing on the legislation Wednesday morning. The panel abandoned debate after its senior Republi­can, James McClure of Idaho, objected to the es­timated cost of $27 million to buy and beautify about 1,300 new acres for Indiana's only national park.

Bishops tout peace for N. Ireland 
By CATHY FLYNN 
News Writer 
Peace is possible in Northern Ireland if the complexity of the 
issues  are  addressed,  said  
Hishops  Edward  Daly  and  
James Mehaffey.  

"My message is one of hope," said Mehaffny, the Anglican bishop of Derry and Haphoe, Northern Ireland. Mehaffey and Daly, the Catholic bishop of Derry. are travelling together across the U.S. giving talks on the situation in Northern Ire­land. 
The two bishops spoke Wednesday at a panni discus­sion as part of the World Awareness Series: Peace in Ire­land. Mehaffey said that two minist~1rs from both sides of the conflict uniting for peace would have been unheard of ten or 12 years ago. 
"We do a kind of duet," Me­haffey said. "In our community at horne everybody knows that Mehaffey and Daly are friends and some don't like it, but some 
..
d0. 
llesolving the conflict will have to be comprehensive, the bishops said. They stressed that the tension is not merely the result of religious differences. 
"Many people around the world regard the conflict in Northern Ireland as some sort of weird anachronistic, religious war -a throw-back to the Middle Ages," Daly said. "The belief that this problem is only a religious one is an over­simplification of the issue." 
Economic, political, religious and social aspects of the prob­lem need to be dealt with, Me­haffey said. 
"The tensions and conflict are the result of a complex web of history, culture, social and reli­gious aspects," said Mehaffey. "The strands are woven to­gether to form the situation in Northern Ireland." 
History is seen by both bish­ops as a stumbling block in the resolution of the problems. It is an obsession of the Irish, they added. 
"Ilistory is a burden on our back," Mehaffey said. "It should be an inspiration, but. instead, it is a big stick we use to beat the other side with." 
Many Irish people still see the supporters of the British as colonizers. said Daly. This is something which both sides need to be aware of, he said. 
"In Ireland, too many people feel threatened by differences," said Daly. "I only wish we could come to see that both groups have a richness." 
The Anglo-Irish Agreement, signed by both Britain and the Republic of Ireland in 1985, is a sign of hope, the bishops agreed. It recognizes the ri'ghts of both sides to seed fulfillment of their goals while rejecting all violent methods. 
Regular meetings between the two countries were also estab­lished with the creation of an inter-governmental conference. "Britain and the Republic of Ireland have shown strong support for the agreement since 1985 and this is a good sign," said Mehaffey. 
The fact that political deci­sions about Northern Ireland are still made in England does not please Mehaffey, he said. Greater cooperation could lead to more respect, he said. 
"Fear is often at the heart of problems in Northern Ireland," Mehaffey said. "Acts of violence increase this distrust," Daly added. 
Bloody Sunday propelled Daly into the international spotlight on January 30, 1972. He was photographed with many of the victims of the violent demon­stration. 
"War is glorified by a lot of people for their own interest," said Daly. He warned, however, that "war is obscene." 
Some of the worst hate-mail that Daly has ever read comes from the United States, he said. It is time that people moved away from the old romantic ideas concerning the English­Irish conflict, he added. 
"My father was in the old IRA (Irish Republican Army) and I was very proud of that," he said. "However, I cannot identify with today's IRA." 
Violence does not solve prob­lems, Daly said. One way that Americans can help the situa­tion is by investing in the region and by forming stronger ties to universities in the area. 
"Your great nation and ours should be rededicated to the American dream," said Daly. "I mean this in an international sense." 

University offers free computer training to interested NO students

Tho problem: you have a pa­per due the next day and you havn no due how to use a com­puter, so you panic and end up having to make excuses to your professor. 
The solution: attend a com­puter training class offered by the Ollice of University Comput­ing. 
Thn classes, which began on Oct. I, will run through Friday. They offer free instruction to Notre Dame, St. Mary's and Holy Cross students who have never used a computer for word processing. 
"Attending this class well be­fore a paper is due will save students a lot of time and frus­tration during the crunch," said Dave Mastic, training specialist and manager of the program. "When a paper is duo, the last thing a student has to worry about is trying to learn how to use a computer."

Classes for the spring semester are also currently be­ing discussed.

The alcohol and tobacco in­dustries have denied they are advertising for these purposes, she said. They claim they are only trying to get people to switch brands. She refuted this assertion and explained how advertisers target women, mi­norities, and young people. Kil­bourne said these advertise­ments "stress freedom, inde­pendence, power, and control." Actually, alcohol takes these things away. 
The ads aimed at young women try to convince them that alcohol will increase their independence, but they fail to show that "women suffer greater physiological damage" than men. She also said women are more prone to be cross-ad­dicted (taking prescription drugs) and stigmatized. Fur­thermore, alcohol consumption during pregnancy is the primary cause of birth defects. 
Kilbourne gave a list of the signs of an alcoholic. They in­clude: missing classes or work, experiencing blackouts, changes in a person's tolerance to alcohol and defensiveness about drinking. She indicated that a high tolerance for alcohol in a young person is a symptom of alcoholism and urged anyone with a drinking problem to seek help through Alcoholic Anonymous or the University Counseling Center.

The conventional wisdom 
that there are limited 
employment opporunities for 
liberal arts graduates will be 
challenged this week by the 
twelfth annual Arts and 
Letters Career Day. 
The Career Day. sponsored 
by Notre Dame's Career and 
Placement Services office, is 
aimed at acquainting 
students in Arts and Letters 
with the various career 
options they might consider 
upon graduating. 
Career Day will be held 
today from noon to 4 p.m. in 
the Center for Continuing 
Edueation (CCE). Students 
from all colleges will be wel­
come. 
Representatives from 
more than thirty industries 
will have booths at this 
"career fair." They will provide interested students with information they may find helpful in their explo­ration of career possibilities. Among the industries repre­sented will be: advertising, fi­nancial services. journalism, personnel management, pub­lishing, and public relations. 
"Attending Career Day is a great way for students to ob­tain a lot of career information in a short amount of time," ac­cording to Paul Reynolds, associate director of Career and Placement Services. 
Reynolds said Career Day would be beneficial for both seniors and underclassmen. "It's important for sophomores and juniors to begin searching for career information as soon as possible" said Reynolds, "so they can make their career de­cision making easier down the road."

PMS, a disorder defined by Karen Lesch as, "a cluster of symptoms that appears in a woman's cycle between ovula­tion and the start of the men­strual flow" is a fact. 
Lesch, a nurse practitioner who specializes in gynecology and obstetrics, related some surprising news about Premen­strual Syndrome (PMS) in a lec­ture at Notre Dame yesterday. 
Seventy to ninety percent of women experience premen­strual symptoms to some degree or another at some time in their lives, said Lesch. Between five and ten percent of this group suffer from severe PMS that impairs their ability to function. 
The extent and the duration of physical, emotional, and psychological symptoms of PMS vary from woman to woman, said Lesch. "I've found that the most common complaint from PMS sufferers has been the feelingofbeingoutofcontrol." 
Lesch said that, partly due to these problematic symptoms, no 
one knows for sure what causes 
PMS. 
She said that physicians often dismiss PMS as fiction because of the lack of medical knowledge about the syndrome. "In this high tech age it is often difficult for doctors to deal with the ignorance about PMS." 
Some of the inconclusive and often contradictory theories about the causes of PMS in­clude: 
 
Ovarian disfunction in which the ovary does not product the correct levels of estrogen and progesterone hormones; 

 
Hormone and fluid imbal­ance; 

 Poor nutrition; 

 
The release of prostaglandins, short distance chemical messages that send pain messages to the uterus; 

 Lack of sleep and exercise; 

 
Psychological or cultural problems. 


Lesch refuted the theory that PMS is a product of "neurotic, over-educated women who use it as an excuse for not being able to be all things to all peo­ple." 
She cited studies from all over the world that have affirmed the universal scope of the syndrome. 
The existence of one specific drug that will cure the PMS symptoms is also a fiction. She listed vitamin E and B complex, motrin, and other common over the counter aspirins and mild diuretics as drugs that help some women some of the time. 
Lesch personally advocates a more holistic approach to treatment of symptoms. She suggests a high carbohydrate diet, small frequent meals, and the elimination of caffeine, al­cohol, tobacco, and sugary, salty foods from the diet. 
"From all of women I have observed, one of the only defi­nite things I can say is that caf­feine makes PMS worse." She asks PMS sufferers to try to keep a high self esteem and a sense of humor. 
To aid in the latter she quoted a friend who claims, "There is no such thing as PMS. Women are just too nice the rest of the month." 
GSU recognizes Coming-Out Day 
By KATE MANUEL 
News Writer 
The Graduate Student Council passed a resolution recognizing National Coming-Out Day last night in their second meeting of the academic year, with a vote of 19 for, sev·en against, and three abstaining. 
Secretary Karen Slawner in­troduced the resolution by say­ing, "It was suggested at the last officers meeting that the Graduate Student Council (GSC) in some way recognize National Coming-Out Day. We recognize that there are almost as many views on homosexuality as there are individuals in this room. But, we want to use this opportunity to condemn any discrimination against gays and lesbians on this campus." 
Mike Clinton, a member of the GSC, supported the passage of the resolution by saying, "I don't think this resolution is really directed against university 
the GSU, presided at this meet­ing of the Graduate Student Council. 
The GSC also devoted time to discussing fundraising efforts for Zhenge-de Wang, a graduate student injured in a hit-and-run accident last spring. 
Executive Vice-President Edna Hidekel, chairperson of the ad hoc committee on fundraising, reported that the GSU had raised over seven hundred dollars for this cause at last weekend's concession stand. "This amount is going directly to Zhenge-de from the GSU," she said. 
According to Hidekel, another concession stand, selling shirts, will be operated at the Century Center on the next two week­ends, during the welcoming mixers for Notre Dame and Air Force and Miami fans, respec­tively. 
Also on the agenda, the GSC approved the purchase of a $2,200 laserwriter for use in the Graduate Student Union (GSU) office. 
According to Vice-Presi­dent/Treasurer Catharine Hawes, financing this purchase will not significantly diminish the GSU budget because of money left over from last spring. 
"We have money left over that was not spent last year. Toward the end of last year the graduate school found out that there were about two hundred more of us than they thought," she said. 
Reports were presented to the GSC by chairpersons of the GSU standing committees. 
Social Officer Reynold Nesiba reminded members of the Grad Club get-togethers on Fridays at the Alumni/Senior Club or Wilson Commons. He also told of plans to host a Halloween party for the children of gradu­ate students and faculty, a Hal­loween party for graduate stu­dents themselves, a viewing of 

the Tennessee game  at  the  
Alumni/Senior Club,  and  a  
Christmas party.  

Tom D'Andrea, chair of the intellectual committee described plans for bringing speakers on curriculum reform to campus, for hosting a forum in which individuals discuss the contribution they feel their spe­cialty area makes to the whole university, and for sponsoring a seminar on faith and intellectual life with the topic of pluralism, truth, and authority. 
Srini Sudramanian, chair of the International Graduate Student committee, said there will be monthly talks on issues of international importance; the first of these talks will be in November on the Gulf Crisis. 
The Quality of Life committee, chaired by Paul Voida, will be investigating the possibility of university-wide day care on campus and will be involved in working with Campus Ministry to put together an ecumenical worship service for graduate students. 
Defining a role for the GSU in the Year of Women and compil­ing a resource directory for graduate students are the pri­orities of the Women's Resource committee, according to its co­chairperson Greg Bazan. 
Shar'ron Harris, chairperson of the Libraries committee, conveyed a reminder that cards from the copy machine vendor in the library should be used before the end of October.

NO participates in day-long 'distance education' event 
By FRANK RIVERA News Writer 
The University of Notre Dame was among fourteen colleges and universities in Indiana to participate in the day-long In­diana Conference on Technolo­gies for Distance Education (ICTDE). 
The conference, conducted by the Indiana Higher Education Telecommunication System (IHETS) television network and the colleges and universities, serves as "a very good oppor­tunity to show the state of In­diana how distance education takes place," said Sister Elaine DesRosiers. director of Educa­tional Media. 
"Distance education" is a phrase used by IHETS, to de­scribe formal instruction which uses modern communication technologies to surmount the geographical separation of the teacher from the student, and is not new to the University, ac­cording to DesRosiers. 
"This is the first time there is a conference to teach people about it," said DesRosiers. "We have been doing this for several years. The engineers, for exam­ple. teach classes via satellite to many businesses across the country."

By KATE KECKLER News Writer 
Salary offers to graduating chemical engineers are up 6.6% to $35, 112 per year, according to the College Placement Coun­cil. 
The demand for chemical engineers is still rising, said 
Inc., the conference featured locally planned sessions at host campuses allowing participants to interact with colleagues and investigate local facilities. 
"With the building of the new classroom building and the Peace Institute," said DesRosiers, "the potential for Notre Dame's doing more with teaching here and having lis­teners elsewhere is going to be on the rise with our new tech­nology." 
The teleconference included addresses by John Mutz, presi­dent of Lilly Endowment, Inc., John Worthen, president of Ball State University and Philip Swain, director of Continuing Engineering Education at Pur­due University and chair of the ICTDE steering committee.

"Coastal flooding and beach erosion will probably be the main problem that it will pro­duce," he said. "The further north the system goes, the closer it will get to the coast." 
Marco's southwest winds were expected to push tides 1 to 3 feet above normal, scour the coast's sandy beaches and dump 3 or more inches of rain in some sections. 
Storm warnings were in effect from the Dry Tortugas through Key Largo, including Florida Bay, and northward along the Southwest Florida coast to Cedar Key at the southern edge of the Big Bend region.

Corporate division president talks at Saint Mary's Business luncheon 
By CORINNE PAVLIS 
Saint Mary's Editor 
Success for American corpo­rations in the global market­place, according to Beth Bron­ner, president of the sweet goods division of the Slim-Fast Corporation, will depend on their ability to understand both their audiences and themselves. 
Bronner, addressed the Saint Mary's Business Associates fall luncheon yesterday. 
"Education for a global mar­ketplace means educating our­selves not only about who our customers are, but also about who our employees are and how we can use their personal and educational strengths to succeed in new and challenging market," said Bronner. 
With boundaries between 
countries and barriers to inter­
national trade dissolving, 
Bronner said the world has, in 
effect, become a smaller place. 
Bronner added that to remain 
competitive in this "shrinking" 
environment, American corpo­
rations must initiate employ­
ment policies that provide 
equity in pay scales and execu­
tive level positions, especially 
for minorities and women. 
"There's little to keep 
women earning sixty-three 
cents on her male 
counterpart's dollar here (in 
the United States) when she 
can earn parity pay in a 
foreign country less dominated 
by the "old boy" network and 
attitudes," Bronner said. 
Bronner also addressed the difficulty of marketing Ameri­can products in new today's new markets. "Just as some idioms lose something in the translation, so do some prod­ucts," said the Slim-Fast executive. "What flies in Philadelphia may flop in Finland. A borderless world does not automatically lead to a universal taste in products, " added Bronner. 
Bronner said that U.S. cor­porations must "learn to adapt, like chameleons, to the surroundings in which they want to succeed, rather than attempt to change the world to fit American standards." 
Stressing the need to adapt products to local preferences, Bronner said, "If you try to de­sign one product that pleases everybody, it ends up pleasing no one at all. To succeed glob­ally, companies must decide which markets they can please with their products and ser­vices, and go after those ripe opportunities, rather than try to fit square pegs into the proverbial and unprofitable, round hole." 
The trick, according to Bronner, is assessing each fragment of a market to deter­mine and accommodate local cultural preferences. "In mak­ing these assessments, global marketers must be as good at gathering information as they are in acting upon that infor­mation," said Bronner. 
"Fortunately, we've got a speedier flow of information available to us than was ever possible before," explained

Bronner. She added that to­day's corporations have no more excuses to be operating on "yesterday's news." 
"Although some companies have failed miserably by trying to do the equivalent of selling ice cubes to Eskimos," said Bronner, "many corporations that are basing their business plans on accurate knowledge of the international market, and carrying those plans through with the needed modifications required in various countries, are succeeding." 
Bronner concluded by reiterating that today's corporations "are finding that it is, indeed, a small world after all." 
Before joining Slim-Fast, Bronner held a variety of mar­keting positions at Haagen­Dazs, Nabisco, and Fleis­chmann division. 
Bronner holds a bachelor's degree from Vassar College and an M.B.A. from the university of Chicago Graduate School of Business. She has been a guest speaker at several industry and university conferences on the role of women in the corporate world. Bronner has also been profiled in various national publications, including USA Today, Working Woman, Savvy, and Fortune.

Entrepreneur urges: Follow Disney's advice 
By MEREDITH McCULLOUGH 
Business Writer 
John McCormack, Inc. magazine's "hottest en­trepreneur in America," spoke to Notre Dame students yester­day on the secrets of his suc­cess. 
According to McCormack, the key to success is holding on to a dream until it becomes a real­ity and then helping other peo­ple carry out their own dreams. 
Basing his life on this philos­ophy, McCormack has gone from being a New York police­man, to a Wall Street stockbro­ker, to the owner of a promi­nent chain of Texas-based sa­lons, called Visible Changes. His experience as franchise founder has earned him the reputation of being an authority on fran­chising and small business eco­nomics. 
In his lecture, McCormack, who had no college education and no management training, stressed the importance of learning about success by fol­lowing the examples of success­ful people. 
"Anybody who wants to start a business should study under an entrepreneur," said McCor­q~ack. "If you want to learn how to make it you have to go to someone who has." 
McCormack attributes his success to the valuable lessons he learned while working under a variety of men who had come to the United States penniless, uneducated, and friendless and yet became millionaires. He challenged students to listen to the advise he received from these successful men and apply it to their own lives. 
Stressing the importance of faith in oneself, McCormack told students, "You have to build confidence in yourself or you won't get anywhere." He asked, "how can you make any­thing of yourself if you only know your liabilities and not your assets?" 
McCormack also reassured students that it is acceptable to start out working at the bot­tom. He said, "It is not so terri­ble not being 'in gear' at 28 years old." 
According to McCormack, hard work and determination will pay off in the long run. In his own endeavors, McCormack was turned down by 299 banks before he finally obtained a

Global economics are next wave 
Council discusses increased EEC interaction 
By PATRICK NINNEMAN 
Business Writer 
The Notre Dame Council on International Business Devel­opment met Wednesday to dis­cuss the globalization of na­tional economies. 
Three student speakers, Dar­ren Kew, Mike Boyle and Jim Nappo, presented their experi­ences from summer internships and study in Spain and Great Britain. They discussed the globalization occurring be­tween the markets of the Euro­pean Economic Community, and they offered their own reflec­tions on how these two national economies are dealing with the growing economic interdepen­dence of the world. 
Kew, the council president, studied in Madrid, Spain for six weeks. He discussed the social and political effects of global­ization from the Spanish point of view. 
Kew noted that the increased competition of a unified Euro­pean market could disrupt some aspects of the traditional Spanish lifestyle. He quoted a Spanish friend who said "I make enough money to live and to go out for a beer... Why should I work harder?" 
Kew noted the strong en­trepreneurial spirit existing in other Common Market coun­tries such as Germany, and ne­cessity for change in Spain if it hopes to compete. 
Boyle, the council chairman who also studied in Madrid, discussed barriers to globaliza­tion and specifically the barri­ers that exist precluding EEC unification. These barriers are, according to Boyle, border con­trols with regard to foreigners, protectionism and political differences between countries, and the differing fiscal policies of each EEC nation. 
Boyle said that Spain has al­ready made strong economic gains resulting from EEC par­ticipation. The cheap value of the Spanish peseta relative to other European currencies has made Spain an attractive in­vestment opportunity. He said that countries with a stronger currency, like Germany, can in­vest cheaply in productive facil­ities. 
He also noted a flip side to Spain's participation in the Common Market. "The internal (European) market will in­crease competition within the EC such that investment will flow toward the most produc­tive regions," he said. He ar­gued that if Spain does not be­come more productive, the pre­sent high level of investment will slip away. 
Jim Nappo, the council's in­ternship chairman, who worked as an intern for Dow Chemical at the company's London office, was the last speaker. He worked on a project that stud­ied the pan-European cultural acceptability of an environmen­tally safe meat wrap. 
Working on this project, Nappo realized the interna­tional view a company must take in developing an product. "The British did not seem to care about an environmentally safe plastic, while the West Germans we talked with seemed extremely interested," he said. 
Nappo noted that companies unwilling to take this global perspective will not be able to compete with companies that take an international approach to marketing. 
loan to open Visible Changes. 
Once McCormack set up his salons, strong employee rela­tions were crucial to his con­tinuing success. 
McCormack believes that "the company was successful be­cause we actually gave people who didn't dream the ability to dream." 
Discussing the high caliber of his employees he said, "If you really want to get some­thing out of people, you must first give them something such as self-esteem." 
Programs such as profit­sharing and employee group vacations boost morale and make employees feel they are truly part of the company. Mc­Cormack said that such a re­ward system is an effective way to maintain high standards. 
Once standards are set, the customers know the quality that can be expected and con­tinue to come back, said Mc­Cormack. "In the long run what you thought was acceptable productivity at one time be­comes not acceptable." The higher McCormack sets the standards, the more successful his salons become. 
McCormack concluded by challenging students to follow the advice of Walt Disney: Think about the values you want to live by, believe in your­self, dream about what you want to happen, and dare to turn your dreams into realities. 
The lecture, entitled "Wake Up America-the Recess is Over," was the third in the Siegfried Lecture Series in en­trepreneurial studies. 
Financial consultant gives insurance advice 
By KEVIN GRUBEN 
Business Writer 
In choosing an insurance pol­icy, time and in-depth research are critical components of the search, according to Joyce Wegs, a financial consultant with the Equitable Financial Companies. 
A former faculty member, Wegs focused her presentation around life insurance: who needs it, which type is best suited for each individual, and how to go about purchasing certain policies. 
Wegs said she did not see the need for single, independent people to enter into life insur­ance policies unless they are ei­ther planning for the future or are interested in leaving money to dependent beneficiaries. 
She emphasized the need for life insurance, however, for those who have others depen­dent on their income, whether they be a spouse, children, or elderly parents. 
"Many people don't like to talk to other members of their family ... it's too painful of a subject," said Wegs, stressing the need for families to be open about the sudden absence of a provider and to discuss the ramifications of a premature death. 
With so many insurance poli­cies available today, she urged those looking into purchasing policies to seek professional advice before entering into one. 
"Be wary of policies where you have to continue to prove that you are healthy. Question policies which are cheaper­usually this mea.1s that the in­surance company is not count­ing on paying it," she warned. 
Wegs also advised purchasing one policy rather than buying several small ones. 
The lecture, co-sponsored by the Hesburgh Library and the Accountancy Department, in conjunction with The Year of Women, was the second in­stallment in a six part series titled, "Understanding and Managing Family Resources." The series· will continue through April.

States were not dependent on 
foreign oil for 50 percent of our 
petroleum imports, then we 
would not be entrenched in 
Saudi Arabia. 
Smant stated that, "The United States must have oil to function..." and that President Bush should not be held re­sponsible for the quantum leap in oil imports over the last ten years (the Reagan/Bush years). A good capitalist can hardly fault consumer's natural reac­tion to the low petroleum prices in the 80's, but a good citizen may find it difficult to exonerate the Reagan/Bush years where funds for research on al­ternative energy sources were eut by 75 percent. One can still forgive President Bush for that fiasco, but one cannot forgive him for continuing to ignore such research when it's obvious that such technology would be very useful right now at limiting our vulnerability to Hussein. 
Although President Bush been reluctant to increase alternative energy funding, he has called for a reevaluation of the oil industry's proposals to develop oil fields on the coast of Alaska and in other sensitive areas. Regardless of how one views the environmental conse­quences of such development, it will take at least eight years for these oil fields to even begin to produce a marketable quantity of oil. Eight years is a long time to be in Saudi Arabia. 
The Bush Administration has promised to veto a Senate bill which raises the national au­tomobile mileage average from 23 mpg to 25 mpg by 1991 with incremental gains in the future and the goal of 30 rripg. The Reagan administration actually tried to lower the national av­erage down to 21 mpg. The auto industry has the technol­ogy to implement this today; in fact, they've had it for years. The improved gas efficiency gained by this bill would make up for the loss in Kuwait oil production in less than three years, as opposed to an eight year wait for an increase in domestic production. While an increase in domestic production might temporarily serve to sa­tiate our hunger for oil, the gas

efficiency legislation will reduce 
our dependence on oil now and 
in the future. Furthermore, if 
the bill's goal of a 30 mpg na­
tional average is ever achieved, 
it would not even matter if the 
oil fields of Saudi Arabia were 
lost to an Iraqi attack. The auto 
industry has the technology to 
meet a national fuel economy 
standard of 40 mpg by the year 
2000; thus, the current Senate 
goal of 30 mpg is fairly 
moderate in its provisions. 
Smant is probably correct: 
President Bush should not ig­
nore the threat to American in­
terests in the Persian Gulf while 
reflecting, "Damn! If I'd only 
c:onvinced Honnie to boost that 
fuel economy standard back in 
1985..." However, it is his job 
to reflect on past lessons and 
perhaps work toward a time 
when it may not be necessary 
to risk American lives, budget 
accords and political skins over 
a few billion barrels of oil.

Problems dismissed by the insecure 

Dear Editor: 
On Friday, I was disturbed to read a letter written by Susan Loveless. (The Observer, Oct.5) She seems to be frightened by the prospect of "Coming Out Day" for the gays and lesbians of Notre Dame, fearing that such deserved recognition would infringe upon her rights as a heterosexual. She goes on to provide what she terms "absurd solutions for an absurd problem." 
However, she fails to provide any reasoning behind her assertion that her rights will be infringed. She relates the ex­ample of the oppression of Saint Mary's students, hardly a fitting analogy. Are Saint Mary's students constantly victims of blatant harassment, literature on the bathroom walls, and overt threats usually of physical violence by those who deem it so necessary to establish their own heterosexuality? 
the infringement she spoke of? Taking away some of the spot­light? Just like. in history, every year has been the year of men, heterosexuality is blatantly cel­ebrated every day, although even that is suppressed by the almighty DuLac. 
Miss Loveless suggests that if gays have enough self-confi­dence, then they do not need to be recognized. Not only is this attitude one that would push homosexuals back into the closet, thus sweeping them un­der the rug so as not to be dealt with. But this attitude fueled the fire of segregation in the 60's which pushed African­Americans into their position as barely recognized humans, and created the forces of sexism that would push women back into the kitchen where they supposedly "belong." 
It is ridiculous to think that a fellow human being does not need to be recognized as such. It is this recognition that Notre Dame's homosexual community seeks, but approval is a loftier goal, considering views of that infallible icon, the Catholic Church, which also seeks to subjugate minorities like women. 
I highly commend the Student Senate in their attempts to rec­ognize National Coming Out Day. This body hopefully will prove that the Notre Dame community is not a racist, sex­ist, homophobic society, and that these ignorances can be overcome through an intelligent and informed recognition that sexuality, like race and gender is a fact, and not an opinion.

The Notre Dame Student Players 
presents 

By MITCH FREEHAUF 
Accent Writer 
Nuns wielding wooden rulers and a throwback to the days when school children could recite the Baltimore Catechism upon command can be seen this week when the Notre Dame Student Players perform the musicaVcomedy "Do Black Patent Leather Shoes Really Heflect Up?" (the title refers to nuns warning girls that such shoes allow over­sexed males to see up a girl's skirt). 
The play is based on the books The Last Catholic in America and Do Black Patent Leather Shoes Really Reflect Up? both by John Powers, following the life of Eddie Ryan (played by Joseph Clair) during his adolescent years while attending Catholic grammar school and high sehool. 
The viewer is treated to Eddie's scrapbook memories as he reflects on what his life was like as a teenager and his constant attempts to be someone he wasn't. Some of the scenes include the horrors of guilt associated with the Sacrament to Reconciliation, classroom antics, the awkwardness of the first freshman mixer, and a romance between Eddie and his overweight but lovable girlfriend, Becky (played by Wendy Eckelcamp). 
The plot does not revolve around any single character, but rather presents many different personalities and how their relationships grow and change. The play's director, Maggie McDonald, commented. "We're trying to downplay stereotypes ...._, such as the class clown or the typical shy kid." 
Although the play takes place in a Catholic school environ-ment and much of the humor is derived from this setting, Maggie McDonald said, "We want to bring out the better points of the play such as the experiences of growing up-love. asking life's big questions, and struggling to find an identity amongst constant peer pressure. We've even addf1d scenes from the book that were not in the play's original script in an attP.mpt to hopefully allow the viewer a better understanding of the characters' feelings. 
The Notre Dame Student Players have worked hard to present the play. Pre-production was plagued by problems such as a very late change in the lead role. One character had to be written out due to illness. Most of the aeting ensemble found themselves doing a fair share of teehnical work as well. Their director had only praise for them. however, saying. "We've .had many setbaeks. but the entire cast has really pulled together, and everyone's very proud of the show." 
"Do Black Patent Leather Shoes Really Heflect Up?" will run from October 11-13 beginning at 8:10 
p.m.. each night located in Washington Hall. Ticket prices are $3 for students and $5 for the general public. All tickets are available at the information desk in the LaFortune Student Center. 
NBC bumbles with 'The Fanelli Boys' 
·­
"Thn fanelli Boys" finds its origins in the what could be any typical sitcom. The series plays Wednnsdays at 8:30 p.m. on NBC and is based on the activities of a stereotypical Italian family. The matriarch of this family is Theresa Fanelli (Ann Guilbert). This fine, upstanding older woman has overseen the lives of her four 
sons, and considering their successful statuses at present. 
considers herself well of a peaceful rntirement to Miami. 
Anthony (Ned Eisenberg) is director of the family funeral parlor. Business is a success. (Andy Hirsch) is college and is fairing as well as the al ND undergrad. Frankie is Meloni) is engaged. and >om (Joe Pantoliano), well, >om is a hustler, but a hustler 
th a good heart. If this were the true situation with her sons, then Mamma Fanelli could definitely retire to Miami with an easy conscience and nice places to visit when she feels like returning home to Philadelphia, provided that Philadelphia has any nice places to which one wants to return. 
The truth of the matter is that television is just a little crazy, and the Fanelli boys are in desperate need of assistance. If they weren't, NBC would not really have much of a series. Anthony finds himself $25,000 in debt. Ronnie is failing out of college, and thus is still fairing as well as the typical Notre Dame undergrad. Frankie's engagement has been broken, and Dom, well, Dom is still a hustler. Needless to mention, Theresa Fanelli needs to enlist some aid which is provided in the shape of her brother and priest. Angelo (Richard Libertini). 
MARC JOHNSON Accent Writer 
With this background firmly in place, the specifics of this program can be analyzed for humorous content. The viewer can search, but I do not believe there will be any content available for analysis. 
The particular episode of this ednesday night focused on one major plot, that of the return of Dom's former wife. The minor plot of this episode concentrated on the success of a baseball team on which the Fanelli boys play. 
The opening joke is all important for the success of a sitcom, and programs like "Cheers" have mastered the concept of grabbing the audience's attention with classic lines. "The Fanelli Boys" fails as miserably as "Cheers" succeeds with this concept. 
As the program begins, Anthony is speaking with his brother Frankie about an upcoming date. He advises a better tie and provides one himself. "I borrowed this from Mr. Baducci," Anthony said. "Hey, isn't that the guy from viewing room one?"questions Frankie. If that did not strike you as particularly humorous, you will probably find yourself with the majority of viewers. 
"The Fanelli Boys" slowly deteriorated as the two plots resolved their complications. Dom's ex-wife returns asking for alimony. She ends up falling for Anthony but finally elopes with a limo driver. The baseball team makes it to the league championship by defeating a rival funeral parlor, and in the final game Angelo is called into duty and makes the game­saving catch. This catch by no means compares with that of Les Nessman's on "WKHP," and the catch incites no emotion. 
"The Fanelli Boys" bumbles through its twenty-two minutes of air playing upon jokes as old as the concept of the sitcom itself. The whole idea of basing a show upon ethnic jokes is not necessarily offensive; it just is not humorous. If the readers of this article actually do make an effort to watch "The Fanelli Boys" despite sound advice, they should be prepared for the exploitation of other obvious lines of humor. A funeral parlor in the basement? The possibilities for ridiculous jokes are endless in this situation alone. 
In the infinitely wise words of Dom, "Blood is thicker than water, and no one is thicker than me." Dom is definitely thick if he believes anyone will watch the "Fanelli Boys."

"Forget the national championship," Holtz continued. "Forget the other things. We've got some things that we've got to answer for ourselves right now. We made a commitment to be the very best we can possibly be. We made a commitment to play every single football game to the best of our abilities, and that is what we are going to do." 
And that is something another week is not going to change. 
It runs iil the family. Holtz expected the worst when he consulted Head Trainer Jim Russ following last week's Stanford game.

Ignorance of the law doesn't 
count when the law is printed 
on the ticket. 
If anything, Cunningham could probably expect an increase in confiscated tickets with Miami playing in Notre Dame Stadium next weekend and then Penn State coming in November. 
Cunningham is caught with his hands tied this season. A computer check matching the tickets with the original purchasers would be lengthy and costly. But the results of that check would help pinpoint the problem, especially if the same people sell their tickets each game. 
Another possibility -and a good one at that -would mean a return to the old system of issuing all the tickets in one book. It would mean more re­sponsibility for the students, but it would cut down significantly on the number of scalped tickets.

"I thought we would have something like 50 injuries after that game," said Holtz. "We have so many people banged up who are trying to hide it from the trainers. That tells you something about this team." 
The only players expected to miss Saturday's Air Force game are tailback Tony Brooks (swollen ankle) and his brother, cornerback Reggie Brooks (injured shoulder)." 
Down and out. Former Irish inside linebacker Ned Bolcar, a fifth-round draft choice of the Seattle Seahawks, tore cartilage in his knee last Sunday in a game against the New England Patriots. He will be out for the season. 
For now, Cunningham can 
only appeal to the morals of the student body. And probably count the confiscated tickets again next Monday morning.

Irish clubs ready for weekend 
Last weekend was the Weekend of Champions. This weekend, Irish club sports will face similar obstacles. The clubs' team members hope that they will fare better than their varsity counterparts.

The Notre Dame Rowing Club will compete this weekend at the Head of the Elk, which will run through Elkhart on the St. Joseph's River. 
Over 1200 athletes from across the country will compete in the race, a 3.85­mile upstream struggle. 
Last year, the Notre Dame varsity crew won all but two races at the Head of the Elk. Club President Barton Richards is confident that this year's team will do as well. 
"How are we planning on doing? We're going to win," said Richards. 
Notre Dame will send over 110 boaters to the event. The crew will compete in seven different events.

Last weekend, a Notre Dame success story could be found in Chicago, where the Rugby Club played the Chicago Area Rugby Football 
An Open~~ to the 
Rolando de Aguiar Club Corner 
Union Tournament. The Irish played in the eight-team college division, and left the tournament champions outscoring opponents by a combined score of 114-13 in capturing the crown. 
Northern Illinois provided the most competition for the Irish squad, as they held Notre Dame to a 24-4 win in the semifinal. Notre Dame earlier beat the University of Chicago 42-3. Even more impressive for the Irish offense is that both of these games were played with 30-minute halves, rather than the conventional 40-minute periods. 
The final game of the tourne, went the duration. Northwestern likely wishes it had been ruled a TKO, as the Irish bloodied the Huskies in a 48-6 win. 
Coach Art Maelander's troops have suffered losses only to Bowling Green and Michigan. 
The Irish will face Kalamazoo this weekend at Stepan Field. This team will be a tough opponent for Notre Dame.

Notre Dame's Boxing Club will hold an organizational meeting at 9:00 tonight in Room 127 of Nieuwland Science Hall. 
Beginning after fall break, the club will hold novice training, which will continue until Thanksgiving. Training will cover boxing basics, as well as conditioning. 
The major function of the Boxing Club is the Bengal Bouts. The money raised from this tournament goes to the Bengal Missions of Holy Cross. In past years, the club has raised from $12,000­$20,000 for the Bangladeshi missions.

Men's soccer falls to Butler in Overtime; LaVigne TKO'd 
By KEN TYSIAC Associate Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame men's soccer team failed to score a goal for the sixth time in seven games Tuesday night in a 2-0 overtime loss at Butler. 
Although the Irish held their opponents scoreless in regula­tion, the Bulldogs broke the ice 
3:10 into the overtime when Jeff Kurtz blasted a shot past Notre Dame goalie Peter Gulli off an indirect kick outside the penalty box. Butler's Talor Kumler added an insurance goal late in the overtime. 
Notre Dame had numerous opportunities to score in regu­lation. 
"The (Butler) defenders probably cleared five or six goals off the goal line," said senior Irish co-captain Paul LaVigne. "If you could have seen how many times our for­wards raised their arms in the air thinking they had a goal, only to see the ball cleared away, you wouldn't have be­lieved it." 
The overtime loss broke a three-game Notre Dame un­beaten streak and dropped the Irish to 3-8-3 on the season. It also overshadowed another solid defensive performance for coach Mike Berticelli's squad. For the fourth straight game, the Irish did not allow a goal in regulation. But the Notre Dame forwards couldn't convert. 
"The best you can do if you don't score a goal is tie," LaVigne said. "It's getting ridiculous. It's true that we haven't allowed goals in regula­tion the past four games, and that's big for (goalkeeper) Peter Gulli, but more than anything, we come away realizing that we didn't score a goal again. 
"We're doing everything we can out there, but we still couldn't score a goal to save our lives. You can sense the ur­gency to score a goal when you're out there on the field. Maybe we are trying too hard, but it definitely is constantly on our minds out there." 
The Irish will take a couple of days off to heal their wounds after playing three games in five days. Their next scheduled match is on Oct. 19 against Xavier at Krause Stadium. 
"We can use some time off," said LaVigne, who was knocked unconscious for a couple of minutes against Butler but went back into the game. "We have played three overtime games in the past eight days, and let me tell you, those games take their toll."

Women's soccer beats Milw. 
Overcome cold and Panthers to raise record to 1 0-3-1 
By DANIEL TALBOT Sports Writer 
After being shutout by Creighton last weekend, the women's soccer team, led by freshman sensation Alison Lester, who had two goals, re­turned with a shutout of their own, defeating the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee 3-0 last night at Krause Stadium. 
"We played very well tonight," said first-year coach Chris Petrucelli. "It is an important win. Any shutout is important." 
The shutout was accom­plished by a stringent Irish de­fense that held Wisconsin ­Milwaukee to only seven shots on goal. Goalkeeper Michelle Lodyga had four saves in recording her seventh shutout of the season. 
There may have been some worry about the defense due to the absence of fullback Shannon Jenkins, but with some adept 
moves by the coach the Irish were able to avoid defensive gaps. 
"We put Stephanie Porter in back for defense and moved Mimi Suba up to midfield, which worked out fine" said Petrucelli. 
The first and winning goal was scored by midfielder Marianne Giolitto at 11:23 of the first half. The goal gives her 19 points for the season, good enough for second on the team in that category. 
After the shutout this week­end, Petrucelli was worried about another offensive lapse last night, but hoped for an early spark. 
"Because we started off with the wind I felt it was important that we score a couple of goals in the first half, and we were able to accomplished that," stated Petrucelli. 
The incessant attacking of Lester and fellow forward Susie Zilvitis helped the Irish record 15 shots on goal, more than 
twice Wisconsin-Milwaukee's total. The second Irish goal came at 
21:09 of the first half, as Lester scored on an assist from Margaret Jarc. The combination of Jarc-to-Lester also provided the third goal on an indirect kick at 70:36. 
The two goals by Lester give her 10 for the season and 24 points, which leads the team. 
"Alison Lester took over the game," commended Petrucelli. " Her ability to work with team­mates and to finish plays is outstanding. I think she is the best freshman in the region." 
Coach Petrucelli heaped praise for the work of all the freshmen players, seven of whom start. 
'Tm very pleased with our freshmen," he said. "I don't feel our freshmen are freshmen anymore with the experience they've had. I'm not disap­pointed with any of them." 

Belles volleyball prepared for match up with Concordia 
By CHRIS BACON Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
After a few days break from their grinding road schedule, the Saint Mary's Volleyball team resumes action tonight as the 
face  visiting  Concordia  
University.  
After  facing  Concordia  

tonight, the Belles will travel on Friday to face Nazareth College whom they beat earlier this season. On Saturday, they will be back at home to meet 11th­to play with confidence and consistency. 
"I think our performance has been strong, but inconsistent," said senior co-captain Michelle Sibilsky. " We are right there and we have the talent. We just need to get the consistency back into our game." 
Previous to last weekend's tournament, the Belles led the NCAA Division III in kills per game (15.3) and in assists per game (12.4). They were ranked centages (.250) and were third in service aces, averaging 3. 70 per game. 
Despite these impressive of­fensive numbers, the Belles have been plagued with a lack­luster performance on defense. 
"We're playing tentatively, waiting for the other team to set the tempo," coach Medley added. " We're allowing teams to get a string of four or five points on us in a row. We have

The Belles, looking to improve their 6-10 record after coming off of a four game loss last weekend at the University of Wisconsin Whitewater Tournament, have mixed emo­tions about tonight's game. 
"We've never played them and I've never seen them play, so I · don't know what to expect," said Belles head coach Sue Medley. "Physically, we're well prepared to play. We just need

Once again the Notre Dame baseball team proved that it is a team to be reckoned with na­tionally as it beat perennial powerhouse Wichita State last week. 
So one might think that with the Air Force Falcons coming to town this weekend for games Thursday at 7:30 and Friday at 8:30, the Irish could breath a sigh of relief. 
Guess again. 
The Irish faced the Falcons twice in last spring's Irish Baseball Classic in the Seattle Kingdome. Air Force pushed the Irish to the limit as the Notre won two one-run games, 4-3 and 6-5. In 6-5 win, Frank Jacobs blasted an 11th inning homer.

"They have a great de­fensive club and they run the bases well. They're used to playing teams of our calibre. They're a hungry team." 

Junior Steve Carson is the Academy's top returning player. As a first baseman he hit .346 and as pitcher was 7-3 with a 
5.12 ERA. Junior outfielder Mike Remualdo returns a .345 average. Senior Mike Wollet {4­0, 4.72) is the other top pitcher for the Falcons. 
Jacobs will most likely figure a great deal into the fortunes of the Irish this weekend. In last weekend's three game set with the Shockers, he went 3 for 7 with three REI's, a homer and a triple. 
"I was more impressed with Jacobs the second night," said Murphy. "They didn't give him anything to hit. He kept in his game, though, kept his focus and didn't go after any bad pitches. Any good power hitter is going to take his walks." 
Although Jacobs is renowned for his offense, his defensive play will be important to the Irish fortunes not only this 
-weekend, but the entire season. "For us to be successful we have to have Jacobs in left field," said Murphy. "He's come a long way since last year," commented outfield coach John Flanagan. "We kind of threw him out there at the end of last year because we needed another stick in the lineup. He's worked hard. He knows that if he wants to play pro ball it will give him more versatility." One might think that someone as big as Jacobs (6'5", 
240) wouldn't be able to move very well, but that's not the case. 
"He's got his speed back," 
said Flanagan, referring to the ankle injury that hampered Jacobs most of last year. "He's got great speed. He just needs repetitions in seeing the ball off the bat." 
Jacobs may see a lot of time at DH because of sophomore Edwin Hartwell. Hartwell started the second game of last Thursday's doubleheader and went 2 for 4 with 2 REI's. 
"Edwin Hartwell has proven he's ready to play at this level," said Murphy. 
Juniors Craig Counsell and Cory Mee, although not big­name players, continue to be vi­tal cogs in the Irish machine. 
"Counsell could play for any­one, anywhere," said Murphy. "He knows the game in and out. His baseball knowledge is ex­ceptional. That's why he started as a freshman." 
Mee, on the other hand will continue to play second base, where he's started since the middle of freshman year, as well as do some catching for the Irish. 
"Cory's responded very well to being behind the plate," said Murphy. "Whether he's playing or not, he's a starter. He's steady, steady steady." 
Dave Sinnes will get the start Thursday while freshman Tom Price will take the hill for Friday's game. In his first big game as a college pitcher, Price lasted 3 1/3 innings giving up four hits and two earned runs. He struck out three and walked one. 
"Price is going to be an out­standing college pitcher," commented Murphy. "He needs to learn not to overthrow his fastball. He's better off throw­ing it 90%, and doing some­thing with it." 
better effort. He beat Boston 3­1 Wednesday and won for the eighth straight time in head-to­head matchups with Clemens. 
In the ultimate sign of Boston's failure and frustration, Clemens was ejected in the second inning for arguing balls and strikes with umpire Terry Cooney, triggering a wild scene that left water coolers, players and coaches strewn across the field. 
Especially against the take­advantage A's, and it showed when Mike Gallego met Tom Bolton with a two-run double that sent Oakland to its 1Oth straight victory in the postseason.
