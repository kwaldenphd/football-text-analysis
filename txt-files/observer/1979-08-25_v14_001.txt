Over last year

''Student Government'' is one term which can be used in reference to two different or­ganizations. Broadly speaking, "Student Government" defines four branches known as Student Government, Student Union, Hall President's Council, and Judicial Council. Narrowly speaking, "Student Govern­ment" is the branch whose political purpose is to represent the student body to the administration.

Most of th~ perennial prob­ems concernmg on-campus housing were resolved through action taken last spring, accord­in_g to Edmund Price, direc::or ofHousing. As far back as 1924 [Notre Dame Magazine May 
1971] problems with over­crowding have existed, plagu­ing both upper classmen and incoming freshmen alike. 
The housing office reportedly worked overtime last year in order to solve the space prob­
.lem. Price believes that the men's situation solved itself with the movement of so many of the class of 1980 off campus. This off campus movement came last spring in response to the rumor of a proposed lottery forcing would be seniors off campus to make room for incoming freshmen. 
The situation in Holy Cross Hall has improved over last year; previously overcrowded areas have been relieved of their extra occupants, and new housing has been created in the basement. Approximately 20 spaces and one R.A. have been added to the capacity of the 

·hall. · 
The permanent overcrowding in Dillon, Alumni, and Morris­sey has yet to be alleviated, however. This is not new to any of the halls: this problem has existed in previous years.

Price pointed out several developments in male on cam­pus housing. No freshmen are living in temporary housing in either Grace or Planner study­lounges. Due to both the cancellations of freshmen and the attrition of male upper classmen, male students on the housing waiting list have been permitted to move on campus.

Approximately 1560 students will board at Saint Mary's College this year, including 457 incoming freshmen According to Minnie Owens, director of Housing, the housing situation is 'OK' and all students will be ''settled comfortably.'' While Saint Mary's is experiencing a minor housing problem, there is no housing "crunch," ac­cording to Owens, yet the college faces two immediate problems: an overwhelming number of off-campus students are requesting roomsoffcampus and some freshmen must live in temporary make-shift rooms. 
Last year 140 students lived off campus. This year the Housing Department forsees only a handful boarding off campus. 
''Students are satisfied with the Saint Mary's campus and the opportunities that tt has to offer,'' says Owens. • 
Last spring the administra­tion discussed the possibility of buying a large family house in South Bend and moving it onto the college grounds, "Renova­tions would have been geared 
to offer the Saint Mary's stud­
ent an ideal housing arrange­
ment," Owens said. Yet, so 
far, no positive action has been 
taken. 

According to the Housing Department, the temporary freshman housing problem ex­ists in order to proved more "comfortable living arran~e­ments. '' Instead of increasmg the number of students per room, some freshmen will be housed temporarilty in Mc­Candless Hall study lounges. 
Although fall enrollment has slightly decreased, Saint Mary's must face the fact that there is indeed a minor housing shortage, according to Owens. 
Besides .encountering their new environment, Saint Mary's freshmen must also confront ''the system.'' The system consists of two main policies: curfew and male visitation proc­cedures. . 
Curfew exists only for first semester freshmen and is de­signed to help the new student adjust to her surroundings. Freshmen must sign out after 6 
p.m. and must sign in by midnight on weekdays and by 2 
a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. fhe male-vis11a1 ion pn..ce­

and to implement them. Hope­fully, what the SG has is "influence." When the admin­istration is making a decision, 

Three groups govern SMC students

Pia Trigiani, Saint Mary's student body president, says, "One main concern of student.._ body president should be to repr~s~nt st~den~~ to the faculty and admtntstratton. 
"Isee my role as being one of a motivator, inspirer, and advisor, not necessarily an implementory of programs,' 'Trigiani said. 
Vice-President for Academic Affairs Mary Beth Dornbach is responsible for all areas pertaining to students and academic life. "I find this position to be the student's vehicle of

Committee Against Racism hopes to stop KKK ~arch 
MUNCIE, Ind. (AP) -An organization calling itself the Committee Against Racism says it will try to stop a Ku Klux Klan march today in this city known as "Middletown, U.S.A." The KKK obtained a parade permit for the six-block march through Muncie's downtown, starting at 2 
p.m. EST. The Committee Ag~inst Racism, a sl?lal~ Gary group with ties to the Progresstve La~or Paft¥, d~stnbuted leaflets Thursday and Friday announcmg that tt will oppose the Klan march. The leaflets declared, "We should not be afraid to use violence against the Klan; allowing them to grow will lead to much greater violence and harm. · 
Gas station operators call price estimates worthless 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Spokesmen for gas station operators say the Energy Department's new listmgs of "estunated" gasoline ceiling pr1ces are worthless and misleading and should be scra{>ped. The department has admitted the price ceiling figures tt released Monday were inaccurate and dated back to Aug. 6-prompting mistaken complaints by motorists and a wave ofoutrage from dealers. An updated list released Thursday did nothing to lessen the dealers' ire. In issuing a revised list Thursday, the Energy Department warned that its price estimates for eight major brands in 20 cities mi~ht be off by 10 cents or more per gallon and do not tell motonsts how much any station can legally charge.

As part ot SG 
SU stands as self-regulating 

Robbie Moore StaffReporter 

The Notre Dame Student Union is a self-regulating body, one of the four brances of Student Government subject to approval of the Board of CommissiOners. Its basic function is ''to make life happer'' for the students, accordmg to Tom Hamel, this year's SU director. 
For starters, the Cultural Arts Commission,(CAC) pro­vides and organizes runctlons which appeal to the student's finer tastes. Three annual events are the Sophomore Lit­erary Festival, the Collegiate Jazz Festival, and the Midwest Blues Festival. The CAC also takes charge of the Senior Arts Festival and the Student Play­ers, a theater group. 
The Social Commission heads the traditional Welcome Week. In addition, it operates The Nazz, a student coffee house in the rathskellar of LaFortune. After midnight, die rathskellar is known as Darby's Place, a late-night spot to grab a cup of coffee, doughnut, an~ the com­panionship of "Darby," the cockerspaniel. 
The Services Commission will be doing things a little differently this year. In early September, they will run Step­an Mall, where students can purchase rugs, unpainted furn­Iture, plants, etc. Also in the near future is the annual book exchan~e, in addition to many other s1milar services. 
The Concert Commission is busy planning the four concerts they will be sponsoring this semester. In the making are arrangements for the appear­ance of the well-known rock group, Styx. 
The Academic Commission sponosors speakers and pro-

Hoitnan's door o·pens for thirtieth year 
by Michael Onufrak Staf!Reporter 

Mrs. Marie Meilner has been Freshman Year of Studies Dean Emil T. Hofman's secretary for the past four years. In that time according to Dean Hofman, it is ''far easier for the average freshman to now pass through my office door than it is for a faculty member or administra­tor.'' This is not to say Hofman is inaccessible to professors and counselers; it only\. emphasizes his personal commitment to each and every'freshman who enters Notre Dame. 
~ Hofman will have over 900 Freshman science and engin­eering majors in his two chem­istry classes this year. He estimates that, through Fresh­man Year social activities, he will come to know approximate-· ly 700 Freshmen on a personal basis. 
Hofman admits that ''it is unusual for a dean to take such a personal interest in his charges.'' 
"Usually a dean is primarily concerned with faculty and programs. They are usually too busy to meet the students.'' To insure tht he will never be ''too

busy,'' in the next five months Hofman will spend all but a few hours teaching, counseling, en­tertaining and eventually be­friendin~ this year's freshman class. 'My job is to put the freshmen at ease. By doing so, they can best be guided toward our goals of providing them with a sound, general education and a chance to sample as many different areas as they like." 
Hofman is quick to point out that Notre Dame is one ofonly a few colleges which groups freshmen mto a single college. Most schools immediately enroll their freshmen into major programs in different colleges. ''Some freshmen know what they want, but most don't. Our pro~ram allows them the oppor­tunity to change or make-up their minds while avoiding administrative hassles that occur when one switches a major or a college.'' 

He contendsthat this program has worked well in the past and should be equally effective for 
this year's class·.  
' 'On paper this looks  like  a  
great  class,  though  I  can't  

truthfully say that one class is better than another.' ' 
Hofman will be celebrating his thirtieth anniversary in edu­cation in the next few months. He estimates that in that time he has taught approximately 25,000 students. Mrs. Meilner' s job will be to insure that this year's group will have the same advantage of an open door to Emil Hofman as those who have preceded them. 
Gift pushes ND past goal 
The largest gift ever received 
from a living person--$7 mill­
ion--has put the University of 

Notre Dame's development campaign of $130 million over . its goal more than two years 
ahead of schedule. 
In announcing that a total of 
$130.3 million in gifts and 
commitments has been receiv­
ed since the five-year drive 
opened in April, 1977, Notre 
Dame's president, Fr. 
Theodore M. Hesburgh, credit­
ed a $7 million gift from an 
anonymous donor with taking 
the effort over the top. The gift, Father Hesburgh said, will build the University's 23rd undergraduate residence hall, enabling it to add 500 women and expand the undergraduate student body from 6,800 to 7 ,300. The University now has 1,585 women undergraduates. 
While the goal has been reached, James W. Frick, vice president for Public Relations and Development, emyhasized that the campaign wil contin­ue. ' 'I..;flation has eroded our ability to meet our institutional ne~ds with the original cost 

estimates. We now have to raise more money to accomplish the same purposes. '' 
The Campaign for Notre Dame grew out of the 1973 report of a Committee on University Priorities, which provided a blueprint for the academic development of Notre Dame. The major thrust of the campaign was to increase Notre Dame's endownment, which currently stands at $127 
million, in order to protect the quality of academic programs from the adverse effects of inflation. As an example, the program set out to fund 40 endowed chairs in order to underwrite permanently key full professorships across the University. Twenty-six of these 
professorships have been des­tgnated, at $800,000 each. Overall, about three-fourths of the $92 million goal for endow­ment has been reached.

Should you happen to get caught breaking parietals, you may choose to have your case heard by your rector with appeals to be heard by the Dean of Students, or to be heard by the judicial board in your hall, with appeals going to the rector. In especially serious cases, hall authorities or the Dean of Students may treat violations as though they were violations ofUniversity rules or regulations instead of hall in­fractions. 
Notre Dame's rules concern­ing alcohol are consistent with the laws of Indiana, which means the legal drinking age is 21. Students are allowed to drink in their moms but may not have kegs on campus. Drinking in common rooms is also prohibited. The possession or consumption of alchoholic beverages is not allowed on t~e grounds of the campus or m nonresidential buildings with­out special permission from the De am of Students. 
Although these are Upiver­sity rules, each hall has its own guidelines for drinking and patties. The rector and hall staff can tell you your dorm's drinking policies.

We began together by the IIVel••••• 
The history of Notre Dame begins almost 1~0 years ago when Fr. Stephen Theodore Badin established a mission on the present University grounds for a tribe of the Pottawatomi Indians. It was located near a community which came to be known as South Bend, but which had also been called Big St. Joseph Srarion, St. Joseph's and South Hold. 
South Bend, then a young riverside 
st·ttlement, was a prime site for milling and lumber industries which drew many workers to the area. The dt'Vt"lopment of Notre Dame ,Parallel­ed rhe growth in populatton and mdustry tn rhe neighboring towns. 
In 1832 Badin purchased 524 acres of land surroundmg St. Joseph's and St. Mary's lakes where he built an orphanage and a log chapel. The orphanage was closed down, but the 
log chapel remained, serving the area as a mission station. When Badin left Indiana in 1835 for another assign­ment, he deeded the property to the diocese of Vincennes. , The bishop of Indiana, hoJ;>ing to h· ·gin a program of education in 
Vincenn('s, requested teaching brothers from the Congregation of the Holy Cross in LeMans, France. Congregation Superior Basil Moreau responded in 1842 by sending six 


brothers to help educate the Catholic youth of South Bend and the emerg­mg Mishawaka communities. The brothers wereunderthe direction of a young priest named Edward Frederick Sorin who founded the university in that same year. The bishop of Indiana had promised to give Sorin the property Badin deeded to Vincennes 1f the energetic Frenchman could build a college on the site within two rears, and continue the instruction o brothers to 
teach in diocesean schools. 

In 1844 the University of Notre Dame du Lac, although it consisted of only a few buildings, 25 srudents and a small faculty of priests, brothers and sisters, was granted a charter by the Indiana legislature. 
During the next 150 years the University operated a Manual Labor school (1844), a "prep" school, a Minim department for elementary students, a department for the Deaf and Dumb (1860s), and a law school (1869). The University also offered programs in graduate and under­graduate studtes, and in military training during the first and second world wars and summer sessions beginning in 1918. 
The University continued to grow as the surrounding community pros­pered, relying on the neighboring town for students and for support, despite continuous financial difficul­ties and an outbreak of cholera in 1854. 
·In 1852 the Studebaker brothers arrived in the South Bend area and established what was to become an internationally famous motor com­pany, drawing thousands of new residents to the South Bend area, and hundreds of students to Notre Dame. 
When the Studebaker plant closed 
in the 1960s, Notre Dame and Bendix 
became the major employers in the 
area. In recent years South Bend and 
Mishawaka have engaged in impres­
sive programs to revive the economy 
of the area and rennovate residential 
areas. The new University Park Mall 
and the 100 Center in Mishawaka and

Okay. you arrived at N.D. some­time in recent memorable history, and someone probably showed you around school: maybe an "official" tour guide. But, when you think about 1t. you know there are things about ~otre I?ame that aren't being sa1d. "'ou don t blame them, but you want to know. For this reason we bring you: '

Translation: Okay, so it looks like a cross between a church and a grade school. Does it help to hear the rumor 
that the donor· s arcnttect son was known principally for his elementary school designs? Beware the class­room doors, for they open into the hallway and have destroyed many noses and toppled armfuls of books.

Also one of the best poster-info centers around--read the walls and stairwells. Please note the infamous mechanically regulated classroom lights,. often shutting off at inoppor­tune umes. Guide: We've now moved to the Memorial Library, which is the largest college library in the world. There are twelve floors ofbook stacks, ten of those constituting the research library, one for general collegiate reading and another for general reference and periodicals. The base­ment is sectioned ihto office space for faculty, while the fourteenth and uppermost floor is used exclusively for special events and to entenain visito~s. Stud~nts ma.y wish to peruse the stx spectalty ltbraries located at ..... Translation: The largest library, the largest volume, but not the most 

voluminous (with regard to number of books). It is somewhat deficient in number of books, but they do try. You can use Saint Mary's and South Bend's libraries for some help can be found there. Still, this is a b1g study center, which can turn into a big get-together-with-friends center. Time easily dilate!: relativistically-­
speeds up while you· re having a good ume. Also, depending on how intui· rive you are, there may be felt a real air of tension and anxiety, but more so around finals time. Take the opportunity to use the A V Library on the second floor--there are some good albums there and a few unusual recordings such as Metaphysics and some tracks of Monty Python.

are all promising indicators of new prospenty for the area. In South Bend neighborhood organizations and cooperative movements are not uncommon, and the area has served as a test site for various national ~eighborhood and residence renova­
tion programs. 
Notre Dame has gone through many changes as well. It has gone from an enrollment of 500 in 1869 to 8,612 from every state and 69 countries today. Tuition has risen from $300 to $4,130 and acreage has increased from 542 to 1,250 m the past 110 years. 
Notre Dame's growth is directly linked to the surrounding community and the history of our community cannot properly be considereds sep­arate from that of our neighboring towns. In the coming weeks fresh­men will hear a continuous stream of derogatory comments about South Bend, Mishawaka, Indiana, the United States, our Universe, our state of consciousness ... these in­sights will be offered by upperclass­men for whom cynism is fashionable and supposedly indicative of experi­ence broad enough to make sweeping j~dgements and vicious condemna­tions. 
This statement may alienate any 
friend I may have at N.D. on the 
grounds of extreme mental abbera­
tion, but I like South Bend, and what 
is more, in general I find Indiana a 
source of enriching experiences and 
entertainment. I hope that freshmen 
will discover for themselves thatthere 
is more to the land beyond our 
borders than "student b~rs." I 
wouldn't want you to take my word 
for granted any more than I would 
want you to listen to the complaints of 
those who have never ventured 
beyond the bars. Find out for 
yourselves. 
Granted, it will be a challenge, and 
in these Features pages I hope to be 
of some assistance, but an afternoon 
in an Amish community, fishing, 
skiing or discovering a new out-of-the 
way restaurant is well worth the time, 
the bus fare and missing a 1 p.m. to 
midnight "Happy Hour."

Hunter, frosh gridders among nation's best 
by Paul Mullaney Assistant Sports Editor 
The role of the freshman in the collegiate football ranks has become increasingly magnified since the first-year eligibility rule took effect m 1972. 
Perhaps the best example of the rookie role was seen this past January, when Notre Dame freshman were respon­sible for a blocked punt, returning that punt for a touch­down, and making a game­saving fourth-and-inches tackle.. : all of which helped the Irish score the last 23 pomts in a 35-34 Cotton Bowl win over Houston. 
And the growing trend should continue at Notre Dame this year. After all, most collegiate grid experts tabbed Notre Dame as having one of the top recruiting years in the country-­better than everyone, in fact, except Southern Cal. 
At the top on this year's freshman list is split end Tony Hunter, every bit of 6-5, 210 pounds. A consensus prep All-American from Cincinnati's Moeller High School, Hunter comes from the same high school as irish teammates Jayra"'t>. Tim Koegel na....... r:on­deni, Bob Crabfe, and Harry

with all these familiar faces,'' 
chuckled Hunter at last week's 
Picture Day festivities. ''In 
fact, Tim Koegel is a big part of 
my coming to Notre Dame."

1978, Hunter is also close to

summer," Hunter said. "He 
helped me learn a lot of the 
patterns. That kind of 
surprised me a little, since I'll be competing against him.'' 
The competition at Notre Dame will be a new twist for Hunter, and he realizes that. 
"It's an adjustment that I'll have to make. But I have confidence m myself. . How much I play depends on how I adjust to the system.'' 
Despite the raving reports on Hunter, who was also a basket­ball All-American, Notre Dame head coach Dan Devine intends to let him prove himself on the field, and not in the press clippings.· 
"I've seen other freshmen who have looked just as good,'' offered the low-key Irish mentor. "He's still going to have to beat out Condeni and the others. 
"It's possible that this entire freshman class is better than we thought they were, though. Some of them are getting so anxious that they're hyper.'' 
Other freshmen to keep an eye on are defensive backs Rod Bone and Dave Duerson. 
Bone accumulated a perfect 
4.0 grade point average at Mayfield High School in Las Cruces, New Mexico. The engineering hopeful lettered three rimes each in football, basketball, and track, and was named to the All-American grid squad in Scholastic Coach. 
Duerson, also a Scholastic Coach prep All-American selection, was tabbed the Most Valuable Player in this summer's Indiana North-South all-star game. A graduate of Muncie (Ind.) Northside High School, Duerson punted and returned kicks in addition to playing offensive and defen­sive back for the same school that produced former Irish cornerback Luther Bradley. 
Devine admitted that "we may

Irish of 79~80 hope to follow tradition 


Notre Dame. The name means many things to many people. But 
when you talk about sports it means one thing--winmng. 
Winning is a tradition at Notre Dame. It began with Rockne and 
the Gipper. It continued under Leahy and Parseghian, and the 
tradition lives on today. Although they have faltered at times, the 
Irish usually come out on top. "Old Notre Dame will win over all," 
the song says, and it's called the Victory March for obvious 
reasons. 

The tradition. began with football, but over the years it has 
extended to the other varsity sports on campus, and even the 
various club sports are proud to carry the name Notre Dame. . 
All this may sound like a lot of sentimental slop to someone ,.ust 
being introduced to Notre Dame sports, but that's what this p ace 
can do to you after a few years. This place ha~ a way of making 
some of us into Notre Dame nuts, and I confess that I'm one of 
them. 

As we look ahead to the upcoming year, it arpears that several 
teams are prepared to make the 1979-80 schoo year a memorable 
one for Irish sports fans. 

Faci~g on~ of the toughest schedul~s in the nation, the football team ts lookmg forward to a challengmg year. Although they only return ten starters from last year's squad, All-American candidates Vagas Ferguson, Dave Waymer, Tim Huffman, and Tim Foley provide a solid nucleus that Head Coach Dan Devine, entering his fifth year at ND, hopes to build around. 
If the Irish gridders get off to a fast start againsr Michigan'" Purdue and Michigan State, there is no telling how high they can go. It should be an interesting season. 
Digger Phelps and the Irish netmen are ready to tip off another banner year, as they only lose two players from last year's squad, which traveled to the finals of the Mideast Regiona~ of the NCAA basketball tourney. 
Kelly Tripucka and Rich Branning stand .)Ut on r:his team, although everyone will get a chance to contribute with Phelps' shuttle system. Irish fans are hoping that freshman Tim Andree can help till in the gap left at center wah the loss of Bruce Flowers and Bill Laimbeer to graduation. 
The hockey team was one of the pleasant surprises of last year, as a young team started out very strong and was even ranked number

last year's roster, and should be one of the favontes to take the title in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association, one of the top conferences in the nation. Leading scorers Dave Poulin and-Greg 
Meredith and last year's goalie sensation Dave Laurion are just a few of the players who should shine this year. 
The soccer program has grown greatly in the past few years under Head Coach Rich Hunter, as the Insh just mtssed an NCAA tournament bid in only their second varsity season a year ago. Hunter has toughened up the schedule, with contests agamst Indiana. last year's NCAA runner-up, highly regarded Loyola College of Baltimore, and a challenging eastern trip during the fall break. Leading scorer Kevin Lovejoy, goaltender Brian Cullather, midfielder Jim Sabitus, and several other top players return this season, plus a strong crop of freshmen recrui~. 
Fencing has been the most successful sport at Notre Dame the past three seasons, as the Irish swordsmen took national championships in 1977 and 1978 and finished second in the NCAA tourney last spring. Andy Bonk, last year's NCAA foil champion, returns to lead Mtchael DeCicco's squad, and Ola Harstrom, one of the top epeeists from Sweden, has been accepted at Notre Dame and may enroll for the second semester. 
The Insh tennis team posted 20 wins last season, only the third team in Notre Dame history to n:cord that many victories, and wirh five of the top six netters rerurr.ing this year, Head Coach Tom Fallon is looking for an even better year next spring.

He was also fined $500. The San Juan district judge agreed to postpone implementing the sentence until next Monday.
