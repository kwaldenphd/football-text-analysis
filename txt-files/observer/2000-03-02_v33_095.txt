To say that the past week has been a rough one would be an understatement for Notre Dame sophomore Conor Murphy. 
Murphy was diagnosed with leukemia last Friday. After his diagnosis, he returned home from Washington, D.C., where he has been studying, to Cleveland, Ohio, where he will begin 
chemotherapy today at University Hospital. 
Murphy's doctors have narrowed his condition to one of two types of leukemia: acute myeloid and acute lym­phocytic. 
"Since [his diagnosis], we've all been praying for him," said sophomore Steve Napleton, a close friend of Murphy. "He's in good spirits. I don't think there's any doubt in his mind that he's going to overcome this." 
Most people who know Murphy 

describe him as ambitious, someone who works hard and plays hard. A gov­ernment major, he is the only sopho­more to be spending in the semester in Washington, D.C. 
"He's one of those people who always gives everything his all," said Napleton. "He's very involved in various organiza­tions. He takes studying seriously, but also takes spending time with friends and having a good time seriously as

Gramick challenges Vatican rules 
By ERIN PIROUTEK 
Assistant News Editor 
Sister Jeannine Gramick hopes that the Vatican's decision to limit her ministry to gays and lesbians will invoke dialogue about areas of disagreement within the Church. Her Thursday lecture "What if Catholics Disagree" explained her points of disagreement with the Vatican and encouraged discussion first in small groups then by the entire audience. 
In July 1999, The Vatican Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith. a body to safeguard church teaching, ordered Gramick and rather Robert Nugent to permanently end their pas­toral work to gays and lesbians and their parents. 
This specifically forbids activities such as leading retreats and workshops; how­ever. they are still free to speak and write. 
"It's been a limiting of my ministry, not a silencing," said Gramick. 
The seeds of Gramick's ministry devel­oped in 1969 at the University of Pennsylvania where Gramick was pursu­ing her masters. 
"I became very good friends with a young man who was gay," said Gramick. The man had abandoned a religious community because he felt that being gay was incompatible with being reli­gious. 
"He said the Catholic Church didn't want him," said Gramick. She explained that as a sister, she wanted to show him that the Catholic Church did indeed want him. 
Her order assigned her to gay and les­bian ministry. Gramick was involved in counseling, educational programs, work­shops and retreats.

that the student body is behind us as president and vice presi­dent," she added. 
Before tho envelope was opened by current student body vice president Michael Palumbo, there was debate on the rele­vance of seeing the null and void results. Because numbers had been leaked last week, senators did not want students to assume that senate members knew the results and were simply hiding the totals. 
"I don't want this issue hang­ing over our head," said Phil Dittmar, Fisher Hall senator. "I think we should open it and move on. Students think we are hiding the results from them. My opinion is we should open it."

INSIDE COLUMN 
Throwing the game 

What part of "Don't throw things on the court" don't you understand? 
Do you have so little respect for Coach Matt nohrrty and the Irish seniors that you needrd to take the game out of their 
hands? 
But the most important question is: Why would you ever throw something onto the court? 
When Jimmy Dillon, Skylard Owfms and Todd Palmer walked off the court for the last time in their 


Irish careers. they should

disgust. 
Can anyone blame them'? 

Dillon had left everything on the court. Hr picked up his fifth foul diving on the floor !'or a loose ball. Ilis hustle and heart should have played a pivotal role in the game. Instead, a fan in the stands drcidrd the Irish fatr. 
for the first time in years, the Notre Dame stu­dent body is a vocal presence at basketball games. Unfortunately, it has been known more for its stupidity and not for its cheering. 
Thanks to the action of three fans who threw trash on the court, the media will once again blast the Notre Dame student body. Sports columnists around the arra ,_.,,ill call the frish stu­dents "classless" or "immature." 
In front of a national television audience, Notre Dame fans looked like a bunch of children. 
"Maybe they shouldn't throw balls into the stands any more," Doherty said after the game. "It's too tempting to have a ball in your hands and not to throw it." 
It's too tempting for a 6-year-old not to throw a ball. A college student should have enough self­control to refrain from throwing things. 
All three people who threw items should hang their heads in shame. The first item tossed on the court was met with a warning directly from Doherty. 
For some reason, two fans felt that warning did not apply to them. 
The second thrower was lucky. Martin lngelsby threw the foam ball tossed from the stands off the court before a ref saw it. 
But the last item to fall from the stands was the most inexcusable and stupid event of the year for Irish fans. 
Because some fan felt the need to ignore a direct request from Doherty, the game was taken out of the players' hands and put into a water bottle. 
If the Irish find themselves NIT-bound. don't blame the ref who called the technical. 
Blame the guy who threw the water bottle. 

Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said after the game that his team would have won the game ¼ith or without the technical. 
Many Irish fans would love to be able to settle that question. But thanks to a fan .vho felt that he was bigger than the team. that question will never be answered. 
For Dillon, Owens. Palmer and everv senior in the student section, that student th"rew away much more than a basketball game; he threw away a proud ending to their home career. 
"It's unfortunate that it had to come down to that," Dillon said. "But that's basketball." 
That's basketball? 

No. Basketball is played on the court by the players, not some guy in the stands.

Two students arrested for drugs 
MADISON, Wis. 
Two University of Wisconsin-Madison students were arrested Monday for possession of drug para­phernalia and possession of narcotics with intent to deliver. Police later estimated the street value of the seized narcotics, mainly marijuana and Psilocybin mushrooms, at nearly $65,000. The Dane County Narcotics and Gang Task Poree responded to a call and obtained a search warrant for the apartment. Chris Lambrou and Michael Goot, both UW-Madison juniors, were arrested Monday after tenants told authorities of an odor coming from the apartment.A statement from the task force said they seized 7.5 pounds of "Dank Nugget" marijuana and 2,000 grams of Psilocybin Mushrooms as well as $2,915 in cash and numerous pieces of drug paraphernalia from the apartment. Lt. Bill Housley of the Dane County Narcotics and Gang Task Force said the bust was one of the largest in the history of Dane County."This sort of thing doesn't occur often," Housley said. "We got a pretty good quantity this time. This has been one of the biggest." 
Yale withdraws from FLA after rally 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

In one of the largest anti-sweatshop demonstrations to date, about 300 to 400 Yale University students ral­lied Tuesday to demand that their administration withdraw from the Fair Labor Association (FLA) and join the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC). Roth tlrn FLA and the WRC are organizations designed to moni­tor overseas sweatshops, but activists said clothing manufacturers have too great an influence on the FLA "We think the FLA is a sham," said Yale senior Amanda E. Bell, one of the organizers of Tuesday's rally. "We think it's a public relations ploy by corpora­tions. We would like to see Yale take a moral stand [by withdrawing]," Harvard Attorney Allan A. Byan Jr., the administrator most responsible for sweatshop poli­cy, said he supported the Yale students' right to rally, but that tho action would not affect Harvard's support of the FLA." I'm glad to see the first amendmm1t exer­cised in New Haven," he said. "This clearly is a matter of' concern to students, administrators, ~niversities. everyone. If they can get students together for a rally, then more power to them."

Gramick 
continued from page l 
In 1977 Gramick and Nugent co-founded "New Ways Ministrv" in Hanier, Md., to reach o·ut to gay and lesbian Catholics. 
Thi' Vatican began its investi­gation into Gramick and Nugent's ministry in 19&2. Some Catholics. including James Cardinal Hickey, archbishop of the Diocese of Washington, dis­agreed with aspects of their ministry. 
"These voices made their way to the Vatican," she said. rirst the Vatican requested a report from Gramick's provincial. Gramick quoted from the report, which said, "We think it would be counterproductive to dimin­ish this ministry in any way." 
Gramick and Nugent resigned as leaders of "l\'ew Ways Ministry" in 1984 hut they con­timwd lo hold workshops and retreals about homosexuality across the nation. 
The Vatican requested anoth­er reporl in 1985, and again the local report said that no action was necessary. 
Then, in 1988, the Vatican appointPd its own commission, which spent years in invcstiga tions and hearings, and released the decision to ban Grumick and Nugent's ministry in July 1999. 
Church leaders wanted Gramick to publicly affirm her support for the Church·s posi­tion on homosexualilv. 
"Public ministers l1avc a duty to know what the Church teach­es and to articulate it very clear­ly," said Gramick. 
Public ministers are not rC'quirl'd to articulate their indi­vidual beliefs. Gramick refused to answer an audience mem­ber's question, "Do you accPpt the C.hurch's teaching on homo sexuality'?" just as she had refused to answer the same question from the Vatican. 
"I choose not to make my con­science public," Gramick said. 
The Church position is that people arP calhd to follow tlrnir conscionco. even when it doesn't agn,A with the Church. 
"!"fow, we don't preach that a lot. That's why I say it [con­sciencel is one of the best kept sccrds in the Catholic Church," Gramick said. 
A disagreement basPd on con­science, however, must be seri­ously considered. 
"It's a very strongly hel<l per­sonal r.onviclion of truth or whal is right," said Gramick. She explained that H requires prayer, serious consideration of official Church position, reading scriptures and consulting with holy people -both priests and lay people. 

In the end though, one thing matters. 
"A consci<'nce docision is between you and God." said Gramick. 
Aftor much prayrr and renec­Hon, Gramick reached a deci­sion. 
"I still believed that God was calling me to ministnr to les­bians amt gays," slrn said. 
Grarnick disagreed not only with tho decision to limit her minislrv, but also with the Vatican's process. 
"That's hardly speed in the procPdure," Gramkk said of thf' 1i -year ordeal. 
She also cited the principle that to lhe degree possible mat­ters should be handled on the local level, rather than by high­er authorities. Those on the local level most intimately know the facts of a situation. 
"We will feel much more invested in our Church," said Grarnick noting the benefits of' decentralization. 
By disregarding the loeal reports, the Vatican did not 
adhere  to  this  principle,  
Gramiek said.  
Gramick has  a  masters in  

math from Notre Dame and a doctorate in teaehing from the University of Pennsylvania. The lecture was sponsored by the Progressive Students Alliance, College Democrats, the University Counsoling Center, Call to Action, GALA and OlJTreachND.

be made public. 
"Publie disclosure is an important issue," said Cimarron Gilson, Sorin Hall senator. "If some know the results, the student body has the right to know." 
'There is student opinion that the sen­ate is full of sneakiness and illegitimacy, we should end this. I am in favor of opening it," said Alumni sonator David Zachary. 
Overall, Dittmar summarized the com­ments by saying that students are losing faith in student government and show­ing the results could help give student government legitimacy again. 
"I have had many students ask me [what the results were]. Students want to know. There is a lack of trust and we need to restore this trust," he said. 
Despite most senators wanting to open the envelope, some disagreed. 
"I have reservations about opening tho results at this time," said off-campus senator Pat Foy. "Kelly [Folks] and Becky [Demko] are not here and we shouldn't do this behind their back. There is no final deadline for appeals and we all know there is potential for another appeal. If we open that we could possibly have to choose between what is in the envelope and what we think is right." 
Sonrn senators thought opening the envelope after April 1 -when no more appeals can be filed -would be opti­mal. Still others believed that since the results were null and void, they should never be opened. 
Right before the final vote, Palumbo urgr,d tho senators to follow their duty. "We do have a duty as senators.

Dan Peate, campaign manager for the Hanover/Micek campaign, thought see­ing the totals accomplished nol.hing. 
"I am proud of llunt and John for walking away from this," Peate said. "! wish everyone else would have followed their lead." 
However, O'Donoghue was glad to sec the results. 
"We're happy with the results as they turned out," president-olect O'Donoghue said. "We're grateful to those students who supported us through all this and we're not going to let them down.» 
In other Senate news: 
. Kerry Doolin, manager of ND Video spoke to the Senate about undergoing research into changing the store into something new. 
"Right now we are searching for the most feasible option which students will use the most," Doolin said. 
The two current options are a tanning salon or a knick-knack store.

One of the most important aspects of the vigil service was that during Mass, Murphy was praying along with the readings that had been sent to him. 
"Truly I think it was a great example of the Notre Dame community getting together and supporting one of its members," Napleton said. 
At the vigil. people were able to write words of encouragement and support to Murphy in a journal that will be sent to

Experi 

 South Bend women speak of challenges of raising children, finding jobs 
By NICOLE HADDAD 
News Writer 
Students were given the opportunity Wednesday after­noon to listen as !wo women described their personal chal­lenges in raising children and earning a living in the South 13end community. 
Guest speakers Yvonnfl !ludson and Dawn Clrnpla both focused on the impor­tance of making the right decisions as young women. 
Describing her life before coming to the Center for the llomeless in South Bend, llndson stated she was a sin­gle rnothn of five girls and addicted to drugs. 
"With no help and no job. I found myself wandering aim· lessly," she said. 
After undergoing a house 

fire and losing everything ­including her children to the government, Hudson came out of her denial and stepped into the Center for the Homeless. She attributes the Center for helping her find out many things about herself. 
"Life had brought me so many hardships. My mom was gay. and there wern many other things where I just needed acceptance," Hudson continued. "My oldest daugh­ter. 15, was pregnant and ran away." 
After leaving the Center, however, Hudson was informed of her now position working at WNDC radio sla tion. But evfm with this new job. Hudson still found that she still encountered struggles evi"rvdav. "I had to learn to keep· aw.ay from certain peo­ple, places and things -it's like bowling, just knor,k down the pins." 
lludson still interacts with the Center. Through speeches and activities, Hutlson says that she will never forget where she came from. 
Dawn Chapla shared her experiences about her 
younger daughter Brandy who 
learned the difficulty of rais­
ing children as a single moth­
er. 
"Brandy was very bright. 
but had a poor self-image," 
Chapla said, "and this affected 
her whole life and the choices 
she made." 
Chapla also shared her 
experience working at United 
Way, wlrnre she interacts with 
unions of' the communitv and 
repr:esentatives from thl: wel­
fare rnform panel. 
"Sr.cing more women work­ing in the community, I am also seeing more domestic vio­lence," Chapla said. "There arc issues in the home of con­trol and jealousy -and this ·leads the children to be more 
at risk." 
In spPaking of' welfare pro 
grams, Chapla said tlrn reform 
has helped many people get 
back to work "but they arr 
still poor." She said she 
believes the jobs available 
today "simply do not offer liv­
able wages with the benefits." 
Cha.pla said the most impor· 
tant thing for people to look at 
are the issues that help the 
community.

Gore, Bradley abandon 
Halt-Court Glorv
hard-line debate tactics 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES 

Bill Bradley and Al Gore agnrnd on more than they dis­puted Wednesday night, aban­doning hard-linn tactics in a mild debate often aimed at the Republicans -nlmost as though the Democratic r.ontest already was settled. 
Bradlry insistnd that it was not, that he still expects to take off against Gore in the Super Tt1esclay primaries in which 15 states select Democratic rlelrgates next week, 
Gore said he took nothing for 
granted. "I do think that the 
elections this coming Tuesday 
will likelv bf' dPcisivc for the 
nomination,'' he said in a CNN 
post-debale interview. I le leads 
the publir opinion polls in all 
thn upcoming states. and the 
debate was Bradley's finale in 
California. most critical of the 
Tuesday primary states. 
"Clearly, I have to win sever­
al," Bradley told CNN. He said 
he will campaign now in New 
York and New England. 
llis tone in his 10th debate 
with Gore recalled that of their 
first. in New Hampshire more 
than three months ago. when 
he shunned confrontation. 

before the lines hardened and the farfHo-fare sessions turned angry. 
"People toll me that I was too tough in the last debate," Bradley said after this one. "It's all in the eye of the beholder." 
HA said he had been deter­
mined to correct Gore misrep­
resentations. But he added: 
"Tonight's debate set a tone 
for the kind of presidency I'd 
like to have." 
Ile did contend tl1at thP 
administration's failure to take 
"action about six months ago" 
and release oil reserves had led 
to current soaring prices at the 
gas pump. 
Gore replied that the use of tlw strategic petroleum reserve to increase supplies and ease prices is not off the table. But first. he said, there should be quiet diplomatic pressure to get more OPEC oil flowing. 
Nothing to cornparr vdth ear­lier debates, in which the for­mer New Jersey senator had accusPd Gore of lying about his own record, and about Bradley's proposals, notably on health care, That issue, a point of bitter dispute before, came up only briefly in this debate. 
There was one flareup when 
Bradley accused Gore. as he 
had before, of voting in favor of

l\11zat Really Matters? 

There are few events in our lives that cause us as much pause as being confronted by our own mortality. We are rarely forced to consider what our lives, as they are, mean; nor are we often compelled to consider how much we actually mean to each other. We, on this campus, recently received the kind of news that ought to cause us pause, and that ought to compel us to consider what's important, what really matters to us. One of our number, Conor Murphy, a sophomore from Zahm Hall who has been studying on the Washington semester, was diagnosed with leukemia this past Friday. On Saturday he was flown from Washington to his home in Cleveland where he has since entered the hospital for more tests and treat­ment. 
There is a degree, obviously, to which this is about Conor, about our concern for him and an unabashed appeal to all of you for prayers for him. But my reflections here are as much about us, and about the introspection and self-reflection that has been prom pted by the news of Conor's impending battle; an introspection that is not only personal, but communal. I am struck by how Conor's news has redirected and reoriented the conversa­tions and questions of so many. I am surprised by the depth of the conversation that is taking place in the wake of the news; and I am deeply moved by the intensity of our prayer in these days. 
On the night he learned of the leukemia, I spoke with Conor on the phone and he asked me to go to the grotto and to light a candle for him. His words were reminiscent of Tom Dooley's in his letter to Fr. Hes burgh of so many years ago. Conor said that while he knows that his prayers are heard from his hospital bed, it would mean so much more to be at the grotto. But what struck me most about our conversation was Conor's suggestion, even as he was grappling with his own problems, that he was concerned about how he would tell his closest friends. Finally, we decided that it would be be st to bring as many of them together as we could and inform them all at once via speaker phone. While it was a very painful thing to be.there, it was at the same time, a rare privilege. After Conor had shared the news of his leukemia each of the guys went around and spoke their words of encouragement and support. Before we hung up we gathered in a circle, joined hands and offered a prayer of support and healing for Conor. 
It was an important moment in the lives of each of the men present and, I trust, in Conor's life as well. For his friends, and for all of us who know and love Conor, the events of these past few days have caused us to reevaluate our priorities. It has become, perhaps, painfully dear, that all that really matters and the only things that will ever give us any consolation or joy are our relationships. And that while we may legitimately pursue other things, like wealth and fame and success, none of them will mean anything unless we have intimates in our lives with whom to share them. Conor's circumstances have remind­ed us of that fact, and have caused us to speak the truth of our lives with more clarity and conviction. I am impressed by how much more often I have heard the word "love" used in speaking of their mutual affections, especially for Conor, in the wake of his illness. 
We are very proud of our brotherhood in Zahm Hall, as you undoubtedly all too well know; and more generally, we as a community speak of our membership in the Notre Dame Family. That "brotherhood" and that "family" have taken on new meaning for many in these days. It may be Conor's gift to us that we are more attentive to one another, that we know more than ever our need for one another, and finally, that we love one another even if we rarely speak the words. 
It's clear that if we've learned anything it's that our relationships are all that really matter. And perhaps we know, now more than ever, our need for the ultimate relation­ship, of that with our God. Conor knows it; his family and friends know it; it's time that we all knew it. We need God. We need to attend to our respective relationships with Jesus Christ if we are to make any sense of these days, if we are to see in it the paschal mystery being played out before our very eyes. 
I visited Conor in Cleveland on Monday and I am quite certain that he would not want us feeling sorry for him. He is remarkably strong and determined and hugely encouraged by the outpouring of love and support from the Notre Dame community. What he would appreciate, I'm sure, is if we would continue to storm the heavens with our prayrers, and not only for him and his family, but for each other. That which we are inclined to do anyway in these days, to pray, is our gift to him; that we have been drawn to it with such passion in light of Conor's predicament is his gift to us. In the end, please God, may it prove the means by which each and all of us deepen in relationship with our God, and with one another.

The Senate Intelligence Committee voted Wednesday to subpoena former CIA general counsel Michael O'Neil after he refused to voluntarily appear ~efore Lhe panel in its inquiry mto former CIA Director John Deutch's home computer secu­rity breaches.

from agency investigators and the Justice Department, members said. 
Committee Chainnan Richc1.rd Shelby, R-Ala., said in an inter­view. 'Tm sure he'll assert the Fifth Amendment, but we want him to do it in front of the com­mittee." 
O'Neil's attorney, Roger Spaeder, had notified the panel that he advised O'Neil not to appear since the Justice Department was taking a new look at the Deutch computer case. 
A key issue in the case is why it took so long for the CIA to react to December 1966 infor­mation that Deutch had stored highly classified material on home computers also used to access the Internet. 
"On behalf of Mr. O'Neil, I can represent to the committee that if compelled to appear, Mr. O'Neil would decline to testify about all matters under investi­gation by invoking his constitu­tional privilege," Spaeder said in a letter to the panel. 
O'Neil, who left the agency in October 1997, at first declined to turn over computer storage cards from Dentch's computers and delayed notifying the Justice Department of the mat­ter, according to an unclassified version of an internal CIA inspector general's report released by the committee last week. 
That report found that Deutch. CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996. processPd thousands of highly classified dowments on unpro­tected home computers that he and family members used to connect the lnlPrnet. 
Now a profrssor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Deutch was stripped of most of his securitv clearances b~ CIA Dirccto~ 
tarily gave 

them up earli­er this month. 
Deutch has apologized for his behavior, both in private testi­mony to the Intelligence Committee and in a brief appearance before reporters last week. 
But both the Senate panel and the Justice Department want to know why it took the CIA so long to notify them after discov­ering in December 1996 that Deutch had mishandled classi­fied material. 
The CIA agency did not sub­mit a report to the Justice Department until March 1998 and did not notify congressional oversight panels untH June 1998. 
The current director. George Tenet, has apologized for the delay but said it wasn't inten­tional. 
According to the CIA inspector general's report. Mr. O'Neil and Nora Slatkin, the CIA's former executive director and now an official with Citigroup, acted in a manner that "had the effect of delaying a prompt investigation ofthis matter." 
Slatkin has agreed to appear before the committee. 
The report also suggested that O'Neil had failed to send a "crimes report" to the Justice Department.

Over winter break my mountaine!'ring partner. Mike, and [ summited El Pico de Orizaba. an 18,600 foot dormant volcano in Mexico. Summit day itself was long. We got off to what is called an "alpine start." rising at 1 
a.m. and departing 
Todd Whitmore
from the base camp at 14,000 leet at 
1:45 a.m. in ordf'r to minimize the The Common time we would have Good to spend on the soft­er and therefore more dangerous afternoon snow and ice. 
At about 15.500, what had startf'd out as mild nausea. became a hent-ov<'r stop. We then contimmd on. Over the next 1,000 feet of altitude gain, I did manage to keep down two fig 1mwtnns and a cou­ple swigs of water, but dpcided that the accompanying discomfort was not worth it and took in no more. I went on a high altitude fast. I realized that l should have acclimatized one more day at base camp, but we were underway now. l was expe­riencing none or the other indicators of altitude sickness -lassitude, loss of coordination, headache. [n fact, once the nausea passed, I felt strong. 
We summited at 9 a.m. It was sup­posed to be the dry season, but we expe­rienced a whiteout on the descent that reduced visibilitv to 50 feet. Due to the bad weather, in'the time that we were on the mountain only one other person sum­mited among the 17 total attempts -a professional guide from the Colorado Mountain School. When we reached base camp, I could drink and, to a certain extent, eat again. I slept 13 hours that night. 
½'hy do such a thing? Why take up an activity where one of the best compli­ments that can be paid is to say a person "suffers well?" It certainly is not for the Mountain Dew/eXtreme games adrena­line buzz. Mountaineering is too deliber­ate an activity. Unless someone dies, it rarely makes it on T.V. 
At its best, it is also not done for any testosterone-driven display of machismo. There is risk, but it is calculated risk. Chest-thumping is ofiPn a prPlndc to death. Besides, when it comes to Denali ta.k.a. Mt. McKinlP.y!, most American men ofthis sort actually aspire less to climb the mountain than to own the SUV that goes by its name. Held strictly to their O\\ll criteriu. they are frauds ­morn consumer-driven than drawn by the mountain -no matter how much Gore-tex they mi!a{ht wear. 

Gi>nrge Mallory. whosf' body was recently discovernd on Everest. gave the most clear and succinct answer to why: "Because it is there." Above all. moun·­taineers climb because there is an allure, a beckoning. They might make a pruden­tial judgement to turn around on a par­ticular attempt, but they can no longer not climb. The cl()sest analogue I have is my marriage: It is hard for me to imagine life (as indeed lifol before knowing Susan. and it is painful even to try to imagine life without her. 
St Augustine's two most well-known statements express the Christian "bP.cause it is there": "Love God. and do what you will" and "You made us for yourself' and our hearts find no peace until they rest in you." It is not incidental that most mountaineering writings are confessionals structured as pilgrimages to Mallory's "there" and back again. 
Catholic teaching provides another term for this kind of activity that will at first jar our sensibilities because the word. like many others, has been distort­ed in contemporary language: leisure. In addition to housing, food and health care, Catholic social teaching includes leisure -as distinct from luxury ­under the basic human rnmds covered bv the just wage. In our frenetic culture we· often take the term to mean inactivity, but it is best understood as that time and spaco given ovf'r to an activity for its own sake. It is the vocation of avocation, the thing we do simply because it is there. 
One of my brothers-in-law rebuilds "woodies" -classic wood-panelod sta­tion wagons -in his basement. At a recent family reunion, he recounted for me, with some sadness, the transition from wood to fiberglass to decals as car­makers found that buyers would settle for less. Image, even poorly done image, became everything. He is now working on a 1949 Ford, and he does so as if he is reconstituting truth. And he is. 
Though he likes his job and is a very good and loving father, some days he works simply because of thP. need for family income and drives his children to baseball practice because someone has

to. But he works on the woody because there is nothing quite like the look and feel of the grain. To be vocations. work and family must have an intrinsic draw, but tho vocation of avocation, when authentic, rPsponds only to this allure. 
It is this intrinsic allurP -this for­itselfness -that often gives avocations an eccentric character when viewed from the outside. My brother-in-law rebuilt one woody and then had to disas­semble parts of it because in his focus on what he was doing. he neglected to con­sider bow he might get it out of the base­ment. Friends kindly warned me in my pre-tnnurc years that I might want to keep my backpack-laden running of the library stairs discreet. 
Whatever the eccentricity factor. the for-itselfness of vocational avocations serve an important protective role. Our other vocations, often propelled by their very richness, sometimes over-extend their claims on our lives. Notre Dame itself has perform a tive expectations that often do just that, whether what is in question is the won-loss record of the football coach, the publishing record of a faculty member or the performance of a student in a class where the professor assigns a workload as if the student has no other courses or commitments. Despito ourselves we often seek to turn another's vocation into something we own. Appeals to "tradition" or "the "JotrP Dame family," rwen with their authentic meanings. sometimes scrvr, at the same time to mask and thus facilitate this pre­sumption. 
Though the purpose in pursuing avoca­tions is intrinsic, they also function as countervailing commitments. As such. they help us to gain perspective on the claims our other vocations make on us. In the case of Notre Dame, such perspec­tive helps both to demythologize what it says about itsell' and, in turn, to make us attentive to the ways in which. in proper measure, God's grace acts in and through it as well.

Learning about racism 
I have been paying enough attention to the editorial pages of the Observer in the last few weeks to notice that we havH had a couple of points about racism debated lately. I am a white student from a small town in Oregon that generally lacks diversity, so it may seem that I wouldn't have anything 
to say on this topic. But I do. (That's what being a columnist is all about.) 
Mostly what I have to say is that I don't understand a lot of things about racism. I imagine that thore is probably a silent but sizable number of peoplf' who are as unsure as I am. It used to be, when I was little, that racism was saying certain words or believing cer-

llere We Go Again 

tain false stereotypes or looking down on someone because of' their race. 
Hut nowadays, it seems that racism is less men in sheets and pointy hats and more everyday people who don't realize they are doing harm. I am unfortunately. a rather racially uncducatf:d person. While I understand blatant racism. I sometimes do not understand the Jess obvious forms that racism can take. 
Like every other freshman on campus, 1went through a diversity workshop during the first month of school. Mine was early in the morning, so I can't say I remember it all that well. But I do n~member being told that I could be racist or do something racist and not even know it. 
This thought has made me paranoid. I am sometimes so worrii,d about doing something that could be racist that I simply avoid the situation altogether. Once I know someone, I lose the paranoia, because the first impression of appear­ance fades. When I know someone, I forget about their race, and I don't worry so much about things related to it. But for pnople I am just meeting, or strangers I have to interact with, I often have nothing to go on but appearance, and my para­noia can cause me problems,. . . . 
Case in point: Sometimes I work down in Grab 'n' Go. At times, this means that I swipe people's ID cards. Athletes are allowed to get about twice as much food as other people when they eat from Grab 'n' Go. When athletes eat, we have to swipe their card through the special athletic machine before swiping them through the regular machine. The spe­cial machine gives the Grab 'n' Go an extra two dollars for the athlete's extra food. 
Last semester, I was doing the card swiping when a really big African-American guy came to the desk. The guy was really huge, he had a ton of food in his bag and I was pretty sure that they guy was an athlete. But I also specifically remembered talking about the incorrect stereotype that all African-American guys are athletes at the diversity work­shop. 
I didn't want to do anything that could seem like I was operating under such a stereotype, so I didn't ask the guy if he was an athlete, and I didn't swipe his card in the special machine. I just let him go by. I know he was an athlete because the regular machine wishes all athletes "good luck" when you swipe their card, and the machine wished him good luck. Because I was so worried about seeming racist, I actually lost the Grab 'n' Go money. This is how paranoid I sometimes am. 
I think many people, like myself, are well-intentioned but don't always know what constitutes a racist act. Growing up, it was obvious. But as I have grown up, I have seen that some people are hurt by things that I don't automatically see or understand as racist. 
f don't think the problem is even thoughtlessness in most cases. There was a letter to the editor on Friday, February 18, that described a situation caused by ignorance. The writer detailed a situation that happened to a Hispanic friend who had written a paper that the teacher had graded poorly. 
Aller class, the teacher asked the Hispanic friend if English was his first language. (It was.) 
The writer told us that this was a case of an ignorant racist act, and I am sure that is true. However, it took me about a week of thinking to finally come to an understanding of why this would be a racist thing to do. It seemed to me like a harmless, though embarrassing, attempt to help a student. I guess that I, too, am ignorant of the etiquette of race rela­tions. 
The dil1iculty of being ignorant in this case is that realizing you am ignorant is not in and of itself enough to solve the problem. Somehow you must learn what it is you do not know. 
llowevcr. vvhile, I truly want to understand how to not be racist, 1simply don't know where to go or how to learn. All I can do is hope that through my very real desire to learn and the various opportunities I experience in my everyday life, I will be able to figure out the answers to my questions.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Taking time out of play to pray 
I know that many people have sung the praises of our new basketball coach in recent weeks. Now. I hate to heat a dead horse as often happens with these letters to the editor, but I was recently pleased to see that Coach Doherty comes to play when it really counts. As many of you who read the inside column the other day know, Conor Murphy, a sophomore in my dorm. was recently diagnosod with leukemia, 
The members of our dorm decided to hold a 24­hour vigil for Conor at the grotto. with two people being present for each of the 30 minute shifts throughout the day and night. We had a book that we encouraged everyone to write their thoughts in for Conor to help lift his spirits. 
Much to my surprise, who was one of the first people to leave a note in that book? Coach Matt Doherty. How he heard about the vigil I don't know. But the fact that he would take the time out of his busy day to stop by a vigil and leave a note for a student that he doesn't know, shows me that he truly is a representative and a man that this University can be proud to have as one of its own. 
To all the rest of you who attended the vigil, I commend you as well, for giving of your time to think of and pray for Conor. And for those of you who didn't attend, whether you know Conor or not, plMse say a prayer for him tonight. It will only take two minutes of your time, but it could make all the difference in the world.

What it means to be W.I.L.D. 
We women of Walsh are unhappy. We are unhap­py because of the dramatic changes that have been slowly taking over our dorm this past year. We are tired of being referred to as adults yet treated like children. Decisions have been made that directly affect us without our consent or input, so this is our attempt to voice our complaints to a hall staff that continues to turn a deaf ear. 
The Wild Woman has been our dorm mascot for a number of years. \'\bat most considered to be a fun, harmless, even "silly" rep­resentation of Walsh and its resi­dents has turned into a contro­versial symbol of the authoritat­ian leadership of the hall staff. Without our knowledge or approval, the staff decided to turn the word "wild" into the acronym "W.I.L.D." which stands for "Wise In life's Decisions." According to this year's hall staff, if "wild" remained undefined, the connota­tions of the word would reflect poorly on Walshites. This had never been an issue in prior years, and the fact that it has now become 
~ ~ 

one seems ridiculous and unneces-~.,,.._.._...._..... ~-... sary. ~ 
Returning to campus after Christmas ~ break, we were summoned to a mandato-~,,. ry hall-wide meeting in which, among other pressing issues, we were berated for our sup­posed apathy towards our dorm activities. Today, our dorm-wide dance was canceled because we 
were two people short of the required 90 needed to hold the dance. Although duLac no longer specifies the precise number of participants necessary to 
h Id a dance, and with 88 sets of tickets sold, 
!early we could have broken even if not made money by having this dance. However, the hall staff had arbitrarily set 90 as the minimum number and was unwilling to compromise at 88. Not only was the dance canceled, but there was no room for discussion on 
this matter. Thus. there are 88 dis­appointed Walshites this weekend (not to mention numerous men 
now dateless). 
Making wise life decisions is what we've been encouraged to do. And yet, the privilege of mak­ing any decisions has not been afforded us this year as Walsh residents. Walsh is one of the smallest dorms on campus, and a 
turn-out of 88 shows that we are not apathetic towards our dorm life. How apathetic will Walshites become now that our hall staff has 
yet again used their authority to make decisions we don't agree with? It's not about the acronym: it's not about the dance. It's about the general sense of futility in our efforts to main­tain a positive dorm spirit and enjoy our remaining time in Walsh.

Legacy and spirit of the Bouts 
As a former president of the ND Boxing Club, I would like to applaud the Bengal Bouts boxers, Observer Sports writers and editors and ND stu­dent body for putting together another fantastic event thjs year. 
Judging by the exciting fight coverage from the first two rounds, the participants and fans are truly making this tournament memorable. As I look forward to attending the fights this Friday for the first time since graduation in '97, I can only hope that the turmoil alluded to in the Observer's pre-Bouts coverage has run its course. 
There seems to be much concern for the "true meaning" of tho Bengal Bouts, and what elements combine to make this tradition a hallmark of the ND experience. I urge all those who are in support of the Bengal Bouts to remember that the coaches and trainers of the Boxing Club are not only the heart, soul and body of the program, thfly arc "Nappy" Napolitano's legacy. Allow me to reiter­ate, the only ones in tho boxing club currently who have even met Nappy, let alone trained under him, are the coaches. It has been through their tireless efforts to maintain Nappy's vision t'or the Bengal Bouts that provides the student officers freedom to put on an event that seems to improve greatly with each year. 
I have known the Bengal Bouts program as a participant, president and now alumnus, and can not stress enough that I have never encountered a higher caliber of individuals than those who attend, participate in and organize the Notre Dame Bengal Bouts. There are 100-plus boxers in this year's tournament. There will be as many champions this year. That is the spirit of the Bouts. 
A recent article alluded to the middle weight divisions and he suggested any victory may be a hollow one for lack of competition. To this absur­dity I simply challenge all of you who agree: Go and watch the fights, and if you are still not con­vinced that this year's Bouters deserve as much respect as any, I suggest you get in shape over the summer and try the Bouts for yourselves next year. 
If you do you will realize that there is not one person involved with the tournament who has anything in mind but the continued success and safety of the Bengal Bouts, it's participants and the Notre Dame student body. 
Good luck to all those fighting on Friday, and congratulations to all for another great year of boxing.

that, inevitably, films that didn't do Theron and Gary Sinise the ending is a

"Reindeer Games" tells the story of Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck). a convict­ed car thief with only three days left in his prison sentence. His cellmate, Nick (James Frain. "Hilarv and Jackie"), gets out at the same time. but unlike Hudy. he has a beautiful young woman. Ashlev {Charlize Theron). waiting for h(m.

And for that. the blame must fall to the screenwriter. Writer Ehren Krugr,r is riding a hot streak. He penned last year's "Arlington Road" and became the anointed follower of Kevin Williamson as the writer of this win­ter's "Scream 3." Both of those films were good, but also had terrible end­ings. f-Ie seems to like the excessive and both "Arlington Hoad" and "Scream 3" were arguably illogical. "Heindeer Carnes" runs into the same problem. It's just too mur,h of a good thing.

He is helped by his stars, who make the most of their respective roles. Affleck ("Dogma," "Armageddon") plays the hardened convict with great cynicism and grumpy fun. He has lied to Ashley about his identity and so he is acutely aware of the possible der.ep­tion going on around him. There's an intelligence to his character Lhat is often lacking in thrillers of this kind. 
Theron ("Mighty Joe Young," "The Cider llouse Rules") plays Ashley as a woman just looking for love. until her true intentions are revealed. And Garv Sinise ("Forrest Gump," "Snake Eyes';) has devilish fun as the small time crook, who has never actually rommit­ted a robbery before. but still behaves like he is indeed a bad ass. 
There was one oddity to the film: the end of February is a weird time to release a film using the Christmas hol­iday as a central element of the film (especially with the spring-like weath­er the r,ountry's been having). It uses the familiar sights and sounds of Christmas in a very humorous man­ner. and the audi~nce would have probably appreciated it much more had they been given the chanr,e to sec it in the freezing cold of December. with the ambianr,c of Christmas in full forr,c. 
"Heindeer Games" is a bit like Christmas itself; truly pretty good. but a bit overdone.

Strange people do strange things in 'Wild At Heart' 
By V. VAN BUREN GILES Scene Movie Critic 
..Wild at Heart" is arguably David Lynch's !"Dune" "Lost Highway." "Hlue Velvet") best and most highly acclaimed film. This is a story that centers on two young lovers who are adventurous. dangerous and generally "wild at heart." 
The main characters are Sailor, played by Nicolas Cage ("Face Off," "Leaving Las Vegas." "8mm"I. and his main squeeze Lula. played by Laura Dern (".lurassir, Park," "A Perfect World." "Mask"). Sailor has jet-black hair. wears a"Wild At Heart" snakeskin jacket and looks and sounds like a '90s
Director: David Lynch 
version of Elvis. Starring: Nicholas Cage, Laura Lula is a tall blonde who
Dern. Diane Ladd, Crispin Glover, 
dresses rather 

Harry Dean Stanton and Willem Dafoe 

scantily and has 
an ar.cent that 
sounds like it's 

only a generation removed from poor white trash. The two make a great vision of light and darkness but share the same mentality: Live life fast and hard. die young and leave a good-looking corpse. 
Both are perfectly happy with the other. but Lula's mother. played by Diane Ladd, is a complete "nut job" and despises Sailor immensely. She cannot understand the happiness that her daughter experi­ences with him. She will do anylhing to keep Sailor from being with her daughter. 
The opening scene of the movie shows Sailor defending himself from a guy that Lula·s mother 
hired to kill him. The mother's anger becomes more furious when, artcr bning incarcerated for many yPars. Sailor gets out and plans on resuming his relationship with Lula. This time Lula's mother gets help from her Gangster buddy, Marcellos Santos, to put a murder contract on Sailor. She also sends her boyfriend. Johnny Farragout.. played by llarry Dean Stanton ("Alien"). to track the couple and bring them back in a less deadly manner. 
As is characteristic of practically every David Lynch film, an assortment of strange charactc1rs pop up at various stages of the couple's adven­tures. Some of them even have principle roles. Crispin Clover ("The People vs. Larry Flynt") plays the very comedic role of Jingle Dell. who's bizarre habits lead him to bdicvc thal alir.ns from outer space arc after him. But the weirdest and most effective supporting role is from Willem Dafoe ("The Last Temptation of Christ") as the dem1rnted Hobbv Varou. ,vl10 lrn.s an attraction to Lula as well as a n1ission to kill Sailor. 
There am many refr.rnnces to ''The Wizard of Oz" sr.a ttered throughoul the movie: Lula's mother is portrayed as the wicked witch ol' the west, Sailor gets advice from the good witch of' the north. and the couple's car journey is associated with the trip down the vellow 1.Jrick road. 
The mm' is visually stunning and well acted by all lhe lead and bit players. Though there are some scenes of extrnme sex and violencr.. these do not take away from the performances or from the story. At the 1990 Cannes Film Festival, "Wild at Heart" won Th!' Golden Palm (the festival's version of Best Picture). People who liked the films "Natural Born Killers" or "Bonnie and Clyde" should check out "Wild at Heart." Most people, however. probably have never seen a film like this.

"Wondf\r Boys" is a quirky movie that tells the storv of one wild weekend when everything i~ Grady Tripp's life. and the lives of several other people, comes crash­ing down. For starters. his wife leaves him. llis mistress. Frances McDormand. who is also the chancdlor of the liberal arts college where he teachr,s, tells him slw is prngnant. Not to mention that his editor !Hobert Downey Jr.), who's in town for the annual Wordfest (think Sophomore Literary Festival), is trying to get a look at Grady's book, the ending of which. as Grady puts it, "heps getting further 
away." 
It would not be acr.urate to say that Grady has writer's block. In far.t, he suf­fers from a case quite the opposite. His 
Holmes). who rents a room from Gradv and has a crush on him. Other storvlines inr.lude a dead ·dog, a jacket that was worn by Marilyn Monroe and a crazv James Brown look-alike, whose name may or may not be Vernon. As this seflmin~ly dirnctionless film bar­rels on, it acquires new characters and new storvlines almost 
rornpulsively. As a result: pretty much everything in this movie is underdevel­oped. Although this is a detriment to the film because its characters and dia­logue are so original. it also manages to keep its audience interested through some prir.elessly funny moments and insightful narration by Michael Douglas along the way. 
It would be easy to cast this movie off as tangential and spineless, but that would be missing the point. The spine of the movie is all of these tangents. Hanson, who wove together thousands of r.haracters and sto­rylines so brilliantly in "L A. Confidential." has managed to do it again, almost. 
The film definitely spirals out of control at certain points. but it succeeds in illus­trating the r.entral idea that reflects Socrates' philosophy about life being the journey, not the destination. This is why the film's main character, Tripp, is so aptly named. Does this underlying mes-


Michael Douglas plays Grady Tripp, an English professor struggling to finish his novel in the offbeat comedy "Wonder Boys." 
sage justify the trite ending, which wraps up all the loose ends far too easily? Maybe. If you haven't written this film off before the final thought. you will probably buy that too. 
Despite the fact that the characters never reach their fullest potential, "Wonder Boys" is well-acted. It is always refreshing when Michael Douglas ("Wall Street," "A Perfect Murder") takes a break from playing sexual deviants and murder­ous business tycoons to portray a charac­ter with some heart and emotion. 
His co-star. Tobey Maguire, has definite­ly got that troubled, soft-spoken teenager thing down pat. There is something intriguing about his deliberate speech and pensive cadence, as seen in films like "The Cider House Rules" and "The Ice Storm." 
One of the most enjoyable things about "Wonder Boys" is its literary frame of mind. It is a film about a writer who sees the world as a piece of fiction. Grady finds truth and meaning in literature but has trouble translating that truth into reality, which is why his personal life is in sham­bles. The structure of this film purposely reflects the dilemma of his overdue book. The longer it gets, the further it gets away from the truth, which is actually quite sim­ple. 
"Wonder Boys" is an oflbeat film, origi­nal and creatively comic. What a long, strange "Tripp" it's been.

Battier leads Duke to solid victory over Clemson 
Associated Press 
Chris· Carrawell has lived with Duke's high expectations for years so he wasn't going to let teammate Shane Battier or the fourth-ranked Blue Devils settle for just a r:arner night. 
Despite Ilattier·s career-high seven 3­pointers and Duke's 19th straight Atlan lie Coast Confornnce road victory, Carrawell wanted more after the 92-78 win over Clemson on Wednesday 
night. . 
"How many did he have? Seven'?" Carrawell asked. "I told him he should have had 12. He choked." 
"The always loquacious Chris Carrawell. every­body," answered Battier, who had 26 points. 
In the past month, the Blue Devils (23-4, 14-1) lost at home to Maryland and St. John's. Thev were without key reserve Mike Dunleavy, who returned from his home in Oregon to Durham, 
N.C. on Wednesday to 
continue recovery from mononucleosis. And the Tigers (10-18, 4-11) are playing better than their record. 
"We've had to live with the expectations for a long time now," said Carrawell. who scored 19 points. "For us to accom­plish all we want, we have to handle them. This was part of it. This gets us ready for the weekend." 
That's when North Carolina comes to Cameron Indoor Stadium, where Duke hasn't been its dominat­ing self. 
"We're not the Duke team that we were a few weeks ago," coach Mike Krzyzewski said. "But we're still fighting like crazy. If we can keep get­ting better while Dunleavy's gune, maybe when he comes back we'll be a better basket­ball team." 
ff Battier, a junior, and Carrawell, a senior, play like they did at Littlejohn Coliseum. Krzyzewski might not worry so much. 
Battier seven 3-point-
The University ofNotre Dame Department of Music Guest Artist Series presents the 
ers broke his career bt1st by one and Carraweil clamped down on ACC leading scorer Will Solomon as the Blue Devils recovered from Saturday's onc-poiut home loss to No. 18 St. John's. 
Battier was almost per­fect from long range in the first half, going 6-of­
7. and sent Duke to its eighth straight victory over Clemson. 
Solomon, thP league's top scorer at 20.6 points a game, had 26 points, but Carrawell harassed him throughout and he was 10-of-26 from the field. 
Tho Blue Devils havr, been so dominant the past four seasons -with four consecutive ACC titles -that any slip has some wondering what's wrong. It happened Feb. 
9. when Maryland ended their 31-garrie ACC win­ning streak. And it hap­pened again this week as the Heel Sturm became just lhe third mmconfer­onco team in 130 games to win at Cameron Indoor Stadium. 

Batticr's 3-point bar­rage quickly shut down Clemson's hopes of end­ing Duke's ACC road win­ning streak. 
"When someone starts making shots like that, they get in a zone," said Solomon, someone who should know. 
Battier's baskets almost all came at crucial moments. 
Ho hit two straight dur­ing a personal 8-0 run as Duke moved ahead 16-9. He had twn more during a 9-4 run that put the Blue Devils up 27-17. His last, off a crisp inbounds pass from Carrawcll, closed an 11-0 spurt that sent Duke to a 38-22 lead.

I want to be a professional athlete, not a role model 

What I want to be when I grow up: 
Someday I want to bo a pro­fl'ssional athlete. I want to hear the crowds cheering for me. I want to be on televi­sion so that all of the little kids can look up to me. But I don't want to be a role model. [ just want them to watch me play sports, not anything else. That's my private life. 
I want to make a lot of money. That way I can buy too many expensivt~ cars, wear lots of jewelry and bribe the cops just like Sebastian Janikowski did. 
If I have a lot of money, then l can behave any way that I want like Dennis Rodman. Go ahead, fine me a $13,500 in five games this season; I make $12,195 per game. I'll make it back in just over a game. 
Plus, Rodman doesn't even have to go to practice or do anything but show up for the games. 
My coach always tells me to practice like I want to play, but I think he's full of it. 

Dennis doesn't haVf" to, why do 
I? 
Sometimes I just want to choke my roach, like LatrPII Spreewell. Things worked out pretty well for him. Now he's on a better team and evcrvone loves him. He's the Ameri~an dream. I didn't see any shop, contracts before he choked him. That would feel good. Next time the r:mi.ch makes me nm. maybe I'll choke him. 
All of the pro athletes get away with anything they want. I want to get away with every­thing too. No one ever g«>ts pros in trouble, unless they do something really bad like com­mit murder. Even then, they c.an usually hire Johnny Cochran to get them off. 
They can beat their girl­friends like Lawrence Phillips or drink too much like Steve Howe. They can do drugs like Leon Lett or get prostitutes like Eugene Robinson. If' they wanl to they can do both like Daryl Strawberry and Michael Irvin. 
The best thing is that even when they do get in trouble, they get lots of chances. How many has Daryl had? And everyone just feels sorry for the athletes if they get caught. 
They get some great dis­counts at department stores because everyone recognizes them, especially at Dillard's. I hear that's where some of the best athletes hang out. You have to be good for that

though. For most athletes, that's just stealing. For a good athlete, it's a gift from God. 
And talk about being popu­lar. Pro athletes gel all of the girls. They have lots of' kids too; kids that peoplo want them to take care ol'. I wish I were a pro star's kid. Then Im could send me $1,000 per month in child support from bis million-dollar check. Everyone would call him a good dad and I'd agree. I could brag to everyone that my dad was Shawn Kemp. 
I'd love to see him maybe once a year, but athletes arc busy, he probably wouldn't have time for me. Oh well 
People say that sports have too much violence, but I don't think so. Some of my favorite stuff is the fighting. Marty McSorely is so cool. Oid you see the way he jacked up that guy? Sometimes I think the only thing that's interesting about hockey is the lighting and the violence. 
Or how about when the baseball players brawl? They

get suspended sometimes, but the cops stay out of it. 
People shouldn't criticize them so much. They have a tough job and have to release their tension somehow. It's only natural to want to light. 
Being an athlete has a lot of hard things too though, like watching what you say. I learned in class about the first amendment stating that I can say whatever I want no matter the ignorance. stupidity or meanness of it. 
But for athletes, that doesn't apply. I mean look at John Rocker and Reggie White. Well, at least John Rocker, nothing really happened to Reggie. He's the most hated man in sports and for good reason. What he did was wrong. He shoul<l've gone and snorted cocaine instead. At least then, fans would be sad instead of mad. 
Athletes can't bet either. But I wouldn't do that. I know how bad that is. Look at Pete Rose. He bet and they won't let him ever come back to baseball. I agree. Baseball can't risk ruining its reputation by let­ting a gambler back in. They should just stick to people that throw firecrackers at little kids like Vince Coleman or wife-beaters like Wil Cordero or even players that play hard all the time and appreciate the fans like Albert Belle. 
Des pile all of those tough things though. I want to grow up just like those guys. That way, kids like me now can try to be like me when I grow up. But I don't think I should havu to be a role model. I want them to want to be like me, but not to BE like me. 
Sincerely, 
Your everyday kid

kept on coming back and maki plays and making shots." 
Every time Thomas or game­high scorer Ryan Blackwell nailed a basket. the Irish answered, whether with an !\BA-length 3.-pointer by Dillon, a rebound tip-in by sophornorc forward David Graves or a 3­pointer by freshman Mike 1\Ionserez. 
"You've got to come out with your hfiad high," Graves said. "A 1 (,-point margin against a team like that, that's arguably the best team in the Big East, arguably the best team in the rountry. It's a credit to us that we came back, but we just dug ourselves too big of a hole." 
But in the end, Notre Dame's sixth man -the student body -helped Syracuse stave off the Notrn Dnmr attack. 
After an intentional foul was called on Graves with 8.8 sec­onds remaining, a Notre Dame student threw an empty plastic bottle onto the court, resulting in a technical foul against Notre Dame. A two-point Irish deficit quickly turned into five, and Troy Murphy's 1-pointPr with 0.7 seconds remaining was not enough to pull the Irish over the hump. · 

"It's part of the game," Graves said. "We've been in a lot of close games. Some plays have gone our way; some things haven't. You can't blame it on the fans. The fans are the rea­son why we are in the position that we are. They've been great all year." 
Notre Dame's decision to fight to the finish is one that has been made throughout the year. 
Back in November, Notre Dame let ranked opponent Indiana leap out to a 17 -0 advantage, then battled back to send the game to overtime. 
Against conference foe West Virginia on Feb. 2, Notre Dame turned things around from a 51­40 deficit to the second half to win 79-65. 
In the Irish home victory over the Connecticut Huskies, the Irish trailed by as many as nine before bringing their "A" game to the floor. 
Perhaps the Irish are pleased with their ability to come back, but they also realize that early ruts are difficult to return from. 
"We've just got to be ready to play two halves," Dillon said. "We've got to be ready for 40 minutes, not 20." 
Notre Dame's refusal to go down for the count is a season­long affair. Predicted to crowd around the bottom of the Big East, Notre Dame opened its season with an upset victory over returning Final Four team Ohio State. 
After winning the first four games of their season, Notre Dame dropped four straight against quality opponents ­Arizona, Maryland, Indiana and Vanderbilt. A week later, it suf­fered one of its most crushing defeats of the season, a 16-point loss against a mediocre Miami (Ohio) team. Sitting at 4-5 on the year, naysayers again began to discount the Irish. 
They responded with a seven­game winning streak, capped ofT by a 7 5-70 road win over the defending national champion Connecticut Huskies. 
Whenever it seemed the Irish were ready to fold, they sur­prised someone with a win. Nearly ruled out of NCAA con­tention after falling on the road at Pittsburgh and Villanova, Notre Dame earned two-point victories over both Connecticut and Seton Hall. 
Only this time, they don't have time to recover. 
"This team has a lot of char­acter," Graves said. "We're not going to quit." 
Only a Saturday match against the Georgetown Hoyas and the Big East tournament remain as chances to convince the NCAA tournament selection committee that they deserve a trip. 
"You talk about your backs being to the wall," Doherty said. "Our backs are through the wall right now." 
The Irish have proven their critics wrong before. They would like nothing more than to do so one more time by winning the Big East tourney to head to March Madness for the first time in 10 years. 
Don't count the Irish out just yet. They could be the Cinderella team of the 2000 tourney.

"It shouldn't have come down to that." senior point guard Jimmy Uillon said. "We gut down by 14 and dug our­selves a hole. Yeah it's a piv­otal point in tho game and wo wish it didn't happen." 
Tim Irish wish the first half didn't happen either. Syracuse made five of its first six 3­pointers and jumped out to an early double digit load. Preston Shumpert, who killed the Irish in the teams' first meeting, made all four of his shots including three 3-point­ers. 
Rvan Blackwell was also 
unstoppable, pulting up 15 
points in the first half. 

"They are a tough team to play zone against," Doherty said. "Thev have a lol of' intor­changeab.le people that are tough to match up against. Shumpert was just ridiculous in the first half.

"Our kids showed great character and didn't quit." Doherty said. "We beat them by 12 points in tlrn second half, but two [losses! is a trend. but we just made it a third. \'\'e need to right this ship quickly." 
Blackwell finished with a game-high 24 points for the Orangemen, who clinched at least a tie for the Big East regular season crown. Etan Thomas finislrnd with 15 points and 'l 6 rebounds, while IIart added 16 poin Ls and six assists.

MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Notre Dame drops heart-breaker to Syracuse 
+ Technical foul seals Irish fate; comeback falls short 
By BRIAN KESSLER Spores Editor 
Head coach Matt Doherty got on the microphone and warned the fans not to throw anything on the court. 
Two fans decided not to listen. And when a water bottle hit the court in the clos­ing seconds or the Syracuse 73 
game. Notre Noire Dame 71 
Dame was assessed a tech­nical foul that sealed its fate. 
"It was the third time something hit the floor and I was on the mic after the first one." Dohertv said following Wednesday's 73-il loss to No. 9 Syracuse at the Joyce Center. "The officials never warned us, but I guess I warned us. It was a tough time to make that call, but we shouldn't have been in that position." 
The Irish, however. had the OrangPmen just where they wanted them. After trailing by 14 at the break and by as many as 16 in the second half. l\otre Dame was down just two points with 44 seconds left in the game and in position to win or send it to overtime. But an intentional foul on David Graves and the ensuing technical on the crowd led to the Irish's demise. 
Rvan Blackwell made 2-of-4 foul shots and Syracuse took possession of the ball with 8.8 seconds and a four-point lead. Damone Brown was a fouled and made 1-of-2 foul shots to push the lead to five. Troy Murphy then drained a desperation

. Irish refuse to throw in towel after 16-point deficit 
Down 16 points against the No. 9 team in the nation. a lot of teams would have thrown in the towel. 
BuL the Notre Dame men's l.Jasketball team made a different decision. It chose to light to the fin­
ish with a gritty second-hair effort that brought it within two points of Big East leader SyracusA. 
"Our guys com­peted and hung in there against a 


very good basket-Kathleen 
ball team," Notre O'Brien 
Dame head coach 
Matt Doherty said. 
"We put oursnlves Irish Insight 
in that position 
Idown 16 points[. 
and we can't do 
that." 
Syracuse's senior center Etan Thomas slam dunked to open the sec­ond half. which puL his team up 47-31. At that point, senior point guard Jimmy Dillon, playing for the final time on his home court. started ofT an Irish conrn­back with a 3-pointer. 
"That just shows the character of the team," Dillon said. "Coach jumped on us a little bit." 
Playing tenaciously throughout the second half, the Irish inched their way back into contention. Pre-season All­American Troy Murphy scored 12 sec­ond-hair points. and freshman Jere Macura scored all 12 of his points in the second period. 
"I don't think I've ever seen anyone make tougher 3s thari they made in the second half," Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim said. "They were in a big hole. They're a young team, and they just

Solid doubles play leads Irish to victory over Wildcats 
Special to the Observer 
The 15th-ranked Notre Dame women·s tennis team used a scrambled, but effective. dou­bles lineup to beat 12th-ranked Northwestern 6-3 on Wednesday at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
After the teams split the six singles matches, the Irish raced to 8-2 wins at the No. 1 and No.3 doubles to clinch their sixth consecutive victory over the Wildcats. Notre Dame improves to 8-4 with the win and will face 33rd-rankecl Ohio State on Thursday in Toledo, Ohio. Northwestern falls to 9-2 with the loss. 
An injury to Irish junior Kimberly Guy forced the breakup of Notre Dame's 16th­and 17th-ranked doubles teams. Junior All-American Michelle Dasso. who is ranked 17th in doubles with sophomore Becky Varnum, tPamed at No. 1 dou­bles with freshman Katie Cunha. Cunha is normally Guy's partner and make up the 16th-ranked team in the country. Varnum and sophomore Nina Vaughan paired together for just the third time ever and rolled to an 8-2 win over Jennifer Lutgert and Leigh Weinraub at No. 3 dou­bles to give the Irish a 4-3 lead. Cunha and Dasso -playing together for the first time ­beat 51st-ranked Colleen Cheng and Katherine Nasser 8-2 at No. 1 doubles to clinch the win. Notre Dame's usual No. 3 dou­bles team of sophomore Lindsey Green and Kelly Zalinski won 8­5 over Lia Jackson and Marine Piriou at No. 2. 
After falling behind 3-2, Notre Dame salvaged a split of the sin­gles when Dasso outlasted Nasser 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 (9-7) at No. 1 singles in a match that last nearly three hours. Nasser led 4-2 in a seesaw third set before Dasso converted on her seventh break point of the game to trail just 3-4. She then held serve and broke serve again for 5-4 but Nasser broke back with Dasso serving for the match at 5-4. After both players won ser­vice games to send the set into a tiebreaker, Dasso built a 5-3 lead. Nasser rallied for 5-5 and saved match points at 5-6 and 6-7 before Dasso converted on her third match point to tie the match after singles. 

The Irish had taken an early lead in singles when Varnum beat Shannon Duffy 6-1, 6-2 at No. 2 singles. Cheng tied the match with a 7-6 (10-8). 6-2 win over Zalinski at No. 3 singles. Cunha -playing in just her sec­ond dual match in 2000 in replace of Guy -won the final live games of the match to beat Lutgert 6-4, 6-4 at No. 6 singles, after Lutgert had handed Cunha two of her three losses in the 1999 fall season. Piriou held off Green 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 at No. 5 sin­gles to tie the match once again at 2-2. Jackson then beat Vaughan 6-3, 7-6 (7-4} at No. 4 singles to give the Wildcats a 3­2 lead before Dasso beat Nasser at No. 1 singles.
