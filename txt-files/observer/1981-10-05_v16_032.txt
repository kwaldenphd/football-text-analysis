An in-depth series on racial tensions in northwes­tern Indiana captured the top award for The Michigan City News­Dispatch in the 1981 Indiana Associated Press Managing Editors Newswriting Contest. The News-Dispatch won the APME "best of All" award for its series titled "Black and White -10 Years Later," which discussed racial problems in the northwestern Indiana city and outlined some of the differences in perceptions of blacks and whites viewing the city's racial situation. The entries were judged by 
the University ofArizona's Department ofjournalism, which said the News-Dispatch series "resulted in several steps taken to improve relations between the races. TheNews-Dispatch can take pride in its public consciousness and its efforts to improve the city by unlocking the doors that could lead to greater social harmony." -AP

First Monday in October 
\ 
The natural proper timidity and delicacy which belollgs to the female sex evidently unfits it for many ofthe occupations ofcivil life. 
The above excerpt is from an optmon written by Supreme CourtJusticeJoseph P. Bradley in Bradwell v. the State ofIllinois. The 1873 decision stipulated that the state of Illinois could bar women from the practice oflaw simply because they were women. 
A Iitle over one hundred years later, a woman takes 
her place on the nation's highest court. How times have 
changed. 
The question existing in the minds of many Americans on this first day ofthe Supreme Court's term is "What can we expect from Madam justice O'Connor?" Given her experience as Arizona Senate Majority Leader, and as a state appellate court judge, one can safely assume that there is little "natural proper timidity" in Sandra O'Connor. 
From the proceedings of the Senate Judiciary Com­
mittee, and from the comments made in the Senate on 
the day ofher confirmation vote, more speculation can 
be made about Justice O'Connor's presence on the na­
tion's highest tribunal. 
Sen. John East (R-N.C.), a 
member of the judiciary 
Committee, referred to Mrs. 
O'Connor as "a conservative 
woman with conservative 
instincts." Mrs. O'Connor 
court. 
This infuriated at least one member of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Jeremiah Denton ( R-Ala. ), who simply voiced "present" during the Committee vote on Mrs. O'Connor's nomination. Sen. Denton told the press that he could not vote to confirm Mrs. O'Connor becuase she would not elaborate on her opinions regarding abortion. 
This reluctance to voice a strong opinion on con­troversial issues is an important part ofMrs. O'Connor's legal philosophy, that judges should interpret the law, 
not establish it. 
In a resume submitted to the Judiciary Committee, Mrs. O'Connor wrote in response to the question of judicial activism: "The Constitution itself establishes the guiding principle ofseparation ofpowers t in its as­signment of legislative power to Congress in Article l, ~xecutive power to the President in Article II, and judi­cial power to the Supreme Court in Article III. This prin­
ciple requires the federal courts scrupulously to avoid making law or engaging in general supervision of ex­ecutive functions." 

Addressing-the Senate on the day of Mrs. O'Connor's confirmation vote, Sen. Strom Thurmond, ( R-N.C. ), chairman of tht: Judiciary Committee, stated that "We sought a person who understands...that federal law is changed by Congress, not by the Court; who under­stands that the Constitution is changed by amendment and not by the court; and who understands that powers not expressly given to the Federal Government by the Constitution are reserved to the States and to the people, not to the Court. InJudge O'Connor we believt: we found such a person." 
Mrs. O'Connor's time in the Arizona Senate and on the State Appellate court contributed to her philosophy of judicial restraint. ln the words of Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa. ), another member of the Judiciary Committee, 
Mrs. O'Connor's "extensive background on the bench and in the legislature puts her in a unique position to say, as she did, that she knows the difference be­tween being a judge and a legislator..." 
Specter also pointed out that Mrs. O'Connor's ex­perience as a state appellate court judge would enable her to more easily distin­guish between the cases that should fall under the State court's jurisdiction, and that ofthe Federal court. 
At one point in the discus­. sion preceding the vote (one could hardly call all of these glowing remarks a debate), Sen. joseph Biden of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary committee, cautioned the Senate that they were "whistling in the graveyard", in an effort to assure themselves of the kind of justice Mrs. 
O'Connor will be. Biden said that while we can base our expectations on Mrs. O'Connor's past experience, only time and individual cases will show the colors of the nation's first Madam Justice. 
Following her 99-0 confirmation vote, Mrs. O'Connor said that her "hope is that ten years from now, after I've been across the street and worked for a 
while, that they (the Senate) will all feel glad that they gave me this wonderful vote." Today the speculation ends, and the Supreme Court gets down to business. 
Contrary to what justice Bradley thought, we can be sure that Mrs. O'Connor is indeed fit for her civil oc­cupation. The passage oftime will tell us how fit.

Council members, Becker ex­plains, "aren't selected for demographic balance" but rather for their diversity in age, geographical placement, alumnae ties to Saint Mary's (some are alumnae, some are not) and different fields of en­terprise. 
Appointed by SMC PresidentJohn 
M. Duggan, recommendations for council members come from faculty and students. "A variety of people arc interviewed," Becker states. Once: appointed, Council members can serve until two years after their daughter has left SMC. 
Parents Council members are especially hc:lpful to SMC's admis­sions department, recommending good "feeder" schools or spc:citlc students, as well as corresponding with students who are interested. 
Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Car­powicz, St. Louis, Mo., arc chair­couple: for the 1981-1982 school year. After five years as a Parents Council member, Mrs. Carpowicz sees her role as a Council member as being able make the College aware of parental concerns. "We have in­put back to the administration. We're the link between parents and t;Ie administration." 
She also cites the new library, ac­creditation of the nursing program (which the program now has), career counciling and other student affairs as issues Parents Council members have discussed in past years. This session, Council mem­
bers received presentations on stu­dent affairs, athlc:tic policies, financial aid policies and campus ministry in addition to their commit­tee work 
In their fourth year as Parents Council members, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Vite, Elkhart, Ind., view them­selves, as well as other members of the Council, as "self-thinkers" who are "more of an arm or liason" be­tween the Board of Regents and the College:.

Hunger strike aftermath 
Britain pledges prison reforms 
BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -Britain's top official in Northern Ireland pledged yesterday to imple­ment prison reforms for all inmates now that jailed Irish nationalists have ended their hunger strike. 
"There are certain reforms which can be introduced. We will now try to see what we can do about them," Northern Ireland Secretary James Prior told reporters before depart­ing for Belfast from Norwich in east­ern England. 
The violence-torn province was reported quiet. Police reinforce­ments were called up in Londonder­ry, Ulster's second largest city, where about 1,500 mostly Roman Catholic supporters of the hunger strike and 200 followers ofthe hard­line Protestant leader, the Rev. Ian Paisley, staged demonstrations in

separate parts of the city. No inci­
dents were reported. 
At Belfast's City Hall, about 300 Protestants and Catholics gathered for the annual co-denominational "Witness for Peace" service, carry­ing small white crosses in memory of the more than 2,000 victims of Northern Ireland's 12 years of sec­tarian violence. 
Prior, after arriving in Belfast, con­ferred with top prison officials at the British administrative headquarters at Stormont Castle. Sources said the officials were studying recom­'!lendations for changes in prison reguiations proposed by an Interna­tional Red Cross delegation that at­tempted to mediate an end to the hunger strike inJuly. 
Ten Irish nationalists, most of them members ofthe outlawed Irish Republican Army, starved them­selves to death at Belfast's Maze prison during the seven-month protest that ended Saturday when the six remaining strikers ended their fasts.

Corrigan speaks on CF A 
ELKHART, Ind. (AP) -Self­government, not television money, was the real motive behind the formation ofthe College Football As­sociation, Notre Dame Athletic Director Gene Corrigan told a meeting of the Indiana Associated Press Managing Editors yesterday. 
"What we in the CFA are seeking is control of our own programs, not the death of the NCAA," Corrigan told the group. 
"The NCAA has told schools playing major college football, 'You don't have control over anything un­less we say you have.' I find that very disturbing.'' 
............................................................!.. 
Rocco's Hair Styling ; 531 N. Michigan St.,i South Bend Phone-233-4957

The CFA's 61-school membership 
includes all major independent col­
leges playing Division I football, as 
well as members of the Big Eight, 
Southeast, Southwest, Western Ath­
letic and Atlantic Coast conferences. 
Two other major conferences, the 
Big Ten and the Pac-1 0, chose not to 
join. 
Corrigan said money has become 
the focus of the media's coverage of 
the NCAA-CFA struggle, and he ad­
mitted, "Ifl were a sports editor, the 
money is what would grab my atten­
tion, too." 
The NCAA-CFA battle came to a 
head last month when the CFA voted 
to accept a $180 million prime time 
television offer from NBC. That pact 
was in conflict with a $213 million 
deal the NCAA struck with ABC and 
CBS. 
"Speaking strictly from Notre Dame's point of view, the money issue is inconsequential," Corriga~ told the Indiana APME. "We won't get any more money from the CFA 
plan than we would from the NCAA plan. Notre Dame has always been fortunate in that we get the maxi­mum number of national television exposures every year. That's not going to change under either plan.~

Instead, Corrigan said, Notre Dame is seeking a revision in rules governing student admissions and recruiting practices. 
"The NCAA took a giant step back­wards when it did away with the 1.6 predicted grade point average re­quirement," he said. "We opened the doors to hundreds ofabuses; ath­letes enrolled in colleges who couldn't even read or write. 
. .:'That's why we had the transcript problems we had at several West Coast schools last year. That's why only 40 percent of pur student ath­letes graduate with a degree on time. It has given college athletics a black eye. It's not fair to the schools, and it's certainly not fair to the stu­dents." 
Corrigan said the CFA's television package has forced the NCAA to lis­ten to some of the group's more im­portant issues. "We have a meeting with the NCAA on reorganization in December," he said. 
"There is no reason why the problems can't be worked out. I would hate to see us ( CFA) get out of the NCAA," he added. "It's been a good organization. It can still be a good organization. It just needs to update a little of its thinking."

Against Spartans 

Irish offense gets on track 
By KELLY SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 

Saturday's Notre Dame-Michigan State game was only three seconds old, but it was already his~ory as far as tackle Phil Pozderac was con­cerned. 
"I knew from the beginning, from 
the first play, that we had the game 
under control," he said after the 
Spartans' fumbled on their own 23­
yard line. Kevin Griffith recovered, 
setting the stage for Notre Dame's 
first touchdown, and their first win 
in two weeks, 20-7. "That kind of 
play can devastate a team. It took the 
air right out ofthem." 

Muddy Waters offered no argu­
ment there. "It was a simple dive 
play, designed just to get everybody 
loose," explained MSU's coach, "but 
it turned out to be a bomb that ex­
ploded in our faces." 

And the Irish were happy to be the 
ones dropping the bombs for a 
change. "It's about time we got a 
break like that," said quarterback 
Tim KoegeL "We didn't get many 
turnovers handed to us these past 
few weeks. Anytime we can turn a 
fumble into a touchdown it's 
demoralizing for the other team." 

'I knew from the first 
play, we had the game 
under control ' 

.. 
Capitalizing on the Spartan let­down, the Irish struck quickly, put­ting a pair of touchdowns on the board before MSU had time 'to recuperate. And Notre Dame's defense countered with an equally enthusiastic performance, badger­ing quarterbacks John Leister and Bryan Clark, and holding MSU's ground attack to just 21 yards in 27 attempts. 
.. 
"I don't want to sit down," stated Waters during his post-game con­ference. "I've been knocked on my butt all afternoon. I'm not faulting anyone on our team, they tried hard. But we were outplayed. Our big problem today was Notre Dame. 
They got sky-high with the fumble recovery, and it was a disaster." 
What proved most disasterous for the Spartans, however, was the run­ning of Irish tailback Greg Bell. The sophomore accounted for both of Notre Dame's touchdowns while picking up 165 yards o t n the ground. He suffered a slight hip-pointer in the second half, and left the game early but his work had already been done by then. 
'Tm always ready t to play," said the Columbus, Ohio native, who went in when Phil Carter sprained his ankle. "The coaches believe in me, and I've got plenty of con­fidence in myself. I know I can do the job when they call on me." 
... 
And Bell knows his blockers can do the job, too. "Our line played great today," he continued. "All I had to do was run. Anyone could have gotten through those holes." 
The holes weren't all that opened up Saturday. Irish coach Gerry Faust opened up his offense a little more, too, and his team responded with back-to-back scoring drives on its first two possessions, the first, capped by a one yard Bell run, and the second, a 32-yard gallop up the middle. 
"We played pretty wide-open football until the fourth quarter," Faust stated. "Michigan State didn't know what we were doing from one . play to the next -we had them in that turmoil." 
"But when Greg got hurt, we went to a more ball-control offense," con­tinued Faust. "We were without our top two tailbacks, and that cut down our outside speed, so we adjusted 
the play calling a bit." 
Faust's play calling was on target 
for most of the afternoon. Although 
Notre Dame found the endzone only 
two times, they piled up 394 net 
yards on offense. 
"I think we moved the ball better 
today than we have the past two 
weeks," offered KoegeL "We're get­
ting better every game. We es­
tablished a ground game today too, 
and that allowed us to open things 
up." 
Koegel, 7-of-15 for 72 yards, was not sacked. "The offensive line is blocking more efficiently now," he praised. "Their protection was ter­rific." But Faust did yank the senior at one point in the game. 
"I don't want to take a kid out after one mistake, but we weren't moving after a few series' and Tim wasn't seeing his open receivers," ex­plained Faust. "He missed some passes he should have connected 
on." 
Blair Kid's action was brief, after 
he threw two interceptions in four 
attempts. It was Michigan State who 
made a permanent quarterback 
change, late in the first half. An inef­
fective Leister was replaced by 
Bryan Clark, who gave the Spartans 
new life when he threw a 63-yard 
touchdown bomb to Daryl Turner 
that cut the margin 14-7. 
"I really fooled them on that play," :.:marked Turner. "They couldn't handle my speed because their defensive backs aren't that fast." 
Irish secondary coach Jim johnson explained it differently. "It was a case of misjudged speed, real­ly," he said. "Chris (Brown) was on the receiver, he thought he had him covered, but he let his man get away for a second and he couldn't catch up. We lose a lot ofexperience with (John) Krimm out, but Chris is com­ing along real well. He's a fine defensive back" 
What really came along for Notre 
Dame was their pass rush. 
"Phenomenal is the only word I can 
use for the line's play today," com­
plimented linebacker Mark Zavag­
nin. "We had a lot ofpeople going to 
the ball, and (Joe) Gramke, (Jon) 
Autry and (Tim) Marshall especially 
did a super job." 
Linebacker Bob Crable had a team 
high 13 tackles, while Zavagnin and 
Gramke had eight and seven. Autry 
accounted for a 22-yard loss with his 
quarterback sack. "We've been 
working hard on our rush," said co­
captain Crable. "The contain broke 
down once in a while, but basically, 
everyone took care o( their respon­
sibility." 
Michigan State's score right 
before the intermission put some 
pressure on the Irish defense. "They 
gave us a real scare," admitted 
Zavagnin. "We were afraid they 
were getting the momentum." 
But Notre Dame didn't panic. 
Taking the ball about a minute 
before halftime, the Irish put togeth­
er an impressive drive ending with a 
Harry Oliver 38-yard field goal. 
"It's been a while since I kicked a 
good one," said Oliver, 0-2 before 
Saturday. "After the first four games 
last year I had about ten, so it feels 
good to get one under my belt." 
Oliver added a 34-yard boot in the third period. The Spartans threatened only one other time, on a pass play early in the fourth quarter. Clark hit Ted Jones in the endzone, but the split end came down out of bounds. 
"Mistakes are beating us almost as much as the other team," said Clark, who came off the bench and passed for 161 yards. "That play right there was what did us in. It would have been 20-14 ifI hadn't thrown it so far outside." 
"The coaches had us ready for all of Notre Dame's motion," noted Spartan linebacker George Cooper. "There were no surprises today. They just beat us. They wanted it 
.more."

ND, EMU share lead in Irish Invitational

Coach inspires win 
Irish 1Win one for Faust' 
By KELLY SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame established some statisical season highs · Saturday with its 394 yard offense mark, its 300 yard 
rushing effort and its 21 first downs. But there was one 
record the Irish fought desperately not to break. 
Gerry Faust had never, in his entire coaching career, 
lost three games in row. He denied feeling extra 
pressure because ofit. ­
"I don't ever think about things like thaL," he said af­
ter the game, "but I did have my ticket to China ready, 
just in case." 
His players were well aware of the licking Faust was 
taking for the team's 1-2 start. They didn't think it was 
fair. 
"We're the ones doing the throwing, the running, the 
blocking," said quarterback Tim Koegel. "He shouldn't 
be blamed for our performance." 
"We realized that Coach Faust has been taking a lot of 
criticism," explained running back Greg Bell. "All the 
pressure has been comingdown on his head, but it's not 
his fault-we're the ones out there playing. We know 
what his system can do and we know it can work." 
So the Irish decided to prove it to their coach. "We 
dedicated this game to him," added Bell. "We played 
with everything we had to." 
"This was an emotional game for us," offered senior 
captain Tony Belden. "We didn't like the way Coach 
Faust was bdng treated this week. We played with our 
hearts, and that's how we're going to have to keep 
playing." 
"He didn't want us to do that, either," added Harry 
Oliver, 2-2 on field goals Saturday. "He told us we 
should dedicate ~he game and the whole season to our­selves.· 
But Faust surely appreciated their support. "It's been a tough two weeks," he admitted. "But the team, the student body, the alumni have bent over backwards to give me encouragement. The backing has been un­believable." 
While his players hope Saturday's win will silence some critics, Faust realizes he'll never please everyone. He made an unpopular decision late in the game. With : 18 seconds remaining, Faust played it close to the vest rather than going for another score. 
"We're not out there to beat point spreads," he stated. "If people want to bet on the game, that's their problem. We just want a win, even if it's only by a point. I'd sure have taken a 14-13 win last week." 
This week, the Irish worked hard to restore faith in one another. Practices, according to the coaches, were the best and most intense of the year. The blocking as­signments, the new techniques, according to players, were becoming more familiar each day. "We're starting to gel," they said, "it just takes time." 
Faced with a do-or-die situation, they passed their first test of the new season Saturday. "Today was the turnaround," explained linebacker Mark Zavagnin. "It was a must game. We wanted to prove what Coach said about being the year's comeback team. We've got to keep things rolling, though, because we've got two tough games (Florida St. and Southern Cal) ahead." 
"Coach Faust has treated everyone great," added Koegel. We didn't want him to think he's let people down. We had to get back on track today. We were either going to get together and regroup or just die. This was the biggame for the rest ofthe year. We've got too much talent to let things slide." 
and St. Mary's College, participating in the two-day competition. 
The remaining five are Eastern Michigan, Central Michigan, Ferris State, Marquette and Western Michi­gan. The competition is round robin format, with each team facing three other teams both days. At the con­clusion of first day matches, EMU and Notre Dame were deadlocked in first place. 
The Irish women upped its team record to 12-1 in dual matches with three impressive victories. Notre Dame defeated CMU 6-0 to begin the day, and then lodged wins over Western Michigan ( 4-2) and Mar­
quette ( 6-0). 
There were numerous bright spots individually for the Notre Dame. Senior Carol Shukis, the num­ber three singks player, and fresh­man Lisa Gleason, at number f t our, each won all three of their matches. Senior Pam Fischette and sopho­more Tina Stephen, playing number one doubles, wqe undefeated in yesterday's competition as was the freshman combination of Laura Lee and Camille Cooper at number two doubles. 
The Belles of Saint Mary's ended their day with one win and two losses. SMC beat Marquette 4-2 for the only victory ofthe day. They lost to EMU (6-0) and Ferris State ( 4-2 ). 
·Their dual match record now stands at 5-4. The first doubles team ofShel­ly Seamon and Nancy Golding distin­guished themselves by winning two oftheir thrQf matches. 
Matches will begin at 9 a.m. today at the Courtney Tennis Center. The two-day tournament will conclude this afternoon.
