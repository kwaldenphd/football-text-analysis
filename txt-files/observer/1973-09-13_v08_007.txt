Bike registration announced 
by Howard Wood 
Staff Reporter 

An increasing number of stolen bicycles has generated a strong student interest in the first day of bicycle registration. Chris Singleton, a senior in charge of registration procedures, stated, ':' People are realizing the dangers and problems of owning bikes. They are spending a lot of money for them and are taking every precautionary method of protection. such as locks and 
registration." 
Singleton noted that 40 bikes have been recovered by campus security. These recovered bikes remain unclaimed because the owners do not know their serial number. Singleton hopes this situation can be prevented in the future if owners register their 
bikes. 
"There is no need for mandatory registration but full cooperation from the students is necessary to make registration a success," emphasized Singleton. 
Registration could provide an excellent protection against thieves, Stolen bikes could not b'e sold on campus or pav:ned because would be registered again and records would be cross-checked. 
Students wishing to register their bikes may do so between 2:30 and 5 p.m. Thursday and Friday in LaFortune. Student Center and 5 to 6 p.m. on the same two days in the dining halls. 
To register a bike this week, a student should bring the serial number, color, priced, manufacturer, year, and any distingushing features to the booths in LaFortune and the dining halls. Students need not bring the bike itself if they bring this in­formation. 
Singleton added that if a bike does not have a serial number, please bring it to the security office for stamping next Tuesday, Sept. 18.

Carney a success 
· Whatever.Jhe Age, I J I 
by Patrick Hanifin Staff Reporter 
The Carney '73 games and Frisbee Fly-in yesterday evening on the South Quad were a well appreciated success thanks to four months planning and an intensive week's work by the Orientation Committee and the Student Government. 
vrientation Co-Chairman Daniel Schipp and David Caruso and their cc>mmittee provided a number of game booths in addition to the plentiful food and music. Students could toss bean bags, nerfballs, footballs. darts and rings to win such prizes as hats, burgers and frisbees. 
The event which drew the biggest crowds was the Frisbee Contest. Students competed in two 
No decr~21ase 
is expected at Nickie's 
by Ken Bradford Staff Reportt>r 
Despite last year's highly publicized raid and increased competion, Nick, owner of "Nickie's", expects no decrease inn business this vear. 
"Competition ts good for the consumer and ultimately good for the retailer," said Nick, who declined to give his last name. He stated that there is more than enough business to go around and that the student is entitled to have a choice. 
He added that it is too early to tell what effect the opening of a new bar, "The Library," will have, but pointed to improvements in his business, including new lunch services. 
Regarding last year's raid in whch several Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students were arrested, Nick expressed his 
belief that the story may have been distorted in last year's papers. 
"Minors were not let into "Nickie's", Nick stated. He ex­plained that all ID's were checked and that everyone admitted to the bar possessed cards identifying 

themas being of legal drinking age. After the raid, twenty ID cards were found discarded under the tables in the bar. 
He also argued that the raid was ordered by a city official with the intent of harrassing Notre Dame students and himself. The illegal raid took place after police and students exchanged words outside the bar, he added. 
"Nickie's" is located about a mile from campus on Eddy Street. 


individual events, Accuracy and Distance, and in the Guts Frisbee team event. Thomas Parseghian won the first event for throwing a frisbee through a hoop fifty feet away and Joseph Essman took the Distance award. They, and the Notre Dame Guts Frisbee Team, will compete Sept. 30 at the Nor­thern Indiana Intercollegiate Frisbee Fly-in at South Bend. Winners there will perhaps compete in the International contest next year inMichigan. 
Tim McNerney of WRBR who arranged the events said that he hoped that the Northern Indiana Contest would be attended by groups from SMC, UIUSB, and Bethal College as well as Notre Dame. "I'm really pleased at Notre Dame's turnout," he said, "And I expect they will do well."

Now To Work 
Carney '73 showed a lot yesterday. In particular, it showed that student government here can really serve as a vibrant force bringing together the people of this campus. A great deal of respect has to be given to Dan Schipp, Dave Caruso and their hardy band of dedicated workers who have devoted themselves to Freshman Orientation and the Carnival, among other things. Their tireless efforts produced a really magnificent evening at Notre Dame. 
But in many respects, the fun is over. The hope remains that student govern­ment can continue to produce these great activities, but now they must get down to the more serious task of supportng and protecting student's rights and causes at ND. 
This kind of work is perhaps the most unglamorous of all student government activities, but it is work that H-Man and associates must continue. They have devoted a lot of their time to it already this year, butthere are ·some areas into which they must delve. 
In particular, Student Government must work now in conjunction with Fr. James Shilts to form a viable, strong l'enants Union. The purpose behind the union would be to protect the interests of Notre Dame students seeking housing in the area. 
As it stands now, off-campus students are subject to the profiteering and racist whims of landlords and ladies. A fledgling Tenants Union could not wield a very large stick (unless the University put their clout behind it), but as it grows and becomes more established, hopefully it will prove an effective force in th<: interrest of these students. 
The Challenge confronts student government. They can provide a good time, they have shown they dan provide good student services. Their chore is to now take the charisma that they have generated and move it in construction areas-to give the campus a sense of dir­ection, to give the students a feel of leadership, to strive to form a cohesive campus. If they can do all these in­tangibles, then student government at 
Notre  Dame can  really claim  to  have  
done it alL

And the kitchen window--we had our choice of permanently up or permanently down until the new one arrives. And all those little holes in the screen have given us a fantastic collection of flies and bugs. 
The front door has two locks, but it really isn't as safe as it would seem. We only have the key to on~. and the ott;,.. one is the lock that keeps working. We will be in real t...'luble if the landlord ever fixes the lock on the back door so that wecan't sneak in anymore. 
But even our landlord's goofs are small in comparison to some of ours. Last Saturday we figured we would beat the high price of beef by buying a whole lot of ground round before the freeze ended. Forty pounds to be exact. Then in Monday's paper (another brilliant idea to save money--you know, watch for spedals) we read that beef prices went down after the ceiling was lifted. 
I hope you miss this issue, Mom. 
Our shopping trip to K-Mart was almost as bad. What do four guys who have lived on Dining Hall meals for three years know about buying food? Not much, it turns out. We came home with ingredients for all kinds of things we didn't know how to cook anyway. <We were praying that Beth and Patti would.). ' 
Frank has been a fantastic interior decorator; our walls are covered with a Pick-and-Pay masterpieces. We identified one the other night, but the others have still got us wondering. <Actually, we wonder about all of them.) Ou:-choice of rooms was really bad. I like my room cold in the winter, and Frank likes has warm I hardly need to tell you that I have the only room with a hea~ing rluct. 
And Mom, I live with a bunch of moral dege.J!'rates. John and Harry have a running fued over who's fao.ner is the more crooked car dealer. 
At the beginning of the summer, mom taught me a lot about doing laundry, but I feign ignoracne-~I told l'leth that she has to give-me laundry lessons. And of course something always pops up so that it's easier for her to do it alone "this time" "This is the last time!" she keeps telling me. Who says living off campus isn't hard work? 
Of course, this story wouldn't be complete without mention of the neighbors--they must figure that we're setting up the Hill Street junk yard in our back yard. 
With all of our really fine automobiles, we have had a ca ·up on jacks in the backyard everyday this week. One of them, fondly dubbed · "Zoom" because of what its lost, belongs to my ex-roomie Kenny. He 
-left me a note after he worked on zoom Tuesday: "The part I replaced works really well. Only it wasn't the rigtJt piece, so I'll be back tomorrow to try again." 
Dear Editor: 

For what it's worth, we'd like to put our two bits in about the new Saga management at SMC. After checking the Saga letter of August 'l:l, which verified meal schedules for the students and stated 
that the new management team hoped that the coming year would be an en­joyable one for all, we strode up to the dining hall steps at exactly 6:02 p.m., confident that Saga management meant it when they wrote that Sunday dinner ended at 6:15. As we entered, an arm (which, we later learned, belonged to Mr. Tom Novak, new assistant manager) was thrust abruptly in front of us, and a gruff voice barked, "Dinner over at 6:00." "But your schedule said 6:15", we protested. "6:00", he repeated curtly. "Well, you'd better change your literature," we replied as we turned away. His only reply was a negative nod. 
We are not protesting the shortening of meal hours, although we feel Saga should have the courtesy to notify in advance the students it serves. What prompted this letter was the rude and immature behavior of Mr. Novak--it looks as if he will have a long way to go to achieve repoire with SMC students.

Student governtnent reorganized 
by Denise Crowley Staff Rt>porter 
Last vear. Student Government reorganized its structure to im­prove efficiency. The main reorganization involved the abolition of the Student Senate and the establishment of a board of ('omissioners. 
The Board of Commissioners has the power to allocate funds, determine the policie!' of Student 
Government.  regulate  all  the  
t>lctions  and  approve  judicial  
appointments.  

The six representatives from theelectiondistricts. along with the Chairman of the Hall Presidents' Council. Frl'rl Baranowski, Student Bodv President. Dennis CH-Manl Etienne. and student Body Vice President. Michael Geisinger, compose the Board of Com­missioners. l<"".:ach member of the Board is also a member of the Student Life Council. H-Man ex­plained that the Board will have the ultimate say in all Student Government policies. 

Rober Kincaid represents the undergraduate off-campus students. Mike Hess is the representative from Stanford , Keenan Zahm, Holy Cros.s, St. Joe· and Moreau. Grace and Flanner are represented by Edward Rahill and Sorin, Walsli, Alumni, Badin and Dillon are represented by Mary Bremer. 
A district 2,comoosedof Farley, Breen-Phillips, Cavana.ugh and St. Ed's will be appointed soon. 
Bob Connolly, the representative from Fishcer, Pangborn. Lyons and Morrissey, hopes that the Board will be a "sounding board" for the student opinion and a means of communication between Student Government and the 
faculty and administration. The first meeting of the Board of 
Commissioners is Thursday at 8:30 in the Student Government offices. The agenda will include a discussion of the student manual revision and some of the goals of the Board. 
The board of Commissioners supervises a wide range of 
executive officers. Jim Roe is Administrative Advisor, newly created cabinet post. Fred Antc­zak is Minister of Student Affairs; Chris Netto, Academic com­missioner: Dave Grimmer, Judicial Coordination; and Bill McLean. Director of the Om­hudsman. Mariclare Molidor is Commissioner of Research and Development, which is being renamed. Bill Borders is researching the drinking age laws. 

Students urged to stay in stands 
by Claurlt> Devaney Staff Rea·pter 

In a letter addressed "To Our Loyal Student Body .. , " Athletic Director Edward Krause and the department of athletics are urging all students to remain in the stands during the· halftime of home football garr.es. 
The Jetter. released in con­junction with the issurance of student football tickets, is an appeal to students toend the half­time practice of swarming onto the field which began with the ND-LSU game of 1970. 
According to the Krause letter th~ halftime swarm has turned from being an inspirational act into "a mob scene." which has had an adverse effect on the field and on the vews of sme alumni towards the students. 
In an interview Assitant Athletic 
Director Colonel John Stephens said that nothing furthzr had been planned on the rna tter. He said that he hoped this kind of an informal appeal to the student would work. Although it was not meant to 

be any kind of warning or show of disfavor, Stephens hoped the students would cooperate. 
Stephens said that a sure way of keeping students off the field would be to ring it with ushers and police. But something like that would not be planned, necessary, or wanted. 
Several reasons were given as to why the letter was written. Stephens stated that increased alumni criticism of student behavior was one reason.The fact that attention was directed away from the band in practically every game was another reason. Probably the most emphasized reason for the letter was that field conditions were worsened by the · great amount of tratfic. 
Director of Stadium Main­tenance Harold Bennir1ghoff took a negative view of the students' actions solely frm the point of view of what it did to the field. 
Roughtly only three months are available for him to get the field into good condition. This is com­paratively very little time to get the field into the kind 
of shape people expect. 
Benninghoff pointed out thatthe more activity there was on the field the harder it was to keep in shape. After all, he said, it's ·mly grass that all those people are walking on. 
The Jetter was not meant be any kind of ultimatum or attack on the student body, but rather an at­tempt to be a a reminder to the students to examine the situation to determine whether their half­time actions have deteriorated 
into something less than  spontan­ 
eous,  inspirational  act  for  the  
football team.

Conklin noted that the university name and seal are protected by a court decision but added that the magazine does not use the official school title . 

The ad depicts only a priest in a campus-type setting and the words ·Notre Dame" along with the names of two other universities. As Conklin pointed out, there are a lot of schools called Notre Dame, making the link between the name and the university hard to establish. 
Paul Foley, Presiden· : the Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., and a Notre Dame trustee, is conducting the investigation. His intention is first to locate the agency which placed the ad and ask them to discontinue its publication. Later steps are uncertain.

Student, faculty, and ad­ministrative use or the · Univer­sity's computer facilities is ex­pected to increase again this year, said R. 'Brian Walsh, director of the Computing Center. 
The use of the computer as a supplemental aid to classroom material is one of the reasons for the expected increase, he said, as a $225,000 grant for computer research to the Department of Economics explores more uses for the computer in the educational process. 
/ ' 
Refert'ing to l.he computer':; possibilities in education, Walsh stated, "Computing is still in its infancy and its greatest impact is yet to be felt." 
Use of the computer may take many forms, he continued. Last year, 99 courses at Notre Dame required 2,824 students to use the computer. , Students used the computer for diagnosing illnesses, analyzing statistics, or playing a scholarly game of Tic-tac-toe, he said. 

The computer, an IBM 370-158, is located in the Computer Center and Mathematics Building and has 63 terminals scattered in various buildingings on campus, including O'Shaughnessy Hall, the Memorial Library, and the Hayes-Healy Building. The computer is used twenty-four hours a day and runs at its capacity for over half that time. ' 
"We don't see too many students here at three o'clock in the mor­ning," Mr. Walsh adds. 
Since computers are expensive and become obsolete a few years after their introduction, Notre to Notre Dame. He says the magazine tries to remain flexible 
.andthat it would like to get more students involved. But he is not surprised there has been little reaction from the students as it is an alumni magazine. Free copies are available, though, to anyone who comes to the office, and Parent says more and more students are coming in. 
1\otre Dame magazine began about a year and a half ago when the publications Insight, "a public; relations 1tool," and Alumnus, a small magazine devoted mainly to alumni news, were merged. Combinging the two was designed to save $25,000 in costs. 
"We wanted to get production costs down," said Parent, "but we also wanted to produce a good magazine." He said that Notre Dame is affected by the present paper shortage, but enough is on hand to last through the school year. 
The reactions fromalumni, other alumni editors, and commercial editors have been good, he says. Parent feels that for the alumni Notre Dame is "an extension of their education here."

To be successful, a soccer club must be built on stingy defense. Indiana and Notre Dame face Although there are still some holes each other at 4:00 Friday on the to fill. the Notre Dame "D" should field behind Stepan Center. 
"It's a game of inches," they say, with a frequency 
that's sometimes maddening. 
Never mind that the "game" is football in one in­stance, hockey in a second, and basketball in a third. l' s all thr same to sport's cliche artists, whether in Boston, Sault Ste. Marie, or at Notre Dame, and to them every game is a "game of inches." 
The funny thing is, they're right when they say it 
For during the past eight years, Notre Dame fans have learned just how great a distance an inch can be. The last Irish team to win a National Cham­pionship was the 1966 football squad, a team which went 9-0-1, and drubbed Southern Cal. 51-0, in the last game of its season. 
Since then, the cupboard has been bare, but were it not for a few inches here and there,Notre Dame might well have been the nation's dominant power in college athletics during the past decade. 
An inch either way. and some of the major sports events of the past few years, instead of ending up as Irish setbacks, may have looked like this: 
SOUTH BEND, Ind., Ocotber 18, 1969: Notre Dame's Fighting Irish, a young football team with a reed-thin quarterback and a chunky, heavy set place­ki<'ker, today stunned the Trojans of Southern California, 17-14, in one of the major upsets of the current college football season. 
The Irish began their fame-winning surge with just over two minutes remaining in the fourth period, when quarterback Joe Theismann started his team on a 60-yard drive. Theismann seemed destined for the hero's laurels himself when, on a third-and-four, he scrambled from the Trojan 30 all the way to th 14­yard line. Bu a clipping penalty returned the ball to the USCV 40, and the Irish, two plays later, lined up for a 48-yard field goal try. 
Placekicker Scott Hempel made good on his at­tempt, only barely. Hempel's 48-yard fungo shot fell precisely on the crossbar of Notre Stadium's north goalposts, and then caromed through the uprights for the winning points. 
"I didn't think it was going to make it," said llempd. "I thought it was going to hit an air pocket, or something. An inch shorter, and I'm sure it would have bounced back onto the field." 
llempe\'s kick did hit the crossbar, but it was just a bit short. The ball bounced but it bounced back onto thP rield, and thetrishhad to settle for a 14-14 tie with the nation's No. 3 team. 
DALLAS, Tex., Jan. 1, 1970: Notre Dame today crushed the Texas' Longhorn's hopes for a national championship and ended the 'Horns' 20-game win­ning string as well, by engineering shocking 17-14 upset in the annual Cotton Bowl Classic. 
The Irish took an early 10-0 lead in the game, which was dominated by the play of both defensive teams, but the Texas Wishbone scored one touchdown before the half and earned another in the third period to go in front, 14-10. 
With 6:52left to play, though, Irish quarterback Joe Theismann scrambled out of the pocket and gunned a 24-yard touchdown pass to flanker Jim Yoder, and Notre Dame was back on top, 17-14. 
But Texas, on a last-minute drive, came within inches of reversing the decision. Quarterback James Street drove the 'Horns' to a fourth-and-three at the Irish six, but this fourth down pass to Cotton Speyer was deflected by corner back Clarence Ellis, and the Irish took over and ran out the clock. 


The pass, of course, was not broken up. Ellis stopped Speyer at the three, but Texas had a first down, and moments later Bill Dale scored the game-winning touchdown. 
SOUTH BEND, Ind., March 10, 1973: Football, 
traditionally, has been the game at the University of 
Notre Dame. But tonight at Notre Dame's Athletic 
and Convocation center, a new game assumed some 
of the glory that had once beenfootball'salone. 
Notre Dame's polished, experienced ice hockey 
team complt>ted Its rise to national prominence this 
cold, dreary evening by topping the nation's top­
ranked team, the Wisconsin Badgers, 4-3 in the 
second game of a two-game set. 
The two teams battled to a 4-4 tie in Friday night's clash. and were deadlocked at three with 2:00 left in the final period of Saturday's encounter, when senior center Paul Regan flipped a high backhand shot past Badger goalie Dick Perkins. 
Stellar goaltending by Mark Kronholm made the Irishgoal stand up during the final seconds, but Irish fans suffered several tense moments just before the game ended, when center John Noble began tussling with a Badger player. Officials separated the two before anything could develop, but Noble came within inches of drawing a critical penalty. 
"Noble pushed at him with his stick," said the WCHA official who separated the two. "He didn't hit him, but he came close...Another inch, and I'd have had to call him for cross-checking." 
Cross-checking is exactly what Noble was called for, with just minutes remaining ina 3-3 hockey game. 
Wisconsin's Dave Pay, moments late·. scored on a power play and the Badgers won, 4-3,and aci\'IIAQeect to the NCAA playoffs. 
NEW YORK, NY, March 25, 1973: Who'd have thought it possible'~That a basketball team which had lost six of its first seven games could come far enough back to win the prestigious National In­vitational Tournament'> 
No one would have given a four-leaf clover,much less a shamrock for Notre Dame's chances in January, but tod~y, in Madison Garden, the Irish completed their stunning comeback by posting a 91-90 overtime victory over Virginia Tech in the finals of the NIT. 
The Irish led throughout the overtime period, but Tech's Bobby Stevens came oh-so-close to givin~ the titleto the equally unheralded Gobblers when hts 15­footer at the buzzer skittered around the rim and then fell off. 
"The shot felt good when I let it go," said Stevens. I 
thought surL it was in. Another inch to this side, and 
maybe I would have had it." 
Ste,·ens, the smallest player on the rloor in last 
year's thrilling title game, knew what he was doing 
wht>n he fired his rinal shot. It swished, and gave 
Virginia Tech a 92-91 victory over the Irish. 
During the '73-'74 school year, Notre Dame will field at least three teams capable of competing for national ranking and prestige. And each of those clubs, on paper, is talented enough to contend for a ~ But winning such a title will demand a highly successful season, and coming close to such a season won't be quitegood8M4111tJh. 
Because whoever said it was right : "It's a game of inches." And this year, perhaps the inches will be on Notre Dame's side of the ledger.
