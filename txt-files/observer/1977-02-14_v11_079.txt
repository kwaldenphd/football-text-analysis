Ken Kesey opens SLF, Tenn. Williams to appear Fri. 
by Greg B. Bangs Executive Editor 

Proclaiming that literature is magic, Ken Kesey opened the 1977 Sophomore Literary Festival before an overflow audience last night in Washington Hall. 
Kesey allocated the majority of his hour-and-a-half long presenta­tion to reading two of his more recent works, "Abdul and Ebenez­er" and "Seven Prayers of Grand­ma Whittier," which will be part of a larger novel entitled The Demon &x. 
"Seven Prayers of Grandma Whittier" is based on Kesey's grandmother whom he labelled "a fierce, rightous woman." "In this piece, I'm looking at literature, Lucifer and the Lord. I'm interest­ed in good and evil, the Oregonian novelist stated. "I'm taking a person of deep faith into the twentieth century arena where faith is being battered continual­ly." 
Although Kesey said he "only wanted to read the first sentence and a few others" of that work, the first ~entence practically took up

the approximate time of twelve minutes needed to read the piece. which was loosely based on an event early in Grandma Whitter's life. 
For his second reading, Kesey offered "Abdul and Ebenezer." a story that appeared in the March 1976 edition of Esquire. In it. Kesey chronicles the life death cycle of two bulls and their rela­tives. 
In between the two readings. Kesey leveled an attack at the fascism he believes is growing in the United States. "It's manifest­ing itself in society. We're losing our grip on civilization -when the big start to decide for the small, then there is fascism." 
"When more than one stick of society gets together, then we're in trouble. Big government. big religion and big business combine and then you see a picture of Nixon, Billy rJraham and Nelson Rockefeller. "That's fascism," he continued. 
Kesey said that i~ is his hate of fascism that will always keep him 'defending the small thing against the big thing." 
Williams to appear Friday 
Sophomore Literary Festival Chairman John Santos announced that playwright Tennessee Williams will appear this Friday. Feb. 18 at 8:00 in Washington Hall. 
Michael Benedikt, who had been scheduled for that time slot will now appear that Friday at 3:30 
p.m. in the Library Auditorium. 
Notre Dame sophomores have been trying to get Williams to speak since its beginning in 1968. In 1975. Williams was s~.;pposed lo appear. but cancelled his appear­ance shortly before the Festival started. · 
Williams won the Pulitzer Prize in 1948 for Streetcar Named Desire and again in 1955 for Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Both of these plays also won the Drama Critics Award, as did Night of the Iguana in 1962. In 1969. · Wiiiiams was awarded the Gold Medal for Literature by the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the National Institute of Arts and Letters.

Dil said he would check with Notre Dame and St. Marv's stu­dents first before making any changes at all. For this reaosn he has set up a student advisory council with members Joe Ehrline. Lorraine Ehrline, Mel Hyde, Mary Venn. Tim Weiler, Tony Mendiola. and Bob Olsen. ­
"Any changes we make will go through this council." Dil said. "They'll be the speakers for our customers. We want to give back what the kids gave us. It's their place. not ours." 
Dil added that. as in the recent past, bartenders will also be stu­dents. 
While Rowley 'Jdmits that he has been involved in Corby's for less than two years. he says he is aware of the tavern's place in the com­munity. He added that most of the 
people in  CTI  have  Notre  Dame  
backgrounds.  
"As far  as  we're  concerned,"  

Rowley said, "Corby's is a Notre Dame and St. Mary's social in­stitution. We don't intend to change that."

Conserving energy 
WASHINGTON [API • Americans could find themselves bathing in form-fitting bathtubs in the near future as the nation seeks ways to conserve tts dwindling energy supply, three energy experts say. 
Supermarkets and throwaway packages may disappear. Houses and cars will be smaller, the experts say. These were some of the ideas three energy conservationists predicted for the future as the nation becomes energy conscious. When the changes will occur, and whether they will be voluntary or by government decree, is less clear, they said in interviews.

Saddler defends Student Union 
In the wake of the controversy over the upcoming Student Union audit, SU Social Commissioner Kevin Saddler advised yesterday that ''students should look closely at what's going on inside the organization." 
Blaming the Student Union's poor financial condition, Saddler charged that the Social Commis­sion is being presured to make a profit from student activities. "We're not a profit organization and we shouldn't be forced to make a profit," he said. 
Saddlercited the Bruce Spring­steen concert trip, scheduled for Wednesday, Feb. 23, as a example of the Social Commission's present inability to "give students a break" 
"N.D. has a difficult time getting big concerts," Saddler said, "and we want to give students the opportunity to see artists when they come to Chicago or Indiana­polis." According to Saddler, though, the price is scaring many students away. The Social Com­mission is selling a package, which includes bus transportation to and from Chicago and a "first class· seat" at the Springsteen concert, for $17.50. 
"It's a good deal," Saddler said, ''but normally we would be able to give students a more reasonable price an_d absorb the loss." 
Saddler stated that · there is a serious lack of communication within the Student Union. He maintained that SU Director Ken Ricci "doesn't have control over things," and called the Union a "shoddy organization". 
"The Social Commission," Sad­dler continued, "should be able to do things for the students without being profit-oriented." 
Students who are interested in attending the Springsteen concert are asked to contact the Student Union ticket office in Lafortune, today or tomorrow. 
Mock Trial not Moot Court

SMC plans learning center to develop student skills 
I ­
by Pat Payne Staff Reporter 

"The naeds of students cannot all be met in the classroom,'' stated Sr. Miriam Patrick Cooney, chair­man of the committee recommend­ing the establishment of a learning skills center at St. Mary's next year. 
''This has been brewing within the faculty for a long time," she continued. "Analytical reading techniques, time management and exam preparation must be learned by students, and the faculty just doesn't have the time to do it," Cooney added. 
Cooney, who is chairman of the math department, pointed out that the student whould be able to allocate her time so one aspect of college life won't interfere with another. She noted that this poses a particular problem for freshmen, many of whom cannot write a research paper nor properly use the library. 
The purpose of a learning skills center, according to Cooney, would be to identify the greatest needs of St. Mary's students, get the stu­dents to realize their own needs, and respond to these needs with learn­ing and assertiveness workshops. psychological counseling and peer tutoring. 
"We have to be honest enough to say these deficiencies exist and then do something about them,'' she said. 
"Perhaps the plan would be to extend the services currently being employed in the freshman writing clinic," noted Cooney.

Ski Iowa? 

"Ski Iowa" is no longer a laughing matter. . 
Cross-country ski trails have been cut in a couple of state forests in Iowa, putting the lie to those humorous T -shirts and posters emblazoned with a picture of a forlorn skier in the middle of a cornfield. The Iowa trail systems 
\ also point to the spread of ski touring, unquestionable the fastest growing aspect of skiing. Cross-country -Nordic -XC ­
She emphasized that these de­ficiencies were what prompted the survey recently sent to all members of the faculty, administration and student body. "We need to know how the students assess their needs as compared to the faculty's thoughts on them," Cooney said. 
Citing three specific reasons explaining the current need for the center, Cooney stated, "The col­lege has expanded, students have changed and they're not as pre­pared for college as they used to be." She added, "The admissions office does a good job in getting prepared students, but some get here with handicaps that aren't identified right away. You know what the problem is, but don't know where to send her, or how to tell her to send herself." 
Valuable Service 

·Commenting on particular faculty needs, Cooney remarked that a learning skills center could provide audio-visual material and make-up test adminstering, so faculty time wouldn't be taken up in these ways. Tutorial services would also be available to correct student deficiencies. ''This center will give the faculty a place to send the student for help," she said. 
Cooney explained that the pur­

pose of the committee is to find out 
where services are presently being

implememted and to expand on 
them, for example, in the Career 
Development Center. 
In addition to Cooney, the com­mittee comsists of Mrs. Rosemary Doherty, Dean of Freshmen; Dr. Kathleen Rice, Dean of Students; Nora Hoover, faculty represen­tative; and Mary Beth Roitz, stu­dent representative. 
Similar to programs 
at other schools 

The committee was initiated last spring by President John Duggan, who asked the Academic Affairs Council to work on finding out the greatest student needs here. 
In preparation for a report to be presented at the end of last summer, Cooney visited the Uni­veristy of Texas and Stanford University, who have "the best and oldest study skills centers in the country," according to her. 
She attributes their success to "short, intensive courses held in the evenings and on weekends in the dorms and classrooms, which include faculty involvement in peer tutor training and seminars in · 
behavior modification.'' 
"The success of our program," concluded Cooney, "is dependent on whether the faculty will encour­age students to use the center, and whether the students will seek the services.

P.O. Box Q 
Start by Doing 

Dear Editor: 
If you find a person lying unconscious on a sidewalk, ap­parently sick or injured, you don't start talking to bypassers about the evils of. society or problems of organization of health service facili­ties; you just help that person who is lying in front of you. 
That's what I thought when I read Chuck Kulig's letter in the 9 Feb. Observer. If he had his way we would never do anything until we had an overall plan to cure the world of all evil. We would be paralyzed by the immensity of the world hunger problem. 
The Wednesday evening fast program, as I understand it, does not pretend to be the answer to the problem of uneven sirtribution of food in our world. It is an attempt to respond to an immediate need which many people experience: a need for enough food to survive. While we respond to such im­mediate needs--not instead' of responding to them--we can work on the larger problems of "organi­zation and control in the present distribution system." The latter is certainly important. 
Granted, not everything goes where it should--I have seen the corruption. But the 'rakeoff' is not that great, and what does reach the poor and starving does immense good. (We should recall that the Hunger Coalition has done exten­sive research to find those agencies which most efficiently and equi­tably distribute their funds.) 
The Wednesday night fast is much more than "an expression of part-time piety" or "blatantly superficial". It is not "bereft of any practical value". It is a concrete way of responding to the world hunger situation. It is not sufficient in itself. It will not solve the problem, but it benefits more 
people more concretely than we 
here at Notre Dame might imagine. 
It is a beginning It is a good thing 

we can do while we address the 
equally. important problems of or­
ganization_, control, agricultural 
methods and distribution.

CARE Not Perfect, 
but 


Still Worthwhile 

Dear Editor: 
In reference tJ Mr. Kulig's letter in the Feb. 9 Observer, I find myself in great opposition to his opinions. Kulig seems to have taken a very pessimistic outlook on CARE and other relief agencies. Relating to us his observations of CARE packages being sold on the black market, Kulig implies that criticizing the whole organization is justified. 
Denial of misuses of some CARE is absurd. But then what organiza­tion runs at 100 percent efficiency?

Anyway, it is not CARE that is 
selling the packages on the black 
market, but thieves. Furthermore, 
to think that an organization must 
maintain 100 percent efficiency to 
merit donations is far-fetched. The 
Hunger Coalition has researched 
the agencies it sponsors and finds 
the g<?od that CARE provides far 
o~twe1ghs any perversions of aide 
tnat may exist. · 
Other points Kulig touches upon are the Right To Food Resolution and the~ tdea of a world grain reserve. For clarification the Right To Food Resolution is'not. a pr~posal ot a plan of action but merely Congress articulating its stand on the world food issue. A 
U.S. grain reserve on the other hand is a proposed solution that will hopefully be an example for the rest of the world. 
Lastly, I would have to agree 
with Ku_lig's view that the Ameri­can p_eopt~ have a tende!j.cy to create enemies with their good intentions. I fail to see, however, this in relationship to distribution ·of food and other aid from agencies the Coalition sponsors. These agencies are donating money and food freely according to need--no strings attached. They are not trying to guide the poor to Ameri-

Digging In

WASHINGTON--The Soviet col­
onel came into thesituatioriroom of 
the Kremlin. He was holding in his 
hand a photograph of the United 
States taken from a Russian spy 
satellite. 
"Look, comrades, the Americans 
are digging holes all over the 
country. Why are they digging so 
many holes unless it's for mis­
siles?" 
The Joint Soviet Command stu­
died the satellite map. 
"Is true," said a marshal. "Hole is here, hole is there. No one makes as many holes unless they going to put in launchers. We must speak to the KGB chief for North America immediately.'· 
A button was pushed and Boris X came in. 
''Why,'' a general demanded, "you have not reported United States is digging holes for new missiles to be aimed against U.S. S.R.?" 
'(he KGB man took a look at the satellite photograph. 
''Those are not rocket launcher holes, comrades. Those are pot­holes made by American cars and trucks.'' 
"What are potholes?" another Soviet general demanded. The KGB man said, "In America there is winter, yes?" 
Everyone agreed. 
"In winter," he continued, "there is snow and ice, yes?" ~'Get on with it," the marshal said. 
"To break up ice and snow on roads they put salt on them. Salt not only breaks up ice, it also breaks up road. When road breaks up there is hole. Americans call it pothole," the KGB man said. 
"Why don't Americans fill in potholes?" the marshal demanded. 
"Because there are so many of them it's impossible to fill them all in. Is better to let them stay as holes until municipal elections.'' 
"What are these yellow lights and pieces of wood around these holes: Surely they must be for missiles," a general said. 
"Is not for missiles. Traffic police put up these lights 'to warn people there is a pothole," the KGB man said.

"Why don't they put them up around all the potholes?" a general asked. 
"They don't have enough yellow warning lights." 
"How do they decide which holes to put lights on and which holes not to put lights on?" 
For the first time the KGB chief was nervou-.. "We haven't been able to find out why they choose to put lights on some holes and not others. There doesn't seem to be any pattern to it.'' 
The marshall said, "There must be a reason for it. Americans wouldn't just mark some potholes and not others. Ifthey did that they would wreck their automobiles."

"But," said another general, "suppose they put yellow blinkers on to make us think those potholes are missile sites, when in fact unmarked potholes are real missile launch pads?" 
The KGB man said, "Comrades, as you know I have lived, in America for a long time. It's true that from the air American potholes look like missile pads. But I have driven over them and I assure you that they are rarely more than six feet deep. A car can fall in one, but a missile can't be fired from it. We must not come to conclusion from one satellite photo that Americans are building launching pads all over their highways." / 
"But," said the marshal, slam­ming his fist on the table, ''ho.w can we be sure?"

As most of you know, an w dish machine and system has ecently been installed in the North Dining Hall. The trays are put on a conveyor belt where each person takes silverware, paper or certain dishes off them. The silver and paper people have the most frantic jobs because their items are usually scattered around and are hard to remove quickly and effectively. 
If each student would give about five seconds of their time by putting silver on one side of the tray and paper on the other it would speed things up and be a great help. Thank you for your co­operation and consideratiqn.

100 Years 
of Indiana Art 


Cinema in South Bend By Dauid 0 'Keefe 
Hellavision 
Network Directed by Sidney Lumet Starring Peter Finch, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Ned Beatty 
"After skewering the medical profession in The Hospital, Paddy Chayefski turns his attention to commercial television in Network." Don't let them fool you. Paddy Chayefsky did as much skewering in The Hospital as Goliath did to David. His 1971 film, starring George C. Scott, was a meandering, mundane waste of time and talent as the script bounced fitfully between farce, black humor, and occasion-· al idiocy. It was as confused as it was confusing, and hardly paved the way for future successes. 
Which makes Network so confounding. It well may be that the television industry is much more susceptible to the follies-and-. foibles sort of satire than the medical· profession. But a large part of the film's tremendous success can be attrib).lted to Chayefsky , who demonstrated in this script a new-found salience, leteracy and sophistication. It is his best yet. 
Network is the story of Howard Beale (Peter Finch), a veteran anchorman at the UBS network, whose spirits, and ratings, slip to the point of no return. Informed of his imminent dismissal, Beale takes to the air waves one night and announces to the national audience that he will blow his brains out next Tuesday. 
But Beale is rescued from disgrace by a strange series of inane corporate decisions. 
News Director Max Schumacher (William Holden) wants to let his old friend retire after an apology, but Diana Christensan (Faye Dunaway) has different ideas. She is by far the most carefully drawn character, an independent businesswoman who is something slightly more intense, ob­noxious and dangerous than a knee-jerk liberal. Determined to bring UBS up to par with the other three major networks, she exploits the attendant publicity that Beale's grandstand play has won and turns him into the Messiah of the tube, the champion of the oppressed American and the hero of human individualism. 
Everything goes well for UBS with 
Christensan as Programming Director. 
She develops a series based on the expolits 
of the terrorist Ecumenical Liberation 
Army, and the Howard Beale Show, 
expan<led to an hour, is now the top-rated 
show on television. But Howard goes a bit 
too far and begins directing his diatribes to 
the proposed sale of UBS to an Arab 
conglomerate. Censured by corporate 
head Jenssen (Ned Beatty), Howard re­
verses himself. The rest. especially the 
ending. is the unkindest cut of all. As the 
film builds to the climax. Chayefsky's 
condemning acerbity climbs right with it. 
And in the end. one comes to the 
realization that what is so disconccring is 
not that what he describes io., true. but that 
it very well could be. 
The part of the film's potency that isn't attributed to the words and characters that Chayefsky creates can be credited to the magnificent cast. The late Peter Finch may well earn an Oscar for his performance. It would be unfortunate were the' award ascribed to sentimental voters. because it is richly deserved. Faye Dunaway is superb with a bitch-charactericatiom that she only tinkered with once (Three Days of the Condor) and Holden. Beatty and Robert Duvall. as a corporate type. join Finch and Dunaway in dragging their characters out of the coldrums of charica­ture and infesting their roles with dimen­sion and vigor. 
But the movie ultimately owes all to Chayefsky, who seems to have found himself. His films. like Marty and The Hospital. have always reflected his in­dependent style. But with Network. he finally allows that independence to some to the front without subverting the impact of the story. It is his most provocative and incisive statement yet, a vitality that makes Network not a view. but a vision.

A Great Guitar 
His appearance remindsone of Gordon Lightfoot. His music shows evidence of the influence of Bob Dylan, James Taylor. and Leo Kottke. 
He is.Bob Hardy. and he appeared on Friday evening at the Nazz. From the beginning of his set, it was obvious that Hardy was a master at the art of playing the guitar. This ability contributed to his interpretation of a wide variety of music, ranging from that of Paul Simon to a 16th century classic, (of which Bob delivered a brilliant r<:ndition. playing it not only as a

guitar piece. but also, through maneuver­ing of his instrument, as it would sound on a lute and a harpsichord). 
It seems that Hardy holds a soft spot for pickin' music, and a -smooth picker he is! The guitar takes on life-like characteristics when in Hardy's hands. He also presented easy, mellow ballads, however, that dis­played his musical diversity, and his love of music, in particular the hauntingly beauti­ful acoustic music of the guitar. 
Playing is not Hardy's-only strength. His original compositions show his talent for describing various apsects of his life through his lyrics. One such tune, "Little Girl in Pigtails," is a fine example. It is a story of a little girls who sits looking out the window waiting for Daddy to come home. bob also showed his skill in another area of music with his arrangement of Jesse Colin Young's "Get Together." 
Audience participation is important to Hardy, and everyone joined in on the chorus of "Get Together," as they did on a "ski song." about a man who has some grave misfortunes while skiing. A "ski song" takes a familiar tune, and substi­tutes lyrics, sometimes provocative and risque, dealing with skiing. And hailing from Colorado, Hardy has plenty of experience with this winter sport. 
On the whole. Hardy is a brilliant 
performer. with a pleasant personality. 
which helps his songs go over even better. 
He has a balanced repetoire of music, 
which consists of his own compostions and 
those of others. He is a truly musical 
person. involving himself with all styles 
and aspects of music. He enjoys what he 
does, and seems to get satisfaction out of 
entertaining for others. Tho"e fortunate

One note· about the Nazz. director Bill 
Adams deserves credit for the work he and 
his staff do. in arranging for talent such as 
Bob Hardv to appear on campus. The Nazz 
is a pleasant alternative to the bar triangle. 
and is a plus for the ND-SMC social scene. 
I onl~· hope the efforts of the staff are 
rewarded with continued student support.

Career Day Thursday 
by Honey McHugh 

On Thursday, Feb. 17, 1977, the Saint Mary's Nursing Department and Career Development Center will cosponsor the first annual Nursing Career Day. 
This year marks the first grad­uating class of nursing students who have been enrolled in a program begun in 1973 aided by 
United Way to sponsor internships 
The United Way is offering an 

intern program for people interest­
ed in preparation for a professional 
career in the United Way field. 
Persons with a bachelor's degree 

or equivalent, generally aged 21-30 
are eligible to apply. Evidence of 
high academic standing, leadership 
ability, effective oral and written 
communication skills, career con­
cern and mot;vation must be de­
monstrated. 
Individuals selected as United 

Way Interns begin with an orienta­
tion session at the National head­
quarters in Alexandria, VA imd 
receive on-the-job experience· at 
two different local' United Way 
organizations. 
Upon completion of the year's 

program, interns agree to accept 
employment in a United Way 
organization. 
Students wanting additional in­

formation about the intern program 
can attend a meeting in Room 222 
of the Administration this after­
noon at 4:30 p.m. 
Mansion 
sets limit 
on crowd size 

The era of wall to wall crowds for formals at Tippecanoe Mansion is over. The directors of the historical site are limiting the number of people who can attend functions at any one time. 
"We are concerned about the preservation of the Mansion," said Dea Andrews, special activities coordinator. "Smaller groups will make it much more pleasant, and will be easier on the house." Andrews added that "350 people make it very tight." 
The mansion, site of many Natre Dame formals, was built in 1889. Its 40 rooms and 21 fireplaces show exquisite detail, especially in wood, marble and tile. Materials for construction were imported from around the world. The home formerly belinged to Clement Studebaker, the automobile indus­trialist. 
several government grants. Career Day will provide these students with opportunities to meet em­ployers from the Mid-West and to attain information made available to them through nationwide mail­ing project. 
"I feel that the Nursing Career Day will be beneficial for two reasons," stated Karen E. O'Neil, Director of the Career Develop­ment Center, "The students will be exposed to far more information on job opportunities and the health care representatives will be able to take a good look at St. Mary's students and its program." 
Under this new baccalaureate program, the students must meet college-wide requirements as well as those of the nursing major. A minimum grade .point average of 
2.5 is necessary to be accepted into the department after a student's sophomore year and a similar standing must be maintained until graduation. The program incor­porates both classroom work and field experience in order to allow the students to apply their know­ledge through service to the com­munity. 
Feminist series 

features ND prof 
by Karen Sikorski Staff Reporter 
Sr. Madonna Kolbenschlag, as­

sistant professor of American Stud­
ies, will address the second session 
of the Women and Humanism ser­
ies, sponsored by Indiana Univer­
sity at South Bend (IUSB). She will 
speak on "Feminist Intellectuals: 
What are they saying?" 
The session will be held at 8 p.m., Feb. 26 at the First Unitarian Church, 101 East North Shore ·Drive (corner of N. Michigan St. 
and North Shore), South Bend. 
Kolbenschlag ·will discuss cur­

rent feminist ideas with emphasis 
on psychology and sociology. "I 
will take stock of what feminists are 
saying about relationships between 
men and women, particularly with 
regard to marriage and the fam­
ily," she explained. 
The second theme of the talk will 

be public policy. "It's time the new 
(feminist) ideas began to have an 
effect on public policy," Kolben­
schlag said. "Some current policies 
reinforce modes of behavior which 
are no longer viable in society.'' As. 
an example, she pointed out the 
need for an income tax ''which

Program, ''It wtll essentially ed-~ ucate the recruiters as well as benefit the students." 
When asked to comment on the Career Day, one senior nursing student, Ann Coia, stated, "This will give us the opportunity to see what our prospective employers are looking for and it will expose us to the many different areas of service available to a.nurse." 
The events of the Nursing Career Day include a luncheon in the North Wedge Room, Dining Hall at

They shot 54 percent from the field and had six players in double figures-a statistic that caused Phelps to remark, "That's beautiful."  "He only got four. Duck (Williams) did a great job on him."

Dame Saturday. "We made some bad mistakes on offense in the second half that really cost us," lamented McGuire, the Gamecocks' head coach. "It was our own mistakes that cost us the game. You can't afford to make mistakes against a team that's as strong as Notre Dame." The most unfortunate thing for Carolina was that all their mistakes came at once. With 13 minutes to play in the game and Notre Dame leading 46-44, the Irish went into a fullcourt zone press that forced the Gamecocks into four consecutive  shots in the first half, Williams connected on six of ten in the second half. "My shot just wasn't dropping in the first half,'' he said. "But I figure I'm a good shooter and that my shots are going to drop sooner or later, so I just kept putting it up.'' Dave Batton and Rich Branning each chipped in with 14 markers, while Toby Knight added 12. Bill Paterno hit on seven of eight free throws on way to 11 points and Bruce Flowers had ten points. Flowers led the team in rebound­ing with 11. Batton and Knight had  The Gamecocks employed a 2-3 zone to keep the Notre Dame offense in check during the half. The Irish shot 50 percent in the opening period, mostly from the outside. The win was Notre Dame's seventh in a row, upped their record to 15-5 and brought them closer to what Phelps hopes will be a NCAA bid. "The seven-game winning·streak is indicative of what we have," Phelps said. "We're in good shape for that NCAA bid now. We have a lot going for us."  
turnovers that started the Irish on a 12-2 streak to put the game on ice. "We were never worried about their press," McGuire said. "We expected it, and we were prepared for it." Carolina should have worried about it. After turning the ball over only three times in the first half, the Gamecocks committed eight in the second half-six during the Irish streak. "In the first half we played very conservatively on defense," Notre Dame mentor Digger Phelps said. "We mainly played sequence, man-to-man, zone and then man­to-man in a time sequence. In the second half we went to the press to used the clock and keep them from setting up their offense." Offensively, the Irish didn't fare  eight and seven caroms respec­tively. Notre Dame out-rebounded the Gamecocks 38-27. After leading the nation in rebounding margin last season with a 12.2 per game rebounding advantage, the Irish are once again leading the land in this statistic. In the latest NCAA statistics, Notre Dame is out­rebounding opponents by an iden­tical edge of 12.2 Karlton Hilton and Jim Graziano took the scoring honors for Carolina with 17 points apiece. Nate Davis added 13. Hilton hit on eight of ten field goal attempts, but Davis could only manage to make six of his 18 shots. Carolina's floor general, Jackie Gilloon, was held to four points. ''Gilloon is capable of scoring 20-25 points a game," Phelps observed.  McGuire agreed. "They're a very strong team and they're a strong contender for an NCAA bid," he remarked. "I wouldn't be surprised to see them win a regional." Carolina fell to 11-11 on the season. The Irish face Butler tonight in the ACC at 8, as they try to extend their winning streak. "We're play­ing great ball right now, the way we were at the beginning of the season before we lost Ray Martin," Phelps said. "We've made the adjustments that we've had to since then and we're really tough." "The students have been great,'' he continued. ''A lot of our success is due to them. We really appreciate their support."
