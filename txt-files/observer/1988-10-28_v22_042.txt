This letter, from a man named King -----from Miami, was sent to The Observer with a chal­lenge scrawled in red marker across the top of the page: DO YOU HAVE THE "CLASS" TO PRINT THIS?

"1 Alum and Newsweek writer speaks at N D 
By REGIS COCCIA Senior Staff Reporter 
Newsweek writer Frank Maier, a Notre Dame graduate who almost died from chronic liver disease, returned to campus Thursday to tell about his experience. 
Accompanied by his wife Ginny, Maier told students in "I really wasn't sure I was ever going to wake up again," he said. But the 10-hour operation in Minnesota's Mayo Clinic was successful. 
"My first instinct was, 'I gotta call New York. I'm alive, and it's a terrific story,"' said Maier. "I'm the first journalist in the history of mankind to go through a liver transplant." 
Surviving the operation was one thing, but getting the story on it in the magazine was an­other, Maier said. An initial meeting with his editors in New York was positive, but weeks and months passed before the story was mentioned again, he said. 
"It sort of dawned on me that getting this story into the mag­azine had nothing to do with me or the story itself. I thought, 'I'm losing the battle on politics,"' Maier said. 
"I was involved in two ways. Professionally, I thought, 'Here's a great story. Why don't those yo-yos in New York get on it?' I was involved emo­tionally," he said. "I wanted to tell my story. Getting it in was just as compelling as staying alive had been." 
The story was eventually published, said Maier, nearly 10 months after he wrote it. Maier said response to the story has been overwhelming, adding he has personally received 125 letters from organ donors and people suffering from illnesses like his. 
"The one thing we learned from this story was, no matter how bad we thought we had it, other people had it worse," Maier said. 
"Now I really am much more interested in people," he said. 
Maier came to campus at the request of longtime friend Robert Schmuhl, University professor of American studies and director of the Program for Ethics in Media.

Kozol speaks on homeless 
By SARAH VOIGT 
News Staff  
Jonathan  Kozol,  author  of  
several  books  on  adult  il­ 
literacy  and  the  homeless,  

gave a lecture Thursday en­titled "At the mercy of America: the homeless and their children." Kozol cited widespread ignorance about the plight of the homeless and cuts in federal aid as reasons for the half million homeless children in America. 
"We've always had homeless in America, but never this flood of family homelessness. Not since the Great Depression have their been so many home­less children in America," Kozol said. 
Kozol said rents in low in­come housing have skyrock­eted in all the major cities in recent years, resulting in an in­creased number of homeless Americans. In addition, he said, two million jobs per year have been eliminated since 1980. Most of these jobs were in the suffering steel, auto and textile industries. 
"With rents up and wages down, the White House picked this decade to cut benefits," Kozol said. Although the need for aid has increased, federal funding for housing projects has decreased, according to Kozol. 
In what Kozol refers to as "possibly the single greatest domestic budget cut of the Reagan administration,'' yearly funding to provide low cost housing has decreased from a high of 32 billion dollars in 1979 to an all time low of 7 billion dollars today. 
"In New York City today, the waiting list for public housing is 18 years, 12 years in Boston and 20 years in Miami. The ad­ministration has stopped build­ing public housing. Yet the president tells us that the homeless are 'homeless, you might say, by choice,"' said Kozol. 
For the past three years, Kozol has lived and worked in the Martinique Hotel, one of the 60 shelters for the homeless in New York City. The Martinique houses 2,000 destitute people, 1,400 of which are children. Kozol focused much of his lec­ture on impoverished children. 
"Sometimes I wish they (the homeless children) would march into the lobbies of ele­gant hotels and make it impossible for them to enjoy their pleasures. At least if these kids could strike out in this way, they wouldn't strike at themselves," Kozol said. 
Kozol links extreme poverty to the drug problems endemic to the homeless shelters. He refers to their widespread drug and alcoholic abuse as "a dis­guised form of suicide." 
According to Kozol, the tragedy of homelessness transcends the partisan issue. "Homeless children need Americans of all political pos­itions to hear their words," Kozol said. 
"Someday, we're told, there will be physicans for these children, food for their families, mercy for their mot­hers. Someday, somewhere, someplace--but not now. These children that are alive right now will not profit from the blessings of another decade, from the kindness of another congress or the mercy of an­other head of state," Kozol said. 
"That's the pity; that's the 
urgency. They will have no second chance to live their childhoods .... This is an irrever­
sible theft. The loss is incalcul­~~l~~i~e crime unspeakable,"

Camblin and Simon stressed that anyone walking in the neighborhood should be cau­tious. "We've been here five years, and we're finding out this neighborhood is more dan­gerous than we ever thought," Camblin said. 
The students cited other cases of harassment involving people walking in the neighbor­hood, near The Commons, Bridget McGuire's Filling Sta­tion and other off-campus stu­dent residences. 
"People walking should be careful. I don't plan on walking to Bridget's by myself anymore, and I live a block away. Incidents like this can happen," Simon said. 
Police reports indicate a call was made at 11:50 p.m. res­ponding to a fight in the 900 block of Corby Street and a pos­sible stabbing. A total of four police reports were made, none by Notre Dame students. 
The reports list Michael Nel­son, 25, of Clinton, MA, as re­ceiving a knife wound in his up­per left arm. "The victim realized he'd been cut and went to Bridget's, where an off-duty South Bend police officer re­ported the incident at 11:50," said Kilgore.

Bush maintains lead over Dukakis 
Associated Press . 
George Bush pocketed a labor endorsement Thursday and said his drive for the White House was "all about creating jobs and opportunity." Under­dog Michael Dukakis accused his GOP rival of airing nega­tive campaign commercials to "divert attention" from Reagan-Bush administration failures. 
The pollsters' daily tidings were good once again for Bush, who was reported leading 51 percent to 42 percent in a nationwide survey taken for NBC and the Wall Street Jour­nal. New polls also showed a tight race in New York, one of the country's most Democratic bastions. 
Dukakis made his way toward Harry Truman's home town of Independence, Mo., likening himself to the ''feisty little guy" who won the White House four decades ago in a storied upset. "Harry Truman was a fighter, and so am I," he said. 
In a 14-minute live interview on the CBS "Evening News," Dukakis said again and again he wants to put the government on the "side of average Americans." 
The Democrat also conceded that Bush commercials depict­ing him as weak on crime, defense and the environment had done him political harm. But he said they were also in­tended to "to divert public at­tention from the fact that this administration has probably had more corruption and mal­feasance than any in recent memory if not in history.:·· 
"This is not about who puts together the best commercials or best advertising," he said. "It's about which one of us, Mike Dukakis or George Bush, has the strength and the values to run this country." 
Bush continued his week­long emphasis on economic is­sues as he made his way down the Pacific Coast from Wash­ington to California. Along the way he accused Dukakis of trying to "fan the flames of protectionism" in comments on trade and of "trying to scare the American people by putting Japanese flags on these Amer­ican commercials of his." 
Bush won the endorsement of the 50,000-member Marine En­gineers Beneficial Association at a rally interrupted by protesters. Four were hustled away, including one whose nose was bloodied, and Bush paused in his speech long enough to remind them of the high interest rates that prevailed at the end of the Carter administration. 
"This election is all about creating jobs and opportu­nity," he said, promising to keep the economic expansion alive.

House members raise $14.4, million for campaigns 
THERE'S GOING TO 

Friday, October 28, 1988 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON--The 58 House members facing no major party challenge to re­election have raised $14.4 mil­lion for their campaigns, and nearly half of them will be en­titled to keep any unspent money when they retire, a private study said Friday. 
The list includes such House leadership figures as Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Reps. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., chairman of the Rules Commit-
The Observer page7 
j US embassy in Moscow is bugged and must be rebuilt 
A"o<lated .,..,. 
WASHINGTON--President Reagan recommended Thursday that the new U.S. em­bassy in Moscow be razed and rebuilt from the ground up be­cause it is riddled with listening devices that cannot be removed. 
Reagan told reporters the United States has "no choice" in the matter "because there's no way to rid it of the many listening devices that were built into it." 
"We're going to start and have an American-built one," Reagan said of the embassy. 
At the State Department, spokesman Charles Redman said Reagan will urge Congress to permit the virtually com­pleted embassy to be demolished and reconstructed with American-made compo-
tee; John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and Kika de Ia Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the Agriculture Committee. 
Forty-one of the 58 unop­posed lawmakers are Democrats, who control the House, according to the study compiled by the watchdog group Congress Watch. The $14.4 million includes $7.3 mil­lion from political action com­mittees. 
"That these PACs feel com­pelled to contribute to law­makers who have no opponent shows that what's being sought is access and influence, not compatible candidates or good government," said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, the parent organiza­tion of Congress Watch. 
The legislators or their aides who were questioned defended the fund raising, arguing that campaign funds must be col­lected before they know whe­ther they will have an election nents to be shipped from the United States and stored in Moscow warehouses under the tightest possible security. He said the building will be as­sembled by U.S. workers taken to Moscow for that purpose. 
The Soviets will not be per­mitted to move into their newly built embassy in Washington until the United States can oc­cupy its facilities in Moscow, Redman said. 
He said that tearing down the existing structure and building a new one under high security conditions will involve "a very elaborate and costly process." 
"Obviously we're talking years," Redman said. 
But he said the final cost can­not now be estimated because entirely new engineering and 
opponent. 
"If you had a crystal ball, you wouldn't enter into one of these fund-raising strategies,'' said Cliff Gibbons, who is cam­paign finance manager for his father, Rep. Sam Gibbons, D­Fla. 
Congress Watch said the elder Gibbons has raised $309,537 from PACs, second highest total among the unop­posed incumbents, and $503,340 overall, the third highest mark after Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, and Dingell. Gibbons is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee sub­committee on trade. 
PAC are formed by corpora­tions, labor unions and other in­terest groups to funnel money to candidates, with incumbents the long-favored recipients. For the 1986 elections, accor­ding to Federal Election Com­mission records, PACs sent 88 percent of their contributions to lawmakers seeking re­election. 
architectural plans will have to be drawn up. 
He said Reagan's proposed demolition and reconstruction plan was recommended by Sec­retary of State George Shultz following several reviews of the project by U.S. experts. 
"This option offers the best overall solution to the prob­lem," Redman said. 
He said the rebuilt eight­story embassy will occupy the same site but will be different than the one recommended for demolition. The new structure will incorporate features "to take into account what we have learned" about Soviet eavesdropping capabilities, he said. 
"Every precaution will be taken to assure the security of the process," Redman said.

r 
exam to assess teachers 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK--The Educa­tional Testing Service unveiled plans Thursday for a compre­hensive new teacher licensing exam, including computer simulations of classroom situ­ations, to help states weed out incompetents. 
"There is a widespread and growing concern about the preparedness and effective­ness of beginning teachers, and we believe that breakthroughs in research and technology make possible a new kind of as­sessment that will provide greater assistance, fairness and accuracy," said ETS pres­ident Gregory Anrig. 
He expressed hope that the new exam would help put to rest recurring charges by teacher unions and others that existing teacher tests don't ac­curately assess classroom skills and are unfair to minorities. 
Jane Usdan, a spokeswoman for the American Federation of Teachers, called the new test "a step in the right direction. 
Debate 

continued from page 1 
closing, citing areas such as drug abuse, child care and edu­cation as areas he will work to improve. 

Ward ended with a last stab at his opponent and stressed his own campaign as "people­oriented." "When it came time for people items, this man's (pointing to Hiler) vote was cut, cut, cut. My priorities are put the people first. Let's make sure we put people before cor­porate profits." 
About 750 attended the debate, which culminated a Notre Dame-Saint Mary's stu­dent government push to in­crease political awareness on campus, said Student Body 
President Tom Doyle. 
''By and large it was students who attended. That was the whole goal," Doyle said. "I think it's a tremendous credit to the students who set it up." 
The six-member panel in­cluded: Mike Bolles of WVFI­AM; Bill Hawkins, SUB's ideas and issues comm1s1oner; Steven Horst of the Graduate Student Union; Katherine Kol­ler of Saint Mary's student gov­ernment and Chris Murphy, editor of The Observer. 
Mike Keegan, student gov­ernment's executive coordina­tor of political, cultural and so­cial concerns, moderated the debate. 
The event was sponsored by both student governments, Col­lege Democrats, College Republicans, Student Union Board, the Graduate Student Union, WVFI-AM and The Ob­server, Doyle said. 
''A lot of student groups with different agendas put them aside for the sake of this event and that's the beauty of it," he said. "I think it's a tremendous credit to the students who set it up."

We need a Peace Corps volunteer. Call us all...aoo-424.SS80, Exl. 93. 

We have said we need to test teachers differently, not only on what they know but on what they can do." 
The exam is designed as a licensing tool for beginning teachers and is not intended to assess veteran teachers, Anrig stressed. 
Prototypes of the exam, as yet unnamed, will be field tested in 1990, and a final ver­sion is expected to be ready in 1992, according to the Lawren­ceville, N.J.-based testing ser­vice. 
The test eventually is ex­pected to replace the National Teacher Exam, a paper-and­pencil multiple choice test taken by some 200,000 teaching candidates a year and adminis­tered by ETS. That test, which costs from $35 to $50 depending on how many parts of it a state requires, was first offered in 1939 and is part of the teacher licensing program in 30 states. 
Unlike current teacher ex­ams, the new test is designed to be taken at three stages of a would-be teacher's training. 
The first part would use a computertotestreading,math and writing skills during or after the second year of under­graduate study. 
The second test would assess grasp of subject matter and teaching principles following completion of teacher training. 
Beginning teachers would !1. take a third test to evaluate how well they perform in actual classrooms once they have had some supervised teaching ex­perience. It would include ob­servation of teaching perfor­mance and computer simulations of classroom situ­ations. 
"The evaluation may extend over a period of time for a prospective teacher, giving states a much better sense of professional development," said Carol Dwyer, an ETS senior development leader who created the new test. "The The right to vote method also allows the student

P.O. Box Q 

United Way seeks aid 

Dear Editor: 
r The students of Saint Mary's and Notre Dame create and envelop them­selves in a thriving community, seeking personal growth and enriching their lives. As part of that community, it is easy to see that we are all blessed with many gifts, and part of our growth stems from sharing those gifts with others. In the first week of October, United Way of St. Joseph County turned to Saint Mary's and Notre Dame for sup­
port. It is important that as students we recognize the larger community of which we are also a part. 
L.ast year, United Way served over 70,000 people through 36 agencies in St. Joseph County. Their service truly reflects a state of compassion and good­will which would not be possible without the people concerned with health and social needs, people who are willing to care for and embrace the less for­tunate. Our efforts are directed toward such agencies as the American Red Cross, Catholic Social Services, Good­will, Logan, and many others who are warmly appreciative. 
This year, I hope that as a whole, we may extend ourselves to the call of our larger community. The campaign for Saint Mary's ends Nov. 14, and Nov. 17 for Notre Dame. See your section rep­resentative to make a gift. Their names may be obtained through your residence assistant. 
"United way is more than a great way to give, it's the best way to care." Let us continue to share our gifts with others.

Weekend Wheels provides safety 
Dear Editor: 
We are not writing this article to try to shock you with statistics as to why you should not drink and drive. You all have heard the horrifying facts before. However, like so many other things in life, most people have the attitude that the tragedy will never happen to them. 
Doonesbury 
That is a dangerous attitude to take, one that may cost you your life. Notre Dame has not been spared from the tragedy of drunk driving in the past, but maybe it can be prevented in the future. This is why the Hall Presidents' Council is sponsoring the transporta­tion service of Weekend Wheels. 
We realize that many people think that it is not too far to drive home from the bars, and they will be fine. Just think for a moment of the danger you are putting yourself as well as everyone else on the road in. 
We realize in the past people may not have viewed this service (formerly the Buzz Bus) as a viable option. We have tried very hard to work within the con­straints that have been placed on us to make it more useful. The hours have been expanded, and the stops will soon be more recognizable with permanentsigns. 
When you are ready to leave the bar or a party, ride home safely on Weekend Wheels. If you drove to the destination and think that you are OK to drive home, think again. We realize that it is an inconvenience to leave your car where it is overnight, but it is better to leave your car than lose your life or that of another. 
Weekend Wheels is free to everyone and is easy to ride. There will be five stops this year: Campus View, Five Points, St. Louis and Corby St., Main Circle and Library Circle. The bus can take you home safely and with ab­solutely no hassle. Please look for posters to see the exact times for pick­up. The bus will run every Friday and Saturday night so please take advan­tage of it. Also, the first 100 riders will each receive a free T -shirt.

Dukakis stance shows deception 
Dear Editor: 
The second presidential debate on Oct. 13 between Michael Dukakis and George Bush, was important for the American people for many reasons. It was especially remarkable for being one of very few occasions that either candidate acknowledged the issue of abortion. Prompted by a reporter's question, Dukakis replied to Bush's po-

04, THAT'S RIGHT, I CAN. leT'S 5/5&... HE'S 5/lY!N~.. 
sition of favoring a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, and dan­ger to the mother's life: "Isn't the real question that we have to answer, not how many exceptions we have to make, because the vice president himself is prepared to make exceptions? It's who makes the decision. 
"Who makes this very difficult, very 
wrenching decision? And I think it has 
to be the woman, in the exercise of her 
own conscience and religious beliefs, 
that makes the decision." 
I must confess that, even though I believe in the right to life of unborn children, I was momentarily paralyzed by this statement. Perhaps many people accepted this argument as reasonable. However, after some thought, I have discovered why this statement is paralyzing. The question the governor puts to himself and then answers is meaningless. You cannot di­rectly refute Dukakis' answer to the question he posed because the asking of the question, and our willingness to be asked the question, requires that we swallow a big, fat assumption. Who should make this decision? Who says there has to be a decision? Let us look at what Mr. Dukakis wants us to accept without any discussion or debate. 
Every decision results from a freedom. The freedom in this case is to kill a baby whose only crime is that it now happens to be living in his or her mother's womb. Therefore, to give any answer to the question requires that you believe in a freedom to kill a certain class of living human individuals. The question is, upon analysis, circular, il­logical and absurd, to anyone that believes that freedom may have limits. 
Upon examination the logic evaporates. Dukakis tries to persuade, but assumes everybody already agrees and inconvenient. Surely, any just so­lutions to the social problems implied by the answers would be complicated, and point to considerable change. Real­ly, Mr. Dukakis must think American folks just aren't ready for that respon­sibility, that decision, and that freedom. It's better to avoid the central issues of abortion all together. 
Eloquent language by political fig­ures, like the illogical statement of Mr. Dukakis, can be very powerful in per­suading people to condone abortion. Be­hind such language is subtle, grave deception.

Article stoops to chauvinism 
Dear Editor: 
I would like to thank Glenn Fogarty for his Viewpoint article of Oct. 26 en­titled, "On desk graffiti, football, and flowers," in which he expressed his dis­like for a football cheer by writing "Only a woman or some type of fairy could have made up that monstrosity." Sometimes it is difficult to give con­crete examples of bigotry in our com­munity, but Mr. Fogarty has provided us with a classic. Whether or not he realized it, women, gays, and lesbians are a vital part of the Notre Dame com­munity who, as his words demonstrate, are often the victims of prejudice and oppression. Next time Mr. Fogarty can't come up with a "worthwhile topic" for his column, he shouldn't write one. Only a homophobic chauvinist could have made up his latest piece, and such an author isn't worth reading.

eith Richards, one of rock-n-roll's original rebels, seems to have matured and come into his own with his first solo effort, Talk is Cheap. This album, released last week, reveals a confident and powerful artist who, until recently, pledged never to leave the Rolling Stones to do solo work. 
Talk is Cheap provided a desperately needed creative outlet for Richards during the time the Stones were forced to take a back seat to Mick Jagger's ill-fated solo wander­ings. 
The anger and desertion Richards felt towards Jagger are apparent in the song "You Don't Move Me." Keith blatantly attacks Mick with lines such as "Now you wanna throw the dice. You already crapped out twice." 

Though "You Don't Move Me " provides an interesting look into the complex Jag­geli'Richards relationship, this album does much more than fan the fire of the ever­burning argument between Mick and Keith. It provides Richards with freedom to ex-

Away," explores the age-old dilemma of male-female relationships. This song, with its acoustic guitar and violin, paints a moody and con­templative, almost psychotic, picture of a man in love. 
Though Richards explores new musical styles on Talk is Cheap, he did not attempt to abandon the sound he has perfected during 25 years with the Rolling Stones. Songs like "Take it So Hard," "Struggle," and the riveting 

"It Means A Lot" remind us that Richards has been, and remains, the musical back­bone of one of rock-n-roll's greatest bands. 
This album is not, however, a Rolling Stones album. It is a strong, well-rounded solo effort by a musician in limbo. Talk is Cheap has assured the musical world that there is passion left in this 44-year-old musician. Mark my words: we shall hear from Keith Ric­hards again, with or without the Stones.

plore a wide variety of musi­cal styles. 
Talk is Cheap opens with a strange, but very successful wander into the world of funk. Richards combines his vocals and guitar with some of James Brown's band to come up with the hot and jumpy "Big Enough." The re­sulting mixture is good enough to get you up and dan­cing. 
"Make No Mistake," this album's best track, has Keith's eerie vocals working 
together with the peaceful and soft voice of Sarah Dash. The Memphis Horns, Robert Cray's horn section, provide a strong backbone for the sing­ers' slow but passionate vocal interplay. 
Richards also takes a fun jaunt down nostalgia row with the Rockabilly tune "I Could Have Stood You Up." Johnnie Johnson's light and happy piano solos combine with Keith's love of 50s style rock­n-roll to make this song work well.

By PETE SKIKO Assistant Sports Editor 
At first glance, Notre Dame's upcom­ing game with the Navy Midshipmen on Saturday has the makings of a rout. 
And even if you stare at it for a while longer, the bulk of the excitement at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore will probably be centered around whether or not the Irish cover the 34 points they're favored by. 
But, never one to look ahead, Head Coach Lou Holtz chooses to look at the worst-case scenario. 
"The Naval Academy is a well­disciplined team," said Holtz. "They're very similar to the Air Force Academy in that they run out of the wishbone, but they're much bigger on offense and much bigger on defense than the Air Force Academy. They have two fine quarterbacks and statistically, over the whole year, they're rather impressive. 
"Last week Navy lost to Pitt by a decided margin (52-6), but Pitt had to punt six times, had two turnovers and scored on a lot of big plays. We're not necessarily a big-play type of football team. You never know what to expect when you go on the road, but I do think our players will be ready to play well and play hard." 
A few additional points might lend 
more credence to the expectation of an 
Irish rout: 
 
The Midshipmen are 3-4 on the year, but they have not defeated a Division lA school since 1986. Their three wins came at the expense of James Madison, Delaware and Yale. Navy has lost to Temple (12-7), The Citadel (42-35), Air Force (34-24), and Pitt. 

 
Notre Dame and Navy will lengthen the longest continuous intersectional rivalry in the country when they square off Saturday, and in the 61 games played between the squads thus far the Irish are 51-9-1. That includes victories in the last 24 straight, dating back to 1963 when Roger Staubach led Navy to a 35-14 win at Notre Dame Stadium. The Irish own more victories over Navy than any other team in Notre Dame history. 

 
Last year the Irish scored the first six times they had the ball, building a 35-6 halftime lead and going on to win 56-13 over Navy. This year, Notre Dame is 7-0 and ranked No. 2 in the country in both the AP and UPI national polls. 


But if you're going to look at trends, in fairness to the Middies, the last time Navy faced a team ranked No. 2 in the nation it won 38-21 over South Carolina back in 1984. And Navy went 4-6-1 that year. 
Just a thought.

Irish Extra: The Game 
Gary Mcintosh at quarterback in place of Alton Grizzard, who was the team's leading rusher out of the wishbone of­fense. Grizzard will move to flanker against the Irish and Mcintosh should again get the starting nod. 
Mcintosh is 22-of-52 for 319 yards and two touchdowns on the year, while rush­ing for 193 yards and four touchdowns on 51 carries. 
In the Navy backfield, the wishbone alignment includes senior halfback Luther Archer (69 rushes for 358 yards and a touchdown), junior halfback James Bradley (54 for 264, three TDs), and senior fullback Bert Pangrazio (42 for 151, one TD). Sophomore fullback Deric Sims also will see action. 
The top Middie receiver is senior flanker Carl Jordan (21 catches for 371 yards and 4 TDs). Junior Shane Smith will handle the split end duties, and Grizzard (two catches for 35 yards last week against Pitt) will supplement the receiving corps. 
On the offensive line, tackles Mike Kircher and senior Tim Hofacre lead a young but improved Navy front. Hofacre is the only returning regular in the Middies' offensive line, but also is considered one of the best linemen in the east. 
The Irish defense is coming off of several impressive showings, most recently the limitation of Air Force's vaunted wishbone attack to only 13 points and 216 total yards (46 passing)­-far below its previous season averages of 46 points and 522 yards per game. And although Miami QB Steve Walsh had a career-best day passing against Notre Dame, the Irish defense yielded only 57 yards on the ground and forced seven turnovers against the Hur­ricanes. The defense may need another good effort to repel Navy's 17th-ranked rushing attack, but that kind of effort is likely. 
Freshman Arnold Ale is again ex­pected to compete with Flash Gordon and Andre Jones for playing time at de­fensive end. Nose guard Chris Zorich has 46 tackles and three fumble recoveries on the year. 
Thethreesome of Wes Pritchett, Mi­chael Stonebreaker and Ned Bolcar will again split the majority of time at the linebacker spots. Among the three, they have registered 175 tackles, four sacks and three interceptions. 
"Last week I thought the secondary responded very, very well to Air Force's wishbone," said Holtz. "Going into our game, Air Force had had 33 plays of 25 yards or more. Against us they had one play of 22 yards and other than that they did not have a play of above 15 yards. That's a tribute to all five of those guys who played in the secondary.''

Anthony Johnson and the Irish enter Baltimore's Memorial Stadium an over­whelming favorite against a Navy team 
after Saturday's fly-by of Air Force, it 
was the kicking game. 
"The kicking game was disappoint­
ing certainly," said Holtz. "On our 
kickoffs, the coverage left a lot to be 
desired and that's something we've 
really addressed this week. Anything 
good that may have come out of our 
long punt returns of late was negated 
by (Ricky Watters') fumbled punt Sat­
urday. And we mishandled a snap for 
a point-after attempt. 
"So there are just little thingS in the 
kicking game that have really bothered 
me. We certainly didn't execute as well 
as we're going to have to." 
The running game continues to be the driving force (13th in the country at 259 yards per game) behind the offensive success of the Irish, including the emer­gence of Tony Brooks, who is 50th in the country in rushing despite playing with a broken bone in his foot. 
"Brooks obviously has become an outstanding running back," said Holtz. "He would have exceeded my expecta­tions for him at this point even if his foot wasn't broken. I had written him off earlier in the year, but he must have one heck of a high pain threshold." 
Brooks and Mark Green will split ac­tion again at tailback and Anthony Johnson gets the nod at fullback. Braxston Banks' knee is still ailing and 
that has not defeated a Division lA squad since 1986. 
Quarterback Tony Rice is 43-of-84 for 719 yards, six touchdowns and five in­terceptions. Perhaps just as important are his 78 rushes for 470 yards and seven touchdowns. 
The deep threats of Watters and Rag­bib "Rocket" Ismail have caught a combined 19 passes for 402 yards and three touchdowns. 
Mike Heldt will man the center spot, while co-captain Andy Heck and Dean Brown will start at tackles. Junior guard Tim Grunhard is still feeling the effects of an ankle injury and might not see action this weekend to give the ankle time to heal. In that event, Tim Ryan would be moved to right guard and either Mike Brennan or Winston Sandri would take over at left guard. 
Navy's defensive strength is against the pass, where it ranks sixth in the country, yielding only 123 yards a game through the air. That is also the amount the Irish have averaged passing through seven games. 
The Middie secondary includes Scott Carson and Jim Chatfield at the corners while Rodney Brown and Bob Weissen­fels hold down the safety slots. But the Irish probably will do most of their moving on the ground against a young defensive line and linebacking corps. 
Expect another grind-'em-out Irish effort with a lot of effective off-tackle running plays. The larger Notre Dame offensive and defensive lines should wear down their game but outmatched

Lyght continued from page 1 ing 19 passes during his career. The Ann Arbor News named Lyght the best player in the state after his senior season. Early in his freshman season, Lyght moved from flanker to help a struggling and injury-riddled defensive sec­ondary. After cornerback Brandy Wells injured a knee in the opener against Michigan and Corny Southall tore a knee ligament against Pittsburgh, the playing time mounted for Lyght.  "We didn't have too much depth at defensive back," Lyght said. "I did whatever helped the team. Now, I like defense a lot better. It's nice to be giving the licks out." Lyght played in all12 games last year, starting at free safety against Air Force and Miami. He recorded 21 solo tackles and had eight assists. He also boasts blazing speed, evidenced by his high school letters in track as a hurdler and sprinter. Heading into spring practice, Lyght was listed on the second team behind Francisco. That  was all the incentive he needed. Francisco started the opener against Michigan, but Lyght has started every game since. "I just played harder and tried to do the things I knew I could do," Lyght said. "After coming out this year and working with the No. 2 defense, it gave me a lot of incentive to get back on the No. 1 defense." Much of the credit for the performance of the secondary goes to first-year coach Chuck Heater. The practices are more demanding, but according to Lyght the Irish have a new­found intensity under Heater.  Lyght shows that intensity both on and off the field. Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz has taken notice of his play, saying after the Stanford game that Lyght was as fine a defensive back as he's been around. "I'm pleased that he thinks I have that kind of ability, but I have a long way to go," Lyght said. "It's the very little things, footwork, drops, reading the wide receiver and the quarter­back." Lyght is the youngest of three children, the last in a long line of athletic relatives. His father, William, played basketball at  Morgan State, his brother, Trent, was a swimmer at Arizona State and his sister, Cheryl, was a swimmer at Rochester. Ifthe Irish continue their current play, the Lyght team could soon boast a nac tional championship member. Even in the heat of that na­tional championship drive, Lyght, a business major, can see beyond the tunnels lined with possible title banners. "My studies are very, very important," Lyght said. "I can't play football forever." Indeed, Lyght is not just an­other football player.

T
he title of U2's new album, Rattle and Hum, may strike fear into those Domers who haven't been able to sleep recently because their radiators rattle all night long. 
Have no fear, Rattle and Hum is not as strange as its title suggests, yet it will be a definite challenge to U2's au­dience, considering its stylis­tic divergence from past al­bums. 
A large portion of Rattle and Hum results from U2's venture into the American roots of rock, blues, and gospel music that took place during The Joshua Tree tour and the filming of "U2 Rattle and Hum," the accompanying movie that opens November 4. 
Penetrating live covers of the Beatie's "Helter Skelter," and Bob Dylan's "All Along the Watchtower" initial U2's hat-tipping to the founders of rock. 
Later, there is "Angel of Harlem" a catchy tune writ­ten in honor of Billie Holiday, complete with saxophone and trumpet by the Memphis Horns. This tribute continues with "When Love Comes to Town," a bluesy tangent that Bono wrote for B.B. King which also features a perfor­mance by King. For John Lennon, there is the peculiarly rappish "God Part 
·-II," a rebuttal to Albert Goldman's negative biog­raphy of Lennon. This song's message is strong with lyrics like "I don't believe in excess success is to give ... I believe in love," but musically this tune is hard to swallow, even for the loyal fan. "Love Res­cue Me," co-written by Bob Dylan, is another of the less exciting pieces on the album with its slow, country sound. 
The six live songs on the al­bum come across powerfully, allowing Bono to voice the band's political message out­side lyrical confines. In the anti-apartheid "Silver and Gold,"Bono describes a man "who is ready to take up arms against his oppressor, a man who has lost faith in the peacemakers of the West while they argue and fail to support a man like Bishop Tutu ... " During "Bullet the Blue Sky," a song denouncing 
U.S. policy in El Salvador, Bono says, " ... I can't tell the difference between ABC News, 'Hillstreet Blues,' and a preacher ... stealing money 
from the sick and the old. 
Well the God I believe in isn't 
short of cash mister." 
The live version of "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For," which features a Harlem Choir, will be ini­tially disappointing to those expecting the same version they saw during the Joshua Tree tour. Nonetheless, this version has all of U2's emo­tion and energy and holds some definite appeal in its gospel rhythm. 
Some of the new studio songs that resemble the es­tablished U2 sound are "Desire," the first release from the album, "Hawkmoon 269," "Heartland," a wel­come return to the surreal sound of The Unforgettable Fire, and "All I Want Is You," a love song that builds with a string accompaniment to finish the album. 
As with The Joshua Tree, the lyrics on Rattle and Hum are somewhat redundant, but for fans who want more poison rain, angels, devils, and fire, there is plenty of it. 
One disappointing aspect of Rattle and Hum is the small number of live songs from The Joshua Tree tour. Still, U2 brought forth a new stock of impressive songs. Maybe the movie will include more of a taste of the live U2.

love yourself? I mean, did you turn the other cheek when he said you were a phoney? When Oral Roberts pushed the panic button, did you offer to lend him money? Remember about being a Good Samaritan." 
Jesus continued, "No one promised it would be a cinch to be the Pope." 
"Thy will be done, Lord,'' answered John Paul in a sin­cere voice. "But what about some of your other teachings? I often look at all the hear­tache I could change, if I were allowed to say 'yes' sometimes instead of 'no' all the time, I think things would be easier, even for You, suf­fering wherever Your children are unhappy. 
"You should tell them from Me that Rome wasn't built in but that doesn't change anything. I'll return to Rome to hold a synod, but synods don't change anything. Fi­nally I'm faced with a mo­ment of truth: as God's man for all seasons holding the keys of the kingdom, I don't help anybody. So I'd like to ask you face-to-face: is this any way to run the Church?" 

When Jesus saw tears in the face of this good old man, He loved him too much to want to hurt him. As a good-will gesture, He tore up the report card he had brought. "I got the silly idea of evaluating you from a business manage­ment class, where a student used to pray for me to come and help him. Why should I pressure you with grades in­stead of allowing you to take a pass-fail?" Jesus said this, of course, to show how human He is, in addition to being God. 
"Once," Jesus said, "when I was being all things to all men, I spent some time with the street people in London. I met an old Scotsman who had been in jail. I asked him what he had done. He answered Me evasively, thinking I was an out-of-work preacher: 'It was an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,' meaning he had committed'!-cri~e of vio­lence. Readmg ~Is face, I could t~ll tha_t hi~ anger was passed, and m ~Is h~art, he w~~ at p~a~~ with htms~lf. 
He satd. ~te~ commg back from bemg mcar­cerated, do you know what I noticed, guv'nor? I noticed that people have forgotten how to laugh.' Mter telling Me two or three times how much the world needs laughter, he asked: 'Do you know what Our Lord's last words from the Cross were?' I said I knew what the words were, but I wanted to hear his version. "Then he told Me: 'As He was seeing the view from the Cross, Our Lord's last words were: What a way to spend Easter!"' 
The Pope, hearing this, wasn't sure if he should laugh or cry. 
Jesus continued, in a deliberate understatement: "Calvary, of course, was no laughing matter, but the nightmare of Calvary could never have happened if the Jews and Romans hadn't for­gotten how to laugh. If you're able to laugh at yourself in a wholesome way, you aren't apt to get proud and spiteful toward other people, and feel that you have a right to put
them on trial, and kill them. 
"The irony of the situation was that the jeerin~ c~owd came to Calvary thmkmg the joke was on the Jew they crucified. But He was the only one there so in touch with His grace-filledhumanit~ tha! He could have laughed if He d _wanted to, though He ":as m no mood to get off one-h~ers .. The old_ Sc_?tsm~n, with hts wee bit of a JOke, 'Wh~t a way to spend Easter, d~hvered the . shortest, fmest Good Frtday homily I've ever heard." 
John Paul II, searching for words, finally said: "One of the questions Christians ask is: 'Did He ever laugh?' The Gospels don't tell us if You laughed. Did you go to the mountains to laugh, as You went there to pray, afraid, as Chesterton suggested, that Your mirth would be misun­derstood?" 
Jesus, laughing, answered: "The world was made out of laughter and joy, out of the happiness in the heart of My Father. Rabbis studying the Torah could point out the jokes, puns and word-play that Yahweh left like a signa­ture on His inspired books for His scholars to discover. Gloom entered the world when sin came. The Puritans elevated gloom into a religi­ous art form, and Catholics elevated suffering which ac­
companies gloom into a holy lifestyle."

Now, at the Vatican, John Paul II makes the cardinals tell him a joke a day. They say he prefers humor to prayer, scandalous though it sounds. John Paul answers: "Humor is prayer, if it reminds you that Easter is not necessarily a bed of roses."

midfield, although there are some good players and I cer­tainly think they will play hard," said Corrigan. "The game surely will be a good learning experience for them." 
With six players returning who played in six or more games last year, the Irish defense likely will anchor the team throughout the year. The defense is led by senior tri­captains O'Connor and Spen­cer, who both started last spring. 
O'Connor will start the Hop­kins game alongside senior Brendan Cahill and junior Mike Stephens, who has returned tested by the Hopkins players, who are capable at scoring from anywhere on the field. Nonetheless, Corrigan thinks Glazier is capable of having a good outing. 
"Jeff is very quick and has great reactions, but he has to work on his positioning and on taking control," said Corrigan. "He has great seniors playing in front of him (on defense), but the goalie is really like a quarterback and, no matter what year he is, he has to take control." 
John Hopkins will bring a team comprised of high school All-Americans and numerous NCAA All-Americans. Senior Dave Petramala, an imposing 6'3" 190 pound two-time All­American defenseman, is "probably the best defenseman in the country,'' according to Corrigan. 
Other Bluejay players to watch include junior All­American goalie Quint Kes­sinich, sophomore attackman Matt Paneta, and the Kelly midfielders--senior captain Brendan and junior Greg. Greg Kelly, who is not related to Brendan, scored five goals in John Hopkins' recent 14-5 win in a scrimmage against the University of Maryland­Baltimore County. 
Hopkins coach Don Zimmer­man has won three national titles ('84, '86, and '87) while compiling a 57-8 record in his five years as Bluejays coach. 
A former player for Hopkins, Zimmerman also has coached at North Carolina and was an assistant last year for the United States World Games team.

Irish look to get back on track 
Loyola, injuries to test cross country team at MCC meet 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO Sports Writer 
It's time for the men's cross country team to reestablish its position as a national power when it competes in the Mid­western Collegiate Conference Championships today in Chicago. 
In the words of junior runner 
Tom  O'Rourke,  it's  time  to  
"put up or shut up."  
The  Irish,  who  finished  

seventh in the country last year at the NCAA Championships, have encountered many diffi­culties of late in their drive to repeat or even top last year's performance. 
In the last two weeks, the Irish have suffered a defeat at Southern California and have lost their number-three runner, junior Mike O'Connor, to a leg injury. 
The MCC Championships are looming big in the minds of the runners, due to their recent dis­appointments. 
"The MCC's are especially important now," said fifth­year senior captain Dan Gar­rett. "After we ran so badly at USC, we have to get our confi­dence up or we won't do anyth­ing at districts." 
The MCC Championships will precede the NCAA District IV meet by two weeks, with the latter being the qualifying race for the NCAA Championships. 
The team hopes to improve its running in anticipation of the District IV meet, which is the most competitive district in the country and which lead co­ach Joe Piane has called a "hel­lacious district.'' 
The MCC's, which will be hosted by Loyola Oil.), will take place in Montrose Park in Chicago. Loyola and Notre Dame are expected to be the main competitors, but other strong teams such as Butler, Detroit and Marquette also will be attending. 
Earlier this year, Notre Dame won the National Catho­lic meet held on its home course, with Loyola finishing second. Now, a new meet will take place on Loyola's home course, and the Irish will be without O'Connor. 
Suddenly, a new rivalry with Loyola has emerged. 
"(The rivalry) has become really big in the last two to three years," said Head Coach Joe Piane. "Loyola's front three runners will be very good. Based upon how banged up we are and how they (Loyola) ran at the National Catholic, they should be the team to beat." 
OnE!-of the problems with the team la~ly is that the Irish have not run aggressively. It let USC take the initiative in Southern California and never really got back into the race. 
"Being aggressive, getting out of the deadwood and getting in front from the gun are the keys to running well at this meet," said Piane. "The run­ners must also run more as a team, and in large part how we do will depend on our fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh run­ners." 
The team looks ready for the challenge. Its workouts this week have been strong, and runners such as Ryan Cahill and Tom O'Rourke have trained especially well, accor­ding to Garrett. 
"We're working out with a little more aggressiveness," said Garrett. "We're just pumped up for the race. We really want to do well and prove that we can run better than we have been." 

More people have survived cancer than now live in the City of Los Angeles.

Danny Gordon (6) and the Notre Dame soccer team travel to Miami this weekend for the Florida International Gatorade Classic. The Irish will face both Penn State and Boston University during this 
By TIM SULLIVAN Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame soccer team is facing possibly the most im­portant weekend of its season. 
Notre Dame will particpate in the Florida International Gatorade Classic at Miami aiming to end a slide of three losses in four games and to turn the heads of the NCAA Tourn­ament selection committee. 
The Irish, 11-3-2, left on Thursday for Miami, where they will take on Penn State and Boston University. 
Both teams sport excellent records entering the competi­tion. Boston University has been ranked as high as 16th in the nation and is looking for its third tournament berth in four years. 
It's that type of competition which Irish coach Dennis Grace feels could help his team in the long run. 
"Those (tough, non-region) games can only help us," said Grace. 
Unfortunately, the Irish did not take advantage of two similar opportunities last week with losses to College of Charleston and Rutgers. Now, Notre Dame's back is against the wall. One win is a must, with two wins almost a neces­sity. 
Stategically, Grace could have a surprise for his weekend opponents. In last week's matches, a man-to-man attack proved successful in both second halves, and Grace may experiment with a full 90 minutes of pressure. 
"We pulled our sweeper," noted Grace of the strategy move. "We decided to put our athleticism against theirs, and we really took it to them." 
Notre Dame will be led by a trio of senior scoring machines in Bruce "Tiger" McCourt, Joe Sternberg and Randy Morris. The three have steadily moved up the all-time Irish scoring charts, and hold the four, five and six spots among the regional scoring leaders. 
Notre Dame's season-long goal has been an NCAA berth. The key to strengthening those chances could be found in Miami.

is optimistic about the team's 
chances to win, especially after 
the victory at USC. 
"Everyone on the team is 
really positive about how we'll 
do," said Murray. "The USC 
meet was a big boost. We know 
now that we can run well to­
gether." 
Captain Theresa Rice 
backed this up. 
"There will be good compe­
tition, but we should win," she 
said. 
The team might feel the loss of Terry Kibelstis, a senior who will miss the race with a leg injury. Sophomore Jenny Ledrick, who sat out the first part of the season, will run, and Coach Tim Connelly says that she is in good shape. The rest of the team is at full strength. 
With the absence of Kibeis tis, the Irish will need good perfor­mances from Rice, Lucy Nus­raJa and Linda Filar, who have been the top three runners on the team so far this season. The Irish also should get support from Murray, Terese Lemanski and Kevaleen Ryan. The tlSC meet was the first race this year when the lower half of the lineup made a sig­nificant contribution, and knowing that they can help will be important. 
"We've learned to work with each other," said Murray. "We're closer as a team, and that makes us stronger." 
The overall outlook for the Irish is good, according to Con­nelly. 
"I feel that if we can beat 
Dayton 
we can win," he said.

"Thou shall not pass" could be Army's motto this season. 
Since Coach Jim Young in­stalled the wishbone offense in 1984, the Cadets are 22-0 when they throw six passes or less, 31-4 when they throw nine times or less. When they put the ball in the air more than nine times, their record is a sorry 3-14-1. 
To paraphrase an old gag, Army is first in war, first in peace and last among the na­tion's 104 Division I-A teams in passing offense. In seven games, of which they have won six, the Cadets have thrown just 39 passes and completed 16 for an average of 56 yards a game. But they are third in rushing with a 377-yard average. 
Rutgers, which beat Mic­higan State and Penn State, was Army's latest victim, fal­ling 34-24 last Saturday. With Air Force, Vanderbilt, Boston College and Navy left, a 10-1 season is certainly possible.

said Schafer. "I wouldn't be surprised if they were on a par with St. Cloud State." 
Notre Dame split a two-game series at St. Cloud State last weekend. 
Scott Brown, who led RIT in points last year, is one of the 
of discipline simply by the na­
ture of their institution," Rut­
gers coach Dick Anderson said. 
"The wishbone, I think, is 
tailored to their temper, tail­
ored to their institution, be­
cause it involves an extreme 
amount of discipline. I think 
they play it exceptionally well. 
"They're not very big up 
front offensively or defensive­
ly, and yet they come after you 
very tough, very tough." 
Coach Bob Ricca of St. John's 
(N.Y.) University has seen 
both sides of the NCAA's new 
conversion rule which allows 
the defensive team to score two 
points. 
Earlier in the season, with 
the score tied 24-24, the Red­
men blocked an extra-point at­
tempt by Iona and ran it all the 
way for two points and a 26-24 
victory. 
Last Saturday, C.W. Post 
scored a touchdown to pull 
within 21-20 and lined up for an 
extra point that could have tied 
the young season. Bankoske has five assists, while Herber has two goals and two assists. Schafer said he plans to make some changes in the lines for this weekend's games. With Alaska-Anchorage having scored four shorthanded goals on Tuesday, Schafer also is in­serting a different power play unit. He had five forwards on the power play in Tuesday's 
returning players. Brown game. scored 21 goals with 30 assists "We'll have a different last season. Other top scorers power play setup with a couple returning are center Chris Pal-more defensemen," said the game. 
St. John's blocked it, but this 
time the ball bounced right 
back to holder Tim Mcintee, 
who alertly passed to tight end 
Todd Hokunson in the end zone. 
Instead of a 21-21 tie, Post led 
22-21 and went on to win 29-21. 
"Although we do not have a designed play for a blocked ex­tra point, we do have a play called 'Red-Red' for botched field goals where the ball recoverer throws to the tight end," Coach Tom Marshall said. "I give Tim a lot of credit. He had the wherewithal to regroup and make a great play." 
Mcintee is better known as a three-time All-American lacrosse player and is playing collegiate football for the first time. 
In addition, he is a defensive back who ranked among the Division III leaders with seven interceptions in five games. 
Schafer. "It (five forwards) contributes to our offensive po­tential, but it's potentially dis­astrous too, and we paid dearly for it. "That's a bad lesson, and we don't want it to happen again."

NO lacrosse hosts Johns Hopkins tonight 
.. 
By PETE LaFLEUR Sports Writer 

The excitement and anticipa­tion surrounding the Notre Dame lacrosse game tonight against John Hopkins Univer­sity can be seen in something as simple as door prizes. 
The prizes to be awarded ac­cording to program numbers and the halftime shootout in­clude Notre Dame lacrosse sticks and sweatshirts, two general admission tickets to the Penn State football game and a pizza a month for a year from Godfather's Pizza.

ND to host Tom Fallon Invitational 
By BOB MITCHELL 
Sports Writer 

In honor of the grandfather of Notre Dame men's tennis, Notre Dame hosts the Tom Fal­lon-Notre Dame Invitational this weekend at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
"I thought you had to be dead to have a tournament named after you and I'm not quite there yet," said Fallon, who coached both the tennis and wrestling teams at Notre Dame. 
Fallon, the winningest coach 
in Irish history, coached the 
men's team for 31 years (1957­
1987). Fallon posted a 517-200 
during his reign. He also estab­
lished the Irish wrestling pro­
gram and coached that team 
for 15 years. 

"It is a very great honor for 
me," said Fallon who was in­
ducted into the collegiate ten­
nis Hall of Fame this past Au­
gust. "It will be a homecoming 
of sorts, since I know some of 
the opposing coaches and 
players." 

Current Irish coach Bob 
Bayliss had this to say about 
Fallon: 
see FALLON, page 16 



many refer to as "the Notre Dame of college lacrosse." 

Although the official NCAA season does not begin until the spring, first-year Notre Dame coach Kevin Corrigan said the Irish will be "doing everything we can to win the game." Faceoff will be 6:30p.m. at Ed­ward J. "Moose" Krause Stadium or the Loftus Center, depending on the weather. 
The Irish will be trying to fuse the leadership of senior tri­captains John Olmstead, Kevin. O'Connor and Doug Spencer with an experienced defense and a very young midfield. 
Olmstead once again will lead the Irish attack. Olmstead led the team in scoring last season with 33 goals and 25 as-
Kevin O'Connor 

sists, and he is the fifth leading scorer in Irish history. Addi­tionally, Olmstead holds Irish records for total points in a game (nine) and assists in a game (seven). 
"John is an outstanding indi· vidual and will be very impor­tant to our success this year," said Corrigan. "He hasn't played much this fall, but he makes good decisions on the field and we need him in prac­tice to make the whole team better.'' 
Playing alongside Olmstead will be juniors Brian McHugh and Rob Lynn. McHugh, the team's strongman, was second in scoring last season and one of the team leaders in ground balls. Lynn, who Corrigan says has been a pleasant surprise, will be making his first start after seeing limited action last spring. 
Lynn will be starting for fel­low junior Dave Carey, who is nursing an ankle injury. Cor­rigan said Carey still should be able to contribute. 
The Irish midfield warrants the greatest concern with 10 of last years midfielders lost to graduation, injury, cuts and re­positioning. Most notable is the loss of last year's tri-captains, who composed the first middie­line. This year's line contains no seniors and only one junior (Mike Quigley). 
Quigley will be starting alongside sophomore John Capano and freshman Chris Nelson. The second middie line has an all-freshman look with Brian Shirf, Mike Sullivan, and Doug Murray.

NO volleyball action in South Dome 
By MOLLY MAHONEY Sports Writer 
Cornhuskers might not be the most intimidating mascots, but they are some of the toughest volleyball players in the country. 
The Notre Dame women's volleyball team will find out how tough they really are as they take on the Cornhuskers tonight in the Joyce ACC. 
The Irish, 11-8 after defeating Ohio State in three games Tues­day night, will try to claim their third top 20 victim of the season against Nebraska. 
Notre Dame beat Kentucky, which was ranked seventh at the time, and Pacific, then ­ranked 15th, and now faces a sixth-ranked Nebraska team that holds a 3-0 advantage over the Irish in their series history. 
Nebraska is 18-3 thus far in the season, with its losses com­ing at the hands of top 20 power­houses San Diego State, Illinois and Oklahoma. 
The Cornhuskers have shucked their last seven oppo­

games at the Joyce ACC. 
"It's time for our hockey team to make amends," said Schafer. "I think it (Tuesday) was just a bad night. Now it's over, and we carry on. Better play is ahead of us." 
RIT, a Division III school, opens its first season under new coach Buddy Powers this weekend. The Tigers return 20 players from last year's 14-15-1 team.

The Notre Dame hockey team enters its first home weekend series tonight hoping to keep last Tuesday's home opener in the past. 
Alaska-Anchorage buried the Irish 8-3 last Tuesday in what Notre Dame coach Ric Schafer termed "a collectively poor ef­fort." The Irish will need to be in much better form if they are to challenge the Rochester In­stitute of Technology this weekend. Faceoff is 7:30p.m. for both Friday and Saturday's

A number of things could happen between now and after the Notre Dame-Penn State game on Nov. 19, when bowl bids are officially extended. But right now the Fiesta Bowl looks to have the best oppor­tunity to attract the 7-0, second-ranked Irish. 
Assuming Notre Dame takes care of Navy and Rice (a bold prediction if ever there was one) and then beats Penn State in the final home game of the season, two teams could be in a position to make Tempe attractive to the Irish on Jan. 2: 
West Virginia: The Mountaineers probably would face Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl if they remain undefeated. But that won't be an easy task. The No. 7 team in the nation takes on Penn State, Rut­gers and Syracuse before bowl bids are extended. 
Florida State: The No. 6 Seminoles also are in the Fiesta hunt, but must travel to South Carolina next weekend, then get past Virginia Tech at home before the bids go out. 
Keep in mind that these scenarios are only valid if the Irish remain unbeaten over the next three ames. 
One great thing about the Fiesta Bowl is that if the Irish play in it, Miami will not. Sorry, Jimmy. No rematch. 
The Pac-10 and Big Ten have announced that the runners-up in those two conferences will not accept bids because the Fiesta Bowl airs on NBC television in the same time slot the Rose Bowl holds on ABC­TV.

The time might be changing, however, if the Fiesta can set up a game for the national title (which would exclude the USC-UCLA loser, anyway). In addition, assuming Notre Dame and West Virginia or Florida State win the rest of their games, a loss by UCLA somewhere almost certainly would be necessary for the Fiesta to stage a national title game. 
"If we're able to match up a 1 vs. 2, or 1 vs. 3, and we believe it would de ermine the national 
championship, we would seriously consider movin~t 
the game to prime time on either Jan. 1 or Jan. 3," 
Fiesta team-selection chairman Don Meyers said. 
This arrangement was made two seasons ago 
when Penn State defeated Miami in the Fiesta 
Bowl's national championship matchup on Jan. 2. 
All the other major bowls were played on New 
Year's Day, as usual. 
Blocking such a move is an NCAA agreement with the bowls not to change the date, time or site of the bowl games after Sept. 1. The NCAA probably would stop the move unless the Fiesta Bowl could prove that it would be helpful to more than just the Fiesta Bowl (ie. helping the Rose Bowl ratings). 
Of course, if West Virginia and Florida State are tripped up during the next few weeks, a date with Nebraska or Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl, a return trip to the Cotton Bowl for a game with Arkansas, or a visit to the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans to meet the Southeastern Conference champion might be­come attractive to the Notre Dame Athletic Depar­tment. 
I hope I don't have to go through this many options at the travel a enc ...or the Tern a· ort.
