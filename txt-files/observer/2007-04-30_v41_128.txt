Following White's journey to ND 
By KEN FOWLER News Writer 
Editor's note: This is the second story in a four-part series looking at Notre Dame's athletic depart­ment under the direction ofKevin White as he enters his eighth year at the school. 
Now entrenched at Notre Dame for more than seven years, Kevin White's career once seemed far less stable. 
He was a star among young athletic directors, both an image­changer and a fund-raiser, sought by schools looking for a fresh face with a track record of success. By his mid-40s, White was exactly what colleges want­ed, and at no time was that more evident than in the summer of 1997. 
Just a year into his tenure at Arizona State, Division I-A uni­versities were once again calling to see if White would be interest­ed in leaving the ever-improving school. But White's answer was always ti)e same, even if univer­sity presidents tried their hardest to make it change. 
In his first year at Arizona State, the Sun Devils football team went 11-1, falling three points short of a national champi­onship with a 20-17 loss to Ohio State in the Rose Bowl. Donations went through the roof. 
That led to many would-be suitors, something White never denied. In the search for success and self-sufficiency -and a clean, spirited face to guide an athletic department -the 46­year-old White was a natural fit.

Liberal arts grads go off beaten path· 
Arts and Letters professors build careers after unorthodox job diversions 
By EMMA DRISCOLL 
News Writer 

As Arts and Letters seniors approach graduation, they must determine the answer to a ques­tion with which they are no doubt familiar -what can they do with their majors? 
Notre Dame Arts and Letters professors faced the same ques­tion when they were liberal arts undergraduates. While they even­tually pursued careers in acade­mia, their experiences demon­strate the wide variety of uses for an Arts and Letters degree.

Faculty withholds 2008 ca:mpaign donations 
By JOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
While potential candidates for the 2008 presidential election have already begun touring the country and making appearances at rallies and talk shows, the elec­tion frenzy has yet to reach Notre Dame. 
As of Thursday, no Notre Dame professor had made aiJ.Y donations to any campaign, according to the Federal Election Committee (FEC). This lack of donations follows the trend observed in the 2004 presi­dential election, when only five Notre Dame professors and no Saint Mary's professors donated to campaigns. 
That's a striking contrast to the behavior of faculty members at other prestigious universities, as 130 professors at Georgetown made donations in 2004, and 18 have donated already to 2008 campaigns. 
Georgetown, however, could arguably be expected to display a heightened political involvement, given its location in Washington and the high number of former government officials that serve the university as professors -includ­ing the father of presidential can­didate Christopher Dodd. Boston College, however, al<>o outnumbers Notre Dame in its faculty's political donations. In 2004, 38 Boston College faculty members donated to presidential campaigns, and seven have already donated in the current election cycle. 
Additionally, at Northwestern, 115 faculty members donated for

Notre Dame is recognized for its academics and its athletics, and Notre Dame student-athletes have demonstrated again that they ar'e not mutually exclu­sive attributes. 
The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) released its Annual Progress Report for U.S col­leges this week and Notre Dame athletes have once again ranked high in aca­demic excellence when com­pared to peer institutions. 
Eleven Notre Dame teams were honored for academic distinction -men's basket­ball, men's cross country, men's fencin·g, men's golf, men's indoor track and field, men's outdoor track and field, women's fencing, women's soccer, women's softball, women's tennis and women's volleyball. 

Only the U.S. Naval Academy, Boston College and Stanford had more teams honored for academic performance Duke University and Rice University also had eleven programs honored. 
This isn't unusual for Notre Dame, said Senior Associate Athletics Director John Heisler.

NDASK gathers experts 
ByJENN METZ News Writer 

Notre Dame Against State Killing (NDASK) held a forum Saturday and Sunday called -"Achieving the Inevitable: Ending the Death Penalty in Indiana" -giving speakers and students a chance to dis­cuss, learn and focus on the develop­ments the club has made over the past year. 
A group of 


s t u d e n t s McNally formed NDASK last fall through the Center for Social Concerns with the goal of achieving a mora­torium on the death penalty in Indiana by building a statewide 
network of support for the cause. 
The conference this weekend was a conclusion to the club's work during its first year. NDASK has about 30 active student mem­bers and a newsletter readership of 200 working to fight the death penalty through education. 
Speakers at the conference included top experts on the death penalty in Indiana. Priests and lawyers, like Father Tom McNally, a Holy Cross priest and volunteer chaplain at the Michigan City Prison, and Chris Hitz-Bradley of the Indiana Information Center on the Abolition of Capital Punishment spoke on campus this weekend. 
Junior Andrea Laidman, co­director of NDASK, said the forum turned into an unexpected sununit

No dessert, please

jump in the past decade. Why are we dishing out more sums of cash for dishes that haven't really changed in the past few years? 
True, population growth calls for more mouths to feed and raises the demand for outside dining ifit's less time consuming or expensive than preparing meals at home. But the real reason is that restau­rants possess some wily marketing tac­tics to lure the watering mouths -and wallets -ofthe American people. 
One popular trick is the "dress-ups" for dishes and beverages, where you fork over cash for a meal worth four times as much as it cost the restaurant to prepare. Coffees, teas, and sodas costs them no more than 15 to 20 cents a serving, yet even moderately priced restaurants charge up to $2.50 for these beverages, often without free refills. 
The rip-off value multiplies with main course meals. Pasta literally costs pen­nies for restaurants, but with fixings like sauce or vegetables, they can be "dressed up" and sold for $25 a dish or more. Additionally, restaurants will juxtapose a $15 pa<>ta dish on the menu with a $21 chicken dish, and then the customer will fall for the trap, opting for the pasta mis­takenly thinking they've found a bargain. 
Watch out for fishy things with seafood. These items tend to be the priciest on menus ifyou're not at a renowned seafood restaurant or chain, and you might not get what you expect. Many cus­tomers fall for the illusion of "Maryland crab cakes" that never came from the Chesapeake Bay at all. 
Maryland-style crab? Come on. Your crabs were most likely imported from Thailand or Vietnam at a frighteningly cheaper price than what you paid. Also, sometimes restaurants substitute inex­pensive fish, such as pollock, for some­thing pricier, such as cod. 
You might want to remember to pro­tect your arteries as well. Ifyou think that a seafood, pasta and salad dish is "healthier" because you're avoiding red meat and cholesterol, think again. No limitation on butter usually means the average restaurant meal carries a sick­ening load of 1,000-1,500 calories. For instance, a burger at restaurant like Ruby Tuesday contains twice as many calories and fat grams as McDonald's Big Mac. 
Be wary about how much you tip. In many restaurants, the 10 dollars that you offered gratuitously to the nice, pretty waitress may not make it home with her after all -instead, it may be divided up amongst the bartender, the apprentice waiter, etc. "Tip pools," as they are called, especially take in effect when restaurants state a 20% service charge for larger parties. 
Now, this isn't to discourage you from eating out at restaurants -be adventur­ous! Try new things, new restaurants, and get some fresh air with the family. However, don't let your guard down. Check restaurant reviews, customer sat­isfaction ratings or seek advice from trustworthy friends, otherwise you may end up doing yourself more harm than good.

Tunick said last month that 3,700 participants had registered for the shoot. On Sunday, he said more were signing up but declined to give a figure.

Seniors give recitals at SMC 
Vocal performance majors take part in 'unique experience,' display talents 
By KATIE KOHLER 
Saint Mq,ry's Editor 
While their classmates write papers and complete exams on their way to graduation, senior vocal performance majors at Saint Mary's face a different fmal obstacle -the senior recital. 
Laurel Thomas, associate pro­fessor of music and the voice and opera instructor in the depart­ment, said the recitals are a unique experience for seniors. 
"This has been one of the most wonderful years of my teaching career, due in great part to these four students who have been such a privilege and a joy to teach," she said. 
This year, the performance majors are Katelyn Wood, Mallory O'Brien, Erin Anhut and Lindsey Anderson. 
Not all music majors are required .to give a recital, although they are required to complete composition projects, which are "an in-depth historical and theoretical analysis of a composition," Thomas said. 
"Only the performance majors are required to give a full-length senior recital," she said. 
Each semester, these perform­ance majors are also required to perform a "jury" in front of the music department faculty. A jury involves a high-level perform­ance of the repertoire studied each semester, Anderson said. Performance majors are required to perform half a recital their junior year and a full recital senior year. 
"All of these requirements are what contribute to an exception­al department that is fully accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM)," she said. 
Thomas' role is to help them choose their repertoire. 
"Students sing arias and songs from four historical time periods in four languages -Italian, French, German and English," she said. 
This requirement is a daunting task for the seniors. 
"Being a senior music major and preparing for a recital is both demanding and exciting," Wood said. "Not only do we have to learn how to speak clearly in different languages, but we also have to know each translation of the musical text and how to relate it to the audience." 
Wood's recital was based on folk songs in Czech and Russian as well as the four required lan­guages. 
"This year, every one of my stu­dents chose repertoire very spe­cific to her personality and vocal strengths," Thomas · said. "Mallory [O'Brien] loves the smoky salon music of Poi.Ilenc and the voluptuous melodies of Strauss. Erin [Anhut] stole the show with her comic abilities throughout her recital and, while singing beautifully, gave the most convincing portrayal of the Doll's aria from Tales of Hoffman that I have ever seen or heard." 
She had similar praise for Anderson. 
"Lindsey [Anderson] is headed for a professional career," she said. "On Sunday, she [sang] one of the most exquisite song cycles of Schumann." 
Besides the performance itself, seniors are also wholly responsi­ble for planning and executing their recitals. 
"Planning for the recital requires much more work than many people realize," Anderson said. "In addition to singing, the performers have to design posters, arrange for technical assistance in the theater, handle all publicity and plan a reception if they choose to have one. Even though it is a lot of work, it is done with a smile." 
Wood planned her recital while at home over se:(llester break. 
"Unlike Lindsey [Anderson], I was not fundraising and handled everything at home," Wood said. "My parents and voice teacher helped me." 
Anderson relied on assistance from the communications department to publicize her recital. 
"I am very fortunate to have [public relations commissioner] Alanna Chiefari to help with pub­licity," she said. "Her knowledge of public relations has been so helpful and a wonderful way to create a liaison between our two departments."

ating from the University of Oregon with a major in philoso­phy. 
"I just wanted jobs that were low commitment and gave me lots of free time, so I bussed tables and I baked bagels,. and then I worked for a research and development firm," Ramsey said. 
So for eight months, Ramsey worked as the expediter at a com­pany building a laser as part of Ronald Reagan's Star Wars pro­gram during the Cold War. 
"It's a crazy job," Ramsey said. "But it just shows you how a phi­losophy major can kind of wind up doing things you would never expect." 
Although he was looking for­ward to being laid-off after the laser was finished so he could travel and climb, Ramsey was sur­prised when the company asked him to stay on as an engineer ­even after his boss and other members of the company had been fired. 
But since the laser "[didn't] do anything except discolor some tis­sue paper," Ramsey decided it was time to move on. 
While Ramsey spent time work­ing low-commitment jobs after graduation, he believes his philos­ophy degree would have made him a qualified candidate for a professional career after gradua­tion if that was what he had want­ed to do. 

"The thing that was holding me back was I didn't want to go the serious career route just then," he said. "If I decided that I really wanted to go into business or something like that, I wouldn't have had any real problem." 
English professor and published author Valerie Sayers taught eco­nomics at a new technical college -even though she graduated from Fordham with a degree in psychology. The technical college "desperately needed somebody to teach social science courses," Sayers said, explaining why she was hired with just a bachelor's degree. 
"They asked me if I could teach economics and I said 'sure,"' Sayers said. "I just read the text­book as fast as I could." 
Originally, Sayers had planned to go to graduate school to become a clinical psychologist, but plans changed when she realized toward the end of her college career that she wanted to be a writer. 
"I took a year of my life [after undergraduate school] to decide whether I could be a writer and take a kind of minimal earning and write every day," she said. This was when she moved back to her home town and took the teaching job. 
Although Sayers considered this a sort of "test year," she was anx­ious as to how things would turn out. 
"I was terrified. I was scared to death because my original plan had been very professional," she said. "To be a psychologist was a clear path ... but to be a writer seemed to have no path whatsoev­er. It was as if I had to hack out my own path." 
Unlike Ramsey and Sayers, music professor Alexander Blachly knew that he wanted to attend graduate school right after graduating from Haverford College with a B.A. in music and a concentration in composition. 
Blachly went straight to Columbia, where he received a Master's degree in historical musi­cology in 1972 and then a Ph.D. in 1995 with the intention of being "an academic." Blachly, however, also founded the professional singing ensemble Pomerium in New York, which he still directs. 
"My career path has not been typical. ... I had always had a dual career, even as a graduate stu­dent, as a performer and as an academic," he said. For Blachly, having two careers makes his situ­ation "a little unusual." 
Performance was not something Blachly expected to pursue when he was an undergraduate. He said he thought that performing would be a "sideline" to a career in academia. 
Since he had already been accepted to Columbia's graduate program at the time he graduated from Haverford, Blachly said he did not face much anxiety over what the years following his grad­uation would bring. 
"That part of my future -those immediate next few years -was already mapped out for me," he said. "I only applied to one gradu­ate school. My feeling was that I wanted to go there, and if I didn't go there, I would do something else. That's also not very common and probably not very sensible looking back on it, but that's what I did." 
Department of Film, Television and Theater assistant professor Christine Becker never planned to become a professor when she went to gradu­ate school after appointment [to a job]," he said.

China fails to improve human rights 
BEIJING -China has failed to live up to promises to improve human rights for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing despite reforms to the death penalty system and more freedoms for foreign reporters, Amnesty International said in a report Monday. 
The report catalogs a wide range of persistent abuses, from extensive use of detention without trial to the persecution of civil rights activists and new methods to rein in the domestic media and censor the Internet. 
The London-based group welcomed the new rules for foreign journalist and the referral of all death sentences to China's Supreme Court since the start of the year. 
"Disappointingly, they have been matched by moves to expand detention without trial and house arrest of activists, and by a tightening of controls over domestic media and the Internet," Catherine Baber, deputy Asia-Pacific director of Amnesty International, said in a statement. 
Iran to attend conference on Iraq 
BAGHDAD -Iran agreed Sunday to join the 
U.S. and other countries at a conference on Iraq this week, raising hopes the government in Tehran would help stabilize its violent neighbor and stem the flow of guns and bombs over the border. 
In an apparent effort to drive home that point, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki told an Iranian envoy that the persistent violence in Iraq ­some of it carried out by the Shiite militias Iran is accused of arming -could spill over into neighboring countries, including those that are "supposed to support the Iraqi government." 
Iraq's other neighbors as well as Egypt, Bahrain and representatives of the five pernla­nent U.N. Security Council members have agreed to attend the meeting Thursday.

3 dead, 2 wounded in mall shooting 
KANSAS CITY, Mo -A shooting at a shop­ping center Sunday afternoon left three peo­ple dead, including the gunman, police said. 
Two people were shot about 3:30p.m. in the parking lot of the Ward Parkway Center, according to police. Then, the gun­man went inside the mall and fired more shots, wounding at least two people, police spokesman Tony Sanders said. 
The man was shot to death inside the mall, Sanders said. Police fired shots, but it was not immediately clear if he was killed by police. 

Highway bridge collapses after crash 
OAKLAND, Calif. -A stretch of highway near the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge collapsed Sunday after a gasoline tanker crashed and burst into flames, leaving one of the nation's busiest spans in a state of near paralysis. Officials said traffic could be dis­rupted for months. 
Flames shot 200 feet in the air and the heat was intense enough to melt part of the freeway and cause the collapse, but the truck's driver walked away from the scene with second-degree burns. No other injuries were reported. 
"I've never seen anything like it," Officer Trent Cross of the California Highway Patrol said of the crumpled interchange. ''I'm look­ing at this thinking, 'Wow, no one died ­that's amazing. It's just very fortunate."

Slot machines could provide tax relief 
INDIANAPOUS -Lawmakers appeared clos­er to a deal Sunday to allow slot machines at Indiana's two horse racing tracks -a move that would funnel more than $500 million toward property tax relieffor homeowners. 
It would be Indiana's biggest expansion of gambling since the Legislature authorized river­boat casinos in 1993, but lawmakers were work­ing on another bill to crack down on illegal gam­bling elsewhere. That proposal would step up enforcement against illegal video gambling machines sometimes found in back rooms of bars, gas stations, truck stops and other loca­tions.

Demonstrators demand resignation 
700,000 march against pro-Islamic government, call prime minister a 'traitor' 
Associated Press 

ISTANBUL -At least 700,000 people marched Sunday in a massive protest against the possi­ble election of an obser­vant Muslim as president, a conflict that is pitting Turkey's religiously orient­ed ruling party against the deeply secular military and civilian establishment. 
Waving the country's red flag and singing national­ist songs, demonstrators in Istanbul demanded the resignation of the pro­Islamic government, call­ing Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan a traitor. Erdogan's foreign minis­ter, Abdullah Gul, is wide­ly expected to win the presidential election by the country's 550-seat parliament.

WIND RIVER INDIAN RESER­VATION, Wyo -Just off the deserted highways, the silver pickup truck eases down quiet streets, its driver offering a numbing tour of a remote reser­vation framed by the beauty of snowcapped mountains. 
There, Leon Tillman says, over there -the house on the right, a white, two-story building set off by itself. It used to be a big drug house. Now it's shut­tered, its owners in prison. 
A man dressed in an army green shirt and pants appears on the side of the road, his thumb up, looking for a ride. "That's a meth head," Tillman says. "He's bumming right now." 
A few more drug houses and Tillman's tour of the despair of methamphetamine ends. 
Not long ago, most people here had never even heard of meth. But today, most know someone on meth or in prison because of it. Tillman, 39, knows too many to count. 
"It''s everywhere," he said. 
Indeed, American Indians have been especially hard hit by meth. Drug cartels have target­ed Indian Country because the people are vulnerable, and law enforcement struggles to keep up.

' 
I But the story of how meth
I 
:-came to this remote reservation

 is really quite remarkable.
I 
I Like a cancer, a Mexican drug gang permeated the reservation and its families. It left behind a landscape strewn with broken lives. Some 12,000 Indians -mem­bers of the Northern Arapaho and the Eastern Shoshone tribes -live on 2.2 million acres, an area so vast many homes are separated by miles of barren land. Poverty and unemployment are high, alcoholism is rampant and the police department is so understaffed -patrolling such a large area -that the average response time is 15 to 20 min­utes. Jesus Martin Sagaste-Cruz knew that. And he knew the reservation's isolation would be perfect for his business. Authorities learned of the Sagaste-Cruz drug ring back in 1997. Sagaste-Cruz and his Mexican gang had already been selling around Indian reserva­tions in South Dakota and Nebraska. But it was an article in The Denver Post that changed the way they did business. The story talked about how a Nebraska liquor store near the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota did 
millions of dollars in business. Sales were especially high immediately after Indians received their per capita checks -their share of their tribe's income. 
Sagaste-Cruz figured if there were already so many Indians addicted to alcohol, it would be easy enough to addict them to methamphetamine. 
So around 2000, the Mexicans moved in and near Wind River Reservation. 
"They came to a place where people don't have anything," said Frances Monroe, who works in the Northern Arapaho Child Protection Services office. 
They started with free meth samples. The men pursued Indian women, providing them with meth even as they romanced them and fathered their children. Eventually, the women needed to support their habit, so they became dealers, too-and they used free sam­ples to recruit new customers. 
It was all part of the plan. 
For the next four years, the gang sold pounds and pounds of meth, much of it 98 percent pure. The drugs came from Mexico, then on to Los Angeles; Ogden, Utah (where Sagaste­Cruz lived); and finally Wyoming, where gang members had a handful of local distribu­tors, each with their own cus­tomer base. 
Customers became dealers and recruiters, and their cus­tomers did the same. 
Before, meth was barely men­tioned on the reservation. Police reported only sporadic arrests. 
But now the reservation was saturated with it. Crime soared; From 2003 to 2006, cases of child neglect increased 131 per­cent. Drug possession was up 163 percent; spousal abuse rose 218 percent. 
The Wind River reservation is not alone. The Bureau of Indian Affairs found that methamphet­amine was listed as the greatest threat to Indian communities by police departments. 
Mexican drug cartels take advantage of the often compli­cated law enforcement jurisdic­tions in Indian Country. Isolated communities are hit the hardest, and sometimes even tribal lead­ers are not immune, said Heather Dawn Thompson, director of government affairs for the National Congress of American Indians. 
Here on the Wind River, a trib­al judge, Lynda Munnell-Noah, was arrested in a 2005 drug ring bust and accused of trying to assault and murder a Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforce­ment officer.

2004 campaigns, and 20 have already donated for 2008, including 16 who are financially supporting Barack Obama's candidacy. 
Notre Dame clearly lags behind competing universities in providing monetary support to candidates, but this lack of faculty contributions to campaigns is not a sign of political apathy on campus, College Republicans president Sarah Way said. 
"I believe if you were to look up the contributions that were not financial, you would see a number of professors who actually worked for campaigns," she said. 
The five Notre Dame professors that did write checks in 2004 did not lack political fervor either. 
Philosophy professor Michael DetlefSen, one of four faculty mem­bers who donated to John Kerry's campaign in 2004, was emphatic about hi<> reasons for donating. He said he believed President George W Bush is "incompetent and cor­rupt" and "easily the worst presi­dent in my voting lifetime," and said he has been "reckless with the lives

and welfare of both many Americans and many Iraqis." 
Detlefsen, however, said he had not decided yet if he would lend his financial support to a candidate in 2008. 
"I may support a candidate in the next election, but I don't know yet whether I will," he said. "If I do, it will be someone I think is of high moral character, who will seek peace rather than war, and who will make meaningful efforts towards addressing the mounting crisis in health care in America." 
Detlefsen said he thinks it is too early to support a candidate at this point in the election cycle, but that he will not necessarily wait until the general election kicks off to donate to a campaign. 
English professor Stephan Fredman, who also donated to Kerry's campaign in 2004, said he believes that it is his civic duty to be active in politics and that he will donate to somebody in 2008. 
"I don't yet have a favored presi­dential candidate, though, so I will wait to donate until I find one ­which may be either before or after the primary election," Fredman said. 
Way said she was not surprised by the professors' support of the

Daniels has not yet announced whether he will reject Woods' application for clemency. 
NDASK hopes to continue its education about the death penalty in the coming years, Laidman said, and has "incredible people lined up to come [next year]." 
Students will continue to build a network and lobby for their desired moratorium with Daniels and leaders from their political dis­tricts, Laidman said.

"Notre Dame may have a general reputation as being conservative, but I am not sure this represents both the faculty and the students," she said. 
The fifth professor that made a campaign donation in 2004 to sup­port Bush's reelection bid, Patrick Schlitz, is no longer associated with the University. 
Generally, the number of faculty members at rural colleges who donate to political campaigns ­even at the local level -pales in comparison with those who donate at universities located in larger met­ropolitan areas, according to the FEC Web site. 
It's important faculty members stay uninvolved with political financ­ing, Way said, since their primary job is to teach students. 
"I am not surprised, nor con­cerned, with Notre Dame profes­sors' lack of donations to cam­paigns," she said. "In fact, this sepa­ration from 'party politics' is a very good thing." 
Impartial professors make it easi­er for students to develop their own political opinions, she said.

Microsoft third quarter profits rise 
SEATTLE -Microsoft Corp.'s fiscal third­quarter profit jumped 65 percent, buoyed by sales of its new versions of Windows and Office and by upgrade coupons for the operat­ing system issued over the holidays. 
Earnings for the quarter ended March 31 rose to $4.93 billion, or 50 cents per share, from $2.98 billion, or 29 cents per share in same period last year. 
Results included legal charges amounting to 1 cent per share, but tax benefits boosted profit by 2 cents per share. 
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial forecast a profit of 46 cents per share. 
Revenue for the quarter rose 32 percent to $14.4 billion. Wall Street was looking for $13.89 billion in sales. 
Microsoft started selling its newest operating system, Windows Vista, to consumers at the end of January. Its "client" division, responsi­ble for Windows, brought in $5.27 billion in sales, 67 percent higher than a year ago. 

Farmers experiment with biodiesel 
LOS ANGELES -California farmers are hoping to strike oil -vegetable oil, that is -with a series of experimental trials involving crops that can be processed into biodiesel. 
Some of the efforts to produce the sought-after fuel call for growing hearty crops such as canola on unproductive land that can't support higher­value produce. 
Other farmers are eyeing oilseed plants as a cover crop that might improve soil quality between more profitable plantings of berries or leafy greens. 
Researchers have even started experimenting with varieties of algae that can be farmed in ponds and converted into biodiesel. 
"We have one of the world's most fertile and pro­ductive growing regions," said Salinas Mayor Dennis Donohue, a radicchio farmer. "It doesn't make any sense that we shouldn't be involved in the future that's shaping up." 
The trials are being conducted as high gas prices and stringent environmental regulations drive the market for alternative energy sources such as biodiesel. Derived from vegetable oils and other sources, the fuel is used to run diesel engines that have undergone slight modifications.

Organic baby food market grows 
Concerned parents accountfor increase in sales, prompt companies to expand offerings 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Pauline Ameli-Nash worried that the pesticides and additives used to grow and preserve food were bad for her 1­year-old daughter Sophia, not to mention the earth itself. That's why the pureed carrots, sweet potatoes and fruits Sophia ate were pur­chased from makers of organic baby food. 
"She is so small I just thought that the more pure, honest things she ate would be better for her," the Claremont, Calif., mother said. "I also thought it bene­fits the environment. I want to raise my child with an idea of social responsibility." 
The environment has become a very hot topic these days, especially among parents who want to protect their children's health and the world they'll be inheriting. Parents like Ameli-Nash are propelling a surge in organic baby food sales, and that has prompt­ed more companies to either join or expand their offer­ings in the sector.

The Bush administration and its cronies have directed a huge portion of their resources toward damage control. The problem is: they're about 6,000 miles off target with their efforts. Instead of focusing on protecting the millions of troops and civilians in Baghdad and other areas of Iraq against lEOs, they've chosen to defend themselves and their policies against verbal attacks and calls for resignation. As the scope of long-overdue oversight investigations expands, so too does our knowledge of the actions that the White House has taken, or has failed to take, these past seven years. Instead of provid­ing sufficient explanations or holding the appropriate people accountable for failures and missteps, however, this administration and its compatri­ots have chosen to stonewall, finally succumbing only to the almighty sub­poena. Even this, however, has proven at times to be a futile exer­cise in accountability. 
The amount of things that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales can recall could seemingly be counted on one hand. His testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee was an absolute joke, racking up over 70 answers of "I don't know" or "I don't recall" by the end, despite the appro­priate focus of the questions. His inability to recall crucial facts about his role in firing eight U.S. Attorneys was ludicrous and, as has been stat­ed by many pundits, either reflects his refusal to share facts or simply an inability and altogether lack of diligence in carrying out his duties. President Bush's response to Gonzales' absurd lack of integrity,

capability and testimony: "The attor­ney general gave a very candid assessment ... in a way that increased my confidence in his ability to do the job." 
So, just to be clear on this: Attorney General Gonzales took an entire month preparing for this testi­mony and, in effect, didn't testify to much else beyond his incompetence. As a result, President Bush has increased confidence in him. Got it? Moving on. 
Paul Wolfowitz, the former Deputy Secretary of Defense who was previ­ously best known for his hawkish consistency in calling for attacks on Iraq well before 9/11, was installed as President of the World Bank in January of 2005. However, Wolfowitz's romantic interest, Shaha Ali Riza, was already working for the World Bank, creating a conflict of interest for Wolfowitz. Taking a page from the book of cronyism as written by President Bush and Vice President Cheney, Wolfowitz decided that the appropriate action would be to facili­tate a transfer of Ms. Riza to the State Department where she would work under Elizabeth Cheney, daugh­ter of Dick Cheney. As a notable perk, Ms. Riza received an enormous pay raise, ultimately earning a salary higher than Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice. 
Like Gonzales, Wolfowitz has ignored resounding calls for his res­ignation, choosing instead to leave it up to the President or an official vote. It seems like these guys just don't know when they've lost. 
These two cases, however, are sim­ply symptomatic of the overt nepo­tism and sheer hubris of the Bush administration. In a villainous stroke, allegiances to the American people, the Constitution and fundamental notions of human rights and dignity have been replaced by allegiance to the President. The extensive politi­cization of law enforcement shown in the Federal Attorney firings, the dis­respect for transparency and accountability demonstrated by the "loss" of about five million e-mails between top government officials, and .the failure of the administration to take responsibility for their negli­gent actions, all point towards a bla­tant disregard for public service and ultimately a dismissal of the American constituency as being rele­vant to the country's direction. Time after time we are being sold this notion that we're not capable of determining what's best for our country, and that our sense of history is askew. President Bush has said time and time again that he only cares how he is judged by history, but fails to acknowledge that this Machiavellian take on leadership is definitively ignorant of the popula­tion that he was elected to serve. 
Accountability has gone missing along with Habeus Corpus and the Geneva Conventions these past sever­al years, but the newly-elected, Democratic-majority Congress is at long last trying to make it right. With 61 percent of Americans disapprov­ing of Bush's efforts in last week's CBS/New York Times poll, the people have indeed spoken. However, this administration has also spoken, stat­ing that they are not by the people, for the people and of the people. Instead, it is by their boss, for the history books, and of those who hap­pen to agree with Bush and Cheney.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Church condemns slavery 

In response to my column on the natural law and the Magisterium of the Church ("Natural law still applies," April 24), professor Christian Moevs claims that "until 1888" the popes were "condoning slavery" ("Natural law proves fallible," April25). Normally, a reader who com­ments on a column should have the last word. But the Moevs comment is inexcusably simplistic and mislead­ing. 
Slavery antedated the Church by centuries. The Latin "servitus" can mean either "slave" or "servant." It embraced servitude by "just title," as in punishment for crime or by voluntary contract, as well as the unjust servitude which we know as slavery. The 1866 Holy Office document to which Moevs apparently refers, rec­ognized that distinction -a point which Moevs fails to mention. In 1866, the Pope over the Holy Office was Pius IX who, in beatifYing Peter Claver in 1850 for his work among slaves, had called slavery "supreme wickedness." 
For further information I suggest Rev. Joel Panzer's book, The Popes and Slavery (Alba House, 1996). Panzer analyzes 12 explicit papal condemnations of slavery, dat­ing from the 1400s when the modern age of slavery arose. Prior to the Civil War, some American bishops taught that, although trading in slaves was immoral, owning slaves was not. Panzer demonstrates that this erroneous teaching contradicted the teaching of the popes. The fact that some bishops fail to do their duty should not surprise us today. 
The teaching authority of the Church, exercised by the Pope and the bishops in union with him, has been con­sistently right on slavery as it has been on contraception, homosexual activity, economic injustice and other issues that bother today's cafeteria Catholics.

Flogging Molly an Irish success at Legends 
It's likely that few events in the his­tory of Legends were as anticipated as Thursday's Flogging Molly concert. 
This was the event for which Legends set up an overflow tent on its patio, complete with projection TVs and sound equipment. This was the event that had people lin­ing up hours before­hand in the pouring rain to get a good spot inside. 
This was the event that delivered. 
Flogging Molly ­one of the world's premier Irish bands-gave a concert that lived up to the expectations, bringing down the packed house with its high-energy performance and intense music. 
The band may be labeled as punk rock, but it certainly doesn't act like it. Flogging Molly doesn't play so loud and fast that

ing stories about his youth in Ireland with jokes about having to drink his beer out of a plastic blue Legends cup. He has that distinctive voice of a great Irish storyteller and used it very well Thursday night. 
Regan is hands down one of the best fiddle players around -something you really notice a lot more in a live concert compared to Flogging Molly's COs. All the other instruments seemed to play off her tlddle for most of the show, and she even held her ground when she switched to the tin whistle. Regan wins the Most Valuable Performer award. 
There were quite a lot of diehard Flogging Molly fans at Legends, and the band didn't disappoint by playing most of its popular songs, including "Drunken Lullabies," "Hebels of the Sacred Heart" and "What's Left of the Flag." For the encore, the acoustic introduction to "Black Friday Hule" was the only thing that managed to calm the Legends crowd on the night 
-and that lasted for only 
a few minutes until the happen much more regularly. I think it's great that the tent was set up to accommodate the large crowd, and its too bad the band didn't want the back doors opened so those people could see inside. 


The club clearly wasn't expecting that such a large crowd would be excited, possibly drunk and hard to control (who knew?) and didn't have any barricades set up between the crowd and the band. Because of this, work lights were on for 20 minutes or so while barriers were put in place ­a nuisance, but a good move overall. In the end, the concert was handled very well, and I think Legends will learn from this next time. (Maybe we can fix that leaky roof too, perhaps?) 
There's no doubt that the concert was a great success. This was a great band for a small, intimate setting like Legends and it gave an unforgettable performance. Flogging Molly needs to be invited back, and it needs to be soon.

DVD REVIEW 
Hong Kong box set an 'Affair' to remember 
By RAMA GOTTUMUKKALA Senior SraffWrirer 
Improving upon a great film is a daunting task, and often a futile one. But Martin Scorsese proved capable of the challenge when he undertook a remake of "Infernal Affairs," the highly acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong crime thriller. 
Scorsese's masterful reinvention debuted under a different title -"The Departed" ­but it rippled through Hollywood as powerfully and as easily as its predecessor had through Asia. Terrifically entertaining, brilliantly acted and superbly photographed, "Infernal Affairs" started a chain of events that would leave a lasting impact halfWay across the world. It caught the eye of an appreciative Scorsese, whose remake garnered the legendary 64­year-old director his long overdue Oscar. 

More than any other, Scorsese's win is a tes­tament to the strength of the original material. Proving the cyclical nature of such success, the praise showered on "Departed" led to the release of the "Wernal Affairs" trilogy in a new three-disc box set from the Weinstein Company. 
While the first "Wernal Affairs" film was previously available, this release marks the first time that "Infernal Affairs II," a prequel, and "Infernal Affairs III" -a sequel that includes intervening flashbacks ala "The Godfather: Part II" -are available on DVD in America. Together, the three films weave a compelling and intricate tapestry of the Hong Kong underworld. 
Of the trio, "Infernal Affairs" is by far the best. It has become an instant classic on the strength of its concise storytelling and visual grandeur. The best scenes in the movie come in the briefest interactions between Tony Leung and Andy Lau, who play the charac­ters that inspired Leonardo DiCaprio's Billy Costigan and Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan, respectively. They spend much of the movie dodging one another, but the narrative builds to their climactic rooftop dust-up, a scene that pops with tension-filled verve thanks to Leung and Lau's engaging chemistry. Compounding this beautifully played scene is the rich cine­matography, which captures the great expanse of Hong Kong's skyline as the back­drop to this very private struggle. 
Two different endings were shot for "Wernal Affairs." Shot to appease Chinese officials concerned with the film's difficult con­tent, the second is much more upbeat and much less effective. Both are included on the DVD and allow for a good comparison.  
While "Infernal Affairs II" and "ill" struggle when compared to their elder sibling, both films are able-bodied examples of Hong Kong cinema's greatest strength: pure, frenzied energy. Like most sequels, money was a clear motivation for their making. As a result, both movies feel less organic. They are chained to habitual albeit impressive set pieces as opposed to subtle character development. Still, it's satisfYing to see Leung and Lau reprise their roles coolly and effortlessly in "Infernal Affairs ill." 


The recent DVD set features strong picture and audio quality that amplify the trilogy's impressive production values. Each of the three DVDs also houses bonus material unique to the individual fihns. They include trailers, featurettes on the making of each installment, deleted scenes and a subtitled commentary track for "Infernal Affairs II." 
Unfortunately, there are no commentaries fea­
turing Leung and Lau, but the special features 
that are included strengthen the overall pack­
age. 

Watching "Infernal Affairs" after "The 
Departed," it's easy to see what caught Scorsese's discerning eye and inspired his imagination. Spread across three movies, the intrigue of this story comes from observing two enthralling leads. These men sink so far into the quicksand of their concealed lives that they begin to question who they were and · what they've become. The dilemma sparks a 
fascinating drama.

"Kickin' It Old Skoal" is proof that some­times you just can't pick movies based on the reviews at rottentomatoes.com. Although the movie is currently enjoying a zero percent rating on the popular critical Web site, for fans of 1980s pop culture, it's an enjoyable trip down memory lane.

obligatory cameo by David Hasselhoff, who appears in a "Don't Hassle the Hoff'' T-shirt while deliv­ering the Trans Am from "Knight Rider." 
Kennedy is wide-eyed and sweet as Justin, but tends to overreach by portray­ing what appears to be a mentally dis­abled person, rather than a kid in an adult's body. He would have done far bet­ter studying Tom Hanks' performance in "Big" and trying to emulate the childlike persona that Hanks nailed. 
In her major acting debut, Menounos (formerly an "Entertainment Tonight" and "Channel 1" correspondent) is dreadful as the object of Justin's affections. She's pret­ty to look at, but has the emotional capa­bility of a Barbie doll and hits a wall whenever she has to sell a line of dia­logue. It's not all Menounos' fault, though -her character was written as a dim bulb, which becomes infuriating during the film. Her motivations are also com­pletely lacking, since it is never believable that a sweet girl like herself would be involved with the borderline-sociopathic Kip, who treats her and everyone else like dirt. 


Rosenbatnn (TV's "Smallville") plays the bad-guy boyfriend part with an exaggerat­ed lack of redeeming qualities and deliv­ers one of the better performances of the film. 
This is one of those movies that can only really be enjoyed with a great audience. If people aren't clapping or shouting inap­propriate comments at the screen, the movie loses the only value it has.

Jason Kidd added 17 points, 13 assists and eight rebounds for New Jersey, which can advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals with a vidory in Game 5 on Tuesday night. If the Haptors win that one, Game 6 would be baek in New Jersey on Friday. 
Toronto's first postseason since 2002 is shaping up as a 
short one. Teams taking 3-1 leads in series have won 158 and lost only eight. 

Andrea Bargnani scored 16 points for the Raptors, who led for all of 15 seconds in the two games at the Meadowlands. Toronto has lost eight straight road playoff games since beat­ing Philadelphia on May 6, 2001, in Game 1 of Eastern Conference semitinals. 
Kidd, who missed practice on the eve of Game 3 with a sore knee that Raptors coach Sam Mitchell doesn't seem to believe he had, sat the entire fourth quarter. That's probably all that prevented him from a second straight triple-double, leaving him with 10 in the postseason, tied with Larry Bird for second on the career list. 
The Nets punished the Haptors with their fast break in the first three games, outscor­ing them 49-25. New Jersey did its damage from the 3-point line Sunday, making a franchise playofl'-record 14.

Ben Gordon scored 24 points and Luol Deng had 22 to lead Chicago past Miami 92-79 Sunday in Game 4 to clinch the first-round Eastern Conference series. The Bulls advanced in the postseason for the first time since Jordan's last title in 1998. 
Chicago, which meets Detroit next, became the first team to oust a defending champion in the tirst round since Phoenix did it to San Antonio in 2000. 
"We felt confident coming into this series," Bulls guard Kirk Hinrich said. "We felt like we could win." 
With good reason. Including playoffs, Chicago was 7-1 against Miami this season, start­ing with a 108-66 win on open­ing night, spoiling the lleat's championship-ring celebration, and ending their season by allowing only two points in the tina! 5:27 of the clincher -clos­ing the game with a 14-2 run. 
The coach of that Suns team that beat San Antonio seven years ago? Scott Skiles, who coaches the Bulls now and who put together a plan that befud­dled Miami all series long. 
"It's an accomplishment," Skiles said. "We're in a funny position here. We want to enjoy it. It was great. We played well. We played hard all four games. We deserved to win -but we want to keep playing." 
Chicago became the 80th con­secutive NBA team to advance after taking a 3-0 lead in a series. Only three teams in major pro sports have overcome such a deficit, and the Heat won't be joining the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs, 1975 New York Islanders and 2004 Boston Red Sox in that exclusive dub.

Associated Press 
FOXBOROUGH, Mass. ­The Patriots' newest wide receiver hopes being with a winner will put the focus more on his catches than his controversies. 
"The Moss of old is back," he declared Sunday. 
Is that the Randy Moss who made the Pro Bowl in five of his first six seasons? Or is it the one who was fined $10,000 for pretend­ing to pull down his pants in front of a Green Bay crowd -among other transgressions? 
New England obtained Moss from the Oakland Raiders for a fourth-round draft choice Sunday, the second day of the NFL draft. The Raiders used that pick on Cincinnati cornerback John Bowie. 

The Patriots see signs that Moss will behave properly, a point of emphasis with team owner Robert Kraft since he bought the team before the 1994 season. 
Running back Corey Dillon was disgruntled while playing with a losing franchise in Cincinnati but was a good teammate after coach Bill Belichick and vice president for player personnel Scott Pioli trad­ed for him in 2004. Dillon wasn't re-signed after last season. 
"Bill and Scott have

TALLADEGA, Ala. -At the track. where Dale Earnhardt dominated, and on the day he would have turned 56, Jeff Gordon scored career victory No. 77. 
It was the fitting venue, the perfect day, for Gordon to move past Earnhardt on NASCAR's wins list. 
And, as expected, it was wildly unpopular. 
Fans littered the track with debris Sunday as Gordon crossed the finish line under caution at Talladega Superspeedway to move into sixth place on the win list. 
"I never caused a riot before for winning -well, maybe once or twice," Gordon laughed. 
It was the same reaction he received last week in Phoenix when he tied Earnhardt's mark and flew a No. 3 flag on his victory lap. That gesture didn't sit well with Earnhardt fans. 
shown that they can assemble players, espe­cially veteran players, who can acclimate to our cul­ture," club owner Robert Kraft told The Associated Press in a telephone inter­view. "If people don't adjust to our standards, they won't be here." 
Moss kept repeating how excited he was to join the 
' Patriots because of their chances of winning a fourth Super Bowl this decade. He even renegoti­ated downward a contract that would have paid him $9.25 million in 2007 and $11.25 million in 2008. "I've made a lot of money and I still have money in the bank. So by 
me coming to an organiza­tion such as the New England Patriots, why would money be a factor?" Moss said in a conference call. ''I'm still in awe that I'm a part of this organiza­tion." 
Belichick has built the Patriots as a team of play­ers who shun individual glory. Three-time Super Bowl winning quarterback Tom Brady makes sure to credit his teammates ­and spreads passes to many receivers. 
Is Moss OK with not being THE go-to guy? 
"Of course, I am," he said after a brief pause. "I've never been a selfish ballplayer." 

Athletics trade for outfield­
er Langerhans 
OAKLAND, Calif. -The Oakland Athletics got some relief for their injury-depleted outfield Sunday, acquiring Ryan Langerhans in a trade with the Atlanta Braves for a player to be named or cash. 
Langerhans will join the A's in Boston on Tuesday and is slated to start in center field for the opener of the two-game series with the Red Sox. 
"He plays all three outfield posi­tions, and given our situation with all the injuries, we need as many healthy bodies as we can get," A's general manager Billy Beane said. "He's a player we've liked in the past. He's off to a rough start in Atlanta and he became available to us." 
To make room on the roster for Langerhans, Oakland optioned Sunday's losing pitcher, Dallas Braden, to Triple-A Sacramento. 
Wheldon finally wins in 
Kansas City 
KANSAS CITY, Kan. -Dan Wheldon has seen too many close finishes at Kansas Speedway ­from just behind the winner. 
But for one of them, he might be a two-time defending IndyCar Series champion. 
Wheldon is no longer 0-for­Kansas, though. After finishing sec­ond in 2005 and 2006, both times by less than a second, he made Sunday's race a rare yawner. 
Wheldon was 10 seconds ahead of Dario Franchitti late in the Kansas Lottery Indy 300 and won under caution when Scott Sharp crashed with two laps to go. 
"It was a very different race for Kansas," Wheldon said. "Kansas is normally a producer of close finish­es. I have to say I much prefer the much wider margins than the shortest, because I lost the short­est."

Cardinals pitcher Hancock killed in morning car crash 
Associated Press 

CHICAGO -The St. Louis Cardinals are mourning a team­mate for the second time in five years, and it isn't any easier this time. 
Josh Hancock, a relief pitcher who helped the team win the World Series last season, died early Sunday when his sport utility vehicle slammed into the back of a tow truck, bringing back painful memories of Darryl Kile's death in June 2002. 
"There's a big hole that's going to be there," St. Louis manager Tony La Russa said. "This is brutal to go through." 
The Cardinals postponed their home game Sunday night against the Chicago Cubs. La Hussa informed Hancock's fami­ly of the accident. 
"What words can you give somebody in a situation like this?" Cubs manager Lou Piniella said. 
Police said the 29-year-old Hancoek was alone in his 2007 Ford Explorer when the SUV struck the rear of a flatbed tow truck at 12:35 a.m. The tow truck was in the left lane with its lights flashing while assisting another car that had crashed, Police Chief Joe Mokwa said. 
Hancock died upon impact, Mokwa said. The driver of the tow truck, whose name was not released by police, was in the truck at the time of the crash but was not injured. Mokwa said the truck driver saw Hancock's SUV swerve just before it hit the tow truck. 
Mokwa said it appeared Hancock was driving at or just above the speed limit, and there were no alcohol containers in his vehicle. 
"We may never know what occurred," Mokwa said. "It appears that he just merely did­n't see the tow truek." 
The medical examiner's oflice said an autopsy had been seheduled. Serviees were planned for Thursday in Tup~1lo, Miss., where Hancock's family lives. Hancock was single. 
"All of baseball today mourns the tragic and untimely death of St. Louis pitcher Josh Ilancoek," baseball commissioner Bud Selig said. "He was a fine young pitcher who played an impor­tant role on last year's World Series championship team." 
The Cardinals will wear patches with Hancock's No. 32 on their sleeves for the rest of the season. The team also planned a memorial for the bullpen, which already features a tribute to Kile. 
A Cardinals-Cubs game also was postponed five years ago after Kile was found dead in his hotel room in Chicago. The 33­year-old pitcher died of a coro­nary artery blockage. 
General manager Walt Jocketty said the Cardinals, who are off Thursday, plan to char­ter a plane to Hancock's funer­al. The team begins a three­game series in Milwaukee on Monday and returns to St. Louis on Friday. 
"Obviously, this is very diffi­cult for all of us, especially those of us who were here five years ago when we lost Darryl Kile," said Jocketty, his eyes red. "There's no way we could have played tonight's game." 
La Russa met with players shortly before a news confer­ence Sunday afternoon to pro­vide details of the accident and share memories. Late in the afternoon, two Cardinals jogged together in the outfield in a nearly empty Busch Stadium. 
"This has obviously been a very difficult time," St. Louis pitcher Braden Looper said. "Josh was a great teammate and a great friend to everybody, and he was a key part of our success." 
News of Hancock's death began to circulate around the majors on Sunday morning. Seattle Mariners pitcher 'Jeff Weaver, who won the World Series clincher for St. Louis in October, got a call from Cardinals reliever Randy Flores. 
"I never really had a phone call like that before. It's kind of mind-boggling."

Kurczak led the Belles' attempted comeback with an unearned run but could not score again in the sixth or sev­enth, and the game ended a 6­5 loss for Saint Mary's. 
The Belles turned their luck around and handed Hope a 7-6 defeat in the second game. "We knew we should have won the first game," Sullivan said. "We kind of lost it ourselves. We knew if we made changes in the second game, we were going to win."

off." 
In game one, the Belles managed 10 hits off Hope, but the Dutch responded with 10 hits off sophomore pitcher Calli Davison. 
Hope started off the first inning by plating a run, but Saint Mary's quickly knocked in a run of its own in the first, scored by Davison off freshman outfielder Ashley Peterson's double. 
The Belles kept the playing field even after Hope scored another two runs in the second inning. Freshman second base­man Maureen Healy hit sopho­more first baseman Katie Rashid in while sophomore outfielder Cathy Kurczak scored on Peterson's sacrifice fly. 
With the score 3-3 in the third, Rashid hit one out of the ballpark for her fourth home run of the season. The Dutch had two more runs in the 
pitching staff. 

Hope started off the game well, scoring twice in the first, but the Belles swung their way back with four runs in the second from Rashid, Kurczak, Healy, as well as a homer from senior third base­man Laura Heline. In a game marked by multiple long balls, Miesle banged a homer in the fifth and Davison homered in the sixth, knocking in Healy. 
With the score at 7-3, the Dutch made a run back, scor­ing three times in the seventh. It wasn't enough to tie the game, however, and the Belles walked away with the 7-6 win. 
On Saturday, the Belles secured the No. 4 spot in the MIAA standings by sweeping the Kalamazoo Hornets. Davison gave up just two runs and eight hits while the Belles hit 12 off Kalamazoo's pitch­ing. 
The Belles squashed the 
Hornets with their strong offense as Healy, Davison, Reline, sophomore catcher Ashley Fusaro and Miesle scored five runs in the first. Junior designated hitter McKenna Corrigan, Miesle and Fusaro pounded out three more runs in the third to make the score 8-1. Peterson's run in the fourth and Kurczak's single to hit in Reline in the fifth ended the game at 10-2 because of the slaughter rule. 
In their second win over Kalamazoo, the Belles had more trouble driving in runs, but still managed to pull off a 2-0 victory -thanks for a no­hitter from Amram. 
It is the third time in Amram's career that she has thrown a no-no and the first no-hitter in the MIAA since Saint Mary's alum Bridget Grall threw one April 1, 2006, in a 5-0 win over Adrian. In Amram's perfect game she struck out nine, bringing her season total to 147 strikeouts. 
That pitching performance was key, Sullivan said, because the Belles' hitting wasn't com­ing through. 
"The first game we hit really well," Sullivan said. "The sec­ond game, we had good hits but we couldn't string them together. But our pitching and our defense was amazing." 
1-Ieline scored in the second and Miesle tripled to hit Healy in during the fifth inning. 
The Belles (23-7, 8-6 MIAA) will face Adrian College (15­11, 4-8 MIAA) today in their last conference game of the season in Adrian, Mich. at 3:30 p.m. 
"They've got a tough team," Sullivan said of seventh­ranked Adrian. "They hit well and they've got a couple of good pitchers. We're definitely not taking them lightly. We're going to come out strong."

Irish capture fourth consecutive Big East title in Massachusetts 
By DANIELL£ KELLER Sports Writer 

Notre Dame captured its fourth consecutive Big East championship Sunday in Worcester, Mass., after it raced for its second straight day after taking down two ranked teams Saturday. 
"It wasn't the easiest thing to do; it was pretty difficult. We raced some great teams and then rode five hours on a bus and had to per­form against some top-level com­petition." head coach Martin Stone said. 
Notre Dame was able to cope with the back-to-hack races, win­ning the varsity eight, varsity four, and novice four races, garnering enough points to claim the Big East title. 
"It was a risk we took, racing back-to-hack. But we were able to get it done," Stone said.

SCHRAGE CELEBRATES 

By FRAN TOLAN Sports Writer 

Notre Dame won its third straight Big East series this weekend, taking two of three from host Rutgers in Piscataway, N.J. -and Irish coach Dave Schrage earned his SOOth career collegiate win on his birth­day. 
Schrage, the first-year Irish coach who turned 46 Sunday, said he will never forget the milestone triumph. 
"It's special to [win your SOOth game] on your birthday, for Notre Dame, in the fashion we did today," Schrage said. "It's something I'll remember forever. It was just a great win." 
The teams traded blowouts in their doubleheader Saturday before the Irish took the rubber game in a thriller Sunday. 
The Irish improved to 24-19 over­all and 8-9 in conference play, mov­ing them into a sixth-place tie with Cincinnati in the Big East standings with just three series to play before the conference tournament. 
"This is what we needed to do," Schrage said. "You want to be play­ing your best baseball when it comes close to tournament time." 
Rutgers, meanwhile, fell to 25-16 overall and 13-5 against Big East foes, dropping out of first place in the league standings for the first time in nearly a month. The Scarlet Knights exited the weekend tied for second in the conference with Louisville, a game behind league­leader St. John's. 
Notre Dame 15, Rutgers 3 
Irish sophomore David Phelps ran his record to 7-3 while he gave up three runs in seven innings and the productive Irish offense plated 15 runs on 13 hits. 
Phelps' earned-run average 

(1.64) rose slightly during the con­test, but it remains among the low­est in the Big East. The right-han­der scattered seven hits and struck out seven without walking a batter. 
"[Phelps has] been just outstand­ing for us," Schrage said. "He's really taken hold of that 
number-one spot [in the rotation] and pitched like you're supposed to." 
Irish shortstop Brett Iilley and sophomore rightfielder Ryan Connolly each reached base five times, while fifth-year catcher Matt Weglarz provided pop from the cleanup spot, hitting his third home run and racking up five RBis. 
The Irish plated one run in the first inning and two more in the second, before blowing the game open in the fourth. Senior center­fielder Danny Dressman led off the fourth with a single that rebounded off the glove of Rutgers third base­man Tim Querns, sparking a Notre Dame rally in which six runs were scored before the side was retired. 
The Irish took advantage of five more hits, a walk and an error by Scarlet Knights shortstop Todd Frazier to build a 9-0 lead for Phelps. 
Phelps surrendered two home runs but little else to the Rutgers ofl'ense that boasted five starters who came into the contest with bat­ting averages over .300. 
Scarlet Knights catcher Frank Meade hit a solo home run in the fifth and Frazier hammered a two­run blast in the seventh. 
But the Irish pushed across three runs in each ofthe final two innings to put the game even further out of reach. 
Rutgers 7, Notre Dame 0 
In the second half of Saturday's doubleheader, Rutgers senior Steve Healing worked the complete game, scattering seven hits and striking out two Irish batters. The right-hander did not surrender a walk. 
"Our offense was great in game one, but they really shut us down in game two," Schrage said. 
Sophomore second baseman Jeremy Barnes was the only Irish player with multiple hits in the game. 
Irish sophomore right-hander Kyle Weiland suffered hL<> first loss of the season as he surrendered four runs on five hits and three walks over 4.2 innings. 
Hutgers jumped on Weiland early, scoring a run on Meade's double in the second inning. In the fifth. the Scarlet Knights plated three more on three hits, including a two-out RBI double by catcher Jon f..ossard. 
The lead was more than enough for Healing, who improved his record to 6-3 on the season. 
Notre Dame 6, Rutgers 4 
The Irish gave Schrage his SOOth victory of his NCAA career when they came back from a 3-2 eighth­inning deficit to win in front of a record crowd of 1,024 at Bainton Field Sunday afternoon. 
Leftfielder Ross Brezovsky gave Notre Dame the lead when he dou­bled home Connolly and third baseman A.J. Pollock with two outs in the eighth. But Gossard continued his big weekend for Rutgers by hitting a solo home run off junior Joey Williamson to tie the score. 
Despite giving up the homer to Gossard, Willamson picked up the win after Notre Dame pushed across two more runs in the ninth. 
Dressman led off the frame with an infield single then scored when Barnes tripled to centerfield. 
"Barnesy hitting that triple gave us a huge lift," Schrage said. 
Barnes scored an insurance run for the Irish on senior first base­man Mike Dury's sacrifice fly. 
But the two-run cushion proved unnecessary as freshman Eric Maust and sophomore Sam Elam combined to strike out the side in a scoreless ninth. 
After Maust surrendered a walk and a single, Elam relieved him with two outs and struck out Hutgers first baseman Tom Edwards to end the game. It was Elam's first save of the season. 
Notre Dame took the early lead, scoring a run in each of the first two innings. 
In the second, Irish freshman designated hitter Hyan Miller hit a solo home run, his second round­tripper ofthe season.

Notre Dame would not go quietly though, as McKinney and Byers scored consecutive goals to cut the lead to 11-7. Stanwick's sixth goal of the game for the Hoyas looked to put the game out of reach for the Irish with just over five minutes left, but Notre Dame continued to play aggressively.

Irish lose seventh straight 
Notre Dame drops two games to No. 11 DePaul in the Windy City 
By LORENZO REYES 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame fell twice at the hands of Big East rival No. 11115 DePaul in a double­header Sunday in Chicago. 
The Blue Demons remained undefeated in Big East play and improved to 35-7 overall, while the Irish dropped to 24­21 and 9-7 in conference play at fourth place. 
In the first half of the dou­bleheader, sophomore Brittney Bargar started for the Irish and faced some resistance early in the first inning. After two walks, Notre Dame senior catcher Gessica Hufnagle gunned down a runner attempting to steal, and Bargar was able to pitch her way out of trouble. 
Hufnagle also threw out another runner attempting to steal in the third inning after a DePaul single. 
In the fourth inning, senior Stephanie Brown reached base on a single and advanced to second on a sac­rifice bunt. Two subsequent outs, however, ended the Irish rally. 
The Blue Demons claimed 

the first two runs of the game in the bottom of the fourth when sophomore third base­man Amber Patton and junior Sandy Vojik led off the frame with singles. A sacrifice advanced the runners into scoring position until sopho­more catcher Jackie Tarulli brought them in with a sin­gle. 
The Irish got on the board in the next inning when freshman Christine Lux hit her second home run of the season, cutting the deficit in half. 
DePaul added an insurance run -the last of the game ­in the fifth after a bunt sin­gle, a stolen base and an RBI single from senior Kate Sheaks. 
Bargar received her 11th loss of the season in the first contest of the doubleheader. 
The second game started with the Irish loading the bases, and then leaving them full. Brown and Hufnagle both singled to reach base. And after junior Katie Laing's sacrifice bunt advanced the runners, Lux drew a walk to load them up. A strike out and a ground out later, the Blue Demons were able to 
breathe easier in the score­less game. 
After a dropped fly ball in the bottom of the second, and two singles later on in the frame, DePaul broke through with their first run of the game. 
In the fourth, the Blue Demons added to their lead when junior Marcy Wilus drove in Katie Hanson with a single. On an attempted tag­up at home, a DePaul runner was gunned down with a good relay throw from the outfield. 
Two more insurance runs were added in the sixth with Vojik's RBI fielder's choice and Wilus' second RBI of the game on a double. 
That was all the offense on the day, as Bargar fell to 16­12 on the season. The pitch­ing staff hasn't received much support during Notre Dame's seven-game losing streak -the offense has pro­duced only five runs during the drought. 
Notre Dame will travel to Chicago again Tuesday for its game against Loyola Chicago.

starting the season 3-3, the Irish won seven consecutive games, improving their overall record to 10-3 to go along with a perfect 4-0 mark in confer­ence play. During its winning streak, Notre Dame has outscored its opponents by an astounding 93-29 margin. 
"Starting 3-3, we knew at that point that we would have to win out to have any kind of impact on the season," Polk said. "The fact that we came together as a team to grind out seven going on eight victories is a big statement to who we are as a team and a unit." 
Perhaps none of Notre Dame's seven consecutive victo­ries has been as impressive as Saturday's win over Ohio State. Coming into the game, the Buckeyes had won four consec­utive contests and sat a half­game ahead of the Irish in the GWLL standings. 
Strong defense and timely offense ultimately helped turn what had been a close game into a comfortable victory for Notre Dame. 
consecutive goals to end the game. 
Polk started the run by tally­ing his fourth and final goal of the day off a pass from fresh­man attack Will Yeatman. Sophomore attack Duncan Swezey added his second goal of the day to push the Irish lead to four with only 4:35 remain­ing. Yeatman then notched his second goal of the day off a pass from junior midfielder Michael Podgajny, who finished the run with a goal of his own. 
On the other end of the field, Notre Dame's defense tightened up, allowing only four shots on goal -all of which were stopped by junior keeper Joey Kemp who had 13 total saves on the day. 
"We came around in the sec­ond half," Irish coach Kevin Corrigan said. "We finished the opportunities we had, and we didn't give them many opportu­nities. When they did get opportunities, Joey [Kemp] was all over the ball. He wasn't let­ting anything get by."

Team Castle Point took over slip away from them but said 5-1, Notre Dame made some mistakes that let Ohio State cut the lead to 7-5 by halftime. During the stretch, the Irish missed three one-on-one opportunities at the Buckeye end of the field and allowed Ohio State to recover and score on a play where the Notre Dame defense forced a ground ball. 
In the third quarter, Ohio State's Joel Dalgarno cut the Irish lead to one with 11:46 remaining in the third quarter, but Notre Dame's Ryan Cunn pushed the Irish lead back to two with 1:52 left in the period, and that would be as close as the Buckeyes would get. 
"We played well throughout, but we didn't finish everything well," Corrigan said. "We had some defensive plays that cost us some goals. We missed three one-on-one's at the offensive end. All of a sudden, it's 7-5 at halftime. In the second half, we dido 't make those mistakes." 
Notre Dame will finish its regular season next Saturday when it travels to Quinnipiac to try to clinch a perfect confer­ence record.

the loss was bitter sweet since they had made it so far in the tournament. They made it to the championship by defeating the No. 1-seeded Kramer Properties 22-20 in a thrilling semifinal game Saturday. 
"I think we delivered a good game, there were a lot of fans there, and they seemed happy," Ortiz said about the loss. 
He is the only senior on the team and expects teammates Nick Possley, Rob Seery, Garret Flynn and Reuland to avenge their loss in next year's tournament. In order to do so, they will have to get through the Castle Point squad once again, who will return all five players next spring. 
The champs are sure to be a favorite on their quest to become the second straight back-to-hack champs, but Pogge wasn't willing to make any predictions yet. 
"It's hard to tell, the tourney is so hard to win, and it takes so long. It really just comes down to who hits the big shots when they need them."

Draft

pick in a trade with the Dallas Cowboys. 
"Once I heard about the trade, I knew it was about me because of the rumors and the fact that the Browns called me," Quinn said. "They said that they were trading up for me and that was a pretty good indication. I couldn't have anticipated things working out the way they did." 
Quinn was the first of seven former Irish players selected during the two-day draft. 
On Saturday, defensive end Victor Abiamiri was chosen by the Philadelphia Eagles in the second round, and offensive tackle Ryan Harris was taken in the third round by the Denver Broncos. 
On Sunday, defensive tackle Derek Landri was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the fifth round, cornerback Mike Richardson was taken by the New England Patriots in the sixth, and both guard Dan Santucci and safety Chinedum Ndukwe were drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the seventh round. 
Four other Notre Dame players -Darius Walker, Chris Frome, Rhema McKnight, and Marcus Freeman -signed free agent deals after going undrafted. 
With the No. 3 pick, the Browns took offensive tackle Joe Thomas out of Wisconsin. Miami picked Ohio State wide receiver Ted Ginn Jr. instead of Quinn at No. 9 -a decision that, accord­ing to published reports, caused boos to rain down at the Dolphins' draft-day pep rally. 
Quinn said the Browns warned him ahead of time they had decided on Thomas, but that he was surprised when Miami passed on him. 
"I was more shocked about the ninth pick. At the same time, you can't believe what everyone says to you because there are smoke screens that are put up," he said. "I knew about the Cleveland situ­ation going into it and I told everyone not to get their hopes up. I guess you really never know until it happens." 
After the Dolphins' selection, a series of teams with established quarterbacks picked in a row, meaning Quinn knew he had a long wait. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell allowed the quar­terback to wait in a private room, rather than in. the main auditori­um, to avoid ESPN cameras. 
"I sat in Mr. Goodell's green room for a little bit and thought about possibilities," Quinn said. "It wasn't as much agonizing for me as it was on my family. They want the best for me and they always felt I would be drafted higher. Everything worked out in the end."

D-Day 
Quinn and six other Irish players selected in the 2007 NFL Draft 
By CHRIS KHOREY 
Sports Editor 
Brady Quinn waited a little longer than he expected to, before he heard his name called in Saturday's National Football League Draft. 
The former Notre Dame quar­terback was unexpectedly passed over by both the Cleveland Browns at pick No. 3 and the Miami Dolphins at pick No. 9. Both teams had expressed interest in making him a top-1 0 first-round selection, but instead, Quinn fell to No. 22, where the Browns finally ended his nearly three-hour wait. 

 
''I'm so excited to be in Cleveland and this is a dream come true for me," Quinn, an Ohio native, said in a teleconfer­ence Saturday. "Things were tough the way they started out, but I think it worked out the best way it could have." 
Cleveland received the 22nd

By MICHAEL BRYAN 
Sports Writer 
The first-ever Big East championship was one No. 12 Notre Dame would rather for­get. The fourth-seeded Irish dropped their third-straight match Friday, a furious come­back ending just short in a 12­10 loss to No. 1 seed Georgetown in the semifinals. 
The Irish, who had defeated the Hoyas at home during the regular season 13-8, fell behind early in the first half when Georgetown scored the first four goals. The Irish gained some ground midway through the first half with goals by junior Caitlin McKinney and sophomore Jane Stoeckert, 
The lloyas countered quickly however, when senior captain Coco Stanwick scored two goals for a 6-2 lead. Sophomore Mary Carpenter and McKinney responded with

Big crowd watches as No.3 seed

By DAN MURPHY Associate Sports Editor 
Team Castle Point was crowned kings of the Bookstore court Sunday afternoon with a 21-18 victory over Mean Girls. 
Sophomore Pat Kuntz banked in the final hoop of the tournament after being fouled down low by one of the Mean Girls. Fouls proved to be the difference maker in Castle Point's win as they hit three huge baskets from the charity stripe to close out the game. 
"We didn't get all the calls we were looking for, but thankfully we got enough to help us out at the end," Castle Point captain Paul Pogge said. 
Rebounds and physical play gave Castle Point
