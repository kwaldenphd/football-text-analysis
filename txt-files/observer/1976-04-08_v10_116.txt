In Pennsylvania primary 






Candidates preparing for possible showdown 
Jimmy Carter, Henry M. Jack­son and Morris K. Udall--the candidate who woke up a loser-­plunged without pause yesterday into the campaign for Pennsylvan­ia's presidnetial primary, a contest that could be their Democratic showdown 
There are other candidates wait­ing to test them later, and there is Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, biding his time and looking for running room after the primary season is over. 
But it is evident now that the Pennsylvania balloting on April 27 will sort things out among the current crop of primary contenders. 
Carter won Tuesday's Wisconsin presidential primary with 37 per­cent of the vute, edging Udall. who held a premature victory celebra­tion election night. Early yester­day!, late-counted ballots turned things around. 
Carter had gone to bed in 
Milwaukee talking as though he 
had been defeated, although he 
never conceded. He got up to tell 
his supporters: "We're No. 1" and 
to wave a newspaper with a banner 
headline saying he had been .~pset. 
··And we won anyhow. the 
former Georgia governor said.

disappointment. "Oh. how sweet

taining the ''journal of the past year's events" format that has been characterized by the last two yearbooks. 
Next year's book will be organ­ized by sections, unlike the last two editions which were in chronologi­cal order. "The chronological order has not worked. so we're going back to sections such as seniors. sports and student life," Moore said. 
She also stated that the student life area would be broken up into more areas. One reason for this break-up is to increase the number of people working on the book. "Right now, we only have four or five section leaders. With more sections, we can get more people involved in the book," she com­mented. 
Moore plans to work in conjunc­

Nonetheless, Udall said that he had stopped the Carter bandwagon with his 35 percent of the vote, just behind Carter. 
"It was practically a dead heat in Wisconsin," he told United Auto Workers Union officials in Detroit. 'lf Carter had his way, his people

This election is going to be won or lost in the big industrial states, and Carter's record is not great in them," he said. "The Carter landslide has been stopped.'' 
Jackson won a commanding, 104-vote share of the Democratic delegates awarded in Tuesday's New York primary, and he said he would have more votes from nom­inally uncommitted delegates. Udall supporters captured 70 nat­ional convention seats, uncommit­ted entries won 65 and Carter had 35.

Aside from these offices, two new positions were created. Mary Charchut was appoimed as Admin­istrative Coordinat,,,. and Charlie Moran as Adminstartive Assistant. 
The Administrative Coordina­tor's office, which was dropped two 
years  ago, will  be  resumed  this  
year.  The  coordin ator  has  four

The second role is to coordinate the activities of organizations such as the Student Life Council, the Hall Presidents' Council and the Student Union. 
A third role is to acquaint the Notre dame student body with the activities of the Student Union. As a final role, the coordinator must maintain a calender for planned activities which will list 
tl1ctmg dates for d1fterent events. 
The role of Administrative Assis­tant will be to take charge of all special projects concerning the Student Union.

Li!w School receives gift 
A half-million dollar matching gift to the University of Notre Dame Law School by Chicago attorney Kenneth F. Montgomery was announced April 1 at a dinner of Notre Dame law alumni at the Chicago Bar Association. 
Notre Dame's Law Dean David 
T. Link said the gift, to be matched dollar-for-dollar by other contribu­tions, would permanently endow the Kiley Fellowship Fund begun in 1968 by Montgomery. 
The Kiley Fund, which offers tuition support and stipends to outstanding law students at Notre Dame, was named after Judge Roger J. Kiley, a 1923 Notre Dame law alumnus who became a mem­ber of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, where he served until his death in 1974. A close friend of Montgom­ery's, Kiley was active on Chicago Bar Association committees and in civic groups such as the National Conference of Chri~ti<>n~ <>ntl lPws and the Catholic Interracial Council There are now seven Kiley Fellows in the Notre Dame Law School, the oldest legal education facility under Catholic auspices in the nation. 
University President Rev. Theo­dore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., stated that "the Montgomery gift repre­sents an important contribution to a new era for the Law School. Notre Dame's Law School has traditional­ly offered a strong academic pro­gram and has concentrated on training competent and compas­sionate attorneys. The success of this program is evidenced by the Senior Fellow was not accessible to the students. We want him to be able to meet the people who elected him.'' This was a reason for the innovation of the dinner. 
Bleier was a 1968 graduate in business administration and lived in Dillon. He played halfback and was a football team captain at Notre Dame. 
While at Notre Dame, Bleier was a leader in the program to supply volunteers for the Northern Indiana Children's Hospital near the cam­pus. Reid said, "Bleier helped initiate the Logan Center program volunteer their time as tutors, swimming instructors and coun­sellors for the retarded children." 

Bleier entered professional foot­ball and was the only National Football League player to serve in Vietnam. He was wounded in action but overcame the crippling leg injury to win a starting assign­ment with the world championship Pittsburgh Steelers. 
Reid is glad Bleier was chosen for being more than just a football player. "He lived around the corner from me in Dillon and I

from the first day we met. I didn't find out he played football ·until later in the year," said Reid. 
By choosing Bleier , Reid be­lieves the students showed the same ideals put forth by the committee. They felt the esteem of the award had gone down in recent years. he explained. Lead by Bill Macauley. the committee's first action was to set guidelines for the award. 
Ferry said they wanted a man or woman whose influence extended outside his field. Bleier won because he war more than a football player. It made him a more attractive candidate," Ferry claim­ed. 

Reid cited increased student interest as proof of the award's growing esteem through the efforts of the committee. Sixty percent of the senior class voted in this election whereas only twelve per­cent voted last year. 
In order to further the tradition of the award, Reid said a plaque, with the former Senior Fellow listed , will be placed in the Senior Bar. As future fellows are elected their names will be added. Bleier will also receive a plaque. 
Bleier won in a landslide over the other candidates: John McKay, former Southern Cal football coach, Hunter Thompson. New Jorkjourn­alist and Geraldo Rivera, investiga­tive reporter.

Food Day 1976: Purposes and Goals at Notre Daine 
by Barb Robinson 

On Thursday, April 8, the Notre Dame World Hunger Coalition will be joining the efforts of numerous groups across the country to com­memorate Food Day 1976. Begun last year primarily by individuals interested in nutrition, the event became a catalyst in the formation of a number of organizations concerned about this issue and hunger on a global scale. A Food Day office has been established in Washington, D.C. to support these efforts nationwide. 
The purpose of these activities is two-fold. American patterns of consumption have.. become domin­ated by the interests of large corportions, namely agribusineses, within our country. If this is to change at all, Americans must first become cognizant of the value of nutritional education and secondly, seek a national policy to regulate these developments in the future. 
Initially an agricultural nation in which individuals were nearly self­sufficient for their foodstuffs, our country has drastically changed its living patterns. Most Americans have exchanged rural living for an urban setting. Consequently, food production has become a massive industry, not unlike other profit­making entities. A mere fifty food­producing manufacturers control this market. Like their counter­
parts. th~y also seck to influence govcJnment officials and consum­ers through political lobbying and advertising techniques. It is the individual who suffers, paying higher prices and losing control to a powerful conglomerate having little or no concern for health matters. Within a global context, the dom­ination of American power on trade regulations, foreign assistance, and world-wide patterns of con­sumption is a fact which many governmental officials realize, but 
which  must  be  discerned  by  
citizens  themselves  if  such  an  
imbalance can ever be altered.  

Those of us promoting Food Day arc attmepting to bring to public attention the need for a national policy on hunger and justice­related issues. We have such policies (or ar least strong urgings by public officials) for other issues considered crucial to our nation's welfare. With the growth of corporate interests and lobbying efforts in Congress, our country needs a ~regulated food industry to insure the best interests of those being served. 
The U.S. government can, and should, be persuaded to regulate the corporate impact on food processing, and seek other controls over agribusinesses that will pro­mote our nation's health, not the profit-making ventures of a min­ority. It can also directly affect the hungry. both here and abroad, by 
changing eligibility requirements for food stamp recipients. and 

Food Day Schedule 
providing at least 1 per cent of our GNP for developmental assistance abroad. 
Clearly, Congress and Executive Branch must be pursuaded to confront this challenge. If change is to occur. it must be initiated by caring citizens, and brought to the attention of leaders who can in­fluence policies. 
Educating ourselves to the guidelines of nutrition and the need for a national policy is a prelimi.­inary step, however. The Notre Dame World Hunger Coalition will be sponsoring activities for Food Day on April 8, in conjunction with INPIRG. We have chosen to look at these issues within the global context of inequality. It is fruitless to seperate the existence of hunger from the presence of related con­ditons, i.e. inadequate medica~ services. Similarly, we cannot view our own existence without realizing that there are many affected by our actions, many who will suffer tremendously if we choose to ignore the lifewithin them..

Food Day '76 
f_ Today is Food Day! Because of famine, the ensuing world food msis and the inception of a group called the Notre Dame World Hunger Coalition (and perhaps even the beautiful spring day), last year's Food Day was very meaningful and relevant for many of us here in this community at Notre Dame. Perhaps Food Day '76 doesn't seem as irrp>rtant. But yet there is still the injustice, the inequality and, yes, there is even stll a lot of hunger in our world. And we must emphasize that it is our world, with all its joys and sorrows and, indeed, with its responsibilities. In our Bicentennial year, we the people of the United States and, more specifically, we the people of the Notre Dame community, face a crucial challenge requiring critical decisions. For, you see, a world is only as well off as its inhabitants are and, unfortunately, the majority of our brothers and sisters around the globe are not very well off at all. The question then becomes: How much longer can this world of ours exist if all this inequality, suffering and death is to continue? We all know how easy it is to forget about the larger community to which we belong which is called humanity. Some­times the tempation of withdrawing from this global community into a world of our own "with all the comforts of home" is very great. But yet, many have told us that it is a cold, cruel world out there. We all think with much anxiety about going out into the "real" world after we must leave Notre Dame. H only there were some way in which we could make that larger world like that world of our own. H only we could be confident in entering into a world that was less cruel than today' s world. There is a way. In order to respond to the needs of human beings suffering from injustice and inequaltiy throughout the world, we must first learn to see them for what they are: our brothers and sisters. They are not just figures in a picture in a newspaper a magazine or on a telveision screen. They are people, like, us, who have many of the 
same thoughts, desires ano emotions as we do. More than a few of us have had the Qpportunity and good fortune to come to know some of these people as our friends. Except for some remarkable and perhaps even miraculous circumstances, these friends could have easily died in vain unbeknownst to us. The thought of this happening to the ones we now love as if they were members of our own family makes us shudder and vow that we will do all we can to stop any needless suffering throughout the world. Yet, our brothers and sisters, people like us, are dying of starvation and are suffering from gross injustices and inequalities! 
But this is not a fanatical appeal. Once we can really feel for these people, once we can concretize the situation in our minds, then we must sit down and decide what we can do. Thus, our intellect as well as our emotions must play a part in our response. 
It is our hope that people at Notre Dame and throughout our country can make global injustice and inequality a key issue in this Presidential election year. And it is also our hope that people here at Notre Dame, motivated by their own concerns, can go along way in providing dedication and concrete solutions to this challenge. And already it is happening. Many members of the student body, the faculty and the administration as well as others who are associated with our community are deeply involved. And the ranks continue to grow as more continue to respond wholehe-artedly as a result of events and experiences such as the Wednesday fasts and, hopefully, today, Food Day '76. 
As we close on this note of hope, the editors and st 'if would like to make it known that this ublication is dedicated to AI Sondej who, while with us at Notre Dame, has provided tremendous inspira­tion and dedication for which we and, most importantly, our brothers and sisters throughout the world are eternally grate­ful. Thank you All 
the editors 

A Hungry Atnerica 
============================Jlmcoyne
In the United States itself, there and then proposes, in his 1976 
are almost 40 million people in 
need of and eligible for food 
stamps. Less than half are 
receiving them. 
Not a single other wealthy, 
industrialized nation, east or west, 
tolerates the kind of slums, the 
persistent unemployment, the lack 
of medical coverage, or the hunger 
that still characterize the United 
States. 
Every year, United States citi­
zens use 3 million tons of fertilizer 
for non-food purposes--lawns, golf 

courses, and cemeteries. 
These facts, from a recent Bread for the World fact sheet, help exemplify one of our country's most ignored problems--hunger. When most of us think of hunger our minds are immediately foe­ussed on India, or Africa, or some other foreign country. People are 1'lrgely ignorant of the fact that 
lUnger exists in the land of the free. It seems that those who are not afflicted by this stifling malady just do not care. I say this when the radio announcer tells me that 95 million tons of food are wasted annually in Tusconl, Arizona, and that the United States schools 
throw out 2.5 million cartoons of milk per day. I say this when the president of our country has to be pressUred ~-allowing .1 of 1 o/o of our nation's money to be shipped overseas to feed starving people; budget outline, to cut back welfare programs, medicaid, medicare, and social security, in major pro­portions, crippling worse those already afflicted. 
It ~eems that a nation celebrating its 200th birthday would be concerned about those at the party, and make sure they all had enough to eat, just like any gracious host. But not America. We spend millions of dollars installing colon­ial cobblestones on modern streets while small children with wasted bodies and empty bodies and empty bellies are dying from 
1 
hunger in Arizona, in South Caro­lina and in the slums of New York City. Lavish new hotels and apartments buildings are erected, and present ones renovated, while in a small town ·in Mississippi, a starving family struggles for exis­tance in a dark, windowless shack. There is a colossal celebration with hundreds of onlookers as the Liberty Bell' is transported across the street, while the loss of potentially productive American citizens to brain damage due to malnutrition goes virtually unno­ticed. 
Who are the hungry in the United States? 
1) the elderly who live on fixed incomes. Police flies across the country indicate a growing tenden­cy on the part of senior citizens to shoplift food. 
2)school and pre-school children 

whose family situation denies them 
a nutritionaltv adeguate diet. A 
nutrition study of six primary 
schools on Manhattan's Lower 
East Side discovered that of the 619 
children tested, almost 3/4 re­
ceived less than half their daily 
requirement of vitamins, and that 
one in six exhibited excessive 
leanness and prominent abdomens. 
3) urban slum dwellers whose numbers swell as rural farm work­ers continue to be driven off the land. 
4) the rural poor, who constitute one ofthe largest "underdeveloped countries" in the world. This reflects the continued policy on the part of the government to subsidize and provide favored treatment to large corporate farm enterprises and to squeeze out the poor farmer and farm worker. 
5) Migrant workers are among those hardest hit. They rank among the worst housed, the least protected by law, and the hungri­est. Said one farmer on a 1960 documentary, "Harvest of Shame: "We used to own our slaves, now we just rent 'em!" 
6) Native Americans, who, ac­cording to federal statistics, suffer the most malnutrition, the most illness, and the highest, infanl­

We'd like to thank AI Sondej for the time and effort he has put into collecting at the dining halls for the past two years. Al's last collection will be on Tues., April 6. Members of ND-SMC World Hunger Coalition: Coalition for World Concern will continue the collections for the rest of this semester and next year. (Photos by Chris Smith)

The daily collection at the Notre Dame and St. Mary's dining halls is being continued this semester by AI Sondej at Notre Dame, and Greg Gramelspacher at St. Mary's. The money collected is being sent to five international relief and development agencies. The agencies are: Catholic Relief Services, CARE, UNICEF, OXFAM, and Church World Services. These agencies were selected because of their low administrative costs and their proven efficiency in self-help development projects. While trying to provide for the immediate needs of the poor in emergency situations, these agencies concentrate their resources toward long-term development projects. These projects consist of integrated programs dealing with all aspects of development including food and nutrition , agriculture, family planning, health, and education. 
Since the collection began in September, over $13,000 has been <:ontributed by the Notre Dame-St. Mary's Community.

Food Day and Food Policy 
by Doug Allen 

For most of us, food policy is something dished-out from on high: by distant government, impervious grocery chains, and fabled multi-national corporations. Helping set food policy-the rules of the game that regulate the supply, distribution, quality and price of food in other cities and towns, in response to our own needs, can teach us what years of school probably failed to teach: that policy is set by people; that it is written to serve somebody's in­terest; and that it might as well serve ours for a chance. Food Day, to be held on April 8th, is a day for participation, and through it, win­ning back control. 
On April 17, 1975, the first Food Day was celebrated nationwide with teach-ins, workshops, com­munity gardens, fasts and other consciousness-raising efforts. Last year the Notre Dame World Hun­ger Coalition sponsored a rice and tea meal, Mass , and speakers on the campus level. and helped organize many community action and consciousness-raising projects in the South Bend community. 
We expect Food Day '76 to be observed throughout the nation in a manner similar to last year and the Notre Dame World Hunger Coali-. tion: Coalition for World Concern, has planned a number of cons· cious-raising events for April 8th. 





"No Strings Attached'' 
EDITOR'S NOTE: The following article by Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, President of the University of Notre Dame, was published in the New York Times on Feb. 4. 
Fr. Hesburgh Is chairman of the board of directors of the Overseas Development Council in Wash­Ington. 
SOUTH BEND* Incl.--Ambassador 
from the United Nations gives an 
opportunity to re-examine a basic 
issue: Should the United States 
determine its foreign policies on 
the basis of whether they are right 
and just, rather than merely polit­
ically expe(,iient? 
The Administration's decision-­
which apparently originated with 
Ambassador Moynihan--to use all 
United States aid, including devel­
opment assistance, to punish or 
reward poor countries that vote 
against or support us in the United 
Nations seems to have been trig­
gered by the United Nations vote 
linking Zionism with racism, a silly 
and stupid resolution that deserves 
little more than to be condemned 
and summarily ignored. 
In any event, the new policy is a major setback for United States foreign relations. Indeed, it is both immoral and counterproductive: Immoral because it subordinates the survival and well-being of millions of suffering human beings to winning votes on transistory political issues, counterproductive because it may well achieve the opposite effect. 
Simply put, development aid cannot be used both to buy another country's support and to finance its economic and social development. To buy support, aid would have to be turned on and off as reward or punishment. 
But development requires a reli­
able flow of aid over a period of years to support long-term changes. Once aid is cut off, techniques are brought home, re­search work of many years is teminated, construction projects are closed down, and university-to­university programs must be sev­ered. All momentum is lost, and even if the aid is later renewed, the effort must begin again almost from scratch. Those who argue that we have a right to demand support for our objectives in return for economic assistance miss the whole point of development aid. It is not some­thing we do for other governments. Rather, it is, or ought to be, an investment we and they make together to solve certain human problems that our children and those in poor countries will other­wise inherit. It is a small investment that an appropriate regard for posterity and the well-being of humanity demands that we make. If the administration wants a political slush fund, our current programs of security assistance provide just such a tool. For my part, I will have no further interest in supporting bilateral develop­ment aid if it is to be used for political manipulation rather than for the improvement of the human condition in the poorest countries on earth. Ironically, the new policy is not simply immoral: It won't work. Anyone who has lived or traveled extensively in the developing world knows how really unlikely it is in this moment of rising nationalism that aid can be used to achieve short-run political ends. Indeed, the public unveiling of this policy has made it good politics for a developing-country leader to op­pose any United States position in international forums to prove his 
country's independence from "U. 
S. Nco-imperialism.'' 
How will we apply this new policy? Will we punish countries like Iran, Brazil, Egypt, Pakistan, or Nigeria--all of whom voted for the Zionism resolution? The news from Washington implies the oppo­site. Their raw materials (espec­ially oil) and political influence arc too important to us. 
Rather, it will be the Guyanas and Tanzanias of the world that suffer our wrath, because they can't fight back. Our country will be the neighborhood bully, picking only on those small kids who can't defend themselves. What a tragic Bicentennial stance for a country thar began as a small powerless nation daring to declare itself independent from the abuse of power! 
This is not the kind of foreign policy I want our country to pursue. 
Not, I trust, do our people endorse such a bankrupt and unworthy policy. Perhaps our only hope now rests with Congress. 
In recent years Congress has more and more strongly favored humanitarian and developmental uses for our foreign aid, resisting the traditional executive-branch propensity to use aid for political purposes. Last year, Congress even legislated limitations and specifi­cations for allocation our foreign assistance among countries by reserving the greater proportion of aid for countries and peoples most in need. The new State Depart­ment policy violates that standard. 
In this Bicentennial year our citizens of conscience throughout the country should reaffirm our committment to the universal, in­alienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness--and make it good politics for Congress and the executive branch to repre­sent these great American ideals.

Current activities The Education division, under the direction of Tim Beaty and Terry Barrett, have launched an important project this semester. They\orgamze education workshops and have trained about thirty coalition members to speak on global issues at grade schools, high schools, churches and businesses. Chris Brinegar is their liason with the schools. Forty-five students in Basil O'Leary's class in Food Population, and Energy will also have speaking engagements as a part of their coursework. Work­shops are conducted by Barb Robinson, AI Sondej, and Kitty Warner under the direction of Professor Basil O'Leary. They

consist of movies, handouts, and 
personal accounts of experiences in 
the Third World. Workshops are 
open to all coalition members and 
others interested. Anyone inter­
ested in attending should call Kitty 
Warner at 1328. 
The coalition would like to join 
together once a month to shape 
ideas and share concerns in a 
Vegetarian meal. The first meal 
was held March Sth, and organized 
by Rayne Carroll-Quinn and John 
Kenwood. It was great to gather 
people together who work separ­
ately on very diversified projects, 
to enjoy such delicacies as quiche­
lorraine, wheat-berry casserole and 
carob brownies. 
Jill Pascuzzo. Coalition secre­tary, needs help with a major project. She is compiling fact sheets and brochures describing our organization, in hopes that this information might help other simi­lar groups to form. Ginny Faust is investigatmg the posstblhty of a vegetarian line at the dining hall, and working with dieticians on recipies for bulk quantity vegetar­ian food on the regular lines. She also communicates on the national level with those knowledgeable in the field of a vegetarian approach to over-consumption of food. Kitty Warner and Jill Pascuzzo have received the support of many coalition members with the Action Reservoir. Whenever there is a sudden need for help with any coalition project, they have a reservoir of fifty volunteers of various talents to help them. Mary Hesburgh and Mike Bowler are editors-in-chief of our newspaper, with a staff of six. They hope to publish one newspaper each sem­
ester, at Thanksgiving and at Food Day. The biggest long-range project at hand is the preperation of a booklet 
to be distributed at pre-registra­
tion. Coordinated by Doug Allen 
and Mike Bowler, this booklet will 
be titled "Man In the Ecosphere." 
It will contain a compendium of 
course listings and course descrip­
tions of all Notre Dame and St. 
Mary's courses that confront global 
issues. This is to facilitate the 
choosing of electives in one clump 
or area of concentration. They are 
investigating the possiblity that a 
student would be able to earn a 
Global Studies Certification, or a 
minor in Global Studies in the years 
to come. 
St. Mary's has become increas­ingly involved in the coalition this year. Their thirty-six members, with SMC commission-er Barb Aste are working on such projects as dining hall contributions for a Wednesday night fast, and ini­tiating an optional payroll plan for SMC faculty and staff. To mark Food Day, on April 8th the dining hall has agreed to contribute a donation to hunger for each student who fasts. This fast is being coordinated by Mary Kay Schlos­ser, Mary Brassel, Mary Grogan and Kathy Carrigan. 
The ND-SMC World Hunger Coalition:Students for World Con­cern owes its success to many people. Doug Allen and Barb Robinson, co-coordinators, work a combine total of sixty hours per week.

Publicity is a big part of any organization, and expecially impor­tant in a group as diversified as our coalition. This important job is done by Ceyl Prinster, Ted Slaugh­ter, Julie Breed, and Mary Gfoaan. 
Much grateful thanks also aoes to Tom Reid, advisor, and BasU O'Leary, Faculty advisor, who bring clear minds and much wis­dom to solve each day's impossible problems.

In the midst of the ignorance and 
seemingly nonchalant attitudes 
there are attempts being made to 
help alleviate the misery of our 
nation's hungry. Two such pro­
grams are the school breakfast 
program and the Meals on Wheels 
program. Under the breakfast 
program, each state is required by 
law to start a school breakfast 
program in every school that 
applies and give a free breakfast to 
every child whose family income is 
under the poverty line, and supply 
schools in low income areas with 
equipment, storage and transporta­
tion costs. The Meals on Wheels 
program operates in New York 
City, one of more than 200 privately 
and publically sponsored programs 
serving hot lunches to 30,000 
elderly people daily. 
Although these programs are 
helping the hungry, much more 
needs to be done. One of the 
biggest pr" 'blems today is making 
people aw< :e of the situation, and

help. In th ! future, you need not

GLOBAL POVERTY FACTS AND FIGURES 
In developing regions of the world, 38% to 44 % of the population are under 15 years of age. In North America, 25o/o of the poulation are under 15 years of age. 
More than 85% of the rural population in developing countries have no access to safe water sources. 
Diseases such as diarrhea, cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid fever and amoebic dysentary are the main causes of sickness and death in the developing countries. Safe water sources can significantly reduce the incidence of these diseases. 
Over SO% of deaths in some developing countries are among children under age five. 
Many food taboos result in nutritional deprivation. For instance, in some countries women are not allowed to eat eggs or fish. 
Severe malnutrition in early childhood (age 1-5) can lead to such irreversible physical impairment as stunted growth, blindness and permanent brain damage, with resultant learning disabili­ties. 
In 2/3 of the world, 90% of rural women and 60 % of urban women are illiterate. 
In developing countries, many people use 80 % of their income just to buy food. How are they expected to manage with a 20% or more increase in prices? 
In 1974, India and Bangladesh were short 10 million tons of grain. Compare this with the fact that in the U.S.* 146 million tons of cereals were fed to animals. 
Fertilizer shortages are leading to export constraints in developed countries which increaes the price on the world market. FAO estimates a shortage of 2 million tons in 100 developing countries. In the U.S. we use 2 million tons a year on lawns, cemeteries and golf courses alone. 
177 million Indian cows are valuable resources. They ... 
a. 
Feed on forage and waste vegetation. 

b. 
Supply a large quantity of milk. 

c. 
Provide "tractor" power for farmers--especially now that fuel in India has quadrupled in price. 

d. 
Produce 8000 million tons of dung used for plaster in home building and as the main form of cooking fuel. 

e. 
Supply large amounts of badly needed fertilizer. 


Over 87% of the grain used in this country are fed to our meat producing animals. Since 1950, the average U.S. citizen has doubled his/her consumption of beef. 
200 million bushels of protein rich grains used to brew beer and distilled spirits in the U.S. 
The difference between average life expectancies in the developed countries and in developing countries is 20 years. 
Cost of food grain imports to developing countries this year is expected to top 8 billion, four times the total of just 3 years ago. 
Nations of the world spend $240 billion a year on armaments. 
One million tons of fertilizer are used on U.S. lawns and flower gardens a year. One pound of fertilizer can produce an additional 5-10 pounds of grain in a developing country. 
Poor nations must pay to import fuel for essential uses--irrigation pumps, farm-to-market transport, heating and cooking. Cost of oil has risen from 3 to 12 billion dollars per year, since 1972. 
The U.S., with 6% ofthe world's population, consumes at least 35% of world's resources. 
40% of all Americans are overweight as determined by medical standards. 
There are basically 5 kinds of meat and poultry compared with SO kinds of commonly eaten vegetables, 24 peas and beans, 20 fruits, 12 nuts and 9 grains. Vegetarian cookery is different, exciting, nutritious and tasty. Americans consume twice as much protein as they can use. The rest is used as energy or exceted, since our bodies cannot store protein. 
Harris survey found 75 % of the Americans polled are willing to go without meat 1 day a week in order to send food abroad to help nations with food shortages. 
Rich countries transfer 3 million metric tons of cereal protein to poor countries each year, but recieve 4 million metric tons of protein from poor countries in the form of oil seeds, oil seed products and fish meal. 
3V2 acres of land are needed to produce a meat and milk centered diet for 1 person. liS acre of land is needed to produce a diet based on plant protein for 1 person. 
An anthropologist's study of Tuscon, Arizona's municipal garbage estimates residents throw away $500,000 a year in steak alone. 
UNICEF INFORMATION CAPSULES 
UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, is a non-political, humanitarian organization that provides aid for hundreds of millions of children in Asia, Africa and Latin Amrica, regardless of their race, sex or religion or the politics of their parents. 
The lives of 60% of all children in developing countries are seriously threatened by malnutrition and curtailment of vital services caused by current economic conditions. As advocate for the world's children, UNICEF seeks to reverse these trends by assisting developing nations' programs to improve health, nutrition, education and social well-being of their children. 
Every dollar contributed to UNICEF for children's welfare is more than matched in goods, services and manpower by the developing countries that receive assistance. 
To help curb the rapidly increasing migration of poor families from rural areas to the cities' slums and shanty towns, UNICEF last year trained over 13,600 village leaders in 30 countries to encourage self-help projects for the improvement of local water supply, sanitation and health services. 
In its efforts to attack the basic causes of child malnutrition in developing countries, UNICEF advocates breast-feeding of infants and development of simple nutrition services based on the use of locally grown nutritious foods. 
UNICEF assists developing countries in meeting the essential needs of their children by helping establish packages of basic social services at the village level. These services for children and mothers include programs in interrelated fields of food and nutrition, clean water, health measures, family planning and basic education. 
The entire amount that UNICEF received in 1974 to help the desperately needy children ofthe world--about $115 million--was less than the world spent on armaments in five hours. 
UNICEF* the United Nations Children's Fund--is making special efforts to help child welfare in the world's poorest countries-­those with a yearly income, per person, of $80 or less. 
In many developing countries, 25 or 30 percent of the children die before their fifth birthday. In some areas, the mortality rate is as high as SO to 70 percent with lack of proper food the single biggest cause. UNICEF is helping countries provide food supplements, vaccines, antibiotics and other needed medicines to lessen this tragic toll. More than one-third of the world's children receive no education, and many of those wo do are unable to complete primary school. UNICEF--the United Nations Children's Fund--is helping more children get to school in Arica, Asia and Latin America. 
UNICEF--the United Nations Children's Fund--is currently aiding projects in over 100 countires, with a child population of over 850 million. Increasingly it concerns itself with specially vulnerable or disadvantaged groups--the very young, girls, children in slums, shantytowns and deprived rural areas. 
In Southeast Asia alone, 100,000 children go blind each year as a result of lack of Vitamin A. The price of a small bag of potato chips or candy bar--donated to UNICEF--can provide the Vitamin A capsules need to protect three children from blindness for an entire year. 
In 1974, UNICEF stipends helped to train over 86,000 child health and nutrition workers throughout the world. 
Only one-third of the world's babies are delivered in the presence of a trained attendant or midwife. UNICEF helps to train midwives and provide them with equipment, so that this proportion can be increased. 
Many of the contagious diseases so often fatal to undernourished infants in developing countries--diseases like cholera, typhoid, dysentery and worms--are caused or carried by contaminated water. UNICEF--the United Nations Children's Fund--provides drilling rigs, tube wells and other equipment to drill safe water wells.

Sweeney's is closing 
For years it had been a gathering place for returning alumni and Notre Dame students 

Swccnev's Shamrock has celebrated its last St. Patrick's Day. The famous Irish Har, rich with its Notre Dame history, will be closing sometime in the next few months, according to its owner, Mary Sweeney Looney, because of South Bend's Urban Renewal policies. 
The lease expires on August I, and Sweeney's should be closed sometime before then. The threat of Sweeney's possible closure has been around for the past eight years, she explained. The city of South Bend building inspectors, after surveying the building. have determined that repairs would be necessary or else the building would have to be condemned. The owner of the building. who lives in Florida. is uninterested in putting in $10,00 to $15,000 to make the necessary repairs. Therefore. the building will be torn down. lt is expected that a parking lot will replace the building. 
Sweeney's however, has enjoyed an important place in Notre Dame's history. 
For decades, it has been a meeting place for NO Alumni and students. Mary Sweeney Looney recalls that often young men would come in and tell her that their fathers had told them to stop at Sweeney's
whenever they were in town. "There are no other bars with our tradition," she explained, "People come in here from all over the country and keep coming back. It's the sort of place you come back to." 
It has been claimed that Sweeney's was

and Mary Sweeney to purchase the other  
half of the business from Mcinerny's  
widow, and to rename the place Sweeney's  
Shamrock. Sweeney himself died in 1958.  
His wife married Charles Looney in 1961.  
Mary recalled the war years when  
servicemen made up a large number of  
Sweeney's customers. Anyone in uniform  
was eligible to buy liquor, she explained,  
and whenever a serviceman left his name  
and address with her, she would send them  
cigarettes and candy each Christmas.  
"It was during the War that we first had  
an organist play regularly here," Mary  
recalled. "Roy Gravcel was the original  
organist, and he was responsible for  
installing the complex sound system we  
used." Graveel. however, was blind, she  
noted, and eventually committed suicide a

beer in pitchers. It's beginnings go back to the period shortly after prohibition, and a few years after f{ockne's death. It was founded by Mary's first husband, Paul Sweeney, and a friend he worked with on the South Bend News-Times, Bob Me­lnerny, who each put $500 towards its founding. It's original name was "Me­lnerny and Sweeney's," and about its possible failure as a successful business enterprise, Mcinerny once commented, "If we can't sell it, we can always drink it." 
But it's eventual popularity is history now, although Mcinerny's death a few years after the bar's opening, caused Paul plaincd, "since so many of our customers 
were politicians and policemen." 
The old South Shore used to empty 
nearby also, and in the days when Notre 
Dame visitors were forced to find lodgings 
further into South Bend area, Sweeney's 
became a meeting place for Notre Dame 
Alumni and fans throughout the city. 
"Our most crowded times in the past have been on home football weekends when the Alumni gather here to meet old acquaintences, and on St. Patrick's Day," Mary explained, herself being a Notre Dame football fan who has missed only two home 
games in the past thirty-five years. 
The walls inside Sweeney's are decorat­
grinning Rockne hangs on the wall behind 
the bar. 

Concerning other decorations in the bar, Mary related the story of how the enormous drawing of a Leprechaun was stolen from the premises while a crowd of Marquette fans tilled the bar during the NCAA play-offs a few years ago. The incident took place shortly before St. Patrick's Day, and the SB Tribune ran a story on how Sweeney's famous Lepre­chaun will not be spending St. Paddy's Day at home in Sweeney's. After a great deal of searching, the Leprechaun was located in a bar in Milwaukee and was eventually returned to Sweeney's. 
St. Patrick's Days have been an impor­tant and enduring tradition at Sweeney's. The number of people who would attempt 
to crowd the inside eventually necessitated the use of a pass to be admitted. The passes were usually uncommonly designed by Mary herself and kept the number of patrons at the capacity level. 
She recalled an incident, however, of when a number of students scaled a tree in the back of the building and managed to 
~ lind a way in without a pass. About Notre Damer students, she men­tioned a group of students who, in 1965, 
had frequented Sweeney's so often that they neglected their studies and failed to graduate on time. After the conclusion of., the additional semester, a mock graduation ceremony was conducted in the bar, complete with Sweeney's diplomas. "One of those students still has his Sweeney's diploma mounted on his wall at home, and can't remember where he put his Notre Dame one," she commented. · Sweeney's general popularity, however, is often said to be illustrated by the famous Sweeney's T-shirt. The original idea of having them made up, she explained, belonged to a Notre Dame student, Mark Weidner, back in 1964. The shirts are similar to jerseys in their durability and are made of 100 percent cotton. "We've sold thousands of them to people all over the world," she explained. "The original12 shirts are collector's items 
years despite the continued popularity of it's shirts. Multiple factors have been responsible for the decline, the most 
notable  being  the  lack  of  advertising  
outside  the  bar and  the lack  of upkeep  
within.  Urban redevelopment has threat­ 

ened to close the bar every year for the last 8 years, and Mary saw no need to invest more money in its existence in view of its possible, and indeed most probable. closing. 
There has been a marked decline in the numbers of Sweeney's patrons since 1968. The other factors contributing to this are its distance from campus and the nearness of its recently-sprung competition--such pia­ces as the Senior Bar, Nickie's, etc .. Lastly. Mary Sweeney Looney has confess­ed her wish to retire. 
"There is a hope I have that Sweeney's will not be closed forever." she noted. "I have placed the ownership of Sweeney's up for sale at a very reasonable price in hope that someone might buy the name and all the property inside the bar and move everything someplace else. I would like to see some students take it up and continue a wonderful tradition." 
For the present, however. no one has agreed on the purchase of Sweeney's. For months now some of its patrons have voiced their disbelief or disappointment at the possibility of this Notre Dame-South Bend "Institution" being closed forever. 
As she spoke about the history of Sweeney's Mary occasionally paged through old photographs and other assort­cd memorobilia she has collected from being a part of Sweeney's Shamrock so long. Among her keepsakes arc some Notre Dame yearbooks signed by the graduating seniors of a particular year who belonged to those who frequented Sween­ey's. 
"Some of the boys still send me flowers on either Mother's Day or St. Patrick's Day,'' she said. 
"It's going to be hard for me not to be sentimental about losing the place," she concluded, "But I suspect I'll always miss it a great deal."

First Round Picks 
This morning at 10 a.m. in New York City. the National Football League 
began its annual draft of collegiate players. Coaches. scouts. players. and 
draftniks. people like myst'lf who compile their own player lists as a 
hobby. have been preparing for this day for more than a year. This year's 
draft was shifted from its normal date in late January to April because of 
variou~ legal issues. 
Many people speculate upon what will actually transpire, but there arc always surprises. Here's my view of what could happen in the first round of !()(lay's draft: 
Tampa Bay begins the tirst round by selecting LeHoy Selmon, as had 
hl'L'n expected. Oklahoma's Selmon is the rock around whom John McKay 
can build his defense. 
Seattle thl·n pulls a mild surprise by selecting Pete Brock. the mammoth 
center from Colorado. Jack Patera has taken a page from Paul Brown's 
hook. d10osing to build his offensive line before his backfield. 
New Orleans. choosing third. quickly tabs Chuck Muncie of California. 
Mum·ic should tit in well with Archie Manning and the Saints' young 
offense. 
The S;tJ Diego fans arc still upset at the fact that the Chargers failed to 
-.ign Johnny Rodgers two years ago. In an attempt to appease their fans. 
the C'hagers sl'll'l't Ard1ic Griftin of Ohio State. 
New England. picking lifth. selects Mike Haynes of Arizona State. 
Hayne-.. a cornerback. should help shore up the weak Patriot secondary. 
Then the New York Jets tab Grambling's James Hunter, a super 
cornerback and a -.uper athlete. 
Cll'Vl'land. looking for a runner to pair with Greg Pruitt. decides upon 
Mi-.souri'-. Tony Galbreath. Bear Bryant still remembers the game 
G:dhreath had against the Tide last September. Detroit. after seeing their 
aging offensive line, picks Hay Pinney, a center from Washington. This is 
one of Detroit's two tirst round picks. 
The Atlanta Falcon~· turn is next and they choose Larry Gordon. a 
lindHll'ker from Arizona State. The Sun Devils' defense was excellent this 
year. and the fact that they have had two players selected in the first nine 
picks bears this out. 
Chicago's glorious Bears arc next and General Manager Jim Finks tabs 
Penn State linebacker Greg Buttlc. He will be reunited with former 
teammate Mike Hartenstein. a Finks selection of a year ago. 
Cincinnati has the Eagles pick and Paul Brown opts for Bennie Cunningham. the Clemson tight end. He did not have a great senior season but Brown sees him as a replacement for Bob Trumpy. New England's Chuck Fairbanks then quickly grabs his former star Joe Washington. With an inside runner like Sam Cunningham the Pat's offense should now be set. 
My favorite. the New York Giants, not known for their astute drafting, 
finally get wise and select Notre Dame's own Steve Niehaus. The Giants 
desperately needed a stay at home defensive tackle and Niehaus fills that 
need. 
Kansas City picks the tirst quarterback in the draft. San Diego State's Craig Penrose. The Chiefs have had their share of poor picks in recent years. Denver's John Ralston then selects a local boy, Colorado State's Kevin McClain. McClain should play middle linebacker, moving Randy Gradishar to the outside. 
With their second pick in the first round the Lions tab Purdue's Ken 
Novak. The pros love Novak's size but his desire has been questioned. 
Don Shula then will usc Miami's first pick to strengthen his secondary, by 
choosing Tim Fox. an Ohio State safety. 
With Buffalo's three man line. the nose man is important. UCLA's Cliff 
Frazier is ideal for this position. Shula then opts for big Joe Devlin, the 
Iowa offensive guard. Bob Kuchenbcrg's demands to be traded probably 
forced this pick.

Irish track program on the move 
by Monte Towle 
When one looks past the revenue sports of football, hock·;y and basketball at Notre Dame, an entourage of varsity sports is seen to supplement a university sports program that carries a reputation of the highest esteem. 
However, some critics may ques­tion whether or not these "other" varsity sports carry their share of the weight in enhancing Notre Dame's sports reputation. Our fencing teams of recent years undoubtedly point to an affirmative vote of support. But, how about the track program, for example? It made a similar positive contribu­tion at one time, but its present status demands a second look. 
First-year track coach Joe Piane is readily aware of the situation and offers some of his own views: 
"The Notre Dame track pro­gram of the 1960's was an excellent one. getting its share of the national spotlight. At the present though. we are a very young team in the middle of a rebuilding stage." he said. 
Apparently, a substantial change in the Notre Dame track program has taken place in recent years, one involving a decrease in the quality of the program. "The number of grant-in-aids allotted to the the Notre Dame track program is below the current NCAA limit of fourteen. 

In order to attract more good athletes, it is necessary to give out more grants-in-aid.,'' Piane stated. 
Another view is added by Jay Miranda, a freshman from Cleve­land who has established himself as a middle distance runner of note for the Irish. He puts forth his reasoning concerning the status of Notre Dame track. "I came to Notre Dame realizing that the track program is turnining itself back around and beginning to rebuild," he said. "It is difficult to turn a program around because one bad recruiting year can have a snow­balling effect for subsequent years. 
This seems to be the case at Notre Dame. To entice the good athlete to come here, we must present an attractive program image. We are starting to do that now." 
A veteran of four years, senior co-captain Jim Hurt fuses both previous ideas into an insightful perspective. 
"In my first three years here, the track program went downhill every year. Several years ago, the number of grants-in-aid available to us was cut in half, thus cutting down on the number of good, available tracksters need to sustain 
Soccer club rolls to wins 
by Chip Scanlon 
The Notre Dame club soccer team continued to dominate its opponents this weekend as it rolled over Illinois Benedictine, 8-1. The club downed St. Meinrad College last weekend by a margin of 7 to 2. 
After a scoreless three minutes the Irish exploded for three goals in a little over a minute and from that point on the game was never in doubt. Jim Donovan tallied first and was quickly followed by team­mates Tom Mulvey and Roman Klos. The score grew as Mike Volberding dribbled in unaccosted on a breakaway and put Notre Dame up 4-0 at the half. 
The only thing that was in jeopardy in the second half was Mark Klein's shutout as the de­fense, led by cocaptain John Thorn­ton continued to turn back scoring threats. Roman Klos. Tom Mulvey and Randy Wittry finished with two goals apiece for the game.

N.Y. gets Csonka 
NEW YORK AP -Star fullback Larry Csonka returned to the National Football League Wednes­day. signing with the New York Giants for a reunion with Coach Bill Arnsparger. 
Arnsparger had been an assis­tant coach with Miami when the star running back helped the Dolphins to consecutive Super Bowl championships in 1973 and 1974. Since then, both had left Miami--Arnsparger for New York and Csonka for the ill-fated World Football League. 
The announcement by the Giants Wednesday night ended a bidding war for the one-time Dolphins' star and returned to the NFL the biggest name the WFL ever had. 
The terms of Csonka's contract with the Giants were not immed­iately known, but it was known that he --or his agent, Ed Keating --had been demanding a multiyear con­tral"t worth in the neighborhood of $250.000 a year plus a variety of cash bonuses and fringe benefits. 
Crew regatta set 
The Notre Dame Rowing Club will compete in a regatta at 1 p.m. this Saturday on the St. Joseph River. The Irish will face crews from Wayne State University, Grand Valley and Culver Military Academy. The crew bus will pro­vide transportation to the racing site at 12:30 p.m. from the main 

... 
circle. Spectators will be able to see the finish of the race from the Bittersweet Bridge. 
Illinois Benedictine finally tallied with 40 seconds left as coach Bob Connolly sent in the second unit including goalie John Kirby. 
Last weekend the Irish opened up by outplaying St. Meinrad by a score of 7-2. With a 3-1 lead by virtue of goals by Roman Klos, Bill Hagerty and John Talbot, the Irish coasted past St. Meinrad. Second half scoring was done by Roman Klos, Bill Hagerty, Jay O'Laughlin and Bob Gildea. 
The Irish face DePaul and North­western this Saturday and Sunday in Chicago with both games getting underway at 1:00 p.m. 

the level of our program," he noted. ''This has resulted in an inability to compete favorably with national track powers because of a lack of depth." 
"This year, I have become aware of a significant change.'' he contin­ued. The program is on the upswing thanks to good organiza­tion and an improved mental attitude. In addition, the freshmen we brought in this year have really built a foundation to grow on and the future is indeed looking quite bright. 
The aspect of the academic element at Notre Dame is influen­tial in the success of maintaining a strong track program. "Our aca­demic standards here are an as­set," he said. Naturally we do lose a percentage of potential track stars who can't meet these stand­ards, but a majority of today's athletes realize the importance of a good education and are willing to come to Notre Dame to attain it. Anaddedattraction is the quality of competion on our schedule." 
Indeed, the Notre Dame track team does face a schedule of powerful competition that will con­tinue to lure track stars wanting to prove themselves. 
''The only way for us to improve is to go up against a share of the strongest competition in the coun­try," said Miranda. "A school's sports schedule ranks high among the considerations mulled over by high school prospects when select­ing a college as was the case with me and Notre Dame. I've been quite satisfied with the quality of competition when I realize that we've faced teams like Wisconsin and Penn State, with Vilanova and the Drake Relays among others yet to come.'' 
Hurt adds, "We have faced, by far. some of the best track powers in the country. We make it a point not to shy away from major comptetition. We are not in a league with a Michigan or an Alabama, although we are current­ly competitive in the middle and long distance running events.'' 

Track coach joe Piane is hopeful of building a strong track program at Notre Dame. [Photo by Tony Chifari] 
"Within 3 or 4 years, we should be on a level with these national powers." he continues. "Besides. the NCAA has decreased the maximum number of grants-in-aid allowed for each university's track program and when this goes in effect, it will give Notre Dame a boost in achieving equality." 
It would appear that the Notre Dame track program is on a return route to national prominence al­though Coach Piane restrains him­self from being over optimistic. Cautiously he adds, "We're look­ing ahead to the future and are set in developing the track program to a greater extent. We do have a long way to go." 
Piane's guarded optimism is justly waranted, but one can look

Red Sox to repeat? 
ahead to the years lying not far away when the Notre Dame track program regains the respect that has diminished in the last few years. However recognition is needed. 
Miranda states, "We are not a money-making sport so it is harder for the campus to regard track as a major sport. It doesn't bother me too much that we have to take a back seat to the revenue sports. We do get our share of recognition, here and there." 
Hurt offers a more critical look, "Overall, the track program is regarded as a minor sport. The passive attitude of the local media is a major reason. Improved publicity can only benefit our track program. 

OnP of the two eccentric geniuses. Bill Veeck. claims that to win a pcnn:-.nt you need either speed or power. Even though Ve·~ck should be rt. nning out of imaginative ideas, this is one of the fundamental keys. Yd the key weapon is pitching. particularly relief pitc.1ing. So natura:ly after adding these C')mponents, it is simple to contem;Jlate the teams to beat. 
The signif,cant t: attern in the divisional setup. p trticularly in the East, is that nne ba I month often decides the race. Two years ago the Rd Sox went int 1 one of those nightmarish h.tting and more importantly s.:oring -lroughts in September. Thus, th· Orioles on a hot >treak wiped out a s ~ven game lead and won the flag. Last season the Yankees. pla.~ued l y Bobby Bonds' leg injury, won only six of 26 games in July to drop from the race. So staying out of a major slump is 
mportant for 111 of the teams in the league. Here are I1Y picks for 197tJ in the Americm League

Boston: The Ferguson Jenkins deal should bolster an already solid pitching staff.

Joining the Canadian ace will be the 36-year-old Dominican Dandy, Luis Tiant who won 1d games last season. Rick Wise and Bill Lee round out the starting staff. The Sox are strong in the bullpen with sidearmer Jim Willou~ by and : outhpaw Tom House acquired from Atlanta for Rogelio Mo.·et. Outside Yankee Thurmon Munson, catcher Carlton Fisk is the best recei"er in the circuit. Paced by Fred Lynn, Jim Rice. Cecil Cooper. Rico Petrocelli and Carl Yastrzemski the Red Sox can't bt stopped at t 1e }late. Baltimore: With Jim Palmer, Ken Holtzman. Ross Grinsley and Mike Cuellar the Birds bolster one of the strongest staffs in baseball. Grant Jackson is a goJd left-handed reliever, but they're short on the right side. The Orioles' defense is the best there is, but even with Reggie: Jackson their I-itting is inconsistent. The weak bullpen and their in :onsistent hitting will keep the Birds from taking the Sox. New York: Cathh Hunter is the best pitcher in the game, and if Dock Ellis, Ken Brett and Ed Figueroa can stay free of injuries they could bring a pennant to the Yankees. As good as the starting staff is, the bullpen isn't. In fact it's pathetic. The defense is strong in the outfield with Roy White. Elliot Maddox and Mickey Rivers, but it's weak up the middle. The Yankees have a number of strong singles and doubles hitters. but are"' eak on power. The addition of Rivers gives the Yanks a 1 00-steal threat. Cleveland: The pitching is still a question mark. Can Dennis Eckersly continue to pitch like last season when he was the top rookie pitcher in the league? Can Pat Dobson win 20 games again? here are just too many question marks to tell how good this club is. 
~~~~AmericanLeaguePk~Detroit: Inexperience is the problem on this promismg young staff. John Hiller is an excellent reliever, but the rest of the Tiger pitchers are untested. On defense the infield is solid. but the outfield lacks range. The addition of Rusty Staub has to help this club. If the Tigers can't improve on last year's 57-102 mark. they'd better fold. 1\Jilwaukee The Brewers' pitching and defense are adequate anrl promising. despit.:! being along ways from being good. Outside George Scott and a fading Hank Aaron, the Brewers are one of the worst hitting tean1s in b; seball

Oakland: Charlie 0. shocked everyone in the baseball world with his Jackson-Holtzman trade. but he knows what he's doing. The deal leaves the starting staff somewhat depleted, but still strong with Vida Blue,Stan Bahnsen and Mike Torrez. The Oakland bullpen is the best in the 5ame with Rollie Fingers leading the way. The A's hitters don't impress you with their averages, but they're clutch hitters. Add this to a good defense and you have another Oakland divisional flag. l~ansas City: The Royals have a strong pitching staff with the possible exception of a southpaw in the bullpen and a great defense. But for the Royal.;, the name of the game is hitting and they are led by John Maybary, the neo-McCovey. You can look for the Royals to win at least s:. games this season, but it won't be enough. California: The pitching is strong up front with Frank Tanana, who's another Koufax. But the relief pitching is shallow and the defense is weak. Led by Lee Stanton, Bobby Bonds and Bill Melton, the Angels have improved themselves at the bat. The single most important factor to this club is speed they can run on anyone and do. If the Angels can find a fourth starter to join Nolan Ryan, T;,_nana and Hassler, and add some help in the bullpen, this club could ~urprise some people. Minnesota: The Twins starting staff is strong, but the bullpen is pitifuL 
The defense is we1k and their speed is almost non-existant. But Minnesota's hitting is second only to Boston. Gene Mauch will improve this team, but not enough to challenge. Texas: The pitching situation for the Rangers outside of Gaylord Perry looks grim. Bill Singer is just a shadow of the great prospect that he once was and the bullpen is weak. The Rangers can't run or hit. Look for Texas to battle with Chicago for last place. Chicago: 1he White Sox have a young and promising staff. Wilbur Wood will more than likely return to the bullpen to join Rich Gossage to give Chicago a strong relief corp. Cleon Jones and roadrunner Ralph Garr will aid Jorge Orta at the plate, and the palehose should be pesky Overall the Sox are relying on the young and inexperienced, and the pressure of a long season will be too much to bear. Playoffs: After the dust has cleared, the A's will have beaten the Red Sox in five games. The Sox just don't have the baserunners to take the revenge-minded A's.
