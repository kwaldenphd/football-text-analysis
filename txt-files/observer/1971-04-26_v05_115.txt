Q. At a recent SLC meeting you called the present University Judicial Code "the product of several years of negotiation." Could you elaborate on this viewpoint? 
A. The traditional administration of university rules was by the Dean of Students or by a panel advising the dean of students. That existed as far back as I can remember; it was here in the late forties and early fifties when I was a student. 
In 1968 Rich Rossie was the Student Body President and he expressed a desire to come up with a more formal structure which was in keeping with some of the federal court decisions concerning student discipline around the country, Dixon vs. Alabama and the Tinker case which was then in court. We agreed that this was a feasible idea, that we could talk about the possibility of creating hearing panels that be not just administrators but would ~epresent the whole community. We spent a

Q. Could you describ~ this list and some of it~ sources?

There were, I believe, taken almost entirely from the NSA manual: They weren't given as careful treatment as I b~lieve they should ha~e been because at the same perwd we were attemptmg to, by com­mittee, rewrite the student manual so that we can to the very end and all the sudden everything had to go in at one time. 
Q. Is this Student Rights section the same one that is now in the code? 
A. Still the same one that is presently in the Student Manual. 
Q. Who, specifically, was involved in the negotiation you mentioned. 
A. Rich's year was followed by an almost full year of discussion with the Student Life Council appointed committee of which the principle members were Fr. Riehle and myself, Assistant Dean Faschio from the Law School, Fred Dedrick and two others. These were the principle people. 

Q. What was the product of these discussions? 
A. We wrote kind of the "Revised Indiana Criminal Code" in some ways. As Fred has st_ated it was a lawyers' code. But we attempted to wnte a code that would answer the basic problems, that would create a procedure so that a person picking it up for the first time would understand what he was supposed to do and when he was supposed to do it, and a serious attempt to interpret the rules in terms of how they would be ad­ministered. But it was a very complex code. 
Q. What happened to that code? 
A. This code was before the Student Life Council in the beginning of 1969 for six or seven months. At the end of that period it may have been passed at one stage and referred back to the council, you have to check the minutes I'm not sure. I know Father Hesburgh asked them to re-do a couple of parts of the code I believe that it was at that stage, when it came back to the council for just a couple of paragraphs to be~ revised, that Phil McKenna made the point that he felt it was just a travesty to have such a formal code in a Christian community. I picked that up immediately and said as one of the draftsmen of the code that I felt if the students didn't it or were displeased with the code,

Continued from page 1 
there was no point in changing the existing University code, which had continued to exist right up until that time. 
Q. What did you do then? 
A. I suggested that perhaps we take a completely different tact and attempt to table this code which was known as the Faschio code, and to re-write it and come up with something less formal, something that might be more pleasing in terms of informality. 
For example one of the points that was made was that very rarely are cases that come into dispute (disciplinary cases) very rarely is there a question of guilt. 
In the three trials that we had at the university level there was never a question of whether the student accuses had committed the offense, The .argument was always whether the rule was a good rule, whether he should be punished for breaking it because he wanted to break it, ...etc. etc. 

Q. How do these questions of the correctness of a rule affect the judicial process? 
A. That type of discussion, in a sense does not lend itself very well to legal administration. That whole theory doesn't lend itself very well to legal ad­ministration. 
Perhaps what was needed was a less formal code that would recognize the special c'r­cumstances with which this very

Joint senior elections set 
Election Board Chairman Orlando Rodriguez announced last night that approval has been given to conduct Joint senior class elections with St. Mary's. Rodriguez claimed that Junior Class President Suzie Way had told him there was no interest at St. Mary's in the senior class government and reportedly urged him to allow the joint elections. 
"Because of the reported lack of interest at St. Mary's it was claimed that there would not be a class government at St. Mary's. Rather than having this happen it was thought best to have some Se!lior class government," he sa1d. 
Rodriguez remarked that this will not affect the graduation ceremonies for the class of '72. He said that this matter would have to be decided by the ad­ministrations of both schools. 

"It was felt that since coeducation was coming," Rodriguez said, "the best place to start would be class government since they are a parallel struc~ ture to student government, but not as complex." 
Petitions for all the class of­fices will be accepted at the Notre Dame student government office until five o'clock today.

Tracey announcement 
I am running for a seat on the Student Life Council for two main reasons. 
The first is because of my stance on coeducation and the Notre Dame-St. Mary's relationship. Since coeducation through merger will be a reality, students should move ahead wherever possible instead of being an afterthought by which both schools and their students can benefit. If contributions from both sides are incorporated it stands to reason the probability of realizing this potential increases. SMC has unique aspects to offer ND. Two examples would be com· munity government, and a counseling, not disciplinarian role of the R.A.'s. Unless students are active now, instead of waiting three years as proposed by the present student government and administration, much will be lost. Finally, on the practical side, it only makes sense that a transition would be facilitated if SMC had a say in those policies she is expected to accept. 
I am running for the SLC, then, secondly, because I have something valuable to offer in the light of the above points. As the "has been" SBP of St. Mary's I have a working knowledge and experience with the structure and politics of the two schools. This involves both that of student and community-wide government. (My past ND-SMC par­ticipation includes activities like the joint academic council, the coeducation report, and thz coordinating committee.) 
I understand there is some question of the legality of my running for this posit ion. This may be true, but rules should change to fit changing situations. Although SMC had been given three non-voting SLC memberships, this is con­descending tokenism. If we are not going to accept merger in the most meaningful form possible, we can hardly term ourselves educationa I institutions. 


Rodriguez obiection 
There is one Saint Mary's student who petitioned to run for the Notre Dame Student Life Council. We feel you must consider the following facts. We ask that you leave aside any consideration of sex and look at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's just as two separate institutions. 
--The SLC was created by the Notre Dame Board of 
!I Trustees for the Notre Dame community. It has no power whatsoever where Saint Mary's College is concerned, that is, the legislation it passes well affect Notre Dame directly and Saint Mary's only indirectly. 
--Saint Mary's will have a voice in the SLC, for at the April, 5 meeting an invitation was extended to the Saint Mary's Student Affairs Committee to send one student, one faculty, and one administrator to voice the feelings of Saint Mary's College on the legislation considered. Of course, it will be up to Saint Mary's to accept this invitation; however, there is every reason to assume that they will do so. 
Moreover, the option was left open to extend voting privileges at any time in the future. 
--Any student running for the SLC must represent only Notre Dame students. As such, this student must voice the Notre Dame students' feelings and opinions, and vote on legislation which will affect Notre Dame students (i.e. Sophomore cars, judicial code, parietal hours, etc.). Thusly, we feel that a Saint Mary's student would not be represen­tative of the Notre Dame student body. Once again, a Saint Mary's student elected by the Notre Dame student body to sit on the SLC will not be representing Saint Mary's, for, as it has been mentioned, the SLC has no jurisdiction at Saint Mary's. 
--The need for a legislative body which will have jurisdiction over both campuses is obvious. However, at this point, this body is not the SLC, for although it has taken the preliminary steps, its present constitution will not allow it to be concerned with both schools. 
In light of all of the above, we the undersigned members of the Election Committee believe that a Saint Mary's student should not be elected as a member of the Student Life Council, for such a step is premature. Thusly, only Notre Dame students will be considered for positions in the SLC. 
We realize there will be a lot of controversy regarding this decision so we urge anybody with a question to please call 7417 or 7668 and leave your name and phone number so we can answer it. We will also be happy to attend any section meeting, hall council meeting, etc. and explain our decision.

Let Her Run! 
Ann Marie Tracey's candidacy for the Student Life Council isnotpremature. The benefits of having a representative of St. Mary's student body, with voting privileges, on the SLC are obvious. They go beyond the simplistic arguments of "a female voice" or "an informally merged student body." An SMC student should be seated on the SLC because every facet of student life at Notre Dame increasingly affects St. May's students also. If ths SLC is genuinely concerned about the real problems of being in the transition stage from informal coeducation to recognized merger. then it must agree that every action it takes in the next two years besides affecting Notre Dame students will also affect every girl at St. Mary's, since inevitably there be be one student body. 
Orlando Rodriguez, Jim Clarke and Bob Sauer, election committee members, had no choice but to declare Miss Tracey's candidacy out of order. We can sympathize with the awkward position they were in. From a legal viewpoint they were forced to declare that since a girl from SMC was not officially a student at Notre Dame, she could not run. To the students of the noth quad, though the legal argument that she is not, technically, a Notre Dame student may be meaningless. As a student from St. Mary's she is not in the same class as "a student from Berkeley." Even though the notion of a single community may be only an idea as far as the Trustees are concerned, the notion of a unified student body is already a reality to many students. Student government has recognized this by moving towards a merger. Students have recognized this by taking courses on both campuses. Even the SLC recognized this by granting speaking rights to one SMC student, faculty member and administrator. 
In that action though they did not go far enough. The SLC should have sea ted the three representatives from St. Mary's with full privileges and then sent the rna tter to the trustees for final approval. The Trustees might not accept the decision to seat, with voting privileges, members of the SMC community, but ths force of SLC agreement has strengthened othzr proposals that were unpopular with the Trustees (notable example: parietals). 
The SLC is meeting today and still has an opportunity to correct its blunder. The members can either seat the three representaties from St. Mary's on the cokncil with voting rights, or insure Miss Tracey's eligibility for membership, by declaring both SMC and ND undergraduates eligible for elections. Unless they do this, the council will be exhibiting its characteristic fear, hesitiation, and procrastination in the face of a situation that calls for some bold decisive action.

Private Smith runs foward. Sure he's scared but fear, doesn't stop enemy bullets --only he can do that. B-b-b-b-r-r-a-att. He pours a few rounds into a machine gun nest. Another enemy soldier pops up, Private Smith bayobets him. Private Smith continues his charge. He's hit..He falls. The next day he is awarded the Silver Star. Posthumously. 
Donald Neuman has just finished building a school. He brushes several months of sweat from his brow as he looks with pride at his accomplishment. The flies have congregated around his face in the stifling heat of the Amazon. The building is no wonder of the world. It isn't architecture to turn Christopher Wren green with envy. But it is a school, the first the village ever had. Sure the Peace Corps had given him funds, and undoubtably he would never have finished without the villagers help. But it is still his school; the villagers show it by the gratitude in their faces. Donald Neuman is their glimpse of America. 
Private Smith and Donald Neuman have something very interesting in common. The United States law says they aren't adults. Oh, due to recent developments, they can voice their choice for President of the United States. But the law doesn't recognize their right as adults, as true masters of their own lives. 
The United States law says that when a person is nineteen, he can be drafted, and taught to fight and if need be to kill. The defense of the United States is presently running on faith in the ability of people it does not consider as adults. We tell an eighteen year old, "You are responsible enough to be trusted with an M-16, but not with a family. We will send you to Latin America and give you the job of helping improve the lives of a hundred people. But you aren't mature enough to sign a legal contract!" 
What sort of madness is this? What sort of insane asylum gives a person responsibilities that involve the lives of people, gives a person the right to make decisions that effect others' lives, but does not grant him an adult's right to decide his own life? There is a student on campus enrolled in an ROTC. He was on scholarship, but doubts about the program caused him to ask to be released. He was granted a release, primarily on the grounds that he was not the magic age of twenty-one and therefore the contract he had signed with Uncle Sam was not valid. But if he had enlisted in one of the services as an enlisted man, he could very possibly ended up maintaining equipment with destructive power measured in millions of tons of TNT. 
The irony of the matter is the most recent change in the situation is perhaps the only one with an argument against worth a damn. A reasonable theory could be made by a person with a three digit IQ that voting is a responsibility that should come after the fulfillment of some duty to the country. Voting involves control of national policy, one could argue that one should be obedient to national authority a while before one is allowed to shape. Its a shaky line of reasoning but something a sane person could follow. _ 
Why does this lunacy exist? One reason is a strange malady in America today. The trend in America seems to be in the direction of democratic totalitarianism. More and more the individual is divested of his right to make decisions for himself. The right of a citizen seems to be that he is allowed to vote on laws that will decide what everyone will do. Nobody is allowed to decide for oneself, instead on makes laws that decide for everybody. No you may not drink cyclamates. No you may not see cigarette commercials. You are not responsible enough to decide for yourself so the democratic progress must decide for you. For your own good. 
This schizophrenia would justify a twenty-one year old majority, while an eighteen year old vote. Deciding what other people do, is by this perversion of reason, is a basic right, while deciding oneself is a very limited right reserved only for the Most Wise. 
There are other reasons for the twenty-one majority. One is that it allows eighteen year old to use the law to parasite off their parents. The stupidity here is two-fold. Mauy students enjoy leeching off dear mom and dad. But also many moms and dads like to be leeeched off to keep their children dependent. This preserves their precious little hallucination that their twenty year old is still a child who needs them and who they can ego trip off of by telling to get a haircut. 
The end to this lunacy is rather simple. The age of majority must be lowered with all due haste to the age of eighteen.

··suffering, dying and death··-a seminar for pre-meds by morton kelsey 
Last spring, a few pre-medical students with the aid of Charles McCarthy, then a professor in the Program of Non-violence, Morton T. Kelsey, a professor in Graduate Education, and the late Dr. Lawrence H. Baldinger, then the chairman of Pre­?rofessional studies, instituted a course to explore the problems involved in caring for the terminally ill patient. We were concerned about the lack of attention given by medical education to the psychological suffering of the dying patient in a world where advanced technology and science, although prolonging his life, often tend to deper­sonalize the patient. 
We were worried not only about the care of the dying; the effect of daily contact with enormous suffering seemed to have taken its effect also on the medical profession itself. Some of the more obvious signs of the resuling emotional instability are revealed in the high rates of suicide, drug addiction, and alcoholism within the profession. Since the greatest portion of a medical student's education is concerned with the scientific aspect of medicine, most young physicians seem emotionally un­prepared to face the suffering, especially the in­tense emotional pain found in the terminally ill patient. Surely, American society with its numerous denials of and escapes from death offers little support to those people who must be faced daily with the care of the sick and dying. · 
Although it is not always the case, many doctors relate to a patient in only a scientific manner which often results in the objectification of the patient. Medicine becomes then only a business-the more intangible, emotional needs of the patient, especially the terminally ill patient, are often over­looked. When a doctor does try to open himself in a more humane manner to the dying individual, he must often wrestle with his own sanity because of his anxieties about death that can be stirred up by such an encounter. The common occurrence of impersonal health care and the existence of such frightening statistics as the above seem to say that many physicians have not been able to adequately 
resolve their relationship to the patient's emotional suffering. 
Entitled "Suffering, Dying, and Death", the seminar is under the direction of Prof. Morton T. Kelsey, a former pastor of St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Monrovia, California who is also a 
Jungian analyst. Professor Kelsey's past ex-


perience has brought him into daily contact with intense psychological suffering, often the emotional trauma of the terminally ill individual. As everyone in the seminar has agreed, Professor Kelsey's contribution to the course goes far beyond words; his life is an example of a man opening himself to the sufferings of others in order to relieve that pain. Very few men have combined so well an excellence 
in professional knowledge and a deep, personal 
concern  for  those  individuals  with  whom  he  is  
working.  
The  first  part  of  the  seminar  was  spent  in  

discussing readings directly concerned with the suffering of the dying patient. The need to explore our own anxieties and attitudes about death soon became apparent. We realized that if death is a big problem in our own life, viewed as a frightening, horrible, taboo topic, we would never to able to face it calmly and helpfully with a patient. Only after we had become capable of talking about our fears concerning death, could we talk with the dying person about his needs. 
To explore such problems took a great deal of openess, a willingness to share deep feelings about ourselves. Thus, the seminar later broke down into smaller groups of five people which provided a much more personal level for opening oneself. In opening ourselves to our own and others problems in the seminar, an honest sharing took place, resulting in the beginning of a self-acceptance of our fears. For some of us, this acceptance of our anxieties about dying and suffering was only the beginning of the exploration into many other fears, all of which hindered the possibility of our being open to another's similar problems. 
No concrete "techniques" and "methods" in the caring for the terminally ill patient came out of the class. Some of the things that did evolve were a greater understanding of our own problems with death, an openess to explore further such concerns, and a more sensitive ability to listen to another person relate his anxieties. The sort of listening and sharing that took place in the seminar may have been the most valuable insight of the whole course. 
The same seminar will be carried on next year by similar students who see the same need. It has been approved by Father Walters, the new chairman of Pre-Professional studies, and will again be under the direction of Morton T. Kelsey. Those people interested can sign up for the course with Father Amen of the Non-violence department.

the south bend-mishawaka walk for international development 
Sponsored by the American Freedom from Hunger Foundation, Walks in the United States raised more than $2% million, in 1970. The Walk for Development idea originated in Europe under the sponsorship of the United Nations Young World Development Program. On May 8 and 9, International Walk Weekend, we will be joined by people in 44 countries and 400 cities in the United States. 
The goals for the total community are: 
-to bring awareness, education, and sensitivity of the international problems of hunger and poverty to the community 
-to raise funds for projects to combat hunger and the conditions that lead to hunger 
-to involve youth and coordinate their efforts into a positive program -to unite and strengthen the entire community through speaking and acting. -to strengthen the image of youth in the community 
The Walk for Development will take place on May 8, 1971. It will cover ap­proximately 25 miles, each walker going as far as possible. Each walker is to obtain pledges from one or as many sponsors as he can. Primarily youth will be involved, but there is no age limit. The sponsor must agree to donate at least a set amount for each mile. Sponsors may be friends, relatives, business people, companies, anyone. The pre-arranged route will begin and end at Potawotami Park. Walkers will present their checkpoint cards for stamping at various points on the route to certify the distance they have completed. After the Walk, the walker will show his sponsor the checkpoint card and the sponsor will pay him the pledged amount per mile. The walker may either mail in the donation to the Walk Post Office Box, or take them to any branch of the First Bank and Trust Company, for deposit. All contributions are tax deductible. 
Local self-help organizations receive 
42.5 percent of the money, while another 
42.5 percent is given to foreign projects. The remaining 15 percent assists the American Freedom from Hunger Foun­dation with expansion of their educational program dealing with population, pollution, illiteracy, hunger, poverty, and the continuance of Walks in other cities. 
The Meadowbrook Corporation, 52792 Hastings Road will establish a Day-Care Center. Since 1968, concern and efforts of the people themselves have maintained a donated two-car garage as a social service center. A non-profit corporation, it is head by a 12 member Board of Directors. Backed by small donations, and com­munity support, the Walk money will pay the director of the Day Care Center, food for the children and supplies. 
The second local project is sponsored by the Broadway Christian Parish. Known for it's many programs, the Church and South East Neighborhood Association, are bringing a Community Organizer to South BenJ. Beginning in June, the black seminarian's duties will include working with the continuous education program for children. and being a street worker. 
The first project is the Peace Corps' School Partnership Program in Brazil. Begun in 1964, the program has involved more than 120 projects. 60 percent of the people in this region are illiterate. For $1,750, a three classroom school can be built for 120 students, and doubled as an adult literacy center at night. The com­munity in Brazil provides local volunteer labor, a title to the land, local building materials, and partial cash contribution 

whenever possible. The community works together for the 3 to 6 months necessary for ·construction, with the assistance of Peace 
Corp volunteers. An understanding and 
culture exchange are enhanced by a pen-
pal relationship between the donator of funds, and the students in Brazil. 
The second foreign project is Nutritional Aid to Remote Indian Tribes in Mexico. The corn culture and the centuries-old food patterns lead to malnutrition. to
40 60 percent of the children under four die of 
malnutrition. Since 1968, the Meals for 
Millions Foundation has worked with over 
100 tribal groups. For $500, 50 persons will receive 50 grams of Protea per day for a year. Also, the Meals for Millions Foun­dation has adult education classes discussion_ groups, and menu planning.

S. Quad SLC candidates discuss positions 
Two South Quad students yesterday announced their candidacies for positions on the Student Life Council, increasing the total number of candidates campaigning for that district's two positions on the council to four. 
Juniors Don Mooney (off­campus) and Tom Hefferman <Dillon) joined two previously announced candidates: Gary Caruso (Lyons); and the ticket of Buz Imhoff (Badin) and Rich Urda (Morrissey). 
Mooney, entered as a South Quad candidate, served for two years both in the Student Senate and the Alumni Hall Council. He has just completed a year of public relations work for the Student Government cabinet and started work as a Student Union Social Commissioner. 
"Despite the ineffectiveness of the SLC in the last years," he said, "I think there is still an opportunity to increase the quality of student life through that body. In this key year the SLC, as a body with student membership should assume leadership in developing coeducation. This means 


CLASSIFIED 
aggressive student initiative, rather than the 'don't make waves' position already taken by the present student govern­ment." 
Mooney, who considers the potential of the SLC to be great although it has been "bogged down by a lot of bull," outlined several points of his platform. 
---The SLC should im­mediately get to work on a residence exchange program. "The final form of the residence exchange should be decided by the SLC and not Father Burt­chaell," he said. 
--Female members of the academic coordinator. He was 
the campaign manager for Steve 
Pallucca, sophomore class president, and is now Pallucca's executive coordinator. Caruso wrote and worked for the passage of the Sophomore Car bill. 
"In writing the Sophomore Car bill and in finally getting it passed," he said, "I've been exposed to the way in which the SLC works." He added, "I've been to just about every meeting since October." 
Of the short range points in his platform Caruso said, "First of all, I'd like a study of student government to improve its ef­ficiency, reduce unnecessary duplication, and to eliminate unresponsiveness to student needs. 
"Secondly, I'd like to have a student government restructured with the Senate and Hall Presidents Council being joined to form a two chamber legislative body. Class government could also be revamped by making it a cabinet position under the student body president." 
He feels that students should have more say in laundry and food services and that more ef­fort should be made in presenting quickly organized activities such as T.G.I.F. 
In citing long range points in his platform, Caruso proposed that the University consider franchising a private corporation to build a high rise apartment building on campus. The com­pany would receive the revenue, buththe building would be run as any other dormitory. The University of Illinois did this, eliminating its bed squeeze and incurriging very little cost, Caruso added. 
"A student mall has already been proposed," he said, "but I would like to do some work on it. I feel that such a complex could change the social atmosphere here. Right now, dating is the only way you can be with a girl on a Saturday night. A student mall could give us a place to meet more informally." 
Caruso also proposed that the feasibility of a multi-level 

parking garage be studied. "This 
would increase the security, 
protect the cars from the 
weather, and put a bit more order 
into the parking procedures," he 
said. 

Caruso expressed hope that the 
SLC will look to the future and 
avoid lags on important issues 
such as coeducation. 

Buz Imhoff, Badin Hall 
president and former chairman 
of the HPC is a joint candidate 
with Rich Urda, former student 
government judicial coordinator. 
They claim that the lack of 
communication on the part of this 
year's representatives is one 
reason why they are seeking 
election . 

Imhoff said, "We feel that we possess the necessary interest and experience to adequately represent the students from the district. The SLC has the potential to become a very im­portant body, but thus far it has floundered inceaseless and pointless debate over issues that could be more effectively dealt with if the members showed the needed interest." 
Urda stressed a need for student leadership in the SLC. "Fr. Hesburgh has indicated his willingness to increase student membership as soon as students start to show an interest in what is going on. As soon as students prove to be a viable force on the council, then they will get more seats." 
Urda and Imhoff will campaign door-to-door trying to meet and discuss the election with as many people as possible. "Personal contact," said Imhoff, "is what is needed between the SLC representatives and the students.'' 
Urda added that in an effort to hear the needs of the students, all bills would be well researched before they reached the council. 
Both candidates expressed hope that the students would place a new emphasis on the council. Imhoff said, "It's about time that we get something moving on a body that is reputed to be the highest legislative body on campus."

Clarke said that Miss Tracey's 
candidacy for an SLC seat has the 
same implications that a 
Berkley student's candidacy for 
the same seat would have. 
Finally, on the grounds of the 
SLC's statement, Rodriguez feels 
that Miss Tracey's candidacy 
may be "a wasted effort". Even 
if she were elected by write-in 
votes ;>he stands the risk of not 
having her position approved by 
the university's board of trustees. 
Both Clarke and Rodriguez 
said they will be available for 
questioning regarding the 
election and can be reached b) 
calling 6244 or 1745.

released by the SLC election

Continued from page 1 
He explained the role of the average citizen in his plan by stating, "If the Congress doesn't have the guts to end the war; we will by not paying taxes." 
John Carey, who led the week of protest carried on by the Viet Nam Veterans for Peace, was also well received. He noted that his anti-war organization has more than 1200 members who are presently in active duty in In­dochina.

Referring to the 108 veterans arrested Thursday by the Capitol police for refusing to obey a court order to disperse from the Capitol steps, Carey stated that "This government worries more about the legality of where men sleep than it does about where it drops bombs." 

The best recognized woman speaker was Corretta Scott King. In her speech, she called the Universities of America "prisons, which monitor life, as in a police state." She drew a contrast between the subsidies alloted for the Lockheed aircraft and the grave fact that many of our countrymen are presently starving.
