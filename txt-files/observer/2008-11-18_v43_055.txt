The MBA program in Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business advanced six spots in BusinessWeek magazine's bien­nial survey of MBA programs nationwide, from a No. 26 ranking in 2006 to No. 20 in 2008. 
The survey ranks the top 30 MBA programs and the top 10 rion-U.S. MBA programs. The University of Chicago's Booth School of Business earned the No. 1 spot, followed by Harvard Business School, Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. 
Two year MBA candidate Mirjam Wit said she was pleased to see Notre Dame move up in the rankings. 
"It definitely feels good to pay money and have my degree get more value as I continue my education here," she said. 
BusinessWeek Magazine uses surveys of students and corpo­rate recruiters as well as an intellectual capital rating to determine its rankings. The 45-question student survey is

ND Votes pushes for sustained discussion 
Campaign wraps up activities and hopes that 'interest will extend beyond the election' 
ByJOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
Although ND Votes '08 will cease to exist following Election 2008, the organizers of the Center for Social Concerns-based initiative hope that political dis­cussion will continue on campus. 
"ND Votes may not have any official events, but our main goal was to facilitate political inter­est," ND Votes student co-chair Mallory Laurel said. "We hope that that interest will extend beyond the election." 
The short-term goal of ND Votes was to increase student participation in the 2008 elec­tion, and the organizers hope that the initiative has "stirred up the kind of political and civic participation that can be contin­ued seven days a week, 365 days a year," Laurel said. 
ND Votes was organized out of the Justice Education division of the Center for Social Concerns. Laurel said this justice division, which "is in some ways an exten­sion of the interests ofND Votes," will continue to be active in pro­moting political discussion on campus. 
"The student justice part of the esc will have some sort of events that remind students that although we have enacted our right to vote, we must hold can-

Teaching progran1 recruits students 
By LAURA McCRYSTAL 
News Writer 
Teach for America recruit­ment director Patrick Herre! told Notre Dame students Monday night that they can become involved both before and after graduation to solve "America's greatest injustice." 
Teach for America recruits college undergraduates across the nation to spend two years on its teaching corps in public schools in 29 regions across the United States. Notre Dame, with 75 graduates currently teaching in the program, is one of the top 10 universities with the highest participation in the program, Herre! said. 
Herre!, who taught in Charlotte, N.C. with Teach for America before he became a recruiter, spoke to a group of over 30 students at the infor­mation session targeted at sophomores and juniors. He said he was excited because it was the first time that the organization had hosted an event at Notre Dame specifical­ly for underclassmen. 
He said Teach for America is important because it allows recent college graduates not only to teach for two years, but also to commit themselves to

Recital features world dance, song 
Saint Mary's students perform international pieces at annual event 
By MEGAN LONEY News Writer 
For the fourth year in a row, the Little Theatre was filled with the sounds of music from all over the world, as students performed a variety of international songs and dances as part of the Modern Language Recital. 
"This showcase began as an end-of-semester assign­ment for my students to present to their class," said Saint Mary's professor Marianne Hahn, the founder of the recital. "One year, I had three sopranos in my class, and I thought that they should perform for an audi­ence and not just for the other students in the class." 
Hahn had her students per­form as part of the recital that year and has continued it ever since. 

But she did not have any students connected with the music department this year, so she contacted the depart­ment to see if any of the stu­dents would be willing to perform as part of the Modern Language recital this year. 
Senior McKayela Collins, a music major with a focus on vocal performance, was interested and organized the entire music portion of the recital and sang a German piece by composer Clara Schumann. Collins is familiar with singing in other lan­guages, as her major requires her to be proficient in singing in Italian, French and German. She sometimes does pieces in Spanish or Russian. 
"I chose this song because I wanted it to benefit students taking [German], "Collins said. "I thought it would be good for them to hear it and challenge themselves to understand the lyrics." 
This piece is one of the songs Collins will perform in her February recital of all­female composers. 
The first part of the recital, organized by Collins, consist­ed of music sung and played by Saint Mary's students. These students were recom­mended to Collins from vari­ous professors in the music department. 
Nine students enrolled in Chinese 101 sang "You and Me," the theme from the 2008 Bejing Olympic games.

RHA recognizes 
residence leaders 
By LIZ HARTER Saint Mary's Editor 
The Saint Mary's National Residence Hall Honorary (NRHH) has been accepting nominations for induction into the organiza­tion for the second year since the beginning of November. 
The NRHH, which is part of the College's Residence Hall Association (RHA) is an organiza­tion that acknowledges the peo­ple that make residence halls a great place to live, senior and NRHH president Shannon Egan said. 
RHA first discovered the NRHH at the Great Lakes Association of Colleges and University Residence Halls (GLACURH) last year, RHA president Maura Clougherty said. Since RHA is part of a national organization they attend yearly conferences like the GLACURH to learn ideas and develop programs they can bring back to the College. RHA decided that the NRHH is a good program because of the unique­ness of the residence halls. 
"By bringing an NRHH chapter to our campus, we are able to formally acknowledge those peo­ple that make our residence halls a wonderful environment, and home, to our students," she said. "We extended our reach as RHA, so that on-campus students can directly recognize the people they see making an impact in their day-to-day lives."

INSIDE COLUMN 

Clothed in 

class 
In the past three and a half years, I 
have not taken any classes that included 
nudity as a requirement. 
This morning, I registered for classes 
for the last time in my college career and 
I'm fairly certain that I'll be keeping my 
clothes on next 
semester. I haven't 
Kaltlynn Rlely 
seen the syllabi, but 
I'm pretty sure that 
nudity is not a Associate News 
requirement in Editor 
classes like 
"Advanced Fiction 
Writing" or "American Political Parties." 
My sister, Kelly, has not been so lucky. 
She's a sophomore at a college in 
Pennsylvania, studying nursing. 
She walked into one of her nursing classes in August and her professor told her to pick a partner she'd be comfort­able with and make sure she wears clothes to class that are easy to take off and put on. 
So while I was reading Moby Dick and writing a paper about the Democratic and Hepublican conventions, Kelly was giving, and receiving, a breast exam from her classmate, as the professor walked around the elassroom to make sure everyone was performing them correctly. 
Next semester, when I'm reading about political parties and tho writings of 20th century American women writers, she'll be giving her classmate a sponge bath, and then getting a sponge bath from this same elassmate. (The professor says they can wear bathing suits for this one, but still. The elosest I've ever come to per­forming sponge baths in class is .... no, I've never come close.) 
In my three and a half years at college, I've had some fairly tough assignments. I've written long papers, taken difficult tests and given some class presentations. 
But the whole time, I was wearing clothes. School has seemed a lot easier and less stressful this semester since I realized I could be in the buff in DeBartolo. 
I'm usually chilly enough in those class­rooms as it is. 
The nearest I've come to combining nudity and schoolwork at Notre Dame have been the unfortunate occasions when I was studying for final exams in the library and the bun runners of Alumni Hall ran by. 
But I'm using Kelly's classroom experi­ences of undress as a motivating agent for the rest of my semester. And as we move into the end of the term and the beginning of the biannual college tradi­tion of competing in complaining about who has it worse, consider thinking about my sister and her naked class­mates. 
You have two 20-page papers due on the same day? Did you have to write them in a hospital dressing gown? 
You have three tests in one week? Do any of the tests involve feeling under your classmate's clothes? 
I'm pretty sure they don't. 
So when you head off to class the next few weeks, tackling your end of the semester work, bundle up. Wear multiple layers. Dress yourselves in a complicated array of clothes that can't be taken off or put on easily. 
And enjoy not seeing your classmates in their birthday suits.

ND development director wins Emmy award 
George Keegan honoredfor work as co-creator ofanimated television series, "The Adventures ofthe Young Thomas Edison" 
Special to The Observer 
George Keegan, the University of Notre Dame's director of foundation relations, has an interesting connection to the famous inventor and business-
m a n 
Thomas Edison, and that con­nection, as well as a simi I a r entrepre­neurial 


s P i r i t , Keeganrecently earned Keegan, of all things, an Emmy Award, the highest honor of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Keegan is co-creator of the animated television series "The Adventures of the Young Thomas Edison," which won the 2008 Mid-Atlantic Emmy Award for Children!Youthffeen Program or Special after airing on New Jersey Network Public Television. The show teaches creativity and innovation through the scientific method. "I kept hearing about how science and math standards had been dropping," Keegan said. "And then I read a report that said if you don't 
capture students' interest in math and science by fifth grade, you've lost them for life. I wanted to make an impact by inspiring kids to ask questions and think differently. The series is something that parents have been looking for because it's completely different." 
Keegan, accepted his "dream job" at Notre Dame in February, leaving behind a career that many people might consider the same thing. He served as the executive director of the Edison Innovation Foundation in Newark, N.J., which is committed to educat­ing the next generation of great innovators through Edison and his Invention Factory. Keegan worked alongside his father John, chairman and president of the Charles Edison Fund, from which the foundation was created, and remains a trustee of both the foundation and the fund. 
The connection to the Edisons began with Keegan's father. A 1961 Notre Dame graduate, John Keegan was one of the attorneys who oversaw the estate of Edison's son Charles, who assisted his father in run­ning the business, as well as serving as secretary of the Navy and governor of New Jersey. He didn't have any

Now, eight months after a "great opportunity presented itself' at Notre Dame, Keegan remains protective of "Young Thomas Edison." He still reviews all creative content for the show, which is committed to air next fall on participating PBS stations. The pilots already have airing committ­ments in New York, Mississippi and Florida, as well as New Jersey, and there are DVDs of each show, story books and ani­mated music videos. 
"It's surreal," Keegan said. "Everyone is kind of shocked that a pipe dream of one of their employees could be Emmy-worthy. It's a nice recognition, but, to me, what really needs to be done is to reintroduce Edison to the next generation of kids to allow them to think the way he thought." 
Although he has "discussed the series with a lot of folks in Hollywood," Keegan doesn't want to sell out to someone who won't look after the initial purpose of the show, and he intends to stay at Notre Dame. 
"The Emmy is simply a vali­dation of a concept that· I thought would work," he said. ''I'm not planning to be the next Walt Disney. My skill set is more conducive to helping raise monies for Notre Dame."

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -In a dra­matic escalation of high seas crime, Somali pirates hijacked a Saudi supertanker loaded with crude hundreds of miles off the coast of East Africa -defeating the security web of warships trying to protect vital shipping lanes. 
The takeover demonstrates the bandits' heightened ambitions and capabilities: Never before have they seized such a giant ship so far out to sea. Maritime experts warned the broad daylight attack, reported by the U.S. Navy on Monday, was an alarming sign of the dilliculty of patrolling a vast stretch of ocean key to oil and other cargo traffic. 
The MV Sirius Star, a brand new tanker with a 25-member crew, was seized at about 10 a.m. Saturday more than 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, the Navy said. The area lies far south of the zone where warships have increased their patrols this year in the Gulf of Aden, one of the busiest channels in the world. leading to and from the Suez Canal, and the scene of most past attacks.

The conference, which begins Tuesday in Beverly Hills with some 700 partici­pants expected, is an attempt by the Hepublican governor to influence a U.N. gathering in Poland next month. Schwarzenegger has said he wants the summit to inform negotiations over a new global climate treaty, which the U.N. hopes to finish by December 2009.

Indiana keeps 'God' license plates 
INDIANAPOLIS -The Indiana Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the state's "In God We Trust" license plate Monday, reject­ing a claim that people who buy the plates should have to pay a $15 administrative fee charged for other specialty plates. 
In its 12-page ruling, the appeals court found that state lawmakers acted correctly in creating a license plate classification system that exempts people who purchase the "In God We Trust" plate from paying the administrative fee. 
Residents return to ruined homes 
Nearly 500 homes destroyed, 120 saved in affluent mobile home park 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -Stacks of charred bricks, blackened shells of cars and burned tree trunks were all that remained Monday in much of the community some resi­dents once called the "Beverly Hills of mobile home parks." 
The mostly retired resi­dents returned to see what was left of their homes at Oakridge Mobile Home Park, where winds with hurricane intensity blew a wall of fire through nearly 500 manufactured homes and set them ablaze so quickly that even firefighters had to drop their hoses and run. 
"It looks like a war zone -no trees, no buildings," said Michele Warneck, 54, who burst into tears after returning from the park. She had watched her two­bedroom house burn on the television news. "Everything that was porcelain just blew up." 
Once considered a para­dise with swimming pools and tennis courts, the park was now roamed by cadav­er-sniffing dogs in search of anyone who didn't escape.

Liebertnan likely to hold chair 
Senator under pressure by Democrats after supporting McCain 
Associated Press 

WASIIINGTON -Sen. Joe Lieberman appears increasing­ly likely to hold onto his prized chairmanship of the Senate Homeland Security Committee as he meets Tuesday with Democratic colleagues unhap­py over his vocal support for GOP nominee John McCain during this year's presidential campaign. 
Not long ago, Lieberman's hold on his chairmanship seemed to be slipping as Democrats sought to punish him f'or boosting McCain and criticizing President-elect Barack Obama during the long campaign. 
Now, according to several Democratic aides who demand­ed anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, it appears that Lieberman will receive a lesser sanction, such as losing a subcommittee chair­manship on the Environment and Public Works Committee. 
Anger toward Lieberman seems to have softened since Election Day and there's strengthening sentiment that taking away his chairmanship might drive him from the Democratic caucus and send the wrong signals as Obama takes oflice on a pledge to unite the eountry. Lieberman has sig­naled it would be unacceptable for him to lose his chairman­ship.  
Lieberman, who was Democratic presidential nomi­nee AI Gore's running mate in 2000, was re-elected in 2006 as an independent after losing his state's Demoeratic primary. He remains a registered Democrat and aligns with the party inside the Senate. 
Lieberman faces a vote of his Democratic colleagues on a secret ballot Tuesday al"ter making his case at a elosnd­door caucus. While he appnars likely to emerge without harsh sanetion, his presentation and the reaetion of colleagues could all'eet the outcome. 


Obama has reportedly told Senate Majority Leader Harry Heid of Nevada it would hurt the message of unity that he wants for his new administra-· tion if Lieberman leaves the Democratic caucus. Heid met with Lieberman last week and was initially inclined to strip him of the Homeland Security Committee chairmanship, according to a Senate Democratic aide. 
"I was coneerned and was upset about what happened earlier this year," Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said on "Fox News Sunday." "But you know what? We turn the page." 
On the other side are sena­tors who feel that one of' the requiremnnts to be installed in a leadership position is party loyalty. 

"To reward Senator Lieb1~rman with a major com­mittee chairmanship would bn a slap in thn faee of millions of Americans who worked tire­lessly for Baraek Obama and who want to see real change in our country," Sen. Bernie Sanders, 1-Vt., said in a state­ment on Friday. "Appointing someone to a major post who led the opposition to everything we are fighting for is not 'change we can believe in."' 
Heid has been working to find a compromise with Democratic supporters of Lieberman, including Sen. Chris Dodd of' Connecticut, chairman of tho Senate Banking Committee. Dodd and Sen. Evan Bayh, D-lnd., have said it would be a mistake if any punishment by the party causes Lieberman to bolt to the Hepubliean side.

IN BRIEF 
Mark Cuban charged with inside trading 
WASHINGTON -Federal regulators on Monday charged Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban with insider trading for allegedly using confidential information on a stock sale to avoid more than $750,000 in losses. 
Cuban disputed the Securities and Exchange Commission's allegations and said he would con­test them. 
In a civil lawsuit filed in federal court in Dallas, the SEC alleged that in June 2004, Cuban was invited to get in on the coming stock offering by Mamma.com Inc. after he agreed to keep the information private. 
Cuban owned 6.3 percent of Mamma.com's stock at that time and was the largest known shareholder in the search engine company, according to the SEC. The agency said Cuban knew the shares would be sold below the current market price, and a few hours after receiving the information, he told his broker to sell all 600,000 shares before the public announcement of the offering. 
Indusbial output rebounds in October 
WASHINGTON -Industrial output posted a bigger-than-expected rebound in October after plunging in September by the largest amount in over 60 years. 
The Federal Reserve said Monday that indus­trial output rose 1.3 percent last month, reflect­ing a return to more normal operations follow­ing hurricanes and a strike at aircraft manufac­turer Boeing Co. the previous month. 
Those disruptions along with the weak econo­my caused industrial production to fall by 3.7 percent in September, the biggest one-month drop since a 5 percent plunge in February 1946. 
The 1.3 percent increase in October was big­ger than the 0.2 percent rise that economists expected, but the September decline was worse than the 2.8 percent drop originally reported. The government attributed the steeper fall to revised data showing that Hurricanes Gustav and Ike had a bigger impact on the chemical industry than initially thought.of the way

Citigroup makes severe job cuts 
53,000 jobs cut as Citigroup prepares for leaner future, gets back to basics 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Citigroup, widely seen as the sickest Wall Street bank, will make some of the most severe cuts in the history of U.S. busi­ness -53,000 jobs -as it tries to slash costs and get back to basics before it's too late. 
The cuts, which will leave Citi about 20 percent small­er, are the latest step in a stunning remaking of the American banking land­scape since the financial meltdown, an upheaval that has included the demise of storied investment houses and the conversion of others into commercial banks. 
Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit met with employees Monday and laid out the bank's strategy in stark terms: "We are a bank. What does a bank do? A bank takes deposits and puts them to work by invest­ing and making loans." 
Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., which has tracked downsizing since 1993, said Citi's cuts are the second-most on record. IBM announced in July it was cutting 60,000. 
At its peak in 2007, Citi had 375,000 employees.

When former President Jimmy Carter and Bob Barr, the 2008 Libertarian candidate for President, agree on any­thing, we should take notice. Both recently urged the Georgia Board of Pardons and Parole to reverse its decision to deny clemency to Troy Anthony Davis, sentenced to death for the 1989 murder of police orticer Mark MacPhail. 
Davis was charged with two counts of aggra­vated assault, one for shooting Michael Cooper at a party, and the other for striking, two hours later, a homeless man. Larry Young, on the head with a pistol. Davis was charged with murder for shooting Officer MacPhail, moonlighting as a security guard at a bus station. As charged, MacPhail chased Davis after the assault on Young. Davis fired at MacPhail who was shot in the face and fnll. Davis, it was charged, walked over to MacPhail and shot him twice again. The pistol was never found, but shell casings at the scenes showed that the same pistol was used to shoot Cooper and MacPhail. The jury convicted Davis on all counts. 
Davis has sought a new trial on the grounds that he is innocent, that seven of the nine witnesses who testitied against him have recanted their testi­mony and that evidence implicates another person as the killer. The Georgia Supreme Court, in a 4-3 ruling in April, 2008, denied Davis a new trial. The Supreme Court of the United States denied review. Further proceed­ings are pending. 
Courts properly give less weight to a recantation, whether sworn or unsworn, than to the witness' testimo­ny before the judge and jury at the trial. The Georgia Supreme Court majority last April found the recanta­tions insufficient to overturn the jury's verdict because they lacked materiality as to innocence or failed to show the witness' testimony at trial to have been the "purest fabrication." The three dis­senters said the majority's approach "is overly rigid and fails to allow an adequate inquiry" into the question of whether an innocent person might 


have been convicted and might be put 
to death. 

An innocent person should not be imprisoned for a day, let alone execut­ed. The finality of execution adds urgency to any claim that a person sentenced to death is innocent. On the entire facts, Davis' entitlement to a new trial is far from a sure thing. It is doubtful at best. But whatever the out­come of his claim, it should prompt us to ask: Does it make sense to impose the death penalty even for an aggra­vated murder such as this? Thirty-six states, plus the United States govern­ment, have the death penalty, with 1,129 executions since 1976. As of Jan. 1, 2008, 3,350 persons were on death row in the United States. The passage of two decades and more between the crime and the execution is not unusu­al. Numerous studies show that the imposition of the death penalty costs taxpayers far more than it would to imprison the defendant for life without parole. 
Since 1973, at least 130 persons have been released from death row with evidence of their innocence of the crime for which the death sentence was imposed. The death penalty, how­ever, should be reconsidered for rea­sons more basic than the possibility of executing the innocent. The clearest exposition of those reasons is in the recent teaching of the Catholic Church. 
No one, including the state, ever has authority intentionally to kill the inno­cent. The state, because it ultimately derives its authority from God, has authority to kill intentionally in two cases, the just war and the death penalty. 
The "primary aim" of punishing a criminal is retribution, "redressing the disorder introduced by the offense." Catechism, no. 2266. The other pur­poses of punishment are rehabilitation of the offender and deterrence of the offender and of others. 
In Evangelium Vitae (EV) and the Catechism (CCC), John Paul II reaf­firmed the authority of the state to impose the death penalty. But he gave us a new criterion for the use of that penalty. Neither retribution, nor any other purpose, will justify the use of the death penalty unless it "is the only possible way of ... defending human lives against the unjust aggressor." In other words, it has to be the only way to keep this criminal from killing again. The faet that the death penalty may deter others from killing is not enough. Nor does the horrific nature of the crime justify execution. 
This restriction arises from the importance of the conversion of the criminal. St. Augustine and St. Thomas agree "for a just man to be made from a sinner is greater than to create heav­en and earth." S.T. 1,11, Q. 113, art. 9. 
"INJon-lethal means," said John Paul, "are more in keeping with ... the com­mon good and ... the dignity of the human person. Today, ... as a conse­quence of the possibilities which the state has for ... rendering one who has committed an otl'ense incapable of doing harm _without definitively tak­ing away from him the possibility of redeeming himself-the cases in which ... execution.. .is an absolute necessity 'are very rare, if not practi­cally non-existent."' Catechism, no. 2267, quoting EV, no. 56. 
Whether execution is an "absolute necessity" depends on a prudential judgment as to tiH~ ability of the prison system to confine this prisoner secure­ly. But the Church's limitation on the use of the death penalty is a universal, and not a prudential criterion. It applies everywhere and in all states. Use of the death penalty could be per­mitted under this criterion in some eases, for example, if a life inmate, already in maximum security, murders another inmate or a guard; or if.the state is unable to coniine inmates securely. 
In our culture the intentional inflic­tion of death has become an optional problem solving technique. The ulti­mate perversity is seen in those who oppose the death penalty for criminals and support it for the innocent unborn child.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Going green? 

I'm writing this letter as I sit next to my heater with the window wide open. You may be asking yourself why I'm doing this, but it's actually quite simple: it's because most of the heaters in Dillon (and I'm assuming in most of the other older dorms) don't operate correctly. In my room, we have no control over the heater. Depending on whether the main valve is turned on, the heater is either turned to full blast or is not turned on at all. And because we have no control, we are forced to open the window to counteract all of the heat. Just yesterday, I was given three new fluo­rescent light bulbs to conserve energy -which I think is a great idea. However, shouldn't we be tackling the bigger issues such as the heaters? I don't know how much it would cost, but if the Notre Dame community wishes to conserve our energy, then we should be less focused on fluores­cent bulbs and more focused on all the energy that is being wasted DAILY.

English is the issue 
While issues with the movie, "Tropic Thunder", and the repeated use of a cer­tain r-word, which literally means slow, have dominated the Viewpoint pages these past few days, the issue itself is not the movie. Popular culture has made dif­ferences bad, with everything from the negative connotations of the word "retard­ed" to the use of"gay" as an insult. The message to me of this Viewpoint skirmish is not the problem with the movie, "Tropic Thunder" itself, but a problem with ourselves. I wage a battle with myself relatively regularly, as gay and lesbian jokes come up among my friends, or the antiquated idea of a problem with learning dis­abilities surface in jokes and media. (Yes, by the way, based on traditional defini­tions, people with common learning disabilities such as forms of dyslexia qualify as "retards," myself included). The challenge I come away with is one to become more accepting in my language and reactions, checking for offensive language and expressions. I challenge my fellow students to do the same.

Acceptance should apply to all 
Yesterday, I was shocked and saddened by Liz Froehlke's gross mis­judgement ("Lack of acceptance an issue of ignorance," Nov 17) of what is considered an acceptable subject to "poke fun at." I have not seen a more patronizing or mean-spirited article in the time since I arrived here at Notre Dame. The first paragraph (half of the whole article) seems exclu­sively devoted to doing what you claim to most deplore, and attacking someone else for no good reason. If, as seems readily apparent, she can­not air her views without resorting to numerous ad hominem attacks on the person, morals, age and intelligence of Colin Keeler, then I implore her to not air them at all. I don't want to hear her personally attack a person who is new to this school and, in her own words "just a fresh­man." I am also "just a freshman" but I can certainly understand and be extremely indignant when she patronizes one of my classmates. This is doubly true when it is someone I both know and respect for his intelli­gence. If she thinks this little of him, I dare not ask what she thinks of me. 
Obviously, Ms. Froehlke disagrees very strongly with Colin. It just so happens that I come down in the middle of this issue, by and large. There is a place for satire, especially when the target is Hollywood, but I still object to the method Stiller chose to use. The fact is, Hollywood exploits all manner of disabilities in its quest for profit and acclaim. However, the end does not justify the means. Stiller resorted to tactics even more bla­tant and deplorable than the Hollywood norm, in an effort to discredit the Hollywood norm. Though Hollywood deserved to be discredited, I believe Stiller could certainly have made an attempt to find a more reasonable method. Satire, on some issues, is just too harsh. 
The same argument applies just as easily to Ms. Froehlke's letter, how­ever. Her argument is something that I largely agree with, after the first paragraph is through. However, in that first paragraph, she chooses to insult Colin Keeler simply because he disagrees with her, and to insult all freshmen, simply because Colin Keeler is one. I found it very difficult to sit down and read the remainder of her letter, or acknowledge that it has merit, because of the sheer hypocrisy with which it began. She is a senior in college, and clearly believes herself more intelligent and mature than Colin, and presumably than myself. She should prove it.

Weis accountable 
Although we have long been skeptical of Charlie Weis' ability to be a successful college head coach, my roommate and I have tried to remain quiet as others attempted to identify specifically what the problem has been. This latest debacle of a football game against Navy has proven to finally break our silence. So why is our football team performing so poorly? The bottom line is that our head coach makes horrible decisions at horrible times. Let's recap some of these decisions, specifical­ly those Coach Weis made during this weekend's stroke-inducing victory over Navy. 
In no particular order, there was the QB-read sneak on 3rd & 4 (note that even if successful, this play usually goes for 2-3 yards, still short of the first down); run­ning the Wildcat offense for the first time this year on a 3rd & 5 with Golden Tate taking the snap (who, as much as we love his playmaking ability, has never been a passing threat); putting in our second string players with 9 minutes left and only a 20 point lead (a 5-4 team should never be that confident); and finally going for it on 4th & 3 from Navy's 48-yard line (with said second string players still in the game) giving Navy a shorter field to drive down and score than if we had punted. It was also painfully obvious during all three of Navy's onside kick attempts that our team has not practiced the proper way to defend against such a kick. Our players stood still, waiting to get run over instead of charging the ball and jumping to meet it at its highest point. 
How about some other notable decisions from the past four years: a pass on 4th and 1 (from midfield) in a tie game against Pittsburgh with 50 seconds left; the fake punt against LSU in the Sugar Bowl on 4th and 13 from our own 30 yard line on the first drive of the game; not attempting a 43-yard field goal against Navy last year; and last, but not least, he once even started Demetrius Jones. Furthermore, there is the noticeable lack of discipline our team displays each week -arguably the only thing a head coach truly has control of. We watch dumbfounded each Saturday, as our team commits mental mistakes ("False start, number 74 offense," anyone?) and personal fouls (Toryan Smith's endzone dive, or perhaps Harrison Smith's late-hit against Pitt after a 3rd down stand, a huge momentum swing). What's worse is that these infractions go unpunished. The players get their 10-sec­ond lecture then they're on their merry way and back playing in the next series. Charlie Weis has simply lacked the ability to coach, which in the barest sense of the word is the ability to teach others about the game of football. 
Yes, his recruiting classes have been spectacular. Unfortunately, that doesn't mat­ter if you can't develop that talent into something useful. We thought he had this ability when Brady Quinn's 50 percent completion percentage his sophomore year turned into a 65 percent rate his first year under Weis. However that just means maybe he would be an amazing quarterbacks coach. As far as head coaching goes, he just doesn't have what Notre Dame is looking for. Three years later Charlie's sig­nature game is still a 31-28 loss to USC.

The Catholic vote 
In his perceptive commentary on the Catholic vote, Professor Rice asks why so many Catholics voted for Obama. The answer, I suggest, is that they simply do not accept the Church's teaching respecting the personhood of the fetus. Oh, they may say that they do and go on about "balancing" other "life" issues and the like. Some may even believe they do. But, demonstrably, they do not. Consider this analogy: The Supreme Court rules that a mother has a Constitutional right, under the priva­cy rubric, to direct the humane killing of her child within 24 hours of birth if a doc­tor determines that the infant suffers from a major disability. A Presidential candi­date declares support for this ruling, opposition to any efforts to limit or undo it and endorsement of federal funding to underwrite these infanticides. Obama is that candidate unless that infant's claim to life is stronger than a fetus's. 
Obama and most, if not almost all, of his supporters assert that it is. But a Catholic voter cannot make that distinction and at the same time proclaim adher­ence to the Church's teaching respecting the sanctity of life in the womb. The elab­orate calibrations of prominent pro-abortion Catholics who purported to follow the bishops' guidelines were, accordingly, transparently infirm. A Catholic who gen­uinely accepts the Church's central teaching as to the moral personhood of the fetus cannot in conscience vote for an Obama any more than he or she could sup­port the infanticide candidate of the hypothetical. It matters not whether the candi­date's program might somehow result in a reduction of abortions or infanticides in the future. The deliberate taking of innocent lives today cannot be "balanced" by the saving of other lives tomorrow, whatever the numbers. Not, at least, in any Catholic moral equation. This, of course, does not mean that a Catholic should have voted for McCain. That is a different question.

NFL 
Reid takes blame for overtime rule confusion 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -Tie? What tiB? 
Thanks to Donovan McNabb, playBrs around the league now must know there doesn't have to be a winner or loser in every regular-season game. Yes, there arc ties in the NFL. They just don't happen too often. 
A day after the Philadelphia Eagles and Cincinnati Bengals played a 13-13 tie-the league's first since 2002 -the focus wasn't on how poorly the teams performed on the field. Instead, everyone wanted to know how it's possible some professional football players, espBcially a 1{)-year veteran such as McNabb, don't know simple rules about overtimes games. 
''I'm sure there are plenty of rules that. guys don't under­stand, but I don't think that has any factor whatsoever to do with the outcome of this game and how they played in the overtime," Eagles coach Andy Reid said Monday. "I think that's absurd. You play to win in that time, whether you think you have another over­time period or you don't. And you play your heart out to win it in that time, and that's how we approached it and that's 
how the players approached 
it." 
Reid ignored the point. Whether the players' igno­rance about the overtime rule affected the outcome is debat­able. It's inconceivable and embarrassing that some of them didn't know a game can end in a tie. 
"''ll take the responsibility for that," Reid said. 
Reid deserves plenty of blame for the Eagles' struggles this season and their inability to beat the lowly Bengals (1-8­1), but coaches shouldn't have to walk up and down the side­line telling players that over­time is do-or-die. 
The Eagles (5-4-1) now have played 12 OT games, including one in the playoffs, since McNabb joined the team in 1999. Yet, the five-time Pro Bowl quarterback didn't know ties were possible until his des­peration pass fell incomplete at the end of the fifth quarter. 
''I've never been a part of a tie. I never even knew that was in the rule book," McNabb said after the game. "It's part of the rules, and we have to go with it. I was looking forward to getting the opportunity to get out there and try to drive to win the game. But unfortu­nately, with the rules, we set­tled with a tie." 

The overtime rule isn't an obscure one. It was adopted fully by the NFL in 1974 and 17 games have since ended tied. The Eagles have been involved in four of those games. 
"I guess we're aware of it now," McNabb said. "In col­lege, there are multiple over­times, and in high school and Pop Warner. I never knew in the professional ranks it would end that way. I hate to see what would happen in the Super Bowl and in the play­offs." 
Uh, they keep playing if it's tied in the playoff's or Super Bowl. But McNabb apparently didn't know that, either. 
In his defense, McNabb was­n't the only one oblivious to the rules. Several of his teammates were just as clueless. 
"Me and Greg Lewis were discussing it on the sideline, so we asked one of our trainers and he told us it ends in a tie," running back Correll Buckhalter said. 
"I found out while we were in OT," rookie wideout DeSean Jackson said. 
"I thought we kept playing," linebacker Omar Gaither said. 
McNabb was unavailable to reporters on Monday. A spokesman for the QB said McNabb told him he wished he knew the rule and wasn't going to make any excuses for not knowing it. 

McNabb's comments took some of the heat off a miser­able performance. He tied a career high with three inter­ceptions, lost a fumble and completed fewer than half his passes (28-for-58). 
Still, the Eagles remain in the NFC's playoff picture, though they hardly look like a team worthy of playing in January. Philadelphia is a half­game behind Washington, Dallas and Atlanta for the final wild-card spot with games against the Redskins and Cowboys the last two weeks.

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Albert Pujols views MVP voting a little differently these days. 
"You have to consider everything. You have to put all the numbers together," the St. Louis star said Monday after powering past Philadelphia slugger Ryan Howard to win the award for the second time. 
Pujols won despite the Cardinals finishing in fourth place, the lowest spot for an NL MVP win­ner since Andre Dawson and Chicago Cubs wound up sixth in 1987. Howard led the majors in home runs and RBis for the World Series champs. 

The result surely will renew a debate that Pujols once raised him­self: What qualifies as "most valuable"? 
In 2006, a month after leading the Cardinals to the World Series crown, Pujols carped when Howard -whose Phillies missed the playoffs ­captured the coveted award. 
"I see it this way: Someone who doesn't take his team to the playoffs doesn't deserve to win the MVP," Pujols said at that time. 
Shortly thereafter, Pujols clarified his 
remarks and said Howard certainly was worthy of the award. 
"I think the writers made the right choice in 2006," Pujols reiterated Monday. "He did deserve it." 
Just as Pujols believed he earned it this year. "I wasn't surprised at all," he said. 
Pujols hit .357 with 37 home runs and 116 RBis while playing with a sore right elbow that required surgery. Howard hit 48 homers with 146 RBis for the Phillies. 
Voting was completed before the playoffs began. 'Tm happy I didn't have to make that decision," 
Pujols said on a confer­ence call from his St. Louis home. "What you do for your team. The play­ers who take their teams to the playoffs should have some consideration." 
Los Angeles outfielder Manny Ramirez and Milwaukee pitcher CC Sabathia, who both led postseason pushes after being traded by AL teams in July, also drew strong support. 
Pujols got 18 of the 32 first-place votes in ballot­ing by the Baseball Writers' Association of America and had 369 points. Howard drew 12 first-place votes and 308 points. 
IN BRIEF NBA disciplines Garnett,
Shaq for separate incidents 
NEW YORK-Boston Celtics star Kevin Garnett has been suspended for one game and Phoenix center Shaquille O'Neal has been fined $25,000 for separate incidents over the weekend. 
The NBA announced on Monday that Garnett will be suspended for hitting Milwaukee Bucks center Andrew Bogut in the face on Saturday. 
Bogut didn't get off, however, with the league also upgrading the foul he committed that started the altercation to a Flagrant 1. 
The incident happened late in the fourth quarter of the Celtics' 102-97 overtime win in Milwaukee. 
Garnett will sit out Tuesday's game against the New York Knicks in Boston. 
O'Neal was fmed for verbally abus­ing an offical and failing to leave the court quickly after being ejected Sunday night against Detroit. 

Hall of Fame basketball 
coach Newell dies at 93 
BERKELY, Calif. -Pete Newell, the Hall of Fame basketball coach who won an NCAA championship and Olympic gold medal and later tutored some of the game's greatest big men, died Monday. He was 93. 
His death was confirmed by the University of California, the school Newell coached to a national title in 1959. Newell, who had been living near San Diego, had a serious lung operation in 2005. 
Newell coached for 14 years at San Francisco, Michigan State and California before doctors advised him to give it up because of the emotional toll. His final coaching job came in the 1960 Olympics, when he took a U.S. team led by Oscar Robertson, Jerry West and Jerry Lucas to a gold medal in Rome. 
Newell later returned to promi­nence with his famous "big men" camps. 
AL champion Rays will 
raise tickel prices next year 
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -It will cost more to see the Tampa Bay Rays next year. 
Coming oil" their first winning season, the AL champion Rays announced Monday that single-game tickets will rise anywhere from $1 to $5, depending on location at Tropicana Field, where prices range from $10 to $210 for most home dates in 2009. 
Prices range from $16 to $270 for 21 dates designated as "prime" games, including the home opener against the New York Yankees and three games in June against the Philadelphia Phillies, who defeated Tampa Bay in the World Series. 
The Rays, who had never won more than 70 games in a season before win­ning 97 and making the playofiS for the first time this year, also are introducing what the team is calling "marquee" games -11 Saturday dates that will include a postgame concert or "premi­um" giveaway promotion.

Rangers edge Senators in shootout for home win 
Bruins hand Leafs home loss; Red Wings dominate Oilers with shutout; Islanders sneak by Canucks in shootout 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK Nikolai 
Zherdev scored the only goal 
in a shootout and IIenrik 
I.undqvist denied all three 
Ottawa shooters, giving the 
New York Rangers a 2-1 victo­
ry Monday night over the 
Senators. 
The Hangers opted to shoot 
first and Zherdev beat Alex 
Auld between the pads. That 
left it up to Lundqvist to stop 
.Jason Spezza, Jarko Huutu 
and Antoine Vermette for his 
NIIL-leading 12th win. 
Fredrik Sjostrom scored for 
the Hangers in regulation as 
the Eastern Conferenee lead­
ers stretched their winning 
streak to three. 
Daniel Alfredsson had thA 
lonP. goal for the Senators, 
who lost their fifth straight. 
They've scored only live goals 
during that span. 
The Senators had a 9-8 shot 
advantage in an evenly 
played. scoreless first period. 
Thanks to a pair of power plays, thn Senators dominated tlw l'irst half of thn sneond p n riod , but eou I d not bn~ a k through against l.undqvist. i\.lfrPdsson had tho best chance on the first power play, unloading a hard shot from the left dot. Dany IIeatley had a solid ehanee at the side of the net on the sec­ond. 
Ottawa had eight of the first nine shots in the period. The persistence paid ofT with 3:47 remaining when Alfredsson got his first goal in 11 games. The Senators captain picked up the puck in the left corner and wheeled into the slot to beat Lundqvist with a wrist shot. 
In the third, Lundqvist made a blocker stop on Vermette's short-handed breakaway in the opening minutes to pre­vent Ottawa from expanding its lead. 
The save was a turning point, and the Hangers evened the score on Sjostrom's tally at 7:17. Mare Stall unloaded a hard shot from the point and Sjostrom knocked in the rebound for his seeond goal. 
That set the stage for over­time. 
New York's Michal Hozsival had the only shot in overtime, a sharp-angle bid in the final seconds. The Senators outshot the Rangers 28-27 heading into the shootout. 
Bruins 3, Maple Leafs 2 
Michael Ryder, Phil Kessel and Matt llunwick scored, leading the Boston Bruins to a victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Monday night. 
Marc Savard and Milan Lucie each added two assists 
for the Northeast Division­
leading Bruins, who handed 
Toronto a loss in its return 
from a weeklong road trip. 
Jason Blake and Mikhail 
Grabovski scored for the 
Maple Leafs, who have only 
two wins in their last eight 
games. 
The Leafs returned home 
from a swing through Western 
Canada about 24 hours before 
the game and it showed dur­
ing a sluggish start. 
They dido 't get much help 
from goalie Vesa Toskala, 
either. He was particularly 
shaky during the first period, 
letting a soft shot from Kessel 
go through his legs at 9:40 
and giving up a big rebound to 
llunwick before he scored his 
first NIIL goal at 13:18. 
Suddenly, Boston had a 2-0 
lead and the game appeared 
headed f'or a blowout. 
But !Hake gave the Maple 
Leafs some momentum late in 
the opening period. He took a 
nifty bank pass off the end 
boards from Ian White and 
fired a shot over Tim Thomas 
at17:51. 
Toronto had several chances to tic it during the second period. The Maple Leafs were given three straight power plays -including 21 seconds with a 5-on-3 advantage ­but couldn't get another shot past Thomas, who made saves while flopping all over his crease. 
A nice individual rush by Hyder restored Boston's two­goal lead. The former Montreal Canadiens sniper dragged the puck around Leafs defenseman Pavel Kubina and beat Toskala high at14:11. 
Toronto found its legs in the third period after Grabovski scored his ninth goal of the season at 8:53 to make it 3-2. Niklas Hagman made a nice move to beat a defender and the puck found its way to a wide-open Grabovski at the side of the net. 
Bruins defenseman Aaron Ward took a late penalty and the Maple Leafs pulled Toskala, but Thomas stood tall during a late flurry. 
Red Wings 4, Oilers 0 
Ty Conklin made 20 saves for his fifth career shutout, Jiri Hudler and Niklas Kronwall each had a goal and an assist and the Detroit Red Wings beat the Edmonton Oilers on Monday night. 
Mikael Samuelsson and Johan Franzen also scored for Detroit, which has won five of its last six. Henrik Zetterberg added two assists for the defending Stanley Cup cham­pions. 
Dwayne Roloson stopped 37 shots for Edmonton. 


Kronwall had a power-play goal in the first and Detroit added two more in the second. Samuelsson tipped in Brett Lebda's pass out of the corner for his fourth of the season and Hudler's pass from the right circle deflected in off the leg of Edmonton defenseman Sheldon Souray at 14:18. 
Franzen added his ninth goal with 9:56 left in the game. He has scored in each of the last four games after missing five contests with a knee injury. 
Detroit's offense was more than enough for Conklin, who played for the Oilers for three seasons. 
Islanders 2, Canucks 1 (SO) 

Roberto Luongo made 34 saves against the team that let him get away, but couldn't stop Frans Nielsen in a shootout as the New York Islanders beat the Vancouver Canucks Monday night for their soason-best third straight victory. 
Nielsen seored on the !'irst shot of the tiebreaker, and Joey MacDonald turned aside all three Vancouver shooters -ending the game with a poke check against Alex Burrows. MaeDonald stopped 31 shots through overtime. 
Luongo, the Canueks cap­tain, could've been the Islanders' prized possession after he was taken with the No. 4 pick in the 1997 draft. He appeared in 24 games with New York during the 1999­2000 season, but was traded 
when the team made goalie 
Riek DiPietro the face of the 
franchise. 

Luongo kicked off 
Vancouver's four-game road 
trip with his 13th straight 
start and 17th in 18 contests. 
Pavol Demitra gave the Canucks a 1-0 lead in the opening minute, and it stood up until Doug Weight tied it with a power-play goal in the second period. 
Luongo is on an amazing run, one that recently fea­tured a team-record shutout streak of 242 minutes, 36 sec­onds. During the just-complet­ed homestand, Luongo went 4-1-1 and allowed only six goals -five on power plays. 
Tim Jackman, who had three prime scoring chances on Luongo in the second peri­od, drew the penalty the Islanders turned into their goal. Jackman stole the puek from Mason Raymond while New York was short-handed and skated in alone. Raymond slashed him from behind just before he got off a drive. 
On the power play, Weight moved the puek from the left point down to captain Bill Guerin, who returned it. Weight let go a hard drive that appeared to hit the stick blade of defenseman Shane O'Brien before finding its way past Luongo with 5:25 left. 
It was the first goal Luongo allowed before the third peri­od in six games, dating to his previous regulation loss Nov. 2 against Detroit. Luongo rebounded from that defeat with three straight shutouts and two outings in which he allowed a total of three goals before Monday. He lost a 2-1 shootout to Colorado last Wednesday. 
The Islanders outshot the Canucks 10-0 early in the middle period, in which they enjoyed three power plays, and 18-10 overall in the frame. For a while, it seemed as though New York might become Luongo's latest shutout victim. 
Less than five minutes into the second, Luongo flashed his left pad to kick out a good shot by Sean Bergenheim, and then denied Jackman seconds later after the forward was set up on the doorstep. 
MacDonald was sharp on the other end, too, as he gets more comfortable in the start­ing role in plaee of injured regular DiPietro -the man the Islanders drafted No. 1 overall in 2000 on the day they traded Luongo to Florida. 
MacDonald made his sev­enth straight start and 1Oth in the past 11 games. Just 12 seconds in, ho turned aside VaneouvfJr's 2-on-1 and had to avoid teammate Andy Hilbert, who crashed into the net and then had the cage fall on top and trap him inside by the end boards. 
The Canucks kept coming and grabbed a l-0 lead at 49 seconds when Demitra took a return pass in the right circle from Daniel Sedin and fired in his third goal. Demitra played in only his eighth game of the season, after missing nine due to a rib injury.

McGrady left the game in the opening minute of the second half after aggravating his left knee, which was oper­ated on this offseason to have loose bodies removed. He did­n't return. 
"Tonight I went back to square one, even before sur­gery, is how my knee is feel-
this is a bad

Yao and Artest both thought they'd be OK after joining McGrady on the bench late in the game. Artest was hurt on a drive to the basket in the final minute, and he ended up clutching his right ankle in a group of photographers on the baseline. 


He remained in the training room for a while after the game before limping heavily on his way to his locker. 
"People sprain their ankles all the time," said Artest, who had 17 points and 11 rebounds. "It's not broke." 
Yao left with 3:29 to play after a hook shot that gave Houston a 94-78 lead.

a year's worth of games over the last three seasons because of various injuries and McGrady get dinged up, too. 
"We don't need all of them hurt. Sometimes teams with three players like that, you may deal with one maybe having an injury because injuries are part of the game," Alston said. "But to have three of them down? We need these guys to be healthy." 
The Rockets still were able to withstand a 14-3 run by Oklahoma City that closed the deficit to 82-74 on Russell Westbrook's basket inside with 10:42 to play. Yao start­ed a six-point spurt with a hook shot in the lane, and the lead was back to 16 when he hit another one before leav­ing. 
Durant had 29 points to lead the Thunder, Jeff Green scored 16 and Westbrook added 14 points. Oklahoma City has lost eight in a row for only the 1Oth time in fran­chise history. That includes an 0-8 start and a 14-game losing streak later last season in Seattle. They're now 1-10 this season. 
"We just have to put two halves together. Tonight we 
played a great first half and not a very good second half," Green said. 
McGrady said before the season that the knee was healing slower than he had hoped, and that it would like­ly be a month into the season before he was back at full speed. He was still about two weeks shy of that point when it failed him again. 
"I've never. had any relief because I've just been trying to work my way into playing shape and strengthen my leg. I've never been 100 percent," McGrady said. "I've just been trying to play, hoping that playing on it will take me over the edge and I don't have any more pain. It hasn't worked in my favor." 
McGrady said he was told he'd be pulled right back out of the game if he was seen limping, and he didn't think he'd he able to play without doing that. 
"It's sharp pain," McGrady said. "It almost just seems like I never had surgery. I'm feeling the same pain." 
Yao was able to find a silver lining to all the injuries from the past few years. 
"I have experience in this," Yao said. "I know how to take care of my body."

Rowers finish fall season at Frostbite Regatta 
Volleyball team wins silver medal in Mich. 
Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame traveled to Grand Hapids, Mich. Saturday for its final event of the fall season, the Grand Frostbite Hegatta. 
Hosted by Midwest rival. Grand Valley State University, the regatta was a success for the Irish, yet it also lived up to its namesake with blustery eon­ditions and scattered snow showers. The Irish proved their toughness earning second, firth, sixth. eighth. eleventh and thir­teenth overall in a field of six­teen crews from Notre I>ame, (;rand Valley State and Michigan Statn. The day's radng consisted of a 1,500-meter upstream head race, followed by two downstream sprints· of 1,500 and 1,000 meters, con­eluded by a 500-meter upstream sprint. The final places were decidP.d by each boat's total time ovP.r the coursP. of the four events. 
Notre Dame's top boat used a unique "bucket rigged" lineup consisting of coxswain Michael Lehmann. stroke seat Michael Maggart, Nick Springer, Greg Flood, Andrew Haynes, Chuck Talley, Sean Gibbons, Michael WagnP.r and Liam Leyden. The crew's 14:27.3 time was less than ten seconds behind the total score of GVSU's top boat. The two teams fought hard throughout all four races, but the Irish came up short despite winning the final 5(l0-meter sprint. 
The combination of coxswain Melissa Welch, stroke seat Patrick Collard, Tim Parks, Hobert Hay, Graham Boechler, Zach Stackhouse, Charlie Hunter, Peter Feist and David Loughery finished fifth overall with an overall time of 15:24.6. 
Five seconds behind them were Kevin Quigley, Phil Brunner, Cliff Roberts, Karol Grzesiak, Rob Bowen, Matt Dobbertien, Stick Cumberworth, Tomas Castillo and coxswains Bryce Chung, Lisa Folkerth and Paige Norris in sixth place.

Lynch hangs up his cleats 
Associated Press 
TAMPA. Fla. -No more 
bone-jarring tackles for John 
Lynch. 
The hard-hitting, nine-time Pro Bowl safety rP.tired Monday, saying it was time to begin a new phase of life after 11 sea­sons with the Tampa Bay Buceaneers and four more with the Denver Broncos. 
He felt so strongly about the relationships he built with both clubs that he decided against stepping down in the eolors of either team. 
Nevertheless, returning to Tampa for the announcement spoke volumes. 
"I played 11 years here. We won a Super Bowl. But much more important was the jour­ney and the way we did things," Lynch said. 
''I'm proud to be a part of this organization, just likP. the Broncos. I'm proud of the way I played my career. You don't give yourself a pat on the baek too much. But at the end of the day, I'm lilled with pride and thankfulness." 
A third-round draft piek of the Bues in 1993, Lyneh was part of a eore of young play­ers-along with Derrick Brooks, Warren Sapp, Mike Alstott, Warriek Dunn and Honde Barber-who hnlpP.d transform Tampa Bay from a laughingstock into a champi­onship team. 
The :n-year-old made five trips to the Pro Bowl as a Buccaneer and four as a Bronco after Tampa Bay released him following the 2003 season in what generally was viewed as a cost-cutting move, even though Lynch was willing to take less money to stay. 
Ito left Denver on more pleas­ant terms in July after being bumped from his starting role and signed with New England during training camp. The Patriots cut him two weeks later, and Lynch had been pon­dering retirement ever since. 
"I knew in my heart I was done when I walked out of there," he said during a news conference attended by several former teammates, including Brooks, Dunn, Barber and Alstott, who announced his retirement earlier this year. 
Lynch finished with 1,277 tackles, 100 pass breakups and 26 interceptions in 224 regular­season games. 
"I remember a core group of players, eoaches and owners here believing we could change a culture of losing. We were the 'Yueks.' We were the worst franchise in football," Lynch said. "But having a belief and looking each other in the eye and saying we can change this thing, and we're going to change this thing, it made it so sweet when we eventually did." 
In addition to thanking the Bucs and Broncos, who sent a representative to Tampa for the occasion, Lynch paid homage to the four coaches-Sam Wyche, Tony Dungy, Jon Gruden and Mike Shanahan-he played for in the NFL. 
He also mentioned four for­mer Tampa Bay assistants­Herman Edwards, Mike Tomlin, Rod Marinelli and Lovie Smith-who are currently head coaches and talked about Bill Belichick granting his wish to play all of New England's pre­season finale. 


strong team. The Irish started the match slowly, and could not fight back in the first game, los­ing 19-25. 
This seemed to light a fire under the Irish, and they came back blasting, with junior mid­dle hitter Mike Nejedly slam­ming home kill after kill. Behind valiant hitting and 
superb blocking, the Irish dominated the second set and got the win,25-20. 
In the third set neither team took a clear lead and the score went back and forth. Dupage eventually outlasted the Irish for a 15-13 win. 
The Irish finished pool play with a defeat of Western Michigan 25-12, 25-19 behind brilliant setting from freshman Josh Rehberg. 
The Irish needed a win against Wisconsin-Milwaukee to make it into Sunday's Gold Bracket. 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee jumped out to an early lead and held on for a 25-15 win in the first game. Notre Dame bounced back strong, taking game two with authority, 25-7. The Irish rode their momentum into the rubber match and opened up a 12-7 lead. The game went to eight extra points in the win-by­two rules, but eventually the Irish fell 23-21. 

The Irish were forced to play in a one-and-done bracket Sunday. They started strong with a win over Central Michigan 16-25, 25-23, 15-10. Notre Dame's next opponent, Air Force, left and forfeited. So the Irish advanced to the Silver Championship. 
The team came out l'lat against Miami of Ohio. Freshman Josh Hehberg again tried to save the match with excellent setting, and even despite a great show of oiTensive 
play from freshman Kevin Padden and junior Jason Gott, the Irish fell 22-25, 21-25. 
The finish put the Irish in 18th overall. They are next in action on Nov. 24 in the Loyola Tournament, where they will play not only club teams, but varsity level teams in preseason action.

Vikings linen1en face suspensions this vveek 
Associated Press 
EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. -As three Minnesota defensive line­men travel to New York this week to meet with the NFL, they could be bringing the Vikings' playoff fate with them. 

Jared Allen, Pat Williams and Kevin Williams all will meet with league officials in hopes of avoiding suspensions that would gut the team's biggest strength. 
The Williams Wall will appear to discuss testing positive for a weight-loss diuretic that is on the list of substances banned by the league. They face four-game suspensions for violating the NFCs substance abuse policy. 
Allen will be there to talk about a hit on Green Bay quar­terback Aaron Rodgers two weeks ago that could leave him vulnerable to a suspension because it came two days after he was fined $50,000 for hits on Houston's Matt Schaub. 
Losing three of their biggest­literally and figuratively-stars would be a devastating blow for a team currently tied with Chicago and Green Bay atop the muddled NFC North. Allen leads the team with eight sacks and Kevin Williams is second with seven. All three play a pivotal role in the team's second­ranked run defense as well. 
All three players were unavailable for comment Monday following a 19-13 loss at Tampa Bay on Sunday. 
Kevin and Pat Williams declined comment after the game against the Bucs. When Allen was asked by reporters what he will discuss with league officials, he replied, "I have no clue. I'll find out when I get there." 
Coach Brad Childress was asked about the situation Monday. 
"I understand the question and I wish I could give you some insight, but those things are going to be between the league and who the league deals with," he said. "So it's difficult for me to comment on that." 
On top of it all, starting end Hay Edwards could face a fine for a late hit on Tampa quarter­back Jeff Garcia in the second quarter. 
Allen has said all season he never intentionally tries to hurt another player. 
"We play a violent sport. We know that and we willingly sign up for it," Allen said earlier this season when talking about the fines being issued by the league. "We don't ever purposely go· out to hurt anybody, ever. 
"I know for myself, I have the utmost respect for everybody who plays this sport. But at the same time, it's like you can't make rules to tame it down. This is what we do. We're grown men. We make the deci­sion to do what we do."

game winning streak. 
"It helps that we just played them," Brown said. "It would be different if we played them ear­lier in the year, but we know exactly what to expect." 
The Huskies come into the tournament very hot, the loss to the Irish being the only real stumbling block towards the end of the season. The loss to Notre Dame was only the sec­ond loss Connecticut has suf­fered since Oct. 18. 
The key to defeating the Huskies again will be to bring back the strong offensive play to complement the good defense. 
"We need to be much more efficient with our hitting," Brown said. "I think the key to us being able to win will be to get our offense in a better place where we have more options." 
In the event that the Irish defeat Connecticut, they would play the winner of No. 1 St. John's and No. 8 South Florida. 
Assuming that the Red Storm avoid the upset, the Irish would once again play a team that they faced this past weekend in round two. Notre Dame played on of their best games of the year against St. John's despite the loss, according to Brown, and she expects another strong outing in the event of the teams meeting down the road. 
Although the attitude is differ­ent in the locker room because it is officially tournament time, the Irish still must hold on to an approach that emphasizes one game at a time. 
"We can only take it one game at a time if we want to win," Brown said. 
Despite this, there is some­thing special in the attitude for the team when it gets to be Big East Championship season. 
"It's win or go home time," Brown said. "We know that this is it, and none of us want to go home." 
The Big East Championship begins this Friday in Pittsburgh and a champ will be decided by Sunday night.

ahead, 7-0, and giving the Ramblers a lead that they were able to keep for the remainder of the game. 
A few minutes after, Morrissey was able to counter the touchdown with one of its own. Senior quarterback Joe McBrayer passed to wide receiver Carl Anderson for the score, but the Siegfried defense was able to block the extra-point. 
"Our offense played well for most of the game," Morrissey junior middle linebacker Phillip Yuhas said. "But Siegfried flied around and forced some takeaways, which really swung the momentum their way at some crucial points." 
The game carried on in a 7­6 stalemate to halftime, but after several second-half interceptions, Siegfried was able to carry out a win in an exciting finish. Senior running back Marcus Young added an insurance touchdown to bring the game to a final score of 14-6. 
Morrissey's season is over, but they are still looking to what future classes can bring them in seasons to come. 
"We have a good foundation for next year, and our defense is still intact," Morrissey's freshman center Peter Teneriello said. 

Siegfried will have one more week of practice to prepare for its long-awaited champi­onship game appearance. 
"We have a bunch of guys who have given their time and became committed emotional­ly," Rambler offensive coordi­nator Rob Kelly said. "It's elat­ing to them to finally make it this far." 
Keenan 14, Stanford 8 
The rematch of The Battle for the Chapel resulted in a win for Keenan and an oppor­tunity to play Siegfried in Notre Dame Stadium next Sunday for the interhall cham­pionship. 
The game started out well for the Knights, who scored on a long opening drive with a sweep running play to the left to running back Alex Gonzalez. However, for the remainder of the game, the Stanford defense did an excel­lent job shutting down the Keenan offense, particularly through pass defense. 
"We had a little trouble passing the ball and the weather was really cold," Keenan captain Barton Dear said. "We made some mis­takes". 
The Stanford defense capi­talized on some of those mis­takes, giving the offense plenty of opportunities to put points on the board. Unfortunately, they were unable to do so, thanks in part to four inter­ceptions thrown by Stanford. The Griffins' only points came from a blocked punt that was returned for a touchdown. Stanford then completed a two-point conversion to give them an 8-7 lead. 
Much later in the game, Keenan took the lead with a pass to Jim Zenker, making the score 14-8. 
Stanford got the ball back with little time remaining, but pulled off a great hook-and­ladder play that put them near Keenan's forty-yard line. Unfortunately, time ran out on Stanford, giving Keenan the win and eliminating the Griffins from the playoffs. 
Keenan has one more week of practice to prepare for the top-seeded Ramblers. 
"Obviously Siegfried is a good team. They're undefeat­ed, so we're going to have to come out and play a good game," Dear said. 
Although Keenan will play for the interhall championship in their game against Siegfried, their win over Stanford was a significant win for them. 
"It was great everyone was really excited after the game," Dear said. "We've played a lot of games with them over the last few years and it was nice to get a win."

SEC Deputy Enforcement 
2004, Cuban Cuban's was invited Director fury at refer­
to get in on the coming stock offering by Mamma.com Inc. after he agreed to keep the information private. 
Cuban owned 6.3 percent of Mamma.com's stock at that time and was the largest known shareholder in the search engine company, according to the SEC. The agency said Cuban knew the shares would be sold below the current market price, and a few hours after receiving the information, he told his broker to sell all 600,000 shares before the public announce­ment of the offering. 
By selling when he did, Cuban avoided losses exceed­ing $750,000, the SEC said in its lawsuit. 
Cuban, 50 and a multibillion­aire, is a tech entrepreneur who sold his Broadcast.com to Yahoo Inc. in 1999 at the height of the dot-com boom. 
ee calls on the basket­ball court is 

legendary, and his verbal out­bursts at referees, National Basketball Association officials and sports reporters have raised his profile. He has been fined more than $1 million by the league for a series of episodes dating back to 2000 and suspended from a few games. 
"It is fundamentally unfair for someone to use access to non-public information to improperly gain an edge on the market," Scott Friestad, the SEC's deputy enforcement director, said in a statement. The agency alleged that Cuban acted with "scienter," a legal term indicating knowledge of wrongdoing. 
The SEC is seeking a court judgment against Cuban find­
 ing that he violated the antifraud provisions of the fed­eral securities laws. an injunc­tion against future violations, an unspecified civil penalty and restitution of the losses Cuban allegedly avoided. 
While the stock offering in question occurred more than four years ago. the SEC didn't learn about the specifics of the case until early 2007, accord­ing to agency attorneys. 
Cuban's lawyer said in a statement that the SEC's case "has no merit and is a product of gross abuse of prosecutorial discretion." 
"Mr. Cuban intends to con­test the allegations and to demonstrate that the (SEC's) clain1s are infected by the mis­conduct of the staff of its enforcement division," Ralph Ferrara wrote in a note posted on Cuban's blog. 
Cuban, in his own statement, said. "I am disappointed that the (SEC) chose to bring this case based upon its enforce­ment staff's win-at-any-cost ambitions. The staff's process was result-oriented, facts be damned. The government's claims are false and they will be proven to be so." 
Maureen Coyle, an NBA spokeswoman, said the league does not comment on such matters. 
Cuban is one of the richest people in the world, according to Forbes magazine, which pegged his net worth at $2.3 billion as of March 2007. Besides the Mavericks, he owns Landmark Theaters, a large national chain dedicated to independent films, and the HDNet cable television chan­nel. 
Cuban also runs a Web site called Sharesleuth.com, which bills itself as providing "inde­pendent Web-based reporting aimed at exposing securities fraud and corporate chi­canery."

score, and Davies added the extra point with a run of her own. 
After Welsh's subsequent failed drive, it looked as though the Purple Weasels would go into halftime up 7-0. But with 38 seconds left in the half, Whirlwind quarterback and captain Jenni Gargula made three long passes over the mid­dle, with the third landing in the hands of receiver Meghan Mulhern for a game-tying touchdown. 
Late in the second half, the Whirlwinds added seven more on a touchdown pass to Caroline Shakour.

McGlinn 12, Farley 7 

No. 2 McGlinn held ofr No. 3 Farley 12-7 Sunday afternoon, becoming the first Shamrocks' team to ever reach the champi­onship game. 
Farley looked sloppy out of the gates, as quarterback Emily Murphy's first pass of the day was intercepted by Casey Robertson, giving McGlinn prime field position. 
The Shamrocks capitalized on the turnover as team cap­

on the Pasquerilla West. sideline. A pass interference call pro­longed the drive and gave the Purple Weasels first and goal from the five-yard line. However, Welsh Family defend­er Katie Rehberger shut the door on the Purple Weasels' comeback with an interception in the endzone. 
With only seconds left, the Whirlwinds could take a knee and start their celebration as they had once again reached the Stadium.

extra-point 
attempt was 
unsuccessful, and McGlinn led 6-0. 
On the ensuing possession, Farley threatened, led by Murphy, who broke down the Shamrocks defense on the ground, running twice for 41 yards. 
Faced with a fourth-and-four, Murphy threw an incomplete pass, but the Finest got new life when defensive pass interfer­ence was called. Murphy took advantage, capping ofT the drive with a 3-yard touchdown pass. The extra point attempt was successful, and Farley surged ahead for a 7-6 lead. 
MeGlinn fought right back, as deGroot conneeted on back-to­hack deep throws, a 31-yard pass to Kathleen Stanley and a 36-yard touchdown pass to Lauren Miller. Again, the Shamrocks couldn't convert the extra point, but reclaimed the lead, 12-7. 
On its n1~xt possession, Farley quickly turned the ball over as Murphy's first pass was picked ofT again by Robertson, who had an outstanding overall per­formance for the Shamrocks. 
"Everyone was really proud of her," McGlinn captain Sarah deGroot said. "She has been really cluteh for the team the whole year." 
The first half ended with McGlinn still clinging to a five­point lead. 

~arley's defense valiantly kept the Finest within striking distance in the second half, but their offense was unable to muster a second half rally. 
Desperate to score, Farley resorted to using all lour downs on their final three possessions, but the Finest were eonstantly thwarted by the stellar play of the Shamrocks' defense, and McGlinn held on for the 12-7 victory. 
With their victory, the Shamrocks now move on to the biggest stage -Notre Dame Stadium to light for the cham­pionship, where they will face No. 1 seed Welsh Fam. 
"We're all pumped to go to the Stadium,'' deGroot said. "We couldn't be morn excited."

CELEBRITIES BORN ON TillS DAY: Isaac Hanson, 28; Daisy Fuentes, 42; RuPaul, 48; Danny DeVito, 64 Happy Birthday: There will be plenty happening this year with regard to your earning and fmancial power. You must avoid conflict but don't give in or get involved in things you don't agree with. Look at the possibilities and do not fear the outcome. Instead, work diligently, live in the moment and do your best and the result will surprise even you. Your numbers are 5, 12, 19, 21, 32, 35,46 
ARIES (March 21-April19): Rely on yourself if you want to get things done. Someone you love will have a hard time understanding what you want, so be patient. Put more time and effort into your fmancial situation -set a budget and stay within it. ** 
TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Make the adjustments at home that will make your life easier. Don't put up with anyone who opposes your plans. Being stubborn isn't always a bad thing if it saves you from something that may cost you too much.** GEMINI (May 21-June 20): You can make an impact on someone with your clever play on words and ability to convince others to do things your way. Your style, high energy and sensitivity toward others will all contribute to your success. Use your imagination. 
**** 

CANCER (June 21-July 22): You need to do something different. An interesting part­nership is likely to develop through someone you already know. Someone you've been re­sponsible for will pay you back. *** 
LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Prepare to compete for what you want. Don't allow your emo­tions to play tricks on you. Get all the facts before you make any sort of plea for help. The more conservative your approach, the further you will go. ***

Team picks up No. 12 seed in NCAA tourney 


ND earns first round bye and home game 
Observer Staff Report 
For the eighth year in a row Notre Dame is headed to the NCAA Tournament. 
Head coach Bobby Clark has brought his troops to the tour­nament every year since taking over in 2000. 
The Irish learned Monday that they would be the No. 12 seed this year. Notre Dame fin­ished the regular season ranked ninth in the country, but slipped slightly because of a 2-1 loss to South Florida in the Big East semi-finals on Sunday. 
The 16 tops teams in the 48­team tournament all reeeive first round byes. This is the lifth time that the Irish have sat out the first round. 
Last year Notre Dame was the No. 10 seed and advanced to the quarterfinal round before a 1-0 overtime loss to eventual champion Wake Forest. 
The first round bye also insures at least one home game for the Irish in the tournament. Notre Dame will take on the winner of the Northwestern­Loyola (III.) game to be played this weekend. 
The winner of that game will travel to Alumni Field next Tuesday night. Notre Dame is undefeated at home this year with a 9-0-1 record. They cur­rently have a 13-game unbeat­en streak on their own turf. that dates back to a 3-2 loss to Indiana on Oet. 17, 2007. 
Four other Big East teams will join Notre Dame in the tournament this year. 
St John's was awarded the No. 3 spot and South Florida was given the eighth seed. 
Wake Forest once again led the way this year picking up the No.1 seed.
