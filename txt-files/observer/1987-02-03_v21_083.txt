The Notre Dame student charged in connection with a traffic accident that killed a South Bend man will go to trial on Feb. 17, County Prosecutor Michael Barnes said Monday. 
The 20-year-old student has pleaded innocent to charges of reckless homicide and involun­tary manslaughter stemming from the Nov. 15 a<!cident. 
The case, which will be heard in St. Joseph County Superior Court, involves the death of Buddy D. Moore, 52, of 1314 Goodland Ave. 
Moore died of severe head in­juries one day after being struck by a car driven by the student, county police records show. 
Following the accident, the student was arrested on mis­demeanor charges of driving while intoxicated and driving charged with reckless homicide, a Class C felony which carries a maximum penalty of eight years in prison and a $10,000 fine. The mini­mum punishment is three years in prison.

The student was also charged with involuntary manslaughter, a Class D felony punishable by up to four years in prison and a $10,000 fine. The minimum penalty is a one-year prison term. 
According to police records, Moore was struck as he walked on Edison Road shortly after the Penn State-Notre Dame game. 
The accident occurred when the student's car made aU-turn on Edison Road, headed east and then struck Moore, police records show. 
Moore was taken to St. Joseph's Medical Center in South Bend, where he died the next day.

The petition will be presented to the Academic Mfairs Council which will meet in two and a half weeks. -The Observer 
Cartoonist Johnny Hart's "The Wizard of Id" and "B.C." comic strips have joined a New York State police campaign of posters, leaflets and pamphlets against teen-age suicide and drug abuse. One drawing shows the king from "The Wizard of Id" carrying a picket sign with the message "Start Your Own Revolution, Take A Friend Off Drugs.'' Similar locally produced flyers and pamphlets are in use in Colorado, Utah, Texas, California and Wash­ington state, officials said. -Associated Press 
Republican presidential hopeful Pete du Pont on Monday urged drug-use testing for workers in critical occupations, ranging from pilots and doctors to crane operators. Du Pont, the former Delaware governor and only announced GOP candidate for president, earlier had called for random drug-testing of school children nation­wide. He said the importance of eliminating drug use made mandatory testing a reasonable requirement, despite con­stitutional guarantees. -Associated Press 
Liberace, the piano virtuoso whose flashy garb and gentle wit made nim a television and concert favorite for 40 years, was reported near death on Monday at his desert home in Palm Springs, Calif. Liberace, 67, is suf­fering from anemia, emphysema and heart disease. Friend and manager Seymour Heller said the entertainer was exhausted after a sell-out performance in Radio City Music Hall early last month. Heller blamed the fatigue on a watermelon diet the star went on in 1986. He denied a report in the Las Vegas (Nev.) Sun that the star had AIDS. -Associate Press

as senior anticipates tbe future 
Anticipation permeates the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame community as seniors prepare themselves for the "real world." The Counsel­ing and Career development center at Saint Mary's and the Career and Placement services center at Notre Dame are filled with anxious students who are opening files, signing up for on-campus interviews and applying for graduate schools. 
The anticipation soon turns into anxiety as students prepare their resumes, receive second interviews and complete graduate school appli­cations. Mter this is done, students must wait. 
I think back to my senior year in high school when, in the fall, I hurriedly prepared at least eight applications to various colleges and uni­versities around the United States. I was set on attending one school in particular. I was told that I would hear by May 1 of my acceptance or rejection. For many weeks before, I thought about all the possibilities: how the letter would read if I were accepted, and how I would feel; and how the letter would read if I were rejected, and how I would feel. 
Not only did I imagine, but I also asked the opinions of my parents and teachers, "Do you think I'll get in?" (What were they supposed to say, NO?) Of course not. Quite politely, they all responded, "You have just as good a chance as anyone, you've done all you can do now it's up to the admissions committee. 
Soon May 1 came and my mailbox was empty. Itremained empty for several days afterwards. 
Approximately 3 weeks after the May 1 es­timation a letter arrived at my house. It read completely different than I had ever expected. I wasn't rejected, and I wasn't accepted. In­stead I was on a waiting list "until further notice." 
This is one option that I had not considered. My months of pondering over my future were over and I still didn't now the answers. 
Because of this delay, I couldn't hold off my college decision any further; instead, I withdrew my name from the waiting list and pursued another path. 
Manr seniors may feel this same anticipation as they wait patiently for second interviews or graduate school acceptance letters. 
It is comforting to know tha:t if the one career path a student counts on does not develop, there are many other paths that one can pursue. It is still difficult however, to go to the mailbox day after day, look in, and see light coming from the other side. It looks alone, empty and desolate. 
It is just as horrifying to open the mailbox and see the return address of the company or

graduate school, tear it open, only to find a financial aid form or a confirmation letter from a company. 
Whatever the case, one must always remem­ber that one letter does not make or break one's whole life. As Jeff Roberts, coordinator of place­ment services and assistant director of coun­seling and career development at Saint Mary's said, "It would take 181,818.18 twenty-two cent rejection letters to equal the $40,000 education students receive." 
With this in mind, Roberts .said students should realize that only a minute portion of available employers conduct on-campus inter­views. The on-campus system is designed to reject the majority of applicants, he said. 
Approximately 25 percent of college seniors have jobs when they graduate, either through on-campus interviewing or other wise, he said. 
Because of the competition involved with on­campus interviewing, rejection letters are the norm. When one is received, several questions should be asked: Was I geniunely interested in the position? ; If so, did I take the opportunity to present myself in the fullest sense, such as attending receptions, writing thank-you's, as­king questions, and researching the organiza­tion? ; If I did, were the odds in my favor to begin with? ; And finally, What was the compe­tition for the job position? 
With these questions in mind, students can begin to look realistically at the "real world," Roberts said. 
A person's whole life is not contained in one letter. If the original goal is not reached, an­other will take its place.

JERUSALEM -A parliamen­tary committee announced Monday it will conduct hearings on whether Israel promoted American arms sales to Iran and had a role in diverting profits to rebels in Nicaragua.

homosexuals on campus." 
Members of the senate also 
voiced criticism of statements 
contained within the resolution 
itself. 
"If they are to have club 
status, does that mean they 
could rent out Theodore's and 
have a gathering?" asked 
Maria Cintron, judicial council 
coordinator. 
"Just like the ISO could rent 
out Theodore's," said Gar­
diner, adding that allowing a 
homosexual club to rent out 
Theodore's would be the same 
as allowing the Black Cultural 
Arts Society to do so. 
Student Senator Tim Salmon 
said there was a distinction be­
tween recognizing a homo­
sexual organization and an or­
ganization like the 
International Student Organi­
zation. 
"The majority has given its consent to recognize (groups like the ISO) even though they are a minority," Salmon said. 
Recognizing a club for homosexuals however, "would go against the 7,400 students who are not homosexuals," he said. 
Gardiner said such a policy attitude "does not promote diversification in the student body." 
Freshman Advisory Council President Dave Kimkopf said he objected to a portion of the resolution which stated the ad­ministration's policy of "notal­lowing homosexuals the mini­mal rights to reserve a room and inform other of its exis­tence is harassment and prej­udice itself." 
Said Kimkopf: "I don't know if the University actually is prejudiced in acting the way it does. "I think what we're as­king here is the University to 
disregard the Church's teach-

Charge

the appropriate charge for (the student) to face at a mini­mum." 
Last week, the grand jury reviewed three fatal traffic ac­cidents, including the one in­volving Cogswell. The six­member panel returned one indictment, which was made public on Monday. 
Indicted on the Class D felony charge of involuntary manslaughter was a 20-year­old Mishawaka resident. 
The man was indicted in con­
nection with an Oct. 19 crash, 
which resulted in the death of 
a 16-year-old youth. 
The Mishawaka resident, who is not a Notre Dame stu­dent, turned himself in to aut­horities on Sunday. 
Following the Dec. 6 accident involving Cogswell, the 21­year-old student was arrested on the charge of driving while intoxicated, police said. The student had submitted to two blood-alcohol tests before the arrest. 
According to police, the stu­dent said he was driving east on Saint Mary's Road, stopped at a stop sign, then went for­ward and hit an unknown ob­ject. 
Cogswell, a 20-year-old Zahm Hall resident, died from mas­sive head injuries 10 hours after being struck. 
The 21-year-old student has not yet pleaded in the case, Barnes said. 
ing in making its policy, and that's a very serious thing .... I think (the University) acted absolutely correctly in the way it did." 
Sheila O'Conner, co-chairman of the Hall Presi­dent's Council, objected. She argued, "If you don't want to recognize homosexuals as a club, what do you suggest the group do? Just let them suf­fer?" 
Executive Coordinator Mike Jaeger said, "This University (already) provides for the things you are suggesting other than club status." 
Said O'Connor: "But then no matter what, you are stuck with Campus Ministry. "(We need to) get them some sort of room for a pre-arranged meeting." 
In response to criticism that such a meeting could become a "pick-up point for homosexuals," Gardiner said, "Heterosexual meetings are pick-up points .... A lot of the times it's the same thing." 
When a motion passed to vote on the proposal, Switek broke a tie by deciding against the proposal. 
Gardiner then submitted a proposal, whereby a review board would be established, which would "be available to students and review the status of the Observer once or twice a semester." 
Gardiner said the board would have no oversight powers. Nevertheless, the pro­posal stated that the board would "be allotted a certain amount of money by student government annually for ex­penses and in the instance that it must advertise something it finds totally wrong." 
Gardiner said he had heard complaints that The Observer rejects many of the columns submitted to it and that it is therefore not open to the full student body. 
Montanaro countered that this was the prerogative of an independent newspaper like The Observer. 
Gardiner said "If the stu­dents must pay a mandatory fee of $12 each year for the Ob­server, then the students should have a say in it." 
Montanaro said students already do have a say in it be­cause it is open to "any fresh­man who wants to become a reporter and work up through the ranks." 
Added Montanaro: "People have to pay for Scholastic and the yearbook too, and many don't get what they want to be in it." 
Switek then said, "I am violently opposed to any stu­dent government control what­soever over The Observer." 
At his request, over two thirds of the senate voted to close the debate. 
"I don't see any connection between us and The Observer,'' Switek said. 
The senate did pass a pro­posal to place two referendums on the student election ballot. One will ask students whether the University should set a date for disinvestment of its hold­ings in companies engaged in business activities in South Africa. The other will ask stu­dents to rate the quality of the Observer.

Tues-day,F-ebru-ary3_, 
Catholic theologians must present Church's views 
In light of the Charles Curran case, it would be appropriate for Notre Dame and other Catholic universities to reassess their own compliance with the principle of truth in labeling which is central to that case. The Sacred Con­gregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, with the approval of the Pope, informed Father Curran that "one who dissents from the Magisterium as you do is not suitable nor eligible to teach Catholic theology." The decision was based on Fr. Curran's "open contrast" with the teaching of the Church on the following issues: "on a right to public dissent from the ordinary Magisterium; the in­dissolubility of consummated sacramental marriage; abortion; eut­hanasia; masturbation; artificial contraception; premarital intercourse; and homosexual acts." 
Charles E. Rice 
guest column 
The comment of Bishop John M. D'Arcy of Fort Wayne-South Bend epitomizes the truth in labeling issue involved here. "It can never be the role 
 of a Catholic theologian," said Bishop D' Arcy, "to teach in opposition to what the Church teaches. People send their children to Catholic colleges and uni­versities to receive Catholic teaching. If a theologian calls himself or herself Catholic, and then teaches in opposition to the Church, the Church has not only the right, but indeed the obligation, to declare that that particular theologian cannot be considered a Catholic theo­logian because he is not only probing, analyzing and questioning, but claim­ing that in these areas the Catholic Church is wrong and I am right." The past presidents of the Catholic Theological Society of America and the Catholic Theology Society said in March, "If Fr. Curran's views on the various issues mentioned in the letter are so incompatible with Catholic teaching that he must be declared no longer a Catholic theologian, justice and fairness would dictate that other Catholic theologians who hold similar views should be treated in exactly the same fashion." However, unlike the Catholic University of America, Notre Dame, Georgetown, etc., are legally secular corporations with no juridical ties to the Church. It is likely that the sanction available to the Church with respect to a professor at such a univer­sity will be limited to a declaration that the professor is mislabelling himself by 
Do 

claiming to be a Catholic theologian. 
Incidentally, the right claimed on be­half of Fr. Curran, "to dissent from noninfallible Church teaching" does not exist. It could be argued that at least some of the teachings involved in the Curran case are infallible under the principles stated in the Second Vatican Council's Dogmatic Constitution on the Church (No. 25). Whether or not the teachings contradicted by Fr. Curran are technically infallible, however, there is no warrant for dissent from them. As Cardinal Ratzinger sum­marized the provisions of No. 25 of the Constitution and of Canon 752 of the Code of Canon Law, "the faithful must accept not only the infallible Magis­terium; they are to give the religious submission of intellect and will to the teaching which the Supreme Pontiff or the college of bishops enunciate on faith or morals when they exercise the aut­hentic Magisterium -even if they do not intend to proclaim it with a defini­tive act." The fact that the "dissenter" is a professor gives him no special privileges. If a theologian at a Catholic university cannot bring himself to ac­cept the teaching of the Popes and Councils, he ought to have the candor at least to present himself as a generic, rather than a Catholic theologian. 
Apart from the individual theologian, when an institution solicits money on the ground that it is a "Catholic univer­sity," it represents that it is Catholic as the term is understood by the govern­ing body of that religion and especially by the Pope, the only person in the world with the legal and moral author­ity to give conclusive definition to that term. The Pope has stressed, for exam­ple in his October 7, 1979, address in Washington, D.C., the duty of fidelity to the Magisterium which is incumbent on all Catholic universities and their theology teachers, with or without "juridical links to the Holy See." 
The Catholic university, of course, does not undertake to guarantee the spiritual formation of its students. But the university's claim to be Catholic in­volves an implicit assurance at least that the students will have a predic­table opportunity to study the Catholic Faith as that Faith is taught by the Popes and Councils. Those students are entitled to assurance that they will have a chance to study theological subjects with a professor who agrees with the Church or is at least willing and able to present the teachings of the Church favorably as well as accurately. If not, whatever they learn of those matters may be filtered through the distorting lens of a professor whose teaching will be affected by his own dissent, agnos­ticism, etc. What is most regrettable in such situatiqns is the missed opportu­nity to provide the students with the intellectual background that would enable them to make intelligent choices in matters of faith and morals for the governance of their own lives. 
If the parents of an entering fresh­man paid top dollar for a brand new Mercedes automobile and then dis­covered that what was under the hood was not a Mercedes engine but an old Ford Model T motor, they would have a remedy at law based on the violation of the principle of truth in labeling, whe­ther the switch were innocent or fraudulent. Those parents and students have a moral right to protection against a similar switch with respect to educa­tion. The professor who presents, as authentically Catholic, positions which contradict the Magisterium is merely

Giving crowd technical raises other questions 
Dear Editor: 
It was unfortunate when the Notre Dame student body was charged with a technical foul at the end of Sunday's game against North Carolina. I realize that what we did was wrong. We deserved to be punished. 
But that was our first foul as a student body this season, and it raises a few questions regarding crowd fouls. After the foul was called during Sunday's game, were we all supposed to raise a hand to let the scorer's table know that the foul was on us? What if we commit

applying to education the commercial standards of the Mercedes dealer who puts the Model Tengine under the hood. 
If a Catholic university cannot assure its students a chance to study the Cath­olic Faith as the Vicar of Christ intends it to be studied, let it drop the "Cat­holic" from its solicitations and let it acknowledge that, however good it may be in other respects, it is not Catholic in the most important sense in which that term is used. 
It ought to be possible at least for Notre Dame and St. Mary's to under­take, beginning with the next academic year, that students will have available at every level identifiable courses in which the Catholic heritage will be studied with professors who accept it as understood by the Popes and Coun­cils. Only then will the students have a fair opportunity to make intelligent judgments in that matter.

five crowd fouls in one game? Does this mean the whole crowd has to leave the arena before the referee will resume play? (Are NBA crowds allowed six fouls?) What if our team is losing in the closing minutes of a game -can the crowd intentionally foul a poor free­throw shooter on the opposing team? And finally, is there any way we can take a charge? 
Again, I am not questioning the call. It was clearly a foul on us. But for fu­ture reference, I feel that these ques­tions need to be addressed before the student body finds itself being asked to leave the arena.

maglne what It would be 
like to start your life over again, to re-enter the world with a new perspective on life and an Increased sensitivity toward your surroundings. Lou Nanni and Kim Krasavec, both 1984 graduates of Notre Dame, recently returned from a two and one-half year committment with the Holy Cross Associates in Santiago, Chile. The experi­ence has changed their lives. 
"I feel like we have been given new eyes and a new mind and a new mouth," said Kim. 
Their experience of actively sharing In the lives of an poor the Chilean poor, has given Lou and Kim a deeper sense of Christian faith as a guiding force In their lives. 
"I wanted a formative experi­ence," said Lou of his decision to join HCA, "I wanted to grow In my faith In God and to open myself up to an experience that would be challenging and new." Both Lou and Kim wanted to live and minister In a Christian community to better prepare themselves for life after college. 
"You realize that being a stu­dent In a university In the Unites States, that you are part of a privileged class. I had to go (to Chile) In order to begin to understand what was going on In the rest of the world, MLou said. 
Lou and Kim joined the other Holy Cross Associates In 
Recent Grads Return From Work In Chile 
Immersing themselves In the 
life ofa poverty stricken 
Chilean parish. "You learn the 
first year that the most valu­
able thing we do Is to love the 
people. ·u·s Chrlstaln tes­
timony." noted Kim. 
Another rewarding aspect of 
being a Holy Cross Associate Is 
the experience of communal of 
communal living. " You learn 
to love people that . you don't 
necessarily like, " said Kim. 
Lou added,"It was Incredible, 
the love and mutual respect we 
came to feel for one another." 
Kim compared the commu­
nity to an image of the Body of 
Christ. Each member of the 
community, like each part of 
the body, contributed to the 
healthy functioning of the 
whole. 
The Associate community In 
Chile Is Involved In many areas 
of service. Lou taught English 
at a school in the poblacion, or 
shanty town, of Andacollo, and 
he also taught at St. George's 
College, a school for the elite 
class of Santiago. 

In addition, his ministry In­cluded weekly visits to women Nanni and Krasavec with a Chilean Family

political prisoners. "The trauma that these people carry with them is Incredible," Lou said. Most of the women had been routinely tortured by the CNI (Chilean Intelligence), and yet their srtength was evident In the uncritical love they showed to their visitors. The women left Lou with a plaque that 
read:"You have come to know women who have consciences as fertile as their wombs." 
Kim also taught English at the Coleglo Andacollo. She later worked with the Vicariate for Youth Ministry. Here Kim was Involved In a popular edu­cation program In which the students and teachers learned together. "We all have some knowledge and we all lack some knowledge," she said. 
"The challenge of Christianity is to love and share in the suf­ferings of those beyond our family and close friends and I think that ts· one of the founda­tions of this program," com­mented Lou. 
Kim met one Chilean man who embodied this spirit of Christian giving. He was stand­Ing In front of his one room hut when a relief group stopped to ask for contibutions to aid the victims of a recent earthquake."It was cold out­side," Kim recalled, "and the man took the shirt off of his back and gave It to us, saying. 'They need It more than I do."' She added, "It makes you reevaluate everything all over again." 
Kim and Lou are currently Involved In the Transition phase of the Holy Cross As­sociates' program. Part of their ministry Includes sharing their Chilean experience with people back In the United States. They are scheduled to address the Notre Dame community tonight at 7 p.m. In the CSC. and Sun­day, February 8, at 4 p.m. The presentations will reflect on the value of participating In any Christian ministry, through their particular experience In Chile. 
What Is next for Kim and Lou? Lou will be at Notre Dame this semester, working at the Kellogg Institute and asslssting Fr. Malloy, while taking graduate courses In Govern­ment. Though Kim has a lot of questions about the future, she Is sure of one thing; "I want to integrate Chile Into everyday of my life."

West German auto manufacturers react to declining dollar 
By YORK DAMM Business writer 
A dropping dollar is expected to give the U.S. economy a major push to recover from its huge $170 billion deficit in 1986. But how far does the dollar have to decline so that a posi­tive effect on the economy will take place? 
Since Feb. 26, 1985, when the dollar reached its peak in West Germany at 3.47 marks, the dollar has declined steadily to 
1.84 marks as of last Friday. Economists have said they believe that a 40 percent drop of the dollar against the Ger­man mark and against the Japanese yen has to occur to support the efforts of the ad­ministration to lower the trade deficit significantly. 
A declining dollar is expected to make imports so expensive that the consumer will turn to products that are made in America. Although import prices went up 9 percent during 1986 and the December trade deficit went down slightly, many companies already see too much damage done to their business by the strength of the dollar in recent years. 
. Importers have reacted quickly to the changing value of the dollar, as they strike back by offering rebates and discounts for periods of months to protect their hold on the U.S. markets. For example, West German manufacturers such as Bayerische Motorenwerke AG <BMW), Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen AG would rather accept cuts in their prof­its than a loss in their share of the U.S. car market. Surpris­ingly, both BMW chairman Eberhar-d von Kuenheim and Mercedes Benz chairman Werner Breitschwerdt are op­timistic for 1987. BMW, selling 90,000 units in the United States annually and being the number 16 car producer in the world, relies on its "image of an ac­cepted and renowned luxury­car maker," as von Kuenheim pointed out in an interview with Business Week. 
Mercedes Benz, being the number 15 car producer in the world, relies on a high quality and high performance basis like that of BMW. In fact, the latest model of BMW, the 735i and the Mercedes Benz luxury automobile, the 560 SEL are tough competitors on both the German and the international markets. 
A third West German car­maker, the Volkswagen AG, producer of the Golf GTI, Jetta and the Audi 5000 S expects its sales to be at the same level as in 1986. Consumer complaints about an "acceleration prob­lem" caused losses last year, which Volkswagen hopes to compensate for in 1987. 
Volkswagen's chairman stressed the fact that the prob­lem with the 5000 S has been resolved and estimates a slight improvement in sales for Volkswagen AG worldwide. 
In Japan, a rising yen has caused many car producers to raise prices on their models by an average of $1,300 last year. Further increases are very likely for this year ac:;cording to industry experts. However, Japan's share of the U.S. trade deficit, an estimated $52.6 bil­lion in 1986, is calculated to drop only marginally by $400 million in 1987. Self-imposed limits on exports by the Japanese car makers are not likely to help the trade deficit soon, because they have oc­curred only in insignificant numbers so far. Japan, being the number three export country (the United States was surpassed for the number one spot by West Germany in the period of Jan.-Oct. 1986) achieved a huge trade surplus in 1986, which amounted to $91.8 billion. Given this fact, many have said it is clear that the Japanese are eager to main­tain this surplus. They will do so by renovating their produc­tion facilities throughout 1987 to come out even stronger at the beginning of 1988, at the 
latest in 1989. 
General Motors and Ford, combining for a total of $13.5 million in car sales per year have to stay alert if they want to avoid a flooding of the U.S. market as has occurred in pre­vious years. 
The United States, having trade connections to more than 130 countries in the world, is going through rough economic times at the moment, which are worsened considerably by its trade partners in Japan and Western Europe. A trade war was just narrowly averted recently, when negotiations resulted in an agreement on 
U.S. grain exports to Europe. Only 24 hours later, an ul­timatum by the United States would have expired which would have led to 200 percent increases in the prices of prod­ucts of the Common Market, such as French cognac, Dutch cheese or British Wiskey. In return. the Common Market threatened to impose high taxes on U.S. agricutural prod­ucts. Although a trade war was avoided, tensions remain in in­ternational trade concerning equal access to all markets, without restricting taxes or regulations anywhere. Until a agreement can be agreed on, the United States will continue to have a negative trade bal­ance. 
Cost-conscious advertisers shorten TV commercials 
In case you were wondering why you've been seeing more commercials while watching less TV lately, its not because the networks are selling more advertising. The reason: The spots are shrinking. 
Growing numbers of cost-conscious advertisers have been favoring 15-second commercials over the traditional 30-second spots for the last two years. This strategy, for instance, was the only one avail­able for a company to spend less than $500,000 to remind Super Bowl viewers about its product. 
For the large advertisers, the question comes down to this: Do we want to form an impression or are we satisfied with giving our customers a simple reminder? 
Still, problems arise when too many short spots run in a row. John Goodchild of the Weightman agency feels that viewers get annoyed when there are eight ads in one break. Even Manning admits "there's a real danger of overloading 15's with un­necessary details and too many selling points." 
Polaroid Corp. has decided to change its spots 

Alex VonderHaar 
Business Bits 
from time to time. Normally, it uses longer ads for television, but "15's are a very nice way to remind people of the message in our longer commercials." Their abbreviated ads touting their Spectra camera led to impressive sales results at Christmastime. 
Currently, about 20 percent of the 5300 weekly network ads last fifteen seconds, but that share is rising. Last fall, Gillette introduced Foamy shave cream for sensitive skin. Although most marketers recommend against using brief spots for product introductions, Gillette's effort has worked so far. The spots using footage of Abbott and Costello slap­ping each other took advantage of Foamy's estab­lished name.

Have you ever driven past a small inn called "Patel's Motel?" Patel is the name that comes from a clan of landowners in the west-coast Indian state of Gujarat. 
Indian immigrants have seen a great deal of suc­cess in the U.S., but most Americans still associate them with cheaper sleepers. In fact, The Wall Street Journal cited a study indicating that 28 percent of the 54,000 hotels in this country are Indian-owned. They dominate the smaller inns, for example, in California and throughout the South. 
Discrimination limited their progress. As late as 1935, businessmen in the West posted billboards reading, "No jobs for Japs or Hindus." Relaxation of immigration rules ushered in a new age after 1965 as more Asians were allowed to enter the United States. Indian immigrants now number more than half a million with 500 more arriving each week. 
Government eases regional phone company rules 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The Justice Department proposed Monday that the seven regional Bell companies be turned loose to compete in making telephones and offering information ser­vices, but it disappointed their desires to enter a key part of the long-distance market. 
In a 210-page filing to U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, the department said competi­tion and changing regulation in the industry since the breakup of the Bell system three years ago have ended the need for most of the restrictions on the regional companies. 
Further, the department's antitrust division said, changes were needed to bring to consu­mers more sophisticated equipment and new electronic information services--such as message storing and electronic mail--already offered to consu­mers in other countries.

After winning seven matches in one week, including one which featured perhaps the team's best comeback ever, the Men's Volleyball Club fi­nally ran out of gas, losing to Bowling Green in the semi­finals of a 15-team tournament at Ann Arbor, Mich. 
Before the tournament, the Irish defeated Grand Valley State, 15-10, 15-8, 15-11, and then came from two games behind to beat Miami (Ohio), 12-15,11­15, 15-8, 15-1, 15-11. It was the first time in at least three years that Notre Dame had come from two games down to win a match. 
"Against Miami of Ohio, everyone played really well. The last three games we really came together as a team," said Club President John Sullivan. "We had a lot of fan support, and they were really behind us the whole way. 
The Irish will be back at home in the ACC Pit to face Wisconsin this Saturday at

Playing in Rivers' shadow does not concern Jackson 
By BOB KEMPER Sports Writer 
Playing in David Rivers' shadow. That is the future freshman guard Jamere Jack­son faced when he signed his national letter of intent last year. But that did not bother him when he chose Notre Dame. 
"It did not bother me at all that I would be playing in the shadow of David," says Jack­son. "In choosing a school, basket­ball was actually the third priority. Academics were first and a good social atmosphere was second. I am not looking at Notre Dame as a stepping stone to the NBA. Playing pro­fessional basketball is a longshot for any player." 
Those are pretty humble words for a player that averaged 12.9 points per game while earning four letters at Manuel High School in Peoria, Ill. Jackson also was named to several all-state teams and was nominated for McDonald's all­America team." 
"The most exciting thing about Notre Dame is that the Notre Dame family extends across the United States. Whe­ther we are playing in Philadel­phia or Los Angeles, people are always pulling for us. Wher­ever I go when I graduate, Notre Dame will be there." 
So far this season Jackson is averaging 10.1 minutes and 2.7 points per contest. 
"When Donald (Royal) was hurt and a couple of other players were getting off to a slow start I got to play a lot," he says. "Now it is back to what I had anticipated -waiting. My high school coach told me that those kids that wait and are pa­tient will get their chance. I am sure my chance will come." 
Head Coach Digger Phelps is high on his freshman guard.

Swimmers edge Cleveland State; women roll over St. Bonaventure 
By KELLY TOWNSEND 
Sports Writer 
The goals were set, and the Irish swim teams met them in swimming action over the weekend. 
Friday both the men's and women's swim teams defeated Cleveland State, and the wo­men also won their meet against St. Bonaventure on Sat­urday. 
When Cleveland State faced the Irish in the inaugural meet at Rolfs Aquatic Center last season, the Vikings handed the Irish a loss. Friday they returned the favor in the only way possible, at Cleveland State's home pool. 
For the first half of the meet, the Irish trailed Cleveland by a seven point margin. But a first and second-place finish in the 200-yard IM pulled the men to within one, and the Irish took a one point lead after the one meter diving event. 
From that point the Irish kept the lead over Cleveland. They increased the spread to ten points after an impressive showing in the 200-yard breaststroke. Finally meet came down to the 400-yard freestyle relay, and Notre Dame emerged from the water with a 116-99 victory over Cleveland State. 
"This was a significant win for the men," said Head Coach Tim Welsh. "Last year Cleveland blew past us like we were just learning to swim. They stayed keyed up through­out the meet." 
The women also faced a tough Cleveland State women's team. Their meet was almost a mirror image of the men's, with the women taking an 11 point lead before the final relay and then adding seven points for a well-earned 143-125 vic­tory. 
"The women ran into a much harder team than we ex­pected," said Welsh. "We had to be real careful about how we swam, with St. Bonaventure still to face on Saturday." 
Despite a late arrival at St. Bonaventure that evening, the Irish were able to continue their strong swimming on Sat­urday. 
The women started the day off on the right foot with a 137­122 victory over St. Bonaven­ture. Mter leaping out to an 11­4 lead in the first event, the women kept St. Bonaventure in check. Although St. Bonaven­ture launched many comeback attempts, they could not catch the keyed-up Notre Dame swimmers. 
The men, hoping for another victory, were met in the water by a determined St. Bonaven­ture team. Undaunted, the Irish put fear into St. Bonaven­ture with solid performances throughout the meet. Despite a valiant effort, the Irish fell to St. Bonaventure, 117-95. 
Coach Welsh was more than pleased with the weekend's performances. 
"We obtained one of our ob­jectives," said Welsh. "We beat a team we lost to last year in grand style. It's a tribute to our guys that we were able to go neck-and-neck against two strong teams. 
"Not only did we win, but we were able to drop our times in all the key events. Once a couple people go faster, the whole team follows suit." 
Improvements in time will give the Irish an edge this weekend as they travel to Brad­ley University and then return home Saturday for a meet important in the three-point shot aspect of the game." 
While balancing the demands of being a varsity ath­lete and a successful student at the University of Notre Dame would be a bit overwhelming for most 17-year-olds, Jamere Jackson is taking it all in stride. The transition from high school to the collegiate ranks has been a smooth one for the Peoria na­tive. 
"The workload has not been that different from high school. What is different, though, is the need to budget time more ef­fectively." says the Dillon Hall resident. "The free time be­tween classes, combined with new distractions, can be a real temptation. What it comes down to is studying between classes instead of turning on the television and watching a soap opera. 
"Juggling time between bas­ketball and studying does not present that much pressure. Everyone knows Coach Phelps' position on academics. Ifa con­flict arises, basketball is second. We would never be penalized if we had to skip practice in order to study for a

test." 
When asked why he decided on Notre Dame over the likes of Wisconsin, Marquette and Northwestern, Jackson responds without hesitation. 
"I will answer that question like any sincere student­athlete. Notre Dame is the best of both worlds. On one hand, the TV exposure and athletic tradition are fantastic, while on the other hand, academics are of first priority." 
Academics have always been quite important to Jackson. He was permitted to skip a grade in elementary school and was ranked 13th in a graduating class of 208 in high school. He is presently enrolled in the Frershmen Year of Studies and I plans to major in business ad­ministration. 
"When we travelled to Maryland earlier this year to take on the Terrapins, Tracy Jackson, Duck Williams an Collis Jones showed up at ou practice session. They faced the same demands that we do, and now they dress in suits and ties. It was reassuring to see that all the hard work is well worth it."
