No ideas remain for today's inside column 
"Four little Indians going out to sea; A red 
herring swallowed  one  and then there  were  
three."  
-Agatha Christie, "A nd Then There  were  
None."  

Writing this week's column was akin to being in the novel "And Then There Were None." I had four ideas for the column; each with Pulitzer Prize written all over it. 
The first was a classic. What could be better than a column about how pretty and intelligent Notre Dame and Saint Mary's women are? 
I began writing: "The encounter occurred in a bar in Florida over the summer. 'Where is Notre Dame?' the tall, beautiful blonde asked. 'California?' 
'No,' I said. 'It's in Indiana.' 'Ohhhhh,' she replied. 'Hey. . . I'm from In­diana.' 
"I can't wait to get back to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's," I wrote. "There, the women are good looking and intelligent." 
"That's not such a good idea," said Editor­in-Chief Kevin Becker, who was reading over my shoulder. "It sounds too sexist." 
And then there were three. 
That's all right, I thought. I had a great idea about the trials and tribulations of looking younger than my 21 years. 
Again it was classic prose: 
''The dental assistant was cleaning my teeth this summer, attempting to make small talk. 'So when do you graduate from high school?' she asked. 'Ouch,' I said." 
This is gre-at stuff, I said to myself. I pounded out a few more humorous words. 
"That's not that funny," said Accent Editor Mike Naughton, who had walked by my termi­nal. "You need to exaggerate to make it funny." 
I'm not exaggerating, I said. 
And then there were two. 
No problem, I thought. I'll write abo_ut the dating situation at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's--or the lack thereof. The column would rank right up there with award-winning pieces by Bob Greene, and even (gasp) Mike Royko. I starting writing: 
"'I've been here only a week and already I'm tired of parties,' a Notre Dame junior com­mented the other day. 
She's right, you know. Parties seem to be the only social outlet around here. Dating ap­parently has gone the way of the $10 textbook.'' 
"Somebody wrote a column just like that last year," a reporter reminded me. "And besides, it'lllook like you're trying to get a date." 

Mark PankOWSki 
Managing Editor 

And then there was one. 
No problem, I said to myself. I've still got one good idea left. No, a great idea. I'll write about the reasons freshmen give for wanting to work at The Observer. 
I began writing, using the answers freshmen gave at Activities Night to the question "Why do you wish to work for The Observer?" 
There were the straight-forward answers: "For the hell of it." 
There were the complimentary answers: "I want experience working on a paper and be­sides --The Observer is great !!'' And there were the not-so-complimentary: "I find it sadly lacking in a firm position aganst a number of outrageous attacks on student rights. Also, I think commies run it."' 
The column ended with a pitch for students to come to tonight's open-house meeting. "No matter what your reason," I wrote. 
"You're not really going to write that," Be­cker said after I told him my latest idea. "It sounds too much like we're tooting our own horn." 
You're probably right, I said. 
And then there were none.

Senior chosen CK International President 
By LIZ PORTER 
News Staff 
Scott Bearby, a senior Government/ALP A major, recently became the first Notre Dame Circle K mem­ber elected President of the International Circle K or­ganization. 
Elected by popular vote, Bearby presented a prepared platform and cam­paigned for his office at a 600 member convention held in St. Louis last August. 
The Circle K organization is the largest organization at the collegiate level devoted to leadership and service de­velopment. The main goals of the organization include individual leadership devel­opment, as well as involve­ment with social service projects. 
An affiliate of Kiwanis, collegiate CKI clubs func­tion on local, district, nation­al, and international levels. The organization also spon­sors special social events, promoting friendship among club members. 
Any Circle K member may run for an international office, but experience working with the Circle K or­ganization plays a large role in a candidate's bid for of­fice. 
Bearby had the necessary experience, serving as Inter­national CKI Secretary in college and having been in­volved in high school with Key Club. 
Acting as International President, Bearby presides over Circle K chapters in seven nations in North America. Satellite groups 
, 

also exist in South America, Europe, and Asia. North American countries in­volved with CKI include Canada, the United States, Mexico, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. 
Because of long distances, Bearby will not travel to all the international Circle K or­ganizations. He will, however, visit a large num­ber of Circle K districts in the United States and Canada, exchanging infor­mation and ideas with other club members. 
As well as his correspond­ence with Circle K districts, he will also serve as the Chairman of the CKI Board of Trustees. 
Comprised of eleven stu­dents, this board's major projects include club mem­bership development, and activity planning and man­agement. 
According to Bearby, the incorporation of leadership development in a social ser­vice group is the most ap­pealing aspect of member­ship in the Circle K club. 
Bearby said, "The organi­zation has been very good to me. It has helped me develop my leadership capa­bilities, while providing me with the opportunity to meet a lot of great people." 
Serving as chief executive officer of a non-profit or­ganization, commented Bearby, also presents him with many new career con­tacts. 
Through his new posi­tion,he brings recognition to the University of Notre Dame and its Circle K club, 

SMC hall slated for dedication 
By SHANNON McGOWAN 
Staff Reporter 
The newly renovated Saint 
Mary's College Science Hall 
will be dedicated on Oct. 10. 
At 10:30 a.m. a mass of 
thanksgiving will be celebrated 
in the Holy Spirit Chapel of 
LeMans Hall. 
Following, there will be a 
luncheon for special guests in 
the Haggar College Center, 
said Mary Gerber, Director of 
Special Events and Programs. 
The formal dedication 
ceremonies will begin at 1 p.m. 
with an academic procession 
and ceremony at the main en­
trance of the Science Hall. 
The theme for the ceremony 
is 'Achievements of Women in 
Science. 
The Reverend Ernan 
McMullin of the University of 
Notre Dame will preside over 
the dedication. 
The main speaker for the 
dedication symposium address 
is Mary L. Good, president of 
the American Chemical Soci­
ety. 
She will also be the recipient 
of an honorary degree in 
recognition of her many ac­
complishments, according to 
Gerber. 
Several prominent women scientists will also be present for the dedication. 
At 2 p.m. the symposium will begin in Carroll Auditorium. Other participants in the sym­posium will be Catherine Har­mon '67, Terri Menke Hargrave '68, Barbara Spakowski Slatt '71, and Monica Creamer '79. 
A reception follows in the sci­ence hall. 
At approximately 3:45 p.m. tours of the science hall will depart from the main lobby. 
Throughout the building there will be various exhibits of the Chemistry, Biology, and Physics departments on dis­play. 
The holographic works of Douglas Tyler, Assistant Pro­fessor of Art, will also be on display. 
The cornerstone of the build­ing sums up the spirit of the dedication ceremonies "Great are the works of God to be pon­dered by all who love them"(Psalm 3:2). 
The greenhouse and some of the rooms in the classroom complex will also be dedicated, Gerber said.

The latest confirmed Iraqi raid was on the small offshore supply ship Big Orange 14. It was reported sunk by an air­fired missile late Tuesday near Kharg Island, Iran's main oil export terminal in the northern gulf.

Two empty Kuwaiti tankers and their U.S. navy escorts reached the sheikdom at the head of the gulf Tuesday. The warships are expected to make the return trip with three ves­sels that have been loaded and waiting for days. 
Iran accuses Kuwait of re­ceiving arms shipments for its neighbor Iraq, whose ports 
were closed soon after the war began, and since last Septem­ber has been attacking ships owned by or serving the sheik­dom. 
Eleven of Kuwait's 21 tankers have been given the American flag so Navy ships can protect them. Convoys began July 21. 
Speedboats operated by Iranian commandos fired on a Greek tanker and Cypriot 
freighter during the day Wed­nesday after overnight attacks on tankers of South Korean, Ja­panese and Spanish registry. A speedboat raked a Kuwait-flag

MANAMA, Bahrian-Iranian speedboats and Iraqi warplanes attacked at least seven ships in the Persian Gulf within 24 hours, and U.S. war­ships prepared on Wednesday to escort more tankers through the war zone. 
The Iraqis reported a fifth day of air raids on Iranian ship­ping, oil fields and other indus­trial targets. Iran said its ar­tillery shelled military and industrial installations in southern Iraq, and Iranian planes struck in the northern area of the 730-mile border warfront. 
Eighteen attacks on ships have been reported and 13 con­firmed since Iran and Iraq, which have been at war since September 1980, resumed their "tanker war" last weekend after a six-week lull. 
Shipping executives, speak­ing privately, said the 13 con­firmed attacks in less than a week compare with monthly

MANILA, Philippines -Con­spirators in plots leading to last week's bloody coup attempt discussed killing Americans and burning CIA headquarters in Manila, the government said Wednesday. 
A general who commanded the army under deposed Pres­ident Ferdinand E. Marcos was involved in plotting a military takeover, said the report, prepared by President Corazon Aquino's security force and 
released by the Presidential 
Palace. Aquino, in a national broad­cast Wednesday, said 53 people were killed in Friday's coup at­tempt, including 12 loyal sol­
diers, 19 rebel troops and 22 civilians. 
Hundreds were wounded, in-eluding her son, Benigno Aquino III. 
Col. Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan, who led the coup at­tempt, remained at large, and the military intensified air and ground searches for him in Manila and north and east of the capital. 
·The "after battle" report said Marcos loyalists met July 14 at a Manila restaurant to dis­cuss "CIA support for des­tabilization," bombing cam­paigns, the assassination of three unidentified Americans and "burning of CIA headquarters."

West German pilotadmits mistake 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -West German teen-ager Mathias Rust apologized to a Soviet court Wednesday for flying a single­engine plane into Red Square. He said it started as a mission of peace but ended as the greatest mistake of his life. 
"My flight was not the best action to bring this about. I'm very sorry," Rust, a 19-year­old resident of suburban Ham­burg, said during nearly five hours of testimony on the first day of trial at the Soviet Su­preme Court. 
It was his first public appear­ance since he piloted a Cessna 172b across the Soviet border on May 28 and set it down amid hundreds of astonished pedestrians on Red Square near the Kremlin, the seat of Soviet power. 
The flight led to a shake-up of the Soviet military establish­ment. 
Rust faces charges of hooliganism, illegally crossing the Soviet border and violating international flight rules, and he could get 10 years in prison. The trial is expected to last three days. 
Dressed in a blue suit, a light blue shirt and tie, Rust called himself "a very sentimental man'' who meant no harm to anyone. 
He said he wanted to meet with Soviet leader Mikhail Gor­bachev to discuss a new politi­cal system that would bring east and west together il) ''full democracy, democracy in the fullest sense of the word." 
"I sought the source of peace, and the source of peace is not in Washington, but in Mos­cow," said Rust.

Hoosiers obey limits 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -The 65 
mph speed limit that took effect 
June 1 on rural interstates has 
had a negligible effect on the 
number of traffic fatalities in 
Indiana, a state police spokes­
man said Wednesday. 
State police recorded 17 in­terstate traffic fatalities from May 29 to Sept. 2, compared with 15 during the same period last year when the maximum speed on all highways was 55 mph. 
"There's no way, statistical­ly, that can be significant,'' Lt. Ken Hollingsworth said. 
Hollingsworth said he believes the attitude among In­diana motorists has played the biggest role in keeping the death count down in Indiana when some other states are reporting increases. 
"We in our state have reason to believe that the public has pretty well accepted the 65 mph limit as a fair speed and that people are going 65," he said. "Voluntary compliance is playing a large part in this." 
Although the number of in­
terstate deaths since the speed 
limit increased is two greater 
than m the same period last 
year, the year-to-date count is 
up by six, for a total of 36 
fatalities. However, Hol­
lingsworth said that still is a 
statistically insignificant in­
crease. 
He added that when traffic deaths on all rural roads are considered, the year-to-date number actually has decreased by 13, from 504 last year to 491 this year. 
About 850 of the 1,119 miles of interstates in Indiana were affected by the new law, which raised the speed limit from 55 mph to 65 mph on interstates located outside cities with populations of 55,000 or more. 
Hollingsworth said compli­ance with the law is evident not only in the fatality figures but also in reports from officers patrolling the highways. 
As an example, he noted that a trooper who clocked 100 cars in a central Indiana county recently found only seven ex­ceeding 65 mph and, of them, only two were going faster than 70 mph, Hollingsworth said.

from 74.7 years reported in 
1985. 
The highest life expectancy 
was 78.9 years for white 
females, up from 78.7 a year 
earlier. White males saw an in­
crease from 71.8 to 72.0 years. 
Black life expectancy rose 
from 65.3 to 65.5 years for men, 
but declined from 73.7 to 73.6 
years for women, the center's 
annual summary of vital sta­
tistics reported. 
Births totaled 3,731,000, down 
18,000 from 1985. That 
represented 64.9 live births per 
1,000 women aged 15 to 44, 2 
percent below last year and the 
lowest rate ever recorded in the 
United States, the report said. 
The drop reflects the trend of 
recent years, as many young 
people have postponed mar­
riage and families to pursue 
education and careers. 
Social scientists have 
debated in recent years whe­
ther this represents merely a 
delay in having children or a 
decision l_lot to have families. 
Only time,will disclose the an­
swer as the children of the post­
World War II baby boom pass 
through their prime childbear­
ing years. 
Trends in the number of an­
nual births are affected by two 
factors, the rate of births 
among women and the number 
of women in the childbearing 
ages. 
The Census Bureau has projected that the total number of women in the prime childbearing ages will remain substantially the same through the remainder of this decade. 
Turning to marriages, the center reported 2,400,000 in 1986, down about 25,000 from 1985. 
That represents a national marriage rate of 10.0 per 1,000 people, down from 10.2 a year earlier and the lowest rate since 1977, when it was 9.9. 
The all-time high marriage rate occurred in the boom im­mediately following the return of the soldiers after World War II, when 16.4 marriages per 1,000 people were recorded in 1946. The bottom was in 1932 at 7.9.

Individual identity absent from campus 
On my first day back at Notre Dame after a rather brief summer, my sister, her roommate and I ventured to the Huddle for pizza after an exhausting day of moving. At one point I noticed an oddly-dressed character sporting a perfectly ridiculous haircut and iras­cible blurted something to the effect of, "I wonder who's responsible for admit­ting jerks like him to this university." Had I not been so tired and cranky, I probably would have kept my mouth shut; but diplomacy was the least of my concerns, and, anyway, the jerk was out of earshot. 
Paul Newett 
just say 'nyet' 
My sister's friend tactfuHy repllea that she thought it was a good thing to have some diversity among the student body, that not everyone look and act so ''conservatively.'' Having precious little energy remaining to chew and swallow, let alone argue, I granted the point, resumed eating, and let the sub­ject change. 
A day or two later, I read in the pages of this exalted journal that, for the first time in the history of Notre Dame, ten percent of the freshman class was com­posed of minority students. It may be safely assumed that the administration encouraged a greater percentage of minorities in the class of 1991 at least partly for the sake of diversity. 
All of this presupposes that heterogeneity benefits the university and its members; indeed, by definition a university embraces all who wish to pursue higher knowledge and the truth. I do not dispute this at all. But it is utterly preposterous to suggest that we constitute a marvelously diverse stu­dent body, as most of us would probably contend. Quite to the contrary, our backgrounds, our reasons for being here, and our notions of success and happiness are so remarkably similar that any deviation from the norm looks very peculiar to us. We are incorrigible conformists. The surface appearances that do differ are meaningless; moral­ly, we are appallingly alike. 
Most of us are children of affluence, and not unjustifiably we would like to maintain our cushy existence, both for ourselves and for our own children. But we are not merely concerned about

wealth; we are poisonously preoc­cupied with it. Here we spend four years taking a smattering of courses that will ensure our sale to the highest bidder amond the might bastions of cor­porate America; the rest is pleasant irrelevance, a brief reprieve before our inevitable sacrifice at the altar of com­merce. 
Most of us, too, find our ultimately pointless elective courses enjoyable, for they attempt to satisfy our feeble desire for true knowledge and the answers to the eternal questions. But God forbid that we should be required to put forth great effort, or fall into the clenches of some neofacist professor who incomprehensibly has a lower opinion of our effort than we invariably do. This term has only just begun, but soon the halls of the university will resonate with the incessant petulant whining of wronged geniuses. If the Al­mighty is indeed in His heaven, the in­violate sanctity of the grade point average will be preserved. 
And if all goes well, as it usually does, then we shall end our little holiday upon receiving a nice, pretty piece of paper to frame and hang on the wall to remind us of those halcyon days before we wal­lowed in the nasty business of stepping on people five days a week. But a delusory memento it will be, leading us to think that we were once vibrant members of a university, when in fact we were merely attending a finishing school for automatons. 
So it matters not a whit how many characters like the poor chap in the Huddle are allowed free rein of "self­expression" thanks to our silly egalitarianism. The thirst for diversity induces us to laud a misguided iconoclast who has embraced a very superficial form of nonconformity for its own sake. But this bizarre-looking fellow is really no different from the rest of us. Mter he gets his pretty piece of paper, he will ditch the screwy hair­cut, dress like a normal person again, give his execrable albums to his kid brother, and march ingloriously in step with the rest of humanity to the beat of the bottom line. Nowhere in the history of civilization is it recorded that the moral improvement of society was brought about by the proliferation of poor taste. 
And what of the unprecedented ten percent of this year's freshman class mentioned above? Can they help us

Foreign policy needs Congress 
Dear Editor: 
In his editorial of August 31, 1987, Mr. Kevin Smant states that "~ ..Congressional involvement in foreign affairs is not new." If Mr. Smant were to consult a copy of the Constitution of the United States of America, he would read that, while "The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy,"CArticle II, Section 2) only" The Congress shall have Power .... To declare war... (and)To make rules for the Gov­ernment and Regulation of the Land and Naval Forces." (Article I, Section 8) 
No, Congressional involvement in foreign affairs goes back a long way. If General George Washington could live by the Constitution, why can't Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North? 
cure our pernicious ills? Contrary to prevailing wisdon, the answer is very much in doubt. Many of them, happily, will be accepted by the majority but sadly assimilated into the decadence of our generation. Others, unforgivably, will fall victim to the subtle racism that persists here as anywhere else. Wel­come them, but expect nothing wonder­ful. 
In the seventeenth century, Pascal wrote, "It is a monstrous thing to see one and the same heart at once so sensi­tive to minor things and so strangely insensitive to the greatest." Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose.

KATHY SCARBECK features writer 
A
s I watched a bus full of Austrian athletes pull in front of the CCE last July, I tightly clutched my 1500-page German dictionary and ques­tioned my earlier decision in choosing a summer rich in the idiosynchracies of the German language and based in South Bend instead of some beach somewhere. As Live-In Host for the Austrian delegation to the 1987 International Summer Special Olympic Games that were held here at Notre Dame, I was responsible for ten men­tally handicapped Austrian ath­letes and five of their coaches, and my duties started with greeting them all when they arrived on campus. 
My worst premonitions of incompetancy were realized when I boarded the team's bus and one of the athletes began talking to me. I could not un­derstand a word she was saying. It was going to be a long week and a half. 
After the athletes had been safely settled into Dillon Hall (Surprise--The dorms went co­ed for the duration of the games), most of the coaches decided, in typical Austrian style, to go out for a beer. Though these Europeans were a bit disgruntled about the un­availability of alcohol on campus, they quickly decided to make the best of the situa­tion and discovered the cozy confines of the Linebacker Lounge. 
By the next morning I was already coming to realize why these Olympians were called "special." My duties as Live-1 n Host included acting as a trans­latorfguide, living in the same dormitory with my team mem­bers, and eating meals with them. During that first break­fast together, I was politely asked by no less than four of the athletes if I had slept well. 
I began talking to Liesl, a 24-year-old athlete, who kept offering to walk back to the Coke dispenser to refill my glass. At the end of the meal, Liesl asked if I was finished, and then voluntarilly carried my tray to the conveyor belt. By the end of the day Liesl was calling me her "best friend" and asking me to write to her after she returned to Austria. 
A few days later Liesl literally gave me the shirt off her back. 

I was in her room and asked if all of the clothes hanging in 
the wardrobe were hers. She 
then took out a pretty jade 
green Benetton shirt and said 
that in addition to the team 
uniforms, this shirt was one of 
the few articles of clothing 
she'd brought with her. Lies! 
then said, quite matter-of­
factly. that she was giving the 
green shirt to me. I tried to 
protest, but she cut me short 
by saying I couldn't return a 
gift. She was right; I couldn't. 
Such wonderfully simple 
generosity was impossible to 
turn down. 
I saw the compassion the athletes had for one another. After one Austrian swimmer had won a gold medal, every­one else on the team congrat­ulated him, even another swim­mer who had placed fourth. 
One competitor in our group never received a medal. "I would have liked to have won a medal," he said, "but I didn't. I can't change that, so I'll have to accept it." 
I think what really got to me the most was when I heard Liesl say that she was so "ubergluc~lich," a word which can only be translated as "overly happy." 
The nine days weren't all fun and games, though. There were low points, such as the weather. 90 degrees plus is never pleasant, but add to 90 percent humidity, dorms with no air conditioning, and ath­letes with health problems, and you'll wonder why these games were ever allowed to take place in the middle of a sultry South Bend summer. 
The Opening Ceremonies, pared down to a polished two­hour ABC production, actually lasted a total of six hours, in­cluding the two hours some athletes had to stand waiting for the rest of the participants to assemble in the Notre Dame Stadium. 
I also found myself wonder­ing why the athletes got the worst seats in the stadium. After all, the ceremonies were for them, weren't they? Try ex­plaining this to a group sitting in the end zone, one hundred yards from the stage and tucked behind ABC's mammoth camera platforms. 
Isn't it curious that Austrian body builderhictor Arnold Scwarzenegger found enough time to host the nationally televised Opening Ceremonies as well as greet the Austrian team on camera, but had to cancel a weightlifting clinic he was to give for the athletes the ­next day? 
When the team boarded the bus to leave campus at the end of nine tong, tiring days, I felt both saddness and a touch of relief. I couldn't believe that I had grown so close to so many people so quickly; I felt as if I had known these Austrians for years. 
Never having worked with the mentally handicapped, I had been expecting ten minimally functioning individuals, but what I found were ten selfless, loving, and courageous com­petitors who showed me just how "special" they really were.

AL roundup 
Tigers beat Tribe on one hit 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -Tom Candiotti pitched 7 2-3 no-hit innings until Matt Nokes singled for Detroit's only hit We~nesday night, but the Tigers beat the Cleveland Indians 2-1. -
Candiotti hurt himself with his own wildness, walking seven and making a wild pick­off throw. A walk and first baseman Joe Carter's error led to a run in the fifth inning, and a walk and Nokes' single made it 2-0 in the eighth. 
With Cleveland trailing in the eighth, Candiotti could have been within one out of pitching a no-hitter. But Nokes lined a clean single over second baseman Tommy Hinzo's head to score pinch runner Jim Walewander, who entered after a leadoff walk to Darrell Evans. 
Candiotti, a knuckleballer, fell to 7-14. One of the victories was a one-hitter against New York on Aug. 1, when Candiotti held the Yankees hitless for seven innings. Candiotti struck out seven. 

Jack Morris, 16-7, gave up five hits for the victory. 
Blue Jays 7, Angels 6 
TORONTO -George Bell hit a two-run opposite field homer in the eighth inning to snap a 5-5 tie and lift the Toronto Blue Jays to a 7-6 victory over the California Angels Wednesday. 
Bell's homer, his American League-leading 42nd, came off a 3-0 pitch from DeWayne Buice, 5-6, and offset a two-run homer by California's George Hendrick in the top of the in­ning that had tied the score 5-5. 
White Sox 5, Rangers 0 CHICAGO-Greg Walker hit a three-run homer and Dave LaPoint combined with Bobby Thigpen on a five-hitter Wed­nesday night as the Chicago White Sox beat the Texas Rang­ers 5-0. LaPoint, 3-2, gave up four hits in seven innings. He struck 
out three and walked one. Thig­pen relieved to start the eighth and allowed a single to Ruben 
Sierra, who had three hits. 
Walker's 24th homer capped a four-run sixth inning. Fred Manrique and Jerry Hairston singled with one out off Paul Kilgus, 2-6, and Ivan Calderon had an RBI single. 
Mariners 8, Orioles 6 
BALTIMORE Mickey Brantley drove in three runs with a pair of doubles and Dave Valle had two RBI singles Wed­nesday night, leading the Seattle Mariners over the Bal­timore Orioles 8-6. 
Yankees 3, Athletics 2 
NEW YORK-Jerry Royster singled home the winning run in the lOth inning after Mickey Tettleton's passed ball allowed Don Mattingly to reach base.

''This might sound as bit cocky," said Grace, "but I feel sorry for Drake having to come here to play us. We'll be hungry and ready for a big win. I'll be disappointed if we're not. Hopefully, we'll have a nice crowd and we'll gain some mo­

Pascual Perez, 1-0, won his first major-league game since July 14, 1985. He left in the seventh with runners at second and third and none out. Perez, the former Atlanta pitcher who was out of baseball last year, allowed six hits and three runs in six-plus innings.

Astros' chances of repeating as 
National League Western Divi­
sion champions, Manager Hal 
Lanier says. 
Hatcher, one of the few Astros who has hit consistently all season, was ejected in the fourth inning of Tuesday_ night's 3-2loss to Chicago after his bat split in two, revealing it had been corked. 
Umpire crew chief John 
McSherry said the bat con­
tained 3-4 inches of cork and 
had been sent to the league of­
fice. Katy Feeney, the league's 
spokeswoman, said it would be 
several days before a decision 
could be made on suspension. 
"I have to stand up for him because the bat wasn't even his," Lanier said. "I'd hate to be without a player of his caliber for any length of time at this stage of the pennant race." 
Hatcher is hitting .311, ranks fourth in the NL with 149 hits. 
and 57 
Tuesday night's loss was Houston's seventh in a row, dropping the Astros farther be­hind division leading San Francisco. 
Hatcher said all of his regu­lar bats were broken, so he un­wittingly grabbed the corked bat in Tuesday's loss. 
Lanier backed Hatcher's story. 
"Putting cork in a bat is not going to help a Billy Hatcher at all because of the kind of hit­ter he is," Lanier said. 
"That is one of the bats our pitchers use to play their silly little games to see how far they can hit the ball in batting prac­
. tice. 
"It just happened to be the same model of bat Billy uses and he was out of bats, so he picked it up." 
The incident occurred at a time when the league is looking into the possibility that some batters have loaded their bats with cork or shredded rubber to add distance to their drives. 
gained his 25th save .. 
It was the second straight win for the Reds, who had dropped nine of their previous 11 contests. By winning, third­place Cincinnati moved five games behind first-place San Francisco in the National League West. 
HOUSTON -Kevin Bass be­came the first National League player ever to hit home runs from both sides of the plate in a game twice in the same season as the Houston Astros snapped a seven-game losing streak with a 10-1 win over the Chicago Cubs Wednesday night.

NFL brings back old clock 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -NFL owners bowed to pressure from coaches Wednesday and scrapped the experimental 40­second clock, reinstating the old 30-second clock for the reg­ular season and playoffs. 
In a vote taken by computer­ized teletype, 13 teams voted to retain the clock and 15 voted

control in the huddle. I've got to be a leader--after bad plays and things like that. Everybody's got to keep their heads up." 
Last year's season opener is 
one that will stick in the minds 
of a lot of people for a lot of 
reasons. 
For some, the 24-23 Michigan triumph in Notre Dame Stadium was a game Notre Dame really won. Replays clearly showed that tight end Joel Williams landed inbounds with the potentia.I game­winning touchdown even though an official said other­wise. 
For others, the Irish defeat 
was a case of veteran 
placekicker John Carney not 
coming through under pres­
sure, as his 45-yard field-goal 
attempt in the game's waning 
seconds fell wide left and short. 
In any case, another tough Notre Dame schedule in 1987 should mean at least a few more of those nail-biters. 
Under the old rule, which will be back in use for the final week of the exhibition season, teams had 30 seconds to snap the ball after the referee signalled it ready for play. 
Proponents of the 40-second clock, led by Tex Schramm of the Dallas Cowboys, argued that not only did it speed up the games but that they seemed better paced. 
against it. Under NFL by-laws, any new rule must be approved by 21 of the 28 teams. 
Under the experiment, ap­proved by the owners last spring, the 40-second clock was started as soon as the whistle blew to end the previous play. After timeouts, teams had 25 seconds to put the ball into play. 
Are the Irish ready for those games? Last year all but one of the tight contests slipped away. 
"I think our players learned what it takes to compete week in and week out against the schedule we play,'' Holtz said. "I hope the USC game (a 38-37 Irish comeback victory in the last game of the season) proved to them what it takes to win the 
close  games  against  good  
teams."  
Yes,  the  returning  Irish  

players have been there before. 
But the key to winning the close ones is often a good kick­ing game. And as of now, the Notre Dame kickers have not seen anything close to that kind of pressure. 
Senior punter Vince Phelan replaces Dan Sorensen as the Irish punter. The walk-on punted once all last year, a 33­yarder against Penn State. 
Kicking field goals likely will be either senior walk-on Ted Gradel or freshman Billy Hackett. 
Neither has ever attempted a field goal in a college game. Gradel made good on two extra points in the SMU game last year. Hackett has been suffer­ing from a groin injury this fall and resumed kicking last week. 
Junior walk-on Reggie Ho is also in the race at the placekicker position. 
"You just can't come close to simulating the pressure of kicking in front of 106,000 people," Holtz said. "We'll just have to wait and see. Phelan has done some awfully good things in practice." ·­
In preparation for the opening game, Holtz began holding practice on the astroturf of Cartier Field on Wednesday. 
In addition, some of the Irish reserves (the prep team) are wearing the numbers of Mic­higan starters and running Wolverine plays against the Irish first teams. 
"You never know how they're going to play on the turf in front of 106,000 people," Holtz said. "They've been doing well on grass (scrimmages) in front of 54,000 no-shows.'' 
The last scrimmage of the season is slated for Friday af­ternoon in Notre Dame Stadium, and is completely closed.

Notre Dame gets away with w1n 

By PETE SKIKO Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame soccer team opened its season at Loyola on Tuesday, narrowly escaping in overtime by the score of 2-1. The outcome was a little too narrow for Irish Head Coach Dennis Grace. 
"Hey, we'll take the win," said Grace, in his fourth year as the Irish mentor, "but we'll certainly have to play with bet­ter intensity than that if we're going to compete this year. We quite easily could have been up by two or three goals by the time we got our first goal, and we let down after we did score." 
The win came by virtue of freshman Steve LaVigne's goal seven minutes into the extra session on a nice feed from junior Randy Morriss. Morriss opened the scoring at the 22 minute mark with the assist going Bruce "Tiger" McCourt, the 12th leading scorer in Notre Dame history. Loyola tallied early in the second period to tie the game, and that's the way it stayed until LaVigne fired home the game winner. 
To Grace, however, the win was but consolation for his squad's relatively lackluster performance. 
"In competitive soccer, teams are most vulnerable to a letdown right after they score or right after they are scored upon," explained Grace. "We definitely eased up after we got the early score. Essentially, we sat back, watched the game, and hoped they (Loyola) wouldn't score. You can't do that and expect to win against

Grace realizes, however, that it is early in the season and that he played the limit of 18 players during the course of the game, many of them freshmen. 
"Not only did I play 18, but all18 were in by halftime,'' said

One of the Notre Dame second-string linemen was hum­

to be humming, either. 
Marty Strasen 
Football Notebook 

In front of some 106,000 people at Michigan Stadium next Saturday afternoon, 11 hungry Wolverine defenders will be lining up to take their shots at Andrysiak, a quar­terback with a lot of weight on his relatively untested shoulders. 
"The consistency of Terry Andrysiak will go a long way toward determining whether or not we're going to have a successful year," Holtz said. "He's shown good control of the offense so far (this fall). There are still a few things to work on and sharpen up, but he has established himself as our number-one quarterback." 
The senior started one game last season and one during his sophomore year, and has completed 52 of his 91 career passes. 
And although Michigan Stadium is not the friendliest of places to begin a tenure as Notre Dame's number-one quarterback, Andrysiak has an interesting outlook on the welcoming he will receive nine days from now. 
"I'm really looking forward to it," he said. "The pres­sure of playing there might get me away from the pressure of playing for Coach Holtz in practice day in and day out. They really pick you to death around here." 
But the keen eye Holtz has been keeping on his top signal-caller seems to be paying off. Andrysiak has been solid in both fall scrimmages so far, completing most of his passes and running the option well. 
"It's really hard to tell how much better you're getting when they're always after you to keep at it," Andrysiak said. "But I feel confident. 
"The big thing for me right now is keeping things under

Secondary looks to hit hard 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
If Irish strong safety George Streeter has his way, Notre Dame's opponents will be using a lot of ice and tape after 60 minutes with the Irish. 
"Except for the (Chicago) Bears," said Streeter, "I don't think any team in football will hit harder than Notre Dame this season." 
With only nine days before the Irish open against Mic­higan, defensive secondary coach Terry Forbes is readying his troops for the rigors of an­other top-notch schedule. Despite losing cornerback Troy Wilson and free safety Steve Lawrence to graduation last May, Forbes looks for good things from the defensive backs this fall. 
"We'll have a different crew out there this season,'' said Forbes, " but they are playing well together and they have come to understand the system very well in the past year. 
"To play defensive back, you have to know what to do, have the physical ability to do it, and maintain concentration on your job. We know what we have to do and have the physi­cal ability. Our concentration has been good, but we have to keep working harder on that aspect of our game.'' 
Streeter will be returning to the strong safety position that he earned midway through the 1986 campaign after Brandy Wells' knee injury. Streeter's 44 tackles last fall is tops among returning defensive backs. Battling Streeter for the starting spot at strong safety has been junior Pat Eilers, a transfer from Yale who has 

Stan Smagala 
been impressive in spring and fall workouts. 
Holding down the top spot at free safety will be junior Corny Southall, who was named the most improved defensive back in spring drills. Southall switched to the secondary last fall after coming to playing tailback his freshman year. Senior Chris K vochak and sophomore David Jandric will back up Southall. 
One of the most improved players and toughest competi­tors among the secondary is sophomore Stan Smagala. Most of his appearances last fall were on special teams, but 
a strong spring put Smagala in 
the driver's seat at right cor­
nerback. 
Smagala is more than ready 
to get the season underway. 
"I can't wait to go out and 
have the chance to hit someone 
else besides my teammates," 
said Smagala. "Right now 
we're just hitting the same 
guys every day.'' 
"We ar-e very pleased with 
Stan and Corny," said Forbes. 
"They are both fairly new to 
their positions and have 
worked hard to learn what they 
need to. We expect some good 
things from both of them this 
year." 
At left cornerback, the Irish 
have two experienced seniors 
battling for the starting spot. 
Both Brandy Wells and Marv 
Spence saw a lot of action last 
fall and should do the same in 
the 1987 campaign. Wells took 
over the number-one spot from 
Spence last fall for the final two 
games of the season, and holds 
an edge at the moment to start . the Michigan game. 
Over the last few years, Notre Dame secondaries have played in the shadow of excep­tional Irish defensive line and linebacking squads. With added depth and a hard-hitting squad, this year's defensive backfield should leave its own mark on Irish fans, as well as Irish opponents.
