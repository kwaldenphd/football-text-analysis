Not only can they kick a 
field goal. serve an ace and 
win a race-they can grad­
uate. too. 
After finishing second last year, Notre Dame student­athletes earned top honors in the 2003 USA Today/NCAA Academic Achievement Awards, u distinction announced Sept. 2. 
Ninety-two percent of Notre Dame student-athletes who enrolled in 191)6 gradu­ated from the University, constituting the highest overall graduation rate among NCAA Division 1-A universities. For student­athletes who completed all four years of athletic eligibil­ity, the rate was even higher, at 1)9 percent. 
Tulsa University came in second by three percentage points, followed by Wisconsin and Duke at 88 percent each, Northwestern at 87 and Boston College at 
86. Hice won in 2002 with 91 percent. 
NCAA compilations of graduation rates are deter­mined by the raw percentage of student-athletes who entered a university and graduated within six years. Non-graduates include stu­dent athletes who transfer, join a professional organiza­tion or leave the university for various other reasons. 
Academic Achievement 
Awards are also granted to the universities that show the most improvement from the previous year, as well as to those who have the best student-athlete graduation rates in comparison to the entire undergraduate stu­dent body. This year, the University of Oklahoma won the first category with a 40 percent rate of improve­ment. Boise State University won the second with a 33 percent advantage for stu­dent-athletes as compared to the overall student body average. 
A $2.9 million grant from USA Today first made the prizes possible three years ago. The grant was the largest in NCAA history, and the top institution in each category receives $20,000. The prize money can be used for any purpose; past awards have been used to fund addi­tional scholarships, to sup­port existing programs and to finance new ones. 

A reception will be held at the USA Today headquarters in McL.ean, Va. to recognize the winners, which also include schools from Division 1-AA, Division 1-AAA, Division II and Division Ill. The ceremony will take place Nov. 7 and will feature presentations from NCAA president Myles Brand and USA Today publisher Craig Moon.

Police, was an attempt to cut down on large parties at Turtle Creek that might spill over into public areas. Officers from the Indiana State Excise Police, South Bend Police Department and the Notre Dame Security Police col­
laborated in the effort. 
Capt. John Williams, communi­
ty relations o!licer for the South 
Bend Police Department, said he 
did not have final numbers · regarding how many people 
received citations on Saturday, 
but he said there were at least 
five arrests. 
Mike Hussell, a junior in Zahm 
Hall, witnessed the bust, which 
he said included 15 to 20 police 
cars and two to three paddy wag­
ons. Russell said law enforcement 
officials patrolled the complex, 
going from apartment to apart­
ment, breaking up some parties 
and letting others continue. lie 
also said he saw six to seven 
excise police working undercover. 
Eric Tarnowski, also a Zahm 
Hall junior, said he.saw police 
officers tackling students and 
even stunning one student with a 
tazer as they attempted to Oee 
the scene. 
"I was in the back alley and 
everyone was tailgating as 
usual." Tarnowski said. 'Then, all of a sudden, a bunch of cop cars rolled up. It really kind of killed the atmosphere there." 
Tarnowski said several stu­dents -mostly minors -were lined up and handcu!l"ed by police o!licers. 
Police did not bother those over 21 years of age, Tarnowski said. He said he saw tailgaters of legal drinking age taunting the police, who did not react.. 
Tarnsowski, who has been to Turtle Creek on football week­ends in past seasons, added that the apartment complex seemed to have a much more intense party atmosphere this year than in years past. 
lie said he thinks the new University alcollol policy and tail­gating rules have contributed to the bigger off-campus party scene. 
"They drove most of the stu­dents off [campus] and now (with the bust] they're trying to drive us back on," he said.

Legends meets expectations 
ByWILLPUCKETT 
NewsWri[er 
With the arrival of football season, one of the newest estab­lishments on campus, Legends of Notre Dame, held its doors wide open to the Irish faithful, providing a concert/dance club on Friday night and a ga:me watch Saturday afternoon. 
When asked how the restau­rant/club did over the weekend, manager Larry Briggs said that expectations were met but declined to provide specific fig­ures. 
"I would say that it met our expectations, although we are certainly looking at evolving over the course of the year, football weekends and [non­football weekends]." Briggs said. 
According to Briggs, Legends will have to make sure that it can change and keep improving itself to meet the market, rather than relying merely on its prime location near the Stadium and advertising targeted at Notre Dame students and fans. 
"It was extremely busy. but we're evolving every day and kind of running it as we go," Briggs said. "We'll see what works in the market and go from there." 
Briggs also said the restau­rant would grow into its own over time. The restaurant was doing a lot of business, but there are still areas that staff and management need to look at for continued improvement. 
"There's ... a big learning curve, but with having the staff better trained, being able to better handle crowds and the like, we will continue to improve," Briggs said. 
Program coordinator Jonathan Jorissen expressed many of the same views, while at the same time noting the large numbers that came to Legends for various reasons. 
"We had a lot of people come through-a lot of alumni want­ing to check out the new place -and were very busy al! day Friday," Jorissen said. "We had a great turnout, as well, to watch the game." 
Jorissen did leave room for improvement, however, noting at least one event that was not as well-attended as organizers might have hoped. 
Changes will happen in the programming, as well as in the restaurant, on the planning level, Jorissen said. 
"We weren't at max capacity for the band Friday night, and we're working on the logistics of programming on football weekends. We're looking at some different options," Jorissen said. "One of those is having a classic Notre Dame 

football game watch on  Friday  
afternoons."  
Despite  having,  to  some  

extent, less-than-perfect results, the staff of Legends is happy with the way things are going and hope to continue to improve. In fact, evolving and improving to become even bet­ter is one of the central ideas of the restaurant/club right now, the staff said. 
"We're excited. Everything went very smoothly, and we were very pleased. Hopefully, over time, more people will become aware that Legends exists, [and we will] improve our programming, and Legends will be even better," Jorissen said.

INSIDE COLUMN 

The bells dishrrb sleep 
Exhausted from the jubilation 
that was Saturday's football_ victory, 
I returned to my bed in Sorin in 
order to reenergize for the night 
that lay ahead. 
But my nap Erik Powers 
intruded upon 
my visions of a 

vibrant nightlife. Sports Writer ·My eyelids mis­
counted my hour 
or two of slumber. Instead of awak­
ing to the sounds of witty inebriated 
banter from the hall, I was stirred 
by the bells of the Bascillica. Bells 
that rang four minutes before nine 
on a Sunday morning. 
Realizing that I had unintention­
ally stumbled into transition 
Sunday, I attempted to roll over and 
take refuge in sleep. But the bells 
would not end. Chimes rung at 
every quarter hour with varying 
ambition. At 9:15 there were but 
four strikes upon the bell. At 9:30 
there was a humble concerto fea­
turing subdued syncopation. At 
9:45, a subdued rendition of the 
alma mater praised thee Notre 
Dame. And at 10:00 a full-fledged 
dual hour opus erupted from the 
bowels of the Basillica, 1,842 bells 
of percussion banging brutal bed­
lam out of the tower and thrusting 
it upon the unwilling audience of 
Sorin Hall. 
Last year, I heard not one of the 
Basillica's bells. I lived on the oppo­
site side of the dorm under the 
Quint. Social lubricants trickled 
down from above, sophomores 
dropped weights from their couch 
at 3 a.m. and drywall fell as a type 
of periodic precipitation, yet none 
of these activities inhibited my 
slumber. Now, I am bombarded by 
music at all hours. The hall choir 
practices in the chapel directly 
above. So do a number of aspiring 
piano players. I was awoken yester­
day by an industrious hallmate 
playing Gershwin at nine in the 
morning. He (or another member of 
his liturgical legion) returned at 
four to perfect Piano Man during 
my nap. He likely lurks in the 
chapel now, plotting for a midnight 
moonlight sonata. 
But how does one resolve this 
conflict? From a utilitarian stand­
point, all would be best served if I 
quieted my qualms and accepted 
the life of an insomnias. However, 
there is still hope. The wise and 
sympathetic leaders of the 
University may realize that our 
campus does not need inaccurate 
and gratuitously melodic time. Or 
perhaps this rambling letter of dis­
content might facilitate a trade of 
clocks between the Basillica and 
O'Shag. 11:25 is my favorite time of 
the day, day or night, and the clock 
always reminds me of the clocktow­
er from Back to the Future, and 
how Marty McFly's girlfriend was so 
much hotter in the first movie than 
the second and third, and how I 
can't believe anyone could make 
such a casting oversight. Otherwise, 
we could always give the bells to 
Saint Mary's. They deserve repara­
tions for something by now.

Dope-seeking teens call cop by mistake 
AUSTIN. Minn. -Two teens accused of search­ing for a marijuana dealer dialed the ultimate wro~g number -they called the Mower County Sheriff's cell phone. 
Sheriff Terese Amazi's cell phone rang around noon on Friday. The caller said she wanted a bag of marijuana. After Amazi said she was the sheriff, the caller said, ''I'm sorry," and hung up. 
A few minutes later, the phone rang again. This time, Amazi let a deputy answer. 
The caller again asked for a bag of marijuana, and the deputy -who called himself "Dupe" on the phone -arranged for a meeting at a conven­ience store an hour later. 
"Apparently, they didn't know the meaning of 'Dupe' as in 'duped' either," Amazi said. "It's incredible."

CAMPUS LIFE COUNCIL 



CLC debates RA orientation policies 
By MIKE CHAMBLISS 
News Writer 
The Campus Life Council (CLC), a Board of Trustees­mandated committee that advises the Office of Student Affairs, met Monday for an unofficial, preliminary meet­ing. 
The 18-member council of students, faculty and adminis­trators discussed various issues that it may take up as the foci of the three task forces that will work toward specific goals over the course of the year. 
These issues include privi­leges for on-campus seniors, decreasing the cost of SYR's, the status of leadership on campus, gender relations, campus safety, exploration of dining hall options and decreasing the costs associat­ed with the student-used vehi­cles at the Center for Social Concerns. 
With recent controversial RA dismissals in mind, Student Body President Pat Hallahan introduced the idea of investi­gating current policies and attempting to increase flexibil­ity in the HA training program. A heated debate ensued when a number of council members objected to spending council time on an employee-employer issue that is traditionally beyond the scope of the CLC's concern. 

"As an employer, I have cer­tain expectations of my employees, and no one is going to tell me how to hire people. I just think it's a waste of our time to pursue this issue," said George Moss, assistant vice president of Student Affairs. 
It was also pointed out numerous times that the coun­cil could not discuss the specifics of any individual dis­missal case because federal law prohibits the University from divulging related infor­mation, 
Some of the council mem­bers grew frustrated when a proposal to investigate a seem­ingly important issue failed to generate unanimous support. 
"As soon as we get a hot issue that students care about, we get put down. We get our agenda dictated by a minority of people," said Hallahan. 
The issue of deciding task force goals will be settled dur­ing the Sept. 22 meeting.

Auto club goes to trial for negligence 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -In the summer of 1999. AAA got a call about a young woman whose car had broken down in a parking lot on Cape Cod. The auto club told the woman's stepfather it would send help. 
Melissa Gosule never made it home that night. 
Her body was found in a shal­low grave eight days later. She had been raped and stabbed to death. 
Gosule's family sued AAA for unspecified damages, claiming that ifthe auto club had done its job that night, she would be alive today. Jury selection began Monday in state court in Plymouth, south of Boston, in the negligence and wrongful­death case. 
The case is being watched closely because it is the first time AAA has been sued in the death of a motorist who was killed after seeking assistance from the auto club. legal experts said. 
Every year, the American Automobile Association, with a dues-paying membership of more than 46 million in the United States and Canada, gets about 30 million calls from motorists who need help with dead batteries, flat tires and other roadside problems. 
In their lawsuit, Gosule's par­ents, Leslie Gosule and Sandra Glaser, and her stepfather, Peter Glaser, claim AAA left Gosule stranded and forced to turn to a stranger for help. That stranger, Michael Gentile, killed her. 
"AAA is not who they say they are," Leslie Gosule said recently in a statement. "Had AAA done what they tell the world they do and what they said they were going to do -provide reliable and reasonable emergency roadside assistance that night ­Melissa would still be with us." 
Gosule's parents note that AAA, in its marketing materials, touts the peace of mind it pro­vides to motorists in trouble. "One call to AAA and your wor­ries are over," reads one brochure. AAA also refers to itself as "family" and warns against depending on strangers: "In today's world, relying on strangers has become a scary [and sometimes dangerous] thing to do." 
The lawsuit names national AAA; its local affiliate, AAA Southern New England; and the tow truck driver. 
AAA disputes the family's claims that it did not offer Gosule help, and says it should not be held responsible for her death. Gentile, a newspaper delivery man with a long crimi­nal record, was convicted of her murder and is now serving a life sentence. 
On July 11, 1999, Gosule, a 
27 -year-old elementary school 
teacher, had returned at 5:30 
p.m. from a bike ride at a park in Bourne to find that her 1986 Pontiac would not start. 
It was about that time that she 
met Gentile, according to testi­
mony during Gentile's trial in 
2000. 
Gosule used Gentile's cell 
phone to call her mother and 
stepfather, who told her he 
would call AAA for help. Gosule 
was not a member of AAA, but 
her stepfather was, and it is 
routine for the auto club to help 
out relatives of AAA members. 
In their lawsuit, Gosule's fami­ly says her stepfather immedi­ately called the AAA's 24-hour emergency roadside assistance number and asked that the car and Gosule be taken to a garage in Boston. John Cubellis, a tow truck driver whose company is an agent for AAA, arrived at the parking lot about 90 minutes later. 

According to both sides, Cubellis told Gosule he was busy and it would be three to four hours before he could take her or her car to Boston, about 60 miles away. The Gosule family says Cubellis did not try to start the young woman's car, make sure she was taken to a safe location or call another AAA driver to help. 
Gosule then accepted a ride from Gentile. 
In court papers, AAA says Cubellis had no reason to believe Gosule was in danger. She was in a busy parking lot at the Sagamore Rotary with restaurants, a gas station and a fire station nearby. When he pulled into the parking lot, he saw Gosule talking and sharing a cell phone with two men ­Gentile and a mechanic friend Gentile had called to look at the woman's car. 
AAA says Gosule could have taken a taxi or had a family member come pick her up. 
In a statement, a spokesman for AAA Southern New England called Gosule's death a "terrible tragedy." 
"Our hearts go out to Melissa Gosule's family and friends," said Robert Murray. "In our his­tory, we have never seen a case like this. We believe the auto club will be properly and com­pletely exonerated." 
Paul Martinek, editor in chief of Lawyers Weekly USA, a national legal newspaper, said the lawsuit was initially consid­ered a long shot, but some of the claims could resonate with a jury. 
"Proving that this was a fore­seeable danger is a huge chal­lenge -that AAA could have foreseen that a motorist would have accepted a ride from a total stranger and then be killed by that total stranger," Martinek said.

Arab League grants Council seat 
CAIHO, Egypt-The Arab League unani­mously granted the U.S.-appointed Iraqi Governing Council the Baghdad seat on the pan-Arab body early Tuesgay -delivering a major boost to the Bush administration's post-war occupation. 
The decision ended weeks of debate within the 22-member League over whether to rec­ognize Iraq's interim authority, with oppo­rwnts fearing that acceptance of the interim Iraqi authority could be seen as a sign of support for the American invasion. 
The council was appointed July 13 after 
U.S. forces deposed Saddam Hussein's regime as an authority able to represent Iraq on the regional stage. 
Arab League foreign ministers issued a communique after their debate, saying the Governing Council had been granted Iraq's seat until a legitimate Iraqi government is formed and a new constitution drawn up. 
WW 11-era bombs found in China 
BEIJING-Construction workers digging a drainage ditch have unearthed dozens of World War 11-era Japanese bombs in an east­ern Chinese city, authorities said Monday, the latest development in a saga of old enmities that still resonate today. 
The 80 bombs turned up last Wednesday at the construction site in lleze, a city in the eastern Chinese province of Shandong. They "have been left by Japanese invaders during World War II," the official Xinhua News Agency concluded, citing Japanese writing still visible on the explosives. 
The rusty explosives are apparently con­ventional, not chemical, weapons, authorities said. But they are conducting tests to make sure.

Finance reform law before Court 
WASIIINGTON -In a rare and lengthy special session, the Supreme Court consid­ered Monday whether a vast rewrite of the nation's laws governing money in politics unconstitutionally muzzles politicians, their supporters and opponents.

CHICAGO -Indiana Gov. Frank O'Bannon suffered a massive stroke in his Chicago hotel room Monday and was in critical condition following sur­gery. 
The doctor who operated on the governor refused to speculate on O'Bannon's chances for recovery. 
"We're hoping he's going to recover function. How much, we don't know," said neurosurgeon Wesley Yapor. 
O'Bannon, a Democrat in his second term, was found Monday morning after a sta!T member called hotel security to say the governor had missed a morning meeting and was not answering his phone, said Northwestern Memorial Hospital spokes­woman Kelly Sullivan. 
Yapor said surgeons removed blood from both sides of O'Bannon's brain. The doctor said some of the blood probably came from an injury, suggesting that the governor fell after becoming ill. 
Yapor said O'Bannon, 73, was in a drug-induced coma and on a ventilator.

Annan plans m.eeting on future of Iraq 
Associated Press 
UNITED NATIONS -Secretary­General Kofi Annan launched a high-level diplomatic offensive Monday to get feuding nations to unite behind a plan to stabilize Iraq, and said the United Nations is pre­pared to play a major political role to quickly restore its sovereignty. 
Annan met late Monday with ambassadors from the Security Council and planned to meet Saturday in Geneva with foreign ministers from the five veto-wield­ing council nations -the United States. Russia, China. Britain and France. 
He said he also has been talking to officials in many countries and plans to engage Mideast leaders and Iraq's neighbors. 
"The discussions are at early stages yet," he said, "But my own sense is that Iraq is of such impor­tance that all of us will have to find a way of working together to stabi­lize Iraq." 
The Security Council is starting to debate a U.S.-proposed draft resolu­tion to get more peacekeeping troops and money into Iraq, but it faces tough opposition led by France and Germany. 
It would authorize a multinational force to replace the current U.S.-led force, but the United States would command the force and continue to run the civilian administration. France and Germany, which opposed the war on Iraq, are lead­ing demands for the quick restora­tion of Iraq's sovereignty and a larg­er U.N. role. 
U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte, who confirmed that Secretary of State Colin Powell would attend Saturday's meeting in Geneva, said the United States is waiting for suggested changes ­particularly from the four other per­manent members. 
The United States incorporated "a lot of ideas that have been given to us by other countries," he stressed, and "we think it's a constructive and important resolution." 


AFGHANISTAN 
Attacks leave five Afghan troops dead 
Associated Press 
KANDAHAR. Afghanistan­Suspected Taliban insurgents killed five Afghan government soldiers and wounded two U.S. soldiers in attacks in the south and east of Afghanistan, Afghan and U.S. military offi­cials said Monday. 
The attacks in three provinces highlighted the security challenge in America's other war. The top 
U.S. 
commander in Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. John Vines. warned Sunday that Taliban fighters, paid and trained by al-Qaida, were pouring into the country from neighboring Pakistan -a key 

U.S. 
ally in the war on terror. 


In Afghanistan's southern Kandahar province, the heart­land of the hardline Taliban regime before its ouster by U.S.-led forces in late 2001, insurgents late Sunday ambushed a pickup truck car­rying Afghan soldiers through a mountain gorge. 
Five soldiers were killed and five wounded, said Haji Granai, a military commander in the provincial capital, which lies about 25 miles south of where the attack hap­pened in Shah Wali Kot dis­trict. 
No group claimed responsi­bility, but Granai blamed the Taliban and said authorities arrested and were questioning 13 men with suspected links to the group. 
Three weeks ago, hundreds of Afghan government troops 
were sent to the same area, looking for Taliban remnants, he said. "This is a mountain­ous area. Taliban are hiding there." 
Shah Wali Kot is 85 miles southwest of the Dai Chupan mountains, the scene of intense fighting this month between U.S.-led coalition forces and Taliban. More than 100 Taliban were reported· killed in about nine days of ground fighting and bombing in the rugged region of Zabul province. One U.S. special operations soldier and an unknown number of Afghan soldiers also died. 
Meanwhile, two American soldiers were wounded Sunday as the coalition pressed the hunt for Taliban and al-Qaida fighters in east­ern Afghanistan. Both soldiers were evacuated to Bagram Air Base, coalition headquarters north of Kabul, for treatment. Neither was identified. 
One of the soldiers suffered a gunshot wound to his right leg during a firelight with five insurgents near a coalition base at Shkin in Paktika province, said Col. Rodney Davis, the U.S. military spokesman in Afghanistan. The insurgents retreated with no reported casualties, he said in a statement. 
The other soldier was shot in the right forearm in a clash near the coalition base at Bari Kowt in Kunar province, Davis said, adding there was no damage to coalition equip­mimt or report of enemy casu­alties. 


Approval likely for Bush's plan 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Republicans and Democrats predicted Monday that Congress will approve the $87 billion President Bush wants for Iraq and Afghanistan, but many said they would demand more details on administration policy in both countries. 
With relentless American casualties, a paucity of allied support and a realization that the administration underesti­mated the operation's price tag, lawmakers seem embold­ened to play a stronger role in shaping the measure than they did when they quickly approved an initial $79 billion package in April. 
Democrats juxtaposed the proposal with Bush's opposi­tion to added funds for American schools and other domestic programs. They also voiced doubt that even $87 bil­lion -nearly triple the Homeland Security Department's total budget ­would be enough. 
"Already facing a nearly half-trillion-dollar deficit, American taxpayers deserve to know how this spending will affect our ability to address the unmet needs in our own country," said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. 
"This may not be Vietnam, but boy it sure smells like it," Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said on the Senate floor. "And every time I see these bills coming down for the money, it's costing like Vietnam. too." 
Other Democrats, such as Sen.

IN BRIEF 
WorldCom close to settlement 
NEW YOHK-MCI was close to settling Monday with two groups of creditors that opposed a deal to repay just a fraction of the company's $41 billion debt, prompting a sur­prise adjournment as hearings began on a plan to emerge from bankruptcy. 
A settlement could remove the last major obstacle that the company formerly known as WorldCom faces in persuading a bankruptcy court to approve the long-distance carrier's financial reorganization after a ruinous accounting scandal. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez said the talks between MCI and two groups holding close to $1 billion in combined claims against the company appeared to be showing enough progress to allow the parties another day to negotiate. 
Probe denied in Stewart case 
NEW YORK -A federal judge said Monday she saw no indication of a breach of grand jury secrecy in the Martha Stewart case, rejecting defense demands that the govern­ment investigate the source of pre-indictment leaks. 
U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum said she found it difficult to understand how lawyers for the home deco­rating maven believed their client might have been prejudiced if someone had leaked the fact that the indictment would not include a charge of insider trading. 
The lawyers said the leaks violated federal rules that make grand jury proceedings confi­dential, and might have influenced grand jurors before they handed up the indictment against Stewart and her ex-stockbroker, Peter Bacanovic. 




TV Guide revamped to boost sales 
LOS ANGELES -A redesigned TV Guide magazine hit the stands Monday as the pub­lisher of the 50-year-old title struggles to revive the neglected brand. 
The magazine carries a new logo, an expanded movie guide on salmon-colored paper, shorter articles, more viewing recom­mendations and easier to read prime-time channel listing grids. 
The magazine also has a new slogan: "We see everything." 
The circulation of TV Guide has fallen dra­matically. from more than 19 million in the 1970s to about 9 million today. 
The company will spend $10 million to mar­ket TV Guide with the goal of adding 750,000 new subscribers by the end of the year. 

Media merger wins FCC approval

La-wsuits filed against music sharers 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The music industry's largest trade group filed 261 copyright lawsuits across the country Monday against Internet users who trade songs online, an aggressive campaign to discourage piracy through fears of expen­sive civil penalties or set­tlements. 
The Hecording Industry Association of America warned it ultimately may tile thousands of cases. Its first round was aimed at what it described as "major offenders" illegal­ly distributing on average more than 1 ,000 copy­righted music files each. 
"Some of my grandkids got in there," said Durwood Pickle, 71, of Hichardson, Texas, who said his son had explained the situation in an e-mail to the recording industry association. "I didn't do it, and I don't feel like I'm responsible. It's been stopped now, I guarantee you that." 
Pickle said his teen­aged grandchildren used his computer during visits to his home. 
''I'm not a computer­type person," Pickle said. "They come in and get on the computer. How do I get out of this? Dadgum it, got to get a lawyer on this." 
Another defendant, Lisa Schamis of New York, said her Internet provider warned her two months ago that record industry lawyers had asked for her name and address. but she said she had no idea she might be sued. She acknowledged download­ing "lots" of music over file-sharing networks. 
"This is ridiculous," said Schamis, 26. "People like me who did this, I didn't understand it was illegal." 
"I can understand why the music industry is upset about this, but the fact that we had access to this as the public, I don't think gives them the right to sue us. It's wrong on their part." said Schamis,

who added she is unem­ployed and would be unable to pay any large fine or settlement. 
An estimated 60 million Americans participate in file-sharing networks, using software that makes it simple for computer users to locate and retrieve for free virtually any song by any artist within moments. 
Internet users broadly acknowledge music-trad­ing is illegal, but the practice has flourished in recent years since copy­right statutes are among the most popularly flouted laws online. 
"Nobody likes playing the heavy," said RIAA President Cary Sherman, who compared illegal music downloads to shoplifting. "There comes a time when you have to stand up and take appro­priate action." 
Sen. Norm Coleman, R­Minn., has already prom­ised congressional hear­ings into how the music industry has identified and tracked the Internet users it's suing. 
"They have a legitimate interest that needs to be protected, but are they protecting it in a way that's too broad and over­reaching?" Coleman said. "I don't want to make criminals out of 60 mil­lion kids, even though kids and grandkids are doing things they should­n't be doing." 

The RIAA did not identi­fy for reporters which Internet users it was suing or where they live. Federal courthouses in 
New York, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Dallas and elsewhere reported receiving some lawsuits; court officials were assigning them to judges. 
"Get a lawyer," advised Fred von Lohmann, a lawyer for the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation. "There's no simpler advice than that, whether you intend to fight this or not. You'll need someone to advise you." 
With estimates that half of file-sharers are teenagers. all sides braced for the inevitable legal debate surrounding the financial damage to parents or grandparents, who the HIAA plans to hold responsible. 

Foreign workers keep U.S. cotnpetitive 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Curtailing immi­gration of skilled foreign profession­als to the United States will hurt U.S. global competitiveness. inhibit inno­vation and job growth and send high technology and research jobs to other countries. according to a study released Monday. 
The study says that while U.S. security must be protected, immigra­tion policies should encourage and ease the legal flow of high-and low­skilled workers to keep the country competitive in recruiting talented workers. 
The study was conducted by the American Immigration Law Foundation's Immigration Policy Center, a nonprofit organization that supports immigration. 
"America's strength lies in its openness," said Stuart Anderson, the study's author who recently left the now defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service policy plan­ner. 
Anderson said despite complaints that foreign workers are taking American jobs, statistics show that 
U.S. employers have not been ram­pantly hiring foreign workers who enter on H1-B visas for temporary workers with specialty occupations. 
Anderson's study found that I-!1-B hiring rises and falls with economic times, numbering 164,000 in 2001 and dropping to 79,100 in fiscal year 2002. 
The national H1-B worker cap of 195,000 a year is scheduled to be reduced to 65,000 a year on Oct. 1. 
Employer abuse of the program to find cheap labor also is not wide­spread, he said. 
In 2002, the Department of Labor found only seven willful violations or required removal from the program, even though the agency has increased investigations, Anderson said. 
The workers also help provide money for training Americans for high tech or engineering jobs. 
A critic of guest worker programs said rather than import foreign workers, job wages, benefits and conditions should be improved so more American workers are interest­ed in filling those jobs or researching in the fields currently filled by 111-B workers. 




Enjoying the non-traditional football traditions 
As I take time out of my busy senior schedule to reflect on this past week­end, and the banquet of Boca burgers and beer to which I was privy, it's easy to feel like I'm the luckiest man 
alive. Not to  
mention the  David Barrett

when I remember that it is the only way to ensure an expeditious recovery from multiple burns to the forearms. 
It was a grill accident resulting from a manual match-lighting at our Saturday morning tailgate. The igni­tion -auto-gauge-button-meter-thing wouldn't play nice, so we had to improvise. Or maybe it did in fact work, and we just prefer to do things manually instead. Manually and manly are pretty much one and the same. Either way, there is a penalty to pay for such rash, disorderly behav­ior. It's singed forearm hair, a terrible smelling downstairs to your apart­ment and eternal notoriety for being so dang manly. 
That wasn't all that went wrong on Saturday. The long dreamt-of tug o' war duel in our backyard never mate­rialized. Perhaps it was a result of poor party planning, or more proba­ble, because Lowes doesn't carry ropes that thick. 
Visions of long ago Field Days flashed before our eyes. We relived great tug o' war triumphs and lament­ed the equally great tug o' war defeats. Perhaps no other game, in the history of manly men, captured the masculine identity quite the way tug o' war did. We considered both the shotput and the pommelhorse, yet both lacked the simple appeal and practicality that thoughts of one rope and dozens of grunting men conjured up. 
Unable to locate an adequate rope, however, we settled for a somewhat tamer Saturday tailgate. 
There is something special about masses of people beating down your door at 8 a.m. demanding nourish­ment. There is even something kind of special about losing half of your glass­ware to thirsty freshmen who show little regard for personal property and feel no need to return family heir­looms that they pilfered from your kitchen cabinetry. Even if they are plastic, we want them back. 
Our living room was a certified sea of green by 10 a.m., as was every other apartment at Turtle Creek. It was nice to see police officers sending kids long also magical. The Notre Dame hot dogs are still good, maybe even better than they were last year. The condi­ment udders are still the coolest things any of us have ever seen and might ever hope to see. The half dol­lar pieces are still apparently in circu­lation, contrary to popular opinion. They might provide a shade of facility for the overwhelmed concession cashiers, but we still hate them. 
These are the little things that don't make it into the volumes dedicated to Notre Dame football, but they are the things I will personally miss most when I graduate in May.

In addition, the football team relived past glories on the sacred sod, squeaking one out against the overmatched Cougars. The September sun proved plenty hot for most at the game, turning us from the sea of green into the Red Sea. At the end of the game, only three questions remained: 
Would the fans once again bumrush the field? 
Would the field be able to withstand such a bumrush? 
Would the design for "The Shirt" ever change, and if it didn't, would people still continue to buy a new one each year? 
Ye of little faith who might have questioned the tenacity of the Fighting Irish, your concerns have now been answered. We are still tenacious, we are still magical, and we will relive the glory. We are living it, baby.

Make your education mean something 
"And when we allow freedom to ring. when we let it ring from every village and hamlet, from every state and city, we will be able to speed up that day when

Gentiles.

hands and to sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, 'Free at last. free at last; thank God Almighty, we are free at last."' 
Some 40 years ago, Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke these words of hope to an embittered and poor yet committed audience in front of our country's great Lincoln memorial. Today, though we may be unaware and untouched, these same words resound throughout the whole of our campus, through every dorm and every classroom. Our very nducation is soaked with the legacy of the many great social prophets. activists and leaders of our past. 
Whiln the temptation is surely to retreat into the bubble that can be Notre Dame, we are called to a greater awareness and action in tunc with the legacy of those who came before us. We are called to awareness and action. 
First of all, there is awareness. Notre Dame can easily be a Catholic Disneyland, where the intense football frenzy, blazing sea nuggets at South Dining Hall, bouncin' SYH dances and good times at Core class stifle the desire to interact with the rest of the world. That is not to say that these things are bad in them­selves, but that if they serve as a distraction from engaging the rest of humanity and the harsh realities faced, they can be harm­ful. 
So let's talk about engaging the rest of the world. Did you know that Aung Sang Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, is currently in a prison in Myanmar (formerly BuJ:ma) and reported to be engaging in a hunger strike, similar to the tactics of the great Mahatma Gandhi in the 1930s and 1940s? 
Or did you know that President Bush just asked Congress for $87 billion in emergency spending for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan? 
Or that the current U.S. census shows that the ranks of the poor rose by 1.3 million in the last year? 
If you are a New York Times reader, these realities are obvious to you, but if not, you are out of touch. Heading the newspaper can be a quick road to aware­ness. 
On a level closer to home, did you know that Desmond Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and archbishop emeritus of South Africa, is going to be here on campus speaking this Thursday? A man who very much changed the course of history through his actions is speaking this Thursday at McKenna Hall at 7:30p.m. at 
part of the Kroc Institute for 
International Peace Studies con­ference entitled "Peacebuilding After Peace Accords." 
For that matter, most people probably do not even know that Notre Dame has the Kroc Institute, which is located in the Hesburgh Center for International Studies building, offers a supplementary major or minor for undergraduates and is home to some very amazing pro­fessors who have done work all over the world. Awareness is the key, and we all have to work on it, myself most definitely includ­ed. 
The second step and the result of such awareness must be action. Just as King wrote in his famous "Letter from Birmingham City Jail" some 40 years ago, "We must come to see that human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability. It comes through tireless efforts and persistent work of men willing to be co­workers with God." 
So, what does it mean to be a co-worker with God? My experi­ence is that this means a lot more than simply going to classes. For me, this means using my privi­leges. gifts and education to take action for a more just and humane world. For you, it may mean something different, but the key is that it means some­thing; the key is that you take this call seriously. 
Here at Notre Dame. we have so many opportunities to be co­workers with God, whether it be being a Big Brother or Big Sister to an underprivileged kid, work­ing at the Center for the Homeless. going on a trip to Appalachia over fall break, work­ing for a social cause or even just being a good listener to the per­son down the hall who is home­sick. 
And the beauty that goes with such opportunities is that so many people at Notre Dame take advantage of them and do so much good with the world. If you want to get involved, visit the Center for Social Concerns. It is in this way that we are co-workers with God and conscious of those who came before us. 
As we move forward in this semester. I intend to use this col­umn as a way of bringing up dif­ferent social issues and concerns that call us to a greater aware­ness and action. We have a spe­cial duty as both a Catholic uni­versity and a privileged academic institution to use our resources, energies and gifts to act for peace and justice. I pray that we live up to such a great and challenging duty in the days ahead. I pray that we make our education meaningful.

EDITORIAL CARTOON 

Notre Dame is quite properly proud of its Academic Code of Honor. Yet our honor code is not in the best of health. Many, many faculty are ignoring their responsibilities under .the code. Many, many students are cheating and getting away with it. We need to face up to these 
Thomas Flint 
facts and to consider what, if anything, we ought to do about them. 
Guest
These are some of the 
Columnist
conclusions I have reached after one year as Faculty Honor Code Officer. The recent shift in honor code proce­dures has made it possible for us to attain a University-wide picture of how the honor code is being implemented. And that picture is rather disturbing. 
Research on college cheating suggests that a university such as Notre Dame would have hundreds if not thousands of honor code viola­tions each year. Professor Donald McCabe of Hutgers University, the best-known contempo­rary researcher on academic integrity, con­ducted an extensive survey in 1999. Among students at private schools with an honor code (i.e., schools like Notre Dame), 23 percent admitted to cheating at least once on tests. while 45 percent said they had cheated at least once on written work. 
If the numbers at Notre Dame are compara­ble to those found by McCabe, more than 1,800 Notre Dame students cheat on tests, while more than 3,600 cheat on written work. This means that at least 5,400 violations of the honor code have been committed by current undergraduates, with approximately 1,000 being committed in any given year. 
How many honesty committee hearings actu­ally took place last year? Forty. Yes, 40: 29 in Arts and Letters, six in Business, five in Science and none in Engineering. Unless Notre Dame students are far more honest than their col­leagues at comparable institutions, honor code violations are leading to hearings only about 4 percent of the time. 
It would be foolish, of course. to suggest that this figure is anything more than a reasonable estimate. But the general point seems to me undeniable: Only a tiny fraction of honor code violations are resulting in honor code hearings. 
Why are so few infractions leading to hear­ings? 1\vo explanations seem most plausible. First, many students are cheating without get­ting caught. And second, many faculty who do become aware of academic dishonesty are choosing to handle things on their own. 
Ifthese two factors do explain the low num­ber of honesty hearings, should we be con­cerned? Yes. Widespread academic dishonesty, whether or not such dishonesty is caught by faculty, is a blemish upon the character of our University. If "successful" cheating at Notre Dame is as prevalent as I have speculated, it should be a significant source of shame for the student body. 
Similarly disturbing is the behavior of the faculty. It's easy to understand why professors are tempted to act unilaterally when they sus­pect academic dishonesty. Some may be igno­rant of their responsibilities under the honor code; some may believe they can "protect" the student by settling the m!J.tter privately. 
Other less honorable motives may also be present. At a university where terms such as "faculty governance" elicit sardonic smiles, the classroom is one of the few places where the power of the instructor is genuine and unchal­lenged. Hence, many professors resist surren­dering control over the grade of a student sus­pected of cheating. 
Furthermore. honesty hearings take more time and energy than simply confronting the student in question and deciding on the spot what penalty to impose. And faculty are hardly immune to the lure of cutting corners. 
Whatever the motives for faculty non-compli­ance, there are strong reasons for thinking that this failure to abide by the responsibilities of the job is having deleterious consequences. 
First, history and common sense suggest that justice is best served when judgment is ren­dered communally rather than individually. Though faculty will surely strive to be fair, an instructor who (in most cases) feels that his or her trust has been betrayed by an act of appar­ent dishonesty is hardly in the ideal position to judge fairly and dispassionately. 
Furthermore, faculty who fashion private penalties are opening the door to the possibility of serial offenders. If the honor code is fol­lowed, students who commit a second violation will be identified and (usually) suspended or dismissed from the University. 
Where private "deals" are made, this safe­guard against recidivism disappears. Indeed, the door to a further inequity is opened. An "unlucky" student whose teachers abide by the honor code can be dismissed after two ofl'ens­es; a "lucky" one whose teachers ignore the code can commit any number of offenses with­out further disciplinary action. 
Finally, most faculty who engage in such acts of non-compliance ironically exhibit a kind of dishonesty themselves. They know (or should know) that the code requires them to act in a certain way. Yet they are failing to act in that way. And, of course, most of them are making their deals secretly, since they know that they have an obligation to act otherwise. One can only wonder what moral lessons are really being taught by faculty who act in this manner. 
None of us, then, should be complacent about the current situation. Students and faculty alike have reason to look for ways to rectify matters. In the second part of this column, I will discuss one semi-radical change we might want to con­sider.

VIDEO GAME REVIEW 
When ND football once a week isn't enough 
By TROY ANDROLl Scene Writer 
If you can't make it through the week without your lix of blocked punts, safeties and mascots, or if you're frustrated that you can never see the Fighting Irish play the Golden Gophers of Minnesota, EA Sports just may have your solution. 
NCAA Football 2004 was released over the summer and is a must-have for any video game library. 
The game-play is about the same as any other football game produced in recent memory, so if you've ever played a Madden game, you can pretty much handle the con­trols. One of the many novelties of this game is the obvious one that you can play as Notre Dame, which means that you can sack the quarterback with the guy who

2004 
EA Sports 


used to borrow your toothpaste or score a touchdown with that guy who's in front of you in class. Once you get past that, this game has so much more to offer. 
There's dynasty mode that lets you take the role of the head coach and Athletic Director. Players need to be recruited, schedules made and National Championships won. You're put in the dri­ver's seat and you have to build your pro­gram up to challenge year after year for the national championship, while at the same time losing players to graduation and recruiting more to fill the ranks. 
Even regular exhibition games are fun to play. You have a huge selection of 1-A and 1-AA teams and, as an extra bonus, there are a slew of playable classic teams. If you're ever in a sadistic mood, you can pit the 1924 Notre Dame team against Middle Tennessee State and watch the carnage 
that ensues. 
Yet another 


fun feature is the college classic option. This one is per­sonally my favorite. You're given a :-eal historical situa­tion, one of the best games played in the past 25 years or so; and you· either have to match a his­toric comeback

functions. While learning the new con­trols can seem overwhelming at first, it is both fun and extremely effective once mastered. With playmaker mode, you can use the right analog stick to change defensive coverage, the primary receiv­er's route or the direction of a running play before the snap. 
The most important application of the new controls presents itself when you are running downfield with one defender and one lead blocker between you and the goal line. In the past, you may have been dismayed to watch your lead block­er ineptly run the other way as you got flattened, preventing what would have been a sure touchdown. Now, simply point the right analog stick in the direc­tion of the defender, watch your runner point at him and call for help, and watch your lead blocker flatten him with a bone-crushing block as you

After spend­ing .the pre­season setting ticket prices, concession prices, park­ing prices and merchandise prices, I couldn't help but wonder how I ever played without owner mode. As the owner, the levels at. which you set prices and the success of your team directly affects the bottom line. Set prices too high or lose too many games and watch attendance plummet as you struggle to find enough cash to pay your players. Lower ticket prices to below the league average and win the Super Bowl, and you're on easy street for the next year or two.

By VINCENT McKINNEY: Scene Writer 
For more than a decade, the Madden series of football video games has been turning out quality games and has become the clear-cut leader of the genre. While it would be easy for EA Sports to take this into account and offer little to no innovation each year, they have instead outdone themselves once again with their latest edition of Madden, Madden NFL 2004. Playmaker controls and owner's mode, the two major additions to this year's game, are the most revolutionary ideas to be imple­mented in many years. 
Playmaker mode incorporates the rarely-used right analog stick into the game in order to perform a variety of high-step into the end zone. 

Owner mode is Madden's newest improvement upon the ever­popular fran­chise mode. Before, fran­chise mode gave you the power to sign draft picks and free agents, negoti­ate contracts

or change history and win the game as the team that lost it. The game puts you in at the end of the game in a critical situation and you have to finish it out. After you do, the teams are unlocked as classic teams for regular game-play. This is a great feature, because not only can you play the great games that you remember watching when you were little, but they're short enough that you can play during your lunch break or between classes and not have to worry about being late. The only frustrating part about this mode is overtime. Many of the classic games were actually played before the NCAA overtime rule, and yet if you tie at the end of regulation, you play overtime as ifthe game were played today. 
Beyond that, the limit of my frustrations has to do more with the NCAA than the game itself. Players' names are not allowed to appear in the game -only their nuJl!­bers. This can prove to be a little annoying but only detracts a little from the game. Overall, this game is definitely worth both your time and money.

owner's mode can be turned off to avoid the extra work. If it sounds great to the rest of you, I agree. The number of fea­tures and surprises contained in the game cannot nearly be described in one small review and, without a doubt, EA Sports' latest offering is a must-have. Once you experience everything there is to do in Madden NFL 2004, you will wonder how you ever got along without the new features.

ESPN's 'The Season' features Irish 
Weekly show will follow the Notre Dame football season both on and off the field 



ANDY KENNA/The ObseiVer Irish fans can now watch touchdowns each Saturday and behind the scenes action each Tuesday. 
By SCOTT FONFERKO 
Scmc Writer 
Last yPar, tlw Notre Dame football tearri nntercd the snason with a new coach, a new spirit and a burning desire to return to glory. 
Thi~ yPar. the Fighting Irish take the liPid with the same coach. the same spir­it. till' sanu goal-and an ESPN camera rrPw recording their every step along llw way. 
!>tiP to the success and renewed repu­tation of tlw Notre Dame football pro­gram. I~SI'N decided to feature the Irish for its show "The Season." Every Tul~sday night, the sports network will air a W-minute episode following Notre Damn and the team. both on and off the lield. 
"The Season," which started a few years ago, has followed such teams as St. John's college basketball program and the Oklahoma Sooners college foot­ball program. The show followed both the succnsses and failures in the lives of coaches and play·ers. 
"Tlw Season" was created when pro­ducers decided to film a different South Eastern Conference (SEC) 
school each week during foot­ball season. following them through preparations for the games. the games themselves and the happenings of a colle­giate sports program. 
On their filming adventures of SEC schools. ESPN featured the Louisiana State University Tigers. the University of South Carolina Gamecocks and the University of Georgia Bulldogs, along with a few other schools also included in the SEC. 
"The Season's" crew lilms the week-long preparations for each upcoming game. "The Season" taped the numerous practices, whether physical or mental, such as when the team sat down to watch film footage from the opposition to prepare themselves for their tactics. The show also revealed numerous other traditions that the specified school participated in to prepare themselves for the game on Saturday. "The Season" gives an in­depth view of each school's athletic pro­gram by going behind the scenes into the locker room and through the rigorous training. 
"The Season" approached former Irish head football coach Bob Davie tw0 years ago but was forced unexpectedly to conclude filming their season before the first episode even aired. Complications arose and upset Davie; the crew for "The Season" overstepped its allotted guidelines, forcing Davie to remove the ESPN crew from the locker room. 
This year. the producers of "The Season" approached Coach Tyrone Willingham to follow the Irish as they progress through the 2003 football sea­son. Willingham agreed, as long as they follow his guidelines. lie set forth strict rules and regulations for the crew; they arc not allowed inside the !:"ish locker room or at Irish staff meetings. Willingham does not want the influence of ESPN to get in the way of their focus on linding success in their football sea­son. lie has informed ESPN that, if "The Season" crew interrupts or affects the team in any negative manner, they are to leave. 
ESPN began its coverage of the Notre Dame program with the start of training in early August. It plans to show how the roaching staff prepares each and every player for the upcoming season. 
.... ·u·.-.··...,E,:··.·.' 
Although Notre Dame has been nation­ally televised every Saturday for the last decade, "The Season" provides a unique view into the heart of the tradition that Irish fans consider to be Notre Dame. From student managers painting the football helmets each week to the famed student section that has turned into a "Sea of Green," there is more tradition in Notre Dame football than in most schools. "The Season" reveals a glimpse of what goes on behind closed doors, showing a Notre Dame that most people, 
even students and fans, never see. 
This season, with "The Shirt" reading "Here Come The Irish," Notre Dame intends to be known as a terror in the eyes of their opponents. The Irish are already revered as one of the teams to beat for the 2003 season. 
Whether the Irish play well or not. Notre Dame has. and always will be, a team that colleges will want to play. 
They represent prestige that has culmi­
nated in years of success. It is only 
expected that such a storied program as 
Notre Dame will finally be rec­ognized for the heritage and tradition it has promoted for decades. 
Part of the heritage includes The Four Horsemen and Knute Rockne, but from there, the list goes on. Eleven national cham­pionships have graced the walls of the house that Hockne built. 
Fitting as it is. the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame will finally have their story told. They will no longer simply appear on NBC Saturday afternoon during the football season. For one hour a week, people can look in on this hallowed Notre Dame football program -"The Season:.Inside Notre Dame." 
This look into Notre Dame football premieres tonight at 7 
 p.m. South Bend time. It will air for the next 10 weeks on the same night and time, giving Irish fans all over the country an opportunity to take a deeper look into a developing program, which many fans hope will bring even more glory and honor to Notre Dame football.

NATIONAL LEAGUE 
Braves' Ortiz settles down to win career-high 19th 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Russ Ortiz bounced back from another shaky start for his career-high 19th win and the Atlanta Braves rallied for a 6-4 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, who dropped into a tie with Florida for the NL wild card Monday. 
Ortiz (19-6) gave up four runs in the top of the first, then pitched five scoreless innings while the Braves mounted a comeback against one of their former pitchers, Kevin Millwood. 
Mark DeRosa hit a two-run homer in the bottom half of the first and scored the go-ahead run in the fifth, scoring from third when Andruw Jones hit into a double play with the bases loaded. 
The Marlins pulled even in the wild-card race with a 5-0 victo­ry over the New York Mets. Florida and Philadelphia are 12 games behind Atlanta in the .NL East. 
The game drew only 17,543, the smallest crowd in Turner Field's seven-year history. 
Ortiz, who has four more wins than anyone in the NL, was 18-9 with San Francisco in 1999. He 'II get three or four more starts this season, needing just one more victory for the first 20­win season of his career. 
Mike Lieberthal hit a three­run homer off Ortiz in the first, which wasn't anything new. The Atlanta ace has given up 26 of his 94 runs in the opening inning. 
Ortiz was constantly behind in the count, throwing just 51 of 110 pitches for strikes. He walked four to take over the NL lead in that category from Chicago's Kerry Wood with 93 for the season. 
But Ortiz allowed only three hits and cruised after the Phillies left the bases loaded in the second. Philadelphia had only two baserunners from the third through sixth innings ­one on a hit batter, the other Qn Ortiz's final walk. 

Ray King pitched 1 1-3 score­less innings, Jaret Wright got the final two outs in the eighth, and Will Cunnane pitched the ninth for the second save of his career-and the last two days. 
The 29-year-old journeyman, who got out of a jam with run­ners on first and third with two outs in the ninth, is filling in as the closer for John Smoltz, expected to be on the disabled list for another week with a sore elbow.. 
Astros 8, Brewers 4 
Roy Oswalt returned from the disabled list and Jeff Bagwell and Lance Berkman each had three RBis as the Houston Astros beat the Milwaukee Brewers Monday night. 
The victory, Houston's fourth in five games, put the Astros in a first-place tie with the idle Chicago Cubs. 
Oswalt (7 -5), sidelined since July 30 with a strained right groin, was activated from the 15-day disabled list Monday. The right-hander allowed four earned runs on five hits in five innings to win for the first time since July 18. 
Berkman gave Houston a 3-0 lead in the top of the first with a three-run double on a 3-2 pitch from Wayne Franklin (10-12). 
Franklin, who leads the majors in home runs allowed, served up a two-run shot to Bagwell in the fourth to make it 5-0 lead. 
Wes Helms cut the deficit to 5­3 with a three-run shot with two outs in the fourth, but Houston pulled away with single runs in the fifth and sixth innings. 
Richard Hidalgo hit a solo homer, his 23rd of the season, to give Houston a 6-3 lead in the fifth. 
After Bill Hall hit a run-scor­ing single in the fifth, Bagwell got the run back with an RBI double in the sixth. 
Milwaukee lost its fourth game in a row and five of seven overall. 
Pirates 9, Reds 1 
Josh Fogg and the Pittsburgh Pirates like facing the Reds ­especially in Cincinnati. 
Fogg threw his first major league complete game, and Craig Wilson homered twice and tied his career high with four RBis as the Pirates beat the Reds on Monday night. 
Fogg (9-8) gave up 10 hits and no walks while striking out nine -one shy of his career high ­to improve to 3-0 in his career -all this season -against the Reds. 
The Pirates improved to 6-0 this season at Great American Ball Park and, dating to last sea­son, have won seven in a row in Cincinnati for the first time since May 31-Sept. 26, 1937. 
The complete game was the second in a row for Pittsburgh. Kip Wells went the distance in a 2-1 loss at Atlanta on Sunday. Fogg threw 113 pitches, 80 of them strikes. 
Wilson had three hits as the Pirates scored nine runs, which . matched their highest scoring output in any of their last 18 games. 
John Bale (1-2) allowed six hits, but three were home runs. He walked one and struck out three. 
Marlins ~. Mets 0 
Josh Beckett knew what it was all about-for the Florida Marlins.

night and moved into a tie for the NL wild card. 
Until the Marlins scored four times in the ninth, it appeared that Alex Gonzalez's third­inning homer was going to be it for the Marlins offense. But Beckett and three relievers com­bined on a six-hit shutout. 
Florida manager Jack McKeon lifted Beckett for a pinch hitter in the seventh inning. Beckett (8-7) struck out six and walked two. 
Relievers Nate Bump, Ugueth Urbina and Braden Looper fol­l.owed with three scoreless innings, handing the Mets their fifth straight loss. 
Florida moved into a tie with the Phillies for the NL Wild Card playoff spot when Philadelphia lost 6-4 at Atlanta. 
Florida scored four runs in the ninth off reliever Orber Moreno when pinch-hitter Todd Hollandsworth had an RBI sin­gle, Juan Pierre tripled in two runs, and Luis Castillo doubled in Pierre.

games behind the New York Yankees in the AL East and had their wild-card lead over idle Seattle shaved to one game. 
Yankees 9, Blue Jays 3 
Mike Mussina and Joe Torre 
enjoyed a quiet day at the ball­
park -especially because 
their team won. 
With only 8,848 fans at 
Yankee Stadium for a makeup 
date, New York made plenty of 
noise with its bats Monday and 
beat the Toronto Blue Jays. 
The manager had an easy day, watching Hideki Matsui drive in three runs and Mike Mussina pitch seven effective innings for the AL East leaders. 
The Yankees lead the majors 
with an average home atten­
dance of nearly 44,000, and the 
stadium was filled with three 
straight sellout crowds over the 
weekend to see Boston. But on 
a work day and school day, few 
fans showed up to see a game 
that was scheduled for July 22 
but rained out. 
This was the smallest crowd at Yankee Stadium since 8,112 saw the Chicago White Sox on Oct. 1, 2001 -a makeup for a game originally set for Sept. 11. 
The Yankees extended their division lead to three games over the Red Sox, who played later at Baltimore. New York ended the Blue Jays' three­game winning streak and stopped their 22-inning score­less streak. 
Mussina (16-7) was given a three-run lead in the first inning and kept the Yankees ahead before leaving after the seventh. He earned his 198th career victory, a day after teammate David Wells also won No. 198. 
Mussina struck out eight and took over the AL lead with 183, passing Boston's Pedro Martinez at 175. He fanned league RBis leader Carlos Delgado three times, and has certainly seen him enough -Mussina went 3-2 in six starts against Toronto this year.

for-3 with two walks. Derek Jeter and Alfonso Soriano also each had three of the Yankees' 16 hits -the same total they had in the whole series against the Red Sox. 
Kelvim Escobar (1 0-9) was tagged for eight runs and 10 hits in just 3 1-3 innings. Two of the runs were unearned, one because of his own throwing error on Giambi's bases-loaded tapper in the opening inning. 
White Sox 5, Twins 2 
The Chicago White Sox wast­ed little time warming up for their first-place showdown with the Minnesota Twins. 
Jose Valentin and Miguel Olivo had two HBis each in a five-run first inning Monday night as Bartolo Colon and the White Sox beat the Twins 5-2 in the opener of a key four­game series. 
With the victory, Chicago took a one-game lead in the AL Central at the start of what promises to be a frenetic final three weeks of the season. The teams also play three times next week at the Metrodome. 
Minnesota had its five-game winning streak snapped and also lost manager Hon Gardenhire, who was ejected in the fourth inning after an argu­ment with plate umpire Gerry Davis. 
Colon (13-12) allowed 10 hits and made one of the game's best defensive plays, snaring Denny Hocking's line drive up the middle with runners at sec­
ond and third and  no outs in  
the seventh.  
He  then  fanned  Doug  

Mientkiewicz and got Matthew LeCroy to fly out to end the threat. Colon walked one and struck out four in his seventh complete game of the season. 
The White Sox, responding to a loud crowd of 32,807 on a half-price ticket night, got all five of their first-inning runs with two outs against Kyle Lohse (12-11). 
Carlos Lee doubled with one out in the first, Frank Thomas walked and after Magglio Ordonez popped out. Carl Everett hit an HBI single. 
Paul Konerko walked to load the bases before Valentin blooped a two-run single to center to make it 3-0. Joe Crede followed with a single and then Olivo hit a sinking liner to left center that a diving Shannon Stewart couldn't hold, turning it into a two-run dou­ble. 
Lohse, 6-1 in his seven previ­ous starts. settled down there­after and allowed just two hits in his final five innings.

Patriots insist loss of Milloy didn't lead to blowout loss

NFL 
Texans look to build on upset of Dolphins 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON -The Miami Dolphins, traditionally strong in September, learned an impor­tant lesson: Nobody beats the Texans on opening day. 
Houston became the first expansion team to start 1-0 in its first two seasons. and will now focus on putting together the first winning streak in fran­chise history. 
"The challenge will be to see how much we've matured as a football team," coach Dom Capers said Monday as Houston basked in its 21-20 victory over heavily favored Miami. 
"There were phases of our football team that played extremely well after a win last year, but we didn't play well and put it all together as a team." 
The Texans had four chances to build a winning streak last year, but lost each time, by a combined score of 99-35. 
Houston's fifth chance to string together two victories comes in New Orleans on Sunday. The Saints are coming off a 27-10 loss at Seattle. 
Capers' task will be to get the Texans used to success and pre­pared for a winning encore. 
"It's hard for me to believe that we were ever an overconfi­dent football team last year," Capers said. "We just weren't consistent enough. One of our points of emphasis coming into this season was we wanted to be a smarter, more physical, more consistent football team. I think we made some strides in those areas." 
While no one is ready to pre­dict the Texans will play a home game Feb. 1 when the Super Bowl comes to Houston, there were signs the team has vastly improved from 2002. 
David Carr, sacked an NFL­record 76 times last season, avoided Miami's rush, which was led by 2002 sack leader Jason Taylor. Carr relied on quick drops, coupled with an offensive line retooled with three new starters. 
Houston did not fumble or throw an interception, some­thing it did not accomplish in any game last season. 
The Texans maintained their steady defense from last year, when they ranked 16th in the league. Virtually the same start­ing cast returned from 2002, though there's not much depth, making it important for play­makers like cornerbacks Marcus Coleman and Aaron Glenn to stay healthy. 
Offensive coordinator Chris Palmer balanced the attack with 34 rushes and 32 passes for a team-record 393 yards. New running back Stacey Mack gained 89 tough yards despite an average of 3.3 per carry, opening up passing lanes. 
With protection, a running game and No. 3 overall draft pick Andre Johnson, Carr showed why he was the top pick in 2002, going 17-of-31 for 266 yards and a touchdown. 
BOXING 
Byrd finally gets a fight 
Associated Press 
Chris Byrd is the IBF heavy­weight champion. 
He holds a real belt. It used to belong to Lennox Lewis, and Bryd had to beat Evander Holyfield to get it. 
Byrd also has an Olympic sil­ver medal. a 35-2 record and two of the fastest hands in boxing, but he's spent the last nine months trying to lure everybody -anybody -into the ring. 
''I'm the test in the heavy­weight division," the 33-year­old southpaw said. "Nobody wants to take the test. Nobody wants to study for something so hard." 
The knock on Byrd is his style, which is so herky jerky that some fighters don't want to get into the ring with him. He doesn't throw a nasty power punch or slug his way through his fights, but he is elusive and wily. And, unlike some in the heavyweight divi­sion, he's a nice guy. 
"In this era of craziness, if I were an ex-criminal or if 1 beat my wife, I'd be really easy to promote," he said. 
Byrd is fighting No. 2 IBF contender Fres Oquendo on Sept. 20 at the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Conn. 
Oquendo, another nice guy, has a 30-1 record and more speed and agility than name recognition. 
"We need to clean up box­ing's image," said the 30-year­old Oquendo of Puerto Rico. "We have an opportunity to show the boxing world there are some class-act fighters out the sport. who like to interpret there. We're the new genera­a fight plan strategy, this is tion." going to be an interesting

long. 
Lewis is on the sidelines, pondering retirement. He sur­rendered the IBF belt rather than face Byrd, who then per­plexed an aging Holyfield to seize the vacant title. 
Tyson, who hasn't fought since stopping Clifford Etienne in February, is mired in legal and financial problems. 
Byrd is in a perfect position to take advantage. His bout is being carried by HBO, imme­diately after the replay of the Sept. 13 fight between Oscar De La Hoya and Shane Mosley. 
Byrd hopes people tuning in to that bout will stick around for a different kind of heavy­weight boxing. 
"For those who understand I i k e

Byrd has been installed as the favorite by Las Vegas odd­smakers. and he said he's hop­ing a dominating win will get him the recognition he seeks. 
Whether it will give him a big-money fight remains to be seen. 
"Nobody is putting their hand up to fight Chris Byrd," Barry said. "The guy is extremely quick. He's the mos:. awkward fighter in the heavy­weight division. He takes a punch very, very well. and 11e has the fastest hand speed.

ST. LOUIS -One week into the season, the St. Louis Rams have a quar­terback controversy. 
Kurt Warner's comeback got off to a rocky start when he played through a concussion in the season­opening loss to the New York Giants. 
Healthy or not, he won't start Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers. Marc Bulger will. 
The two-time MVP said he felt fine Monday. a day after his fog-induced, error-filled performance in the 23-13 loss. After being released from a New York hospital earlier Monday, Warner ran and worked out in St. Louis. and he wants to play on Sunday. 
Doctors in New York told Warner he probably could practice Wednesday. although team medical personnel will be more cautious. 
"l think l should play." Warner said in a confer­ence call with reporters. "As long as the doctors clear me, I'll be ready to go." 
Not so fast. 
Coach Mike Martz blames himself for allow­ing Warner to slowly clear his head while fumbling six times and getting sacked six times, and said he'll take a safety-first 
IN BRIEF 
Knight's saga continues 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -Indiana University fulfilled its obligation to former basketball coach Bob Knight by continuing to pay him after he was fired. an attorney for the univer­sity said Monday. 
Attorney Dave Mattingly asked Monroe Circuit Judge Kenneth Todd for an order that would effectively dismiss Knight's lawsuit without a trial. Todd did not indicate when he would make a ruling in the lawsuit against the university. 
Mattingly said Knight's contract allowed the university to end his employment, for any reason, as long as the school continued paying him through the rest of the contract. If the university had fired Knight for cause, he said, the compensation would have stopped immediately. 
Knight was fired in 2000 for violat­ing a "zero tolerance" behavior poli­cy by grabbing the arm of a student who he said greeted him by his last name. Knight sued two years later. 
approach on Sunday. So Bulger, the backup who was 6-1 as the Rams' starter last year, will get the call. 
"This week I'm going to play Marc," Martz said. "l think we can go one week. and make sure. He's upset about probably going with Marc but l think it's proba­bly the best thing at this point." 
Martz said it's way too soon to talk about whether it's still Warner's job to lose. 
"l don't want to get into all of that right now," Martz said. "Let's just take it one week at a time at this point. 
"I don't know what the medical staff will say at the end of the week and I don't know how he's going to be at the end of the week. so if that ever becomes an issue we'll address it." 
Warner. the MVP in 1999 and 2001. was 0-6 with three touchdown passes and 11 interceptions last year while missing time with a broken pinkie and hand. He doesn't appear worried about the compe­tition. 
"This isn't about me and Marc, this is about the team," Warner said. "This is about doing what's best for our team." 

claiming the university violated his employment contract. He now is the basketball coach at Texas Tech. 
Russell Yates. a Denver lawyer who represents Knight, said Knight effec­tively was fired for cause. 
"The president of the university goes on national TV in front of 40 million people and says, 'Bob Knight's personal conduct is bad, and therefore I'm going to fire him,"' Yates said in arguments to the judge. "Everyone in the world, with the exception of the people at Indiana University, knows this man was ter­minated for cause." 
He said IU had to pay Knight until his contract expired regardless of whether he was fired for cause. 
While Knight's lawsuit claimed the firing cost him more than $2 million in media and clothing contracts as well endorsements and camps, Yates said the case isn't about money but Knight's "honor. reputation and integrity." 
"He had a right to go away with his integrity intact by answering these charges that the president threw out in front of 40 million people," he said. 
Leetch out with ankle injury 
NEW YOHK -New York Hangers defenseman Brian Leetch is out indefinitely with a similar injury to his left ankle that caused him to miss nearly half of last season. 
Leetch, 35, was practicing at the team's facility in Greenburgh, N.Y. last Friday when he was struck by a slap shot, the Hangers said Monday. 
X-rays were negative but Leetch is unlikely to be able to participate in New York's training camp that begins Thursday in Burlington, Vt. 
Last season, Leetch's 16th with thr Hangers. he severely bruised his IPft ankle when he blocked a shot against Columbus on Dec. 3. New York went 10-16-3-2 in his absence. 
Leetch signed iJ. two-year contract in July to stay with the Hangers after becoming an unrestricted free agent.

feel the pressure, Holiday lost the ball three times, recover­ing it once. The two lost fum­bles led to 10 Washington State points. 
Seeing the game slip away due to the relentless attack on his quarterback, Irish head coach Tyrone Willingham and the rest of his offensive staff went to work on how to pro­tect their signal-caller. 
"We had to make some [changes] in our protection because they were giving us some strong side pressure that we tried to have [Holiday] rec­ognize and they did a good job, sometimes slipping a guy by," Willingham said. "We tried do some things as coaches

make our protection a little more solid where we could give [Holiday] time to do some things." 
Given more time in the sec­ond half, Holiday was able to make some things happen. He scrambled for long gains when he couldn't find any of his receivers. Facing a Cougar blitz on second and goal in the fourth quarter, Holiday hit wide receiver Rhema McKnight on a slant over the middle for an 11-yard touch­down that brought the Irish within three. 
But Holiday wasn't the only one who benefited from the improved offensive line play from the first to second half. 
While the running backs saw marginal improvement in the third quarter (13 net rush­ing yards), the real difference was seen in the fourth quar­ter. 

The ground game led by Ryan Grant and Julius Jones rushed more effectively, including five runs over 10 yards by Grant and Jones. Attribute that production to two things -the Cougars' defense wearing down and the overall size and strength of the two Irish running backs. 
"I felt especially in the sec­ond half things started to go our way a little bit better and I could sense they were getting a little frustrated, a little tired," tackle Dan Stevenson said. "That's when we try to just keep pounding." 
"If you give anybody in the backfield the ball, you don't have to worry as an offensive lineman about a one-arm tackle or tripping up these backs," Morton said. "You 
can't be 
done. It's a 
pleasure to block for any of them." 
When the bre~aks weren't going their way in the first half, the inexperienced line could have mailed it in for the rest of the game. What that second half performance showed was the attitude this line wants to illustrate each and every time it steps on the field. 
"We fight hard. A lot of things about today were ugly, but we fight hard," Morton said. "We fought hard for 60 minutes. The fourth quarter was the toughest part of our fight. 
"If that's something that we can say to other people, that will win us some games."

SMC VOLLEYBALL 
'Underdog' Belles ready for Calvin 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
After their match Tuesday night, the Saint Mary's volleyball team might be able to show an MIAA opponent what the Belles already know -they are a much improved volleyball team from last season. 
The Belles travel to Grand Rapids, Mich., Tuesday night to face traditional power Calvin College in a key MIAA matchup. 
Saint Mary's (4-2, 0-1 MIAA) comes into the contest on a roll, having won four of five games at the Kilt Classic in Ohio last weekend. The four wins already place Saint Mary's well ahead of its pace from last year, when the team went 7-21 during the regu­lar season. 
The Belles are also anxious to avenge a narrow five-set loss to Albion last week to open their conference schedule. 
"We're real excited and [the girls are] hungry for an MIAA win," coach Julie Schroeder-Biek said. "We're the real underdog, but we've got wonderful team

season. Saint Mary's prefers to focus on its play instead. "We're starting off our confer­ence schedule and it's our first home game," Haring said. "With the start that we've had, we want to keep the same mentality 
chemistry and this is going to be a good game." 
The Knights have had the Belles' number lately. Last sea­son, Saint Mary's faced Calvin and lost in straight sets each time. Perhaps the most difficult loss was a 20-30, 15-30, 13-30 match which knocked the Belles out of the first round of the 2002-03 MIAA playoffs. 
"They're always just a real good solid team," Schroeder­Biek said. 
Calvin (5-0, 1-0 MIAA) is a tal­ented team on both offense and defense. The Knights so far have amassed 259 kills this season, while their opponents have only collected 32 kills. The Knights have also hit at a .338 percent­age for the season. 
Defensively, Calvin has 45 total blocks compared to nine for its opponents. 
Junior middle hitter Kara Kuipers leads the team with 86 kills and 27 blocks. Her per­formance has not gone unno­ticed by the conference, as Kuipers has been named MIAA player of the week the past two weeks. 
Middle hitter Christine Hendricks and outside hitter Kristen Kalb follow Kuipers in kills, with 54 and 49. respective­ly. The fact that two middle hit­ters have collected the vast majority of Calvin's kills is no surprise to the Saint Mary's coach. 
"They run really strong out of the middle," Schroeder-Biek said. "We practiced today against net aggression and defending the middle attack, because we know that's what Calvin wants to do." 
The Belles played in over fif­teen games this weekend, a fact that did not get past their coach. She insists that the team is well­rested and ready to take on what could be their most talent­ed MIAA opponent this year. 
"I think [the girls] have recov­ered and are building back up," Schroeder-Biek said. "I think they're rested and ready to go." 
The Belles return home Thursday to face non-conference opponent Rochester College.

without distractions. " Our girls are playing a very consistent brand of defense and limiting the opportunities of our opponents' offensive side. If there are shots on goal, we want them to be a low percentage." Execution of these goals depends upon defensemen Carrie Orr, Katie Taylor and Shannon Culbertson. And the Belles will need another strong game from freshman goalkeep­er Laura Heline as well. "[Heline] has been able to read the game really well and not give any easy goals away to opponents," Haring said. "The defense has been playing really strong. We want to keep our balance and our mindset."

Belles home schedule starts against Calvin 
By ERIK POWERS 
Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's opens its home season and conference schedule today against Calvin College. The schools enter today's game at opposite ends of the rebuilding process. 
Calvin is 0-2 after a pair of losses last week, but the team finished 9-3-2 in conference last year (12-6-2 overall), including a 1-1 tie and 1-0 win over Saint Mary's. Calvin graduated three all-conference seniors from that team, including Tricia Dyk. Dyk was all-MIAA each year at Calvin and was the league MVP in 2002. 
Saint Mary's is off to a school­best 3-0 start. Junior midfielder Jen Concannon was named the first MIAA player of the week over the weekend. Concannon scored two goals versus both SUNY-Brockport and Taylor. 
She leads the Belles with five goals on the season. Coach Peter Haring expects conference oppo­nents to take note of Concannon's torrid play. 

"I think that as the year goes on, especially in the conference season, opponents will know to look for her," Haring said. "That will open up opportunities for the rest of the offense. But if she can keep this pace up, she will have one of those golden seasons." 
SaintMary's is well-rested. The · Belles last played on Sept. 3 and should have fresh legs. 
Haring hopes that Saint Mary's will exploit its home field advan­tage. 
"Our field is one of the nicer ones in the conference," Haring said. "We keep it well main­tained during the season and off­season. We have a regular sized playing surface with the maxi­mum length and width. 
"At Taylor [last Wednesday] it was a much shorter game because they had a smaller sta­dium. We should benefit because with our offense we use the width of the field a lot." 
There won't be any grandiose speeches to commemorate the beginning of the Belles' home

Home schedule kicks off 
No. 15 Irish return home to play Valpo 
By HEATJ:IER VAN 
HOEGARDEN 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame may be in Indiana, not Kansas, but the Irish agree that there is no place like home. 
They are ecstatic to play on their home court after a five­game road swing to start the season. 
"We are so excited to be on our home court," sophomore middle blocker Lauren Kelbley said. "It's going to be great to be back in the JACC." 
Notre Dame (4-1) will face the undefeated Valparaiso Crusaders (8-0) in their home debut Tuesday evening. 

"We don't take anybody lightly, because in college vol­leyball, anything can happen," Kelbley said. 
No. 15 Notre Dame looks to maintain its ranking, led by Kelbley and junior hitter Emily Loomis. The Irish moved up six spots in this week's polls, jumping from No. 21. 
"It is very exciting to be ranked," Kelbley said. "We know our potential, and it's great to finally see us get in the polls." 
Kelbley is coming off an out­standing weekend at the Longhorn Classic, where she was named tournament MVP. Friday's match against Houston saw her slam 22 kills, and she hit .446 on the week­end. This was good enough to earn her Big East Player of the Week. 
Meanwhile, Loomis has also been playing well lately, earn­ing Big East Player of the Week last week and all-tournament last weekend. 
But this dynamic duo has not been alone in their efforts. Senior setter Kristen Kinder and sophomore setter Kelly Burrell have been instrumen­tal in leading the Irish offense. With the new 6-2 rotation. the Irish have been able to put up a dominant block on the oppo­sition's outside hitters. helping them to become an even better blocking team. 
Senior outside hitter Jessica Kinder, senior hitter Katie Neff and sophomore middle blocker Lauren Brewster have also been strong at the net for the Irish. 
"We are dominating at the nets," Kelbley said. "We have a huge block on the right side for all rotations, and that is big." 
For now, the Irish are just focused on handing the Crusaders their first loss of the season. 
"We are just going to go out there and play our best match on our side of the court, and see what we can do," Kelbley said. 
The Irish and Crusaders square off today at 7 p.m. in the Joyce Center, the first of seven straight home games for the Irish.
