Bishop edges Moscona in election 
By ERIN LaRUFFA Associace News Editor 
In a race that was almost as close as Monday's primary, Notre Dame elected its sec­ond female student body president in history on Thursday. 
Libby Bishop and running mate Trip Foley received 52. 7 percent of the vote, just enough to give them a 211­vote victory over Brian Moscona and Keri Oxley, who received 46.6 percent. 
"You really realize how good the other candidates are. It could have gone either way," said Bishop. 
The fact that Bishop is a female will shape her admin­istration, she said, especially with the 30th anniversary of women being admitted to· the University coming up in the 
fall. 

· "I think it will add to the gender relations viewpoint," said Bishop, whose mother was in the second class of females to attend Notre Dame. 
"It's so funny that her expe­rience was so different," Bishop said. 
Both she and Foley said they plan to start work on their platform goals immedi­ately. 
"There's a lot of things I can do before April 1," Bishop said. In particular, she mentioned bringing new head football coach Tyrone Willingham to the dorms, as well as expanding Flex Point meal plan options. 
"I'm just ready to get to work," Foley said. "I think Libby will do a great job." 
Foley was out to dinner with his parents when 
Judicial Council vice presi­dent of elections John McCarthy announced the election results. 
Campaign manager Pat Hallahan had to call Foley on his cell phone to tell him he had won. 
Foley's parents, who are in town for Junior Parents' Weekend, were in for a sur­prise. 
"Ile never told his parents he was running," said Bishop. 
However, once he told his parents he and Bishop had won, Foley said they were happy for him. 
"They think it's great. They were just surprised -happily surprised," Foley said. 
As Bishop and Foley pre­pare to begin their term, Moscona, currently serving as student body vice president,

Charting new paths 
Cancer Center continues research with $2.1 million grant 
current head of the Center for Transgene Research, the organi­zation was established "in a small way" in 1995 with a 50,000­60,000 dollar grant from the Walther Cancer Institute of Indianapolis. The lnstitute's grant was designed tb establish a basis for an organization that would effectively seek research grants, like the one given by the Department of Defense. 
Since its founding, the Center has grown rapidly. What started as an organization for which a few Notre Dame faculty members researched under, has expanded to include 30 members of the fac­ulty and numerous graduate stu­dent researchers. Today the Center boasts a multi-million dol­lar budget that allows it to focus on pre-clinical cancer research using state of the art facilities. 
"The scientific community is starting to realize the stuff that goes on here," Navari said. "We feel that at thls point, in certain areas of cancer research, we're as good as anywhere in the coun­try-including schools with med­ical schools." 
What adds to the uniqueness of the Walther Cancer Research Center, according to Navari, is the close relationship researchers enjoy from the different academic departments.

Parents arrive for 50th JPW 
By JOHN FANNING 
News Writer 
The 50th annual Junior Parents' Weekend officially begins at 9 p.m. tonight in the Joyce Center, and continues through Sunday afternoon. However, the weekend's upcoming events have been in planning with various campus groups since last April. 
The group leading the effort is the JPW committee, which was formed last April when students applied for positions through Student Activities. Chuck Lamphier was appointed chair of the group and has worked with a vice-chair and a committee of 17 other students since last spring, to facilitate the planning of all of the week­end's events. 
"It's a bigger thing than I expected it to be," said Lamphier, who added that all preparations are essentially complete. "It's been a lot of fun, and I have a great group of people that I've been working with." 
What the junior class and their parents will witness this weekend is merely the end­product of many months of

By ANDREW THAGARD Assistant News Editor 
For an organization pioneering new methods to diagnose and treat cancer, the Walther Cancer Research Center calls little atten­tion to itself within the Notre Dame community. The organiza­tion is spread out throughout campus, and because the Center has no central building, faculty members use their own laborato­ries for research. 
"I don't think if you think of Notre Dame and the College of Science you think cancer research," said Rudolph Navari, Center director. 
But this perception may soon change with the arrival of an additional $2.1 million in grant money from the U.S. Department of Defense. The money, according to Navari, will be used to fund new projects and expand on addi­tional research including studies focusing on cancer growth and development, genetics and drugs used in cancer treatment.

Today's Walther Cancer Research Center arose from rather quaint beginnings ~begin­nings so quaint, it seems, that the Center's diredors cannot agree on when it was founded.

Non-voting halls postone election results ND student wins $25,000 in sweepstakes


Journeys 
Thursday, Feb. 13, 1997 Thursday, Feb. 14, 1991 
It all started on a chilly February weekend in 1977 in the hills of eastern Pennsylvania. 
Braving snow drifts several feet high, hun­dreds of guests witnessed an important event in my life -a life that had yet to begin. 
Yes, on February 12, 1977, my parents, Walter and Kathy Kronk. were married. 
The coupling of my mother and father could not have been more coin­cidental. Introduced by mutual friends -my father co-worker to the husband, my mother co­worker to the wife -Mom and Dad instantly hit it off, and were married not far from my mother's home­town of Kutztown, Pa., within a year of being introduced. 
Looking back, my par­en ts are the definition of the cliche "opposites attract." My mother, a rural girl, went to school at Penn State. My dad, however, was born and raised in New York.City, and went to a rival Big Ten school in Ohio State. Somehow. someway, they made it work back then. 
And now, 25 years later, this weekend, in honor of their 25th anniversary, they are vacationing in ... South Bend?!? 
That's right, you heard me correctly. In honor of the 25th year since they were mar­ried, my parents felt it was a greater priority to make their presence known at the Notre Dame tradition known as Junior Parents Weekend, than to immediately jet off to some tropical paradise and sip exotic beverages with parasols in them. 
While I think their priorities might be a lit­tle.misaligned, I appreciate the fact that my parents have at the very least postponed their anniversary voyage in order to first spend time with their son who has been along for 84 percent of their married journey. 
That, in my opinion, is what makes JPW such a unique weekend. Each junior parent that visits campus this weekend has made some sort of journey in order to be able to make it here. My roommate's parents, for example, are making the trek to tropical South Bend from the polar climate of North Dakota. I'm sure I will hear some interesting stories about snow and hockey and all things icy. 
Everyone has made a unique journey to make it to South Bend here and now. And while some of these stories might be more mundane than others'. that does not render them any less personal. Each of our parents -as well as each of us has a very personal, very special. and I'm sure, very interesting story to tell. And JPW is one of those few times in our lives when these stories will be shared. 
To all junior parents: welcome tp Notre Dame, and welcome to Junior Parents' Weekend. l hope you enjoy your weekend here, and I hope the weather holds out this weekend like it has for most of the winter. I also hope you get a chance to share your sto­ries, as you all are the lifeblood of the Notre Dame family. 
And, in closing, I would like to wish my par­ents a very happy (and very belated) 25th anniversary. I truly appreciate all you have done for me for the past 21 years. If anyone sees them on campus, wish them a happy anniversary as well. I'm sure they will appreciate it ... seeing as how I forgot about their anniversary and, consequently, this serves as their only gift. I hope you like it.

HARVARD UNIVERSITY 
Faculty members tackle grade inflation 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 
Harvard University is about to enter a new phase in its battle against grade inflation. By Friday, all of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences' departments must report on their grading practices to the Educational Policy Committee, the body that advises the Faculty on most curricular mat­ters. The departments' reports will inform the EPC's dis­cussion this spring of how to best bring grades down from their lofty heights. By the end of the spring, the committee hopes to present the faculty with concrete pro­posals. And as the faculty begins this new investigation, professors widely agree that Harvard's grades are inflat­ed. But they hold varied opinions on why and to what degree these high grades present a problem. As data released by the faculty this fall shows, grades at Harvard are higher than they have ever been. Over half of the grades distributed among undergraduates last year were in the A-range, and during the last 16 years, mean grade­point averages have risen a full point.

INS detains possible GWU student 
WASHINGTON 
A man identified as a possible George Washington University student was arrested Monday night at the Pentagon for falsely identifying himself and is being held for immigration violations, according to court records. The man, whose United Arab Emirates passport identifies him as 23-year-old Sultan Rashed Sultan Jasmon Alzaabi, was riding in a tow truck on an off-limits road near the Pentagon on Monday night, according to a court affidavit. The driver of the truck, identified as Imad Abdel-Fattah Hamed, was also arrested and is being held ½ithout bond. Alzaabi and Hamed carried several forms of false identifi­cation and were taken into custody after Virginia state troopers arrested them for driving on Route 110, which runs east of the Pentagon. Trucks have been prohibited there since Sept. 11, according to the affidavit. The affi­davit reads: "Hamed said he met the passenger at the Northern Virginia Community College, although the pas­senger was now at George Washington (University)."

HCA celebrates 25 years of service 
By LIZ KAHLING News Write! 
This fall's Holy Cross Associates will be the 25th group of post-graduate stu­dents to embark on the year­long service program. 
It began with five volun­teers in Portland, Ore., and one in Chile. The program now has expanded to six more domestic sites in Phoenix. Ariz.; Coachella, Calif.; Colorado Springs, Colo; South Bend; Brockton. Mass.; and Wilkes-Barre, Pa. 
The anniversary celebra­
tion begins in August with reunions in Portland, Chicago, New York and Washington with the pro­gram's more than 700 alum­ni. The administration is also hoping to compile a book of letters and correspondences as a written history of the program and its people. 
The planning is still in the works, but this year's accept­ed associates should expect even more excitement in anticipation of their future experience as well as the cel­ebration of the tradition of this post-graduate service program. 
The tradition of HCA strikes a timely national chord in light of President Bush's State of the Union Address, calling for more volunteer corps to rebuild communities, mentor children and teach in troubled schools -much of what the associates have been doing for years. HCA continues to be a model for other faith-based volunteer services, providing training and development. 
"We are focused on how we can connect with other pro­grams that will benefit all service programs," said Rebecca Go, South Bend

assistant director. 
John Pinter. the South Bend director, said, "The anniver­sary celebration is kind of an indirect form of recruiting by example of what people have gone on to do." 
Pinter explained that HCA provides recently graduated students a chance to discern how to use their talents as students in service and a way to test their skills. 
"Some people say it's a year off, but it's really a 'year-on,' focusing on your God-given strengths and applying your­self," he said. 
Alumni, according to the director, continue to draw from their experiences and find different ways of recon­necting with the program's four pillars: commitment to service, community, living a 
simple lifestyle, and spiritual­ity. 
Although additional sites have been added, officials do not foresee any future sites in the immediate future. The idea is to be big enough for plenty of options in sites and jobs but not so big that the associates would not get to know the other 40 associates, according to administrators. 
The process of establishing another site can be slow. 
"It takes money and the local community has to be ready for it, as opposed to us saying 'we'd like to send some people to you,'" Pinter said. "There needs to be some pull from the communi­ty."

Bob Jones U. seeks minorities 
Associated Prcss 
GREENVILLE. S.C. 

Bob Jones University, the fundamentalist Christian school that banned interracial dating ban up until two years ago, is recruiting minorities in hopes of shaking its racist image. 
More than 40 minority stu­dents have applied for aid through two new funds that are sponsored by private dona­tions, and nine have won scholarships so far, school spokesman Jonathan Pait said Thursday. 
The university first admitted black students after the IRS moved to revoke its tax-exempt status in 1970, citing discrimi­nation. The school said that is has few blacks but no precise ligures on its racial makeup. 
Pait said the scholarships reflect a growing interest by blacks in the 4,200-student school. 
"Another reason is that we're so often pointed out as being so racist,'' he said. ·we wanted to take a stab, at least, to over­come that stereotype." 
· That task will be tough, said Bill Whitney, president of the Urban League of the Upstate. 
"This is an institution that hasn't been friendlv to blacks," he said.  
The school was thrust into the national spotlight when George W. Bush stopped there during his presidential cam­paign two years ago. 
Bush was criticized for not addressing the school's ban on interracial dating and state­ments by Jones that were per­ceived as anti-Catholic and anti-Mormon. 
In the wake of the criticism, Bob Jones III, president of the university founded by his grandfather 75 years ago, announced that the school would drop its ban on interra­cial dating.

KEY-MIRZAVAN 
Helped by clear weath­er, search teams began the grim task of retrieving the bodies of the more than 100 people killed when their Iranian airlin­er crashed into a snow­covered mountain. 
An army helicopter car­rying five or six bodies in a metal box hanging from a rope landed at Lorestan army base on Thursday. Many of the bodies were dismembered or mutilat­ed. 
The helicopter made two trips before darkness set in. each time being greet­
ed on arrival by wailing relatives who beat their heads in grief. 
Some were allowed inside the base to identify the victims. 
"I couldn't identify any­one. All the bodies are dis­figured beyond recogni­tion," said an emotional Masoud Hashemi, whose brother, sister-in-law and their child were among the passengers. 
Up to 12 bodies were brought to the base from the crash site. 
The official Islamic Republic News Agency revised the number of people aboard the Russian-made Tu-154 air­liner that crashed Tuesday to 107 passengers and 12 crew. Earlier reports had put the number of people to 117. All were presumed dead. 
Ali-Reza Towhidi, head of state-run Iran Air Tours, which operated the plane, said the company was taking all 12 Tupolev aircraft in its fleet out of service, IRNA reported. 
As the weather cleared for the first time since the plane crashed early Tuesday outside Khorramabad, about 230 miles southwest of the Iranian capital of Tehran, a few helicopters took off for the foggy reaches of the Sefid Kouh mountain where dozens of bodies have been spotted in the snow. 
At a makeshift base at the foot of the mountain, trucks rolled in with dozens of coffins to trans­port the victim's remains. 
Col. Heydar Paknejad, one of the helicopter pilots, cautioned that strong winds would make more flights impossible, IRNA quoted him as say­ing. Rescue teams have tried to reach the site sev­eral times by air, only to be forced to return by bad weather. Climbers trying to reach the site suffered broken bones.

continued from page 1 
Researchers from the University's departments of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Biology collaborate on research focusing on four main programs. These programs include a trans­gene group led by Castellino, a cell biology group and a drug design group led by Paul Helquist. The groups include faculty from the three departments and may work on different aspects of the same research project. Even the labora­tories used for the Center's research are spread out around campus. 
"Many times people will work in their own labs independently," Navari said. "We think that for cancer research [if people] work together, more progress will be made in a shorter period of time." 
This spirit of collaboration, how­ever. doesn't stop within University departments. The Center also works with Purdue's school of pharmacy in drug devel­opment and with Indiana University and Michigan University on product testing. In addition, IU medical students studying at the Notre Dame branch have the option of earning a dual M.D./Ph.D through both schools and research opportuni­ties through the Center. 
The organization also selects a limited number of Notre Dame undergraduate researchers and the Center for Transgene Research recruits students from German and Canadian universities for undergraduate assistant posi­tions. 
The road to drug development 
Researchers from the Drug Design Group are busy studying compounds that effect cancer cells and may be used in diagnosis and treatment. 
Currently. the group is working with antigens that are capable of binding to the outer membrane of prostate cancer cells. The antigen binds to a specific protein present only in the prostate cancer cell ­then just sits there. 
The research team used a super computer to create models of the molecules in computational chem­istry. Then, these molecules were manufactured in the lab and test­ed on tissue cultures. Soon, the team hopes to begin testing on animals. 
The antigen acts as what Helquist calls a "biological scaf­fold," and could lead to earlier cancer detection or prevent exist­ing cancerous cells from spread­ing to other parts of the body. 
The group is also looking into ways in which the antigen could serve as a target for cancer drugs. localizing treatment and minimiz­ing damage to healthy parts of the body. 
"One of the problems with con­ventional cancer treatment is that the drugs involved are very toxic. The drugs are not selective -they affect cancer cells and normal ered compounds that may affect cancer. If one of the compounds appears promising, Notre Dame researchers may take it on as a project. 
For example. Richard Taylor, a chemistry and biochemistry professor, is working with a com­pound that is capable of inducing apoptosis ­programmed cell death -in cancer cells. The compound may eventual­ly be converted into a drug capable of uprooting cancer growths. 
Drug development is a slow process, however. It takes on average 12 to 15 years for the evolution of new drugs, according to Helquist. 
A cellular approach 
Across campus, researchers in the cell biology group are using cell cultures to look at movement of cancer cells. 
According to Crislyn D'Souza-Schorey, a Walther Cancer Institute assistant professor, the team is studying how cells detach from a tumor and spread. The group is also looking at how cellular movement is regulated. 
"We're looking at not just the invasive process but also what leads to it," D'Souza-Schorey said. 
It's all In the genes 
Meanwhile, researchers from the transgene group are tak­ing a genetic perspective, studying how removing, changing or adding genes to a mouse chromosome will affect cancer. 
The group is especially interested in genes involv­ing blood clotting and anticoagulation because of their association with cancer.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
'Monologues' promote freedom 
Value open minds 
My letter is in response to Sean Dudley's letter on Feb. 
14. I guess it has to happen every so often that someone decides that he or she must change the University with a letter to The Observer. 
Yesterday, Mr. Dudley chose to do this with an attack on the "Vagina Monologues," "academic freedom" and "open-minded­ness." I already understand his issues with the "Monologues," but I am real­ly confused with what is wrong with academic free­dom and open-mindedness. I guess we could make this University a sheltered haven in which we can all share identical views of Christianity. We could, but we won't. 
Mr. Dudley does not seem to understand that without various views, one does not learn, but rather just regurgi­tates a single person's thoughts. 
I have recently read Chesterton's novel, "The Ball and the -Cross," (I suspect we may even be in the same class), and I have to say that I believe my worthy opponent is in error. He really does not qualify the quotation and I am also left wondering if he wishes to challenge the writ­ers and performers of the "Monologues" to a mortal duel. Chesterton was an avid proponent of Catholicism, but he also listened to opposing views, even embraced the arguments that they present­ed, as any true scholar would do. 
See, in order for one to truly understand one's own views he must also under­stand those of this "oppo­nent." 
Mr. Dudley does not seem to realize that "academic freedom" and "open-minded­ness" are what make Notre Dame a great place. All philosophies should be wel­come here, including atheism and lesbianism as well as other philosophies with which he does not agree. Understanding is listening, and apparently some do not value the latter as others do. 
I do not even wish to chal­lenge his views on the offen­sive nature, as Mr. Dudley just does not seem open to anything. He is obviously an avid Catholic and cannot bear to hear anything said against Catholic doctrine. On that note, I would appeal to the University to continue its approach towards a diverse education and to even take greater strides to diversify Our Lady's University. 
Dan Tyszka $Ophomore Sorin Hall Feb. 14, 2002 
U to be contingent upon whether the money is 
being put to good use. If students are going 
to events. the money is being spent well. And if students 
still feel that more money is needed, a further increase is 
something the senate, Campus Life Council and Board of 
Trustees should consider. 
Embrace femininity 
I would like to respond to Sean Dudley's letter con­cerning the vulgarity of the "Vagina Monologues." First, a small disclaimer. As luck would have it I know the author of said letter and therefore do not wish to condemn his intentions because I believe they were good. I must, however, strongly disagree. 
If I had to pick one word to describe Eve Ensler's play, (which I have seen and read many times) it would be "empowering." Women discussing their vaginas, learning about their vaginas, loving their vaginas and so on, is not disgusting or rude. On the contrary, it is extremely important. 
I'm not a psychology major, but I think one can make a connection between the epidemic of low self­esteem among females and the taboo surrounding their genitalia. Why is it that words like "cunt" and "pussy" are designated a~ vulgarities, while "wang" and "schlong" are accepted and common? Why are girls raised to be quiet and embarassed about a part of their body while the other half of the population campares the sizes of theirs? It's not fair. No one asked for their vagina. The least they can do is be proud of it. 
As for religion, there is no reference to it in the Monologues. The play cannot be compared to dung on a statue of the Virgin Mary when there is nothing similar to dung or the Virgin Mary in the play. Where the story of the young girl and the 24-year-old woman is concerned, there is no question that it is a little scandalous. However, nothing about it is "violent," and after one hears the story from the girl first hand through the monologue, the age difference question is lost in the beauty of her own self-realization. 
I'm a Catholic, I'm in the "Monologues," and I would be lying if I said that some parts didn't make me a little uncomforatable. But I embrace those feel­ings and consider them a challenge. I push myself not to be ashamed of how God made me.

FJ7'presents the 'New Playwrights Workshop 2002' and the R 
By C. SPENCER BEGGS 
Scene Edimr 
The campus spotlight doesn't always illuminate the real work that goes into a show. Actors are not the only people who produce a show. Some of the hardest work in any production is completed before a show even starts. 
Writers and directors must decide how the show will be presented and what it will say long before the first line crosses an actor's lips. Unfortunately, students are often removed from this creative process; most campus shows involve a com­plete professional script or director. 
But. the seven one-act plays pre­sented in the Department of Film, Television and Theatre's "New Playwrights Workshop 2002" are all written, directed, produced and per­formed by students. The authors of the shows participated in the FTT 
351: Playwriting and Screenwriting class last semester. but the directors, stage managers and actors come from other campus performing arts groups. In fact, the show will be the Notre Dame premiere of some of the actors. 
Although each show is credited with . a writer and a director, the two posi­tions collaborated on the shows. 
"In the "New Playwrights [Workshop 2002]," the playwrights would be at the rehearsal ... There was a lot of changing and reworking of the scripts," Meg Ryan, one of the direc­tors, said.

A tale of two Notre Dame parents 
For last year's Junior Parents' Weekend, I urged students to appreciate the weekend they were about to share with their parents and classmates. I recalled how I, as the coordinator ofmy JPW, had little time for my family. 
I let slip away an opportunity to share my family with my classmates and their parents. I failed to expose them to the diversity of my student family on campus. 
Our Church and our nation are strongest when we embrace tolerance and diversity. The coexistence of Bible­thumping fundamentalists with "Cafeteria Catholics" enriches our faith. Until the Sept. 11 attacks, Democrats and Republicans were last congenial "loyal opponents" prior to 1994. In light ofSept. 11, those ofus middle-aged people who are set in our ways should reflect on how we can learn to better tolerate and appreciate the diversity that makes us the renowned American or the fabled Notre 

Dame family. 
This parents' weekend, I tell a tale of two Notre Dame Gary Caruso parents -a father whose son graduated from Notre Dame and a mother whose two children currently attend the University. Each has read this column and communi­
Capitol
cated with me via e-mail. 
Comments
I. in turn, always respond to both the nice and nasty comments. Below are excerpts from each that are as opposite in tone as can be charted. 
Having seen that I worked for President Clinton, the man replied like a "freep­er," a conservative who bands together on the Internet on so-called "free repub­lic" sites to respond en mass like the old "moral majority" did with their letter writing campaigns. My Dec. 7, 2001, column citing the horrors ofwar from my father's World War II experiences and my generation's bout with Vietnam riled him. 
He wrote, "Ifyour phony, perjury-riddled, sorry excuse for a Commander-in­Chiefwere still in charge we'd probably be engaging in some country-wide hand-wringing instead ofresponding with the only thing that these maniacs understand. My son, a Notre Dame grad, was in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 and barely escaped with his life. For you to suggest [between the lines] that the United States is somehow responsible for these hideous attacks makes me wonder how you'd feel if you or a family member were victims of these animals." 
I replied, 'Tm not quite sure which lines you were reading between, but I agree that the United States must strike back in the manner we set forth. I was trying to bring some reality to the students on campus who have no idea what war and suffering and death is ... unlike my generation that faced going to Vietnam. 
"Why not re-read my column without your emotion and see ifthe lines between which you have read are not exactly the same ones I intended for the readers." 
He then e-mailed me, "I re-read your column v.rithout emotion, and you're even further off-base than I originally thought. What really frightens me, almost more than bin Laden, is that you have access to some very intelligent, fertile minds [at Notre Dame]; we can only hope that their parents have prepared them to deal with misguided souls like you." 
He went on, "What do you mean 'our' generation, do you think you're the only one who had to face the potential of war, Vietnam or otherwise? The world doesn't revolve around liberals only!" 
When my sister, also a Notre Dame graduate, and I cited Web sites that offered countering points ofview, he replied, "Doesn't anyone else read your col­umn? For someone who worked for [Clinton] would suggest to me that you haven't even earned the right to the little Observer column that is read by no more than a handful of people ... good thing!" 
A Notre Dame mother wrote, "I felt I had to contact you over 2 years ago when I read your article about Father Robert Griffin, 'Live Each Day as if it Were Your Last.' But I got busy and the thought faded away. That is why after reading February 1, 2002 column, 'Savoring the Semester,' I had to respond." 
She went on to say, "I too let a sighting of Father Griffin go by. I had often thought about him and considered him one of the people at Notre Drone who had the most impact on me as a person, along with my roommates, a few friends and a professor or two. I did not have the courage to tell him what an influence he, his sermons, and his writings had on me for the past 20 years. 
"When I read ofhis passing, I was quite upset over the loss of him for the University and for this world and upset with myself for not contacting him before he died ... I had Jet a moment slip away that could never be recaptured." 
"You can't know how proud and overjoyed I am that my children are attending Notre Dame and loving every minute of their experiences. I feel I should still be a student. I do not have clear, sharp memories. I know I enjoyed myself, studied hard, made great friendships that have endtrred, but my mind is fuzzy on real recollections. I am trying to instill in my children to treasure each and every day, the good days and the bad, the beautiful weather and the snow and ice, for they'll be moving on before they know it." 
After exchanging more stories via e-mail, she wrote, "I really look forward to being on campus again and sharing experiences with my son and daughter and gathering fresh memories for me to hold on to." 
She concluded, "All in all, I have been blessed and I certainly attribute a lot of my blessings to Notre Dame and what it gave me -intellectually, personaJly, emotionally and spiritually." 
We can attribute that to diversity and tolerance.

Attacking the 
State of the Union 

This letter is in response to Mike Marchand's Feb. 11 column. 
President Bush did not shine with his State of the Union Address. He basked in the glow of a nation eager to rally behind their leader. There was no "plain-spoken eloquence." Implying that America is the unquestionable good opposed to "evil," categorically group­ing three cowitries whose situations are very different into an "axis of evil," and saying things like "let's roll" and "make no mistake about it" is not eloquent. It is sensationalist, plays upon the American public's ignorance of foreign affairs and simplifies difficult ques­tions. There was no "bold, visionary changes for both the immediate and the long-term future of the union." 
Bush repeatedly returned to his patriotic rallying cry throughout the speech, not going into detail about domestic policy. His policies do not work for "America's hardworking families." Just take a look at his tax cut. He does not govern "from the center as much as possible." The nation has not heard rhetoric like his since Reagan. He is not "more of a rapid-fire texas gunslinger than a poet, linguistically speaking." He is a rapid-fire Texas gunslinger who is appreciated by people like Mike Marchand who can take pride in saying that"America will now work to annihilate the enemies of the 21st Century -before they can do it to us." His State of the Union Address confirmed that Bush is an "intellectual lightweight" who makes that point clear every time he opens his mouth.

Irish look to rebound in crucial Big East games 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Associate Spores Editot 
Call it a tale of two teams heading in very different direc­tions. · 
When Notre Dame lost to Syracuse a month ago, the Irish couldn't find their shot and the Orangemen were ranked No. 7 in the nalion. The loss prope!Jed the Irish to a three-game losing streak. 
Then Notre Dame's fortune changed and the Irish reeled off five consecutive wins before losing Thursday night. The 0rangemen, on the other hand, lost five of their next seven and tumbled out of the Top25. 
On Sunday, these two teams will meet in a game that has tremendous implications on Big East play. 
"Everything we do with our basketball program starting Sept. 1 when our kids get back is to be fresh in February and make a run," Notre Dame coach Mike Brey said. "It worked last year and so far it's working this year." . 
The Irish have the ability to control their own destiny in the Big East. At 7-4 in Big East play, Notre Dame is tied for second place in the West Division with Syracuse, one game behind Pittsburgh. Should the two teams finish with the same record at the end of the season, the Irish would win the conference 14, their 2-3 zone defense lane against the 0rangemen Shumpert; DeShaun Williams his team will change its focus, because they beat the Panthers caused major problems for will be an important factor in and Kueth Duany.

STYLE OF PLAY 
Notre Dame played much more aggresive­ly during its five-game winning streak. Rebounding and defense have been the keys for the Irish. When their defense is rolling, they can't be beat. 
Syracuse uses the 2­3 zone defense almost exclusively. The 0rangemen also have . the ability to stretch their defense out to the perimeter to cut down on long-range shoot­ers. They usually score from the perimter. 
POST 
PLAYERS 
Humphrey has been 
.the inside presence for the Irish all year long. While his free-throw shooting leaves some­thing to be desired, he hits them when the game is on the line. Swanagan is a major factor in the recent Irish resurgence. 
Inside game? What's that? No player aver­ages more than six rebounds a game, and Forth is the only player above 6-foot-9 who sees signi.ficant playing time. 
PERIMETER 
PLAYERS 
Thomas is the spark­plug to the Irish offense. If he plays well, the Irish play well. Carroll and Graves broke out of their mid­season shooting slump and are deadly from the perimeter. 
BENCH 
While Brey rarely went to his bench in the beginning of the season, the emergence of Timmermans and Cornette have allowed 
Humphrey  and  
Swanagan  to  rest.  
Jones  is  an  early  

defensive presence. 
INTANGIBLES 
The test for the Irish will be how they rebound from Thursday's loss. But they'll havea boilster­
ous home crowd behind them and have gained a lot of momentum the last six games. 
::::::::::::::::::::::: ::::::::::::::::::::::: :::::::::::::::::::::::: 
When the 0rangmen score, they do it from outside. Shumpert is a versatile player who averages over 20 points a game. Shumpert, Williams and Duany scored 44 of Syracuse's 56 points last time they played the Irish. 
Syracuse receives solid, but not spectacu­lar, production from its bench. Like the Irish, the 0rangemen usually play eight men, but their subs don't really do more than fill a spot on the floor while the stars rest. 
Quite simply, the 0rangemen are reeling since they last played the Irish. They've lost five of their last seven games and, if they don't improve, are in danger of not making the NCAA Tournament.

Leading by exa01ple 
Senior captain Humphrey has no problem filling the big shoes ofa vocal leader 
By KERRY SMITH 
Spores Writer 
The while adi<las sneakers Ryan Humphrey wears on the basketball court tell much · about where the senior captain has come from and where he 
wants to go. 
· While his dedication on the 
court shows his love for the 
sport he has played most of his 
life, his shoes show that his 
personality runs much deeper. 
Inked in royal blue on the 
outside of his left high-top, 
read the initials "MAH" and 
Bible citation "Romans 8:28." 
Humphrey wrote the initials, 
a reference to his mother 
Melodi Ann Humphrey, on his 
sntJakers to remind him of the 
person he has become. 
"Y!y mom is very important to 
me," Humphrey said. "She is 
the person I get who I am from. 
It also serves as a reminder to 
me so I don't do anything to 
embarrass her." 
That reminder is just as 
important as the maxim 
Humphrey has chosen to model 
himself on. Romans 8:28 reads, 
"We know that in everything 
God works for good, with those 
who love him, who are called 
according to his purpose." 
"Romans 8:28 is something I 
always take with me," he said. 
"It's something I want to live 
my life by." 
The references on 
Humphrey's sneaker form the 
bedrock of his character: fami­
ly and faith. 
"Being that my father is a 
minister, that is very important 
to him," Humphrey's twin sis­
ter Robyn said. "Being close 
and committed to God has 
always been important." 
Family and faith have 
brought the senior far during 
his college career -a five-year 
journey that has taken 
Humphrey from Oklahoma to 
Indiana, through three coach­
ing regimes and many role 
changes on and off the court. 
The Tulsa native began his 
career at Oklahoma, making an 
immediate impact for the 
Sooners. Despite being diag­
nosed with iron-deficiency ane­
mia which limited his playing 
time most of his freshman sea­
s on. the McDonald's and 
Parade All-American still 
earned a spot on the 1997­
1998 Big-12 All-Freshman ros­
ter. 
During his sophomore sea­
son, Humphrey continued to 
make strides, helping his team 
to a Sweet 16 berth in the 
NCAA tournament.. 

But despite his early success­
es, Humphrey needed a change 
after two years with the 
Sooners. 
"Transferring was tough, but 
I made that choice and took 
that on myself," Humphrey 
said. "I needed to get out of 
Oklahoma. It was nothing per­
sonal with my coach or the 
team." 
Humphrey had been recruit­
ed out of high school by Kansas 
assistant coach Matt Doherty, 
so when Doherty took over the 
Irish program, Humphrey 
decided to make the transfer to 
Notre Dame. But he didn't come alone. Robyn came along for the 
rid·e. 

"Coming out of high school, we made a package deal. We would go to college together," Robyn said. "And so when he wanted to transfer, I decided to follow." 
His sister's presence made the 800-milc transition easier. 
''She's great. She's my best friend." Humphrey said. "We talk daily and we keep each other rooted." 
Because Humphrey had to sit out his junior year at Notre Dame as an NCAA-sanctioned stipulation of Lhe transfer, he never saw court time during the Dohertv-era. 
Almost a·s soon as the former Tarheel player arrived at Notre Dame, he left to accept the head coaching position at the North Carolina. 
Humphrey found himself again in the predicament of a new coaching staff and a new coaching style. 
"It was tough, but it worked itself out," Humphrey said. "That's just part of life. You just have to take on another role after the changes." 
Those changes, including the arrival of current head coach Mike Brey and the departure of Troy Murphy, have only helped Humphrey emerge into a respected leader on the Notre Dame squad and a dominant force under the basket for the Irish this season. 
"He was pretty much a man when I got him," Brey said. "He's always handled his busi­ness very maturely." 
Humphrey's maturity and leadership has elevated him to a virtual coach on the team. 
"He's doing a great job in his role as a captain. And not every senior captain takes that role seriously," Brey said. "He's taken it very seriously and helped me lead the team ... This year, I think our commu­nication has been a key as far as keeping our group moving forward." 
He is dominating force on the court. He is a teacher to his teammates in practice. He is a powerful voice in the locker room. And he is an example of hard work and determination for his squad members. 
"He's a little bit of whatever it takes," Brey said. "It's almost as if he has good read on the pulse of our group and he does what's needed." 
Tuesday was not an atypical day for the Irish as they pm­pared to practice in the Joyce c~nter. 
As most of the team hung out in the locker room a half an hour before practice began, the steady beat of a lone basketball echoed throughout the Joyce Center: four pumps to the floor, a two-second pause and then a shot from the foul line. Humphrey repeated the beat from both ends of the floor as student manager Malcolm J-!armer, a junior who Humphrey considers his closest friend on the team, rebounded. 
Humphrey's dedication to improving his free-throw 

shooting, a facet of the game he has taken much slack for this season, is an indication to his team of how great hls work ethic is. . 
"He spends a lot of time out­side of practice working on his game," Farmer said. "People don't see all the work that he puts into it. People may get frustrated with his free throw shooting, but there isn't a time when he goes to the line that I don't think it will go in because I've seen too many of them go in." 
Humphrey's dedication is also not lost on Brey. 
"[His work ethic isl awesome ... to the point where J worry about him wearing himself out because he wants to do so much extra stuff," Brey said. " He's a guy who's made himself a better player. He was always a great athlete but he's made himself a better basketball player." 
Humphrey's work ethic and dedication is so great that despite spending upwards of 20 hours a week tuning his game outside of practice, his biggest regret is that he did not start working harder sooner. 
"1 wish I had worked harder at a younger age," he said. "I think my work ethic is good now, but that's separate. I didn't have that work ethic at a younger age." . 
It is that maturity that has allowed Humphrey to teach the younger members of the Irish squad. 
"He's been great with the younger guys and put them under his wing," said fellow senior captain David Graves. "You come in as a freshman and you feel like you have to prove things, and you don't need to, and he helps them realize that." 
Freshman forward Jordan Cornette is one of those players Humphrey has taken under his wing. 
'.'He knocks you around, but he also tells you how to defond those kind of moves so you become a better defensive play­er because he breaks you down and then tells you how to stop that," Cornette said. "I take his confidence level and learn from 
that so when I'm in the games I try and play at that confidence level so when I'm out there I . feel like the opponent I'm going against -I'm no less than him, 
but I'm better than him." 
Humphrey's attitude toward 
his team and its performance 
has turned in big numbers for 
the Irish this season. 
The senior leads the team, 
averaging 18. 7 points and 9.8 
rebounds a game. 
With a core set of upperclass­
men and a talented class of 
underclassmen who have 
quickly matured under senior 
leadership as the season has 
progressed, Humphrey has 
high hopes for his final season· 
in a collegiate uniform. 
"My goal is to make it to the 
NCAA tournament four years 
straight. The farthest I went 
was the· Sweet 16 and this year 
as senior I'd like this team to 
go farther," Humphrey said. 
"Everyone on the team knows 
what we're capable of."

Breaking down the Big East Conference 
The only guarantee in the 13ig East Conference this season is that there are no guarantees. No other conference in America has experienced the same degree of parity as the Big East. With .two weeks left to go in the regular season, both the East and 
West 
Divisions of the Big East are still up for grabs. Upsets and surprises have painted a cloudy picture at the top of both conferences. 

As we head down the final stretch, nine teams still have legitimate shots to win their respective divisions and com­pete for a coveted dance ticket to March Madness. No single team has been able to separate itself from the rest of the pack. 
There is an old sports adage that beautifully describes Big East basketball -"Any given team can beat any other team on any given night." 

Case in point, Boston College lost to lowly Virginia Tech last week, only to turn around and defeat No. 11 Miami three days later. 
Enough of the confusion already. It's time to break down the Big East. 
Who's hot 
Notre Dame is simply on fire 


_right now, running its record to (17 -6, 7 -4 l. With five straight victories before their loss last night, the Irish haVfi put them­selves in prime position to repeat as champions of the West Division. Notrn Dame sits in second place in the West Division 
Who's not 
Syracuse is fading and fading fast. Last Sunday's second-half meltdown against Pittsburgh has left the Orangemen (18-7, 7-4) tied for second with Notre IJame and a full game behind Pittsburgh in the West Division. Even worse, the Orangernen are no longer a sure bet to make the NCAA tournament. 
This Sunday's game against Notre Dame has huge implica­tions for both teams. The win­ner will likely have assured itseU' of a bid to the Big Dance. 
Biggest surprise 
Pittsburgh has shocked the entire nation this year en route to a (21-4, 9-31 record. With a favorable remaining schedule, the Panthers should lock up a bid to the NCAA tournament. 
Perennial doormat Rutgers (15-8. 5-5) has also been strong this season, posting two huge upset victories over Connecticut and Georgetown. 
Miami (18-6, 7-4) has also been surprising during their rise to the No. 11 ranking in the country. 
Biggest disappointment 
This dubious honor goes to Boston College (16-7,5-5). After last year's East Di-vision cham-pionship, big things were expected of the Eagfos. The Eagles have struggled to l.ind any consistency all season with a huge loss at the hands of Virginia Tech. 

Despite the veteran leader­ship of Kevin Braswell and the strong inside play of Michael Sweetney, Georgetown (15-8, 6­
5) has been mediocre this sea­son. 
As lousy as Boston College and Georgetown have looked at times this season, they still have outside shots to compete for Big East regular season crowns and improve their March Madness prospects. 
What it all means 
Right now, Pittsburgh is tied for the lead with Notre Dame in the West Division, while Conne (18-6, 8-3) is a game ahead of Miami in the East Division. 
The Panthers, Irish, Huskies, and Hurricanes all seem to have the inside track to NCAA tournament bids, but there is still a lot of basketball left to be played. 
Notre Dame still has three critical showdowns left with Syracuse, Miami, and St. John's. 
The division leaders have a very small margin for error. Syracuse, St. Johns, Boston College, Georgetown, and Rutgers all currently sit within two games of the division lead­ers. All of these teams have the potential to win the Big East Tournament in a few weeks. 
If the regular season is any indication, the tournament promises to be filled with even more close games and surpris­ing upsets. 
After all, anything can hap­pen in the Big East.

tory/Performance Workshop presents '2002 Dance Spectrum' 
By EMILY FORD 
Scene Writer 
Those who are children of the '80s grnw up mesmr-rizcd by dance-charged films like "Fame" and "Flashdance." Some even dared to don leg warmers and sweatbands in an attempt to attain the ability that those movies showcased. They hurried excitedly into their first dance classes, eager to learn and even more eager to perform. 
However, those who failed to even walk to the correct beat resigned them­selves to the fact that dance ,vas left only to those who possessed coordina­tion. Dance became something that could only be appreciated by the elite: the dancers themselves. This miscon­ception of dance as being only for the artists .is what the "2002 Dance Spectrum" aims to move aside. 
With a wide variety of dances ranging from ballet and modern to jazz, the audience is promised to find something it will appreciate. The mission of the "2002 Dance Spectrum" is to bring dance to the entire community. 
<;If you can make dance more accessi­ble, that it's not something on a big, high pedestal, but something that they can see and want to see more frequent­ly, they can incorporate it and say, 'Oh, that was so neat, I want to see some more.' And there's such a variety that hopefully they'll each have a little sam­pler," Indi Dieckgrafe, artistic director and choreographer, said. 
The dancers also want the audience to capture the versatility of the concert. 
Otis Cortez-Hill, a senior Film, Television and Theatre major at Notre Dame and the company's only male member, believes that everyone will find a piece that appeals to them. 
"I want the audience to gather the sense of eclecticism, a sense of universal dance. There's something for everybody and no matter what you like, if you like ballet you have the ["Silver Variation"], if you like pseudo-improv modern dance, there will be something for everyone," Cortez-Hill said. 
Cortez-Hill is a vehicle of the eclectic nature of the concert, appearing in "At the River," "What to Do" and "References New." 
Saint Mary's has always kept its dance performances from being restricted to just one genre of dance. The title of the concert, "2002 Dance Spectrum," reflects its wide span of movement stvles. 
·.. It seems like we have always been known for presenting an eclectic array of dances. We do have· all those different techniques and styles that we teach. I don't know if I can really say themati­cally flxcept that it will give you a range, because there isn't a certain thing that we're focusing on, that we're letting everyone have their individual expres­sion," Dieckgrafe said. 
With nearly 10 pieces being per­formed, an idea of what Dieckgra.fe calls openness and acceptance arises. This concept has given Saint Mary's the opportunity to showcase diverse works and the diverse dancers of the Repertory/Performance Workshop: Otis Cortez-Hill, Therese Cullen, Katie Decoste, Adrienne DeGraff, Emilie DesJardins, Emily Fagan, Erin Flynn, Walton. with guest dancers Kathy Ornish and Justin Smith. The unseen, but necessary contributors to the con­cert arc lighting designer Tom Boclman and costume designer Ginger Moritz. 
The concert utilizes thr creations of various choreographers from various disciplines. The show opens with a tra­ditional piece entitled "Silver Variaiion and Coda from 'The Sleeping Beauty,"' choreographed by faculty member Jill Tulchinsky and performed by soloist Emily Fagan. 
Ballet is taken into another direction by Laurie Lowry, an adjunct professor of ballet and Pilatcs at Saint Mary's. She has danced professionally with multiple companies, including the California Ballet and Ballet Hawaii. She has taken her vast experience in dance to create "Vivaldi," a ballet that possesses both upbeat moments and serenely sophisti­cated ones. 
"The beginning and ending are light and the middle section is quiet and ele­gant," Lowry said. 
The piece exhibits a Spanish style, meant to be executed with both. grace and precision. 
"Collection/Essence" is a piece that not only utilizes dancers, but art as well. Donald Stikeleather, a professor in dance at Saint Mary's and Notre Dame and an experienced modern dancer, col­laborated with artist Kathy Ornish for this work. Ornish was fascinated with the idea of boxes both constricting and protecting; she constructed movable sculpture to explore this concept. This piece is unique because it possesses qualities that are not typically associat­ed with dance. 
"It has sculpture that moves, dancers that stand still instead of moving, it has silence with no. dancing," Stikeleather said. 
Unlike dances that are a blur of con­stant motion, "Collection/Essence" has moments when nothing kinetic is hap­pening. 
"We have tried to make a balance so that it's not too much all the time," Stikeleather said. 
The collaboration of the two art forms was a positive experience with a positive result for the artists. 
"What we created was different than what the two of us could have created alone," Stikeleather said. 
The second act opens with "At the River," by guest choreographer Kevin Magee. Magee is a renowned choreogra­pher and currently dances with the Ellen Sinopoli Dance Company in New York. He has devised a theme meant to captivate the audience while the dancers attempt an escape. 
"His piece is a compelling work for nine dancers with an intriguing move­ment vocabulary that supports a ritual­istic and tribal atmosphere," Dieckgrafe said. 
"Psalm" is a piece of personal impor­tance to Dieckgrafe. 
'"Psalm' is 10 years old and it's kind of poignant that it's being done at this concert because my husband gave me the music for that ten years ago on 

KATIE LARSONffhe Observer 
Valentine's Day," Dieckgrafe said. 
The religious content of the music and choreography is meant to convey an experience of spiritual elevation. Though this piece has been performed in many different arrangements, soloist Amy Lazzarotto ventures to capture the emotional, yet reverent message. 
Dieckgrafe continues to innovate with the modern piece, "Emevese." Though most traditional modern pieces are danced barefoot, "Emevese" is per­formed in pointc shoes. Oieckgrafe's dancers led her to this variation. 
"Just in working with them, I knew they weren't going to be happy in the modern genre. So I decided if these girls want to dance on pointe, they'll just do it on pointe ... The piece became about them, about the three dancers that I had, and that's why I did "Emevese," a section of each of their names," Dieckgrafe said. 
The concert continues with the pres­ence of choreographic flexibility in "What to Do." It is a piece that is not dictated by strict choreography, but by vocal cues in the music. 
'"What to Do' is my own question of what to do and so I didn't know where to go with that, and that led me to the fact that I kind of wanted to be told what to do and that became the substance for the piece. I'm really happy with the way it turned out with the input of the dancers and the fun idea that actually brought this piece to life," Dieckgrafe said. 
The final piece, "References New" employed the input of another artist, sculptor Lanny Bergner. It has been performed previously this year at the installation of Bergner's sculpture at The South Bend Regional Museum of Art. To recreate the setting created by Bergner, screens similar to his will be hung, providing the background for slide projections of his actual work. 
The focal point of the piece is a simu­lation of a nest constructed by Bergner that will house eggs containing wind­shield glass and pins. The collaboration with Bergner and sound designer Cloud Tiger will culminate into a work encom ­passing visual and auditory art forms. 
The final piece, "Diamonds," was 
choreographed by Courtenay Lauer, a 
student company member. The piece 
showcases a contemporary jazz style 
with intended sassiness and finesse. Its 
music, from a blockbuster movie sound­
track, strives for mass appeal as well as

Irish into committing an unchar­acteristic nine turnovers in the first half, Notre Dame still held a narrow 35-32 lead heading into half-time. 
"Their perimeter pressure brought the crowd into the game and really rattled us all night," said Coach Brey. 'Their defense made it tough for us to find open looks throughout the game." 
Rutgers' momentum at the end of the first half carried over to the beginning of the second half as the Scarlet Knights built a 10­point lead with ten minutes remaining in the game. Rutgers' half-court defense put the clamps down on the Irish offense in the second half holding Carroll to only two second-half points. Thomas was never able to get on track either. as he finished with the 17th season in a row. Notre Dame leads the series 40-16 and has taken each of the past 10. 
Purdue is 1-2 this season and ranked 53rd. The Boilermakers beat Hutter and have taken loss­es to PepperclinB and Northwestern. Purdue will face Western Michigan on Saturday afternoon in a road match before coming to Notre name. 
The Boilermakers have one singles player and one doubles team ranked. Andrew Wakefield is 101st in singles, while Scott Mayer and Dan Swan are 23rd in doubles. Last season, Purdue was 14-9 and finished 55th in the nation. 
The Irish and Boilermakers will meet for the 50th time on Sunday. Notre Dame holds a 41­8 advantage in the series and has won 11 in a row. The teams originally met in 1937 and have played in each of the past seven seasons. In 2001, the Irish gained a tight 4-3 victory. Purdue won the doubles point, but Notre Dame rallied for four singles wins -including a pair in three sets -to take the match. 
only six points, all on free throws. 
"They shut us down for a long time in the second half," said Brey. "They really went after Chris Thomas tonight. I think the law of averages caught up with Chris. He's a tough kid, and he'll bounce back." 
For the second straight game, Notre Dame had to contend with another strong physical post player. Last Saturday, Georgetown's Michael Sweetney scored 35 against the Irish. 
Tonight was Rashod Kent's tum. Kent muscled his way to 18 points, 15 rebounds. four blocks, and four steals. 
Notre Dame's interior defend­ers Ryan Humphrey, Tom Timmermans, and Harold Swanagan tried valiantly to keep the wide-bodied, 6-foot-6. 275 pound Kent from establishing inside position, but Kent was just too tough.

Irish host weekend pair 
By COLIN BOYLAN Sports Writer 
The 18th-ranked Notre Dame women's tennis team will continue its tough sched­ule, playing host to eighth­ranked Tennessee and No. 51 Brigham Young this weekend at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
Notre Dame and Tennessee will meet Saturday at 10 a.m., while the Irish and Cougars will face off Monday at 4 p.m. The match against the Volunteers will mark the third top-10 opponent faced by Notre Dame in the last four matches. 
"I think our experience against top teams this early in tho season will definitely help," said senior Lindsey Green. "The further we get into the season, the better we're going to play together." 
The Irish will need every­one to be on top of their game against Tennessee, who is ranked eighth nationally after being listed sixth in the preseason rankings. 
The Ladv Vols are 4-3 in 2002 heading into their match at Michigan on Thursday. Tennessee's losses 
Irish still only found themselves down seven points with two min­utes remaining in the game. 
When Rashod Kent fouled out, sending David Graves to the free-throw line, the Irish seemed poised to make another come­back. but they would come up just a little short in the end. Graves hit both of his free throws, cutting the Rutgers lead to five. 
Over the next minute and a half, the Irish would whittle the Scarlet Knights' lead down to one after Chris Thomas sank two timely free-throws. The Irish then quickly fouled Rutgers' Mike Sherrod with 26 seconds left. Sherrod nailed both free throws. pushing the Rutgers lead to three, 65-62. 
Out of timeouts, Notre Dame looked confused on their next position and quickly turned the ball over. With 14 seconds left, Rutgers freshman Ricky Shields missed two free throws, giving the Irish one final hope to tie the have all come to teams cur­rently ranked in the top six in the nation. 
The team boasts an impres­sive singles lineup consisting of All-American Alison Ojeda (16th in the nation). Vilmarie Castellvi (20th), Kim Gates {66th) and Agnes Wiski (77th). 
Against such a formidable lineup, the Irish will need to fully utilize their singles depth. but the team believes it's only a matter of time before that happens. 
"Everyone on this team is so good that they can play with anyone else," said Green. "rt's only a matter of having everyone in a position where they fer,! comfortable." 
The Irish and Lady Vols will meet for the 13th time and the ninth time in the past 10 seasons. Tennessee leads the series 8-4 and has won three of the last four meetings. 
The Irish arc 3-5 against the Lady Vols in the Jay Louderback era. Last year. Tennessee defeated Notre Dame 6-1 in Knoxville, Tenn. Notre Dame's only point came at No. 6 singles where Kimberly Guy gained a victo­ry. 
game. With three seconds left to go, Chris Thomas' 3-point shot from the corner rimmed out, giv­ing the Scarlet Knights the 65-62 victory. 
"We put ourselves in a position to win at the end of the game," said Brey. " Rutgers was a very confident team tonight. We gave ourselves a chance, but we just came up a little short." 
Ryan Humphrey led the way for the Irish, registering the 23rd double-double performance of his career. Humphrey finished with 18 points and 19 rebounds. Rashod Kent was the leading scorer for Rutgers with 18, while Rickey Shields chipped in 16. 
The Irish will not have a lot of time to recover from the loss. On Sunday, Notre Dame returns home to fa.ce Syracuse at the Joyce Center. The Irish will be looking to avenge an earlier 56­51 road loss to the Orangemen. 
"I love our team. We have been playing great lately," said Coach Brey. "We don't want to 
ThA Lady Vols rnturned their entire starting lineup for 2002. 
The team's Sunday match against Brigham Young does not figure to be as difficult. but the Cougars are no slouch either. 
BYU is currently ranked 51st, but a disappointing 1-4 start dropped them from their preseason position of 35. 
The Irish and the Cougars will meet for the ninth time overall and the eighth in the last nine years. Notre Dame has won five of the previous eight meetings, including each of the last three. BYU won the initial meeting in 1991. 
·Notre Dame may have home court advantage on its side. This will mark only the second trip for the Cougars to Notre Dame. In the only other visit. BYU lost 9-0 in 1999.

and triple jump. After struggling a little at the begin­ning of the season. Volkmer took first place in both events at the Meyo Invitational. 
"I am a little nervous because the first two meets were a little rough. But it's all looking uphill now," saicl Volkmer. 
The women's sprinting corps will be sending seven runners, under the senior leadership of Liz Grow, who currently holds the 111.h best time in the country in the 400-meter dash. This is the fourth year in a row Grow has made it to the conference meet. where she took second in the 400 her first two years and won it last year. Grow is also a mernbf'r of the nationally ranked mile relay team that will also be competing this weekend. 
Joining Grow in the sprinting events are Amanda Alvarez, Ayesha Royd. Kristen Dodd, Tiffany Gunn, Kymia Love and Latasha Steele. 
As a sophomore, Boyd in particular has had con­siderable success this year going into the conference meet. She took first in the 60-meter dash at the Meyo lnvilational aud is also part of the mile relay team. 
"It seems like every meet my time has gone down faster and I've matured in so many ways. l\ly goal 
[this weekend] is to get a medal in the individual races," said Boyd. 
In the distance events. Notre Dame will be sending nine women to New York: Jennifer Fibuch, Kristin Flood, Jennifer Handley, Megan Johnson, Lauren King, Kerry Meagher, Ana Morales, Jill Van Weelden and Katie Wales. 
Leading the distance team is the junior Handley who is competing in the 3,000-meter and 5,000­meter runs this weekend. 
This year Handley is only four seconds off a nationally qualifying time in the 3,000-meter. 
"I want to run my personal best this week in the 5,000 and the 3,000. That would be ideal for me. I would love to make nationals: that would be my goal right now. Hopefully we will come out on top too," said Handley. 
Rounding out the women's squad are the seven women of the field events. 
Joining Volkmer and Tameisha King will be Natalie Hallett, Jennifer Kearney, Betsy Lazzeri, Emily Loomis, and Kaitlin Meiser. Emily Loomis is less than two inches from nationally qualifying in the high jump. Kearney, Lazzeri, and Meiser join Loomis in the high jump, Notre Dame's deepest event

Behind Shay and Watson. sophomore Kevin Somok looks to get a victory at the confer­ence meet this weekend. 
"Last year as a freshman I wasn't really sure what to expect, and I was kind of wide-eyed. And this year I know what its all about and I hope to make some more noise. Certainly qualify for the final and score some points," said Somok. 
Somok is also part of the dis­tance medley team that is cur­rently ranked third in the country, but will not race this weekend. Joining Somok on the medley team are freshman Eric Morrison, Watson and sophomore James Bracken. 
Seniors Sean Zanderson, Tom Lennon, and Pat Conway add depth to the long distance corps. Zanderson, who has run a personal best 4:09 mile this year, will be running in the mile, and Lennon and Conway will most likely be running in the mile. 
Also strengthening the dis­tance team are Morrison and sophomore Todd Mobley. Morrison ran a stellar 1: 51 800-meter run against Michigan State earlier in the year, and Mobley ran a fourth­place 4:07 mile in the Meyo Mile at the Meyo Invitational.

McClain-Duer won the 500­m eter run at the Windsor Team Challenge last week and looks to improve on that this weekend. 
"I was really happy to get my first [collegiate] win. I've been getting better and better as the weeks go on. I'm hoping that I get all Big-East, that's my goal." said McClain-Duer. 
McClain-Duer also feels con­fident his team can win. 
"We have a really good chance of winning the team competition. And we have a pretty balanced distance and sprints corps. So if everyone wins like they can, we can win it," said McClain-Duer. 
In the field events, seniors Josh Heck and Quill Redwine lead the team. Heck is cur­rrmtly ranked 10th in the Big East in the pole vault. He took second in the pole vault last year. 
Redwine has been discour­aged with injuries the past two years, but he still looks to get points for the team. Last year he was having trouble with his right knee, and this year he has been having problems with his left ankle. 
The Irish will need strong performances in all events if they want to beat defending champion Georgetown. The Hoyas have kept the Irish from winning the conference meet three times, winning the con­ference meet the last four years. 
The Big East conference meet begins Friday night and concludes Saturday night.

Saint Mary's College Program in Dance presents 
By JOE HETTLER 
Spons Writer 
Saint Mary's does not want to remember the last time they faced KalamaLoo. In late January the Belles traveled to Kalamazoo and came back with a 7 4-51 conference loss. 
This time the game is at Saint Mary's, it's the seniors' last reg­ular season home game and the Belles want revenge. 
But, for the Belles to get their revenge, they need to accom­plish a few goals, one of which is trying to contain Kalamazoo's Nikki Grubb. 
''They havo a transfer that came in, she's a fifth vear senior, Nikki Grubb, who· just had a really good game against us," said head coarh Suzanne Smith. "They just put on the defensive pressure a little bit, and 
handle it. We just have to be stronger with the ball and more confident." 
The Belles will also need to rebound better which they have struggled with for most of the season. Heading into this week­end's final game. the Bel!f1s are dead last in the conference in rebounding. 
"What should help is that we have a lot more height than they du," said Smith. "They are a lit­tle bit quicker, which is what hurt us last time. So we should have some height, so lwe can] hopefully work the ball inside and bfl able to get the rflbound." 
Kalamazoo presents another problem in that they lead the conference in 3-point shooting and field goal percentage. 
Saint Mary's will try to neu­tralize Kalamazoo's outside shouting by getting the ball to their two top scores. senior co­captain Anne Blair and fresh­man forward Emily Creachbaum. Blair is coming off of a 22 point, 10-for-16 shooting performance Wednesday versus Albion. 
For seniors Blair, Jamie Dineen and Elizabeth Linkous. it will be their last home game as Saint Mary's basketball players. Everyone on the team wants to send the girls out as winners.

Irish look to extend streak without Batteast 
By KATIE McVOY 
Associate Sports Editor 
The Rutgers Scarlet Knights have a lot going for them as they head ipto a conference face-off against the Irish. They have home-court advantage in an arena the Irish have strug­gled in before, and they have a solid defense and talent that could take off at any moment. 
And the .Irish will be playing without their leading scorer. 
Notre Dame, who is on a six­game winning streak, will be playing in Saturday night's game without Jackie Batteast, who has a partially torn poste­rior cruciate ligament. She tore the ligament during Wednesday's victory against St. John's and will be re-evalu­ated on a weekly basis. 
With Batteast out of the line­up. freshmen Katy Flecky and Teresa Borton arri the proba­ble choices to start in her posi­tion. 
"Katy or Teresa, we'll go with one of those two," said Irish head coach Muffet McGraw. "We feel like we need someone who can score on the block and rebound." 
Fleckv had her first career double:double· on Wednesday off the bench, and Borton has hit double figures in scoring on several occasions this season. 
Despite the fact that playing without Batteast is not the best possible scenario, it does pro­vide some other Irish players a good opportunity to get some playing time. 
"I think everybody's ready to step up and pick their games

Rutgers (7-16, 4-8) is 11th in the Big East. However, their solid defensive play may prove to be tough competition fur the Irish. 
"They play great defense and they want a low-slwring gamo," McGraw said. "And [Wicks], [Bustamante!. and [Hecky] are more offensively­minded so I think it's going to be a great opportunity for them, hopefully if [Rutgers! plays .~one, to get a lot of threes.

Like Notre Dame, Rutgers has a sole senior this vear. Five freshmen arc on the Scarlet Knights' roster, and the fact that they're rebuilding is pretty clear. After finishing last season 25-8, the Scarlet Knights are only 7-16 this sea­son. 
But McGraw thinks that the tallrnt on thr Hutgcrs team could break out at any time, and for that reason, her team has to stay focused. 
"They're very talented," McGraw said. "They have a lot of freshmen, a lot of new play­ers and they haven't seemed to gel as a team yet. So I think they have the talent. They have the talent and at any time they 
could put it together." Tip off is at 8 p. m. on Saturday. 
Note: 
. Freshman guard Allison Bustamante is probable for Saturday. After suffering a sprained ankle in Wednesday night's game, she was on the court for prai;tice on Thursday. 
Junior guard Jeneka Joyce is still questionable for play. Still bothered by an Achilles injury, she sat out practice on Thursday.

Rutgers ends Irish streak 

 Irish blow 10-point first half lead in 65-62 loss 
By JOE LICANDRO Sporrs Writer 
What a difference a week makes. 
Last week, Notre Dame blew out Rutgers 89-72, thanks to a career-high 32-point perfor­mance by Irish freshman Chris Thomas. 
Thursday's game was a differ­ent story. 
Chris Thomas did not hit a shot from the field the entire game, as the Irish dropped a 65­62 heartbreaker to the Scarlet Knights of Rutgers in front of a raucous crowd at the Louis Brown Athletic Center. 
The loss snapped a five-game winning streak for the Irish, dropping their overall record to 17-7, and 7-4 in Big East play. 
From the opening tip-off, the Irish knew they would be in for a 
dogfight wi_th the Scarlet Knights. The loud crowd and physical play of the Scarlet Knights made for an extremely hostile environment. 
On Notre Dame's very first basket, Matt Carroll was thrown to the floor after drivi'ng for a lay-up. This type of rough play set the tone for the rest of the game as the Irish struggled to get open looks at the basket. 
"This is the first time we played on the road at an on­campus facility," said Irish head coach MikP Rrey. "Their fans made it really tough on us. Rutgers is a totally different pro­gram this season." 
In the early going, Notre Uame showed no ill-effects of fatigue coming after last Saturday's four overtime thriller against Georgf1town. The Irish appearnd to be well on thAir way to anoth­er route jumping to a quick 10­point lead with eight minutes remaining in the first half. 
Last week's reigning Rig East Player of the week, Matt Carroll, continued his sharpshooting, leading the way in the first half, scoring 13 points on 6-of-9 shooting all in the first ten min­utes of the game. 
"We got off to a great start," said Coach Brey. "I was proud of the way we came out at the beginning of the game, but the crowd and their athleticism kept them in the game." 
Rutgers quickly overcame the ten-point deficit by picking up their defensive intensity on their full-court press. A rare four­point play by Rutgers' Ricky Shields, followed by two consec­utive steals and fast break buck­ets by the Scarlet Knights, cut the Irish lead to two. 
Even though Rutgers' frenetic defensive pressure forced the

Irish men, women ready for conference meet 
. Young but experienced Irish squad hope to improve on last year's seventh place finish 
By DAYID COOK Sports Writer 

'When the women's track and field team travels to Syracuse this weekend for the Big East conference meet, it will be going with a squad that is both young and experienced. 
Of the 23 qualifiers for this weekend's conference meet, 15 are returning qualifiers from last year's conference team, and only three of the 23 women are seniors. 
Last year's team finished seventh at the meet, and they hope they can improve on that this year. 
"Last year around this time, I went into the conference meet trying to qualify lfor nationals], when now I've already qualified. 
And now I just want to perform well," said junior Tameisha King. 
King has qualified for nationals in the long jump, and she will be competing in both the long jump and the 60-meter hurdles at the conference meet. Last year, she was in the 60-meter hurdles, the long jump, and the 60-meter dash at the Big East meet. 
'Tm not as doing as many events this year. I feel I'm going to do better because of tl1at. My goals this weekend is not only to win, but to qualify Lfor nationals] automati­cally," said King. 
Junior Jamie Volkmer will be joining King in the field events. For Volkmer, this will be the third time she will travel to the confer­ence meet. 
"This year I know more about my compe­tition. and being an upperclassman I feel more comfortable and more confident this year," said Volkmer. 
Volkmer will compete in both pole vault and triple jump. After struggling a little at

. Irish look to win their first Big East Indoor conference meet 
By DAYID COOK Sports Writer 
The men's track and field team has always been right at the front. 
Since the Irish joined the Big East conference in 1996, they have fin­ished in the top three in 11 of the 12 indoor and outdoor track meets. In 2000, I.hey won the conference meet during the outdoor season. 
But the Irish are still looking for a victory at the indoor conference meet where they have taken second place four times, and third place once. This year won't be any easier. 
"When we won by 50 points in out­door [in 2000], I still wasn't confident. 
You have to look at the competition and realize that UConn is tremen­dous, so is Georgetown and Villanova. Rutgers is the team that is the most up and corning in the conference. It's one of the better conferences in the country," said head coach Joe Piane. 
Against the high level of competi­tion that they will see at the confer­ence meet, the Irish will feature a team that is one of the best they have 
. had yet. 
Leading the team is Ryan Shay and Luke Watson: two seniors who have had spectacular indoor seasons so far. Shay is currently third in the country in the 5000-meter run with a time of 13:46.80. Shay is also nation­ally qualified in the 3000. Watson holds the second best time in the country in the 3,000-meter with a time of 7:54.02.
