Scholastic must stop appeals before publication resumes 
By REGIS COCCIA Assistant News Editor 
' Scholastic will not be allowed 
~ . 
to publish until it stops appeal­ing the decision to suspend the magazine, Student Activities Director Joseph Cassidy said Tuesday night. 
''When (Scholastic) gets to a point where they can discon­tinue appeals, they can start working with (the Student Ac­tivities Office) to get a compro­mise," Cassidy said. 
''After both sides are clear on the perception (of how Scholastic should operate) , things can go on running again," he said. "It was real clear to me that everyone had a different perception of how Scholastic was operating," said Cassidy. 
Maher Mouasher, editor of the Scholastic, said "We've started a dialogue at the Office of Student Affairs with (Assistant Vice President for Student Services) Father Peter Rocca and (Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs) Sister Jean Lenz. 
"We're at a sensitive point in· the dialogue," Mouasher said. "More detailed commentary would not be in the best interest of Scholastic," he said. 
"We're trying to get the thing resolved. I don't want to hurt the magazine or say anything that would affect the magazine in an adverse way," he said. 
Cassidy said Mouasher met Tuesday with Lenz and Rocca to continue the appeals process. "We're waiting for (Rocca's) decision," he said. Cassidy added that the appeals decision is up to the Office of Student Affairs. 
Attempts to reach Rocca and Lenz were unsuccessful. 
Cassidy said the decision to suspend Scholastic from publication was completely up to himself as director of Stu­dent Activities. 
He said it was "totally my decision to suspend Scholastic from publication, until such time as they can come to clarification of their operating atmosphere." 
''I had to make an interpre­tation of du Lac and it was ap­pealed to Father Rocca. His decision was appealed to (Vice President of Student Affairs) Father Tyson and he upheld the decision,'' said Cassidy. 
"DuLac made it clear I could have removed the editors (of Scholastic), but I felt, 'What would they have learned?' "

Saint Mary's professor criticizes SMC's 'lily-white' composition 


By MARILYN BENCHIK Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 
Answering the question "If you were giving your last lec­ture, what would your final message to the world be?", Dr. David Pilgrim, assistant pro­fessor of sociology at Saint Mary's College, spoke Tuesday at the first of the Last Lecture Series. 
Pilgrim in his lecture studied the question, Why is Saint Mary's College lily-white? He first pointed out that there are "only a handful of black admi­nistrators, faculty members, and students" on campus. 
"There have been, and are, so few blacks here that it makes any statistical analysis impossible," he said. 
He explained, other colleges, some very similar to Saint Mary's, integrated their cam­puses two decades ago. They made the commitment to in­tegrate their schools, and they seriously made the effort, Pilgrim said. 
Pilgrim listed the usual ex­cuses he experiences when he suggests to administrators that the College needs to be integra­ted. One excuse he encounters is that "blacks aren't cat­holics." He said you need not be Catholic to benefit from Saint Mary's. 
"We have many non-Catholic members of the Saint Mary's family, are they uncomfortable with our religious beliefs, so un­comfortable that they want to leave?" he said. 
"Sound Catholic theology embraces the idea that all of humankind is equal in the eyes of God," he said. 
"I have talked to recruiters who admit they make no effort to visit schools with large en­rollments of black Catholics," he said. 
Another excuse Pilgrim has experienced is "blacks are too poor to attend Saint Mary's Col­lege.'' He said there is ''a dis­proportionately large number of blacks who are poor, but there is a growing and sizeable middle class." 
Since Saint Mary's "is com­mitted to giving each student enough financial assistance to cover their costs," and since the College accepts working class whites, "why don't we have any working class blacks?'' Pilgrim also ques­tioned why the College does not

rial board and the Office of Stu­dent Activities. 
Colleen Kretz, president of Pasquerilla West, proposed that the HPC "encourage (Student Activities and Scholastic) to work it out them­selves. We should table the issue until we have more spe­cific information." Kretz's mo­tion carried. 
The Office of Student Activi­ties suspended Scholastic last Sunday after Scholastic pub­lished a photograph that Cas­sidy's office had forbidden Jug­gler to print in its fall issue. 
Cassidy said Scholastic was suspended in order to be con­sistent with the decision pre­venting Juggler from publish­ing the artwork. 
HPC Chairperson J oannie Cahill began the discussion by asking for a clarification of Scholastic's editorial status relative to other student publications such as The Observer. 
Cassidy said that his office is "responsible for what happens in the Scholastic," Juggler and Dome. He said The Observer does not "go through" his office but instead receives a separate $12 fee from each student. 
Asked what Cassidy's office could do if the controversial photograph appeared in The Observer, Cassidy said he would not be responsible. 
However, Mouasher said, "Essentially, all publications are run on money that comes

Arms shipment approval is 'possible to forget:' Reagan 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Reagan suggested Tuesday that "It's possible to forget" whether he authorized a 1985 shipment by Israel of U.S. arms to Iran. 
At a meeting with business executives, Reagan was asked if he was upset about a report that he had been unable to as­certain whether he gave ap­proval for the shipment--the first in a series of clandestine sales of U.S. arms to Tehran, with some proceeds reportedly later diverted to the Nicaraguan Contras. 
"I'd like to ask one question of everybody,'' Reagan said to reporters and to the business group. ''Everybody that can re­member what they were doing on August 8, 1985, raise your hands." 
Surveying the table and fin­ding no arms outstretched, Reagan said quietly, "I think it's possible to forget. Nobody's raised any hands," and chuckled. 
The president waved off fur­ther questions, saying he would not comment further until after the Tower Commission releases its findings Thursday on the Iran-Contra arms-and­money scheme. 
In other developments on Tuesday: 
*Lt. Col. Oliver North, a key figure in the affair, asked a federal court to block the inves­tigation by a special indepen­dent counsel. The lawsuit said special counsel Lawrence Walsh has been granted prosecutorial powers in viola­tion of the Constitution and that

Tabloids: Where else can you learn about the man saved by a UFO? 

I used to consider myself a pretty well­informed person. After all, I watch NBC News and WNDU's News Center 16 every night. I read the Chicago Tribune, the South Bend Tribune and The Observer every day. I even read Scholastic, when I can get a copy of it. 
Then I went to the grocery store last weekend. To my horror, I discovered I wasn't well in­formed at all. 
There in the check-out rack sat the Feb. 24 issues of the Sun and National Examiner. 
I stared in disbelief. Right on the Sun's front page blared the headline "Girl raised by herd of goats-She eats tin cans & old rags." 
That couldn't be true, I thought. But I turned to page 25, and there it was. 
"A mysterious 11-year-old girl, who prefers a diet of tin cans and old greasy rags to normal fare like hot dogs and hamburgers, was thought to be the victim of a rare disease until it was learned she was raised by a herd of goats and picked up her odd eating habits from the vora­cious creatures. 
''A cafeteria worker in Melbourne, Australia, was the first to notice sixth grader Billie McCain's abnormal behavior when she was dis­covered munching discarded items from a dumpster behind her elementary school. 
'' 'I found her stuffing an empty can of corn into her mouth,' says stunned school employee Marcia Andrews. 'I always wondered why she never touched her lunch plate, but I never suspected she was going outside and eating gar­bage.' " 
I stopped reading and began turning through the pages. On page 8 was another shocker, this one carrying the headline, "Fisherman describes how ... UFO aliens pulled me from gator's jaws" 
"A man who thought he was doomed to die a terrible death was miraculously saved at the last possible moment--by extraterrestrial visitors in a UFO who scooped him up. 
"His nightmare began when the airboat he was piloting conked out in the middle of the Florida E;verglades. 'I thought for sure I was going to be an alligator's breakfast,' Herman Potter said afterwards." 
I put the copy of the Sun down and picked up a copy of the National Examiner (not to. be confused with that other bastion of fine jour­nalism, the National Enquirer). 
Inside, not only did I get news, but I got "Top 
Psychics' Amazing 1987'' as well.  Predictions  For  Spring

Belle Starr, an astrologer and clairvoyant 
living in Mexico, predicts" 'Wheel of Fortune' 
hostess Vanna White will reveal she has been 
taking courses at UCLA in her spare time--and 
has earned a Ph.D. in physics. She will insist 
that emcee Pat Sajak call her Dr. White.'' 
Emily Dumas, parapsychologist-lecturer of 
London and Montreal, forecasts "the new tax 
form debate will continue to rage after it is 
discovered that top IRS officials concocted the 
complicated form as part of an elaborate in­
house joke during a rowdy, well-lubricated of­
fice party.'' 

Dumas also predicts that "it will be revealed 
that President Reagan tried to combat terror­
ists in Lebanon by recruiting sexy lady spies 
to infiltrate their desert training camps. Em­
barrassed officials reveal that the plot back­
fired when the impressionable women agents 
fell in love, became pregnant, and ended up happily married.'' Wow. All of that for just $1.18. But come to think of it, I'm not sure which is 
more amazing: That $1.18 buys all of that. Or that there are people who buy all of that.

Programming Board hears from T heodores' employees 
By KAREN WEBB Copy Editor 
Assistant managers of Theodore's spoke to the Saint Mary's Programming Board Tuesday night about the club's operation and attraction to stu­dents. 
Plans for An Tostal Week were also discussed. 
Assistant Manager Laurie Bink told the board, "We have lines every weekend all the way down the stairs." 
"A lot of Saint Mary's stu­dents show up," said Assistant Manager Tom Utter. 
"We found that a big draw is free food," Bink added. 
''Mostly freshman and sop­homores go, especially fresh­men because they need a place to go," said Utter. "But I have programmed things for upper classmen.'' 
Bink said, "We used to get a lot of upperclassmen between two and three (a.m.), after the bars closed." 
But after damage to the club on a weekend night, Student Activities began closing the club at 2 a.m, Utter said. 
Bink explained that although the club is under the direction of Student Activities, it is not financially supported by the Student Activity fee payed by students. 
She said the name Theodore's was circulated around campus for advertising two years before the club opened. 

''We got the name Theodore's--we were just joking around really--because this is (University President) Father Ted's (Hesburgh) last year. No one took it seriously at first, but it caught on. He thought it was pretty funny," Bink said. 
Upcoming events at Theodore's include a Mardi Gras Ball on Feb. 27 and the "Nazz competition" on March 7, according to Utter. 

In other business, Lisa Lawler, commissioner for traditional events, previewed events planned for An Tostal. She said there are plans for the annual picnic, a "Dating Game," a "Mr. Campus" con­test, a "Timbuk 3" concert, and a canoe race on Lake Marion.

he and his staff are interfering unlawfully with the conduct of foreign policy in their investi­gation. 
* 
Lawmakers said special congressional panels inves­tigating the affair may vote as early as Thursday to grant im­munity from prosecution to several individuals believed able to shed light on what hap­pened.

* 
Fawn Hall, North's former secretary, who has been re­ported as telling Walsh's inves­tigators that she destroyed doc­uments, showed up for a brief photo session for news photog­raphers at her lawyer's office, smilingly posing but refusing to comment on the case. 

* 
Former President Gerald Ford, referring to the scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon and made Ford president, said at a Fort Wayne, Ind., appearance that "this crisis is not comparable to Watergate (and) I hope and trust it doesn't reach the stage Watergate did." 

* 
Former Reagan aide Robert McFarlane checked out of Bethesda Naval Hospital, a little over two weeks after being rushed there after a drug overdose that police called a suicide attempt. McFarlane's lawyer, Leonard Garment, said he would "go back to work and resume a normal life as much as the various investiga­tions will allow.'' 


McFarlane, who was Reagan's national security ad­viser from 1983 through December 1985, has testified that the president approved the 1985 arms shipment to Iran. 
For three months, the com­mission headed by former Sen. John Tower has been seeking to learn, among other things, the precise nature of Reagan's role in the initial stages of the program of secret arms sales. 
Reagan was questioned Tuesday in light of a published report in The New York Times. That report said Reagan's in­ability to state with certainty his role in the 1985 Israeli ship­ment of U.S. arms has compl­icated things for commission 
members  trying  to  sort  out  
conflicting accounts.  
It  was  confirmed  indepen­ 

dently that Reagan feels he is unable to say for sure whether he authorized the Aug. 30, 1985 shipment. 
Elsewhere in Washington, House Speaker Jim Wright, D­Texas, asked to comment on the Times report of Reagan's uncertainty, said, "Well, that's an appalling thing." 
Asked if he believed it possi­ble someone could have forgot­ten such a decision, he said, "I find it believable that someone might have forgotten, and if the president has a lot on his mind, maybe he did forget."

Professor says racism not to blame for problems plaguing minorities 
By JOHN KELLY News Staff 
Walter E. Williams, profes­sor of economics at George Mason University, spoke to a near capacity crowd in the Cus­hing Auditorium Tuesday af­ternoon highlighting economic problems in minority commun­ities in a lecture titled "Does racism explain everything?" 
"There is a conflict of visions on how the world operates," said Williams. "I recognize that discrimination exists." 
He said discrimination com­monly does not lead to adverse effects on the achievements of those discriminated against. He cited the historical exam­ples of the Japanese and Jews,

who have survived intense rac­ism to become some of the most prosperous groups in the United States. 
"The issue is not to justify or minimize discrimination. The point is that if discrimination does not explain everything, then instead of putting your re­sources into fighting discrimi­nation maybe there is a greater payoff in focusing your re­sources in other directions," said Williams. 
Williams spoke "in a chal­lenge to the conventional wis­dom." He characterized the civil rights vision as resting on two assumptions, that "Statistical disparities mea­sure discrimination, and statistical differences would not arise and persist without discrimination.'' 
"There are some other dif­ferences that explain . income differences among different groups that have nothing to do with discrimination,"said Wil-Iiams. 
He said the statistical dis­
parity in median incomes be­
tween blacks and whites is 
primarily due to the difference 
in median age of the two 
groups. 

"If you keep the age group under 40 and control income relevant variables then make the comparison, then you have 8 percent unexplained varia­tion. I doubt whether that 8 per­cent can be called racism," Williams said. 
He added, "One of the most 
devastating things to the eco­
nomic welfare of the black 
community is crime. A lot of 
people say it is caused by dis­
crimination; that is why there 
is so much disorder. Black 
people were more secure in 

their neighborhoods in times when there was much more dis­crimination in the United States." 
Pietrzak ticket prevails in SMC junior class run-off 
By MARGIE KERSTEN Saint Mary's Editor 
The ticke~, of Rose Pietrzak, Anne Palamaro, Barb Gullifor and Katy Burns won Tuesday's second run-off election for Saint Mary's junior class presi­dent, vice president, trea­surer and secretary, respec­tively. 
The Pietrzak ticket won 53 percent of the votes, while the opposing ticket of Christy Wolfe, Michelle Agostino, Tera Sternitzke and Lisa LaMalfa captured 46 percent of the vote. 
Speaking for her ticket, Pietrzak said, "We would like to thank our class for their continued support. Our goal is to get everyone in­volved next year and we think their eagerness throughout the election shows a great deal of prom­ise." 
According to Elections Commissioner Sandy Cerimele, 51 percent of the sophomore class turned out to vote as compared to 54 percent voting in the first election and 59 percent voting in the second election. 

"The reason that it is such a high voter turnout in spite of the two run-off elections is because of the campaigns themselves, each ticket had great ideas and also because of Jeanne Heller. Jeanne's organization has increased student awareness and par­ticipation tremendously,'' Cerimele said. 
Agostino, the opposing ticket's candidate for vice president commented on the election. "I thought it was a very well planned and fair election." Both tickets put forth an effort, she said add­ing, "We were just excited with a winner--no matter who.

"I have some smart stu­dents, and I have some stu­dents who are not committed to scholarship. The same would be true of any blacks we ad­mitted," he said.

Pilgrim said our students are denied one of the greatest joys of college in interacting with people from diverse back­grounds. "The world does not look like a Saint Mary's class­room, therefore we are cheat­ing our students.'' 
He also said administrators claim that, "blacks nationwide are not attending college as much" and "there aren't any black faculty to serve as role models." 
In answer to the first prob­lem, Pilgrim admitted there was a downward trend in black student enrollment, but "there are still thousands of blacks who would consider coming to Saint Mary's, if our house was in order.'' 
Regarding the lack of black faculty, Pilgrim admitted this is true, but it is not the black student's fault. He said there should be at least three black _faculty members. "The admin­istration must commit itself to hiring black faculty." 
Pilgrim listed proposals he said the administration needs to implement in order to in­tegrate Saint Mary's.

Program could establish independence for poor 
-----~­
-----~ 
Since Marilyn Benchik stated that the poor are as independent as we are in her Inside column (Feb. 4), a plethora of both verbal and written emotional generalizations, ranging from the poor "should touch our hearts" to "the poor are (not) lazy," have been reverberat­ing around many parts of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. Because of my ob­servations of and experiences with "the less fortunate" on my Urban Plunge in Chicago, I can honestly say that all the statements I have heard about the poor and how society mistreats them are true. Unlike many of the people making these statements, though, I do not believe that only broad statements will help the poor. Instead, I believe that once these statements are coupled with concrete, irrefutable examples and so­lutions, society will realize that many of its members are trapped in destitu­tion and are in desperate need of some proper assistance. 
Bob White 
worlds apart 

During my Plunge, I was lucky enough to see "Crisis on Federal Street," a documentary about life in the poorest (median, non-welfare in­come is $5182) and the largest (28 build­ings) housing project in the country, 
Chicago's Robert Taylor Homes. The 
program, in order to more specifically 
illustrate its message, revolves around 

th~ 28 members (a mother, 11 children 
over 18 years old, and 16 
grandchildren) of the Nash family who 
live in one five bedroom apartment and 
for whom public aid has become the 
way of life for three generations. 
Even though it analyzes at least five 
different aspects of the family's im­
prisonment in poverty, unemployment 
seems to directly affect and therefore 
unite all of the categories. Like many 
other topics dealing with poverty, 
though, this problem involves more 
than one reason for its existence and 
more than one result. 
Some reasons for the Homes high un­employment rate are: 1. Only two out of every five entering freshmen in the neighborhood schools will recieve a di­ploma. 2. Only one in 20 can read at or above the national level. 3. Many have never left their immediate area so that they do not realize that they are part of a much bigger world and that they can have an affect on it if they only became involved. 
Some consequences of the high un­employment rate are: 1. Each "per­manently" unemployed person receives one-fourth of a millon dollars in aid over a lifetime. The Nash family alone receives $78,564 a year from the federal and state goverments' food stamp, general assistance, and other welfare programs. 2. Their abilities to visualize, dream, and set goals are lim­ited because they lack the proper role models and responsibilities. 3. They do not have anything to do to occupy with so many times they resort to crime be­cause it is perceived as being very glamorous and as an easy way to obtain some quick cash. 

In order to raise the poor's self­esteem and to help them learn a skill in order to become independent of the government, Senator Paul Simon (D­Ill), who is chairman of the Senate's Employment and Productivity Com­mittee, will be proposing within the next three weeks his Guaranteed Job Opportunity Program. This program insures a government-created job for those who have been out of work for five or more weeks and sets salaries at either minumum wage for 32 hours a week, 10 percent above welfare or 10 percent above unemployment compen­sation, depending upon which of the three is highest. 
Unlike programs similar to GJOP which have failed in the past, according to Senator Simon's Public Relations Director David Carl, Simon feels that his will succeed because GJOP will take much of the control out of bureaucratic hands and place it in the hands of local committees. This way applicants will be screened and assigned a job at their 
skill level so that they are always being 
trained for a job in the private sector. 
Also, there will be greater regulation 
of the jobs in order to make sure that 
each employee is looking for employ­
ment in the private sector while filling 
a goverment-subsidized job. 

Carl says that Sen. Simon hopes 
GJOP will pass this year because "wel­
fare reform is moving from the back 
burner to the front burner.'' In order 
to help guarantee the passage of this 
bill and to demonstrate that we, the stu­
dents of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, 
truly care about the oppressed, I sug­
gest that we write either our respective 
Senators or to Senator Simon himself 
so that the members of Congress know 
that their constituents want the system 
reformed. Simon's address is 462 
Dirksen Senate Office Building Wash­
ington, D.C. 20510. 

Only three to four percent of the poor 
can ever break the cycle of destitution. 
These people are the lucky ones be­
cause they are allowed to fully experi­
ence the independence that we so often 
take for granted. Let's help raise that 
percentage by actively supporting what 
I think is the beginning of a feasible 
solution to poverty. My letter is now in 
the mail. Is yours?

Future telegram serves as warning to leaders 
Yesterday, I received a telegram. It was sent by Prescilla Hall. Prescilla and I dated some last year when I was a senior at Notre Dame. The telegram said: Tragedy struck Notre Dame last week. Stud Sneate committed suicide. I know not why. I shall write again soon. All my love, Prescilla. 
Bruce Lohman 
guest column 
So here I sit wondering why did Stud 

kill himself? I can't answer this ques­
tion, either. But, I chose to write for 
another reason. To share with you what 
I have learned from Stud. 
Stud and I never got along. We had 

different views on almost everything. 
But, more fundamentally, I think that 
we had different approaches to life. I 
always try to approach every day with 
positive thoughts. I try to ask positive 
questions. When difficulties arise, I al­
ways try to look forward rather than 
backward. How can I over come this 
problem? How can I improve this sit­
uation? 
Stud, in contrast, was always pes­simistic. Antagonism was his trusty game plan. Dozens of negative ques­tions. 
Stud feigned to be a student leader. 

So did I in my day. This game served 
me well. I learned much. I enjoyed 
thinking of myself as a student leader. 
But it was only a game. One never 
knows if that is truly the case or not. 
Doo .. 
_..,,.., 
In the end, that question is one of the 
least important. 
Stud, however, knew for sure that he was a campus leader. The campus leader, in fact. No decision or challenge was outside his realm of power. He spoke with plenty of whereas's and whereif's. His opimons were resolu­tions. He was actually quite funny at first. Soon, he became simply a nuisance. 
Seldom did Stud ever come up with an idea of his own. Rather, he read The Observer and picked issues from the headlines. Always negative. Never trusting. Stud pursued his adopted pas­sions with. the tenacity of a wounded predator. I once suggested to Stud that he could get more accomplished by be­coming a Doukhobour. He actually con­sidered it. A distorted sense of impor­tance squashed whatever misgivings he might have had about parading around in his unbashed nakedness. That would have been the ultimate sacrifice for a student leader. 
To enjoy only oneself, I believe, is impossible. Stud came as close to living this impossiblity as anyone whom I have ever met. Yet, in the end, it was he who Stud disliked the most. Unable to come to grips with the despair and frustration which accompanies the recognition of stringent limitations. In fact, Stud talked himself directly into a state of virtual impotence. 
I never felt that Stud provided any good answers to the questions of stu­dent leadership. Sadly, to the most im­portant question, Stud had his worst an-

swer. I wonder if Stud felt his act, in the tradition of the great Kamikaze pilots, would serve to improve his com­munity. 
Tragically, it is this conclusion which I want to endorse. Of course, no one is happy when we lose one of the Notre Dame family. Yet, Stud is gone now. We should learn from him as much as we can. 
I never much wanted to be like Stud. We had different approaches. It is precisely those limitations with which Stud was unable to come to terms, whose existence a student leader needs to recognize immediately. By doing so, and by bringing a positive, active atti­tude to the job, a student leader can be a true value to his community. Other­wise, as with Stud's case, you simply live a fantasy, a myth of importance which has no basis in fact. Stud lived in this fantasy world more than anyone. This game of student leadership never suited Stud well. In the end, this game cost Stud his sanity and his life. I am truly sorry to hear of his death.

Breaking the 'nuclear spell' requires ~ voice 

Last week Americans were provided a unique glimpse of a Soviet vision of nuclear war. Aired by the Turner Broadcasting Network, "Letters from a Dead Man" was originally produced and publically released in the Soviet Union. As a Soviet counterpart to "The Day Mter,'' it chronicled the destruc­tion of the Soviet society in the after­math of a nuclear holocaust. In addi­tion, it transcended the normal confines of docudrama and accomplished an aesthetic beauty and existential sensi­tivity reminiscent of Hiroshima Mon Amor and other films. 
Mike Keen 
guest column 

Perhaps most surprising to those Americans who viewed it was the lack of anti-American propaganda we all just naturally assumed would perme­ate the film. The holocaust breaks out as a result of a Soviet computer error. In retrospect, the anti-Russian tone of our own ''Amerika'' is disconcerting by comparison. 
One of the most powerful images portrayed in the film is that of a dream recounted by the author of the ''Let­ter,'' an elderly scientist who was seven seconds too late but still continues to cling to an undying hope in the survival of the human race. In the dream, he sees himself inextricably bound' to a railroad track. Bearing down upon him with ever greater presence and velocity is a huge locomotive. His last fleeting glimpse before a startled awakening is of himself, hands on the throttle, sitting in the engineer's seat. He interprets the image as humanity's complicity in its own destruction, making specific ref­erence to Soviet society and even its politicians. 
This unexpected openness and force­fulness of vision, though directed at So­viet society, also speaks to us. For we too are members of this global humanity. Following the film, Univer­sity President Father Theodore Res­burgh moderated an exchange between Soviet and U.S. experts on nuclear war. He suggested this and other such meetings were directed to "breaking the spell" which draws us ever further to the brink of such a "ghoulish destruc­tion.'' 
For a number of years now, Res­burgh has been a leading and coura­geous spokesperson, raising the issues of nuclear holocaust and venturing beyond the nationalistic boundaries which usually determine the discourse. It would seem appropriate that the 


Protection from AIDS requires advertising 
Condoms, there, I said it. OK, now that you've stifled a giggle or gasp and checked to make sure the person next to you doesn't notice you reading this, we can begin.

I. 
~ It seems that this funny little word has been in the news an awful lot lately. Many highly respected doctors are call­ing for television advertisements to tell people that the use of condoms can prevent the spread of AIDS. They believe the use of condoms to be an effective way to stop AIDS. Since abstinence is not likely to become the next sexual fad, condoms seem to be the next best line of defense against AIDS. For some people, however, con­dom ads are a problem. Just the mention of this funny little word sends moralistic people running for cover. They cover their ears and say, "I will not listen to such talk! " The mention of one funny little word (not f::ven a profane one) sends them off the deep end. Well for these people, I would like to mention another little word, except it isn't so funny: DEATH. AIDS kills, it's as simple as that. It has reached near epidemic proportions in this country. For those of you who still believe AIDS affects only homosexuals, wake up! It kills homo­and heterosexuals with equal fervor. AIDS is not a homosexually transmit­ted disease, but a sexually transmitted disease, like syphilis. Unlike syphilis, however, AIDS cannot be cured by a quick jab of penicillin. AIDS is fatal. Many people are frantically searching 
for a cure. Until they find one, preven­tion is our main line of defense against the plague of the 80s. 
Many groups believe abstinence is a method of prevention, and it is. However, for some whose moral stand­ards · are not as high as others, abstinence is not the answer. I do not wish to comment on today's morality, but, for some, abstinence is worse than death. Many would risk all for sex, and many do. It has been this way through­out time. Although these people may be immoral, can we abandon them to the ravages of AIDS? While abstinence is always a solution for some, condoms provide a viable alternative for others. 
Despite the moral opposition to con­doms, they are legal and safe to use. The question is, should they be ad­vertised on television? Will they offend viewers? Probably, but so does the average soap opera. 
The movement to advertise condoms is not based on money, rather on saving lives. That is the bottom line. Other products banned from television, such as alcohol and tobacco, are so because they are dangerous to our health. The use of condoms, on the other hand, can save lives, so why should people be kept in the dark? While it is true everyone 
knows  where  to  buy  condoms,  not  
everyone  knows  condoms  can  save  
lives.  

If the focus of condom advertising is to save lives, what is wrong with it? Although condom ads may offend some and be a sign of an ever-permissive so­ciety to others, informing people that condoms can protect you from AIDS must be done. 
Tom Varnum is a sophomore English major and a regular Viewpoint colum­
. Notre Dame community follows this 
prophetic discourse with some concrete 
action of its own. 
There are a few possibilities that 
come to mind immediately. First, we 
should stop all nuclear weapons re­
search, including SDI, carried out in 
our labs and discontinue seeking 
federal funds designed to contribute to 
such projects. These are the coals that 
stoke the fires of nuclear holocaust with 
ever more destructive and less controll­
able weapons and strategies. This is no 
easy sacrifice, for the University often 
receives 50-60 percent off the top of 
federal research grants. Our participa­
tion in the spell has been well­
rewarded. 
Second, we should begin an open ex­
amination of our endowment investi­
tures. President Dwight D. Eisenhower 
recognized that "Every gun that is 
made, every warship launched, every 
rocket fired signifies in the final sense, 
a theft from those who hunger and are 
not fed, those who are cold and are not 
clothed.'' He identified the major in­
strument of this theft as the "Iron Tri­
angle" or the U.S. military-industrial 
complex. It is this corporate political 
web that ensnares us in the spell. Its 
fires are fed by capital investments in 
such companies as General Electric, 
General Dynamics, Boeing, Lockheed, Honeywell, Texas Instuments and their many hidden subsidiaries. Again, this is not an easy task for investments in the spell, which bind and blinds humanity, have been profitable. 
Finally, we should refuse to continue to train and encouarage our students to tend the fires of destruction through our ROTC programs and monumental glorification of the military. Herein lies perhaps the greatest price to be paid in breaking the spell for it would put us in prophetic opposition to the domi­nant currents of our society. The Chris­tian tradition is very familiar with the cross such "foolish prophets" must bear. 
Nonethless, no moment could be more timely for us to embark on such a course. For, unfortunately, in our so­ciety courageous talk unfulfilled by similarly courageous action is labeled as rhetoric or charged with hypocrisy. We can help legitimize Hesburgh in his prophetic stance and strengthen his voice by choosing now, for humanity, to take the first steps in breaking the spell.

P.O.BoxQ 
Publication suspension restricts student work 
Dear Editor: 
Sunday's suspension of Scholastic is another example of our University's continued heavy-handed, inconsistent, and paternalistic approach to adminis­tration and education, education not for responsible and informed thinking, but for reliance and obedience. 
The primary issue is not the quality or imagined obsenity of Antonakna's art. At issue is the Scholastic's exis­tence as a "student publication" and a legitimate source of campus jour­nalism vs. Scholastic as the extension of our administration's paternalistic wing of protection. If Scholastic is the wing of the administration, then the Student Activities Office should end the farce of a "student publication" and give Cassidy and Father Tyson the ed­itorial credit they deserve. If, on the other hand, "student publication" is more than an empty promise to the stu­dent body, then Student Activities should have faith and trust in the judg­ment of the editors they appoint. 
Secondly, the suspension reflects an inconsistency in administration policy, and in particular the role of du Lac in student life. Despite Cassidy's evasive word-game, the action of the Student Activities Office is obviously one of cen­sorship which du Lac clearly forbids for student publications. If we as stu­dents are to place any credibility in du Lac as a whole, how are we to under­stand our administration's selective ap­peal to its law in support of their policies and beliefs. 
Finally, the use of the power-play of suspension is another example of the University's use of intimidation as an approach to problem solving. If there is a lesson that a University founded on Christian and democratic ideals should not be implicitly teaching its students, it is the use of power and supression, instead of dialogue, to solve problems. 
I am thankful that the Scholastic had the journalistic courage that the Jug­gler lacked, and I hope their suspen­sion will open our eyes to see the ab­surdity of a censured "student publication," and the paternalism and 

inconsistency of  our University's ad­ 
ministration.

WVU shocks No.5 Temple 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -Tyrone Shaw scored 16 points and West Virginia used an effective box­and-one defense to upset No.5 Temple 64-61 in an Atlantic 10 basketball game Tuesday night, snapping the Owls' 15­game winning streak. 
Besides having the nation's longest current winning streak ended, Temple also suffered its first home loss in 34 games and first conference loss of the season.

Enough sympathy for the rest. 
Tonight's game features the heavyweights of the mythical Great Independents. DePaul's Joey Meyer is now leading the candidates for Coach of the Year, instead of Overmatched Son Pretending to be a Coach of the Year. Dallas Comegys has finally shown some im­provement from his freshman season, after two seasons where his intensity was fre­quently AWOL. And · Rod Strickland has shown marked improvement from his super rookie season. With the rest of the players filling roles ad. mirably these Demons have made all but one of their oppo­nents blue thus far. 
The Irish, on the other hand, have made concession stands a big money-maker at every arena they play by keeping every fan until the game's end. They have survived enough buzzer-beaters to make Head Coach Digger Phelps go through his whole wardrobe. But it is doubtful that Phelps minds a little thread-ripping -in return for the performance he has received from this year's edition. 
With a few disappointments aside, the West Vire:inia yawner and UCLA fiasco come to mind, Phelps finds it hard to suppress his happiness with his team this year. 
With both teams headed straight for the NCAA Tourna­ment, there seems to be little at stake. But these two almost­conference foes have a good rivalry going and have had some very memorable clashes in the recent past. Besides, Phelps has already assured that it will be another classic. 
Another upset at the ACC? Weren't wins over Duke and North Carolina too much to ask for already? Under normal cir­cumstances, I would say so. But when the Amateur Athlete of the Year competes in some­thing called the heptathlon, these obviously aren't normal circumstances.

Ellery chooses ND 
Associated Press 
SPRINGFIELD, Ky. ­Washington County High School basketball standout Kevin Ellery, who is among the state's leading scorers this season and a candidate for Mr. Basketball, verbally committed to Notre Dame on Tuesday. 
Ellery, however, cannot sign a national letter-of­intent until April 8. 
Ellery said that after visit­ing the Notre Dame campus in South Bend, Ind., earlier this month, he decided playing for the Fighting Irish would be the right move. 
"I feel it's the best place for me," Ellery said. "I think I can play there.'' 

International Week Continues:

Thurs: FRANCE

He was also recruited by Georgia, Auburn, Western Kentucky, Eastern Ken­tucky and Morehead State. 
Ellery, a 6-foot-5, 230­pound forward, has averaged 29.8 points and 9.5 rebounds per game this season in leading Washing­ton County to a 20-4 record, scoring at least 20 points in each of those games. 
He has scored in double figures in 84 of the 86 varsity games he has started since his sophomore year, includ­ing the last 58 in a row. 
Ellery said now that he has committed, he can con­centrate on trying to lead Washington County to the state basketball tournament next month.

the second period (.440) after a red-hot first half (.606). They also shot well from the foul line, hitting 20-of-24 for an .83 clip. 
The Irish wrapped up their home season with the victory over the Huskies, finishing 7-6 at the ACC. It was the third straight victory for DiStanis­lao's team, making it their longest winning streak of the year. 
"We want to keep playing the way we have been," said DiS­tanislao of her team's remain­ing games. "We want to bal­ance our scoring and keep up the inside game." 
The Irish have Marquette, Wisconsin, and Dayton road games left on the schedule. 
IRISH ITEMS: Although it was the final home game of the season, there are no senior players on the Irish, leaving the ceremony for next year. . .

Pasquerilla East stays on top as IH basketball nears finals 
By KEVIN McCORMACK Sports Writer 
The playoffs have not yet begun for the women's inter­hall basketball league, but with only one more round of games remaining in the regular season, action has heated up to post-season levels. 
Leading the pack all season has been Pasquerilla East, who going into Thursday night's final regular season contest, boast an undefeated season thus far. On Monday night at the ACC, P.E. played once­beaten Farley A and ran away with a 48-32 victory. Things didn't go exactly as planned, however, at least in the begin­ning. 
"We got behind early, 10-3," explained P.E. captain Regi Richter, who fininshed with 12 points, "and we also knew that Farley was going to be one of the toughest games of the season. When we were still down by one at the half we knew we had to regroup." 
In the third quarter, however, P.E. went on an early 8-0 run and never looked back. In the fourth quarter, P .E. broke open a close game and cruised to a relatively easy 16­point victory. 
In another key women's in­terhall contest on Monday night, Breen-Phillips' poor second-half performance doomed them to a 32-21 loss at the hands of Lyons. B.P. got out to a 13-8 lead at halftime, but went absolutely cold in the third quarter, scoring no points. In the fourth, B.P. was able to manage eight, but it was too little too late. Missing from that game for B.P., however, was leading scorer and rebounder Anne Curoe. 
Rounding out the action, Far­ley B defeated Badin 56-48 in a high-scoring affair, while Lewis A defeated Lewis B in a rout, 44-11. On Thursday, the key game of the night will be Lewis, defending interhall champion, against Lyons. The winner will apparently join B.P., P.E., and Farley in the playoff rounds beginning on March 1st.

siree. They have ceremoniously dubbed themselves, along with Marquette and Dayton, the Great Independents. In the reality of college basketball, they're more like the last of the Mohicans. 
With little regard for other independents, the Great In­dependents have gone about discussing a possible confer­ence. The vote is almost split among the four, however, with Notre Dame as the most vocal member disdaining the notion of the need for a conference. 
The Irish feel the current contract among the indepen­dents calling for a home-and-home with each of the others, a three-year deal which ends after this season, provides them with a conference-rivalry atmosphere without bin­ding them to conference restrictions. Kind of like great coffee taste without the caffeine. 
But this attitude helps only Notre Dame and DePaul. Both teams have some notable opponents dotting their schedules to cover for some of the less-than-awe-inspiring ones. Marquette and Dayton, however, get lost in the shuffle. 
They have not been as successful in luring top-notch conference foes to their schedules. Independents face the greatest difficulty, with many holes to fill and limited openings on conference teams' agendas. While Notre Dame and DePaul can attract teams by virtue of their high rankings in the recent past, teams like Marquette and Dayton slowly drift a little farther down the list. 
Once this trend starts, it is hard to stop. Great intersec­tional games on national television have enormous appeal with recruits, and consequently, the rich do get richer. This snowballing effect lands the top independents in the NCAA Tournament consistently, and the next echelon bat­tling with winners of the ECAC Metro, South, North and, whatever other direction they think of, for the precious few remaining tournament spots.

Irish jump out to big lead, hold on to paste UNI, 82-66, in ACC finale 
By THERESA KELLY Sports Writer 
Thanks to a quick start, the Notre Dame women's basket­ball team overwhelmed the Huskies of Northern Illinois 82­66 last night at the ACC. 
The Irish, in improving their record to 9-15 on the season, played one of their best games of the season, using their ad­vantages and following their game plan to precision. 
Two quick baskets by Diondra Toney and Annie Schwartz put the Irish up 4-0, and head coach Mary DiStanis­lao's team never looked back. Every Notre Dame starter had scored by the time just over five minutes had elapsed in the first half, and the Irish built up a 17-point lead (27-10) with 
11:07 left before the intermis­sion. That big lead was estab­lished thanks to an 11-point run midway through the half. 
The Huskies, however, managed to keep the game respectable, trading baskets with the Irish through the latter part of the first period and get­ting the Irish lead down to 13 at the break. The tough Notre Dame defense held the Huskies to .400 shooting in the first half and .405 (30-of-74) for the game. 
Another Irish run, this time for 10 points, put them ahead 57-34 with 14:06left in the g,ame to bury Northern Illinois' chances at a comeback. Notre Dame repeatedly worked to get good shots from the open players, keeping the Huskies behind by double figures throughout the second half. 
The victory was sweet revenge for the Irish, who lost 81-71 to Northern Illinois on January 13. What made last night's game different from that of five weeks ago? 
"The girls made the decision to come out and play the best game they could,'' said DiS­tanislao. "We are a different team now because we are going into the games with a plan. We are anticipating the game we want to play, rather than just reacting to the other team's plan." 
Irish sophomore forward Heidi Bunek played a nearly flawless game, shooting 9-of-16 from the floor and 9-of-11 from the free-throw stripe for a team-high 27 points. That sum was two short of her career high of 29 set earlier this season. She also pulled down 16 rebounds, tying her personal best, which also ties the Notre Dame single-game record. 
"Heidi just keeps playing well for us," said DiStanislao. "She continues to put herself into the right position to get the ball, both to score and to get the boards. She and (center Sandy) Botham are getting more and more comfortable playing together.'' 
Notre Dame continued to ex­ploit its height advantage against opponents, getting 14 points from 6-3 Annie Schwartz and 14 points and 13 rebounds from the 6-2 Botham. 
"We've played them before," said DiStanislao. "We knew we had to get the ball to our big girls on the reverse. That was our plan, and it worked." 
The triple towers also played well defensively, holding the tallest Huskie player, 6-1 Tammy Hinchee, to just six points, almost 10 below her season average. 
Toney also chipped in 14 points for the Irish, shooting 6­of-10 from the floor and 2-of-2 from the line. Notre Dame guard Mary Gavin had 9 assists and six rebounds for the home team. 
As a team, the Irish shot .535 from the field, slowing down in

The Observer Royal turns raw skills into team leadership 
By RICK RIETBROCK Sports Writer 
Donald Royal, the raw talent, has evolved into Donald Royal, the com­plete player. Notre Dame's senior for­ward currently leads the Irish in scoring (14.7) and rebounding (6.5) and remains as one of the team's top defenders. The road from green fresh­man to savvy senior has been a consis­tent and steady trip for Royal. 
Adding components to his game in bits and pieces, Royal has complemented his strong inside game with great im­provements in his free throw shooting and defense. In his final season, he has also helped his offensive firepower with a consistent jump shot, one that Head Coach Digger Phelps credits with opening up the offensive game for the Irish. 
"He's been the type of guy that can make things happen for us inside," Phelps says. "But the thing we've let him do lately, because he's ready to do it, is go outside, facing the basket, and shoot the jump shot. That adds a whole new dimension to our offense, opening all kinds of things up and that causes a lot of problems for the other team." 
The addition of the outside game has increased comparisons to former Irish and current NBA star Orlando Wool­ridge, whose development took a path similar to Royal's. But Royal compares himself to a more recent former Irish star, Ken Barlow. 

''A lot of people say I remind them of Kenny and me along the same way, Woolridge, but it's odd because I have starting us out slow and then giving us never even met him," Royal says. "It more responsibility. It seems we have seems as though (Phelps) brought both been accomplishing the same things, like winning the Most-Improved Player award our sophomore years." 
But it took a while for Royal to get people's attention. He led St. Augustine High School in New Orleans to a 35-0 record and the Louisiana state cham­pionship his senior year, but his statis­tics, 12.7 points and 14.2 rebounds per game, did not turn a lot of heads. But Gary Brokaw, then an Irish assistant, found him in an AAU summer league and he saw what Royal believed he had all along, major-college potential. 
"I played against most of the nationally-known guys and I played pretty well against them," the 6-8, 210­pound senior says. "I knew I belonged with them." 
Royal has proved that with Irish. He arrived for good in the second half of his sophomore campaign. Royal started the last 16 games and finished averaging 9.1 points and 5.5 rebounds a game. 
Royal increased his value as a junior, by continuing to raise his scoring (10.6), and joining Dolan for Notre Dame's top defender award. In his senior year, Royal (who is still just 20 years old) has continued to round out his game. His consistent inside production, im­proving outside game, and thunder­dunks remain, but, in addition to his steady statistical improvement, Royal has emerged as a strong leader, sharing co-captain's status with Scott

ND seeks next ACC victim with 'classic' against DePaul 
By BRIAN O'GARA 
Sports Writer 
Once again a nationally-ranked bas­ketball team comes to Notre Dame, hoping to depart unscathed. Twice this month the Irish have had such visitors, but North Carolina and Duke both discovered the perils of the ACC and left with one more in the loss column. This time the chal­lenge is closer to home. 
Tonight, fourth-ranked DePaul brings its show to town, sporting a 25-1 record and a nine-game winning streak. The Blue Demons feature two legitimate all-America candi­dates in senior forward Dallas Com­egys and sophomore playmaker Rod Strickland. In DePaul's win over Georgia Tech Saturday, Comegys and Strickland both registered per­sonal scoring bests with 33 and 28 points, respectively, leading the Blue Demons to a 84-67 victory. 
The Notre Dame-DePaul series has provided for one of the most il­lustrious rivalries in the Midwest, dating back to the first meeting in 1912. The Irish hold a 43-31 edge in the series, but the most recent game is the one on the mind of Notre Dame head coach Digger Phelps. 
"What we remember about the DePaul game is being up one with a minute to go," said Phelps, "and that is where we want to pick up." 
The game Phelps is referring to is Notre Dame's 59-54 loss to the Blue Demons on January 10 in Chicago. In that contest, the lead changed 18 times before DePaul scored seven points in the final minute and hung on to keep their 12-0 record un­blemished. 
The Blue Demons are currently 25-1, while the Irish pulled out a 57-56 vic­tory over Utah on Saturday to bring their record to 17-7. This win came without Notre Dame's outside scoring threats Scott Hicks and Sean Connor. Both players resumed prac­tice on Monday and are expected to

Hicks. 
''My role this year is as a leader," he says. "I have to go out there and perform every game. The younger guys are looking at me and Scotty and if we go at it with less than a total effort, then they'll go about it the same way." 
And that leadership role has turned him from pupil to teacher for the next in line, Tony Jackson, whom Phelps has compared to the Woolridge-Barlow-Royalline. 
"I'm just trying to keep his con­fidence up and let him know I went through the same things," Royal explains. "We've all been through it, so I just let him know that when his turn comes, he's got to suck it up and make the best of it.''

Royal has also been trying to make the best of his upcoming opportunities. The government major has done his interviews prior to the season and says he is thankful for the variety of careers Notre Dame has made available to him. 
"That's the best thing about this university and our basket­ball program," he says. "The coaches make things very real­istic so you know there are other avenues. If I have to work in front of a desk, I'm ready." 
But Royal would like to give pro basketball a shot first. With the aid of trainer Skip Meyer, Royal has recovered from a calf injury that caused him to miss four games, and his prospects of playing in the NBA are now better than ever. 
"I'm going to get the opportu­nity, and t-hat's all I can ask," he says. " From there, it's up to me. It's always been a dream of mine to play in the NBA, and I'll have the oppor-

tunity to prove I can play there." 
Phelps says Royal can be very successful in the pro ranks if he enters the proper situation. 
"He'll be a sleeper in the draft," Phelps says. "He's going to be one of those guys that if the right team will take him, he's going to make it for a long time, because he funda­mentally sound and he's been through the wars." 
But before he attempts to enter the wars for pay, Royal will lead the Irish, a team he says he is proud of, down the home stretch. 
"The teams before this year were expected to win, but this year we surprised a lot of people," he says. "When people looked at the schedule at the beginning of the year, they already marked down losses to North Carolina and Duke before we even played. This team is full of surprises."

DePaul

return to the lineup for tonight's game. 
The Irish will have their hands full with Comegys and Strick­land. Comegys, who has asserted himself as DePaul's leader in his final season, is averaging 17.5 points and 7.6 rebounds a game. Strickland · led the Blue Demons last season as a freshman in scoring (14.1 points), assists, steals and minutes played. The flashy point guard is scoring 
16.5 points per outing this year while running the fast-paced and high-scoring DePaul of­fense. 
"Comegys has got a great 
chance to be player of the year," said Phelps. "You can talk about Alford and Kenny Smith but when it comes to big guys, nobody has done what Comegys has in situations where he is surrounded with de­fensive pressure. Yet, he still gets to the boards and scores · his points. He's got to go in the first five picks of the first round in the NBA because he is so flexible." 
"Strickland as a sophomore has taken that team to where they have the confidence to do the things that have to be done," added Phelps. · 
But neither of these two big guns are the key to DePaul's outstanding season, according to Phelps. This designation goes to junior guard Kevin Ed­wards, a junior college trans­fer. 
''They've got the ingredients of a great cake, and he puts the icing on that cake that just not be known until the Irish and Blue Demons play forty minutes (or more) of basket­ball tonight. But with the excel­lent play of both teams recently and the magic generated in the ACC during big games this season, one would tend to agree with the words of a Phelps statement in his Monday press conference. 
"It'll be a classic in the tradi­tion of Notre Dame basket­ball." 
makes it look perfect," said Phelps of Edwards. "That's the guy who gets the key jumps shots, the key steal or shuts someone down. Or he gets a rebound and the next thing you know Comegys will get six straight points or Strickland will take off in transition. But it all started because Edwards got the steal or the rebound. Some of those things don't get into the box scores." 
"I think DePaul is playing al­most near perfection," said Phelps. "They just have a lot

of confidence. You take Nevada-Las Vegas, Indiana, North Carolina and DePaul. These are the teams that could be ending up in the final eight. DePaul has a chance to go to the Final Four, and that's a credit to (Blue Demon head coach) Joey (Meyer), who in my opinion should be coach of the year." 
Since replacing his father Ray, the DePaul coaching legend who won 724 games as DePaul's head coach from 1942 to 1984, Joey Meyer has coached the Blue Demons to three-straight NCAA Tourna­ment appearances. He seemed to be lingering in his father's shadow, however, until this season. There -should be no more doubts that he is the one · calling the shots now. And evi­dently his shots, like those of his players, are on target.

Irish knock off No.1 Blue Demons 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
On the surface, Notre Dame big man Orlando Woolridge stopped DePaul's bid for a perfect season in February of 1980, by sinking a pair of free throws with 19 seconds left in the second overtime period. 
But if ever a game at the ACC was won by the famed "Sixth Man," more-commonly known as the Notre Dame crowd, it was this 76-74 victory. 
Irish guard Bill Hanzlik tied the contest at 74-74 with 2:30 left to play in the second extra segment and rebounded a miss by the Blue Demons' Terry Cummings with the clock showing 1:49. 
That's when Notre Dame head coach Digger Phelps, the then 20-5 Irish and that big Sixth Man made their move. 
Phelps, in an effort to keep DePaul's quick~handed guard Clyde Bradshaw away from the ball and another steal, inverted his team's offense against Demon coach Ray Meyer's man-to-man defense. Notre Dame guard Rich Branning took Bradshaw into the corner on the baseline, as Woolridge, Kelly Tripucka and Tracy Jackson -the front line -moved out to handle the ball. 
"We're pretty good ballhandlers," said Tripucka, who hit 11-of-18 shots and led the game in scoring, along with DePaul's Mark Aguirre, with 28. "We felt we could handle the ball man-to-man against their center and forwards. 
Besides, Clyde deserved to be buried in the corner because he gives us so much trouble." 
With the clock ticking down under a minute, Meyer and his assistants were calling for Bradshaw to switch and go out to play defense in the backcourt, but he was not able to hear the instructions over the capacity crowd of 11,345. 
"We kept calling for Clyde to switch," said Assistant Coach Joey Meyer, "but Clyde couldn't here because of the crowd noise.'' 
With Bradshaw out of swiping range, Cummings commit­ted his fifth foul against Woolridge and Notre Dame took 
the lead. 
James Mitchem, playing with a taped, broken left hand, fired a 20-footer for the Demons with time running out, and Bradshaw missed with a desperation shot off the rebound. 
Once again, a number-one team had fallen to Notre Dame at the ACC, and the crowd responded with chants of "25 and one, 25 and one," the Blue Demons' updated record. 
"The electricity was here all week," Phelps said. "Don't 
ever come in here undefeated or No. 1 against Notre 
Dame."
