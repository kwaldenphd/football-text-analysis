Nixon sends troops to post office 
(United Press International) 
President Nixon, declaring a state of national emergency, yes­terday ordered 2,500 servicemen to help deliver mail in New York City and promised to send troops to other cities unless the mailmen end their wildcat strike. 
Eleven hundred Army troops at Ft. Dix, N.J.. immediately started for New York by bus but one postal union official said it 
would take nine months for the Gls to learn the job. 
Nixon authorized Defense Secretary Melvin R. Laird to call into active service for an indefi­nite period "any or all units of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard" necess­ary to restore normal mail deli­veries. 
In South Bend, the mail ser­vice continued as usual except that delivery to embargoed areas have been held. Among areas completely embargoed are the entire New York City metro­politan area, most of New Jer­sey, all of Connecticut; and parts of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wis­consin, Minnesota, and Illinois. 
All 2nd, 3rd and 4th class matter was under embargo for the Chicago area, but Post Mas­ter Granville Ziegler, in an article in the South Bend Tribune, said that first class mail was not being affected. 
But the 2,500 men ordered to New York late Monday after­noon were regulars from Ft. Dix, McGuire Air Force Base, N.J., and Marines and naval person-

Scholastic editor named 
Steve Brion assumes post 
by Mike Mooney Steve Br~on, a Junior English Major from Lindenhurst New York has been named the new Editor of the Scholastic. With the exception of Man aging Editor, the other editorial positions on the Scholastic are yet to be filled. The newly named Managing Editor is freshman Phil Stark from Poughkeepsie, New York. Brion's first issue as editor-in-chief will be the May 8th edition. That edition will be the first regular issue of the Scholastic fallowing the Easter break. The course evaluation book will be published between Easter and May 8th. Brion's application for the position was accepted last week by the magazine's Board of Directors consisting of Associate Economics Professor Father Ernest Bartell, Communications Arts Associate Professor Ronald Weber, and senior William Mitchell. Brion noted that the essential defference between the ,Scholastic and the Observer was the gre;~ter freedom afforded to 
the Scholastic by its magazine format. 
"we have alot more freedom to cover things in depth," said Brion." "A magazine can go behind to seek out motives." 
The new editor viewed favorably what he considered a shift in outlook in this year's magazine under Rich Moran from the previous editions. "Rich tried to cut down the polemics," Brion stated. "He tried to offer a form of cultural expression." He added that there "will be times when the magazine will speak out," but he was opposed to letting the Scholastic "slip into easy polemics." Brion saw his principal problem as "getting people into the magazine." He admitted that the relatively large amount of copy in each issue "scared some people away," but felt that the subject matter of the magazine required longer 
stories. "I don't want to sacrifice the quality of the magazine to 
achieve  a wider audience," said  
Brion.  "The  problem  is  to  
widen  the  audience  without  

Hardin favors legal abortion 
by Mike Chapin 
"I would'rather not be born. than to be born without human dignity." This was the theme of 
Dr.  Garrett Hardin's lecture on  
the  subject  of  abortion  which  
has  been  "brought  out  from  

undern-eath the taboo where it had been for a few hundred years." 
Dr. Hardin, professor of biolo­gy at the University of California at Santa Barbara, delivered the first of his three lectures in the 1970 Nieuwland Lecture Series in Biology last night in the li­brary Auditorium. 
Dr. Hardin will give two other lectures this week. Today at 4 
p.m. he will give a lecture titled "We Must Choose" in the Librar­y, an application of the general principles gleaned from the abor­tion movement to broader prob­lems involving life and death. Wednesday he will give "The Courage to End Life," the dan-

gers of a gerontocratic society. 
A proponent of population control, Dr. Hardin said that in 1963 he could not even say the word abortion easily in a speech. Today, it is only a matter of a · few years before abortion will be legal everywhere in the United States, he said. Hawaii has legal­ized abortion almost without restriction. Also, Arizona, Vir­ginia, Maryland and New York are all in some stage of legalizing abortion, Dr. Hardin said. 
"The second thing that has come in to make people far more sympathetic to the idea of abortion than they used to be has been the growing concern with the tragedy of unwanted children. We once had a pleasant myth that once a woman had a child she automatically loved it and wanted it and treated it tenderly from then on. We know now that this simply is not true," Hardin said. 
He explained that there was a "Battered child syndrome" in the United States where many children are beaten and mal­treated sometimes with the par­ent not even being aware hecause he is not wanted. Planned parenthood and abol­ition of compulsory pregnancy would eliminate the unwanted child from our society, accor­ding to Hardin.

As for future subject matter, Brion commented that the magazine would continue to speak out on the University's priorities and felt that he was in "basic agreement" with the position this year's editors had taken. 
The new Editor saiji he would like to use more graphics to break up the copy, but added that graphics are expensive. 
Brion also said that he believed the magazine had a duty to serve the students. For this reason, he saw a continuation of the movie guide section of the magazine and continued publication of the Scholastics Course Evaluation booklet. 

H PC selects committee reps. 
by Pat Dermody 
The Hall President's Council met last night to elect three presidents to sit on the Constitu­tional Revision Committee for Student Government. They chose Phil Defliese, Flanner Hall President, Mike Lindburg of Breen-Phillips and Tom Suddes, 
President  of  Holy  Cross  and  
Chairman  of  the  HPC  to  the  
committee.  

Next the presidents came to an agreement regarding room as­signments for the departing resi­dents of Carroll Hall. They agreed to give room selection priority to the present Carroll residents only after all resident undergraduates have chosen their rooms in the respective halls, but before the university­wide room picks conducted by the Office of Student Accounts. 
The group also agreed however, that, at the discretion of the individual halls, seniors to be from Carroll could receive consideration before hall resi­dents of younger classes. Thus some halls might decide that a Senior to be from Carroll Hall could pick after the seniors of the hall but before the other classes. 
In addition to this, Rev. Edgar Whelan, Director of Student Residence, noted that "the uni­versity will be 200-300 beds short next fall and this will allow juniors and seniors to be to seek off-campus housing with written

parental consent." 
However, this estimate came only from the figures compiled by the hall presidents and is not necessarily final. If there is a greater shortage, provision may be made to allow Sophomores to be to move off campus. 
It was also decided that stu­dents returning from study abroad will be given the same priority as Carroll Hall residents. 
Following this, the group dis­cussect hall security problems re­lating to the Alumni Hall inci­dent last weekend. They also decided to take steps to stop town children who have been looting rooms and taking charity donation containers. 
John Barkett, Morrissey Hall president, was named to head the group which is to draw up the rationale for Hall Life to be presented to the Student Life Council. 
Concluding the meeting was a brief word of thanks from Tony Scolaro, the Muscular Dystrophy representative. He said he was very pleased with the $750 col­lected thus far, and he told of plans to give a Hall by Hall ace ount of donations after Easter vacation. 


Diet control 

"Dietary Control of Choles­terol Metabolism -A Study in Microbial Ecology," will be the subject of an address delivered at 
12:30 p.m. tomorrow in Room 141 of the Radiation Research Building. 
Dr. Thomas F. Kellogg, pro­fessor of microbiology, will ex­plain how tiny micro-Qrganisms in the intestines help control levels of cholesterol in the blood, and the relationship of diet to the functioning of these microbes.

represented and should be in agreement. We're aware that the staff program is a great deal. No one else on campus gets to eat on work time or has sick time off. But no one else has an agreement as we do. We're a unique group." 
In commenting on the Staff student changes, Msgr. McGrath stated that in the past three or four years many abuses have entered the program. "The food service was very bad, and the girls refused to cooperate with the manager. So, I called the girls together and announced that the program was ending. I stated that I would fulfill my­contract with each of them, but that they must fulfill their part also. It is an impossible situa­tion." 
The entire program is being stopped because it is too expen­sive but the girls presently on the program will be allowed to stay on the programs they signed up for until they graduate. 
"It is not a change in the program, but correction of abuses which have entered it," Msgr. McGrath emphasized.

Editorial: 
Staff Student problem 
l11e Staff Student Program at St. Mary's is a unique program which has been in existence for the past forty years. It has operated during this time on a verbal agreement between the college and the student allowing the student to work her way through school with no financial hangover when the student graduated. 
The new contract which the college has presented for the student's signature is in Msgr. McGrath's terms "a correction of an abuse," and in the eyes of the Staff Students a "correction of one abuse with a larger abuse." 
While we agree that the Staff Program is too expensive to be continued, and should be gradually phased out, we also agree with the students' objections to parts of the proposed c"bntract to be used in the interim. 
The first student contention that the proposed contract 
jeopardizes the student's academic life appears valid both 
for the student and the college. By cutting down the 
number of hours the student is able to carry, the staff 
student must stay at St. Mary's longer, causing a financial 
burden on the academic life of the staff student, and thus 
extend financial burden on the college. 
Secondly, the question of not allowing students to 
include sick time in their earning time appears to us a 
danger rather than a correction of an abuse. It creates an 
opportunity for students working on staff who fear loss of 
earning time to come to work and cause possible con­
tamination of food and possible infection of fellow 
students. 

Finally the college's demand that the students no longer 
elect their own student supervisors seems unreasonable and 
of no useful purpose. It would seem that if a student 
supervisor is necessary, then it should be someone whom 
the staff students would respect, could work with, and 
who is in the same situation. Therefore the most equitable 
situation would be for the girls to elect their own 
supervisor, rather than someone appointed by the Food 
Service Director. 
Therefore we feel that the complaints of the Staff 
Students at St. Mary's are valid ones worth considering. 
The contract as it is proposed contains no job descriptions, 
and seems an ambiguous attempt on the part of the 
administration to control a situation which has existed for 
the past forty years.

Rational attitude 
Editor: 
Last Saturday I attended the lecture of Mr. Kunstler prepared to be shocked and dismayed at some of the revelations and atti­tudes that he brought forth. To my edification, however, Mr. Kunstler showed himself to be a reasonable man, sincerely con­cerned with the future of our country. Nevertheless, I did come away shocked and dis­mayed-at many_ of our Notre Dame students. 
In particular, I am speaking of that point in the lecture in which Mr Kunstler prophesied to what dire resorts the people will be driven to if the judicial and legislative bodies (;Ontinue to be as unresponsive to the needs of the nation as they now seem to be. As he described the grim procession from picketing the courthouse to finally 'burning it down, I looked up in disbelief to see many clapping and shouting their approval-louder with each succeeding step. Rather than shuddering at the thought that such means should ever become necessary and wondering how that might be avoided, a good portion of the audience was voicing loud enthusiasm for the violence being described. 
Can this be called a rational attitude? I agree that there is a need for change and I see that violence may become a neces­sary evil in obtaining it. But neer will I stand up and cheer the name of violence. Even Mr. Kunstler felt that the day when courthouses must be burned to the ground has not arrived and need not necessarily. But if the attitude that I sensed last Sat­urday is prevalent among even our college students (and I pray that I am mistaken), then that day is much closer than you think, Mr. Kunstler!

Lapses 

Editor, 
On Saturday, I went out on the Stepan Center Field to watch our Lacrosse team play against the Cincinnati Lacrosse Club_ Most of the spectators went away with a good feeling, as N.D. won in overtime. For those of us who had to go by way of the east side of the field however, another example of th~ "Notre Dame Man" ruined the victory. A number of "NO Men" and their young ladies were treating the fans to a great show of that favorite NO pastime, irresponsibility. Beer bottles (at least 24, to my count) with cartons, of course, were neatly scattered all over the sidelines. When asked to pick up their tidy mess, the NO Men gallantly said "Do it yourselves!" 
Informing the security guard of the incident, we were told "We'll do something about it." The security guards now have the license plate numbers of the NO Men. What will happen to the trash remains to be seen. Sunday afternoon, it was still there, making Notre Dame even a more beautiful place to be. 
Sincerely, Jim Lehner

I was around then and I can't believe I would not have been sensitive to such extreme measures, espec­ially since I once was assigned to interview a conscientious objec­tor for the military. I was impressed by the consistency with which he represented his scruples and attested his sincer­ity to pertinent authority. 
I am certain that my recall of this incident would be much more vivid if his life had been in jeopardy. If The Observer is cor­rectly informed, then I am guilty of a shocking lapse of memory. 
I won't presume to suggest the degree of editorial irrespon­sibility if Mr. Hampton's asser­tion is false. 
Sincerely yours, 
D.C. Grant

TUESDAY, MARCH 24, 1970 THE OBSERfiER. 
'' A Servant of Two Masters;'' great fun 
by David Allen Edmonds 
The Feminine Liberation Movement just got a big shot in the arm from the unlikely source of a sixteenth-century Italian playwright. Carlo C.oldoni's The Sert'llllt nf Two Masters explored this phenomenon and other h umerous areas of current interest in last weekend's remarkahle production by the ND-SMC Theatre. 
(;oldoni's work is the typical contrived comedy. The plot is terrifically impro­bable, full of complications and sub-plots, and mistaken identities. But it is also very easy for the audience to predict what will happen next: boy and girl are in love, a crisis separates them, they're reconciled and everybody gets married. You have seen all these things happen before, but for the same reason they are still funny. 
The reason that it is still funny, and extremely funny, is that the Director, Miss Karen Huber, perfectly understood the mood of the play, and directed it to further that mood. It is a comedy full of motion, interesting characters and inter­woven actions. Her cast is always moving, always acting and reacting. Gaps or pauses in the script have been filled with takes, glances, asides and sight gags. Even the stage hands have personalities that are carried out whenever they appeared on stage. The author has written a play that wanders all about but reaches a conclu­sion that leaves no loose ends. Miss Huber's production follows that same idea in that it never lets up -the action is continuous from beginning to end. ller characters are alive and energetic. 
The production began with a panto­mime set to music that, if watched closely, revealed the major actions of the play. This was extremely effective, for it set the tone of the play as light and happy, and function, as it ended in a freeze with the opening characters in their place, ready to go. Another techni­que that was good because it sustained 
action and mood was the scenery and the way it was changed. Six large triangular flats, called periaktois, were painted to make up the three scenes of, the play, each face being painted differently. When set up, they accurately portrayed the scene, and could be revolved to show the new scene in a matter of seconds. The actual changing of the scenes deserves mention, for in this play they related to the entire production, and instead of being a, necessary evil they were some­thing to be enjoyed. The Waiters and the Porters all had specific personalities, and as the play progressed, the audience began to anticipate their entrances, and forget the fact that they were performing the essential task of changing the scenery. As a dramatic effect it worked, for the speed pf the play was not diminished, and the level of humor was retained. 
It is hard to find the adjectives necess­ary to describe Rick Homan's perform­ance as the Servant Truffaldino. It was a combination of gra'ce, energy and flawless timing that made it perhaps the best I've seen on this campus. He was always in character, whether delivering a line, mak­

He had a courage that men dream about. . He had a wife. Children. He was warm. When he smiled it was ear to ear. Like when he listened to Mahalia sing "Jer­icho." If he had run for president, it would have been interesting.

It's hard to measure what a man loves most in this world. His wife, his children, his people, his God. But one suspects for King, it was his country. 
One night in Tennessee, it ended for· Martin Luther King. Everybody looked around and said, "When will there be another like him?" Perhaps never. Martin Luther King was an original.

This is the only time the movie will be seen theatrically. It is a film of power, impact, warmth, emotion. Like the man himself. You will never forget it. Because it is something more than a movie. It is an experience. Since it is only for one night, you should act quickly in purchasing your tickets at the boxoffice of a theatre near you. And join with millions of people across the country to say to all the world, "This was a man!"

One of the four policemen who remained demanded to know which one of the youths was responsible for starting the incident. The youths objected to the question. 
In an attempt to clear the halls, sheriffs were walking down the Hall asking students to get in their rooms. When they ap­proached Junior Rick Ames, standing outside Sophomore Lee Fort's room, an argument en­sued. fort was inside his room. Father Joseph O'Neil, rector of

A number of organizations and in­dividuals in the United States and Europe have suggested that the money will be presented personally by SBR National Director, Tom Hamilton, to the Red Cross in Geneva. Hamilton pointed out, however, that this would occur only if some gener­ous soul donated the round-trip ticket to Switzerland. 
The National Committee of the American Red Cross has invited Students for Biafran Re­lief to represent the student con­stituency in the U.S. at the annual convention of Red Cross­es in Chicago. The convention, which convenes on May 17th will host representatives from almost every Red Cross society in the world and will provide SBR with much needed publi­city. At that time an official presentation of the funds raised for Nigerian relief by SBR will be made; even though the money will have exchanged hands long before the occasion presents itself. 
The group which had its begin­nings at Notre Dame is now the international headquarters for the effort, with its first overseas chapter having been formed at the University of Geneva. The organization is in the process of contacting the National Student Associations of Great Britain, France, Germany and Japan with hopes for large student movements in those areas. 
Recently, a long list of new endorsers to the student organi­zation was compiled. This list included among others, Sam Brown, the Director of the Viet­nam National Moratorium Com­mittee. 
A plea was also issued by the group for assistant in their en­deavors. This would entail not only financial aid but logistical involvement particularly with the huge amount of clerical work which is essential to the operations of any international movement. Anyone who would be able to contribute their time (or any portion thereof) during Easter vacation or after the holi­days was asked by Sherry to contact the Biafran Relief Office and leave their name and phone number. The numbers are 283-2141 and 283-1966.

King film shown tonight 
Three campus organizattons have combined to present a special documentary film on the life of the late Martin Luther 
King, Jr. The film, King: a 
filmed record, Montgomery to 
Memphis, will be shown tonight 
only at 8 PM in Washington Hall. 
The profits from the film, 

being distributed nationally in 
over I000 theaters, and expec­
ted to be viewed by over one 
million people, will all go to the 
Martin Luther King Jr. Special 
Fund.

Mansfield said Congress might have to skip its scheduled Easter recess to work on the postal pay bill that has been jammed up for several months. 
But Vice President J. Stanley Lewis of the letter carriers union said, "It would take nine months for a serviceman to be trained to be efficient." 
"It's not just a matter of putting a sack of mail on your back and delivering it to houses," said Lewis. "It has to be routed to the right street and the right houses. You have to have a knowledge -or who has moved out and where," Stanley said. 
But Daniel Z. Henkin, assist­ant defense secretary for public affairs, said he understood the servicemen would initially be used only to sort mail and drive trucks-not deliver it. They would work at the beginning, Henkin said, in the main Man­hattan·post office, the Brooklyn Post Office, and the Church Street Post Office. 
Postmaster General Winton M. Blount said the Gls would not require any immediate intensive training and what instructions they do need will be provided on the job. 
He added that the first objec­tive would be "to restore essen­tial mail services," such as move­ment of welfare and social secur­ity checks, but estimated it would take "several days before meaningful services are restored" in New York. 
the project in the New York Times. When he found no thea­ter in South Bend was willing to show the film with its $5 admis­
sion price, he called the pro­ducer of the film, Ely Landau, in New York and obtained permis­sion to show the film on cam­pus. 
Metzger then obtained free use of Washington Hall under its agreement with SUAC. The Program for Non-Violence signed as a co-sponsor of the event and Students Against Racism has picked up the adver­tising costs. 
Metzger commented that "It's really amazing to see the number and the varied types of people that have gotten together to support this project nationally. And the same applies locally. We have drawn great response from the media in the immediate area and from the people here on campus. I think the cooperation needed and obtained for this project is a very suitable tribute to Dr. King." 
Publicity for the film, Metzger said, has been in the South Bend Tribune, local television and radio stations and was even announced in the pulpits and bulletins of most of the South Bend churches. 
The film, which traces the work of Dr. King from 1955 until his death in 1968, runs for 2Vz hours and was put together by Landau with the aid of TV stations and news media across the country. Many parts of the film are rare, such as a tape of 
the meeting before King's first

UAC feels optimism Festival successfu I 
by Steve Lazar 
Tom Kronk, chairman of the 
University Arts Council, yester­
day described a "new optimism" 
which has overtaken the UAC in 
its drive to convert the field­
house into a center for the arts 
on campus. 
His optimism, he said, is based 
on the "fantastic" success of the 
recent Student Arts Festival held 
in the fieldhouse. 
"The student response and interest has been so strong that we feel the entire University is coming alive to the arts. The Notre Dame artist is finally get­ting the recognition he truly deserves," he said. 
Kronk said he remains opti­mistic even though the UAC must raise 1.6 million dollars by June I st to meet the deadline set by the University. Barring any extensions, if that amount is not reached, the fieldhouse will be razed. 
He stated that the UAC has made at least fifty requests for funds to various foundations favorable to the arts and progres­sive education, and that only four of these requests have been rejected so far. He added that members of the UAC will be making contacts over Easter in order to gain additional funds. 
Kronk explained that one of the difficulties in meeting the June I st deadline is that many foundations make grants only once each year, and that this date often falls after June I st. An extension on this deadline would possibly eliminate this problem, he said. 
The University has been very 
cooperative in the UAC's dnve, 
Kronk felt. He said that the 
administration did not fully un­
derstand the "concept of pro­
gressive education" that is 
behind the UAC's action, but as 
long as the money required 
could be raised there would be 
no problems. 
He described the future arts 
center as a place where the 
professional artist, the faculty 
member and the student could 
come together for the maximum 
education of the student artist. 
He said it will be a place "for the 
student," a place where he can 
come to express himself and be 
criticized by his peers. 
He emphasized that the arts center will be an ideal place for artistic experimentation. "The student can have a one man show here. This is the place to have a flop -if it has to be " he said. ' 
Most of the 1.6 million dollars required, he thought, will be spent in refurbishing the interior of the existing structure. Plans include rooms for film 'screen­ings, music, exhibits, workshops and a distinctive theater in the round, he said. The amount of money used on the exterior and the foundations of the building depend on the results of archi­tectural studies, he noted. 
Kronk said that the next pub­lic activity of the UAC may well be a "Festival of Lights and Life" to be celebrated later in the spring.  
In closing, he noted that even if the fieldhouse must be des­troyed the University Arts Coun­cil will still be around next year.
