StudentS meet, 
discuss action on restrictions 
by Ed Ellis 
In an open meeting attended hy some thirty students last night, Charlie Zappela, head of the group opposing the Uni­versity fiscal polides which have restricted (iovernmen t courses to Government majors only, discussed the basis behind his appeal for student support on the issue, and considered the possibility of a strike of Govern­ment courses by students and 
faculty during  the  week before  
the  May  I  Board  of  Trustees  
meeting.  

Zappala mentioned the student-faculty ratio statistics presented at last week's meeting for c;overnment majors alone. These showed the Government Department with a twenty-five to one student-faculty ratio, whereas the University ratio is near thirteen to one. lie also said that students in the more tech­nical colleges, Sdence and Engineering had far lower ratios. l·:ngineering, for example, he

Mr. Garrett De Bell will open the Teach-in with a talk on "Alternatives to Ecological Dis­aster" at 7:30 p.m. tomorrow in Washington Hall. 
Founder of Ecology Action and lobbyist in Washington for Zero Population Growth, Mr. De Bell has also distinguished him­self in the field of ecology by editing The Hnvironmen tal Handbook. 
On Wednesday the Teach-in will move outdoors to the main quad as students and faculty members deliver a series of speeches on the environmental and population problems. "Rele­vant" literature, poetry and live music will also be provided during the program. 
At 7:30 that evening in the Law Auditorium a panel of Notre Dame professors will dis­cuss the "Methods, Morality, and Feasibility of Popula­tion Control in the U.S. and Other Nations." 
Four speeches concerning the governmental, economic and industrial aspects of the environ­mental problem will be delivered on Thursday afternoon between I and 3:30 p.m. Speakers will include Mr. Thomas Jorling of the Minority Council, Senate Public Works Department, and 
Mr. William Matuszeski of the 
President's Advisory Council on

Six from North Quad, campaign for position 
by Don Ruane and Floyd Kezele 
This year's Student Life Council Election for the Flanner-Grace Tower district, finds three candidates vying for the district's one seat. The candiates are Robert Ohlemiller, a sophomore from Kingston, Ind., Glen Corso, a sophomore from Massapequa, N.Y., and James O'Gorman, a junior from Teaneck, N.J. 
Ohlemiller, citing "frustration over the Trustee's stand on parietals" as a reason for his candidacy, stated that he felt that, "the Trustees are being presumptious as to the needs and desires of the Notre Dame student." He explained this by saying that while the S.L.C. is the one board with both stu­dents and faculty, and thus in a position to gauge the true 


South Quad, OC aspirants give their views on SLC 
by Tom Hufendick and John Papa 
Sophomores Dick Tarrier and Frank Healy expressed their views yesterday in relation to their candidacy for the Student Life Council. Healy hopes to represent the off-campus stu­dents and Tarrier is running as the out-lying halls' representa­tive on the SL<'. · 
Both candidates felt that the su· should be primarily con­cerned with student life. Tarrier daimed, "the SLC' got bogged down this year on many trivial thiags." Healy, commenting on the work of the last SLC, said, 
'They should not have dealt with the far-reaching topics that affected more than just student life." lie felt the SLC should be concerned directly with '\Jay­by-day student life." 
Tarrier questioned whether the su· should be a recom­mending or legislative body. He said the present parietal con­troversy exemplified the prob­lems the SLC had this year. He seemed dismayed at the "pat-. ernalistic attitude" the Board of Trustees took toward the SLC's parietal recommendation. He cited, "The SLC knows what is happening here on campus, but 
these  businessmen  in  Miami  
don't."  lie  thinks  the  recom­ 
mendation  should  be  resub­ 

mitted to the hoard before the end of this year. Allowing sophomore cars, rewriting the judicial code, and a 
better organization of the Hall Life Board were the major goals of the Tarrier platform. He also hoped to get more student and faculty representation on the SLC, and felt that there should be more student representatives than faculty or administrators. Presently working in the

feetmgs of the students, the 
Trustees chose to ignore their 
suggestions on parietals. 
Concerning Black Recruit­
ment, Ohlemillcr said that he 
felt "all minorities should be 
recruited, including Pro­
testants." Although he said that 
he felt the program was a success 
this year, he revealed that he 
would seek to have a student 
placed on the Admissions Board. 
He said that a student would be 
more qualified to dedde 
whether in some cases a prospec­
tive student that was academi­
cally behind could indeed cope 
with the acaclemic situation at 
Notre Dame. In other areas, 
Ohlemiller revealed that he felt the Security System was Jacking and should be revamped, in­cluding the hiring of more competent guards. 
Glen Corso began his state­ment by expressing his thoughts on the goals of the S.L.C. He said that "since its inception it has been concerned with restric­tive University rules such as parietals, and should now wid~n the scope of its activities." Corso said further that he felt Black Recruitment was the "foremost problem, requmng prompt attention by the university." He said that the present staff has done an excellent job in spite of the limitations placed on it through monetary restrictions. Corso revealed that he felt that the S.L.C. should press for a "professionally staffed and fully funded program for minority recruitment."

another key question" according to Corso in that he feels that the "university is placing financial emphasis on the wrong things." Citing the current Government Department situation as an example, he went on to say that while the number of science students has decreased and the number in Arts and Letters has increased, the liberal arts program is still inadequately funded. He said that all stud.ents should, through their electives, be able to take a wide variety of courses but that the restrictions on government courses was "a denial of the very essence of a liberal arts education." In other areas, Corso said that he would work for improvements in the "calibar of our security force", and especially for better judge­ment in the committrnents of University funds. 
James O'Gorman in discussing the issues of the current SLC campaign expressed his belief that, "while issues and problems are important, the student should vole for the man and not the issue, because issues pass hut the men must deal with new problems." In the area of BJ;ick Recruitment, O'Gorman said that it should definitely be stepped up and that St. Mary's should also step up recruitment so that students would not feel isolated. He also said that the money from the Cotton Bowl should he used in this area as well as the Arts and Letters program in general, so that other departments would not find

themselves in the same situation as the government department. Citing Notre Dame's financial situation, he said that the school is spread too thin and that the SLC could provide the proper direction to the administration and faculty alike. 
Concerning security, O'Gor­
man said that the students 
"should be more careful them­
selves, and make it clear to the 
security force that they feel the 
job is definitely not being 
done." 

Three North Quad SLC candi­dates gave their reasons for running and views on a wide rangy of topics yesterday after­noon in separate telephone inter­views with this reporter. Topics discussed in the interviews ranged from hall life and of-cam­pus to ROTC. 
John Hurley, a resident of Breen-Phillips, is campaigning on what he calls the university's need for a "sense of creativity." Hurley says that the university has many talented people in many fields, but only the talents of specific areas are emphasized. By working through the SLC, Hurley said that he will work to expand the number of "outlets" for this "creativity," He believes that the major outlet in need of expansion is the art department. 
"It's time for the art department 
to come out and show how 
talented they are. I'm all for the 
University Arts Council."

A vacation with the first Americans 
by larry Overlan 
Over the Easter vacation I went to the Rosebud Indian Reservation in Southern South Dakota. Here there are approx­imately seven thousand Sioux Indians living. I went to this particular reservation by chance since I met one of the inhabi­tants when Notre Dame had its Indian Conference in January. I am by no means an expert on Indian affairs nor am I an expert on this particular reservation since I spent only four days there. 
My hope in writing this is not to burden people with statistics since they don't convey any emotional meaning of what they mean to the people experiencing those statistics. What does the statistic that the avcrave edu­ca tiona! level for all Indians under Federal supervision is five school years mean to you? Does the fact that the dropout rates for Indians are twice the na­tional average or the suicide rate is two to three times the national average mean anything to you? The life span of Indians averages around forty-five years compared to the national av­erage of almost seventy. The average family income for Indians is $1 ,500 a year and the unemployment rate is fifty (50!) percent. 
These statistics were known to me before I went to South Dakota but they for the most part simply added on to all my statistical knowledge rather than making me feel the true plight of the American Indian. 
As I was arriving through South Dakota on my way out, I noticed how the land was not flat like Iowa and Indiana but was full of small rolling hills for as far as I rould see. There were few trees to he seen hut many herds of cattle stayed near the roadside. Then I saw my first "herd" of buffalo. Perhaps twenty all together with their enormous heads and horns

reminding me of movie pictures I had seen. 
There is not much industry in South Dakota and most of the cities are very small-maybe in the five to ten thousand range. However, while noticing the little industry there was I also 
noticed how abruptly it ended when I neared the reservation. There were only a few gas stations, the Bureau of Indian Affairs offices, a hospital and the Tribal Headquarters. This scene was probably duplicated in the rest of the Reservalion, although I'm not sure since I didn't visit every community on the reservation. This reservation extends about one hundred and fifty miles east to west and fifty to seventy-five miles north to south. 
However, I didn't have to go any further than the town of St. Francis where I stayed for those four days to see the problems I had read about. In that small community of about seven hundred people there is a school opera ted by the Jesuits which goes from kindergarten to the twelfth grade. This school's te, ch~rs arc thirty to forth pa cent lay volunteers who s1end any where from one or two years to five or six years without pay except for some spending money. The rest of the teachers are Jesuit priests or Franciscan nuns. 
The school has about three hundred students of whom about half Jive in dormitories at the school. The reasons for this arc that many of these children come from broken homes or have no homes. Also some Jive too far away to commute and therefore arc separated from their homes. Indeed, the situa­tion is better for many of these children at the school since there is adequate food, clothing and shelter there. So for the sake of the children's physical good many are living away from home. This is happening now. 
Endfest planned by CAF 
by Tom Bornholdt A flurry of activities will end the year for the Contemporary Arts Festival. In a telephone interview, Richard Roddewig, this year's Contemporary Arts Festival Chairman said, "Starting on this Thursday, we will have what we call an Endfest." The first event will be a series of animated films, including part of Disney's Fantasia. Next Saturday, the Lukus Hoving Dance Company will come here for three days. Also on Saturday night, film maker Stan Vanderbeck will lecture and screen a number of his most recent films. Co-sponsored with the Student Union Academic Commission, the CAF will bring Jergin Klaus, multimedia artist who will give two multimedia events, described by Rodde wig as "more a happening than a formal demonstration". Klaus 
Indian families are being split 
up-not actually by law but by economic necessity. 
There is no strong family bond for many if not most of these children· because of the economic structure I spoke of earlier. The Indians are not unique in having a strong family or tribe relationship. Every race has been psychologically better when their families remained intact. This is one of the main goals of the Black movement today-to have pride in their family and their race. 
Now why are many of these families broken and economi­cally (if not physically) starving? The answer is actually quite simple-there are no jobs. Only temporary jobs are found for the most part and these are when the Bureau of Indian Affairs decides to build something--a few small houses etc. These jobs are meaningless to the Sioux since they know they arc only temporary and will not give them security. For the most part these pay checks are immed­iately spent on either bare necessities or liquor. Again this is not untypieal of any group of people (or individual for that· matter) when they get their first real pay check in months. (The barrooms were full when many of the recipients of New Deal legislation received their first checks). 
Perhaps the most dismaying thing that saw was the difference in attitudes between the younger Sioux (5-11) and the older children ( Jl-17). In the younger grades the children were happy, smiling and very talkative. The main request I had from these children was for me to swing them around by their

On April 30, the CAF will sponsor a night of blues in Washington Hall. On May I and 2, the Czech film "Shop on Mainstreet" will be screened. On May 5 and May 6, the final event of this year's Contemporary Arts Festival will be the showing of the motion picture, "Smiles of a Summer Night". 
Roddewig expressed a sense of accomplishment f'or this year's CAF. "It's the first year we went year-long. We esta b­lished the Con temporary Arts Festival." He did feel that there were several problems with the CAF this year. "We were really hampered by the lack of funds voted us by the Senate." The student Senate had voted the CAF $3000 of their approx.

There are many economical, political. social, educational etc. problems of the Sioux and all Indians. However, all of those statistics come to life in the faces of those children.

The SLC elections 
, Elections for student representatives to the Student Life Council will take place this Thursday .. Most Candidates began their bid for the office over the week by distributing literature and campaigning the halls. With hall elections going on there is a tendency among students inundated by all the literature to take the campaigns lightly or to ignore voting. We hope that this does not become the case. 
The SLC can play an important role in bringing about change in student life at the university. Since its inception two years ago it has brought about the change of many· rules that were archaic and were not attuned to the needs of the Notre Dame students. I 

Significant changes alone were made in the areas of hall life as the rules on drinking and visitation hours by women were liberalized. First steps were taking towards implementing the concept of Hall autonomy. Although the Council passed a parietal hour resolution which would have made that concept a reality the Trustees did not approve it. SLC members are needed who will continue to push to see that idea of students governing their own lives becomes a reality. men of quality are found to fill those jobs. For these reasons it is important that students seriously consider the literature and statements by current candidates for SLC and elect representatives who will work to see

Editor: 
I have long had a slight premonition that the Student Senate was unresponsive to the students but this is ridiculous. Who won the last Student Body President Election anyway? I thought that Dave Krashna proved to all concerned that he was the choice of the people. The basis of his platfGrm called for the transfer of student government to the halls through the formation of a Student Forum and the abolition of the Student Senate. During the campaign, Tom Thrasher mentioned that it might be difficult to persuade the Senate to abolish itself. Is Stay Senator Tom Thrasher trying to fulfill that campaign prophecy so as to remain a political "power" on campus? Who the hell does the Senate think they are? Didn't the last SBP election show them where the students stand? Senate: why not abolish yourself so Student Government can be given back to the people, the same people that voted for the platform of Dave Krashna so emphatically not long ago?

Campus Opinion 
Edited by Glen Corso 
The following is a letter written by John M. Crump and Philip J. Welchman and a third person whose name I could not make out. It is a rebuttal to a column I wrote concerning a bulletin on LSD issued 
by the Fort Lauderdale Police. 

We read your paranoid letter and it is indeed typical of the numerous articles on acid. Did you quote Life to find the effects of acid? There are so many people writing who know nothing of acid. So you picked up a pamphlet and now you know all about drugs. Thafs like finding out what intercourse feels like after reading a book on Catholic marriage. We could say a little about what the acid scene is like but we think you'd rather listen to the Fort Lauderdale police. I should tell you of the astonishing increase in suicide, homicide, and accidents on (oh, and off) campus which according to this unquestionalbe hypothesis parallels the increase in drug use here. 
We're praying for you, glen; we're praying that your paternal humanism will change into something rather more viable, rather less rhetorical. There are so many people writing who know nothing about acid: something there is in journalism which abhors a blank space, and would scribble vacuities to efface the silence. 
We gave up acid 2 years ago but your article makes me want to try again. And the next time you see a friend with sunglasses, a smile and anti-social behavior throw him in jail for 5 years and save him from himself and remember the smile was deceptive-he wasn't really happy. 
Protest ignorance, drop one for gipper. 
Mr. Welchman and Mr. Crump seem to have committed the grave ?rror of failing to closely read an article which they have chosen to criticize. At no time did I state that the portions of the Fort Lauderdale Police report which I printed were my own views on the use of LSD. I reprinted the report since I felt it might be ofinterest to students to see how the police view drug use. As for the statement saying my column carried the implication that because there is increased drug use on campuses, there is increased suicides and homicides-/ do not have the statistics to justify such a claim. I suggest that you gentlemen contact the Fort Lauderdale Police, or perhaps Mr. Art Linkletter. 
My own views were contained in the last two paragraphs of the 
column and concerned the enforcement problem of drug abuse, 
which I have researched. 

My prayers will be offered for the salvation of your souls 
gentlemen in the hopes that you will not require LSD to find the 
true God. Yours in Christ--gsc

"Will it come to this?" ._.___.,,______~-------------­

==========================.. 
In emergency only 
With the whole world watching Apollo 13 splashed down safely in 
the Pacific on Friday. The milk run turned space age drama shook 
this usually complacent world. For three and one half days the fears 
of Lovell, Haise and Swigert became every man's; concern for their 
safe return. became., every'"'man's venture, with a seat reserved for 
everyone at the Manned Space Craft Center in living color. 
Living-that was the concern, wasn't it'! How to get three men, off 
to the moon in mankind's name, back safely to earth. For the 
superstitious-a field day. Just the names of the space craft were 
enough to set them off-the Odyssey and the Aquarius. Then there 
were all the 13's. The mission number itself; plus the thirteen letters 
in the astronauts first names: James, Fred, John; then the accident 
on Monday the 13; and the somewhat superfluous fact that the 
landing took place a little after 13 hundred hours on Friday. 
But the drama was destined to appeal to a different type of 
mind-the general mind of mankind that flutters when a new king or 
Pope is crowned, a president elected, or a president assassinated. The 
mind that marvels when a Lindberg flys over an ocean or a Titanic 
sinks but then can sit back half passive while a child with a bloated 
stomach starves in Biafra and one hundred bodies of dead 
Vietnamese float silently down a river bundled in groups of five and 
ten. 

People streamed to the churches on Tuesday morning. Congress 
asked that time be spent in prayer at 9 p.m. that night while the 
three men made the crucial engine burn on the side of the moon that 
the people who were doing the praying never get to see. Meanwhile 
the commentator on ABC related Congress' request to the American 
people, then a second later the station switched to the Movie of the 
Week to keep them all from thinking about what that request really 
meant. 

Isn't it funny the way people flock to prayer when situations get 
really tense? No one calls for an hour of prayer for the sake of a safe 
trip before m~nkind starts out on his ventures to be master of his 
environment ah~ his fate. No wonder the Notre Dame student 
watching the recovery on Friday, covered his head with his baseball 
glove and smirked an "oh no" when the chaplain on the Iwo Jima 
offered a prayer of thanksgiving for the safe recovery. 
Emergency-only religion-Could that be one of the hypocrasies that 
the young world is talking about? · 
Out in Hawaii, the President gave the three men and the ground 
crew the Medal of Freedom and stated that the flight wasn't a failure 
since it united the hearts of all mankind. Across the street pickets 
marched, their signs reading: "Poor people worry about astronauts. 
Who worries about poor people'!" 

But the world did unite. Nations of Africa and Asia which usually 
don;t trust American planes granted permission for them to fly over 
their territories when there was question about whether the landing 
might be in the Indian Ocean. Communications networks of ally and 
enemy alike that were on frequencies close to that of Apollo offered 
to shut down so as not to interfere with communications. The 
Russians even volunteered to help with the recovery. The Chumikan, 
a Soviet Missile Instrumentation Ship, which apparently had 
originally been dispatched to spy on the whole show , suddenly 
became attuned to the possibility of saving three human lives. 
One has to wonder why such concern can not be sustained beyond immediate crises. If men can work together for three days to save three lives, if they have the knowledge to put them up there and on the moon in the first place, you'd think they coijld figure out how to keep children around the world from starving or could stop all those stupid wars. Maybe we should put the whole show on television. If the camera were kept tuned in on all the bodies floating down the rivers maybe people would get angry about missing the Tuesday night movie and do something.

Ice Capades: Overdoing it  
by Dave Stauffer 

Extravagance tends to overshadow 
quality, when quality is present. Extrava­
gance can also cover up a lack of quality. 
A certain degree of extravagance is often 
quite appropriate. f"or exP.mplc, wed­
dings. state dinners, and Broadway 
muskals generally employ extravagance 
for cffed. 

Tlu.: 30th Anniversary Hdition uf Ice 
Capadcs which appeared at the Convo last 
week. was extravagant to the point of 
heing literally frightening. Time and again 
giant phalanxes of gaudily costumed 
skaters came grating down the icc toward 
I he wide-eyed and unarmed spectators, 
accompanied hy thl' Icc Capadcs Orches­
tra (of ahout thirty mcmhcrs), noisy 
sound effects, and at least eight dancing 
spotlights. It was actually not at all unlike 
a nigh !marc in which you arc being 
pursued by a slowly advancing army of 
ten-foot tall aliens but you arc fur some 
reason unable to run from them. 

Because of this largely unnecessary extravagance, it was quite difficult to judge the presence or absence of quality. With many of the performers it was easy to assume that ability existed, based on past cn:dcntials, such as Olympic appear­ances and various national an·j world championships. The trouble was that these featured stars are no longer competitive ice skaters, but rather profes­sional entertainers. Recognized ability in the former does not make one necessarily an expert as the latter, and that was the biggest problem with the Ice Capades. 
If I were asked to make up an obvious

Gene Molineili 

All things die at least one time 
It was tragic. He had always been a sickly little boy, and no one was surprisec. 
when he died; but he was so very young. It was tragic. 
Everyone felt the death but no one more than the dead boy's friend, Bobby. 
When the announcement was made to the class, Bobby actually broke down and 
cried; and when the arrangements had been made for the funeral, it was little 
Bobby who, with tears in his eyes, had volunteered to serve the funeral Mass. 
The day of the Mass was bright and sunny, and since the class had been let out 
that day for the funeral there was more than the usual number of children outside 
playing. Bobby could see them playing from his house. He could hear them calling 
and laughing on the day of the funeral and it made him mad. He was not going to 
go out and play on a day when everyone should be sad; even his mother had said 
how awfully disrespectful it was to the dead and all. 
Yet there they were, having fun only a couple of hours before the funeral. And 
there, right in the middle, was Scott Vacari. Scott was always doing things like that; 
he would fool around in class and he thought he was really great in everything. 
Bobby should have known that Scott, of all people, would be out there. Bobby's 
mother had said it was disrespectful and disgusting. And Scott was most disgusting 
of all. 

Bobby's mother called him to get ready and as he left the window he made up 
his mind that somehow he would teach them all a lesson. He wouldn't cause a fight 
because fighting is the sissy's way out--Sister Mary Joseph had told him that; but 
he would think of something. 

And think he did--all through the Mass. He did not move or sway like the other 
lesser altar boys. It disgusted him to see them standing there shifting their weight 
from one foot to another and picking their noses. They were as bad as Scott. 14! 
stood there perfectly still, thinking how he could show them all just how disgusting 
they were. 

The funeral would be long past when Bobby could do so, and he would not let 
the opportunity pass him by. 

Scott was doing tricks on his bike on a street near Bobby's and a car was coming up behind him. Bobby did not yell, the car whizzed past Scott startling him. Scott swerved off balance, reached for his handlebars, missed a,ld fell headlong from his bike. Bobby could not have asked for more. 
He did not change his pace. Scott was getting what he deserved and it felt good that the other had been hurt. He did not care that the other was in pain; he thought only of the dead who had been wronged. He was unmoved by the figure sitting in the street trying to hold back his tears while his smudged blackened hands clutched at red bloodied knees that appeared out of a torn pants leg. Bobby's face was set in an expression which took all the hate his body could muster, and he passed on. And, hurt a second time, Scott watched him go. 
He had not gone far when he passed Scott's home, and Mrs. Vacari just happened to see him walk by. "Oh look," she said to her coffee-drinking companion, "there's little Robert Miller, Scott's friend. He's such a sweet boy ... Why, you should have seen him last week serving their poor friend's funeral. He was just marvelous standing there so straight and still and serious-like a little saint. It's really wonderful how children can be so holv."

A review by 
Mike Chapin 
The third and latest issue of Ictus has a new dimension: readability. Printed for the first time on glossy paper, only two of the six articles could be considered "heavy" essays, while the others are short stories and poems. Also, the photographs and artwork for this issue are unmatched by any publication to come out of Notre Dame this year. The photographs them­selves make looking at the magazine worthwhile. 
This issue of Ictus tries to root up 
Corby Street 
AC to have 
"atheletic festival" 
"At the time you receive this, my teammate Rick Libowitz will be in Boston making final preparations for Monday's Marathon. It was with great unhappiness that I decided Saturday that I could not accompany him on his heroic venture; however, injuries precluded my participation in the race. While practicing Friday, I fell on my hip. My wallet cushioned the fall, but there was nothing in it. Thls proved to be an important factor in my decision not to make the trip. 
"At this time, would like to announce the next major event on our spring schedule. We will be sponsoring, on the weekend of April 24 through 26, the first Annual Corby Street Striders Poobah Athletic Festival. This Festival will consist of three events-a basketball game, a softball game, and a football game-between a team of graduating seniors from Student Government and Student Union, and a team made up of new players and returning veterans from these two organizations. 
Libowitz is scheduled to run in M.onday's Boston·Marathon.

owned and operated by none other than 
Metromedia, out of Hollywood, Califor­
nia. 

I suppose one mistake made by the promotion department of the Ice Capades is that it is hilled as "entertainment for the entire family.'' It should actually be labeled as entertainment for anyone over forty, preferable female, and preferably a senior citizen. It's not that the taste or integrity of this group of people should be questioned, but rather that it's the type of thing grandmothers really go for, but everyone else sits around and tolerates while feigning excited appreci­ation. 
Throughout the program I glanced 
frequently at a boy of about six years. He 
stood and smiled during the initial performance of the clowns (Freddie "The Bouncing Ball" Trenkler), but was busy eating popcorn off the floor when they appeared during the second half. A climactic finale, with color and noise, would probably have regained the young­ster's attention. But because noise and color was constant throughout the show, it was difficult to regain anyone's attention. 
Patriotism and Ictus 
some of our complacent "values and 
commitments" at Notre Dame. The tone 
for the whole magazine, that we must not 
be afraid to think and to question the 
"givens" of our society, is capsulized in 
the first article. The short story-poem is a 
fantasy about a man who finally comes to 
discover the meaning of life after he finds 
"freedom from the other men's judg­
ments, and their opinions even more 
petty, and also freedom from their do's 
and don'ts, and freedom from their 
money." 

Ictus gives the reader a new view of 
society, its war, its education, and its 
goals. Mark Twain's "War Prayer" and 
George William's "Oinks in Memoriam" 
point out the realities of war: the blood, 
the pain, the grief, the hunger, and the 
broken spirits. Twain tries to show how 
people hide these horrors by praying to 
the "God of Battles" to help. them "win 
for the flag" in the "field of honor." 
Our sacred Notre Dame education 
comes into question in Mario. Corradi's 
"Where are My Grades? Where are My 
Grades?" Corradi feels that American 
education's primary function has warped 
into turnir 51 out people who only 
produce in society. They have no concern 
for finding "the responsible commitment 
to the realization of the Self which we 
inherited by birth." 
Corradi's point is shockingly demon­
strated in a short story. by Mike Fallon. 
Actually, reading Fallon's "Cry of the 
Torrents" is a pleasurable experience 
because one identifies with John, the 
main character., in almost every way. The 
story is powerful at the end when one 
finds that John, because of his college 
environment, is a shallow person. One can 
not help but introspect about his own 
development at Notre Dame. 
Michael Feeney's poem "Road 
Impressions Near Home Overlifelooking" 
criticizes this lack of depth and over­
emphasis on production of our society. 
He contrasts our rural heritage of "golden 
cornfields", red sunsets, and log cabins 
with Las Vegas, T.V. antennas, Apollo 
12, and John Wayne movies. 
Ictus, then, brings reality to us; a complacent Notre Dame, a complacent America. And it brings reality in such a way that it's impossible to ignore.

The cast for the final product­ion of the Notre Dame-St. Mary's Theatre season, Bertolt Brecht's "The Good Woman of Setzuan," was announced yes-tef­Soi¥ by Director Roger L. Ken­vin. The production, a musical drama, is scheduled to run the first two weekends of May in O'Laughlin Auditorium at St. Mary's. 
The Good Woman, Shen-Te, 
will be played by Anne Patter­son, most recentiYseen as Juliet in the recent production of "Romeo and Juliet." Miss Pat­terson will also appear as Shui­Ta, the Good Woman's cousin. Miss Patterson is a junior theatre major at St. Mary's, and is also a member of the National Travel­ing Players. 

-Yang -Sun, the lover, will be played by sophomore Mark Genero, who last appeared as Tybalt in "Romeo and Juliet." Wong, the water-seller, will be played by junior James Boland ' who was Pantalone in "The Servant of Two Masters" recent­ly presented in the Little Thea­tre. Others in the cast include William O'Reilly, who portrayed King Pellinore in last May's "Camelot"; Missy Smith, whose last ND/SMC Theatre role was The Nurse in "The Death of Bessie Smith," and Paulette Petretti of the National Travel­ing Players.

He said, "There's no doubt that something must be done about this. We're paying for the same education as a Math or Engineering major but we're not getting it." 
Zappala asked those present to sign a petition asking the Administration for more money, and asked the students to "talk it up among their friends." He said that perhaps something could be done by next year, but he doubted it. 
At this point, the possibility 

of  a  boycott  of  classes  was  
brought  up  by  one  of those in  
attendance.  

Zappala said, "I think Mr. Brinkley has taken as dramatic a gesture as he is willing to take at this time." But he said he was willing to consider this if student support did not materialize soon. The week before the May I Board of Trustees meeting was considered a most likely date 
With respect to the small turnout, Zappala was "dis­appointed". He said, "We were hoping to get a response out of the administration and students, but apparently we haven't yet." 
All his efforts, Zappala said, 

would  be  worhless,  unless  the  
students  concerned  with  the  
educational  process  at  Notre  

Dame would become interested in the problem, not only in the Government Department where it was so critical a problem, but in the whole College of Arts and Letters. He stated, "It's the student's ball to carry." 
Advantages of Chancellor-President set-up 
This is the fifth in a jive-part series written by the Nutting for President Headquarters. A sum­mary will appear tomorrow. 
A brief example may better display the nature of the revi­sion. Say a group of students blocked the access to the Place­ment Bureau in an attempt to demonstrate to the communit:y the "immorality of certain ex­ploitation-related jobs" and to confront "the complicity of thi~ university;" Who would do what?

This situation, because of its obvious "external" considera­tions (i.e., Notre Dame's rela­tionship to the off-campus com­mercial-industrial interests, the obtaining of future gifts to the University being jeopardized by adverse publicity, etc.) and equally obvious "internal" consi­derations (i.e., the relation of a Christian community to the desires of its majority and minority members, the status and limits of an individual's 
activities, etc.) would call upon 
both the Chancellor and the 
President to attempt to calm all 
interest groups and act in a way 
that would befit .a Chrisitan 
community. Balancing the 
various influences is difficult 
indeed. But by having men 
aware of the two broad sets of 
interests at stake in this type of 
situation a resolution through an 
interplay of considerations 
would be possible. 
This then is the major advan­

tage to this proposed revision: it 
heightens the prospect of fulfill­
ing the major obligations of this 
University. And it does this by 
making the administrative struc­
ture more conducive to com­
munity by allowing for a mean­
ingful dialogue at the highest 
level of University decision mak­
ing. 
A further advantage, and one 

which must not be treated 
lightly, is the protection of the physical well-being of the Uni­versity's top office holders. Those men who hold the post of President often find their health destroyed by the tremendous 
energy requ11.:d by thtil posi­
tions. What we suggest should 
significantly lighten the burden 
of the current President, by 
making it possible for a division 
of the work load. Not only 
would this be a more humane 
structure, but it would allow 
many men to serve longer in the 
positions they are qualified to 
fill. 
Before a summary conclusion 

we should turn to the question 
of feasibility. Will this new 
structure work? 
As far as we know, no such 

division ever has been tried by 
an American university. Though 
the titles Chancellor and Presi­
dent frequently are applied to 
administrators at various 
schools, the responsibilities and 
functions seem quite different 
from those envisioned here. A 
list of some thirty schools that 
have both a Chancellor and 
President, include Brown, the 
University of California, Indiana 
City University of New York. However, we feel that the only way to be certain if this plan will work is to give it a short term trial.

As we have outlined the Chancellor-President structure we can find no decisive problem which would bar its implementa­tion. As always the major problem in any structural arrangement is finding men to fill the positions. Here, however, we are entering a new realm of discussion: the question of per­son and personality of the possible office holders. Certain problems refuse to appear on the drafting board, and these would have to be met in the everyday practice of this new structure. 
It has been suggested that one major drawback to the new structure would be seen in the 
Chancellor's "inability to secure investments in the University, for he woulu not really be the University's leader." This pos­sible problem would seem to resolve itself (at least theoretical­ly) hy recalling that most dona­tions are given to the University and not diret:tly to its leader. And secondly, there is a basic mis-understanding if one sees the Chancellor as anything less that the University's chief appointed administrative officer, for this is what Chancellor means. 
We suspect there are consid­erations which we have failed to raise thus far in our discussions. We would hope that you would share with us the problems which you see as unanswered in !his series of articles so thai we might be able to come to know more of the alternatives to understanding and improving the structure of Notre Dame.

student housmg division of the off-campus office, Healy said that the "hassle" he had trying to move off-campus was the reason for his candidacy. While on the SLC he hoped to give the off-campus student good rep­resentation. A major goal he said, "would he to funnel attempts to get off campus, eliminating much red tape." lie also felt that "the students living off campus now should go through the OC office more than 
the administration." lie contends that the people in the OC office know more about off-campus problems and situa­tions than the administration docs. This makes the OC office more qualified to handle the OC student than the regular univer­sity facilities. 
llealy also agrees with the new structures proposed by SBP-elect Dave Krashna. He would like to sec the strengthen­ing of the Hall Life Board with the addition of two students. 
If there 1s a single theme running through the campaigns of south quad candidates for Student Life Council, it is dissatisfaction. Dissatisfaction with student life and, in particu­lar, dissatisfaction with the pre­sent SLC. 
Mark Zimmerman, for exam­ple, is concerned with the plight of the student in SLC: "Student representatives come up against respected people (from the fac­ulty and Board of Trustees), but the students themselves are not respected. It's hard not to be factionalized." 
To combat the divisive ten­dencies inherent in this year's SLC, Zimmerman proposes a weekend get-together at which the members of the SLC could get to know each other fairly well. 
Another dissatisfied candidate is Chris Ottenweller, who com­plains especially of the lack of student power exerted through the SLC. 
Ottenweller indicates that the parietal ruling by the Board of Trustees provides an example of infringement upon student pow­er. He adds, "pressures should definitely be applied on the administration. There are many ways of doing this. As a beginning, the halls halls should declare their own autonomy." 
Ottcnweller notes that the SLC should be the organ by which students participate in 
Collegiate GOP meets 
Representing tl11rtcen states from North Dakota to Oklaho­ma, Collegiate Republicans, in­cluding 9 representatives from Notre Dame and St. Mary's, convened last weekend in In­dianapolis to elect Midwest Fed­eration officers and propose nsolutions. 
These objectives, however, proved secondary during the weekend to a confrontation that the delegates had with support­ers of Sen. Vance Hartke (D), Indiana's senior senator, over the use of the motel's main ball­room. 
According to a contract with the motel, the Republicans had the use of the room for <JII weekend events including a speech by Gov. Edgar A. Whit­comb ( R), caucuses, elections, a breakfast, and resolution com­mittee meetings. 
When the group tried to enter the room Sat. morning, they were confronted with a delega­tion of Hartke supporters ac­companied hy the hotel manage­ment, who barred the students from entering it.

cheon was Mr. Hartke's an­
nouncement party." 
From the GOP crowd, Robert 

Edgeworth, current Federation 
president, announced an alter­
nate plan and that legal action 
would be taken against the 
motel. 
With the permission of Indian­apolis's Mayor Lugar, delegates would peacefully march to the state capitol a few blocks away and reconvene on the capitol's steps. There, they would elect 
officers. 
At the capitol, they chose 

Paul Asquith, a Michigan State 
senior, as their new president. 
Notre Dame delegates also parti­
cipated in the region V elections. 
In another surprise move at 

the convention, delegates 
adjourned the resolution com­
mittee before a single resolution 
could be considered. 
Submission of only ultra­conservative resolutions by a small bloc of delegates urging for instance abolition of federal income tax, public schools, the post office system, social securi­ty and medicare prompted this move. 
Closing the convention, Wil­liam Ruckleshaus, assistant U.S. attorney general and prosecutor of air traffic controllers. in Washington, spoke. at a banquet

Candidate John Mateja's dis­satisfaction with the present SLC' is relatively basic. Accord­ing to his campaign manager Fred Guiffrida, "The SLC this year demonstrates an excess of rhetoric but lack of action·." 
Mateja stresses that the trivia which is now thrown around in the SLC must be replaced by concrete action -progress toward co=:education and improvements in security, for example. 
Berrigan speaks at Cornell 
ITHACA, N.Y. (UPI) Brightly clad young persons gyrated to electric rock Sunday in a festival tribute to a fugitive priest wanted in Maryland for destroying draft records. 
The Rev. Daniel Berrigan, a Jesuit, put in a brief, surprise appearance at the festival in Barton llall on the Cornell University campus Friday night but then disappeared. 
Authorities made no move to arrest the former Cornell chap­lin, apparently to avoid any trouble that might have devel­oped among the more than I0,000 persons attending the 
in the Atkinson Hotel. Labelling courts as "legisla­
tive,  judicial  and  executive  
authorities  since  1954,"  
Ruckleshaus  accused  the  judi­ 

ciary for the airport stalemate. 
"Each judge thinks he has the solution to the problem and proposes to announce his pro­grams to resolve the strike," he complained. 
Besides analyzing the airport situation, Ruckleshaus also con­sidered the underprivileged, "a weak spot in the Nixon admini­stration." "The administration goals are to provide an equal start for all, but not to guarantee an equal finish," he revealed. "This leaves plenty of room for individual initiative." 
"I am pleased with the out­come of Saturday's ev6nts," claimed John Gaither, president of ND-SMC's Republican Club. The situation had the makings of potential disaster for college Republicans in Indiana. We did our thing, however, and showed Hartke was a jerk." 
festival. 
Berrigan, one of the Catons­ville Nine, failed to surrender April 9 to U.S. marshals to begin a three-year sentence for des­troying draft records at Catons­ville, Md., with home-made napalm in 1968. 
Berrigan stayed at the rally less than three hours, told the crowd, "the war must stop here," and that he would "be foolish to go to jail." He was then spirited away in a blue panel truck. 
Throughout the weekend, there was a nearly continuous schedule of anti-war speakers and entertainment by per­formers identified with the peace movement. 
Dr. Howard Levy, an Army doctor who refused to train Special Forces troops at Ft. Jackson, S.C., said President Nixon would not only be the first President to lose a war but also "the first President to lose an Army." 
David Dellinger, one of the "Chicago Seven" conspiracy trial defendants, said the Berrigan brothers had done more for the cause of peace and freedom than the "Chicago Seven." 
Daniel and his Josephite priest brother Phiii~, both Syracuse natives, have been active against the war for several years. 
Present awards 
The Notre Dame Knights of Columbus honored two of its members this week by present­ing to them the annual Knight of the Semester awards. Recipients of these awards were Robert Walton for the Fall Semester and Joe Capo for the Spring Semes­ter. 
These two men were very active in many council activities. Bob was chairman of the highly successful movie program as well as being active in the monthly dinner nights and the Mardi Gras. He also received the Knight of the Month award for October. Joe was membership chairman this year and under his guidance many new members were added. lie was also a dealer and carpenter for the Mardi Gras booth. The Knight of the Month award was presented to him in September.
