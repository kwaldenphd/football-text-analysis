Beyond Boxing 

"There arc somP, things women just shouldn't do." a s1•xist acquaintance said to me once. "Boxing is most definitely one of them." 
l le d1wsn 't know 111P women I know. 

Sim:e October, more than 100 woml'n at this University have pushed tlwms<'lvns to the limit for a sport that has typi­cally been off-limits. They learned not to assunrn lhal bPcausc they am female they could gBl hy wilh knnPs-011-the)-ground, "girl" pushups or do less stomach crunches because they arc "weaker" than lhe men. Thny learned jabs and powers and hooks; they shrouded their hands in smelly wraps and hid thr.ir grimaces when their hands hil tlrn cold, petrified sweat of the boxing gloves. 
ThPy am a team. evPn in a sport that rewards individual effort. 
Ther<l is a certain novelty attached to the idea of women wearing boxing gloves in this country: the thought conjures visions of perky blondes in spandex tittering "punch-and-one­and-two-and-th1·111•1" to prrky music in a perky aerobics room. This farcical attempt td' turn women's a,~robics into cute, manageable parodies or a sport that is traditionally male­dominatnd is popularly called "aeroboxing." 
This is nothing dose to what goes on at our boxing practices. 
The Notre Dame Women's Boxing Club is pnrhaps the largest collegiatr, wom<ln 's box­ing club in the country. There are no tryouts, no qualifications: you are allowed to be there if you possess the desire to be there. And there is nothing cute or perky about it; some­times practice rnquires a slmer will to sur­vive. 
I'm sure I could dazzle you with the physi­cal feats of this group of amazing women; how ladies who didn't think they could run a mile were doing 200 pushups in a blink by the end of the season. I could describe the hundreds or crunclrns and jumping jacks, the endless rounds of shadow boxing, the arm­circles. the drills. I could tell you what goes on at practice, but you could never rnally understand unless you did it yourself. 
This sport isn't about a bunch of femi-nazis getting together to prove that they are just as good as men. They don't want to beat each other up or lose weight. They aren't trying to pick up the guys who are lraining for Bengal Bouts with them in tandem, nor do they need to 1:arn tlrnir respr.ct. The reason that the Wom1)n's Boxing Club exists is because there an~ enough women on this campus who arc not afraid to try something new, who keep trying ,wen when that task seems too difficult for them. They want to learn a sport. not look cute and giggle in their workout clothes. 
Boxing has mad<l ill{' a stronger person, yPs, but also a morn conficl1mt, relax1:d per­son. l did something I nr.vm-thought I would he able\ to do. 1wasn't all that good at it, but instPad of feeling like a failure. th11 captains and my teammates only encouraged me to ker.p trying until I mastnred the punch or thr. block. S1wnn rounds, 800 crunches, 200 push ups and 700 jumping jacks aft('!" the fact, 1always folt satisfied with myseir, 1wen if every muscle in my body ached in the morn­ing. And I met so many others who felt the same way. 
Than ks l'or a grnat sP.asnn.

Wisconsin sweatshop protest reaches three days 
MADISON, Wis. "David Ward. who's your neigh­bor? Wn say no to sweatshop labor!" 
So chanted a group of more than 200 protesl!m; at the Basco111 llill rally Wednesday. The hlcary-eycd swnatshop activists -tired af'tnr a two-day sit-in -energized their fight against what they call UW-Madison complicity toward sweatshops. 
Thursday marks thn third day of the student sit-in, as the activists contin­ue to press Chancellor David Ward to agree to a stronger apparr.l licensing code. 
Tlrn sit-in has gradually increased in size, with nearly 60 students now occupying the halhvay outside of Ward's office. The students say they will stay in Bascom until Ward agrees to sign a written statement agreeing to three main codr additions. namely: immediate, full disclosure of factory

Students support same-sex marriage 
STORRS, Conn. 

The Undergraduate Student Government became one of the first student governments nationwide to support equal civil rights for same-sex marriages. In a vote of 23 to 6 Wednesday night, the senator's approved a "Marriage Resolution," written by the Lambda Legal Defonse and Education Fund, a gay advocacy group, that says "the state should not interfere with same-gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights, responsi­bilities, and commitment of civil marriage." More than 20 students and faculty turned out for the USG meeting to speak in favor of the passage of the resolution, including Professor Tim Saternow. Saternow, who is a homosexual, was the victim of an on-campus hate-crime last year, when the sign on his oflice door was set on fire. "Right now I'm faced with my rights as a professor," he said. "Straight facul­ty and staff get more pay and benefits than gay faculty and staffsimply because of marriage. It's a civil rights issue."_ 
¦ !{ENT STATE UN!VERSffV Faculty considering strike 
KENT, Ohio 

The Kent State faculty union will meet Friday to discuss the potential of a strike after a 14-hour negotiation ses­sion late last week. The Kent State Chapter of the American Association of Univ<lrsity Professors will meet for a normal negotiation session and a strike advisory meeting Friday. This follows nine months and 62 negotia­tion sessions. "I do not believe that the strike talk is help­ful to the university as a whole," James Louis, chief nego­tiator for Knnt Stat<l administration, said. "It certainly has no impact on my rn1gotiation t<lam. It will not f'orce the team to make any concessions or increase the spned of tho negotiations." The Action Committee of the AAUP-KSU schc~duled the meeting last month aft<lr tho 57th negotia­tion session with the University. The committnn estab­lished a Strik<l Preparation Subcommittnn whosn members will bE announced at the meeting.

Shampoo ingredient may block HIV

Scientists have spent years hunting spermicide-type gels lo help women bJ(lck tlw AIDS virus during sox. Now thcy'ro studying whether a common shampoo and toothpaste ingredient might work -and also offer protec­tion a~ainst cervical cancnr.

"But we'r•o cautious," she stressed, because researchers have lots of work -including turning the ingredient into a usable vaginal gel -befol'o initial testing in women could begin. 
The work is important because 5,000 American women and 250.000 womnn worldwide die from corvical cancer BV1iry year. IIPV is thought to be the most common sexually trans­mitterl infnrtion. It is often without symptoms, but can cause genital warts as well as lead tt> cervical cancer. 
"If' you could e!iminnt:n (HPV), you could potentially prevent all those can• cers," said Penn State microbiologist Mary K. Howett.

Thr Court or Cassation ruled Wednesday it is impossible to take off tight pants like jnans "without tlw coopi•ration of the person wearing them," and it said it is impossible if the victim is struggling. 
Baggy jeans aren't popular in Italy. and many women prefer tight pants. 
Tim dncision overturned the 1998 conviction or a 45-year­old driving instructor in south­ern Italy, Carmine Cristiano, for raping an 18-year-old student. A lower court had sentenced Cristiano to two years and eight months in prison. but the appeals rourt said the girl must have consented to sex and sent the case back for retrial. 
The court also questioned why the victim, identified only as Rosa. waited several hours to tell hor parents she'd beon attacked.

Ladd th<m rcforrnd to llarrigan as "a nice guy" who can somotimos be a jerk ir you hang out in his room playing Jedi Houge Squadron too long.

Harrigan blames his comments on the illegally purchased beer he had consumed r.arli­cr in the nvcning. 
Not getting any at Notre Dame is a fairly common occurrence, assures Universitv Health Servir,cs counselor Jeff Torrence. "Most ~otrc Dame stu­dents aren't gr,tting any," he says. "When I look out my office window and watt-h the students go by. I say lo myself, 'Now there's a group of people not getting any.· Mikr,'s situation is com­p)Pt<1ly normal."

A male and a female meet on :1-lorth Quad and embark on love's Journey. 
To start the relationship. thP male and female have a beautiful date. The night ends with a nightcap in the male's dorm room. The near future: 
Female: Adhf!res to the «three-day rule," by which she can make no con-

Mair: Thinks it is perfectly normal to not wash the cup that the girl drank from. ;:,lcep with it each night and carry ii with him wherever he goes until she returns his myriad of phone calls -which, of course, she won't until the three days are up. 
Advantage: Female. I don't like mind games, but fetishes are evPn worse. FEMALE 1-0. 
Once the three-day probationary period is up. they admit to each othPr that thev had fun.

dinner at a beautiful restaurant. At the restaurant they arc seated together on the sam0 side of a booth. An attractive couple of the same age strides toward them 011 the way to their table. 
Femalo thinks: Look at his chPst1 
Male thinks: Look at her chest! 
No advantage. They both kept their mouths shut. Still FEMALE 2-1. 
Later in the evening, an absolutely smokin· femal.e walks .in and turns every hrad in the place. r mean. slrn is SEUH-MOKIN'. The kind of girl who makes you bite down llAHD on your lip when she walks by. She's got curVPs in places most people don't have places, l.egs up to her neck. and an ethnic look that you can't quitci place -you just know you want to be on the next plane to wherever she's from in the hopes she has a little sister. 
Female: "Look at everyone else look­ing at her. Thank God I don't have the kind of man that just snaps llis neck around at every hotty that walks in here. Just look at all tlrnse guys cran­ing their necks just to get a. look. Thank God you're different. You prob­ably don't even think she's ... Oh, My God. Iloney1 Your lip is bleeding! It's gushing blood!" 
Advantage: Female was blathering again. Male controlled himself. TIE GA\1E 2-2.

"Braveheart" so he can watch people break stuff and she can watch the love-storyline. The first snowfall of the year begins to fall. 
Female: "Look at the beautiful snow. There are so many parallels betwr.en human life and the life of the snowflake. Each snowflake is unique ­just likA humans. Both snowflakes and humans havr their fate controlled by so many external factors. Have you ever thought about how we're just likr snowflakes? Look. honey, it's starting to lay on the ground. Like a mantle of white ... blah ... blah ... " 
!\Tale is thinking: CooJ! I can write my name in the snow! Wait. Hold on. Wait until she leaves. 
Advantage: Male. She was blather­ing. He thought before acting. TIE GAME 1-1. 
Tim main controls himself, and even­tually gets to write his name in the snow. He spends the rest of the night r:ussing his parents for naming him with a name with an "i" in it because it's so difficult to dot an "i" whilP writ­ing orw's name in the snow. 
A fow wer.ks and a few dates pass and they are talking about their µlans f"or tlw wPnkrnd in the dining hall. 
Female: "You know what tomorrow is, don't you'.'"

Female: "Do you ... " 
Male: "Not now. honey -the commercials arc on." 
Female: "But you said ... " 
Male: "I know, but these are the Super Bowl commercials. They're dif­ferent. Just let me watch." Female: "So these commercials are more important than me?" 
Male: "Trust me, honev: You don't want to make me make that choice." Advantage: Female. Male needs to 
educate before snapping. FE\1ALE 3-2. 
Some time goes by and Easter comes up. They split ways. The first thing heard coming home from school when their parents haven't seen them for 4 months: 
Mother to daughter: "Have you met anyone yet? When are you going to meet someone? When are you going to get married? I want grandchildren. When are you going to have kids?" 
Father to son: "You haven't had any kids since the last time w11 saw you, right?" 
Advantagti: l\falc. The fatlrnr asks once, breathes a sigh of relif'f and puts a lid on it. The mother calls and con­tinually asks the daughter's answering machinP aftt~r shP goPs back to school. TIE GAME 3-3. 
After Easter there is an rncl-of-the­yoar formal. As males have a frndrncy to do, the male has loo much to drink. But he makes it through the night upright rwcn though he can barnly se(' straight. The time comes to part ways. 
Male: "G'11tc, I had a wund11 ... wonclr ... grnai time ... you wr tho grtst date nv ... " 
Female's Brist Frirnd (to whom Uw ma!P is spPaking): "Um, I wasn't your datP. Your datP's ovn tlrnrP."

Female: "Eddie, I love you." Male; "I love vuu, too Sarah." Female: "MY.NAME IS LISA1" Advantage: Female. Mistaken identi­
ties twice in just a few weeks? Ouch. FEMALE 5-3. 
Summer comes, and thP male has the good for­tune of living • • • • • right near his girlfriend's • • • • •best friend. The cat of the girlfriend's best friend nerds some­whNe to stay for a few weeks while she goes and gots her internship set up. 
Female: "Well, Snuggles could stay with you, couldn't he'? I mean, C'mon. he's the _same color as the rug in your living room. Wouldn't Snuggly-Wuggly just look adorable in your living room?" 
Male: "Wouldn't Snuggly-Wuggly just look adorable in my blender?" Advantage: Male. The only good cat is a dead cat. FEMALE 5-4. 
The summer passes uneventfully, but they both change over the summPr. They are still feeling each other out for the changes when they enter a partic­ularly heated political debate. The topic is affirmative action and the sub­ject of feminism comes up: 
Female: "A woman can do anything a man can do." Male: "OK, Miss Equality, name for me all the female Presidents." 
Advantage: Female. This one's kind of self-explanatory. He needs to count to 10 before speaking when emotions run high. FEMALE 6-4. 
The realize they've both changed over the summer, so they decide it's best to part ways. Right after a "Let's just be friends" talk, they decide to walk campus to talk about some of the 
' J:"'E:MALE: So THESE r COMMERCIALS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN 
ME?' 
'MALE: TRUST ME, HONEY: YOU DON'T 
WANT TO MAKE ME MAKE 
THAT CHOICE.' 
things llwy could never talk aboul when they wPre a couple. 
Fcmaln: "ThPre really are no good guys lwre at Notre Danw. I mean, thPre's that Joey Goodspeed kid, but he lives in Zahm. so hr. must hn gay like tlw rest of'thern." 
The coup!,~ is approaching Lnwis llall. 
Female (continuing): "Nope. There really are no good guys at Notre Dame. What do you think, honey?" 
Male: "Do you think this is Lucki's dorm'! She said it began with an 'L,' right'?" 
Advantagn: Female. Talking about lntt~nwt porn with the opposite S(~x'( Probably a good rulP to st,1y away l'rom that one. FEMALE 7-4. 
Now that they've broken up. they decide that they have too much past and what-not to throw the relationship away and not be friends, so they try the honesty thing on for size. The female tries on some new slacks and wants "an honest opinion." 
Female: "Be honest." Male: "Yeah, right." Female:• • • • "No, really. Be honest. Do• • • • • these pants make my butt • • • • • look big'?" Male: "Jlonestly9" Female: "Yeah." 
Mah\: "Nope. The pants don't make your butt look big. But the fact that your butt is big makes your butt look big." 
Advantag,1: Mair!. But tlw friendship is pretty much over at that 
point. See, she said "honest." IIP !ward "honest." But they are apparently two very different words. Jlp was speaking English, she was spr.aking F<'malP. This is America, af'ter all. so we'll go with English. FEMALE 7-:i. 
The only thing IPl't to explorP arP tlw irate letters to br. written to Tlw Observer in rnspons,~ to this column. 
Female: "I have no sense of humor, and I think that you am, um, demean­ing toward womPn. I havo nothing more to say, but I will drone on for 800-1000 words anyway saying tlw EXACT SAME STINKING THING. /\nd I really hated that part at tlw end of your column whPrP you made the female writn the exact same letter I am now writing." 
Male: "Will someone please date m(1'? I really have nothing to say, but I will seize this, and any other opportunity, to make myself look like I cam about how females on campus fed. Of course, if I actually did care how tlw females on campus feel. I wouldn't need to write this lettfir, but, likP I said, WILL SOMEONE PLEASE DATE ME?" 
No one gets any points for such a 
display of public idiocy. Females win, 7-:i. See, gals, we've shown that it's easi­
er to be female nowadays -we males may be a little clumsy with words, but what comes out or our mouths isn't necessarily what's in our hearts.

This weekend, Saint Mary's College sophomores celebrate their parents with aweekend in their honor 

By KRISTI KLITSCH 
Scene Editor 
About 18 years ago, a group of students on Saint Mary's Sophomore Class Board approached the administration with the idea of bringing together sophomores and their parents for an official, school-sponsored weekend. 
The weekend, entitled Sophomore Parnnts' W1rnkend (SPW), would be the complement to Junior Parents' Weekend at the University of Notre Dame, and would be open to any Saint Mary's sophomore, said Georgeanna Hosenbush, direc­tor of Student Activities at Saint Mary's. 
The first weekend was promoted as a follow-up to orienta­tion weekend, and included a talent show, academic open house, educational programs, a class mass, Prnsident's reception and social dinner/dance, said Rosenbush. 
The event proved to be a hugo success, and SPW soon became an annual tradition for the sophomore class. "Sophomore Parents' Weekend is the oldest and most official college weekend at Saint Mary's." said Hosenbush. "At om\ point we had more than 1100 total people !students and !heir parents combined] participating." 
This year more than 150 students and their parents "ill participate in the SPW activities, said SPW chairperson ~ 1 1i ._ Marie Kahn. The theme of thP weekend is "The Gm Gifts: Hoots and Wings," stemming from the quotation: "'ll is said that we need roots to ground us, feed us and help us grow and wings on which on fly." 
The weekend will kick off this evening, as students and their parents have an opportunity to tour the College Football llall of Famn. 
Saturday bngins with an acad dnr.ts, parents and faculty a ch a social setting.

Emily Junius, a junior who helped in Lim planning of' Sl'W last ynar, agrned with Kahn. 
"It was just a great nxp<~ricnce," she said. "My parnnls real­ly nnjoynd meeting my friend's parents. It is a grNtt tradition, and I am happy that I was given tlw opportunity to help plan tlrn event." 
For Erin I !all, last year's SPW chairperson, watching tlw weekend run so smoothly madr. all the planning worthwhile. 
"I think Lhat last yHar we had a grnat turnout. Evrerything wr.nt prntly smoothly, and w•• had no major probl<~ms," slH' said. 
"My parents lovod it. Thny lovod meeting my profossors and getting to s1in the campus again," Hall added.

Nett-ers look:r 

upset No. IO DU 
By NATHANIEL DeNICOLA 
Spom W ri rer 
Notre Dame men's tennis team will look to s.tiffo its two•game losfog stref).k Saturday as it host No. 10 Duke. 
ln the past two weeks, the Irish have sustained fusses to No. 7 Texas and No. 26 Kentucky. each t.ime falling just short 4-3. 
"Those were two tough losses in a row." said junior all-American Ryan Sachire, "but bv no means are we dis­couraged." 
Not only have the 24th­ranked Irish proven they can compete with some. of the nation's top teams (both.loss­es Texas and Kentucky were decided in the last match), but they also have history on their side, having defeated a higher-ranked Duke team for two straight years. 
As head coach Bob Bayliss explained, "The tradition of this match is an exciting one, the play is always very com­petitive." 
Fierce competition has been no stranger to the Irish this season. 
"Duke has a very talented team, I expect another match like Texas", said>Bayliss. "Though we will have to play hard to get there." 
Leading the charge into battle is third-ranked Sachire, who will attempt to continue his domination at No. 1 singles where he will face either all-American Doug Root or LSU transfer Pedro Esudero.

Cooke regains control of 'Skins 
Associate Press 
ASHBURN. Va. 
On the eve of free agency, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue on Thursday night stepped into a power struggle involving the Washington Redskins and declared presi­dent John Kent Cooke in charge of the team. 
Tagliabue's move came after trustees of the estate of Cooke's late father demanded final authoritv for anv and all dealings, leav.ing general man­ager Charley Casserly and r.oach Norv Turner pow+>rless and the team in danger or losing several key free

"The commissioner acted after learning that the special committee of the trustees for Jack Kent Cooke's estate recently denied management the authority to re-sign cer­tain players." 
Casserly, whose hands had been tied by the trustees at the bargaining table, immedi­ately got on the phone and reopened negotiations with quarterback Trent Green and others. He also cut disen­chanted quarterback Gus Frerotte, saving the team a $1.25 million roster bonus that would have been due at the end of the month. 
"It means we have the go­ahead to operate," Casserly said. "We've done that. We've talked to Trent Green's agent. We'll be on the phone at 12:01 tonight talking to other free agents." 
The Redskins' future remains in limbo, however. as NFL owners consider whether to approve the sale of the team to a group headed by brothers Howard and Edward Milstein and Daniel Synder for a league-record $800 million. The trustP.es of' the late Cooke's estate agreed to sell the team to the Milstr,in­Snyder group on Jan. 10. Three-fourths of' the NFL team owners must give their con­sent.

Then tlw annual prc-frc11 agency pross r,onference was canceled Thursday with just two hours' notice.

organization were hoping that approval would come at an owners' meeting next week in Atlanta. but that meeting was canceled Thursday. The next scheduled meeting of the full ownership is March 14-18 in Phoenix. 
Some owners have said they would have preforred that Cooke's son, .John Kent Cooke, purchase the team. Hut the younger Cooke, who has rep­resented the Hndskins at league meetings for nearly 20 years, was not able to outbid Milstein and Snyder in a months-long action conducted by the trustees. 
"The NFL's finance commit­tee meets Monday Feb. 15 in Atlanta to continue its review of the Redskins sale," the NFL statem1mt said. "No committee recommendation on the sale is no basis for concluding 
that current manage­ment is in any way acting other than in tl111 host inter­ests of tlrn club." 
In a letter to the trustees, Tagliabue advised that tlH1y should not "make any changes or restrict in any way" .John Kent Cooke's current status or authority to manage thP Redskins.

"That's lh!-! way you like to do it, particularly whr.n you can lrnrp pm1pltl or that quality." Huf'falo genf'ral rnanngnr John Butler said. 
"You know what your own play11rs can do -on and off tlrn tield. You're nevt•r sure when you bring in nnw pcopln. But that doesn't mean you won't look to plug holes or br. forced to let p11opln go brcausP. of the cap 
Hight now, teams am looking to rid thcmsrlvl'S of players whoso salaries exceed thP.ir valu<'. This ynar's salary cap is just short of' $57.:l million. $5 million morr. than lasl year. 
Quarwrback .foff George, his $5 million salary and his qur.s­lionablc attitude. might be out or Oakland. 
Tho Carolina Panthers dropped two of their originals -drfr.nsiv" lineman Mike Fox and oft-injurnd linebacker Lamar Lathem; San Francisco is likely to dispose of cornerhack Marqurz Pope and running back Terry Kirby and is restructuring othp,r salaries, Buffalo saved $4 million by rid­ding itsr.lf of vr-tr.rans Quinn Early and Wayne Simmons and New Orll~ans has made it known it won't re-sign troubled quarterback Kerry Collins. pichd up from Carolina last season. 
There's also an X-factor. thr. now Clevoland Browns, who wr.nt rheap in the expansion draft ll'aving tlrnm close to $40 million to spend on frPe agents, meaning they can outbid almost anyonr. For examplr, they ari~ reporlrdly ready to bid $5 mil­lion a voar for defensive end Chad 1irat7,ke of thr. Now York Giants. a number tho Giants probably won't try to matl'h. 
Tlw cleeprst position in free ag(•ncy is wide recf'iver. headrd hy All-l'ro Antonio FrPeman of Cr1"1·n Bay. who is likely to be givnn a franchise playnr tag LO protect him. Cincinnati did the same this week with Carl Pickens. whom they may tradP 
l'or the two first-round draft picks that come with that tag. Arizona might do the same with Rob Moon•. 
others available includfl J..f. Stok11s of San Francisco, Sean Dawkins of Nf1w Orleans. Charles Johnson of Pittsburgh and Leslie Shepherd of Washington. The 49ers' Terrnll Owens, a restrirtPd f'rnc agPnt, might be the most attractive and could go because San Francisco is nearly $30 million over the cap and probably can't match a pre-emptive ol'for from a team with money, like the nrowns. 
The sucress of the Vikings contrasts with thP way other teams have thrown money around with little rP.sult. For example, Seattle spcmt millions on big-name free agents for the second straight year, but fin­ishPd 8-8, costing coarh Dc~nnis Erickson his job. One problem: tho revolving door gamr in which the Seahawks lost cpntcr Knvin Mawa<>. who wenl to lhti New York Jets and bC'came thP. hub of thP-ir vastly improvnd olfonsivr. line. 
That's what makes frne agency risky. 
Many players are improvrd by the playPrs around them, like wide i\lvin Ilarper, a stand­

Irish challenge Milwaukee's best 
By WES RICHARDSON Spon~ Wrirc-r 
ThP. Notre Dame men's swim team will have· its last chance to break even on dual meets todav when it faces the Universftv of Wisconsin­Milwaukee. · 
The team's record is 3-4, and the Irish are the !ltrong favorites to win. This is also the last meet before the Big East Championships, to be held Feb. 25-27 in Uniondale, N.Y. 
Despite beating host Wisronsin-Milwaukee 1083­
921. 5 at the Bill Ritter lnvitational in Januarv, the Irish arc not going in·over­confident. 
"We've always been able to beat them pretty handily. but they've gotten better every vear, and this is their best year," co-captain Steele Whowell said. "We can't overlook them because they do have some speed." 
An unexpected challenge has also arisen, according to Whowell. One of Wisconsin­Milwaukee's best swimmers did not compete in the invi­tational, but will be compet­ing today. 
There are also differences between dual and invitation­al meet formats that will affect scoring. 
"It's more importar ~ to win ~. ents," Who well said of dual meets. ··we can't outscore them by getting second or third place !in individual events]." 
One fact in particular has plagued the Irish men this season: They have no divers. Wisconsin-Milwaukee will have three divers each com­peting in two events, putting Notre Dame at an immediate 32-point disadvantage. 
Despite these challenges, many team members are looking forward to improve their personal best times in events they do not normally swim. 
Timing is also a factor. With championships less than two weeks away, 

today's meet is the last opportunity for the team· to prepare in a competitive race. 
"It's a final chance to race and tune up. I can't think of anything but good reasons for this meet," assistant coach Jonathan Jennings said. 
A large part of preparing for a meet as important as the three-day championships is decreasing the distance swum in practice while increasing the intensity and periods of rest. Today's meet comes in the middle of the team's taper. This ,•,ill aid in preparation for champi­onships. according to Jennings. 
"As you get faster through your taper, it's good to race at [meetJ speed," he said. 
'IT'SIMPORTANT TO WIN EVENTS. WE CAN'T 
OUTSCORE THEM BY GET­
TING SECOND OR THIRD 
PLACE.' 
STEELE WHOWELL 
SWIMMING CC>-CAPTAIN 
"We're starting to tape.r seriously this week, so hope­fully we'll swim faster than normal," Sean Casey said. 
The last dual meet between the two teams occurred less than one week before the last Big East Championships. The scheduling for this sea­son is closer to ideal, accord­ing to Jennings. 
Today, the Irish will need to keep Wisconsin­Milwaukee from winning the 50-and 100-yard freestyle. 
. The sprint events have given Notre Dame trouble in the past, arid team illnesses have made this problem worse. Notre Dame will need to take advantage of its strength jn distance and 200-'vard events to make up the difference. ·

Irish look to rebound at WVU 
By BILL HART 
Assistanr Sports Editor 
Rebounding from a close loss 
is a difficult process for any 
basketball team. 
When that team is forced to make that rebound on the road, it becomes an even more complex task. Yet that's exact­ly what the Irish men's basket­ball team must do Sunday, when it heads eastward to face the West Virginia Mountaineers. 

-
Whispers of a possible post­season berth were put on hold Wednesday night when Georgetown defeated Notre Dame 62-53. 
Despite forcing 15 turnovers 
in tl1P first half and holding a 12-point-lead at the break. the home team \Vas unable to overcome a scrappy Hoya defense that had 22 steals. a new record for a Big East con­test. While two Irish players, forward Troy Murphy and cen­ter Phil Hickey. had 15 and 12 points, respectively, it wasn't enough to turn the tide of the second half. 
"Obviously, everyone's a lit­tle down right now," forward David Graves said. "To be so close to winning and having it fall like that is tough. This tean, 's got composure, though, and wo should be able to bounce back." 
Fortunately for the !risb, the Mountaineers have had their share of bad luck as well. West Virginia is on a five-game Big East losing skid, falling to 12th place in the conference stand­ings. The Mountaineers have had five straight defeats at home for the first time in more than 70 years. 

In their most recent game, an 80-68 loss to eighth-ranked St. John's, junior Marcus Goree led with 22 points, and forward Elton Scott chipped in with 17. While the team shot more than 50 percent from the field, it just wasn't able to keep up with a tremendous Red Storm offense that had four players in double figures and shot 10-20 from three­point range. 
Goree, Scott and sophomore 
guard Jarett Kearse are the 
three main offensive weapons 
the Mountaineers offer. A 6­
foot-6 forward out of Dallas, 
Texas, Goree has started in 
every game this season and is 
scoring at a 16.2 point clip. 
Kearse provides the perimeter 
threat, shooting 40. 7 percent 
from behind the arc and aver­
aging 12.7 points per game. 
The two teams met only once 
last year, a battle in 
Morgantown where the Irish 
squeaked away with a 74-72 
win. In that game, both teams 
held dose until Mountaineer 
Jarrod West shot an airball 
from 25 feet back that 
bounced out-of-bounds. 
The Irish got the ball back 
wilh""11.4 seconds remaining. 
Guard Keith Friel beat the full­
court press and sank the game 
winning shot with four-tenths 
of a second left to play.

down there, and we didn't get much respect," guard Jimmy Dillon said. "But we went down there and got a big win. I hope we can do it again this year." 
The loss ended a 10-game home winning streak for West Virginia, which later finished the season at l 1-7 in the Big East and (1arned an at-large bid into the NCAA Tournament. This year, how­ever. with a 3-11 conference mark and a 9-15 record over­all, the Mountaineers are sim­ply trying to stay alloat. 
That's something the Irish 
hope to use to their advantage, 
according to Dillon. 
"We're going to have to get 
after them defensively," he 
said. "We're going to have to 
control the tempo of the game 
and hit some shots."

First round babies grow up, learn life's lessons 
By BRIAN CHURNEY SpomWritcr 
Pop quiz, hotshot: What do Eric Lindros. Todd Van Poppel. .t.D. Dri>w. and Danny Ferry have in common? 
They all play professional sports. y1•s. ThP.y all were draft­ed in the top five of their r1•spcctive sports draft, right. Thev all havP bPen traded or redtafted by another team, right again. 
Now hold on before you claim that I've just described about 500 professional ath!P.tP.s. While these four players have much more than oim quality in com­mon. the most significant quali­ty tlrny sharf! is Lhat all began their carPers by pulling LhA most immaturn. disrespectful act in all of sporLs. No. they werPn 't arrcstPd for solir.iting prostitution, that only comes later in careers. 
They simply rPfused to play. Some team. through hours of Pvaluations and dm:ision-mak­ing. decided that tlrny werf' will­ing lo invest its future in these four players only to be lig-ura­li\·ely spat upon more quickly than you can say Hoberto Alomar. 
Now many ath)()t()S hold out. While I'm not willing to make any excuses for them, most of those athlctfls have proven themselves in the lflague (insert Pavel Bure), or eventually play for the team that drafted them. 
Not these four line examples of charactr.r. Thcv deemed themselves wortl{y of choosing which team they got lo play for. Can we all say together. "I think I'm bigger than the game I have yet to begin."? 
These four athletes have had 
to pay for their crimes too. Let's 
take a look at the crimes that 
these four athletes have com­
mitted and the punishments 
they've rightfully endured. 
Ferry's crime: Drafted by the sad-sack Los Angeles Clippers. he opted to play in Italy for a year. He didn't evrm wait until after his obligatory post-draft interview (vou know the one where the draftee dons the cap of his future team and smiles a lot) to announc<' that Europe was a distinct possibility. 
Ferry. howt!ver, paid dearly 
for his crirn<'. After a vear in 
Europe Im returned t~ the play­
off-bound Clnveland Cavaliers. 
It's safe to call his career since 
returning, an utter disappoint­
ment. Averaging only 7.9 
measly points and a paltry three 
rebounds a game, Ferry has 
hardly made the Clippers miss 
their former pick. 
What's morn, Ferry has 
t'ndured 82 ganws a·season, 
watching Mike FratC'llo's less­
than-elfictrifying olfonse, which 
is quite possibly a worse pun­
ishment tha11 having to don a 
Clips jnrsey. 
Van Poppcl's critn(\: This 
"can't miss. hut somehow I did" 
pitcher was sl'li•ctcd first hy the 
Atlanta Braves. lie. however. 
declined to play !'or them. He 
dicln 't,,want to play for a ''losing 
lnam. 
So, allnr sitting out a year, hn 
was re-select!'d by the Oakland 
A's. This pu11ishITrnnt definitely 
tit thn crime. Van Poppel got his 
wish to he picked by a "winning 
t()am." Tho A's won for the next 
thrnn years. 
However. since tlwn they 
have bem1 what. managers like 
tn call "rnbuilcling." 
Lnfortunalf,ly !'or Van Poppel. he didn't have the foresight of his former 1!mployr.rs. Sure. tlu, Braves weren't the power house that the' A's were at tht' time. 

Instead, they were busy build­ing arguably the best pitching rotation in baseball history. 
In fact. the Braves have been playing !'or the pennant evAry year since Van Poppel dcnmed them unworthy of a pitcher the quality of him. As for Van Poppel, he has proven that his long term baseball forecasting is nearly as good as his pitching ability. 
Ile has been yo-yoing back and forth between Major League mP.diocrity and Minor League obscurity. To add insult to injury, lrn was recPntly trad­ed to ... THE PIRATES. where h<•'s about as likely to he on "a winning team" as Harry Caray is to call a World Series. 
Drew's crime: DrPw, the first pick by the Philadelphia Phillies. refused to play for the modest soven-figur0 salary that lhe Phillies offonid him. lie fllflr.ted instead to sit out an entire year and be re-draftod by the SL Louis Cardinals. It's almost too soon to see if Drew will get his due. 
However, he took a severe f1ogging in the mt•clia. including being named "Jerk of the Week" several times and had to play for the St. Paul Saints for a season. 
Drew's incredible major league debut last season, rather than being revered as it would have a season before, became a footnote to Big Mac's feats. The !'ew games he did play makes him ineligible for Rookie of the Year -an honor that selfish players like Drew covet. 
Lindros's crime: Lindros, tout­ed as the next Gretzky, was selected first overall by the Quebec Nordiques-turned Colorado Avalanche. Lindros, however, decided that he didn't want to live or play in a place where you were as likely to eat escargot as you were a ham­burger. 
By sitting on the sidelines. 
Lindros forced the Nordiques to 
trade him to the Philadelphia 
Flyers for half of the Flyers

Well, in the spirit of justice, the Nordiquus took their newly acquirt>cl tl'am and moved to Denver where you're as likely to find someone speaking French as you are a winning basketball team. While Lindros has devel­oped into one of the premiere players in tho league, his hands are still unjewcled. while his old team. thP AvanlanchP, is sport­ing a championship ring. Sorry, Eric. 
While these four athletes have in some way paid for their crimos. one athlete exists that has somPhow r0vcrsed thP rTucl band of sports fate. Jfo was tho athlete that. in ess1-mce began the "first pick bissy fit" syn­drome. 
Tout.Pd as one of the grnatest college quarLerbacks ever Lo enter the NFL draft. John Elway was exactly what the winless Colts neP.Cled. ,\mid all the quar­terbacks in the famed 198:1 draft, Elwav stood head and shoulders ~bove his competi­tion. The Colts gambled on Elway. despite his protest<;. 
Rather than play in the city of B11ltimore, Elway threati>ned to pursue a medioue baseball career. Baltimore was then forced to trade Elway to the Broncos. In return, the Colts got the less-than-legendary Chris Hinton. 
Elway's crime against the legitimacy of the draft far exceeded that of the aforemen­tioned four athletes. For he was the first stonein the avalanche, the rain drop that predicated the flood. 
Early in his career Elway paid 
for his misdoing. He was known 
as the quarterback who lost 
three Super Bowls. 
Broadcasters questioned his 
heart, his maturity and his self­
lessness. He was appropriately 
known as a "me first" player. 
Two years ago, however, all 
of that changed. Elway !inally 
won a Super Bowl. Everyone 
seemed to be ecstatic for John. 
"It's about time" was the pre­
vailing sentiment. No one

seemed to rnmember his previ­ous failings or his selfish deci­sion. 
Then this year came, the last hurrah. Rlway won again. The broadcasters suddenly deemf!d him a saint, all that was good about sports. Somehow, with two wins Elway became a folk hero. The new debate centered around whether he should retire or come back for another try. Popular sentiment seemed to favor him retiring on top like Jim Brown. Rocky Marcianno and Michael Jordan. 
Well. add my name to the short list that wants Elway to come back !'or another year. Not because I want to sne him lead another fourth quarter cnm<'­back or "throc-poat." My inten­tions are not nearly as nice. 
I want Elway to com!' back for Lhe simple reason that I don't think he deserves to go out like he did. Now, don't get mo wrong, I think Elway is an incredihlP, quarterback and a de!initc Ilall-of-Famer. I have an aunt that wnnt to Stanford with him and she says hP's a class guy as well.

Ttw Irish ar«' hoping that tlwir first contPst at Munn this y«'ar will prndun• similar rPsults lo thf' first onP last yPar. After losing the night before to tlu~ Spartans 5-1, Notre Oame handed No. 2 Michigan State its first loss or the sr.ason. 6-1. The four-goal explosion in thr. third period helped put Notre Dame back on the co!!egr. hockey map with its biggr.st vict()ry in over a d!1cadc. 
Saturday night, Notre Dame will face the Ferris State Bulldogs. with possibly their unbPatr-n homP record still on thP line. This will be the Bull.dogs' only rngular-season visit l.o the Joyce C.r.ntPr. 
So far, the Irish are 10-0-2 at home, and have outscored their opponents 55-21. Although their current streak could add pressure this late in the season, Bon~ga disagrees. 
"I think it's a lot more relax­ing to play at home. especially with the fans and the way they've been," Borcga said. "Wn do play helter here. and we r.xpect it now." 
Coach Slaggert said. "I don't think it adds pressure. What it does is that in tight games, it gives our guys a little more confidencP ... That's just 
another factor in our favor." 
The FSU game, like all February games, is a crucial one, but for more reasons than just the two points that are on the linr.. 
Saturday's game will decide thn season series between the Irish and Ferris State, with each team notching a two-goal vktory in tlrn first half of the season. Currently. FSU sits just five points behind fourth­pl ace Notre Dame, and thr. season series would be tlrn first tiebrr.aker should the two teams finish deadlockPd. 
As they have since the early part or the season, Notre Dame still leads thti confer­ence with a power play effi­ciency of 24.5 pflrcent. This week<rnd. however, they will be facing the top two penalty­ki lIi ng units in tlrn CCIIA in Michigan State and Ferris State. who are f'irst and sec­ond rnspectively. In addition. Ferris Stat11 is also thr. h\agu1\'s least penalized team, which means the Irish will need to make thfl b1ist of the fow pow<>r play opportunities thr.y get.

Riley faces stiff challenge versus Rutgers 
By ANTHONY BIANCO As,istJnr Spurts [diror 
Thf'ir Sf'asons af!'! down to Llw v.irP and the lines dividing the top teams arc even thinner. 
With just thn•e games sepa­rating the No. 1 and No. 3 teams in the Hig East and four games ldt on thr, Irish sched­ule. the backdrop for the biggest gamP or the year is set. 
The No. 6 Irish will race the Scarlet Knights in New Jersey, thPir biggest challenge since playing first-ranked Connecticut rm Dec. 8 -a gam!' in which the HuskiP-s simply outplayed thl'm by a final of 106-81. 
Holding the third confor£'nce spot, a win in Saturday's game at No. 2 Rutg<"rS !21-4, 13-1) will swap the Irish in the rank­ings. 
~we ri>alize how hugP this game is," said Niele Ivey. "We necd to go in there mentally forusf'd. Because if we don't, I think we're going to have a 1ough timt>. Physically I think wp"]l bf' oka,·." 
PPrhaps tiw gri>atest threat that thP Scarlet Knights pose is sophomore center Tammy Sutton-Brown. She won the Big East ro-playt>r of the week along with Ivey this past week, an>raging 16.0 points and 7.0 rrbounds, helping Rutgers to two conferenC'e road wins last week. 
"It's going to be a tough matchup," said Ruth Riley, who will battle against Sutton­Brown beneath the basket. 

''She's bigger than most of thf' post players we face, so it'll be a little different with her pres­f'ncf' in thf' middle." 
The 11-game win streak coach Mul'fet McGraw·s team has weaved together since January has come in large part to Notre Dame's de.fcnsivP focus. Since thf' start of thf' New Year. ~otre Dame has allowed just a litth~ more than 60 points a game. This contin­ues to be the game plan they will stiek to throughout the postseason and on Saturday. 
"We need to do it on defense," said Ivey. "The offonse I think will come. We just n<>cd to focus on getting the job done." 
Riley has been the one the Irish have turned to this sea­
son whrn U1f'y net'.ded to get the job done on the attack. She' enters into the final two weeks of play first in the Big East in scoring with 19.2 points per gamP., Armed with Sutton­Brown, Rutgers will attempt to take Riley out of the game early, something the opposition has attempted with increasing success in rectmt games. 
Fortunately, Notre Oame fields its strongest-ever team, always having the ability to fill open holes with shooters. Such was the case last Saturday against Seton Hall. when a slt_1ggish offense slowed mainly by tough play on Riley gave the Irish only a six-point lead at halftime. Villanova repeated the early opponent successes last Wednesday, but was unable to control it the wholr game. 
"'Against Villanova we start­ed out slow and didn't get going un ti! the second half," said Ivey. "Then we started tn step up our intensity and I think everyone contributed to the win, That's something we are going to have to do against Rutgers." 
The intensity has also come from thP. bench in recent games, as shown in last Saturday's game against the Pirates, Freshman guard Ericka Haney gave the Irish

With Riley gPlting most or tlw attention on offrnse. she and the rest of the team will add to the surprise attack by giving the hench players a srcond look.

Tonight's matchup is the serond of thrt>e ronspcutive rriday-night games between NoLn~ Dame and third-ranked Michigan Strite. The Spartans are 9-0-3 at Munn lee Arena and, besides the Irish, are the onlv CCI-IA team still unde­feated at home. In last Fridav's 2-2 tie, one major issue or"concern for the Irish was their performance in the faceoff circle, MSU cen­ters Mike York and Shawn Horcoff dominated the Irish for much of the game, hut Notre Dame centers are ready for the rematch, according to freshman center David Inman. "We've been practicing our draws because it's something we haven't been doing so well 
on lately," Inman said. 
However, the importance of winning faceoffs should not be overstated, assistant coach Andy Slaggert said. 
"It's a vital part of the game, but it's not always that the team that wins the most faceoffs wins the game," Slaggert said. "The faceoff coverage is actually more important than the results of the faceoff itself."

key to Irish wins 
By MIKE CONNOLLY

How do you follow a legend? How do you inherit a dy11asty and improve upon it'? 
These questions faced fenc­ing head coach Yves Auriol in 1996, when he took over aftor Irish coaching legend Michael DeCicco retired. Having already been the women's head coach and a men's assis­tant coach, Auriol was well­prepared to r,oach both the men's and women's teams. 
Even with Auriol's experi­ence, DeCicco was no easv act to follow. He guided the fenc­ing program to five national titles in his 34 years and com­f'urtlrnr than just tlw ,:ollngiat1\ l<~vnl, IIP is also highly rnspectcd in intnrnational f'nnc.ing. lln was thP lrnad coach of thn USA womnn's tnam al tlw 1980.

ment." 
Piling victory upon victory, his squad finished second at the see HOCKEY/ page 17 : NCAA championships in his 
first vear. Diiregarding any notions of a sophomore slump, Auriol 
lished him­self as one of the top fencing coaches in the world. 
Ile moved to the United States in 1972 to lrnlp his brother Leon coach fencing in Portland, Ore. Tim Auriols established the Salle Auriol Fencing Club and offered pri­vate lessons to groups and individuals. 
Portland State recognized Auriol's talent and hired him as a fencing coach in 1975. He remained with PSU until 1985 
when  h<~  was  hired  as  the  
women's  coach  at  Notre  
Dame.  

The duty of running both thn men's and women's program became too much for DeCicco, and he looked for a new women's coach, Auriol's suc­cess and renown in Portland made him the natural choice. Many graduates of the Irish fencing program went to Portland to train with Auriol and had only praise for him. 
"He was my first and only choice," DcCicco said. Auriol's d!ldication is what impressed DeCicco the most. 
"Ile is the classic European athlete," he said. "Ile gets out of bed in the morning and he puts his warm-up on. He gives it his all until he gems back to bed again at night." 
Some may attribute Auriol's success to the talent that Im is able to rncruit. Ile has had 34 all-Americans in his 13 sea­sons and 20 in his last three.

Sinrn losing to Pepperdine on Jan. 23. thn Notrn Dame women's tennis tr.am has played like it has something to prove. 
After soundly defeating Kansas Stale and Oklahoma, the No. 16 Irish have an opportunity to build a streak this weekend. They will warm up with Ohio State on Friday and Clemson on Saturday, before facing Duke, the No.· 2 team, on Sundav. 
"We're a very' talented team, and people might underesti­

mate us a bit," said senior Marisa Velasco. "We need to prove to them how good we an,. We want to sot a precr­dent for the rest of the sea­son." 
This weekend marks the first home matches of 1999 for the 3-1 Irish. Playing in front of hostile crowds has taken its toll on the players. 
"We're really looking for­ward to playing in front of the home crowd. especially for the freshmen's sake," said senior team captain Jen Hall. 
Against Duke. Notre Dame will need all the heIp it can get. In the teams' previous six 
meetings, Duke has prevailed everv time. 
Duke brings the threat of Venessa Webb, last season's NCAA singles champion, The odds may seem against the Irish, but players arc not intimidated. 
"We're going to play for broke. \Ve're the underdog and we know it, but that will just make us play harder," said freshman Becky Varnum, owner of a 3-0 singles record.

Auriol did not think that he would achieve success so fast: "You never know. I guess we had a good recruiting year and things just came togeth­er." 
Auriol's coaching magic con­tinued as his squads finished in the top five for seven con­secutive years. It was not until 1993 when the women's team finished sixth that he foll out of the top five. 
The women's team, howev­er, bounced back from the mild setback to go undefeated in 1994 and win Auriol his second national title.
