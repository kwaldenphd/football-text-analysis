Father Heppen 

Director 
discusses 
housing 
Fr. Michael Heppen is the Director of Housing for on­campus students. Last week, he was interviewed by staff repor­ter John Higgins. Q: How over­crowded are the dorms this year? 
A: We're doing pretty well with male housing. We've placed 26 men so far and we have space for 40 more. I wish you would make a strong point that we do have space available for the men. We just haven't been able to get in touch with those on the waiting list. 
We do have an overcrowding problem with the freshman women. Lewis has been taken care of, but we still have people living in the study lounges of Badin, Lyons and 10 in the basement of Walsh. 
Q: U"hy? 
A: It happens because people who don't want their rooms on campus don't bothtr to tell us. We also had 4uite a number of no-shows this year. 
Q: I don't qtufe tmder.rtrmd. 
A: There are alwavs a certain number of students who either don'f want to live in the dor­mitories afttr thev've reserved space or simply d~n't show up. We don't want to have those spaces go unfilled. 

My main concern after we lost St. edward's was acoma­dating those people in a group. This is the reason I put 32 in St. Vincent Hall and I believe 66 in the study lounges of Planner and Grace. I let Fr. Mario Pedi, the rector of St. !<.d's, make all rooming assignments. 
Q: What are the plans for the recomtmction of St. Ed's? 
A: We're still talking with the architects. I've seen some sket­ches, but no final plans have been made. 
Q: How aesthetically accurate wttl the reconstruction be? 
A: It will be a historic res­toration. 
Q: Let's talk about the new dorms. Can you give me some background? 
A: They were given by Frank Pasquerilla. He is an industrial developer from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. I think he has a great deal of respect for the University and a close friend­ship with Fr. Hesburgh, so he decided to provide for their construction. 
Q: When wtll they be ready? 
A: I'm told the first one will be ready inJanuary.

John Anderson campaign workers were try­mg to beat the clock in a state petition drive yesterday. Volunteers were trying to line up at least 6,982 signatures by Monday to get Anderson's running mate, former Wisconsin governor Patrick Lucey, on the ballot in Indiana. Ballots were scheduled to be printedMondayat noon about the same time Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan is scheduled to arrive at Kokomo Municipal Airport. 
The New Miss America, Susan Powell of Oklahoma, described herself as a deeply religious person who has never used drugs, has no boyfriends, and considers premarital sex "not right" for her. The 21-year-old brunette from ~lk City, Okla., meeting with reporters the morning after being crowned the 54th Miss America likened her victory to "a wild black stallion coming offthe plains into the big city." Miss Powell, a senior vocal performance major at Oklahoma City University, defeated 49 pageant rivals partly on the strength of her expressive and amusing renditon of "Lucy's Aria" with a antique telephone. "I feel my greatest asset is my singing ...My voice is a gif't from God," said Miss Powell, who hopes to earn a master's degree in voice and become an opera star. 
Toue:h and ruthless is how former president R'ichard M. Nixon descibes President Carter's aides. Nixon also contends that Republican candidate Ronald Reagan had better"shape up his staff'. Butin the first part of a five part interview to be aired this week on NBC News' Today show, Nixon predicted that Reagan will win the presidential election in November. "Carter's weakness is his record, his deeds," Nixon said. "Reagan's weaknesses are his words; and when you run against words, I think the one that is weak on deeds is going to lose." Nixon also said commented, "You know those Georgia boys are a tough bunch. They may play softball down in Plains, but they play hardball in the country." 
"Taxt"'' was the surprise winner for outstanding comedy series ofthe 1979-1980 television season last nightat the 3ind ~mmy Awards, a strangely glamourless affair because of a performer boycott prompted by the actors' strike. The ABC series about shenanigans in a New York City hack garage scored over the favorite "Mash", as well as "Barney Miller" and "WKRP." The bmmy show got off to a subdued beginning with explanations by last minute emcees Dick Clark and Steve Allen that the show would be lacking star presenters and nominees because of a 50-day-old sympathy strike against film studios and TV networks. 
A six pack of beer and $:l million dollars was the ransom offered for the return ofHandsome Dan who had been held captive for 20 months. Handsome Dan, for those unfamiliar with Yale University history was the first ina long line of bulldog mascots at the university. Prior to his kidnapping, the stuffed remains of Handsome Dan were on display in a 3-by-3-foot glass and bronze case in the Yale Trophy room at Payne Whitney gymnasium. An ad demand­ing the ransom for the stuffed dog's return ran in the school newspaper but the demands were never met and Dan's captivity did not end until last week. 
Prescription drue:s are finding their way into the illegal arug market in l~iana, says State Police Superintendent John T. Shettle, so the state has created a new agency to deal with the problem. The unit, which will be ba~ed in Indianapolis, will crack down on health care pro­fessionals and others who seek to divert legal controlled substances into the illegal drug market, Shettle said. Most of the illegal traffic in legal.controlled substances was·done at the retail level, through forged prescriptions, theft, or illegal transfers by health professionals and their employees, a­ccording to Shettle.

Discovering the 'Real World' 
A great deal oftalking both serious and joking goes on in college about the "Real World" on the outside. especially when a student reaches his/her senior year, a lot of thinking goes on about what the world after graduation will be like. College students spend 9 months of the year in that protected almost sheltered utopia of ideals and lack of major decision-making. However, there are 3 summer monthes which, for most students, must be spent in the "Real World" in order to pay the tuition bills for the next year. Since my sophomore year of high school, I have worked in many summer jobs, but none of them gave me any insight into the "Real World" as my past summer with the Bell Telephone Co. 
When I started my job as a craftsman for the Toll Dept. ofthe phone company, I was asked by everyone what were my future life plans. I re­

lated my dreams of find­
they are to dumb to ing a job where I could notice. "do my own thing" and Few SJ.Vllmer jobs re­live on my own etc. etc., quire you to join a union, all positive and hopeful and even more rarely, do as every college student they involve going on tends to be. I even strike. Several weeks laugtJed when Jack, a into my job I learned professional tollman of that the contract be­many years, said to me tween the International "Woman, you have no Brotherhood of ~lectri­idea what you'll be get­cal Workers (my union) ting into. You live in a and the phone company, very idealistic situation, was coming up for re­but just you wait." 'Just newal, and because of 
Margie Brassil 

These men took pride in thier work, in being able to say they had the largestToll Deptartment in the state, and could run it themselves, when smaller offices needed 9 men to handle the work. As Rick said, pointing to our supervisor, "Why should I give this up to do what that jerk does?" hveryone has heard the principle,"In any­
hierarchy one rises to the level of one's incompetancy." that is nowhere more true than the phone company. I saw bosses, particularly my own, whose sole function was to make sure the work ran smoothly, despite the fact that they rarely knew a thing about the job. They sat in their offices drawing up charts that meant nothing, or pretended to give advice to the craftsmen who knew more than they did. Yet, as a craftsmen you answered to them. Fact of Life #2: you do your job to please yourself, because if you do it to please a su­pervisor, chances are 
you wait,' a prediction that came true as I became a part of the work; nearly took part in a strike; saw fellow craftsmen having to cope with incompetant, unfeeling and unthinking supervisors; and learned what its like to become a part ofthe lives ofmy co-workers, as they became a part of my life. 
My college degree is not in preparation tor craftsmen work. I always wondered howa person could stay at that seemingly low level and never rise higher, unless of course they were in­competent. Bubble burst ~ 1. The three men I worked with were the best in their trade, at the highest pay scale possible as craftsmen in the phone company. To make more money and have a higher position, they would have to be pro­moted to supervisors. Out of curiosity I asked Nick and Rick why they did not go for a promotion-their answer momentarily sur­prised me, they were happy and proud of their job. Throughout the summer I learned why. 

disagreements, all union members were preparing for a strike in August. Luckily, at the last moment we were saved from having to strike, but I learned how important it was to be concerned with the welfare of your coworkers as well as your own. When you work with people every day they become a part ofyour life. You are happy or unhappy with your job, depending on the people you work with. In my case this past summer-and Jack warned me that it was probably a rare case-each person was respected for the job they did, even when they were not experts. The key to gain1ng respect was to show respect in return. ­Well, in nine months the real world awaits. Jack warned me, and then I received a good taste of what it will be like. Quite a number of oubbles burst last summer, and now the only thing I expect will be the unexpected. But, I guess I'm luckier than most, because as I left, Nick, Jack and Rick said to me, "Good luck, but if you find it's not what you like, you just come back here."

Todayin History 
Today's highlight in his­tory: On Sept. 8,1974, President Gerald Ford granted former President Richard Nixon an uncon­ditional pardon for any crimes he may have com­mitted during his term in office. 
On this date: 
In 1565, a Spanrsh ex­pedition landed at what is now St. Augustine, Fla., 
and  founded  a  huropean  
settlement  in  North  
America.  

In 1664, Peter Stuyve­sant surrendered New Am­sterdam to the British. 
In 1855, the Crimean War bnded 
In 1935, Sen. Huey Long was shot in Baton Rouge, La. He died two days later. 
Ten years ago: The Red Cross was named to ne­gotiate with guerrillas holding hostages on board two hijacked airliners in 
Jordan. 
Five years ago: Federal marshals and National Guardsmen in Boston protected students riding buses in a court-ordered integration plan. 
One year ago: Former President Ford assailed President Carter for imply­ing that a Soviet combat unit recently discovered in Cuba may have been there during the Ford admini­stration. 
Today's Birthdays: Com­edian Sid Caesar is 58. Sen. Sam N unn ofGeorgia is 42. Songwriter Howard Dietz is 84. 
Thought for today: There is nothing so power­ful as the truth, and often nothing so strange. ­Daniel Webster (1782 ­1852)

Ray Bueter opeqed the scor­ing fot-the Bearcats by con­verting a penalty kick with ten minutes left in the first half. 
After the rain delay, Irish forward Sami Kahale headed in a crossing feed from Kevin Lovejoy to tie the score five minutes into the second ses­sion. Lovejoy, the senior All­America candidate, scored the game-winner fifteen minutes later as he headed home Mike Sullivan's corner kick. 
"It proved the kind of team we have," said Irish head coach Rich Hunter. "We're a very good team and we don't give up." ­

.. Defense 
[continued from page 8] 
"We've been working a lot on the pass rush this year. The concentration on the team has been much better than last season," he noted. 
The concentration on the part of the defense was obvious from the game's initial mo­ments, as Irish kicker Steve Cichy raced down the field to make a bone-shattering open­ing tackle. The momentum had swung in Notre Dame's direc­tion, and although missing for a short period in the second quar­ter, was quickly regained in the third. 
"The third quarter last year we knew was our worst," said Cichy, "so we were going to come out after halftime and not give up a point in the third quarter and we didn't". 
One year later, the Notre Dame defense has responded to the challenge of erasing last season's 28-22 defeat by Purdue from their minds, and have demonstrated a maturity to be reckoned with by their oppo­nents.

lliwnsBorg 
McEnroe takes U.S. Open 
NEW YORK (AP)-Defend­ing champion John McEnroe picked apart Bjorn Borg's game with slicing serves, hard re­turns and punching volleys and outlasted the brilliant Swede 7-6, 6-1, 6-7, 5·7, 6-4 yesterday to retain his U.S. Open tennis tide. 
Borg's serve, generally reli­able if not overwhelming, de­serted him early in the match. Six times in a row-from late in the ftrst set through the end of the second-Borg was unable to hold his serve. That turned out to be too much of an edge to give to the 21-year-old left­bander from nearby Douglas­ton, N.y. 
Borg was able to fight back and win the third and founh

field really can help the team," said senior Scott Zettek. "When it's boisterous that helps keeps us pumped-up... today's win was especially crowd motivated." 
But, the Irish did suffer a slight let down during the sec­ond quarter, and headed into the lockerroom a half with just a seven point edge. 
"We had memories of last year when we went in at half," said Zettek, a 6-5, 245-pound native of !<.lk Grove Village, Ill. "At half we really got bawled 
out.  Coach  Devine  said  we

Steve Cichy, a junior strong safety from Fargo, N.D., em· phasized that the Irish had no desire to stage a repeat of last year's fatal comeback by Pur­due in the third period. 
"The turning point was when we came out in the second half," said Cichy. "Last year the third quarter was the worst of the game. But when we came out this time we knew we had to get new life."

Courey directs Irish over Boilers, 31·-10 
by Beth Huffman Sports Editor 
Not too long into Saturday's Purdue-Notre Dame classic it became apparent as to why Mike Courey was chosen the number­one Irish quarterback. Simply, Courey directed the offense like it was the most natural thing in the world and led his team to an eventual 31-10 romp over the Boilermakers.
