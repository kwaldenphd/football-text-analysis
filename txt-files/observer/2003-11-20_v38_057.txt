Breast cancer funds surpass expectations 

By KATHERINE GALES 
NcwsWri[er 
The College of Arts and Letters collected $3.441 in October in donations for the Cancer Society of St. Joseph's County. 
The collection significantly sur­passed last year's total of $2,870. This is the third year in which October has been recognized as Breast Cancer Awareness Month. 
The money raised will allow 24 to 25 mammograms for the women of St. Joseph's Country who cannot all'ord the diagnostic treatment. The University's collec­tion mak1~s it the top donor to the society. 
The English Department alone collected $680, nearly tripling their tout! from last year and rais­ing enough to fund four or five mammograms. 
"I saw an ad in People Magazine for 'Jean Day,' [a fundraiser to support breast can­cer awareness]." said Maureen Marnocha, office manager for the Dean of Arts and Letters. "We thought about doing something of our own ... the collection has spi­raled from there, getting bigger and bigger." 
"We leave it up to departments to push the issue," Marnocha said. "It's their decision to put in their area; it seems to work bet­ter." 
The College of Arts and Letters competed to see which depart­ment could raise the most for the cause "to make it more interest-

Africa-focused lecture series ends 
By HELEN ADEOSUN News Writer 

Campus Ministry's four-week series analyzing social justice issues in Africa as advocated by U2's lead singer Bono concluded Wednesday evening. 
The series, "Gospel According to Bono," recognized the need for greater awareness of AIDS and the growing debt facing Africa. It followed on the heals of a visit by Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo in September and is part of a larger conference on Africa that will conclude in February in Nigeria. 
"I think it's time," said Chandra Johnson, assistant to the University president and coordi­nator of the Obasanjo visit and the future Notre Dame student visit to Nigeria. 'There arc voices on campus that understand the significance of Africa, and these voices. from faculty to students, present this to the University so that we're not afraid of dis­cussing Africa, the debt or any of the problems there." 
The four-part "Gospel According to Bono" has contin­ued the focus on the plight of Africa by raising awareness of the issues of debt relief, AIDS and the effects of both on the continent. The last part of the series· held yesterday evening, called "Pray with Africa," fea­tured traditional African prayers. Previous weeks' events included a faith-based interpretation of Bono's music. However, the last two weeks have placed emphasis on the problems facing Africa and Bono's own fund Debt Aids Trade and Africa. 
Becca Saunders and Frank Santoni, leaders of the project, said they intended to tackle issues of faith as well as an event to raise awareness and money for AIDS research and debt can­cellation. 


"We consciously followed on the curtails of the Call to Solidarity With Africa", Saunders said. "It's been on campus lately, and we wanted to follow up on that." 
Both projects have heavily incorporated student involve­ment. The organizers for the Bono series have started a hall competition, with half of the pro­ceeds from the fundraiscr going to the Jubilee Network, an organization for which Bono is spokesperson that works for debt cancellation in Africa. The other half will go to the Holy Cross mis­sions in Africa. 
"The turnout to the events has been 75 to 100 people a week, and during the 'Drop the Debt Coffeehouse' the third week, we raised nearly $200," Saunders said. "People have said it ... has really made a difference". 
Emily Osborne, assistant pro­fessor of history whose resnarch focuses on African studies, said she has also seen a positive stu­dent reaction after the "Call to Solidarity to Af'rica." 
"There is a definite interest in Af'rica. We live in a global world; some of the most serious chal­lenges facing humans is in Africa," Osborn said. 
Osborne also mentioned other sources that teach students about the complexities of the sit­uation in Africa. 
"The African Student Association's principle goal is to highlight Africa as a place of con­cern, and there is a systematic attempt to expose people to African culture," she said. 
Professor Osborne said she wants events such as the "Gospel According to Bono" and the activities of the ASA, such as their concert "By Grace" that will take place at Stepan Center Saturday evening, to highlight

The freedom to DART 
I am writing in response to Thesday's news article "Registration causes con­cerns." 
The article discussed how (due to a large proportion of faculty members taking leave) there are very limited

English electives being_offered next semester. I myself 
Viewpoint

am a recent con­vert to the English major, and yester­day, despite my early DART time, had to deal with the results of these restric­tions. 
While I did get an elective to add to my schedule, I found that many of the department's classes had already been closed. If that many classes had already been filled at such an early time, there obviously are not enough classes being offered. 
It frustrates me that the department has gotten into this predicament. 1\vo of the required classes, which are to be taken before senior year, are being taught in only one section. 
This leaves no options for students regarding time slots or professors, and it forces some younger students to wait to take their requirements. I personal­ly have only four semesters to complete the ten classes needed for the major, and I would much prefer to rest easy knowing that I won't have to struggle to get into the classes I will need to graduate. 
I would also like to be able to choose classes that will excite my passion for English and not get stuck with certain classes because they're the only ones open. 
Yet it's not just the English depart­ment that concerns me. The registra­tion system as a whole seems some­what flawed. 
Certain students with early DART times get a proportionately larger num­ber of the classes they desire than someone who DARTs last. 
In addition, the registrar's office is oftentimes unhelpful. A senior friend of mine was just turned away after asking to be placed in an economics class required for his major. 
This upcoming semester is his last at Notre Dame, and yet he was still told, "tough luck-they're all closed." 
He will most likely have to take a special studies program, for which he'll receive no credit, simply because a slot was not opened for him in the required econ class. 
Each student, I am sure, has had problems with registration -not just with getting classes they want, but with filling requirements as well. 
I don't think that,· as a junior, I should be limited to choosing among five or six electives and that sophomores should be left with no options at all. 
Students should be a top priority at a university of this caliber. and not hiring enough professors in order to compen­sate for those on leave should never be an issue. 
I am asking the University to please try to be more accommodating to the students; we should not feel this frus­trated within majors that we have cho­sen out of a passion for the knowledge we'll gain under their influence.

Also during Wednesday's meeting, Rex Rakow, the director of Notre Dame Security/Police, spoke to Senators on the ways NDSP is looking into changing the security on campus. 
"We're using this year to examine res­idence hall security," Rakow said. "We're looking at what else we need to provide. We will make a recommenda­tion probably by Spring Break as to what we see residence hall security should look like." 
Rakow said the NDSP is specifically looking into the issue of hall monitors in the women's residence halls. 
"Every hall seems to have a different set of requirements for their security guard. We think it should be standard­ized and every student should be afford­ed the same security," stated Rakow.

ping in for me," Chin said. "[Corker] served in the office of the president for three years, and we've been transitioning over the past week." 
Lao said that Hallahan's opinion was important to the selection process. and the final decision was a "meeting of the minds," with Chin agreeing to the change. 
"At first, I was concerned over the fact that we would be transitioning two bodies, rather than bringing in someone new from the outside without a position already," said Chin. "But the office of the president is very organized, and in the end, there were no problems." 
Because she was involved in the formula­tion of Hallahan and Lao's platforms during elections last year, they will continue in the direction of the original campaign, Chin said. This includes the restructuring of the student government, through the addition of the Council of Representatives and other current movements toward that end. 
She added that she would also like to see the Senate take "a more vocal stand on the current issues" and added that she saw "a lot of potential for progress" in the group. 
Lao emphasized student responsibility and campus safety when addressing the main issues for the coming semester. 
"In light of last year's tragedy and the 
CHEESECAKE 

nature of the campus' weekend activities, we need to make sure that the students are, and continue to be, safe," Lao said. 
He also cited the creation of a task force to deal with ticketing concerns, the supple­menting of student activities funding and the restoration of services for students with temporary disabilities as other goals he wants achieved. 
"All of these are important issues. With ticketing, we need to bring together every­one's ideas to come up with a viable solu­tion ... Help for temporarily disabled stu­dents -those with broken legs, etc. -is so necessary, and whether it be through connections with departments or a sepa­rate endowment even, we have to find the means to add to the student activities fund," Lao said. 
To the Senate, Lao expressed his enthusi­asm with the appointment of Chin, and said that he was confident in his ability to work well with her to achieve the year's objectives. 
Chin was also excited about the opportu­nities provided to her and the Senate by her promotion. 
"Because of my history with the Office of the President, my comfort with those peo­ple and my knowledge of that environment, we can have more collaboration between the Senate and the Office of the President in the coming year," Chin said.

On the occasion of International Education Week (November 17-21, 2003), the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures and the Office of International Studies salute our students in languages and literatures, our participants in international study programs, and all of our applicants for international fellowships. 
"We are all students of the world we live in, and today, our world is more interdependent than ever before. The challenges we face in areas such as security, democratic development, economics, and health cannot be addressed by any country acting alone. International education-learning about other cultures and languages through study, living overseas, and interacting with people of other countries-promotes the free exchange of ideas, allows us to seek joint solutions to problems, and helps create lasting partnerships to meet our shared concerns." Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. 
"Since the inception of International Education Week in November 2000, Americans have experienced several world events that should leave us with little doubt that we are living in an interconnected world. The need for understanding other cultures, languages, and global issues has become increasingly more significant. We should do our very best to give our students the skills they need to be successful global citizens." Secretary of Education Rod Paige.

Canada removes SARS scanners 
TOHONTO -Canada is easing SARS screening at its international airports, including a halt in the use of thermal scan­ners to detect people with fever, Health Minister Anne McLellan announced Wednesday. 
The change comes more than live months after the last new case of severe acute respi­ratory syndrome was detected in Canada, where the disease killed 44 people and sick­ened more than 200 others in the Toronto area earlier this year. 
"Hight now, SAHS is nowhere in the world," McLellan said at the opening of a new feder­al emergency operations center in Ottawa. 
She said the fever-detecting scanners could be quickly reinstalled if needed, but acknowledged the machines have limited effectiveness. ' 
Ailing leader worries Egypt 
CAIHO, Egypt -Sneezing and coughing, Egypt's ailing president abruptly left the podium for more than 30 minutes in the mid­dle of a nationally televised speech Wednesday, focusing attention on the ques­tion of succession in an important U.S. ally. 
The 75-year-old Jlosni Mubarak, who has no off1cial successor and is believed to be grooming his son to follow him, was described by aides as having a cold aggra­vated by medication and fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. 
"The president has suffered a health cri­sis," a state television announcer shortly after the broadcast was cut. The words stunned many Egyptians: In Tahrir Square, the main plaza near parliament, traffic halt­ed and car horns went silent as police offi­cers and pedestrians listened silently to radios. 
The opening of Parliament had already been delayed four days because of Mubarak's cold.

Daschle to support energy bill 
WASHINGTON -Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle is ready to support the broad energy bill and will oppose attempts to scuttle it by a filibuster, one of the senator's aides said Wednesday. 
The decision casts doubt on whether oppo­nents can succeed in blocking the bill through a filibuster over a dispute involving the gasoline additive MTBE, which has been found to contaminate drinking water sup­plies. 
A spokesman for Daschle said the South Dakota senator will vote for ending debate on the bill as long as senators are given time to adequately debate the legislation: "There is a lot of legitimate concern about the bill on both sides of the aisle ... [but] he will support it because of ethanol and other provisions in the bill on energy efficiency." 
On Wednesday night, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, H-Tenn., and other Hepublicans set a parliamentary vote for Friday for ending the debate. That would force a final up-or-down decision on the I, 1 00-page bill.

Jason Miller and Lt. Alan Peery were responding to an ambulance call in the lad­der truck about 7 p.m. Tuesday to assist paramedics on the call. 
As Miller drove down a rain-slick county road, one of the truck's wheels, and then truck itself, slid off the narrow shoulder into a ditch. The truck then overturned, hitting a tree and damaging a fence. 
The truck, which the department bought two years ago, is insured.

Bush calls on Europe for support 
Associated Press 
LONDON -President Bush urged Europe on Wednesday to put aside bitter war disagreements with the United States and work to build democracy in Iraq or risk turning the nation over to terrorists. Anti-war demonstrators mobilized for a march of tens of thousands on Thursday. 
Bush conceded in a speech that deep differ­ences remain over Iraq, even among staunch war allies, the United States and Britain. 
But, he asserted, "we did not charge hundreds of miles into the heart of Iraq and pay a bitter cost of casualties and liberate 25 million people only to retreat before a band of thugs and assassins." 
His speech followed an elegant welcoming ceremo­ny with Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, which included a 41-gun salute and a review of troops on foot 'and on horseback. 
Meanwhile, anti-war pro­testers made preparations for huge demonstrations against Bush's 3 1/2-day state visit.

ND to host regional science competition 
By JOHN LOWE 
News Writer 

Eight high school students from the Midwestern United States will present projects in the Siemens regional competi­tion Friday and Saturday at Notre Dame's Eck Center and McKenna Hall for Continuing Education. 
Notre Dame is hosting the event for the fifth year as part of the Westinghouse Science and Technology Competition, an annual scholarship pro­gram for talented high school students from across the United States. 
Paul Helquist, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, participated as a judge to nar­row the field of applicants. 
"Projects are evaluated by judges representing all fields of science, math and technolo­gy," he said. "The job of the judges is to narrow down the field from the original 1,000 to 48 projects." 
Once the 48 projects have been selected, they are distrib­uted geographically into six regions. Over the five-year his­tory of the competition, Notre Dame has hosted students from the Midwest region.

Helquist said that both the application and selection processes have proven inten­sive. 
"Each region has their own independent judges," Helquist said. "The applicants must go through a process of creating posters, reports, oral presen­tations and a detailed ques­tion-and-answer session." 
One individual and one team from each of the six regions advance to the national com­petition in Washington D.C., held at the American Academy for the Advancement of Science. A separate judging process occurs at the national level, after which each team and individual is ranked and prizes are awarded according­ly. 
"The stakes are pretty high at that level -the winning individual receives $100,000 scholarship and then, likewise, the winning team receives $100,000," Helquist said. 
High school students arriving Friday will be escorted around campus by Notre Dame stu­dent hosts and will also partic­ipate in a poster presentation of their research Friday. 
Leon Lederman, Nobel Laureate in Physics, will serve as the event's keynote speaker Friday afternoon. The regional competition will take place on Saturday between 8 a.m. and 1 p.m. 
Helquist said that he is con­sistently amazed at the advanced caliber of each stu­dent's work. 
"All of us judges, by the time we are done with this each year, are really just blown over in terms of [the] extremely high levels these students are working [at]. especially the ones that go on to win. The level at which they have suc­ceeded in their projects is something we might expect [from] a student ... studying for a PhD," he said.

"We sent out [e-mail] mes­sages to all English majors, graduate students and faculty," Baum said. 
Within the English Department, administrative assistant Lynn McCormack com­posed the e-mail messages for recipients. 
"We didn't want people to feel obligated or guilty," she said. "We make them want to give because they feel passion for the cause." 
"Lynn's messages was just that we all have this issue," said Baum. "We asked [the recipi­
. ents] to give generously, and they did. We are taking this par­ticular cause very seriously. Faculty and students poured in." Other areas of the college "do what they want to try to raise funds," said McCormack, point­ing out that "the Arts and Letters Copy Shop held a raffie." 
"We all felt that breast cancer was definitely a concern," Baum said. "The college wanted to support it. ... A general message was sent to administration staff saying that October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month and that the departments were col­lecting donations." 
"Educating us and reminding the staff is what really caused the collection to take off," Baum said. "People started thinking about themselves, their friends and relatives. We look forward to this every October because we know what we're capable of doing." 
"The money stays here [in St. Joseph County]." Marnocha said. "So often, when people donate they don't know where the money ends up. Here, we have people in the college bene­fiting. Everyone is touched by breast cancer." 
"One student gave $50, and another student made a point of giving $2 after the fundraiser was over ... to us, that was as big as the $50 donation," Marnocha said.

Sweden leads world in digital access 
GENEVA -Scandinavia tops the world in access to the Internet and other communica­tions technologies, but South Korea and other Asian countries are catching up fast. the U.N. communications agency said Wednesday. 
Sweden camli. in first in the Digital Access Index, followed by Denmark and Iceland, with Norway in fifth place, said the International Telecommunications Union. 
"Their presence at the top reflects that region's traditional emphasis on equitable access. affinity for technology and top-notch infrastructure." the report said. 
South Korea, world leader in high-speed "broadband" access, came in fourth. South Koreans are heavy users of the Internet for games, chatting and other purposes. 
Filling out the top 10 in order were the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Finland, Taiwan and Canada. The U.S. was 11th. 
Hollywood plans for online movies 
WASHINGTON -Americans could be watching newly released movies via the Internet as soon as mid-2005 as the industry speeds development of a secure delivery sys­tem, Hollywood's chief lobbyist said Wednesday. 
"I really do believe that we will be able to have some -maybe by this time next year ­we'll be able to have the beginnings of some really sturdy, protective clothing to put about these movies," Motion Pictures Association of America chief executive Jack Valenti said in an interview with The Associated Press. 
Valenti said he would like to see movies go straight from the big screen to the Internet, where customers could download or view them on demand well before DVDs and videos reach the store shelves. "We want to use the Internet," he said. 
Valenti said the industry has no current plans to sue pirates like the music recording industry, but he isn't ruling it out because he has seen surveys showing music piracy is being taken more seriously since the lawsuits began early this year.

Smoke-free bars mask cowardice 


Whenever I am back in England, one of my favorite ways to spend an evening is to go to a public house called the Duke of Cumberland. Even by English standards, it is an old pub. People have drunk there since before Peter Wicks the Reformation. They serve excel­lent food and a Englishmangood range of 
Abroad

beers, and one of my favorite pleas­ures is to meet an old friend there and exchange our news over cigars. 
Cigar smoking is a minority pastime and I have found that one of its few disadvantages is that, whenever I smoke in public, a stranger will invari­ably approach me and ask me how old I am. The question is usually asked in such a way as to imply that, at my age, my leisure time should be given over to cannabis, extreme sports and ill-con­sidered sexual encounters; the stogies should wait until I'm in my 50s and CEO of a Fortune 500 company. It's certainly true that most cigar smokers are older men, but in my experience the old are not only wiser than the young, they also have better taste in vices. 
People who have never smoked one often view cigars as a sort of luxury cigarette, but a good cigar is much more than that. As I write this, I have on my desk a particularly fine Davidoff -hecho a mano in the Dominican Republic -which I plan to smoke upon this column's completion. It wouldn't make Castro's collection, but it is a fine cigar. How fine? Well, let's put it this way: It came with a warran­ty. 
Sometimes, Freud said, a cigar is just a cigar. Well, sometimes. But in this particular case, the cigar in question is quite obviously a phallic symbol, like a 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 

Porsche or a totem pole, the later of which it closely resembles in scale. It will take more than an hour to smoke. Should the need arise, it could be used quite effectively in hand-to-hand com­bat. 
I rarely smoke more than twice a month, but since I came to this country three years ago, I have been watching with some dismay the trend toward banning smoking in bars, part of a larger cultural shift in opinion to the point which, as David Brooks has put it, smoking is now considered a worse sin than at least five of the Ten Commandments. Five strikes me as a conservative estimate. To be sure, this hostility is most pronounced amongst members of the upper middle class, but since that is the class that is most influential in forming public opinion, the trend is sure to continue. 
Smoking is one alternative lifestyle toward which Notre Dame is proud to trumpet its opposition. If the University's figures are to be believed, the amount of students who smoke regularly is approximately a quarter of the average for Americans of college age. The rumors of plans to make the University smoke-free in the near future have been denied, but it is note­worthy that the rumors were even plausible. 
Of course smoking is unhealthy. Everyone knows that. Indeed, over the last 20 years the educational establish­ment has largely abandoned the idea of teaching students mathematics or literature, and now sees the primary objective of education as making sure that nobody smokes and everybody uses condoms. 
I'm not against smoke-free bars. Although I smoke occasionally, I appre­ciate the desire to drink and socialize in a smoke-free environment. But I am against legislation which forces bars to be no-smoking zones, which has been introduced in California and, more recently, New York. 
But the question to ask is not why people want smoke-free bars. The question is why -when there are sports bars, singles bars, gay bars, Irish bars and any number of other types of bar-there aren't smoke-free bars already. After all, if there was really a demand for them, market forces would have provided numerous smoke-free bars already. 
Now, some people only have to hear the phrase "market forces" to dismiss the speaker as a free-market ideologue who doubtless spends his days medi­tating on passages from "The Road to Serfdom" and kisses a poster of Ayn Rand before going to sleep each night. But this isn't ideology. The only assumption involved is that bar owners want to make a profit. And if so many people really want to drink without breathing second-hand smoke, then why has nobody opened a bar to cater to them? 
The answer, I think, must be that what many people want is not simply the ability to drink in a smoke-free social space. What they want is the ability to drink in a smoke-free space without taking any personal responsi­bility for the fact that their friends can't smoke. I think that represents a kind of cowardice, and the result of that cowardice is that that all sorts of possible compromises-such as offer­ing a discount on the license fee for bar owners who go smoke-free-are passed over in favor of blanket legisla­tion.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Hidden prejudices? 
While clearly his intention was not to demonstrate the application of social science concepts in the "real" world, Joe Licandro. in his Nov. 19 column. gives us a good example of a couple of social science concepts and dynamics in action. The first is that individuals from devalued communities arc held to standards that are not expected or if expected, not enforced, for indi­viduals from majority communities (see Biernat and Kobrynowicz 1997). 
Licandro claims that, if Gene Hobinson had been het­erosexual and had left his wife for another woman, that it is doubtful that he would have been appointed bishop in the Episcopal Church. Why is it, then, that Barry Valentine-a divorced and remarried hetero­sexual man -was appointed Bishop of Hupert's Land (Winnipeg) in 1969? And today there are at least six active bishops in the Episcopal Church who have been remarried after divorce. 
Concerning Hobinson's divorce, Licandro paints a pic­ture of a man deserting his former wife and children: he "turned the other way" from his family. Why is it, then, that the dissolution of their marriage was done with the full support of his wife and that today they remain good friends? Why .is it that his two daughters are fully behind him in his life and his ministry? Why? Because both he and his wife handled the divorce with maturity, sensitivity and honesty. Their divorce even culminated in worship service where they received Holy Communion. Clearly Licandro is holding Robinson to a different standard and doing his best to put a neg­ative spin on the facts regarding the dissolution of Hobinson 's marriage. 
The second social science lesson is about modern forms of prejudice. Hesearch has shown that as the expression of prejudice has become less socially acceptable, individuals who hold discriminatory atti­tudes have had to develop new rhetoric to support atti­tudes and policies that privilege the group to which they belong over those "other" people (see Crocker, Major and Steele 1998; Fiske 1998; McConahay 1986). Part of this new rhetoric goes something like, "It's not that I'm racist, it's that interracial marriage makes it more difficult on the kids" or "I have nothing against gay people, I just wouldn't want my daughter to be one." 
Well, Licandro wants us to be assured that he doesn't judge Bishop-elect Gene Robinson for being gay (an attempt to establish his moral credentials as an egali­tarian), yet goes on in his article to compare him to 
alleged rapist Kobe Bryant and then invokes the "gay men are selfish and narcissistic" stereotype. And let's 
not even mention that he draws a parallel between Catholic outrage at pedophilic priests and Episcopalian outrage at having Robinson as a bishop. I don't know, 
but I have a hard time believing that Licandro is not judging Robinson's sexuality. 
It is not Robinson's "selfish" behavior that is creating the schism in the Episcopal Church. It is the homopho­bia of many of the leaders and members within the Church, something clearly not unique to Episcopalians. Would Licandro argue that the first woman bishop in the Episcopal church was being "selfish" for accepting her nomination to be bishop or would he, in hindsight these 20 years or so later, report that sexism was the root cause for the major upheaval that occured -an upheaval that included a number of churches breaking away from the Anglican church.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Spears release is in the zone 
By JOHN LOWE 
Scene Music Critic 
Little Britney Spears is all grown up and has left behind her former image as the jailbait teen dream that every­one remembers from the "Baby One More Time" video -it seems she has gone from the Mickey Mouse Club to the strip club. Formerly regarded as the Lolita of pop music, Spears has suddenly metamorphosed into a full­fledged legal sexpot. Her recent release, In the Zone, was created dur-ing an attempted hiatus from the media glare; however, her departure from the music scene caused a media frenzy that even she couldn't have predicted. 

Despite a recent string of controver­sies, including a very public break-up with Justin Timberlake, Spears has come back with a vengeance. Beginning with her highly publicized kiss with Madonna -the "Queen of Controversy" -on the MTV Video Music Awards in August, Spears has been garnering publicity at every turn. She recently posed topless on the cover of Rolling Stone and bottomless on the cover of Esquire, further tarnishing her squeaky-clean image. 
Spears must have used all of these experiences as inspiration for her high­ly sexual and titillating new album, In the Zone, an album that is a definite departure from her previous bub­blegum releases. It is, in fact, more reminiscent of Madonna's controversial album Erotica. Spears' lyrics and tone have shifted from suggestively sexual to blatantly sexual, and the album can be described as her slowly reaching cli­max. 
On track four, "Breathe on Me," she playfully whispers and blows into the microphone and then says, "Just put your lips together and blow." Spears' subject matter definitely carries more adult themes, and she doesn't shy away from taboo topics, even masturbation -the subject of track eight, "Touch of My Hand." The song immediately 

ALBUM REVIEW 
Live Cold play album conveys emotion 
By LIAM FARRELL 
Scene Music Critic 
Typically, live albums are either excellent or terrible. Very few reach a middle ground, as the vast majority walk the margins by being garbled, unintelligible bootlegs, major disap­pointments or marvelous career moments captured within a single com­pilation of live recordings. Even rarer than either of these options are albums that climb into a pantheon of personal achievement, such as It's Too Late To Stop Now by Van Morrison or Bob Dylan's Royal Albert Hall Concert. 
Coldplay's newest release features both a DVD of a concert in Sydney from their latest tour in support of last year's A Rush ofBlood to the Head, and a CD with some of the same recordings on it. There are two new songs on the album, as well as an accompanying tour diary and various other additions

such as lyric links. Cinematically, the concert is brilliantly shot, with swoop­ing camera angles and a variety o( tones and colors to bring to life both the songs and the performers. Although not necessarily breaking any unex­plored territory, there is a definite artistic quality in its composition, and it provides a very beautiful viewing expe­rience. 
When you listen to Coldplay, you lis­ten to a broken heart. The strength of the entire effort comes from the ability of the band's music to create a texture and a complexity that renders every moment relevant and real. "A Rush of Blood to the Head" is a worthy com­panion to U2's "Love is Blindness," a loping affair of despair and potential violence; "Politik," an address of the inhumanity of world affairs; "Yellow," the elation of finding someone in which to put all the trust and love you've been holding onto for years. "The Scientist" continues its reign as the best love bal­lad in years, but the high­
inclusion of

'See You Soon," an early record­ing from The Blue Room 
EP. A gor­g e o u s acoustic track filled out in concert by moaning gui­catches the listener off guard with the candid lyrics, but Spears actual­ly pulls it off successfully. "Me Against the Music" is a song that Spears sings w i t h Madonna, and there is a remixed ver­

sion featured on the album as well. 
In the Zone is full of surprises, espe­cially when considering the caliber of musicians with whom Spears collabo­rate. On track two, Spears features Atlanta rappers The Ying Yang Twins on her song "(I Got That) Boom Boom." After the initial shock of this unusual partnership wears off, the song is actu­ally catchy and definitely has the potential to be released to the radio and the clubs. It is not as good as "Get Low" (another song on which The Ying Yang Twins collaborated), but it is sure to provide sonie good rump-shaking fun. Moby produced a track called "Early Mornin,"' a little ditty about being hungover, and R. Kelly produced an R&B influenced track called "Outrageous." Spears even called on the help of Mr. P Diddy himself to pro-duce a track called "The Answer." Unfortunately, Diddy's track won't appear on the American versions of Britney's album, only those manufac­tured in the U.K. 

There are only two ballads included on In the Zone: "Shadow" and "Everytime." "Everytime" is a blatant apology to Spears' former boyfriend, Mr. Timberlake: "I may have made it rain, please forgive me. My weakness caused you pain, and this song is my sorry." 
This album is mainly for the hard core Britney Spears fans. Some songs still have traces of pop corniness, but overall it is a remarkably inventive, clever and creative record. In a nut­shell, it is just sexy.

tar and slight drum work, it's the tale of lost trust and isolation, a wounded man "in a bulletproof vest with the windows all closed," and it is as uplift­ing as it is tear-inducing. 
The weakness of the compilation comes from its odd track selections, as not all of the tracks from the DVD con­cert are included on the bonus CD. Although this is not the first time in musical history this has happened, it is annoying to be denied five songs when you have a CD player and not a TV. Also, even though the tour diary does illuminate, to some extent, the lives and personalities of the band members, it is not exactly thought-provoking or controversial. Granted, Coldplay's members aren't the reincarnation of The Who, but the effort seems a little too rote and obligatory -more of an assignment than an achievement. 
Unfortunately, Coldplay's newest album of live material does not climb to the top of a live album list. It has ener­gy, it has the songs, it has some incred­ible moments, but maybe it's just a lit­tle too early in their career to release such a work. What the listener gets is an album of promises and expectations, and disappointment at not being able to find tickets or time to get to a show. They certainly make their songs come alive in concert, a difficult feat that many decent bands fail to achieve, as displayed by the many mind-numbing recordings of "Corduroy" on Pearl Jam's excessive number of live albums. Of course, Coldplay are still in career infancy. As listeners, we have to give them time, because one day, they'll blow our minds.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL 

Cannon punt return defines rivalry 
Associated Press 
OXFORD, Miss. -The most famous punt return in Southeastern Conference his­tory started with a fortuitous bounce of the ball. 
With LSU trailing Mississippi 3-0 in the fourth quarter on Halloween night 1959, the ball found Tigers star Billy Cannon on the 11-yard line as much as he found it. Once joined, the two were unstoppable. 
Cannon's tackle -breaking 89-yard punt return won the game for LSU, the Heisman Trophy for himself and became the signature moment in a rivalry that at one point 

.. was as significant as any in the SEC. The LSU-Ole Miss rivalry takes center stage in the SEC again on Saturday, when the third-ranked Tigers face the 15th-ranked Rebels in Oxford with the SEC West title on the line. "It's the first time in a long time that we have both been outstanding football teams," said Cannon, 66, who now lives in St. Francisville, La. Back in Cannon's day, the Tigers and Rebels would regu­larly contend for the SEC title and be ranked among the nation's best squads. Coach Johnny Vaught built Ole Miss into a powerhouse in the 1950s, winning SEC titles in 1954 and '55. The Tigers rose to promi­nence in the late '50s under creative coach Paul Dietzel and won their only national championship in 1958. In 1959, the dapper and meticulous Vaught had what might .have been his best squad. Led by fullback Charlie Flowers, quarterback Jake Gibbs and linebacker Larry Grantham, the Rebels won their first six games by a com­bined 189-7. LSU with a star-studded backfield of Cannon, halfback Johnny Robinson and quarter­back Warren Rabb also won its first six. 
The Tigers were No. 1 and the Rebels were No. 3 when they met at a packed Tiger Stadium on a typically sticky Southern night. 
"I was one of the 150,000 people who was in Tiger Stadium on Halloween night," said Jerry Stovall, who was in the stands as a freshman at LSU and went on to become ,a star tailback for the Tigers. "I have met that many people across the country over these past 34 years, who say 'Man I was there!' The Stadium held 60,000 at that time." 
Midway through the fourth quarter Ole Miss was up 3-0, when Gibbs lined up to punt. 
"When you're looking at the clock, you're saying, 'We got to do something soon. We're run­ning out of clock,'" Cannon said. "I had made up my mind that if I had a chance to field the ball that I was going to return it." 
Cannon was an anomaly for his time -a 215-pound back with sprinter's speed. 
Gibbs had no intention of giving Cannon a chance. 
"I wanted to kick the damn thing out of bounds," Gibbs said. "When the ball hit, it bounced about 10 feet up in the air." 
Former Ole Miss quarter­back Billy Brewer called the play a fluke. 
"He didn't want to field the football. He was trying to get away from the ball. The ball hit and skidded and jumped up into his arms," Brewer said. 
Cannon brushed off that sug­gestion and poked fun at his friend. 
"For him to say something like that, he must be dement­ed," Cannon deadpanned. 
Though even Cannon admits, "It wasn't that great a kick and I did get an excellent bounce." 
Cannon cut and crashed through the Rebels, putting his hand on the ground at one point to keep his balance. 
Then he broke free, picked up blockers and had only Gibbs to beat. 

Coaches retnetnber 100-year rivalry 
Associated Press 

ANN ARBOR, Mich. -Bo Schembechler swivels in his chair to the right and smiles at a picture of him and Woody Hayes, then chuckles as he points at their bobblehead dolls on his desk. 
"I love that guy," Schembechler says. 
Woody and Bo. 
Bo and Woody. 

The teams they coached ­Ohio State and Michigan ­meet for the 100th time on Saturday, and the 10 games featuring Hayes and Schembechler are the highlight of the series. 
The Buckeyes or Wolverines were in the Rose Bowl each year the mentor and student dueled for a win in one of col­lege football's greatest rivalries from 1969-78. Hayes went 4-5­1 against the coach who played for him at Miami of Ohio. 
Seven times, both teams were in the Top 10 for what can sim­ply be referred to as "The Game." 
The Wolverines snapped Ohio State's 22-game winning streak in 1969 and ended the top­ranked Buckeyes' hopes of a second consecutive national championship. The Buckeyes gave Michigan its only loss in 1970, 1972 and 1974. A tie in 1973 spoiled both teams' per­fect seasons, leaving them 10­0-1 with Ohio State going to the Rose Bowl. 
Before and after Hayes and Schembechler led the two sto­ried programs, Big Ten titles and Rose Bowl berths often have been at stake. But those coaches added extra drama. 
"It was a very personal rival­ry," says former Ohio State coach Earle Bruce, who played for Hayes, coached for him and succeeded him. "And for the first and only tim~. it was as much about the coaches as it was about the game. 
"Bo and Woody were very close because Bo played for Woody at Miami of Ohio, then coached with him at Ohio State. But their friendship was put on hold when Bo took the Michigan job because it was the protege against mentor." 

Schembechler leans forward and in his familiar gravelly voice says: "It doesn't get any better than that, does it?" 
For Jim Mandich, it didn't. 
Mandich experienced the most-humiliating moment of his career -and the best -at Michigan in 1968 and 1969. 
Ohio State beat the Wolverines 50-14 in 1968. When Hayes was asked why he went for a 2-point conversion late in the game, he said: "Because I couldn't go for 3." 
Schembechler then took over at Michigan and shocked No. 1 Ohio State 24-12 in his first meeting. 
"Going for 2 points in '68 may have been the best thing Woody ever did for us and the Schembechler era," Mandich says. "It infuriated us and was a huge spark for Bo's new pro­gram." ' 
Mandich says beating the Buckeyes in 1969 was "the most thrilling experience of my life," even though he went on to win three Super Bowls, includ­ing one with the 1972 Miami Dolphins, still the only unde­feated team in NFL history. 
"It's not even close," Mandich says. "It was the signature event of my life." 
Many fans can probably close their eyes and see Woody and Bo stalk the sidelines. 
Hayes with a scarlet red "0" on a black baseball hat in a white, short-sleeved button­down shirt and tie. Schembechler sporting a maize block "M" on his blue ballcap. 
"They acted exactly alike," says John Hicks, who played at Ohio State from 1970-73. "They both grumbled, complained and cussed all game. And, every­body loved one or hated the other in Ohio and Michigan." 
Hayes' successful career ended in an infamous way after Clemson beat Ohio State in the 1978 Gator Bowl. 
After Clemson's Charlie Bauman intercepted a pass and was run out of bounds along the Buckeyes' sideline with 
1:59 to play, Hayes grabbed him around the collar and threw a punch. Hayes was restrained and Bauman was pulled away.

Trip to Rome 
Tears of Joy in the Eternal City 
by Fr. Kevin Russeau, c.s.c Director, Freshman Retreat Program 
Just over a week ago I was privileged to spend a week with 26 Notre Dame Alumni travel­ing to Rome. Each year our Alumni Association plans trips and cruises for our graduates and sends them all over the world. For each trip, the Alumni Association tries to find a willing chaplain to make the sacraments more readily available to the alumni and to give them again a memento of their faith life while they were still students. While I did have to miss two home football games, I was honored (and I think lucky) to be asked to chaplain for our alumni in Rome. 
Rome is a city of beautiful churches. Even the small churches that are forgotten on nearly every city map are filled with beautiful pieces of art, chapels of various famous saints, and usually a resting place for a pope or two! Simply wandering around the meandering Roman roads can be a religious experience of its own. 
Daily excursions took us to cities such as Pompei, Florence, and Orvieto. Sometimes they kept us in the city to see Ancient Rome, the Vatican Museums, and the Sistine Chapel. Each of these excursions included the expertise of a local tour guide and many of them also featured a fantastic lunch. 
In the midst of these busy days of touring, we found time to celebrate Mass with one another. On Wednesday our group had tickets to see Pope John Paul II at his weekly audience. Because the weather was still warm and there were many pilgrims in Rome, the audience was held outdoors in St. Peter's square for nearly 100,000. Perhaps our tailgating instincts directed us to depart early from our hotel to St. Peter's, but since it was first-come first-seated in the square, each of us got front row seats to greet our pontiff and listen to his address. 
Our Pope seems to never run out of surprises. I could not get over just how close our seats were to the pope-it was amazing-but even more amazing was the reaction from the alumni. These alumni who have seen so much in their lives, have taken many different trips around the world, have accomplished financial stability, and who are now enjoying the fruits of their labor -these alumni were deeply moved by the words of the pope and by his simple actions and greetings that morning. Tears filled many ofour eyes and comments like "Fr. Kevin, this was a real highlight not only for this trip but for my life" were common. Rome, and more properly 
-' 

the Vatican, has a way of really impacting people's lives! 
This coming spring break, Campus Ministry is helping to sponsor a Pilgrimage to Rome to offer students an opportunity to experience the Eternal City. St. Peter's Basilica and Square will be a featured place of prayer, but we will visit each of the major Basilicas as well as many Roman Churches. We will see the old coliseum where Christians knew pain and persecution and then visit the catacombs where the same Christians found Final Peace and the early Christian Church worshiped in hiding. We will have an opportunity to pray with and meet the general administration of the Congregation of Holy Cross, whose headquarters is in Rome. We will travel to Assisi to spend time in the city where Francis and Clare left a lasting mark of peace. Finally, if our Pope is still feeling well enough, we will see the Pope on Sunday as he leads the Church in the Angelus! 
If you have any questions about this pilgrimage, would like a rough itinerary, or would like to sign up please contact Fr. Kevin Russeau, esc or Sr. Sue Dunn, op ASAP. A deposit of $100 is due next week (Friday November 28'h) by 4:00pm-and space is limited. 
For hundreds of years Christians have been making pilgrimages to Rome. Whether this would mark your first or tenth pilgrimage, you will find inspiration and renewal. Join us.

Of all the records kept in col­lege football, oldest player isn't recorded by the NCAA or the NAIA. Williams thinks he and his son may certainly be the old­est ever to play together, which he has submitted to the Guinness World Book of Records.

out him," Williams said of his son. "He'd tell me things like. 'Dad, everybody's hurting,' and I'd say, 'Kyle, is everyone hurt­ing as bad as me?' I don't know if he's lying, but he said yes." 
Williams thought his chance to play college ball ended in 1976 when he was a high school sen­ior and tore every ligament in his left knee. Instead, he got an associate's degree in engineer­ing, married his high school 
sweetheart and had four chil­dren. 
Then eldest son Kyle startnd playing football -first at the same middle school his father had attended, then at the same high school. Once at Lambuth, Williams couldn't stop watching his son practice. 
He posted his goal on the refrigerator-Aug. 6, 2003, the first day of practice -and asked Kyle for permission to try out for the team, even though his son didn't take him seriously at first. 
First, Joey cut back from a whole box of cookies to a half box at a sitting and started tak­ing walks around the block. Within three months, he was walking and running, eventually doing up to six miles a day and an occasional aerobics class. 
He finally called Lambuth coach Vic Wallace. whose lirst thought was that Williams had an idea to raise money for the booster club . 
"I said 'Go for it.' I looked at it as being something that's really neat, an opportunity for a father to participate on the same team as his son and vice versa," Wallace said.

(26: 16.7) and freshman Katie White (26:48.0) took 146th and 170th place, respectively. Behind them were freshman Erin Nolan (182th place; 27:09.5), senior Jessica Kosco (193rd place; 27:25. 9), sopho­more Becky Feauto (198th; 
27:46.9) and senior captain Jackie Bauters (206th; 28:26.4). 
Bauters did not have her best race at the conference champi­onships, either. The senior cap­tain developed a respiratory infection prior to the race but still competed at both the MIAA meet and the regional. 
"Jackie led this team to a great season and had a great career," Barstis said. 
Senior leadership was impor­tant in a pivotal season for the Belles, but recruiting and the performance of the freshmen have played equally important roles. 
"This is the most talented first-year class in the history of the program," Barstis said. "Another [class] like this one, and there will be no limit to how far they can go." 
White, one of the top new­comers, had trouble breathing at the regionals due to asthma. 
She regained herself, however, and had what Barstis described as "perhaps her best race of the year." The compliment means more alongside this sta­tistic -White finished in the top three Belles runners in every race but one this season. 
Joining White is a group of freshmen poised to help the team continue in its transition -if everything goes as planned -to being a perennial contender in the MIAA. 
"Sara Otto, Katie White and Erin Nolan have just started what should be very productive careers," Barstis said, going down the list of solid first­years. "The two regional team alternates, Ashley Oberst and Meaghan Herbst, are also first-year runners who will be

Hoops 
continued from page 20 
"With Torrian, he did a hell of a job slashing to the rim, dunking on people and the biggest thing was those two free throws," guard Chris Thomas said. "We always knew he had that kind of identity about himself. He had great aura, great leadership." 
Being named one of four cap­tains for the Irish this year, Jones had a chance in the exhibition season to display that leadership. The Irish needed two free throws against the Illinois All-Stars with 
1.4 seconds remaining to avoid an exhibition loss. 
Jones was just a 67.2 percent shooter from the charity strip last year. While he doesn't want to discard what made him a shutdown defensive player in his first three years with the Irish, he's ready to undertake new roles this year. 
''I'm the energy guy. That's my role since I was a freshman. Even though I'm looking to be more of a scorer this year, I'm still trying to fmd ways to bring energy offensively," Jones said. "I try to get big rebounds, big defensive stops, blocks, anything I can do to get this team getting some momentum in the right direction. 
"I think [Friday night] I was able to do that in the second half with a couple of drives to the basket to the lane and making those big free throws at the end." 
Cornette took on a new role in the first half, keeping the Irish in the game on 4-of-5 shooting on 3-pointers, including scoring nine straight points for the Irish at one point. 
In his first game this season, Cornette was ready to show off his offensive game -something many are looking. for the junior to do in 2003-04. 
"I think people have been in my ear about asserting myself offensively. The capabilities I know I have, I just have to be able to show them out on the court as much," Cornette said. "[Friday night]. and as the sea­son goes on, I think I'm going to have more opportunities to pres­ent myself offensively and just show everybody what I am capa­ble of doing. I'm confident I can do that."

shooting Friday night going 4~of­4 from behind the arc. With Brey planning on using Thomas and Quinn on the court at the same time a lot this season, Quinn will see a lot of minutes this year along with Cornette and Jones. 
Those increased minutes force Brey to expect his former role­players to become scorers. Against the Illinois All-Stars, those three got their first chance to step it up offensively. Brey was pleased with how they reacted. 
"To have them do it in this situ­ation where you could have lost the game, just helps you," Brey said. "[Torrian] is a senior, but to make two free throws like that, that's going to help. Chris Quinn having to make plays at the end. Jordan having to make some big shots at times, especially in the first half, those were all key things. 
"I like the fact that the new guys have had a lot of experience in their new roles before we tee it up for real [against Northern Illinois]."

ARIES (March 21-Apri119): Your outgoing nature, coupled with your sense of humor, will attract passionate partners. You can develop your creative talents if you enroll in classes. **** TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Don't limit yourself by being stubborn.

Belles happy about finish at Regionals 
By PAT LEONARD 

Sports Writer 
After turning in an improved performance at the MIAA championships by finishing sixth at Albion College, the Saint Mary's cross country team closed its season Saturday with a 30th place fin­ish at the NCAA Division III Regional Meet at Hanover College. 
Saint Mary's scored 775 points and finished 30th out of 34 scoring teams. Mount Union College won first place with 113 points, while Jessie Lair of Calvin College claimed the overall individual champi­onship with a time of 22:13.2. 
The Belles treated the regional meet as a cool down to its biggest race of the year at the MIAA's. 
"There were no expectations for the regional meet," Saint Mary's coach Dave Barstis said. "Our goal was to com­pete well at the conference championship meet, and everyone ran their best race of the season there. The regional meet was just a bonus." 
Saint Mary's sent a limited number of runners to the regional meet, a 6,000-meter race that was longer than the usual l 5,000-meter race the Belles had grown accustomed to running throughout the sea­son. 
Barstis said the course length was not a factor. 
"The distance did not have any effect," he said. "Our training allowed us to compete at both distances. If you ask the [girls], they'll probably tell you they didn't even notice a difference." 
Freshman Sara Otto led the Belles at Hanover College with an 84th place finish and a time of 25:09.1.

They're fighting on their own 
now, so the boys better watch 
out. 
For the first time in Notre 
Dame boxing history, the 
women's training is completely 
separate from the men's and will 
box in exhibition matches for 
their own charity tonight at 7. 
"This is our first year when 
we're having our own night of 
bouts without the men's pro­
gram," co-president Sara Helmig 
said. 
Unlike last season, when the 

men and women trained togeth­er and the men then fought in the Bengal Bouts tournament, while the women simply had exhibition matches, the women will have their own individual bouts and these bouts scored. The club has between 80-100 ·people working out at various times throughout the training period and some practice five to 
six days a week. 
For Thursday, there are 38 
women fighting in 19 bouts, with each fighter participating in one match. 
"This is a transition year so we're moving toward more of a tournament format," Helmig said. "This isn't a varsity sport but at the same time you have to practice a lot to sharpen your skills." 
Helmig said that the bouts will be scored this year, unlike last year's bouts, and there are no weight classes. The fighters will be paired by skill and height. 
The women's club has been around for eight years, but never has been separated from the men's. Helmig said the main rea­son the women chose to have their own Bengal Bouts was because of limited practice space during training and not enough coaches to help out. 
"We shared coaches with the men's program and the past two years there's been quite an over­flow in terms of practices and being in each others way," Helmig said. "It's no one's fault because we share the boxing room and it's the only place we

Irish role players need to step up 
ByMATTLOZAR 
Assistant Sports Editor 

Losing two scorers like Matt Carroll and Dan Miller left the Irish looking to replace 33.4 points each night they step on the court. 
Naturally, Irish coach Mike Brey is looking to his role players from last year -namely Jordan Cornette, Torrian Jones and Chris Quinn -to become bigger scorers this year. Last season, that trio averaged a combined 
11.8 points per game. 

That's a major jump for those three players to make, but if the Irish are to continue to score a lot of points, that jump is neces­sary, and they are ready. 
"Over the years, I've kind of played hesitant on the offensive end," Jones said. "I think this year, with Coach Brey really encouraging me and letting me know that he has confidence in me on the court, that's helping me go out on the court and play free of mind." 
Friday night against the Illinois All-Stars, Jones did just that. In the second half, when the Irish bucket. had cooled down from their tor­Using his athletic ability, which rid first half 3-point shooting, has been so present on the Jones took advantage of his slow­defensive end, is something his er defender and made a number teammates were glad to see. of moves to the basket.
