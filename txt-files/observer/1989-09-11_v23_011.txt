WORLD BRIEFS 

Mother Teresa's condition improved Sunday after the Nobel laureate received a pacemaker to steady her heartbeat and heavy doses of antibiotics to fight a fever, doctors said. A state­ment issued by Woodlands Nursing Home in Calcutta. India said the 79-year-old Homan Catholic nun known for her work with the poor was "bright and cheerful, had eaten with a good appetite and had a comfortable sleep (Sunday) afternoon." 
The parliament of Iran on Sunday condemned nearly 190 U.S. congressmen in Nicosia, Cyprus for endorsing Iranian resistance groups and declared their moves will unleash unspeci­fied "consequences." Official Tehran radio quoted Parliament Speaker Mahdi Karrubi as saying that "U.S. leaders will take the wish of overthrowing the Islamic Hepublic to their graves."The 
U.S. lawmakers requested that the United States support Iranian resistance groups. 
Aviation authorities Sunday prepared an underwa­ter salvage operation to hoist a Norwegian charter plane that crashed off Denmark's west coast, killing all 55 people aboard. Experts said metal fatigue in the aging aircraft was a likely cause of the Scandinavia's worst air disaster. The twin-engine Convair turboprop plane was en route from Oslo, Norway, to Hamburg, West Germany when it plunged into the North Sea 18 miles from the Danish fishing port of Hirtshals on friday. Most passengers were Norwegian employees of a shipping line who had won a company lottery to attend a ship christening in West Germany. 
The Kremlin's ambassador to Italy said Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev will meet with Pope John Paul II when he visits Italy in November. "Yes, why not," replied Ambassador Nikolai Lunkov when reporters in Genoa asked him Saturday if Gorbachev would meet the pope. Such a meeting has been considered likely but neither the Vatican nor the Kremlin has confirmed it would take place. It would be the first meeting be­tween the leader of the world's 850 million Roman Catholics and the head of the Soviet Communist Party, which is officially atheis­tic. 
NATIONAL BRIEFS 

Retail gasoline prices dropped 1.37 cents nationwide over the past two weeks but wholesale prices rose slightly, signal­ing a possible pump price increase this fall, an industry analyst from Los Angeles said Sunday. The average retail price for all gasoline grades at full-and self-service pumps was 109.07 cents per gallon for the Aug. 25-Sept. 9 period, said Trilby Lundberg, director of the Lundberg Survey of 12,000 gasoline stations. Wholesale prices rose by .33 cents as wholesalers' inventories, stockpiled after spring's Valdez oil spill, returned closer to nor­mal levels, Ms. Lundberg said. 
Instead of using poison to rid their homes of mice, Hennepin County residents of Minneapolis are being asked to call in the killer potatoes. That's right. Put out a bowl of mashed potato powder near a dish of water, and it's supposed to bloat the varmints to death. That's just one of the chemical-free suggestions the county has in a four-page, trash-can-shaped brochurn it began giving out last week at its household hazardous wastn collnction sites, set up to encourage people not to put their leftovnr household chemicals and such in the trash. 
Hurricane Gabrielle far out in the Atlantic whipped up huge waves this weekend, sweeping beachgoers out to sea and capsizing boats from Maine to New York.At least six people were reported missing and one apparently drowned in mishaps the Coast Guard said were related to the sea swells, undertow and waves that have reached 15 feet in height, even on rivers.By Sunday evening, Gabrielle's wind had weakened to 75 mph and it was sitting 600 miles east of New Jersey. 
INDIANA BRIEFS 

Two emergency jet landings, one on a flight from Indianapolis, landed Sunday at Port Columbus International Airport in Columbus Ohio, a Federal Aviation Administration su­pervisor said Both planes landed safely and no injuries were reported, said Ron Bradley, tower supervisor at Port Columbus. The cause of each incident had not been determined, he said.

Objectivity is needed in making religious decisions 
As infants we are baptized. As children we 
receive our first communion. As young adult~ 
we are confirmed in our faith. As adults we 
are married or ordained. When we are elderly 
or infirm we receive last rites. These 
practices and similar ones belonging to 
different faiths have been going on for 
centuries in our world. It is assumed within 
the context of a Christian upbringing that the 
aforementioned sacraments will occur in the 
course of one's life. 

However, the right of an individual to make 
a choice on whether or not they want these 
events to occur is not wholly taken into 
account. That is, until said person is 
sufficiently old or mature enough to enforce 
one's own will upon one's environment. With 
birth within a Christian household, a child is 
immediately indoctrinated with the beliefs of 
its parents. While the parents do carry the 
burden of raising the child and do deserve the 
right to make decisions for their progeny, 
would it not be better if human beings were 
allowed to grow and mature with an objective 
and unbiased opinion with regards to religion. 
The benefit of such an upbringing would be that it would allow an individual to peer upon the theological environment and develop one's own reasons and opinions with regards to one's faith. Western theological tradition holds that one of the greatest gifts God has given us is the freedom to choose our own course. Why then does organized religion not allow the same freedom? Further, why do differing religious entiti'es claim to hold ex­clusively the map that leads to a divine destination. One method, one path is prescribed for reaching a specific spiritual location. The concept of an alternative route or destination is strictly forbidden. The idea is that one cannot make one's own way in life and must depend upon some external power, 
i.e. the church or religious group, for guidance. The result of such a claim is to remove the necessity of making a conscious rational decision, one not based upon predetermined biases, to follow such a path. 
The selection of a theological viewpomt IS probably the most important decision one will make in life. By indoctrinating the young with only one view, two things are accomplished. The first is that it eliminates objectivity in decision making. The individual is predisposed one way or another regarding the religion with which he or she was educated in. Second and perhaps more importantly, it releases the individual from the responsibility

of making their own personal selection. It is 
the selection of religion by default. 
What would happen if a mystical presence 
made itself known to all of us on an individual 
basis with the intent of annulling all of our 
preconceived notions on religion? This 
theoretical inquisitor would challenge us on 
our beliefs and on the basis we have for 
holding on to them. Questions regarding 
when one began to believe in a particular 
doctrine and based on what reasons such 
beliefs were chosen would be put to us all. 
The only answers that would not be accepted 
as being valid by this presence would be ones 
including the phrase "I was brought up to be­
lieve this." How would we as individuals 
respond? 
Having had these decisions made for us in the past, how would we go about considering such a choice? We would have to develop our own criteria for evaluating differing philosophies of life and make a choice based upon this criteria. Theoretically, no one would be standing there telling us what to do. We would have to think for ourselves. For those followers out there looking for the right answer, be forewarned that there is no definitive answer. It is in asking the questions and coming up with a response that is of a "higher" value. This is a process that should not stop with one decision. Periodic analysis of our basis of belief is one characteristic of intelligent decision making. 
Lastly, why would one want to do this? Making a rational, informed, and unbiased choice in regards to personal beliefs is what gives validity to one's belief. It is not the only characteristic, but it is an important element. By preventing an individual from doing thi~. we are in a sense robbing them of the opportunity for true faith. We are inhibiting their ability to think rationally. 
But why would anybody want to do that?

Major landscaping improvements planned for Mod Quad 
BY SARAH VOIGT 
Senior Staff Reporter 
The beautification of the East Quad, begun on July 24 and slated to be completed October 31, is the first phase in a plan to upgrade and enhance the landscaping on the Notre Dame campus. The East Quad, formerly known as the Mod Quad, includes the area be­tween the Pasquerillas, and Grace and Planner Towers. 
David Woods, director of support services at Notre Dame, said that the Maintenance Center began to investigate the possibility of a master landscape plan for campus one year ago. 
Woods said that a study conducted last winter by Cole A!isociates, Inc., a South Bend architectural firm that designed the landscaping between Siegfried and Knott, targeted the East Quad as the best place to begin the renovations. 
Woods explained, "The newly finished landscaping between the new dorms made the Pasquerilla's 12 to 20 year old landscaping look old in con­trast. Also, some say that it !the East Quad] has been a ne­glected area of campus. Plus, roughly 25 percent of the stu­dent bo.?y live in the East Quad dorms. 
According to Woods, two student hubs with six to eight benches will be placed at the in­tersections of the major walk­ways to encourage students to relax and congregate in the quad. The benches will be built on a raised mound of earth surrounded by new plantings of The Observer I Laura Stanton flowers and shrubs and a wheelchair ramp for handicap The new pit will include a model for the future develop­ranged in a a circle on brick traffic patterns.

Kinko's sued by book publishers 

BY SANDRA WIEGAND 
News Staff 
A lawsuit against Kinko's Graphic Corporation by eight textbook publishers is still pending. 
Kinko's makes multiple copies of copyrighted materials for classroom use, providing updates on recent discoveries in various fields. The textbook publishers claim that Kinko's has violated the 1976 Copyright Act. 
Section 107 of the copyright law states, " ... the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies ... for purposes such as criticism, comment, newsre­porting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use). scholarship or research is not an infringement of copyright." 
A recent press release from Kinko's states that the company has ten full-time co-workers at its national copyright center who contact publishers to obtain permission to copy their materials. According to the press release, they process over 10,000 permission re­quests a month, and give compensation if it is requested by the copyright holder. 

Scott Tagliarino, a public relations representative for Kinko, said that neither verbal nor written permission is actually necessary under the present law. 
Tagliarino said that Kinko will not settle out of court because, "they fully believe they are right." He said that the lawsuit has had no effect on business, and has not prompted any change in Kinko's policies. 
The case against Kinko will go to court in about a year. 
Strike leader, students murdered in Guatemala 
Associated Press 
GUATEMALA CITY -The bodies of a university professor who led a teachers' strike and three kidnapped students were found Sunday in a canyon near San Carlos University, police reported. 
They said an anonymous tele­phone caller told authorities where the bodies could be found. Notes attached to the bodies referred to the destruc­tion of the leadership of the student organization to which the victims belonged. 
The victims, all of whom had been kidnapped within the past three weeks, were identified as professor Carlos Humberto Cabrera Rivera, 48, who was abducted Saturday; Carlos Chuta Carney, a 35-year-old law student kidnapped Friday, and Victor Rodriguez Jaramilla, 38, a political science student, and his wife, 33-year-old psychology student Silvia Maria Azurdia de Rodriguez, abducted Aug. 23. 
Police said all had been shot repeatedly. 
No individual or group has asserted responsibility for the kidnappings and slayings, and police said they have no sus­pects.

South Africans protest violence during elections; 29 reported dead 
Associated Press 

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -Mourners on Sunday buried victims of election vio­lence near Cape Town, and ac­tivists prepared a mass march to protest alleged police shoot­ings and reported deaths of 29 civilians. 
Hegional Police Commissioner Phillipus Fourie was quoted Sunday as saying he will lead his officers to stop the march planned for Sept. 17. and an anti-apartheid clergyman said he expects police will use vio­lence to disperse demonstra­tors. 
"It will be solid evidence of what they have done on (election) night. Because if they would do this in the light of day . . . then God knows how they behave in the dead of night in our townships when there is nobody to protect our people," said Hev. Allan Boesak, leader of the World Alliance of Heformed Churches. 
Evette Otto, a teen-ager who 
was five months pregnant when 
she was killed Wednesday in 
Kalksteenfontein township, was 
buried Sunday in her home 
town of West Riebeeck, 180 
miles northwest of Cape Town. 
Her mother told a news confer­
ence Friday that Evette, 16, 
was standing on the street 
talking to friends when a uni­
formed officer shot her 
through the chest. 

Funerals of those killed in the 
violence, which began during 
general elections Wednesday, 
are scheduled throughout the 
week. Activists have asked the 
nation to wear black armbands 
and light candles for an hour a 
night. 

Marchers want to protest the deaths of 29 people activists say were killed in election vio­lence, most by police. Activists said 200 people were hurt when white riot squad officers marched through townships, shooting and whipping by­
standers as well as stone­throwers. Those throwing stones were protesting the elec­tions, which exclude South 
Africa's 28 million black major­
ity. 

Police say only 15 people were 
killed and have not acknowl­
edged responsibility for any 
deaths. 

Cape Town doctors on Friday reported treating children as young as 4 years old for gun­shot wounds. Attorney General Essa Moosa on Friday said 29 people were killed, including a 12-year-old boy. An ambu­lanceman has reported taking the body of a 6-year-old girl to a mortuary. 
Police have reported using pistol fire, birdshot, buckshot, rubber bullets and tear gas. They reported a handful of in­juries, none of them children. 
Boesak said the issue of the killings unfortunately has turned into "a numbers game" since Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok called Boesak and Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu liars for their death toll reports. The clergymen have called for Vlok to be fired.

Republican charges CIA with botching Afghanistan 
Associated Press 

"The CIA has secretly pursued a wrongheaded Afghan policy for years," the chairman of the Republican Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, Hep. Bill McCollum of Florida, charged in a 2,600­word article in the editorial section of the Washington Post. 
The most recent blunder, he wrote, was to shut off the sup­ply of U.S. arms while pressur­ing Afghan guerrillas into launchiqg an assault on the Afghan city of Jalalabad near the Pakistani border. 
At the same time, the Soviet Union continued massive arms supplies to its client in Kabul, enabling that government to withstand the assault. 
The siege of Jalalabad has 
turned into a stalemate that 
threatens to stall the entire re­
sistance movement. 

The key mistake by the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department was to give control U.S. arms ship­ments to the guerrillas to Pakistan's Inter-Service Intelligence, that nation's equivalent of the CIA, McCollum wrote. 
"Why the CIA gave lSI its proxy was easier to understand in the beginning," as the United States began to arm the Moslem guerrillas, or muja­hedeen, after the 1979 Soviet invasion, McCollum wrote. 
"Our intelligence community had little faith in the muja­hedeen's ability to drive out the Soviets; for a relatively small sum we could blacken Moscow's eye and get our own

back for Vietnam," he wrote. 
But the policy allowed gener­als around the late Pakistani strongman, Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, to bolster an Islamic fun­damentalist whom McCollum compared to Libyan Leader Moammar Gadhafi. The policy slighted tribal leaders who had greater support in Afghanistan. 
In 1976, lSI recruited 
Gulbadin Hekmatyar, who was then a "firebrand fundamental­ist student leader at Kabul University" and who now heads Hezb-i-Islami, one of seven Afghan resistance parties based in Peshawar, Pakistan, the congressman wrote. 
Hekmatyar was censured by the leaders of the six other par­ties this summer after guerril­
las under his control ambushed and killed 32 lieutenants of the leading Afghan resistance fighter, Ahmed Shah Massoud, who belongs to another party. The siege of Jalalabad has resulted in a stalemate, in large part because CIA "tacticians 
were so certain they were right that they turned off the arms supply.

Colombia to extradite three men to U.S. 
Associated Press 
BOGOTA, Colombia -The Colombian government will ex­tradite three more reputed co­caine traffickers wanted in the United States on charges of money-laundering and dr'ug smuggling, an official said Sunday. 
The announcement came after a weekend of army raids on ranches believed owned by the country's top two drug barons. Soldiers seized prop­erty including cattle, tropical birds and swimming pools, the army and the El Espectador daily said. 
In Medellin, .the nation's sec­ond-largest city, a series of at­ta,cks linked to drug cartels continued. A bomb damaged a liquor factory, hooded as­sailants set a city garbage truck on fire, and police de­fused a bomb at a branch of a government-run savings bank. No injuries were reported. 
In western Colombia, as­sailants killed a foreman and set fire to the ranch of a gov­ernment official who wanted the confiscated rural property of drug traffickers distributed to peasants. 
A National Drug Council offi­cial, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press the government has signed extradition orders for three imprisoned Colombians. 
The three were identified as Ana Helena Rodriguez, 37, jailed in Bogota and accused of drug trafficking; Bernardo Londono Quintana, 47, jailed in Bogota for allegedly laundering money; and Alberto Orlandez Gamboa, 37, jailed in Medellin, also for alleged laundering. 
It was not known if the three were notified. Once notified, they have five days to appeal the extradition order.

appeal.An army officer in Medellin, asking not to be identified for 
security reasons, said the prop­erties seized over the weekend are believed to belong to two of 
the most wanted drug bosses: Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha. They are be­lieved to be the No. 1 and No. 2 men in the Medellin cocaine cartel.

With trend, mutual funds will expand to $1 trillion industry 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK --If things-keep going the way they have been lately, the nation's mutual funds will soon become a $1 trillion industry. 

The latest data from the In­vestment Company Institute, the funds' biggest trade group, show total assets of $936.60 billion at the end of July, up from $900.25 billion a month earlier and $805.52 billion in July 1988. 
That left the industry nearly 10 times as large as it was just a decade ago, with as­

sets of $94.2 billion  as  of the  
end of 1979.  
Numbers  like  those  

stand as ample testimony to why investment experts have called the 1980s "the decade of financial assets." 
Dramatic bull markets in both stocks and bonds made a big contribution to the funds' growth. In July alone, for in­stance, rising stock prices swelled industry assets by about $14 billion. 
The financial boom also fu­eled a dramatic expansion in the number and types of funds available to investors. 
At the beginning of the '80s the institute counted 524 funds with slightly fewer than 10 mil­lion shareholder accounts. By the end of 1988, there were 2,718 funds with close to 55 million accounts. 
All this naturally poses some questions: How long can this kind of growth continue, and where is it leading the nation's investors? 
The funds had a hot streak once before, though of lesser 

proportions, during the great 
bull market for stocks in the 
1960s. It gave way to a period 
of contraction and disillusion­
ment in the early 1970s when 
the hot "go-go" funds of that 
era turned cold. 
In those days, however, mu­tual funds were considered al­most exclusively a vehicle for investing in stocks. Notably, there were no money market mutual funds at all until the Reserve Fund made its debut in 1972. 
Today, stock funds, with as­sets of about $237 billion, re­main a significant part of the industry. But money market and short-term municipal bond funds, at about $400 billion, and bond and income funds, at about $300 billion, both outrank them in size. 
That goes a long way toward explaining why the stock mar­ket crash of 1987 inflicted only minor damage on the industry. A lot of money that might have simply fled the business 20 years before was instead switched into other types of funds. 
Still, even with its new diver­sity, many observers agree that the industry's growth would likely slow or stop should the nation run into a spell of eco­nomic trouble on the order of the one that occurred in the 1970s. 
Stock funds, as ever, would be vulnerable to a bear market. Many bon'd funds, especially those that invest in so-called "junk" bonds, could fall into disfavor in a slump that caused increased defaults by busi­nesses. 
The many income funds that speeialize in government securi­ties, where the risk of default is considered very slight, could also lose a lot of their appeal if bond prices were depressed by a flareup of inflation and higher interest rates. 
But most analysts agree that the 1980s mutual fund boom has gone much too far for too long to be regarded as only some temporary growth spurt. 
Millions of American in­vestors evidently have con­cluded over the past 10 years that they want or need profes­sional help in managing their finances. And as demand for that kind of service increased, mutual fund managers were right there waiting, only too happy to meet it. 


Market advances slightly, softening losing week 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -The stock market managed a small ad­vance Friday in the final ses­sion of its first losing week since late June. 
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.66 to 2,709.54, reducing its loss for the week to 42.55 points. 
That ended a string of nine weeks in which the average put together consecutive gains to­taling 312.03 points. 
Advancing issues outnum­bered declines by about 10 to 9 in the daily tally of nationwide trading in New York Stock Ex­change-listed stocks, with 7 46 up, 685 down and 552 un­changed. 
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 154.09 mil­lion shares, down from 160.16 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated vol­ume in NYSE-Iisted issues, in­cluding trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 182.61 million shares. 

Analysts said traders' spirits got a small lift from declines in open-market interest rates. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the oppo­site direction from interest rates, rose about $5 for each $1,000 in face value. 
But doubts persisted about the chances for any concerted move in the near future by the Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy further. 
That view, in turn, has rein­forced suspicions among·many market participants that stocks might be due for a pullback after their strong advance through the first eight months of the year. 
Brokers say the market's rise to record highs in late August also may have touched off some selling by investors who had been waiting "get out even" after suffering large paper losses in the crash of 198 7. 
F.W. Woolworth made the biggest contribution to the Dow's gain, climbing 3 to 71 3/4. The company declined comment on persistent specula­tion in the market about a pos­sible takeover or restructuring move. 
Among other actively traded blue chips, Eastman Koaak rose 3/4 to 49 7/8 and Exxon gained 1/8 to 44 3/8, while General Electric slipped 1/8 to 56 1/2 and International Busi­ness Machines was down 1/4 at 116. 
Airline stocks continued their recent pullback after a dra­matic runup this summer on buyout news and rumors. UAL lost 1 1/2 to 280 1/4; AMR 1 5/8 to 81, and Delta Air Lines 3/4 to 74 1/2. 
Abbott Laboratories added 1 1/8 to 62 7/8. The company re­peated projections of record sales and earnings this year, and said directors authorized it to buy back as many as 10 mil­lion of its common shares. 
As measured by Wilshire As­sociates' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $4.05 bil­lion, or 0.12 percent, in value. 
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks crept ahead .17 to 193.95. 
Standard & Poor's industrial index rose .26 to 399.47, and S&P's 500-stock composite in­dex was up .41 at 348.76. 
The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained 1.63 to 471.31. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index closed at 384.10, up . 91.

Ford supplier strike interrupts truck plant production, but negotiations .to resume 
Associated Press 
MUNCIE, Ind. --Management and union negotiators at Borg­Warner Automotive exchanged contract proposals Friday but agreed not to resume their talks until Monday morning. 
Meanwhile, Ford announced it would stop production at its Wayne, Mich., truck plant for the week of Sept. 18 because the strike had interrupted its supply of transmissions. The Ford plant employs about 1,660 hourly workers and makes F-series and Bronco trucks. 
Local 287 of the United Auto Workers struck Borg-Warner when its contract expired Wednesday night at midnight. The more than 2,100 members of the local plant are taking turns manning four-hour shifts on their picket lines in front of the plant.

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Maverick Soviet politician Boris Yeltsin said Sunday that his country faces continuing economic and social decline and can learn from American democracy while changing its political sys­tem. 
"We are in an economic and financial and social crisis, as well as in respect to the (Communist) party," Yeltsin said on CBS News' "Face the Nation." 
Yeltsin arrived Saturday to begin his first visit to the United States, a two-week tour that includes stops throughout the country. 
"We have to take what is positive from Soviet experience and what has been positive in the experience of thP. other so­cialist countries, positive from America's more than 200 years

told students not to come home. 
Grubert told of one family where both parents were members of the party. After they realized what happened they both resigned from the party, said Grubert. 
The students participated in three seminars at Notre Dame after the massacre. People who were in China at the time of the massacre spoke to the students, said Grubert. A University physics professor, John Dow, was on scene at the time of the massacre in Bejing, said Grubert. 
In mid-August students also attended a Chinese national solidarity meeting in Chicago, said Grubert. A Chinese pro­democracy student leader addressed the group. 
of democratic experience and on the basis of that create a new model of socialism," Yeltsin .said through a transla­tor. 
"We do need a new model of socialism, yes," he said. "We have to stop being so dogmatic as we were before." 
"The whole society is in a cri­sis and such extraordinary measures of an economic or fi­nancial nature are obviously necessary since the standard recently not only has not risen but has actually fallen," he said. 
Yeltsin, 58, lost his position as Moscow's Communist Party chief in 1987 after criticizing the slow pace of change under Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. But this year he was overwhelmingly elected to the Soviet Congress, where he is an outspoken member of a rad­ical bloc. 

"The student leader was so exhausted from his hunger strike and travels he couldn't complete the speech, " said Grubert. The Notre Dame students were touched by the fellow student's self-sacrifice, he added. 
Short-term the students are not optimistic about the prospects, said Grubert, but he did say they are more positive about the long-term situation. The students miss their families and the International Student Affairs Office has helped to bring some families here, including some spouses, said Grubert. 

Grubert said he wrote letters to the embassy and the consulate of ShangHai on behalf of a student whose husband has been denied travel to the U.S. three times. 
Two students did return home after the massacre, said 
Gorbachev, he said, "missed some opportunities to acceler­ate perestroika," or political and economic restructuring. 
"Naturally, there has started a movement from below in the form of strikes indicating dis­satisfaction with the national 
leadership, including with Mr. Gorbachev," Yeltsin said. 
"If the situation gets worse, and I think it is going to, his popularity and authority will doubtless continue to decline." 
However, Yeltsin said he be­lieves Gorbachev "did a lot about the democratization of the country" and that he "will indeed retain his position as leader." 
He added: "I would like him to remain the leader of the country and I think that's the way it's going to be -for the time being." 
Grubert. One male student left Notre Dame two days after the massacre to "share the love and solidarity of students in the United States with the families of those who were killed," said Grubert. The other returning 
student was female. 
Grubert said presently a three day National Association of Foreign Student Affairs (NAFSA) conference is scheduled for October. He said various authorities on China will hold sessions for the Chinese students to help them deal with the turmoil in their country. 
NAFSA also aids in the networking of Chinese students across American campuses. This summer NAFSA sent China alerts to keep students posted of the situation and gave Congress and the Senate updates.

them held up a sign saying, 
"Give it up Erich!" referring to 
East German Communist leader 
Erich Honecker. 
About 100 feet away, on the 
Austrian side of the massive 
border barrier, many East 
Germans jumped from their 
cars and danced with joy. 
The mass emigration of East 
Germans to West Germany is 
the largest since the Berlin Wall 
was built in 1961 to stem the 
flow across the border. 
East Germany promptly at­
tacked the Hungarian decision, 
announced Sunday, saying 
Budapest had "directly inter­
fered" in East Germany's inter­
nal affairs. 
"The Hungarian government 
has chosen to illegally allow 
East German citizens to travel 
to West Germany in violation of 
international treaty," the state 
news agency ADN said. 
It said that Hungary, "under 
the guise of humanitarianism, 
has engaged in the organized 
smuggling of human beings." 
West Germany said Hungary 
made a "humanitarian" deci­
sion. 
A statement Sunday by the of­ficial Hungarian news agency MTI said: "Hungary has de­. cided to make it possible for the East German citizens stay­ing in Hungary and refusing to return home to leave to any country which is prepared to let

Thursday by the St. Joseph County Health Department after a 19-year-old student from Kansas came down with the disease.

be obtained in the quantities needed in so little time. 
The Public Health Department provided all the medical staff for the effort while the German citizens leave Hungary with their East German travel documents," it said. "The bor­der guards are instructed to let them leave at any border point," starting at midnight (6 

p.m. EDT). 
The Hungarian foreign minis­ter, Gyula Horn, suggested on Hungarian TV that tens of thousands of other East Germans now vacationing in Hungary also may choose to leave for the West along with those in the refugee camps. 
To make the exodus possible, he said,. Hungary decided to suspend a 1969 bilateral agreement with East Germany, a Warsaw Pact ally, saying Hungary should not take into account West Germany's claim to East Germans. 
The fate of the refugees had been discussed for weeks by East and West Germany, with Hungary insisting it was pri­marily a bystander interested in 
seeing a solution. The commu­nique said, "The talks between East Germany and West Germany ended in failure." It did not elaborate. 
There are about 60,000 East Germans now in Hungary," Horn said in the television in­terview, referring to thousands who have not registered with the West German Embassy in Budapest to leave, and are formally in Hungary as vaca­tioners. 

University provided clerical staff to distribute forms and keep track of who has been immunized. 
Seager said medical staff came from Indianapolis and Marion, Ind., to assist with the immunizations and will be back today. The Student Union Board, Student Activities Office, Center for Social Concerns and campus chapter of the Ameri­can Red Cross provided student volunteers to aid in clerical work. 
Anyone who does not get im­munized today and contracts measles will be quarantined for two weeks by order of the County Health Department.

JOEBUCOLO 
To be continued ... 
Airing at 9 p.m. Tuesdays, 
"Midnight Caller" presents 
Jack Killian (Gary Cole) be­
hind his microphone at 
KJCM, 98.3 FM in San Fran­
cisco. With the help of his 
producer Billy Po (Dennis 
Dun), Jack hosts an evening 
radio talk show called 
"Midnight Caller." 
Each week's episode places 
Jack in a situation that 
takes him away from his 
microphone to scenarios not 
often familiar to a talk show 
host. Lieutenant Carl 
Zymack's (Arthur Taxier) 
regular presence on the 
show alerts viewers to the 
fact that, somehow, police 
are involved in most plot­
lines. 
In one episode, Jack falls headphones over heels in love with an attractive night club singer. After a few dates (and a few hundred trips to the bedroom), Jack finds himself to be the prime suspect for the murder of his lover's ex-husband. That particular plotline-like most of the ones presented on "Caller"-is mysterious, intriguing, and steamy. 
The "look" of "Midnight Caller" has more sparkle than the diamond needle on Jack's phonograph. Set against the backdrop of the San Francisco skyline, the show unravels its storylines in bar rooms, back alleys, dark condominiums, and, of course, the radio station. These dark scenarios are lit by colorful flashes of neon and jazzy music. 
Despite the show's intense entertainment, two aspects tionable that Jack would be catching killers and solving 
world crises. 
The second problem radi­ates from the flashing switchboard at the station. Jack's show airs at mid­night, when most people are asleep; however, more peo­ple seem to call Jack in the middle of the night than tuned in to see the chairs fly on the famous episode of "Geraldo." Those who are awake at such an odd hour of the day are seldom in the mood-or condition-to dis­cuss the socially-relevant is­sues Jack addresses. If one can overlook these two problems (and it's easy to do), he will surely enjoy what "Midnight" has to offer. 
The cast on the show is wonderful. Cole portrays Jack as a caring, concerned, and educated man who en­joys a "tough guy" image. Taxier and Dun's support­ing roles are equally convincing-as is the perfor­mance by Wendy Kilbourne, who plays station owner Devon King; however, the in­tense radio waves of this show come from writers and directors who carefully com­bine creative plots with im­agery that effervesces with the flavor of urban life in the late 80s. 
NBC's "Midnight Caller" is 
a dark, driven show, full of 
intense drama. It enter­
tains-and often educates­
its audience. Now if Jack 
could only coin a catchy 
opening phrase. "Good 
morning, San Francisco?"

Mazzilli lifts Blue Jays over Indians 
Associated Press 
CLEVELAND -Pinch hitting demon Lee Mazzilli rolled an RBI single through the left side of the infield with one out in the 1Oth inning Sunday as the red­hot Toronto Blue Jays won their second extra-inning gam.e in two days, beating the Cleveland Indians 5-4. 
The Blue Jays, who opened a 2 1/2-game lead over Baltimore in the American League East, have won 11 of their last 13 games. The Indians have lost eight of 10. 
Tony Fernandez opened the Toronto 1Oth with a single off rookie Steve Olin, took second on a groundout and scored on Mazzilli's single. Since coming to the Blue Jays on July 31, Mazzilli is 3-for-5 with a homer and four RBis as a pinch hitter. 
Heliever Jim Acker pitched three scoreless innings for the victory, striking out five and snapping a personal 14-game losing streak. He worked out of a one-out, bases-loaded jam in the bottom of the ninth, strik­ing out Joe Carter and getting Pete O'Brien on a forceout and recorded his first victory since Sept. 24, 198, when he pitched for Atlanta. 
Cleveland starter John Farrell pitched nine innings, giving up four runs in the second inning, two of them unearned on shortstop Tommy Hinzo's two­out throwing error. Dion James drove in all four Cleveland runs with two singles and a homer against Dave Stieb. 
Rangers 8, Orioles 1 
ARLINGTON, Texas -Mike Stanley keyed Texas' six-run first inning with a three-run double and Jamie Moyer pitched a six-hitter for his first complete game of the season. Baltimore's 2 1/2-game deficit is the Orioles' largest since May 10.

Knudson allowed only a bunt hit to Omar Vizquel in the third inning and a single to Ken Griffey Jr. in the seventh. The 28-year-old right-hander won his fourth game in five starts after moving from the bullpen into the starting rotation on Aug. 11 and the Seattle run was unearned. 
With the score tied 1-1, Vaughn drew a leadoff walk in the fifth from Randy Johnson and went to third on a single by Joey Meyer. With both runners on the move, Charlie O'Brien missed a bunt on a suicide squeeze but the ball got past catcher Scott Bradley to the backstop.

Results mixed for new coaches as NFL season opens 
Associated Press 
The red carpet went out for five new coaches in the NFL on Sunday. Bud Carson and George Seifert got the royal treatment, but the rug was pulled out from under Jimmy Johnson and two others. 
Guided by the precise hand of Bobby Hebert, the New Orleans Saints handed the Cowboys a 28-0 loss in Johnson's first game as a pro coach. It was Dallas' first regular-season loss by shutout since 1985. 
Carson launched his coaching career at Cleveland with a 51-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers, for whom he used to be defensive coach. It was the most lopsided loss in Steelers history. 
Seifert, meanwhile, guided the defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers to a 30-24 victory over the Indianapolis Colts in his first game since re­placing the retired Bill Walsh. 
In his debut with San Diego, Dan Henning saw the Chargers fall 40-14 to the Los Angeles Raiders, and Denver defeated Kansas City 34-20 in Marty Schottenheimer's first game as Chiefs head coach. 
Saints 28, Cowboys 0 
Johnson came out of a very successful Miami, Fla., college program to take over a 3-13 Cowboys club that, for its first 29 seasons, had been coached by Landry and once was very successful itself. 
Not so, Sunday, though. New Orleans' defense held Dallas to just 20 yards total rushing ­10 by Herschel Walker -and Hebert directed a ball-control offense that saw the Saints possess the ball for 44:02 to just 15:58 for Dallas. Hebert completed 16 of 19 passes for 153 yards without an intercep­tion. Browns 51, Steelers 0 
Carson's revamped Browns defense forced eight turnovers, including five fumbles, and sacked quarterback Bubby Brister five times in the worst defeat in the Steelers' 58-year history. 
Dennis Grayson scored on a 28-yard fumble return and a 14-yard interception. 
49ers 30, Colts 24 
Roger Craig scored two touchdowns, and Jerry Rice caught a 58-yard scoring pass from Joe Montana as the 49ers beat Indianapolis. The touch­down reception was the 50th of Rice's career. 
Another career milestone was reached when Eric Dickerson of the Colts ran for 106 yards and became the seventh player and quickest to reach the 10,000­yard rushing plateau. Dickerson did it in his 91st game; Jim Brown did it in 98. 
Raiders 40, Chargers 14 
Steve Beuerlein replaced in­jured Raiders quarterback Jay Schroeder in the first quarter and passed for 206 yards and two touchdowns as Los Angeles spoiled Henning's debut. 
Jim McMahon, traded to San Diego from Chicago, completed just seven of 18 passes for 91 yards and was replaced by David Archer midway through the third quarter. 
Broncos 34, Chiefs 20 Denver converted four Kansas City turnovers into 24 
points, including  touchdowns  
on  interception  returns  by  
Tyrone  Braxton  and  Randy  

Robbins, as Schottenheimer lost in his first game as Chiefs coach. Schottenheimer had been 0-4 against Denver before his falling out with Browns owner Art Modell. 
Kansas City turnovers on consecutive plays from scrim­mage in the first quarter helped stake Denver to a 17-0 lead. Braxton intercepted a Steve DeBerg pass and returned it 34 yards for a 10-0 lead. 
Bears 17, Bengals 14 
Mike Tomczak rallied not only himself but also the Bears to victory with a 20-yard touchdown pass to James Thornton in the fourth quarter. 
Tomczak, in his first game as the Bears' undisputed, No. 1 quarterback, completed just 6 of 16 passes in the first three quarters. But he ct·mpleted 4 of 7 in the fourth qua:ter, includ­ing the 20-yarder t 1 Thornton with 4:54 left. 
Buccaneers 23, Packers 21 
Lars Tate scored on two 
short touchdown runs, set up 
by the passing of Vinny 
Testaverde, and Mark Robinson 
intercepted a pass by Green Bay 
quarterback Don Majkowski at 
the 8-yard line with five min­
utes left, stopping a final 
Packers drive. 
Rams 31, Falcons 21 Jim Everett threw for one 
touchdown and ran for another as the Rams upstaged the splashy debut of Atlanta's baseball-playing kick-return 
man, Deion Sanders. Everett threw a 46-yard "Hail Mary" scoring pass to Henry Ellard on the final play of the first half, giving the Rams a 17-14 lead. 
Cardinals 16, Lions 13 
AI Del Greco's 33-yard field goal with 13 seconds broke a tie and helped Phoenix beat the Lions, whose All~America hold­out from Oklahoma State, Barry Sanders, made an im­pressive debut. 
Sanders, who held out until Thursday, came into the game in the third quarter and led the Lions on a scoring drive with runs of 18, 3, 5, and 3 yards before he blasted 2 yards into the end zone with 3:01 left in the quarter. Sanders finished with 71 yards on nine carries. 
Eagles 31, Seahawks 7 
Randall Cunningham passed for 240 yards and two touch­downs, leading Philadelphia over Seattle. The Eagles de­fense. which scored one touch­down, had three interceptions, three sacks, a blocked punt and held Seattle to 77 yards rush­ing. 

Dickerson joins elite group of running backs 
yards, and he was given the ball. 
Walter Payton, the NFL ca­reer record-holder with 16,726 yards, needed 113 games to reach 10,000. Tony Dorsett, second in yardage with 12,739, took 122 games to reach that plateau. 
The other 10,000-yard rush­ers, with their yardage and the number of games it took, are Brown, 12,312, 98 games; Franco Harris, 12,120, 134 games; John Riggins, 11,352, 156 games, and O.J. Simpson, 11,236, 110 games. 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS Eric Dickerson, the NFL rushing leader in four of his first six seasons, on Sunday became the seventh player in league history to rush for more than 10,000 career yards. 
Dickerson, who started the season with 9,915 yards, reached 10,000 on his 16th carry Sunday, a 9-yard gain in the third quarter of the Indianapolis Colts' 30-24 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. 
It was the 91st game of Dickerson's career, breaking the record of 98 by Jim Brown for the fewest games needed to reach 10,000 yards. 
"It's a great honor to get the yards, to get them as quick as I did against the players I did," said Dickerson, who finished the game with 106 yards on 19 carries, raising his career total to 10,021. 
"But it's a lot tougher to get yards now. The defenses are all so big and fast and quick." 
The game was stopped briefly after Dickerson reached 10,000

Miami begins post-Johnson era in big style with rout of Badgers 
Assodated Press 
Jimmy Johnson and Steve Walsh are in Dallas, but Miami's attack looks very much the same. 
Craig Erickson, Walsh's replacement at quarterback, threw four touchdown passes Saturday as the third-rank!!d Hurricanes routed Wisconsin 51-3 in their first game under coach Dennis Erickson. 
Quarterback Erickson started slowly, connecting on only one of his first 10 passes. But the junior eventually found his 
rhythm and finished  17 -of-37  
for 281 yards.  
"I  just  wanted  to  get  

Wisconsin out of the way," he said. "I struggled early on but then I did some things better. I didn't feel any pressure." 
Coach Erickson, who took over for Johnson after he went to the Dallas Cowboys. was pleased with his Miami debut. 
"Just getting the first game out of the way is a big relief because now you'll ask me some different questions," he told reporters. 
Auburn 55, Pacific 0 
Alexander Wright caught four long touchdown passes and Auburn piled up 586 yards on offense. 
Wright caught scoring passes of 78, 73 and 60 and 41 yards and set a Southeastern Conference record for receiving yards in a game with 263. The old mark of 239 was set by Carlos Alvarez of Florida in 1969. Auburn's Heggie Slack completed 9-of-1 0 passes for 252 yards and four touchdowns in limited playing time. Auburn is 1-0, while Pacific fell to 0-2. 
Tennessee 24, UCLA 6 
Hedshirt freshman Chuck Webb rushed for 134 yards on 22 carries and scored two touchdowns. Webb's scoring runs of 2 and 10 yards in the third quarter gave the Volunteers, 2-0, a 21-0 lead. 
Oklahoma 33, Baylor 7 
Backup quarterback Chris Melson scored once and directed two other first-half touchdown drives for Oklahoma. which gained all of its 338 yards on the ground. 
Nebraska 48, N. Ill. 17 
Ken Clark, who gained all his yardage in 20 minutes before leaving with a sore knee, rushed for 168 yards and one touchdown as the Cornhuskers overcame five first-half turnovers in their opener. 
Va. 14, Penn St. 6 
Shawn Moore threw two first-half touchdown passes to Herman Moore as the Nittany Lions lost for the sixth time in their last seven games. 
Syracuse 43, Temple 3

WVa. 14, Maryland 10 
Major Harris and Garrett Ford ran for second-half touchdowns as the Mountaineers. 2-0, capitalized on two turnovers to overcome a 10-0 halftime deficit.

Clemson 34, FSU 23 
Terry Allen scored three touchdowns in the first half, including a 73-yard scoring run. Allen finished with 130 yards on 20 carries as Clemson, 2-0, avenged last year's 24-21 loss to the Seminoles. 
Colorado 45, CSU 20 
Eric Bieniemy ran for 156 yards and three touchdowns for Colorado, which scored on four consecutive possessions after trailing 17-14 midway through the second quarter. 

Kentucky coach pleased with win 
Associated Press 
LEXINGTON, Ky. -While Kentucky's 17-14 victory over Indiana was far from a masterpiece, Coach Jerry Claiborne couldn't fault the effort by the Wildcats in the season-opener. 
"We're proud of the way players gave effort," Claiborne said at his Sunday news conference. "We feel that was the biggest part of the football game." 
Kentucky had four turnovers and was penalized nine times for 65 yards while Indiana had 11 penalties for 105 yards. 
The Kentucky coach was particularly pleased with the play of linebacker Craig Benzinger, who led the team with 18 tackles, two coming in a goal-line stand that preserved the victory. 
"We thought he had a heck of a game," Claiborne said. Benzinger was involved in stopping Indiana quarterback 
David Schnell on Kentucky's 6­inch line on a third-down play, and on the next play tackled tailback Anthony Thompson for no gain. 
"The goal-line stand was a big, big play," Claiborne said, "but on third-down Benzinger. (Hon) Robinson and (Tony) Missick made the play by stopping Schnell on the option play. 
"If not made, there would have been no fourth down because they would have scored." 
Claiborne thought quarterback Freddie Maggard showed promise in his first start. Maggard completed eight of 15 passes for 131 yards and was intercepted twice. 
"Freddie made a couple of mistakes on the interceptions and a couple of bad reads in the option," he said. "But that was his first game and we think with work he'll continue to get better." 
Claiborne said the Wildcats also need to improve on the kicking game. 
"Although we didn't have any punts blocked, we almost had three blocked," he said. "We thought the coverage was good with the exception of one punt." 

He also wasn't pleased with the running game, except for tailback Alfred Rawls' 107 yards on 18 carries. The Wildcats amassed only 130 yards on the ground. 
"We didn't feel the running game went nearly as well as we need if we're going to be a successful football team," he said. "We didn't run that well on first down. We felt Hawls did break out a few times. We didn't feel like we blocked as well as we should have on the corners." 
AI Baker had 15 carries for 32 yards, but fumbled the ball away twice. 
"I guess after he lost the fumble early in the game he may have become tentative with the ball," Claiborne said.

NEW YORK -Boris Becker owns a good clump of Wimbledon grass and, now, a solid chunk of U.S. Open cement. 
Becker proved emphati­cally Sunday that he is no one-surface wonder. The Wimbledon whiz won his first American championship and staked his claim to the world's No. 1 ranking by beating top-seeded Ivan LendI 7-6, 1-6, 6-3, 7-6 on a sweltering day at the National Tennis Center. 
"This is much more ex­hausting," Becker said, comparing the Open to Wimbledon. "It's even more exhausting than the French Open, with the heat, the planes and the spectators." 
~requently icing his legs and eating fruit during breaks, the second seed from West Germany took his fourth Grand Slam title. lie won his third Wimbledon crown in July. 
That double success won't be enough to lift him past Lendl in the computer rank­ings. But Becker's strong serve and improved court command were enough to outlast the three-time Open champion in the 3-hour, 51­minute battle in tempera­tures that reached 110 de­grees on the court. 
"I won Wimbledon and the 
U.S. Open this year," Becker said. "The computer doesn't say so, but I'm quite close to it, if not No. 1. 
"Ivan is consistent and he's won many smaller tour­naments. But I've learned that the Grand Slams are more important and to do well there is what it's all about. It's the best I can be." 
Lendl admitted "there is a very good case" for Becker being No. 1.. 
"But I remember in '86, when I had won two Grand

The Notre Dame women's soccer team couldn't escape Wisconsin over the weekend. Better make that couldn't escape the Wisconsins. 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee edged the Irish 2-1 on Friday, and third-ranked Wisconsin­Madison trounced them 6-0 on Saturday. 
Head Coach Dennis Grace, however, was upbeat about the trip. 
"It was a fantastic trip in a lot of ways," Grace said. "We played two fantastic teams, we played hard, and I feel very good about how we came out of it all. 
"I make the schedules, and we knew exactly what we were get­ting into. I had no problem with the fact that we were playing one of the top teams in the country on the road, or that we put our backs against the wall." 
Grace's very young team is still in the building stage, this being the team's second season with varsity status. Five fresh­men and three sophomores started for the Irish in Wisconsin. 
"We're not excited about los­ing 6-0, but I definitely think we came out very positive," Grace said. "We learned a lot. It's im­portant to know that you can

The Irish fell 2-1 to UW­Milwaukee, a game of which Grace said "We had a good chance of winning." 
The next outing was against heavily favored UW-Madison, a national power in women's soc­cer. 
"They were absolutely incred­ible," Grace said. "They were bigger, they were faster, they were technically and tactically better. Now that we've seen them, we know the kind of things we can aspire to. We know ways in which we can grow and develop. We have an excellent future here, and that's something we'll always have."
