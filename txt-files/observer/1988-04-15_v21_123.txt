Mock convention nominates Gore VP 
Three Saint Mary's College students relax in front of LeMans Hall as the sun casts its golden rays on the building. Their minds are turning to the summer ahead (and the exams which come first!).

Amid political intrigues that would make Tip O'Neill blush, the Mock National Convention ended Thursday night with both a whimper and a bang. 
With a turnout lower than ex­pected, the convention ended on an anticlimatic note, as the contest for Democratic vice presidential nominee bogged down into a stalemate in three separate ballots. 
Students reactions highlight task forum 
By JANET HEROLD News Staff 
Students presented mixed reactions to the University task forces' recommendations on alcohol and residentiality at a forum held Thursday in Lewis Hall. 
In response to the residen­tiality task force's recommen­dations for co-educational dorms, one Lewis resident stated that she thought the creation of a co-educational dorm "would be really great." Other students expressed con­cerns that a co-ed dorm would ruin the overall character of the University. 
Student response to the recommendations regarding elimination of dorm-purchased alcohol at SYRs was negative. The students generally agreed that attendance would decline at SYRs if dorms stopped pro­viding alcohol.

After meeting in a ten­minute recess, convention leaders decided to suspend the majority-vote requirement. This allowed Albert Gore to win the Notre Dame vice presiden­tial nomination with a plurality of the 660 convention votes. 
Gore defeated Jesse Jackson in the fourth ballot, 300-280. The Tennessee senator trailed the civil rights leader, 185-215, in the first ballot, but overtook him in the second with a tally of 299 and stayed on top for the rest of the evening. 
At first it looked like an upset was in the making. Dark horse candidate Vince Willis, conven­tion chairman and Notre Dame senior, snatched two votes in the first ballot. Willis' hopes were dashed, however, when a motion passed to disqualify him because he was not 35 years old, according to Brigid Welch, executive assistant of the mock convention. 
Gore's coup de grace, however, did not come un­eventfully. The last night of the convention literally went out with a bang, as two men wearing camouflage plants and head bands stormed the convention stage with submac­hine squirt guns. 
The mock terrorists quickly mowed down the convention leaders on the stage and seized Denise Weis and Michele Burkart as hostages. 
Mock secret service agents drove the attackers away with plastic Uzi's and cap guns, but. only after the mock terrorists sprayed several salvos into the audience of delegates. The two

"We saw the disturbance and we eliminated it," Pax said. 
The two gunmen identified themselves as Tom Pichette and Brian O'Fallon, members of the Notre Dame Jihad. 
"Our demands are more beer and more women --in that or­der," O'Fallon said.

DALLAS--With $234,000 already in hand, a "flabber­gasted" radio station staff on Thursday continued counting loot that poured in after a disc jockey asked lis­teners to send $20 checks without saying what he would do with the money. 
"We never promised anybody anything," said Ron Chapman, a KVIL-FM disc jockey. "That's the joy of this. We just said send the money. We've got a back room full of people (counting money). 
"We're absolutely stunned. We're flabber­asted." 

SMC names Geyer '88 commencement speaker
Chapman said he asked his audience to send him money on March 31 as an ex­periment. 
After his first request, 4,000 checks for $20 each ar­rived in the mail the next day. On the following Mon­day, an additional 5,000 checks arrived, a flood so heavy that Chapman went on the air to say, "OK, folks: that's it. Don't send any more checks after today." 
The station hasn't decided yet what to do. Chapman said it initially planned to return the checks, possibly with $2 interest and a T­shirt, but now is thinking about using it for a special event.

The South Shore: A rail trip to Hell 
The South Shore Line. Those of us who know 
it love it and those who don't are, to say the 
least, deprived. Who could not but love the 
speed, comfort, excitement, atmosphere, 
safety, and scenery the South Shore offers? 
When I first arrived in South Bend, I planned on visiting Chicago for the first time. From the myriad of transportation possibilities, I chose to take the train --not just any train, though -­1 chose the South Shore. 
When I arrived at the station in South Bend

After I boarded, I was told by a fellow sufferer that the South Shore used to be affectionately called the 'Vomit Comet' by Notre Dame stu­dents of yesteryear. 
I hear, however, that the current version of the South Shore is a vast improvement over the one of eariler years and as a result this appel­lation is no longer applicable. I beg to differ.

To increase awareness, the Student Academic Council is sending information about the specific departmental compre­hensive exams to all juniors who have declared a major. 
The council is distributing forms containing information on when comprehensive exams will be administered, what preparation will be necessary and whether students will be required to attend senior sem­inar classes. 
"It is our goal to make stu­dents more aware of com­prehensives and why they are needed," said Julie Parrish, student body president and former vice president of aca­demic affairs. 
Many people at Saint Mary's feel this form is a step in the right direction. As mathema­tics Assistant Professor dents, Parrish said. 
Each senior must complete a long-term research project or take an exam that tests the knowledge gained over four years of study. The type of exam differs for each depart­ment. 
But comprehensive exams are changing constantly as each department tries to better them, said Parrish. 
The mathematics depart­mentis constantly trying to im­prove the math comprehen­sive, Peltier said, adding that a description of the exam ap­pears in the Saint Mary's Col­lege bulletin. "There has al­ways been a problem with students not being aware of what their comprehensive en­tails," he said. "This is the rea­son we publish the descrip­tion."

Marine claims lack proof, says U.S. 
Associated Press 
PANAMA CITY, Panama-­The U.S. military said Thursday it found no evidence backing Marine claims of uni­formed intruders at a fuel depot, but it stood by the story in the face of relentless Panamanian ridicule. 
Bill Ormsby, a civilian spokesman for the U.S. south­ern Command, said Marines scoured the rugged jungle where the shooting incidents, which left one Marine sentry dead, reportedly occurred Monday and Tuesday night. 
For the second straight day, state-run news media and Panama's Defense Forces heaped scorn on the American story. 
Ormsby said it would take at least another day for the mili­tary to complete its inspection of the 807-acre Arraijan Tank Farm, where 36 
Asked if the Southern Com­mand was still sticking to its accounts in the absence of con­crete evidence, Ormsby replied: 'yes, sir, we are." 
The next night, the Southern Command said, about 100 Marines and 40 to 50 intruders "wearing dark uniforms" en­gaged in a two-hour firefight.

Pichette stated they were acting on orders from a group called "Citizens for a More In­teresting Election."

-LaSata, mock leader of the Gore campaign, to a crowd shouting "Gore! Gore!" Gore won the nomination despite the defection of the "Graceland Coalition" to the Jackson camp, which gave the minister the votes of several highly populated states, accor­ding to LaSata. 
John Farley, mock leader of the Jackson campaign, criticized the decision to elim­inate the majority-vote re­quirement. "We shouldn't change the rules in the midstream." 
Mike Faehner, mock chair­man of the rules committee, denied the act constituted a rules change. "We made an ex­ecutive committee decision," he said, "not a rules change." 
Farley also had some harsh words for Jackson supporters. "Some of the overzealous sup­porters of Jackson started to backstab, to play dirty pool. I almost dropped out on the fourth ballot," he said. 
Some Jackson supporters spread rumors that Gore sup­porters were dismissing Jack­son on a rascist basis, accor­ding to one delegate who declined to identify herself. They spread rumors that Gore supporters believed Jackson was unacceptable because he would prove to be a political "albatross around the neck of Dukakis," she said. 
Mike Jaeger, a former Simon supporter who switched his votes to Jackson, openly ex­pressed this sentiment, saying a Dukakis-J ackson ticket would be "political suicide" because of the issue of race. 
Still Farley said, "the best man won." 
He added that the Graceland Coalition failed because it simply failed to attend the con­vention in "full strength." 
Beth Debauche, delegates chairman, said the low turnout was "disheartening." 
She recalled that the 1984 mock convention saw much larger crowds. "It would have been so much better had the people who signed up been more dedicated," she said. 
Debauche attributed the poor attendance to unfortunate scheduling. "Last time it was held earlier in the school year,'' she said, "and it took place Wednesday through Saturday when people had more free time." 
The approach of the New York primary was also key, she said. "Because of the New York primaries, many big names didn't show," she ex­plained, referring in particular to Michael Dukakis' daughter Andrea, who had been ex­pected to appear. 
Dukakis had been unable to attend because of a campaign engagement in New York, said Mark Bettencourt, mock leader of the Dukakis cam­paign. "New York is a key pri­mary," he said, "and they thought it would be in the best interest of the campaign if she went there."

Just thinking about college tuition is 
enough to make most parents break into 
a sweat. 

But can vou blame them? When vou 
consider th-e cost of tuition, books, · 
dorms-not to mention pizza parties­
you're talking big bucks. 
Which is why you should do some 
talking. Like telling your parents about 
the Education Loan Programs at 
Manufacturers Hanover Trust. 
At MH1~ not only do we participate 
in all three Federally guaranteed loan 
programs, but we also work with state 
and national agencies and can make 
guaranteed loans in all 50 states. 
In practically no time at all. 
In a matter of minutes, MHT Student 
Loan Processors can program your 
information into our computerized loan­
processing system. 

Within 24 hours, the Bank will get a decision from the Guarantee Agency. It's that simple. Better still, with MHT your parents will get all the money they need from one source. 
Example: If your folks need more money than government sources will give them, we can offer them tailor-made payment plans through The Education Loan Prqgram, Educational Lines of Credit or Monthly Budget Program and Pre-Payment Programs that make it easy for your parents to fund themselves. (The Education Loan Program, Monthly Budget and Pre-Payment Programs are offered through the Tuition Plan, a company of Manufacturers Hanover.) 
Once you get a loan from us, you can be sure it'll stay with us. Because we've never sold education loans to other banks (unless the borrower asked us to). 
So if you need money for school, call 1-800-MHT-GRAD and get yourself an MHT Education Loan Application. 
Then when your folks ask you about tuition, at least you'll have an answer. "No sweat."

Soviets sign pact for Afghan withdrawal 
Associated Press 
GENEVA--The Soviet Union 
signed a formal pledge 
Thursday to withdraw its 
troops from Mghanistan start­
ing May 15, but there was no 
indication from guerrillas that 
the Red Army will be allowed 
to leave peacefully after eight 
years of war. 
Moslem insurgent leaders, 
who were not invited to the 
negotiations, said they would 
present their reaction Satur­
day at a rally in Pakistan. 
The U.S.-supported guerril­las, who claim to control vir­tually all the country except the cities, ere expected to repeat their vow to continue fighting until the last Soviet soldier has left Mghan soil. 
The United States, the Soviet Union, Mghanistan and neigh­boring Pakistan, signed the ac­cord Thursday in an austere tO­minute ceremony. It stipulates that the withdrawal begin May 15. 
Mterward, Pakistan, which represented the guerrillas at the negotiations, predicted the civil war will go on because there is no provision for an in­terim government, and said it would continue denying recognition to the Communist regime in Kabul. 
Provisions of the agreement require the two countries to stop interfering in one an­other's affairs. The insurgents, who have been fighting since a Communist coup in April 1978, are based in camps and cities on Pakistan's side of the bor­
der.

P.O. Box Q 
Cystic Fibrosis 
benefit tonight 
Dear Editor: 
It is not everyday that students at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's can help save lives. This Friday at Stepan Cen­ter from 6 p.m. to 3 a.m. we will be given this opportunity. 
I had no idea of the seriousness of Cystic Fibrosis, until Dave Temeles, head of the project at Notre Dame, told me about it. CF attacks the respiratory system, making it almost impossible to breathe because of the mucus which builds up in the lungs. Most people who get this disease usually die before the time they are 21. The fact that most people who have CF are teenagers who die so young, really hit home with me. I wanted to get involved and make people aware of the disease that affects people our own age. 
The Great Escape '88 is the perfect opportunity for students to get in­volved. For a $5 ticket that could help save a life, you could dance for 9 hours to different campus bands. 
Hopefully the fund raiser will be suc­cessful and other universities will join Notre Dame in the fight to find a cure for CF. All that is needed now is the support of you, the students, who enjoy dancing with your friends, having a good time, and helping out others less fortunate that you are.

Student Senate lacks competence 
Dear Editor: 
After reading The Observer's report on the new Student Senate's first meeting last Monday, Apr.ll, I just had to laugh. The Senate discussed whether or not seniors should be included in an upcoming Student Government Sur­vey;Questionnaire. Dr. Patrick Murphy, Associate Professor of Mar­keting, had advised a student govern­ment representative that in order to as­sure the statistical soundness of the survey, seniors should not be included. With this information fully in hand, the Senate members decided to include seniors in the survey. That sure makes sense to me. I laughed becuse this logi­cal decision-making has typified the Student Senate's actions all year long. I had hoped this was a characteristic unique to this year's Senate, but from this first meeting, it appears that even with an entirely new membership, save one or two people, the legacy is con­tinuing into next year. 
If members of the Senate truly believe that they collectively represent the intentions and concerns of the gen­eral student body, then why don't they act accordingly? I doubt very many students on this campus are prone to continually act unintelligently, foolish­ly, irrationally, unreasonably, and without foresight. Therefore, how could a body which acts in such a manner consider itself representative of the stu­dents? 
I wonder if the new Senate members, 
in commenting on their goals for the 
Student Senate, stated a desire to 
simply evaluate what their role on this 
campus should be and how best they 
could truly represent the students as 
they so often like to say they do. Since 
this simple self-evaluation and reflec­
tion would be a most intelligent and con­
scientious first step, probably not.

Student workers host picnic 
Dear Editor: 

An event occurred this past Saturday, April 9, which wasn't publicized. This first time event was held for some of the hardest working people on this campus -University Food Service Stu­dent Employees. 
The North Dining Hall, the South Dining Hall, and the Huddle had a vol­leyball tournament with a BBQ. It was the first time that such an event took place. 
The idea was hatched between the UFS student managers. We planned an event for the students on the same day as the Fisher Regatta, the Jazz Fes­tival, the Football Picnic, and several other events which kept UFS busy. It was the only day we had before we start our finals schedules but our turnout numbered approximately over 100 stu­dents and a few full-time employees. 
It would not have been possible with­out the help of the UFS managers. A special thanks goes to Walt Dudka of North Dining Hall, Barb Corbat of South Dining Hall, and Mike Davy of the Huddle for all the help they did in getting our food and equipment. 
There is one man whose support and help we could not have done without ­Mr. Bill Hickey. Thanks for the encour­agement and the confidence you gave us. Thanks to everyone who showed up and we'll wee you next year at the Second Annual Volleyball BBQ!

"Life of Brian" and ND values 
I Dear Editor: Saint Mary's Student Activities Board and the Notre Dame Student Union Board are sponsoring a lecture by Graham Chapman on April 24 at O'Laughlin Auditorium at Saint Mary's. At the very least, the fact that two Catholic institutions of higher learning are presenting this lecture seems very inappropriate. 
I OON'T KNOW, kilL THEY UIT LEFTIES PRETT't' GOOD. 
IXl YOO UAVE ANY 
EXPERI~NCF 
Chapman is a member of the Monty Python comedy troupe, and he starred in the film "Life of Brian," which is a spoof on the life of Christ. "Life of Brian" has been condemned by the Catholic Church, and it is a film which a great many Christians find extremely offensive. It presents Christ's life, crucifixion and resurrection as butts of jokes. After seeing such a film, one begins to wonder, "is nothing sacred?" 
Knowing that Saint Mary's SAB and Notre Dame's SUB have invited Chap­man to speak at Saint Mary's and have advertised it as a major entertainment event of the semester, one must ques­tion their judgement. Do they know about "Life of Brian?" Notre Dame's SUB must, because they are showing the film this week, and they have shown it in the past as well. Do they see any conflict between the mission of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's and not only showing "Life of Brian" but inviting Chapman to speak at Saint Mary's? Maybe they ought to consider such a conflict because, last time I checked the charter, we were a Catholic Uni­versity.

ith the success of the Nazz competition and the recent Killdozer show, this spring has given students an excellent opportunity to hear local and campus bands at Notre Dame. Tonight's "Great Escape '88" band marathon, recently changed from 6 p.m. --3 a.m. to 6 p.m. --2 a.m. at Stepan Center, will benefit Cystic Fibrosis, and feature campus and regional bands, in addition to a talented, well-known Chicago band, Material Issue. 
CONCERT 

Having opened for the Replacements, 10,000 Maniacs, and dozens of other bands, Ma­terial Issue has recently com­pleted a successful tour of Mid­western college campuses with Green, another critically ac­claimed Chicago band. A former member of Green, lead singer and guitarist Jim Ellison formed Material Issue over two years ago, with Ted Ansami on bass and vocals and Mike Zelenka on drums. 
The band's name originates from a form that Ellison had to fill out daily when he worked at a security alarm factory. The three musicians have very diverse tastes in music, ranging from AC!DC to the Eagles to Soul Asylum. 
Material Issue's first release, a now sold out, self-titled EP on Landmlnd Records, Is due to be

re-released soon. The EP fea­tures ex-Big Black member San­tiago Durango on guitars for "She's Going Through my Head," 
and was produced by a former member of the Shoes, Jeff Murphy. Material Issue's music Is characterized by loud, driving guitars and gripping harmonies, blended into skillfully written pop songs. 
According to Ellison, the band tries to focus on the quality of the individual songs, rather than trying to achieve an overall sound. "We're not trying to be part of anyone else's trend," he claims. According to the band's press release, the result is"... wild psycho-pop... which will spin you into a frenzy." The band plans to release a full al­bum on Susstones Records soon. 
Material Issue's energy on vinyl is definitely carried over into their live performances. Two cuts which stood out during their live performances at the Cabaret Metro last December were "Mary Spins a Rainbow," with its catchy melody and "Chance of a Lifetime." 
Material Issue will be perform­ing tonight at Stepan Center. Tickets are $5, available at The Cellar and at the door, with all proceeds to be donated to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. "The Great Escape '88" provides stu­dents with the chance to hear quality campus bands, as well as to experience Material Issue, a great 11ew band on the Indepen­dent musk scene.

Item, but is complemented by a variety of shell-fish. The steak selection Is standard fair, exclud­ing the appearance of two high­priced lamb-chops with mint 
jelly. The average prices for an entree is about $8, Including potatoe and salad. 
Appetizers are limited to a few basic choices, Including fried and sauteed mushrooms, shrimp cocktail (priced at a little over $5) and breaded oysters. Desserts are also fairly standard, and, according to my waitress, are not made In-house. 
If my meal of trout stuffed with shrimp and crabmeat was any indication, the quality of the food Is very good. The dish was served promptly and was sizzling hot. Smothered in butter, the entree was no dietary delight, but the excellent taste and the healthy portion more than made up for any guilt by association with the meal. 
The quality of the rest of the meal was not up to par with the main dish but was not at all dis­appointing. I tried the fried mushrooms as the appetizer. 
While the serving was large and 
served hot. it was obviously of 
the frozen rather than the fresh variety. The salad with French 
bacon dressing followed. It too was nothing extraordinary but could by no means be called bad. The potatoe fits the same basic description. 
One of the most pleasing aspect of the meal Is the prompt. courteous serving. At­tention was paid to each cus­tomer upon entering the door until the check arrived. Even as the restaurant filled to capacity, my waitress never hesitated to fill water glasses or hustle to meet the demands of all her customers. 
The bar service Is also quick. Although the selection of beer is not the extremely broad (there appeared to be no draft beer, for example), it should serve to meet most before-meal tastes. Bar drinks are also readily avail­able, as patrons ordered anyth­ing from screw-drivers to' mar­garltas. 
Overall, Pat's Pub Is a safe bet for most student diners. With a solid menu, tasty food and ex­cellent service, this restaurant deserves some student attention. 
If you would like to give Pat's Pub a try, the phone number is 259-8282. They take reserva­tions, and by the looks of the crowd last Saturday night, a may be a safe bet to call ahead if you plan on eating there after 7 pm on a weekend night.

ith Viva Hate, Morrissey embarks on a solo career after rising to the top of the 80's ror:k scene with The Smiths. His new album lacks the brilliant guitar work of Joh­hny Marr, but Morrissey's lilting lyrics fill the void. 
MUSIC 

You either love Morrissey's voice or you hate it --there's no middle ground. I find it very relaxing and captivating. Granted his tone is somber and often depressing. but It's ap­propriate for the serious topics with which he deals. 
Morrissey continues to en­hance Intelligent and often Ironic lyrics on Viva Hate with a voice that captures the many shades of despair. Although some of the songs are entranc­Ing. a few may leave you yawning. 
"Suedehead, " the first single released from the album, went straight to the top of the British charts and Is doing well on U.S. college radio stations too. 
Despite the noticeable ab­sence of Marr's catchy guitar licks, Vinl Reilly comes through on a few songs with some original material that distin­guishes this album from all the Smith's work. His guitar ab­solutely screams on "I Don't Mind If You Forget Me," and this song will wake you up If some of the others put you to sleep. 
If you're sick of Morrissey's fear of love, check out "Break Up the Family." He finally seems willing to embrace love: "Oh I'm so glad to grow oldeli' to move away from those younger years! now I'm in love for the first time' and I don't feel bad." 
Although many are moaning and questioning the band's split after 17 classic singles and four gold albums, Morris­sey's solo career Indicates a new era In pop music. A talent such as his still has great po­tential, and although VIva Hate has Its weak spots, It also has some potential classics that es­tablish Morrissey as a prominent solo artist.

Backfield will run aga1n 
By RICK RIETBROCK 
Sports Writer 
It's no secret that Notre 
Dame has a group of 
thoroughbreds coming in next 
fall's group of freshmen, but 
the backfield stable already 
has its share of horses. 
The Irish backfield, often referred to as the Pony Ex­press last season, ranked 14th in the nation in rushing, and nearly everybody who contrib­uted to that standing will be back somewhere. 
Mark Green, who led the team with 861 yards, will most likely be spending most of his time outside at flanker, but still figures to get some rushing op­portunities. 
That leaves the brunt of the tailback duties to Tony Brooks and Ricky Watters, both com­ing off solid freshmen seasons (Brooks 262 yards, 4.9 avg., Watters 373 yards, 5.4 avg.). 
"This spring and the winter workouts have been very good for me," says Brooks. "The big thing it has done is to really help me familiarize myself with the offensive scheme. I'm a lot better prepared. 
"The winter workouts also helped me a lot physically. It's helped my speed, my strength and especially my endurance." 
"They've had very good springs," says Running Backs coach Jim Strong. "They've gotten a chance to get a lot of repetitions and have really im­

proved on the basics. Right now I'd rank it as a dead heat." 
Also running at tailback is Antwon Lark, another fresh­man. Strong says although the position is brimming with tal­ent, that doesn't mean that one of next year's freshmen can't make a contribution. 

"With the schedule we play, before it's done, you're going to need to have three tailbacks who can produce for you," he says. "Last year we used three and if someone steps forward next fall and earns some playing time, he'll get an op­portunity to help us." 
At fullback, Pernell Taylor is gone, but Anthony Johnson (366 yards, 4.7 avg.) and Braxston Banks (212 yards, 3.9 avg.) return as does Joe Jarosz, who has had an impressive spring. 
"Johnson and Banks have done a great job this spring as far as giving a great effort on the field and also assuming a leadership role," Strong says. "They've come to practice and instead of just performing, they've also realized they are the veterans back there even though they'll be just juniors and really set an example." 
"We've been around for two years now," says Johnson. "I think both of us have con-

to help the other guys out since 
we are kind of the old men back 
there. The guys are all really 
hard workers so we have faith 
that they're doing their jobs. 
We just have to work to­
gether." 
Experimentation has been prevalent this spring, and the backfield has had its share. Along with Green's move to flanker, Watters has also run some plays from flanker and Banks has spent some time at tailback. 
"It's always good to have the versatility available if you ever need it," Strong says. "Braxston was a tailback in high school and he could be a good physical runner from that spot. Watters is so explosive, we might want to use that abil­ity a little more in our passing game. We just want to get the right chemistry out there." 
The running game took the limelight last season when Tony Rice and his running style took over at quarterback. Strong says that the running game must be strong no matter who's taking the snaps. 
"We try to build the offense to be successful with whoever's at · quarterback," he says. "We've got to be able to do the job with any quarterback, we can't just change everyone and change the whole offense when we make a quarterback change."

Baseball fans have had a di­

contender. This year is ex­
pected to be no exception. And 
even though the South Bend Sox

Dasso captains women's tennis Track team co'!lp~tes 
By FRANK PASTOR Sports Writer 

Following a successful four­game homestand, the Notre Dame women's tennis team returns to the road one last time this weekend as it squares off against Southern Illinois-Edwardsville and Mankato State. 
The Irish netters (10-13) have been on a tear as of late, taking three of their last four matches, including last weekend's victories over Toledo and Purdue. 
Notre Dame takes to the courts Friday at 3 p.m. to face SIU-Edwardsville (13-4), and then comes back out against Mankato State (2-8) at 9 a.m. Saturday. The team must sweep this weekend's matches if it is to finish the season at the .500 mark. 
As the season concludes for the Irish, the curtain comes down on the collegiate career of senior captain Michelle Dasso. Since her arrival at Notre Dame in 1984, Dasso has played an integral part in the growth and development of the Irish tennis program. 
"Michelle is the team leader for us, " says coach Michele Gelfman. "She has really come a long way in the three years I've been here." 
Dasso first picked up a ten­nis racquet at the age of nine,

The Hoosiers controlled the majority of the offensive action in the second half, but the Irish had chances to win the game late with four corner kicks. 
Indiana took the lead in the first half when junior midfielder Han Roest walked in all alone on the right wing and found freshman forward Ken Snow all alone in front of the net. Snow, the nation's leading scorer in the fall season, deflected the pass into the net at the 31:30 mark. 
The Hoosiers controlled most of the offensive action during the latter part of that first half. Notre Dame finally pushed the ball into its end at the 38: 00 mark, but could not put anyth­ing together.

when her parents signed her _up for a local par~s and recreation program m her hometown of Sunnyside, Washington. As a freshman in high school, Dasso won the Wash­ington state singles title, and was ranked number one in the state. The following year, she moved to California, where she led Miraleste High School to undefeated seasons in 1981 and 1983. The 5-9 senior has gone through a number of adjust­ments and several periods of transition in her four years at Notre Dame. She has seen the tennis program grow from a NCAA Division II program into one that is competitive at the Division I level. "When I came in as a fresh­man, the program was very different, " Dasso recollects. "We were Division II, but we were good. I mean, we were number two in the nation. "The big growth period for me came between my sopho­more and junior years, be­cause that's when I was named captain. A lot of players graduated on the team, and now I was consid­ered the older upperclas­sman." During that critical junior year, Dasso was co-captain along with Tammy Schmidt.

"I was going to have to set more examples (for the younger players)· I think it's really important to have someone on the team who can speak up and be a mediator between the players and the coach." Life on the road is certainly nothing new to Notre Dame's number two singles player. Following a season which in-eluded ten straight matches away from home, it is not surprising that Dasso will once again be packing her bags and heading for Chicago for her first excursion into the business world. Although she is determined to get on with her life, Dasso admits that Notre Dame will always hold a special place in her heart. "Looking back on the four years," reminisces Dasso, "I don't think I'd change anyth­ing. All the sacrifices I made were definitely worth it. "Even though I'm not going to be here next year, I still feel like I can always say that I was a part of that growth period, of that transition, and that's something I will re­member for the rest of my life."·

The Notre Dame track and field team will participate in the Stanford Invitational at Stanford University this weekend. Schools representing the Pac-10, including Washing­ton and San Diego State, will also attend the invitational. 
irish head coach Joe Piane expects his team to rise to the level of competition at the In­vitational, which will feature Andre Phillips, one of the best intermediate hurdlers in the country. 
"As a team, we expect to do well,"Piane said. "One particu­lar event we should do well in is the javelin, featuring fresh­man Ryan Mihalko." 
Other events where the Irish could fare well are the steeplec­base and the 5000-meter run. Freshman Ryan Cahill has already recorded a time of 9:02 in the chase. In the 500Q, Notre Dame will have three con­tenders in senior co-captain Dan Garrett, junior Ron Markezich and sophomore Mike O'Connor. 
Freshman Jeff Smith, who has competed at both long and triple jump this season, will concentrate his efforts on the long jump this weekend. 
One trackster who has shown steady improvement in his per­formance *s freshman high jumper John Cole. Cole, whose best jump in high school was 6'8", has already jumped 6'10 314" in college. He attributes his success to the conditioning pro-
JufieSc 
grams at Notre Dame, which include a fall session. 
"I think the workout pro­grams we follow here are more intense than in high school," Cole stated. 
Cole, who qualified for both the indoor and outdoor IC4A's, hopes to jump seven feet this weekend and for the remainder of the season. 
"Right now, jumping seven feet is a kind of mental block. With the help of Coach Doug Snyder and workout partner 
Rob  Graham,  maybe  I  can  
overcome  it,"  Cole  main­ 
tained.  

You do not have to tell soph­omore pole vaulter Chris Com­ponovo about overcoming ob­stacles. Last year, at the fifth indoor track meet, Componovo broke his leg. This year, he has vaulted 15'3" and has also qualified for the IC4A's. 
"I'm happy with the progress I've made this year, not having jumped in over a year. Yet, I'm hoping to vault 16 feet before the end of the season in May. I've already jumped 15'6" in practice," Componovo said.
