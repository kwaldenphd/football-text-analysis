Students angered by SU handling of ticket lottery for Billy Joel show

Billy Joel might have been flat­tered, but many of his fans almost got flattened at yesterday's ticket lottery, organized by the Concert Commission ofthe Student Union.

Calling for members of the peace weapons is out of date," John Monczunski of Notre Dame Magazine said, adding "nuclear weapons ace a dead end." 


Monczunski, who heads the St. Joseph County Nuclear Freeze Cam­paign, cited a recent Parade magazine article in which scientist Carl Sagan predicted even a small­scale nuclear exchange would release so much soot into the atmos­phere that the temperature of the Northern Hemisphere would drop dramatically. 
Klaus, a German citizen working 
on her master's degree at Notre 
Dame, said the U.S. decision to 
deploy the missiles contradicts the 
will ofthe majority ofpeople in Wes­

"People in Western Europe want peace," and believe the deployment ofthe cruise and Pershing II missiles "will increase the probability that 'The Day After' will one day occur," said Klaus.

Leftover IDs from lottery at Student Union office 
By MARK.WORSCHEH 
News Editor 
Students who did not pick up their ID cards after the Billy joel ticket lottery yesterday can retrieve them at the Student Union secretary's desk, said Ed Konrady, Student Union concert commis­sioner, last night 
The question ofwho will be liable for lost IDs, however, remained unanswered. As the lottery began to break up, several stacks ofIDs could be seen being passed through the crowd. Inside, dozens ofIDs were left on the Ombudsman counter as students attempted to retrieve their own and IDs offriends. 
james McDonnell, director of student activities, said the Student Union should be accountable for the cost ofreplacing any IDs. 
Konrady disagreed, saying, "I don't feel the Student Union should be liable. Ifsomeone put an ID into the barrel, he should have waited until the bitterend. Ifthey gave it to a friend, it's their risk, not ours." 
Nevertheless, Konrady added that the question of liability will 
have to be settled by the union. "I think that's a decision that the 
Student Union members will have to discuss among themselves," he 
said. 
"Whenever we deal with IDs, there is a chance they could be misplaced or taken by someone else. We minimized that as much as 


Start of food sales inspection disputed 
By DAN McCULLOUGH 
SeniorStaffReporter 
The Student Affairs Office and the 
Environmental Health and Safety 
Department have conflicting ac­
counts as to which of the two Uni­
versity offices initiated the recent 
health inspections of dormitory 
food sales. 
Michael McC auslin, Environmen­tal Health and Safety specialist, said yesterday that the investigation was entirely his idea. "The report in­itiated from my office. I initiated the report," he said. "There was no dis­cussion ofthe food sales issue in this office prior to late October." 
FatherJohn Van Wolvlear told The Obseroer Tuesday that problems with food sales conditions were dis­cussed at a meeting over the sum­mer and the group "decided that we've got to inspect them." He said he didn't remember exactly when the meeting took place or who at­tended. 
McCauslin said that he "was not 
aware ofwhat they discussed" at the 
meeting. "I was not there." 
Van Wolvleac said he contacted 
McCauslin concerning the issue af­
ter the summer meeting. 
McCauslin conducted the spot in­spections in November along with Fire Captains Mack Esenwein and Fred Schleiger, and Firefighter Wayne Bishop. 
He said that Van Wolvleac was the only person to receive a copy of his three-page letter which outlined the food sales inspections results. "There was only one copy ofthe let­ter. I have the original and Father Van Wolvlear has the copy," he ex­plained. 
In his letter, McC auslin said, "The health, sanitation, and fire safety conditions found within the residence hall food sales are deplorable." Unsafe food sto rage, improper and infrequent sanitation and waste disposal, and rodent in­festations were among the problems the letter cited. 
The letter went on to recommend limiting food sales to pre-packaged foods and requiring proper training for food sales operators. 
McCauslin said the allegations made by South Bend pizza supplies distributor Martin Milliken, linking University Food Service Director William Hickey with the food sale~ investigation were "absolutely untrue." 
He added that Wednesday's Ob­seroer article that included the al­legations "made it sound like (the 
investigation) was preplanned. That lends itself to a lot of problems in that it almost sounds like I got to­gether with Father Van Wolvleac and we assaulted the problem together. Father Van Wolvleac wasn't even aware ofwhat I was doing." 
Van Wolvleac, however, said the Student Affairs Office did play a role in the investigation. "If something endangers the life or health of our students we (Student Affairs) must respond," he said. 
He added that the Milliken allega­
tions were "a complete fabrication."

tal Health and Safety office is under

Three Saint Mary's students told police they 
were robhed of S56.25 at gunpoint Wednesday night as they walked through the parking lot north of Bridget McGuire's tavern, I025 South Bend Avenue:. The incident occurred at approximately 10:40 'Jl.m. According to Cpl. Doug Way of the South Bend Police Depart­ment. the students, all in their early twenties, were approached by three males, one ofwhom had a gun. The suspects were described as black, approximately 5 feet 7 inches tall and in their late teens. One was wearing a tan jacket with a black hood, another wore a maronn jacket and a third wore a light-colored jacket. -The Observer 
A student at Michigan State University 
was found dead after he apparently fell from a 6-foot homemade loft as he slept in his dorm room. Benjamin Weber, 19, of Mason, Mich., died Saturday afternoon, according to campus security officer Jay Jensen. Results of an autopsy were not immediately available. In response to the death, Dean of Students James Roemer has sent a letter to hall rectors urging them "to be vigilant about enforcing our loft regulations at the very beginning ofthe year but at all other times also." Notre Dame requires lofts to be no higher than seven feet off the floor, and no closer than three feet to the ceiling. A working smoke detector is also required. -The Obseroer

Bye, bye pizza and beer 
Crackdown? 
The thought has been echoing around campus lately 
as more and more student privileges and campus or­
ganizations have been subject to a tightening of con­
trols by the University. 
Perhaps the most blatant case-in-point is the food 
sales controversy between the Office ofStudent Affairs, 
the Campus Environmental Health and Safety Office, 
and the managers of the individual hall food sales. 
Faced with the threat of being closed down by the 
University for recently uncovered safety violations, 
managers of several dorll'\ food sales have questioned 
the motives behind the University-conducted health in­
vestigation. 
"I'd say they're cracking down," Grace Foodsales 
Manager Mike Levchuck said. "As I see it, a foodsales is 
selling and preparing food so they should be subject to 
an inspection. I just think it's peculiar that Leprechaun 
Pizza Company comes in and they're cracking down on 
foodsales." 
Likewise, South Bend piz­
za distributor Martin Mil­
liken has accused University 
Food Services Director Bill 
Hickey of "trying to put all 
the food sales out of the 
business so he can sell his 
own pizzas" through the 
Leprechaun Pizza Company. 
Hickey has responded: "There is no truth to those allegations whatsoever ... there is no plot on our part. Leprechaun Pizza is designed to respond to a stu­dent need and if there is no market for it we'll get out of it." 
Taken by itself, the food sales controversy might not point to a crackdown per se by the . But, from being an isolated incident, it points to a more in­tense, widespread crackdown at Notre Dame. 
Look at the rash of issues relating to University con­trol that have erupted during just the past few months: 
 
The senior privilege of being exempt from final ex­ams is threatened by a University proposal to mandate finals for all seniors. If the proposal passes, accounting students graduating in May will face the compromising siwation of having to take finals at approximately the same time as the CPA exam. 

 
The NO Commission on the Responsible Use ofAl­cohol, under the leadership of Father William Beauc­hamp, is considering eliminating or seriously restricting the use ofalcohol on campus. 

 
The Obsen1er has been ordered to join the Univer­sity's Unit Budget System by Jan. I or face the cutoffof approximately $70,000 in student fees. The move would place all Observer finances in the Administra­

tion's control. 

 The University has refused to release statistical in· formation about Group Health Insurance plans to faculty members who requested it after insurance costs were increased earlier this year. 
In a period of growing liberalization, it appears the University is trying to buck the trend and move toward more centralized control of all departments at Notre Dame. 
What is startling about these developments is that the same recurring motive un­derlies the University's ac­tions: in nearly all areas of the crackdown, the Ad­ministration is concerned with liability. It simply does not want to leave itselfopen for lawsuits as it has in the past. 
Why institute a dry campus? To adhere to the In­
II diana 21 drinking age and avoid liability for the be­havior of drunken students on campus. 
Why bring The Observer under University control? To insure accountability and to keep the paper from printing anything "outrageous," Father Hes­
burgh says, thereby avoiding the possibility of lawsuits cropping up. Why outlaw making pizzas in the dorms? To avoid the chances of being sued for food poisoning , Is it coincidental that the University has decided to tighten its grip in so many areas at the same time? 
Is it coincidental that the crackdown has occurred at the same time that NO i~ t:oncerned with liability in the shadow ofseveral recent lawsuits? 
The University will keep pushing and battering down the hatches of free enterprise if students don't push back. The move toward incorporating all activities on campus under the rigid control of the administration is bound to continue unopposed. 
The administration has been blessed with a docile student body -one which accepts any and all intru­sions on its freedom. 
But, the "lay-back-and-let-it-be" philosophy of stu­dents could break down if the Administration goes too far. It's up to the students to decide if that breaking point has been reached.

service group publicized 
By BUD LUEfJKE 
News Staff 
Informational slide shows will be 
shown next week by the Holy Cross 
Associates in an effort to publicize 
their one year, post-graduate 
program ofChristian service. 
M.]. Murray, who participated in 
the program last year, is coordinat­
ing the presentations. Murray said 
the purpose of the slide shows is 
primarily to generate more 
knowledge of the program in the 
student body. 
Although she said the program has 
no shortage of volunteers, Murray 
indicated she would like to see more 
students considering the Holy Cross 
Associates as an option. "It (the 
program) provides the student with 
a reflection period after college and 
an opportunity to do Christian 
service," she said. 
Murray described her experience 
in the program as remarkably 
"simple." The year involves living as 
a community in a single house with 
five to six persons. Each volunteeer 
works for some social agency, such 
as helping the elderly or a minority 
group, and is paid $5,200 per year 
for his or her services. The low 
wages save the agencies money. 
Members ofeach house pool their 
salaries and use the money to buy 
food, clothing and other items. All 
cooking and household jobs are 
done by the community, · 
The Holy Cross Associates cur­
rently has houses in four cities:

McCauslin, who joined the Health and Safety staff in February, said he has been involved with commercial food occupational safety inspecting, consulting, and designing service equipment for "about six years." 
"Most things we (Health and Safety) do are just done within this office and ·then we deal with the department head whom the problem involved," McCauslin said.

A dance, the Presidential Dinner, and an address by former Notre Dame football star Rocky Bleier highlight activities planned for Junior Parents' Weekend, to be held Feb. 17-19. 
Junior Mike Schmutz, chairman for the weekend's planning commit­tee, announced the schedule for the annual event, commenting that some changes and innovations promise to make the weekend "an event which all juniors can par­ticipate in and enjoy." 
The festivities begin Friday night with a dance in the upstairs con­course and basketball arena of the ACC, featuring a live band, cocktails, and an international food buffet of ethnic hors d'oeuvres. 
Saturday offers a wide range ofac­tivities, beginning with academic presentations by the Colleges ofArts and Letters, Engineering, Science, and Business. A reception im­mediately afterward will provide both students and their parents the opportunity to meet with faculty 
members on an individual basis. 
Performances by the jazz bands and Shenanigans, as well as a showing of the film "Wake Up the Echoes," are scheduled for late after­noon. The entertainment will be followed at 5 p.m. with a Mass in the ACC celebrated by Father Theodore Hesburgh, University president and the annual Presidential Dinner. Throughout the day, the Center for Social Concerns will conduct an open house for juniors and their parents. 
The weekend will conclude on Sunday with a brunch at 10:30 in­stead of the earlier breakfast served in previous years. Former Notre Dame football player and Pittsburgh Steeler Rocky Bleier will be the guest speaker for this event. 
Information concerning hotel 
availability and complete descrip­
tions and schedules for all events 
have been sent to the parents of 
every junior. Total cost for the 
weekend, which includes admission 
for three persons to the dance, 
Presidential Dinner, and brunch, is 
$102.50. 
Reservation deadline is January

SMCgranted unrestricted $5,000 funds 
By MEGAN KOREMAN 
News Staff 
Saint Mary's College has received a S5,000 unrestricted operating grant from Household International, a multi-industry corporation based in Illinois. 
Money from an unrestricted grant is usually put into the Colleg's operating fund rather than designated for any specific purpose, according to the Saint Mary's Development Office. 
In announcing this grant, Donald Clark, president of Household Inter­national, said, "We base this grant on the institution's interest in economic issues. Household's program is designed to support in­stitutions which encourage discus­sion of the principles of a free-market economy consistent with a free society." 
"Programs which support the general concept of the preservation and improvement of a free­enterprise system and the environ­ments in which it operates are also ofinterest to the corporation." 
Saint Mary's is one of 36 private colleges and universities, including Notre Dame, to receive a new un­restricted operating grant from Household International this year. The Prospect, Illinois, based cor­poration has also made 25 ongoing grants to educational institutions this year. 
Besides the unrestricted operat­ing grants, Household's Support for Higher Education program also makes research grants to depart­
ments  specializing  in  finance,  
merchandising,  engineering,  
transportation  and  insurance.  

Household has contibuted more than $3.97 million to American col­leges and universities since the program began in 1956.

mess," ht· said. "A lot of peopk showed up, and peopk were: waiting in line: all day." 
The lout·ry was supposed to begin at 2:~0 p.m., hut the Nazz -in the: hascmt·nt of Lafortune -began to ovt.-rtlow shortly after 2. By 2:30, whl·n the Concert Comission arrived, the Nazz was compktdy packed. ''They pickc:d a table in the: radius of five feet around it, hut there was no way," said Vincent DeMarco. a senior. "Thc:y just came in there with boxes ofenvelopes and a t:ash box. No one really knew how many tickets you could get for each ID," he said. 
The organizers began asking for slllde.Jts to deposit their IDs in a metal trash em. Since many of the students had heard more than one ID t:ould he entered, the can quickly fillt:d. Konrady estimated 1,200 IDs Wl're deposited. 
Konrady ~-oaid he had no choice hut to movt: it outside at that point. "It would have been a good choice in Septembt:r, hut a poor one in November," ht: admitled. The tern· pnature was 26 degrees at j p.m. yesterday. 
Once outside, Konrady and other voluntt:ers began drawing IDs from the can and shouting names of win· ners from tht: steps of the west entrance of!.aFortune to the crowds below, more than 20 persons deep into tht· Main Quad. 
Winners had to make their way to tht· entrance and then take a num· hered envdopt: back to the Nazz to purchase tickets. Each winner could order six tickets. 
Constantly having to ask the 
crowd to move back from the top of 
the stairs was om: problem Konrady 
cited as causing delays in the lottery. 
"At least I 0 times we had to push the 
crowd back," he said. "There was a 
constant parade of people checking 
to sec if their names were called." 
The process lasted until aimost S 
p.m. when a number of students decided to go to dinner; however, many ofthese students had not been able to get their IDs back. Other volunteers then grabbed stacks of IDs and began shouting names to the crowd. Meanwhile, some stacks were passed through thc students themsclvcs. 
At S: IS, Konrady movcd thc can inside LaFortune, and the lobby area took on the appearance of the tloor of thc Ncw York Stock Exchange with five diffcrent persons standing on tables shouting names at one point. 
Konrady announced to the crowd at S:30: "If all you need your IDs for is to eat dinncr, go on ahead. They will let you eat without your IDs tonight." Yet, delays occurred at the North Dining Hall as checkers re­quired students without IDs to fill out chargc slips. The dining hall staff rcportedly told students that they must return with their charge receipts and thcir IDs to avoid get­ting charged. 
As the crowd began to dwindle, the remd.ining IDs were spread out over the Ombudsman counter. At S:45, more than 150 IDs remained unclaimed. Tom McCabe, a fresh­man still looking for his ID, com­mented, "You would think they would know from the past. Don't they care? There should be some other systcm." 
McDonnell termed the confusion of the lottery "horrible;" however, he could not recommend any soiu· tions to the problem. "Students can easily work it out. I don't think its my job to determine how to run a lot· tcry. Students should be able to do that," he said. 
Konrady said he was "willing to take suggestions" as to the best way to run the next lottery.

The need for collective bargaining

They are though a small price to pay for the The bargaining process, since it allows benefits we all enjoy from collective bargain­groups to solve problem!> on their own, is very ing as a whole. The collective bargaining sys­consistem with our idcWi of personal and tem helps distribute income and power in eomomic freedom. 

As the Greyhound strike enters its fourth week with few signs of settlement in the near future, the public eye is again jolted toward that mysterious process called coUective bargaining. 
l\1ichael Skelly Back again 
-------------------------~ 
Wht·never we experience strikes that have such :m immediate impact on the public, (Greyhound carrkd S 7 million passengers last year) questions inevitably arise about the workability ofour systems of resolving labor­management contlict. 
And this will no doubt be inueasingly the GISt' in the near future as unions struggle for their shart·s of tht· ocndits from th1.: current economic upturn. 
What is often ovt·rlooked however is the remarkable success that our system of col­lective bargaining at:hit"vcs in resolving the in­tvitablc contlicts in industrial relations. Moreovt·r the bend1ts reapt·d by the general public from such contlicts, including strikes, goes virtually unnotin·d. 
To appreciate just how we benefit from the usually qukt collt·ctive bargaining process, in which tht· two private partks of labor and management sit down collectively and work out their dift(:rences, it is worthwhile to con­sidt'r the alternatives to our current system. 
One alternative is a binding decision by a third party, usually a governmental one. The disadvantage here is that when a outside party makes wage and policy decisions, neither party is likely to be satisfied. 
But when unions and management sit down privately and work out disagreements themselves, and freely agree to the final outcome, the likelihood of dissatisfaction is greatly diminished. 
Another means of settling inevitable con­flicts would be for the government to take control ofthe economy and decide politically who gets what. This, needless to say, is ex­tJ:emely unlikely, at least in this country. 
Others have gone so far as to say that unions should be scrapped altogether, that they have somehow outlived their usefulness. This argu­ment seems naive at best and dangerous at worst. One need only look at those countries where unions arc illegal to realize why workers must have a check to place upon the often overwhelming power of their employers. 
We must remember that the process ofcol­lective bargaining is not an exercise in pure reason, it is rather the interaction ofeconomic power. For this reason, outcomes are not al­ways as fair or as efficient as possible. Un­economic work practices and blatant exploitation alike are sometimes the result. 
Strikes too are part of the price we pay for free collective bargaining. Despite the heavy publicity they often receive, strikes are still relatively rare. Last year less than one fifth of one percent of working days were lost to strikes. 
Though they often do represent an incon­venience to the public, such as the Greyhound strike, they are an integral part of the bargaining process. For without strikes or

Why the rush? 
Dear Editor: 

Tht· llnivcrsity committee appointed by the Provost to study the subject of final exams rnTntly brought thdr recommendations to the Academic Council, and hoped to have their proposals voted on that aftt·rnoon. Luck­ily, tnough faculty members and students urgt·d for a postponement of that vote until they could discuss the matter further. To ap­provt· the plan as it presently exists would be highly dt·trimt·ntal to every undergraduate studt·nt at Notrt· Dame. 
Tht· most glaring omission in tht' commit­
tee's rtport is tht· absence of any student 
vkwpoint. Many important issues connet·ted 
with final examinations are never mentioned, 
and in othn cases are not givt·n sufficient at­
tention. 

Tht· proposal as it now stands would mandate that all final exams be cumulative, two-hour tests worth no more than two­thirds, hut no kss than one-third ofa student's final gradt·. At tht· same time, however, the limit on the numbt·r ofexams per day, and tht· numhn ofstudy days would not change. 
This means that a student could have three exams in a .24 hour period (or four in a 26 hour period), a!l of which would cover all courst· material and count as 6 7 percent of final grades in those classes. Such a systt·m is, quite bluntly, wholly absurd. 
Tht· ont· study day which now exists is high­ly insufficient, and to weigh finals more would make mattt-rs even worse. 'While looking at how to make finals more important, many of the problems li1r students resulting from the propost·d changt·s were ignored. 
( :onsidt-ring that the new regulations would not go into effect until the next academic year, there is no need to hastily rush this issue through. With a little cooperation, an equitable and effective system for final ex­ams could he devised using administrative, faculty anti s<udcnt input. To make any com­mitments without further discussion would be highly regrettable and a great mistake.

Dear Editor: 
The University of Notre Dame students are affiliated with numerous human rights groups. The students concern themselves with issues in Central America, South Afrk:a, Poland and many other faraway places. World-wide inter­est in basic human liberties and rights is very charitable and conscientious of our students, but there are ample opportunities for charity to begin at home. 
I refer to the multi,minority and non­minority work force here on campus, par­ticularly at the North Dining Hall. Last week, five full-time employees, with combined service of over fifty years, were fired. There were no explanations given, only a faint rumor of an interpersonnd incident which occured six months ago and involved just two of the five fired workers. 
Last week when Director of Food Services, Mr. William Hickey, announced that three managers and two pantry workers were fired, it was stated that the University would tolerate neither racism nor unionism. 
At the North Dining Hall, the "upfront jobs like managing and serving food belong primarily to whites, while the "behind-the­sccnes" jobs like dean-up and pantry work

belong mostly to the non-white minorities, Orientals, Blacks and Hispanics. Food Services style of staff placement promotes racism, and the University will therefore continue to tolerate racism. 
As for unionism, perhaps the University will have to tolerate it; the present worker­employer relationship apparently provides little or no job security. 
This is our campus. Before we preach about how things should be elsewhere, perhaps we should make things that way here. 
Patricia Smith 
Campus liberals 
DearEditor: 
Despite how free-thinking and independent 
we college students claim to be, we are still 
very impressionable. I know several students 
here at Notre Dame who feel obligated to 
protest anything even slightly controversial. 
The day of the Captain Crunch eating con­test, I saw several students parading about with Captain Crunch-Wl.ry? posters on their backs. Fine. But when I see the same people distributing posters decrying U.S. involve­ment in Grenada a few days later, I begin to wonder. 
Are these true feelings, or merely the manifestation of some urge to continually question and complain without thinking of real solutions or causes? 
Many of our peers approach the nuclear arms issue in the same manner. How many stu­dents across the nation have hopped onto the nuclear freeze bandwagon without really un­derstanding what they are doing? These days it is the in thing to be nuclearly aware. 
Armed with facts, figures and destructive radii data, our nuclear freeze mongers unfor­
tunately disregard or do not care to discuss 
the r.:asons we have nuclear arms. They decry 
the effect, not the cause. How many know the 
hisrory of why wars start? How many care to 
research the roots of conflict, i.e. injustice, 
subjugation, elimination ofpersonal freedoms 
and the like. 
It is the t:al>'}' way out (and the intellectually 
lazy route) to look at all of our world 
problems and load them onto the nuclear 
scapegoat. Ideas like Nuclear Teach-Ins and 
Nuclear Arms Symposiums arc good, but we 
had better understand the roots of conflict 
before we try to treat their effects -i.e. 
nuclear weapons. 
Obviously nuclear weapons are a problem 
today. nut if we attempt to solve the problem 
without understanding the causes we will end 
up worse off. I am not saying that the nuclear 
freeze movement is wrong; rather, I challenge 
students to hink the issue through from top 
to bottom before forming an opinion. Don't 
feel pressured to join the nuclear freeze 
movement just because it is in vogue. Under­
stand what you are arguing for. 
For a student to blindly follow what the 
freeze fathers dictate is a<> had as a soldier 
blindly obeying the orders of a military dic­
tator.

St. Peter's upsets Michigan State 
River from New York City in Jersey

._----------------------.JCity. 
Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -St. Peter's basketball Coach Bob Dukiet says the last two minutes of the un­ranked and unheralded Peacocks' 
stunning  73-66  victory  last  night  
over  I 1 th-ranked  Michigan  State  
"was like an eternity."  

In the second game of the doubleheader at Brendan Byrne Arena, Tony Campbell scored 23 points and had nine rebounds to lead Ohio State, 2-0, to a 72-68 upset of No. 6 Maryland, 1-1. 
Center Tommy Best scored 22 points and forward Shelton Gibbs fired in 20, including two crucial free throws with 35 seconds to play, as St. Peter's held on after seeing an 18-point first-half lead dwindle to three points. 
"It's a scary feeling," Dukiet said. "You hate to see a game go out from under you when you've been in con­trol so long." 
Michigan State, 2-1, stormed back from a 26-8 first-half deficit to pull to within 64-61 on Sam Vincent's two free throws with 36 seconds to play. 
But Gibbs coolly sank two free throws after a two-shot technical foul was called on Michigan State's Darryl Johnson for deliberately grabbing St. Peter's Bernard Hargrove on the inbounds play after Vincent's two foul shots. 
The dead-ball technical foul was called because Referee Tim Higgins said Johnson was trying to foul Hargrove before St. Peter's Phil jamison was given possession ofthe ball to make an inbounds pass. 
"It's the worst rule I've ever been associated with in basketball," said Michigan State Coach Jud Heathcote. johnson would have been allowed to intentionally foul Hargrove ifSt. Peters had possession ofthe ball. Hargrove was fouled four 
times in a 1 :30 span leading up to the technical foul. 
After Gibbs' two free throws, Nor­man Luckett converted a layup to give St. Peter's a 68-61 lead with 30 seconds to play. 
"I think we lost the game in the first I 0 minutes. Their overplaying, aggressive defense really bothered us. I take nothing away from them. I give them credit," Heathcote said. 
"It was a wild and crazy game," said Dukiet, fifth-year coach at the tinyJesuit school across the Hudson 
"We knew they weren't going to quit and give up a victory," Best said. "In the final minutes it was flowing in my mind the possibility that this one would get away. But I had con­fidence in our guys." 
St. Peter's, 2-0, saw its 18-point lead whittled to 28-21 at halftime, but built it to 17 twice in the second half before Vincent triggered the comeback. 
Vincent, whose older brother,Jay, plays for the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association, keyed the comeback with 25 of his game-high 30 points in the second half. Vincent had 13 points in the final two minutes ofplay. 
St. Peter's took an early 9-0 lead and steadily built it to 26-8 behind

36 slaughter of Hawaii Pacific, by 
putting in 15. 
The other person that will be looked to for scoring is 6-1 junior forward Char jones. jones was one of two players to average in double figures last year ( 14.2 ppg) and also was second on the team in rebound­ing (7.9 rpg).Jones, who also scored 15 against Hawaii Pacific, will have to pick up a lot of the slack after the departure ofThompson andJoyner. 
She will get some rebounding help from three newcomers on the front line. Van Helvoort, Keur, and 6-0 freshman forward Mary Madigan, who pulled down nine rebounds against Hawaii, will provide some strength as will two other freshmen, Shari Biggs and Tia Francis. 
In all, UCLA features a lineup that includes seven players that are 6-0 or taller as well as some talented outside shooters. 
"They're a more disciplined team than they were last year," explains D t iStanislao. "They are very well­rounded. They have a more potent inside game and have some very good shooters in Char Jones and Anne Dean." 
DiStanislao is confident that her team has improved to the point where it will no longer be vul­nerable to fast teams like UCLA. Last year the Bruins ran right past the Irish, resulting in games with scores the 6-foot-6 Best's I 1 points. Best, who played the game with a swollen left eye he sustained in a season­opening victory over Muhlenberg, converted 12 of I 8 free throws. 
Michigan State, which went al­most six minutes without scoring and struggled to connect for nearly 1 5 minutes, got back into the game with an 11-0 burst. 
The Spartans, who played without injured 7-foot center Kevin Willis and used three guards for most of the first half after 6-foot-9 starter Richard Mudd picked up his third personal foul in the game's first five minutes, began their rally after Gibbs went to the bench with his third personal foul. 
  Women 
of82-54 and 84-53. This year should 
be a different story. 
"Last year, we played them in our first game of the year, and we were not prepared, and they were in great shape," says DiStanislao. "In the second game, they caught us at a down time." 
"The main reason we had trouble 
with them, though, was that they 
played to our weakness -our 
transition game. We were not able to 
hit the boards very well, and we 
were handily outrebounded. I 
would hope that we have solved that 
this year." 
The Irish will need a strong per­formance from the people inside. In both games in the Notre Dame Clas­sic, Notre Dame was hurt by the inside play on both ends of the court. Especially important is get­ting a strong game from center Mary Beth Schueth. Schueth, who has been the team's leading scorer and rebounder the last two years, was held to just one point and one rebound against Maryland, her poorest performance ofher career. 
Also important will be the play of freshman point guard Vonnie Thompson who has been a bright spot so far this year. It will be her job to run an offense that has relied mostly on outside shooting this season. Unless there is some more scoring from the center and for­wards tomorrow, things may not turn out too well for the Irish.

Don't let the modesty of this electric backcourt player fool you. He has a wide range oftalents. 
"Scott Hicks is a guard that's got good potential," says Phelps. "I think that he handles the ball very well in transition and he's a better shooter than people think. Plus he's very creative with the ball. 
"He is not john Paxson, but he's the guard we wanted 
, to come in here. I don't think it's fair to compare Scott Hicks with John Paxson because of what John Paxson was as a senior. Hicks is only a freshman -but he's going to be a very good guard." Hicks is now making the adjustment to guard after having played small forward at Cathedral, where he averaged 20.4 points, 10 rebounds, and 3.4 steals per game as a senior. Hicks became Cathedral's all-time leading scorer by shooting 50 percent from the field and 69 percent from the free-throw line during his senior campaign. Named to the prep all-America teams ofParade, Bas­ketball Weekly, Scholastic Coacb/Adidas, and the Na­tional High School Athletic Coaches Association/Converse during his senior year, Hicks led C<Jthedral to a 20-3 record. ! ' -ks was one of the nation's early signees in the ini­tial year ofthat option for high school seniors. His deci­sion to attend Notre Dame was based to a some degree on its proximity to his Indianapolis home. "I just wanted to stay close to home," says Hicks. "I was also turned on by the academics and the tradition." Hicks may also have been influenced in his decision by the Irish sophomore Barlow. "We've been good friends for about six years," says Barlow. "I just told him (Hicks) that Notre Dame was a nice place, that I enjoyed it here, and that I thought he could handle the academics." ­At the moment, Hicks is playing the role of the off­guard in the Phelps' offense. "He's a second guard," says Phelps. "I don't think that he's a point guard." "So far, Digger has made my role out to be one ofall shooting," adds Hicks. 
-· 

Another freshman who will counted on to do his share ofshooting in the future is 6-7, 205-pound Donald Royal. The product ofSt. Augustine High School in New Orleans, Louis., has front-line quickness that every team is looking for. 
"Donald is a quick front-line player that gives us somebody who is going to be a good defensive player," assesses Phelps. "And he is somebody who's very quick going to the hole offensively. He's going to be a good rebounder and he's going to be a good shooter in time," continues Phelps. "He's not a good shooter right now but we're working on that." 

Tom Sluby 
Irish captain 
   Freshmen 
Royal was not that much of a scorer in high school, averaging 12.7 points. But maybe it was his 14.2 rebounds or 4.3 assists per game that were more impor­tant as he led St. Augustine to a 35-0 record and the Louisiana state championship in his senior season. 
Phelps sees more in Royal than pure statistics, though. "I just like the way he plays the game," says the Irish coach. "He's an athlete. He knows how to play bas­ketball." 
Royal also knows that there is much for him to work 
on in the years ahead at Notre Dame. 
"I've got to learn to face the basket. I'm used to playing with my my back to it. But everything will take care of itself. I just want to come in this year and con­tribute, to give the team whatever it takes to win." 
There should be no shortage of playing time for Royal, or any of the other freshmen, to work on their game. 
"We're a young team," comments Phelps. "They need to get playing time." 
Joking on the relative youth of his team, Phelps quipped, "You know, Royal won't be 18 until May so he doesn't even wear a jock. He's still in diapers." 
Royal, in fact, mentions that the chance for playing 
time was a part in his decision to attend Notre Dame. 
"It came down to Notre Dame and UCLA. I chose 
Notre Dame because the academics were stressed more 
and there would be more playing opportunity." 
 
Like Scott Hicks, fellow freshman John Bowen also 
announced his decision to play basketball for Notre 
Dame early. For Bowen, the decision had been made a 
long time ago. "Basically, I always wanted to come here 
since I was a little boy. The mystique, tradition, the per­
centage ofballplayers who go on, all turned me on. I just 
had a real good feeling." 
Bowen is much like Irish sophomore Tim Kempton 
in his style of play. He hits the boards hard and is not 
afraid to shoot. In fact, Bowen is unofficially the top 
rebounder in Pennsylvania high school history, with 
2,163 for a 19.1 average. 
His 21.1 points and 19.2 rebounds per game as a senior aided Warren Area High School in Warren, Penn., to a 29-3 record and gave Bowen a spot on the all­America team ofBasketball Weekly and all-state honors for the second straight year. 
As with most freshman players, Bowen has a number 
ofthings he must work on. For one, he has played zone 
defense throughout his entire career and now must ad­
just to the man-to-man that the Irish play. 
"I just want to get the system and get used to a new 
coach this year," says Bowen. "I'll just help out in any 
situation the team may need me -make a rebound, 
make a shot, just whatever." 
Bowen is a better outside shooter than many people 
think. His left-handed shot is unique to this year's Irish 
squad. 
"I think that he's a good outside shooter," says Phelps, "and he's going to learn the finesse as time goes on. He's going to bang some people around and still score points for us." 
The high point of Bowen's career thus far appears to be his 14 points in Notre Dame's 104-56 win over St. Joseph's (Ind.). Other than that game, Bowen's playing time this season has been somewhat limited. 

Tim Kempton 
Irish forward/center 
Limited playing time during one's freshman year is nothing to be alarmed about, however, at least according to Phelps. "I told them in recruiting not to put everything in their first year. It's going to be a four year process for you. But each year you're going to see us get better." 
"I think that they're three talented people," Phelps continues. "I wouldn't have them here ifl didn't think they had potential. "Right now there's no Paxsons, there's no Tripuckas, there's no Woolridges. All you're looking at is a bunch ofguys who want to win." 
Four or five years down the road, Phelps may well be mentioning the fact that there are no Hickses, Royals, or Bo:wens on his team that year. Whether these three are deserving ofsuch merit at that time is something that everyone will have to'wait to find out. After all, Pax­son, Tripucka, and Woolridge all were unknown and untested fresh­men at one time in their career. 
Everything these three freshmen ofthe class of'87 have done in 
the past will do little in making a name for them. Now is the time to 
do that. The ball is in their court.

''I'm still not sure we have the over­
all quickness to go up and down the 
floor with them," states Phelps, "but 
at least we can match up with them 
in that area a little better than we 
have in the past." 
That quickness will be sorely needed when trying to match up with UCLA's lightning-quick guards, Ralph Jackson and Mantel Hatcher. Jackson, the Bruin captain, had two big games against the Irish a year ago, winning the first game on a layup with three seconds left and scoring a total of 24 points in the home-and-home series last season. His running mate in the backcourt 
is heralded freshman Hatcher. 
Hatcher, who according to Farmer 
"promises to be one of the more 
exciting players we've had at UCLA 
in a long time," has shown outstand­
ing range from the outside, averag­
ing 9.5 points per game. "Hatcher 
definitely makes it easier for them to 
survive losing (Rod) Foster and 
(Michael) Holton," notes Phelps. 
The Irish will be trying to catch up 
some lost ground in this eventful 
series, as they trail UCLA 20-11 over­
all. But no matter what happens in 
tomorrow's nationally-televised en­
counter, fans can expect more than 
"just another game."

Undefeated record on line 
Hockey team goes to St. Norbert's NFL 
By ED DOMANSKY 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame hockey team is on the road again this weekend. Af­ter a successful non-conference sweep last weekend at the Univer­sity ofMichigan-Dearborn, the team resumes Central States Collegiate Hockey League action as it faces St. Norbert's. 
Located in De Pere, Wisconsin, a small community just south of Green Bay, St. Norbert's is expected to be one of the more challenging opponents on the league slate. 
St. Norbert's coach Hank Therrien is a former professional hockey player. He never made it to the Na­tional Hockey League, but he did play with the Ft. Wayne Komets of 
the  International  Hockey  League  
and  the  Hershey  Bears  of  the  
American Hockey League.  

"Because of their coach's ex­perience, we are expecting them to be well-prepared," says Irish coach Lefty Smith. "We don't think it will be our top competition, but it should be interesting." 
As happens when dealing with most club programs, it is difficult to obtain accurate reports about an op-

ponent's strengths and weaknesses. The best analysis usually comes when the games are actually played. 
St. Norbert's currently sports a 2­5-1 record, while Notre Dame main­tains an impressive 9-0-0 overall mark. 
With things going as well as they have so far this season, team attitude is one factor that must be watched closely. Smith feels, however, that his players are thinking along the right lines. 
"Their attitude is really excel­lent," says the Irish mentor. "Had we not faced St. Thomas and Michigan­Dearborn, though, we might have had a little problem. But winning all four against the good competition brings in the prospect of going un­defeated." 
And Notre Dame's junior co­captain Brent Chapman believes that his teammates are maintaining the proper mental motivation to continue their success. "We want to keep undefeated," he says. "We've been told that we've faced our stif­fest competition. St. Norbert's probably isn't as good as St. Thomas or Dearborn, but if you want to stay undefeated, you've always got to be prepared." 
"If we keep thinking and playing like we are now, we'll do really well," adds junior forward Steve Ely. "Avoiding injuries, however, will be an important factor as well." 
Injuries will not be a problem for the Irish this weekend, though. Everyone should be ready to play. Sophomore defenseman Bob Thebeau had the flu and missed several workouts earlier in the week. But he is expected to be back at playing strength for this weekend's series. 
In the scoring department, Chap­man contint,~es to reign as the team's top scorer. His hat trick last weekend at Dearborn was his second ofthe season. He now has 28 points on 12 goals and 16 assists. 
After his two goals and three as­sists last weekend, junior Tim Reilly moved into a tie with three other players for second on the scoring chart. He now has four goals and 12 assists. The other players currently tied with 16 points are Thebeau and seniors Mike Metzler and Adam Par­sons. 
Freshman Tim Lukenda, the team's number one goaltender who was in the nets at Dearborn a week ago, will get this weekend off. He now has a 6-0-0 record. 
The netminding chores on Friday will rest with sophomore Marc Guay. On Saturday, Smith plans to go with junior AI Haverkamp. 
IRISH ITEMS-The current Notre Dame winning streak is now the longest string ofconsecutive vic­tories in the modern era at Notre Dame. Last weekend's sweep enabled the team to surpass the pre­vious record of seven set from February 1 7 to March 8, 1973. The Irish need just five more victories to break the record for consecutive games without a loss . . . . Smith's career coaching record now stands at 261-258-27.

The Observer Friday, December 2, 1983-page 13 Su~stitutes doing well 
Wrestlers winning despite injuries 
ByJOE BRUNETI'I 
Sports Writer 
Inexperience creates doubt in people, and many times inex­perience dispels these doubts. Such was the case in the Notre Dame 
wrestling team's first two triangular meets ofthe 1983-84 season. 
Because ofinjuries and the flu, the Irish used a substitute lineup consisting of many inexperienced wrestlers to win their first two tri­
meets. 
On Wednesday, November 23, 
while most students were either at 
home or going home for break, the 
wrestling team competed in a meet 
in Michigan against Olivet and Siena 
Heights. The Irish prevailed beating, 
Siena Heights, 27-17, and squeeking 
by Olivet, 21-18. 
Against Siena Heights, Notre Dame relied on its lightweight wrestlers to provide an early lead. Siena Heights' strength showed in the heavier classes, but the strength of Notre Dame's heavyweights was enough to hold off Siena Heights. 
The competition against Olivet proved to be more exciting as indi­cated by the closeness of the score. Louis Carnesale, a 5-8 junior, led the Irish by pinning his opponent and providing six team points. Freshman Greg Fleming was also impressive, winning a major decision and collecting four team points for Notre Dame. Because of injuries to both wrestlers in the 190-pound class, Dave Helmer had to wrestle at 
190. Helmer, who usually wrestles in the I77 division, was able to tie his opponent, providing two more crucial team points. The Irish won the match by a three-point marg1.n instead of two because the referee deducted one point from the Olivet team score for unsportsmanlike con­duct. 
"Our young guys and our sub­stitutes did a great job for us, and I'm glad we won," commented Coach BrotherJoseph Bruno, C.S.C., "but I don't wanrto wrestle like that again because our competition is getting progressively tougher." 
At 8 a.m. yesterday, the wrestling 
team returned to South Bend with 
two more victories under their belt. 
This time the victims of the Irish 
were Western Illinois and Millikin. 
This time the results were not nearly 
as close as Notre Dame clobbered 
Western Illinois, 34-6, and Millikin, 
47-3.

Irish swimmers start season successfully 
By LARRY BURKE 
Sports Writer 
The swimming season at Notre Dame got off to an impressive start last night, as the Irish women's swim 
team  defeated  the  Hornets  of  
Kalamazoo  69·43,  at  the  Rockne  
Memorial Pool.  

The men's team also opens its season this week, in the 19th Annual Notre Dame Swimming Relays, which take place tonight at 7 p.m. at the Rockne Pool. 
Dennis Stark, coach of both the men's and women's teams, was decidedly pleased with the women's performance last night. Besides being an important confidence· building win for the team, Stark pointed out that the team's effort answered a lot of questions about the depth of this year's Irish women's squad. 
"This being our first meet, we went into it sort of blind," noted Stark. "The fact that we had a solid lead at the halfway point enabled us to change our lineup a bit and get a look at some untested people. It's very early in the season to say, but I believe that, overall, this team has more depth than last year's." 
Last year's women's team posted a 7·4 record in only its second season of varsity competition. This year, Stark has eight monogram winners returning, who, along with· some talented newcomers, form the nucleus of a potentially outstanding team. 
It was an all-around team victory for the women last night, as fifteen different swimmers placed in the in­dividual events for the Irish. On the strength of a convincing victory in the first event, the 200-yard relay, tht· Irish took an early lead in the meet, which they never relin­quished. 
The winning relay team, consist­ing ofseniors Raili Tikka, who is one of tht co-captains, and Karen Bobear, along with sophomore Julia Boss and freshman Suzanne Devine, was a typical example of the com­bination of youth and experience that Stark hopes will make the 
women successful this season. 
Tikka ( I 00-yard backstroke), Boss ('50-yard freestyle), and Devine ( 200-yard freestyle) also went on to win individual events. Also out­standing for the Irish were junior Colleen Carey, who won the 100­yard freestyle event and anchored the winning 400-yard freestyle relay team, sophomore Joan Burke, who won the '500-yard freestyle event and placed second in the 1000-yard freestyle, and freshman Monica Walker, who finished first in the 200-yard individual medley. 
It should prove to be a busy weekend for Stark, who, in addition to the women's next meet against Western Ontario on Saturday morn­ing ( I 0 a.m. at Rockne Pool), opens his 26th season as Notre Dame men's swimming coach tonight in the Notre Dame Relays. Also competing in this annual event are Wabash, Wayne State, and Xavier. The men also have a meet with Western Ontario on Saturday, at I p.m. at the Rockne Pool. 
As far as the men's team is con­cerned, Stark is looking for a sig­nificant contribution from the newcomers because of the loss of eight seniors to graduation. Leading this year's team will be senior co­captains Daniel Flynn and AI Har­ding. Flynn holds the varsity record in the 200-yard butterfly, and Har­ding holds five freestyle records. 


Stark is also looking for major con­tributions from senior freestylers Daniel Carey, William Green, and Timothy Jacob. The Irish have ex­perience and talent in the other major strokes as well, with juniors Paul Benz (backstroke), Brian Casey (butterfly), and sophomore Blaise Harding (breaststroke). Stark also has two experienced divers in juniors Richard Yohan and Michael Kennedy. The team will need solid 
contributions from leading fresh­men prospects Stephen Coffey, John Harding, and MarkJensen, however, in order to improve on last season's 9·4 record. 
Overall, the outlook appears 
bright  for  Irish  swimming  this  
season.  With  the  experience  and  
leadership  ability  of  Stark,  and  

plenty of talent on both squads, this should be a big year for swimming at Notre Dame.

It's youth against expenence as ND battles highly-ranked UCLA 
By CHUCK FREEBY 
Sports Writer 
To say UCLA-Notre Dame is just another basketball game would be like saying World War II was just an­other skirmish, Christie Brinkley is just another woman, and a Rolls Royce is just another car. L.ct there be no doubt about the matter ­when these two titans collide tomorrow afternoon at 2 p.m. under the South Dome of the ACC before a capacity nowd and national televi­sion audience, it will be a big game for both teams. 
These arc two teams with some­thing to prove. For Digger Phelps and the 2-I Fighting Irish, a victory over the Bruins would erase the painful memories ofa dismal perfor­mant·e against Indiana t on Tuesday night, as well as serve notice to the NCAA selection committee that the Notre Dame is a tournament conten­dt:r. Mt:anwhilc, Larry Farmer's 2-0 Bruins want to show the nation they arc one of the top squads in the na­tion this season, and deserve a high­er ranking than tht: ninth-place slot bestowed upon them this week b}' 
The Associated Press. 
Phelps concurs that this is a key game for both clubs. "Year in and year out, the UCLA game is a benchmark for us," notes Phelps. "We point for tht·m and they point for us, and that's what makes it spe­cial. They've beaten us six straight times, so maybe we're due." 
If the Irish are to snap the Bruin string tomorrow, they'll need anoth­er fine game from team captain Tom Sluby. The 6-4 swingman from the nation's capital leads the Irish in scoring with a I 5.7 points per game average, and he has scored most of those points on outside jumpers. Despite an erratic second half against Marist last weekend, Sluby is still connecting on 61 percent of his shots from the fioor. 

While the Irish look to Sluby, UCLA will rely on 6-7 all-America candidate Kenny Fields to shoulder most of the scoring burden. Last year's Pac-1 0 player of the year, Fields is netting 12.5 points per con­test, scoring with a soft jumper and a strong inside game. He has earned the respect of Phelps, who says "Fields is as good a player as there is in the nation." 
However, both teams will need support from the other folks on the court. "We don't have a superstar, but we've got a lot of people who will contribute," comments Phelps. 
One of those players is sopho­more forward Jim Dolan, who averages 12.3 points per game. Dolan leads the inside game, which has disappointed many Irish fans in the first three contests. Tim Kempton and Ken Barlow, Notre Dame's twin towers, need to in­crease their offensive production in order for t the Irish to challenge the powerful Bruins. 
However, the front line can t not concentrate solely on offense. UCLA also has some big men who can put the ball through the hoop. 7-0 junior center Stuart Gray continues to im­prove in his consistency. Gray is averaging 10.5 points per game, while pacing the Bruins in rebound­ing at nine caroms a contest. Phelps sees Gray as a key factor in tomor­row's matchup. 
"So much will depend on how well Stuart Gray handles himself inside," says the veteran Irish men­tor. "When he plays well in terms of scoring and rebounding, he can make UCLA a great team. Kempton played well against him last year, but this is another season." 
Should Gray falter, the Bruins will turn to their "super-sub," Gary Maloncon. Maloncon came off the bench in UCLA's 85-58 opening win over Idaho State to pace the team with a career-high 16 points and eight rebounds. He's a physical player who won't be afraid to mix it up under the basket with Notre Dame's big men. 
While the "aircraft carriers" will 
provide fans with plenty of action, 
the backcourt matchups could 
prove to be the most exciting. Both 
teams have plenty of quickness at 
the guard slots, and the tempo ofthis 
game could be extremely rapid. 
For the Irish, flashy freshman 
guard Scott Hicks leads the Notre 
Dame backcourt crew with 12 
points an outing, and he also leads 
th e team in steals with seven. He 
receives scoring support from 6-5 
sophomoreJoseph Price, who pours 
home 1 I points per contest. At the 
point guard slot, sophomore JoJo 
Buchanan and junior Dan Duff have 
split the task ofdirecting Phelps' full­
court press on defense and run-and­
shoot philosophy on offense. 
The new quickness in the 
backcourt pleases Phelps as he tries 
to matchup with the blazing Bruins.

The Freshmen 
Hicks, Royal, and Bowen will play big role in '83-'84 
ByJEFF BLUMB 
AssistantSportsEdttor 
"Depth" is the key word when summing up what this year's crop offreshman will bring to the 1983-84 Notre Dame basketball team. The three freshmen players, Scott Hicks, Donald Royal, andJohn Bowen, add to the core ofa relatively young, but experienced, team. 
In recruitingthis year'sclass, Irish head coach Digger Phelps came up with a second guard in Hicks, a quick forward in Royal, and a rock­'em-sock-'em type front liner in Bowen. Although Phelps lost prize prospect Dave Popson to North Carolina, he seems to be satisfied with his new additions to the Irish squad. 
''I'm happy that we have depth," says Phelps. "Ifanything, the freshmen give us the depth we haven't had for a while. Now we're so competitive in practice, and that's very, very good for us. Ifyou don't work, you sit." 
The class of'87 is also Chapter Two ofthe four good recruiting years that Phelps hopes to put back-to-back. Puttingfour good years together would likely give Notre Dame the power status in college basketball that they lost two years ago with their I 0-1 7 season. 
"What I'm looking to do is get three good classes back-to-back and then start on the fourth class," Phelps says. "Once you get four classes back-to-back, I think you're there. The year we got to the Final Four in '78, we had four (good) classes." 
Phelps has already signed four fine players for next year, so he has essentially completed stage three ofhis plan. 
When those four arrive on the scene next year, they will meet up with some experienced sophomores. Hicks, Royal, and Bowen all should see considerable playing time this year. 
"We're a young team so we're going to get these guys playing time," says Phelps in reference to the freshmen. "And they're going to grow from their mistakes." 
The freshman who has seen perhaps the most duty so far in this young season is the 6-3, 180-pound Hicks. Making his Notre Dame debut Nov. 16 against the Yugoslavian Nationals, the native ofIn­dianapolis, lnd, delighted the Irish crowd with his 20 points and five rebounds, leading the team in scoring and being its third-best rebounder that night. 
The fact that Hicks does so well in the rebounding department despite his smaller stature is really no surprise. He pos.'iCsses excep­tional jumping ability, as evidenced by the fact that he led his high school team, Indianapolis Cathedral, in rebounding during both his junior and senior years. And Hicks did this despite being flanked by taller teammates, one ofthose being current Irish mate Ken Barlow. 
"I think that my biggest strength is my ability to jumpquick," says Hicks, "but I need to work on my backcourt game a little more be­cause I played forward in high schooL"

"It's a sign ofa good team to profit from its setbacks," says DiStanislao. "The more time we can put between us and last week the better." 
"The team's been playing hard in practice this week and I think they'll be ready." 
What the Irish will have to be ready for is a 2-0 Lady Bruin squad that has had a large turnover in per­sonneL Graduation has not hurt Coach Billie Moore's team, though. Rather, some key people have quit the team this year. One of those people, 6-1 junior Necie Thompson, was the team's leading scorer and rebounder the past two years. An­other, Jackie Joyner, was also a key performer for Moore. 
"They don't have Necic orJackie," says DiStanislao, "but they really don't seem to have lost much. They've picked up a couple of girls from Holland who have taken over." 
The two Dutch players about whom DiStanislao is talking are Marja van Hclvoort and Annette Kcur. Their height -van Helvoort is 6-4 and Keur is 6-3 -helps out a team that has returned most of last year's backcourt. 
Sophomore point guard Michelle McCoy is the leader of the offense. McCoy is among the best point guards in the country, and, while she does have the ability to direct the run-and-gun offense that UCLA used last year while compiling an 18-11 record, she also is able to direct the more balanced attack that UCLA will be using this year. 
Joining McCoy in the backcourt is outside threat Anne Dean. Dean ap­pears to be one of the people that the Bruins will be looking to for scoring punch. She led the team in scoring in the Bruins' last game, a 96­

If at first you don't succeed ... 
The Notre Dame women's basket­
ball team, comingoff a poor showing 
in the Notre Dame Classic over the 
Thanksgiving weekend, gets another 
<:hance to beat a nationally-known 
power tomorrow as a familiar op­
ponent, lJCLA, visits the ACC in the 
second half of a men's-women's 
doubleheader. 

The Irish have been trying to break into the big time and the Bruins have played a major role in seeing that they don't make it. The teams have played three times in the last two years, with the Bruins taking all three. Both games last year turned out to be routs. However, with a better team than in past years, Irish coach Mary DiStanislao is looking for her team to rebound from last weekend and treat the visitors rudely.
