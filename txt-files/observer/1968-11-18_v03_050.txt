NEW YORK (UPI) ~ An agreement was reached Sunday to end a biller citywide teachers strike that deprived most of New York's 
1.12 million public school children of instruction for nearly 2\6. months. The crisis was colored throughout by racial antagonisms. 
The membership of the striking United Federation of Teachers UFT must now ratify the agreement, and the union scheduled meetings fate Sunday for this purpose. 
Mayor John V. Lindsay announced the agreement after a marathon negotiating session at his official residence that went on continuously, except for meal breaks, for more than 36 hours. The schools were expected to reopen Monday or Tuesday. 
Albert Shanker, president of the UFT, later told a mass meeting of IH,OOO teachers at Madison Square Garden that "the big fight has been won." He was given a standing ovation, but also was booed and accused of a "sellout" when he announced some of the terms of the 
settlement. 

Diplomats Doubt Early Cease Fire 
PARIS (UPI) North Vietnamese diplomats yesterday cast 
protesting both Dow and C.I.A. representation on this campus. Protest Director Greg Gore plans to initiate the event this Monday with a 12:30 pm gathering at the flagpole in front of the Law Building. 
The demonstration is to be tentatively concluded sometime Wednesday afternoon although it might very well endure beyond that, depending on the fervor of demonstrators. Throughout this student-faculty cooperation, several white-arm banded students will actively keep student order. In addition, for as long as the demonstration is going on, there will be a round-the-clock vigil in the 
complete schedule as of Sunday 
night: 
MondaJJ: At 12:30 there will be a general gathering in front of the tlagpole. Marshals (white armbands) will lead protestors to the second floor of the Administration Building. Group breaks up at five. Regathering at about 8:00 pm for folk music. At II :00 pm, there will be a folk Mass performed. Students who wish may spend the night. (Primarily a Dow protest). 
Tuesday: In the morning, two speakers will address those in the Administration Building, while student protestors will circulate various petitions and information. Around 2:00 pm pm, several relevant film documentaries will be shown. Folk Mass at II :00 pm. Students may stay overnight. (Primarily a Dow protest). 
Wednesday: At 9:00 am protestors will work on signs, petitions, and information for afternoon regrouping for another demonstration primarily against the C.I.A. From 2:00 to 
5:30 there will be poetry reading and general speeches. Conclusion around 5:00pm. 

Gore is counting on spontaneity in the next three days. Referring to student demonstrators he declared, "We want everybody to do their own thing."

The Hour of Protest 
Dow Chemical Company and the Central Intelligence Agency are scheduled this week to interview Seniors for employment after graduation. Many students at Notre Dame feel that the injustices of extending the privilege of recruiting on campus to Dow and the CIA is sufficient to warrant a protest. We wholeheartedly support the actions of those students, so long as they remain in the interest of communication and in SGrvice of some ideal of what this university should be. 
Today's demonstration is directed against Dow ChemicaL We feel that in the past this company has been singled out injudiciously as an example of a corporation contributing materials to the War. Fuzzy-thinking~ liberalism has been responsible for an emotion-laden attack on Dow for the production of napalm, without a realistic expression of comparable moral indignation at the contribution to the War by other members of the American super-corporate structure. 
However unfortunate Dow might be in serving as the singular victim of irrational attack, we feel that the company's persistent defense of napalm manufacture as a national duty demonstrates the same lack of reason. While failure to recognize the nature or influence of the corporate structure of this country on its military by those outside the structure is a serious fault, it is at least an honest one. Dow's failure to even acknowledge the intimacy of its success and the growth of the War is nothing more than a gross deception. Dow has consistently failed to answer a call to conscience. 
Later this week demonstrations will be directed against the-CIA. Now, if we knew who controls the Central Intelligence Agency, what its activities are, and what purposes guide it, discussion of the CIA and its recruiting at Notre Dame would be an easy matter. 
However, there can be no doubt after disclosures made by the National Student Association, individuals, and public officials including U.S. Senators that the CIA is primarily a secret force, an institution responsible to no one. To say that the Central Intelligence Agency defends the national interest is absurd! It is apparent that the CIA determines the national interest. 
Were representatives of Dow andи the CIA appearing on campus to lecture and to stand before questions, we would welcome them; the closed interview, however, is hardly part of the process of free speech. It is, in fact, the unjustifiable opening of the facilities of this university to those whose aims arc fundamentally destructive of the 
university. We suggest that the presence of Dow and the CIA on campus be taken not as impulse for revolution or irrational 
demands, but as signalling the urgent necessity for the university to seriously re-examine its outside commitments. That re-examination, one so fundamentally 
concerned with the enterprise of the university, must be 
undertaken by all members of the community in all 
possible fruitful ways. 
MONDAY, NOVEMBER 18,1968 



..............Joel Connelly 
The Silent Warriors 
....................................................., 
The Notre Dame community is this week playing host to representatives of two unusual institutions. The first is the Dow Chemical Company, which makes the nampalm which kills several thousand innocent Vietnamese each year. Secondly we have the Central Intelligence Agency, which in the name of freedom 
overthrows popularly elected governments and subverts the institutions of American education. 
Some .elements here object to the presence of Dow and the C.I.A. Their negative expression of opinion has already been heard in the Student Senate and read in circulars distributed throughout the campus. There will be demonstrations this week, and probably counter-demonstrations. The pages of the Observer will be filled with charges, countercharges, and conflicting claims. However, in spite of all of this, the Dow and C.I.A. people will quietly go about their recruiting. At no time will they appear before either their detractors or defenders to answer questions and explain their purposes. They have no such contribution to make. Rather, their purpose is to use Notre Dame to obtain fledgling chemists and spies and depart as quickly as their mission is accomplished. 
Now I object to this. You may claim it is a matter of free speech to let these people come here. However, where is the speech? Sure, the doors of Notre Dame must be open to men of all points of view, but coupled with the openness is a duty of contribution. The Dow and C.I.A. people have every right to come to this campus, but they are sneaking in the back door for purposes which are exclusively private and selfish. If they set up shop here they must come forward and explain their purposes, listerning to hostile opinion and responding to critical questioning. 
Dow and the C.I.A. are two institutions which lie in the central focus of campus controversy. The giant chemical company has met moral objections to what it manufactures with statistical data establishing that nampalm comprises less than 5% of business. In the tradition of the German chemical combines which manufactured Zyclon B for the S.S. all during the Second World War, Dow has disclaimed all responsibility for its product after it is delivered to the 
U.S. Air Force. However, what I think is important is that these cute little pat answers have been given in newspaper advertisements and press conferences. Nowhere have Dow officials stood before students and presented their case. Yet, the company relies on campus 
recruiting for its talent. The C.I.A. is if anything even more sinister, since it refuses even to rationalize and denies the obvious when it chooses to speak at all. Eighteen months ago the Agency was discovered to have 
infiltrated the National Student Association and used the nation's .largest student organization for its own purposes. Two years ago Ramparts magazine revealed that the C.I.A. luid -financed and 
secretly conducted a Michigan State University project WlliCil tramea Diem's secret police in South Vietnam. All this time, as accusations and revelations have accumulated, the C.I.A. has remained silent. Nevertheless it conducts a heavy recruiting program at the very 
I.Ulixersities whoe integrity it has conpromised. 
Thus what we have on this campus are two organizations whic1 are pursuing their own ends and refusing to speak to us. The C.I.A. and Dow have made it a practice to use American universities even as they maintain a total silence as to the nature of their activities. They are blatantly using us in the furtherance of activities which are 
unjust and immoral.

And Shaw Created Woman 
by Michael Patrick O'Connor and K. A. Hilary Palka 


George Bernard Shaw once suggested that "the goodness of a 'good acting play' consists in the skill with which it is constructed so as to Fequire no acting for its successful performance." But then if everything George Bernard Shaw ever suggested were true, the structure of reality would border on the trite. The second production of the Notre Dame-St. Mary's Theatre season is his Candida and at least that mounting cannot be judged by Shaw's own criterion. 
Candida is one of those rare works of art that could probably be geometrically represented without destroying the substance of the play, s-.J .finely is it drawn and so tightly constructed. And Gf course if the structure of the work is any way uudermined in rpoduction, the essence of the play begins to slip away. That is the basic problem with Mr. Fred Syburgh's direction of the play. 
The finer accents of that structure are hinted at in Zack Brown's costumes and William Byrd's set, but perhaps most of all in the Mahler pieces which introduce each act and which close the third act... 
* * *  
Candida is  an  intimate play. Three of H  ;mall  
cast of six characters form a framing backdroJ  .vhile  
around  the  other  three  the  action  of  tl  play  

revolves. Pros_erpine) Garnett, an unmarried woman of about thirty, is secretary to Candida's husband; she is ever-educated. brisk, and bitchy. In a most clearly drawn piece of character acting, Christing Hall's Pressy invariably steals the stage in the comic scenes. Mis Hall is purely Shavian fun as she defends her virtue and her position in life for no reason at all or as she rather awkwardly grasps for a fewи shreds of respect from those around her. She is the only character who exceeds the demands of the play; despite Miss Hall's Midwestern origins, we believe even Bernard Shaw would have royally applauded her performance. 
Lexy Mill, the curate, has no marked character of his own and models himself upon his pastor. John Zeller's performance is passable but by no means wholly adequate; as a consequence, the entire production suffers seriously, especially since Miss Hall deserves a good comic foil. 
The last of the three minor characters is Burgess, Candida's father, played by Willem O.Reilly. A wealthy bourgeois of sixty, he is coarse-minded, vulgar and ignorant; he is vain of his buasiPess success, obtained through shameless exploitation of his workingmen. O'Reilly positively revels in the most Shavian aspect of the self-made capitality-his language. In Candida, as in Pygmalion,virtue enunciates properly and vice, exemplified by Burgess, drops its "haitches." His performance again shows his exceptional ability as a character actor. 
Candida, the heroine, thirty-three years of age, is commonplace from an intellectual point of view, but has greatness of soul and is preeminently intuitive. She is totally emancipated from conventions, and prejudices. Patricia Moran consistently shows the real Shavian woman, sensitive to the agitations of souls around her but without intellectual pretensions to comprehension. But she seems unwilling to project the greatness of Cam~ida . Her hesistancy at time make~ us wonder if this is the disarming, the beautiful, the magnetic Candida, as she described even before her entrance. 
Played by Dan Diggles, James Mavor Morell 
Candida's husband, is a man over forty, of vigorou~ physique, intelligent, cultivated, lively; but he not is either mind or body of particularly fine fiber. Diggles plays him well as a man who obviously needs a woman to guide hir.1 at every step, without being told that he is being guided. He is confortably established as the incumbent of a large East End parish and his comfort and his establishment can both be chalked up to Candida. Diggles' pretended self-sufficiency is a thorough, honest portrayal of what Canrlida has wrought. 
Charles Perrin mounts Eugene Marchbanks, the son of an earl and a boy of refined temperan .mt, in a way that is, if not aristocratic, at least delicate. Marchbanks is a physical wreck, almost morbidly nervous and Perrin has great difficulties in consistently putting on the sickliness of the eighteen year old. But he has significantly seized upon Marchbanks' moral strength; and he thus translates a sense of the poet's intuitiveness. The sheer stage personality of Marchbanks' timidity is also well conveyed, although too often at the risk of making a character who tries to affect the seriousness of a poet seem whimpey. 
* * * 

The material action of the play is simple. Into the peaceful household of the Morells there is received as a friend of the family a young poet, Eugene Marchbanks, no more a bug baby, so far does he live from the realities of life. Eugene loves Candida, and ~ells her husband so. Morell, after a preliminary Impulse to turn Eugene out, recognizes the uselessness of forcible methods, and wishes Candida to make the choice between himself and~ Eugene. ~andida c~ooses her husband and EugeiЋe ,goes out mto the mght. This extremely simple material action illustrates several kinds of love: Morell's love for Candida, ideal romantic, and ethereal, ti love he feels for a visionary Candida rather than fo. the real Candida of flesh and blood; and the love of Proserpine for Morrell, a purely sexual adoration. These various kinds of love, as they develop and take shape, give rise to the spiritual drama which is conveyed well in the production, despite considerable attenuations. Morell, Marchbanks, and Proserpine suffer and we watch their struggles. Candida's soul remains serene; in her there is no internal struggle. Here the production suffers, because Patricia Moran does struggle in the torture of having to act the per~ect woman. She cannot, for example, grasp the feeling of motherhood that somehow mingles with the chaste essence of the character; she is forced to settle for a sickly veneer of motherliness. 
Despite all these difficulties the performance is on the whole an adequate one; Shaw is undoubtedly shredded up, but the intellectual counterbalances of the work arc retained., The fine rhythms arc destroyed but the rugged play of ideas persists.

In 1965, the International Research Co., Inc., was set up in Washington, D. C. IRC, Inc. was set up to advise and consult with the Agency for International Development on educational matters. One of the founders of IRC, Inc. was Robert Kiley, a 1958 graduate of Notre Dame and 1958-1959 president of NSA. From 1962 to 1%4 he was vice president of the World Assembly of Youth, another recipient of CIA funds (indirectly, of course, through the front organization titled the Foundation for Youth and Student Affairs). Kiley is a CIA man. He is said to be head of the CIA covert division which handles student affairs; he has represented the CIA on the US government's interagency youth board. 
Robert Kiley's rise from president of NSA to a CIA man specializing in student affairs will be an inspiration to all who seek su~cess in an autonomous realm where the ideals of American democracy and academic integrity can be safely ignored. The whole structure of the NSA was rigged by the "old boys." After the selection of the prime student leaders to work as CIA men in the NSA, new "old boys" were selected and trained. The "old boys" kept up a tradition that worked well until the disguise was stripped away. But did the Agency, or the public, learn the lesson well'>

.Depth, Balance Do It For ND 
Paradoxically, a pair of college football's "extraneous 
forces" brought Georgia Tech and Notre Dame together 
on common ground Saturday, thereby permitting the 
real difference between the two teams to show itself. 
This game could have pitted Terry Hanratty and Larry 
Good, two of the nation's finest quarterbacks, on a fast, 
dry track in one of the more classic aerial battles of 
1968. In that case the score would have been: (1) closer 
than 34-6; (2) something less than a true indicator of the 
teams' relative strengths. 
But Hanratty spent the afternoon munching hot dogs 
in the press box. And Good, though he did dress, had no 
chance of playing, because Tech faces Georgia in two 
weeks and Yellowjacket fans would rather give up grits 
and cornbread than lose that one. 
The other "extraneous force" Saturday was a South 
Bend monsoon. So the situation was the same for both 
squads: a second-team quarterback handling a slippery 
ball. Let Tech coach Bud Carson explain what happened 
under those circumstances. 
"We've only got about 14 real football players and 
almost every one of them is being used to give us a 
high-powered passing offense. 
"Now when anything happens to that passing hame, 
we're in real trouble. This team was 4-2 a couple weeks 
ago, but we lost three straight. Then some writers ask me , what's wrong. That's too stupid a question for me to even answer. When your top quarterback's out, you're hurt. This kid (Good) is one of the best in the nation. 
"So we come up here. You know what our chances of 
beating Notre Dame are? One in a million. You know what we need to beat you? First of all, everybody has to 'be healthy, we need the proper conditions for passing, everything has to go just right, we have to get some momentum going and we have to get the breaks," 
Carson explained. 
But none of those conditions was available to The Reck. It was a day only for ducks and runners, not passers. The Southerners (averaging less than 90 yards overland per game) were no match for NO's backs, who are romping along at a 300-yards-per-game clip. 
Conceding to Tech all the advantages necessary for their style of play, it may have been a good football game. But still the Yellowjackets would not have been able to cope with NO's overall talent. 
"We don't have the size you have up front," Carson continues. "When we're on defense and you're on offense, it's not even a fair fight. 
"We only have a couple kids who could start fo'r any team .in the country, Notre Dame included. Like Eric Wilcox (middle linebacker), but he's been hurt, hasn't played 10 plays for us all year. We just can't come up with a replacement for him the way Notre Dame can. 
"We've got Joel Stevenson (tight end). He could play with anybody. (John) Sias? I'm not sure. With a passing team he could make it. But here's a good example of the difference between the two teams. You take Jim Seymour. Now don't get me wrong. He's a great receiver. But he has all day to get open, whereas, our kids better get open in a hurry or he'll never get the ball. 
"Understand me? We don't have the depth Notre Dame has. When guys like Good and Wilcox and (John) Riggle (promising sophomore linebacker) are out, we can't fill those holes. It's different for you. When 
Hanratty gets hurt,  you  bring in  Theismann and he's  
almost as good."  
Carson's words about  Irish depth  are  to the point.  

Consider the ND fullback job, for instance. Last year, Ron Dushney was the starter at season's opening. 
Injured in the second game of 1967, Dushney lost his job to Jeff Zimmerman, who went right to the top of the ND rushing list. This fall, starter Zimmerman suffered an ankle sprain against Oklahoma, played a few games at less than 100% and left an opening for Dushney. So Ron regained the starting spot and led NO rushing Saturday with 87 yards on 16 carries. 
Or consider the left halfback position. Frank Criniti opened the season but Denny Allan won the job for three weeks. Then Coley O'Brien moved in when Allan pulled a hamstring. Or the left inside linebacker post. Jim Wright strained knee ligaments and gave way to Joe Freebery three days prior to the opening game. Wright is healthy now, but Freebery hasn't yielded that starting role. 
Or the most dramatic and widely publicized case-Theismann doing an excellent job at QB. It's replacements like Joe and 'Jacket signal-caller Jim Person who sharpen the contrast between Notre Dame and Georgia Tech personnel. It was the rushing-passing, offensive-defensive balance of the Irish which won Saturday's contest. 
NO's next opponent isn't much more balanced than the last. Injuries and rain thwarted Tech's passing attack. But neither of those aids is likely to be present Nov. 30 in Los Angeles Coliseum. Then it will be up to Notre Dame's defense to stop Southern Cal's "one-man backfield."
