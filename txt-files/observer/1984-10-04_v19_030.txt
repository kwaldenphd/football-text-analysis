In Brief 
The expulsion of two graduate students at the University ofGeorgia resulted from their allegedly selling grades to three undergraduates enrolled in their Spanish classes. The under­graduates paid SISO to the two graduate teaching assistants in ex­change for "A" grades. All of the undergraduates involved had their Spanish grades reduced, and two of them may lose their college degrees as well. -The Observer 
The numberOfairlinedelays dropped in Septem­ber because of better weather and the end of vacation season, but the figure remained much higher than a year ago, officials said yes­terday. The Federal Aviation Administration said there was an average of 1,051 flight delays a day nationwide during September, compared to 1,43I a day during August. That compared to 545 delays a day in September I983. -AP 
A surprise university fire drill in which smoke 
bombs were set offto add realism went awry Tuesday when students panicked, and six people were treated for smoke inhalation, aut­horities said. Smoke bombs were set off at 6:50p.m. by officials in a I4-story dormitory at Stephen F. Austin State University. Five of the injured students were treated for smoke inhalation at Nacogdoches Memorial Hospital and released, a hospital spokeswoman said. A sixth student was treated at the scene, said university spokesman Ken Kennamer. He added campus officials had conducted a similar drill before. -AP 
Brown UDiversity students will vote next 
week on whether they want the campus health center to stock cyanide pills so students can commit suicide in event of a nuclear war rather than die from fallout. About 700 undergraduates at the Ivy League school signed a petition asking that the question be in­cluded on the ballot for the Oct. I0-1I student council election. If the referendum passes but the health center refuses to stockpile cyanide pills, Chris Ferguson, co-author of the referendum, said he hopes it will store a supply of aspirin or other "symbolic" tablets instead. He said such an action still would cause some students to think about the nuclear issue. -AP

Core.y Cerovsek, who moved to Bloomington from Van­couver, Canada, was invited to play his violin solo for the queen Monday night because he is considered one of Canada's top performers. Although Corey has excelled to college levels both musically and academically, he cringes when people call him a genius or a child prodigy. He says he is just like other kids-he likes to ride bikes, play soccer and build tree houses. -AP

Congressmen outraged over spending of funds 
A."'llodated Press 
WASHINGTON · Congressmen expressed outrage yesterday that most of the S8 million set aside so military facilitit:s could he adapted as shelters for the homeless had been spent by the Army on routine malntl·nance. 
"lhat, I think, is just shocking," said Rep. Ted Weiss, D·N.Y., chair­man of subcommittee that was told about the Defense Department's spending. 
"!he General Accounting Office said that in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, J200,000 was used to upgrade a facility for the homeless in Alameda County, Calif., and S700,000 has been obligated for a similiar project in Philadelphia. 
""Inc balance of the money has been spent in Army reserve fix-up operations" to repair "defense facilities for defense purposes," said Paul C. Wright of the GAO, the con· gressional audit agency. 
"Ibe money set aside by Congress for the homeless orginially had been placed in a Defense Department ac· count because "Army reserve centers were thought to be probably the first type of facility to be used as a shelter," he said. 
"However when Defense saw it was not going to be using the entire $8 million" for the shelters, it decided to spend the money for other purposes rather than lose it at the end of the fiscal year, he said. 
Joseph F. Delfie<>, associate direc­tor of the human resources division of the GAO, said the Pentagon con­tended that one reason it didn't use all the money on shelters was the remoteness of the military bases. 
He added: "the base commanders who were in charge of the local bases had rules about the amount of people they would take onto the base, the facilities and how they would be used and they're quite restrictive. 
"For military reasons, they preferred to restrict some ofthe use of the base to maybe just weekends and certain times during the weekend and so forth." 
Local citizens who were hoping to use the facilities to provide help for the homeless often found the condi· tions too restrictive, he said.

HAMBURG, West Germany · In· vestigators said yesterday they found no life preservers aboard a chartered ship that sank after a colli· sion in Hamburg harbor, killing 19 revelers on a birthday champagne cruise. 
The cause of the Tuesday night disaster had not been determined as investigators raised the wreckage of the 47-foot Martina and towed it to a shipyard. 
The husband and wife who char· tered the vessel to celebrate his 40th birthday were among 24 people rescued, but their two young sons were presumed drowned. 
The body of a woman in her 60s was found floating in the harbor about an hour after the Martina, with 4 3 aboard, sank after colliding with a tugboat cable. 
Six more bodies, three adults and three children, were found trapped in the Martina's hull when the vessel was raised yesterday. 
Rescuers abandoned the search for seven adults and five children still missing, saying there was no hope they survived. 
Wolfgeorg Rosenhagen told police he and his wife, Gudrun, char­tered the ship for a champagne cruise to celebrate his birthday. They were rescued, along with 22 others who were treated for shock and exposure after being plucked from 51-degree waters. But the The captain was among those mis· sing and presumed dead. 

Police said some witnesses claimed the tugboat Therese was not displaying the proper lights when the Martina hit a cable con· necting the tugboat and a barge. The tug was not damaged, and there were no injuries among its crew. 
Interior Senator Rolf Lange told reporters the Martina capsized and "may have been run over by the barge," which was loaded with ma­terial from an excavation site. 
Tugboat skipper Guenther Heinemann immediately radioed an alarm and began taking survivors aboard, authorities said. 
In all, 35 boats and 700 police offi· cers, firefighters, harbor officials and 
Rosenhagens'  sons,  11-year-old  
Guntram  and  5-year-old  Mathias,  
were missing.  

Joachim Peters, head of the Ham· burg harbor police, said "no rescue gear was found," either life preser­vers orlife rafts, on the raised boat or in the water nearby. 
It was not immediately clear what lifesaving equipment would have been required aboard the Martina. 

volunteers joined the rescue effort, scouring the nearby Elbe River, which makes up Hamburg harbor, and the rocky banks for survivors. Relatives kept shoreline vigils through the night. 
Heinemann was unavailable for comment, and the telephone at his home was not answered Wednes­day. No charges have been filed against him.

;1 Terracotta head 
Past identity found in Nigerian ground 
by Patty Tripathi 
features staff writer 
I
n 1938 when technically superb and extraor­
dinarily beautiful bronze or brass sculptures were 
escavatt·d from lfe in Western Nigeria, it bewildered 
historians and archaeologists. 'Jbese naturalistic 
sculptures, advanced in their casting, were unlike any 
other Mrican work ofart. Their similarity to European 
styles ofsculpture led the experts to believe that these 
cscavations were not Mrican. 
An archaeologist, Frank Willett, by tracing the 
history of the sculptures in Nigeria, reveal~d that t~ese 
outstanding pieces ofart were actually African. 11us

and traced the history ofsculptures in Nigeria from the 
middle of the first millennium B.C. up to the present 
day as it has been revealed by a succession ofexca~a­
tlons. In his lecture he links with Ife the great medieval 
center ofportrait-like sculpture in bronze and 
terracotta. Willett also shows how this relates to the 
arts of Benin and Owo and to later sculpture of the 
Yoruba peoples who still inhabit Southwestern 
Nigeria. 
By explaining how he carefully examined every . 
minute detail of the sculptures, Willett illustrated h1s 
reasoning that these works ofart were African. Unlike 
the European arts, the heads of the sculptures were as 
large as the rest ofthe body. The rings on the forehead, 
reciprocal curve oflower eyelid to the eyebrow, 
elaborate hairstyle, and the circular or triangular shape 
of the eyes ofthe sculptured heads helped to prove 
that these magnificant structures were African. The 
discovery of radio-carbon proved false the eth­
nocentric view that people living in mud shacks and 
under grass roofs could not have made such beautiful 
objects as the bronze and terracotta sculptures. 
The bronze and terracotta sculptures depictevidence ofother crafts as well. The clothing worn by 
the figures were ofcloth and some embroidery on the sashes was also evident. Beads ofa variety ofshapes and sizes were common on the figures and a great variety ofbracelets ofglass, metal or ivory with sculptures of human and animal as well as motifs of abstract nature were also discovered in the escava­tions done in lfe. 
Professor Willett is the director of the Hunterian Museum at the University ofGlaslow, Glaslow, Scotland. When in charge of Ethnology and General Archaeology in the Manchester University Museum, Willett conducted expeditions to lfe and Old Oyo. In 1958, he became the archaeologist to the Federal Government of Nigeria and curator of the lfe Museum. He has since worked at Oxford ( 1964--66) and Northwestern University ( 1966--76) as the professor ofAfrican Art. He has writt~n the History ofWest 
African Sculpture ( 1967),Aj{1Can Arts: An Introduc­tion ( 1971 ), Treasures ofAncient Ngerla ( 1980 ), and numerous articles on archaeology and art history of West Africa. In 1979 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and since 1959 has been honorary corresponding member of the Manchester 
Utcrary and Philosophical Society, an honor formerly held by Benjamin Franklin.

'New Sensations' felt in blues and rhyth01 
by Pat Beaudine 
features staffwriter 
I
f you walk past the trendy, slick night clubs of New York City to an old rhythm and blues bar on a dark, rundown street, you'll find Lou Reed. His song fills every pore of the city and his music pounds like the heart of urban life. In a sense, he is its perfect model--with its vices, candor, and toughness--and a "great defender" ofit, as he sings on his new album, New Sensa­tions. 
By the title a revitalized Lou 
Reed cah be sensed. And once 
the opening chords of"l Love 
You, Suzanne" ring out, it 
becomes clear that he's on a 
fresh turn in his long career. But 
the music is not the only thing 
special about his best single in 
years. It's the message. He sings 
about a woman named Suzanne 
and regardless of what she does, 
he's going to love her: 
I love you when you're good 
/loveyou when you're bad 
Do whatyou gotta do 
But/loveyou, Suzanne 
A special, unbreakable bond also exists in "My Friend George," as he sings: 
Readinthepaperabouta man killed with a sword And that made me think ofmy friend George People said the man wasfive foot six Sounds like Georgie with his killing stick 
In other words, his friend was not perfect, but Reed's quick to point out "I hear you talking about my friend George "and that you better get the word right before you label him. 
"Turn to Me" is another song about a friend. Basically, Reed sings no matter what kind of bind his friend may be in, he'll always be there to help out. This brings up another point: all ofhis good friends, in a sense, are "blood brothers," and behind Reed's dark shades and leather jacket is an honest, loyal guy. His front is just like his New York City, because behind all of the 

gritty veneer is a town with a 
solid bond. 

But, just like the city, Reed's not perfect. He's got his major vices, as he sings in "Endlessly Jealous:" 
jealousy endlessly sweeps through my mind Andjealousy often causes me to 
be unkind 
I'm sony I said that 
I'm sony I did that 
..J'm sony, I'm sony. 

And in the title track he reminds the listener that "drunk and disorderly, I ain't no cupid." In other words, he's telling it like it is, and ifit isn't liked, there's not much he can do but be sorry. 
Through all of these songs it is appart.nt that l.ou Reed is no typical rock star, but his music does not suffer through his self-­expression. If anything, it stands by itself, nicely. Sure, "What Becomes a Legend Most" is a bit awkward and unremarkable, but there arc ten other songs to make up the difference. 11le guitar riff and drum intro on "Turn to Me," for example, have as much impact as some ofThe Rolling Stones' best. And "Down at the Arcade" rocks surely: 
Oh, I'm the Great Defender, 
listen to my song 1 really hopeyou like it, it isn't very long 
It's rooted in the fifties, but its heart's in 1984 And ifyou really like it Then I'll sing itfor you once more. 
Reed's heart is clearly devoted to the present, a..'iNewSensa­tions illustrates. It's a solid workout that shows the "great defender" doing what he does best--no nonsense rock n roll. And even though it is rooted In the fifties, It's fresher than ever and makes one thing evident-­he's going to have to sing It once more.

,r 
r just wondering 
f 
doses of bombastic oratory, obscuring some of the more interesting political develop­ments. For example, the continuing saga of Edwin Meese's bid to become the next U.S. Attorney General. 
! 
Meese, in case you do not remember, is one of President Reagan's closest advisors. Unfor­tunately, it appears that Meese suffers from a r 
very unusual memory disorder. He forgot, for r example, to make mortgage payments on his r California home for fifteen months. "No prob­lem," said the loan officers at Great American r" Bank of San Diego. In fact, four loan officers r were able to inform him oftheir generosity in r person -they were given Federal jobs. Who r approved their hiring? Why, none other than r Ed Meese. Apparently his memory did not fail 
him completely. Then again, the White House 
r 
labeled this turn ofevents "coincidence". 
Does this mean that Meese made use of his high government position to fix a glitch in his personal financial life? "Of course not," said Meese, " ...(I've) never taken advantage of an official position to obtain private gain." 
r 
The hiring of E.W. Thomas by Meese as his 
aide seems to bear this out. Thomas did not loan any money to Meese. He did, however, make a n 5,000 interest-free loan to Meese's wife. At this time, however, the mysterious memory bug struck again, and Ed Meese "neglected" (surprise!) to report the loan on his required financial disclosure statements. It was probably just another coincidence. 
Two weeks ago, a court-appointed inves­tigator released his 385-page report on Meese's activities. With regard to his aforementioned credit practices, the report states that while "an inference of willful non­disclosure arguably could be drawn," no motivefor doing so could befound. Meese's response that any omissions were inadvertent was accepted, even though evidence exists that Thomas had reminded him to list the $15,000 loan on his disclosure forms. 
Meese is not the only Reagan aide a.tflicted with memory problems. Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan is currently under indict­ment for alleged involvement in racketeering activities within the construction industry ­the only sitting Cabinet member in history to be so charged. Former EPA director Anne Bur­ford Gorsuch left her job under heavy fire, and subsequently was cited in contempt of court for refusing to provide auditors with informa­tion pertaining to her management of the Su­perfund toxic waste cleanup program. After the flak surrounding this incident subsided, she accepted a high-paying government job she described as "stupid and pointless". A similar case is that of)ames Watt. As Secretary of the Interior, he was responsible for the protection of our nation's natural resources. However, he proposed to nearly halve the acreage ofFederal conservation areas, remove dozens of animals from the Endangered Species List, and ease restrictions on various industrial processes proven to be harmful to the environment. Where is Watt now? He works for the same business interests he once regulated. 
So, let's stop looking at the candidates so closely. It's a lot more fun to watch their cronies. When we think about the mess they are making oftheir offices; we certainly need a good laugh.

Ronald Reagan isn't a White House phantom 
From now until election day expect signs of a more informed Ronald Reagan, especially on foreign policy. It is meant to rebut Reagan's vulnerability to the repeated charge that he is

The Lerner column 
lazy and ignorant, that he doesn't work, doesn't know anything and doesn't involve himselfin anything. 
Given Reagan's presidential and polls' suc­cess, it recalls Lincoln's historic response to those who complainied about General Grant's drinking problem. "Tell me what brand he drinks and I'll get it for my other generals." 
Tip O'Neill, who worries about Reagan's work ethic, says the president never worked more than 2 1/2 hours a day and "never fol­lows up." Think of the collective envy this must arouse. It contrasts with Jimmy Carter's 16 or 18 hours doing all the White House chores himself, and makes Carter clearly the more assiduous if the not superior president. 
Walter Mondale, very much the pursuer of the possessor, has another theory -that Reagan is being held prisoner by his Palace Guards, to "isolate" him from the world of reality and is brought out on occasion wrapped in a cocoon to show up for his "photo opportunities" and display appoint-

ments, like the Gromyko meeting. The 
"cocoon theory" has caught on and is the cur­
rent rage ofWhite House correspondents. 
Yet it is scarcely a discovery that the presi­
dent is being given tender, loving treatment 
by his handlers, who know how to use the 
technology of a 1V political culture. The 
practical payoff at any moment is the poll 
results and the electoral college projections. 
The Reagan people moved fast to take ad­
vantage of the Gromyko visit and turned the 
opening of the U.S. session into political the­
ory, which made the entire world focus on 
Reagan's changed position on weapons talks 
with the Russians. 
Again Mondale charges that this is a fake 
Reagan, and that the "new Reagan" is only a 
phantom of the White House. But it is Reagan 
who will have taken the initiative and 
Mondale the responsive role. 
The charge of an "ignorant" gives meaning 
to a new vein of events. In preparing for the 
Gromyko meeting, we were told, Reagan met 
for briefings with a cluster of unofficial 
Sovietologists and again with a cluster of 
governmental ones, although I doubt he:: could 
have learned over much from either since 
Sovietology has largely become a kind of 
Kremlin weather-watching. 
He also met, most notably, with Richard 
Nixon. Reagan has for weeks been touching all 
the bases of his White House predecessors ­
Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Jack Ken­
nedy. That he now includes Nixon, whom he 
has seen privately a number of times but now 
publicly, is a sign ofthe added security he feels 
in making the public connection that might 
once have appeared dangerous. 
This, I suggest is no phantom at the White 
House. He is very much a presence. The tan­
talizing question is still the skill with which it 
is done. What it shows is that being president 
is an adventure in showmanship as well as in 
decision-making.

historian, not a moral theologian. Thus, I can claim no authority whatever except the faith we share as brothers and sisters in Christ. 
The abortion question is so difficult for so many people -including people of faith from all religious traditions -because, more than perhaps any other moral dilemma now facing us -it exposes us to the ambiguity we experi­ence because we are human beings and not gods. Ambiguity is a most uncomfortable ex­perience, for we would rather be absolutely sure of ourselves, and so we try to distance ourselvesfrom the experience as best we can. 
This desire to escape the dilemma ofhaving to make difficult choices about how to be faithful to the God who gives us life is ex­pressed very powerfully in the symbolic ban­ners around which partisans in the abortion dispute rally. The banner of "pro-life" and "pro-choice" are not merely steno-linguistic labels used solely to distinguish between competing moral and political agendas, but expressive symbol systems chosen by the par­tisans themselves to maximize the perceived connection between their political agendas and certain values deemed indispensable by the society in which they both interact. 
Thus, "pro-life" partisans seek to have all of us identify their political agenda-by and large concerned exclusively with fetal life -with our common commitment to life as God ­given. On the other hand, "pro-choice" par­tisans would have us identify their political agenda -largely concerned only with individ­ual power and who wields it-with our parallel commitment to freedom as God-given. In both cases, the names chosen reflect a deter­mination to obscure the ambiguityinherent in "life" and "choice", the ambiguity inherent in being responsible and responsive to the God who is the source ofboth life andfreedom and who gives both as gift, not right. That neither group has been able to completely manipulate its symbols can be seenfrom the negative epit­hets both groups hurl at one another. 
While this manipulative use of symbol sys-terns is understandable, it is not particularly faithful to the Gospel, for it ends up trying to escape the ambiguity of being human (read the story of the fall) by placing something created -in this case particular interpretations of doctrines about the nature of God and God's will -in the place that belongs only to God. Where I come from, substitution of that nature is accorded the label of idolatry. And please remember -idols are almost always good things.... in their place. They are only problematic when they usurp the rightful place ofGod. 

Militant 'pro-choice' partisans are 
idolatrous to the extent that they fail to see that the choice one must make in abortion is always ambiguous, that being responsible 
means becoming vulnerable, that being re­sponsible involves a genuine leap offaith. Sup­porting abortion as a right in every instance and for every reason seems indefensible on its face -at least for people of faith -since a re­sponsible and responsive decision, especially when the issue is life and its meaning, would be made in fear and trembling since it means standing naked before the judgment and grace ofGod. It is idolatry, not responsible disciples­hip to assert that a created value system of free-choice -alone has God's blessing in this matter. 
The "right-to-life" argument also risks be­
coming idolatrous, only in this case the 
created moral doctrine to be worshipped is 
not "choice" or "freedom" but "life", defined 
on the most narrow of bases-pre-natal, bio­
logical development. This position tends ­
even if unintentionally-to dismiss as trivial 
the moral dilemma faced by persons such as 
my wife and me who know that our gene 
pools contain the potential for giving birth to 
a child doomed to die of cystic fibrosis (a 
disease which has already claimed two of my 
brothers). For people in our position, the am­
biguity (and thus the need to choose) is nei­
ther hypothetical nor easy nor trivial. Because 
Jeanne and I have been nurtured by friends 
and family and, yes, a religious faith that prom­
ises meaning even in the face ofsuch risks, we 
cannot personally choose to abort the child 
we are now expecting on Saint Patrick's Day. 
But such is our choice. 

For others, the choice may well be differ­
ent. And in a political climate which seems to 
demand both limits and cuts in the funding 
needed just to heip a cystic fibrosis victim 
survive from day to day, I wonder how anyone 
but God could dare to judge the faithfulness 
and responsibleness of their decision?

The Puerto Rican people need their independence 

For a long time, Puerto Rican political dis­cussion has revolved around the island's poli­tical status. Because Puerto Rico's political status has remained largely unresolved, even after the 1952 innauguration of the Common­wealth, it is the most basic issue in Puerto Rican politics today. Indeed, three of the four parties presenting candidates for the forthcoming November elections center their 
Lola Gordon Mora 
guest column 
platforms on the questions of political status: PNP (Statehood). PPD (Commonwealth) and PIP (Independence). The fourth party, the PRP, was created by a split within the PNP. Although it favors statehood as well, it has hten the only party not stressing the political status question -perhaps as a way of disas­sociating itself from the PNP in the minds of the electorate. 
Governor Carlos Romero Barcelo, head of the PNP, has claimed that the time has come for a referendum on the island's political status and, more than in previous elections, has focused his campaign on defending the prospt·ct of Puerto Rican statehood. One could argue that he has been forced into using the statehood issue to avoid other more im­mtdiate issues, namely, the corruption his party has been accused. The PNP, in coordina­tion with the Department of Police of Puerto Rico, have been implicated in the assassina­tion of two pro-independence youth. Also, several PNP public officials have been accused of misuse of public funds. Among those accused was the Secretary of Justice who subsequently was proven guilty and 
fired. 
It Is important to examine the situation sur­rounding Barcelo's defense of Puerto Rican statehood. Not only has he been in power for the past two terms, but it is very likely that he might win again. (The most recent political survey, held in August, gives his party 36 per­cent of the vote, followed by 34 percent for the PPD.) 
'Ibe PNP's promise of statehood for Puerto Rico basically amounts to one thing: federal aid. In one of its televised political advertise­ments, the figure of Dona Paquita is intro­duced. Paquita is, I assume, what the PNP considers a typical Puerto Rican. Paquita, most likely, lives in the cascrio, the public housing projects, and supports herself through welfare. Even though she is "thankful" for what the federal government gives her, she could certainly use more. 
Ay, bendito, Dona Paquito. The federal aid you have been made to see as a gift has cost Puerto Rico a pretty penny. Puerto Rico has little or no control in the following areas: 
Puerto Rico has no international personal­ity-its case is still under review by the United Nations' de-colonization committee. In the most recent session of that body, Venezuela supported a motion favoring independence for the island. · 
Trade and communications, air and marine transportation, immigration, emmigration, custom laws and tariffs are all controlled by non-Puerto Rican authoritt. 
lbe 1967 Treaty ofTiatelolco signed by the 
U.S. prohibits nuclear weapons in Latin America, yet the U.S. military maintains nu­clear installations on the island, making it a primary target in a nuclear war. 
Puerto Rico is used as a "pollution haven" by many American companies, Guanica and Catano being two of the most painful exam­ples of this destructive trend. 
The island's judicial system, which is sub­ject to review by the U.S. courts, is in such ridiculous disarray that this summer a federal court had to decide whether basketball season could he held. 
When American troops invaded Puerto Rico in 1898, they distributed bubble gum to the population. Since then, Puerto Ricans as myself have been pacified into a state of sub­mission and lack of self-esteem. There is an embarrassing lack ofawareness among Puerto Ricans oftheir past -as Puerto Rican history is barely touched upon in schools. As a conse­

quence, Puerto Rico's great patriots have 
been gradually converted into "non-persons." 
Governor Barcelo once remarked, "We have 
no culture to preserve." 

Because of its threat to U.S. strategic inter­ests, the once powerful Puerto Rican indepen­dence movement has been continually crushed. Local politicians have created mis­conceptions and fears about independence, and independence has been erroneously equated with Communism. Statehood will of­fer most Puerto Ricans a parasitic existence of perpetual poverty, accompanied by an incon­gruous and dizzy consumerist mentality, un­employment, and defeat. Puerto Ricans need independence so they can begin to reassert their own identity and self-respect.

Can Christianity transform society? 
lbere are three kinds ofsociety in the West­ern tradition that come to mind in the debate between rich and poor nations. They can be distinguished on the basis of the importance they attach to the supernatural and to worldly ambition, and also, on the basis oftheir wealth and prosperity. They are the Aztec society, the Greek society, and the Christian society. 
Some people hesitate to include the Aztecs among the Western people. Perhaps, the Az­tecs represent a class hv themselves and they 
Carlos Pardo guest column 
simply happened to live in the Western hemi­sphere. They invented a particular kind ofcos­mology -something that can be called the cosmology of utter despair. They were am­bitious in the sense that they built an empire and all that, but they were quite sure that their empire would be destroyed. They were con­vinced of the cruelty of the gods. 
Many people today, especially in poor countries, live in conditions similar to those of the Aztecs: overpopulation, technological stagnation, ignorance, scarcity or resources. Often times, they find resignation, but this is not always the case. The other alternative is despair. There is the temptation of violence and cruelty for their own sake (rather than as a means to improve social conditions). There is that sense of fatality -the fatality of conflict and hatred. It may appear that the gods of heaven demand human sacrifice. 
The Greek society is associated with tech­nological advance and worldly ambition. The Greeks were not, as the Aztecs, overwhelmed by the supernatural. In fact, they tended to 
ignore the supernatural or make it trivial. They were born as a heroic people and left to the Romans the precedent of a commercial empire. They developed human knowledge and man's reliance on himself. Their artistic and scientific accomplishments have an ele­ment ofhuman pride and defiance to the gods. 
Extremes have the tendency to meet. The Greek society shared with the Aztec society its propensity to violence and social injustice. Ambition creates stress; stress, neurosis; and neurosis, an incapacity for social life. In some respects, the modern society illustrates the pattern of behavior of the Greek kind of soci­ety. It is a secular and god-less society. The wars of the twentieth century are to a large extent the result of ambition and a lack of moral sense. The economic life ofthe century is driven by the same social insensitivity. In poor countries, if conditions continue to get worse and worse, the Aztec kind of society may prevail and represent both a time bomb and a permanent obstacle to development. 
The Greek and the Aztec societies have something in common. Both of them were, at a given time, transformed by Christianity. At the time of Christ, the Greek philosophy was in disarray-it had degenerated into astrology. 

Occult religions were starting to take hold of the common man. Christianity came to revi­talize and give a new direction to the Greek and Roman worlds. 
'!be Aztecs had established a dictatorship in Mexico when the Spaniards arrived to America and brought Christianity with them. The new religion at least liberated the Indians from their gods, who were more like monsters. Also the conquest exposed the Az­tecs for the first time to technology from other parts of the world. Christianity intro­duced an element of hope and social viability to both the Aztec and the Greek societies. It provided the Aztecs with a religion ofhope. It liberated the Greeks from a circular universe with no recourse to a higher order. 
Perhaps, Christianity again ha.'> to be called upon to transform the modern world. Mankind is in need of courage and hope, as well as moral standards. Societies need to be made to function. Poor countries need social cohesion to develop their economies and in­terrelate with other nations. Rich nations need to go back to basic moral standards if they want give structure to their own societies and deal justly with poor nations. 
It is to be hoped that the Aztec civilization of despair and the Greek civilization of worldly ambition will cease to be relevant to the present world. The debate between rich and poor nations will, hopefully, be carried out in the future in a spirit ofreconciliation.

P.O.BoxQ 

Wills represents an apologetic generation 
/Jear Editor: 
'lbt fact that Garry Wills now occupies an endowt·d chair at a distinguished Catholic university has evidently not induced him to tone down his tiresome anti-Catholic rheto­rk. '!bose striving to protect the lives ofinno­cent unborn children he disparingly labels zealots. (Remember when zeal in the defense of the weak was a virtue?) 'lbc Pope and bis­hops he contemptuously accuses of trying lO use the law to compensate for their all to ob­vious deficiencies a.~ moral educators. (Remember when we used to blame the sin­ncr for not listening to the teacher?) What's more, Wills is uncommonly fond of assuring us that a moral revolution has taken place and that it is thus useless for the zealots to turn hack the clock and "pretend that a return can he madt· to the old morality." (Remember that 
quaint Scriptural preoccupation with repen­tance and the forgiveness ofsins?) 
We must be on a Catholic campus; other­wise, Wills' invective wouldn't so readily evoke the biblical image of the apostate bowing down before Baal while earnestly as­suring jeremiah and those other cranky zealots that the sundial cannot he turned back and that an irreversible moral revolution has taken place. 
You might be wondering why the College ofArts and Letters is using endowment money to provide a pulpit, so to speak, for such as Wills. lbere is, I submit, much wisdom in this apparent folly. Our students should be con­stantly confronted with the image of that gen­eration of Catholic intdlcctuals, now middle-aged, for whom, to put it bluntly but honestly, it has become a way of life to apologize for being Catholic, who have quietly swept under the rug any doctrine spurned at Harvard or Princeton (or Northwestern), and who have meekly refrained from insisting upon any moral or re­ligious imperative that does not meet with the approval of the editorial board of the New York Times. (Remember when having the courage of one's convictions was praiseworthy among Catholics?) It's a sad spectacle, to be sure, but one which the pres­ent generation of Catholic students would do well to fix firmly in mind, so a.~ better to avoid reenacting it.

The current arms situation is alarming 
Dear Editor: 
Paul Komyatte's article entitled "Has the Arms Control Era Come to an End?" (October 
2) put down in words how extremely com­plex the nuclear arms race has escalated into being. He has reminded me of how alarmed 1 am over the current situation. 

Let's face it: the two superpowers arc will­ing to give up very little of their weaponry. As if every last missile counted! If one side qid not have, for example, their desired amount of land-based missiles, will that make the oppos­ing side more the victor in a possible nuclear war? I just can't imagine a winner from an event that would have such a world-wide ef­fect a.'> nuclear war. 
I ask myself sometimes if it's worth the trou­ble worrying about somcthmg I am not an expert or official on But this concerns my future, everybody's futurt·. I feel the need to express my concern over the current stage of arms control, however little good that will do.

Soccer team retains 8th spot in rankings 
ByPHILWOLF 
AssistantSports Editor 

The Notre Dame soccer team, which tied one game and lost one last week, retained the number­eight spot in the regional rankings this week. 
The Irish held on to their ranking despite a disappointing scoreless tie at Loyola last Wednesday. On Friday, Notre Dame downed DePaul, 7-1, on Cartier Field, and the team beat Saint Joseph's/Rensselaer, 6-1, Sunday on Alumni Field. 
The rankings are determined by a board of seven collegiate soccer coaches who comprise the Intercol­legiate Soccer Association of America Mideast Region. The voting is done every Sunday night during the soccer season. 
The top spot in this week's poll is 
Steranka's experience, skill guard Irish goal 
By DAN MICHELINI 
Sports Writer 

Because of the diversity of the Notre Dame community, there is something to interest just about everyone. For Irish soccer goalie Mark Steranka, there was not much that did not attract him to the Notre Dame campus. 
"I had been a big fan of Notre Dame since the eighth grade," says Steranka. "When it came time to make a college decision, the com­patability of Notre Dame's engineer­ing and soccer programs with my interests could not be beat." 
Since coming here three years ago, Steranka, a junior from Winchester, Massachusetts, has ex­celled both on the field and in the classroom. As all students know, academics are tough enough with­out having to devote so much time to a varsity sport. However, Steranka has found the time to do both well. 
A starter for the last two years, he feels his major strength is his experi­ence in the net. 
"I have played the same position for 14 years now," he says, "so I have come to feel very comfortable back there." 
Irish coach Dennis Grace says he feels that in addition to his experi­ence, Steranka's superior athletic abilities aid him tremendously. 
"Physically, he can do things other people just can't do," explains Grace. "Even when he becomes in­decisive on the field, his athletic ability usually compensates for the lost time."

held by Indiana, which has been in the number-one position for the entire season. The Irish lost to the Hoosiers, the defending two-time national champions, 5-1, on Septem­ber 23. The Hoosiers also are ranked number one in the national poll this season. 
Indiana received all seven first­place votes for a total of 70 points. The Hoosiers' record is 9-0-1, with the only blemish on their record a 2-2 tie with Saint Louis. 
Akron retained second place this week with 63 points. Notre Dame will play host to Akron, which now has a 6-1-2 record, on October 17.

"I was not sure what I would be 
doing on this year's team because I

looks like I'm sort of the defensive 
leader now." 
Grace admits that Steranka has begun to develop as a leader, but be­cause the Irish goalie has the person­ality to lead the team, Grace wants him to develop it fully. 
"Mark definitely leads by his hustle and physical play," Grace says, "but he needs to become more vocal in the net and show a little ver­bal excitement." 
Steranka's biggest thrills thus far in his career as the Irish goalkeeper have been the last two games against Indiana. It is no coincidence that these have been two of his best per­formances, despite losing both games. 
"For some reason I don't get in­timidated by them," says Steranka. "I get so pumped up, I just go out there feeling we can beat them." 
"Mark seems to rise to the occa­sion," adds Grace. "The tougher it gets, the better he plays." 
As for this season, Steranka wants to reach the NCAA tournament, and he also would like to get a shutout ' against either St. Louis or Akron. 
This weekend offers the opportu­nity for the attainment ofboth these goals. If"Spanky" can get his shutout against eighth-ranked St. Louis, it just might set the Irish in the direc­tion ofthe NCAA's. 
when the voting occured, and the Irish collected 23 points for eighth place. 
Notre Dame opponents Michigan State and Wisconsin-Madison hold the ninth and tenth places, respectively. 
Since the rankings were deter­mined, the Irish have added another victory to their record. The win came on the road Tuesday night at Saint Francis, where Notre Dame won, 5-2. 
Five different Notre Dame players accounted for the goals. Sophomore Pat Szanto got his tenth goal of the season just eight minutes into the game with an assist from freshman Steve Lowney. 
Junior John Gibbs collected his

second goal with an assist from junior Dave Miles, who also gave an assist to freshman John Fossella. Miles later scored his own goal -his sixth ofthe year-with an assist from Szanto. 
The highpoint of the evening for the Irish came at the 76:37 mark, when senior tri-captain Rich Her­degen scored the 50th goal of his career at Notre Dame. The goal, which is Herdegen's ninth of the 
season, makes him only the second player in Notre Dame soccer history to reach the 50-goal mark. Gibbs gave Herdegen the assist on the goal.
