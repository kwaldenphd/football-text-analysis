ND, SMC excel on ranking lists 

University nabs No. 20 spot; College still leads Midwest Comprehensives 
By KATIE PERRY 
Assistant News Editor 
A flurry of rankings recently announced by top national publica­tions once again placed Notre Dame and Saint Mary's in the upper eche­lon of American academia -dis­tinctions still esteemed by leader­ship from both campuses. 
Notre Dame placed No. 20 in the 2007 U.S. News & World Report ranking of national universities -a two-point slip from last year's placement. In the 2006 list, the University tied Vanderbilt at No. 18. 
Associate Vice President for News and Information Don Wycliff said rankings have meaning for their readers. However, he said, "precise­ly what that meaning is and whether [readers] attach a lot of importance to a two-point differ­ence" is something the publication's editors should decide. 
Regardless, Notre Dame's position as a top-20 school is "extremely important" to the University, he said. 
"Notre Dame obviously values a good ranking," Wycliff said. "I don't think we need to apologize for valu­ing that. We try to put things into perspective and recognize we have certain strengths and certain things that are becoming strengths." 
Princeton University nabbed the top spot and was followed by fellow Ivies Harvard and Yale at second

Cable installation complete in all27 dorms 
By BECKY HOGAN 
News Writer 
Dreams of "Pardon the Interruption," Rachael Ray's recipes and Kristen Cavallari in a swimsuit are now a reality for Notre Dame students, thanks to the University's installation of Comcast cable in all 27 dorms. 
The process, which began in December 2005 and continued throughout the sum­mer, went hand-in-hand with the instal­lation of wireless Internet access. 
Notre Dame made its decision follow­ing an investigation into other universi­ties' policies. 
"In looking at other institutions, we realized other schools [provided] cable. We realized that we needed to upgrade ResNet and so we figured we might as well install cable," said Jeffrey Shoup, director of Residence Life and Housing.

STUDENT SENATE 



Group discusses plans for '06-'07 
By MARY KATE MALONE 
News Editor 
The wheels started turning in the Student Senate Monday as senators gathered for their first meeting of the 2006-07 school year. 
University Director of Ticket Operations Josh Berlo and Associate Director of Ticketing Maja Hansen spoke to senators about changes that were made to the football ticket exchange program -a procedure that allowed students to swap a foot­ball ticket from their student booklet for a non-student ticket. 
Tickets can be exchanged on the Tuesday before a home game from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Gate 10 Box Office at the Joyce Center. In previous years, students could exchange them on Wednesday as well. 
Berlo said there has been "rampant abuse" of the ticket exchange process in recent years, as students have sold their tickets for profit on Web sites like Ebay.com. 
"[Tickets] were getting out into the secondary market," said Berlo, adding that the tick­et exchange process was designed to provide tickets for close family members or friends

Shappell, Andrichik optin1istic 
Grab and Go changes, College Readership Program underway 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
News Writer 

Lizzi Shappell and Bill Andrichik wasted no time for­warding the agenda they pro­posed when the two were elected student body president and vice president last year. 
"So far I feel like we've made progress, and it's only the sec­ond day of classes," Shappell said. 
Their combined experience in student government and the groundwork they laid in the spring and over the summer has allowed them to hit the ground running, she said. 
Andrichik said the pair has used its time in office so far to make "some big groundwork" on large initiatives. 
"The rest of [the initiatives] we are confident we can accomplish," Andrichik said. 
Their administration has already fulfilled its campaign promise to improve Grab and Go options, the pair said. 
Last spring, students filled out food preference surveys. Andrichik personally tabulated the results, then worked with Food Services to discuss the cost effectiveness of the top choices. 
On Monday, when Grab and Go service opened for the first time this year, students could

-not strangers on the Internet. 
As a result, students who wish to exchange their student tickets for a non-student one must provide the first and last name of the person who will be using their ticket. 
"That puts the onus on the student to tell us who is going to use their ticket. ... The other option was to do away with the program," Berlo said. 
The ticket office will only exchange 300 student tickets per home game and 750 for the UCLA game, since it is at the

Temporary tovvnie 
I knew it was true when the kind woman reached over the counter to hand me my bag ofnewly purchased home accessories. 
Her blue eyes youthfully pierced through her worn complex­

I had become a townie.

This year, however, things are a bit dif­ferent. 
I moved into my Saint Peter's Street abode-which idyllically resembles a gin­gerbread house -only to discover not only did having an off-campus residence mean no parietals or coin laundry but also an entire readjustment ofone's personal lifestyle. 
Never did I think I would call Family Dollar my favorite store, walking there sometimes twice each day, but I do. 
Never did I think I would live between both a lawyers' office and a mental reha­bilitation center, but I do. 
Never did I think I would wander bare­foot to my neighbors' or go to McDonald's twice in one day, but the thing is that I have. 
I paint beer pong tables a light blue hue in my backyard at all hours ofthe night. I witness neighborhood children fight in the 
U.S. volleyball association standard size sand volleyball court that is my back yard. 
I watch in awe as mullet-clad men race their pick-up trucks through the intricate alleyways that run parallel and perpendic­ularly near my home. 
My roommates and I have named the potentially problematic mouse that fre­quents our kitchen Stuart little, and we also stick our head out ofthe skylight that adorns the steep slope of our second floor roof. 
I have had a bungee-corded beach chair rest happily upon my roof and prayed that I would not become the stereotypical bankrupt college student, spending seem­ingly endless funds on bars, booze, bills and, ofcourse, new home decor. 
I can no longer assume the majority of my neighbors will be Midwestern Catholic girls, but I can anticipate the booming base echoing out ofmy neighbor's Chevy Impala each afternoon. 
Quick trips to the Grotto and late nights at Trumper are no longer done with ease, but neighborhood block parties and walks to Corby's are. 
I no longer walk the lakes, but rather run the East Race river path. 
Warm cookies and salad bars are no longer available at my first sign ofhunger, but a walk to Macri's and Mac and Cheese is. 
So it is true. Sometimes life as a townie is tough, rough and flat out crazy, but I am loving every minute of it. And ifyou are lucky enough, maybe someday you too can appreciate the fun times that come with being a townie -ifonly temporarily.

Killer raccoons terrorize pet dogs and cats 
OLYMPIA, Washington ­A fierce group of raccoons has killed 10 cats, attacked a small dog and bitten at least one pet owner who had to get rabies shots, res­idents of Olympia say. 
Some have taken to car­rying pepper spray to ward off the masked marauders and the woman who was bitten now carries an iron pipe when she goes outside at night. 
"It's a new breed," said Tamara Keeton, who with Kari Hall started a raccoon watch after an emotional neighborhood meeting drew 40 people. "They're urban raccoons, and they're not afraid."

"The new distribution machines were given to the school by USA Today due to our membership with them," Mcllduff said.

"There had been a problem in the past with faculty taking the papers before some stu­dents had a chance to get to them," Mcllduff said. 
Siefert said she is confident the new receptacles will meet the students' needs. 
"We wanted the student body to be able to have access to eurrent events to help with classes, as well as to become more informed with society," Siefert said. 
Funds were relocated to provide this service, Mcllduff said. "We want the students to know we have their interests in mind." 
"So far today we've had a really positive response from Saint Mary's women," Siefert said. 
Junior Carol Schaberg said she hopes "students take advantage of the program." 
"Having to use our student ID really directs the program to us and will hopefully let students realize that the papers are there for our bene­fit," Schaberg said. 
The newspapers will be available Monday through Friday at the Student Center, Madeleva Hall, Cushwa­Leighton Library and Le Mans Hall.

U.S.: Iranian proposal falls short 
WASHINGTON -The Bush administration said Wednesday a proposal by Iran for nuclear negotiations falls short of U.N. demands that it cease uranium enrichment, and the U.S. began plotting unspecified "next moves" with other governments. 
At the same time, Iran contended it had offered "positive and clear signals" to resolve the dispute over its nuclear program. 
Efforts by the U.S. and other nations could lead to U.N. sanctions against Iran unless it reverses course and agrees to a verifiable halt to enrichment activities that can be central to making nuclear weapons. France took a firm and quick stand on Iran's proposal. Foreign Minister Philippe Douste­Blazy said the Iranians must suspend uranium enrichment if they want to return to negotia­tions. 
Nigeria: Foreign hostages released 
LAGOS -An American and five other for­eigners kidnapped in Nigeria's southern oil region were released Wednesday, the govern­ment said.

Among those released was Royce Parfait, a commercial ship captain from Charleston, Tenn., who was abducted 10 days ago in during a raid on a nightclub by suspected militants. 
"I appreciate everything everybody's done for us. We're having champagne," Parfait told The Associated Press in a brief telephone inter­view.between Israel and Hezbollah. Diplomats are still trying to hammer out final details, including the peacekeeping force's precise responsibilities.

Beatty guilty in activist gunning 
CINCINNATI -A man who gunned down a community activist just steps from City Hall was found guilty Wednesday of voluntary manslaughter, a lesser charge than prosecutors wanted. 
Judge Norbert Nadel, hearing the case without a jury, said there was not enough evidence to support the more serious charge of aggravated murder against Howard Beatty, 52. 
"The evidence shows that Howard Beatty was provoked by Kabaka Oba into a sudden fit of rage," the judge said. 
Beatty was accused of shooting Oba in the leg, arm and chest shortly after the in the leg, arm and chest shortly after the targets.

Disabled children's center closes 
NEW ALBANY -Nearly half the students who were forced to transfer out of a southern Indiana development center have moved back home with their families, state officials said. 
State officials in May closed Silvercrest Children's Development Center, which had been open in the community just north of Louisville, Ky., since 1974. It had housed children with autism and other disabilities temporarily until they could be stabilized and return home. 
A state study recommended that the center be closed because it is too expensive and outdated and housed children for too long. 

GAZA STRIP 

Group admits to Gaza kidnapping 
Release of U.S. journalists promised upon liberation of Muslim prisoners 
Associated Press 

GAZA CITY An unknown militant group demanded the release of Muslim prisoners in U.S. jails within 72 hours in exchange for two kid­napped Fox News journal­ists, who were shown sit­ting cross-legged and bare­foot on the floor in a video released Wednesday. 
The video, which broke 10 days of silence from the kidnappers, marked the first time militants in Gaza have issued demands going beyond the conflict with Israel. The footage also had none of the trappings of locally produced videos, such as flags or masked gunmen, raising the possi­bility that foreign extrem­ists may have taken root in Gaza. 
Palestinian and Israeli officials say al-Qaida has been trying to infiltrate Gaza in the aftermath of Israel's withdrawal a year ago. The Egypt-Gaza bor­der is now rife with smug­gling tunnels, and Palestinian militant groups have blown up a border wall to allow people in and out of the area.

drop popcorn, a cup of noo­dles, pudding and peanuts in their brown paper bags. 
Another Shappell-Andrichik campaign promise launches today. The College Readership Program -made possible by a Student Activities Fee increase -will deliver 1,600 copies of the Chicago Tribune, the New York Times and USA Today to campus. 
The papers, available only to students, can be picked up in both dining halls, LaFortune Student Center and various other campus locations. 
"I really think this will improve the level of discussion both inside and outside the classroom amongst students," Shappell said. 
She encourages those who pick up a newspaper to pass it to friends and classmates or return it to the bin for others to use. 
Shappell plans to continue the work of last year's admin­istration, led by former student body president Dave Baron, to improve community relations between Notre Dame and South Bend. 
Student government kicked off the school year with two events designed to inform stu­dents about the city: the first­ever "Explore South Bend Tour" and the second annual off-campus student informa­tion fair Monday. 
Shappell and Andrichik hope to work with South Bend Mayor Steven Luecke and his office to promote events in South Bend and improve the general student perception of the city. 
"I think it really is about changing the culture of how we look at the South Bend community," Shappell said. 
plans discussed during his three years at Notre Dame that have never come into fruition. The duo wants to cultivate stu­dent-alumni connections long before they become vital dur­ing job searches. 
"We want to be able to not start student-alumni contact when one side needs the other as opposed to starting it a lot earlier on so it is a much stronger relationship," Andrichik said. 
To build these connections, Andrichik proposes student­alumni receptions before home football games this fall. He is also working with the Alumni Association and the Career Center to give students full access to Irish Online, an alumni networking website. 
This year, Shappell will sit as an ex officio member of the Alumni Board. She said it is essential that a student repre­sentative be present on the board to increase contact between alumni and current students. 
Shappell and Andrichik plan to bring speakers onto campus to address academic issues. The student government will sponsor the Catholic Think Tank of America lecture series, now in its second year. Shappell is also organizing a conference to discuss eating disorders, which will take place in February or March. 
Calling the plan "ambitious," she said it is important that, as a top-20 Catholic university, Notre Dame searches for a way to prevent this disease. 
"We want to ask more press­ing questions, looking at what creates an environment con­ducive to eating disorders," Shappell said. 
Other bullets on the agenda include improving seating availability for students at foot­ball game pep rallies and using classified ads on insideND for book and ticket exchanges.

"We think we have found a way to preserve this benefit to students," Berlo said. "It's important to us that if you can't attend you can utilize that ticket for someone who is close to you." 
In other Senate news: 
+ College Readership Program organizer Chris Harris reminded senators that CRP will launch today. He said about 400 papers will be avail­able at each of four spots on campus (South Dining Hall, North Dining Ilall, LaFortune and near the Joyce Center parking lot). 
Student government leaders will be wearing and handing out "Stay Connected" t-shirts to help advertise the new pro­gram, which is funded by a $15 Student Activities Fee increase. 
+ Student body president Lizzi Shappell, student body vice president Bill Andrichik and chief executive assistant Liz Brown updated senators on progress they made during the summer months. 
Shappell said she has been working on an eating disor­ders conference slated for sec­ond semester. Shappell's focus this fall will be working with the South Bend Common Council to make changes to the recently-revised South Bend disorderly house ordinance. 

Andrichik told members about his work on adding new items to Grab and Go and get­ting students access to Goirish, an alumni networking Web site. 
Brown sat on a committee that selected new channels for the cable network in dorm rooms. Her committee made recommendations, but those have not been finalized.

IN BRIEF 
Concerns plague livestock ID project 
KANSAS CITY, Mo -U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns assured livestock owners Wednesday that information collect­ed in a planned animal identification pro­gram will be kept confidential and used only in the event of a disease outbreak. 
Speaking before a conference on animal identification technology and policy, Johanns sought to downplay concerns that farm information collected through the pro­gram could fall into the hands of competi­tors, animal rights activists or other mem­bers of the public. 
He said private vendors would collect and maintain the data, making it off-limits to federal open-records laws, a concern that has led officials in some states, such as Vermont, to put their own data-collection efforts on hold. 
"It is not data that is controlled and owned by the USDA, so we can protect confidential­ity," Johanns said in response to a question from the audience. 
Johanns' assurances held little water with some of the 30 protesters picketing outside the meeting. They said the program violated their property rights, would cost too much and is aimed at helping large-scale produc­ers who want to sell their livestock over­seas. 

Stocks fall on weak housing numbers 
NEW YORK -Wall Street fell for a third straight session Wednesday as fresh signs of a housing slump triggered concerns that the economy is slowing too fast and could erode corporate profits. 
Investors believed that housing sales might be dropping more rapidly than antici­pated, and theorized that a soft landing for the U.S. economy might be more difficult to achieve. The report from the National Association of Realtors that sales of previ­ously owned homes dropped in July to a pace of 6.33 million units, the lowest since January 2004. 
The data comes after a Federal Reserve official hinted Tuesday that higher interest rates may still be needed to tame inflation, a move that could curtail consumer spending. 

Businesses relocate post-Katrina 
New Orleans entrepreneurs set up elsewhere; many have no plans to return home 
Associated Press 
Christine McAtee hopes to go back to New Orleans some day, but for the fore­seeable future, The Woodlands, Texas, is where she'll live and run her marketing firm. McAtee, owner of Adventures in Advertis in gil n sign i a Marketing, is one of thou­sands of small business owners forced to leave the city ravaged by Hurricane Katrina and start over someplace else. 
The storm left water in McAtee's home and her office, but the dampness that pervaded everything was just as destructive, damaging files and leaving computers inoperable. And with the city paralyzed, it was clear it would be hard for McAtee to rebuild her company and take care of her two children. 
There were awful moments as she salvaged what she could: "You think, this can't b('l hap­pening, when you slip and fall in the grime and you're covered with who knows what and there's no run­ning water to wash it off with."

Ford announces production cuts 
Associated Press 
Hundreds of workers at Indiana's auto parts plants could face layoffs as a ripple effect of production cuts by Ford Motor Co. 
More than 800 workers at Muncie's BorgWarner Automotive plant may be put on a weeklong furlough begin­ning Sunday, and layoffs in the Chicago area could affect workers living in northwestern Indiana. 
Ford last week announced deep production cuts designed to bring its supply of vehicles in line with wither­ing demand for its biggest sellers ­pickups and SUVs. Ford said it will temporary shut down 10 assembly plants across North America through the end of this year to cut its fourth­quarter production by 21 percent. 

Indiana is home to many automo­tive suppliers, some of which do busi­ness with Ford. 
"I know from conversatirms with suppliers that some are going to take 15 to 20 percent revenue hits" as a result of Ford's cuts, said Kevin Reale, research director for AMR Research, an industry consulting company. 
The biggest hit in Indiana looked to be at BorgWarner, which makes transmission transfer cases for Ford 4-wheel-drive F-150 pickup trucks and Explorer and Navigator sport utility vehicles. 
Some 840 hourly workers were 
told last week the plant would shut down for one week, but Doug Owenby, vice president of operations, said Tuesday the layoff notice might have been premature. 
"At this point, we are re-evaluating it based on new information from customer releases and demand," Owenby said. 
Owenby acknowledged that the Ford cuts would be a "significant blow" to the Muncie plant. 
Though Indiana has no Ford assembly plants, many northwestern Indiana residents work at a Chicago assembly plant targeted for tempo­rary shutdown and a stamping plant in Chicago Heights, Ill., that produces body panels for that plant.

SOMALIA 

Islan1ic n1ilitia reopens seaport 
Associated Press 
MOGADISHU -The seaport in the Somali capital reopened Wednesday for the first time in 11 years, the latest sign that the city's Islamic fundamentalist rulers are trying to restore confi­dence after more than a decade of anarchy. 
Mogadishu International Seaport still must undergo dra­matic renovations after so many years of disuse but it is ready to receive commercial traffic, said Sheik Abdulkadir Ali Omar, a member of the Islamic militia that has taken control of the cap­ital and much of southern Somalia in recent months. 
"From today on, the port is open and the world can send its goods here," Omar said, adding that a formal opening ceremony will be held Thursday. 
The seaport has not been oper­ational since 1995, when United Nations forces left Somalia by sea and air amid political and clan-based violence. The coun­try's last effective central govern­ment was toppled in 1991 by rival warlords who then turned on each other. 
The port and area its sur­rounds were controlled by rival warlords whose militias prevent­ed its use. Businessmen and aid agencies used a smaller port out­side the capital, with the risk that imported goods and those for export might simply disap­pear. 
"We are notifying the Somali people, especially businessmen, to use the seaport to ship their goods around the world," said Omar Wehliye, the newly named manager of the port. 
Mogadishu's international air­port, closed more than 10 years, reopened a month ago. Flights have been coming in and leaving the airport daily, but it was not immediately clear how much traffic the seaport would get. Somalia still has no coast guard or navy, and pirate attacks are frequent off the country's lawless coast. 


School drops SAT requirements 
Associated Press 
McLEAN, Va.-George Mason University is becoming one of the nation's first four-year pub­lic universities to drop the SAT and other standardized tests from its admissions require­ments for certain students. 
High school seniors with at least a 3.5 grade-point average and who are in the top 20 per­cent of their class won't have to submit an SAT or ACT score with their application beginning this year, said dean of admis­sions Andrew Flagel. 
The school, after a three-year review, concluded that SAT scores are a poor indicator of collegiate success for high­achieving high school students. 
Applicants who don't have a 

3.5 GPA will still be required to submit a test score. Students who want to play intercollegiate sports also must submit test scores because the NCAA uses them to help determine eligibili­ty. 
Dozens of private schools have stopped requiring applicants to take the SAT or ACT amid con­cerns the tests are not accurate gauges of an applicant's poten­tial for success. 
Among public schools, howev­er, George Mason's stance is somewhat unique. 
A number of public universi­ties, including the University of Texas, guarantee admission to students who achieve a certain grade-point average or class rank in high school, negating the need to submit an SAT or ACT. 
At George Mason, applicants who do not submit an SAT or ACT score will still be evaluated by the admissions committee and must submit two additional letters of recommendation. 
The SAT has come under fire in recent years from critics who feel it is overemphasized and is biased against minorities. However, George Mason, with one of the most diverse student bodies in the nation, found that the SAT was a weak predictor for all races when applied to students with high GPAs. Flagel said racial and minority issues had nothing to do with the school's decision. 
Caren Scoropanos, a spokes­woman for the College Board, which administers the SAT test, said that both grade-point aver­ages and SAT scores can be good predictors of collegiate success, but that evaluating both is the best way to gauge an applicant's prospects. 


Bio con1pany creates alternative sten1 cells 
Opponents still not satisfied with method 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -In an innova­tive move, a biotech company has found a new way of mak­ing stem cells without destroy­ing embryos, touting it as a way to defuse one of the coun­try's fiercest political and ethi­cal debates. 
Some opponents of the research said the method still doesn't satisfy their objections and many stem cell scientists and their supporters called it inefficient and politically wrong-headed. 
But a spokeswoman for President Bush, who vetoed legislation last month that would have allowed federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, called it a step in the right direction. 
And Dr. Robert Lanza, an executive with Advanced Cell Technology, which created the new stem cell lines, said: "This will make it far more difficult to oppose this research." 
Stem cells haye become a Holy Grail for advocates of patients with a wide variety of illnesses because of the cells' potential to transform into any type of human tissue, perhaps leading to new treatments. But the Vatican, President Bush and others have argued that the promise of stem cells should not be realized at the expense of human life, even in its most nascent stages. 
The new method works by taking an embryo at a very early stage of development and removing a single cell, which can be coaxed into spawning an embryonic stem cell line. With only one cell removed, the rest of the embryo retains its full potential for develop­ment. 
The method was described online Wednesday in the British journal Nature. The journal published a similar paper by Advanced Cell Technology last year demon­strating the technique's viabili­ty in mice. 
"The science is interesting and important," said John Harris, a professor of bioethics at the University of Manchester in Great Britain, commenting on the biotech company's efforts. 
But few believe it will resolve the bitter ethical battle over stem cell research. 
"This will please no one," predicted a longtime critic of the company, Glenn McGee, director of the Alden March Bioethics Institute in Albany, N.Y. 
Some stem cell researchers complain that the new approach, though it may hold future promise, simply isn't as efficient as their current method of creating stem cells. That procedure involves the destruction of embryos after about five days of develop­ment, when they consist of about 100 cells. 
Meanwhile, hard-line oppo­nents of stem cell science argue that the technique solves nothing, because even the sin­gle cell removed by the new approach could theoretically grow into a full-fledged human. Some also object over the possibility the procedure could harm the embryo in an unknown way. 
The method "raises more ethical questions than it 
answers,"  said  Richard  
Doerflinger  of  the  U.S.  
Conference  of  Catholic  
Bishops.  

U.S. law currently bans fed­eral funding of any research that harms human embryos. A White House spokeswoman said the method's eligibility for funding could not yet be deter­mined, "but it is encouraging to see scientists at least mak­ing serious efforts to move away from research that involves the destruction of embryos." 
President Bush has said that he personally opposes any research that sacrifices embry­onic life, even to save an exist­ing person. In August 2001 the president limited federal fund­ing to research on a few dozen stem cell lines that had been created up to that point.

rape count increases 
Associated Press 
KHARTOUM -More than 200 women have been raped in a refugee camp in Darfur in the past five weeks, a sign of the worsening humanitarian crisis in the violence-wracked Sudanese region, an aid group said Wednesday. 
The increased violence came as the U.N. Security Council discussed a draft resolution to replace an understaffed African Union peacekeeping force with a larger, more effec­tive U.N. mission in Darfur, where more than 200,000 peo­ple have been killed since 2003. 
The number of rapes in Kalma camp -one of Darfur's largest with about 100,000 refugees have been targeted in intereth­nic conflicts as a deliberate form of humiliation of a group, and as a means of ethnic cleansing." 
Violence flared three years ago in Darfur when ethnic African tribes revolted against the Arab-led Sudanese govern­ment. Khartoum is accused of having unleashed in response a paramilitary group known as the janjaweed that have been blamed for much of the atroci­ties. 
Measuring the violence in the vast, arid Darfur region has long been notoriously dillicult, with pro-government armed groups and rebel factions often barring access to international observers, and Khartoum pro­

"This is a massive spike in figures. We are used to hearing of two to four incidents of sex­ual assault per month in Kalma camp," said Kurt Tjossem of the rescue commit­tee. 
The group did not specify who committed the rapes. Refugees in the past have accused pro-government jan­jaweed militia of harassing them. 
The aid group's statement echoed a report issued by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan a day earlier that said there were thousands of documented cases of women and children abducted for forced labor or forced sex. 
"Grave violence against women in Darfur continues to worsen," Annan said. "Girls Walid Moallem, in Helsinki. Finland holds the rotating presidency of the European Union. 
Lebanon has land borders only with Syria and Israel. 
Syria's throat to dose its bor­der and Israel's resolve to con­tinuo tho blockade were among the burgeoning hurdles facing Lebanon as it struggled to meet key requirements of the U.N. resolution: deployment of 15,000 L<1banese soldiers south for the first time in four decades and stiffening control on all borders. 
Saniora said his government was making "every effort" to secure the bordnrs, but Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni questionnd the pace. 
"Time is working against those who would like to see this resolution applied," Livni told rnporters after talks in Paris with French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy. "We are now in the most sensi­tivn and explosive position." 
Several incidents erupted along the lsrael-Lnbanon bor­der Wednesday, with the killing of three Lebaneso and one Israoli soldier by exploding ordnance, tlH1 capture of two Lnbanese men in an army raid, and the resumption of sporadic shelling by lsranli forces in the disputed Chebaa Farms. 
Olmnrt told Secretary of State Condoloezza Hiee by phone that the international force must arrive as soon as possi­ble, so the sea and air blockade could be called off, his office said. 
Syria -a llezbollah benefac­tor largely left out of diplomacy during the 34-day war _ appeared to insert itself Wednesday. 
Syrian President Bashar Assad called any deployment of multinational troops along his border a "hostile" affront to Syria. 
"First, this means creating hostile conditions between Syria and Lebanon," Assad told Dubai Television in an inter­view aired Wednesday. "Second, it is a hostile move toward Syria and naturally it will create problems." 
The Aug. 11 U.N. resolution that halted fighting three days later called for the internation­al reinforcements to arrive in Lebanon, but some have com­plained the mandate was fuzzy. 
The additional peacekeepers were to augment the 2,000­strong U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, deploy south of the Litani River, 18 miles from the Israeli bor­der, and open fire only in defense of themselves and civil­ians. 
"The Israelis cannot ask UNIFIL to disarm Ilezbollah. This is not written in our man­date," French Maj. Gen. Alain Pellegrini, the UNIFIL com­mander, told reporters at force headquarters in Naqoura, Lebanon.. 
Pellegrini said the cease-fire "is tense, very fragile, very volatile ... Any provocation or misunderstanding could esca­late very, very rapidly." 
Many countries appeared wary of joining without safe­guards to ensure they don't get sucked into a new Mideast con­flict.

Karr's family seeks top lawyer 
Relatives of JonBenet Ramsey's alleged killer insist he is innocent 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -John Mark Karr's relatives offered up the book and film rights to the fam­ily's story Wednesday in hopes of raising money for a high­powered attorney to defend Karr against charges that he killed 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey. 
"They're not looking for money for themselves," said Larry Garrison, a producer the family hired to represent them in media deals. "They're look­ing to support John's boys' col­lege education and to make sure all legal fees are covered." 
Karr remained in a Los Angeles jail Wednesday after­noon awaiting transfer to Colorado, where JonBenet was killed in her Boulder home in December 1996. 
Garrison told The Associated Press that no money had changed hands yet with the Karrs, and he didn't want to go into details about the agree­ment. Karr's brother, Nate Karr, confirmed that Garrison is now representing the family. 
Karr told reporters in Thailand last week that he was present when JonBenet died and that her death was an acci­dent. He did not specifically say he killed her, and Boulder pros­ecutors have not disclosed their evidence against him. 
His family has insisted Karr was in Georgia during the Christmas week that JonBenet was killed. 
Georgia attorney Gary Harris, who had represented Karr's father and brother in recent days, has said the family found a photo from Christmas 1996 showing Karr's three sons at a dinner in Atlanta. Karr is not in the photo, but the family insists that if the boys were there, Karr would have been too. 
"John Karr wasn't working," Harris said. "He couldn't afford to buy a MARTA (Atlanta public transportation) or bus ticket, much less plane fare to Colorado." 
A family photo has been turned over to Boulder authori­ties, but Garrison could not say what it shows. 
"I can tell you they proclaim his innocence," Garrison said. 'They feel he was not there at the time, that some of the state­ments made by the press are absurd." 
Harris told the AP on Wednesday that as far as the family knows, the only time Karr was ever in Colorado was in 2001 when his car broke down on a trip from Alabama to California with his then-wife and children. He said the fami­ly got the car ftxed and moved on. 
Harris said he thinks Karr claimed involvement in JonBenet's death because he is ill. 
"Obviously, this guy has some mental problems," he said. "He obviously has some emotional problems. He's always had some." 
Harris declined to be more specific but said he has no knowledge of Karr ever seeing a psychiatrist. He also noted that the family lost touch with Karr five years ago. 
"We don't know what hap­pened in the last five years because they hadn't talked to him," Harris said. "They thought he was dead." 
A psychiatrist has met with Karr twice since he was brought to Los Angeles County's Twin Towers jail Sunday night after a flight from Thailand, said sheriff's Lt. George Vanecek. At the jail, deputies were looking in on Karr every 15 minutes. 
Harris told the AP on Wednesday that, because of a difference of opinion, he no longer is representing Karr's father Wexford and brother Nate. He said he now repre­sents only Michael Karr, anoth­er brother of John Karr, and his wife. 
Harris would not disclose the reason for the split, but sug­gested it had something to do with Wexford and Nate Karr's desire to sell the family story. 
"My clients are not seeking any book deals or anything of that nature," Harris said of Michael Karr and his wife. ''I'll let you deduce what you want from that. My clients are not looking to make any money ofl' of this." 
Karr agreed Tuesday not to fight extradition to Colorado. In a two-minute court appear­ance, his expression changed only once when he slowly closed his eyes as the judge recited the count of lirst-degree murder that Boulder prosecu­tors included in an arrest war­rant. 
Karr "has been portrayed by the media as of late as being mentally unstable, attention­seeking, unwell, mentally unwell. And he is none of those things," said attorney Jamie Harmon, who spoke with Karr in jail and attended Tuesday's hearing. 
He "is anxious to have an opportunity to address the alle­gations against him, to be por­trayed in a more accurate and complete way," Harmon said.

Dissent plagues the Christian Coalition 
Alabama, Iowa and Ohio chapters leave national organization 
Associated Press 
Three disgruntled state affili­ates have severed ties with the Christian Coalition of America, one of the nation's most power­ful conservative groups during the 1990s but now buffeted by complaints over finances, lead­ership and its plans to veer into nontraditional policy areas. 
"It's a very sad day for our people, but a liberating day," said John Giles, president of the coalition's Alabama chapter, which announced Wednesday that it was renaming itself and splitting from the national organization. The Iowa and Ohio chapters took similar steps this year. 
Giles said he and his Alabama colleagues have 
directions. 
"We're going to have a new mission, a new vision -much more broad-focused," she said. "They don't like some of the comments I've made about the environment and some of these other issues." 
The coalition, which claims more than 2 million members, was founded in 1989 by reli­gious broadcaster Pat Robertson and became politically powerful under Executive Director Ralph Reed before he left in 1997. Robertson, who turned over the presidency to Combs in 2002, has been criticized for provoca­tive public statements, while Reed lost an election in Georgia last month after being linked to disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. 
Jim Backlin, the coalition's vice president for legislative affairs, said the Reed situation harmed the organization because of heavy media cover­

Giles predicted further defec­tions and said the coalition was now left with only a half-dozen strong state chapters and a weak presence in Washington. 
"In our prime, we were rated the seventh-most powerful lob­bying organization in the coun­try," he said. "Now, there's not even any blip on the radar screen." 
At its peak, the coalition had a presence in every state, but in some cases a modest one. 
The coalition's president, Roberta Combs, insisted her organization -which is $1 mil­lion in debt -would survive the defections, and was unapolo­getic about her interest in new offices always look 
for Christian Coalition support right away when trying to get their bosses' legislation passed," he said. 
On the political left, an activist who monitors conservative organizations said the coalition never recovered from Reed's departure -with its staff and annual budget shrinking. 
"They've been in free-fall ever since," said Peter Montgomery of the liberal group People for the American Way. "It's not sur­prising that local affiliates want to distance themselves from this floundering organization." 
Steve Scheffler, who led the breakaway of the coalition's Iowa chapter in March, blamed Combs herself for much of the friction, saying she didn't treat the heads of the state affiliates with respect.

Between their normal routines of pray­ing, archery lessons, and flagpolcd-under­pants pranks, numerous Christian camps across the country are now incorporating "a science curriculum about God's Creation" into their 
summertime activities, says a recent Newsweek article. One educational director  James Dechant Foregone Conclusion  
says the aim is to give  

the kids enough of a background in the idea that, going back to school and learn­ing about evolution, they will think, "Oh, that sounds goofY!" 
Wild-eyed fanatics like these, spouting their subversive fundamentalist views, arc going to destroy this country's technologi­cal gravitas as our youth turn away from the study of sciences and revert baek to ignorant, primitive religions. Or at least that's what some left-wingers would have you believe. 
The article also covered atheist-spon­sored camps practicing the same indoctri­nation with the opposing goal. Some fun­damentalist Christians would in turn argue that atheist scientists like these, bent on corrupting the moral character of our children, are hypnotizing them to reject God and luring them to revel in a libertine lifestyle of devilry and hedonism. Which is, of course, equally ridiculous. 
Why all the fervor over educational con­tent? Had parents always taken this strong an interest in their children's edu­cation, we might see fewer high-school dropouts, decreased gang activity, and a mainstream spike in studiousness. The evolution debate is being played out large­ly by myopic adults, while the children too often resemble chess pieces in some larger conflict. 
For some reason, many uncompromis­ing believers cannot accept, or refuse to accept, over a century of rigorous scientif­ic inquiry. Admittedly, scientific thought

itself demands wild guesses, un-testablc theories, and acceptance of certain tenets or laws-in short, it's just another system of faith. Heligion should recognize this afiinity and not see scinnee as a threat which undnrmines its own faith. 
I leads arn particularly hard in my home state of Kansas. At a Board of Education evolution hearing in 2005, board member Kathy Martin boldly dedared: "Evolution has been proven false." It has, Ms. Martin? Where was I when they announced this? She perceives evolution-"an unproven, often disproven" theory, she said in further comments-as an implicit attack on her beliefs, and she is not alone. Ergo the intense controversy and either/or choices thrust upon children. 
The downside of this entirn dispute, however, is not that children will be swayed one way or the other. When was the last time you contemplated the origins of the species? Heally, how often does that come up? Now I know, personally, I like to start ofl' my day with orange juice, cereal, and ruminations on the liner points of Darwinian survivalism, but I thought I was the only one. I Ionestly, this issue seldom arises as a tense conversation between high school students, or adults for that matter. It's one of those three-in-the­morning questions, but not something that affects our daily lives. 
Yes, this may come as a shock to some people: students who miss out on the study of evolution are not going to be rationally handicapped for the rest of their educational careers. They will not be socially stunted or unable to gain accept­ance to the college of their dreams. Similarly, kids who learn about evolution are not going to have their spirituality stripped away and their faith annihilated by the unforgiving embrace of atheistic science. Too often the extremist enclaves in our country, a country still trying to define its moral nature, try to argue that 
WE ARE NOW PREPARED TO HAVE SERIOUS TALKS ABOUT OUR NUCLEAR PROGRAM 
one of these apocalyptic scenarios will be 
the long-term consequence of a high 
school biology class. 
The danger, instead, lies in that children arn being trained to think that religion and science cannot co-exist. The Religious and the Scientific realms become naturally repulsive of each other, allowing room lor no crossover. The secular sphere is always afraid of encroachment by domineering rnligious forces, and vice-versa. Children are eaught in the middle. 
Why should we pass on to the next gen­eration the rabid and uncompromising views of obsessed scientists or fanatical religious? The Pat Robertsons and the Felix Hoenikkers of this world should not be dictating what our children will learn. Evolution need not be seen as a threat to Christianity. Pursuing secular or scientific studies should not preclude anyone from fully practicing their religious faith. 
The tension between these realms reverberates internally and externally. We are all familiar with this conflict, especially at this University. Yet here I fmd encour­agement. Many of us have learned that our faiths and our scientific pursuits do not have to be mutually exclusive. I hesi­tate to say we have learned to "balance" science and religion, because neither should have to be compromised. Science can describe the how, but it cannot address the why. The why-this "ulti­mate concern" -is what believers ought to engage and affirm. 
Then science could focus on the really important questions, such as, how do they get 1,000 chips in every bag?

Innocent bystanders 
This summer, I was supposed to spend a month studying at the University of Balamand, an Orthodox Christian uni­versity in northern Lebanon with a mis­sion to spread tolerance, human dignity and Christian-Muslim understanding through the Middle East region. 
Unfortunately, two weeks into the pro­gram, increasing hos­tilities between Hezbollah militants and the Israeli army turned the small Middle Eastern nation into a battle­ground. 
Fighting broke out the same day my classmates and I left for a planned weekend excursion into Syria -though we were blissfully unaware of the chaos around us until we reached a Syrian passport control officer who gave us the news. We left the University at 5 a.m., crossing the border not long before the road we had been driving on was bombed by Israeli fighter jets. I spent the next six days outside Damascus, unable to re-enter Lebanon and without most of my pos­sessions, before flying home two weeks earlier than I had planned. 
I returned home to almost a hero's welcome, with family, friends and acquaintances telling me how they'd prayed for my safe return and newspa­per and TV reporters clamoring to interview me. 
But I hadn't done anything other than stay in a hotel a few days longer than expected. The real heroes were back in the Middle East. 
Several Balamand students and facul­ty members acted as "facilitators" of my study program, which was open to peo­ple from all over North and South America but included mostly Mexicans and Canadians. Some of these Lebanese students were scheduled to graduate in late July (a ceremony that was quickly scrapped when the war began). In the meantime, they had decided to give up their summers at home to stay at school helping foreigners navigate their coun­try, acting as interpreters, tour guides, and friends. They showed us around the

laws such as: "It is 
Oklahoma

illegal to have sex 
Daily

before you are mar­ried" and "Oral sex is a misdemeanor and is punishable by one year in jail and a $2,500 fine." 
The fact that these laws are still in the books and at some point made it onto the State Congressional floor is beyond my comprehension of a sup­posed freedom-giving Constitution. 
Then again, it makes sense if one actually takes the time to think about our freedom in the United States. 
Who cares if we can't marry whomever we want, smoke whatever kind of "cigarettes" we prefer, or import turtles from Bangladesh? 
At least we can still drive Hummers and watch Laguna Beach until our ears begin to ooze the last sense of reason and self-respect we had left. 
If the laws I stated above seem to be numerous historic, cultural and reli­gious sites that dot the Lebanese coun­tryside, proudly pointing out ancient landmarks and beautiful new buildings that arose after the civil war of the 1970s and 80s. Between classes and touring we watched the World Cup together, cheering in four languages for players from around the globe. 
When we foreigners went to Syria, many of the facilitators came, finding themselves separated from -and oftentimes unable to contact -their friends and families as the bombing in Lebanon intensified. Yet, even as they stared in disbelief at television images of explosions in their newly rebuilt capi­tal city, they continued to make our safety and transport home their top pri­ority. Hospitable even in the worst of times, they seemed determined to make our stay in the region pleasant even while it exploded around them. 
One Balamand senior, a man named Jad, was unable to get a hold of anyone in his home town for days after Israeli rockets knocked out a nearby cell phone tower. One night I saw him, after yet another unsuccessful attempt to get through, sitting in dejection on the stairs in front of our hotel. When he saw me coming, however, he twisted his face into a smile and turned his atten­tion to me. Had I called my parents? Was I scared? Was I excited about visit­ing some nearby ruins? This man, who for all he knew could have had his home destroyed, was most interested in my feelings and my well-being. 
Pierre, a Balamand faculty member who was especially close to English speaking students like me, had an opportunity to leave-an available plane ticket from Damascus to Athens, to the safety of his girlfriend's home in Greece. He didn't take it. He stayed with his old friends from Balamand and his new friends, the foreigners he had escorted to Syria. 
Greater even than the selflessness they showed was their love for their homeland. Every single Balamand stu­dent and faculty member with me in Syria quickly decided that they would return to Lebanon only when they saw their guests safely out of harm. There was a commitment even as the Israelis decimated the country that everything would be rebuilt again, not just as it was, but better. 

This commitment was shared not just by those born in Lebanon, but also by those who made it their adopted coun­try. Alejandro, an Argentinian-born seminary student who signed up to help the foreign students because he was one of the few people at Balamand who could translate between Arabic and Spanish, held an Argentinian passport, with which he could be on the other side of the world with ease. But he did­n't use it. Soon after I came home, he returned to Lebanon to continue his journey to the priesthood in his now war-torn, adopted country. 
Lebanon is a peace-loving nation, a country that had only recently finished rebuilding from its horrible civil war. Its fledgling democratic government was finally on its feet after years of med­dling by the Syrians. Tourists from around the world were flocking to its beaches and historic and religious sites. 
Then the small nation found itself caught between a terrorist militia it couldn't control and a vengeful neigh­bor it couldn't stop. 
And so Lebanon became a battle­ground once again, another huge rebuilding task looming once the death and destruction end. And once again its selfless, generous people will pick up the pieces and try to make their country the peaceful, prosperous place they all know it can be. 
And then foreigners won't be the only ones who can go home to safety.

The root cause of dumb laws 
outdated and trivial, take a moment to think about the legislation banning homosexual marriage. 
It has always been beyond my intel­lectual capacity to understand why anyone, much less the state, is con­cerned with another person's sex life. 
To me, it is not a matter of protecting the sanctity of marriage, but instead a fight to protect the sanctity of igno­rance-ignorance supported and enforced by governmental and reli­gious sanction. 
As I understand it, it is easier to con­trol people if they don't think for them­selves. 
And besides, thinking for yourself can get you into all kinds of trouble, as well as stick you with this horrible thing called accountability. 
I admit that life would be much easi­er and much more peaceful if we didn't have to make our own decisions as to what is right. 
If people were allowed to reason for themselves, our country wouldn't have so many volumes of laws that combat just that: personal choice and account­ability. 
The contempt that those in power show to questioning individuals is a testament to our lack of faith in each other and the necessity for the blind obedience a micro-managing bureau­cracy such as ours requires. 

Despite what your parents, elemen­tary school teacher and youth minister have implied with their meatless "answers," asking questions is not against the rules. If something doesn't make sense, we shouldn't be afraid to investigate until our own sense of rea­son is satisfied. 
Treating the symptoms, instead of the issue by creating freedom-stunting laws represents the public opinion that people are inherently bad and inca­pable of reason and self-control. 
It accuses each of us of the crimes of our fellow citizen. 
Our myriad laws do not solve the problems they profess but instead limit the freedom that should rationally be ours. 
Does a Jaw such as "It is illegal to wear your boots to bed" really impede freedom, or is it just a ridiculous waste of time? 
I would have to say it is both -and one is a direct result of the other. 
When legislators waste their time and our tax money counteracting "destructive" behavior, they increase, or at the least sustain, the need for said tax money. By taking our money in taxes, they limit our economic free­dom. 
Maybe that is why laws such as this one are still on the books: because leg­islators don't want to waste their time and ours to prove that the government feels it is their right to micro-manage our lives. 
For those of you who disagree with me, ask yourself why. 
In saying this, I am not implying that you are wrong: If you have a reason based on your own sense of rationale and not on the ideas fed to you by an ancient book or another person, I would have to agree that you are right 
Not right in the traditional sense­that others should agree with you based on historical data you have "analyzed" -but right in a way that you should agree with what reason and common sense leads you to believe.

CD REVIEWS 

AFI's latest looks from 'December' to new year 
By MARTY SCHROEDER Assistant Scene Editor 
Any band that has been around for a decade and a half faces the problem of musical growth. This does not necessari­ly mean being able to please people with the latest album, it means balancing what the band thinks is the right direc­tion and what the fans think is the right direction. 
More so with punk than other genres, a legion of hardcore fans can about-face and call a band 'corporate', a 'sell-out' and other such admonishing titles that leave them out in the cold with no main­stream support and little of its original fan base. Or, conversely, the band can do exactly as it pleases without regard to anyone. 
This attitude -that the music is more for artists and if the fans like it, great, if not, well they shouldn't buy the record -has defined the band AFI (A Fire Inside) in recent years. AFI released its seventh album "Decemberunderground" amid talk of yet another shift in its career. After humble beginnings as hardcore punks with "Answer That and Stay Fashionable" and "Very Proud of Ya," the first shift began to occur. AFI 

2.0 started with 1997's "Shut Your Mouth & Open Your Eyes." This album introduced an AFI that was less punk rock and more a band in the vein of The Misfits. 
Dark, brooding and morose lyrics began to surface and the band was fre­quently seen wearing black. This culmi­nated with what many consider to be the peak of its career, "The Art of Drowning" (2000). This album also marked the beginnings of its success outside the usu­ally tight-lipped punk circles and into a wider audience. 
"The Art of Drowning" was also the last album AFI released with the inde­pendent label Nitro Hecords and the beginning of its relationship with Dreamworks. "Sing the Sorrow" (2003) was its major label debut and saw many new fans enter the scene, while many of the old guard left in disgust with the directions the band was taking. After this whirlwind, the latest installment arrived -"Decemberunderground" on Interscope Records.

Journey immortalized "Don't Stop Believin"' over two decades ago. And while many have adopted this mantra ­including the 2005 World Series Champion Chicago White Sox -perhaps no one has kept believing as much as Journey itself. 
Founded in 1973 by former members of Santana, Journey became immensely pop­ular in the 1980s with hit singles such as "Open Arms" and "Wheel in the Sky." 
The band's album "Escape" hit number one on the charts in August of 1981 and reached platinum nine times. One of their Escape shows, on Nov. 6, 1981 in Houston, was recorded and aired on MTV and has been recently released in DVD/CD format.

energy that clearly roused the Texas crowd on that November night. Perry is joined by Neal Schon on guitar, Hoss Valory on bass, Steve Smith on the drums and Jonathan Cain playing the keyboards. 
Cain's role in the show is paramount because his piano notes have the ability to perfectly mimic Perry's vocal range, most notably on the eponymous l"irst song. When he starts the show, Perry exudes boyish energy and sets the tone for a non­stop barrage of high vocals and guitar riffs. 
Many of the songs on the DVD an'l more unknown and even some unreleased Journey tunes like "Lights" and "Dead or Alive," but there are plenty of favorites such as "Open Arms," "Don't Stop Believin'," "Wheel in the Sky" and "Any Way You Want It." 
There are some lesser known hits later in the disc including "Who's Crying Now" and a Jonathan Cain piano solo. The con­cert ends with songs that are more famil­iar and loved by most audiences.

"Brick," like the other successful movies of the "high school drama" genre, achieves this goal by taking the world of the film noir detec­tive stories and 
deftly applying it to Brick from his ex-girl­a high school set­

figurative. The kids in "Brick" take everything seriously, because the events of the plot actually are serious. 
The seriousness of the movie produces both enjoyment and entertainment, as opposed to bearing it down, and writer/director Rian Johnson uses this aspect to his full advantage.Referencing and using dialogue in the style of "Maltese Falcon," "Blue Velvet" and "Chinatown" is inherently funny as well as fascinating to hear. 
He successfully translated all of the archetypes present in these types of film to those of high school characters. "Brick" has representatives of several archetypes, including the reluctant anti­hero, informants, femme fatales and plenty of 1930s slang and shady charac­ters. 
More eye-opening than anything, it is interesting to see how easily the students in the film fit into these roles. As everyone knows, there is no one more shady than high school drug dealers -so really, it is not much of a stretch. 
Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, "1 0 Things I Hate About You") is an outsider at his Southern California high school, not because he lacks good looks or athletic ability, but because he has chosen the lone wolf lifestyle. He is forced into action when he receives a strange phone call 
The mystery of 

her death unfolds in a complicated story that involves the school's toughest thugs and their hired goons, and Brendan trudges from one situation to another in his quest for truth. 
In the grand tradition of these films, the audience is left in the dark too, learning the truth only as quickly as Brendan him­self discovers it. 
Brendan is eventually led to The Pin (an adult Lukas Hass, who passes for a teenager), easily the most entertaining character in the movie, who runs his drug business from the basement of his par­ents' home. He also goes back and forth, working with and against Laura (Nora Zehetner of television's "Everwood"), the literal teenage drama queen. 
Johnson's smartest move is that the kids do not appear to know they are in a detective story. They are not talking in

(especially in the scenes featuring Perkins), demonstrating Hitchcock's mastery of shadow and darkness. 
The only scene that really doesn't work is an overly expository conclusion that features a psychiatrist whose only purpose is to explain exactly what hap­pened. It's difficult to believe that Hitchcock wanted this scene as he was never known for insulting his audience's intelligence. Thankfully, its presence doesn't fully detract from the greatness of the film. 
"Psycho" is in many ways the pinnacle of Hitchcock's career, checking in at No. 18 on the American Film Institute's list of the Greatest Films of All Time. When it was released back in 1960, it conclud­ed a fruitful and productive decade for the director, a period which included masterpieces such as "Strangers on a Train," (1951) "Rear Window" (1954), "North by Northwest" (1959) and "Vertigo" (1958). 
Hitchcock had several inarguable mas­terpieces over the course of his several decade career (including those men­tioned above), but few have had the staying power and long-reaching influ­ence of "Psycho," which remains his most iconic film and a cinematic water­shed

that style on purpose -it's just how they talk. There is no winking self-awareness so the gimmick feels natural throughout the film. The entire cast-adults includ­ed -also behave in this manner. The one adult who is not part of this world is the mother of The Pin, who interrupts a tense discussion of gang warfare and murder to ask if anyone wants milk and cookies in a highly entertaining scene. 
Despite its obvious influences, Johnson, in this debut film, has not just set out to re-create the 1940s film noir. In fact, the movie most commonly referenced here is Roman Polankski's classic "Chinatown," the Jack Nicholson film that, while cer­tainly noir-ish, was shot in color and released in 1974. 
"Brick" is in color too, and while it maintains the old-school style of profani­ty-free dialogue, it does feature at least one instance of violence that is far more graphic than anything Humphrey Bogart ever starred in -a reminder, perhaps, that the real world is more startling than the romanticized movie versions of mur­der and intrigue from the 1940s would suggest. 
"Brick" will be screened on Sunday at 7 
p.m. by the Notre Dame film society. All are welcome.

INDIANAPOLIS -Peyton Manning is all business when it comes to football. 
But since it's still the preseason, forgive Manning if this week has been devoted more to his second vocation -helping others. 
He hosted a major fundraiser for his charity Monday night and fully understands if football seems more distraction than passion to the thou­sands of fans expected to watch him play New Orleans on Saturday night in Jackson, Miss. 
"It's good to go back there because it's got (Hurricane) Katrina ties to it," he said. "Anything we can do to help out is good." 

Manning is trying to recast the perception that he's the football equivalent to a high school valedicto­rian -all study, all the time. 
After Sunday's preseason game, he seemed more genuinely upset about the potential losses of his top backup, Jim Sorgi, and running back James Mungro than anything that happened on the field. 
By Monday night, the two-time MVP was min­gling at a local bowling alley with celebrities rang­ing from Cal Hipken Jr. 
and defending NASCAH champion Tony Stewart, to radio personalities Bob and Tom and actor James Den ton of the TV series "Desperate Housewives." 
The goal was to raise money for Manning's Peyback Foundation, which provides disadvan­taged youth with opportu­nities like a Disney Cruise, a nag football game at the Colts complex and Christmas parties for hun­dreds of children in Indianapolis, New Orleans and Knoxville, Tenn. 
And when it has Manning's imprint, calling in a few favors is no prob­lem. 
IN BRIEF 
NASCAR puts Edwards on 
probation 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -Carl Edwards has gone from one of NASCAR's golden boys to one of the sport's "bad boys," struggling on the track and tangling with fellow driv­ers such as Dale Earnhardt Jr. off it. 
Don't expect him to apologize or to make excuses. If he loses his tem­per -and he has at times this year -Edwards says it's about passion not petulance. 
"I worked awfully hard to get here," Edwards said Wednesday. "I think that maybe what people are seeing is hopefully they understand that I really care about what I'm doing. I'm going to stand up and point out when I think something is wrong." 
If he has to, Edwards will ram the point home. Just ask Earnhardt. 
NASCAR fined Edwards $20,000 on Tuesday and placed him on pro­bation for the rest of the year after he intentionally rammed the side of Earnhardt's car on the final lap of last Saturday's Busch race at Michigan International Speedway. 

Riley to return to Miami 
for another year MIAMI -Pat Riley decided against quitting on top. He'd rather try to stay there another year. 
Riley said Wednesday he'll return as coach of the NBA champion Miami Heat, ending speculation he might retire at age 61. He'll be on the sideline when the title banner is raised at the season opener Oct. 31 against the Chicago Bulls. 
"After winning the championship, I realized there's always something meaningful that happens in your life that becomes the primary point of your destiny," Riley said in a state­ment. "Winning the championship showed me that I am definitely in the right place, at the right time, with the right people. I can't wait to get started." 
"We all know how great Peyton is," Ripken said. "He has such great credi­bility, that I can say yes blindly knowing it's about the kids." 
If that doesn't work, there's always intimida­tion. 
"Peyton is a lot bigger than me, and I didn't want to tell him no and then have him pick me up by the neck and drag me in here or something," Stewart joked. 
The bowling tournament has gone from infancy to national status in just four years and has turned into a memorabilia dealer's vir­tual dreamplace. 
Steelers to adjust to loss of 
Bettis 

LATROBE, Pa. -One of the intriguing questions before the Pittsburgh Steelers opened training camp was this: Who would replace Jerome Bettis, the short-yardage and goal-line specialist? 
The answer, apparently, is nobody. Or everybody. 
Former starter Duce Staley or third-down back Verron Haynes appeared to be competing for the job, but coach Bill Cowher said Wednesday the Steelers probably won't have such a specialist this season. That means starter Willie Parker might get the ball frequent­ly inside the 10-yard line, some­thing that rarely happened last season. 
"I can't say right now there's been one person like there was with Jerome. And I don't think that's a bad thing," Cowher said. "That's the way it was last year. This year's a different year."

TENNIS 
Agassi dealt tough hand in final U.S. Open 
On the women's side, unseeded Serena Williams also challenged as she attempts to come back from knee injury 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -If Andre Agassi is going to make an extended run at his final U.S. Open -as plenty of fans, tour­nament organizers and TV executives, not to mention Agassi himself, surely hope ­he's got his work cut out for him. 
Agassi's path at the last tour­nament of his career shapes up as a tough one thanks to a draw Wednesday that includes a potential second-round match against rising star Marcos Baghdatis and possible fourth-round showdown against Andy Roddick. 
"That's quite a lot to ask," said four-time U.S. Open cham­pion John McEnroe, who'll call the tournament for CBS and USA Network. "Andre's got it in him, but Baghdatis has got some game. That's going to be quite an interesting match, because Baghdatis wins people over with his smile and per­sonality -and everybody's going to be pulling for Agassi." 
Or, as U.S. Open chief Arlen Kantarian put it during the draw ceremony at U.N. head­quarters, Agassi will be "prob­ably the single greatest thing talked about at this U.S. Open." 
The 36-year-old Agassi, an eight-time Grand Slam cham­pion, faces Andrei Pavel of Romania in the first round. Pavel is a former top-20 player currently ranked 76th; Agassi has won five of their six previ­ous matches. 
If Agassi gets past that, he could face the eighth-seeded Baghdatis, a 21-year-old from 
Cyprus who was the runner-up at this year's Australian Open 
and  a  semifinalist  at  
Wimbledon.  
"If Baghdatis  is  on  and  

healthy and fit," said U.S. Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe, John's brother, "I think that's a very tough match for Andre to win right now." 
Two rounds later might bring another intergenerational clash -against Roddick, who'll turn 24 next week, was the 2003 U.S. Open champion and is seeded ninth. 
Hampered by a bad back, Agassi is 8-7 in 2006, never going beyond the quarterfinals at any event, and he withdrew from two tournaments this month. That's dropped his ranking to 37th, which is why he's unseeded a year after reaching the final. 

Then again, Agassi wasn't seeded in 1994 -when he won his first Open title. 
Another past U.S. Open champion and No. 1 player who's unseeded this year, Serena Williams, also was given a rough draw. She fell out of the top 100 while side­lined with a left knee injury and needed a wild card to enter the tournament. 
Her possible second-round opponent is No. 17 Daniela Hantuchova, who knocked off Williams in the Australian Open's third round in January. If Williams reaches the third round, she could face No. 16 Ana Ivanovic, who won last week's Open tuneup at Montreal and leads the U.S. Open Series standings. 
And should Williams get to the fourth round, her opponent could be No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo, the reigning Wimbledon and Australian Open champion. 

"That was the big question mark: Where was Serena going to be in the draw?" said for­mer pro and current TV ana­lyst Mary Joe Fernandez. 
Williams' older sister Venus, the 2000-01 U.S. Open winner, wound up on the opposite half of the draw as the No. 30 seed and appears to be in a rela­tively easy quarter. Bothered by a bad wrist, she hasn't played since being upset in the third round while trying to defend her Wimbledon title. 
"We haven't seen Venus at all," Fernandez said. "But we know Venus can turn it on at any given time, like she did last year at Wimbledon." 
On paper, the women's quar­terfinals could be Mauresmo vs. No. 8 Martina Hingis (the 1997 champion), No. 3 Maria Sharapova vs. No. 5 Nadia Petrova, No. 2 Justine Henin­Hardenne (the 2003 champion) vs. No. 7 Patty Schnyder, and No. 4 Elena Dementieva vs. No. 6 Svetlana Kuznetsova, in what would be a rematch of the 2004 final, won by Kuznetsova. 
The potential men's quarter­finals would be: No. 1 Roger Federer vs. No. 5 James Blake, No. 4 David Nalbandian vs. No. 7 Nikolay Davydenko, No. 2 Rafael Nadal vs. No. 6 Tommy Robredo, and Baghdatis vs. No. 3 Ivan Ljubicic. 
Federer, the two-time defending champion, starts off against Wang Yeu-tzuoo of Taiwan, then would meet the winner of an all-British first­round matchup between Tim Henman and 1997 Open run­ner-up Greg Rusedski. 
"Federer got pretty much of a dream draw," Patrick McEnroe said. "No problems for him through the first week, I would say." 
Nadal's opener could be more interesting: He drew wild-card Mark Philippoussis, the two-time major finalist with a big serve whose career has been derailed by injuries. And the third round could bring a matchup against up­and-comer Gael Monfils, who's seeded 27th and turns 20 on Sept. 1.

Venezuela shutout in International semifinal 
Three long balls give Mexico the early lead 
Associated Press 
SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. ­The Mexican champions from Matamoros used home runs from Jose Segoviano, Josue Barron and Roberto Guajardo in an 11-0, mercy rule rout of Barquisimeto, Venezuela, in Wednesday 's International semifinal at the Little League World Series. 

Mexico will play the winner of Thursday 's game between Kawaguchi City, Japan, and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in the International championship game on Saturday. 
"We had no idea it would be so easy," Mexico manager Candelario Perez said through an interpreter. 
Mexico got to Venezuela pitcher Manuel Barrios early, tagging him with l'ive runs -three earned -before he was pulled with no outs in the second.

"We had seen him throw before," Perez said. "We saw him as a very strong pitcher." 
Segoviano hit a two-run shot in the first inning and Barron added a three-run homer in the second that made the score 7-0. 
Guajardo 's three-run homer well over the center lield fence made tho score 11-0 in the top of the third. After that, Mexico only needed to shut out Venezuela for two more innings to claim a mercy rule vietory. 
Venezuela manager Domingo Carrasquel said getting behind early made it difficult for his team to recover. 
"They're sad because they thought they could go a little fur­ther," Carrasquel said through an interpreter. 
Mexico pitcher Omar Zamora struck out 11 in his four innings of work and added a triple and a single and scored twice. 
Zamora said his arm was tired, just like it had been in the Mexican tournament. But it didn't end up hurting him either time.

NCAA FOOTBALL 
Nevada installs revolutionary 'pistol' offense 
Associated Press 
RENO, Nev. -At first glance, it looks like a typical shotgun formation. 
But wait a second, that quar­terback is much closer to the center than usual. And is that a back lining up behind the QB? 
Hmm, that's weird -and very effective. 
Hot as a pistol, Nevada's new offensive scheme helped the Wolf Pack to its first bowl game since 1996 last season. 
Coach Chris Ault calls it the pistol -a hybrid of the shotgun where the quarterback lines up a few steps behind the center. It allows for two-back and single­back sets, typically with four receivers. 
And it's attracting lots of curi­
ous coaches. Ault said more 
than 85 universities, junior col­
leges and high schools have con­
tacted Nevada or visited to find 
out what it's about. 
"It is THE thing," he said. 
"And we have great confidence 
in it and so do the players." 
The winningest coach in 
school history, Ault is beginning 
the third year in his third stint 
with the Wolf Pack. 
His previous offenses, one ·dubbed "Air Wolf," were wide­
open passing attacks, often out 
of the shotgun. 
With Nevada's move from the 
Big West to the Western Athletic 
Conference in 2000, Ault decid­
ed the team had to improve its 
running game. 
"The feature of the pistol that people don't realize is so benefi­cial is the north-south running game," said Ault, adding the for­mation allows the running back to get the ball deeper behind the line than when the quarterback takes the snap from center. 
It's a variation of the spread offense coaches such as West Virginia's Rich Rodriguez and Florida's Urban Meyer have made all the rage in college football. 
But Ault-177-73-1 in 21 years of coaching, all at Nevada -said he didn't seek advice from outside coaches or experts before installing the pistol when spring camp opened last year. 
"When I first brought it up to the staff back in January 2005, they were not for it. They thought it was too much of a reach. And I really did, too," he said. "But we were a bad foot­ball team. We were 5-7 (in 2004). I just felt it would be worth the investment." 
The move paid off last season as Nevada finished 9-3, claimed a share of the WAC title and beat Central Florida 49-48 in overtime in the Hawaii Bowl. 
The Wolf Pack finished 14th nationally in total offense aver­aging 449.3 yards per game and 16th in scoring, with 34.2 points per game. They were balanced, too, rushing for 199.5 per game and passing for 249.8. 
But nothing in football is truly new. 
San Jose State coach Dick 
Tomey said the pistol is essen­tially the old single-wing that teams ran in leather-helmet days. 
Hugh Wyatt, a longtime high school football coach in the Portland, Ore., area, said he's shown film clips at clinics of Princeton using a single-wing formation in the early '60s that resembles the pistol. 
"It's not as if the fact Princeton was doing it indicates in any way he's copied this thing. It's not likely he ever had any access to the Princeton footage," said Wyatt, who was a personnel director with Philadelphia in the World Football League before joining the WFL's Portland franchise in the early 1970s. 
Finally, Booty no longer riding the pine for Southern Cal 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -John David Booty .arrived at Southern California three years ago with expectations so high many thought he would beat out Matt Leinart during the 2003 sea~ son. 
Of course, no one knew at the time that Leinart would lead the Trojans to a 37-2 record and win a Heisman Trophy dur­ing one of the .finest careers for a quarterback in NCAA history. 
Now, finally, it's Booty's turn, and he's confident he can con­tinue the tradition of winning quarterbacks established at USC by Leinart and 2002 Heisman Trophy winner Carson Palmer. 
"The .guys before me have set high standards. That's what I want to do, by winning games," said Booty, a 21-year-old red­shirt junior from Shreveport, La. 
Booty didn't say a word about the Heisman or any individual awards_ just winning. 
"As a young quarterback, my biggest goal is to have our foot­ball team win, not put it in bad situations," he said. "All I can control is what I do." 
Booty comes from a football family. His brother Josh was the LSU quarteJ,"back in 1999­00, and another brother, Abram, was a wide receiver at LSU from 1997-99 and at Valdosta State in 2000. 
Booty's father was his quar­terbacks coach in high school before being fired following his 
junior year. With that, Booty 
decided to graduate early and 
pass up his senior year to 
enroll at USC. . Booty beat out highly regard­
ed redshirt freshman Mark 
Sanchez for the starting job. In 
a show of approval, teammates 
elected Booty as one of the 
Trojans' four team captains. 
He'll get his first test Sept. 2 
when USC, ranked sixth in The 
Associated Press preseason 
poll, plays its opener at 
Arkansas. 
''I'm not worried about these 
guys at all," USC coach Pete 
Carroll said of his young quar­
terbacks. "Matt followed 
Carson and was able to get it 
going. It took Matt about four 
or five games before he got it 
rocking.

NO ATHLETICS 

Three athletes reinstated 
NCAA calls violations 'secondary;' Zbikowski, Zeller, McAlarney will receive no penalty 
By KEN FOWLER -Sports Editor 
The NCAA reinstated senior strong safety and defensive captain Tom Zbikowski and two men's basketball players after Notre Dame briefly declared them ineligible for their participation in promo­tional television spots, Associate Athletic Director for Compliance Mike Karwoski said Wednesday. 
Karwoski said the NCAA informed him in a phone call around 5 p.m. Wednesday they decided that three players committed "secondary viola­tions" -violations without intent -for their "implied endorsement" of a local televi­sion show. 
The NCAA then told him there would be no penalties, sanctions or eligibility conse­quences for the spots featuring Zbikowski, sophomore forward Luke Zeller and sophomore guard Kyle McAlarney. 
"As far as they are con­cerned, the matter is closed and there would be no penal­ties involved," Karwoski said. 
In a statement e-mailed to the media Wednesday night, Irish coach Charlie Weis expressed gratitude to the NCAA for the quick manner in which the situation was resolved. 
"I appreciate the fact this was handled in an expeditious manner by the NCAA as well as our compliance and sports information departments," the statement read. ''I'm glad we have a resolution to this situa­tion and I look forward to con­tinuing our preparation for Georgia Tech." 
Notre Dame had sent a letter to the NCAA compliance office in Indianapolis Tuesday after­noon at once declaring Zbikowski, Zeller and McAlarney ineligible and requesting their reinstatement. 
The trio's problem stemmed from separate appearances on the sports talk show "Sports Dogz" that airs on WSBT-TV in South Bend. During their appearances, the players filmed "bumps" -advertise­ments for the show, during the show, that informed viewers

Of the five players who will travel to tourna­ments, Kubinski said he has only decided on two so far. Nine players will compete for the three remaining spots on Notre Dame's traveling squad.

King not retained after 5 years as head coach 
Athletic department looks for replacement as fall season nears 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Editor 
There will be a new Irish leader this fall. 
Notre Dame declined to renew the contract of head coach Debby King after five years, and a search for her replacement is underway, Assistant Sports Information Director Sean Carroll con­firmed to The Observer Wednesday. 
Carroll declined to comment on specific reasons behind the move, directing questions to Assistant Athletic Director Jim Fraleigh. 
The Observer was unable to contact Fraleigh Wednesday night. 
Assistant coach Kyle Veltri is still with the team, which begins official practice Aug. 
29. Veltri declined to com­ment on the coaching situa­tion. 
"I think the main thing we're focusing on right now is to maintain the enthusiasm and be as confident as we can be," she said. 
Junior golfer Alejandra Diaz-Calderon also declined to comment on the specific circumstances, saying she had not received official word of the athletic department's decision. 
"The administration hasn't told the team any details why Coach King wasn't returned," Diaz-Calderon said. 
She said she, senior Noriko Nakazaki and sophomore Lisa Maunu -three of the team's returning players -would be involved in the interview process of a new coach. 
She said she hoped the new
