Fr. Burtchaell and students meet informally. 

Burtchaell answers questions at St. Ed's 

h.Y 1\likt• Haum 
University Provost James T. Burtchaell, 
C.S.C., declined to name the members of 
what he termed "a very small group" 
making the final decision on the selection 
of a woman's hall on campus. 
In a question and answer session last 
night at St. Edward's Hall, Fr. Burtchaell 
also said that the decision would be made 
"fairly soon" and ruled out any immediate 
institution of co-ed dorms. 

In a discussion with about 30 Notre 
Dame and St. Mary's students, Burtchaell 
also detailed University expenditures 
during the past year and discussed tuition 
raises and the future of the co-ex program. 
Although Fr. Burtchaell refused to say 
who would comprise the "very small 
group" choosing the hall or halls to be 
converted to women's dorms, University 
President Rev. Theodore M. Hedburgh, 
C.S.C., said Monday that the decision 
would be made by Fr. Blantz, vice­
president for Student Affairs, in con­
sultation with himself and the Provost. 
Fr. Burtchaell said that the problem of 
making arrangements for students 
displaced by the hall conversion is being 
studied by Fr. Blantz and the Hall 
President's Council and that a "very good 
plan" is being worked out. 

Burtchaell reported that "the decision 
will be made fairly soon in order to give 
ample notice on room selection." He 
remarked that the assignment of space for 
the 125 coed students entering in the Fall 
entailed several problems in renovation, 
security, dining hall arrangements, ad­
ministration, and the like. 

"Very small group" 
In answer to questions, he said that he hoped that students trying to tr~nsfer to Notre Dame from St. Mary's could be notified of acceptance in the Spring, Burtchaell explained that such notifications were usually made over the summer, and that he didn't know for sure when they would be announced. 
Burtchaell observed that the alumni and Administration were "not yet ready" for coed dorms, adding "anything is possible in the future." 
He disagreed with the charge that Notre Dame was "not yet ready" to educate women, saying, "We have appointed people to look into such things as medical technician programs." 
He said that the University, for example had studied and hoped to improve on St. Mary's medical study program, and possibly start a program for paramedics. 
He added, "I think that the misgivings of people that feel that way <that Notre Dame is not ready to handle women's education> don't revolve around specific programs." 
Fr. Burtchaell: "The budget has a slight surplus." 
Burtchaell noted that several major expenses had arisen during the year causing the $702,000 budgeted deficit planned by the University this year. He cited: 
-a quarter million dollar rental on the newly installed IBM computer system. -a $163,000 per year maintenance fee for the new life sciences building. -a $110,000 net increase in Social Security taxation 
-an insurance rate increase due to the 
69-70 student riots across the country 
amounting to $90,000 
-a rise in coal costs amounting to $80,000 
-a drop in graduate student funds due to the phasing out of government funding programs. 
Although he stated that no tuition raise has been decided for nest year, Fr. Burt­chaell s!lid "I suspect that it will have to go up." He noted that he saw no relief in sight unless the federal government began a student subsidy program. 
Commenting on next year's budget, Fr. Burtchaell said that expenses had been tightened. "The budget next year has a slight surplus," he said, "and since we usually come out better than budget, that ought to mean a nice surplus." 
In response to questions, Fr. Burtchaell said that beginning next semester Notre Dame and St. Mary's would pay each other for co-ex credit hours. He observed that had this been done this year, St. Mary's would have had to pay Notre Dame on the order of $1 million. 
Burtchaell admitted that this change would probably make the program harder to get into for St. Mary's students, but said that, "St. Mary's can afford to pay." Burtchaell reasoned that, "The tuition is the same, but salaries and faculty-student ratios are different."

Freshmen given their draft status 
!t·l Nf'W York Times 

Washington <Feb. 2) --The nearly 2 million men born in 1953 were assigned selective service lottery numbers today determining the order in which they will be subject to the military draft. 
None of these men will be drafted before next vear. The lottery was held now. according to Dr. (·urtis W. Tarr, director of Selective Service, "so that young men will be able to make plans as soon as possible." . 
Today's dr11wing only affects men who are havmg their 19th birthday this year. Men born before 1953 were given lottery numbers in the year that their 19th birthday occurred, assuming the random selection system is continued. 
Recause no one will be drafted on the basis of this lottery until next year, it is difficult to predict what a "safe" lottery number is. Tarr and his aides refused to spec~late. 
The cut-off number after which men will not be drafted will • depend on two unknown factors: whether the draft is ended in the middle of 1973 and what the military's manpower needs will be that year. 
difficult to predict 

llowever, unless there ts a significant change in manpower requirements, men with numbers over 100 probably will not be inducted, and men with numbers below 20 probably will be. 
The first men born in 1953 to be drafted will be those whose birthday is March 6. They drew lottery No. 1. Ironically, men born on March 7 were assigned No. 2. 
!'resident Nixon has promised to try to end all draft calls and turn to an allvolunteer army by the middle of 1973. If this goal is reached, the men who recieved lottery numbers today will be the last to be inductPd 
The drawing today in the commerce department auditorium was the fourth the selective service system has conducted, and the Agency used the ex,perience of past years to carry it out flawlessly. 
Unlike previous drawings, there were no protests outside the auditorium and little emotion inside. Tickets were required for admission to the auditorium, and the 100 or so people who watched the proceedings were mostly newsmen and selec­tive service employees. 
About a dozen young people had obtained tickets through their congressmen, and periodically there was a sigh or a giggle as their birth date was drawn. 
The loudest gasp came about three-quarters of the way through the drawing when no. 1 was matched with March 6. The top number, 365, was matched with July 23. 
The numbers and dates had been placed in the eapsules according to a table of random numbers provided by the National Bureau of Standards. The drums were rotated for 10 minutes before the drawing started and for about a minute after every 20 capsules were drawn. 
Therefore it was pure coincidence that two eonsecutive dates were matched with no. 1 and no. 
•) 
In 1970, the first year the lottery system was in pffect. 163,500 men were drafted, and the top lottery number reached was 195. Last year, 98,000 men wPre drafted, and the cut-off number was 125. 
Knowledgeable officials are estimating that about -tii.OOO men will be taken this year and that the top lottery number will be about !ill. Some military manpower experts believe that draft calls might be quite high in the early months of next year. No one is being drafted in the first three months of this vear. and few. if any, men will be taken before July heeause the Army has been ordered by Congress to mak£' a sizeable rPduction in its number of troops by .luly I. 
If draft calls are held down in the summer and fall lll'for£' thl' presidential l'i<•ction. these manpower spPeialists reason. then it might be necessary to have large ealls early next year to meet the army's troop requirem£'nts.

HPC delays hall action

"Freshman must live on campus, This decision was made after and Admissions overaccepts so Badin president Buz Imhoff that the actual number of in­proposed a committee to coming students is not realized 
Few students strongly opposed to draft lottery 
Ed Rahill 

A survey taken of Notre Dame students affected by yesterday's Selective Service Draft indicated the lottery was least favorable among students who drew low lottery numbers. However, the survey revealed that few students were violently opposed to the lottery system. 
"It is a necessary evil," said Tom Drape, an A.L. major who received 47. "Being drafted at this stage in life hurts because it is so important to one's future and you cannot make any plans." 
Bob Carnes, a pre-med major who was 8th in the lottery, believes that the draft has a greater effect on pre-professional people. "Because it is tougher to college, I should have to leave and waste two or more years of my life and start all over." 
. McGuire went on to comment on the draft alternatives. 'This country should really have a volunteer army because it is just not right to force someone to serve if he does not wish to. If a person wishes to join -fine, if not, let him choose another way of life." McGuire was 7th in the lottery. 
A number of students conveyed a more moderate opinion towards the draft lottery system. Dean Laurich, an A.L. major with a number he termed "pretty safe " said that "People are generall'y accepting the draft as a fact of life. It's something that eyerybody has to go through'.' 
until July or August." 
Subsequently, halls are faced with the prospect of forcing some residents to live off campus. 
According to a plan submitted by Farley President Joe Markosek displaced persons will be placed into halls by lottery and will enter into room selections as previous residents. 
Fisher President Carmen Maciariello suggested that action be taken to eliminate students crossing into Michigan to escape the Indiana drinking ordinance. Marty Siemion claimed tensions have been created among residents of St. Ed's because of unequal enforcement of campus rules in other Halls. Motto suggested sending a letter to University President Theodore Hesburgh CSC and trustee chairman Edward Stepan "regarding deterioration due to the great flux" claiming it would be effective in making them aware of the existing problem. 
Among other topics mentioned was HPC executive co-ordinator Fritz Hoffer's attempt to sell candles at the Mardi Gras. The proposal which was an attempt to raise money for Youth Advocassy started before Christmas by John Barkett and Morrisey President John Kwicien was abandoned.

reason Bob gave. 
One of the strongest objections 

to the draft came from A.L. 
major Bob McGuire. "If you get 
a high number such as 300 you 
can feel the draft is fair, but when 
you receive a low number it's not

Student Union 
finance report 

"inaccurate" 
by Larry Dailey 
Student Union director Bill 

McGrath and comptroller Tim Schaffer yesterday af­ter noon asserted that' Student Union is not in the dire financial straits that earlier reports had 
pictured. 
"The inventory is recorded on a 

strict cash basis," said comp­
troller Schaffer, "yet the Student 
Union budget does have other 
money owed to it." He termed 
previous figures stating that only 
one-third of the budget was . for 
the second semester "grossly 
inaccurate." 
According to Student Union 

Director Bill McGrath "we still 
have $22,000 of an original $37,500 
-in other words, more than 50 per 
cent of the budget left for the 
second semester." 
"The inventory didn't take into 

account a $6,000 refund we will 
receive in the future because of 
the cancellation of a concert 
scheduled for the first semster, 
demonstrated Schaffer. In ad­
dition, the comptroller explained 
how other figures can be 
misleading. 
"Our first semester account 

indicates not only the normal 
financial business of that period, 
but also the organizational ex­
penses that are not recurring. 
For example, our September 
account showed $1,000 office 
expenses and $400 phone bill, yet 
this equipment is used 
throughout the year and the 
payments are not recurring. One 
must also take into consideration 
the fact that money spent on a 
second semester concert is 
normally paid during the first 
sememster. 
"We do have the money," 

McGrath concluded, "and we are 
not going to be caught short."

Hall Life Report is scheduled for March 
by Ed Ellis 

The Student Government Hall Life report is proceeding on schedule this week with Hall Life Commissioner Bob Higgins holding fact-finding sessions with most of the twenty hall presidents. 
The Hall Life Report, 
requested by the University 
Board of Trustees in October, will 
be presented to them in March. 
Data and proposals from the 
hall presidents are due to be 
given to Higgins next week, and 
the writing of the report will take 
most of the time between now and 
the Trustees' Student Affairs 
Committee meeting in March. 
The report, according to Higgins, is concerned with three areas of hall life, all physical. 
The first is a report on the architecture of the thirteen oldest halls on campus as of 1969. Higgins said that he is working with a report made by the University right before Flanner and Grace Halls were ooened. 
This report, he said, is the basis for most of the renovations made by the University over the past three years, including three and four-man suites. Higgins plans to request whatever unfinished renovations are still important. 
The second source for the report is the series of proposals made by the hall presidents to the Student Senate Hall Life Fund Committee. 
$10,000 was distributed by the Senate Committee to the halls, but. Higgins noted, "many halls did not get what they requested because of lack of funds." 
"Hopefully the Trustees will provide enough to get these programs off the ground." 
Also. Higgins is asking for more proposals from the hall presidents, the hall councils, and tht• hall staffs. 
"At least 19 of the halls will have proposals," he said, "all have cooperated so far, and I hope to have all the necessary data by next week sometime." 
Higgins has seen thirteen of the presidents so far, and has ap­pointments with the rest later this week. 
Referring to the general scope of the report, Higgins said, "The Trustees said they had some money for the halls if we could prove the need for it. That's exactly what we're doing here." 
"It's the most extensive 
program of this type ever run by 
Student Government," he said, 
"and I think we're going to 
satisfy the Board." 
A companion survey to the Hall Life Report, the Student Ceater Report, is not quite so developed, according to Research and Development Assistant Com­missioner Jim Clarke. 
Clarke said that this report will 
concern renovations of the 
Student Center, and the possible 
use of other buildings near La 
Fortune for student 
organizations. 
It will involve, said Clarke, 
some of the work of the Com­
mittee for Social Understanding 
of a year ago.

The sudden and bitter cutoff of merger discussions and their slow and painful resumption has killed whatever chances Notre Dame and St. Mary's ever had of merging their two student governments this year. Merger would be pointless ­useless. The two student governments would lobby with two different animals­the Notre Dame and St. Mary's hierarchs. In the vast majority of cases, a merged student government would serve no purpose whatsoever-in fact, it'd get in the way. In the vast majority of instances, student government next year will deal with one or the other institution-not with both of them. Massive two­school governmental structures aren't very much help dealing with mundane problems in security or food service. 
So that's the first thing-that the two student governments can't merge this year. 
Here's the second thing-that if next year's two student body presidents are as different in ideological viewpoint, temperament, and inclinations as this year's; and if a crisis as large as the stuff that has arisen this last year crops up again next year, there'll be hell to pay. This year's merger activity has been sort of a false spring; next they'll be playing for keeps. If coordination between the two student governmentsis as bad as it has been this year, they'll be playing without the student body. } 
What, then, is the solution? Obviously, to have separated-but coordinated­student governments. That's why we favor the plan to elect student body presidents on both campuses on a four-candidate ticket. This way, both cam­puses will elect presidents presumably qualified to do business with their own institutions but presidents without any tendency to tear each other's thro~t open at the least sign of politictil difference. 
The SMC assembly last night formed a committee to deal with this year's election. Tonight, the ND Senate meets, and this question will be high on their agenda. We.urge both bodies to pass a four-candidate ticket proposal without delay and to get down to the serious business of electing some presidents. 

The New York Times 
Market Place 
Robert Metz 

New York, Feb. 2---About that business of finding a good broker. For now that the market is roiling again, the roasted and toasted investors of the great bear market of 1969 and 1970 are coming out of the recovery room. 
If you're one of these walking dead, you're naturally interested in finding a broker; one who will treat you right---find you a winner once in a while. 
So how do you go about finding a good broker. Well, it isn't easy. It's like trying to find a good doctor, only worse. First, there have to be good vibrations---you've got to understand each other. But perhaps more important, you've got to have some money to really interest a good man. 
If you've got no more than $10,000 to invest, most good men in WaH Street aren't going to fall all over themselves calling you up every 20 minutes with the latest ticker talk. 
We asked slim, laconic Arnold M. Katz, one of Shearson, Hammill & Co.'s biggest producers---as they say---what he expects of his customer.s and what they had a right to expect of him---or of any other broker. 
Arnold has 17 years of experience in Wall Street, is 38, and says he hasn't earned less than $100,000 a year for at least eight years. 
lie was incensed enough about a column telling of the trials and tribulations of brokers making $40 and $50 a week in the bear market years of 1969 and 1970 to write telling how the competent man operates. 
Arnold has over 200 accounts--some of them as small as $25,000, most of them larger---and he feels many of the investor's problems are of his own making. 
When a customer opens an account with Arnold, he insists that it be a margin account so that with the current 55 per cent cash requirement on a credit purchase, "I can be twice as right for him." 
Any broker worth his salt should demand some discretion, he said. "So far as my customers are concerned, the timing must be mine. That's where the broker's responsibility is greatest. When to buy and when to sell is really the key to success in this business. 
"I don't want my customer calling me up three times a day. Maybe once a month is about the right time interval. Another thing, I don't want to be second guessed. Big ac'''" or small, if a customer says that his man at Bache doesn't like the stock I bought for him, I ask him where he wants me to send his portfolio, because we're through. 
"I'm not interested in my custorher's view of the market. If he thinks he knows more about it than I do then we'll never establish a rapport. I'm not interested in his opinion of an industry unless he's part of it--say the president of a company, someone with real ex­pertize." 
Katz helps train registered representatives at Shearson, Hammill and has some strong views on what a customer should look for in his broker. He said that the most important thing was that a customer's man have a high degree of ethics. He added that an investor has a better chance of finding high ethics if the "guy doesn't need your business." 
A broker's ethics are not, however, so easily determined. What's the clue'? "Too many unsuccessful trades." 
So how do you evaluate the claims of a prospective broker? Well, says Katz, beware of extravagant promises. He suggests asking for records of performance with the names of customers crossed out. Of eourse. 
Rut remember, any broker can show a good record for 1968. "Show me a guy who will reveal customer records for the years 1969, 1970, and 1971---good years and bad. 
"If he just out-performs the averages in a single good year, he's not brilliant. The man who out-performs in a bad year is the one who knows what he's doing. As a potential client, you want to see records for eustomers with similar investment objectives." 
Katz is not impressed with most of his clients investment objectives­--usually 15 per cent in a good year. 
"If he's thinking that way, there is a good chance that he'll lose 25 per cent in a bad year. If he wants 5 to 7 per cent a year, he should be in a mutual fund .. 
"As for my clients I expect a great deal of flexibility. I want the customer to be willing to be in cash or even to go short when I think the market is going lower." 
Katz has posted a big order for other brokers '.fill---and a big order for himself. He offers no guarantee other than confidence borne of experience that he will continue to be successful.

A priest of limited credentials 
The Catholic University as a danger to the Faith 
As one who works as a chaplain in the campus ministry of this University, I find myself equipped at times with extremely limited <Tcdentials. I am not a psychologist nor a theologian, not a mnr:,list or liturgist. I am just a priest with a taste for literature and a concern for people whom I would rather see dance than suffer. If I could ask God for a single gift. it would be for the gift of healing, for others as well as for myself; but He reserves to Himself the power to give sight to blind eyes, and rhythm to crippled feet. Sometimes He seems to use my humanity as an instrument for His grace; but I know. and lie knows, that He could use the jaw bone of an ass with greater efficiency, although it must be admitted that assbones can never feel, as men do, the truth and beauty of a Father's love. 
It was with a full sense of my limited credentials that I received as visitors in my room the other night a group representing the Notre Dame chapter of the (iay Alliance. The reason they came to me. they said, was a column or two of mine. written for the Observer, in which I offered words of encouragement to a campus student despondent and despairing over his self-awareness as a homosexual. 
I was moved by my meeting with these four or five young men, as I am always moved by the presence of people dedicated to the affirmation of human rights for which they have suffered, and are apt to suffer again. from misunderstanding, hatred, fear and ridicule. Here were young folks who are not strangers to Notre Dame and its tra~itions ...chaps who, hopefully, believe in God, and hunger for the Eucharist, and sometimes light can­dles during the night hours at the Grotto. Proud and sensitive, with a dignity that has survived outrage, they came --I believe--hoping for understanding from 
Maria Gallagher 
The Catholic university -once a protective moral womb amid a carnal and corrupt reality is now every bit as susceptible to the carnal and corrupt as the surrounding world. Hevolutionary changes on campuses throughout the country in recent years have wrought an upheaval in image undreamed of by their saintly founders. Notre Dame is not your Notre Dame of 10 years ago. Loyola is no longer a mere citadel for lofty theological meanderings and expostulation. University cultural arts commissions now sponsor movies formerly "condemned" by Ihe Legion of Decency. 
What precipitated this radical facelift? Is the Catholic university a helpless victim of the age of the so-called "new morality'"' Was a change of some sort in order, and have the changes that have c·omP to pass proved beneficial? 
Let us first examine the purpose of the <'atholic university .Aside from its function as an educational institution, its sectarian quality sets it apart from state or non­sectarian private schools. Charters of <'atholic institutions usually embody a particular spirit on which the institution is modeled and which is supposedly borne out in praetice. However, in recent years the "spirit" of the average Catholic university has tended to exist solely in the pages of its information booklet or in the imaginations of its idealistic ad­ministration. 
Who is to blame. then, for this waning of spirit and this religious indifference that seems to eharacterize the up-and~oming gPnerations'1 Some blame must rest with those parPnts who were lax in teaching, Pnforcing, and exemplifying religious prinl'ipiPs to their children. 
But an <'Vl'n more frightening aspect of lht• <'atholic university. aside from its passi\'P acceptance of the confused spiritual lives of its students. is that it is usually lht• stud<•nt 's first l'ncounter with criticism of th<' faith in Pstablishment nw and from the Christian community of which I am 'a part. They came, and they are my brothers, and I suppose they were not even sure of getting a brother's greeting. It has been several days since Sunday. and I am still touched by that scene in which an appeal for support was made in a muted human way that is beyond words; these chaps were beautiful, and it was up to me to match their greatness with love and openness and concern and honesty. 
Perhaps my visitors from the Gay Alliance will have an instant hatred for the words I have just written. Perhaps they will say. "That is not the way it was at all. We were making assertions, not appeals. We were demanding, not pleading ... " and of course they would be right. For these young men were not penitents in search of absolution; they were not broken creatures in search of therapy. And one knew. perhaps with a fear of the un­familiar, that a new wind is sweeping over Notre Dame and the world, and the times, they are a~hanging. 
It is in the face of these changing times that I indeed find myself the priest of limited credentials. For on Sunday evening when I heard the news that the <:ay Alliance has come to Notre Dame, I felt inadequate to the news, though I knew for a human being with great depths of soul, which I am not, it was an hour when truly human service could be ren­dered. The situation, I felt, required something more than a simple response of sympathy and love, which was all I had to give. But in the mystery of human sexuality and in the revelation of truth in the affairs of God and men, I do not know the value of the Gay Liberation Movement. 
Up to this point of my life, I have known gay people mostly in my role as a con­fessor or counsellor, where the priest might seek to heal the alienation that is 
trappings. Due to recent academic "renaissances" sweeping the country, theology courses are less and less required, so it appears that the student agnostics are getting their way. Many theology departments at Catholic universities are struggling to remain in Pxistence. and in an attempt to entice an t>nrollment, they are frantically creating courses that sport the labels, "relevant," "ehallenging," "presenting fresh outlooks," et al. Course selection booklets abound with titles such as "Challenge to the Church" or "1\lmlt•rn Catholicism." Virtually extinct are courses in Church history and defenses of basic dogma, and Ill<' surviving few are populated only by theology majors who have to take it. As they are usually taught with a yawning dispassion no one can blame non-majors for fleeing to something mre interesting like. "Was Mary RPally A Virgin?" Many of these either deliberately or inad­vertantly ignore the traditional and even the basic doctrines of the faith. Criticisms of Church shortcomings are proffered so gPnerously and student criticism is wpJcomes so enthusiastically that students lParn to become self-styled. eagle-eyed <'hurch critics-in just one semester!

Unfortunately. these students learn how to tear down. but not to build. Opinions are t'ine. hut when answers do lie at the end of questions they should be given. Too often students are not made aware that rights and wrongs do exist. and no direction is giVPn. Tlwy are left only with censure in hand. confused.

It may not be the university's specific intent to do this, but it doesn't seem to be doing anything to ameliorate the situation. Not all blame can be attributed to the university. however; students being ac­cepted now are proportionately more skeptical than their naive counterparts of byegone days. 
So. cheer, cheer, for old Notre Dame. A 
recent publication called Spectrum of 
Chimes: incredible edible 
Chimes, the edible magazine, is here today. It is magically appearing in St. Mary's dorms. around the Notre Dame campus. You might notice it at Madeleva or the huddle. It is growing out of desks, out of tables. 
It is Alice's mushroom. You can keep breaking off pieces to eat, but it keeps growing and there's still a whole mushroom there. That is to say, you can have your Chimes and eat it too. There is another thing: it is Alice's mushroom because if you take the chance to taste it, you just might find that it transforms your eonsciousness. For a while, your life will be different. 
It has an organic sort of taste to it, it is not slick or shiny. It is not slimy. It has texture and softness. The cover show's a drawing a student did in 1894. The pages show poetry and photography that students have been doing as they lived lwrp with us. You know them .These are the (Wople: Drexel Ace. Pl'ter Rrown. Frank Ciccone.

A lot of good in the soul's drift away from God. 
In honesty, I have never really been able 
to relieve the anguish of any person in the 
gay situation, though with some, I have 
enabled them to live the life of faith ex­
pressed through the sacramental life of the 
Church. 
It would be so attractive to be able to say 
to souls stretched out upon wheels of 
suffering, "Go Gay,'' thereby hoping that 
though the panacea of a movement, the 
sufferings of a large group of sensitive, 
misunderstood people would be over, and 
they would eventually be at peace with 
themselves and the world. In any of the 
current movements, Civil Rights, 
Women's Lib, the Peace Movement, Gay 
Liberation. I want to be sensitive enough to 
recognize and support the voices that cry 
out their needs as human beings. But if I 
were to identify myself with the Gay 
Alliance the way the Berrigans have alligned themselves with the Peace Movement, would I somewhere along the line be supporting values that are in­compatible with my beliefs as a Christian ·priest trying to bring souls to their destinies as redeemed children of the Father of love. For example, does support 
Catholic Attitudes lists views on Church issues by a half dozen Catholics, one or two of whom take positions that would make a Unitarian uneasy. As William F. Buckley so aptly put it, "There are of course Catholics who are still on the side of the Pope. But they speak in whispers and walk about furtively, lest the new religion of love q,nd understanding espy them and eat tqem up."

of the Gay nee mean tone must, as part of Chrislian liberty, accept as cheerful alternatives to heterosexual marriage the life-styles etched in pitiableness that one sometimes glimpses in the gay newspapers of the underground press? 
I do have hope for the Gay Liberation Movement. In a church which is rapidly coming to a new vision of itself,where truth and moral insight evolve at a rapid clip in step with the knowledge explosion that is taking place on all levels of human understanding, a new spirituality and ethics of the gay life may quickly develop, just as there has developed a theology of marriage to enrich the lives of traditionally married couples anxious to open their lives to the dynamics of a Christian sacrament. 
This campus has certainly not been waiting to find out the reactions of the priest of limited credentials to the coming of the Gay Alliance to Notre Dame. But to the Gay People I have known, or spoken or prayed with, I wanted to say something, though it only be the mumbling of foolish words which mean, "Darby and I never said we didn't love you."
