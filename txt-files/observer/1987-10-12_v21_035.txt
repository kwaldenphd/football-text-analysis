Plane crashes, 49 people die 
Associated Press 
RANGOON, Burma -A Burma Airways plane caught fire and crashed about 20 miles short of a popular tourist town in central Burma Sunday, kil­ling all 49 people aboard, in­cluding 14 Americans, the gov­ernment said. 
The official News Agency of Burma said 36 foreigners, nine Burmese passengers and four crewmen were aboard. 
It was  the airline's second  
disaster  in  less  than  four  
months.  

The agency said twin­turboprop Fokker Friendship 27 "caught fire in midair" and crashed southeast of its des­tination of Pagan, a town whose ancient Buddhist temples at­tract many foreign tourists. 
The brief announcement did not give the cause of the crash. 
The agency said besides the Americans, seven Swiss citizens, five Britons, four Australians, three West Ger­mans, two French citizens and one Thai died. 
The crash came one day after diplomatic sources reported in­creased police protection of the 
U.S. embassy in Rangoon be­cause of reports that an an anti­American terrorist group had entered Burma. 
Officials would not speculate on possible links between crash and terrorists, and no further information was available on the alleged arrival of terror­ists.

Iranian missiles bombard Baghdad 
Associated Press 
MANAMA, Bahrain -Iraq resumed its aerial blitz of Iranian oil targets Sunday, severely damaging a Liberian­flagged supertanker. Two crewmen were reported killed and four others missing in the attack. 
An Iranian surface-to­surface missile exploded in Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, as Iran retaliated for the attack on tankers. 
Two Exocet missiles from Iraqi jets crashed into the en­gine room of the 239,435-ton Rova, setting the ship ablaze, according to gulf -based ship­ping sources. 
It was one of three raids an­nounced by Iraq against tankers along the Iranian coast since Saturday morning. 
Shipping sources identified one of the three targets as the Merlin, a 215,925-ton Cypriot­flag tanker under charter to Iran. An Exocet missile crashed into the ship but did not explode and damage was minor, they said. The unex­ploded missile was still aboard. 
The identity of the third ship was not known, the sources said. 
Both Baghdad and Tehran reported that a long-range Iranian missile was fired into the Iraqi capital overnight but disagreed where it hit. Iran claimed the missile struck a major military garrison, while Iraq said it landed in a residen­tial area, killing "numerous" civilians. No figures were given. 
The attack on Baghdad was the first since two of the projec­tiles, believed to be Soviet­designed Scud-Bs, hit the city of 4 million last Monday.

To "prepare women to play key roles in solving major problems facing the human population" will be the pur­pose of a newly renovated science building, said Saint Mary's College President William Hickey at the build­ing's dedication Saturday. 
After a $6.5 million expan­sion project, the building was dedicated before faculty, guests, and alumnae dressed in academic attire. 
As part of the ceremony, Dr. Mary Lowe Good, presi­dent of the American Chemi­cal Society, was awarded a Doctorate of Science. Accepting the degree, Good, also president of an engineer­ing division of Allied Signal, Inc., said it is important that individuals pursue science oriented careers since fewer are being attracted to the field. Our economic future is dependent on the new technol­ogy that future scientists will develop, she added. 
According to Good, women who attend women's colleges are more likely to pursue a science major. ''Achievement stems in part from prepara­tion," she said. 
Also speaking at the cere­mony, Monica Creamer, a 1979 Saint Mary's College graduate and manager of the American Chemical Society Manuscript office, said wo­men must overcome many ob­stacles in order to acheive success in a science career. If a woman works hard enough, she can attain high status, she added. 

Bork battle marks low point of White House clout 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The likely rejection of Robert Bork as President Reagan's nominee for the Supreme Court marks the-tow ebb in Reagan's worst year yet on Capitol Hill, and lawmakers say the president has responded to defeats by growing even more confronta­tional. 
The White House apparently has concluded that, having lost control of the Senate in the 1986 elections, it is better to make a stand on principles and go down in martyrdom than to seek compromise from a weakened position. 
"They are following a scorched-earth policy," said Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. "Veto, threaten veto, vote no, filibuster, stall, delay. It's a no-win policy." 
The year has yielded a string of losses for the administra­tion, growing ever more visible. The year began badly when Reagan vetoed two major spending measures, the clean water bill and a highway au­thorization act. Both vetoes were overridden. 
Later, Reagan sought to make budget reform a top domestic policy priority. But while campaigning for reform, congressional Republicans complained, the president was sitting out the real budget fight going on in Congress. 

The result was that Reagan was forced to sign a renewal of the Gramm-Rudman deficit­reduction law last month in which he had little say. 
Added to those failures has been the Iran-Contra hearings, disputes over more aid to the Contras and the sale of Maverick missiles to Saudi Arabia, and the Bork nomina­tion, which some Republicans said wasn't pushed hard enough. 
"I don't think they used the tools of the trade in a way to be successful," said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. "If they had done half as much as the left did, he would have been approved." 
But more than a White House 
failure, the Bork vote il­
lustrates a new partisanship on 
a Capitol Hill where both 
houses are under Democratic control, said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. 
"There is a desire to defeat the president on everything up here," he said. "I think they (at the White House) are being conciliatory with Congress. But there are some things you just have to stand up and fight on." 
Other Republicans, however, say Reagan has consciously chosen not to cooperate, which may backfire on those who, un­like the president, have to run for re-election next year.

In Brief 
Dozens of police, firefighters, reporters and photographers mobilized when a police officer in Brooklyn reported by radio he had found a "possible nuclear war­head in a privately owned truck." Within minutes a crowd of emergency workers and reporters surrounded the truck in the Flatbush section. Police found two sealed metal, lead-lined containers about the size of three-gallon drums, each holding about 5 grams of radioactive iridium 192, a substance used to treat cancer patients. According to police, someone stole the truck and abandoned it in front of a store with its motor running. -Associated Press

Reagan thick-headed in Nicaragua policy 
There is a stubborn obstinancy to Ronald Reagan that makes one wonder how he ever made it as a politician. 
It is a foolish consistency that guides his mind and makes him continue policies no matter how stupid, how short-sighted, how expensive, how illegal, or even how unpopular. Keen political advice from his own party and the strongest urgings of his wife and close advisors are not enough to keep him from jumping onto his horse backwards. 
One such obstinancy that haunts the inner workings of his mind concerns the protection of what he considers America's "backyard." Reagan's utter refusal to negociate with the Sandinista government, especially after the recent peace accords among Central American nations, reflects a brutish stubborness to stick to his guns. 
In Reagan's mind, Daniel Ortega is and will always remain the puppet dictator of the Evil Empire. For this reason the Central American peace plan that looks so promising to everyone else is "fatally flawed," according to our Pres­ident. For him, a negotiated peace that has the potential of leaving the Ortega regime in power is simply unacceptable. Either the Sandinistas surrender or the contras fight on. 
Once upon a time Reagan's goal of making the Sandinistas cry "uncle" enjoyed quite a lot of popularity in this country and even moderate support abroad. But times have changed and people have grown tired of a plan that is costly, ill-defined, and yields no positive results. 
The new interest shown by Central American governments in finding a diplomatic end to their troubles apparently means nothing to an ad­ministration that prefers to solve problems with covert operations and military might. Despite the uproar created by the Iran-Contra scandal this summer, Reagan has by no means aban­doned a policy which was shown to be disor­ganized and riddled with profiteering and cor­ruption. In fact, he wants just the opposite, namely to expand the contra program to the tune of a whopping 270 million dollars. 
The decision was made several years ago to play "hardball" with what was taken to be the Marxist forces of Nicaragua. And now it is a line from which Reagan obstinately will not retreat. Major concessions to opposition parties in Nicaragua, such as lifting the 15 month cen­sorship of the newspaper La Prensa or naming outspoken critics of the Sandinista party to a national reconciliation commission, are written off by Reagan as "phony" democritization. 
In a speech to the Organization of American States last week Reagan pledged to continue support of the contras until "full democritiza­

tion" is established. His words were "to work, strive and struggle as long as there is breath in this body." 
The loyalty towards the troops is perhaps ad­mirable from a certain perspective, but what Reagan blindly fails to perceive is the harsh criticism his boys have raised from all quar­ters. There was a time when dedication to these "freedom fighters" could be passed off as a high patriotic calling. But the hour of Ollie North is clearly gone. 
No one serious believes that the Contras are the good guys anymore. Hour after hour of con­gressional testimony clearly showed that these bands of rebels lacked any financial responsi­bility, military discipline, organizational hierarchy or noble accomplishments. The only press coverage they legitimately get concerns the latest allegations of brutality and plunder. And yet Reagan persists in their support and pleads for an unprecedented increase in fun­ding. 
The real shame in Reagan's stubborn insis­tence in unworkable policies is that it destroys the chances of better ideas to take hold. In the words of House Speaker Jim Wright, the current Central American policy of the Reagan team aims to "torpedo the peace process." Where there is a chance for a major foreign policy success Reagan stubbornly will insist on fail­ure.

Homosexuals rally at Capitol 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Thousands of homosexual activists, led by AIDS victims in wheelchairs and bearing signs carrying messages like, "Thank God I'm Gay," marched Sunday to demand protection from dis­crimination and more federal money for AIDS research and treatment. 
U.S. park Police said about 50,000 people had gathered by 1 p.m. for the march past the White House and rally near the Capitol. The crowd, carrying balloons and banners and wearing buttons and T -shirts, stretched along the mall for more than a dozen blocks. 
"Here we are from Califor­nia, Alabama, Florida, Arizona, Alaska, Seattle and Delaware -east, west, north and south -in numbers too large to ever be denied again," said Eleanor Smeal, former president of the National Or­ganization for Women. 
She told the crowd they num­bered 500,000 and yelled, "Look at you!" 
"Feel the political power of the moment. Spread love and fight hate," she said. 
She also said, "We have stopped Bork,'' referring to federal Judge Robert Bork. whose nomination to the U.S. supreme Court appears headed for certain defeat in the Senate. Marchers chanted anti-Bork slogans. 
Under skies threatening rain, the rally began with music and a poignant state­ment from Dan Bradley, a White House aide in the Carter administration, who is suffer­ing from acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
Bradley said that what he was most proud of was that "after a lifetime of struggle (and) fear . . . I had the courage (in 1982) to say, loud and clear, 'I'm gay and I'm proud. I'm gay and I'm proud."' 
Activists say the AIDS crisis, which has hit the homosexual community in the United States especially hard, has spurred an increase in violence and dis­crimination against the na­tion's lesbians and homosexual men, who they estimate num­ber 25 million. 
Organizers were hoping to use the march and rally Sunday and a planned non-violent pr-otest in front of the Supreme Court building on Tuesday to dramatize their calls for more federal assistance. 
"The Reagan administration is allowing millions to die," said one of the marchers, Jim Merriam, an AIDS victim from Miami. Its "response has been an ineffective, insincere com­mission on AIDS." 
Suzanne Phillips of Brook­
lyn, N.Y., a medical student who works with AIDS victims, carried a bumper sticker reading "Fight AIDS, not people with AIDS." 
"I can't do anything for the patients but watch them die. I can't stand it anymore," she said, calling on the Food and Drug Administration to speed the process of approving new drug treatments for AIDS. 
Activists began their day Sunday at sunrise on the mall, with the unfurling of a 7,000­pound quilt bearing the names, personal effects and, in some cases, the ashes of victims of AIDS. 
The quilt bears 1,920 panels made by companions or rela­tives of people who have died from the disease.

Radical plan unveiled for Poland 
Associated Press 
WARSAW, Poland -Prime Minister Zbigniew Messner un­veiled a radical economic reform program Saturday that stresses lifting barriers to ini­tiative, slashing bureaucratic power and letting market forces influence prices and wages. 
The program amounts to a rejection of many of the eco­nomic mechanisms built up over the 42-year history of the Polish communist state, and is line with the restructuring taking place in the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev. 
Messner said the reforms also should persuade Western lenders to quickly restore trade credits to Poland. Credits dried up after the 1981 martial law crackdown on the Solidarity in­dependent trade union move­ment. 
In an unprecedented move, the Parliament called for a nationwide referendum Nov. 29 to let the public itself deter­mine the "degree and rate" of the reform. 
Addressing the Sejm, or par­liament, as Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski looked on, Messner said the reform pack­age will spur socialist enter­prise on the principle that "everything which is not prohibited is permitted." 
He complained of a lack of vitality in Poland's economy, saying, "In extreme cases, the people pretend to be working and the enterprise pretends to pay them." 
He said one goal of the 
reform is to activate the "im­
mense latent capacity" of the 
Polish people. 
The Sejm called a session Oct.23-24, when it are expected to ratify the package. Messner said the reforms would be im­plemented in 1988-90. 
The reform would make it 
much easier for individuals or 
enterprises to start new busi­
nesses or engage in foreign 
trade.

Girl mauled by lion in flea market 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON -A lion being walked through a flea market suddenly grabbed an 8-year-old girl and mauled her, then grabbed her head between its jaws, only letting go after it was shot twice, police and wit­nesses said. 
The girl was ·in critical but stable condition Sunday, and authorities considered whether to file charges against the lion's owner. 
"It grabbed the little girl," said Brian Mason, a witness to Saturday's attack. "I could see the little girl trying to get away and screaming, her body sliding away on the floor." 
The lion's owner was holding the lion's chain but could not control the animal, Mason said.

cited," said Mason, 27. "He 
grabbed her and started drag­
ging her across the floor. She 
was screaming and everybody 
starting running around." 
A security guard accompa­
nying the lion and its owner 
shot the lion with a .44-caliber 
handgun but that didn't stop the 
attack, said police Lt. C.W. 
Driskell. 
"That seemed to aggravate 
the lion, and it grabbed her by 
the head," he said. "He then 
shot the lion again, and they 
still had trouble getting it to 
release the little girl." 
The lion's 35-year-old owner had operated a booth at the Texas Flea Market for about three months, letting shoppers have their picture taken with exotic snakes and the lion, said Driskell. 
Harris County prosecutors will decide what charges, if any, to file against him, police said. The owner was taken to police headquarters where he gave a statement. He declined comment to reporters. 
Roxanne Hernandez suffered a cracked skull and part of her brain was exposed during the attack, said paramedic J.W. Hays. 
After six hours of surgery at Hermann Hospital, she was in critical but stable condition Sunday, said hospital spokes­woman Barbara Cafferty. 
"She is doing well, she is con­scious," said Ms. Cafferty, adding that it was too early to determine whether there was brain damage. 
''All we can do is wait and see," she said. 
City health officials and a Houston Zoo veterinarian were c?.Bed in after the attack and injected the lion with tran­quilizers and taped its mouth. 
But while being loaded into a truck, the lion reared and slashed the arm of Dr. Karen Kemper, a veterinarian with the city's Bureau of Animal Regulation and Care. She was 
treated at the scene by paramedics. 
Kemper said the cat was later killed and its head sent for laboratory tests to see if it had rabies.

Peace Corps: a rewarding alternative 
When I was asked to write a letter to the students of Notre Dame describ­ing my "Peace Corps Experience," I was enthusiastic at the prospect of being able to share my experiences here in Thailand with you. However, when I began contemplating all that I have experienced in just one year here, I realized that this would not be an easy letter to write. How could I possibly sum up a year and three months of the most interesting and rewarding, yet culturally unfamiliar and sometimes frustrating, experiences of my life in a single letter? I have been sending let­ters home to family and friends weekly since I've been here, and I have the vague feeling they still think I'm living in a grass hut in the middle of a rice field somewhere in Southeast Asia. 
(Actually it's a wooden house in a vil­lage, surrounded by rice fields.) What follows is just a brief description of how I have found life in the Peace Corps to be from first applying while at Notre Dame to where I am now, one year down and only one more year to go ­unfortunately. 
Tracy Thornbury 

guest column 
Durmg my senior year at Notre Dame, two years ago, I began the process of applying to the Peace Corps. Since spending a semester in London my junior year, I was pretty intent on the idea of entering the Peace Corps upon graduation. However, being a con­scientious senior at that time, and, more accurately, dreading the prospect of May approaching and having no where to go but home to Mom and Dad, I quickly busied myself with job inter­views at Career Placement (few and far between thanks to my psychology and Spanish major), applications for grad school, and any volunteer pro­grams which sounded as inviting as the Peace Corps (none did, but I applied anyways). I applied to Peace Corps in October and spent the rest of my senior year anxiously awaiting an invitation. The application process turned out to be long and sometimes frustrating, but as I was told by some returned Peace Corps volunteers, if you're patient and persistent, chances are you will get ac­cepted eventually. In May I finally got an invitation to go to Thailand. Al­though I was thrilled that I would soon be on my way to becoming a Peace

Corps volunteer, I was still pretty clue­less as to what the next two years and three months would have in store for me. I had never even heard of Thailand before, let alone known where it existed on a map, and all I could imagine of this place was scenes from "The King and 1." 
In July I bid farewell to family and friends, and, armed with Swiss army knife and mosquito repellent, set off for San Francisco for a week of pre­training briefing. It was there I was thrown together with fifty other trainees, and we all flew to Bangkok together. Training Nas to consist of three months of langt'age and cultural lessons during which time we also had several weeks of tec~nical training depending on our progrctm. Since I was to be a TEFL (teachin,~ English as a foreign language) crossover agricul­ture volunteer, I spent six weeks in agriculture training and another four weeks in teacher training. In training we were taught the importance of as­similating into the culture. This meant adopting the language (learning to speak the dreaded five tones of the Thai language) and customs of the Thai people. We were told to dress and act conservatively. Women were advised not to wear shorts or other revealing clothing in public, and not to smoke or drink amongst the Thais. Men were warned against having beards or mus­taches as Thai men have little facial hair and regard unshaven foreigners as suspect. The male trainees were also notified about the Thai males' custom of visiting prostitutes and that they should be prepared should they be in­vited to join Thai co-workers for after­hour activities. After three months of living out of a suitcase (duffel bag rather) and being constantly evaluated by our Thai training staff, we were sworn in as volunteers and then sent off to do our duty in the rice fields of Thailand. After three months of living in close quarters with fifty other trainees, it was hard saying goodbye and going off on our own, but as a result of such closeness we had formed a sup­port system which would stay with us throughout our two years of service. 
I was sent off to the sticky rice fields in Northeastern Thailand, the poorest part of the country. It is here that my real Peace Corps experience begins. It is the daily life in the village of Moeiwadee that has shown me what the words "Peace Corps" really entail: living among the Thais (I haven't seen another foreigner since I was in Bangkok a month ago), speaking Thai (I'd have no friends and be quite inef­fective here if I couldn't speak the lan­guage), eating Thai food (rice and more rice and insects when lucky), the hassels of living in a village only ac­cesible by dirt road, thus forced to go by motorcycle or local transportation (consisting of privately owned open-air trucks run at the driver's convenience), but, most importantly, teaching En­glish and agriculture to twelve to fif­teen year old children every day. 
Every so called "sacrifice" that I may have made in coming here is for­gotten, or at most seems trivial, when I am with my students. That air con­ditioner during blazing heat, that insect-free house, paved roads and su­permarkets, and electric typewriter <as I type this on an antique manual one), cold and hot running water, a western style toilet, or that $25,000 a year job or study towards a masters or PhD degree, seem little to sacrifice for two years worth of smiles and laughter from my students. Just to hear a Thai child shout "hello" to me in the mor­ning makes me realize how lucky I am to have made such sacrifices, and to be a Peace Corps volunteer here. 
Tracy Thornbury is a 1985 graduate of Notre Dame and is currently serving as a member of the Peace Corps in Thailand.

esc lauded for determined efforts 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing this letter to commend the staff's efforts at the Center for So­cial Concerns. The Center provides stu­dents with many opportunities to serve the South Bend community which, in turn, implicitly helps students build their individual charisma, spirituality and sense of social issues. It also pro­vides services which are geared to help students in a more explicit fashion. 
I am specifically writing to praise Mary Anne Roemer's efforts for or-
Garry Trudeau 
ganizing the Senior Reflection Groups. The groups offer seniors an excellent environment to relax and discuss their lives, goals, and values cultivated over the past four years. They offer a way to pull together the bits and pieces of our experiences realized here, to reflect on the "big picture" of the meaning of our college years, and to provide a clearer sense of direction for our lives. 
I believe six nights with good meals, good wine, and friendly, hearty and focused conversation will be well worth a senior's time. Stop by the Center to sign-up or to find out more about the group~

On that first album, "Just Like Honey" was a huge hit and established the band as the new "big thing" in England. This label was bestowed on the two brothers even though nei­ther of them really knew how to play their Instruments. As a matter of fact, the two felt that nobody should have to hear them play live for more than half an hour, so they wrote Into their contracts that they'd play for no more than .30 minutes during live concerts!

"April Skies" is the first single and is very good, al­though it actually was released in July prior to the entire al­bum. "Darklands" is another strong cut. "Fall" is also a cool tune. 
It is on the slower songs such as "About You" and "Cherry Came Too" that the real evolution of this band emerges.

"This is the time of year people should be thinking about cold weather," Plank said. ''The most important thing is to check over your tires.

Terrell. A 16-yard run by Rice for Notre Dame's first points capped that drive. 
After Todd Lyght blocked a 

Panther punt, Rice led the of­
fense 19 yards to cut Pitt's lead 
to 27-14. 
In the fourth quarter Rice 

again connected with Brown on 
a 42-yard pass. But with first 
and goal at the nine, Rice 
rushed twice for three yards. 
After a third-down incomple­
tion, the pressure was on to 
score as Holtz called for a pass 
on fourth down. The Irish had 
the right play called, but Rice 
was blitzed and threw before 
his receivers turned around . 
The contrasts continued as 

Rice hit Brown for 22 yards, 
then pitched to Mark Green 
who carried it in from 17 yards. 
A two-point conversion move 
the Irish to within eight of the 
Panthers. 
"Tony came in and did great," said Brown, who helped Rice with three recep­tions for 94 yards. "He scored 22 points in a half. Hopefully he can look at the things he did wrong and right and come out next week and do the job." 
Rice got a taste of pressure football in the final minute when Notre Dame recovered the on-sides kick. After two runs moved the ball to the Pitt 38-yard line, Rice threw two in­completions and was sacked, setting up fourth down and 17 with time running out. 
Rice dropped back to pass, but he could not find a receiver. Then he spotted the clock with 10 seconds left. He rolled right and headed for the sidelines, forgetting it was fourth down. The game was over, but Rice's future as Notre Dame's quar­terback was just beginning. 
"The young man performed very admirably in the game," said Holtz, "but he has a lot to learn. He's a true freshman, and he has a lot to learn. 
"There are a lot of things I need to work on, a lot of mis­takes to correct," said Rice. "But I'm ready to do what needs to be done."

That's why we're seeking single Catholic males to share their time, labor, and friendship in Appalachia this holiday season. 
It's an easyargument that there are more comfortable ways to spend the Yuletide. But in Appalachia, you'll discover a sense of brotherhood, community, and true Christmas spirit that's as old as the hills.

Playoffs roundup 
Twins, Giants one win away 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -Kirby Puckett and Greg Gagne homered, moving the Minnesota Twins within one game of their first World Series in 22 years with a 5-3 victory over the Detroit Tigers Sunday night. 
The victory broke a traveling jinx for the Twins -the worst road team in playoff history ­and gave them a 3-1 advantage in the best-of-seven series. 
Bert Blyleven, 15-12 and the winner of Game Two at Min­nesota, will go against Doyle Alexander, 9-0, Detroit's opening-game loser, in Game Five Monday. 
Detroit's Darrell Evans cost his team two runs with his baserunning and fielding. 
Evans was picked off third base by Twins catcher Tim Laudner in the sixth inning with the Tigers trailing 4-3. Two pitches later, reliever Juan Berenguer threw a wild pitch. 
In the eighth, Evans, the Tigers' regular first baseman, made an error at third base as the Twins added their insur­ance run. 
Gagne, the Twins shortstop, made a first-inning error that 
Block 
continued from page 16 
Lyght set up another Irish score when he darted past the line of scrimmage and blocked a John Rasp punt late in the third quarter. That gave Notre Dame the ball at the Pitt 19, and fullback Braxston Banks scored on a one-yard plunge six plays later, just into the fourth frame. 
But the next time the Irish got the ball, they started at their own eight-yard line thanks to a clipping penalty on the Pittsburgh punt. A penetrating Panther defense kept them there, and great field position set up a 20-yard Jeff Van Horne field goal when Pitt got the ball back. 
Notre Dame failed to score a point when it had a first-and­goal from the Panther nine­yard line. Rice was pressured cost his team a run, but so did Tigers right fielder Larry Herndon. And Herndon's fifth­inning fluff proved to be the dif­ference as the Twins, 2-4 here during the season, beat Tigers left-bander Frank Tanana, who contributed to his own downfall with a playoff record three hit batsmen. 
The Twins had a 29-52 record on the road this season -worst of any division or pennant win­ner in history. 
Puckett hit a solo homer in the third, and Gagne had one in the fourth. Between the two of them, they were 2-for-23 in the first three playoff games. 
Giants 6, Cardinals 3 
SAN FRANCISCO -Kevin 
Mitchell homered and drove in 
two runs Sunday and the San 
Francisco Giants ran past the 
St. Louis Cardinals 6-3, sprint­
ing to a 3-2 lead in the National 
League playoffs. 
The Giants moved within one victory of their first World Se­ries appearance since 1962, using their power and stealing the Cardinals' speed. Game Six will be Tuesday night in St. Louis, away from the swirling winds that turned Candlestick · Park into a crazy cauldron. 
overthrew Banks in the endzone. 
But the Irish got another chance with 2:29 left to play, trailing 30-14. It took them three plays and one minute to 
move the ball 44 yards for an­other score. Mark Green finished it off with a 17-yard sweep, and Brown went in standing up for the two-point conversion that cut the lead to 30-22. 
The true no-names then con­tinued to keep the Irish hopes alive. Freshman Andre Jones recovered a Ted Gradel on­sides kick and gave Notre Dame the ball on its own 47. 
The final minute was heart­stopping. Brown ran for eight yards and Rice scrambled for seven to set up a first down at the Pitt 45. But Panther defen­sive end Burt Grossman sacked Rice on the next play, and Rice threw the ball out-of­bounds to stop the clock with 
The Cardinals finally found a way to contain Jeffrey Leonard, who went 0-for-4 after homering in the first four games, but could not control his teammates. This best-of-seven matchup had been billed as power-versus-speed, and the Giants had both. 
San Francisco Manager Roger Craig promised before the game that his team would add a new dimension and it showed immediately. Robby Thompson and Mitchell stole bases in the first inning and Jose Uribe stole another in the fourth after his two-run single sparked a four-run rally that made it 6-3. 
The Giants stole only 126 bases to St. Louis' 248 during the season, but swiped more in the first four innings in Game 5 than the Cardinals have stolen in the series. Meanwhile, San Francisco continued to flex its muscles. 
Mitchell singled home Thompson in the first and launched a solo home run in the third. The Giants out-homered St. Louis 205-94 during the reg­ular season and hold a 9-1 edge in this matchup. 
Third and 17. Rice threw In­complete to Green on the next play, and then dashed all Irish hopes of a comeback tie when he ran out of bounds on fourth down and didn't even throw one 
up for grabs. 
"I didn't know what down it was," Rice explained. "I knew time was running out, so I ran out of bounds to stop the clock. The next thing I knew, they said it was their ball." 
Rice was 5-of-12 passing for 125 yards. Brown, often single­covered because of frequent Panther blitzes, caught six passes for 156 yards, picked up nine yards rushing on two carries and had 61 total return yards. 
In addition to losing their first game and dropping to 3-1 on the season, the Irish have lost junior free safety Corny Southall for at least a few games. Southall strained liga­ments in his left knee in the

Irish win tourney, dominate North Star 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 

Despite receiving a little bit 
of a scare on the tournament's 
opening day, the Notre Dame 
women's tennis team came 
away with its fifth-consecutive 
North Star Conference tourna­
ment championship. 

The Irish sent five of a pos­sible six singles players and two of a possible three doubles teams to the tournament finals. Northern Illinois, a team the Irish had shut out in a dual meet earlier this season, ac­complished the exact same feat, and the two schools were tied going into Sunday's finals. 
"We probably went into it a little too confident, and that might have been my fault," Irish coach Michele Gelfman said. "Northern Illinois had a couple of changes in their lineup, and they moved all their doubles teams around." 
Notre Dame came on strong in the finals to take the North Star title. Stephanie Tolstedt, Michelle Dasso, and Kim Pacella all defeated Northern Illinois opponents in singles finals, and the doubles teams of TolstedWacella and Natalie Illig..Cathy Bradshaw also beat foes from NIU. 
Tolstedt won the last two sets of her match after droppping the first set. In the eighth game of the final set, Tolstedt won her service game after being down, 15-40, broke NIU's Lee Ann Milne in the ninth game, then held service to win, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.

Northern Illinois 15-5, 15-9, 15-4. 
Maureen Shea registered 17 kills, hitting for a .571 percentage, to lead the Irish. Junior Whitney Shewman, who played well all weekend com­ing off the bench, added 10 kills 
in the contest.  
On  Sunday,  Notre  Dame  
defeated  Minnesota  three  
games  to  one.  Three  of  the  

day's games, including two Irish wins, went to 16-14 scores before a winner was claimed. 
Notre Dame jumped out to a 10-2 lead in the first game, but slacked off and allowed the Golden Gophers to rally back and tie the score at 11 and then again at 14. A Bennett ace and Shea-Waller block gave the win to the Irish. 
Game two was nearly a car­bon copy of the first outing, with the Irish jumping ahead 7-3 and the score eventually tied at 14. Notre Dame was slow reacting to Minnesota kills, and the Gophers scored several kills just inside the baseline to stay close and then pull out a 16-14 win. After bat­tling to a 3-3 tie, the Irish pulled ahead 11-4 in the third game behind the scrappy play of Shewman, Bennett and Taryn Collins. After a short Gopher rally, Collins had a smooth dump over the net, then set up 
Dasso, by contrast, cruised through the weekend, winning her singles matches by scores of 6-0, 6-0, and 6-1, 6-0. She al­most matched that success in doubles, with she and Ce Ce Cahill trouncing their oppo­nents by scores of 6-0, 6-0 and 6-1, 6-1. 
"Stephanie Tolstedt played one of the most outstanding matches I've ever seen her play," said Gelfman. "Mic­helle Dasso was so steady. Every time she stepped on the court this weekend I knew she was going to win. She really ripped through her opponents and destroyed some people." 
Cahill closed her perfect fall season with a 21-0 singles record, eliminating a pesky Meg Mulcahy of Marquette in the final round, 6-3, 6-2, after shutting down first-round op­ponent Kim Ingraffia of DePaul, 6-0, 6-0. Cahill's class­mate, fourth-seeded freshman Pacella, having to move up to the fourth seed because of Alice Lohrer's injury, still had rela­tive ease in winning her matches, 6-1, 6-0, and 6-1, 6-2. 
"Kim Pacella played out­standing," Gelfman said. "She was feeling kind of weak, and she was playing the personally who's normally number-three 
at Northern Illinois in the finals 
and still won." 

In other singles action, Illig 
placed second and Julie Sul­
livan finished in third place. 
Illig and doubles partner Cathy Bradshaw took their doubles title with two straight­set wins, 6-3, 6-1, and 6-4, 6-1. 
Shewman and Shea to complete teamed with Waller for a block the 15-8 win. and then hit home a kill to finish off Minnesota, 16-14, and three

TYSONS CORNER, Va. -The owners' negotiators walked away from the bargaining table Sunday, dashing any hopes for a quick end to the nearly three-week-old NFL strike. No further talks were scheduled. 
Management blamed the breakoff on the players' con­tinuing demands for free agency. The union said it was a deliberate move to put more pressure on the players to break ranks and cross picket lines. 
"We're at a roadblock, we're mired down," said Jack Don­lan, who had negotiated with union head Gene Upshaw for a little more than five days, the longest single bargaining ses­sion of the strike. 
In fact, on a day the second round of games were played with non-strikers and replace­six-year contract -they also ment players, the two sides disagreed on just what the seemed as far apart as ever. major roadblocks are.
