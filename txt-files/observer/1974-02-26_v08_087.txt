Nixon holds rare news conference 
by Eugene V. Risher 
WASHINGTON (UPI)-President Nixon declared Monday night the Constitution permits the House to impeach a President only for criminal offenses and predicted he would not be impeached. 
Nixon took issue with a study by the legal staff of the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry, which concluded last week that a President can be put on trial in the Senate for offenses which are not specifically outlawed. 
"I do not expect to be impeached," the President said at a news conference televised from the White House -his first since his meeting with newspaper editors at Disneyworld in Orlando, Fla. last Nov. 17. 
From energy to politics 
Nixon, choosing his words with great care, appeared to speak slower than usual. He wore an American flag pin in his lapel. Answering questions for 40 minutes, he made these points: 
Energy: The crisis is no longer a crisis, only a "problem." He predicted that lines leading to gasoline stations would grow shorter this spring and summer, that rationing would prove unnecessary and that gasoline prices would remain high. 
llis taxes: For the first time, Nixon conceded what critics have charged -that the deed of his gift of vice presidential papers to the National Archives "apparently'" was not signed before the law per­mitting tax deductions for such gifts was changed. Nixon said he sent the papers to the Archives in March, before the July 25, 1969 change, but offered to pay back taxes if more are due. 
Watergate: Nixon disclosed that he had offered to meet with special Watergate prosecution Leon Jaworski and answer his questions but Jaworski refused to go along with such an arrangement. Nixon said he would not bow to Jaworski's request to testify before a grand jury investigating the Watergate scandals. 
The economy: Nixon said the economy is going through a slowdown but during the second half of 1974 it will be on "an upward curve." He said, "We will not stand by ... and allow a recession to occur." 
The Arab oil embargo: Nixon said the "urgent meeting" of Arab· leaders which he announced in his State of the Union address did not occur on Feb. 14 because Arab leaders "are not a united group." Nonetheless, he predicted, the embargo would be lifted. 
Politics: Nixon reiterated his determination to complete his second term in the presidency. He was asked if he would remain in office even if it became obvious that Republican disaster loomed in the 1974 congressional elections. "I want my party to succeed," he replied, "but more importantly I want the presidency to succeed." 
When the inevitable resignation question arose, Nixon recalled 1949, when Democratic prospects looked so bad that Sen. J. William Fulbright, the Arkansas Democrat, was calling for the resignation of President Harry S. Truman. Nixon said the Republicans made Truman "the issue and we took a very bad licking." Nine months before the 1974 elections, he said, none could predict what the issues would be. 
"I think it will be a good year for those candidates who stand for the administration," he said. 

On Impeachment 
On the impeachment question, Nixon disputed the House com­mittee's study, which said a President could be impeached for such offenses as dereliction of duty. 
"The Constitution is very precise on what is an impeachable of­fense," he said. "In this respect it is the opinion of White House counsel and other constitution lawyers, and it is my opinion, that criminal offense is the requirement for impeachment." 
The Constitution says only that a President, vice president or other civil officer can be impeached for bribery, treason and "other high crimes and misdemeanors." The House study said "high crimes" were crimes no ordinary citizen but only those with the high responsibility of high office could commit. 
Again Nixon hedged in offering to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. He said he would do nothing to weaken the presidency, to compromise the rights of Watergate defendants or to impair the special prosecutor's case. He insisted that tapes and documents would be provided only if his Watergate lawyer, James D. St. Clair, is assured they will be kept confidential. 
Most of these were conditions he had not mentioned in the "personal note" that ended his State of the Union address in January. 

Nixon's tax payments 
Nixon's tax payments during 1969-72 were reduced by an estimated $235,000 through deductions taken for the gift of vice presidential papers. Sen. Russell B. Long, D-La., chairman of the House-Senate Committee on Internal Revenue studying the legality of the deduc­tions, has predicted the panel will ask Nixon to pay more taxes. 
Nixon appeared willing to concede that he might have to make an additional payment. "There is no question about my intent," in making the gift, he said, since the papers were delivered by March, 1969. 
But the paperwork was "apparently not concluded" in time to make the gift valid before the deduction was removed from the tax code, he said, and if the course he followed "was not the proper one, I will, of course, be glad to pay the tax." 
He said many others economist John Kenneth Galbraith, physicist Jerome Weisner, Sen. Hubert H. Hum!lbrey, D-Minn., and the late President Lyndon B. Johnson had taken similar deductions.

Candidates hold forum 
Charges leveled against Capp 
by Fred Graver Early morning Editor 
In a special forum held last night in the Stanford-Keenan chapel, the tickets of Rahill­Wordal, McLaughlin-Flanagan, Winiarczyk-Famula, Capp-Ericksen, Oberhardt-Collins, and Gahagan-O'Connell presented their platforms and answered questions in com­parison and challenge of each perspective ticket's proposals. 
The main issues were the off-campus situation, the Capp-Ericksen Stepan Center Basketball proposal, and Student Government-Administration relations. 
In response to a student charge that Ray Capp did not adequately research the proposal for winter basketball courts in Stepan Center, the candidate replied tilat "we didn't research it as well as some of our opponents did. It has been given the approval of the Student Affairs Central Staff." In a forum held at Morrissey hall last night, can­didate Pat McLaughlin said that the University Committee on Environmental Control had been investigating just recently the possibility of closing down Stepan Center in the winter because of the excessive use of heat and electricity. 
Other challenges to the proposal came from candidate Ed Rahill. In his speec,h to the crowd at the chapel, he reminded students that many promises can be made in a cam­paign that may not be kept once the President has been elected. Rahill stated that he had spoken to the chairman of the Architecture Department, and the proposed cost for the Capp-Ericksen plan is $44,000. The biggest problem would be the replacement of the Stepan Center floor, which is now covered by a high-gloss surface unfit for basketball. 
A student commented to Capp in the course of the Stanford-Keenan forum that the approval of the Student Affairs Central staff means little more than a promise to further investigate and research the matt«::r. The same kind of approval was given to the LaFortune renovation plans. Capp said, "Well, we'll just have to wait and see what the Vice-President of Student Affairs has to say about that." 
The proposaluf a food co-op for off-campus students was given much discussion. Ed Rahill called the ideaunfeasable, citing the fact that costs for wholesalers, butchers, and other overheads, as well as the cost of complying with state and federal laws would diminish almost completely any type of discount that would be offered to the st'udents. 
Capp and Eric~sen co~tered the charge by supplyuing a detailed list of beef prices, and the prospective savmgs that had been quoted to them by a leading wholesaler in South Bend. 
Candidate Andy Winiarczyk proposed setting up a co-op with the help of the food services at Notre Dame. Ed Rahill commented that the same idea had been im­plemented at Cornell University, with no success. 
A site for a co-op, in a department store building near Corby's, was proposed by the Oberhardt-Collins ticket. They also cited the feasibility of working to make food stamps more available to off-campus students. 
Pat McLaughlin, in an attempt to keep from making definite commitments towards plans that could not be determined as of yet, proposed publicizing food prices every week as a start in battling the high food prices off campus. 
In the midst of the forum, candidate Mike Gahagan charged those running for the Presidency with "missing the relevant issues." Gahagan said, ''These minor concessions can only mire the processes by which we can change the things that need to be changed." 
The problems of student rights and relations between the Student Government and the Administration were given a great deal of discussion at the forum. The Oberhardt­Collins ticket cited the disappearance of student rights, especially those of privacy and speech, as evidence of the "sickness of the the University." 
Ed Rahill stated that, in the area of diplomatic relations between Student Government and the Administration, it is necessary to have "a new position of student power". McLaughlin and his vice-presidential candidate, Frank Flanagan, promised the necessary leadership to implement the changes and plans that would deal with the ad­ministration in a practical way. 
Presidential candidate Ray Capp stressed that his ticket represented "primarily a service platform," and stated that he was "not a student activist,'' but believed in diplomatic confrontation. He proposed to work through the office of the Dean of Students in bringing about changes in the area of student rights.

Errata  

In Friday's Observer, Rob Tully, candidate for the District 6 seat on the SLC was quoted as saying that he wanted to see the SLC get in­volved in forcing students off­campus. Tully stated yesterday he meant that the SLC should get involved in the mechanics of moving students off-campus. 
Stan White, candidate from District 3, was inadvertently ommitted from the story. 
The headline on that article read that 17 students were campaigning for SLC seats. Actually, 15 students are in the election race. 
On Page 3 of Monday's Ob­server, it was reported that the Ed Rahill-Blake Wordall ticket received the endorcement of WSND along with "another presidential--vice-presidential ticket." The ticket receiving the · WSND endorsement with Rahill­Wordal was the Capp-Ericksen ticket.

"but since past governments' experience has been doing nothing, we're equal, at least, to them." 
Outlining the ideas of their platform, Villarosa, who lives off­campus, said, "Off-campus students have suffered some kind of stigma, it's some sort of hell or punishment to love off campus." 
They promised the creation of a food co-op, a student-run, non­profit serivce, that could appeal to various industries and offer them advertising in return for price discounts and other incentives. 
As for the social situation, Villarosa said, "Those that gripe the most do the least. We have to be social beings before any kind of social life begins, if people sit all night in their rooms, they have no right to complain." 
"I'd like to see social events originating in the halls, if people would take the initiative and do it. Maybe the University only offers an inch, but most of us only take a millimeter," he suggested. 
The Administration came in for criticism on several counts. "They don't consider the sensitivities of students," he said. "Hopefully, we're mature, responsible in­dividuals, and we should be treated as such." In particular, Villarosa refused to cower before any one figure, "Fr. Burtchaell feeds on fear, and the student body must not give that to him if they want things to be accomplished." 
Asked if he honestly believed students could change things, he replied, "Yes, obviously, why do you think we're trying to run? We have to be the spearhead for students, their spokesmen, if they want more athletic facilities, we'll pre:ss for that cause. We would inaugurate a weekly student government newsletter to ef­fectively communicate what's going on to the students." 


Admitting the role the alumni play as the power behind the ad­ministration, Villarosa concluded, "There is not one place in this university where the students are treated like adults; the ad­ministration are the parents, the students are children, and the alumni are the rich in-laws whose purse-strings control everything." 
ficult, if not impossible to keep," declared Ed Rahill in an interview last night. 
After speaking with the chair­man of the architecture depart­ment and other informed sources, Rahill explained that the floor of Stepan Center is unsuitable for running. "The floor is too slippery and the concrete surface is bad on feet and legs," Rahill explained. "A high gloss-low friction floor is highly unsuitable for athletic 1 events." 
One alternative is to remove 
the wax and apply acid to gain 1 
roughness but, "That us expensive· 
and creates great maintenance 
problems," according to Rahill. 
Rahill added that a resiliant tile 
will cost between $44,000 and $66,000 and a portable wooden floor would not suffice because it would ~;ender the floor unusable for other 
activities. " According to a high ministration official, the 
ministration was only considering spending no more than several hundred dollars," Rahill said convincingly. 
Another opposing ticket proposed an off-campus shuttle to besubsidizedby advertisements on the bus. Not stating any names Rahill said, "They have based their information on two large schools, The Universty of Texas and Iowa. Advertising will not work for such a small number of persons as the roughly 800 students at Notre Dame who would be using it." 
A food co-op has been proposed in the past and the reason that it hasn't worked to this date is because it's unfeasable, noted Rahill. "The overhead costs; license, rent, heat and students to run it is far too great. The taxes, property, utility, maintenance and insurance make the plan un,­

ad-feasable," he asserted. ad-Rahill then explained that the

Capp-Ericksen campaign offers new ideas 
by David Kaminski and Ken Girouard Staff Reporters 

In campaign appearances Monday night, Ray Capp and Greg Ericksen elaborated on their plans for a meat co-op, and an off­campus shuttle. They also called for more effective promotion of the foreign studies program and SBP attendance at the weekly meetings of the Student Affairs Committee Central Staff. In Morrissey Hall, Capp responded to challenges to his Stepan Center winter sports proposal. 
At St. Ed's Hall, Capp said he contacted the Wyatt Locker Plant in South Bend which quoted a price of $33 for 25 pounds of assorted cuts of meat. This averages to $1.32 cents per pound. 
The 25 pounds would include two cuts each of Round, T-Bone and Sirloin steak, 1 Boneless roast and 7 pounds of ground beef. When comparing prices for the same cuts of meat at local super­markets, Capp concluded that the student could save from 20 to 30 cents per pound on the average. 
Capp said students could place beef orders on Mondays to be delivered on Fridays. Wyatt Locker Plant offered Student Government the use of a freezer to store meat that students did not pick up. 
For students who did not wish to buy 25 pounds of meat at once, Ericksen suggested that they could break up the bundles. By raising the price of the steaks above $1.32 per pound, they could sell the ground beef for less and still save the students money. 
Capp said he was looking into the purchase of used busses from military installations for the off­campus shuttle-service. He said that ownership and insurance of the busses would be under the jurisdiction of the University. 
Capp stressed the importance of starting the shuttle bus schedule at the beginning of the fall semester. He said, "Our aim is to approach the students before they find other means of transportation." 


Oberhardt stresses more student rights 
by Jack D'Aurora Staff Reporter 

"Our basic point is the return of student rights," said Bill Oberhardt before a group of Sorin Hall students last night. "During I 
the  past  couple  years  we've  
watched  student  rights disap­ 
pear."  

Oberhardt cited the clause in the housing contract stipulating the University's right to conduct searches, and feels that "students have no privacy." He brought up the possibility of legally defeating the clause as did the students at Boston University. 
In addition, "The judicial system has got to change," said Oberhardt. "The appeals court have never overturned a decision. Also, if a student is found innocent before the judicial board, the dean of students can appeal the case and try him again." 
Oberhardt then pointed to particular instances where he felt that students were denied their rights. He mentioned Fr. Burt­chaell's defending statement for the new calendar that 72 class days were necessary to remain ac­credited, which although found to be false, did not prohibit the calendar's passage. 
Oberhardt then referred to the Dillon Hall incident in which the student was told, according to Oberhardt, that the case would be handled with the "utmost candor," yet was all over campus. 
"Like H'man said, I'm tired of being treated like children in a sand box," said the presidential candidate. He offered the LaFortune renovation as an example, where student govern­ment worked on the plans only to have them negated by Fr. Burt­chaell. 
On the problems of off-campus life, the candidate stated, "The Student Affairs Office does nothing for the off-campus. The Office seems to feel that he's on his own." 
Oberhardtt~resented his plan for the off-campus student. Of primary importance is to convince the University to force standards on the landlords by means of sending out committees to evaluate houses. ­
These committees could pressure the landlords by threatening them with their own building violations, which could lead to their shut down. "The University owes such co-operation since it forces its students off­campus," said Oberhardt. 
He also plans a student run food co-op which would sell non­perishable goods at reduced prices. Oberhardt has a site in mind near Corby's, and feels that "the least the University can do is give us a loan." 
Last in his off-campus plan is an office where students could obtain information on food stamps, for which some students qualify, and on cheaper food prices. 
Capp and Ericksen urged more effective promotion of the foreign studies program. By increasing the number of sophomores going overseas, more room would be made on campus for students remaining at Notre Dame. 
Ericksen suggested that he and Capp might sit in on the weekly meeting of the 14 member Student Affairs Central Staff. 
"By sitting in on the meetings," Ericksen said, "we'd try to prevent the administration from passing anything without students knowing what's going on." 
In Morrissey Hall, Capp and Ericksen were joined by McLaughlin and Flanagan, Gahagan and O'Connelr, and Bill Oberhardt. Each candidate spoke on his platform and answered questions from the floor. 
SBP candidate Pat McLaughlin asked Capp about the University Energy Conservation Committee's plan to shut down Stepan Center during the winter months to save on heat and electricity. 
Capp assured the crowd, however, that the winter basketball plan for Stepan Center has been approved and the University has funds for the project.. 
Also at Morrissey, Ericksen said that the parietals issue should be under the control of the individual hall staffs. 
"Once something leaves the hall," Ericksen said, "the rector is saying that he has lost control of the hall." 
Capp and Ericksen, who share half of the WSND endorsement with Rahill and Wordal, continue campaigning Tuesday with stops at Zahm, Dillon, Grace and possibly Badin.

he "doesn't direct his program to

One issue to be explored, ac­

The Next SLC 
There is one major difference between the candidates for SBP and the can­didates for SLC-experience. The SLC race has attracted a group of reasonable "green" candidates in search of a seat on the tri-partite board. 
The fact that all of the candidates lack prior SLC experience, few have any judicial or hall experience and most have failed to do "their homework" in an­ticipation of their running for this body says something about the SLC. 
That statement is intensified by the fact that none of the student members of the SLC are running for re-election. Can it be that the action in the SLC-or the actual inaction in many cases-is frustrating enough to limit students to one term on the board before they bail out? 
This is what many of these students running for the SLC must supply­continuity and stability to help fight the frustrations of the council. The can­didates are a young group. The inex­perience will wear off quickly as this year's members learned. Hopefully, they will dedicate themselves to a more viable and continuous student membership on the SLC. 
The candidates are rated as recom­mended, satisfactory or questionable. Then in bold print will be listed The Observer's choice for the SLC representative in each disctrict.

The SLC can still be an effective and viable political force on campus. The ability of the SLC to affect change was demonstrated with the work on the student guidelines this year. That kind of ability to bring about change can also work for student-initiated proposals, but that requires hard work, homework and continuity. Hopefully, these factors will come with the new members.

Poster Polling 
Ja..ph abell 
Now that the Student Body President race has brought all the campus heavy-thinkers and righteous saviors of studentkind from out of the woodwork (where they do God knows what the rest of the year), perhaps it's time to say a few words about one of the more untalked­about aspects of the SBP-8BVP campaigns (got the alphabet soup right?) : the everpresent abundancy of posters. 
These wonderfulll" by 17" gaudy gems of propaganda that bom­bard one's eyes from the time he makes his morning toilet to the last nauseating Huddleburger just before bedtime oftentimes become a mainstay of campus .life (you can still see some Floyd Kezele-­remember him?-stickers in the basement of Morrissey). They do have their advantages, however: the john stalls would never otherwise be so brightly wallpapered. 
The first poster is that of Mr. McLaughlin. A fairly blah yello.v poster that highlights pictures (what else?) of Mr. McLaughlin and friend Flanagan, asks the eternal question, "Back to school?" Though possibly confusing to the reader who thinks perhaps that Mr. McLaughlin is asking if he should return to campus after the elections, the poster redeems itself by clearly identifying the candidates (assuming of course. that Campus Press hasn't mixed up the pic­tures). 
The next poster is a brilliant orange and sports a marvelous reproduction of a Doonesbury comic strip, no dobut lifted very com­petently froma Doonesbury paperback book, and proclaiming defiantly that "the trees don't go to Notre Dame." Urging the voter to support Mr. Shankel and Mr. McErlean, the poster seems to ignore the fact that though trees don't go to ND, there's still a lot of dead­wood around. One would also have to wonder if the copyright fees for using Doonesbury is included in the $50 limit set by the Election Committee. 
Next we have what is perhaps the best looking poster of the bunch: the Villarosa-Zimsky white-on-black. Ignoring for the moment that it's a ripoff of a ripoff (Alka-Seltzer via Volkswagen), whoever designed it is quite good; I sincerely applaud him. The only real problem is the text material, which reads like a law student's day-old homework. And how "united" can complaining get? Like I said, it looks nice. 
Number for on our list of goodies is a simple one: the Winiarczyk­
Famula quickie. Not bothering to waste time on fancy artwork (ar any artwork for that matter), this ticket relies on the old American tradition of a catchy slogan. Not a bad idea; while the brightness (or sickness) of the other candidates' posters slugs you, many might remember the "win" in Winiarczyk. They won't necessarily remember anything else, but they'll remember that. Which, come to think about it, might be just enough. 
Fifthly, we have a rather loud example of Campus Press artistry. Messrs. Rahill and Wordal don't seem to be satisfied with the large black letters of their names; hence, they heap dayglo red on top of it, 
with a picture of Darby O'Gill to boot.One wonders how Darby feels about his impromptu endorsement (also about his presentation as the exemplar of "Honesty, Integrity and Experience." But maybe we'd better ask the females who saw him on his recent birthday about that). 
The next "poster" is really a group of handout-like sheets proclaiming the virtues of Messrs. Capp and Ericksen. Some have pictures (one of just a lot of smoke around Mr. Capp-getting ready for those back room conferences already, maybe?), others don't. Though looking at some·of them seems to bring littleto mind but off-key strains of "Mrs. Robinson," <Cu-cu-ca-choo!) perhaps the best poster is the one that "defines what a "ray-cap" is. And maybe the most significant part is listed under "ray:" "A thing of small stature." As for Leonardo, isn't there somthing about not using "streakers" as promo gimmicks? 
Next we have the "Irish Liberation Front," whatever the hell that is (I wonder if it's like when Mike Hess and his buddy from Florida ran on the same ticket: would that be a "Palm Beach Front?"). But let's hope Gahagan doesn't get the run-around when he tries to explain what kind of disease "chronic tokenism" is, or sidetracked when discussing "student involvement." 
Finally, we have an Oberhardt and Collins. Enhancing a ripped-off Observer picture (it's easy to do; you start with a pair of scissors...) is the grim statement that the "University's function is to serve students... believe it or not!" Well, Ripley they ain't, but gosh, to be a naive underclassman again. 
There are other posters, much too numerous to go into, in additon to the attractive, and oftentimes funny, "platform" sheets (for instance: 
I never knew Oberhardt and Collins to be such close confidants of University administrators to know Farley's and BP's fate a full month in advance. It's a shame more of us can't share the University's trust, but then again, we can't all be campus personalities), but we must end our examination of campus litter ( Ooops, I mean literature). suppose I'll miss it all next year; after all, when I was an un­derclassman, the joke candidates usually admitted it. But then again, they won, didn't they?

Rundown on SLC candidates views listed 
Tuesday, February 26, 1974 the observer 
5 
by Gary Alietta and Greg Rowinski Staff Reporters 

Tomorrow along with the SBP elections, s~ SLC candidates will be chosen. Yesterday, the Ob­server polled each candidat~ in each district for some fmal remarks. Following is a capsule of what each candidate said. 
District 1 
Doug Stevenson, candidate in District 1, sees the main problem facing the SLC as an organizational one. To help meet this, he would begin imm~iately to set up an off-campus off1ce or center. 
Stevenson sees parietals as a 
touchy issue, which must be 
handled tactfully. He would "feel 
out" before beginning to prod it. 
He sees the need for a universal 
code of jurisdiction, which would 
strengthen hall boards and 
establish a set appeals procedure. 
Marty O'Shea, SLC candidate 
from Keenan, sees the Student 
Government's abdication of power 
in the last two years as the main 
issue in this campaign. 
"The trick is to start over again 
to build the power structure, he 
said. O'Shea feels that students 
can get recognition of their 
competency through the smooth 
operation of present services and 
through the establishment of some 
new ones. 
O'Shea hopes to help regain student power, and, at the same time, "stop the abuses of in­dividual liberties and dignity." 
District 2 
Darlene Palma, SLC candidate in District 2, pledges to work closely with the SBP and SBVP to get the LaFortune Renovation going. 
"I would like to represent the students in District 2 in a manner which the faculty and ad­ministration can't ignore," Palma said. She then pledged to "do my best" to represent the students' view when the calendar is again studied in December. 
Phyllis Mosley, SLC candidate from Breen-Phillips, would like the SLC to assume the role of problem­solver. 
"I think the SLC can be an ef­fective tool for the students to get their opinions across," she said. 
She finds satisfaction representative role. Last' year's SLC was effective, she said.  in not  that very  
District 3  

Mike Gassman, SLC candidate in District 3, would like to see pressure being taken off the ap­peals board by letting hall boards handle such cases. 
SLC has been losing power, according to Gassman. "By going around in the district, through hall meetings and monthly newsletters, I can keep the student interest in the SLC, ,-he said. 
He feels that, with student support, the SLC can get things done. 
Brian Hegarty, SLC candidate from Keenan, would publicize publicize SLC meetings and votes. 
Hegarty proposed that polls and newsletters be published periodically so that interested students could let their opinions be known and apply pressure on those voting against their interests. 
"I think that the Student Government should not hesitate to use confrontation when necessary," he said. 
Phil Mancini, SLC candidate from Holy Cross, said that he can only represent students when he knows what they want. 
"Monthly newsletters are not 
enough. Personal contact can not 
just be one-way," he said. "I will 
go around visiting sections to know 
how they feel to represent them 
fairly." 

One of the reasons he is running, 
he added, is that he had never met 
his SLC representative. 

Stan White, SLC candidate from 
Holy Cross, promises to work for 
the students' interest. 

"A vote for me is a vote for a 
person-for you--for the people's 
interest," White said. 

White's opening comments were 
inadvertently left out of Friday's 
campaign. 
District 4 

All three candidates in the district are from Grace Hall. Joe Fiorella, a freshman, felt the Judicial codes were outdated and 
Gahagan reasserts need for greater student representation on councils 
by Gary Allietta Staff Reporter 

During a four-ticket forum last night in the Morrissey lobby, Mike Gahagan stressed the need for a 50 per cent student representation on the two major campus councils. 
"Everyone is attempting to attain the same goals," Gahagan noted, "but the key to these goals is representation." 
All of the ideas brought out in the forum were good, Gahagan pointed out. Instead of going for a lot of little things, such as extended parietals or a modified LaFortune, students should go for the one big victory, equal representation, he said. 
"That way we won't have to fight the Administration as hard,"

a e r er 

SBP candidate Pat McLaughlin and his vice-presidential running mate, Frank Flanagan, appeared in a forum in Morrissey's lobby last night. Candidates Capp, Oberhardt, and Gahagan were the other tickets rep~esented.. 
The main 1ssue m the McLaughlin-Flanagan platform dealt with the administration. To get proposals to the administration they must go throu~h the various committees usmg strong arguments, reason and tact. 
One important issue this ticket 

wants to change is the judicial 
code. Flanagan explained the 
system as it now stands. 
A student can go to the 
University Board and be found 
guilty for some offense and then go 
to the board of Appeals and be 
declared innocent. Macheca can 
take the case to Fr. Hesburgh who 
has the power to expel the student, 
though. , 

Besides0 changing this system, the candidates want to advise students oftheir rights on what to do if they get in a problem. Bad advice may cause a student to make a wrong decision and have his rights l~st in the process. . 
The candidates wan~ to take th1s through SLC. to get 1t changed.. They also pomted out the SLC IS currently working on the t:!robl~m. 
On the. off-<;ampus sttuatton, McLaughlin sa1d they had only student-oriented proposals. The ticket has to have stopgap measur~s _until _they ca~ deal with the adm1mstrat10n. Bastca~y ~ey want to work for a food pnce hst, publication of laws dealing with tenants, building, health ~nd safety codes, an~ altern~tlVe forms of transportabon"-possibly a computerized car pool system. 
A question as brought up about the proposed portable basketball courts being put in Stepan Center. McLaughlin stated that he and Flanagan had talked with Student Affairs earlier in the day and said nqthing.:definite was planned. He said the university's energy commission might shut down Stepan Center to conserve energy. Also, Mardi Gras is during the time the courts would be in use, and ROTC drills would present a conflict. No money was approved so far, they added. 
Greg Erickson, SBVP candidate with Ray Capp, argued that he' had also talked to student affairs and said they gave a unanimous ap­proval. The courts could be moved during Mardi Gras. 
McLaughlin commented that things "shouldn't seem definite when they are not." He added, "It is a good plan, a good proposal, but I'm sorry we made an issue out of it." 
Appearing later on at Keenan 
chapel, McLaughlin again stressed 
that the main plank of their 
platform was dealing with the 
administration. One question was ' 
asked about an off-campus student 
fund: a sum of money set aside for 
the use of o-c students proposed by 
Rahill. McLaughlin elaborated 
that the o-c wouldn't need a lot of 
money if things were run the right 
way. 

vague, and that outcomes were not defined. He also felt that the calendar issue created apathy among the students. 
Denis Sullivan, a sophomore, believes the University should change from catering to alumni and luring prospective students to helping current students. 
He does not advocate 24 hour parietals, however. "I'd like to see hall autonomy on some issues," he explained, "including parietals." 
Sophomore ChucJt Wilson plans to maintain close contact with the hall councils and the HPC. He also contends that the Administration should come together with students to get things done. 
"The hall is the center of student social life," Wilson stated. "Reform in the area of visitation is inevitable." 
District 5 
Tom Clark, a junior from 
Alumni, advocates the handling of 
student violators within the hall. 
He believes that Alumni Hall 
government, which uses this 
system, is effective. 
"I don't think we should have 24 
hour parietals, but there should be 
a modification of the present 
system," Clark added. 
John Farrell, a Dillon junior, 
said the most important job of an 
SLC  member  is  to  present  the  
students'  views  rather  than  his  
own.  

"A member should be respon­sible to the students against the Administration, with an eye to the Administration, too," Farrell said. 
He also feels that only the student body and faculty should have had a vote on the proposed calendar for next year. 
District 6 

Both candidates are from Morrissey. 
Rob Tully, a freshman, stated that SLC members must get firmer and not allow the Administration to pressure them into decisions. 
"The SLC is working on parietals right now," Tully said. "Macheca has been stepping out of bounds and infringing on students rights." He added that students have more power than they think. 
Art Derse, a sophomore, feels that more "open forums" are needed at SLC meetings to allow students a greater voice in government. 
Also, human sexuality laws should be more clearly written and violators should know of thei; rights to a J-board hearing. He also expressed a need for party and coffee houses within the dorms.

At least $100 hike 
New rise in tuition coming 
by Ken Bradford 
Staff Reporter 

Notre Dame students should expect at least a one hundred dollar increase in next year's tuition, Vice-President for Business Affairs Fr. Jerome Wilson stated yesterday. 
Fat Tuesday slims wallets 
NEW ORLEANS (UPI) Carnival rolled Monday toward Mardi Gras-to the accompani­ment of clanging cash regis­ters, tinkling glasses and chattering teeth in French Quarter bars and nightspots. 
The affluent rented $50 a night hotel rooms. 
The bearded and long-haired slept in "crash pads," or rolled up in sleeping bags on the Mississippi River levees. 
They all were gathered to have what fun they could in the time left before midnight Tuesday, when the 40 days of Lent begin. . 
For the thousands of people who wear masks, body paint and costumes, some of them the briefest imaginable, the weatherman forecast a very chilly morning, but a sunny day warmed things up to about 60. 
"It's wall-to-wall crowd and much, much larger than last year," one policeman. said. "It seems like the number of drunks, disturbing the peace and loitering cases have in­creased." 
"It's really too early to tell exactly how much the increase will be, but tuition will have to go up more than a hundred dollars," Fr. Wilson said. 
"We're trying to keep all in­creases at the lowest figures possible and this is forcing us to spend a lot of time considering next year's budgets," Fr. Wilson explained. 
The Budget Committee will eventually recommend to Fr. Hesburgh the increase it feels is necessary. 
The tuition increase is expected to help offset increases in salary, supplies, and repair expenses, Fr. Wilson noted. 
"A five per cent increase in salaries alone requires about an extra hundred dollars per student, including graduate students," Fr. Wilson stated. 
He also noted that the rising cost of food has administrators con­cerned about the charge for student room and board. 
According to Fr. Wilson, reports from other universities such as Brown, Boston University, Stanford, and Yale show average tuition increases for next year of two hundred dollars. 
When asked if tuition prices will soon level off, Fr. Wilson said, "I'm in my twenty-second year on the job and there has been only one year when we didn't have to have a tuition increase." 
Extra fee proposed for over 17 credits 
by Andy Swanfeldt Staff Reporter 

A proposal for students to pay an additional fee for each course over the seventeen credit limit has once again been brought before the Academic Council. Presently, students must obtain the per­mission of their dean to be allowed to take more than seventeen credits per semester. 
The only exceptions to 17 hour rule are those who are majoring in Architecture or Engineering. It is quite hard for these students to take less than 17 credits to fulfill their requirements. 
Dean Thompson, associate dean for the College of Arts and Letters, said that he did not know when the proposal would come before the Academic Council. He explained that "The proposal has to be given to the council and then shown to all the deans for approval. At this time it is only a proposal." ­
It has also been mentioned that students who drop a course during one semester and then want to take it again the following semester will have to pay more the second time around. 
This proposal has bearing on all courses within the College of Arts and Letters , and could pose a problem for AL majors.

InPIRG attempts to assess optional fees 
by Judy Peterson Starr Reporter 

InPIRG, the Public Interest Research Group, began its drive Monday to assess each student $3.00 beginning next fall. InPIRG is a nationwide organization which deals with consumer issues and grievances. It serves to amplify the ordinary citizen's voice, providing a balance between the consuming public and private enterprise. 
The $3.00 fee is strictly optional. Although it would automatically be 
charged  to  the  student's  bill,  a  
designated  ·~em  would  be  
established  to  refund  the  full  

amount to those students who do not wish to contribute. A total of 66 students will can­
vass the halls at Notre Dame this week circulating the petitions for the assessment. Booths are being set up in the library and the Huddle to reach off-campus students. The library booth will be open from 6 pm to 11 pm. There are no set hours for the Huddle booth, which will be in operation during the day. 
A meeting will be held Wed­nesday night at 10:00 in the lobby of LeMans Hall to set up the St. Marys' petition drive, which will begin Sunday afternoon. 
Ken Hughes, who is heading the drive, stressed the fact that more volunteers are needed at both schools. Students interested in helping may sign up Wednesday night or contact Hughes at InPIRG headquarters, which is located in the basement of LaFortune. 
The 16th Collegiate Jazz Festival will be presented by the University of Notre Dame on April 4-6. This festival will bring 20 college bands and combos from around the country to Notre Dame to compete before a group of eminent judges from the jazz world. 
Willis Conover will be the master of ceremonies this year. The judges will include Roy Haynes ­drums, Ahmad Jamal -piano, Charlie Haden -bass, Billy Harper, who plays for the Gil Evans band ­tenor sax, Bill Watrous-trombone, and Dan Morgenstern, former editor of Down Beat. 
The festival opens on Thursday, the fourth, with a Symposium in the Library Auditorium at 7:30 
p.m. This event is similar to the Blindfold Test, popularized by Down Beat. The judges will give opinions on recordings played for them and will also answer questions from the audience. 
On Friday, the fifth, the opening music session will be held in Stepan Center. At 7:30 p.m., six large bands and combos from various colleges will start the competition. 
The remaining bands and combos will compete on Saturday, the sixth, in two separate sessions, 
1:00 p.m. and 7:30p.m. At mid­night, on Saturday, the judges will close the festival by holding their own jam session.
