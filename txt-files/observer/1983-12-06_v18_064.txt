ND activism 
Dear l:'llitor: 
In lkcemher 2nd's Observer, Michad G. Rahh made St.·veral misleading and unsubstan­tiated remarks about "campus liherab" who are involved in organizations protesting against nuclear weapons which I would like to respond to: 

I 
) It is detlnitdy not the "in" thing to he "nudt:arly aware" -rather, there i!-> a prepon­dt·rance of ignorance about nucle.1r arms ­how may people know what the following acronyms art· tiJr: ICBM, MX, Nt:TS, ABM? llow may peopk know who in our govern­nn:nt would be responsible for the tkcision to ust· a nudt·ar weapon~ 

2) 
It was not without malice that tht· words "arnlt'd" and "mongt·rs" wt•rt· ust·d in describ­ing nuclt-ar fret·ze advocates and to compart· lt-aders of tht· freeze movemt·nt with militaf)' dktators. 


5) 
Mr. Raah insinuatt·d that thost· involved in tht· nudear arms issue know littk about the cau.,t·s of wars or about social injustict:. The oppositt· of what ht· said is trut·: the pt·ople on this campus who are involn·d in this issue are some of the most inf(Jrmed at Notre Danw about international affairs, including the con­tlius oftht· Third World. I know from my own t·xpericnce that many of them are enmomics, gon·rnmt·nt. history and PL'i majors so it is falst· to say that they do not han· an under­standing of the complt·xitit·s of world afffairs. Many of them han· htTll abroad and done volunteer work and social justice work. Not a ft·w han· htTn to Washington for a semest~:r or on the Spring St·mestt·r in D.C. The philosophy of one group on campus, Ground Zt'fo. is sokly nlucation about nuclear issues 


stl that peopk can malle their own informed decisions. 
4) What was the purpost: of Mr, Raab's lener? To tell people, "don't let your emotions affect you, you might end up being commined to somt: thing." I thought that is what life is about, commi:ting yourselfto a greater cause.

Independence 

DearEditor: 
"What does The Observer mean by in­dependence? WI! collect S70,000 a year for them from the students. As a management professor I see no way that this is indepen­dence. If a Notre Dame business major thought that this was financial indepen­dence be would not receive his degree. We cannot collect money from students and then not beable to aa·ountfor u•hat happens to it." 
Father Tyson's comment in the Nov. issue ofScbolaslic is off the mark. As a Notre Dame business major who plans to receive a degree in May, I beg to differ. As I see it, The Obseroer has two sources of revenue -paid-in capital 

supplied by tht· students (not the University) 
and internally gent:rated funds derived from 
advertising and subscriptions. 
This situation, in effect, makes the students 
stockholders and the University nothing more 
than a collection agency. And, as any business 
major knows, it is the stockholder who gives 
the ultimate approval for major changes in the 
budgeting system and top officials. The only 
claim a collecting a~ency should have on the 
company is as a creditor in that it should 
receive a fee for its services. 

Thus, the decision whether or not to become a part ofthe University budget system should be made by the students. Like any other "stockholder" company, a proxy should he tallen. Ifthe students think the budget sys­tem is necessary to protect their investment, they can vote for the budget system. If they fed that such a control mechanism may, in a real or perceived way, threaten the indepen­dence ofthe paper, they can vote against it. 
A lot of talk has been flying around about what The Observer wants and about what the administration wants. It's time to stop ignor­ing the only people who have the right to malle a decision on the budgeting -those who supply the funds, the students.

~-:~.iitor"  wrillen  by  Michad  Raah  in  last  
l'riday's  Obsen•er.  Raah  t·xprt·ssnl  dismay  
t·oru..Trning  the  motivations  and  mental  

reasoning of what ht· tt·rmt·d "liberals" ontht· Notrt· Damt· campus. All of tht:st· events dealt with somt· asptTI of"liht'falism." 
Notre Damt·. a socially and politically ac­tivist campus in tht· late '60s and early '70s, and a campus which became more con­servative and apathetic in the aftermath of Vil'tnam, is about to be transformed again. The pendulum is about to reverse course, and lihnalism will again become "fashionable" within the Notre Dame student body. 
What art· our motivations for promoting all of the "right causes" here? Are we genuinely and wholly concerned individuals, or is it merdy fa.~hionabk to take a stand upon a soapbox again?" 
In the past few months I have been increas­ingly concerned with the simplistic reasoning of the libnal faction hne at Notre Dame -in political issues ranging from the invasion of Grenada to the deployment of missiles in Europe, in campus issues such as the Cap'n Crunch promotion to the feud between The Obsen•er and the administration, we have wit­nessed petty, simplistic and reactionary reasoning proliferate on the part of both con­st·rvatives and liberals at Notre Dame. 
Beyond superficially "noble" intentions on tht· part of some individuals lies a skewed reasoning and a distorted sense of purpose within others. The liberal faction at N'o has become highly visible these day!>, in part, be­cause of the abseoce of a vocal conservative opposition. Let's face it -it is simply not too cool these days to hold a demos~ration favor­ing nuclear war or gluttony, positions which the liberal faction has sometimes charac­terized their counterparts as advocating. 
As Michael Raab notes, it is somewhat trou­
bling to view the same faces at every rally 
associated with liberal causes at Notre Dame. 
The liberal community has failed in its efforts 
to reach out and embrace a campus and a stu­
dent body which seems to care little about 
liberal viewpoints, and considers the liberals 
to be quixotic crusaders, or "mean-wells." 
The rallies and causes of liberals here at Notre Dame do not really invite opposition and discussion, but seem to serve as a sclf­congradulating vehicle for liberals through which "to malle a stand." At least we have grown beyond the point ofplaying folk music at every rally or demonstration to express solidarity. 
We need reason and logic in our debates and discussions. We need to balance ideology with realism. We must be sure of the truth of our motives before we can convince others. In serious socio-political debate, there is link room for rhetoric. 
We must end the reactionism which has dominated debate on this campus throughout the semester. We must avoid "depersonalizing" those who disagree with our positions, whether liberal or con­servative. We must be willing to listen. 
But most of all, we need hope. Without hope, there can be no beauty, no joy and no cohesive force which will motivate the indif­ferent. 
I applaud the efforts of those who are wil­ling to stand up and be counted here at Notre Dame, whatever their position. But we should not oversimplify issues. We cannot consider seriously words of rhetoric. We should not admire or be swayed by persons so obsessed with activist liberalism that we feel they would speall out on any issue which they sensed to be fashionable. 
And Notre Dame's reaction to the activism of the liberal community here at Notre Dame seems to confirm these tenets.

Kuhn calls for support from baseball owners 
Associatrd Prrss 

NASHVILLE, Tenn. -Lame-duck Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, saying he had made so many retirement speeches he felt like Muhammad Ali, urged baseball executives yesterday to give his unnamed successor strong support. 
Kuhn, serving out a tenure that has lasted nearly I 5 years, sounded this warning in his traditional opening speech at baseball's annual winter meetings. Kuhn failed to gain re-election to a third term last November in Chicago, and a search committee headed by Milwaukee Brt:wers owner Bud Selig has been

Relays. The Irish won five con­secutive events in the relays and set a new record at 7: I 5:52 in the 800­yard freestyle relay. 
"We were fortunate to get the entire team in and to get the spirit running," grinned Stark as he dis­played the first place trophy sitting looking for a new commissioner since. 
"I urge you to look at history, which will take you back to 1921 when a curly-haired, old federal judge was about to become baseball's first commissioner," Kuhn said in reference to Kenesaw "Mountain" Landis. 
"Not only did he write the major league agreement, but he said he wanted more than just a legal docu­ment. He wanted a moral covenant with ownership to steadfastly sup­port the commissioner ..." 
A report from Selig's committee is on the agenda for Thursday.

This Friday, the men's team will entertain Northern Illinois Univer­sity. On Saturday, the men's and women's squads will face Cleveland State University at the Rockne Memorial. Stark is hesitant to predict how the Irish will fare hut an­ticipates close races.

Phelps says he is confident the 
team's offense will improve. 
"I still think we'll get better of­
fensively," he said. "We can't afford 
to shoot 33 percent ...on the road 
and expect to win. The shots are 
there; we just must have more 
patience and do a better job with 
our offensive rebounding." 
The Irish, now 3-2, will be on the 
road tomorrow night when they 
meet Northwestern at Evanston, Ill., 
so Phelps has only one practice to 
try to improve the offense before 
that game. 
Terrier coach Gene Roberti ad­
mitted his team was well-beaten in 
the second half. 
If Notre Dame can put together some good offense and continue to play strong defense, then tomor­row's game at Northwestern should be a good one.
