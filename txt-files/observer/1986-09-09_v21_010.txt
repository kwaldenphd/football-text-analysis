Bomb blast hits Paris; 1 killed, 17 wounded 
Associated Press 
PARIS -A bomb exploded yesterday in a post office on the ground floor of Paris' or­nate I 7th-century city hall, killing a woman and injuring 
19 other people. 
The bomb blew out the win­dows and window frames on one side of the building and devastated the interior of the post office. It came four days after a bomb failed to explode on a crowded commuter train in central Paris. 
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the latest attack, which occurred about 7 p.m. 
Paris police chief Jean Paolini said the bomb at city hall had been placed "on or under a bench in the post of­fice." 
One witness said he saw two men leave the area just before the explosion. "I saw two Arab-type men flee the post officejust before the ex­plosion," he said. "One of them was about 35 and wore a mustache." 
The fire department placed the casualty toll at one dead and 19 injured, one of them seriously. A witness said the woman who died was "completely blown apart." 
The plaza in front of city hall was littered with glass shards and wood splinters. Inside, panels from the post office's ceiling were hanging down, criss-crossed with ripped out wiring. Furniture was smashed, wood was burned, and the carpeting was ripped to shreds.

RASTA announces forced abolishment for rule violations 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Most new infertility treatments are morally acceptable, but the practice of one woman carry­ing another's fetus should be restricted, a medical ethics committee said yesterday. 
In the first major report ex­amining the ethics of new repro<fuctiv(~ technology, a committee of doctors, lawyers and ethicists said practices such as artificial in­semination and using donor sperm and eggs for produc­ing test tube babies is morally acceptable in most cases. 
However, the panel said some other procedures should be classified as ex­perimental and not used routinely until more is known about them. 
The committee, estab­lished by the American Fer­tility Society, which represents I 0, 000 doctors, scientists and specialists dealing with fertility, said it had "serious ethical reserva­tions" about surrogate mot­herhood. 
The group called for "inten­sive scrutiny" of the practice because of legal and ethical By TROY DUNCAN · 
News staff 
Tim Griffy, president of Rally Against Starvation, in­formed the student senate last night that RASTA is banned from the University. 

Griffy received a letter from Joni Neal, the director of stu­dent activities, that cited al­cohol and drug use at a RASTA sponsored concert last year as the reason for the club's abolishment. 
In her letter, Neal says the presence of "alcohol and drugs was obvious," and that marijuana paper and other paraphernalia were confis­cated by security. 
Griffy says that the organi­zation has "been unfairly dealt with," and that it is "extreme to abolish a club" due to a few individuals at a single event. He pointed out that the club had 22 other events last year without any problems. 
In the letter, Neal noted that the rugby club, which volun­teered to secure the front doors at the concert, was also cited for their drunken na­ture, and the club was dis­banded. 
Griffy said he feels that se­curity should have dealt with the guilty individuals. 
As one RASTA member pointed out, the University does not cancel football games or pep rallies even though alcohol clearly exists at these events. 
RASTA is "a very human and sympathetic cause, that they (the University) cannot push aside," summed up an­other member. 
The issue of police inter­vention at off campus parties was also brought before the student senate. 
Student Body President 
Mike Switek says he plans to 
meet with police officials in 
the near future to discuss the 
matter. 
John Gardiner, the senator from district one, also will contact Legal Services re­garding student's rights.

Observer Campus Network is beginning of student voice 
No, OCN is not a new cable channel. 
No, OCN is not a new form of cocaine. 
No, OCN is not the name of a new terrorist 
organization. 
OCN is the new Observer Campus Network. It is a new approach to capturing student opinion in a timely and effective manner and filtering this information across campus. 
The idea for the network occurred because so many students, administrators and organ­izations on campus would call The Observer wondering what the students' atttitude on a specific issue was. 
Usually, the only sources available to guage opinion were personal and isolated experiences with a small number ofstudents. No one knew if these experiences were re­flective of actual student opinion. As a result, the student voice went unheard. 
The usefulness of such a polling network becomes apparent when one considers prominent issues last year where student in­put was lacking. 
When last year's student body president 
pushed through a raise in the student activ­
ities fee, for example, he indicated that was 
what the students really wanted and what 
they would have presented to the Board of 
Trustees. 
Was this true? Would you have supported 
the increase? Since the OCN didn't_ exist, no 
one knows. 
Presently there are several areas in which 
the campus network can guage student 
opinion. 
Now that it's done, what do students think 
of the new War Memorial? 
Do students think the campus-widejudicial council system for representing students in disciplinary action is effective?

Over the next few months, the questions will vary, but the purpose will remain the same. With your help, the OCN will probe the campus, draw out your opinions, and clarify the voice of the students on this campus.

Board hears proposal for LeMans ntini-mall 
By SHARON HEGG 
News Staff 
The creation of a mini-mall in the basement of LeMans Hall was suggested byJeanne Heller, Saint Mary's student body president, at last night's meeting of the Saint Mary's Board of Governance. 
Heller said that because of dissatisfaction of Saint Mary's students over the recent closing of the dry-cleaning service in the basement of LeMans Hall, she met with Sister Karol Jackowski, dean of student affairs, to discuss possible solutions. Jackowski then sent a proposal to create the mini-mall to Controller and Business Manager Jason Lindower. 
This mall would consist of a dry-cleaning service, a florist, a shoe repair service and possibly a movie rental

Trial delayed for driver in Hurley's hit and run 
By TRIPP BALTZ 

News Editor 
The court case for Mary 

Beth Gallivan, the alleged 
driver of the car that struck 
Kevin Hurley, was postponed 
today because Gallivan's at­
torney forgot to prepare a 
plea bargain. 
Judge Gerome Frese 

decided to defer the case to 
Sept. 17. Gallivan is expected 
to enter a guilty plea, accor­
ding to her attorney, Victor 
Mcfadden. 
According to Mcfadden, 

the responsibilty ofpreparing 
the plea lies with either the 
deputy prosecutor or the at­
torney for the defense. 
Mcfadden said the prosecll­
tor had left the duty of writing 
the plea to the defense. "It 
was just an oversight," said 
Mcfadden. "Itjust slipped my 
mind." 
The plea bargain had been worked out between the defense and the prosecution before the case came to court, Mcfadden said. It is a law in St. Joseph County that the plea bargain be in writing when presented to the court, according to Mcfadden. 
When a defendant enters a plea on a case, the court asks if the individual has entered the plea voluntarily, Mcfad­den said. The defendant is surrendering to the decision of the court if they enter a plea, said Mcfadden. 
Mcfadden said the prose­cutor agreed to remain silent as part of the plea bargain. After a thirty-day period, the judge will deliver a sentence based upon the defendant's plea and a pre-sentence report prepared by the pros­ecutor's office, Mcfadden said.

Chilean opposition leaders arrested t:~­

in search for president's assailants 
Associated Press 
SANTIAGO, Chile -Security forces yesterday arrested op­position leaders and raided leftist strongholds in slum areas to search for the would­be assassins who ambushed President Augusto Pinochet's motorcade. 
Three leading dissidents and three French activist priests were among those said to have been arrested. Five news magazines were banned. 
"The government has enough support to do whatever it wants," declared Pinochet, his hand bandaged, as he arrived for work and waved to scores of applaud­ing supporters outside the presidential palace. 
The ruling four-man junta, dominated by Pinochet, decreed a 90-day siege throughout Chile after Sun­day's rocket and machine gun attack. five of Pinochet's bodyguards were killed and I I wounded in the ambush. 
Pinochet, a general and the commander of the army, suf­fered only cuts on his left hand in the ambush on a road

WASHINGTON -The New England states have reaped the higgest rewards from the current economic expansion, while residents of the energy­producing states have lagged far hehind the national average in income gains, the government reported yester­day. 
The Commerce Depart­ment said New Hampshire residents have enjoyed a 30.6 percent income gain since the last recession ended in 1982, the biggest increase of any state. 
Nationwide, Americans' personal income has climbed 
20.9 percent since 1982 to an average of $13,867 for every person in the country last year. Consumer prices during this same period were rising I 1.9 percent. This means that the averaqe American's income, after adjusting for in-nation, increased nine per­cent fr0m 1982 through 1985. 
The six-state New England region, which has been enjoy­ing boom times because of its high technology and defense industries, had the best performance for any region of the country, a 27.3 percent increase, while the Southwest had the poorest showing, a 15.2 percent rise.

American journalist faces espionage charge 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -The newspaper Izvestia yesterday accused Nicholas Daniloff of using a 
journalist's cover to ferret out military secrets about Af­ghanistan and claimed the American reporter worked with an alleged CIA agent in Moscow. 
The government newspa­per said the imprisoned cor­respondent for U.S. News & World Report was charged by a military prosecutor with espionage under a law that imposes penalties ranging from seven years in prison to death. 
The article elaborated on accusations already made against Daniloff and ex­panded the charges against the reporter beyond the scope of the original claim that he received secret docu­ments during what was des­
cribed  as  a  secret  meeting  
with  a  Soviet  in  a  Moscow  
park.  

The arrest of Daniloff and the espionage charges filed Sunday by Soviet authorities have provoked a sharp reac­tion in Washington. Reagan administration officials have said the United States views the case as "a matter of ut­most seriousness" that could affect Soviet-American rela­tions. 
Ruth Daniloff, who was scheduled to to see her hus­band today for the third time since his arrest on Aug. 30, called the Izvestia article "preposterous." 
"It's absolutely crazy," she said. "It's just for domestic consumption while this case is being decided on a much higher level." 
Izvestia tried to link Daniloff to Paul Stombaugh, a U.S. diplomat accused of being a CIA agent and ex­pelled from the Soviet Union in June 1985. 
It cited as evidence a note, allegedly given to a Soviet by Stombaugh, that said: "We would like to assure you that the letter delivered by you to the journalist on Jan. 24 got to the designated address." 
Izvestia claimed Daniloff was thejournalist mentioned in the letter. 
Daniloff has been held in Moscow's Lefortovo prison since he was grabbed by eight KGB agents in a Moscow park. He told his wife he was picked up after a Soviet acquaint­ance named "Misha" gave him a packet purportedly containing press clippings but actually filled with maps 
marked  secret  and  military  
photographs.  
Izvestia said  Daniloff was  

handed the indictment on Sunday at Lefortovo and re­quired to sign it, which the paper said he did reluctantly. 
In a telephone call to his office from prison on Sunday, Daniloff said he could be held six to nine months without a trial. He said he was told he is not yet entitled to a lawyer.

U.S. bar scene distant cousin to English pubs 

A cool mist haunts the streets of a small English town. Bone-chilled and weary, two companions search for a warming respite. The Prince of Wales smiles a welcome from the wooden sign that bears his name. The oak­trimmed wall proclaims outstanding beers, entertainment and fine fayre can be enjoyed within, especially the beers of Samuel Smith brewery es­tablished in 1758. One opens the door excitedly and enters the unpar­alleled world of the English pub.

guest column 
Immediately one is overwhelmed by the intricacy of design and comfort ofatmosphere. The walls are perhaps adorned with prints of English landscapes on discreet wallpaper, or ornate Victorian mirrors, or sturdy Tudor oak bearing antiquated farm­ing implements. The floor is rustic wood with sawdust shavings or per­haps covered with carpeting. A large open fire crackles at the delicately carved hearth. Perhaps a dart board engages able shots in one corner. Most definitely, from behind a large central wooden bar and headboard, bartenders dispense some of the best beer in the world. 
One bellys up to the bar to order a round. He politely attracts the bartender's attention and asks for two pints of bitter. The bartender pulls forward an ivory tap handle that pumps the beer from casks below where it is preserved at a delightfully chilled 55 degrees Farenheit (hence the beer tastes warm since we are used to beer served at 45 degrees.) Into the pint glass a clark, amber fluid of thick consistency pours, forming a slight foam. If one is hungry a va­riety of pub grub is offered from a ploughman's sandwich consisting of bread, cheese,and a sweet onion relish, to steak and kidney pie: all hearty fare. 
One finds a comfortable corner near the fire with a wooden table with velvet-covered chairs. He sits down opposite his friend, presenting his prized purchase. He quaffs a lusty draft of a rich, slightly bitter but smooth ale which one Englishman has proclaimed as, "ambrosia, the sustenance of the gods." 
The friends enjoy each other's com­pany. They converse on the fortunes of the English football club, the Tory government Shakespeare or the miserable weather. They regale each other with witty stories and jokes of understatement. Perhaps they rise, albeit carefully, for a game of darts. In the aura of the hearth, good ale and good friends a warmth slowly en­velops one. After he downs the last dregs of his beer, he realizes a pint is just the right size. Fortified for the wind-ripped rain, he and his friend return to the town streets. 
Such were my impressions of an English pub at its most quaint that is most ideal. Though a certain nos­talgia invariably colors my portrait the model still remains valid. A pub demonstrates that there is more to drinking beer than simply drinking beer. A pub demands fellowship, con­versation and wit as well as a few rounds of bitter. A pub is the meeting place for all descriptions from literary and intellectual circles, to politic groups, sport clubs, financial and law associates and local neighborhoods. 
Many of America's older neighbor­hood bars have some of the relish of the English pub. However, all too many American bars, fail to provide a comfortable drinking atmosphere. Our drinking institutuions unlike the rest of American society, fail to place a premium on comfort. Perhaps a guilt concerning drinking is one of our Puritan heritages. We afterall en­dured a decade of Prohibition and recently are witnessing a conserva­tive reaction to drink. Whatever the offered rt choice of beers from traditonal English ale, to Irish stout. German lager (our cold beer), to ap­pl~ cider to accomodate one's varied tastes. Further every beer is generally brewed locally or at only one brewery to preserve the quality of each beer. Unfortunatley, American bars make only meager gestures toward op­timum taste and selection of beers. 


The English pub offers a comfort­able and aesthtically pleasurable at­mosphere. The typical pub will strive to be decorated in a unique and in­tricate way. One finds great diversity in the. pub from the rugged interior of Tudor oak to the sophisticated Vic­torian bric-a-brac. Great care is taken to provide a homely and comfortable atmosphere. The typical American bar, on the other hand, is a rather austere creature in contrast with its English cousin.

The English pub insures the act of drinking itself is a properly pleasurable experience. All beer is served on draft, and all draft is served in proper glassware, preserving the beer's integrity and taste. One is suprised if offered a bottle. One is 
lowship. It has become the meeting place of the community, where friends gather to talk. To this end the comfortable atmosphere allows one to enjoy fully the company of otheres without the distractions that impinge from without. The typical American bar, however, oftentimes prevents rather than preserves conversation. Many a bar's flashing lights and blaring music (as if noise were a virtue in itself) make talk impossible. Thus such bars serve a different pur­pose than the pub: the become places to drink heavily or pick up

The proper context for drinking is one of fellowship and conversation. 
Anyone who honestly searches his memory realizes it is the stories one tells of one's youth, the ribald jokes, or the cleabates about favorite baseball terams rather than a dr~nken stupor that makes drinking enJoyable. Thus institutrions that at­tempt to provide the the optimum comfort with a minimum of distrac­tions, a friendly, homely environment are closest to the true spirit of drink­ing. One should take pride in them. A pub is such a place. However, though England is famed for her pubs, we need not travel abroad. We must search within our own country for those old neighborhood bars and treasure them for all their worth. For in its proper context, amidst friendly 
conversation, drinking warm beer (or cold if you like) is one of the great pleasures of life.

There is a flame that has been burning for 22 years in the city of Hiroshima, Japan to mark the day nuclear weap­ons were first used against humans on earth. Now part of this flame burns in the Grotto, placed there last week by members of the Great Peach March for Global Nu­clear Disarmament. 
Members of the march, who camped on White Field for two days last week, returned to campus Aug. 28 to present an interpretive dance version of the juvenile book "Sadako and the I 000 Cranes" by Eleanor Coerr. Following the performance, the Great Peace March Ceremonial Players marched to the Grotto where they lit a candle from the flame given to them by the Asian-Pacific­Americans for Nuclear Dis­armament, a group dedicated to survivors of atomic and H­bombs. 
The flame, which was taken directly from the flame bur­ning at Peace Park in Hiros­hima, was presented to the group as a reminder of the predicament the world faces with nuclear arms. The peace marchers have lighted candles from this flame in every city they have stopped in along the way ofthe march, which began March I in Los 
Angeles and ends Nov.  15 in  
Washington, D.C.  
Both  Notre  Dame's  light,  

which will be marked in the Grotto by a blue ribbon and perhaps later by a plaque, as well as the light in Hiroshima, will not be extinguished until nuclear weapons have been eradicated from the face of the earth. "It's a symbol of the fragility of the world," said Chris Bell, a member of the Ceremonial Players. "People can cherish their light until they have a chance to blow it out." 
The Ceremonial Players have been presenting "Sadako's Dance," their ver­sion of Coerr's book about a 

young female Hiroshiman, at 
stops all along the way of the 
march. "I felt the book itself 
couldn't bring home the ter­
rible reality of nuclear weap­
ons," said Marilyn Scott­
Branden, the troupe's 
director. The visual perfor­
mance was choreographed 
by the entire ensemble in 
haiku form so that elements 
of the bomb and its effect on 
the people became starkly 
apparent. 
On Aug. 6, the 41st an­
niversary of the bombing of 
Hiroshima, the Ceremonial 
Players performed "Sadako's 
Dance" in Dixon, Ill., Presi­
dent Reagan's hometown. 
'The flame is a reminder of 
the spirit within us as well as 
a reminder of the spirit of 
world peace," Daiva Edrehi, 
another member of the cast, 
said. She said further that all 
people are in a sense sur­
vivors, or ffibakusha as the 
Japanese say, because of the 
world condition everyone 
shares. "We're all survivors, 
not just the people of Hiros­
hima, but victims of all 
bombs and radiation 
everywhere, people who suf­
fer from cancer and birth 
defects (caused by nuclear 
testing) -whole communities .. 
on dumpsites that have to be 
relocated." 
Two members of the march 
have just recently returned 
from Japan. "We felt it is im­
portant to tell the people of 
Japan that we remember 
them," Edrehi said. Likewise, 
actual Japanese survivors of 
the bomb have accompanied 
the marchers and told their 
stories to different commun­
ities along the route in an ef­
ffort to dramatize the devas­
tating effects of nuclear 
weapons. 
In the meantime, it couldn't hurt to visit the Grotto and say a prayer for world peace. For the ordinary people of the world. so far removed from the stings of power, it often has to be the thought that counts. There may be no other realistic avenues ooen.

St. Mary's tennis opens season at home against Valparaiso U. 
By MARISA KOSLA 
.">port.-; Wrilc·r 
The Saint Mary's tennis team begins its season today at home against Valparaiso at 3 p.m. 
According to second-year coach Deb Laverie, the key to this year's success is the team's experience. 
"This year's squad is expe· rienced and confident enough to win consistently," she said. 
Leading the team arc five 
returnees  senior  Kim  
Drahota,  junior  Kate  
McDevitt. and  sophomores  

Shaur1 Boyd, Sandy Hiekcy and Charlene Szajko. New ad­ditions to the team arc fresh· men Jennifer Block, Linda Cipowski, Buffy Heinz, Erin Flynn, Kelly Seppi and Jane Schnell. 
Although most of the players arc new, Laverie believes the team will flourish. 
"The new players have enough junior tennis cxpcri· cncc to win," she said, noting that most of them have en· gaged in summer tennis pro· grams. 
Two of the team's strengths arc team captain Drahota, the f~cllcs' stabilizing force.· an<l first-year player Block. 
"Kim leads the team prac­tices, and Jennifer is a well· rounded player," said Lawrie. "She will be seeded one or two this year." 
The Belles, who placed second at the state meet last year, hope to achieve a per· feet NAJA season ami to qualify for Nationals. 
"I think it can he <lone," said Laverie. "We have a talented squad."

Shula, players regroup after defeat 

Associated Press 
M lAM I -The last time the Miami Dolphins faced a task like this one, they had seven months to regroup. This time, they have only seven days. 
The defending AFC east champions were humiliated 50-28 Sunday by the San Diego Chargers. The last time Coach Don Shula felt that helpless on the West Coast was Jan. 20, 1985, during Super Bowl XIX, when the San Francisco 49ers whipped the Dolphins 38-16. 
This isn't the way Shula wanted to start his 24th season as head coach in the National Football League. 
"It wasn't a fun day looking at the tape today," Shula said yesterday at his weekly news conference. "But when you play as poorly as we played, you have to take the medicine." 
But Shula said he doesn't 
want to spend much time

watching a tape which shows his defense giving up 500 yards and his offense and special team turning the ball over four times. A couple of quick viewings and those tapes will be trashed. 
"We don't want to dwell on it and beat everything into their heads." he said. "We just want to look at it and learn from our mistakes and then get these things out of our minds and start working for the Colts." 
Next Sunday in the Orange Bowl against Indianapolis. the Dolphins get a chance to show whether the San Diego game was a fluke. The good news for Miami is that In­dianapolis may be just what the Dolphins need -the Colts lost to New England 33-3 Sun­day. 
Shula praised San Diego. saying the Chargers had a well-conceived game plan and executed it to perfection. The motion-filled San Diego offense confused the Miami defense, while the S'an Diego defense was successful in pressuring Miarni quarter­back Dan Marino. 
Marino completed 23 o_f 36 passes for 290 yards and three to4chdowns, but he was sacked four times and fumbled twice when hit while trying to pass. 
"They were very aggressive on their pass rush," Shula said. 'Their whole intent was to break down the pocket and get in Marino's face, and when we fell behind early and had to pass on every down, it just made it worse." 
Shula was particularly un­happy with the performance of his defense. He said the shifting by the Chargers backs was expected, but the Dolphins defense didn't react the way it had been instructed in practice. 
"They only made one move 
we hadn't seen." Shula said. 
"But the moves that we had 
worked on, we didn't make 
the changes." 
The veteran coach said his 
toughest task this week may 
be restoring his team's confi­
dence. 

"It's got to be a real downer 
for everybody," he said. "To 
see it all come apart the way 
it did is disappointing. But the 
most disappointing thing is 
nobody fought back, nobody 
tried to make a play to juice 
things up." 
The negative talk will end 
Tuesday, however. Shula 
knows better than to give up 
on a team after the first week 
of the season. Last year, the 
Dolphins lost their opener 
and were 5-4 after nine 
games, but they won their last 
seven games to win the divi­
sion title. 
"We got to get back to 
square one and work to try to 
~et it back together," he said. 
Receivers 
continuedfrompage 16 
come on very, very well," he said. 
With his strong perfor­mance, Williams assumed the starting tight end position. The 6-4junior played in every game last season, and finished with I I receptions. 
Backing up Williams will be sophomore Andy Heck and senior Dan Tanczos. Tight End Coach George Stewart says the group will be con­cerned mainly with the run­ning game, but will also have a chance to help the aerial at­tack. 
"We have a big and physical 
group and we are going to 
put some people on their 
butts," he says. "Our first 
priority is blocking for the 
running game. 
"We will also have opportu­
nities to catch the ball be­
cause the defense is going to 
have to respect our wideouts. 
That should open up some 
chances for us." 
The quality of the Irish 
receivers gives the offense 
unlimited big-play potential. 
But it remains to he seen if 
the big plays occur in t11c 
numbers expected. If they do, 
the whole Irish team will have 
unlimited potential.

Bear's QB McMahon sidelined for 3 weeks 
Associated Press 
LAKE FOREST, Ill. -Quar­terback Jim McMahon will be lost to the Super Bowl cham­pion Chicago Bears for at least three weeks because of a shoulder injury. 
McMahon, the team's "free spirit," suffered the injury in the fourth quarterofSunday's 4 1-31 victory over the Cleveland Browns in the NFL season opener for both teams. 
"It's a second-degree separation in the right shoulder," trainer Fred Caito said. "He did not dislocate it. 
He  will  miss  about  three  
weeks."  
Caito  said  X-rays  were  

negative and that McMahon had movement of the arm. "At the end of this week he will begin to work with 
weights and in I 0 to 14 days he will do some throwing," Caito said. 'There was no damage to the rotator cuff. It is tender and sore and we will treat it with care." 
Caito said that a first­degree shoulder injury is mild and takes about a week to heal. A second-degree injury has pain and swelling and takes three weeks, and a third-degree injury is a severe separation that can take six weeks. 
Coach Mike Ditka said Mike Tomczak, a second-year pro, will start Sunday against the Philadelphia Eanles. 
"Three weeks is optimis­tic," Ditka of the recovery time for McMahon's injury. "If he can pop it (the ball) in three weeks, he'll be back in there. 
Associated Press 
BALTIMORE -Manager Earl Weaver said last night that he will leave the Baltimore Orioles at the end of the 1986 season. 
Weaver, hired out of retire­ment for a second stint as manager on June 14, 1985, said he informed owner Ed­ward Bennett Williams and General Manager Hank Peters of his intentions about three weeks ago. 
At the time, Weaver said, the only response from Wil­liams was that they sit down 

Baseball Roundup 

after the season and talk about the decision. 
Weaver parried questions about his future before last night's game against Boston, saying no announcement would be made until he met with Williams. 
But after being told after the game that Williams had revealed his decision on Larry King's national radio talk show last F'riday night, Weaver confirmed the report. 
Asked if Williams could change his mind, Weaver said: "I don't think so." 
Weaver said he would not accept a job with any other team, adding: "I can't regardless. I'm signed through 1990 for $1 a year (as a consultant)." 

"The best thing is, I don't have to answer any more questions," Weaver said. "It's all over ... that's a relief." 
Williams, a celebrated Washington, D.C. attorney, was reported in F'lorida on a case, and unavailable for comment and Weaver said he did not talk with his boss yesterday. 


Expos stop Mets winning streak 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Rookie Bob Sebra pitched a five-hitter and Mitch Webster's two-run homer highlighted a 16-hit attack last night, leading the Montreal Expos over the New York Mets 9-1. 
The loss ended the Mets' four-game winning streak. 
Sebra, 4-3, lost his shutout bid with two outs in the ninth on Darryl Strawberry's 20th home run of the season. Sebra struck out seven and walked one in his second complete game. 
Bob Ojeda, 16-5, was the loser, breaking his four-game winning streak. He allowed six runs on I 0 hits in 6 2-3 innings. 
Red Sox 9, Orioles .3 

BALTIMORE -Bill Buckner doubled home the tiebreak­ing run in the I I th inning last night, triggering a six-run ex­plosion against Baltimore relief ace Don Aase and the Boston Red Sox beat the Orioles 9-3 for their ninth straight victory. 
The Red Sox increased their 
lead in the American League 
East to seven games over idle 

second-place Toronto. Bos­
ton's lead is its largest since 
the All-Star break. 

After Baltimore scored twice in the ninth inning for a 3-3 tie, Wade Boggs led off the 1 1 th with his fourth hit of the game, a single against Aase. Boggs took second on a passed ball, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Buckner's double. 
Dwight Evans, who hit a two-run homer earlier, added a two-run double and Ged­man capped the outburst with a three-run homer, his 13th of the season. 
Tom Seaver took a four­hitter and 3-1 lead into the ninth, but left after leadoff singles by Larry Sheets and Jim Traber. Calvin Schiraldi, 3-1, walked John Stefero and gave up a two-run single to Juan Beniquez that tied the score. 
Cubs 7, Phillies 4 

CHICAGO -Leon Durham hit a three-run homer and Keith Moreland drove in two runs with a sacrifice fly and a single yesterday to lift the Chicago Cubs to a 7-4 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. 
Chicago starter Ed Lynch, 5-4, allowed eight hits in 5 1-3 innings before being relieved by Scott Sanderson, who allowed one hit in 2 2-3 innings in his second relief appearance of the year. Lee Smith pitched the final inning for his 26th save of the year.

Cowboys down Giants on Walker's TD burst 
Associated Press 
IRVING, Texas -NFL new­comer Herscllel Walker, sub­bing for tile injured Tony Dor­sett. scored two touclldowns, including a I0-yard burst up tile middle with I: 16 to play last nigllt. to carry the Dallas Cowboys to a 3 I -28 victory over the New York Giants. 
Walker, one of the brightest USFI. stars who last month signed a five-year, $5 million contract with the Cowboys, capped a 72-yard drive with his run up the middle. He was pressed into duty because Dorsett, who sprained his left ankle in the first period, was held out of the second half. 
Dallas was aligned in a shotgun formation, and Walker's run seemed to catch the New York defense by surprise. 
Danny White faded as if to pass, but slipped the ball to Walker. Walker, who was sup­posed to be used only sparingly, ran almost un­touclled into the end zone. 
It took Dallas only six plays to take t11e lead after New York had built a 28-24 lead on Bobby Johnson's second touchdown reception of the game. 
After tigl1t end Mark Bavaro caught a 30-yard pass from Phil Simms, Johnson tipped an underthrown pass, then outjumped defender Ron Fel­lows and ran 44 yards for the touchdown with 5:24 to play. 
The Cowboys, who led 14-0 
in the first half. took a 24-21 
lead when tight end Thornton 
Chandler caught a one-yard 
scoring pass from White mid­
way through the fourth per­
iod. The scoring play was set 
up by Walker's I0-yard run on 
a reverse to the New York 3. 
Walker, who earlier scored on a one-yard run, also fumbled in the third quarter to start the Giants toward a go-ahead touchdown.

Over October break, the team will head east to Boston for four matches against several strong teams. 
After finishing the 1985 campaign with a 12-8-2 mark and a third-place finish in the Midwest Regionals, Linden­feld is eager to lead her squad into a schedule of schools from different divisions.

Irish women's tennis competitive in Midwest Fall Invitational action 
By SHEILA HOROX 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's tennis team competed in the Midwest Fall Invitational this past weekend in Bloomington, Indiana. The Irish turned in an impressive performance among the eight teams represented, sending four players to the consolation finals and one doubles team to the finals in their respective draws. 
The tournament. l10wever, was plagued with weather problems, forcing the cancel­lation of most of Sunday's ac­tion. But the rain did not dampen the optimism of second-year Head Coach Mic­hele Gelfman. 
The purpose of the tourna­ment was not directed at team standings, but rather the emphasis was on allowing the players to get as much match play as possible. No team results were kept, but after the first two days ofcom­petition Notre Dame had ac­cumulated enough points to place third, which explains Gelfman's praise of her team's play. 
Co-captains Tammy Schmidt and Michelle Dasso lead a young Irish squad into their second season at the Division I level, and on their quest for a fourth consecutive North Star Conference title. 
Dasso and freshman Step­hanie Tolstedt overcame opening-match defeats to ad­vance to one of Sunday's consolation finals. Both players were placed in the number-one draw bracket. which eventually resulted in their meeting each other in the consolation final. 
Dasso slipped past Sandra Goern of Illinois, 7-6, 4-6, 6­
1. Having won the opening set in a tie-breaker, Dasso found herself down a break in the second set. which she eventially lost. In the final set Dasso altered her strategy, charging the net which un­raveled her opponent. 
Tolstedt also played in a pivital match. She emerged victorious over Ellen Moeller­ing of Southern Illinois University-Carbondale, 2-6, 6-2, 7-5. Tolstedt showed great composure despite losing the first set and being down 1-2 in the second set. 
In the consolation final Dasso defeated teammate Tolstedt, 6-I, 6-3. 
Tammy Schmidt finished with a 2-1 record in the num­ber two draw. The Irish co­captain bested Sari Dinerman of Northern Illinois, 7-5, 6-1, and Jennifer Allen of Purdue, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4. Her only loss was a sea-saw battle with Meg Boyle of Miami (Ohio). 
Alice Lohrer, another im­pressive freshman, finished with a 2-I singles record and advanced to the consolation final in the second draw, which was rained out. Lohrer crushed Miami's Jan Filus, 6­2, 6-0 and Purdue's Kris Dick­en, 1-6, 6-4, 6-2. 
Sophomore Natlie Illig, who played in her first singles matches for Notre Dame, reached the the consolation final in her respective draw with a 2-I record.

What is Schembechler scared of? 
Notre Dame vs. Michigan. 
This Saturday's opening football game is a long-awaited one indeed. Aside from being Notre Dame's first contest of the 1986 season and the debut of Head Coach Lou Holtz, the game pits the Irish against the nation's third­ranked team. 
Now I'm not going to predict a Notre Dame victory, and I'm certainly not going to say the Irish are too overmatched to pull out a win either. Plenty of optimism exists on this campus for an opening-day victory over the powerful visitors from the Big I 0. 
Let's take a look at the attitudes on the Ann Arbor, Mich., campus for a moment. Michigan students have every right to stroll into Notre Dame Stadium in a few days with their heads high. Their football team is one of the preseason favorites to take the national cham­pionship, while Notre Dame did not make the Associated Press preseason poll for the first time since 1964. 
They would have to be fools to think they aren't going to win. 
One man in Ann Arbor, however, already has announced that he thinks Notre Dame is the favored team. That's all fine and dandy, right? F.vervone has a right to his opinion, doesn't he? 
Tile man's name is Bo Schembechler, and he happens to be Michigan's head coach. 
"The Notre Dame team is a talented ballclub," Schembechler said at a recent luncheon in Ann Arbor. "I tried to recruit most of those players. They'll be a good team. 
"Lou tHoltzl knows our football. He knows our players. He's played them for two years. There's no doubt that from a scouting stand­point. the advantage is to Notre Dame." 

Schembechler went on to say that the addi­tion of former Pittsburgh head coach Foge Fazio as Irish defensive coordinator gives Notre Dame the potential for two defensive systems -Min­nesota's (where Holtz used to coach) and Pit-

tsburgh's. Thus, the Michigan skipper favors the Irish. 
Gee, I wonder if he really means that. 
Seriously now, how can a coach in Schem­bechler's position say such a thing with a straight face. It's not-that the Irish don't have a chance to win -they do. But one look at the 1986 Wolverines should have Schemhechler licking his chops for the season to start not flapping them in an effort to give his team some kind of underdog status or psychological edge. 
Take a look, coach. 
Michigan finished the 1985 season with a I O­I-l record, downing Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl by a 27-23 score and earning the No.2 ranking in the final national polls. The Wolverines were also one of the younger teams in the country last year, and 18 starters from that strong squad are back this season. 
Yep, sounds like an underdog to me. 
Senior quarterback Jim Harbaugh finished last season with the highest passing efficiency in Division I football, completing 145 of 227 
r. 639), for I,976 yards and 18 touchdowns. In addition, Harbaunh was the highest-rated signal-caller in !he country with I63.7 points. 
Notre Dame will send senior Steve lkuerlcin on the field, a quarterback who struggled last season after suffering a shoulder injury in his sophomore year. 
In the running department the Wolverines have junior Jamie Morris in the backfield once again. A proven college tailback, Morris has picked up I, 603 yards in his first two seasons. Every player who carried the ball last year for Michigan is back, and a veteran offensive line which avarages 284 pounds per player will lead the way. 
For the Irish, sophomore speedster Mark Green will likely make his first career start at tailback, behind a line whose only returning starter is fifth-year senior Shawn t1cffern at right guard. 
What was Schembechler thinkinn when he 
made those statements'? 
Perhaps he's afraid of Holtz' No. 20 position 
on the list of winningest active Division 1-A 
coaches. After all, Schembechler is only fourth. 
t1e mentioned the fact that Holtz has played 
Michigan twice before while at Minnesota. The 
Wolverines won both times. 
Sun;. Notre Dame can win. I think they've got 
a good chance of coming out on top. But it 
would be an upset. 
I didn't hear too many Chicago Bears' coaches 
saying the New England Patriots were favored 
in the Super Bowl this past January. 
For the head coach of Michigan to say his 
team is the underdog in this one, that's just 
BO-crap.
