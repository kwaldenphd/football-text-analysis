Panel discusses race relations, barriers at ND 

By ROSSANDRA D'ALESSANDRO 
News Writer 
According to some, race rela­tions and Multicultural issues have never been topics of criti­cal importance to the predomi­nately white undergraduate population at Notre Dame. But the small forum gathered in the Grace Hall Pit yesterday evening revealed students of all backgrounds who share a deep concern for improving minority life on campus. 
Out of an undergraduate stu­dent body of approximately 8,000, there are 500 Hispanics, 350 Asian-Americans, 225-250 Afri~tan Americans, and 40 Na­tive Americans. Many feel that this lack of representation of non-majority students has led to a general apathy towards racial issues at Notre Dame. 
Organized by Grace Hall's dorm commissioner, Bret Doo­ley, the panel was composed of four students of different racial backgrounds. The panelists were sophomores Michelle Wong of Lewis Hall, Duwan Si­mon and Todd Leahy of Grace Hall, and junior Manuel Zamar­ripa of Grace Hall. During the hour-long discussion, the pan­elists offered their personal opinions on four questions am very aware of my skin color in class. I'm super-sensitive ­not paranoid, but very aware ­of the way I may appear to my peers in classroom situations," he said. 
"As a chemical engineering major, I always feel like people don't think I should be in the classes I am," Simon ex­plained. "I don't know if it's because I'm the only black per­son in my chemical-engineering classes, but I'm always being asked, 'Why are you here in this class?,' or 'Why did you choose this major?' I'm intimi­dated to talk to my professors sometimes because I don't know if they want to help me or want me to get out of their class," he said. 
Both Simon and Zamarippa suggested that traditional social functions of the University, such as SYR's, are often seen as non­inclusive to minorities. 
"I don't feel like there is any social function at Notre Dame for me. I'm a dance-type, party-type person, but here I often spend my time on week­ends with only one or two friends," explained Simon. 
The final issues addressed by the panel were the programs that presently exist to help break down racial barriers on campus, as well as new options for the future. 
"I think it's great that there are so many functions, such as those sponsored by HAO (Hispanic American Organiza­tion), ISO (International Student Organization), AAA (Asian-

asked by moderator Maria Fuentes, assistant director of Multicultural Student Affairs. 
"Racial issues have had a huge impact on my life at Notre Dame," said Wong, the only female Asian-American panelist present at yesterday's forum. "Before coming here, I had never been asked specifically by people I'd just met, 'What coun­try are you from?"' 

All agreed that minority dis­crimination exists in Notre Dame's academic community. 
"As a Mexican-American, I am definitely not in the major­ity here," Zamarippa said. "I

Notre Dame has ethical standards, too 
I'm upset. I get up everv-------­day, go to class, and study late into the night, all because I want to be able to claim that I graduated from Notre Dame. I'm involved in activities out­side of the classroom and I work hard at them. I'm proud to say that I go to Notre Dame and I'm look­John Bingham ing forward to the day 
Photographerwhen I can be a proud alumnus. 

Even as a little kid, my perception of Notre Dame was that it was a school with class. They were able to consistent­ly field superior athletic teams and they did so with a minimum number of problems within their athletic program. I thought that all Notre Dame students were like the athletes that I faithfully watched play every Saturday after­noon. 
They were good students who loved to com­pete and represent Notre Dame. The con­tributed to the university both on and off the athletic fields. 
I'm sure that there is a large group within our student body that would jump at the chance to represent Notre Dame to the outside world. They've worked hard in class, gotten involved in other activities at school, and generally kept out of trouble. Most of the students here however, don't have the chance to get out of the South Bend area and project to the public ·an image o a Notre Dame student. This burden falls on the shoulders of our athletes. 
Whether they like it or not, they represent all of us to the rest of the world and we as a stu­dent body must hold them to the standards that we wish them to project. 
Athletes at Notre Dame must be willing to accept that burden or they should choose to attend a school where they do not place such a premium on the moral character of their ath­letes. 
Unfortunately, when a situation like the one that has unfolded this past week arises, it runs the risk of damaging the integrity of our com­munity. 
Our image as a university is something that we must all work to uphold. I want to applaud Coach Holtz for taking immediate action and showing in no uncertain terms that this behav­ior will not be tolerated. 
Playing football for Notre Dame is a privilege and not a right. Simply being a gifted athlete is not enough. We maintain high academic stan­dards and also expect a high level of moral character from all members of our community. Regardless of a win-loss record, what have we as a community gained if the people who repre­sent do not uphold the ideals and standards o our community? 
Just as I could not play on the team because I could not keep up with the physical demands, other members of our community can not play because they can not keep up with the ethical demands placed on them. 
It probably seems like I'm pronouncing them guilty before they've even had a trial, but they must bear the burden of keeping their reputa­tions intact. 
Coach Holtz doesn't have time to run around covering up for the mistakes of his players and we as a student body work too hard to have our image tainted by an event like this.

Rebels advance on Rwandan capital, army low on supplies 

-KIGALI, Rwanda 

Machine-gun and artillery fire rocked this Central African capital today as rebels and government troops fought pitched battles. After a week of fighting, the army was reported running low on ammunition. 
More than 100,000 desperate refugees carrying their belongings on their backs streamed out of the city ahead of the ethnic warfare. 
Foreigners already have nearly completed their exodus from this small Central African country. 
In one of the most dramatic evacuation maneuvers, a heavily armed column of Belgian troops rescued 18 foreigners this morning from the Ndere psychiatric hospi­tal north of the airport. 
As the convoy arrived, 500 Tutsi refugees camped in one of the compound's buildings rushed out with their hands up, pleading for help. 
But they were left behind, along with 200 mentally ill Rwandans living in the hospital. 
The Belgians only had room for 18 for­eigners -five brothers and two nuns of the Belgian Charite order, along with a mental­ly disturbed Italian woman, two other Belgians and their families. 
The hospital and adjacent convent had been besieged since Tuesday night by Hutu gangs armed with clubs, 
Model, rocker to split after nine years 
NEW YORK 
Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley are separating after nine years of marriage, CNN reported Wednesday. The super­model and her singer-songwriter hus­band sent a joint statement to Mitchell Fink, a People magazine columnist who contributes to CNN's "Show Biz Today" segment. Further details were not immediately availability. Calls from The 

Associated Press to their representatives late Wednesday were not returned. The couple has an 8-year-old daugh­ter, Alexa Ray. Brinkley, 40, survived a serious heli­copter crash earlier this month, while "heliskiing" with friends near Telluride, Colo. Joel, 44, postponed a con­cert in Kansas City the next night to accompany his wife back to their Long Island oceanfront estate, outside New York City.People magazine featured Brinkley on the cover of their April 18 edition. She said the April 1 accident gave her a deeper appreciation of her family. "Maybe I'll have the patience to be a better mom," she told the mag­azine. "Maybe I will simplify my life. because at the moment everything is so sweet to me." 
Reputed mobster gunned down 
MOSCOW 
Gunmen burst into the apartment of a reputed crime boss and killed the man and his wife in bed, the latest murders in a mob war that has broken out in the Russian capital. Criminal gangs have flourished in the chaos that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and gunbattles, car bombings and assassinations have become nearly routine as "mafiya" groups carve up their turf. Mobsters have elbowed their way into Russia's emerging business world, killing dozens of businessmen last year and extorting millions of dollars through protec­tion rackets. With the stakes rising, organized crime groups increasingly are targeting each other. Avtandil Chicklaidze, a 38-year-old ethnic Georgian, was killed at 7 a.m. Tuesday along with his wife by gunmen who fired automatic weapons, the ITAR-Tass news agency report­ed. Their child was shot in the arm but survived. 
machetes and rifles. 
"It's hell," said Jef Debere, 67, one of the Charite brothers. "I came to Rwanda after retiring because I thought I could be useful. With the whites gone, the people at the hospital have no more protection. Most of them will be killed." 
With as many as 20,000 mainly Tutsi troops of the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front pouring in from the north to rein­force small groups already in the city, members of the provisional government in Rwanda left for the countryside. 
Army troops, mostly Uutus, and rebel soldiers engaged in mortar duels in the center of Kigali this afternoon and fired at each other over the international air­port. 
The army appeared to be low on ammunition, said Capt. Eric Millet, a French officer. 
Belgian troops rushed to get the few remaining expatriates aboard C-130s headed for Nairobi, a 1 1/2-hour flight. 
Earlier in the day, rebels and army troops fought street-to-street in the cen­ter of the city. A government helicopter 
gunship fired rockets at rebel positions. At least one shell 
hit the parliament building, sending up a plume of 
smoke; others landed nearby, kicking up giant clouds of 
red dust. 

Three in Belfast charged with murder 
BELFAST 

Three men were charged Wednesday with murdering a Protestant woman who may have been mistaken for a Roman Catholic at a rowdy drinking club. Two other men and a woman were charged with aiding and abet­ting the murder of 31-year-old Margaret Wright on April 
6. The charges came a day after an outlawed Protestant paramilitary group said it had killed one of its own mem­bers who admitted shooting Wright. Charged with mur­der were Christopher Sheals, 27, David Jess, 20, and Stephen Rules, 28. Rules also was charged with posses­sion of a sawed-off shotgun and Jess was charged with belonging to the outlawed Red Hand Commandos, a Protestant group. Rules told Belfast Crown Court, "I didn't kill that poor girl. I only guarded the door because I was told to. I am sorry for the family and everything that has happened. "Charged with abetting the killing were Stephen Salters, 21, Warren Neil Gibson, 21, and Allison Elliott, 24, all from Belfast. The Ulster Volunteer Force said Tuesday it killed Ian Hamilton, 21, whose body was found in a Protestant area. In a statement, the group said Hamilton shot Wright after a crowd of people beat her up. 
'Booze News' details hijinks of officers 
TOKYO 

Peppered with boasts of drinking binges, skirt chasing and irreverent jibes at the powers that be, the Drink Booze News looks like something a bunch of rebellious high school kids might have cooked up. But it isn't. It's the quarterly newsletter of an aviators' social club that claims a worldwide membership of officers in the U.S. Air Force -from fighter pilots to brigadier generals. The club is called the Command Barstool Association and, according to a Booze News copy obtained by The Associated Press, has chapters in nearly two dozen Air Force Bases in the United States a,nd at least six more overseas. The Command Barstool Association is believed to have been formed by some Air Force pilots at a bar in Japan shortly after the end of the Korean War as a means of keeping in touch. The membership is estimated at about 1,000 at most.

Lecture examines women's movement BoiDbing 
By LESLIE FIELD claimed that, in politics, women threatening. However, women 1992. People think women News Writer tend to have roles within the want women to appear in con­make better legislators because suspect 
The women's movement should be viewed in a different light, according to Sue Tolleson-Rinehart, professor of political science at Texas Tech University. 
She cited recent characteriza­tions of feminists, including Rush Limbaugh's attacks on "feminazis" and Oliver North's criticism of feminists during his campaign for Senator of Vir­ginia as examples of media stereotyping of feminists. 
In her lecture Wednesday af­ternoon, Tolleson-Rinehart fo­cused on America's preoccupa­tion with gender roles. She private sector while men oc­cupy a huge section of the pub­lic sector. 
Tolleson-Rinehart attributes this phenomenon to the nurtur­ing role women are expected to play in society. She claims that women are expected to be caregivers, not lawmakers. 
Tolleson-Rinehart referred to Texas Governor Ann Richards as a "symbolic woman." To be a successful female politician, women must display different sides of themselves to different people, she said. She claimed that, unlike the male politician, women cannot be too com­manding because men find this trol and take charge. Tolleson­Rinehart claimed that this makes it very difficult for women to win votes across the board. 

"Men expect all women to think alike," she said, "but do we exp.ect all men to think alike? No." 
Tolleson-Rinehart claims that it is the stereotype of the nur­turing, listening, caring women that explains why we see many more men in chief political po­sitions like governor, mayor and president. 
"Diane Fienstein lost her race for governor in 1990, but won her California Senatorial seat in it is a nurturing, cooperative, supporting position which re­quires good listening skills. It's the fashion to think women are good legislators," she said. 
She claimed that another fac­tor that contributes to the diffi­cult task of women running for high office is the image of what a president, governor or mayor should look like. Tolleson­Rinehart referred to President Clinton, saying that he couldn't put forth the emotion that he does if he, "..didn't have all that muscle."

Japan's fractious ruling coali­tion, which nearly fell apart af­ter the prime minister an­nounced he was quitting, neared agreement today on a candidate to replace him: For­eign Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
Parliament was expected to vote early next week on a suc­cessor for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who threw Japanese politics into confusion last week by saying he would resign to take responsibility for an emerging financial scandal. 

If the left-leaning and conser­vative factions in Hosokawa's coalition can stay together and preserve their majority, Hat a probably will win the vote. 
Although he belongs to the coalition's more conservative faction and was once a member of the opposition Liberal Demo­cratic Party, Hata has champi­oned the promised reforms that formed the coalition's main ap­peal to scandal-weary voters. 
Hata, 58, heads the Japan Renewal Party, and has been elected to the powerful lower house of Parliament nine times. He serves simultaneously as deputy prime minister.

Another popular tactic for nonviolence involves literally jumping in front of large whal­ing ships or holding on to the bow of a navy ship stocked with nuclear weapons. 
"Our motto is 'Be in the way,"' said Childs. 
One particular member of Greenpeace went as far as boarding a Japanese whaling ship and handcuffing herself to the harpoon gun in order to "be in the way." 
Childs said that Japan and Sweden are the only two coun­much we got ourselves some," Childs said.

USA Today international edi­tor John Simpson recalled Clinton's recent acknowledge­ment that he had overstated his Whitewater losses by $20,000. Simpson said his daughter com­mented that Clinton "sounds just like me when I'm trying to explain why I don't have my homework." 
Launching his defense, Clin­ton suggested that press cover­age of Whitewater was con­fused and that the media were hostile. He quoted humorist Garrison Keillor as saying, "All I know about Whitewater is what I read in the papers, so I don't understand it." 
More pointedly, Clinton told news media's coverage of his administration and of the Whitewater affair, but he de­clined to do so. 
"If I could grade the press, I wouldn't," he said. 
In reply to another question, Clinton said he was considering what limits there should be on the use of American tax dollars for abortion overseas. 
"I think at a minimum that we should not fund abortions when the child is capable of liv­ing outside the mother's womb," Clinton said. "Secondly, we should not in any way, shape or form fund abor­tions if they are forced on citi­zens by the government against their will."

ROB ADAMS MUSIC REVIEW 

Clashing Sounds 
Brand New Heavies drop a trunk of funk 
Sugartooth proves to be sweet and sinister 
By ROB ADAMS 
Music Criric 
''The group really wouldn't 
have gotten anywhere if my 

parents hadn't allowed us to play in my bedroom on Sundays," says Jan Kincaid who plays drums and key­boards for the London live funk band, Brand New Heavies (BNH). 
"At the age of 15, we were very pas­sionate about dance and soul music," agrees Andrew Levy who pumps the bass. 
Formed in 1985, the trio (Simon Bartholomew on guitar) played clubs and parties and eventually released their first single, "Got to Give" in 1987, featuring vocalist Linda Muriel. 
In the meantime, current BNH vocalist N'Dea Davenport had moved out of her hometown of Atlanta and gone to Los Angeles where she was singing on demos for the likes of Madonna, Tone Loc, George Clinton, and Roger Waters. 
The chocolate of the Brand New Heavies crashed into Davenport's peanut butter through Delicious Vinyl, who signed the Heavies in 1990. 
The group released their self-titled

their no-nonsense approach to making 
music.

debut in 1991 and it spawned two major hits, "Dream Come True;, with its bass­filled rhythm and saucy horn section and "Never Stop" which featured Davenport at her most passionate mid­tempo groove. 
After the success of their debut, the Brand New Heavies instrumental section moved on to create "Heavy Rhyme Experience," which featured their live band flavor along with some up and coming rappers laying some rhymes over the grooves. 
Meanwhile, Davenport was helping Guru write his hip-hop/jazz fusion album, "Jazzmatazz" and throwing down some vocals on it as well. 
After honing their skills on the "hia­tus," the group met back in London to begin work on their newest release, "Brother Sister." It was recorded in the Rak, a studio where T-Rex, Hot Chocolate, and Suzy Quatro all cut some records, and was self-produced. 
"Mind Trips" features a laid-back string arrangement with Davenport's vocals picking up the tempo amidst key­boards which shine in the background. "I find that a lot of keyboardists play around the groove instead of playing in the groove; I felt we needed parts that were in the bass, drums, and guitar," says Kincaid. 
The album opens with "Have a Good Time," an undeniably fresh message of positivity. 
Although not a strong lyrical state­ment by any means, it is a perfect way to introduce what will be going on in the tracks to come as Levy's bass hangs low and Bartholomew plays his guitar with quick, tight licks. 
The vibrant music of the Brand New Heavies epitomize what rhythm and blues should be: raw grooves coming out of live guitars, drums, bass, and Davenport's vocals, seemingly impro­vised, reach heights of soul entirely her own. 
E
xcited wah-wah rips open the door to "Spend Some Time," a disco-driven jam with a cymbals-dominated drum beat. Soft string arrangements, light bongo taps, and splashes of piano intensify the groovy mood. 
Davenport is brilliant, beginning her song with flattering comments about the wonderful beginning of a particular relationship, but going on to suggest 
Sugartooth is a band masterful at performing wondrous contradictions throughout their music. Hunter's lyrics will be low and spoken slowly while a raging batch of sounds will be spinning behind him. On other songs, Hunter digs deep to produce sinister, hypnotic vocals and the band behind him plays sovereignly, jamming softly, but with the intensity to support Hunter. 
"Sold My Fortune" begins the album with an incessant hum coming off the guitars which eventually erupts into a massive explosion of feedback bringing the song to a level of frenzy. 
The vocals are, as a result, outshined (pun intended) by the sound, creating a really interesting effect. Meanwhile, the drums drive the song slowly. "'Sold My Fortune' was written after a long talk with a friend. My fortune is a metaphor for his problems," says Hunter. 
Lonely guitar riffs coupled with vocals that seem like they are echoes from soli­tary confinement suddenly give way to a trap door which leads to the dungeon from which the sounds are rising on "Tuesday Morning." 
The richness of the production on the guitars creates a swirling whirlpool fueled by the sporadic yet successful placements of background vocals. "Tuesday Morning" is the strongest track on Sugartooth. 
"Silently I've been screaming/And no one else can understand/That I feel nothing/And I don't care at all," moans Hunter on the track "Third-Day-To­Forever," which truly displays 
•.:.•.•.•t•,•,• •.: 

that it's over now. "What to do with this love/Now it seems like the best thing baby/Is just give it up," she wails confi­dently. 
"Dream on Dreamer" is the first single to be released from Brother Sister, and rightly so. Sidewinding drums break loose into a fantastic representation of Davenport's soul, while piano notes pro­vide a tight mesh in between her vocal breaks. "The song was inspired by a friend of mine," says Davenport, "a young man with a lot of responsibilities. He uses daydreams to free himself from all the things that are holding him down." 
Although making music that may sug­gest the Brand New Heavies are jam­ming in the wrong decade, they have created a style of fun-loving, loose dance music that is all based on live soul and all their own. 
Brother Sister picks up a groove from the first song and never lets it fall off until the last. 

Sugartooth's range. Despite the intense 
lyrics and Hunter's menacing vocal 
style, an acoustic guitar and bongo 
drums lead into soft bass plucks. 
"Despite the music, we're not 
bummed out about life," says Gruse. "In 
fact, it's probably the contrary. We get 
our anger and frustration out in the 
music. We see other bands that take 
themselves so seriously-they look like a 
joke. We're pretty much average guys. 
We're not special because we play 
music, it's just a coincidence." 
"Cracks in the Pavement" features a 
bass warm-up at the beginning from 
which explodes a furious burst of energy 
and yet Hunter's vocals remain relative­
ly calm. After the first verse, a sudden 
attempt to create a melodious chorus 
peaks and, actually, is the best part of 
the song; Hunter's vocals reach heights 
he doesn't feature too often. In the 
background, meanwhile, riffs collide 
and merge like constructive interference 
of a transverse wave. 
Through their demented, apocalyptic lyrics and virtual tornadoes of sound the Sugartooth debut is not one to be ~missed ... especially for those of us who 
like to go on musical binges.

Aaron honored on 20th anniversary of record 
By TOM SAlADINO 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA 

Today's multimillion-dollar salaries likely will prevent any of the current crop of players from breaking his career home run record, Hank Aaron says. 
Aaron was saluted in pre­game ceremonies Wednesday night prior to the San Francisco Giants-Atlanta Braves game honoring the 20th anniversary of Aaron's 715th home run. The accolades included a letter from President Clinton. 
Aaron's homer that broke Babe Ruth's record came on April 8, 1974 at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium in the fourth inning against left-bander AI Downing of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Aaron wound up with 755 in his 23-year career. That record will be hard to break, he said during a news conference prior to the on-field cere­monies. 
"I think the players of today ­and I've said this so many times before -have more athletic ability than those of 20 years ago," said Aaron. 

"But the way salaries are now, many are super rich if they play 10 years. The first 13 years of my career I didn't make $100,000 (a season). I was still hungry. 
"I really don't know how I'd do if I were playing today. The minute my season was over in 1957-58, I'd go to work. I need­ed that other paycheck." 
He said the outstanding play­ers of today "can do most any­thing, but I can't predict what they'll do." 
The week of April 8-15 was designated by Major League Baseball as Hank Aaron Week. Each club playing at home paid tribute to Aaron on April 8. 
The Braves opened the season on the road and didn't return to Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium until Tuesday night. 
"Hank Aaron distinguished himself as one of the best play­ers baseball has ever known," said Clinton's letter in part. 
"I am delighted to commem­orate this event. ... Best Wishes for a wonderful celebration, Bill Clinton," the letter concluded. 
Major League Baseball pre­sented Aaron with a Tiffany statue of himself and a life­sized baseball card. The Braves contributed a $10,000 check to the Hank Aaron Rookie League, an Atlanta baseball league for youngsters.

Teams are ranked into two brackets, 1-8 and 9-16. The Belles are in the latter bracket and face the possibility of play­ing Albion College and Hope College. 
Saint Mary's suffered it sec­ond loss of the season to Hope last weekend and faces Albion later in its competitive sched­ule. Both the teams should pose a challenge for the team, Cromer noted. 
"We aren't going to let our loss against Hope affect us, should we play them this week­end," she said. "It's also im­portant for us to keep in mind that some of our toughest matches of the season are corn­ing up after this weekend, so we can't let up." 
Other teams ranked in the same bracket with Saint Mary's are DePauw University, St. Benedict's College, and the Universities of Wisconsin at Eau Claire, Whitewater, and LaCrosse. 
The Belles are scheduled to play their first match on Friday at 10:45 a.m. 
If they win this match, they will play again later on Friday and once more on Saturday. The team's opponents are selected by a two-draw format and the tournament is double elimination. 
Nevertheless, the Belles have their work cut out for them. Technically, the top two teams at the invitational's end receive national bids. 
However, the chance for an at-large bid is still alive if the Belles make a strong enough showing within their own bracket. 
"It is extremely important that we represent Saint Mary's the best that we can, through both our playing and sports­manship," Cromer said. "We receive great exposure at this invitational because there are so many coaches and commit­tees there. Everybody sees you." 
The players themselves have a good feeling about this week­end as well. Junior Nancy Waibel commented that the Belles' entire line-up is solid, from No. 1 singles through No. 3 doubles. 
"This weekend is what we've worked for since the beginning of this season," Waibel said. "We are all ready to win." 
The Belles earned their invi­tation to Madison as a result of all their hard work and deter­mination. Everything they've focused their energies on this season will be called upon this weekend when they have the opportunity to show everyone what they're made of, accord­ing to senior co-captain Mary Cosgrove. 

"I am hoping that this week­end's matches will give our team the opportunity to prove the real talent that exists among our players," Cosgrove ­said. "We have the skills to win, yet our ability to remain focused on our goals will be the key to our success."

The Saint Mary's tennis team begins its quest for a bid to the nationals today when it departs for the Midwest Invitational in Madison, Wisconsin. 
The Belles have been antici­pating this weekend since the beginning of their season as this will be their only chance for a bid. In coach Katie Cromer's eyes, the team is ready for the challenge. 
"We have been working on mentally focusing during prac­tices," Cromer said. "This is our only shot for nationals. We need to just go out there and do 
it... The top sixteen teams from the Midwest Region are invited to this invitational.

Speedy Sollmann stealing spotlight 
Freshman steps up to challenges 
By JENNY MARTEN Senior Sports Writer 
As a high school senior, he was named the top running back in Ohio after rushing for 

.. 2,000 all-purpose yards and leading his team to the Division I state championship game. 
And in the fall of 1993, Scott Sollmann came to Notre Dame, but he didn't come to play football. 
He came to play baseball for Pat Murphy. Why baseball? Why Notre Dame? 
"I guess baseball has always been my number one love. I have always been very successful at football, but it was time to choose one sport," explained the fresh­men centerfielder. 

"Eventually, I decided that the high school championship ..,.... 
game was going to be my last. Notre Dame showed the most interest in baseball." 
Sollmann's baseball talent is as considerable as his grid­iron talent. The three-time Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) All-American has become a major contributor to the Irish baseball team with his speed 


In his first week of college baseball, he drew five walks in 21 plate appearances while singling in his first collegiate game and tripling in the fifth game of the break. He also was successful on three-of­four stolen base attempts. 
Since then, Sollmann has settled into the number two spot in the lineup and flour­ished there. His current num­bers arc testimony to that. In addition to walking 12 times, he's hitting .361 with 15 runs scored and six runs batted in . A 10-for-13 performance in the four-game series with Xavier boosted his average 112 points. 
Although his claim on the two-spot seems secure, Soli­mann doesn't really care where he is in the order. 
"It's easier batting seventh or eighth rather than first or second. It's the mentality peo­ple have. The seventh and eighth batters aren't sup­posed to get the hits while the first batters are supposed to be the better hitters," said Sollmann. "My game plan stays the same so matter where I hit. I'm not an RBI producer. I want to get hits and get on base." 
Sollmann's speed has been a valuable addition to the Irish 

on the basepaths and with his scrappy play in centerfield. 
The 5-foot-8 lefty is the only freshman on Notre Dame's roster to have started all 21 games this season. Filling the hole in the outfield created by Eddie Hartwell's graduation, Sollmann has been a valuable asset for Murphy. 
"He is really coming into his own. He has unbelievable speed," said Murphy. "(Scott) getting on base helps every­one around him." 

A watchful eye at the plate moved Sollmann from the last three spots in the batting order to the lead-off spot for the last two spring break games. 
offense this year. He leads the Irish with 13 stolen bases and six of his 22 hits have been bunt singles giving him the second best on-base percent-

Softball ready for milestone 
By MEGAN McGRATH Sports Writer 
The song ·remains the same for the Notre Dame softball team. 
"Blame it on the Rain." 
tC Hopefully, nature will cooper­ate and allow the Irish to play a doubleheader today against Western Michigan in Kalama­zoo. The Irish were scheduled to host DePaul Monday at Ivy Field, but rain early in the day forced the game to be canceled, and Irish coach Liz Miller had to wait for another chance to get her 600th career victory. While this milestone places Miller among the elite of NCAA coaches, it is not the most pressing thing on her mind. "To be perfectly honest, I didn't even know I was close to that number because I don't really keep track," Miller said. Of greater concern to Miller is the high-powered Western Michigan offense, led by South Bend native Stephanie Hentler-


son. The junior is currently batting .500, which is tied for sixth best in the NCAA. 
"We know they're going to have a strong offense, " Miller said. "Henderson went 10-for­13 this weekend in a four game series. They can hit and they run very well. Hopefully we will be able to get them to make some mistakes." 
Hoping to stifle the Western Michigan bats will be pitchers Terri Kobata and Joy Battersby. 
Kobata, the MCC player-of­the-week, is coming off a phe­nomenal weekend in which she threw a perfect game, a no-hit­ter, and won another game in a relief appearance. She is sec­ond in the NCAA with 11.0 strikeouts per game. 
Freshman Battersby has a 10­4 record and a 1.94 ERA, but more intimidating for to­morrow's opponent is that the Irish have won the last eight games in which she has started. 
The Irish have displayed
