University announces campaign 
by Marit Hogan Editor-in-Chief 

The Campaign for Notre Dame, a five-year development program instituted to increase the University's endowment, was revealed today at the Campaign Inaugural Assembly. 
Approximately 600 trustees, faculty, students, alumni, parents and volunteer workers attended the Campaign Inaugural Program today as Dr. John H. Knowles, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, gave the keynote address at the Inaugural Assembly publicly announcing the kick-off of the campaign. 
The goal of the campaign, $130 million, is to "undergird our academic future with dramatically increased permanent endowment," said Rev. Theodore Hesburgh. 
At present, Notre Dame's $108 million endow­ment is the largest of any Catholic university but smaller than that of many leading independent universities. Hesburgh cited the reason for increas­ing the endowment saying, "If you take the ten universities in this country with the largest endowment, you wiii have the ten best universities in this country." 
Almost 75 percent of the campaign's goal, $92 million, wiii be set aside for Notre Dame's endowment. According to John T. Ryan, University trustee and chairman of the campaign, $57.8 million or 45 percent of the goal has already been committed to the program in advance gifts. 
The Campaign for Notre Dame grew out of the recommendations of the Committee on University priorities (COUP) which reported in December, 1973. The committee's recommendations were then formed into development goals after involved consultation with University trustees, members of its advisory councils and alumni leaders. 
The major portion of the endowment will cover named professorships, the Memorial Library collect­ion, student aid, campus ministry, and a variety of research, educational and service programs, espec­ially in the area ofthe Catholic Church. 
In addition to the endowment, $29.3 million is slated for physical facilities including a classroom­faculty office building, a chemical research structure ,and an undergraduate residence hall. Also extensive renovation is scheduled for the Administration Building and Washington Hall. 
The campaign also seeks $8.7 million in unre­stricted funds to underwrite current operations. 
As the ninth largest campaign now in progress in American universities, the Campaign for Notre Dame will more than double the $52 million goal set in its last fund-raising drive which concluded in 1972. Between 1960 and 1972, Notre Dame raised more than $108 million, much of which went to construct the library and the Athletic and convoca­tions Center (ACC). That total included $12 million The Bender proposal called forin matching funds from the Ford Foundation scrapping the SLC in favor of athrough its "Special Program in Education," Campus Life Council (CLC) todesigned to creat regional centers of academic include hall rectors and students asexcellence.

life,'' he added. 
Bender defended his proposal saying hall life is the focus of most student problems. He added his belief that the SLC has not proved to be effective in the past. 
Bender also said he was against a suggested compromise of having the CLC be a subcommittee of the SLC because its influence would be less direct. 
General reaction to the proposal at the meeting was mixed. Trustees responded, neutrally, while out going student leaders reacted neg­atively. The newly-elected student government officials present dis­played enthusiasm for their pro­posal. 
Since no action will be taken on the proposal by the Board of Trustees this weekend, any deci­sion will be postponed to a future meeting. The next full meeting of the board will be in November. 
Another subject discussed by the committee was the continued ren­ovation of LaFortune Student Cen­ter. Gassman presented the results of a student government question­naire, dealing with student opinion on the present facility and what students hope future renovation 
~would include. "Only five percent of students believe LaFortune is adequate as it is," Gassman said. "Seventy-four percent of the student body use the center on a monthly basis at best." Other results of the question­naire showed students would like LaFortune to include bank and stamp machines, a sit-down food service, bowling lanes, a game room and a store to purchase amaH items.

Carter dumps $50 tax rebate plan 
WASIDNGTON [AP) -Ameri­cans won't be getting those $50 tax rebates from Uncle Sam after all because President Carter has de­cided the economy is 'doing well enough wjthout them, the White House said yesterday. 
Taxpayers who spent their re­bates in advance -and economists say there may be many of them ­apparently will be out of luck. But Wall Street, worried that the rebates would be inflationary, re­acted with enthusiasm an<l stock prices rose ten points in early trading. · . 
Carter is to announce his anti-in­flation program at a news con­ference today. 
The decision to scrap the rebate was made Wednesday night and obviously caught some advisers by surpurse. Both Treasury Secretary 
W. Michael Blumenthal and Labor Secretary Ray Marshall made speeches in recent days arguing for the rebate. 
Also scrapped was a proposed two percent increase in the invest­ment tax credit for business. 
The rebate would have put about $10 billion in the pockets of taxpayers, and the credit would have given business about $2 billion. 
An average family of four with income below $20,000 could have expected $200 in rebates. 
"That's not enough for a down payment on a new car," one government economist said, ''but it will buy a television set, a washing machine or a new suit of clothes." 
Both the rebate and the invest­ment tax credit were major ele­ments in the $31 billion, two-year economic stimulus program that Carter proposed to Congress soon after taking office in January. 
The rebate plan was in-trouble in the Senate, largely because of fears it would fuel inflation and do little to help the economy. But admini­stration spokesmen insisted the decision to scrap the rebates was made for economic reasons, not political considerations. 
-But Blumenthal and Budget Di­rector Bert Lance led the move to convince Carter to withdraw the rebate plan, one source said. 
''They told him the economy was looking strong enough without it. 
Most economic indicators except for the stock market are looking stronger.'' 
Whatever the reason, the reac­tion in the Senate was swift and favorable. Carter called key sena­tors Wednesday night to inform them after the decision was made. 
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd said it's a "wise decision" because "the justifications that seemed apparent for the rebate last December have less validity at t~is 
time." 
Senator Abraham Ribicoff 

(D-Conn.), a member of the Senate 
Finance Committee said, "I com­
ment the President for being 
realistic and willing to recognize 
changing economic conditions. His 
decision showed great leadership." 
Sen. Carl Curtis (R-Neb.) said he 

is "delighted" because the rebate 
plan ''was a gimmick for sendout 
out about $10 billion in money we 
didn't have. I believe the President 
became aware that his plan would 
be beaten in the Senate.'' 
Less enthusiasm was expressed by House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill, who said, "We will still have the rebate over in the Senate and ifthings change we will be able to get it. Unemployment continues -to be a problem and the Congress remains committed to reducing it.'' 
The House already had approved the rebate. 
Wall Street's enthusiasm was expressed by Charles Jensen of Merkin and Co., an investment firm, who said, "Carter's canceling the $50 tax rebate plan was well-received. . .Investors consid­ered it inflationary." 
One government economist, who did not want to be quoted by name, said that advance spending of rebates by consumers may have been largely responsible for the rebound in economic activity in March, following the harsh winter weather in January and February. 
He said the figures on consumer borrowing and spending in recent weeks show that consumers are willing to go into debt to buy things. He said it is hard to predict how they will react if they do not now get the rebates they had hoped to use to pay these bills.

Roemer states poster policy 
by Michael Lewis 
Dean of Students James Roemer has announced that all posters and announcements must be placed on campus and hall bulletin boards. 
This policy will ban placing posters in many areas, such as on dormitory walls and on the walls of other campus buildings. . 
"In the past year I've received ' many complaints about the litter these posters cause. Also, many important announcements are ig­nored because of the proliferation of posters on the walls," Roemer stated. 
Roemer also voiced concern ab­out area businesses that ''use the 
walls of campus buildings to ad­vertise their products.'' 
He went on to say that the policy should not adversely affect student affairs, stating, "The bulletin boards are meant to promote student activities.'' 
Roemer commented that person­al items on dormitory doors will not be affected, and added that the security and maintenance person­nel will enforce the policy.

Julian Samora accused the Un­iversity of institutional racism. citing statistics that show that the number of minority and women staff members has decreased the past two years. Notre Dame, in its Affirmative Action Statement to HEW, said it planned to have 80 women and 70 minorities on the staff this year. There were 64 women and 48 minorities on the staff in 1974. Today the number has dropped to SO women and 41 minority staff members. 
"This gives you a picture of how fast we are moving backwards," Samora said. "One has to wonder about the commitment of this University given its own state­ments, its own goals, and its own practices." 
Joseph W. Scott, professor of sociology, accused the Universy of empty rhetoric and symbolism, while doing little to recruit minority students. In 1970 two per cent of the students were black, and this numberhas not increased. Com­pared with peer institutions. such as Yale, Harvard, or Brown, which have from four to nine per cent blacks, Notre Dame always is on the bottom of the list.

Bars Issue 
two-sided 
Dear Editor: 
Living on Notre Dame Ave., I find myself residing in the middle of the local bars (yeh!) However, the recent (but not new) complaint of local residents to the noise, litter and other public nuisances in the area is a two-sided issue that ARthur Quigley should also ponder. · 
First of all, I have had attempts made on my person to steal my wallet in our local laundry mat. The robber was a local resident. My other apartment mate has been exposed to near Corby's. Shop­ping, jogging and attempting to come to and from school are not exactly the safest situations. I think that A.';thur Quigley should note the recent ourning of the vacant house on Notre Dame Ave. as done by local residents. We are bothered at least three times a week by children pounding at our door early in the morning to ask to take out our garbage. Twice, "locals" have come to our door with no intentions but to try to enter and view our living situation. 
The Northeast Neighborhood Asociation has never asked me what I feel about living here or offered me any improvements to this sadly-lived-in section of town. South Bend polic~ are very helpful and informative, though. 
Mr. QuigleY', why should Rick Kanser keep your streets clean? He runs his establishment smooth­ly and cleans his area. Nobody appointed him Mr. Sanitation. It should be students' and residents's responsibility to keep a clean area. These people are living in a student area and must. accept this as I accept the fact that I have chosen one of the most unsafe neighbor­hoods in South Bend to live in. When the locals also clean up their trash and "acts" and the students follow suit, then the neighborhood might improve. But don't out the blame entirely ori the bar owners and students of ND-SMC.

Letters to a Lonely God I 


To Kevin at Ordination ·~ 
By Reu. Robert Griffin 
This motning, when I awoke, it was seven o'clock and Easter week, and I could hear the trees growing outside. I thought of Kevin being ordained as priest in Sacred Heart Church on Saturday. I said to my dog, Darby O'Gill, who was astonished at being spoken to so early: "I wonder if Kevin knows that from now on, part of him will be forever April?" Darby, puzzled by the metaphysics, thumped his tail three . times on the floor, stretched, yawned, and went back to sleep. Thus left alone, I thought of being newly ordained, feeling stiff and over-dressed in a new black suit. I thought of the burning candles and fresh altar linens and the golden vessels of a first Mass. I pondered the mystery of the Christ-death and the living Lord celebrated in a ministry of sacraments, and of the sorrow and love, birth and death, of friends needing in their lifetimes the words and rituals of peace and grace, but gathered at ordination merely to share in the happiness of the newly hatched priest. Especially I remembered Kevin,at the Easter Vigil last Saturday;' singing the Paschal proclama­tion. 
My dearest friends, standing with me in this holy light, join me in asking God for mercy that he may give his unworthy minister grace to sing his Easter praises ... Accept this Easter candle, a flame divided but undimmed, a pillar of fire that glows to the honor of God . ..May the Morning Star which never sets find this flame still burnin~; Christ, that Morning Star, who came back from the dead, and sheds his peaceful light on all mankind... 
Oh, Kevin, do you know that in your life as a priest, candles cannot be compared to thee as light from the light, (lumen de luminel) of the Morning Star? 
You know, Kevin, a long time ago when we were both younger, I was your teacher; and I shared with you the way I felt about Hemingway and Salinger and Fitzgerald. Now, on the before your ordination, I want to share another lesstm, not expecting that it will be truth for your life, but hoping it might. I want to mention to you the children and the Eucharist. 
On the streets of Portland, Maine, on my second day home as a newly-ordained priest, I discovered the blessed advantage (there are a number of nuisances) of wearing the Roman collar. I must have been thinking of encyclicals that afternoon, or considering the horns of a dilemma issuing from a recent papal bull. Suddenly, I dis~overed I had been sighted by a posse of Catholic children, on their way home from school, who instantly took me prisoner with their smiles and shyly-whis­pered hellos. For them, I was Father, a friend to be trusted as Jesus might be trusted, or the Tooth Fairy. For me, they were representatives of all the children I would ever have--and stand-ins for the children I would never have. Years later, when I visited Northern Maine near Canada, the children met on the sidewalk would be French, and their street greeting would be, "Mon pere, mon pere!" Still, because of the clerical collar, language barriers were leapt over., and those children and I knew that we belonged to each other,, You can't hope for Instant friendship with the street urchins without wearing the collar, Kevin; dangling cruci­fixes and Jerusalem crosses won't do it. In some neighborhoods, you risk arrest, or a thrashing from an irate umbrella (from the godmother) if you frighten children as a stranger who pats them on the head without the credential of a uniform that makes you identifiable as a father they have ciaims on. , 
(I mention the children as one of the fringe benefits of being ordained old-fash­ioned, Kevin.) 
Next to yourself, the gift you will share best is the Eucharist. Others can preach or declare redemption; a scrub lady in a nursing home can baptize just as validly as you. But in the tradition and discipline of the ctmrch, the Eucharist is your business, Kevin. Popes cannot do more with it than 
can do; saints and who lack

Neil Diamond/ 

Loue at the Greek 
By Scott Appleby 
"The stage--she is the goddamnedest woman you ever saw!", _,. 
From the blue sequin of his latest show suit to the affected gyrations of his lithsome figure, Neil Diamond is made for the stage. Among the regular celebrity night club circuit, he has no peer. He is the unquestioned showman, the popular entre­preneur of all that is exuberant and infectious and irresistably maudlin in the musical entertainment business" 
With this in mind, one should expect that Diamond's newest release, Love at the Greek·-a double album recorded live at the Greek theatre in Los Angeles--would inculcate a good bit of that fabricated, appealing image. 
And indeed it does--perhaps to its eventual discredit. What Diamond has effected in this follow-up to the 1973 Greek concert (Hot Aligust Night) is an aggran­dizement of his stereotypic portrait of passionate-lover-turned-entertainer. He certainly has us believing it in such classic, ageless songs as "Holly Holy" and "Sweet Caroline": his inflection is colored by just the right amou,nt of energy and enthusi­asm. He asks us to believe in him only as a singer expressing himself , through his natural, mutually understood medium. Thus, when he approaches a number head-on, as he happily does in several instances on this album, he is honest, articulate, often moving. The audience, both "live" and vicarious, is entertained because they are accepting the "act"--the psuedo-lover or evangelist or moralist or whatever·-without realizing that it Is just a sham. 
So far, so good. While restrained, Diamond has captured our sensibil~ties. But it is when he overreaches this mutual ordination cannot even speak the mystic words. If you were a surgeon, you would be concerned with heartbeats. if you were a lawyer, you would reverence a tradition called the law. If you were a singer or dancer, harmony would entrance you; if you were a poet, you would love the word. For us, as priests, the Mass is the heartbeat of redemption, the fulfillment of the law, the love feast of the Word made Flesh, the harmony of love and suffering with lyrics and music by God and man. 

I'm not telling you news you have never heard before, Kevin; I'm not trying to preach to you. I just want to assure you that in the twenty-three years of priesthood I know about, the Mass does not grow less wonderful. Celebrations of the Eucharist will shape your life: leading you up many a dark stairway, down alleys where you never planned to go. (Only as a priest would I ever have lived on 42nd streeet). Some days, rituals will bore you with routine; your gospel proclamations will seem tired; as often as not, you will find yourself the minister ministered unto. Just at the moment when your , faith feels dullest, you will look around and see faces as friendly and happy as those of school children who have surprised you on the street and claimed you as a Father. The feeling is like being ordained again. 
It is the Eucharist kept fresh in faith, Kevin, that keeps our priesthood in an April mood. In a vineyard where Christ is the Vine, and we are the branches, all of us--~lie most recently ordained, the oldest cleric~-are alive with the newness of springtime belonging to the Lord as his eternal feast. The Eucharist is eternity revealed in a moment when Jesus is recognized in the daily breaking of the bread. 
Oh, Kevin, as a priest celebrating mysteries spanning the lifetime of God, I cannot feel old; yesterday, today, and tomorrow are like my ordination day. In the proper season of my life, when the years have had their fill of me, I will shuffle off to my Father's house, praising him for the adventure of earth. You, as the younger man sifting dust into the gaping hole, will survive me to say: "Eternal rest and peace, old Griffer." But in the meantime, in our moments together as priests, both of us are still children and always will be children--awaiting the surprises and discoveries of God's summer day. 
As I mentioned earlier, at seven o'clock this morning, when I tried to explain this to Darby O'Gill, he stretched, yawned, and went back to sleep. Two things you can't explain to a cocker spaniel: forever April, and the eternal priesthood. 
I hope you understand them, Kevin, because now you are part of both mysteries. Welcome, Kevin. Welcome to the newest pr~ests of C.S.C.

silent agreement and launches into an undisciplined, capricious facade that we cant help but notice that he is not sincere. 
On "Song Sung Blue", an uncontrover­sial little ditty in the studio, Diamond destroys the mood he has set in the previous soft set by hauling of all people, Helen Reddy up on stage to join in a sterile chorus. As if this is not enough, she is followed by the notorious "Fonz", Henry Winkler, who turns the song into a Jaff-a-minute comedy routine.

manipulation would offend only the musi­cal purist who ca,me to be entertained by talent and not by extemporaneous malarky. But Diamond does nothing to disabuse himself of the haunting impression that the excitement and enthusiasm in his voice is half gravel, half money. 
In side four, the composer performs artistic suicide by squeezing the 45-minute genius of orchestration and melody, "Jon­athan Livingston Seagull" into a 15 minute pop medley worthy of only the amateurish. 
Not rttat all of this is traumatically bad business; in fact, it holds a certain amount of desirability, considering that Diamond is playing to an audience of such diverse age and background. (Only King Elvis rivals Diamond in across-the-board commercial draw.) And one certainly cannot claim that Lave at the Greek is wholly devoid of vigorous performing and arranging; on the .contrary, its fine moments ('Beautiful Noise," for example) offer a glimpse of an excellent, talent at his peak. 
It is simply a sad fact that the stage, like any mistress, is fleeting, momentary, illusory. With a talent like Neil Diamond she becomes, in the succinct description of top UMOC candidate Otto, "a dream far too beautiful to be believed.''

Roemer defended Security's ac­tions. stating. "If a crime, such as an assault, had been committed. there would be no question about the fact that an arrest would have been made immediately, and the 
man immediately taken to jail. In the situation of trespassing, the general policy is not to make an arrest. 
"In this case, we didn't feel that there was the possibility of f1,1rther 
.violence, and didn't feel that an · arrest would be the best thing. We thought that the best thing would be to get the man away from here," he said . 
'·We have no official policy on this matter, because every in­dividual situation is so unique," Roemer explained further. "Thou­sands of people come onto this campus every year who are not members of the community.

Bookstore tourney play continues

by Frank LaGrotta Sports Writer 
The first round of Notre Dame's annual Bookstore Basketball ex­travaganza continued yesterday with Women's Liberation stealing the show in the premier game of the day. LAW, led by Notre Dame basketball stalwart Jeff Carpenter and former Irish grid All-American Greg Marx, took on the Green Machine, a team comprised of five Notre Dame women, and emerged victorious by a 21-7 margin. 
There was little doubt that the Green Machine came ready to play JS they arrived on the scene dressed in light green game shirts and green hot pants. Coa_ches Anne Boland and Mary Massman arrived garbed in three-piece suits and carnations that rivaled Dig­ger's finest attire. However, LAW proved to be too much for the courageous females, as Marx's six buckets and Carpenter's five allow­ed the men to advance to the next round of Bookstore action. 
Dana Snoap, a member of last year's All-Bookstore team, tallied 4 baskets for the winners while Marcia "AI" Mach, Anne "Chris­tine" Massulo and Mary "Mike" Ryan finished the day with two buckets apiece for the Green Machine.

The Nutmeggers, down at one point 16-14, relied on tight defense to put their opponents away. Mike Howard led the win­ners wiht seven tallies, while Mark Meyer added five to the cause.

For Ba Ka Ya Do, the high-scor­ing honors went to Pete Cuilla who's four timely tallies in the first halfled his team to an early nine to four lead over the eventual win­ners. Cuilla finished the day with five buckets and Bob Key added four to Ba Ka Ya Do's losing effort. 
In the highest scoring contest in this year's tournament, thus far, 
D.F. and the Fumducks outshot Bak's Jocks 26-24.Joe McGuire led the Fumducks with 14 baskets, the best individual scoring effort of this year's tourney, while Cresswell Hizer turned in 12 for Bak's Jocks. 
The day was marked by some outstanding individual perform­ances, most notably, Dan Short's 12 buckets, which included four dunks (high for the tournament thus far). Short led his team, Colonel Leo's Fighting Legions to a 21 to 3 thrashing of the <.;o~os. 
Dean Merton also exh1b1ted mer­itous accuracy as his 10 for 14 shooting performance from the field led Gary Gillmore's Salt Lake City Sharpshooters to a 21-13 win over Foul Mouth. 
Bookstore action continues to­night at 6:15 behind when the tournament's number two-seeded team, Ebony Magic, led by Toby Knight, Luther Bradley and Dan Knott, take on Gary Gilmore's Firing Squad. First round action winds up on Saturday when a full schedule of 64 games are schedul­ed at the three Bookstore sites.
