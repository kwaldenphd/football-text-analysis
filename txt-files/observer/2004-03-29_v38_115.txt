Majors show some gender imbalance 
College of Science, architecture school are exceptions 
Editor's note: This is the first in a two-part series on gender representation in Notre Dame's colleges. 
By KATE GALES News Writer 
How often does a professor look over his or her 100 students and see 47 women and 53 men? 
Not often. Instead, many imme­diately notice a striking difference in the number of men and women enrolled in a particular class. 
None of the University's five undergraduate divisions -the College of Arts and Letters, the College of Science, the College of Engineering, the Mendoza College of Business and the School of Architecture -can claim a gender breakdown exact­ly proportional to the 4,358 men and 3,813 women making up Notre Dame's undergraduate population, according to the Office of Institutional Research. However, some areas see a more significant sex discrepancy than others. A closer examination of the people behind the statistics generated each semester reveals changing trends in education. 
Deans, professors and advisers at Notre Dame have worked to combat stereotypes of a single sex dominating a college or major. Although some generaliza­tions have held true, two areas where there is a significant gen-

It's a man's world, and that's exactly what Cathy Pieronek is trying to change. 
At Notre Dame, nearly four out of five students enrolled in the College of Engineering are male. Women are a visible and significant minority, comprising only 21.5 percent of the under­graduates enrolled in the col-

l~ge. 
"Our biggest goal is keeping the women who already go here interested and making sure the program meets their needs," Pieronek, director of the Women's Engineering Program, said. 
The WEP was created in 2002 to better serve the needs of females in the College of Engineering.

Army ROTC cadets conduct field training in Michigan 

By MAIT BRAMANTI Senior StaffWrirer 
FT. CUSTER: Mich. -The Fighting Irish Battalion lived up to its name last weekend, as Notre Dame's Army ROTC unit conducted training exer­cises at Ft. Custer, near Battle Creek, Mich. 
About 85 Notre Dame ROTC students joined more than 200 cadets from Central, Western and Eastern Michigan Universities and the University of Michigan for the weekend­long field training exercise ­dubbed "Operation Snow Warrior." 
The battalion left Pasquerilla Center Frid.ay afternoon and drove to Ft. Custer. Upon their arrival, the cadets -clad in camouflage fatigues and combat boots ­stowed their equipment in barracks that once housed German prisoners of war dur­ing World War II. The cadets then assembled behind the base's headquarters building for a regimental activation ceremony, where personnel from all five universities were put under the command of Lt. Col. Kelly Jordan, Notre Dame professor of military science. After an honor guard unveiled the regimental colors -a gold flag bearing the shield from the Notre Dame seal-Jordan encouraged the cadets to use their time at Ft. Custer effec­tively. Jordan, a former instructor at West Point who has a Ph.D. in history, com­pared the weekend's opportu­nities to the Allied invasion at Normandy in 1944. 
"Just like Eisenhower had a 36-hour window on D-Day, you'll have a short window to make the most of your train­ing time here," he said. "We've got a lot of.great things for you." 
The FTX is intended to pre­pare students for the Leader Development and Assessment Course, taken during the sum­mer after the cadets' junior year. The LDAC, held at Ft. Lewis, near Tacoma, Wash., is a 32-day course that prepares cadets for careers as Army officers. Cadets -who are commissioned as second lieu­tenants before graduation from Notre Dame -receive full scholarships in return for your time to pass on your a four-year commitment to knowle\lge," Jordan said. active duty.

Of age 

"Score!'' The cadet's face lit up as he held up seven-dollar cup of Bud Light. "They said they'd give out free beer for a man in uniform!'' 
He trotted proudly back up the bleacher steps, 
showing off his alcoholic badge of appreciation to the 60-odd sol­diers who had accompanied him to this Detroit Tigers-Cleveland Indians spring 


training game in Claire Heininger Lakeland, Fla., and urging them 
to go cash in on News Editor the deal for them­selves. "That is," he added with a smirk, "ifyou're of age." 
Sitting three rows down .at Joker Merchant Stadium, savoring peanuts with the shells still on and avoiding the swatting arms of would-be foul ball snatchers, his comment snapped me out of my lazy Sunday haze. 
Of age. 

Here were soldiers dotting the third base line grandstand with their black hats, lace-up combat boots and full­length camouflage, worn proudly if damply in the 83-degree sun. Here were soldiers taking a day off from training, from preparing to fight for their country, so they could watch career minor leaguers take a swing at clearing the advertisements -from "Ballpark Franks: A Hot, Steamy Love Affair" to "CBS Fantasy Baseball: We built it, come"-that covered the out­field fences. Here were soldiers shrugging the weight of the most powerful country in the free world off their shoulders, if only for an ugly three-hour, five-error slugfest. 
And here was that country telling them they couldn't handle a beer. 

These were not indignant 17 year olds begging for booze, nor were they devious 20 year olds wielding shoddy fake ID's to enter an even shoddier bar. These were men and women who wake up before the crack of dawn to train for a war that major politicians are contesting and half of Americans don't believe in. These were dedicat­ed, sacrificing professionals, "of age" to join in heated combat on the battle­field -but underage to take a sip while watching the action on the infield. 
Though it didn't seem to concern them at the moment-taunts of "you know I could play third base better than that!" and "balk! balk!" rever­berated off the metal stands above me -the biting contradiction of the situ­ation hit me hard. 
I was bound for five nights of break in Miami Beach, but the peanuts sud­denly made me feel sick to my stom­ach, and I let the bag crunch under my feet. ·1 doubt the men in uniform knew where they were headed, but for the at least half of them who were clearly under 21-hell, they didn't even need to shave-it sure wasn't to the concession stand. 
"Game time," read the final sign, a cursive "Budweiser" scrawled across six feet of dead center field.

Students gather for peace 
By KATIE MOUNTS 
News Writer 
Speakers from the Notre Dame community, across the nation and from abroad gath­ered to speak at the two-day Notre Dame Peace Conference Friday and Saturday, which organizers called a success even though fewer students than desired attended the event. 
One of the most prominent speakers, Juan Mendez, Notre Dame's director of the Center for Civil and Human Rights at the Notre Dame Law School and adopted "Prisoner of Conscience" of Amnesty International. spoke about the importance of combining con­cerns for peace with those for human rights. 
"Peace, along with the absence of violence and killings, means a redress of human rights violations," he said. He questioned the often lesser pri­ority given to consequences of human rights violations as a part of amnesty agreements. 
"The point is to insist on a better peace. 
Some of the most popular presentations were a debate on just war, a moderated discus­sion on America's domestic issues with peace and another discussion on case studies relat­ed to the establishment of peace. 
Notre Dame seniors Kate Belden and Maureen Fitzpatrick were two of the five presenters for the case studies presenta­tion. They spoke passionately about conflicts in Burma, an Asian country plagued by civil warfare. . 
"Kate and I have been con­
sumed with learning more 
about the situation in Burma," 
Fitzpatrick said. 
The two students are also putting their words into action on campus by trying to establish Notre Dame's own chapter of the Free Burma Coalition. Fitzpatrick thought the confer­ence was a "good opportunity to engage in dialogue about these issues." 
"On a campus that's not very politically active," Belden said, "we'll do anything we can to spread the word about the coalition. It's also very encour­aging to see the other case stud­ies and see what other people are doing." 
Student co-chair Monica JacirZablah said that with the diversity of topics, organizers were able to bring in a wider variety of speaker, including more international applicants, from different fields. 
Faculty sponsor Daniel Philpott spoke to the success of the conference. 
"It's fabulous," he said. "The students did an incredible job organizing and put an incredi­ble amount of time into it, and it's paying off." 
The event's success, however, only came after a tremendous amount of work by the student sponsors. 
"It was a lot more work than we expected," JacirZablah said. She said she had to handle "problems that came up with

every event" such as making sure the schedule was followed carefully to ensure that all later events were not delayed. 
JacirZablah also commented on the lack of political activism and student enthusiasm for peace studies, given the low attendance by Notre Dame stu­dents. 
Thus, while over 100 people attended this year's conference, more than in past years, organ­izers were still disappointed that less than two percent of the Notre Dame community attend­ed the widely publicized event.

Organizers are pleased with Spring Visitation 
By AMANDA SHROPSHIRE 
News Writer 

The excitement of Spring Visitation weekend has come to an end, with the departure of 160 visiting minority stu­dents. 
This annual event introduces minority students to life at Notre Dame, in hopes that they will choose to attend the University. Spring Visitation weekend began over 20 years and is filled with events that try to relate to the students on many different levels. 
Many current Notre Dame students, like juniors Stephanie Marshall and Nicole Rogers, served as hosts. 
"The first night my recruit and I toured campus because she wanted to walk around and take pictures," Marshall said. "My recruit went to the. BCAC Fashion Show and Latin Expressions without me because I had to work. She seemed to enjoy herself and to be having a lot of fun." 
Latin Expressions and the BCAC Fashion Show are the major events that take place during the weekend. To most, these events serve as an intro­duction to what can happen at Notre Dame. 
Rogers said the weekend influenced her decision to choose Notre Dame. 
"Spring [Visitation] definitely confirmed my desire to come to Notre Dame after seeing the people here," said Rogers. "The activities dur-ing the weekend are the most exciting because of the minority pres­ence. It is a good recruiting tool to promote diversity." 
But the sentiment also exists that the weekend is not an accurate representation of life at Notre Dame. 
"I also think it is important for the incoming students to know that Spring [Visitation] weekend does not accurately reflect the complexion of the student body on an everyday basis," Rogers said. 
Marshall did not attend Spring Visitation when she was in high school, but said if she had it would have helped her. 
"I didn't go to Spring [Visitation]," Marshall said. "I see now that if I had it would have made the transition bet­ter in terms of meeting people and making friends." 
Several organizers and stu­dent hosts said the weekend was a success, producing great events and a weekend of excitement on campus. They added that they heard many positive comments from the prospective students. 
"I think she was pretty close to making a decision to come to Notre Dame," Rogers said of her prospect.

According to Institutional

Bullene said that while the 
overall number of undergradu­

by about 10 percent per semes­

"The gender makeup of the class doesn't seem to shift," he said. 
Gina Martell, a fifth-year architecture student, agreed that equality has been achieved among students, but added that faculty had a long way to go. 
"We're pretty much exactly even," she said. "There are only two female teachers ... but [the faculty is] really aware that needs to be fixed." 
She cited the program's intense focus on classical archi­tecture as a potential jmpedi­ment to hiring a more diverse group of professors. 
While the relative lack of female role models in the school does not seem to be an impedi­ment to female student interest, Bullene confirmed the depart­ment is looking to diversifY. 
"Five years ago we were criti­cized for an under-representa­tion of women and minorities," Bullene said, speaking of the review each school of architec­ture undergoes every five years. 
"We're making progress ... It's just very hard to find available candidates, but it is a conscious goal of ours to address."

Official: Sharon should be indicted 
JERUSALEM -Israel's state attorney rec­ommended Sunday that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon be indicted for bribe-taking, officials said, in what is seen as a major -but not final -step toward his possible resignation. 
Such an unprecedented indictment of an Israeli prime minister could derail Sharon's proposal to withdraw from much of the Gaza Strip -or entice him to move more quickly on the "disengagement" plan, which has broad support in Israel. 
Sharon is meeting with President Bush in two weeks to try to win U.S. backing for a Gaza withdrawal. 
In Gaza, the new Hamas leader branded Bush "the enemy of God. the enemy of Islam," but stopped short of threatening to attack U.S. targets in retaliation for last week's assassination by Israel of the Islamic militant group's founder. 
Turkey's ruling party sweeps polls 
ISTANBUL, Turkey -Turkey's Islamic-root­ed governing party swept local elections across the country Sunday, according to early results; giving Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan a major victory. 
The results could strengthen Erdogan's hand in pushing for a solution in talks over the divided island of Cyprus. But it could also raise fears of a loosening ofsecular laws. 
Only about 1 percent of the vote had been counted but analysts said the outcome was not likely to change. The results showed Erdogan's Justice and Development Party winning may­oral races in Turkey's largest city, Istanbul, and in the capital, Ankara. It was also doing well in several other cities in the predomi­

BRIDGEPORT, Conn. -Northbound lanes on a stretch of one of the nation's busiest highways reopened Sunday, well ahead of schedule and three days after a fire partially melted an overpass. 
Construction workers cheered as a parade of cars, escorted by police, traveled on Interstate 95 for the first time since last week's crash of a tanker truck filled with heating oil. 

Minn. official's daughters charged 
ST. PAUL, Minn. -Two daughters of Minnesota Attorney General Mike Hatch were jailed in Chicago, accused of fighting with police after a night of heavy drinking. 
Elizabeth and Anne Hatch were celebrat­ing Anne's 21st birthday with friends at a nightclub Friday night when they got into an argument with a man at the bar. They were told to leave because they were intoxicated, Hatch spokeswoman Leslie Sandberg said. 
Security guards at the club flagged down police as they threw out the two women, who continued yelling outside, Chicago police spokeswoman JoAnn Taylor said. After police twice told the women to leave, Elizabeth Hatch ran toward the squad car and struck an officer in the face, knocking off the officer's glasses, Taylor said.

Judge frees identity thief despite plea 
LAFAYETTE -A judge freed a Mexican national who admitted she used another per­son's name and Social Security number to get a job, saying the justice system is not equipped to deal with the large number of such cases. 
In ordering unsupervised probation for Mireya Garcia, Judge Don Johnson rejected a probation officer's recommendation that the woman serve four years in prison. 
"The state court is not in a position to set­tle this national social problem," said Johnson, who let Garcia walk out of his Tippecanoe County courtroom Friday. "I'm concerned that we've got tens of thousands of people here under the same circum­stances. Are we going to just lock them all up? Our society is hiring these people." 



Commissioners press for testimony 
Rice says she wants to testify but is constitutionally barred and Bush won't budge 
Associated Press 

CRAWFORD, Texas ­White House allies and Republicans investigating the Sept. 11 attacks pressed Sunday to hear open testi­mony from national security adviser Condoleezza Rice, with one commissioner call­ing her refusal a "political blunder of the first order." 
Rice said in a TV inter­view that she wants to testi­fy publicly, but is constitu­tionally barred from doing so, a senior administration official said Sunday after­noon, before the program aired. Rice also said in the "60 Minutes" interview that she wants to me·et with family members of the Sept. 11 victims, to hear their concerns, the official said. 
President Bush, spending a long weekend on his Texas ranch, gave no ground, and several aides said he will not change his mind on letting Rice testify. But Bush sent her and other top administration officials out for television interviews to rebut fresh attacks on the way his administration has handled the threat of terrorism. 
Sharpening his criticism, former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke said President Clinton was more aggressive than Bush in try­ing to confront al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden's organi­gressional committee two cal" about terrorism betbre said the White House and zation. years ago.

Cadets then filed into the mess hall by squad, and had about five minutes to wolf down a meal of scrambled eggs and sausage, liberally doused with what one cadet called "the Army's favorite condiment" -hot sauce. 
Sophomore Avery Mortimer said military food isn't exact­ly great. 
"It's edible," Mortimer laughed. "It keeps you going." 
And the cadets certainly kept going. Following break­fast, they traveled to a train­ing area for a land navigation course. Cadets used maps, compasses and protractors to find seven designated points -trees marked by orange signs -scattered throughout the heavily wooded two­square-mile area. 
Some cadets, like junior Richard Moss, found it diffi'­cult to complete the course in the allotted three hours. 
"Yeah. it was tough," an out-of-breath Moss said, arriving at the scorer's table with only seconds remaining on the clock.

Company, 2nd Platoon, 1st Squad gathered to plan an ambush of approaching OpFor troops, they got some words of wisdom from Eastern Michigan's Master Sgt. Jay Hudson, a self­described "airborne ranger extraordinaire." 
''I want to see aggressive­ness and violence of action," Hudson bellowed. 
The cadets hid behind a small ridge overlooking a dirt road. When the OpFor troops approached, that violence of action became a reality, as 1st Squad opened fire, imme­diately "killing" several of the enemy. However, not every­thing went according to plan. As a squad member tried to drag a "wounded" OpFor sol­dier out of the road, the enemy leaped up, producing a grenade. 
Hudson chided 1st Squad's members for. their failure to properly search their wound­ed prisoners. 
"The way we train is the way we're going to fight," Hudson cautioned. 
In another lane Sunday morning, the instructor, Capt. Mike Gallagher, warned 1st Squad about the enemy troops' combat readiness. 
"Their morale is high," Gallagher warned. "They will fight aggressively if engaged." 
As squad leader Kelly Thompson, a Western Michigan student, began moving her troops forward, Gallagher wished them "happy hunting." 
And they were successful. When 1st Squad attacked Objective Bayonet -an OpFor observation post -the cadets

Moments later. a smoke grenade sent a billowing green plume through the woods, signaling members of 1st Squad to shift their fire, to avoid hitting their own troops. 
"Assault through!" Thompson yelled, ordering her cadets to take the objec­
tive. 1st Squad swarmed over the enemy post, "killing" all three OpFor soldiers in a matter of seconds. 
"Rough day at the office," Gallagher laughed as a van­quished OpFor soldier fell to the ground. 
Senior cadet Devin Miller 
said cadets should be self­
assured if they want to be 
effective commanders. 
"If you don't speak with authority, you've already lost the battle," Miller said. "Confidence in decision-mak­ing is the deciding factor." 
In addition to imparting tactical knowledge and lead­ership know-how, the exer­cises also taught cadets about the laws of war and proper handling of prisoners under the Geneva Conventions. Cadets were instructed how to treat noncombatants, not to fire at unarmed personnel and to evacuate prisoners from combat areas as soon as possible. 
Following Sunday's closing ceremony, cadets trucked back to campus, where they spent several hours in the basement of Pasquerilla Center, cleaning their rifles and equipment. 
Cadets praised the annual training event, saying it was an opportunity to put class­room concepts into practice. 
Junior John Dickson said the weekend's tactical mis­sions strengthened the battal­ion's knowledge of contempo­rary warfare. 
"It was a lot of good train­ing, and it was pretty fun," Dickson said. "Everyone learned a lot through the STX lanes." 
Senior Leon Gil praised the Notre Dame ROTC instructors who planned the event, say­ing it was run more smoothly than in previous years. 
"The new cadre are doing a great job, especially with the freshmen," Gil said.

IN BRIEF 

Strong consumer data continues rally 
NEW YORK-Investors, largely pleased with reports on consumer sentiment and spending, sent stocks higher Friday to continue the previ­ous session's rally, at least temporarily fending off the temptation to gather profits. 
The University of Michigan's consumer senti­ment index rose to 95.8 in March, up from 95.4 in February, according to media reports on the index, which is released to subscribers only. The hike could mean consumers may be willing to spend more, boosting the economy. 
Should better economic reports continue to come out regularly, they could spark the rally Wall Street has been waiting for, according to Brian Belski, market strategist at Piper Jaffray. 
"The market looks like it wants to rally into earnings and throughout the earnings season, and we could be back to focusing on inherent fundamentals like earnings and valuation," Belski said. "We're in a day-to-day. micro-reac­tive market that jumps on each little bit of news. If that news continues to be positive, we're in good shape." 
Crude gains slightly on gasoline 
NEW YORK-Crude oil futures rose modestly Friday in New York as bargain hunting and short-covering stemmed a two-day price drop, sparked by growing fear of a potential glut of world crude oil supplies during the second 
-quarter. Gasoline futures helped lift crude futures, ris­ing as traders who had bet prices would contin­ue lower found themselves having to cover those bets. A lack of evidence that dwindling gasoline stocks are going to be successfully replenished ahead of the peak-demand U.S. summer driving season added to gasoline's gains after Thursday's sharp drop, traders said. May light, sweet crude oil futures settled up 22 cents or 0.6 percent at $35.73 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after touch­ing a high of $35.82. Earlier in the session, the contract hit an intraday low of $34.75, dropping below $35 for the first time since late February. Crude oil futures fell 4 percent Thursday after White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card said on MSNBC that the White House is trying to con­vince the Organization of Petroleum Expor\ing Countries to release more oil to ease high prices. 






Officials investigate Lilly marketing 
Company says probe is expanding to include drugs Zyprexa and Prozac 
Associated Press 

INDIANAPOLIS -Eli Lilly and Co., already under fed­eral investigation for the way it promoted an osteo­porosis drug, said it faces a new federal probe of its marketing practices . 
The Indianapolis-based company said it believes the new probe also likely focus­es on the osteoporosis drug Evista, as well as Lilly's cur­rent top-seller, the antipsy­chotic drug Zyprexa, and its former blockbuster antide­pressant Prozac. 
Lilly, one of several drug makers to come under fed­eral scrutiny over market­ing issues, said the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania has begun a civil investigation. 
Rich Manieri. a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia, declined to comment. 
Lilly spokeswoman Terra Fox said the investigation is separate from an ongoin.g probe of Evista by the Department of Justice's Office of Consumer Litigation. Lilly had previ­ously disclosed that it received grand jury subpoe­nas in July 2002 and July 2003 over Evista promo­tions to consumers and doc­

BANKRUPTCY 




Top Conseco executives rewarded 
Associated Press 

CARMEL, Ind. -Top Conseco Inc. executives who helped the insurer emerge from the third-largest ban~­ruptcy in U.S. history were rewarded with nearly $34 million in compensa­tion lac;t year. 
However, they won't realize much of their gains for years because abou_t two-thirds of the compensation is in the form of restricted stock awards that vest over time. 
Papers filed last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that nearly half of last year's compensation-$16.7 million-went to William Shea, who took over as Conseco's chief executive following the company's Chapter 11 filing in December 2002. 
Shea received $13.6 million in restricted stock on top of $1 million in base salary and $2 million in bonuses for in total compensation, the compa­ny's annual report stated. Shea also got $68,739 in other compensation. . Most of the compensation for Shea and other top executives came in the form of stock awards for guiding Conseco through Chapter 11 reorgani­zation. 
Conseco entered bankruptcy protec­tion in December 2002 and emerged last September. This month, the Carmel-based company reported its first profitable quarter in two years. 
"These performance incentives were designed to retain each executive through the difficult emergence period and reward him for completing the reorganization," Conseco spokesman Jim Rosensteele told The Indianapolis Star for a story Friday. "They also reward each executive for continuing to drive long-term performance for shareholders after emergence." 
The compensation paid top officers was more than twice the $14.8 million Conseco 's key executives made in 2002 as the company slid toward bankruptcy. The contracts for Shea and the other two top-paid officers were negotiated last year while the company was in federal bankruptcy court, Rosensteele said. 
Chief Financial Officer Eugene M. Bullis made $8.6 million and 40/86 Advisors Inc. President Eric Johnson made $3.7 million. The bulk of the compensation was in restricted stock and bonuses. 
The restricted stock awards increase in value over time through vesting. For example, an owner might only be able to sell. one-third of stock during the first year of ownership. then two­thirds by the second year and all of it once it fully vests in the third year.

Students suffer the effects of Bush's educational policies 
The stately Ionic north portico of the White House is like a broken floodgate. All of President Bush's lies, perhaps, couldn't fit in that one building. And so the deluges of mendacity have cascad­ed down Pennsylvania Roque Strew Avenue. Nothing has been spared. No issue has gone Straight, unsullied by the No Chaser administration's deceit and sophistry -not the environment, labor, Medicare, WMD, nothing. Overlooked and unglamorous, education is without doubt among the most vital of these issues. 
Education, after all, is a basic social good. Bush might even concede this much. What he cannot concede on his next "Meet the Press" is that his poli­cies acknowledge this-education's vital importance. Fealty to the market, or the party line, or God knows what, trumps education for Bush. But where Prime Minister Tony Blair faced a firestorm of resistance to university tuition hikes in England, Bush gets a free pass. Tellingly, one charge leveled against Blair's plan is that it will reshape the British system in the image of the American -as costly and inac­cessible. 
Let's begin with one of the Bush's proudest accomplishments -the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) law. "Ironic" just doesn't quite convey the scale of inaccuracy of the law's name. This year, the administration is giving $9.4 billion less than what is needed to fully fund NCLB. Both Education Week and Harvard's Civil Rights Project testify that poor students aren't getting the tutoring promised by NCLB, due to poor implementation and underfunding. Urban minorities, of course, are hit hardest. The de facto title would be No Wealthy White Child Left Behind. Doesn't quite have the same ring. 
Wait until the kids grow up. This is the third straight year that Bush either

froze or cut the maximum Pell Grant ­quite the volte-face from his old cam­
paign promise to increase the maxi­mum, to help make college more affordable. And last year, Bush sought to eliminate Pell Grants entirely for 84,000 students, slashing aid to thou­sands more. An amendment backed by Democrats luckily prevented this. 
Republicans have exerted curiously special effort in slighting and burden­ing college students. Ten days ago, to counter GOP misinformation, Rep. George Miller issued a letter to demol­ish their untruths, point by point. 
First he reminded the House that the GOP has "failed to do anything mean­ingful this Congress" to help students of lesser means afford college. He added to Bush's record, with Pell Grants, that last year's maximum grant, adjusted for inflation, was worth $500 less than the max in 1975. And he wondered why nothing has come of Bush's prom.:. ise to help community colleges. 
In a March 17 Washington Post arti­cle, Miller quoted a line that nicely cap­tures the GOP agenda: "House Republicans are considering legislation aimed at reducing government subsi­dies for a federally supported student loan program, a step that critics say could lead to sharp increases in the long-term cost of going to college." Finally he drew attention to Republican support for a banking industry-backed plan to eliminate students' ability to lock in low interest rates over the life of their loans. This plan would force the average student borrower to pay more than $6,600 in extra interest, doubling 'the cost of loans for millions. There's no room for interpretation here. 
Vigilant compilers of the Harper's Index add two worrying stats: America's total private-loan debt for college tuition has increased by a factor of four since 1995; and a minimum of seven states will raise tuition by 20 per­cent or more at least one public univer­sity. You needn't be one of the eggheads in sweater vests at the Brookings Institute to spy a trend here. It's all kinds of wrong. It's in-your-face wrong. 
Barbara Ehrenreich in "Class Struggle 101" broke down university financing into a two-pronged approach -raising tuition and lowering staff pay. Notre Dame doesn't stray too far from this approach. The latest tuition hike here at Notre Dame was 6.9 per­cent. In Latin America, according to a comparative politics professor, students would take to the streets in protest, railing against a patent injustice. Here we've accepted extortion as the norm. And Notre Dame's record with its staff isn't exactly pretty-sending workers home early, not hiring replacements for retiring workers and vigorously fighting unionization. 
Noted in these pages by Kama ria Porter last week, Harvard's bucking the trend, proffering substantially more aid, for many disposing of tuition alto­gether. This is on top of such admirable efforts as its successful campaign and sit-in demanding a living wage for Harvard employees. Harvard is blazing the trail to a nobler place, showing schools like ours that there's a better way. 
But first this apathetic administration has got to go. For Bush and company, students -especially those from below the upper class :-are the last priority. Regardless of what side you're aligned with, free-education radical or con­cerned moderate, the fact is that Bush has failed students comprehensively. Moreover, he shows no signs of switch­ing directions. Moral epiphanies are as rare as candor in this administration. Along with the rest of the GOP, Bush is dedicated to indifference. We have to dedicate ourselves to ousting him.

Leave partisan 
finger-pointing 

out of Sept. 11 
The question "How did the Sept. 11 attacks happen?" is a noble question that deserves an answer if we're ever to stop future attacks. 
Sadly, the process was muddled when partisan finger pointing, on both sides, entered into the equation. However, nobody performed more blame-casting than Richard Clarke, for­mer White House counterterrorism adviser, who completely incidentally and not in any Mike Marchand way involved with his testimony before the 9/11 Commission, has a new book out, in stores now. Undistinguished 
It's far to<.> reductive to dismiss Clarke as Alumnus merely a disgruntled ex-employee who's seek­ing vengeance against the administration that demoted him and shut him out of the decision-making process, or a partisan hack out to sell copies of his books. He is both, of course, but he's not merely both. When it comes to counterterrorism, the man does know what he's talking about-he's served under four administrations in positions that are normally cycled out when a new president takes over. And if I'm someone who sincerely wishes to stop terrorism, I'd certainly rather listen to him than some paper­pushing bureaucrat. 
But instead of blasting the code of bureaucracy, which is as resist­ant to change as the other Dick Clark is to the normal human aging process, he instead lashed out against President George W. Bush and his administration. According to Clarke (the counterterrorism guy, not the "$25,000 Pyramid" guy), the Bush administration "ignored" the threat from al-Qaeda and then, after Sept. 11, focused too much on Iraq at the expense of destroying al-Qaeda. 
It would be a spectacular accusation, were it true in the slightest. Perhaps Clarke's "Hockin' New Year" calendar differs from mine, but I could have sworn we invaded Afghanistan to attack al-Qaeda near­ly two and a half years before entering Iraq to topple Sad dam Hussein. And Clarke feels that the administration "ignored" al-Qaeda during 2001 because they weren't "important enough for him to hold a meeting on the subject, or for him to order his national security advisor to hold a Cabinet-level meeting on the subject." But even though the administration's first Cabinet-level meeting concerning al-Qaeda happened just one week before the Sept. 11 attacks, Bush did in fact order National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice to com­pose a strategy to confront al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden in April of that year, saying he was tired of "swatting flies." Clarke even admits this in his book. 
But that belies the major point -Does Clarke really think that just holding meetings is an effective counterterrorism strategy? According to Clarke's 9/11 Commission testimony (but not his book, in which he blatantly contradicts this statement), there was "no higher priority" than terrorism in the Clinton administration. But during those two terms, the World Trade Center, two American embassies and the U.S.S. Cole were bombed. Clinton's Cabinet must have met a bunch of times. But yet the only counterstrikes were mis­sile attacks at some empty tents and an aspirin factory. The Bush administration might have done nothing to stop al-Qaeda in eight months. But the Clinton administration did practically nothing in eight years, and Clarke was the nation's top counterterrorism official during that time. Perhaps Bush was acting prudently by moving Clarke into a position two steps under Rice. 
I am not, by the way, seeking to blame the Clinton administration for Sept. 11 because they stood pat during al-Qaeda's formative years. As I noted above, the fault lies not with any'individual politi­cian but with the entire bureaucratic process, where inertia is king, and nobody acts to change anything without sufficient impetus. Everybody mismanaged during the period before Sept. 11, and Clarke admitted as much when he apologized to the victims of Sept. 11 for failing them. 
But hindsight is not sufficient enough to start pointing fingers. Partisan hacks want to undo the president's record following Sept. 11 by discrediting his record before it. Fine. So what should Bush have done? Acted preemptively? That seemed to go over real well when we did it last year. What should have been the reason for wip­ing out al-Qaeda in 2001, actionable intelligence? Gathered by the same people who are now being tarred and feathered for stating that Sad dam Hussein had vast caches of weapons of mass destruction? 
Bush's detractors want to have it both ways. And nobody saw that coming better than Richard Clarke. In an e-mail to Rice four days after Sept. 11, he said, "When the era of national unity cracks in the near future, it is possible that some will start asking questions like did the White House do a good job of making sure that intelligence about terrorist threats got to FAA and other domestic law enforce­ment authorities." He then summarized all the ways the administra­tion had tried to secure the nation before Sept. 11. 
Clarke can spin his record all he wants. But Clark still did it better on "American Bandstand."

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 




Does the Bible really· condemn homosexuality? 
Many Christians unquestioningly accept the claims of their respective churches that homosexual behavior is morally wrong. Many of the major denominations hold such a position, though they proclaim it at differ­ent dogmatic levels. Upon closer inspection, however, this condemnation of homosexual behavior is anything but a clear Scriptural directive. A faithful Christian must examine his or her position on this issue with scrutiny and honesty, rather than reflexive agreement with his or her church's stance. 
Such a careful analysis, I believe, does not lead to the conclusion that the Bible con­demns homosexual behavior. I will not con­demn others who reach a different conclu­sion, as it is ultimately a matter of faith, but I offer this analysis with the sincere hope it be received with an open heart and mind. 
Biblical arguments against homosexual behavior are usually based on passages such as Romans 1:26, which condemns "menfolk [who] have given up natural intercourse to be consumed with passion for each other." Other passages echo the same sentiment: Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 call "lying with another man" an "abomina­tion." Deuteronomy 23:17-18, Judges 19 and other pas­sages sometimes are translated to condemn sodomites. but this translation has been questioned, with modern translators preferring "male temple prostitute" to "sodorr.ite." 
In all these pas­sages, the biblical reader must con­sider the underly­ing theological rule as well as the cultural context. Put simply, what is the reason same-sex behavior was con­demned? And what was the society's understanding of homosexuality at the time of the writing of these passages? 
A broader examination of the Bible answers the first of these questions. Namely, scripture condemns acts that are inconsis­tent with the natural order of God's creation. Unsurprisingly, the authors applied this prin­ciple to homosexual behavior, for homosexu­al behavior had long been viewed as a choice to act counter to one's natural, God-given design. 
This understanding of homosexuality, as a choice, stood until the 19th and 20th cen­turies. Now, a growing body of scientific evi­dence strongly suggests that sexual orienta­tion, including homosexuality, is an orienta­tion, part of the natural, God-given design of each human. Just recently, in 1973, the American Psychiatric Association changed its classification of homosexuality to catego­rize it as an orientation rather than a disor­der. 
With this evidence, we see the biblical authors were incorrect to classify homosexu­al behavior as unnatural. As such, homosex­ual behavior cannot be said to break a com­mandment from God, as understood by scripture. 
Some argue that because of the fall of humanity in Genesis, humans are naturally inclined to sin, and that many sinful behav­iors, such as adultery and alcoholism, stem from natural human inclinations and dispo­sitions. 
The critical distinction is that the sinful natures of alcoholism, adultery and other behaviors do not stem from an argument on nature, but rather from the argument that these behavio.rs violate the divine values of love and respect for self and others. Argu­ments against homosexual behavior rely 
solely on nature, and thus a refutation of the 
nature argument is a refutation of the entire 
argument against homosexuality. 
Note this analysis does not challenge the 
divinely-inspired nature of the theological 
values being espoused by these authors. 
While many Christians disagree on how liter­
ally the Bible should be interpreted, such a 
question is unnecessary in this framework. 
Most agree the veracity of the theological 
instructions contained in the Bible should be 
paramount. 

The cultural and scientific understandings of the time of each scripture's writing must be determined so as to separate God's eter-· nal and unwavering values from those values particular to the given society. Only then can these values be clearly applied to today's society. 
The most literal readers of the Bible use 
this principle to explain why slavery is not 
condemned in Exodus and other Old 
Testament books, for example (Exodus 21). 
They say the institution of slavery did not 
exist in Old Testament times in the same way 
we think of it today. Additionally, they 
explain that slaves were proba­
bly servants under a family 
in a patriarchal-ordered 
 society. enjoying the benefits of the family structure rather than the inevitable struggle for sur­vival out on one's own. 
Whether or 
not this analysis 
of Exodus is 
convincing, it 
shows that liter· 
al Bible readers 
do indeed con­
sider societal 
norms and under­
standings when 
they attempt to 
uncover God's truth. To 
be consistent, they 
should also apply this tech­

nique to the issue of homosex­
uality. 

Furthermore, any biblical argument sur­rounding homosexuality must consider any possible examples counter to one's current position. David and Jonathan's relationship in Samuel may (although not necessarily) have risen beyond mere friendship. Note 1 Samuel 20:41: "David rose from beside the stone heap and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. He bowed three times, and they [he and Jonathan] kissed each other. and wept the more" and 2 Samuel 1:25-26: "How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan lies slain upon your high places. I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; greatly beloved were you to me; your love to me was wonderful, pass­ing the love of women." 
The above argument cannot be considered authoritative by itself. But may it act as one voice in a much-needed debate. Throughout the debate, remember this-in the hun­dreds of Jesus's teachings, he never men­tioned homosexuality, not once. Therefore, any position on homosexuality, whether for or against, cannot rightfully be elevated to the level of dogma as many Christian churches currently have so done. 
Rather, we should consider core lessons such as Genesis 1:27, "So God created humankind in His image, in the image of God he created them," and John 3:16, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him may not perish but may have eternal life."

Saturday Night Live alumnae crusades against conservative lieS 
AI Franken's new book uses dry humor to point out numerous discrepancies in politics 
By CLAIRE HAGEN Scene Writer 
AI Franken became famous as a Saturday Night Live cast member and Emmy-winning writer, playing characters like Stuart Smalley. Since leaving the show, however, he has turned his attention towards politics. He officially came out as a liberal with "Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot" in 1999, and has again used his satirical wit to criti­cize conservatives and the Republican Party with "Lies, and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them." 
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government offered Franken a fellowship in their Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy. Using a Harvard research team, Franken wrote this book. This Harvard fellowship and research team lend credit to the book's accuracy, especial­ly as Franken constantly reveals the lies of conserva­tive writers. Franken also points out that only one mis­
take was found in Rush 
Limbaugh. and Franken 
found that mistake himself. 
According to Franken, God told him to write "Lies" in response to individuals who claim the media has a liberal bias. Franken works to prove otherwise, attacking conser­vative media, especially char­acters like Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly. though Franken prefers to call them "Nutcase" and "Bill O'Lie-ly." By pointing out their blatant lies and conservative propa­ganda, Franken broadens his criticism to the entire Bush administration. 
For example, in his chapter entitled "Operation Ignore," Franken addresses both the conservative media's claims that President Bill Clinton was partly· to blame for Sept. 11 and that the Bush admin­istration worked to prevent any terrorist attacks. In refuting these claims, Franken first addresses how Clinton's administration had actively fought terrorism, especially from AI Qaeda, and had successfully subvert­ed several attacks. Franken 


then traces the George W. 
Bush administration's action from inauguration through September 11, emphasizing not only how little atten­tion the administra­tion paid to terrorism. but also how little Bush worked. 
Franken also often adds a creative spark to his satire. To point out the flaws of the ''No Child Left Behind Act," Franken writes his own standardized test, which calculates what percentage of children actually have been left behind because of Bush's reluctance to finan­cially support the pro­gram. Franken also attacks general con­servative ideology with a cartoon about "Supply-Side Jesus", showing how the Lord's teachings would have differed had He been a profit­hungry capitalist. 
The book is consis­tently informative and funny, as Franken takes the reader through his own per­sonal search for weapons of mass destruction. tells about his less-than­friendly encounter with former First Lady Barbara Bush. recounts a trip he took to the ultra-con­servative Bob Jones University and freely

Bush strategist. Readers 
learn a lot about politics and 
the players who currently 
dominate it, but the book is 
never dull. Franken's sharp 
humor keeps the book light 
and the reader laughing. 
"Lies" has received great reviews by liberals since its publication. However, conser­vatives probably want to avoid this book, as it blatant­ly mocks their ideology and leadership throughout. Franken attacks basically every member of the Bush administration and of Fox News. While he does make a point to be accurate and not resort to "lies," as he claims his opposition does, Franken's liberal agenda is clear and pronounced -ulti­mately limiting his audience. 
Overall, the book ·stands out because Franken blends his researched political state­ments with his dry humor, making "Lies" a great read, especially in the election year. Luckily, those interested in hearing more of Franken's witty political observations can catch his upcoming show "The O'Franken Factor" (a spin-off show of the ultra­conservative "The O'Reilly Factor") on the new Air America Radio, which will begining March 31. Franken's show will run Monday through Friday from 3 to 6 p.m.. and promises to point out and crtiticize more lies in conservative media and political platforms.

Rockets collect third overtime victory in 4 games 
Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE -The Houston Rockets scrambled in the fourth quarter to get to overtime -a place where they have been very comfortable recently. 
The Rockets rallied from a nine-point deficit with less than five minutes to go in regulation before beating the Milwaukee Bucks 111-107 for their third overtime win in four games. 
"The game is not 48 minutes for us, it is a 53-minute game now," said Yao Ming, who had 27 points, 13 rebounds and five blocks. 
In overtime, Milwaukee cut a seven-point lead to 108-107 with six seconds left when Houston's Jim Jackson made two free throws after not being called for an apparent traveling violation on the inbounds pass. 
Michael Redd then was called for a line violation while inbounding and Steve Francis made one free throw for the rmal margin. 
Francis finished with 2 3 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, while Maurice Taylor and Cuttino Mobley each added 19. 
Bucks coach Terry Porter got a technical in overtime while arguing that Yao, who commit­ted five personal fouls, should have been called for fouling Desmond Mason. 
"He got more than six fouls tonight," Porter said. "After the fifth, there were four or five that were very obvious." 
But the Bucks failed to convert when fouls were called, making just 20 of 34 free throw attempts compared to Houston, which went 39-of-45. 
"That might be the tale of the game," Redd said. "They had a decisive free throw advantage over us for most of the game, so that hurt us." 
Redd had 36 points and a career-high 14 rebounds for the Bucks while Joe Smith scored a season-high 25 points. Milwaukee was without Keith Van Horn, who spr.ained his left ankle and bruised his left calf Friday against Chicago. 
The Bucks were hoping to rebound after a tough road trip, when they lost three of five. But they lost their fourth straight at home for the first time since February 2000 and missed a chance to tie New Orleans for fourth place in the Eastern Conference. 
Milwaukee has a one-game lead over Miami for the fifth playoff spot.

"I give a lot of credit to Jermaine O'Neal for stepping in there and playing today," Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. "His knee is better but it's still a little sore, and it's tough to come in there after missing a couple of games." 
O'Neal made the start for Indiana after missing the past two games with a bruised left knee, injured in a win over the Chicago Bulls last Monday. O'NeaLplayed 35 minutes, scor­ing 10 points in the third quar­ter. 
"I didn't shoot as well as I wanted," said O'Neal, who fin­ished 8-of-21 from the field. "I think it's rust. Hopefully, it'll come with a day of practice and these two games with Milwaukee." 
Caron Butler, Eddie Jones and Dwyane Wade each scored 14 points for the Heat, which had their seven-game winning streak end. 
Ron Artest added 18 points and 12 rebounds for the NBA­leading Pacers despite having to leave the game briefly with a sprained right ankle. 
Artest was later hit in the face going up for a rebound in a physical game in which the teams combined for 49 fouls, including four technicals and two flagrants. Artest will have his nose examined Monday to see if it's broken. 
"They play hard: we go hard," said Artest, who also finished with six steals and four assists. "We just had to keep going to the basket. 
"I didn't play the best, but we won." 
Miami committed five fouls in the first eight minutes, while the Pacers made their first seven shots from the foul line and fin­ished 34-for-43 for the game. The Heat committed 11 turnovers in the first half, which the Pacers quickly converted into 15 points. 
"The fact that they're the most physical defensive team in the league and never foul, that's a helluva team," Miami coach Stan Van Gundy said. "It wasn't me being upset about the fouls called on us. I just thought we were attacking pretty darned good, too. 
"We'll have to look (at the film). Their technique must be great because they lean on you and never foul." 
Indiana, which shot 43 percent from the field and 67 percent from 3-point range in the first half. led 50-40 at halftime after leading by as many as 16 points. But the Heat opened the third quarter on a 9-4 run to pull within 54-51 with 6:57 left and held the Pacers to 27 percent shooting in the second half. Celtlcs 89, 76ers 65 
Philadelphia coach Chris Ford urged his players to keep shoot­ing, and they kept missing. 
But by the time the 76ers hit the target consistently, they were too far back and lost to the Boston Celtics while setting fran­chise records for offensive futili­ty. 
"Every timeout I just kept encouraging them, 'the next one is going to go,"' Ford said. "You can't be hesitant and not take the open shots." 
They had plenty of shots but missed 65. Boston took only 77. 
"They looked a little tired," Boston coach John Carroll said. "They missed some good shots early and I think it just kind of fed into what was going on." 
Playing for the fifth straight game without injured Allen Iverson, the 76ers set club records for fewest points in a half {23) and in three quarters (41). The 76ers sank nine of 19 shots in the fourth quarter after hitting 15 of 70 before then. They finished at 24-for-89, or 27 percent. 
"When you fall so far behind you have to do things differently to break it up," Aaron McKie said. "We didn't figure things out until it was too late." 
The Celtics, who moved a half game ahead of Cleveland into eighth place in the Eastern Conference, were led by Mark Blount, Ricky Davis and Jiri Welsch with 13 points each. For Philadelphia, Kenny Thomas had 18 and Kyle Korver 15. 
"We ,missed a lot of wide open shots," Korver said. "Unfortunately, it had to happen tonight {with) as big a game as this is." 
The 76ers dropped 2 1/2 games behind Boston in the race for the final playoff spot. · 
For the second straight game, the Celtics faced a team without two of its best players. They beat New Jersey on Friday night when Jason Kidd and Kenyon

Matsui homers for Yankees in return to Japan

Associated Press 
TOKYO -Over and over, Hideki Matsui kept saying this was just another night. But, of course, it wasn't. It was his first game back in Japan since leav­ing after the 2002 season. 
And when he deposited a hanging curveball into the right­center field seats in the second inning Sunday, the enormously popular player they call Godzilla couldn't reign in his emotions. He cracked a wide smile after he crossed the plate and returned to the New York Yankees' dugout. 
Matsui homered in his first at­bat back in Japan, starting an evening when the Yankees showed why they're called the Bronx Bombers back home. 
Jorge Posada added a tiebreaking three-run homer and Derek Jeter hit a solo shot, leading the Yankees over the Yomiuri Giants 6-2 in New York's first game in Japan in 49 years. 
And after it was over, Matsui walked to a microphone at home plate and addressed the admirers who were so sad to see him depart Yomiuri 15 months ago to sign with the Yankees. 
"What I did out there was to show my deepest appreciation for the fans," he explained later through a translator. "Most importantly, however, at the same time I didn't feel melan­choly about it. I didn't have any special attachment toward it, looking back at my Yomiuri Giants days. No, that didn't hap­pen. I just wanted to show them my gratitude." 
He wants to behave like a "Star Trek" Vulcan, be robotlike and emotionless, focusing deeply on the tasks at hand. Yankees manager Joe Torre calls it "ice water." 
"He knows how to rise to the occasion. I really feel that way," Torre said.

While Matsui plays left field

stantly, with Yomiuri he received

batting order. That's where he 
played on Sunday night, the 
next-to-last exhibition for New 
York before Tuesday's opener 
against Tampa Bay. 
"You're allowed to be bigger than the game tonight," Torre told him. 
Matsui already had a clue, thanks to Kenny Lofton, who gave him the heads-up during batting practice. Ever the per­fectionist, Matsui shagged fly balls in center field. 
"I hadn't played center field in some time now," Matsui said. "I needed to practice, I needed ~ get a feel for the position again." 
With flashbulbs popping and small orange flags with his num­ber "55" waving, Matsui stepped into the batter's box leading off the second inning to cheers of "Go Matsui!" Then, just after he fouled off a 2-2 pitch, the chant changed to, "Home run, home run, Matsui." 
In the dugout, Torre said: "Wouldn't this be something if he hits a home run here?" 
Matsui sure did, on the very next pitch. He took a 63 mph hanging curveball from Hisanori Takahashi, leaned into it and sent it about three-quarterS' of the way up the bleachers in right-center field.

Duke, Georgia Tech earn Final Four bids 
ASsociated Press 

ATlANTA -Too much history. Too much Duke. 
The Blue Devils ended Xavier's remarkable run in the NCAA tourna­ment and headed to their 14th Final Four, holding off the Musketeers 66­63 Sunday to win the Atlanta Regional. 
Xavier (26-11) had already chopped down the second-and third-seeded teams in the region, but couldn't make it 1-2-3 against Duke (31-5). The Blue Devils will be the only No. 1 seed in San Antonio, advancing to meet Connecticut next Saturday in the national semifinals. 
The seventh-seeded Musketeers had never been this far in the tour­ney, and it showed in the closing min­utes against postseason-hardened Duke. 
With the score tied at 56, Chris Duhon drove to the basket and missed, but Luol Deng grabbed the offensive rebound and passed out to 
J.J. Redick, who swished the 3-point­er that put the Blue Devils ahead for good with 2:5 5 remaining. 
Xavier couldn't overcome the loss of Anthony Myles, its best inside play­er, who fouled out with 12 1/2 min­utes remaining after scoring 16 points and grabbing 10 rebounds. His absence was especially telling at the end. 
After Redick's trey, 6-foot-1 Dedrick Finn drove the lane, only to have his shot swatted away by 6-9 Shelden Williams. Duhon sped the other way and missed again, but Deng tapped in the rebound to give the Blue Devils a five-point lead with 1:55 to go. 
Justin Doellman finally scored for the Musketeers, their first basket in nearly 4 1/2 minutes, but Duke closed it out at the free throw line. Redick hit a pair. So did Duhon, the only prominent holdover from Duke's last national championship team in 2001. 
The Blue Devils lost the last two years in the regional semifinals. They didn't slip up this time. 
Deng had 19 points and was named the MVP of the regional. Williams also came up big, scoring 12 points to go along with 13 rebounds. 
Lionel Chalmers led Xavier with 17 points.

IN BRIEF 

Adam Scott wins Player's

Chamionship 
PONTE VEDRA BEACH. Fla. ­The guy who swings like Tiger Woods nearly finished like Greg Norman. 
Ultimately, all that mattered to Adam Scott on Sunday was making a 10-foot bogey putt on the final hole to win The Players Championship, making the 23-year­old Australian the youngest cham­pion of golf's richest tournament. 
Scott turned a command perform­ance into a comedy on the treach­erous 18th hole at Sawgrass. From the middle of the fairway, with a two-shot lead, he pulled his approach into the water and looked as if he had thrown it all away. 
Needing to make bogey to avoid a playoff with Padraig Harrington, Scott finished with a putt that was true from the time it left his blade. Scott thrust his fist into the air twice, and threw his cap down in relief. 
together to pile into a group hug on the floor. 
How fitting. 
With top scorer B.J. Elder hobbled by a badly sprained ankle, someone else had to step up. Jarrett Jack and the rest of the Yellow Jackets did bet­ter than that, beating Kansa.S in over­time to advance to their first Final Four since 1990. 
"A lot was on the line," said Jack, who scored eight of his career-high 29 points in overtime. "B.J. being out, we all knew we had to step up. I just really got it going and kept attacking until the game was over." 
No team had more tight games on its road to the Final Four than the third-seeded Yellow Jackets. Their first three games in the St. Louis Regional were decided by a total of 
He closed with a 2-under 70, win­ning $1.44 million from the record $8 million purse. 

Angels' pitcher hospitalized 
Anaheim Angels reliever Brendan Donnelly has been hospitalized because of severe nosebleeds while recovering from being hit in the face by a fly ball. 
' Donnelly returned to a Scottsdale hospital late Saturday nnd under­went a third surgery on his frac­tured nose, which was broken in 20 places on March 9 while he shagged flies during batting prac­tice. "They told me I lost half the blood in my body," Donnelly said Saturday, adding that he'd lost seven pints of blood. "I didn't real­ize how serious it was." Said Angels shortstop David Eckstein: "We're concerned with his safety. It's dangerous to lose that much blood." Donnelly will start the season on 
13 points. 
But Georgia Tech (27-9) has been unflappable all season, beating Connecticut when the Huskies were ranked No. 1 and winning at Duke and Wake Forest. So facing the favored Jayhawks, even without Elder, was no big deal. Even when the game went to overtime. 
After little Will Bynum hit a big 3­pointer to break a 71-all tie, Jack went 4-for-4 from the line in the last 4 7 seconds to seal the win. 
Jack finished 8-of-12 from the floor, and had nine rebounds and six assists. Luke Schenscher added 15 points and Clarence Moore matched his season high with 14 for the Yellow Jackets. As the final seconds ticked off the clock, coach Paul Hewitt threw his hands in the air in triuph. 
the disabled list, the team said Sunday. He will remain in the hos­pital three or four days. 
O'Neil returns to Pacers' 

lineup 
INDIANAPOLIS -Jermaine O'Neal returned to the Indiana Pacers starting lineup Sunday after missing the past two games with a bruised left knee. 
O'Neal is averaging a team-lead­ing 20.3 points, 10.1 rebounds and 
2.65 blocks a game for the Pacers (53-19), who were playing Miami (35-37). 
The All-Star forward injured his knee in win over the Chicago Bulls last Monday. He collided with Bulls guard Ronald Dupree while trying to set a pick on the baseline and immediately crumpled to the floor. 
AI Harrington, who is averaging a career-best 13.1 points and 6.4 rebounds, had started in place of O'Neal. The Pacers are 4-0 this sea­son without O'Neal.

Federer knocked off by Spanish teenager 
Associated Press 
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. ­Under siege from a 17-year­old Spaniard, Roger Federer waited for his opponent to show some nerves and make a few mistakes. 
It never happened. Rafael Nadal coolly closed out the biggest victory of his young life Sunday night by beating the top-ranked Federer 6-3, 6-3 in the third round of the Nasdaq-100 Open. 
Federer, the reigning Wimbledon and Australian Open champion, lost for only the second time in 25 match­es this year. The loss was an upset but no fluke: Nadal has been touted as a future top­10 player and showed shot­making skills worthy of the hype. 
The big-swinging left-ban­der from Mallorca won 36 of 48 points on his serve and never faced a break point. He hit winners from both sides, won 13 points at the net and closed out one game with a crosscourt drop shot that brought a roar from the crowd. 
The youngest player in the 96-man field, Nadal improved to 3-1 against top 10 opponents. He also has beaten Carlos Moya and Albert Costa. 
In women's play, top-seed­ed Serena Williams cleared another hurdle in her come­back from an eight-month layoff by beating Elena Likhovtseva 6-1. 4-6, 6-3. 
Williams was playing for just the second time since undergoing knee surgery last August, and she survived some shaky moments and erratic groundstrokes. She won the first five games but committed 34 unforced errors -plus several foot faults -and needed five match points to secure the victory. 
"I never felt as if I was going to lose," Williams said. "I just felt ... when was I going to win?" 
Her path to the final became easier when fourth­seeded Jennifer Capriati lost to No. 25 Eleni Daniilidou, 6­2, 6-4. 
"From the beginning I missed some easy shots, and I got negative after that," Capriati said. 
She was the runner-up in Key Biscayne each of the past three years, losing in the final to a Williams each time: Serena in 2002 and 2003, and Venus in 2001. 
Williams' next opponent will be 16-year-old Russian Maria Sharapova, who beat No. 13 Anna Smashnova­Pistolesi 7-5, 6-2. 
Three-time champion Venus Williams struggled early but played a flawless tiebreaker and beat No. 27 Danie-la Hantuchova 7-6 (0), 6-2. Williams, seeded second in the tournament, could meet her younger sister in the final Saturday. 
Also reaching the fourth round were lucky loser Gisela Dulko of Argentina and Jill Craybas of the United States, who upset No. 7 Vera Zvonareva 6-2, 3-6, 6-3. 
In other men's play, former No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt lost to Andrei Pavel 6-4, 7-5. Hewitt had 10 double-faults, includ­ing three in the final game. 
Todd Martin advanced, but fellow American Robby Ginepri was eliminated by Nicolas Kiefer 7-6 (3}, 3-6, 6­4.

Devils edge out Islanders 3-2 
Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. ­
The New Jersey Devils nar­
rowed their focus and took a 
step toward catching the 
Atlantic Division-leading 
Philadelphia Flyers. 
"We just have to win these 
final hockey games," said Scott 
Gomez who assisted on all three 
goals Sunday night in the 
Devils' 3-2 win over the New 
York Islanders. "We're not wor­
rying about Philly. To be honest, 
I think that's what got us in 
trouble in the past. We got three 
games left and then the real 
dance starts, so we want to be 
going at full steam." 
Patrik Elias had a goal anct' 
two assists, and Scott 
Niedermayer and Brian Gionta 
also scored for the Devils who 
moved within two points of the 
Flyers. Martin ~rodeur made 12 
saves to post his 36th win. 
"We've got three games and 
we just have to keep winning," 
Elias said. "We'll know soon 
how it turns out." 
Dave Scatchard and Mark 
Parrish scored for New York, 
which dropped its second 
straight game during the week­
end. The Islanders failed to 
reduce their magic number of 
four points needed to clinch the 
Eastern Conference's final play­
off spot over Buffalo. 
"You don't want to be looking over your shoulder," Parrish said. "You want to be looking ahead to the playoffs. At this point in the season, you can't help but look at the standings and who's behind you and who's in front of you." 
Niedermayer opened the scor­ing at 6:26 as Elias and Islanders forward Mattias Weinhandl bumped into New York goaltender Rick DiPietro. That left Niedermayer with a wide-open net and marked the second straight game DiPietro was victimized that way on the first goal. He was down on the ice when Allan Roarke gave the Hurricanes the early lead Saturday in Carolina's 3-2 victo­ry. 
The Islanders, outplayed most of the first period, pulled even when Scatchard beat Brodeur from the right boards for a short-handed goal with 38.2 seconds remaining. 
Elias and Gionta scored in the second period to give the Devils a 3-1lead. 
Elias scored on a backhander at 5:13. A video replay con­firmed that the puck trickled over the goal line before DiPietro could clamp a pad on it. 
Gionta deflected Gomez's shot in with 2:07 remaining. 
Parrish wasted little time in the third, deflecting Kenny Jonsson's point shot past Brodeur 43 seconds in, cutting the Devils' lead to 3-2. 
New Jersey allowed only three more shots the rest of the way. 
"We had a tough weekend," Islanders coach Steve Stirling said. "We played hard tonight but you can't fall behind with a third goal at the end of the sec­ond period. We had a huge mountain to climb." Blues 3, Blackhawks 1 
The St. Louis Blues' five-on­three power-play unit is work­ing just fine. 
Keith Tkachuk, Petr Cajanek and Brian Savage each had goals while St. Louis had a two­man advantage in the first peri­od, leading the Blues to a victo-threes, the odds are you're going to score," Savage said. "We've got a lot of snipers on this team. We moved the puck around well. We got a lot of shots from the slot."

St. Louis remained in seventh place in the Western Conference, two points ahead of Nashville and Edmonton, which played Phoenix later Sunday. 
Doug Weight and Scott Mellanby had two assists for St. Louis, which also beat the Blackhawks on Saturday at home. 
Chicago drew six consecutive penalties in the first period, giv­ing the Blues 10:48 of power­play time. St. Louis had a man­advantage for 7:26 straight ­including 3:25 when they skated five-on-three. 
Chicago coach Brian Sutter didn't think his team deserved all the penalties. 
"The referees had a determin­ing factor in the outcome of the game. We play good in physical games," Sutter said. "It's frus­trating to our players when other people are involved in the outcome of the game besides the people who are playing it." 
The Blues took exception to the five stick-related fouls the Blackhawks committed in the period. 
"It happens when you take stick infractions," Tkachuk said. 
Down 3-1 after one period, Chicago came out firing in the second period, with Scott Thornton scoring at 1:52. 
The Blackhawks outshot the Blues 18-5 in the second period and 13-5 in the third. 
"You sit back and that is what is going to happen," Blues defenseman Chris Pronger said. "You give them confidence. We should be trying to finish them." 
Tkachuk capitalized 11 sec­onds into the first two-man advantage, taking a pass in the slot from Doug Weight and lift­ing a shot above the left arm of goalie Adam Munro. 
Cajanek made it 2-0 at 10:05. Brian Savage fanned on a shot from the slot, and Cajanek gained control of the puck at the side of the net and scored. 
"It was another whiff," Savage said. "I got 'the second one, though." 
Wild 2, Mighty Ducks 1 
Though Marian Gaborik's sea­son will still be considered a disappointment, he's trying hard to finish strong. 
Gaborik netted the go-ahead goal in the third period against Minnesota nemesis Jean­Sebastien Giguere, giving the Wild a victory over the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. 
Dwayne Roloson made 18 saves, and rookie Rickard Wallin had a goal for Minnesota, which scored on Giguere for just the fourth time in eight games -including last year's Western Conference finals. 
··obviously we have been hav­ing a lot of trouble to score against him," Gaborik said. "It was good to get a couple goals." 
Good for Gaborik, especially, who shares the team goal lead with Alexandre Daigle with 16. An All-Star last year who was the third-highest scorer in the NHL playoffs. Gaborik missed the first 12 games of this season during a contract dispute. He has been off his game for much of the time since. 
"He's feeling much better," coach Jacques Lemaire said. "He's just starting to feel good about himself and feel confi­dent." 
Niclas Havelid scored for the Mighty Ducks, whose recent dominance of the Wild ended. Anaheim followed its four-game sweep in last year's playoffs by going 2-0-1 in the first three games this season. 
"That's been the story of the season, losing close ones," cap­tain Steve Rucchin said. "That's what happens when you refuse to work .... When you don't come prepared on a nightly basis, it's tough. The guys on the ice haven't gotten the job done. It's no one's fault except ourselves." 
After their improbable meet­ing in last year's playoffs, both the Wild and Mighty Ducks have fallen hard. They enter the final week of the regular season with nothing on the line other than draft position and auditions for future playing time.

To say that the Irish are off to a good start would be an understatement. 
Improving its season mark to a perfect 7-0 (2-0 in Big East) and stretching its overall win streak to a school record 11 games, No. 3 Notre Dame knocked off a pair of Big East rivals over the weekend, defeating Virginia Tech (3-3) Friday before thumping Boston College (4-3) Sunday. 
While several individual players have stood out thus far this season -attaclumiddle Meredith Simon, attack Abby Owen arid goalkeeper Carol Dixon were all recognized as Big East Player of the Week at one point -Irish coach Tracy Coyne points to true teamwork with a touch senior leadership as the ingredient of the squad's success. 
"We're really a team," Coyne said. "Different people are stepping up at different points to make things happen. The seniors have a lot of pride and determination, they're focused and they've done a great job leading the team." 
That teamwork was on dis­play once again Friday after­noon.

Notre Dame's second varsity four boat of coxswain Caitlin Rackish, Kristen Hinkel, Meredith Thornburgh, Alyssa Close and Colleen Larson fin­ished in third with a 7:36.9 finish, behind Michigan's win­ning time of 7:17.3 and Michigan State's second place time of7:23.7. 
The Irish varsity eight boat also had a stellar perform­ance, as the Wolverines nar­rowly beat them. Though Notre Dame's coxswain Maureen Gibbons, Natalie Ladine, Alice Bartek, Meghan Boyle, Rachel Polinski, Melissa Felker, Katie Chenoweth, Danielle Protasewich and Jacqueline Hazen secured a lead 1,000 meters in to the race, Michigan's boat had a strong finish. 
Notre Dame crossed the fin­ish line in 6:25.0, less than five seconds behind Michigan. Clemson took third in 6:34.3, while Eastern Michigan fin­ished in 6:40.2. 

In the second varsity eight race, Michigan won in 6:35.0, and with a time of 6:48.0, Clemson took second. Coxswain Kacy McCaffrey Jessica Guzik, Kathleen Welsh, Kati Sedun, Jenna Redgate, Elizabeth Specht, Andrea Doud, Ashley St. Pierre and Megan Sanders led Notre Dame to third place in 6:49.7. 
In the third varsity four race, Notre Dame raced two boats. The Irish 'A' crew of coxswain Shannon Lettieri. Sarah Keefer, Ann Mulligan, Courtney Quinn and Tricia David had a second place fin­ish in 7:39.8, behind the Wolverines who won in 7:30.0. The Spartans took third, and the novice 'B' crew of coxswain Maria Romano, Audrey deGuire, Alice Cooper, Samantha Glass and Kaitlin Sharkey finished fourth in 7:52.1. 
Though the races were diffi­cult this weekend, the Irish have confidence that they will continue to be strong oppo­nents. 
"The competition was very tough, but we showed that our team can race well with some of the best in the country," Long said. "Our determination to prove ourselves helped lead us to victory. We will continue to work hard and develop."

Hot Irish remain undefeated 
Attack Jackie Bowers netted a career-high five goals and four other Irish players recorded at least a pair of scores as Notre Dame finally put away a pesky Virginia Tech squad with a 5-0 second-half run en route to an 18-11 victo­ry. 
Falling behind 25 seconds into the contest, the Irish post­ed the next four goals for a 4-1 lead a little over four minutes into the game. While the Hokies managed to answer back with a pair of their own, pulling within one at 4-3 with 
22:35 remaining in the first half, the Irish netted four of the next five goals to head into the half with an 8-4 advan­tage. 
Virginia Tech once again struck first to open the second half as the Hokies' Kate Threadgold picked up her third goal of the afternoon to bring Virginia Tech within a trio of tallies. 
Three goals would prove to be as close as the Hokies would get, however. The Irish scored each of the game's next five goals to build a 13-5 lead and secure their sixth victory of the season. 
In addition to Bowers' five goals, Simon picked up four tallies and Owen had three goals, while both attack Lauren Fischer and middle/attack Crysti Foote net­ted a pair of their own. 
Sunday, the Irish rode three separate five-goal runs to a 17-7 throttling of the Eagles. 
After jumping out to a 5-0 lead behind a pair of goals from both Owen and Foote and a tally from Fischer with 23:46 left in the first half, the Irish yielded a pair of Eagles scores before rallying for yet another five-goal streak to build a 10-3 halftime lead and effectively seal the contest. 
The barrage continued in the second half as Notre Dame rat­tled off seven of the contest's next eight goals to take a 17-4 advantage with 12:32 left. 
Simon and Owen continued their season-long dominance as Simon found the back of the net on four occasions for the second time in three days and Owen recorded two goals and an assist. 
In addition, Foote scored four goals and Fischer picked up a score and three assists in the victory. 

MEN'S TENNIS 
Keckley helps seal victory at Ball State

Talent. Poise. Youth. 

No, it's not the Miss Teen USA pageant, it's the bottom of the men's tennis lineup. Three fresh­men and a sophomore came through for the Irish Saturday, rallying from a defeat in doubles and the sickness of two top play­ers to win the match 4-3 against Ball State. 
"A lot of credit goes to a lot of young guys today," Irish coach Bobby Bayliss said. 
The underclassmen have added depth to an experienced Irish lineup and have con­tributed to the 12-7 record of the team. 
"Ryan Keckley clinched the match and deserves an awful lot of credit," Bayliss said of the freshman, who plays at No'. 5 singles. "He really played well under pressure." 
The Irish dropped the initial point of the match, with only ail­ing Luis Haddock and Matthew Scott able to claim victory at No. 2. 
"We did not play a very good doubles point," Bayliss said. "I wasn't very excited about our level. ... I felt we could win the doubles point and I still think we probably should have." 
Scott was forced to remove himself from the singles lineup after the doubles matches. Haddock, ranked 80th in the nation, played but was visibly under the weather. 
"He really sort of faded after the second set," Bayliss said. "That was disappointing for him, I'm sure, but he gave us a great effort." 
Brent D'Amico moved to the No. 2 spot, but lost in two close sets. 
Luckily, the bottom of the Irish lineup was a solid foundation for the victory. 
Bayliss was full of praise for 
Steven Bass, normally a No. 4 
player who has seen consider­
able time at No. 3. Against the 
Cardinals, he won 6-1. 6-1 at 
that position. 
"Steven Bass played unbeliev­
ably well in singles," Bayliss 
said. 
Bass is on a hot streak, win­
ning 10 of his last 12 matches 
and improving to 14-4 in the 
dual-match season. lie is 20-6 
overall in his first season at 
Notre Dame. 
"He has a hard time normally 
finishing someone off early, and 
he did a great job with Patrick 
Thompson, who usually plays 
No. 2," Bayliss said. 
Barry King and Eric 
Langenkamp won in straight sets 
at No. 4 and No. 6. respectively. 
"What is probably good to sec 
is the ability to rally while we're 
down a point," Bayliss said.

Irish capture Hoosier Classic with 3 wins at IU 
By HEATHER 
VAN HOEGARDEN 
Sports Editor 
When Irish coach Deanna Gumpf and Western Kentucky coach Leslie Phelan decided not to play the championship game of the Hoosier Classic, no one was too upset. 
"We were definitely happy to come home," Irish left fielder Nicole deFau said. 
Notre Dame (23-9) came home after winning the Hoosier Classic because they beat Western Kentucky (21-8) earlier Sunday morning. 
The tournament started Saturday morning when the Irish faced off against Saint Louis (9-21). Notre Dame was led by Meagan Ruthrauff who hit her sixth home run of the year, a three-run bomb to put the Irish ahead 3-0 in the fifth. She drove in Stephanie Brown, who singled to leftfield, and deFau, who was hit by a pitch. 
After the Billikens tied it up, Liz l{artmann hit a solo homer in the sixth to put the Irish ahead for good 4-3. 
Pitcher Steffany Stenglein earned the win for Notre Dame, her fourth in a row and eighth of the season. She gave up just three hits, while strik­ing out eight. But it was a team effort for the Irish. 
"We did a good job hitting the ball," deFau said. "Our pitchers really did a good job shutting the teams down." 
Later Saturday, Notre Dame went head-to-head with the tournament host, Indiana (17­17). 
Heather Booth, who pitched the Irish to a win, led the Irish in the contest. She gave up just two hits, and despite only striking out one, allowed no runs. The Irish defense sup­ported her the entire game.

Saturday to open the flood­
gates. The combination of a

efforts from the start. 
"I said that there could be ups and downs, and we were in down," Bednarski said. "With a young team, with emotions, with pressure, it happens, and unfortunately it was really hard to stop it." 
By the end of the day, Ohio State broke away from the pack to hold a comfortable 159-132 lead over Notre Dame. With just three round-.robin rotations left for the men, the only issue that remained in doubt was which team would fmish second. 
The Irish, with one short of the maximum 12 participants, could not compensate for the loss of top foilist Derek Snyder to injury. Snyder broke his hand last week in practice and did not fence in the national cham­pionships. Frankie Bontempo, who replaced Snyder as an alternate, finished the tourna­ment with a disappointing 7-16 record. 
Bednarski knew his team would be fighting an uphill bat­tle from the start. 
"It's very hard with one less fencer and the replacement of Derek Snyder," he said, " but [the result] is not what we real­ly wanted."

The freshman sabre duo of Patrick Ghattas and Matthew Stearns, who combined for a sparkling 71-13 record during the regular season, could only muster an even 23-23 record over the weekend. Ghattas failed to post a victory (0-4) against either Ohio State or Penn State. 
"I've never fenced a competi­tion like this where it's just one big round of pools," Ghattas said. "I've never had so many difficult bouts back-to-hack-to­hack. I'm taking it as a learning experience." 
The one youthful exception on the women's side was fresh­man sabre Valerie Providenza who finished with an 18-5 record in the round-robin event and won the individual national title. . 
However, like Ghattas and Stearns, fellow freshman saber Angela Vincent did not fare as well. Vincent, noticeably tired and still feeling the effects of an illness that hospitalized her two 
rings. Ohio State had best bask in its glory this year, because the fencing spotlight will shift back to South Bend starting as early as next year. 
Of the 11 competitors the Iris·h brought to Waltham, Mass., for the national title meet, they will lose only one to graduation-fifth-year senior Forest Walton. His spot will be taken by Derek Snyder -the strongest men's foilist who sat out the champi­onships with a broken hand. 
Headlining the returnees is the unstoppable "A-Team" of rising senior foilists Alicja Kryczalo and Andrea Ament. The only reason Ament did not win national titles this year and in 2002 was because Kryczalo beat her en route to an unheard-of three consecu­tive foil national champi­onships. 
National epee runner-up Kerry Walton will return for a fifth-year of eligibility. The explosive sabre quartet of Patrick Ghattas, Matt Stearns, Angela Vincent and national champion Valerie Providenza, . will only be sophomores. All · this, and letters-of-intent are yet to be signed. 
Granted, this year was diffi­cult. As perhaps the only group on campus that holds itself to a higher standard than the football team, it was painful to watch this year's fencing team struggle through the growing pains of trying to defend a national title with seven new faces. 
The entire year was a hap-weeks ago, finished the tourna­ment with a disappointing 8-15 mark. 

But Providenza was not the only one to claim individual accolades. 
Alicja Kryczalo won the foil national title for the third time in as many years, making her only the second woman ever to win three or more national titles. She defeated teammate Andrea Ament for the champi­onship. Kryczalo said it was a different experience, facing a teammate in competition. 
"We know each other very well because we are fencing each other every day in prac­tice," she said. "There's not so much competitiveness, so prob­ably we don't enjoy it so much." 
Also taking runner-up honors was epeeist Kerry Walton, who won the 2002 national champi­onship. 
Michal Sobieraj, the 2003 runner-up, was the only men's fencer to medal. taking a third place bronze.

tism by fire. Many of the freshmen did not have the advantage of easing their way in where they could hide their mistakes behind older, more experienced fencers. Ghattas and Stearns were number and two respectively on the sabre depth chart, without the benefit of having a senior advisor like Destanie Milo was to Providenza and Vincent. 
But whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger. And since there hasn'tt been any tragic, untimely casualties during the season, it's a safe bet to say the fencing commu­nity is seeing only the tip of the iceberg of what this team can do. 
The freshmen need to remember what this past weekend felt like. They need to remember the pain of watching another team cele­brate a national title. They need to look up and see the bright No. 1 now missing from the night sky. They are now the seasoned veterans, and no one is going to hold their weapon for them. 
But if they learn from this, the Irish can plan on putting down their weapons, because their hands will be occupied holding a team national championship trophy instead.

ND TRACK AND FIELD 
Irish perform strong at weekend meets 
By MIKE GILLOON Sports Writer 
Two separate meets yielded two strong performances as the Notre Dame track and field team competed in its first full weekend of outdoor competi­tion. 
Most of the distance runners and sprinters traveled to Palo Alto, Calif., to participate in the Stanford Invitational, while the remainder of the team stayed closer to home and took part in the Purdue Invite. 
Selim Nurudeen and Kristen Dodd set the pace for the Irish at Stanford as they were among eight team members to qualify for the Big East Championships. Nurudeen ran the 110-meter hurdl~s in 14.0 seconds to finish in fifth place. His time also qualified him for the NCAA regional meet later in the season. Dodd ran a 12.14-second 100-meter dash to finish in 1Oth place. Her teammate Ayesha Boyd fin­ished just behind Dodd with a time of 12.35. 
With his time of 22.01 in the 200-meter dash, Ryan Postel finished seventh in his section. Postel's sprinter teammate Trevor McClain-Duer finished in second place in his section of the 400-meter dash in a time of 48.21. 
In the women's 400-meter hurdles, Tiffany Gunn was suc­cessful as she took fifth place overall with a time of 1:52. 
The other Big East qualifiers from the Stanford Invitational were Jean Marinangeli, Sean O'Donnell and Kaleb Van Ort. Marinangeli took 29th place in the women's 10,000 meters in 
36:14.66 while Van Ort placed 
33rd in the men's 10,000 Contact Mike Gilloon at meters with a time of mgilloon@nd.edu.

29:40.85. O'Donnell was a 13th place finisher in the 5,000 meters, as he posted a time of 14:25.66. 
The Irish athletes who par­ticipated in the Purdue Invite had a successful weekend as those at Stanford with 24 top­S finishes in the meet. Nine participants qualified ·for the Big East Championships. 
The Irish were led by first­place finishers in Mark Barber, Derek Goquen and Petra Dankova. Barber won the 400­meter hurdles in 53.38 while his teammate Roberto Garcia finished a close third in 55.58. Dankova triple-jumped a dis­tance of 12.02 meters while Goquen tossed the javelin 
59.01 meters. The men's 400­meter relay team, led by Barber, ran a first place time of 42.59. 

A handful of Irish field ath­letes qualified for the Big East Championships with discus .j ! and weight throwers Chip :~ ii Roberts and Juan Alba leading .. the way. Alba placed second in the discus event as well as sixth in the hammer throw, while Roberts finished third in the discus and seventh in the hammer throw. Jason Davis also qualified for the confer­ence meet in the hammer throw with a toss of 49.00 meters. 
The final Irish athletes to qualify for the Big East Championships were Ryan Johns, Jennifer Kearney and Megan Horn. Johns finished third in the men's 3000-meter steeplechase, while Kearney took second in the women's high jump. Horn qualified in two events, as she placed third and 11th in the discus and hammer throw, respectively.

tending in net. Irish goalie Morgan Cey tied a career high with 40 saves in the loss, while his Minnesota counter­part Kellen Briggs needed to make only 20 saves. 
"They're definitely a little deeper team than we were," Cey said. "We tried to weath­er the storm there for a while, but we still gave them all they could handle, and I think we're going to be a bet­ter team for it, next year." 
Minnesota's stay in the NCAA tournament only lasted one more game, though, as the Gophers lost to Minnesota-Duluth 3-1 Sunday for the chance to go to the Frozen Four in Boston. Minnesota-Duluth defeated Michigan State 5-0 in the game following Notre Dame­Minnesota Saturday. 
The Irish finish their season with a 20-15-4 overall record, for a .571 winning percentage and the best record yet under Poulin, who has coached the team for nine seasons. 
Notre Dame's seniors played an especially key role in the team's success this season, and the loss in the first round was a bittersweet pill for the upperclassmen to swallow. 
"I think this team has really improved tremendously since when the other seniors and I came as freshmen," captain Aaron Gill said. "One goal of this senior class was that we wanted to put the Notre Dame hockey name out there and on the map. 
"This school's not really known for its hockey, and we've had a bit of success the past few years, so hopefully the younger guys will help take this program even fur­ther in the future."

board early Saturday, as less than a minute into the first period the Irish took advan­tage of a 2-on-1 opportunity on Minnesota goalie Kellen Briggs. Gill took the puck up the left side of the ice and made a perfect feed to Cory McLean, who was left alone in the slot to fire a low wrister past Briggs. 
The Irish increased their lead to two just before the end of the first period, scor­ing on the power play with just 41 seconds left in the set. Notre Dame took a hard shot from the right point, and Briggs gave up a rebound to the middle of the ice. Several players went for the puck, but it was Gill who eventually deflected it past Briggs, who was down on the ice. 
Minnesota didn't waste any­time coming back, scoring just 26 seconds into the sec­ond period to cut the Irish lead in half. Matt Koalska skated down the right side of the ice, past several Notre Dame defenders, and made a quick cut back to the middle to flip the puck past Cey. 
The Golden Gophers then used their power play, which has connected at a 26.2 per­cent clip so far this season, to tie the game at 9:13 of the period. Chris Harrington shot the puck from the blue line, and it deflected off Danny Irmen, who was perched at the left side of the net. 
With less than five minutes left in the period and the teams skating four-on-four, Notre Dame almost managed to get the lead back. Matt Amado broke in alone on Briggs, but the Minnesota goalie stopped the breakaway attempt, and Michael Bartlett shot the rebound high over the net. 
Immediately after that good Irish scoring chance, Thomas Vanek took advantage of slop­PY play in the Irish defensive zone. Two Notre Dame defenders collided with each other, and Vanek swooped in and was able to poke the puck between Cey's pads. 
"I thought there were a cou­ple significant turning points in the game," Poulin said. "At 2-2, I felt that we were in pretty good shape. Then, Matt Amado gets a breakaway and then there's a scramble play in our own end and Vanek is able to put it home. 
"That was potentially a two­goal swing." 
The Golden Gophers scored an insurance goal in the third period, as Vanek beat Cey with a wraparound goal just inside the left post at 11:52 of the period. 
Troy Riddle iced the game with an empty net goal with 35 seconds remaining, after Notre Dame had pulled Cey out of the net for an extra attacker.

2004 Irish reset bar for future ND programs 
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.­Looking at Notre Dame coach Dave Poulin's face after his team's 5-2 loss against Minnesota Saturday in the first round ofthe NCAA Champion­ships, you didn't see regret or worry on his face. 
Even though the Irish are losing five seniors who played key roles on the team this season, you could almost imagine that Poulin was hum­ming Frank Sinatra's "The Best is Yet to Come" in the back of his mind. 
"Obviously we've got a great senior class this year, and we had three very good defense­men in Neil Komadoski, Brett Lebda and Tom Galvin," he said. "But I think we're also bringing three good ones in [as freshmen] next year. 
"But you don't look at fresh­men to replace seniors. We also need our underclassmen to step up for us next year. Some of our guys in-house are going to have to play a bigger role next year." 
Several members of Notre Dame's incoming freshman class were recruited by other big-name programs such as Boston College and Michigan,

prospects in 
hopes of tak­ing Notre Dame's program to an even higher level. 
Last year, the Irish signed the No. 2 recruiting class in the country according to RedLine Report, an independ­ent scouting review out of Lake Placid, N.Y. 
Those freshmen played a pivotal role in Notre Dame's success this year, whether it was Wes O'Neill playing solid defense in his own end, or David Brown making an unbe­lievable kick save, or Jason Paige scoring a key goal at a key time. 
In fact, Poulin has only con­tinued a trend that has occurred all through his nine­year tenure with the team ­the ability to sign talented players who can contribute not only at the college level but in the professional ranks as well. 
Forward Ben Simon {1996­2000) and defenseman Mark Eaton (1997 -98) are currently on NHL rosters with Atlanta and Nashville, respectively. 
Senior forward Rob Globke made Irish history when he was selected in the second round of the 2002 NHL Entry Draft by the Florida Panthers. That record might be matched or bettered by this year's freshmen, particularly O'Neill, who was ranked No. 1 in the Central Scouting Midseason Draft Report among college

defensemen. 
Throw in the fact the Irish have arguably the best return­ing goaltending tandem in the NCAAs with current junior Morgan Cey and Brown, and the pieces are in place for Notre Dame to make another run at the NCAA's next year. 
Poulin was not the only coach who commented on the growth of Notre Dame's pro­gram at the press conference Saturday, however. Also mak­ing a statement was Minnesota coach Don Lucia, who was a teammate with Poulin while at Notre Dame. 
"Dave [Poulin] is a good friend, and he and his staff have done a great job with that program," Lucia said. "Now the one thing is that if they could get a facility, I think you'd really see the pro­gram take another step. I think that's the one improve­ment Notre Dame can make for that program. 
"It's good for college hockey to have a big name school in Notre Dame that makes it to the NCAA tournament, and hopefully they can get that facility and take that next big step." 
The Joyce Center was built almost 40 years ago, with the official dedication taking place during the week of Dec. 1-7. 1968. Hockey seems almost like an afterthought, with the Irish playing in a makeshift rink with temporary bleachers and lousy sightlines. 
With a rink 
that makes 
look at Notre 

Dame and decide that the school also sees hockey as an after­thought. 
Brand-new facilities at schools such as North Dakota and Ohio State have helped to bring those programs to new heights. Ralph Engelstad, who has made a fortune in the casino business, helped finance North Dakota's new arena, which opened in 2001 and includes an eight-screen video scoreboard, adjacent Olympic-sized practice rink and a padded leather seat for every spectator. 
The Irish certainly have the alumni and administration who could help finance a new arena -even if it's not one on such a grandiose scale as North Dakota's. There's little doubt that such a construction project could help Poulin and his staff bring in even more talented recruits that could eventually help Notre Dame match the depth and skill of the big-name programs today such as Minnesota. 
After all, it's hard to dis­count Lucia's opinion. The guy has won two consecutive national championships.

Irish fall just short in 55-49 Sweet 16 loss to No. 1 seed Penn State in regional semifinal

HARTFORD, Conn.-They played the defense, got the rebounds and played hard for 39 minutes, but when it came down to the last minute, the tank was empty and the Irish -green jerseys and all ­were going home. 
Despite a valiant effort, fifth­seeded Notre Dame (21-11) was unable to knock off top­see.ded Penn State (28-5) in a 55-49 loss in the NCAA Regional semifinal game. 
"I was really proud of our team," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "I thought we competed, I thought we bat­tled."

lt's time for Irish to move on after tough second round loss 
HARTFORD, Conn.-The "ifs, ands and buts" are meaningless now. 
No matter what could have happened in Notre Dame's regional semi­fmalgame against top­seeded Penn State, the Irish still lost 55-49, and their season is still over for good.

But instead Joe Hettler 

of dwelling on the fact the Sports Writer team had 
chances, the Irish must look for­ward, proud of the way they took one of the best all-around teams in the nation to the last minute and nearly pulled off the upset. 
Irish coach Muffet McGraw couldn't have asked for a better . scenario -the game tied with less than a minute left and the ball resting in the hands of Notre Dame's best player, forward Jacqueline Batteast. 
The Irish had worked their way through 39-plus grueling minutes of basketball to reach this pivotal point. Penn State's boisterous stu­dent section, which had harassed Notre Dame all afternoon, stood in concerned silence as Batteast took the ball and began her shot. 
But the shot wouldn't fall for Batteast, the Irish couldn't stop

Notre Dame falls to Minnesota 5-2 in first round of NCAA's 

By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. The Golden Gophers showed the Irish they still have a bit of growing up to do before they can compete with hockey's big boys in the NCAA champi­onships. 
The No. 4 seed Irish took an early 2-0 lead into the inter­mission of the first period, but could not stave off Minnesota's powerful offense in the next 40 minutes, eventually falling to the No. 1 seed Golden Gophers by a score of 5-2. 
''I'm proud of the way our guys played," Irish coach Dave Poulin said. "We played hard, but came up a little bit short, obviously. It's a great step for our program. 
"For the seniors, I appreci­ate the path that they have taken to get us here. For the underclassmen, it's a new level now that they have the chance to improve upon." 
The score might have been much worse if Notre Dame had not received great goal-

~. Kryczalo wins third consecutive national title in women's foil 
By MATT MOONEY Sports Writer 

WALTHAM, Mass. -The Notre Dame fencing team could hear the footsteps growing clos­er all season long. And at the NCAA Championships at

The upstart Ohio State 'i Buckeyes ran away with the 2004 national title, dethroning Allcja Kryczalo duals teammate Andrea Ament In the NCAA cham­the defending national champion pionship final for the foil. Kryczalo won her third national title. Irish Sunday with a total team 
score of 194 points. And in the end, the Irish were passed again, failing to hold off a late­charging Penn State team (160 points) to finish third overall with 153 points. St. John's fin­ished fourth, with a 149 score. 
Foilist Forest Walton, who hails from nearby Londonderry, 
N. H., said the third place result was not something the team expected. 
"We're all kind of surprised," he said. 
The four-day event did not go according to Notre Dame's plan. After the first day of competition Thursday, Irish coach Janusz B·ednarski wanted his fencers to extend their four-point lead to provide a cushion for the attri­tion-plagued men's team. But the women could not hold on to the lead, much less maintain it. The slim 63-59 lead the Irish held over Ohio State slowly evaporated throughout the day, and when the last point was scored Friday, the Irish trailed the Buckeyes by one, 97-96.
