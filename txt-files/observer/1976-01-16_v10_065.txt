Grocery store to close on the ~7th 

.by Mo Flynn Sentor Staff Reporter 

The A&P grocery store at the corner of Howard and Eddy streets will close Jan. 17, 1976 for economic reasons, according to a representative of the Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. 
Peter Koukas, president of the company's Midwestern District, told a group of South Bend citizens that presnt stoe sales are $30,000 per week and that the amount is 
insufficient to provide profits for A&P. Koukas added that stock shrinkage through pilferage is not the reason for closing the store. 
Koukas was consulted by members of the Grocery Store Task Force, organized by the Common Council of the City of South Bend. According to Council President Roger 0. Parent, the Task Force will work to have another grocery store operating at the Howard Street location no later than June 30, 1976. 
The grocery store provides a "vital service" to the people who live in the Northeast area, Parent said, and is a jamor strength in maintaining the neigh­borhood. Many Notre Dame students and faculty members are residents of the area. 
The Task Force has outlined the 
Wave paranoia strikes Aussies 
ADELAIDE, Australia (APJ 
South Australian workers are poised to desert their facto­ries and the state premier has appealed for calm following a part-timeclairvoyant's "mental flash" that an earthquake and tidal wave will hit Adelaide on Monday. 
"It appears a degree of hys­teria has been whipped up about some nonsensical prophe­cy that there will be an earth­quake and tidal wave on Mon­day," Premier Don Dunstan said in a radio broadcast sought by community leaders who feared a down under ver­sion of California's San An­dreas fault scares. 
"There is no basis for it at all," Dunstan said, adding that he will stand on a jetty at Gle­nelg Beach near Adelaide on Monday morning to show he has no fear of a tidal wave. 
Adelaide seismologist D. J. Sutton termed the prediction "poppycock." Adelaide suffers about 50 earth tremors every year but most are too weak for people to feel. 
Maj. Gen. Alan Stretton, chief of Australia's natural dis­aster organization, also is un­perturbed. He plans to be in Adelaide on Monday to address a Rotary Club meeting. 
But many residents are still planning to leave the state cap­ital of 800,000 or at least stay at home with their families on the supposed doomsday. 
Dunstan predicted such high absenteeism from work would force many businesses to close. 
Clairvoyant John Nash, a house painter by trade, said Nov. 3 that the vision came to him while he was gardening. He said he saw in his mind's eye a newspaper front page re­porting the disaster, complete with Monday's date. 
Nash has since fled 1,500 miles to western Australia "to a void the disaster." 
His prediction was first picked up by a chatty news­paper column and has gained more publicity ever since.

The final activity on Thursday will be a morning address, "American Aspirations and World Community." 
A discussion period will be held each day for the pros and cons of the addresses. 

on shooting: 
SAN FRANCISCO (APJ Sara Jane Moore, onetime FBI informant with radical con­nections, today became the sec­ond woman in a month to be sentenced to life in prison for attempting to kill President Ford. 
Before she was sentenced by 
U.S. Disrict Court Judge Sam­uel Conti, Miss Moore read a lengthy statement detailing her political beliefs and what she said led her to fire a shot at President Ford on Sept. 22. 
She said she was not sorry for trying to shoot the Presi­dent, except that she "accom­plished little than to throw away the rest of my life .. . I tried because it expressed my feelings at the time and could have triggered the kind of chaos to bring the upheaval of needed change." 
She described how she had become involved with the peace movement, the Black Panther party and other activist groups that forced her "to face the 

raw  reality of the  things  I had  
spoken  of  before."  
She  said  her  involvement  

with these groups helped her to become sympathetic to "those who found their only recourse in violence." 
After the sentencing, there was a loud cry of protest from Joyce Halvorsen, a friend who had previously rented the apartment Miss Moore lived in at the time of the shooting. 

The matronly divorcee read her statement in a clear voice, facing the judge in the same slacks, blouse and vest she had worn in other court appear­ances. Judge Conti leaned his chin on his hand as he listened to her. 
Butz blasts farm favoritism claims cooperatives aided 
WASHINGTON  (APJ  -Agri­ 
culture  Secretary  Earl  L. Butz  
told  leaders  of  the  nation's  

farm cooperatives Thursday that some of their members have abused their legal advan­tages and been "aided and abetted by the Department of Agriculture." 
"This has not been done for good marketing but for mo­nopolistic price enhance­ment ... I'm firmly convinced we have done that," Butz said at the final session of the Na­tional Council of Farmer Coop­erative's annual meeting. 
The secretary was not specif­ic about the abuses he alleged except to say they involved marketing orders. He did refer to one unidentified "ruthless dairy cooperative" that grew by "cannibalism" which "re­flects on all of us." 
Butz previously has singled out some cooperatives for criti­cism. He told a Harvard Uni­versity audience last fall that grain marketing in some areas of South Dakota was dominated by cooperatives. 
Butz said cooperative abuses "turn consumers off on us. Let's not kid ourselves, they're the majority." 
He said the only way farm cooperatives will survive in­freasing attacks from several government agencies and out­side groups "is by living right and gettinl'! credit for it." 
"I believe in co-ops ... on the other hand, I believe in com­petition. We must avoid even the appearance of evil," Butz said.

survey of the states' financial positions reported Thursday. 
The survey of the financial health of 37 states found that capital outlays increased 31 per cent from 1974 to 1975 but that they are expected to drop 14 per cent from 1975 to the end of this year. 
"Virtually every state is doing it," said Joseph Rhodes, deputy director of the Ameri­can Association of State High­way and Transportation Offi­cials, when asked how many states were forced to use mon­ey earmarked for capital ex­penditures on current oper­ations. 
"The states have a choice when they foresee a deficit," said Pricilla Schwab, a staff member of the National Gover­nors Conference, which spon­sored the survey. "They can put off capital expenditures or go to the bond market and bor­row money against the future." 
Using proceeds from bond sales to meet current needs can be risky, bringing about such problems as those facing New York City, said James Martin, deputy director of the confer­ence. 
He said the survey did not turn up evidence that states were doing this and it found "none of the ingredients of a default." 
What New York City did was to transfer day-to-day expenses into the operating budget. This put the city in the position of paying for operating costs by floating bonds and led to the hidden budget deficit that even­tually cost the city its credit rating. 
Martin said an earlier study performed for the governors' conference last autumn found . that the states were combining several tactics to deal with eco­nomic problems. 
He said 22 states had reduced services below their budgeted levels, 23 had cut the number of existing state jobs or had frozen their hiring, and 25 had delayed capital expenditures. 
The current study found that the surpluses the states had built up in previous years have disappeared and that despite belt-tightening measures, gov­ernors and legislatures must in­crease taxes, cut spending, or do both to keep their budgets balanced. 
The study found that ex­penditures in the 37 states sur­veyed are expected to reach $71 billion during the current fiscal year while revenue will total only $67.7 billion. 
"This appears to indicate that the effects of the recession more than offset the revenue growth attributable to in­flation," the report said. 
In Atlanta, Dwayne Riner, a spokesman for Georgia Gov. Ceorge Busbee, said Georgia's

INDIANAPOLIS <AP> -The sponsor of a controversial anti­child abuse bill said Thursday he's optimistic the bill will be passed by the Indiana House Human Affairs Committee. 
Rep. Dennis T. Avery, D­Evansville, said he expects the bill to be out of committee and on to the floor by next Tuesday. 
On Wednesday night, about 300 persons gathered in the House chambers for a public hearing on the bill, and about three-fourths of the audience displayed opposition to the measure in a show-of-hands vote.

The Machiavelli Plan 
art buchwald 
WASHINGTON--The question of whether or not the United States should finance political parties abroad through the CIA doesn't seem to be a problem to the Administration. The only debate is about what parties should receive the money. Rumor has it that the CIA plans to give $6 million to the Christian Democrates in Italy to make sure the Communists don't get elected. But there are some people in Washington who feel that now that the cat is out of the bag, the contribution could be counterproductive. 
One of them is my friend Giulio Machiavelli who knows the political situation on Italy as well as anybody. "I think we should give money to a political party in Italy only if we're certain it will produce results." 
"You mean to the Christian Democrats?" I said. "No, I mean to the Italian Communist Party." "Have you gone mad?" I said to Machiavelli. "Why would we 
give money to the Italian Communist Party?" 

"It's very simple. If the CIA hands over the funds to the Italian Communist Party, everyone will say the Communists in Italy work for the CIA and the center parties will win the election." 
"But that's Machiavellian," I told my friend. "The American people would never stand for it." "Neither would the Italians," Machiavelli said. "Look, right now 
every political party but the Communists are tainted in Italy because It is widely believed their politicians are on the CIA payroll. The only way we can reverse this is by putting the Communists on the payroll and cutting off everyone else." 
"But you can't cut off non-Communist politicians from CIA funds," I protested. "The Right, the Center and the Non­Communist Left depend on that money for their own personal expenses. They have villas to pay off, new cars to buy, Swiss bank accounts to keep up. You can't take money out of their pockets just to defeat the Communists." 
"Ah, but that's just the point," Machiavelli said. "They won't be cut off. 'when the Soviets find out the CIA is supporting the Com­munist Party in Italy, the KGB will have no choice but to support the Christian Democrats. If we're to believe our government, the Soviets pour in a lot more money for an election in a foreign country than the Americans do and, therefore, the Christian Democrats will have more funds to salt away for themselves than when they were financed by the CIA." 
"It's an interesting proposal," I said. "But what happens if the CIA financing is so successful the Communists win in Italy?" 
"There i very little chance of that happening. In almost all cases whichever side the CIA supports in an election loses. But we must make sure that there is a great deal of publicity that the Com­munists in Italy are being financed by the Central IntelligenceAgency." 
"How would you publicize something like that?" 

"We'd get Director William Colby to brief a congressional watch­dog committee in secret session that the CIA was going to five $6 million to the Italian Communist Party. He would make them all swear that they wouldn't reveal a word of it to anyone. 
"Five minutes after the briefing was over, every newspaper bureau in Washington would know about it. The day after the story was printed the White House would deny it. As soon as the denial came out, everyone in Italy would believe it was true. 
"It's brilliant," I told Machiavelli. "But if the CIA starts sup­porting Communist parties in other countries, won't it hurt detente?" 
'It might," he replied, "but what better way to show the Soviets we mean business?"

village nor a booming metropolis, Ameri­can-style. Angers is a city of 150,00 people--about the same size as South Bend (and about as exiciting). It has its old sections of town, its new housing develop­ments and appartment buildings, and its factory zones. The history of Angers dates back to pre-Roman times. Anders, like so many places in Europe, blends old with new in a way that startles many American tourists. 
Surprising too, is Angers' lively down­town area, where everyone goes to do their shopping, and where open-air markets take place several times a week--a far cry from some of America's big cities with dying urban cores. 
Another shock for Domers, accustomed to the night-owl existence of students, was the discovery that in Angers everyone goes to bed by 10 p.m.--at the latest. Even on weekends, the town seems to close down after dark. At eight o'clock, they close the shutters and roll up the sidewalks.

cheaper than Coke, where there are more 
than 500 differenty kinds of c~eese, and the things that are going on without us. Christmas vacation seems too distant and June seems like a mirage that keeps getting farther away. Exams and papers are piling up. Worst of all, mail has slowed down to a trickle and neither threats nor pleas are working to get friends and family to write (so have a heart, all of you out there, will you?) 
Our only consolation is that everyone said this would happen and we've been assured that by Christmas, miraculously, things get better and the time flies by. That helps--a little. Right now, Wf:. can only hope that it's true. 
However, despite the lonliness and the frustrations, there are compensations. Traveling thus far has been good and plans for Christmas vacation give us something to look forward to. And at least we have more free time than we ever ;lad at Notre Dame, we're catching up on our sleep, and some are even taking up crocheting or knitting.

Univ. of Texas professor says 
Solar energy seen as feasible, but costly 
<A P l Due to the soaring costs of heating fuels, many are looking to solr energy to meet the nation's future needs. 
The cost of installing a solar energy unit to heat and cool a 2,000-square-foot house in Aus­tin, Tex., is about $12,500, or $11,000 more than a con­ventional system burning fossil fuels, says Dr. Gary Vliet, a University of Texas professor. 
Leonard, head of the Sandia Laboratories in Alberquerque, N.M., which has an ERDA con­tract. "But cost is the driving factor." 
A more difficult job for solar energy is generating electricity. Two methods are being devel­oped, one using collected sun heat and the other direct con­version of sunlight to power, a process called photovoltaics. 
The collected sun system energy use. There is cost, in­vestment in existing energy in­dustries, the availability of oth­er fuels, financing, building and construction standards, public acceptance, and even the legal question, "Who owns sunlight'?" 
Nevertheless, necessity may lure people to solar power, if the experience of Bridgeport, a small Texas town, is any ex­ample. 
When Bridgeport's 5,000 crease to the Texas Power & Light Co., the utility threatened to cut off the city. 
"They said they were going to pull the plug on us so we decided to go shopping for oth­er sources of power," said city councilman Jack Vandeventer. 
What they found was Solar-King Inc. The Reno, Nev., firm offered to install a 4.2-million kilowatt power pant operating on sunshine. 
plant and the city will furnish the land. It's expected to be in operation in 1978. 
The project will have no fed-era! help and Solar King presi­dent Brian Pardo calls it "a case of American ingenuity, of the common man solving a problem." 
"It's not the government pro­jection of 1990 when solar ener­gy. is going to be a reality," said Pardo. "It's a reality 

Much of this cost is in the water storage tanks holding 8,­000 to 12,000 gallons, buried and insulated, that are needed to store heat for an average home in a moderate climate for up to three consecutive cloudy, sun­less days. 
The simplest solar energy collectors, and the most com­monly used today, are called flat plate collectors. They look like sandwiches 3 to 6 feet by 8 to 10 feet, and they're made of glass, metal and insulation. A clear top layer of glass or plas­tic allows sunlight to strike a metal panel. The panel, painted black, concentrates the heat. Liquid-filled tubes or moving air carry the heat to a storage system which can be a buried tank of water or a basement full of rock. This system can achieve temperatures of up to 210 degrees even in winter. 
Such systems easily provide heat for buildings when air is pumped around the storage unit and back out into rooms. With various adapters, the flat plate collector system also heats wa­ter in homes and swimming pools, and operates absorption air conditioners. 
"We can build a storage sys­tem that would hold heat vir­tual forever " said James uses concentrators that produce people refused to pay a rate in-The company will pay for the now."
