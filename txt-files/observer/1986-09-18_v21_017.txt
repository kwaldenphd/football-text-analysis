Reagan administration orders expulsion of 25 UN Soviet diplomats 
Associated Press 
Washington -The Reagan ad­ministration yesterday ordered the expulsion of 25 U.N.-based Soviet diplomats, but said the action was unrelated to the spy charges Moscow has filed against American journalist Nicholas Daniloff. 
State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb said the expulsion was a follow-up to a U.S. decision announced six months ago, to force cutbacks in the Soviets's U.N. presence. Tile administration has maintained that the Soviet staff at the U.N. is disproportionately large and engages in spy activities. For its part, the Soviets have in­sisted that the required reductions violate the obligations the United States has undertaken as host coun­try for the U.N. 
The names of the personnel af­fected by the order were turned over to Soviet officials by the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Vernon Walters. The 25 were given until Oct. I to leave the country. 
The Soviet U.N. mission im­
mediately signaled that it will resist 
the order. 
"I think there will be a protest," Valentin G. Karymov, a senior counselor at the Soviet mission, told a reporter by telephone. the diplomat, however, said the U.S. note would first be studied by Moscow befor a formal response is make. 
While the administration has 
promised retaliation in the Daniloff 
case, Kalb was categorical in stating that the expulsion order "is not related" to that issue. Secretary of State George Shultz had said Tuesday night that the United States has a "plan of action" for dealing with the Daniloff cas but declined to give details. He said the issue has "put a cloud" over Soviot-American relations. 
Last March, the Reagan ad­ministration announced that the Soviets would be required to reduce their U.N. staff by from 275 to 170 over a two -year period in in­crements of roughly 25 every six months. 
Of the 105 to be sent home, a small number would be attached to the staffs of two Soviet republics, Ukrainia and Byelorussia, both of 
which have U.N. seats.  All25 aff­ 
fected  by  yesterday's  announce­ 
ment,  however,  represent  
Moscow's delegation.  

But Kalb refused to say whether any had engaged in spying. 
The Soviets have 243 diplomats attached to the U.N. while the two Soviet republics have a combined total of 32. 
A U.S. official who asked not to be identified said the Soviet total has dropped below 243, but added that the Soviets have never in­dicated that any of those who departed did so as a result of the ex­pulsion order of last March. 
In any case, he said, the Soviets will be operating under a ceiling of 218 until the United States orders the withdrawal of an additional group of diplomats, presumabley next March. 


South African tragedy kills at least 177 miners 
Associated Press 
Evander, South Africa -Weary rescue crews collected the bodies of miners sprawled along a mile-deep shaft that collected the bodies of miners sprawled along a mile-deep shaft that a raging fire turned into a death trap for at least 177 men yesterday. It was South Africa's worst gold mine disaster. 
Five miners still were missing and believed dead after the Tues­day fire at Kinross Gold Mine released lethal clouds of chemical fumes in the No. 2 shaft where about 2,400 men were working. 
Survivors told of being trapped, unable to breath, of clouds of smoke and of their desperation as they watched their friends fall dead. "Only about seven of us made it to the surface," said Komiti 
Mereko, a black driller with one mining crew. 
Officials said 235 of the miners were hospitalized with burns, in­juries and chest pains from inhaling the fumes that filled the mine after a fire was accidentally started by a welding machine. 
The miners "didn't stand a chance," according to Dick Grenfell, a 38-year-old Briton who survived the fire. ''They just ran in­to a wall of smoke and must have dropped like flies." 
Most of South Africa's miners are black and union representing black miners called the accident "a clear indictment of the industry." A statement said, "It has required tragedy after tragedy and the loss of many lives before the industry and government pay attention to safety standards." 
Most of the bodies were found along a mil-long horizontal tunnel, some in groups and some alone ­men who perished as the frantically sought a way out. 
"The smoke started coming in. Then the oxygen was gone. I couldn't breathe," said Bedron Siphoso from his bed at the Winkelhaak Mine Hospital. 
He said he fainted and when he came to, "I saw many of the others were dead." Rescue crews saved him. 
Trucks drove in and out of the 
mine compound, and men with 
hoses washed just from the hoist 
cage that brought bodies to the sur­
face. 
The accident occurred just days after the Chamber of Mines, the association of mining companies, reported its best safety -figures ever for gold mines.

Students learn of party raid rights 

By BUD LUEPKE Senior Staff Reporter 
Police will continue toviolate student rights until citations are contested and precedents set. This was the message Legal Aid brought to a group of frustrated students last night in the Library auditorium. 
Mario Zepponi and Glen Guanousky, co-directors of Legal Aid and third year Notre Dame law students, discussed the rights and options students have when caught in a party raid and facing a citation. 
Zepponi and Guanousky said they wanted to emphasize that this is a "very serious matter". Guanousky said students who thought their rights had been violated should see a lawyer. But "even if you are right, it's going to take time, it's going to take money and even then you may not win," Guanousky said. 
Zepponi said if an individual student approaches an attorney with his case, he will probably be advised that it isn't worth the time or the money. "But if a group of students get together chances are it will be more ap­pealing to an attorney. The at­torney might handle it for free or at a discount," he said. 
Maria Cintron, Judicial Coordinator for the University, also spoke. She said that in order fur a clear policy to be set "it's probably going to take so­meone to go through the process of opposing and litigating." Zepponi and Guanousky agreed that precedents on this issue were needed. 

The audience, many of whom had been issued citations from area police, questioned the use of breathylyzers and undercover officers by the police. However, no specific answers could be given. "It's a fact-specific situa­tion," said Guanousky. 
Guanousky said that statutes require a police officer to have 
a warrant before entering a home, "but there's a lot of other questions under that." Guanousky said if an officer has probable cause that a crime is being committed, he can enter without a warrant. What con­stitutes probable cause? "That's the question," said Guanousky. 
Lieutenant Aaron Keene of the Indiana Excise Police said undercover units have been used for years. "They walk in like anyone else," said Keene. If they are asked for an invitation or told to go, Keen said they must leave. Otherwise they will look for minors drinking and alcohol being sold without a permit, Keene said. 
Zapponi said Indiana statutes

Judge accepts woman's plea in the case of Kevin Hurley 
By MARK DICKINSON Senior Staff Reporter 
Mary Beth Gallivan, the alleged driver of the car that struck Kevin Hurley, appeared before the St. Joseph County Superior Court yesterday and pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident in­volving a serious bodily injury. 
Judge Gerome Frese accepted the plea and now must determine Gallivan's sentence for the Class D felony which carries a maximum pnson term of up to 4 years and a $10,000 fine. He said he will an­nounce his decision of October 27 at 9 a.m. in St. Joseph County Superior Court. 
Gallivan testified that she was driving north on U.S. 31 at approx­imately 2:30 A.M. on September 7th and hit something that caused her windshield to break. She said she kept on going and later reported the incident to the police. 
That same evening, Kevin Hurley, a Howard Hall freshman, was critically injured after being struck by a car which failed to stop. 
When asked by Judge Frese if she had been drinking before her accident, Gallivan r,eplied she had a beer and a half but that she was sober. 
By pleading guilty, Gallivan relinquished her right to a trial by jury and left the sentencing to Judge Frese. For sentencing pur­

poses, Judge Frese said he can reduce the felony charge to a Class A Misdemeanor (which is for leav­ing the scene of an accident.) that carries a lesser fine of up to 1 year in prison and a $5000 fine. 
Construction will force detour of traffic near ND 
Special to Tbe Observer 
Construction of indoor tennis courts north of Cartier Field will begin immediately, obstruction traffic on the road along the pre­sent courts, according to Don Dedrick, physical plant director of the University. 
Workers will begin digging up the road between Ivy Road and Gate 4 of the ACC, forcing students who use that road to make a detour on their way to campus. The obstuction is expected to last six weeks, Dedrick said. 
Dedrick said safety lights will be set up around the construction site to warn students who walk to school. Dedrick said those students should use the road south of Carier Field that runs by gates 7 and 8 of theACC. Students driving or riding bikes should detour to Bulla Rd., Dedrick said. Bikes can also go on the road south of Cartier Field, he added. 
Dedrick said he apologizes for any inconvience the construction causes.

Terrorists strike fifth bombing site in Paris clothing store demolition 

Associated Press 
Paris -Terrorists struck the French capital yesterday for the fifthtime in 10 days, demolishing a clothing store with a bomb thrown from a car. Five people were killed and 58 injured, authorities said. 
Three people were killed and more than 100 injured in the previous bombings, which promp­ted the government to adopt tough anti-terrorist measures. Two groups seeking to free three im­prisoned Middle Easterners have issued conflicting claims of respon­sibility for those attacks. 
One woman passer-by was blown apart by yesterday's blast in central Paris, and a witness said another victim was lifted several yards into

do not address the use of a breathylyzer outside of driving violations. "Our impression is that it (the use of the breathylyzer at party raids) has never been done before," said Zepponi. Can students refuse it? "If you don't take it, it seems like they're going to take you down to the police station the air. "It is an incredible sight, many women, children, blood everywhere," said a witness who refused to give his name. 
The bomb was tossed from a black BMW carrying two mustached -men, one of whom rolled down the window and tossed the bomb at the Tait clothing and textile store in the Montparnasse district, said Laurent Davenas, an assistant state prosecutor. 
Windows were blown out at several businesses. The sidewalk in front of the Tati store was covered with glass, debris and bleeding vic­tims, many crying out for help. Police cleared a plaza, the Place du 18 Juin, and used it as a helicopter landing pad to evacuate those with the gravest injuries. 
anyway," Guanousky said. 
Guanousky said a citation is an arrest and from what he understood from the pro­secutor, it will go on a student's record. 
The meeting was organized by Student Senator John Gardiner. Gardiner said he thought students needed information regarding their rights and op­tions. "A lot of students have received citations and unknow­ingly maybe their rights have been violated. I've heard from a

A spokesman for the public hospital authority said 19 of those injured in the 5:25 p.m. bombing were in serious condition.

New York downs Cubs to clinch NL East title 
Associated Press 

New York-The New Yotl, Mets, 
led by Dwight Gooden and rookie 
Dave Magadan, brought the Na­
tional League East title home last 
niqllt with a 4-2 victory over the 
Chicago Cubs. 

Coming off a disappointing 1-4 
road trip during which they had 
b, ·n expected to clinch their third 
division title and first since 1973, 
Gooden pitched a six-hitter for his 
third shutout of the season. 
Magadan, who replace the ailing 
Keith Hernandez in the lineup, had 
three hits and two RBI, both times 
driving in Lenny Dykstra. 

Gooden, 15-6, struck out eight 
and walked five. He lost his 
shutout bid when Rafael "almiero 
hit a tv. nm homer in the eighth. 

On the road , the Mets went 25 ·consecutive scoreless innings until 
getting three runs in the third inn­ing of a 4-2 victory in St. Louis on Tuesday night as they reduced their magic number to one. That victory broke a four-game losing streak and was only their second in eight games. 
Against Cubs right-hander Den­nis Eckersley, 6-10, the Mets broke through in the third inning with four singles. With one out, Dykstra singled to right field, and Wally Backman followed with a single to center that sent Dykstra to second. 
Magadan drove in Dykstra as Backman went to third, and, after Gary Carter struck out, Darryl Strawberry hit a single to left, scor­ing Backman. 
The Mets got their third run in
