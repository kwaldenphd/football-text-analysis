Panel discusses Africa's plight 
Speakers stress importance of cultural identity 
By DAVID FRF.DDOSO N,•w; Writl'r 
For yPars, Afriea has bnen plaguPd by war, corruption, opprns­sion. powrty, and starvation. The solution to tlwse ongoing problnms was sought last night in a pam~l dis­cussion that toudwd upon Africa's ~~conomir, sorial. and cultural prob­IPms in today's post-eolonial world, and in particular focused upon construl'ting a 1ww cultural idnntity for tlw rngion. 
Nalova l.yonga. a visiting pro­fi~ssor in llw English departnwnt of Saint Mary's College, voiced her eoncflrll ovllr thn tendnncy of well­educated Afrieans to look outward in snareh of a modnrn Afriean eul­tuntl identity. Afrieans, she said, should not try to b1~ Freneh or t·:nglish, hut should instnad look to their own heritage. 
l'llter Walshe of Notre Dame's gov­ernnwnt department highlighted the dil'l'ieultins ereatnd by the end of colonialism. "Afriea is beginning to massBss what has happened to it," tw said. 
Walslw said that the advantages of eolonialism have been lost, whnreas most of thn disadvantages have rmnained and are further perpetrat­IHI by the post-colonial elite. "The days in which one could hope to go through a standard colonial ed­ucation systmn and expect salaried Brnploymnnt are over," he added. Meanwhile, Walshe said the colonial eeonomy which remains "is not doing very well." 
Professor James Bellis of the Notre 


The Observer/Mike Ruma 

A panel of professors tackled problematic issues in modern-day Africa,highlight­. ing the aftermath of war and famine, in search of a viable solution. 
Damn anthropology department pro­eneded to explain the nature of the eeonornie dillkulties in Africa. Bel­lis said that the small family farmer will necessarily represent a large portion of the African economy in the future. Some businessmen have attempted to establish large cor­porate farms in Africa, but Bellis, who has a great deal of experience in measuring the fertility of farm­land, believes that the ecology of Africa will not allow such farms to succ11ed as they have in the United States. · 
In the same way, Bellis said, many factories which have been built in Africa by Westerners have already failed or are soon bound to fail, due to the fact that both the African environment and the mind-set of the people are often hostile to their sue­eess. 
Psychology professor De Bryant of Indiana University -South Bend out­lined the major problems concern­ing the development of a modern cultural identity in Africa. Deciding exactly which traditions and norms should be included in this modern identity and which periods of African history should be consulted is no easy task, she related. But Bryant pointed out that a fresh and yet traditional cultural identity in Africa will. do a great deal to help solve many of the problems which face the continent's population today. 
The discussion, entitled "Western Education and African Realities," centered around the movie "Gito I'Ingrat," which was shown prior to the discussion. 


Students advance in design contest 
By WENDY GRZYWACZ News Writer 
Utilizing a communal approach to design, rather than an individualistic approach, two groups of Notre Dame architecture students have advanced to the international levnl of the American Society of Heating. Befrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (1\SIIHAE) student design project competition after winning at the regional level. 
Six groups from Notre Dame of six students each entered the competition, sponsored by ASIIRAE, as part of their fourth-year heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (IIVAC) course, taught by Professor Mohamed Gad-EI-Ilak. The students had the option of submitting projects for a campus library in Chieago in the categories of either mechanical or architectural design.

Defending the Garden State 
I don't usually do this. I~~~~~~ 

don't usually use my opportunity here in the Inside Column to express any kind of deep-felt, politi­cal-like beliefs. But I'm not going to go on ridiculously about how Rush Limbaugh can save this country. (He can't. And I don't think it's a coincidence that Rush comes on the scene and we begin hearing all 

Dan Cichalski Accent Copy Editor 

this talk about global warming.) 
Instead I want to talk about a matter more personal to me, but one that applies to many others out there who might be reading this column: my home state of New Jersey. 
For some reason, the Garden State gets abused frequently, especially here. One per­son I know didn't believe me when I told him we actually had state parks. Most of my Core class-particularly the professor-doesn't understand that we have reasons to be proud of our state. For example, we have the clean­est tap water in the country. I'm still not sure what it is, exactly, that comes out of the faucets here. I think it's iron. 
Let me assure you that New Jersey is NOT one big landfill; it is NOT the "armpit of America"; we do NOT all have accents and say "tawk"; and my sister is NOT a gum­smacking mall chick who uses a can of hair­spray daily to get that 10-inch 'do to hold. It's called the "Garden State" for a reason and that reason is NOT (entirely), as George Carlin has said, "If you're growing smokestacks." 
The problem (if you could call it that) New Jersey has is that it hides all the good parts from the transients passing through on 1-95. Anyone going from Philadelphia to New York only sees the New Jersey Turnpike, Camden, and Newark. Those areas are bad but they're not any worse than Gary or South Chicago. 
Believe it or not, when you head south you find farms-Yes! Farms! With blueberries and horses and guys in overalls. And if you make it up north, along the Delaware River, you'll find yourself in the Appalachian Mountains. Really! Mountains with rivers and waterfalls and trees with leaves that change color in the fall just like the ones in New England. 
And then there's the Shore, where I live. 120 miles of sand and waves from Sandy Hook to Cape May that are generally clean. I say "generally" because some of you might be thinking, "But what about all those hypo­dermic needles that washed up some years ago?" Well, my friend, I have two words to explain where they came from: New York. 
The June 1996 issue of SPY magazine has an article in whieh the editors got together and ranked all 50 states in order of annoy­ance. Listed after each state are several rea­sons that make it annoying, such as "What passes as culture" and "Reasons not to live there." Guess which state was #50; i.e., the least annoying? I won't insult your intelli­gence. (For the record, Big Texas is #1.) 
Unfortunately, I've run out of space to con­tinue with my defense. But I will leave you all with this promise: Come to New Jersey this summer and see what it's really like. My name's at the top of this column and my home address and phone number are in the directo­ry. Call me up and stop by. My mom said it's okay.

Beloved columnist Bombeck dies 
SAN FRANCISCO 

Erma Bombeck, the housewife humorist whose wry take on suburban life -from cleaning toilets to getting the kids to take out the trash -earned her a wall of fame of yellowing columns on refrigerators across America, died Monday after a kidney transplant. She was 69. "Erma Hornbeck taught those of us who write columns that the funni­


est things are the things that our readers know the best -houses, cars, kitchens and of course kids," fellow humor columnist Dave Barry said. Hornbeck died at a hospital in San Francisco, where she underwent a trans­plant earlier this month. Bombeck began her column in 1965. It appeared twice a week in about 600 newspa­pers, amusing readers with her gentle, self-deprecating humor. She used her light touch on more weighty issues, including that inevitable time when children leave home. "Wouldn't it be wonderful if parents could look at their teen-agers and say, 'I want you to stay, but you can't.' Wouldn't it be wonderful if teen-agers could look at their parents and say, 'I don't want to leave, but I must.' It's so much better to close the door gently on childhood than to slam it," she wrote in 1990. 
Trial of Klaas murderer begins 
SAN JOSE, Calif. 

Prosecutors began attacking the defense of the man accused of killing Polly Klaas, putting on more witnesses who testified that they saw him in her neighborhood weeks before the kidnapping. Richard Allen Davis, who said he took Polly at random in a drug and alcohol-induced haze, had told police he had never been in the girl's hometown before the kidnapping. Defense attorney Barry Collins acknowledged to jurors in opening statements last week that Davis killed 12-year-old Polly, but he said there is no evidence Davis sexually molested her. Davis still faces either the death penalty or life without parole if convicted of murder and kidnapping, even without the charge of attempted lewd act with a minor. Despite the admission, in California a trial must be held if the death penalty is a possibility. Prosecutors appear to be trying to show that Davis, 41, deliberately stalked Polly. This would under­mine his story to police that he doesn't remember much until he found himself driving in the car with the girl. 

FEC investigates Dole campaign 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. 

Sen. Bob Dole wants an investigation into allegations that his presidential campaign received thousands of dol­lars in illegal contributionE. last year from workers at a sporting goods company headed by a campaign finance official. In a letter to the Federal Election Commission today, Dole campaign general coul.lsel Douglas Wurth said the campaign "is concerned by those allegations and requests the Federal Election Commission to conduct an inquiry into their merits.'' The Kansas City Star reported today that a fourth campaign contributor said she had been reimbursed by the company for her donation to Dole. "As far as I know it's an allegation that's been made and ought to be checked. If somebody did that, they're in deep trouble," the Senate majority leader from Kansas said Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation." The questionable campaign contributions were reported ini­tially in Sunday editions of the Star, which quoted three people employed by Aqua-Leisure Industries, a Massachusetts-based distributor of swimming goggles and inflatable pool toys. The company is run by Simon Fireman, a national vice chairman of finance for Dole's campaign. Last year Fireman, his workers and their fam­ilies sent the campaign 40 individual checks totaling $40,000. 
Hootie is back, with a vengeance 
NEW YORK 

Bassist Dean Felber of the phenomenally successful band Hootie and the Blowfish walked into a New York hotel room carrying a bottle of juice and a copy of The New York Times. As he poured his drink over ice, a radio tuned to a local rock station began to play the band's latest hit, "Time.'' Felber nearly knocked over his glass in his haste to switch it ofT. It's a telling gesture about how ready the band is to move past its multiplatinum debut, "Cracked Rear View," and that's why their second album, "Fairweather Johnson," is coming out so closely on the heels of the first. During a break in their exhaustive two­year tour supporting "Cracked Rear View," they rested on Bermuda and wrote 30 songs, 14 of which made it on the new album. Hootie's debut is still firmly ensconced in the top 20 of Billboard's album charts, and "Time" is still all over radio and MTV. With "Fairweather" just released, the band, which won the best new artist Grammy this year, could find itself in competition with itself.

Veto frustrates pro-life GOP 
By MARCY GORDON Associared Press 
WASHINGTON 

Republicans kept up their at­tack Monday on President Clin­ton's veto of an anti-abortion bill, declaring at a House hear­ing that he was "hiding behind Roe vs. Wade." Democrats boy­cotted the hearing, accusing the GOP of election-year politics. 
Republicans continued to fo­cus on Clinton's veto of a bill that would have banned certain late-term abortions. But the Democrats said the real target was the Supreme Court's abor­tion-legalizing decision itself. 
"They really are aiming at Roe vs. Wade," Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts said in a telephone interview. "This is a way to send a signal to people who believe abortion should be illegal in all cases," said Frank, senior Democrat on the panel. 
At the hearing, Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fia., ehairman of the

Summer Sessions 1996 May 20. June 2 7 ;md 1 -August 2 
Judiciary Committee's Consti­tution subcommittee, said Clin­ton "claims that the Constitu­tion requires Congress to allow partial-birth abortion." lie and others at the hearing strongly disagreed with that idea. 
Witnesses at the hearing in­cluded 19-year-old Gianna Jessen, who said she has cere­bral palsy as a result of a "botched" abortion when her teen-age mother was seven and one-half months pregnant. 
Rep. Henry Hyde, H-Ill., chairman of the full Judiciary Committee, said of her testi­mony, "I have seen somebody come back from the jaws of Hell." 
The five Democratic members were absent yesterday. One of them, Rep. Patricia Sehroeder of Colorado, issued a statement accusing pro-life Republicans of using the hearing as part of their strategy "to undermine the public's consistent and overwhelming support for Roe vs. Wade. 
"Their master plan ... culmi­nates in the November election, when anti-choice Hepublicans will use this issue to elect enough members of the I louse and Senate" to overturn the high court ruling, Schroeder said. 
Earlier this month, Clinton vetoed the Hepublican bill that would ban the rarely-used pro­cedure -termed "partial birth abortion" by its opponents ­except in cases where it is es­sential to save the mother's life. 
The House passed the bill in late March by a vote of 286­129, more than enough to over­ride a veto. Senate approval of the measure last year was by a 
narrower  54-44  vote  that  
would sustain a veto.  
Clinton's  veto  also  has  

brought criticism from Homan Catholic leaders in this country and from the Vatican, which called his action an "incredibly brutal act of aggresion." 
The interior minister, Prince Nayef, did not say when the men were arrested or whether they have been charged but strongly hinted they may face the death penalty. 
"The questioning of those re­sponsible for the bombing has been completed, their confes­sions documented and the Sharia (Islamic law) of Allah will be applied to them," he said. 
Saudi Arabia, where murder and conspiracy to murder are punished by death, does not fol­low legal systems such as those applied in Western eountries. 
Beheading is the usual method of execution in Saudi Arabia, a vast country whose oil wealth and close ties with the United States give it considerable politieal and eco­nomic weight. 
On camera. the four men identified themselves as Abdu­laziz Fahd Nasser, Hiyadh al­Hajri, Muslih al-Shamrani and Khaled Ahmed al-Said. 
The television footage ap­peared heavily edited with crude cuts. By early evening, the network had broadcast their confessions three times on its main channel. They ap­peared to read from prepared statements.

the clubs engage in together. 
Shavers from the Alumni As­sociation said that "the students are the future alumni," and ac­cordingly, the first letter that students accepted to Notre Dame receive is a welcome from the Alumni Association. 
The Alumni Senate, along with the National Directors Board, will also hold their an­nual meeting this weekend to welcome back representatives from the two hundred and thir­ty-seven domestic and in­ternational Alumni clubs. The Senate will have workshops and meetings from Thursday to Saturday, with an awards ban­quet during which the outstanding clubs will be rewarded. 
The Alumni Association spon­sors activities throughout the year, such as Habitat for Hu­manity and other community service projects. Alumni also support and serve as advisors for groups like Shenanigans, NAACP, and the Porn Pon squad. 
The picnic will be an opportu­nity for alumni to experience campus again and hear what the students are saying, and both the students and the alum­ni will get the chance to make connections that will be benefi­cial in the future. There will be no charge for attendees without meal cards as long as they sign in at the registration table, and seniors will receive an alumni starter pack as a free gift.

NATO steps up peacekeeping 
By SRECKO LATAL 
Associated Pr~ 
SARAJEVO 

NATO accused Bosnia's rival leaders Monday of manipulat~ ing the plight of refugees for political ends and warned that civilians could be hurt if orchestrated rallies continue. 
Soldiers in th-e NATO-led peacekeeping force have in~ creasingly had to separate an­gry crowds. In two incidents over the weekend. soldiers nred into the air and U.S. heli­copters buzzed crowds to dis­perse them. Several people were injured. 
Serbs are organizing people, mostly young men, to prevent Muslim refugees from return­ing home. Bosnian government officials, meanwhile. are urg~ ing Muslims to try to visit their former residences to show that Serbs are blocking refugees' right to return. 
The latest incidents proved that freedom of movement, one of the pillars·of the Dayton peace agreement, is still far from guaranteed. 
NATO spokesman Major Si­mon Haselock said NATO was "concerned by what seems to be .a cynical attempt to manipulate concerns of people about their property and 
the attitude that design should embody a communal approach to cities and buildings within it, rather than the individualis­tic one which dominates today," said Peschel. 
The two group leaders will present their projects at a con­ference entitled "Changing Face of Purchasing and Managing Engineering, which will be held at the Center for Continuing Education on April 30. 
homesteads for narrow local or political ends." 
The multinational troops will try harder to defuse tensions but such a policy carries high risks, he said. 
''If soldiers become involved in civilian disturbances ... there is a recipe and a poten­tial for serious injury and fatality." Haselock said. 
Soldiers have not been trained in crowd control, and do not carry riot shields or tear gas, he said. 
Near Doboj, Danish and Pol­ish troops fired over rival Mus­lim and Bosnian Serb crowds Sunday after they were pelted with "dangerous objects,'' the peace force said Monday. Bosnian Serb Radio in Doboj said 20 people were injured. 
On Friday, Czech soldiers in northwest Bosnia opened fire over a crowd when residents of a Serb·held town blocked some 200 Muslim refugees try­ing to return to their homes. 
Fighting and ethnic purges during the 3 1/2 years of war in Bosnia forced more than 2.5 million people to leave their homes. Half left the country and settled abroad. 
Haselock said the NATO-led force will observe more closely future attempts by refugees to return home in order to be ready to deploy soldiers quick­ly if necessary. 
He also stressed that refugees' attempts to cross for­mer front lines should be orga­nized by international aid agencies. 
In other developments, a top 
U.S. diplomat said Monday that Bosnia's former foes have agreed on basic rules for elec­tions, which promise to be the most complex in modern his­tory. 
Robert Frowick, head of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe mission in Bosnia, said citizens unable to return to their former homes can cast absentee bal­lots in their old neighborhoods, or vote in person where they currently live or want to Jive in the future. 
Under the Dayton peace agreement. elections are to be held by mid-September, assuming other conditions of the accord have been met. 
In other developments: 
• In Brussels, NATO Secre­tary-General Javier Solana and General George Joulwan, the supreme allied commander in Europe, said while Bosnia's factions had not complied fully with the peace accord timetable, NATO was still pleased with the pace.

Military officials dub peace plan 'premature' 
By JULIA RUBIN As"u:iated Press 
MOSCOW 

Boris Yeltsin's own national SIH: uri ty adviser called the prnsident's order for a cease­fin• in Cheehnya premature 
Monday, lweoming the latnst of Ynltsin's sneurity chids to crit­idw his pre­~~ I ~~ e t i o n pmten plan. 


y u r Veltsin Baturin said aftnr rnturning from the break­away southern mpublie that it is too soon to stop using foree against rt~bels there, and that to do so just for Yeltsin's re­eh~etion "would eost very dear­ly," the ITAH-Tass news agnney said. It has heeonw dear that Hus­sia's military brass opposes ­and oftnn simply ignores -the pnaen plan Yeltsin announced March 31. Thn plan ealls for stopping governnwnt eombat opnrations nxc1~pt in self-di~rense. It also indudns a gradual troop with­drawal and mediated talks with rlllwl lnader Dzhokhar Du­daynv. Fighting was reportt~dly con­
tinuing Monday in the south­east Vedeno region. The Inter­fax news agency said rebels there were retreating into the southern mountains, while oth­ers were gathering in eastern Chechnya, around the city of Gudermes. 
In Shali, 16 miles southeast of the Chechen capital of Grozny, Hussian troops had sealed off the town, setting up road checkpoints and placing barriers on the outskirts, !TAR­Tass reported. 
Military officials said Shali holds about 300 rebel fighters. 
Thousands of residents and refugees crowded the town, the report said, and supplies tlf wa­ter and medicines were run­ning low. 
Yeltsin, in a tough race for re-election in June, needs to be able to point to progress in Chechnya. The 16-month war has dragged down his popular­ity ratings, and is cited by many leading reformist factions as the chief obstacle to their supporting Yeltsin. 
His peace plan is criticized by many military officials, among them Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. He said he didn't tell troops about the cease-fire order until five days after it was to have taken effect, as to do so earlier would have left them exposnd to attack.

Naval cadets hit with charges 
Academy faces criticism due to alleged felonies 
By TOM STUCKEY Associated Press 
ANNAPOLIS, Md. 

Whatever happened to the honor concept at the U.S. Naval Academy? A string of scandals suggests it has gone the way of the four-masted schooner and the daily ration of grog. 
This month alone, five mid­shipmen and four former stu­dents have been accused of crimes ranging from car theft to molesting a child. Last fall, five midshipmen were charged with selling LSD, and 19 more were accused of using it. 
Nevertheless, the man as­signed to swab the academy's decks after a cheating scandal nearly two years ago says the academy is improving. 
"I think we've made enor­mous progress in the last 20 months. I think the institution is turning; the rudder is taking hold," Adm. Charles Larson said in an interview last week.

on the Severn River with orders to restore its image, said he believes the recent events are unrelated and don't indicate some~~ing "systemically wrong here. 
'The Navy system is 
ethically corrupt­ing. To change behav­ior ... you have to change the system.' 
Navy Professor James Barry 
Others are not so sure. Why, for example, have these things happened at the Naval Academy and not West Point or the Air Force Academy? 
James Barry, a Naval Academy professor of ethics and leadership, maintains there is a culture of hypocrisy at the academy and throughout the Navy that tolerates misbe­havior and encourages cover­ing up problems. 
"The Navy system is ethically corrupting," said Barry, who angered his superiors by writ­ing an article for The Washington Post last month critical of the academy. "If you are going to change the behav­ior of the midshipmen and the officers. you are going to have to change the system." 
Even though Larson insists the academy is on the right course, he ordered a one-week stand-down that began last Tuesday. Midshipmen who nor­mally may leave campus in the evenings were directed to stay to discuss the problems and possible responses. 
Academy midshipmen take a pledge never to lie, cheat, steal or tolerate such behavior by other midshipmen. It's called the honor concept. 
But that ideal has taken a beating in a decade that opened with the 1991 Tailhook convention, at which dozens of Navy and civilian women were sexually assaulted by drunken aviators. Just this month: 
• 
A midshipman and four for­mer students were charged with creating a car theft ring. 

• 
A top-ranked midshipman officer was thrown in the brig in Quantico, accused of sexual­ly harassing four women and threatening one. 

• 
A midshipman was arrested for allegedly fondling a toddler while visiting an Annapolis home on leave. 


ban. 
In his ruling, Superior Court Judge Richard Strophy said the state had plenty of scientific evidence that secondhand smoke poses a risk to workers, including studies by the U.S. Surgeon General's office and the Environmental Protection Agency. 
The judge conceded the in­dustry's argument that many of the studies focus on the effects of smoking on a non­smoker living with a smoker. 
But he said the workplace probably involves a heavier concentration of smoke, from more smokers, than a private home. 
People spend as many of their waking hours at work as at home, and might find it harder to get away from smoke in the workplace, Strophy said. 
Michael York. an attorney for Phillip Morris tobacco com­pany, called the ruling "a political decision" and said he would appeal. 
"Neither science nor law support this decision," he said. 
Forty-six states already re­quire smoke-free indoor air to some degree, mostly in state government work sites. And the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration is considering banning on-the-job smoking nationwide.

A judge upheld Washington's ban on smoking in private of­fice buildings Monday, ruling that state officials had plenty of scientific evidence that secondhand smoke poses a risk to workers. 
"It's a big win for the work­ers and I hope it is another nail in the coffin of Joe Camel," said Mark Brown, director of the state 

Department of Labor and Industries. Tobacco industry officials said they would appeal. 
The regulation, enacted in 1994, bans smoking in all pri­vate office buildings except in designated smoking rooms. Other state regulations ban smoking in public areas such as stores and in state office buildings. 
The regulation was chal­lenged by the tobacco industry and three businesses that were required to comply with the

Israeli attacks spread in attempt to crush guerrillas 
By GREG MYRE 
Associated Press 
BEIRUT 
Israeli warplanes turned to a new target in Lebanon on Mon­day, attacking the heavily forti­fied base of a Palestinian group in hills outside Beirut after 11 days of focusing on Hezbollah guerrillas. 
U.S. Secretary of State War­ren Christopher, meanwhile, pressed ahead with efforts to broker a cease-fire, meeting again with Syrian President Hafez Assad to present a peace proposaL 
But, as Lebanon's Muslims memorialized victims of last week's Israeli bombing raid on a U.N. base in south Lebanon that killed scores of refugees, peace remained elusive. 
On the 12th day of fighting, Israeli air force jets hit a fresh target -a command base for the Popular Front for the Liber­ation of Palestine. Like Hezbol­lah, the Popular Front opposes the Middle East peace process. The Syria-based group has fre­quently attacked Israel over the years but has not been directly involved in the recent fighting. 
The choice of targets sug­gested growing Israeli frustra­

tion over efforts to pin down the elusive Hezbollah guerril­las, who are largely invisible in the valleys of south Lebanon. 
The raid was the first in or near Beirut since Israeli war­planes rocketed Hezbollah strongholds in the southern suburbs last Tuesday. 
Fighter-bombers fired at least eight rockets into the well-forti­fled Popular Front base in the coastal hills of Naameh, just south of the capital, sending pillars of smoke into the sky. There was no immediate word on casualties. 
The Palestinian radicals are well-protected in Naameh by a concrete tunnel network that periodic Israeli airstrikes over the years have failed to destroy. 
Hezbollah said it fired 30 
Katyusha rockets -five rounds -into northern Israel on Mon­day, and the group threatened to introduce new weaponry into the conflict. 
"Hezbollah possesses weapons which it has not used yet," said Sheik Nabil Kaouk, the group's southern comman­
der. He did not elaborate. 

On the diplomatic front, Lebanese President Elias Hrawi was en route to New York to address a special session of the 
Assembly completes charter 
Post-apartheid constitution faces scrutiny 
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS 
Associated Press 
CAPE TOWN 
Legislators presented a new constitution for post-apartheid South Africa on Monday, declaring that "we the people of South Africa recognize the injustices of our past." 
The 121-page documental­ready has been approved by party leaders, and is expected to be adopted May 8 following parliamentary debate Tuesday and Wednesday and refinement by the constitution-writing assembly. 
The charter enshrines the rights to adequate housing, food, water, education and 

health care -all of which were denied the majority of black South Africans under white­minority rule. 
"We the people of South Africa recognize the injustices of our past; honor those who suffered for justice and free­dom in our land; and believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity," the preamble pro­claims. 
It took the constitutional as­sembly, made up of the 490 members of the National As­sembly and Senate, two years to complete the constitution, which was to replace an inter­im constitution that opened the way to South Africa's first all­race election in 1994. Comment from South Africans was sought in the form of letters, telephone calls and public forums. 
The result is a constitution that bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, age,

But opponents fear the indus­try is undoing the 1984 breakup of the old Bell System, which was meant to encourage competition. 
Some consumer advocacy groups objected on the grounds that the deal violated the spirit of the telecommunications deregulation law passed two months ago. 
"The public was told the new law would lead to new entrants in every market and instead we are seeing the same old mo­nopolies banding together to prevent competition from de­veloping," said Bradley Still­man, telecommunications pol­icy director at the Consumer Federation of America. 
New York State Attorney General Dennis Vacco said Monday his office already had begun to review the deal. 
"I find it somewhat ironic that several years ago there was a breakup of AT&T, Ma Bell as it was called, and now the Baby Bells are coming back together," Vacco said. "We have to take a very careful and close look at it to make sure it's not going to diminish competitiveness, especially for telephone rates."

But AT&T is shrinking with the spinoff of its communica­tions equipment and computer manufacturing businesses. By the end of the year, it will em­ploy 200,000 and have revenue of around $55 billion.

"This has made them almost as powerful as the organized crime syndicates from Colom­bia" and at least five times more powerful than U.S. crime syndicates, Constantine said. 
It's still unclear whether Colombian cartels will fight their Mexican counterparts for control of the U.S. cocaine mar­ket, Constantine said. "We are watching that very carefully," he said. 
Mexico and the Caribbean also have increasingly come into play as havens for drug tr·affickers' cash, because of comparatively lax laws on money laundering, he said. 
About 70 percent of all co­caine entering the United States crosses through Mexico. The country also produces much of the heroin, marijuana and methamphetamines consumed in the United States.

• STEERING BY THE STARS 
Collegiate experiences build base for adulthood life 
Don't stop me if you've heard this one. 
In the fall of 1994 Lou Holtz visited Dan Henning, head coach for Boston College. Henning showed Lou a white phone on a pedestal in his office. "It's a line to Heaven," he explained. "If you like, you can call God and then pay me for the phone bill." 
Lou called the Lord and had a forty­five minute conversation. "That'll cost you two hundred dollars," Henning told him. Lou wrote a check and went back to South Bend. 
Mary Beth Ellis 
A few weeks later Henning visited ND. Upon entering Lou's office, he saw a gold phone on a pedestal. "Don't tell me you have a phone line to Heaven too!" Henning exclaimed. "I have to make an emergency call to God. Mind if I use it?" 
"Be my guest," said Lou. 
So Henning called God and talked for over an hour. "What do I owe?" he asked. 
"A quarter," said Lou. 
"That's impossible. How could a phone call to God cost so much from Boston and so little from Notre Dame?" 
"Because," Lou said, "from here it's a local call." 
I love this joke. I love it even though the general reaction to it is, "Would you like a little wine with that cheese?" It appeals to me because it illustrates the fact that this place not only gets into your blood, but your soul. Plus it gives me a chance to knock BC, which is always a good thing. 
We were all here once: In a few weeks I will mark the first anniversary of my high school Baccalaureate, the day I stood outside St. Peter in Chains Cathedral in downtown Cincinnati wear­ing a ridiculous hat and a calf-length white gown that did absolutely nothing for my figure. Just before Mass began the bells in the cathedral tower swung into song, prompting a friend to grab me in a hug and say, "It's the bells of Saint Mary's, Mary Beth!" 
No rendition of the senior song or prettily worded good-bye made me cry as hard as that moment did, when past, present, and future fused. I walked down the aisle of that cathedral having no idea what life would bring at this proud college and famous university where tradition grew like the ivy on the classroom buildings. 
I barely know that graduate now. She was painfully guy-shy and untouched by the scourge of DART-ing-someone who thought that "Parietals" was the name of an infamously bad campus band. 
Who were you before you became a Bookstore Basketball junkie or a woman with a shuttle schedule shoved into the pocket of every jacket she ·owns? Your answer reflects the quality of Saint Mary's and Notre Dame both as schools and as communities-the way they have shaped you, and the way you may have helped to shape them. Are they better or worse for your presence here? 
And how has SMC/ND affected you? Have you let it? Will you take more from this place than the shot glass collection various SYR dates built for you? These two schools are hardly per­fect. We're going to be frustrated during our four-year ride through here. But kids-that ride is a thrill ride. No won­der the tickets for it are so hard to come by. 
There is a line in the movie "Sabrina" that made me shiver with recognition when I heard it: "I met myself if Paris." Sabrina met herself in France; I met myself in South Bend. (Paris ... Northern Indiana ... vive Ia difference. I defy you to find an establishment entitled "Greg's Garage and Bait" on th~ Champs­Elysees.) 

The myself I've met here subsists on squirt cheese, has become a procrasti­nator. developed an embarrassingly large en masse crush on the Glee Club, and has yet to pronounce "AnTostal" correctly, but she'll be all right. She's been having the time of her life. 
Here I have buried my hands in the carpet grass of Notre Dame Stadium. I have shared oxygen with Apollo 13 com­mander Jim Lovell and political satire god P.J. O'Rourke. I have wrestled with Socrates (and lost) and have learned to order a beer in very bad Spanish. 
And that was just during orientation weekend. 
College will either bake you into what you already were when you first came here or radically change the recipe. And if you're adding the new ingredients of experience, nothing illuminates the difference between August and April like a dorm room on the verge of being dismantled for the summer. I used that mirror to get ready for my very first dance ... out this window, I watched dawn break over the tennis courts as I stayed up writing Observer articles... here's the mark on the wall from the night I kicked it in a fit of midterms frus­tration. 

Next semester a member of the class of 2000 will move into this cell-if she's normal, with too many blankets and not enough quarters. And I will take over the memory-faced room of some young woman going on to bigger and better adventures herself. That is the way of things. 
It's a nice way, I think. 
Mary Beth Ellis. a freshman at Saint Mary's College who was last seen in one of them cool new "Belles" hats. cries whenever she hears the Alma Mater or even when someone sets offthose obnox­ious pins in the bookstore that beeps the Victory March. Her friends have agreed that she needs professional help.

Dear Editor: 

Peter Walshe's letter of Mar. 7 and Neve Gordon and Catherine Rottenberg's of Mar. 26 criticize Feminist for Life officers' opposition to hormonal contraception in our Feb. 28 Observer letter. those members of the Common Sense board also rejected an article with similar themes because I did not advocate condoms. They suggest that our women's·health­ba.sed critique is invalidated by our own personal preference for natural family planning over barrier methods as an alter­native. My article's discussion of birth control and reproduc· tive technology drew heavily on Catholics for a Free Choice co-founder Jan Raymond, who would be amused to be accused of a "far-from-feminist. hard-core Vatican line." 
I happen to be a committed Catholic who agrees with Church teaching on sex. My views changed not due to papal authority, but personal and professional experience. I have been married seven years; birthed, nursed and buried a (planned) daughter; extensively researched women's health while teaching in the Gender Studies program; and counseled hundreds of women in possible crisis pregnancies. I have seen women and girls harmed by abortion and hormonal con­traceptives chosen without informed consent, and performed positive pregnancy tests for many whose partners wore the safer but less effective condom. 
One of those positive tests was today, for a heartbroken fif· teen year old who had had sex once in her life, "protected" by a condom. She rightfully looked at me with betrayed eyes. Instead of the truth •• that sex is safe only for adults in a truly committed relationship •• she was told by our sodety thnt all she needed was a piece of rubber. She was brave and gener­ous enough to choose life for her ehild. But she faces a diffi· cult road and the consequences for her will be far greater than for her boyfriend, just as they would be had she chosen abortion. His "responsible" condom use clearly gave her little real protection. 
NFP is an empowering, countercultural alternative' which my Protestant husband and many of our friends appreciate. It Is 99 percent method effective, safe, inexpensive, and builds communication. It helps achieve pregnancy when desired, confirms it without a test, and gives a more accurate due date than doctors' estimates, which recently saved my best friend from an unnecessary C-section.

Earth Day presents opportunities Work brings 
Dear Editor: 
Earth Day presents America with an opportunity. We need a national dialogue on new ways of updating safeguards to assurn dean air, water, and protect species and their habitat. At the same time we ntHld to explore better stewardship of pub­lie lands and validate quality management of th11 hazardous byproducts of our econo­my.ln reeent years, the political leadership has attempted to do this by building on existing federal and state regulatory pro­grams with more stringent controls, tougher standards of performance, and nnw lines and penalties -even when com­plianee is high. 
This approach is combative and eostly to those who am mgulated, not only in busi­ness and industry. but also farmers and ranehers, homeowners. munieipal govern­mnnts and many others.But there is anoth­er way to get a deannr. safer environment, and this nnw approach is steadily gaining support among scientists, engineers and othnrs in tlw front trenches of tlw war against pollution. 
Tlw rww modf.\1 is based on four broad prineiplns: utilization of up-to-date seience and ttldmology; focusing scaree dollars on most urgent environmnntal problems; attacking pollution on a site and situation spndlie basis and making state and local govnrnnwnts and tlw private sm:tor allies instead of adversaritls.This may sound like eomrnon sense, hut nxisting regulatory pro­grams unintnntionally frustrate and inhibit thnsn prineiples. 
For exarnpln, almost everyone agrees that science and technology is the key to grmmer futum. But inflexible language in the environmental statutes often prohibits agencies and the regulated community from taking full advantage of the bast availabln sdtmce and tnchnology. 
Similarly, agencies often lack the discre­tion to deploy scarce dollars against the biggnst risks, bneause 30 and 40 year old statutes set priorities based on the prob­lems perceived at the time of enaetment. 
Another barrier to progress is the confus­ing hodgepodge of overlapping, inflexible ­and sometimes contradictory -rules, guide­lines and mandates emanating from differ­ent federal laws and agencies. One size does not fit all. Pollution controls work best when designed for· specific sites and situations. Businesses, farmers and ranch­ers, homeowners, state and local govern­ments, should be enlisted in the effort as partners, because those closest to a resource are best able to manage it. 
They should be encouraged with incen­tives, rather than browbeaten with threats of penalties. This is not a prescription for gutting or weakening environmental laws an programs, w brought us a long way from the days of belching smoke­stacks, burning rivers and denuded forests. But there is a growing recognition that cur­rent programs need reorientation. 
There is too much Washington-knows­best, too many lawsuits, too much pa­perwork, too much money squandered on trivial risks, and too little flexibility. New thinking and new m.ethods are needed to achieve additional increments of health, environmental remediation, and natural resource protection as we enter the 21st Century. 
Let the dialogue begin!

Dear Editor: 
I doubt there is a person today who has not heard of the deadly disease, AIDS. This spring break, I had the oppor­tunity to work at the South Bend AIDS ministry, a service that provides counseling for those infected with the disease. 
There is a stereotype to AIDS often pointing to high risk behaviors such as promiscuity and drug abuse. I was shocked to see the diversity of those infected with this disease. People who had never partici­pated in any behaviors associ­ated with high risk were diag­nosed with AIDS.People who are infected may look perfectly healthy and not even realize they themselves carry this dis­ease. Unknowingly, they trans­mit the disease to others and so on. 
I feel the notre Dame com­munity must be reminded of the hidden nature of this dis­ease. Compared to other cam­puses, we see little of the risk behaviors assoeiated with the disease. Yet we know anyone can have AIDS, ineluding ND students. The greatest danger is to assume that you are invin­cible to such a disease. The truth of the matter is that any­one can become infected. It only,y takes one time of having unprotected sex.

lookins for MuPPets in All the Wrona Places 
By JASON HUGGINS Worl<l Wide Web Correspondenl 
Last semester, as many enginerds can rm~all, the Nieuwland computer cluster had it's own theme song, "Mahna, Mahna" from the unofficial Muppets page (www.sei.kun.nVthalia/funpage/muppets). The song was actually a digital copy of from the dassic "Best of the Muppets" CD from Jim IJenson Hecords. i\s I squandered precious shwp-hours in the lab trying to finish my C assignments for CSE232, I would hear this song playnd over and over again on various workstations throughout the lab. 
i\nd as a true Muppet fan, I yearned for my own eopy to play when not in the lab. One day after class, I searehcd snveral musk stores in the South Bend area without success-no one Sllmns to be carrying the Muppets' CDs any­more. i\fter being laughed out of every store in town. I quickly became frustrated. 
However, latnr that wnek I had an epiphany: "i\ha! I'll seareh the web!" i\nd thus, I began my on-line shopping adventure. I was pleas­antly surprisnd to lind that CDs are some of tlw easiest things to buy on-line, and they're among the most popular on-line purchases, too. i\ few minutes with the search engine Yahoo returned dozens of names of CD ven­dors. 
I rneandnred over to CDnow (cdnow.com). performed a search, and in a couple of sec­onds found tlw Muppets album I was looking for all week. It was on sale for under $10, and extra for cheese. A grilled cheese sandwich goes for only $1.35, and more fries than you can eat are available for $1.33. Fat Shirley's also serves breakfast food, with a cheese omelet for $2.25 and two pancakes for $1.35. No scrambled eggs for me this time -I learned my lesson on that. 

Erin's consensus· on the burger was "better than Denny's," while I particularly liked the BLT even though I took off the L and the T because they looked like death. The atmo­sphere alone is worth the visit, and I guarantee you'll be entertained. Fat Shirley's undoubt­edly wins our Supreme Grease award. We give it a 9 on prices, an 8 on food quality (like I said, beware the produce), a 9 for atmosphere, but definitely a 5 or less for safety. A single female gathering spot this is not, so it you are of the SF persuasion, bring your own man. Please. 
DAY7: 

Didn't God even get a day off? I couldn't stand the self-inflicted digestive upheaval any­more, so to offer you a quick look at the Taco Bell drive-thru, I turned to a panel of experts. Taco Bell addicts Leanne Hobinson and Christine Haley told me that the threat of pend­ing indigestion is no problem after midnight. 
"You eat it so late at night that you just come home and go to bed," Haley noted. "It's nice, it's cheap, and you never get tired of it." 
Hobinson recommends the Lite 7-Layer 
Burrito and the Bean Burrito with lite sour cream. The 7-Layer costs only 99 cents, with 10 cents extra to substi­tute lite sour cream. The bean burrito is a steal at only 69 cents, and for dessert. don't pass up the cinnamon twists. I can tell you from person­al experience to stay far. far away from the BLT collection. and Hobinson 
warns against the Double Decker taco which seemingly pastes a soft and a hard taco togeth­er with congealed beans. 
i\nd so, fellow midnight snackers, I leave you with these words of adviee. Be safe, beware "the iettuce, and never ever eat at all these places in one week. We'll see you where the grease is ... 
I ordered it by typing in my credit card num­ber. For secure transactions. CDnow supports Netscape's protocol, Netsite, which encrypts your credit card number. Within 5 business days. I was hanging out with Kermit and the Gang in the privacy of my own room. 
CDnow is an intelligently crafted site, easy to use and visually appealing. Also, CDnow has a large selection of discounted COs, some on sale for $10-$12 plus shipping and han­dling ($2.95 for first-class mail). You wind up paying about what you might at a retail shop. 
There are two other nice advantages to shopping on the web. First is the convenience of shopping from your desktop -a great diversion when you're supposed to be work­ing, and a time saver if you'd rather not take the bus to the U.P. Mall. 
Second, computerized searching allows you to browse for CDs in more sophisticated ways than fingering through bins: you can search not only by artist, but also by album name, song title, and even release date. This is a great solution if you have a song running through your head with no idea who cut it or when. And in the coming months, "intelligent agents." small programs whieh cater to your own music preferences, will be able to shop for you, finding the best price on the Web. 
Whether you're looking for the Mozart, Morissette, or the Muppets, you'll probably find it at CDnow.

• MEDICAL MINUTE 
Not Good Enough 
ByJOHN GALVIN Accent Health Correspondent 
Do you constantly procrastinate? Do you have 
high·standards that you never meet'? Do you equate 
your self-worth with your G.P.A. and test scores? If 
so, you suffer from a common emotional condition 
called perfectionism. 
Perfectionism occurs in a number of' forms: 
• 
At the more benign ·end, many who are serious about performing well entertain perfectionistic thoughts on occasion and lind themselves worrying unnecessarily, procrastinating, or second guessing their actions after finalizing an initiative; however, they are able to put these worries aside and attend to their tasks in a relatively effective manner. 

• 
At the other end of the eontinuum are those who are continually handicapped by a strongly ingrained perfectionistic trait and sutTer considerably in their self-esteem, emotional health and productivity. 

• 
Midway on the spectrum are individuals who waver in the degree to which they can manage their perfectionistie demands. For instance, It is common for college students to go through a phase of perfec· tionism as they make the transition from high school to college-level demands. Likewise, a student that is entering the workplace will face new standards and have to adjust to new levels of ability. . 


What are the indicators of perfectionism'? Perfectionist thinking is relatively common, particu­larly in competitive university environments like Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. With most people, perfectionistic struggles are manageable, but more pronounced difficulties can show up in a number of forms: 
• 
extensive procrastination, in whieh the person cannot free her/himself from porfectionistic demands long enough to begin writing. studying. etc. 

• 
heightened anxiety caused by perfoctionistic "what if-ing" about upcoming events (tests, speech· es, dates, etc.), which can lead to concentration lapses. 

• 
high stress levels and fatigue caused by worrying incessanlly about performance and personal prob­lems. 

• 
lack of enjoyment in life. because perfectionism prevents one from enjoying rewards and lHisure when there are any obstacles to contemplate 


· What can be done to overcome perfectionism? The first step in addressing your perfectionistic tenden· cies is to assess the level of your difilculty: 
• 
Do you think in black and white? -things are either right or WJ'ong, your-way or no-way, cool or stupid. 

• 
Do you construe your life with expectations? -you need that good grade, that dream job, or that perfect body. 

• 
Do you tend to worry about the future without enjoying what you have completed? Do you con­stantly consult your daily planner to check for dead· lines and major events? 

• 
Do you selectively attend to your problems, while overlooking everything else? 

• 
Do your feelings of self-worth go up and down with your judgment of how well you have handled a situation? 


If you answered "yes" to several of these ques­tions, perfectionism is probably a relatively strong trait for you. If you answered "no" or "sort or rather than a bold "yes" to most questions, you can probably enhance the degree to which you manage perfectionistic thinking by consciously monitoring and re·thinking your thought patterns and applying some preventive strategies. 
• 
Make a conscious efTort to tune into and moder­ate your perfectionistic thinking. · 

• 
Monitor your "internal dialogue"-the phrases you mutter or videos you run in your head. Avoid dichotomous thinking (right-wrong, categorical clas­sifications); dramatizing (making mountains out of mole hills); selective attention (blaming yourself for let-downs but not rewarding yourself for suecesses.) 

• 
Cultivate a more soothing "coping dialogue" that enables you to be a good friend or good parent to yourself ("I can't do everything perfectly. It's O.K. for me to set priorities and then do the best I can.") 

• 
Affirm your humanness by recognizing that your self-worth is independent of any single performance. 


How long will the effects last? In many cases, mild to moderately severe perfectionism can be overcome. If the trait is unusually stubborn. a uni­versity counselor might help you obtain therupy. While you might always have perfectionistic tenden­cies to channel, most people can reach improved levels of self-understanding and self-acceptance and can fashion effective strategies for managing perfec­tionistic thinking suceessfully.

Rockets favored in playoffs 
By CHRIS SHERIDAN 
Associated Press 
Time to stop gushing over the Chicago Bulls. 
The regular season's over and the Bulls were great, but it doesn't mean much in the NBA for the next two months. 
The Houston Rockets are still two-time defending champions and the team to beat. And the Bulls still have to overcome their failures of the past two seasons. 
"We're not going to give it up, not without a fight," Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said Sunday. 
The Rockets, finally healthy after injuries hit them hard the past 2 1/2 months, are the fifth seed in the West and play the Los Angeles Lakers in a best-of­5 playoff series beginning Thursday night. Houston won the title as a sixth seed last year after going all the way as a No. 2 seed in 1993-94. 
"If we're healthy, I'd say on paper, you have added a Mark Bryant, added an Eldridge Recasner to a championship team, you have to feel you're better," Tomjanovich said. 
"But talent and potential really means nothing in getting the prize. 
"Are you the best team? Can you handle the tough situa­tions? The first year we didn't have an explosive offense. We have more options now than we had on the first championship team. Right now, we have to get back to the team that does what it takes to win." 
Other first-round matchups are Chicago-Miami, Orlando­Detroit, Indiana-Atlanta and Cleveland-New York in the East and Seattle-Sacramento, San Antonio-Phoenix and Utah­Portland in the West. 
The Bulls are coming off the best regular season in NBA his­tory (72-10). which assured them of the home-court advan­tage through the finals. First, though, they have to get there. 
There are two images to re­member from last year's play­offs before penciling in the Bulls as the automatic champi­on: Rudy T.'s mouth and Michael's mistakes. 
Tomjanovich stood at center court in the Summit last June, confetti falling all around him as the Houston Rockets cele­brated their second straight championship. 
"Never underestimate the heart of a champion," Tomjanovich yelled to the crowd after his team swept the upstart Orlando Magic. 
The speech came nearly a month after Jordan, the rust showing after a 21-month re­tirement, botched his way through Games 1, 3 and 6 against the Orlando Magic and the Bulls were eliminated in six games in the Eastern Conference semifinals. 
"He's probably still the great­est player, but he wasn't quite his old self and the people around him weren't the same," Scottie Pippen said after Jordan had his earliest playoff exit since 1988. 
Jordan looked much better this season as he won his eighth scoring title and is prob­ably headed for his fourth MVP award. The Bulls reveled in their unprecedented success, but they repeatedly said 72 wins won't mean a thing unless a -championship follows. 
"The most important thing is for us to win the title," Pippen said. 
Lakers' Peeler out of action for first round 
Associated Press 

INGLEWOOD, Calif. 
Anthony Peeler, a reserve for the Los Angeles Lakers, is doubtful for Thursday night's opener of their first-round playoff series against the two­time defending NBA champion Houston Rockets. 
Peeler, who averaged 9.7 points per game, strained his right calf during Sunday night's 92-88 victory at Portland. 
The 26-year-old guard was examined by team physician Dr. Stephen J. Lombardo on Monday. 
"He's going to be listed as day-to-day, but he's doubtful to play Thursday night," team spokesman John Black said. 
Peeler was running down­court when he stopped near midcourt, clutching the back of his right leg. Within seconds, and before play could be stopped, he sat down on the court. 
"I've never felt anything like that before," Peeler said. Peeler scored 20 points 
against the Trail Blazers before being injured. He was a major factor as the Lakers finished the regular season with wins in 12 of their final 16 games. He made 25 of his 53 attempts from three-point range in the last nine games. 
Peeler was listed on the Lakers' playoff roster Monday along with Elden Campbell, Cedric Ceballos, Vlade Divac, Nick Van Exel, Eddie Jones, Magic Johnson, George Lynch, Sedale Threatt, Corie Blount, Fred Roberts and Derek Strong. 
Left off were Anthony Miller, who was placed on the injured list April 16 because of tendini­tis in his right knee, and rookie Frankie King, who has been on the injured list since Nov. 24 because of back spasms. 
Van Exel. the team's starting point guard, didn't play in the last seven regular-season games because he was sus­pended and fined an NBA record $25,000 for bumping referee Ron Garretson on April 9 during a game at Denver.

Linksters save best performance for last 
By DEREK BETCHER 
Sports Writer 
The women's golf team ended its season with their best performance of the year. Wef~kend action saw the Irish shoot a 656 at the Illini Spring Classic en route to finishing second. Their second-round 308 tied the lowest single round score in the eight year history of Notre Dame women's golf. 
Despite shooting a 348 the first day of competition, the Irish found their competition equally frustrated by the weather and found them­selves in fourth place. Saturday, Champaign's Illinois Hlue Course foatured blustery winds that gusted up to 50 mph. 
The wind apparently did not trouble Katie King, who was among Saturday's best with llll 84. She linished the week· ond with a 163, good for a seventh place tie with team­mate Traey Melby.

Irish prepare for Big East Tourney 
BY BRIAN REINTHALER 
Sports Writer 
As the outdoor track and field season approaches its final weeks, the Irish track and field team has begun to prepare themselves for the Big East Championships to be held at Villanova over the first week­end of May. 
Last Friday, the team split into two and traveled to meets that the coaches felt would best 
suit their preparation,  the  
Mount Sac  Relays  and  the  
Michigan State Invitational.  

"There are a lot of great long distance races at Mount Sac," commented head coach Joe Piane, "and I wanted our best guys to compete there." 
Senior middle distance run­ner Jeff Hojnacki ran a blister­ing time of 1 :46.90 to capture the 800 for the Irish. In addi­tion to the performance by Hojnacki, Jason Rexing took fifth in the 5000 with a run of

Penn State's Bobby Engram who was selected four picks ahead of Mayes by the Chicago Bears, who thought Engram was a better punt returner. The Packer's, who were eyeing Mayes since the first round, were surprised to see him still available. 
"That was like a no brainer," Green Bay general manager Ron Wolf said of his selection of Mayes. "He has made some phenomenal catches. Some of the stuff he did was just amaz­ing. We also had him timed faster than anything that was published" 
Wolf even went on to com­pare Mayes to the former Packer All-Pro Sterling Sharpe. "He'll be very similar athletical­ly and physically to a player

Notre Dame's linksters shaved forty strokes off of their first round score to surge into second place past a rield comprised primarily of Big 10 schools. Minnesota won the event with a 651, while Northwestern finished a stroke behind the Irish in third place. 
Senior captain Julie Melby's strong finish epitomized her team's late season perfor­mance. In the last round of her collegiate career, Melby shot her season's best, a 75. Her second round score proved to be the weekend's second lowest, and it helped her to earn eleventh place for the tournament. 
"The talent's been there this season, we've just never put it together for one round. This wasn't a fluke," King assert­ed. Giving relevance to their 308, King cited 320 as a team benchmark and sub-310 as the kind of seoring consistent­ly needed to qualify for the NCAA's golf tournament.

14:23.00, followed by Matt Althoff who finished in 
14:32.00. Sophomore Errol Williams stayed consistent by placing fourth in the 110-meter hurdles with a time of 14.32. 
Only two women made the trip to Mount Sac for the meet that lasted from Friday to Sunday. One of the runners, Erica Peterson, unfortunately had to contend with an injury in her event, but teammate. freshman Nadia Schmiedt was able to run free of pain in the 400-meter hurdles. 
Schmiedt. after a stellar per­formance at the Miami (OH) Invitational a week earlier, ran a decent time of 60.5 in finish­ing seventh. 
At the Michigan State Invitational, Alison Howard and Lamarr Justice starred for the Irish. Howard once again proved that she is the most ver­satile athlete that Notre Dame has by placing third in both the 200 and 400 meter races and 
that used to play here." Mayes was just glad to be fi­nally drafted. 
"I'm glad it's over," he ex­plained. "This was probably the longest day of my life. I was sweating. I started to question myself. 
"I guess it's based on need. Some people need the blaze of speed. I'll get down the field. Only difference is I'll catch the ball. I don't know if some of the others will." 
Mayes even went as far as to reference the Packer's new tra­dition of jumping into the stands after touchdowns. 
"I can jump into the stands real well," he commented. 
Defensive tackle Paul Grasmanis benefited from a strong showing during the off­season workouts to move into the fourth round to the Chicago Bears at the 21st pick, 116th overall. 
"I'm very happy right now," the Grasmanis said after being selected. "They called me two picks before they selected and asked me how I'd like to be a Bear. I told them I already feel like one." 
winning the long jump with a solid leap of 18'10". 
Justice also competed well in multiple events. The senior won both the long jump and the triple jump on Saturday. 
Chris Smith, Mike Conway and Mike Smedley also con­tributed strong efforts. All three were victorious in their events. Smith threw the javelin 191'11" to take that event, while Conway captured the 1500 and Smedley won the steeplechase. 
"We're getting there," said Piane, discussing his team's preparedness for the Big East Championship meet. "We've got one more week to get ready and get some guys healthy." 
The Irish will complete the regular season this weekend with part of the squad heading to Des Moines for the Drake Relays and the rest of the team traveling north to compete at the Hillsdale Relays in Michigan. 
Grasmanis joins former Notre Dame defensive stars Chris Zorich and Jim Flanigan who 

were both  selected  by  the  
Bears.  
Both  cornerback  Shawn  

Wooden and center/guard Dusty Zeigler were the final two Irish to be drafted and went in the sixth round. 

Wooden's being drafted by Jimmy Johnson and the Miami Dolphins at the a pick was a pleasant surprise. Many felt that the injured defensive back didn't have a chance at being drafted after back and knee surgeries in college. Yet after a much improved and gutsy sea­son the Dolphins felt that Wooden could answer some concerns In the defensive back­field. 
Yet, Zeigler had to be the most disappointed. ·considered to be the star on the Irish's offensive line, Zeigler decided against a fifth year and jumped into the draft. Many believed he would go near the third round, but no one expected him to drop so far. l-Ie was eventu­ally drafted by the Buffalo Bills at pick 35 of round six .

In doubles play, Sprouse and Pun shutout BC's top squad of Jonathan Wright and Rominder Varma, 8-0. 
Sophomore Danny Rothschild got the nod as he teamed up with Brian Patterson for an 8-2 win at No. 2 doubles. Seniors Brian Harris and J.J. O'Brien also won by a score of 8-2 over Dave Huck and Tim Smith. 
On the singles side of the action, Patterson saw his first action at No. 2 singles, dismiss­ing Jonathan Wright 6-3, 6-0. Pun, Harris, and Rothschild also scored straight set victo­ries at Nos. 4, 5, and 6 singles, respectively. Sprouse and O'Brien did not finish their matches with Steve Murray and Dave Huck. 
The fifth seeded squad from Rutgers met the Irish in the semi-finals. Rutgers reached the semi-finals by upsetting the St. John's Redmen in convinc­ing 4-0 style. 
Bayliss again received solid doubles play as the regular Nos. 1 and 3 teams picked up hard fought victories. Sprouse and Pun doubled up on DeVarshi Mitra and Scott McGrath, 8-4. 
Ryan Simme and J. J. O'Brien clinched the point as they turned back the challenge by David Birnbaum and Nick Caradonna, 8-6. Rothschild and Patterson did not finish their match with Paul Campo and Joe Howard. 
The Irish proved their depth as they picked up points from different players on Saturday than they did on Sunday against BC. 
In the top position, Sprouse 
The Observer • SPORTS 
defeated Mitra 6-2, 6-3. And, at No. 4 singles O'Brien domi­nated Paul Campo 6-2, 6-0. Pun picked up another point for the team as Joe Howard could only muster one game, 6-1, 6-0. Pietrowski, Patterson and Harris played in matches that were not completed. 
Although the Irish cruised throughout the field, they did face formidable foes. 
"It was great for us to be able to go to a strong conference tournament, it was much more competitive that the MCC," Sprouse said. "I think the Big East Conference will get a lot stronger which will help us with playing a tougher sched­ule." 
Pietrowski agreed. 
"The competition was really good, we had to come out and play every match." 
The final would match the Irish against the Hurricanes. Earlier this season the Irish dominated Miami 7-0 at home. But now, the hosts had also swept through the competition , beating No. 10 Seton Hall and No. 3 Providence without surrendering a point. 
Though the Hurricanes had an enthusiastic crowd cheering on their nationally-ranked top player Gil Kovalski, the Irish had different ideas as they won in convincing style, 4-0. 
In doubles, the Irish lost their first match of the tour­nament as Arturo Zizold and Ray Schot topped Sprouse and Pun 8-3. 
However, the teams of Pietrowski-Patterson and Simme-O'Brien earned the point for the Irish with 8-1 and 8-3 victories. 
The bottom of the Irish lineup 
helped them to the champi­
onship. Patterson scored a 
point with a 6-2, 6-0 win over

O'Brien dominated his oppo­nent again as he defeated Roman Hudec, 6-1, 6-1. 
Pun won his third match in as many days, struggling in the first but then overcoming Vinod Yesudas 7-5, 6-0. The top three players, Sprouse, Simme and Pietrowski did not finish their matches. 
The Irish now have a three match winning streak with re­gionals three weeks away. According to Sprouse, winning the Big East12 
was a terrific way to end the regular season. 
Bayliss agreed. 

"Going down to Miami and playing in pretty hot weather was a big plus in case we get some hot weather in the region­als. Playing and beating Miami at Miami was a big win." 
Participating in the BIG EAST will provide the Irish with more than just decorations in their trophy case. Bayliss discussed some of the other advantages. 
"It will be healthy exposure, I see all positives for us," Bayliss said. 
"We will get opportunity to compete with Miami who I think will win a NCAA champi­onship in .the next three years. It will also be a great tune up for regionals." 
The team will now prepare and focus on the NCAA Regionals which will be held at the Courtney Tennis Center May 10-12. 
They have earned the second seed as they finished 10-1 in the region with their only loss to the top seed Michigan Wolverines. 


Seniors Jason Pun and Mike Sprouse were defeated, but the Irish still prevailed over Miami, 4-0.

Saint Mary's netters fall short at tourney 
By KATI ILEEN POLICY 
Spnm Writor 
Tlw Saint Mary's Bdlns faced stilT competition at last week­IHHI' s Mid wns t Invitational Tournanwnt. They knew that eoming in, but they had hoped for a betler showing. 
All thrrw matches the Belles played werrl dose. The team won llwir first match against Brltlwl IMNI 5-4. and lost each of tlwir next matches against Wiseonsin-htu Claire and Saint Bmwdict's 5-4. 
"The lrwrll of play was so high at the matches, so I lUll happy tlw matdws were close," said junior Nancy Sorota, No. 2 sin­gles. 
The Invitational featured the top 16 trlams in the region, and Saint Mary's was ranked niPVtlnth. The teams were bro­ken into two brackets, with Saint Mary's in the bottom bracket. 
"We had expected to do bet­ter, but we knew that we were going up against the best," said junior Kate Kozacik. 
The Belles had more difficul­ty than usual with doubles. They realized how important the doubles is to their matches. 
"Our goal is to come out of the doubles with at least two points in order to take the pres­sure oiT of the singles players," Kozacik said. 
In addition to the high level of play, the Belles also faced the problem of playing from 10 
a.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday. They felt this day was long, but everyone else had the same problem. During this long day, Kozaeik said that the Belles ex­perienced a big win. 
The team felt good about their efforts. They realized that their matches would be competitive.

• SAINT MARY'S SOFTBALL 
Belles sweep weekend at home 
Team survives three double headers in weekend play 
BY LORI GADDIS 
Sports Writer 
The random South Bend weather has been a major fac­tor in the Saint Mary's softball schedule this season. Between hailstorms and snowstorms, the Belles have been unable to play many games and have been forced to reschedule. This weekend, however, the Belles played with the sun shining and ended up 5-1 for the weekend. 
.On Friday the Belles faced the University of Chicago. Saint Mary's took two from U of C, 7­2 and 12-1. These scores were a result of their tough defense and aggressiveness at the plate. 
Sophomore Andrea Arena went 6 for 8 in the Chicago double header, scoring three runs. Senior Shannon Heise was 5 for 7, scoring 2 runs and adding 3 RBis for the Belles. 
In the second game, senior pitcher Laura Hichter helped her own cause by going 2 for 3 and driving home 4 RBis. The Belles clinched the game in the 4th inning when they drove in 8 runs from 8 hits, capitalizing on two crucial Chicago errors. The Belles' defense was error­free in both games against Chicago. 
On Saturday, Saint Mary's faced Kalamazoo College and split the results 7-6 and 4-9. In the first game, senior Michelle Limb went 2 for 3 and Heise again came through for the Belles when she drove in 2 runs. Senior pitcher Maria Vogel hurled 4 strikeouts against Kalamazoo. 
The second game was a struggle for the Belles as they allowed Kalamazoo to score 7 runs in the third on only 4 hits. After a restructuring, however,

the Belles saw only 10 batters in 3 innings. 
. Saint Mary's bats fell mostly silent after the fourth inning when they scored 3 runs. Kalamazoo scored 2 more runs in the 7th. Only 4 of the 9 Kalamazoo runs were earned. 
"We let them (Kalamazoo) have one big inning," said se­nior Amy Misch. "We let them take us out of our game and we just couldn't get back. We re­ally kept up our intensity for the rest of the game but could not get back what they took from us." 
Sunday was the highlight of the weekend, as the Belles faced Olivet College. The Belles won the first game 7-2. Six of those 7 runs were earned with help from Arena, who went 3-4, freshman Diane Andrews, who went 2 for three and Richter who drove in 3 runs for th~ Belles. Vogel helped her own cause by smashing 3 doubles for her 2 at bats and driving in 1 run. 
The second game looked bleak early for the Belles. Olivet took a big lead in the 4th inning, 6-0. 
Misch drove Richter home in the bottom of the 4th to attempt to even the score. The Belles scored two more runs in the 5th on an Olivet error and a blast by Heise. Then in the 6th inning, the Belles' bats came alive. 
With two more runs under their belts in the sixth and bases loaded with no one out Limb stepped up and drov~ home two runs on a double to right. Freshman Sarah Martin scored on the throw made by Olivet right fielder. Limb then scored at home on a past ball. Olivet then answered in the 7th inning with 3 runs to tie the game, 9-9. 
The bottom of the seventh be­gan with a single by Misch. Freshman Liz Kopp sacrificed to move Misch to second. Then a past ball allowed Misch to move to third. Freshman Kelly Coughlin stepped up for the Belles at that crucial moment and singled up the middle to score Misch and tie the game. This finalized the hectic week­end for the Bellns, lnaving their record at 16-12. 
The weekend was a huge suc­cess for the Belles, as each game was a total team effort. Much of the success this week­end was due to the efforts of the freshmen players for the Belles. 
"The freshmen have been a really important part of the team all year," said Coach Jan Travis. "But this weekend they really stepped up and came through in the clutch." 
Travis went on to explain that she looks to see continued im­provement and is hopeful about future years with these players as a result of the fine perfor­mances this weekend. She also felt that the Belles' mental game was challenged this weekend but the Belles stood up to the test. 
"We really got in a hole in the second game against Olivet," Travis stated. "We were able to step forward this time, bring our mental game up several levels and we have been strug­gling with coming back like that for much of the season." 
The Belles look to another hectic weekend as they host their own tournament. Before that, they face Anderson College on Wednesday at Anderson at 3 p.m.

Referees 
continued from page 20 
erees. After a team has com­mitted ten fouls in a game, they }jegin to shoot a free throw for every foul called after that . 
"Free throws also add an ele­ment to the game," Dayton said. "It makes it so commit­ting a foul is not an absolute game-saver anymore." 
Referees not only exist as a means to control the use of fouling in order to stall a game, but also to maintain order on the court. 
In addition, referees become the focus of crowd approval or disapproval in what can become very intense and heat­ed competition. 
"As the rounds get further, the crowds get larger," Dayton added. "Instead of focusing its anger on the teams, the crowd begins to focus on the referee's calls." 
"They're the ones who get all the abuse in the late rounds." 
Still, some people, players es­pecially, feel that the referees take away from the purity of the game. 
"I don't think there should be referees in Bookstore, I think it should be called by the teams," Brian Ziolkowski of fifth-ranked CCE said. "I think the players have the best perspective on whether or not they are fouled." 
Although Ziolkowski feels that the referees should not be used directly in the game, he added that there presence at the court is warranted. 
"I think a ref should be used only if there is a disagreement and they need a neutral party to decide." 
La Ron Moore, of top-ranked Models, Inc., agrees with hav­ing referees in Bookstore. 
"I think they should be there because sometimes the games get out of control," Moore com­mented. "They keep things

toned down." 

Still, the question remains, does the existence of referees, or lack there of in the early rounds, give teams an advan­tage in the run for the Bookstore title? 
Many teams use physical play and intimidation to overcome many of their early opponents. In the early games, teams don't call the fouls that a referee would call, therefore, giving an advantage to those teams who are more physical and aggres­sive with the ball and off the boards. Players and commis­sioners alike agree on this point. 
"Some teams like that play like it physical and use that to their advantage," Head Commissioner Greg Bieg said. "It works the other way too, though, if you get a team that calls a foul every time down the court." 
Ziolkowski agreed that foul­ing can be used as an advan­tage. 
"It gives a quick, physical team the advantage, especially if they go for a lot of steals and rebound," he concurred. "But it's all part of the game and should stay that way." 

Although controversial, the question of referees will remain that way, because from here on out their presence will be felt and will be a factor in the fate of the silver anniversary of Bookstore Basketball.

One upset and a comedy of errors 
By TIM SHERMAN 
Spons Ediwr 
Bookstore Basketball XXV entered its third week on action yesterday. 
567 games have been played thus far in the tournament and all but three of the 32 seeded teams are still alive and kicking in Bookstore. The third ranked squad fell yesterday as 12th seeded Unusual Suspects was upset by EGO 21-13. Other than that, all went according to plan as the field was reduced to 64. Except in the contest between Breastrokers and Team 17. In a classic Bookstore goof, both teams took the court with a player who had already par­ticipated in the tournament with another team. Bookstore commissioner Dominic Amorosa caught the Breaststrokers error and was obligated to make the violation known. Ironically, a highly observant by-stander noticed that Team 17 also was playing with an illegal player. In accordance with the firm Bookstore rule that such a vio­lation results in a forfeit, both squads were disqualified. 

"I was just around and they (Breastrokers) needed a play­er," said Ty Leverty, the guilty party. "I really didn't think too much about it." 
Apparently, neither did Dave Fritsch who threw caution to the wind and risked his team's eligibility. 
Unfortunately for those involved, the move did not go unnoticed. 
"It is pretty funny that they (the commissioners) caught both of us," said Breastoker Mike Driscoll. "It just shows how much time they spend out here."

ed Velasco. "We were all real determined. We were hungry for this tournament." 
The Irish were charged for singles, after taking the lead. The first victory came at the No. 3 singles. Crabtree came up with the first singles win for the Irish, as she cruised to a 7­6, 6-1, victory over Miami's Victoria Hunt. At this point, the Irish needed two more wins to claim the title. 
Freshman sensation Marisa Velasco quickly followed suit. She won her No. 4 singles match over the Hurricane's Sophie Cortina, 6-2, 6-4. Velasco had an impressive tournament, as she claimed vic­tories in all of her three singles matches. 
"Things just went well for me this weekend," stated Velasco. 
Gowen claimed the final win for the Irish. She captured a win at the No. 5 singles seed 
The Observer· SPORTS 
over Miami's Corine Oosters, 6­2, 6-1. This final win boosted the team to their first ever BIG EAST championship. 
The remaining singles match­es were suspended due to the fact that the Irish had clinched all the possible points needed to claim the title. Louderback noted, "We were even leading the matches that were suspend­ed. Hall rallied back from a one set deficit, and did not lose a game up until the match was called." 
With this win over Miami, the Irish reaped the benefits of in­direct wins over Wisconsin and BYU. 
The Irish also chalked up some more impressive firsts. Louderback was named Big East coach of the year. He led the Irish to a record of 21-6, thus far in the season. "Jay def­initely deserves this award," stated Velasco, "He is a great coach, and he works extremely hard." 
Also the Irish's Hall was named player of the year. Hall has stepped up throughout the season for the team, and now has claimed her spot at No. 1 singles for the Irish. 
"Jennifer played well all weekend, and that is why she won," stated Louderback. "Although, I think that we had eight players out there who could have won the award." 
The Irish still have one regu­lar season match ahead. They face Western Michigan at 3:30 
p.m. at Eck. All the seniors will suit up for the Irish, and senior Sherri Vitale will make her long awaited return. The team is starting to look ahead to the NCAAs.

Big East Champions 
.. 
Tournament proves to be remedy for ailing men's team 
By JOE CAVATO Sports Writer 
After losing a tough match to the Texas Longhorns and suffering their worst loss of the season to the Michigan Wolverines, the Notre Dame men's tennis team seemed to be ailing. 
The Big East Conference tournament proved to be just what the doctor ordered as the Irish swept through the field to come home with the crown. 
"It was a good experience and fun to compete against different schools," junior Ryan Simme said. "They ran it very well and the tournament was a much bigger production than playing in the MCC." 
"I was very impressed with the Conference and the way everything was handled from the banquet to the adminis­trator's meetings," Head Coach Bobby Bayliss praised. "I think it made a great impression on our guys. The Big East is definitely a first class conference." 
The Irish earned the No. 1 seed with a solid regular season and a top thirty national ranking. The host University of Miami Hurricanes proved to be the most formidable foe at the second seed. The newcomers appeared to have little trouble sweeping through the tournament without surrendering a point. 
Eighth-seede Boston College was the first test for the Irish. BC edged Villarfova in their preliminary match 4-3 for the right to face the No. 1 seed, but could not manage a doubles point or even a set.

Refs add to the challenge 
By BETSY BAKER 
Sports Writer 
At the heart of Bookstore Basketball lies an element that surpasses the norms of five-on-five pick-up basketball. In its purest form, Bookstore Basketball includes big plays and even bigger words. 
Up until today, teams have monopolized on this element. But as the field is now narrowed down to sixty-four teams, a new force is intro­duced into Bookstore XXV-that of the referee. 
The question of the presence of referees in Bookstore is a controversial one that includes opinions on both sides of the coin. 
"It is pretty clear that as you get into the later rounds, the strategy of some teams is to foul all the time in order to keep their team alive," Bookstore commissioner Kevin Klau comment­ed. "Having refs eliminates this." 
"As it is, it's pretty physical," he added. "But with referees, a team has to have smarts as op­posed to just fouling their way through the game." 
Commissioner Matt Dayton also cited the fac­tor of free throws that comes with the use of ref-

Irish presence missing in first round of Draft 
By THOMAS SCHLIDT Associate Sports Editor 
Hundreds of fans, scouts and prognosticators try to predict the NFL Draft, and never with any success. This year was no different. 
Nebraska running back Lawrence Phillips was considered the best player in the draft, yet he fell to the sixth pick because of domestic problems. Texas A&M's exciting tailback/kick returner Leeland McElroy and Texas' young dominating defensive end Tony Brackens all were consid­ered among the top 15 players entering the draft. Yet they lasted until the second round, the 32 and 33 picks respectively. 
The Draft didn't fare any differently for the few Irish involved this year. Wide receiver Derrick Mayes had arguably the best hands in the draft, yet many teams questioned his speed. Once thought a mid first round pick, Mayes fell until the end of the second round to the Green Bay Packers, the 56th pick overall. 
Ten other receivers were selected before Mayes, all were considered speedsters except for

Women trounce Miami in front of hometown crowd 
By KATHLEEN LOPEZ Sports Writer 
It was an impressive debut for the Irish. The women's tennis team claimed their first Big East championship this past weekend, and did so in an impressive fash­ion. The Irish achieved their goal, by defeating the Miami Hurricanes in front of their home crowd, 4-0. 
"It was a good weekend for us," stated head coach Jay Louderback, "Sunday went very well for us." 
The Irish were seeded first for the tour­nament, and therefore got the bye in the first round. The team coasted past their second round opponent, the eighth-ranked St. John's. The netters received their first challenge from fourth-ranked Boston College, but they still secured a victory. 
The true test came in the finals against the Miami Hurricanes. "The finals was the tough match for us," stated Louderback. 
According to Louderback, a large num­ber of fans turned out for the match, and they were loud. The Irish came out quick­ly, and claimed the doubles point. 
Seniors Holyn Lord and Wendy Crabtree cruised to a 8-3 win over the Hurricanes' Leanne Gutkin and Victoria Ilunt, at No. 1 doubles. The second-seeded pair of junior Erin Gowen and freshman Jennifer Hall were victorious over their Hurricanes' opponent, 8-6. The No. 3 doubles team consisting of a new pair, sophomores Kelley Olson and Molly Gavin also chalked up a win over Miami, 8-2.
