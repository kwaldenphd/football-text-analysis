ND attends hearing today in sex discrimination case 
by Mark Rust News Editor 

A U.S. District Court judge will rule this afternoon on motions made by the University which would place temporary restraining orders on the plain­tiffs in the Notre Dame sex discrimination case, scheduled to come to trial this fall. 
The hearings today may bring to the surface tensions which have smoldered since the November filing of class action suits by women faculty mem­bers charging the University with sex dtscrimination. 
In the hearings today, the University will contend that the plaintiffs have been soliciting clients from the eligible class members of the case-meaning all tenured and non-tenured faculty women-and giving mis­leading advice at meetings of those class members. 
The restraining orders asked for by the University would essentially be "gag" rulings prohibiting attorneys for Del­ores Frese and Josephine Ford­the two women named as principals in separate class action suits-from holding meet­ings and otherwise cori_lmunica­ting with other potential mem­bers of the class action suit. 
The University will today enter as their principle evi­dence a letter sent by Bridgit Arimond, a member of the staff for the legal firm of Davis, Miner and Barnhill-represen­ting the plaintiffs-to Eltzabeth Gilbert, a University professor and chairoerson of Committee 
W. Committee W is a women's group which includes all w<?men faculty members and ts a sub-committee of the American Association of University Pro­fessors (AAUP). 
According to Gilbert, the group has bee "trying to inform people in and out of the case. We will monitor the case for all people involved." The letter which the University P._lans to enter as evidence of "misleading information" is, according to Gilbert, an example of an attempt to inform those faculty potentially involved in the suit. 
University counsel Phil Fac­cenda was unavailable for com­ment last night. 
Two class action suits hav e been filed by women faculty members. One suit,. Theology Professor Josephine Ford's, will include all six of Notre Dame's tenure women. The second suit, filed by former EngliSh Professor Delores Frese, will include all non-ten­ured women at the University. The suits were filed and certi­fied on Nov. 19 and 20, 1979, res pee ti vel y. 
The Frese suit will include all non-tenured faculty women un­less an individual specifically asks to be exempted. Thus every non-tenured woman fac­ulty member will have to decide whether she will take a passive role in the case and remain on the plaintiffs side or choose to exempt herself and, perhaps, testify for the defense. 

Tensions mount 
Three non-tenured faculty women, who plan to remain in the class action suit and prefer to remain anonymous at this point, say that tensions are building as the deadline nears

Over 85 percent of the faculty at Notre Dame believe the University should develop an 
appeals procedure  for  profes­ 
sors  dented  tenure  or  promo­ 
tions,  according  to  a  survey  

conducted last semester. As a result, the Faculty Senate is drawing up a procedure, Senate President Kenneth Goodpaster said yesterday. . 
''Right now there ts no ap­peals procedure and the faculty deems this an important prob­lem that needs to be remedied between the faculty and the administration,'' Goodpaster said. 
The survey also revealed that faculty members are co~cetn~d with the way the Umverstty determines their teaching quality. Seventy perce;nt say they are dissatisfied wtth the administration's use of student evaluation as the primary source of deciding teaching effectiveness.

SBP!SBVP 
Meeting turns up candidates 
by Michael Onu!rak Senior Copy Editor 
Though no one is officially in the race yet, eleven students showed up at the first organiza­tional meeting for those ''considering to run'' for Student Body President and Student Body Vice President last night in the student government offices. 
At the meeting, potential candidates were given a list of campaign rules, and were told that they may begin forming campaign committees today. The SBP/SBVP election will be held February 25, with ·a runoff, if necessary, scheduled for February 27. 
Senior ~lass Secretary Bob Carey and Junior Class Prestdent Tom Beh11ey headed the list of those who were in attendance at the meeting. Carey, an architecture major, will return for a fifth year of study next yeat. 
Also attending last night's meeting were former Sophomore Class President Jim Veraldi, Keenan Hall President Paul Riehle, and student government liason to the CLC and HPC Frank Guilfoyle. 
Among the others who are considering a run for SBP or SBVP were Ed Bylina, Torsten Marshall, Jim "Slatts" Slattery, "Uncle" Keith Cooper, Jim White, Randy McNally, and another student who wished to remain unidenti­alternative festival, a sugges­tion that was made by Carter.

The USOC Executive Board voted unanimously Saturday to support Carter's request to seek a transfer, postponement, or cancellation of the Moscow games unless the Soviets with­draw their troops from Afghan­istan by Feb. 20. 
If the International Olympic Committee, which has sole responsibility for the . games, refuses the request -an action USOC President Robert J. Kane has said he considers likely -the USOC will meet to decide if American athletes will enter the competition. 
The executive board vote -68 of the board's 86 members were present -came after a 2 1I 2 ­hour plea from the Carter administration. Carter's re­quest has been backed by some 
U.S. allies, including Canada. 
Carter, returning to the White House last night from Camp David, Md., where he spent the weekend, was asked if he were pleased by the executive board's action backing his de­mands on the Olympics. "Yes, very much so,'' he replied. 
Don Miller, USOC executive director, said yesterday he be­lieved a sports festival would be feasible but would not specify particular dates the event could be held. He did say the event might be staged at the same time as the Olympics were going on in Moscow.

Islamic representatives meet to denounce Russia ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -The Soviet Military intervention in Afghanistan threatens world peace and the security of small nations everywhere, Pakistan's president warned yesterday at the start of an emergency three-day meeting of Islamtc foreign ministers. Afghanistan boycotted the session. "We view this development with the utmost apprehension because unless the trend to subjugate small countries through the use of force is arrested in time, world peace and the independent existence of small countries would be endangered," said Gen. Mohammed Zia ui-Hag, the Pakistani president. He also told the Kremlin the only way it "can effectively restore trust and cooperation (with) the Islamic world'' is to pull its troops from Afghanistan. Secretary ofArmyfavors 'registering women for draft· WASHINGTON (AP) -Secretary of the Army Clifford L. Alexander]r. said Sunday he favors registering women for the draft, though he stressed he was against resuming the draft itself at this point. Alexander also said he was opposed to stationing U.S. soldiers in Pakistan -one suggestion for stabilizing Southwest Asia -but felt it would ''be useful'' for the American military to have bases available somewhere in the Persian Gulf area. Reagan considers blockade to hinderRussian transpo NEW YORK (AP)-Republican presidential hopefulRonald Reagan said Sunday if he were president he would consider a blockade of Cuba in retaliation for the Soviet armed intervention in Afghanistan. ''I'm suggesting that we might blockade Cuba and stop che transportation back and forth of Russian arms. Soviet military, their submarines are based there," Reagan told interviewer Dan Rather on CBS's "60 Minutes." Reagan's remarks were part of a criticism he made of President Caner's foreign policy and what Reagan, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, said was a failure to send the "proper signals" to the Soviet Union. Weather Mostly cloudy Monday. Highs near 20. Cl?udy ~onday night with a 50 percent chance of snow developmg dunng the ni~ht and continuing Tuesday. Lows Monday night near ten. Htghs Tuesday in the low 20s.  (continued from page 1] No site for the sports festival was named although Colorado Springs, which was host of two previous summer events and is the home of an Olympic train­ing center, was the strongest possibility. It was also under­stood that Montreal, scene of the 1976 Olympic Games would also be considered as well as a PhiladelJ?hia. A nauonal sports festival would not require any sanction from the IOC, however, if athletes from other countries were to participate in it or if it was held outside the United States, there would be a re­quirement for approval from an international governing body. A member of the executive board said yesterday that Car­ter will press Congress for a bill to underwrite expenses of an alternate site for U. S. athletes to compete if the country boy­cotts the Moscow games. In a telephone interview with the Cincinnati Enquirer from Colorado Springs, USOC execu­tive board member Rolly Schwartz said the committee has been assured of Carter's support for alternate site fund­ing by White House General Council Lloyd Cutler. ''He assured us that the president would underwrite any type of bill that would assure us revenue so that the athletes can compete." Schwartz said. Kane said Saturday that the Executive Board was "buying more time" by approving the resolution because the USOC has until May 24 to decide whether to enter a U.S. team in the Summer Games. "We'll deal with it when we have to," he said. "Circum­stances will change, we hope for the better, but we're not clairvoyant, so we don't know."

(AP) -Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, whose apparent victory in Iran's first presidentiaL election has been taken as an encourag­ing sign for the American hostages in Tehran, said yester­day a solution to the crisis "becomes attainable" if the United States does not meddle in Iranian affairs. 
At a news conference at his campaign headquarters in Teh­ran, the Iranian finance minis­ter, a dose associ:::.te of Iranian leade. A":>tollah Ruhollah Khomeini, also said foreign reporters should be allowed unrestricted access to Iran even iffalse and distorted reports are sent to the rest of the world. 
"False reports are better than no reports or reports from a long distance," he said -an apparent reference to the ex­pulsion of U.S.[ournalists from Iran on Jan. 18. 
Unofficial returns reported Bani Sadr had received a whop­ping 75 percent of votes cast in Iran's first presidential elec­tion. Offictal returns were expected today. Iran has 22 million eligible voters. 
''It has been asked how we are to resolve the U.S. Embassy crisis," Tehran radio quoted Bani Sadr as telling the jour­nalists in a broadcast monitored in London. 
''The solution to the crisis is not wholly up to us, only a part of it concerns the Iraman gov­ernment." A solution will come, he continued, when the 
U.S. government tells Ameri­cans and other world citizens that it will "desist from expan­sionist policy and domination over other nations and when it concedes the right to our people to pursue criminals anywhere in the world." He did not elaborate. 
During his talk with reporters, Bani Sadr did not mention by name deposed Shah Moham­mad Reza Pahlavi. Islamic militants holding the Ameri­cans hostage for 12 weeks have demanded the shah, living in Panama, be returned to face trial before-the Americans are released. 
In another development, the 
son of Iranian leader Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini said his 
father would be transferred 
from an intensive care unit to 
an ordinary hospital ward if he 
continued to be listed in satis­
factory condition, Tehran radio 
reported. 
''There is no cause for worry, and the Imam (spiritual leader) is feeling very well," Ahmad Khomeini said in the radio broadcast, monitored in Lon­don. He said his father had been examined by doctors Sun­day morning and that his pulse and blood pressure was normal. The ayatollah was taken to a 
Tehran hospital's cardiology 
department from his home in 
the holy city of Qom W ednes­
day for what his docto~s des­
cribed as a minor heart ailment. 
S.M.C. supporters to organize 
The Saint Mary's Spiritual Commission is sponsoring a Students' Mission Care, (SMC) to promote support of the Holy Cross Sisters' missions. 
There will be a meeting tonight at 6:30 p.m. in the Student Government office in Regina Hall for students inter­ested in working with S.M.C. Students interested can call Ann Hesslau (5409) or Kathleen Hackett (4154).

Evans' fund begins operation 
The Joseph Evans Memorial Fund is now in full operation, according to one of its co­founders, Barb Budde, a grad­uate theology student. "We were all so shocked to hear about Joe's death last year," she said, referring to the late philosophy ,professor who pass­ed away tn late August. "That's why Tom and I decided to start the fund.'' 
According to Tom Hamel, a senior psychology major, the purpose of the fund is to raise enough money to ,put up a monument or plaque tn Evans's memory. "Actually, I can't take full credit for starting the fund; it was originally suggest­ed to me by my rector, Fr. Matthew Miceli, that maybe the University might be interested in putting up a memorial for him over by the 1 
1
crossroads.'' (The crossroads refers to the brick paths which ' converge on the fountain in front of Nieuwland Science Hall.) "lt was one of Joe's favorite places on campus, one . 
1
which he often mentioned in his 
writings," added Budde. 
I 
Hamel approached the ad­ministration with his idea, which received some support. ·'I was told that we could go ahead and put up a monument, but they (the administration) were concerned about the prob­lem of establishing a precedent, so they declined to finance the project." 
"It's too bad about the money," noted Budde. "Fr. Hesburgh wrote us, telling us that he liked the idea, and he gave us permission to rename the area, the Joseph Evans Memorial Crossroads, but now we have to turn to Joe's former students and the afumni to help up out." 
Any questions concerning the fund can be directed to either Budde or Hamt>' by ca":ng 1420 or 7'172. Dv ~ion· r 1n be n;,lt 1 ... l directly. t 1 the ~ .h Lv"-<ilS Memonal F :Jr l;r,;.; 4!tj, Notre Dame, .i~" ,:,,)Jo.

tudents gather for'Urban Plunge 
by Maribeth Moran Sta/fReporter 
 Over two hundred and forty students gathered last night in the library auditorium for the seventh Urban Plunge follow­. up session. After a short general meeting led by Plunge co-ordinator Reg Weissart, students adjourned to the homes of faculty and admini­stration members to discuss 
their 'experience. 
The Urban Plunge is a one credit course offe.r:ed jointly by the Notre Dame Theology De­partment and the Institute for Religous Studies. It is organiz­. ed through the Center for 
Experiential Learning, whose 
director, the Msgr. ] ack 
Egan, is a veteran of Catholic­
Urban ministry for the past 
twenty years. 
Any student interested in 
making an Urban Plunge must 
first file an application, attend 
the orientation workshop, make 
the Plunge itself into the par­
ticular city, and then attend a 
follow up discussion group. 
This year some 240 students 
journeyed to 42 different cities 
to view both the Church's and 
the government's role in pur­
suing social justice. These 
figures re~resent a 20 percent 
increase 10 the number of 
students enrolled in the pro­
gram. 

All participants toured both 
social and Catholic relief agen­
cies in their attempt to under­
stand the implications of inner­
city poverty.

that members of the class action ~uit mayJ'epora~ize their promotwns an appomtments m the future. The letter from Arimond to Gilbert reported that a "number of questions about the possibility of retalia­tion by Notre Dame'' were raised by participants in the December 11 meeting. 
In one example of the current state of tensions between facul­ty and administrators, Gilbert related an incident involving a phone conversation between herselfand one administrator in which Gilbert intended to ask a question unrelated to the suit. According toGilbert, "He ask-was remarkable. My own suburban parish does consider­ably less. Evangelism and social service was mixed," said a d'unior from Fort-Wayne In iana who made the Plunge in Indianapolis. 
In a discussion group at the 
home  of  Dean  of  Students  
] ames  Roemer  and  his  wife  
Mary Anne,  several  students  

discussed their reaction to the Plunge. Chris Block, Mark Reddaway, Eva Marie Cekaitis, ] ane Ryan, Tom Hawley and Kelly Gaffney made the trip to six different cities. 
While their experience varied widely, the general con census was that the Church was an active leader in the parishes they visited in the pursuit of soctal justice. 
The Urban Plunge does not end at the conclusion of last night's discussion group. Fol­low-up programs mclude working in centers during the summer, and CILA workshops. 
The Urban Plunge is made possible by the volunteer work of the Urban Plunge Task Force who work many hours to make the Plunge a reality. 
Along with admimstrative per­sonnel Fr. Don McNeill, Reg Weissart, and Mark Van Wassenhove, several students coordinated this year's Plunge. Leo Latz, Louis Reifschneider, Mark Carney, Mary Monroe, Kay Tepas, Kelly McCauley, John Pinter, Alicia Puente, and Mary Cohan were responsible for organizing the course. 
Saint Mary's College sponors _ 'Artist in Residence Pr~gram' 
by Mary Kay Leydon 
Saint Mary's College, under the direction of Carol Ann Carter, assistant professor of art, is sponsoring an ''Artist in Residence Program'' to bring proffesional artists and their works to the attention of the community. 
New York artist Elena Borstein spent last week at Saint Mary's giving demonstra­tions and lectures to the students and faculty. Borstein is currently on ~<>hr~ · .,, f -m York College ox ..._ ~ ..,·:~·sity 
though the matter I wanted to 
speak with him about had 
nothing to do with the suit." 
"The issue in these hearings 
is informed consent,'' Gilbert 
said yesterday. 

''The women faculty mem­
bers did not institute this suit. 
We became involved in it at the 
end of November. When some­
one involves you in a case like 
this it is important that you 
know what is happening. That is why we had the meeting with (Arimond)." 
According to the particip­ants, Arimond was requested to summarize the meettng in the form of a letter for those class members who were not able to attend the early afternoon meeting of Dec. 11, 1979. The letter Arimond sent, dated Dec. 28, described the nature of class action suits and sexual discrimination suits in general, and recorded the history of the two Notre Dame suits in partie­ular. 
The letter explained that class action suit~ generally proceed in two stages. First, the lawyers in the Ford and 
Frese cases will try to provethat patterns of discrimination against women exist. If the 
lawyers can prove this point,
according to the letter, "There will very likely be a second proceeding in which individual 
~lass members present their claims for what they are owed.'' The deadline for women fac­ulty members to exempt them­selves from the class action suit has been set for Friday, tho­ugh sources close to the case say that the deadline may be moved back as far as two weeks at the hearing today. 
of New York, where she is an assistant professor of art. She recieved a bachelor's degree from Skidmore College and a bachelor's and a master's from University of Pennsylvania. 
Ten years ago, Borstein had some of her works shown at the ''Women's Co-Operative Gallery'' in New York. This led to her first show at the Andre Zarre Gallery, New York, in 1978. She has subsequently had another exhibition there as well as other galleries in New York and Washington D.C. Some of her works are also on dis~lay in permanent col­lections at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. 
Borstein, using paints and ~astels, concentrates on arch­Itectural spaces. The paint­ings are usually contemporary narratives using buildings as symbols rather than structures. Borstein commented "My paintin~s are to be u~iversal, there ts no specific time or place, the painting is its own world.'' 
The structures she paints are Mediterranean type, adapted from photographs taken of buildings while traveling in Greece. She has made four such trips. 
The SMC art department host­ed an artists reception last Friday night for two exhibits. In addition to Borstein's work, a 
two  man  show  featuring  
sculpture  by  Lie  Sido  and  
paintings  by  Greg  Huebner  
wer~  .<l;lso  highlighted.  Both  

exhtbmons will be on display until February-at Moreau Gallery, SMC. Gallery hours are 9-11 a.m. and 12';30-3:00 
p.m. Tuesday through Friday. Saturday and Suuday hours are 12:30-4:00 p.m.

A Mass 10 honor 0f the feast of St. Thoma;, A.qt..inas will be celebrated today at 5 p.m. in Alumni Hall Chapel. Marvin O'Connell, chairman of the history department, will be the principal celebrant and preach the homily.

In Response to liberalism 
Joseph Bosco andJohn Murphy. 
Prof. Norling's scathing attack, "The Poverty of Liberalism" (The Observer, Jan. 18), poses seve~al ~hetoric~l questions. Although Prof. Norltng Is speakmg from a completely different paradigm from that of those he loathes, we will attemft to address his questions which are of crucia importance in light of our current national problems. 
Prof. ~orling .di.splays an excessi e fear of commumsm ·remmiscent of the McCarthyism of the 1950s. In his concern over the purported ''Cea~eless struggle; of the Free World to escape the totls ofcommumst thralldom,'' he loses sight of the meaning of ''free world. '' 
Freedom involves not only unrestricted entrepreneurial opportunities, but also the freedom to correct major social problems. If a society sees extreme inequity of income distribution as an injustice and a hindrance to . further development, would Prof. Norling not grant the members of that society the self­
. determination necessary to bring about change? 
Donald Duncan, a veteran of fifteen years in the U.S. Army, including eighteen months as a Green Beret in Vietnam, observed after rejecting a field com!llission in 1967: 
''Every time a people decides to fight for self-dete;mination, we. blame it on the commun.zsts; kY contznu_ally giving the commumsts cre~zt for all soczal changes in areas where the mazntenance of the status quo zs suzcide, we buzld their prestige. Corrupt and dictatorial governments responsible for the ~ondition! t;Jhich breea revolts yell .Communzsts! and on _the theory that anything zs better than commumsm, we rush to their aid. As. a result, fewer look to our government for guzdance and more turn to the communists as f.heir onlY, source of help -and our propaganda once agazn becomes fact." [The New Legions p. 251) ' 
In short, this overwhelming fear of communism has so blinded us to necessary social change that once-friendly nations have repeatedly exploded in anti-American revolution. 
The United States as. a nation is held responsible abroad for the behavior of trans­national corporations (1NC), in large part because our government actively pursues the 1NCs interests. The U.S. government, however, should represent the interests of our country as a whole. While 1NCs naturally seek to maximize profits (an activity we don't ~egrudge), U.S. interests are more long-range 
{t.e. to continue trade and maintain good relations with the people and government of the country). This is the enlightened self-interest of ~he U.S. While it may not yield such high profits 111 the short run, long-term benefits outweigh this cost for the U.S. 1f it allows for long-term trade. Changes must be allowed to occur, and indeed should be encouraged if serious discontent arises. 1NCs will (and do) resist all changes, but our national interest demands that we be open to the kind of change which assures long-term friendship and trade. The pursuit of national interest would assure 
administration of either institution. The news is reponed as accurately and

If Chilean discontent erupts into an anti-:anierican revolution, it will be due 
mpart to Chase's actions. While 1NCs ideally consider these ramifications of their activity, their profit considerations outweigh long-term goals.

Furthermore, why does Prof. Norling include 1 the Philippines of Marcos and Pinochet's Chile as part of the free world? Describing these 
countries as free ~s as preposterous as calling Poland a free natton. As citizens opposed to government or business support of these repressive regimes, 
we have a responsibility t\9 protest.

Nosferatu the Vampyre 
Directed by Werner Herzog 
Starring Klaus Kinski, Isabelle Adjani, BronoGanz 
As long as he has box office appeal, the Count of Transylvania is eternally doomed to chomp on the necks of the unlucky and/or unwary for the benefit of the movie-going public. Recent films, outstanding only in their mediocrity, have not done him much justice. Happily, German director Werner Herzog has restored elegance and terror to the celluloid Dracula with his latest film ''Nosferatu the Yampyre.'' 
Herzog, whose previous films in­clude such critically acclaimed works as "Signs of Life", "Aguirre, the Wrath of God", and "Stroszek" is deeply indebted to F. W. MURNAU and his 1923 classic ''Nosferatu: Symphony of Horrors''. Murnau's Nosferatu was no urbane Hungarian nobleman, but rather a spectre of the totalitarian threat menacing the Germany of the Weimar Republic, a gruesome creature with bat-like ears, over-sized incisors, and a death-pale, emanciated face.

"I think, therefore, I dn'nk. " ·-motto, ITK 
As I was quietly strolling back to my 
humble abode last Friday eveningon 
the South Quad, I was intercepted 
bc:hind Badin by a motley crew of 
ski-masked thugs. One of them put a 
loaded bottle ofHeineken to my head 
while another blindfolded me. 

"Hey fellas, there's been some 
mistake.'' 

"Quiet, you knave. We know who 
you are. Our Minister of Propa~anda 
says if we are to make a signrficant 
impact, we have to kidnap you for 
publicity purposes. You're Stewart, 
right?" 

"Yeah, but I ain't no Iranian 
either." 
"Shut up, and follow us." 

And I did, much to my delight and 
subsequent enlightenment. 

.John Belushi, watch out. Notre Dame's version of a Catholic Animal House has finally arrived on the South Quad. Happy days are here agatn. 
What ensued was one of the wackiest nights, and incontestably the best damn partying in my two years at du Lac. Despite popular administrative doubletalk to the contrary, fraternity is alive and kicking. Notre Da.ne's onliest1 I Tappa Kegga, is kicking up a storm in one of the more reputable halls on campus. Due to their notorious reputation, the result of innumerable orgiastic parties and midnight sallies into the local South Bend community, I am sworn to secrecy as to the exact location of this group of ribald,, 
raunchy hedonists. 

Besides, if I slander their hall, these hearty revellers persuasively convinced me of my certain demise upon publication. 
Hey, I enjoy life. Not to mention the fact that I Tappa Kegga is sponsoring it's biggest bash of the year this Friday. And I'm invited. I wouldn't mtss tt for the world. 
Their dramatic kidnapping brought me to their inner sanctum, where a 
worship service soon commenced. A candle was lit, and placed upon the holy of holies, the KEG. And what a beautiful silver, cool KEG it was! All 25 members ofITK knelt in adoration on one knee, then piously recited the 
Prayer ofInebnation: 
''Our KEG, who art zn thy Frathouse Hallowed by they head. ' Th_y foam wz/1 come Thy wz/1 be done . On the jlo~r, as it is whzle standing. Grve us thzs day our dazly buzz 
Andforgive us our wuffs As _we forgive those who wulfed agaznst us Lead us not mto delzn.um But deliver us from sobrietyAmen.'' 
. The party began at 1:45am, lasting ttl! after 5. Rank exhibitionism was the order of the evening, as twelve members did a live jam session of Boston's More Than A Feeling. 
ITK's rendition was more exciting than Boston's show last March at the ACC. 
Then the fun began. Brother Hop-a-long proved his divinity by consuming a large mug of beer while 
standing on his head. During this 
feat; I noticed his ankle was in a cast. 
Someone informed me it was broken. 
For an encore, Brother Hop bit a full 
can of beer in half, and sucked down 
the contents with the ease of Jean 
Claude Killy skiing the ·slopes of 
Aspen. He never wasted a drop. 
That's conservation! 
ITK was the brainchild of Brother 
Puno, who conceived the idea over 
the summer during a drunken stupor 
that landed him in the gutter of NY's 
Bowery district. He brought his 
Messianic message of salvation via 
inebriation to the socially deprived of 
du Lac. Although the rector 
considers him a prophet of perdition, 
his followers believe him to be an 
apostle of assininity · and therefore 
worthy of deification. 
The leaders ofITK say that unity of 
the section's members has been a 
primary benefit of forming the 
fraternity. Once th~ boys approved, 
shirts were 2!dered, saying "ITK-­
Notre Dame's Only Real Frat." But 
the real reason for their over­whelming success is because the frat has fun. ITK already has done more to eradicate boredom at du Lac than any group on campus, with the possible exception of the Chess Club. 
Recently, the leaders ordered a pleasure lobotomy on rhe most boring member of the secuon. The one time pre-med abandoned his studres. converted to Islam and led a raid on nearby Bethel College, where the President's sign was ceremoniously abducted. Now it is a cherished momento of ITK. 
In addition, an Iranian Task Force 
Christopher A. Stewart 
was established, which intends to free the hostages by dropping frozen kegs on the students in Tehran. 
Halloween saw an ITK strike force liberate 25 well-lit pumpkins throug­out the South Bend community. The attack was strangely similar to the Israeli Entebbe raid of '76. 
One massive assault was registered in Azat's Restaurant, where a clandestine ITK operation deployed 2 megaton pancakes, a host of sugar packets and soggy eggs against the dour forces of perfidy (the management). 
One brooding Brother, with a 3. 7 cum, has a bizarre penchant for indiscrimin~tely assaulting innoc~nt, unsuspecting water fountatns. Legend has it that the Campaign for Notre Dame, wdl over its original goal of $130 million, is raising the extra moola to compensate for the occasional excess of frustrated members of ITK. This frustration is rooted in the social, sexual and ·cademic ambience of ND, according to high ranking officials of ITK.

Kramer vs. Kramer: 



The Challenge To Be 
Christopher A. Stewart 
There are moments in film when a viewer realizes that what is being 
witnessed is an epochal event, a breathtakingly momentous experience. Such 
artistic power, beauty and realism has rarely been captured in a more 
convincing manner than in the movie "Kramer vs. Kramer." 
For a full 20 minutes after the film's electrifying climax, I was speechless, 
utterly transfixed by the sheer force of a film whose theme--divorce, and the 
ensuing court battle over a child-_-is so common as to be uninspiring. 
Not so ''Kramer vs. Kramer.'' Here we witness the comic/tragic aspects of 
people, marriage, parenting, the Madison Ave. rat race, friendship, and the 
crushing paradoxes and ironies inherent in life. We see with vivid clarity the 
awesome price people will pay for freedom and love, and how they will stop at 
nothing to achieve their ends, in this case custody of a child. ' 
Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) is the advertising executive on the up and 
up. While he's out making a living, he's completely forfeited his 
commitment to his wife joanna (Meryl Streep) and son Billy Gustin Henry). 
Describing Ted as a workaholic is an understatement, since he realizes his job 
is a "25 hour a day, eight days a week" endeavor. 
However, Joanna is not your typical "grin and bear it" wife. Realizing the 
marriage she's in to be hopeless, she abandons her family in a search for self, 
heading for the West Coast where she'll undergo analysis and stay for the 
next 15 months. Before leaving, she relinquishes her American Express and 
Bloomingdale's credit cards to Ted, so the audience knows this woman is 
serious. Life with~ut the acco_utrements of Blool?ingdale's can be a bitch..

development is poignantly captured in the schoolyard scene the morning after

Too numerous to do justice to in this brief vnopsis, some of the highlights 
include: the traumatic park scene, when Billy is injured and Ted races him to a crosstown hospital dtsregarding his own safety as he bolts out into Fifth and Park Avenue traffic; the dinner confrontation over chocolate chip ice cream; B!lly meeti~g Phylis, ~ed's l?,ver, a~ the bathroom door, nakedv1.nd asked her 'Do you hke fned chtcken? ; Ted s relentless search for a new )ob, particularly the confrontational moment with his boss-to-be in which Ted 
demands an immediate response to his job inquiry. He got it. 
It was confrontational fllm at its sizzling, realistic best. It's moments like 
these when all the pretentious airs and establishmentarian etiquette is 
judiciously disc~ded because of some overriding concern, in this {;ase Ted's 
child. His desperation was chilling; it needed attention and resolution then 
and there in that office, not later. . 
The court scenes were shattering, dericting ·the demise of a relationship

moments: Ted's lawyer (Howard Duff) hounding Joanna into confessing her

being grilled about his firing and inconstancy at work It was then thatJoanna 
began to see that Ted, too, has sweated and suffered for Billy with a passion 
not unlike her own. 
The court's decision is crushing to Ted and Billy. The park scene, when 
Billy is told the result, is simply devastating ("Daddy, if you get lonesome, 
you call me up, OK?"). If tears don't come to your eyes by then, you're either 
a closet sadist or emotionally dead. From the park, the film catapults back to 
the apartment for the final breakfast scene, a subdued affair in striking 
contrast to the original fiasco. This one is controlled, almost perfect. Father

The denouement is as fitting as it is tragic, a vindication to the spirits of all 
involved. It manifests and accentuates the human spirit in all its 
vulnerability, strength, and ambiguity. It is an ending worthy of life, for it 
ennobles rather than demeans. It uplifts while it remains humble. 
Dustin Hoffman is magnificent. He renders a penetrating, superb 
performance. If he doesn't win the Oscar, I'll stop drinking Perrier. Meryl 
Streep is marvelously affecting, especially in her courtroom scenes, and 
likewise deserves kudos of the hi~hest order. Justin Henry is the guilessly

The painstaking adjustments to the modern world, by parent and child, is 
captured in ''Kramer vs.Kramer. '' We learn that women aren't the only-ones 
being liberated in this film; so are men. Men like Ted, freed from his 
obsessive preoccupation with advancement and success to see his need to love 
others, and be loved by l.d:H~m in return. And Billy, symbol of children 
everywhere: captives of warring parents suffering the indignities of 
emotional and psychological ping-pong which ultimately determines the .beauty of ugliness of tbc1r future lives. ·

The facts are startling. Experts estimate that about half of all automobile occu­pant fatalities last year might have been avoided if the people had been wearing seat belts. That's because injuries occur when the car stops abruptly and the occupants are thrown against the car's interior. Belts prevent this. 
Many people say they seat belts protect passengers from severe injuries, allowing them to escape more quickly.· Another popular rationaliza­tion: you'll be saved by being thrown clear of the car. Here again, research has proved that to be untrue-you are almost always safer inside the car.

Two other issues of concern are salaries and retirement. Most of the faculty are discon­tent with their present salaries and do not feel they are keeping up with inflation, Goodp_aster said. 
The survey showed that 67 percent of faculty members think retirement· should not be confined to a~e. Goodpaster explained, ''Rtght now the re­tirement age is 65. In 1982, it will be 70. Most professors think retirement should come when the teacher is no longer an asset at the University.'' He added that this would be diffi­cult to determine.

Batill explained, "This ques­tion was stacked to be answered yes." Therefore, he said, it was an irrelevant question and the Senate Faculty will not act on it. Batill did note, however, that the senior death march was not the kind of thing that you want to see young men and women doing a few months before they go out in the real world.'' 
The reason for the faculty survey, Goodpaster explained, was to focus the Senate on the issues of the faculty at lar~e. The Senate has been criticized in the past as not being representative of the faculty.

If you're one of those people who don't use belts for one reason or another, please thinkcarefullyaboutyourmo­tivations. Are your objections to seat belts based on the facts or on rationalizations? 
Here are a few of the common rationalizations. 
Many people say they are afraid of being trapped in· a car by a seat belt. In fact, in the vast majority of cases, but rationalize it's not worth the trouble to buckle up for short trips. The numbers tell a different story: 80% of all automobile accidents causing

When you're the driver, you have the psychological authority to convince all of the passengers that they should wear seatbelts. It has been shown that in a car, the driver is considered to be an authority figure. A simple reminder from you may help save someone's life.

The 28th Annual Junior Parents' Weekend is expected to be as successful as it was last year in terms of attendance and activities. "We are ahead of schedule in comparison to last year,'' said Weekend Chairman 
Jim Riedman. 
Despite an incomplete com­puter listing which omitted the names of 50-75 juniors, approx­imately 1800 returns from parents have come in. Students whose parents have not re­ceived packets may pick them up in the Student Activities Office. 
Most of the original problems have been resolved. The 
"'rwmmittee hopes to surpass last year's attendance record of 2100. Finance Chairman Steve Burgoon is contacting students who forgot to sign checks or wrote in the wrong amount. Burgoon reminds students that refunds are available for those who have paid, but can no longer attend the activities. He urges these students to notify the committee at least one week before the Weekend, Feb. 22­24. Registration Chairman Keith Melaragno assures juniors whose parents will be arriving late that they can register at the Cocktail Dance Friday evening or Saturday afternoon at LaFortune. A landscape company will decorate Stepan Center for the Cocktail Dance in a garden­party motif. Collegiate ·work­shops will be held within each college Saturday morning.

Junior Parents Weekend 



Numerous activities promise success 
BernardRostker heads Selective Service 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The man charged with carrying 
out Prestdent Carter's man­date to reinstate draft registra­tion was an Army officer during the Vietnam war with a desk job in Washington. 
Bernard Rostker, 35, the new director of the Selective Service System, was trained to be a tank commander but was as­signed to work in the office of an assistant secretary of de­fense in the Pentagon during his rwo years of active duty berween 1968 and 1970. 
Asked in a telephone interview why he didn't serve in Vietnam, Rostker said, "I don't know. I was a graduate student finish­ing up my Ph.D. in economics. I'm sure that had an impact. They (at the Pentagon) were interested in bright young fel­lows.'' 
Did he consider volunteering for Vietnam duty? 
"I was in the service, Rostker said, his voice rising. ''I went where I was told to go. I served. I did not go to Vietnam. I would have gone wherever they sent me." 
Rostker, who grew up in the Bronx, was a member of the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) as a student at New York University and was com­missioned a lieutenant upon graduation. During his military service and in the decade since then, he has specialized in military manpower problems. 
Last fall, at a time when Carter was saying he had no plans to register anyone, Rostker took over as head of the Selective Service, an agency with only 98 employees -tiny by Washing­ton standards -and a budget of $7 million. 
Carter plans to get the agency an immediate $10 million to carry out his new plan, and the agency anticipates seeking as much as $22 million for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. 
Since last November, Rostker said, he has spent his time rebuilding an emergency-pre­paredness system for draft registration, just in case it became necessary. 
It wasn't until late Wednesday afternoon that Rostker learned for sure that his sleepy little agency would be tossed a political hot potato. 
Rostker said he had hints last week that Carter was consider­ing reinstating the draft. But he didn't get the final word until a few hours before Carter used his State of the Union address to inform the rest of the nation of his plan. 
Rostker said he has not met with Carter-or anyone from the White House to discuss the complexities ofstarting up draft registration. 
Instead, he said, he has work­_ed with the task force preparing a report for Congress, due Feb. 9, on various aspects of the Selective Service System. 
By law, all males aged 18 to 26 are eligible for the draft -and they number about 16 million. 
The president has legal au­thority to order a draft registra­tion, but he would neea con­gressional approval to authorize registering women.

Logan and DeNat exchanged second period goals to make it 4-4~ but the Irish exploded for three unanswered tallies in the third to put the game out or reach.

Tankers split weekend pair 
by Michael Ortman Sports Wn'ter 

You win some, you lose some, and some get rained out. 
The Irish swimmers encount­ered developments on all three fronts this weekend as they dumped Northern Illinois on Friday afternoon, 62-497 lost to midwest power Bradley on Sat­urday, 69-44, and announced that this coming Friday's dual meet with visiting Texas A&M has been cancelled because of travel complications on the part of the Aggies. 
The Huskies arrived Friday with an 18 man roster, almost four times as many as competed against the Irish last winter in Dekalb. Coach Orrville Ker­sten, who had a paltry five swimmers at the close of the 1978-79 season because of in­ternal problems, brought along a strong diving corp but little 
I else as the Irish took every ~wimming event they competed 10. The Northern Illinois meet marked the return of sopho­more Mike Shepardson to the Irish lineup. The Ft. Lauder­dale, Fla. native was thought to be out for the season with severe bursitis in his shoulders. Yet Shepardson surprised ev­eryone, swimming the freestyle leg on the winning 400-yard medley relay team and finish­ing first in the 100-yard free­style in a respectable :50.3 seconds. The atmosphere at the Rock­ne Memorial Pool quickly chan­

' instead of shooting it.'' Kin~'s.beave bounced off the right s1de of the backboard, and Phelps had the 200th win of his collegiate coaching career. Notre Dame played without the services of Kelly Tripucka, who was hospitalized on Friday with what is belif'ved to be back SD<l'. "1S. ''\\''hen 1l1~1t 1·· .. ~-·:t team, we just raliK,1 .. :,~;1d 1., .nd did the things wt· i.;;,l ,., do." Phelps said. WitL Tnpucka out, Orlando Woolridge moved to 
ged, however, as Notre Dame 
returned to the water less than 
20 hours later to face the always 
tough Bradley Braves. 
With memories of last year's 78-35 humiliation at Bradley still fresh in their minds, the determined Irish set out to win the meet-opening 400-yard medley relay, hoping to to take a quick 7-0 advantage. The top Irish team of Glenn Battle, Gary Severyn, Don Casey and Shep­ardson clocked a time of 3:43.7, the fastest by an Irish medley team in two years, yet not worth a single point as the Bradley unit touched just :00.3 seconds ahead. 
The first bright spark for Notre Dame came in the meet's forth event, the 50-yard free­style, where juniors John Kom­ora and Tom Krutsch finished one-two (:22.6 and :22.9 respec­tively( to give the Irish a much needed shot in the arm. Fresh­man Gary Severyn answered with a win in the 200-yard individual medley to pull the Irish to within three, 23-20. But that was as close as the Irish could come as the Braves took first place in each of the remaining eight events and the Irish taking both the second and thrid places in six of the final eight. 
With the season now half over and their record even at 3-3, the Irish have a full week to prepare for Saturday after­noon's home finale against visiting St. Bonaventure. The final five dual meets are all on the road. 
forward with Gilbert Salinas at center. Woolridge responded with one of his best games of the year, tying Jackson for the team scoring lead with 15 points and also grabbing a game-high nine rebounds. 
"If anything, Tripucka's loss is to Notre Dame's advantage," said Maryland coach Lefty Dri­esel. "I thmk that any ttme a player is out that is an advant­age to the other team. I think it was a big psychological advant­age to Notre Dame." 
The victory upped No~re Dame's record to 13-2, while the Terrapins, leaders in the Atlantic Coast Conference, fell to 14-3. Notre Dame travels to Philadelphia to face LaSalle Wednesday night, beginning at 9 p.m. in the Palestra.

Muncie leadsNFC in Pro Bowl 
HONOLULU (AP) -Chuck Muncie of New Orlearis ran for LWO touchdowns and threw a 25-yard halfback option pass to Dallas' Tony Hill for another 
score Sunday to lead the National Conference to a 37-27 victory over the American Conference in the Pro Bowl. 
The victory was the third in a row for the NFC and gave it a 6-4 edge over the AFC in this game, which comes one week after the Super Bowl and officially closes the National Football Leauge season. 
Muncie, selected the most valuable player in the game, had gained 1,198 yards for the Saints this season, broke a 3-3 tie on a 1-yard run with 1:41 gone in the second period, then swept in from 11 yards out with 
5:14 gone in the fourth quarter for the NFC's final touchdown. 
The AFC tied it 10-10 barely four minutes after Muncie's first score on a 1-yard pass from Pittsburgh's Terry Bradshaw to Cleveland's Mike Pruitt.

Griffith leads Louisville 
LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) ­Darrell Griffith scored 27 points to lead seventh-ranked Louis­ville to a 79-7 3 win over Florida State Sunday in a foul-plagued Metro Conference basketball game. 
A total of 47 fouls were whistled in the game, with all 10 starters having at least three fouls apiece and three players, including Griffith, fouling out.

Irish beat Terps 


It's Tracy.  . agatn 
by Mark Perry Sports Editor 

As far a; Tracy Jackson is concerned, he's had enough heroics for one season. 
"I don't want to be put in a situation like that anymore," admittedJackson, whose magic touch has beaten rwo teams in the last seconds this season. "I'd rather win it solid." 
Still, Jackson's clutch driving lay-up came against a team he loves to beat, as the Irish edged Maryland, 64-63, in a nationally televised contest at the ACC on Saturday. 
''I'm always ready to play against Maryland," Jackson said. "In this game, just like the first rwo against them, my adrenalin was flowing. I get personal satisfaction out of beating Maryland." 
Tracy's score came at a desperate moment for the Irish, who had succeeded in blowing seven-point lead, thanks mainly to the efforts Maryland's Albert King, who scored ten of his game-high 21 points in a four minute stretch. With 23 sec­onds left, King scored on a jumper and then stole Notre Dame's inbounds pass for a lay-up that gave the Terps a 63-62 lead. 
by Mark Hannuksela Sports Wn'ter 

It was the Tracy and Shari show at the ACC. 
Once again, Tracy Jackson saved the day for Digger Phelps and his Fighting Irish basket­ball team in a 64-63 win over Maryland. And once again Shari Matvey paced coach Sha: ron Petro's women's basketball team to victory, in a 78-76 decision over Mount Saint J os­eph's College of Cincinnati on Saturday. 
While Jackson's heroics have been commonplace in the last two weeks, Matvey has been Petro's dominant force thro­ughout this 1979-80 season. Saturday, the 6-1 freshman from Austintown, Ohio scored in double figures for the ninth straight game. and 12th out of 
With 15 seconds left, Irish coach Digger Phelps elected not to call timeout. "I looked at the clock and saw 15, and I knew we could get a transition score out of it," Phel.ps said. 
That left It up to Jackson. "I 

knew  there  was  only  a  few  
seconds  left  on  the  clock,''  
Jackson  recalled,  "and  when  

Billy (Hanzlik) threw the ball inbounds, the first thing on my mind was to take it to them." "I saw a few players turning their heads gomg downcourt, and I just wanted to go straight to the hoop," he added. Jack­son drove the length of the floor, put a move on Greg Manning at the right baseline, and layed the ball in the basket. 
Maryland called timeout with four seconds left to get the last, shot, but Hanzlik made sure that King didn't get of a very good one. 
"It looked like Albert really wanted the ball, so I wanted to force him up to get the ball,''· Hanzlik said. "He got it at about the free throw line, so I tried to turn him around once or twice to burn out the clock. 
''When he came down I didn't want him to get in rhythm for a jumper, so I

It's television. Yes dear readers and wavers of dirty socks, the television people are the ones who decide when to play, what time to start the game, what time to end it and, of course, when to call all those unexplaioed timeouts en route. But everyone knows all that. What you aren't aware of are the other things that the NBC peacock has control over. Last Saturday I had the chance to wear a set of NBC headphones and listen to these decisions as they were made ... 
"OK, this is the director in the truck. We're rwo minutes from airtime. Everybody get in position and let's hope we have a good one." 
''Hey chief, what do you mean hope we have a good one? Didn't you read the script? this is gonna be a one-pointer with rwo lead changes in the last 15 seconds."

"How about Lefty, chief? Is he OK?" 
"Yeah, I suppose. See if you can get some powder for the glare.''

Logan's two hat tricks pace sweep over Huskies 
by Bnan Beglane Sports Wn'ter 

HOUGHTON, Mich -The Notre Dame hockey team played the role of the spoiler thi§. weekend, and the biggest spoiler of them all was sophomore Jeff Logan. 
Logan, a native of Grosse Pointe Shores, Mich., collected two hat tricks and sparked the Irish to an 8-5, 7-5 sweep over Michigan Tech Friday and Saturday nights at the MTU Student Ice Arena. The rwo wins spoiled Huskies coach John Macinnes' bid for his 500th victory, but more importantly, skyrocketed Notre Dame from a tie for sixth to third place in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. The Irish have won four games in a row and moved to 10-8 in the league (14-11 overall). Michigan Tech fell to 8-9-1 in the WCHA (14-11-1 overall). 
The sweep also brought Notre Dame coach Lefty Smith to within one victory of his 200th win as coach of the Irish. Smith, in his 12th year at Notre Dame, will have the oppor­tunity to gain No. 200 this weekend when the Irish host Wisconsin (1:30 p.m. faceoff both Saturday and Sunday afternoons at the ACC). 
' 'I think the fact we had our whole lineup intact showed through,'' said Smith. "Having our top three lines healthy improved our offense immensely. Defensively, we've returned to the pairings we used last year and that helped. And it certainly was nice to see 
Jeff (Logan) do so well." 

Log:m broke a 3-3 tie Friday night with his first goal at 17:09 of the first period. Senior Greg Meredith, who totaled rwo goals for the series, made it 5-3 after the first period when he chased Husky starting goalie Darcy Way w!th his 21st goal of the year at 18:40. Rob Polmantuin replaced Way. 
Logan extended the advantage to 6-3 at 4:24 of the second, but Tech's AI Mickalich made it 6-4 with his second power play goal of the night at 
7:26. Notre Dame co-captain Tom Michalek notched his fourth shorthanded goal of the year at 11:27 to make it 7-4, and Logan got his second career hat trick at 14:19 of the second. 
Irish goalie Bob McNamara made 43 saves and collected his eighth win of the year. Way 
and  Polmantuin combined  for  
31 stops.  
. "Sometimes  things  just  go  

nght," said Logan, "and I guess this was just one of those times, I was in the right place at the right time. I don't recall ever getting back to back hat tricks before.'' 
Logan has a good chance at being named Player of the Week for his rwo hats. But getting it the second night was not as easy. 
The Huskies came out flying Saturday night and jumped out to a 3-1 lead in the first 13 minutes. It then literally took ' 'a good knock in the head'' to get the Irish going. 
With 4:19 remaining in the first period, Notre Dame's Don Lucia and Tech's Brent DeNar

"You mean on his nose?" 
"No, his head. Next year we're gonna make a rule that no teams with bald coaches can get on TV. OK we're ready to start. Did you give both coaches a copy of the script?'' 
"Yessir chtef. But Lefty doesn't like the ending. He thinks Hanzlik should foul King and then have King go to the line and miss the free throw. Says it'll make him look like a smarter coach." 
"Tell him sorry, but no way. We used that one rwo years ago in a Notre Dame--UCLA game right here. Remember how Wilkes missed the free throws and Notre Dame won. If Lefty has any more gripes just remind him about that one. Now lets get started." 
"Gotcha chief--Oh, by the way, who was responsible for getting Tripucka out of the game.'' 
''I'm no, sure but it'll sure give AI, Dick and Billy some great stuff to talk about during the ~am~. You know, team l<_:>ses star, team gets msp1red, team goes on to wm. Ah, those guys in publicity are really on the ball.'' 
"Hey chief, isn't it a little early for Hanzlik to get his second foul?'' 
"Not at all. Remember yesterday at the meeting when we decided that getting Hanzlik on the be~ch e~rly would be Maryland's excuse for keepmg It close and even leading at halftime.'' 
"Oh, yeah ... hey, by the way chief, it's getting close to halftime. You wanna have someone get injured so AI and BiJly can argue about whether or not he'II be back?"
