Chinese troops prepare to deal final blowof SE Asian border conflict 
BANGKOK, Thailand [AP] ­

Tens of thousands of Vietnamese and Chinese troops backed by heavy artillery were on the move toward the Vietnamese town of Lang Son and what could be the I· showdown battle of the five-day­I I r old border war , intelligence 
! sources in Bangkok re{>Oned. The sources said Chinese stra­tegists apparently intend to deal a fmal bloodY. blow to the Vieuiamese rrulitary and then to withdraw most of their forces 
from Vietnam within three or four days. 
Japan's K yodo news service quoted a government official in Peking as saying China hopes to end the conflict within a few days, but the unidentified official warned that it might be pro­longed if Vietnam throws it regular army troops into the fighting. 
That appeared to be just what Hanoi was doing yesterday as columns of regular army rein-
Under US pressure 

Iran releases marine 
TEHRAN, Iran [AP] -Under strong pressure from the United States, Iran's new revolutionary government yesterday released a young American Marine accused of finng on Iranians who invaded the U.S. Embassy. 
Sgt. Ken Kraus, 22, of Lan­soale, PA, who had maintained that none of the embassy's guards "fired a shot," was driven through the gates of the embassy compound yesterday evening after one week as a "prisoner of the revolution." He showed no sign of ill treatment. 
White .House spokesman Jody Powell said Carter and Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance "had made it their No. 1 priority'' to free Kraus. 

His mother, Jane Kraus of Lansdale, PA, learned of her son's release from President Caner. She said, "He told us Kenneth is free on American soil in the American Embassy, and they will try to get him home as soon as possible." 
Kraus' arrest coincided with a demand from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini' s reveolutionary com­mittee for the extradition from the United States of Gen. Gholam-Ali Oveissi, former mar­tial law governor of Tehran. 

Oveissi' s riot troops forcibly suppressed anti-shah demonstra­tions following last September's imposition of martial law. He flew to the United States early last month, ostensibly for medi­cal treatment. 
His successor, Gen. Mehoi Rahini, has among eight of the ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi' s generals executed by Islamic fighting squads. 
The Iranian foreign and justic ministries were said to have informed .Khomeini that there was no extradition agreement with the United States. Prior to

forcements were reported rolling north toward Vietnamese-held lang Son, a strategically situated town that for centuries has guarded the approaches from China. 
The troops apparently were relieving battered militia units that bore the defensive burden for the first three days of fight­mg. 
The Soviet news agency Tass, meanwhile, said in a report from Hanoi that Chinese troops com­mitted atrocities against Vietna­mese civilians in areas they captured. Tass, quoting Vietna­mese news reports, charged that the Chinese burned down vil­lages and shot men, women and children.

Roemer defends right to evict students 
by Tom jackman StaffReporter 
Several Notre Dame students have been evicted this year from their dorms as a result of a housing regulation in both Dulac 
(p.40) and the student housing contract, which allows that, 'the University reserves the right, as stated in the housing contract, to make unilateral changes in room­assignment. No reasons need be provtded.' 
Dean ofStudentsJames A. Roe­mer pointed out in a recent interview that several rectors have exercised their right to remove a student, and cited Keenan and ·Dillon as examples this year. He also noted that Flanner and Pangborn judicial boards have -voted to eVIct stu­
Dillon Rector Fr. Daniel Jenky,

Pangborn verdict  was  later  re­ 
pealed..  .  

who has had several students leave his dorm this year, would not discuss specific cases but claimed that ''all of the people who have decided to move offtlus year have only been asked by me to do so.'' 
One student, however, stated yesterday, "I was told, not asked, by my rector to move out, and given one week ... The rector arbitrarily decided I was bad for the hall and gave me no opportu­nity to defend myself." 

While Jenky claimed that he has not exercised his right to eviction, he does be.llcver that "sometimes ·a person's lifestyle just doesn't fit into dorm life, and those people are often happier off campus." He later added that , "Tills might strike you as funny, but we don't really have all that much trouble in Dillon Hall. " 
Roemer added that students who are asked to leave campus as a non-disciplinary action by their rector can appeal to the Adminis­tration's chain of command, starting with Roemer and rising through the Vice President for Srndent Affairs, the Provost and finally the President. 
Any of the latter three can refuse to hear an appeal, Roemer noted, .and each hall's rector does 


Mills securesposition as 1979-BOeditor-in-chief 
Rosemary Mills was elected editor-in-chief of The Observer for the 1979-80 school ytar last night by a majority vote of the advertising, business and production managers, the senior night editor and the editorial board. 
Mills, a junior English major from Bergenfield, NJ, defeated two other candidates for the position which she will assume on March 26. The vote was tallied by Jana Schutt, a member of the Ombudsman election committee. 
Currently serving as editorial editor, Mills began working for the newspaper on the layout staff on which she has served as assistant night editor and night editor. She also has worked for the news department as a staff reporter and senior staff reporter. 
Mills hopes to improve the q,uality of The Observer content, 
noting, ''The paper s new des1gn has made it more unified. 
Now we must focus our attention on the quality of its content." 
have the right to evict any 
student. 

One fact which Roemer stressed 
was that in contractual matters 
such as these, the actions taken 
are non-disci.plinary and do not 
appear on a student's record, 
while disciplinary matters are 
handled through a separate pro­
cess. One student commented 
that he accepted his punishment 
without protest because he did 
not want this sort of blemish on 
his permanent record. 

If the University can utilize this 
power at any time, some students 
raise the question over the neces­
sity of student judicial boards. 
Roemer noted that students 

helped write the DuLac regula­
tion which gives the University 
these abilities. However, he 
added that j-boards are not 
useless, and that their use this 
year has grown greatly. 

Student Body President Andy 
McKenna substantiated this view 
acknowledging that j-boards use 
had increased, though 'they just 
came into widespread use last 
year. ' 

'There was almost no use in 
previous years, and one of the 
rectors was completely refusing 
to use · j-boards. Obviously 

there's potential for an mruvtarial 
rights to be violated,' he said, 
and suggested that 'student gov­
ernment can try to change

A typical hypothetical situation which has occured in more than one hall this year generally looks like this: A hall rector has become fed up with the activities of a particular resident. In a well-publicized action in Keenan Hall earlier this year, Keenan Rector Fr. Richard Conyers said in The Observer that a student was asked to move because ''he does not fu into Keenan Hall 
life." 

The rector usualJy asks the student to move off campus in a non-disciplinary action, and the move is not placed on the student's permanent record. It is

New-s in brief 
Senate, Carter compromise on Tawain resolution 
WASHINGTON [A.P] -Leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee averted a confrontation with President Carter by agreein~ on legislation declaring that an attack on Taiwan by China ' would be of grave concern to the United States.'' The committee put off a final vote w1til today, but only the most severe critics of Caner's new China policy on the panel refused to accept the wording of the new compromise. The compromise says the U.S. decision announced laSt Dec. 15 to establish full diplomatic relations with China ''rests on the expectation that any resolution-of the Taiwan issue will be sought only by peaceful means.'' Caner has been resisting any les.islation expressing a U.S. commitment to respond militarily if China moved against Taiwan. The President has been fearful that a 

U.S. pledge to send ~tary forces to. Taiwan's aid would be unacceptable to China· and thus rmght threaten the new relationship with the Peking government. 

CAB tightens airline smoking restrictions 
WASHINGTON [4P} -Tightened restrictions on smoking aboard commercial arrcraft Will take effect Friday. The new Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) rules follow a study of the problem ofsmoking in the closed conditions of aircraft .. :Besides the fonnal comments and suggestions from or~ed groups, letters and cards from more than 31,000 individuals were considered by the board. Because the CAB found cigar and pipe smoke particularly offensive to nonsmokers, its rule calls for additional segregation of pipe and cigar smokers, with individual airlines being left to decide how to do this. While current rules provide for nonsmoking areas, the new rule will require that ''all'' passengers who want to be in such an area be accommodated and there be a means of expanding the area if necessary. At the minimum, however, the non-smoking area must be at least two rows, and there must be a nonsmokin~ area for each class. Finally, the new rule requires that no smoking be allowed in the aircraft when the ventilation system is not in full operation, such as while waiting for takeoff. 


Teenagers charged in death of 'too strict' father 
ClEVELAND [AP] -Charges were ftled in Juvenile Court yesterday against a teen-age boy and girl accused of paying $60 to have their father killed because he was too strict. Meanwhile, police continued to search for Gerome Watkins, 19, who was named in a murder warraiu in connection with the shooting death of John T. White, 41, of Cleveland.

Jazz Festival judging panel features prominent musicians 
by Neal Patterson· 
Bands from M.I. T., Sam Houston State University and Tex,as State University will be among those performing at the 21st annual Collegiate Jazz Festival, scheduled for April6-7 in Stepan Center. 
''This is the oldest and largest collegiate jazz festival in the world,'' festival coordinator Joe Carey stated. 
The festival will open on Friday evening, with afternoon and evening performances. Carey emphaSizes that Friday night's show will be especially entertain­ing since it will conclude with a jam session by the judges. 
"Past festtvals have had a number of prominent figures as judges, and this year's festival is no exception. The judges were selected from all eras and many different areas of jazz," he added. 
Judges for this year's festival are Stanley Turrentine, Buddy DeFranco, Toshiko Akiyoshi, Philly ] oe ] ones and Richard Davis. 
Stanley Turrentine is a tenor saxophonist who Carey describes as a "master of all jazz." Turrentine began his career in the 1950s and has played with many renowned musiClanS, in­cluding George Benson. 
Buddy De Franco, who plays clarinet, began his career during the Swing .Era in the 1940s with Tommy Dorsey. In the most recent poll in Downbeat, a jazz magazine, DeFranco is ranked as the third best jazz clarinetist in the country. 
ToshikQ Akiyoshi is the first female ever to judge the festival. Born in Manchuria, she will add a great deal of "Eastern influ­ence" to the festival, according to Carey. In addition to being a pianist, she is a conductor and an arranger. In Downbeat maga­zine's latest poll, she is ranked as the number one jazz arranger in the nation. 
Philly Joe Jones is a drummer who has been described by jazz critics as the "driving force" behind the Miles Davis quintet in the 1950s and the 1960s. In Jones' length career, he has

Coaches select final 
Bowl roster tonight 
by FJien Buddy Saint Mary's Editor 
Final competition to select the staners for Saint Mary's College Bowl team will begin tonight at 8 
p.m. in Regina Auditorium according to Mary Laverty, Col­lege Bowl coordinator. 
The original field of rwelve women was reduced to nine earlier this month to form the All-Star team. Last weekend, another round of competition cut the number of participants to six: Kathy Byrne, Cathy Cowhey, Louise Enyedy, Lisa Fulks, Cathy Loftus and Patty Field. They will compete tonight for the four staning posiuons on the College Bowl team representing Saint Mary's at the Regionals' in March. One team alternate also will be selected. 
Tonight's first two games will be played against the coac~es who helped the teams· dunng intramural competition earlier this year, Laverty said. The last game will be open to any faculty members who are present and wish to participate. 
Mter tonight's games, the coaches will vote on the final decision concernin~ the starters and the alternate. 'The decision will be tough because all these women are very good, and the entire coaching staff 1s impressed,'' Laverty noted. 
The vote is based upon tally sheets the coaches have kept on each I?articipant throughout competuon, according to Laverty. 
The coaches tally the number of times the women have answered, their correct responses and the subject area to which they respond most frequently. ''The coaches will attempt to formulate a balanced team that-works well. together,'' Laverty explained. 
Once the final decision is made, the team members will continue to prepare for the Regionals, scheduled for March 8 and 9 at Saint Mary's. Participat­ing schools will include Indiana State, Terre Haute, Southern Illinois, Carbondale, Franklin College, Purdue, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
Referendutn postponed; m,ore infonnation needed 
by Brian McFeeters 
Thirty members of the Farm­workers Support Committee decided in a meeting last night to postpone until early April the planned campus referendum in support of the nationwide Nestle's and Campbell's boycott. 
The referendum, originally scheduled to coincide with next Tuesday's student government elections, was postponed after the committee received a letter from Vice President for Student Affairs, Fr. John Van Wolvlear, disapproving the placing of the issue on next week's ballot. 
Van Wolvlear stated in the letter that disapproval of the referendum was ''not based on any disasreement with what you are strivmg for,'' but that more information is needed to allow a fair decision by students. 
The letter also outlined guide­lines for all future referemdums of this type, stating that the supporting organization must be at least a year old, must provide ''extensive and exhaustive'' information on both sides of the issue and must publicize the information to all students. 
Members of the Fartnworkers Committee plan to circulate a 
 new petition during late March and early April to obtain the 800 signatures required for a referen­dum. Information on the corpora­tions and migrant workers involved in the Ohio dispute is being gathered according to guidelines specified by Van Wolvlear. Pro and con fact sheet will heJublished in The Obser­ver, an representatives of both positions have been invited to speak at Notre Dame. President of the Farm Labor Organizing Committee Valdemar Velasquez exJ?lained the fafl!l­worker's posinon to the commit­tee Tuesday night, saying, "Our immediate goal is to get the canneries to listen. So far, they haven't even recognized us." Velasquez urged student sup­port of the boycott, saying he hoped that Notre Dame could become "part of a national effort. '' Commenting on the campus push for a referndum on the issue, Velasquez said he found it strange that a vote was needed. "It seems to me that that's like voting on whether it is all right to exploit a people or not,'' he said.

The referendum will be placed on Tuesday's student govern­ment electton ballots for fmal student approval, according to John Dunbar, a WHC member. 
The referendum reads: ''Be­cause of Nestles' role in the infant formula controversy, I support the removal of all Nestles food products from Notre Dame food service and from Notre Dame vending machines.'' 
If the referendum is passed by a majority of the students voting on Tuesday, the Administration will ''implement the referendum and remove all Nestles products and Nestles subsidiaries such as Libby's and Stouffer's products

NEW ORlEANS [AP] -A police captain died of a heart attack yesterday after 20 hours on duty as New Orleans showed signs of weariness from a police strike that has dulled the Carni­val and Mardi Gras spirit. 
The strike has led to cancella­tion of all remaining Carnival and Mardi Gras parades in the city, and hotels were reporting tourist cancellations as .well. 
Meanwhile, federal mediator Ansell Garrett met with repre­sentatives of the mayor and the Teamsters-affiliated Policemen's Association of Louisiana for new talks on non-economic strike Issues. 
The Civil Service Commission was also reported meeting. It alone can consider police wage and benefits demands. It was not known if the police were involved in the meeting. 
At a trial in Civil District U'urt, Judge Richard Garvey ruled  the strike illegal and issued a perma­nent back-to-work order. A temporary order had been ignored by nearly 1, 200 of the city's 1,500 policemen. 
A 500-man National Guard force was flown in yesterday for Bogalusa. The new substlrute pohce, who relieved guardsmen on duty since Friday, were given arrest powers, but mnst were assigned to guard city facilities.

In 1973, a student attending Notre Dame could expect to pay a bit more than $4,000 in total costs. This year the figure is up to $6,160, and according to Joe Russo, the new director of Finan­cial Aid at Notre Dame, costs will probably rise again next year. 
Recently, the American Coun­cil on Education compiled the cost of attending private univer­sities and found that the average was $3,610 a 'year for tuition, $930 for dormitory expenses, $1,000 for board, and $1,060 for books and transportation, totalling $6,600 per year. According to the Council's report there are also very few signs of a slowdown. 
With the passage of the ''Middle-Income Student Assis­tance Act'' by Congress last fall, however, many more students will be eligible for aid this year, commented Russo. 
According to the U.S. Depart­
ment of Education's Student 
Information Center, there are 
five major college aid programs; 
the Basic Educational Opportun­
ity Grants (BEOG), the Sup­
plemental Educational Opportun­
Ity Grants (SEOG), National 
Direct Student Loans (NDSL), 
Guaranteed Student Loans 
(GSL), and College Work-Study. 
The Middle-Income Student Assistance Act (MISA), is signifi­cant in that it opens up feaeral grants such as BEOG and SEOG to students from families whose incomes are as high as $2-5,000 a year. 
Russo said this ceiling might be even higher in cases where there is more than one student in college. He said the average Notre Dame family has four children, two of which are in college. 
Last year over 460,000 stu­dents received a total of $270 million through the SEOG pro­gram. In addition, an SEOG grant can be as high as $1, 5000 a year. 
SMC shuttle experiences scheduling, driver problems 
by Margt'e Brassil StaffReporter 
There have been several prob­lems with the new shuttle bus schedule implemented this sem­ester, specifically with the break times and with one of the bus drivers, according to Marianne F~os~, Saint Mary's Co-Ex com­ffilSSloner. 
Frost noted that the drivers' 
breaks have been rescheduled, 
alleviating the problem. 
While the week night break times remain the same, the weekend times have been changed to 10: 15-10:45 on Friday night, 10-10:30 Saturday night and 8-8:30 on Sunday night. All breaks will now be taken in the LeMans parking lot, so the bus will begin tts rounds at McCandless Hall when it goes off break. 
Frost also said that she has contacted Transpo in relation to complaints lodged against one of the bus drivers. Students have complained that the driver does not make full stops at the designated places but often drives on; he will not pick up students who wave him down on the road; and, when the bus comes from Saint Mary's he does not allow students wruting at the Grotto to board the bus while he makes his trips around Notre Dame. 
According to Frost, the driver has been instructed to let stu­dents on the bus in these cases, but often disregards this. 
Frost noted that officials at Transpo have said that some­thing will be done about the situation. She asked students who have complaints to call or write Transpo to make them even more aware of the seriousness of the situation. 
The bus schedule was changed this semester with the closmg of the LeMans pruking lot. The dosing of the lot will continue for the rest of the semester, Frost noted,  'with the anticipation that a new library building might be built on the spot." 
The closing of the lot has not adversely affected security, ac­cording to Saint Mary's Security Chief Anthony Kovatch. "In fact, it has made the campus easier to watch," he noted. 
'1be campus is more secure because the back road around Madeleva Hall is patroled much more frequently than before." 
Kovatch admitted that it was more work for security to extend the patrol on this road because of its distance, but said this is actu~ly beneficial to campus secunty. 
'There is also less chance of accidents now by the pedestrian walk between the parking lot and LeMans," Kovatch said. He noted that while most student drivers took care when driving that road, many other drivers were not always aware of the heavy flow of pedestrian traffic in that area, paniculary during class hours. 
If Saint Mary's students miss the night's final shuttle from Notre Dame, Kovatch empha­sized that he would rather they call the Saint Mary's security to pick them up than try to walk back. 
''Particularly if there are only one or two of them. We'd be glad to pick them up at the main gate. Unless there 1s something else happening at that moment It's no problem to pick them up." 
He explained that if they were

ever comes first. On the average, 
the grant provides about $950 · 
per year per student involved in 
the program. 
Another important feature of .MISA is that it broadens the federal student lending program. Low-interest loans such as NDSL and GSL, are now available to any student no matter how high the student's family income. 
Lastyear over $310 million was handed out through the NDSL program, and the GSL program makes it possible for a student to borrow up to $2,500 a year, or a total of $7,500 as an undergrad­uate. 
The other maior aid program available to students is College Work-Study. In 1978, this fed­derally funded program enabled approximately 980,000 students to earn more than $4cxr million th~oug?. 3,000 colleges and umvers1t1es. 
According to Russo, the fed­eral work-study program pro­vides $150,000 yearly to Notre Dame. However, he added that the total student work program here at the University offered at least a few million dollars. 
Russo encouraged all students to come to the Financial Aid Office and apply for aid this year, especially in light of the changes made by the enactment of the Middle-Income Student Assis­tance Act. "Even students who have been turned down in the past should come and apply again," he said.

A justice Festival? 
Can a teach-in about justice be called a celebration in any sense? Mter all, the tactic of interrupting our usual rractices of learning and research began when al the associated horrors of the Viet Nam War became so apparent that. something dramatic had to be done. Classes were called off for a day at this university, and dozens of others, to permit the community to realize what was happening in the world and what should be done about it. Earlier in our history, workers seeking unionization held "sit-ins" at auto factories, and in the civil rights movement there were the famous lunch counter "Sit-ins." 
When the term 'justice' comes into public discourse, it inevitably expresses outrage of someone' s not getting his or her due in one fashion or another, as the "in -history" indicates. Perhaps this second justice teach-in at ND sets the stage for the expression ofthe variety ofgriev31JfeS we feel strongly about. And, when you think about some of them--which is only too easy--a fast rather than a feast seems mor~ in order. _,. 
Do the justice teach-ins promote a spirit of joy such as that associated with An Tostal or the Sophomore literary festival? I mention these as instances of a certain exhilaration in preference to our calendar feasts, secular and religtous, because for many ofus they do not effectively illuminate our present history and are used for other purposes. They are, of course, "breaks," though not always in the same way. For example, February. 19, Washington's Birthday, means chiefly there won't be any mail. 
Justice teach-ins are indeed a very serious matter. They are intended as ''time-outs' ' to bring our attention to questions of concern that go beyond, yet assume, the knowledges of our everyday routine of classes and labs. The questions are always there simply because we are Intelligent and live in society. Yet, they are easily forgotten, isnored, or suppressed--very readily in an acaderruc community where our immedtate focus is not changing the world but finding out what it is all about, or at least pans of it. One of the elements that make ND unique is that it is not kaving to chance the issue of justice or simply to those very dedicated people whom you \viii find on any campus. 
. A festival has to be S}'eeial and experienced as liftin_g up the meanin~ of the ordinary. However, the domain of justice Is always one of conflict, with groups, for example, urging sincerely and per­suastvely that their rights have been violated. We ·cannot escape the more obvious cries of the poOr, the oppressed, the disenfranchized. Where's the cause for rejoicing here? 
The Sense ofjustice 
The response lies, I think, in the fact that we can and do talk about our differences. To do so, Prof. Sterba has urged that, beyond the variety of ways we have for conceiving justice, we may find something we share with 'others,' whether they be young or old, black or ~hite, men or women, etc. What we tend to have in common, even when we depart from it, is a "sense of justice" or an expectation of fair play. Children learn it very early, Piaget has observed. In the simplicity of games, we quickly recognize lapses: cheating, the "cheap shot," the bad call. That this mysterious power is a concrete reality of our lived-world is undeniable and, indeed, one evidence that the "world is a good place," after all. The "sense of justice" is a reason for festivity. We can be joyfully grateful that, beyond our differences, there is a "third party," the existence of which we usually take for granted: that we are capable of reasoning in practical disputes, however varied the approach. 
Love of]ustice 
Festivals are not always cheerful, the earliest ones celebrating funerals. Here, when we pause through the teach-ins to ask ourselves, "Am I helping or hurting?' ' the experience may. not be comfortable. Moreover, the time spent ts at the expense of some other val~ed activity. Nietzsche can help us: ''The trick is not to arrange a festival, but to fiqd people who can enjoy it.'' 
Those most likely to think of the teach-ins as festivals· are those who, beyond having a ''sense of justice," are "lovers of justice." In the ND community I think we would not be surprised at the large number who have asked themselves, Why should I be just?, and have discovered "reasons" that only the heart knows. I think Prof. Joe Evans's Valentine's Day greeting Ubi Amor, Ibi Oculus should be complemented by Chrysostom' s Ubi can/as gaudet, ibi est festivitas: Where love rejoices, there is festivity. 
Basil 0 'Leary 
Professor, Program in Non Violence Houle." It's no wonder that students are not gaining as much power and responsibility as they would like and that the Scholastic can never seem to gain the respectability it would like. With attitudes such as Ms. Rebeck's, it is a wonder the Scholastic has a leg to stand on.

Off Campus petitions for representation 
Dear Editor: 
The cry of, "No Taxation With­out Representation'' once incited the people of this nation to fire a shot heard around the world. However, when the Notre Dame Student Government hears the phrase used justifiably by off campus students, it merely causes a few raised eyebrows. The fact remains that off campus students are paying $15,00 in activity fees and they have no say over what this money is used for, because they have no representation on the Board of Commissioners, which is the unit of the Student Government that allocates student money .. 
In 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence, '' ... whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends (to secure all men's unalienable rights), it is the right of the peo­ple to alter or to abolish and insti­tute a new government..."Last week off campus students opted to alter the constitution of the undergraduate student body by adding an elected off campus 
representative  to  the  composi­ 
tion  of  the  Board  of  
Commissioners.  

The proposal for this amend­ment presented by the Voluntary O.C.C., met 'with disaster. For some unknow reason, the board did not receive the whole .pro­posal; and the council was not tnformed until Monday, Feb. 19 that they had to use a petition rather than a direct appeal to pass their amendment. The vol­
untary o.c.c. is now circulating a petition to override the Board's decision and place the issue in the hands of the Notre Dame Student ~y. However, be­
cause of these actions, the coun­cil must have 900 valid signatures by 3 p.m. today. So get out and sign petitions. 
If the proposal of this amend­ment is defeated, I feel that stu­dents should seriously consider abolishing the present Student Government and instituting a new one, as Thomas Jefferson 
·Stated, because it will have itself to be destructive to the whole student comml!ll.ity at Notre Dame by denying the right of equal representation to nearly 1I 5 of the student body and thus weakening the unity ofthe whole. ''No Taxation Without Represen­tation'' was reason enough to start a revolution against tyran­ny, so it is cenainly reason enough to start a revolution 
for a more efficient and effective student government.

Griffin muddles discussion 
Dear Editor: 

Griffs latest musings on sex and the single woman puzzle and bemuse me. What is our campus chaplain really trying to ~ay? How is it pastorally helpful to subject us for the umpteenth time to his rambling complaints about his sad fate on campus? If he real)y feels so misunderstood and ineffectual, why doesn't he take it up with his confessor or his su{>eriors rather than with the uruversity as a whole? Address­ins a woman as ''dear'' and "httle love" is a blatant form of patronizing sexism. I wonder if he patted her on the head too? Sentimentality is no substitute for a frrm, reasoned stand-­especially on the subject of sexuality, The latter-day discus­sion of sex in your pages has revealed an almost hopeless muddle and if "the pale le­~alisms of celibate logic'' are as meffectual as he confesses, who shall set our feet upon the path of dear-headed argument and hon­est discussion?

Dear Editor: 

For those of you who are sad about the departure ofthe fantas­tic Ice Capades show, don't fret. The show hasn't left Notre Dame yet. You can catch this dazzling performance every day on the North Quad, South Quad, and just about anywhere else on campus. I'm talking about the conditions of our sidewalks. In 
my opinion,  the conditions  are  
deplorable.  There's  no  reason

The fact that the United States was willing to sacrifice a lon~­standing relationship with Tru­wan without any substantial cor­responding guarantees from China as to the integrity of Nationalist China only adds to this impression.

and Austrian actions against Serbia in 1914 cannot be easily dismissed. In both instances, great powers have been pro­voked. But in the present setting, there is still tune to prevent men from repeating his­tory. The United States, like Germany in 1914, is facing a crisis of incalculable magnitude, much as a result of the ineptitude of its own foreign policy. It may be too late to prevent a Sino-Sov­iet conflict over the disposition of Southeast Asia, but in the event of such a conflict we might want to keep Bismarck's remark about the Balkans in mind.

they were not doing the job of clearing the sidewalks efficiently. 
That's admirable--admitting a mistake. What is ridiculous, though, is the fact that the article appeared over three weeks ago, but until now, nothing has been done to correct the situation. As I write this, there is about three inches of hard packed snow, along with ~lare ice, on practical­ly every stdewalk on campus. What has to happen before something is done?. Does one of the maintenance jeeps have to crash into a tree because of the\conditions? No. All that has to be done is the director of main­tenance to decide to put the steel blades back on the plows. Putting rubber blades on snow plows m South Bend is like giving New York City policemen caps to put in their guns, and just about as effective. 
Another question that has to be asked is ''why are the main­tenance employees clearing out only the intersections of busy 
~ ~jdewalks? What sense does that make? At some places on campus, the difference is about three inches from the sidewalk level to the level of the intersec­tion. It's a wonder why no one has sprained or broken his or her ankle. There hasn't been all that much snowfall in the last few days. What have the plows been domg? I haven't seenone )f the I.oadstar dumptrucks in quite a while. Hopefully, they're in the garage getting steel blades in­stalled on their plows. I hope our maintenancestaff doesn't wait for the rains and warm temperatures in March and April to dd their job for them. Ifthey can't do the job right, get someone who can!

National Theatre of the Deaf Kathy Ryan 
The Tony Award winning trouee, the National Theatre of the Deaf, wdl visit Notre Dame's Washington Hall of Mon­day, February ·26, bringing with an 11-year history of singular entenain­ment. The 14-member company of 4 speaking actors, 10 non-speaking actors, will perform Ben Jonson's Volpone and Dylan Thomas' Quite Early One Mor­ning, and adaptation of selected poems and lyrics. 
The troupe's credits are unique and impressive: eleven national tours, two Broadway runs, six tours of Europe and Asia, three films and numerous national television appearances. Acclaimed per­formances all over the world have evidenced the group's mastery in visl.ial communication, rrume, sign language, music and improvisation. 
The speaking actors narrate the drama, while the language of the stage--signs and motions, music and dance--bnng vibrancy to the performance. The entire project, sponsored by the Eugene O'Neill J.beatre Center and subsidized by the Office of Education, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, seeks to bridge the gap between the world of the hearing and the world of the deaf. On the stage, where insight and emotion play a pnmary role, the bridge is carefully constructed by a group of talented actors and their dedicated staff of producers. 
The Company last visited Notre Dame in 1973, when they performed Optimism, or the Misadventures ofCandide. Their upcoming performance begins at 8:00.

Leader disrusses pyramids 
by CarolBuzzard 
Prof. Robert Leader of the .Art IX-pamnent gave an illustrated lecture entitled ''American Pyra­mids and Human Sacrifice'' last night in Howard Hall. Leader compared the great pyramids of Egypt with those of Latin Ameri­ca, em_P,hasizing the use of those pyrarruCls as sites of human sacrifice. 
In an hour-long speech, Leader said that the greatest difference between the two structures was that the Egyptian monuments were royal tombs while the American pyramids were altars for hwnan sacrifice. 
. ~ccording to Leader, the Egyp­tian pyrarruds were part of a ''Necropolis, or city ofthe dead,'' subsequently they were secreted away from human life. The 
)/ American pyramids, however, would hold hundreds of Indians on their sides while human victims were offered to Indian 
. i gods, often the sun. Leader called the pyramids the ''cere­monial center of a complex society.'' 
Leader described the ~tian pyramids as "distant things, a security system to perpetuate the mummy's life in another world.'' These pyramids proved insecure, and were constantly looted and destroyed. In Mezo-America, however, the Aztec's and Mayan's built their pyramids to glorify their religious rituals. 
Speaking about these religious rituals, Leader told how the priests would stand on the ele­vated platform plunge a stone knife into the victim and cut out the beating heart to offer to their sun god. The sacrifice would then be thrown down the steep stairway. 
Leader said that, according to legend, in order to prevent the destruction of the world, the sun must be fed blood. The Indians believed that the world was renewed in 104 years. Midway between this cycle, every 52 years, they would build a new pyramid upon the old one. 
The original strucrures of the Egyptian pyramids were mathe­mancally precise and covered with a smooth and glossy surface which no one could climb. The Indian pyramids, however, had 365 high narrow steps which forced someone to ascend in a zig-zag fashion, like a serpent. 
Leader said that authorities differ on the amount of Indian sacrifices. The numbers range from 200-250 thousand sacrifices per year, including hundreds of victims who were sacrificed each day during major festivals. 
Leader concluded by alluding to the fact that today' s Mexicans are fervently proud of their Indian heritage. He added that they should not condemn the handful of "frightened" Spani­ards who destroyed the Aztec Empire. Teir brutality was merely a natural reaction to the Indian's revulsive and canibalis­tic acts according to Leader .

Committee member Anne Huber told the group she had contacted representatives of both Campbell's and Libby's, the sub­sidiary of Nestles involved in the dispute, and was told that the canneries did not consider the farmworkers their employees. A letter from Libby's Vice Presi­dent for Government and Indus­
. trial relations Uoyd Duggan sid, in part, "We cannot interfere with the relationship between grower and his employees.'' 
So far, both corporations have refused to send representatives to Notre Dame since they main­tain that they are not involved in the issue, Huber said. She stated that the committee would conti­nue to ask the canneries to send representatives. In addition, committee members are trying to convince the Administration to send invitations as well. 
Committee organizer Tim Beatty told the group that the Administration is willmg to sup­port the boycott if enough speci­fic information is presented to the students. He reported that University President Fr. Theo­dore-M. Hesburgh had sent a letter to Van Wolvlear saying that he University would support a student-supported boycott. 
The committee is sponsoring tonight's 8:30 p.m. showing of the 1959 CBS documentary "Harvest of Shame" in Hayes­Healy Auditorium. The movie deals with conditions and prob­lems similar to those faced by the Ohio farmworkers today.

The SMC Senior Class Presents 

Beach Blanket Boogie 
Large audience hears Lucas lecture on memorization 
Tom Hay 
Pro basketball player turned memory expect, Jerry Lucas, delivered an entertaining, en­lightening, and often bizarre lecture on memorization tech­niques to a standing-room only crowd at the Library Auditorium last night. 
Lucas recounted some exper­iences from his basketball career, then proceeded to demonstrate how ''memory can be fun and easy.'' While he did not have enough time to present the method in its enurety, Lucas described the basics of his sys­tem and illustrated some vivid examples to the audience. 
Lucas bases his ''substitute word system'' on the ability to see, store, and re-create images in the mind. Put simply, this means changing words, symbols and ideas into mental pictures which are easier for the mind to store and recall. In particular, Lucas recommends making asso­ciations with totally ridiculous pictures, because they are e.asier to remember than ordinary im­ages. 
He demonstrated his principle by helping the audience memo­rize a numbered list of ten items, converting each item and its correspo'?ding into a bizarre mental ptcture. 
For example, number nine on the list was the word pig, so Lucas rhymed vine with nine, and.

conjured up a picture of vines that grew p1gs instead of leaves. ''Could you imagine walking around campus listening to all the pigs squealing on the vines?" 
other images included a salami on a diving board, a hen hatching a basketball, and television sets running a foot race. With pictures such as those, the aud­Ience passed Lucas' subsequent examination without error--ex cept for number 4, which he forgot to mention. Lucas stated that all memory is based on observation and association. "To improve our memories,'' Lucas said, ''we must improve our observation. Observation is not just seeing, b~cause. many. things we see don t register m our minds." According to Lucas, the best way to help one's observa­t~on is through picture associa­tion. 
''They . may be dumb, silly pictures, but they work.'' Lucas claims this method · can be ap­plied to ''anything at all.'' 
At present, Lucas teaches how to memorize the New-Testament in just 15 weeks, adding "the Bible is just a picture." 
During his basketball career, Lucas recalled he ''knew every play of every team in the NBA, and that helped us a lot." He has also memorized the names and faces of as many as 250 people at a time. 
The biggest memorization prob­lem for most people concerns intangibles such as numbers, formulas, or foreign languages. Lucas contends that anything and everything can be made tangible and picturable in the mind. ''The periodic table (of the elements) is one of the eastest things to do,'' claims Lucas, adding ''you can make the Morse Code as tangible as an ele.P.hant." 
Lucas will return to South Bend on April 21 to hold a day-long  seminar that will explain his system more fully. He en­couraged students to bring any memorization problems or chal­lenges to him at that time. The seminar will be held at the Gospel Center Church, 930 S. 30th St., SB. The cost will be $25, including about $17 worth of materials.

Flowers added seven rebounds as he teamed with Laimbeer to deny the ice-cold Chiefs many second opportunities at the basket. 
Digger was able to get every­one into the game as Tim Healy replaced Woolridge with 3: 30 to play and Marc Kelly and Kevin Hawkins entered with a minute left. 
For the Chiefs, Montgomery and Hill were the whole story, although Hill failed to live up to his All-America billing, hounded into frustration by the tenacious Hanzlik. Notre Dame got their usual balanced scoring, led by Orlando's twenty-one, Jackson's sixteen, Flower's fifteen, and nine apiece by Branning and Mitchell. Laimbeer and Flowers combined for twenty-six boards, four less than the entire Okla­homa City total.
