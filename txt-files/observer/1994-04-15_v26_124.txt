Lyonga: African women unheard in society 
By PATTI CARSON 
Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 
The role of African women in history and in present society is often misunderstood, according to Dr. Nolova Lyonga, Fulbright Scholar of State University of New York. 
Lyonga spoke about "African Women and Feminist Theories" last night in Stapleton Lounge. 
"African women were not silent," she said. "Rather, they were incapable of being heard in a language they could not master." 
Colonization resulted in a sit­uation where girls were not of­ten sent to school, she said. Lyonga explained that the cost of formal education enabled most parents to send only their sons to school, rather than their daughters. 
Due to the fact that these African women could not write, they became "invisible" in lit­erature. As a result, the African women were often mis­represented, she said. 
"For a long time, writers por­trayed women as weak and powerless. African women were not described in terms of beauty, but they were depicted as struggling beings," she said. 
"Actually, traditional African women occupied an important place in agriculture and busi­ness. Yet they are often seen solely in their roles as nurtur­ers," according to Lyonga. 
Traditional African women possessed a deep sense of com­munity. Since they could not write, they expressed them­selves through their songs, said Lyonga. Often these songs con­tained words of frustration and bondage, she added. 
Songs contained lyrics similar to this effect: If I had known what it was like to be a woman, I'd have changed into a bird in the forest. The discontentment was obvious, she said. 
"I admire traditional women for their sense of indepen­dence, both materially and psy­chologically," Lyonga said. 
"Male writers, the only ones educated enough to write at the time, had difficulty understand­ing women. Those same male writers, however, were the ones representing the women. All writers were borrowing from African women," she said. 
Lyonga went on to explain the anthropologist's concept of a dual sex structure, the separation of the woman's soci­ety from the man's society. 
She further explained this theory with her model of the social hierarchy. The figure she illustrated consisted of two concentric circles with a point at the center. The outermost circle represented the man's society. The innermost circle represented the society of women, while the point in the center was symbolic of the careful balance of social inter­action between man and woman, according to Lyonga. 
"This center point is the place at which all of society is held together. To get close to the center of the concentric circles is to conform, while moving away from the center is to per­form non-conformist actions," she said. 
When men and women live only within their own circles, they cannot hear what is being "sung" in the other circle. There is a separation, accord­ing to Lyonga. 
"The circle model exhibits both our cultural strengths and our weaknesses. We develop our own ideas within our circle and only when we move to the center do we conform," she restated. 
Traditional African women developed their ideas, morals, and songs in their circle. "There is something to get out of the traditional situation that is useful to the modern sector," Lyonga stated. That traditional female spirit in cooperation with education brings us closer to the center of that circle, she said.

Israel demanded in unusually harsh language Thursday that Jordan crack down on the Is­lamic militant group Hamas, which killed 12 Israelis in bombings in the last week. 
The statement by Prime Min­ister Yitzhak Rabin came as the Hamas group, which has been increasingly active in Jordan recently, issued another warn­ing of attacks to come.

Because of the economical changes in the 70's and 80's, many women left the home to bring in additional wages, leav­ing the children at day care centers. These expensive costs for day care were, and still are, neglected by the government.

What Danziger feels is need­ed instead, is an expansion of subsidies for day care, especial­ly for the working poor. 
As far as America's future, Danziger stated, "It's possible that things will turn around, al­though we haven't seen any proof of it yet." 
This lecture is the fifth of a six-part series discussing the working poor in America today. The final lecture will be held on Monday, April 18 at 4:15 p.m. in the Center for Social Con­cerns.

The Center for Spirituality at Saint Mary's College is celebrating their tenth anniversary this year. The center was established in 1984 by Keith Egan, Sr. Bettina Maria Ferraro and Sr. Rose Anne Schultz. 
"The Center's main goal is to help Saint Mary's express the mission of the Sisters of the Holy Cross," Egan said. 
The Center sponsors numer­ous events during the school year and summer. A few of these activities are the fall and spring noontime lectures and a summer program in spirituality involving more than 200 participants. 
The Center also sponsors symposiums that "foster stu­dent contact with speakers who come on campus," Egan said. 
Funding for these events come from endowments from the Sisters of the Holy Cross and anonymous donations. 
Another activity that the Center for Spirituality spon­sors is the Madeleva Lectures. These are annual lectures that are given by women as an opportunity to speak about Christian tradition. 

Every lecture is published by Paulist Press publications. Originally this was done as a favor to Saint Mary's, but every lecture has become a best seller, according to Egan. 
This year's lecture was held last night and featured Gail Mandell, Chair of the Humanistic Studies program at Saint Mary's. 
Currently, the Center for Spirituality is preparing a commemorative booklet cele­brating the fiftieth anniver­sary of the school of graduate theology. Started in 1944 by Sr. Madeleva, it was the only graduate program available to women in the world. The commemorative booklet will include the names and pic­tures of the graduates.

Muslims surrender to troops in Niger village 
Associated Press 
NIAMEY, Niger 

Muslim hard-liners besieged by government troops in a western Niger village started surrendering on Thursday, the government said. 
Authorities also arrested a fundamentalist preacher, Cheikh Amadou Sido, whose teachings encouraged attacks on women accused of immodest dress, Interior Minister Ous­mane Oumarou said. 
Seven policemen, one soldier and two Muslim fundamental­ists have been killed in clashes since Monday around the vil­lage of Kolouka, 100 miles north of the capital, Niamey. 
The unrest began when po­lice went to Kolouka Monday to arrest six fundamentalist preachers. Villagers captured seven officers and beat them to death, state radio said. 
On Tuesday, more policemen, supported by soldiers, entered the village but were driven back in a violent clash that killed a soldier and two fundamentalists. 
Villagers armed with arrows and machetes repulsed the out­numbered troops and then marched to the nearby town of Banibangou. 
The soldiers laid siege to the town until Wednesday night, when sect members eluded their cordon and returned to Kolouka. 
Soldiers surrounded Kolouka at dawn Thursday and threat­ened to attack unless the fun­damentalists surrendered. About midday, two elderly men walked out of the village to tell the soldiers "the fundamental­ists were ready to turn them­selves in," Oumarou said. 
Many then surrendered, he said, but between 100 and 200 hard-liners remained inside the village. 
Militant Muslim fundamental­ism is growing in Niger, a north-central African nation bordering Algeria. 
Earlier this month, in the town of Maradi, 350 miles east of Niamey, fundamentalists looted homes they said be­longed to prostitutes and at­tacked women they accused of being indecently dressed.

Death penalty authorized 
ByCAROLYNSKORNECK 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

The House responded to de­mands for tough anti-crime leg­islation in an election year by authorizing the death penalty Thursday for nearly 70 addi­
tional crimes. 
Working on a $15 billion crime bill, the House reject­ed by a 314­111 vote an amendment that would 


have substi-Bill Clinton tuted life without parole for the death penalty. Among new crimes that could result in execution: drive-by shootings, a killing committed while stealing a car and activi­ties of big-time drug dealers, even if they don't result in death. 
At the White House, President Clinton focused on other parts of the bill as he addressed a ceremony honoring police offi­cers. The bill, he told the offi­cers, would give them "the tools you need to do you jobs." 
"This is not a partisan issue or a sectional issue or a racial issue or an income issue," Clin­ton said. "If anything should truly make us a United States of America, it should be the pas­
sionate desire to restore real freedom to our streets." 
Judiciary Committee Chair­man Jack Brooks, D-Texas, led the battle against the amend­ment to replace the bill's death penalty provisions with life in prison without parole. 
"Plain common sense tells us that the death penalty is the only way to send an unequivo­cal message that some conduct simply will not be borne solely by innocent victims of heinous crimes without the highest price to be paid," Brooks said. 
Rep. Michael Kopetski, D­Ore., who proposed the amend­ment with the support of the congressional Black and Hispanic caucuses, said, "In my view, life without any hope of release constitutes death by in­carceration, a stiff penalty by any standard." 
The House also rejected an amendment to eliminate the death penalty for murders com­mitted during carjackings, drive-by shootings and federal drug and gun crimes, and an­other to eliminate the death penalty for drug kingpins even when no death occurred. 
The chamber approved 35 noncontroversial amendments by a vote of 395-25. They range from a five-year renewal of a popular grant program for state and local law enforcement to authorizing $12 million annually for three years to

establish Boys and Girls Clubs in public housing. 
Meanwhile, the Democrats postponed action until next week on a controversial liberal­backed provision that would set rules on death row inmates' rights to petitions to federal courts. 
Supporters say it would limit the number of appeals but would ensure that the merits of a case are heard. Opponents say it would mean endless ap­peals and would lengthen the process, not shorten in. 
Another battle looming next week will be over the Racial Justice Act that would let defendants introduce racial sta­tistics on death penalty imposi­tion as evidence of discrimina­tion to get capital sentences overturned. 
Many of the House bill's capi­tal crimes -such as assassina­tion of the president -carried . the death penalty before the Supreme Court overturned cap­ital punishment in 1972 on pro­cedural grounds. 
However, a number of them are new, including carjacking deaths, drive-by killings, mur­ders by federal prisoners and retaliatory killings of witnesses, victims and informants. 
Many members of the Con­gressional Black Caucus oppose capital punishment, but several urged passage of the crime bill as a whole. 

Troops sent to Haiti to jail military leaders 
By DAVID BRISCOE 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON 
A House committee chairman called Thursday for a U.S. inva­sion of Haiti to arrest and jail its military leaders. 
Rep. David Obey, Appropria­tions Committee chairman, said American troops should be sent in to get rid of "that useless, sick, poor excuse for a govern­ment" and to "lock up the thugs." 
He said "Haitians are being ground up like hamburger be­cause the clowns who run that government don't know how to behave like adults." 
Assistant Secretary of State Alexander Watson said he would immediately relay Obey's advice to Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who, he said, is working on another strategy for dealing with Haiti. 
Obey, D-Wis., who said he has opposed unilateral U.S. in­tervention all his public life, said Haiti "really isn't a coun­try any more, it's a condition." He gave the advice to Watson and other administration offi­cials testifying at a hearing on 
U.S. aid to Latin America.

President Jean-Bertrand Aris­tide in September 1991 will no longer be in power. 
In the Haitian capital of Port­au-Prince, an unofficial legal adviser to the military defied Obey's call for military inter­vention. 
"U.S. foreign policy has failed all over the world, because of its ignorance of the reality of the countries involved. Congressman Obey's declara­tion is an example of that igno­rance," said ultra-nationalist lawyer Mireille Durocher Bertin. 
Obey's call for an invasion "reflects a will not to create a new democratic world order but a new imperialistic world disorder based on the subjec­tion of black Third World na­tions," she said. 
Obey said Aristide, who has been living in exile since his . ouster, should not return to Haiti behind a U.S. invasion. Instead, he said, the ousted leader should call for a post-in­vasion election, which he surely would win. Aristide got 70 per­cent of the vote but served only a few months before his over­throw. 
A U.S. invasion, Obey said, should be followed by a multi­national Latin American force that would stay for a decade or more to help secure public safety and restore democratic institutions. 
"If we don't do something like this, we are going to be im­prisoned by a situation in which our own national policy is imprisoned by someone else's behavior," Obey said.

U.S. helicopter shot down by mistake in Iraq 
By SUSANNE SCHAFER 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
American fighter jets mistak­enly shot down two U.S. Army helicopters over northern Iraq Thursday, killing all 26 people aboard. "Something went wrong," said the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and President Clinton promised to fmd out what. 
Twenty-one of the dead were military officers from the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey supporting the U.N. humanitarian relief operation for the Kurdish minority in northern Iraq. Five Kurd pas­sengers also were killed. 
The helicopters were shot down by two F-15C fighters en­forcing the "no-fly zone" over the area. 
Clinton expressed "terrible sorrow" and pledged a thor­ough investigation. He ordered 
U.S. flags on public buildings 

~ throughout the nation to be flown at half-staff through sun­set Monday "as a mark of re­spect for those who died as a result ofthe tragic incident." At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary William Perry said the fighter pilots mistook the UH-60 Black Hawk choppers for Iraqi "Hind" helicopters. Both jets apparently had the helicopters in sight during the daylight mission and both fired missiles, Perry said. An AWACs reconnaissance plane was over­seeing the helicopters' flight. "The pilots of the F -15s feel they had positively identified the Hinds," said Lt. Gen. Richard Keller, chief of staff of the U.S. European Command in Stuttgart, Germany. Audio and camera tapes from the aircraft will be studied in the investiga­tion, he said. Asked what threat the heli­copters might have posed that justified shooting them down, Keller replied, "I honestly don't know." 
One F-15 fired a radar-seek­ing AMRAAM missile, the other a heat-seeking Sidewinder, the general said in a telephone briefing with reporters at the

Pentagon. 

Gen. John Shalikashvili, the Joint Chiefs chairman, said the fmal order to shoot normally is given "on the scene" and not from military commanders at the jets' base in lncirlik, Turkey. 
"Clearly, something went wrong, and an investigation will have to determine exactly what did go wrong," said the four-star Army general, who spearheaded the relief effort for the Kurds in 1991. 
U.S. warplanes and heli­copters normally use electronic identification systems designed to tell friend from foe. 
If proper procedures were followed, the helicopters' identification beacons should have been operating routinely, Shalikashvili said. He did not say whether the Pentagon knew if the beacons were on or if they emitted the proper coded messages. 





----------, 
A Kurdish spokesman said the helicopters were ferrying U.S., British, French and Turkish officers from the U.N. office in Zakho, near the Turk­ish border. The group planned to meet Kurdish leaders in Salahaddin, the central region of the Kurdish zone. 
Clinton said those who died were a part of a "mission of mercy. They served with courage and professionalism, and they lost their lives while trying to save the lives of oth­ers. The important work they were doing must and will con­tinue," he said. 
"There were no survivors," Keller said. The bodies were being taken to the base in Turkey. 

Cause of crash unclear 
By ROBERT BURNS 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON 
The tragic downing of U.S. helicopters by American fighter jets raised a central question that Pentagon officials could not fully answer on Thursday: Why didn't simple communica­tion prevent it? 
The military, including the multinational task force that has operated in northern Iraq for three years, has strict and well-rehearsed procedures for avoiding fratricide, or "friendly fire," in the air and on the ground. So the Iraqi disaster is puzzling, even assuming the possibility of human error. 
Here are some questions and answers to help explain what is known about the incident. 
Q. Why did the F-15 jet pilots fire on the helicopters in the first place? 
A. They thought the Army Black Hawk helicopters were Iraqi attack helicopters known as "Hinds." Iraq is prohibited under a U.S. and allied en­forced "no fly" arrangement from using planes or heli­copters north of the 36th paral­lel. Violators are subject to be­ing shot down. 
Q. What made the pilots think they were Iraqi choppers? 
A. The most specific explana­tion offered so far, by Army Lt. Gen. Richard Keller, is that the pilots of the single-seat F-15s were flying in daylight, in good weather, and established what he called "visual identification" of the choppers. In other words, they could see the chop­pers but mistook them. 
Q. Even so, shouldn't the pi­lots have been required to get approval from elsewhere in the chain of command before actu­ally firing their missiles? 
A. Keller, who is chief of staff at the U.S. European Command in Stuttgart, Germany -which is running the Kurdish relief operation in northern Iraq ­would not discuss the estab­lished rules for firing on targets in Iraq. Normally, however, the jet pilots would have been un­der the control of a U.S. Air Force AWACS early warning radar aircraft that was watch­ing air traffic. 
Q. Did the AWACs crew also think the Black Hawks were Iraqi choppers? And hadn't they let the F-15 pilots know that a pair of American heli­copters were in the area? 
A. That and many other ques­tions about the role of the AWACS will be central to the Air Force-led investigation that is due to begin on Friday. Keller said tapes of the AWACS' communications were being flown to Ramstein Air Base in Germany, headquarters for U.S. Air Forces Europe, for a close review. 
Keller said the whole flight plan of the Black Hawks -in­cluding safety measures, land­ing zones and the rest -had been briefed the day before to everyone involved in the inci­dent. 
Q. Even if the pilots were sure the choppers they saw were Iraqi, wouldn't they use their radios to warn the choppers or try to communicate in some other way? 
A. It's not clear whether the pilots did use, or try to use, their radios. It is possible that they tried, but that there was no effective communication be­cause of mechanical trouble, or because they were on the wrong channels, or for some other reason.

Video: Plutonium dilute safe to drink 
By DAVID THURBER 
Associated Press 
HIROSHIMA 
A Japanese nuclear official, challenged by anti-nuclear groups to back up a claim that dilute plutonium is safe enough to drink, said Thursday he's willing to polish off a glass. 
But the head of the govern­ment organization that pre­pared a promotional video­tape containing the claim said no thanks. 
"I wouldn't drink it if I knew what was in it," said Hiromasa Nakano, director of the government's Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. 
The fuel corporation made the cartoon video to try to persuade Japanese to accept the government's policy of relying on highly radioactive plutonium for future power generation. 
The video features a perky, rosy-cheeked character named Mr. Pluto who shakes the hand of a child gulping a glass of plutonium mixed with soda. A narrator says that if plutonium were imbibed, it would pass harmlessly through the body. 
Most scientists agree that even minute amounts of pluto­nium are highly dangerous if inhaled, but that ingestion through the mouth is much less hazardous. 

"I myself will volunteer to demonstrate," said Yasutaka Moriguchi, director of the Sci­ence and Technology Agency's nuclear fuel division. 
Moriguchi made the offer in response to criticism of the video by anti-nuclear activists at a meeting of Japan's nuclear power industry. The annual conference is being held for the first time in Hiroshima, the target of the world's first atomic bomb. 
"No place is more appropri­ate than Hiroshima" to re­evaluate nuclear power, said Hans Blix, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
"We must make the point that nuclear energy ... is morally right," said Neville Chamberlain, chief executive of British Nuclear Fuels Plc. 
Participants say nuclear power contributes less than fossil fuels to atmospheric pollution, acid rain and global warming. 
About 100 of the 1,200 industry and government representatives attending the three-day conference are from abroad. 
There is a broad consensus among Japanese nuclear power advocates that plutoni­um should be used for future power generation instead of the enriched uranium now used in most nuclear plants.

Rockets fall on Rwanda's escaping foreigners 
By ANGUS SHAW 
Associated Press 
KIGALI, Rwanda 
Rockets exploded at the capi­tal's airport on Thursday, threatening attempts by for­eigners to escape Rwanda's slide into gruesome anarchy. 
Mortar shells rained down on streets already bathed in blood as government forces battled the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front for control of the city. The rebels again rejected U.N. efforts to broker a cease-fire. 
More than 20,000 people are estimated to have died since fighting broke out between the army and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front a week ago. The fighting and the mayhem in Ki­gali are deeply rooted in the decades-old feud between the majority Hutu and minority Tutsi ethnic groups. 
The sickly smell of decaying flesh hung over the green hills of the city, its streets full of rot­ting corpses. Marauding gangs hacked thousands to death with machetes, knives and spears. 
"More and more of the civil­ian population armed with ma­chetes are ruling the streets and the army can't control them," said Phillippe Gaillard of the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
Gaillard ordered the suspen­sion of the ICRC emergency medical program after six wounded were dragged from a Red Cross truck and shot Thursday. He said the program would be halted until new ap­peals could be made to warring groups to respect the Red Cross flag. The ICRC has been picking up wounded and taking them to hospitals. 


Red Cross workers have also been caught in the mayhem. The Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said Thursday that at least 30 Red Cross workers have been slain in Rwanda the past week. 
After a relatively quiet night, the fighting resumed at day­break Thursday with sporadic but sometimes heavy shelling.

Government artillery near the city's center shelled a nearby mist-shrouded valley. The rebels answered with mortar rounds that exploded down­town. 
The airport, the lifeline for the thousands of foreigners who have fled in the past few days. was hit by at least six rockets. One exploded just 150 feet from an Italian military C­130 that was taking off with a load of evacuees. There were no injuries. 
Tens of thousands of Rwan­dans, meanwhile, were fleeing by foot. The International Res­cue Committee humanitarian organization reported an eight­mile-long column of people streaming out of Kigali. 
About a third of the capital's 300,000 people are believed to have fled. 
Amnesty International ac­cused the U.N. and Western countries of not doing enough to protect Rwandans. 
The London-based human rights watchdog issued a state­ment Thursday saying "defenseless local people have been left behind to be slaugh­tered" and foreign embassies have denied asylum to people "at imminent risk of being killed." 
The commander of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Kigali said his troops were powerless to intervene. Gen. Romeo Dal­laire of Canada said the 2,300 mostly unarmed peacekeepers were short of equipment and had no mandate to enforce peace. 
In Brussels, Foreign Minister Willy Claes confirmed Brussels' intention to withdraw its more than 400-man peacekeeping team from Rwanda. 
Claes told reporters that "in no case" would Belgian troops remain in Rwanda as part of the U.N. mission, which had been overseeing a fragile cease­fire that was part of a U.N.-bro­kered peace plan. 
Ten Belgian peacekeepers were killed by Rwandan sol­diers last week and machete­wielding thugs have threatened to kill Westerners unless they could prove they weren't Bel­gians. 
Belgium governed Rwanda as a protectorate from 1916 until it won independence in 1962 and many Rwandans hold a special antipathy toward those they see as former colonial masters. 



Factions reject peace efforts 
Associated Press 

MOGADISHU 
Twelve Somali factions re­jected a United Nations' post­ponement of a peace confer­ence and said they would meet Friday as planned. 
The United Nations said Wednesday it was delaying the conference until April 26 be­cause its acting special envoy, Lansana Kouyate, was out of the country and not available to meet with clan leaders. 
U.N. officials said the decision was made after consulting with warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid and his chief rival, Ali Mahdi Mohamed. 
But Ali Mahdi, leader of a coalition of 12 clan factions, denied Thursday that he or any of the factions he represents had been consulted by the U.N. Operation in Somalia. 
"UNOSOM doesn't have the right to postpone," Ali Mahdi said. "It's the Somali factions who can discuss that." 
He said his supporters would meet Friday even if Aidid failed to attend. The conference was supposed to set the agenda for a May 15 meeting at which an interim government was to be formed. 
Ali Mahdi also accused Aidid's Somali National Alliance, a coalition of three factions, of breaking a cease­fire accord by attacking the small southern port of Merca. 
Sporadic fighting has been reported in Merca over the past two weeks and the United Na­tions has withdrawn its staff from the city.

Tracks lures collegiate connoisseurs of music 
By DAVID CLAIRMONT 
Assistant Business Editor 
If music is the commodity worthy of respect, then Tracks is its guardian. Opened eight years ago as a regional record store, Tracks had the vision of being a "full service, full cata­log" music store, and when the compact disk revolution flared up, Tracks was there to stoke the fire. 
The business is still a regional franchise, currently operating seven stores with a target mar­ket of predominantly college students. In addition to the uni­versity community in South Bend, Tracks services areas around Purdue University and Indiana University, Bloomington. According to Jack Freeman, store manager in the South Bend branch, Tracks attributes 15 to 20 per­cent of total sales to the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's com­munities. Sales at all the stores are slightly higher during the school year over their summer season levels. 
In order to service its target market, Freeman said, Tracks has implemented two funda­mental strategies. "[We] hire people who care a lot about music ... we're all collectors," while maintaining an inventory to satisfy the demand of like minded consumers. The catalog system, whereby everything currently in print is in stock, allows the shopper to find even those titles which are carried only on occasion by competing stores. In addition, sales titles are released weekly to give

periodic discounts on a variety of music. Majority stock already sells at prices which compete with other music stores of simi­lar size. 
Freeman noted that the pro­motional strategies im­plemented by Tracks have "shifted over the years." One early idea was the "midnight release," which, although ini­tially successful, eventually "washed out," according to Freeman. Such a strategy, implemented around the release of Pearl Jam's "Ten," has since been modified. The new release discount is now reserved for Tuesdays, whereby 
Tax deadline arrives; 5 million file extensions 
By DAVE SKIDMORE 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Midnight Friday is the dead­line for federal income tax returns and the Internal Hevenue Service advised those sweating out the last few hours to stay calm. 
If you can't finish your return, file for an automatic extension. If you don't have the money to pay what you owe, request an installment plan. 
As of a week before the dead­line, the IRS had received 68 million returns. It expected another 35 million this week plus 5 million extension requests. 
Many post offices are keeping late hours Friday to accommo­date procrastinators, and some IRS offices are staying open for taxpayers who need to pick up forms at the last minute or ask questions. 
By calling the IRS' Tele-Tax number, 1-800-829-4477, tax­payers can listen to recorded information on 140 topics. You can check on the status of a refund with the same number but you need the first Social Security number listed on your return and the exact dollar amount of the refund. 

In its public pronouncements, the IRS emphasizes the impor­tance of timely filing, but pri­vate tax experts stress the ease of getting an automatic exten­sion. Taxpayers can get a four­month breather -until Aug. 15-by filing Form 4868. 
The penalty for not filing either a return or Form 4868 is steep -5 percent a month of the amount owed. However, if you file for an extension you'll be charged only 7 percent interest. on any past-due amount owed, so long as your tax payments and withholding add up to 90 percent or more of your annual tax liability. 
However, most people don't owe taxes; they get refunds. And through last week, the IRS had processed 48 million checks averaging $1,025.

BUSINESS PROFILE

With knowledgeable employees and full catalog service, Tracks pro­motes music appreciation in South Bend. 
"major releases" sell for a "real low price ... and at a more convenient time." Citing one recent example, Freeman noted that selling the new release by Pink Floyd for $9.99 "didn't make a penny." Such a tactic, noted Freeman, does increase overall sales levels on occasion, but Tracks must take a"long range look to recoup [their] money." 
The most difficult competition for Tracks comes from large discount stores such as Best Buy rather than from other competitors of comparable size. Freeman noted the ability of Best Buy to "drop 10 titles at below cost," which causes smaller stores such as Tracks to suffer a substantial loss in sales volume. "Music is the loss leader," said Freeman, re­ferring to the larger retailers. The larger franchises can afford to take a loss on some low ticket items with the expec­tation that the mark-up on much higher priced items will compensate for the loss. Referring to the Tracks profit margin on the each item, Freeman said that it is "really hard to disentangle that," and even though certain new release items are sold right at cost, "the numbers were up over all." 
Tracks offers an extensive selection of used compact disks as well. "The used CD market is a real plus," said Freeman. The consumers benefit from the offering because it allows them to trade in old recordings and acquire new ones for little addi­tional money. The store sees more repeat customers because of this process, allowing increased support of new merchandise. 
Tracks finds shelf space for music produced by new bands. The procedure is to sell, on consignment, anything that campus bands have to offer. The object, said Freeman, is "just to help people." Local blues bands and bands from the off-campus circuit have found a home in the Tracks dis­play. 
Advertising is done "primarily on radio" with a focus on fre­quency of the spots. "You can buy a lot more impressing on the radio," than with other media, said Freeman. He noted that in towns with stronger music communities than that of South Bend, entertainment publications and local print work better. MTV ads have been attempted, but, according to Freeman, multiple, expen­sive spots must be purchased in order to avoid blending in with the rest of the mass .advertising. 
Although their larger com­petitors present a substantial challenge, Tracks is able to persevere, offering its cus­tomers genuinely interested service coupled with reasonably priced variety.

People in United States and other big industrial countries will see their income grow more slowly between now and 2003 than in the 1970s and '80s, the World Bank predicts. 
The new estimate, made pub­lic Thursday, lumps together the countries of the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrial­ized nations: the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. Between 1974 and 1980, it said, their income rose by more than 3 percent a year. For 1994 to 2003, however, the bank forecast an average overall annual rise of only 2. 7 percent. 
"This picture of comparative stability can be seen as favor­able to long-run savings and investment globally," the report said. 
Even at this modest rate, the growth is more than twice as fast as what these countries have had so far in the slow­paced 1990s-only 1.2 percent

GARY CARUSO CAPITOL COMMENTS 
Hey Joe Camel, why should we kill ourselves? 
What do college students, gays, women, teenagers, and minorities have in common? They are the groups whose numbers are on the rise when studies are done about who is smoking in the United States. Some say that it is stress from our society or just immaturity that accounts for their increase in smoking. Others cite slick advertising campaigns like "Joe Camel" as reasons. Regardless of the causes, what are the con­sequences facing smokers in the future? 
Health care legislation is on everybody's mind, at least inside the Washington beltway. Everyone expects Congress to raise the tax on cigarettes from fifty cents to over a dollar per pack to help finance health care. That is why several thou­sand people, smokers as well as those employed by the tobacco industry, rallied in front of the Capitol last month. They were here to protest what they con­sidered unfair treatment by Congress. 
However. statistics show that almost all of lung cancer is caused by smoking, that large percentages of those treated in 
LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
hospitals are there primarily because they smoke. Studies also show that if Americans would stop smoking altogether, health care costs could reduce by almost one-third. The num­bers are too dramatic for smok­ers to have a fighting chance, regardless of how many attend rallies. 
To me, smoking cigarettes is rather disgusting, unless you happen to have fallen in love with someone who smokes. Then all of your brains, reason­ing, and senses are cast to the polluted wind. I personally was surprised just how much I could tolerate when by life was dominated by my hormones! I guess that humans can be con­ditioned to just about anything like a laboratory rat. 
What disturbs me most is the makeup of those groups whose numbers of smokers are grow­ing. Teenagers are easily hooked by advertising and peer pressure. Once hooked, they can then carry the tobacco manufacturers to the bank for several decades because they are less likely to quit after entering their twenties. Smoking will become such a large part of a teenager's life that the addiction to nicotine will not be worth the trouble of attempting to quit. 

Pregnant women smokers run the risk of affecting their unborn children. Like drugs and alcohol, cigarettes can adversely affect the develop­ment of a child before as well as after birth. However, being the "breeder" for our species is not the only reason I regret the increase in women smokers. It seems to me that they are smoking more because they are still fighting the battle of equali­ty in our society. The stress of having to continually prove yourself in the "good ole boy world" should not have to exist in today's society. 
The same can be said for minorities. Targeted advertis­ing for Afro-American commu­nities gets outlandish. Inner City youth sometimes do not expect to live past twenty years old, so they certainly will not consider the health warnings. Some may feel like they do not fit in among other communities or may be discriminated against so blatantly that ciga­rettes become an escape or security or status symbol. 
Gays also fall in this category. Not only do they worry about being fired from their jobs, dis­criminated against in housing or health care, they worry about being beaten by some ridiculous homophobic moron who just "hates them." Their bar dating rituals add to the pressure to fit in or cope in a similar manner like it does for teenagers. 
Finally! college students round out the list. Is it the pres­sure to compete for grades to either attain that perfect job or go on to some great graduate school? Is it the "coolness" fac­tor carried over from high school teenage days? Maybe it is a security thing only the inse­cure can describe. Whatever! it eventually becomes a tragic sit­uation. 
The college population today-especially in the more academically challenging uni­versities like Harvard, Yale, and our beloved NO-are truly the future leaders of our coun­try. Corny as it may sound, our nation's success lies in your hands just as it did in Bill Clinton's and AI Gore's hands thirty years ago. Think about that for a moment. It can be a sobering thought, and I hate to think about some of my college­aged friends who may be dis­abled or dead just when their turn to lead falls on them twen­ty years from now. 
M-TV is on as I write this arti­cle, and Beck's video "Loser" is playing. For anyone who is not an M-TV watcher, let me quote Beck's repeating refrain, 'Tm a loser baby! so why don't you kill me?" 
I do not think that anyone, whether in college or out, a minority or gay, a female or good· ole boy, is a loser. I only hope that u_eck's coffin sliding around on the ground never contains any of today's NO smokers because of cancer. 
Maybe the FDA's attempt to regulate cigarettes as an addic­tive drug, along with a steep tax per pack, will counter the growing tide of young and new smokers. At least the NO Administration's ban on smok­ing is helping ... of course until that nonsmoker falls in love with a smoker. Then the stair­wells become a very popular place.

Touring Midwestern colleges and bars on the strength of their second release End of the Century, Twopenny Hangover hopes to bring its unique blend of rich vocal harmonies, acoustic guitar interplay and ethnic rhythms to an eager campus.

The International Festival will open its doors to the South Bend-Miehiana community tonight for an evening of song 

.. and dance celebrating a pletho­ra of cultural traditions. The show begins at 8 p.m. at the Century Center's Bendix Theatre downtown. 
"The festival has become a ritual. When the first week in Fe~ary comes, people look for the festival," said Richard Altieri, ISO co-president. 
"Last year's off-campus show was successful," Altieri added. "I think the audience is really motivated to learn, and overall the show gives everyone a peak at how different traditions are around the world." 

.. 
The festival began eleven years ago and gained instant popularity on campus until it eventually debuted in down­town South Bend, according to Ramzi Bualuan, Notre Dame's computer science and engi­neering instructor and festival producer. "In the community. you shouldn't force someone to ed­ucate himself or herself ethni­cally by reading or listening to speeches. Bualuan said. "I be­lieve one should educate through entertainment." 
In addition to serving South Bend families, this year, Bualuan has agreed to donate age guitar players, playing 3-4 chords, but mixed in with some intricate bass and percussion we achieve a pretty complex sound." 

To achieve its diverse sound, Twopenny Hangover relies on the ingenuity of drummer Dennis Leas and his collection of butterfly shakers, conga drums, tambourines, wood blocks, bucket drums, and vari­ous other percussion instru­ments. 
Twopenny Hangover traces it musical influences to an eclec­tic group. All calls himself more of a modern American songwriters, strongly influ­enced by Neil Young, Bob Dylan, and John Prine while Schrum looks overseas to musi­cians like Richard Thompson. 
Twopenny Hangover current­ly calls Southern Indiana its home, splitting time between LaFayette, home of Purdue University, and Indiana University in Bloomington, when not on the road. 
The band has toured exten­sively throughout the Midwest, stretching as far up as Minnesota and as far down as Nashville, Tennessee. "We've played four times at the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville which is a pretty exclusive club, and we've had great reactions everytime," said All. 
The band has opened for the a variety of artists including the BoDeans and lesser known bands like Henry Lee Summer and the Vulgar Boatmen, and 
the proceeds from this week­end's festival to the Logan Center in South Bend. 
"Logan Center has a big fam­ily and every weekend they are looking for places to go that are fun. I think giving to Logan Center definitely reflects the quality and general concern ISO has," he said. 
February 5, of this year, ISO sponsored the eleventh annual, sold-out International Festival at Washington Hall. 
That evening, about 150 proud and dedicated Notre Dame and Saint Mary's stu­dents. representing more than 30 countries, gathered together to educate and celebrate their respective heritage with the Notre Dame community. 
Mexico, India, the Philippines, Lithuania, Sri Lanka, Japan, Chile, Ireland and Lebanon were among the assortment of cultures clad in authentic and colorful ethnic costumes and performing their traditional dances and songs. 
The International Festival is just one of many campus-wide events sponsored by ISO. April 22, ISO will close the year with the annual "End of Year Pienic" whieh will be open to all stu­dents. 
"It's more of a social event and of course we'll be serving hamburgers and hot dogs. But for real authentic foods, I en-

courage students to come to the International Banquet which takes place first semester," Bualuan added. 
"I think people first get involved in ISO because they think it's fun," Bualuan con­cluded. "Their main incentive is to meet people at these festi­vals and social events and share with others their culture, but in the process they end up learning a lot more about other people's culture. I think it's amazing while some of these students are from countries are politically at odds, you'll find that at the festival there is a genuine sense of peace and unity." 
Century Center's Bendix Theatre is located on St Joseph St., across from the Marriot Hotel in downtown South Bend. Admission is $3 for students and $5 for the public and tick­ets may be purchased from the Morris Civic auditorium box office (235-9190) or from the International Student Affairs office (631-5243). 
"This year we had a full house and there were even people who didn't get to see the show because it sold-out," said Bualuan. 
"Our show is not simply for students, but for the entire Michiana · community. Absolutely everyone is wel­come," he said.

In addition to their own career, Twopenny Hangover can be credited with making possible one of today's most successful bands, Blind Melon. Guitarist Mike Kelsey encour­aged fellow LaFayette native Shannon Hoon to join his garage band the Styff Kyttens, thereby paving a high school cut-ups way to multi-platinum success. 
All taught English at the Hoon's high school and was Hoon's receivers coach. 
End of the Century is a solid effort, easy to listen and a great reminder that summer is just around the corner. 
Sounding a lot like tour veter­ans Widespread Panic and Blues Traveler, Two Penny Hangover will definitely please a student body as finicky in its musical tastes as a ten year old who refuses to eat anything but peanut butter sandwiches. 
Twopenny Hangover is play­ing a free show tonight at 7:30 
p.m. at the Loft.

Good-bye to Chicago Stadium 
ByRICKGANO 
Assocuated press 
CHICAGO 
Bellowing, flag-waving, 
glass-banging Chicago Black­
hawks fans came to celebrate 
the past on Thursday, saying 
goodbye to the stadium that has 
been their home for 65 years. 
Banners displaying the re­tired numbers of Bobby Hull, Stan Mikita, Glenn Hall and Tony Esposito were lowered and presented to the Hall of Famers in a pre-game cere­mony before the final regular­season NHL game at Chicago Stadium, which opened in 1929. 
"The 15 years I spent here were great," said Hull, the first man to score more than 50 goals in a season. "All the memories are coming back to­day, from the vendors who's ask me how many goals I'd get before a game to the Robinsons (Gordon and John) guarding the door to the locker room. All the people. We tried to entertain the fans then. Hockey was a sport then." 
Hull scored his SOOth goal in 1970, nine years after the Blackhawks won their third and last Stanley Cup. 
Before the ceremony, cur­rent Blackhawks star Jeremy Roenick tossed handfuls of pucks to fans who were already 

on their feet, buzzing at the op­
portunity to be part of history. 
It wasn't the last game for 
the Hawks, who will have at 
least two playoff games here. 
But it was a night for celebrat­
ing and remembering. 

The so-called "Madhouse on 
Madison" has hosted enter­
tainers like Elvis and Sinatra, 
and boxers like Muhammad Ali, 
Joe Louis, Sugar Ray Robinson 
and the Rockys Graziano and 
Marciano. 

Franklin Roosevelt twice ac­
cepted the Democratic presi­
dential nomination in the sta­
dium. 

The Chicago Bulls, behind perhaps the greatest athlete to ever compete there, Michael Jordan, won their second of three straight NBA champi­onships at the stadium. The Chicago Bears won the 1932 NFL championship in the sta­dium, beating the Portsmouth Spartans 9-0 on an enclosed 80-yard field. 
But it was foremost a hockey building. 
With 18,000 fans crammed in, an organ pumping out tunes and an ear-splitting foghorn sounding after each Black­hawks goal, the building was one of the loudest in sports. 
The fans also began a stadi­um tradition of cheering during the national anthem until it reached a crescendo at the end.

Miller believes he is a victim of circumstances. "That's what it boils down to," he said. 
"I was just caught in the crossfire (of a fight between Graham and his friend). I didn't do anything wrong." 
Both players have denied any role in the thefts, although nei­ther has said how the equip­ment ended up in the apart­ment. Investigators have yet to say who they believe was responsible. 
"I know I didn't do anything wrong as far as taking anything from a dormitory," Graham said. "I had no part of that." 
"I don't know anything about it," Miller said of the stolen property. "I'm more embar­rassed about this than any­thing. Having my name smeared for something I didn't do is a difficult thing."

Graham and Miller reportedly went to the Notre Dame football office looking for coach Lou Holtz last Saturday to inform him of the situation. They were unable to find him, and that afternoon Holtz dismissed them from the team, at least tem­porarily. 
On Tuesday, Holtz released a statement that said the two were not kicked off the team but just not practicing, pending a ruling by the University. 
Miller has met with Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal but re­portedly has not met with Holtz. 
"He (Rosenthal) wanted the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth and that's what I gave him," Miller said. 
Graham had hoped to meet with Holtz Thursday afternoon but if the meeting actually took place is unknown. 
"I just hope all of this goes away," said Graham. "I can't wait for it to die down." 
The South Bend Tribune and Associated Press contributed !o this report.

John Cullen and Wendel Clark scored two goals each Thursday night as the Toronto Maple Leafs beat Chicago 6-4 in the final regular-season NHL game in 65-year-old Chicago Stadium. 
The Maple Leafs, finishing third in the Western Confer­ence, will meet the Blackhawks again in the best-of-7 first round of the Stanley Cup play­offs. They split six regular-sea­son games, with each winning twice on the other team's ice. 
The Blackhawks marked the occasion by removing the re­tired jersies of Bobby Hull, Stan Mikita, Glenn Hall and Tony Esposito from overhead and giving them back to the former stars. 
Cullen scored on a rebound past Ed Belfour at 14:38 of the second period to break a 4-4 tie. Less than three minutes into the final period, he pushed in another rebound. 
The Blackhawks will move across the street to the United Center next season. 
Blues 3, Jets 1 

At St. Louis, Brendan Shanahan finished the regular season with two more goals as St. Louis beat Winnipeg. 
The Blues were 1-2-1 in their last four games but could-

n't blame Shanahan, who also had three goals in a loss at Dallas on Tuesday. Shanahan scored 12 goals in the last 10 games to finish with a career­high 52, one more than last season, and 102 points. 
Brett Hull added his 57th for the Blues, who clinched fifth place in the Western Confer­ence with 91 points and a 40­33-11 record. St. Louis will open the playoffs on the road against either Dallas or Toronto. 
Devils 4, Senators 1 

At East Rutherford, N.J., Tom Chorske scored twice in a 33-second span in the second period as New Jersey capped its best regular season. 
New Jersey set franchise records for victories ( 4 7) and points (106) in finishing with the NHL's second-best record overall under new coach Jacques Lemaire. 
The Devils, seeded third in the Eastern Conference playoffs because they didn't win a divi­sion title, will play Buffalo in the opening round of the play­offs. The Sabres blew a chance at finishing with the fourth-best record in the conference when they lost a 3-2 decision to Washington. 
That dropped Buffalo to sixth and set up the series with New Jersey. 
Whalers 3, Bruins 2 

At Boston, Jocelyn Lemieux scored twice as Hartford got its first victory at Boston Garden since Nov. 12, 1990. It also was the Whalers' only win this sea­son in five games against the Bruins. 
Despite the loss, Boston got home ice in the first round of the playoffs because of Buffalo's 3-2 loss at home to Washington. 
The Bruins will face the Montreal Canadiens in the first round of the playoffs. The se­ries opens Saturday at Boston. 
Capitals 3, Sabres 2 

At Buffalo, Washington built a 3-0 lead in denying the Sabres home-ice advantage for the opening round of the play­offs. 
The Capitals' second shot on goal -just 42 seconds into the game -went in. 
Steve Konowalchuk took a pass from Jason Allison at the blue line and went in all alone on Grant Fuhr to score on his glove side. 
Three minutes later -on Washington's next shot ­Kevin Hatcher blasted one past Fuhr's stick side to make it 2-0. At the 15:29 mark, John Slaney fed Dimitri Khristich at the side of the net to make it 3-0.

back off, driving his right shoulder into Zwilling, knock­ing him to the ground where he landed on his left leg with an audible pop that silenced the large crowd gathered to watch this slugfest of a basketball game. 
"It was an unfortunate inci­dent," said junior Jim Ludwig, a member of Bring a Mouthpiece. "However, when one plays a game, there are risks involved, and those risks include injury." 
"It's ironic that the guy who was telling everyone to calm down was the one who suffered the worst," said Zwilling's teammate, junior Brian Mohler. Peacemakers were the dis­tinct minority in this bruising contest. Tempers flared from the opening, as the Bring a Mouthpiece squad, consisting of members of the club rugby

team, made it clear early that they saw little difference be­tween basketball and the sport they were more familiar with. 
''I'm sure they were out there to have a good time, or what was a good time for them, but you can't play rugby in a bas­ketball game," said Mohler. "They made it clear that they wanted to stop us from scoring, and that they didn't care how they did it." 
The physical nature of the game was bound to eclipse the limits of good sportsmanship at some point. Numerous words were exchanged by both sides, as The Regulators objected to the physical intimidation of Bring a Mouthpiece. 
"We played the only style we know how," stated Ludwig. "It was physical on both sides." 
However, cooler heads were unable to prevail, in part be­cause of the active crowd sur­rounding the court. 
Easily the largest crowd of afternoon, shouts and jeers accompanied every flagrant 
elbow and hard pick, encour­aging the players to continue in the same vein. 
"I don't think they were out to hurt anyone, but if you keep playing like they were, some­thing's bound to happen," said Mohler. "The game kept get­ting progressively worse, espe­cially with the crowd cheering them on." 
It is unfortunate that the nor­mal healthy competition of Bookstore had to be marred by such an incident. 
However, the real tragedy lies in Zwilling, who will now have to endure the pain of his broken leg." 
"Everyone can point fingers, but the important thing is that Dan still has a broken leg," said Mohler. "We would rather have lost 21-0 in order to avoid that." 
Zwilling was released from St. Joseph's Hospital with a cast on his leg and spent the night in the infirmary. 
The Regulators were granted the victory.

Prestige. Corporate sponsor­ship. First round games against the likes of If You Thought The Bills Lost Big... 
These are the perks of getting one of the 32 seeds bestowed by the commissioners of Book­store Basketball, supposedly signifying the 32 best teams in the tournament. 
The process of seeding is a mystery to most. 
How can anyone decide the best 32 teams in a field of 592, especially when most of the teams have never played together before? 
The scientific qualifications of receiving a seed are scanty. 
Theoretically, a team must have advanced to the Round of 32 in the previous year's tour­nament and return three play­ers from that squad. 
After these conditions are met, or in some cases waved, the less official methods are used. 
"For the most part, we seed based on what the commission­ers have heard about who's strong in any given year," ex­plained senior commissioner John Neal, who had a large part in determining this year's rankings. 
"We go by which teams we've seen play, for example those who frequent the Rock or did well in interhall. 
It's also helps to know a commissioner." Most seeds have similarities. 
The top seeds usually return numerous players who were dominant in the previous year's tournament, sometimes ad­vancing to the Final Four. 
"Eric Jones (of No. 1 NBT) has been in the finals every year since I've been here," said Neal. 
"That was a large factor in his team being seeded first." 
Marquis players are also a common denominator among the elite 32. 
The majority of the top squads contain varsity bas­ketball or football players whose athleticism always plays a role. 
"I think having athletes makes it harder on us," stated Jim Kordas of No. 12 White Shadow, which features foot­ball players Jeremy Nau and Mike McGlinn. 
"Those who aren't athletes feel they have to prove them­selves when they come up against us." 
The rare teams without such stars feel that it works to their advantage. 
"Not having athletes makes us a dark horse," explained Kerry Plank of The Hood River Bandits, the No. 24 team. 
"People don't know as much about us when they play us." 
Once the top 32 are delin­eated, the order of their seed­ing does not seem to matter ac­cording to the teams involved. 
"We made the Final Eight last year, so we were expecting a high seed," stated Conrad James of No. 4 Ebony Side of

the Dome. 
"However, you have to play smart and up to your potential; after that the numbers don't matter." 
"The top ten teams are defi­nitely solid," concurred Neal. "After that, it's a best guess; any of them could be prone to an upset." 
The threat of an upset ranks as the biggest fear for any team given a seed. Two favored teams, No. 25 R.S.V.P. and No. 17 The Torch fell victim to teams that did not have a repu­tation but definitely had the skills, or in some cases, the luck. 
"When we saw a matchup against a seed, we didn't think we'd win," stated Chris Mackin, captain of We Like Women, a '· senior team that defeated The Torch 21-19 yesterday. 
"They weren't on from the outside, and we played at the best of our abilities." 
Other seeded teams look to learn from the fates of R.S.V.P. and The Torch. 
"Our biggest fear is a let­down, like last year when we lost in the first round," com­mented White Shadow's Kordas. "We can't look too far ahead." 
"There's definitely pressure," agreed Plank of The Hood River Bandits. 
"With the random draw, you never know if you'll run up against a good freshman team. "Ebony's James also noted the danger of relaxing in the early rounds. 
"I think a lot of teams that aren't ranked are dangerous when they play us," he said. "They have nothing to lose." 
The mystery surrounding freshmen teams is the major disrupting factor in the seeding process. 
Last year, Bobby Taylor's 
Headbangers team reached the 
Final Four on the basis of his 
freshman leadership. 
The same is true of Coming 
From Behind, which reached 
the Sweet 16 as an unseeded 
freshman team last year led by 
football players Renaldo Wynn 
and Thomas Knight. These two 
teams are seeded No. 2 and No. 
3 this year. 
After the first round, Sweeter 
Than Candy appears to be the 
unseeded team to be wary of, 
having already disposed of 
R.S.V.P. 
Still, despite the odd upset, 
the seedings of the commission­
ers usually hold true to form 
through the Round of 16. 
At this point, the commission­
ers meet to re-seed teams into 
a championship bracket based 
on their tournament perfor­
mances. 
Expect a majority of these to 

be Top 32 team~.

goals, so he is aware of his place in the Irish record book, yet he is equally aware of the fact that winning games is more important. 
"If breaking records is what my team needs to win, then fine," said the 6'3", 215 lb. at­tackman. "That is not what motivates me, it's not impor­tant." 
He has both scored a lot of points, and has won a lot of games, 28 to be exact. In the process, he has been a main force in bringing Irish lacrosse to national prominence. 

"You've got to have guys to build a program with," said Irish coach Kevin Corrigan. "Randy is definitely one of those players. We first saw him as a junior in high school and we were impressed. When he was a senior, he was an All­American, so he wasn't an un­known. But no one thought he would play like he has." 
Perhaps the main reason Col­ley has surpassed even the highest of expectations is his tremendous work ethic. 
"In addition to being our best offensive player, he is also one of our hardest working players. He doesn't rest on his laurels." 
It didn't take long for Colley to display this intense desire to improve. But it was by means no under good circumstances. 
After an impressive showing in fall ball as a freshman, disaster struck. Colley suffered a career-threatening knee in­jury, thus ending his first year of play before it began. 
"If there was anything posi­tive to come from the injury, it was the motivation it gave me

Lacrosse ready to face Air Force 
By TIM SHERMAN Sports Writer 
The 15th ranked Notre Dame lacrosse team will be looking to extend their five game winning streak tomorrow when they travel to Colorado Springs, CO to face the Air Force Academy. 
The Irish, who won their first conference game Tuesday at Butler, must defeat the Falcons to keep their NCAA tournament hopes in tact. 
"They have won four of their last six and will present a good challenge," said Irish coach Corrigan. I really feel that they are a team on the come." 
Corrigan also feels his squad is continuing to play better. 
"We're definitely improving. We've shown flashes of bril­liance. Now we have to put to­gether an entire game." 

to improve," said the govern­ment major. 
And improve he did. 

"The injury was tough, but he spent a year working on his shot and getting bigger and stronger," said Corrigan. "He really made himself tough to handle." 
The shot and strength he de­veloped during that time is re­ally what sets him apart on the field. 
Usually, defensemen have the size and strength advantage. That is not the case when Colley is the assignment. 
Combined with this strength is a tremendous shot. 
"Randy's shot is basically like a cannon," said Irish goalie Ryan Jewell who has stepped in front of more Colley cannon balls in practice than he would have liked. "His placement is so good to. You think you have a good angle and then he goes and puts it by you. I'd hate to face him in a real game." 
What makes the record even more impressive is the fact that it has taken Colley just two and a half seasons to reach it. 
"He has done all this against the best competition we've ever faced. Further, people know he is our man and do all they can to stop him. He still man­ages to score, all the while set­ting a great example to our guys." 
For the most part, Colley sets his example on the field, not only with his talent but with his mental toughness and desire. 
"I really love this game and I think that shows on the field," noted Colley. "Playing with such great teammates makes it even better." 
Colley and teammates still have goals to achieve this·year. 

"The two main goals we have are to crack the top ten (the Irish are 15th right now) and to advance past the first round of the tournament. If we continue to improve like we have been, we've got a good shot at it." 
If these goals are to be reached, Colley will be the one to carry the Irish. He not a bad person to be relying on. 
"I think that Randy should have been an All-American last year," assessed Corrigan. "There is no doubt he will be one this year." 
Another thing to keep in mind when considering Colley is the fact that he may have another year still to play with the Irish. As this is only his third year of varsity play, he has applied to the MBA pro­gram with designs on returning for a fifth year. 
Right now, though, Colley is solely focused on the task at hand. Winning. · 
"This program has come a long way, I'm just hoping we can take it higher this year." 
With Colley's capabilities and commitment, the outlook is pretty bright.

With eight games under their belts, the excuse of youth­ful inexperience is no longer viable. "We have some guys, but at this point in the season, they're not as young anymore," noted Corrigan. 
Air Force should get a chance to see how much the young­sters have developed first hand.

Eckersley couldn't stop the bleeding 
Associated Press 
Once again, Oakland stopper Dennis Eckersley couldn't stop Minnesota. 
Eckersley blew his second straight save opportunity against the Twins, failing to hold a three-run lead in the ninth inning Thursday as Min­nesota rallied to beat the Athletics 5-4. 
''I've been snakebit by this team," said Eckersley, who failed to hold an 8-4 lead last Friday in a game the A's went on to win 10-9 at the Metrodome. 
"That's baseball. I couldn't stop the bleeding again, just like I did last week." 
Trailing 4-1 Thursday, the Twins scored four runs off Eckersley in the ninth on an RBI single by Matt Walbeck, a run-scoring double by Alex Cole and a two-run single by Chuck Knoblauch. 
Twins starter Kevin Tapani gave up four runs and nine hits in 6 1-3 innings. A's starter Steve Karsay allowed one run and five hits in eight innings.

Maddux and Braves on roll 
Associated Press 
Atlanta and Colorado got great pitching. That's not news for the Braves; it is for the Rockies. 
Greg Maddux pitched a three-hitter Thursday night as Atlanta beat San Francisco 6-1 for its ninth win in 10 games. 
Maddux (3-0), the best pitch­er on baseball's best staff, struck out nine and didn't walk a batter. He was so overpower­ing that the Braves' outfield recorded only one putout. 
"That was an awesome per­formance," said Atlanta pitch­ing coach Leo Mazzone. 
David Nied, Bruce Ruffm and Darren Holmes combined on the first shutout in Colorado history, pitching the Rockies to a 5-0 victory over Philadelphia. 
The Rockies' pitching staff entered the game with a 7.97 earned-run average, worst in the National League. 
"We've been crucified in Denver for the way we've pitched," said Nied (2-0), who allowed only two hits in seven innings. "This is big. It's some­thing that will hopefully get us on the right track." 
Maddux has allowed only one earned run in 26 innings 
SPORTS BRIEFS 
this season, giving him an ERA 
of 0.35. He threw only 22 balls 
in 96 pitches against the Gi­
ants. 
"It was fun," he said. "You 
have games that look easy 
when they hit the first or sec­
ond pitch and everything is at 
somebody." 
Rookie Javier Lopez was the 
Braves' offensive star, hitting 
two homers and driving in four ~ runs. 
In Philadelphia, Ruffin 
pitched the eighth and Holmes 
the ninth to preserve the first 
shutout victory in 170 Colorado 
games. It was the frrst shutout 
loss for the Phillies at home 
since Montreal blanked them 
on Sept. 15, 1992. 
Mets 10, Cubs 9 

At New York, Jeff Kent 
homered twice and drove in 
five runs for the Mets, who re­
covered after blowing a five­
run lead. 
Ryan Thompson added a 
two-run homer for New York, 
which led 8-3 before Chicago 
rallied to take a 9-8 lead in the 
eighth on a three-run homer by 
Sammy Sosa and a two-run 
shot by Steve Buechele. 
In the bottom half of the in­ning, Kent hit a two-run homer off Dan Plesac (1-1). Doug Lin­ton (1-0) got two outs for the victory, and John Franco pitched the ninth for his first save. 
Cardinals 9, Dodgers 8 
At St. Louis, Ray Lankford had two hits and three RBis, and Allen Watson stopped his seven-game losing streak. 
Watson (1-0) allowed five runs and six hits in 7 1-3 in­nings, while striking out a ca­reer-high seven. The Dodgers, who trailed 9-2 in the eighth, lost for the sixth time in seven games. 
Mike Perez allowed a run in the ninth and had to strike out Eric Karros and Mike Piazza with runners on first and sec­ond for his fourth save. 
Pirates 4, Padres 2 
At Pittsburgh, Dave Clark put Pittsburgh ahead 3-2 with a pinch-triple in seventh, and Andy Van Slyke preserved the lead with a highlight-film catch as the Pirates won their fourth straight. 
San Diego lost its fifth in a row and fell to 1-9.

Next, please? 
The streaking Notre Dame baseball team has been punish­ing its opponents lately, bury­ing them amidst an avalanche of runs, hits, and strikeouts. 
Having scored at least 11 runs in each of their last five games, the suddenly explosive Irish now own a 14-7 overall record, and sit atop first place in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference with a 6-0 mark. 
The Irish will look for their sixth and seventh straight vic­tories when they take the field at Frank Eck Stadium for a doubleheader against Wiscon­sin-Milwaukee this afternoon, then will travel to Indianapolis to play two doubleheaders

against Butler in the next two days. 
The Wisconsin-Milwaukee Panthers come to South Bend with a lowly 8-16 mark, al­though they have played well lately, winning five of their last seven games. 
The Panthers are led by sophomore first baseman Jak Kraus, who leads the team in nearly every offensive category. Kraus is batting a team-high .338, and also leads the team in power numbers (5 HR. 21 RBI). All five of Kraus's home runs have come in the last seven games, a span in which he has also driven in 15 runs. 
Aside from Kraus's hot stick, the Panthers boast only two other .300 hitters. Bill Posteluk is hitting .333 with two home runs and six RBI, and Steve Klawitter is batting .302 with two home runs and 14 RBI, while striking out a team-high 14 times in only 63 at-bats. 
The Panthers's pitching staff is fairly solid, with juniors Cory Bigler and Lance Tardiff lead­ing the way. Bigler has allowed just one earned run in his last 15 2/3 innings, and leads the team with three wins. The ju­nior starter has whiffed 25 in 32 innings, and his 3.66 ERA is good enough for second place on the team, behind Tardiff. 
That could change against the Irish however, especially if the Notre Dame offense contin­ues to produce as it has over the past week. In their last out­ing, the Irish shelled Illinois­Chicago for 14 runs, as two Irish hitters went deep. 
Nine Irish players are cur­rently hitting above .300, and the recent power surge has pushed the team batting aver­age to a bloated .310 mark. 
Sophomore first baseman Robbie Kent has been unstop­pable lately, slashing hits to all areas of the field. Kent's hot bat has pushed his average to .387, and he is currently sec­ond on the team with 22 RBI. 
Freshman speed demon Scott Sollmann continues to wreak havoc on opposing pitch­ing as well. The fleet cen­terfielder has boosted his aver­age to .381, and his 13 stolen bases leads the team. 
One other hitter the Pan­thers might want to take note 
The Observer/ Kyle Kusek 

Irish pitcher Tom Price leads the team with six wins, and hopes to pick 
up a couple more wins this weekend. 
of is sophomore George Restovich. The part-time DH has shown huge power poten­tial in his limited playing time, blasting a team-high four home runs in just 44 at-bats. Restovich owns a .318 batting average to complement his .682 slugging average, and has been hotinthelastfewgames. 
Notre Dame's pitching has been solid while, holding op­ponents to a .252 batting aver­age while compiling a 3.20 ERA. 
Senior hurler Tom Price is definitely the ace of the Irish mound crew, leading the team in wins with six. After pitching brilliantly against Illinois-Chicago last Tuesday, the left­hander's ERA now stands at 2.98, and he has struck out 46 batters in 57 2/3 innings. 
When the Irish open up their series with MCC rival Butler, it will be a homecoming of sorts for new Notre Dame assistant coach Doug Schreiber, who spent the past two seasons as an assistant at Butler. 
While it is hard to believe the mild-mannered Schreiber harbors ill feelings towards Butler, the Irish will definitely not greet the Bulldogs with open arms, as they look to remain undefeated in MCC play. 
The Bulldogs will have the home field advantage, and they come into the series at 13-16, with a 5-3 mark in the MCC. 
Butler boasts a .276 team batting average, and four Bull­dogs are currently hitting above .300. Tony Baldwin and Brian Cain share a .339 aver­age, and Dan Bayha and Brian Zaun stand at .319 and .317, respectively. 
Bret Smith has provided most of the power for the Bulldogs, hitting .281 with 3 home runs and 22 RBI. 
The Bulldog pitching staff is shaky, with a team ERA of 
5.29. Rod Velardi is 2-3 with a 
3.27 ERA, and Steve May comes into the series at 5-3 with a 3.58 ERA. Brandon Leese is the team's power pitcher, boasting a 3-2 record with 26 strikeouts in 35 1/3 in­nings. 
As for the Irish, Price will likely get the nod in the Butler series, possibly even appearing in more than one game. The Irish senior ace took himself out of the game against Illinois-Chicago after throwing five powerful innings, saying he wanted to be able to help the team as much as possible down the stretch. 
Then again, Murphy used to pitch in the minors, didn't he? Think about it coach, you might still have the hard stuff.

Notre Dame was clinging to a said. "She threw well against their top batter. That was a big save." 

Notre Dame had to struggle to earn the lead. Down 3-2 in the top of the fifth, the Irish were in danger of stranding Stephanie Pinter and Sara Hayes on first and second when freshman Meghan Murray stepped up and laced triple into the left-centerfield gap to bring home the game-winning run. Jenna Knudson later singled home Murray on a no balls, two strike count. 
Joy Battersby picked up her win number 11 and Kobata earned her second save. 
Notre Dame carried the mo­mentum from their first win into the nightcap, where they cruised 3-0. Kobata went the distance for the Irish, allowing one hit and striking out ten. 
Freshman Elizabeth Perkins went two-for-four with a double and the game-winning RBI to lead Notre Dame at the plate. 
Earning wins number 600 and 601 was especially sweet for Miller, being a graduate of Western Michigan and the for­mer coach at nearby Lake Michigan Community College. Three current Broncos were Miller's recruits at LMCC. 
"I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to coach in two outstanding programs with many exceptional athletes." 
Notre Dame now prepares for another double-doubleheader weekend.

The Notre Dame men's tennis team enters the 1994 MCC Men's Tennis Champi­onship as the five-time defending champion on a bright note after beating Michigan 4-3 Thursday afternoon at Ann Arbor. The Irish, ranked No. 15 in the latest poll, hold the record for the most consecutive titles capturing the last five championship trophies. 
Thursday's match against Michigan proved to be a tremendous confidence boost going into the weekend's tournament. The Irish used the doubles matches, lately the squad's weakness, as its key to defeating the Wolverines. Seniors Andy Zurcher and Todd Wilson defeated Brakus-Costanzo, 8-5; sophomores Jason Pun and Mike Sprouse beat Pusztai-Burnett, 8-4; and freshman Ryan Simme and senior Allan Lopez defeated Prentice-Wyatt, 8-5.
