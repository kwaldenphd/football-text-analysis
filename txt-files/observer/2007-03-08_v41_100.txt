NDSP director Rakow dies at 55 
Security head served ND for three decades 
By KATE ANTONACCI News Editor 
Eighteen months and one day after doctors told Rex Rakow he had 12 to 18 months to live, the Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) director died at his home in Granger, Ind. He was 55. 
"That was the type of fighter he was," Rakow's wife linda wrote in a note that Coordinator of Event Security Cappy Gagnon shared with The Observer. 
Hakow, a Mishawaka native and NDSP's leader for over 30 years, was diagnosed with cancer in September 2005. 
"I think of Rex and I think of St. Francis who said something about 
preaching the Gospel and using words when neces­sary, said Associate Director of NDSP Phillip Johnson. "Rex lived his life as 

a Catholic, as Rakow a model for all of us. We're lucky to have had Rex cross our paths in life." 
Johnson, who graduated from Notre Dame in 1981, first met Rakow while a student at the University. 
"I had parked my car in B2late one night. I was a photographer so I had gone to the back of the car to grab the camera from the trunk," Johnson said. "Rex was on patrol and he asked me if I wanted a ride back to my dorm, and we devel­oped a friendship that lasted many, many years." 
Such friendships blossomed between Rakow and countless other people, many cultivated while he served as director of cam­pus safety office at Albion College, as adjunct instructor of criminal justice at Indiana University in South Bend, as a member of the Indiana Law Training Board and as a leader at NDSP for over three decades. 
Johnson said he spent Wednesday reviewing e-mails from colleagues from "New England to California, Colorado to Washington" all speaking about the great respect they had for Rakow -a man Johnson said lived for his "faith, family and friends." 
"He truly made not only Notre Dame, but our profession, a better place. I have so many messages that have crossed my desk today," Johnson said, neting one from a classmate of Johnson's who spoke about the accomplishments of

Week w-arns, prolllotes alcoholllloderation 
By MARCELA BERRIOS Assistant News Writer 
With the slogan "BAC to the Beach: Here for the singe, not the binge," the organizers of Safe Spring Break/Alcohol Awareness Week 2007 warned students to exercise moderation in their vacation alcohol intake during an information fair in LaFortune Student Center Wednesday. 
Student government, the Office of Drug and Alcohol Education (ODAE). Peers Inspiring Listening, Learning And Responsible Socializing (PILLARS) and the Coca-Cola Company put together a series of activi­ties and giveaways through­
out this week to educate students about the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse during the vacation. 
"We always run Alcohol Awareness Week before spring break because people go to places where it's legal to drink before they're 21 years old," junior Meagan McGinley, a member of the PILLARS team, said. "Many students may consciously or unintentionally abuse that privilege, and it's important to educate them about the risks implied." 
McGinley said students should be aware of the blood-alcohol content (BAC) their bodies can tolerate before their decision-mak­

Trip to Puerto Rico celebrates anniversary 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 
Just two months after his trip to Uganda as part of the Notre Dame Millennium Development Initiative, University President Father John Jenkins 
celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Pwerto Rico Center for Social Concerns (PRCSC) today by 


making a Jenkins special visit to Puerto Rico to commemo­rate the event. 
"I think it means quite a bit to [the Center] to have Father Jenkins there to celebrate the anniversary," said Liz Mackenzie, director of Senior Transition Programs at Notre Dame's Center for Social Concerns. "The PRCSC is closely tied to Notre Da:me. It is mostly Notre Dame grads who work there and a lot of work is done with the alumni club [in Puerto Rico)." 
According to Frances Shavers, executive assistant to the President, Jenkins will arrive in P)Jerto Rico today and will meet with alumni and friends of the University. He

INSIDE COLUMN 

StopbySMC graduation 
I'd like to thank my fellow reporters, the lovely Amanda MichaeL<>, Kelly Meehan and Kate Antonacci for inform­ing me about what I'm writing about today. 
When I read John-Paul Witt Kate's article on Feb. 16 about WlreNews General Electric Editor CEO Jeffery Immelt coming to Notre Dame to speak at graduation, I felt a little miffed. 
"Surely," I thought, "the speech will be relevant to the theme of 'Go forth and do good,' that all graduation speeches are geared towards, but what about for stu­dents outside of Mendoza?" 
Honestly, we're Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish. The preeminent Catholic university in the world. We have pull .. 
Then I read Amanda's column of Feb. 19, a list of 65 people who would be bet­ter graduation speakers than lmmelt. 
No offense, but I can add a few hun­dred names to her list. 
One of them is Samuel Alita, the speak­er SMC secured for their graduation cer­emony. 
I read Kelly's article of March 5, and I was shocked. I wasn't surprised that SMC could pull a graduation speaker of that caliber, a Justice of the Supreme Court, but that ND couldn't, or chose not to. 
Let's delve a little deeper. 
According to Fr. Jenkins, Immelt's "a business executive worth emulating." He's famous for his environmentally­friendly policies. GE is apparently the "Most Admired Company in the World" according to Fortune magazine. 
That all sounds great, but last year's speaker was the President of Ireland. In that capacity, Mary McAleese had experi­ences that student<> from almost all disci­plines can relate to, unlike Immelt. 
Even ifhe is an exceptionally skilled business executive, he's that, a business executive. 
The generic, motivational-esque speech I feel we can expect from him is a shadow of what Alito, someone who con­fronts national issues of ethics and morality and renders decisions that effect all Americans, will say. 
Don't get me wrong. I love business­people and business students. O'Shag isn't that far from Mendoza. 
But a large number of ND students are going on to careers in politics, academia or a professional discipline. Don't they deserve someone who can speak to their interests, concerns and dreams? 
Granted, no speaker is perfect. An engineer might not get as much out of a given speaker as an Archie, as an English major, etc. 
But shouldn't the first criteria for a speaker be someone who can appeal a) to the Spirit of Notre Dame and b) to most, ifnot all, of the graduating class? 
So, I say, spend a few hours at the SMC graduation. You might just hear some­thing that'll change your life. 
I'd also like to encourage any of you who are interested to attend "Seeking the Heart's Desire," a conference in honor of Fr. John Dunne, CSC, a great man, teacher, and mentor. It's from March 30 to April 1 in McKenna Hall. 
Finally, I'd like to give props to the finches on a statue outside the Riley Hall ofArt and Design. Good job chirping despite the snow, wind and cold. Keep it up.

rent anti-discriminatory clause, which states that the University "does not discrimi­nate on the basis of race, color, national or ethnic origin, sex, disability, veteran status or age," Popit said. 
The Social Concerns commit­tee wanted to recommend that the University's Academic Council add sexual orientation into the clause. 
Popit said she has been working on this resolution most of the year and has researched other top tier and Catholic institutions -specifi­cally schools run by the Congregation of the Holy Cross -to see whether their anti­discriminatory Clauses include sexual orientation. 
"It is very interesting to see how many_ of these schools do have it in their anti-discrimi­natory clauses, including two of'the Congregation of the Holy Cross schools [Holy Cross College in Indiana and King's College in Pennsylvania]," Popit said. 
"This has set a precedent, and it's up to Notre Dame if they want to follow it or not." 
Popit said this is at least the second time in Notre Dame history this issue has been brought to the University administration. The Student Senate and the Faculty Senate both passed similar resolutions in 1998, she said. 
Plamoottil said although attempts in the past have failed, it is important that the Student Senate keep urging the administration to insert sexual orientation into the clause, even if their actions are just "one more drop in the bucket." 

"If we let this go under the table and pretend this doe~n't exist ... then the administra­tion will continually pretend that this isn't a problem," PlamoottH said. 
Fisher Hall senator Drew Clary questioned the appropri­ateness of the resolutions' ref­erences to the Catholic cate­chism or the comparisons it draws to other colleges, but several other senators praised Popit and Plamoottil for their work on the resolution. 
"This resolution is a great 
way for the Senate to stand up against discr~mination without going outside any of the boundaries of the Catholic Church and make that state­ment to the administration," off call)pus senator Mark Healy said.

NDSP under Rakow that he saw firsthand as a NDSP employee in his undergraduate years. 
Rakow was known for his "great sense of humor" and his quiet lead­ership style, Johnson said. 
"He was a terrific professional who had that rare ability to make people like him so he could be effec­tive in a job where you have to say no to a lot of people," Gagnon said. "He was such a good professional with such a good demeanor." 
Gagnon and Rakow were friends before Rakow became Gagnon's boss, bonded by a similar sense of humor -a bond that lasted them through the years. 
Gagnon said he and Rakow would talk throughout the week about two shows they always watched -"NYPD Blue" and "Monk." 
"A fond memory is just sitting in his office and laughing," Gagnon also have to do with his dedication to service, Johnson said. 
"He was a true servant leader," Johnson said. "Rex really was a great teacher, a great mentor to many people." 
After being diagnosed with can­cer, Rakow was named co-chair­man of Notre Dame's American Cancer Society Relay for Life, an event he had been active in prior tO his illness. 
"He was active in many philan­thropic activities. Rex was a person 
. who just thought that the way to make the community a better place was by being active," Johnson said. "Rex thought he was just doing what all of us should be doing in serving not only Notre Dame but our community and serving others." 
Rakow worked until early January, when he took a leave of absence from his position. 
"He basically worked every day until it was too debilitating for him to come in," Gagnon said. 
Since 1979, when he first joined NDSP as an assistant director, loved. 
"When he came here, he was a young man in hi'i profession and we were just a security department," Gagnon said. "Throughout his career here, he oversaw the depart­ment as it went from a security department to a police depart­ment." 
Harold Burke-Sivers, director of public safety at Portland University and president of the Western Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators, remembers Rakow from his time as a full time-officer and student at Notre Dame from 1985-89. 
"My decision to pursue a career in public safety and dedicate my life to serving university students is a direct result of Rex's leadership and mentoring," Burke-Sivers said in an e-mail to Johnson shared with The Observer. "Rex was a truly consum­mate professional, a good friend and a loving husband and father. He made a difference in my life and in the lives ofso many others." 
Burke-Sivers said he was able to

and support over the last 22 years." 
"We often don't have the opportu­
nity to tell people how much they 
mean to us, so this was a real bless­

Last year, the Alumni Association 
also told Rakow how much he 
meant to the community by award­
ing him the 2007 James F. 
Armstrong Award for service by an 
employee to the University. He also 
received an award by the student 
government for his outstanding · service to the campus community. 
"He is not someone who liked or 
needed the limelight," Gagnon said. 
"He didn't need awards to make 
himself feel good. But I'm sure the 
recognition received helped him 
recognized how much he was 
appreciated." 
In 2006, Rakow was also made 
an honorary member of the Notre 
Dame Monogram club -a fitting 
award for a man who intensely fol­
lowed Notre Dame men's and 
women's basketball and had a pas­
sion for golf. 
An alUIIlilus of Oay High School in South Bend, Rakow graduated from Indiana University in Bloomington and received graduate degrees from Southern Illinois University in Carbondale and Notre Dame. He also completed the FBI National Academy's 13-week man­agement training program in 1983. 
Rakow is survived by wife Linda, children Derek and Stacy, their spouses, four grandchildren, a brother and sister, and his mother. · VIsitation will be held at the Halm Funeral Home in Mishawaka from noon to 8 p.m. Friday. A funeral Mass will be celebrated at 9:30 a.m. Saturday at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart.

Indonesian plane crash kills 21 
YOGYAKARTA-Survivors of the fiery crash­landing of a Boeing 737-400 Wednesday said the plane appeared to be going too fast and shook violently before it touched down, lurched off the runway and exploded in flames, killing at least 21 people. 
About 115 dazed and bloodied survivors stag­gered from the Indonesian jetliner after it broke through a fence and came to rest in a rice paddy. Most escaped without major injuries, although several suffered burns and broken bones. 
Those killed were trapped in the wreckage of the Garuda Airlines plane after it suddenly caught fire, sending billowing clouds of black smoke and flames high into the air. The plane had been carrying 140 passengers and crew, officials said. Two people were missing. 
It was the third plane crash in as many months in Indonesia, and raised questions about the safety of the country's booming airline sector. 
French law forbids online violence 
PARIS -A new law in France makes it a crime for anyone who is not a professional jour­nalist to film real-world violence and distribute the images on the Internet. 
Critics call it a clumsy effort by authorities to battle "happy slapping," the youth fad of filming violent acts -which most often they have pro­voked -and spreading the images on the Web or between mobile phones. 
The measure, tucked deep into a vast anti­crime law that took effect Wednesday, has alarmed media advocates who say it tramples on freedom of expression. 
ligue Odebi, an association that seeks to pro­tect freedom of expression on the Internet, said the measure will also hinder citizens' abilities to expose police brutality.

Borat called 'victim of suppression' 
WASHINGTON -Borat, that crass chroni­cler of the American condition, has been sin­gled out by the State Department as a victim of suppression in his own homeland. 
The department's annual human rights report criticizes Kazakhstan for taking action against the satirical Web site of Sacha Baron Cohen, creator of the fictional Kazakh jour­nalist in the film "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan." Baron Cohen also starred in the movie. 
Specifically, the government took control of the registration of .kz Internet domains in 2005 and revoked Baron Cohen's domain because it deemed his site offensive, the report said.

Commons backs historic change 
Legislators begin motion to remove non-elected members of House of Lords 
Associated Press 
LONDON -Legislators took an unprecedented step Wednesday toward ending an age-old tradition of allowing Britain's non-elect­ed elite to hold political power, backing proposals for an entirely elected House of Lords. 
House of Commons law­makers voted 337-224 in favor of developing laws to elect all members of Parliament's upper chamber -potentially one of the most significant constitu­tional changes in British his­tory. 
The move, which requires new legislation, would bring the previously unelected upper house in line with similar institutions, such as the U.S. Senate. 
Jack Straw, leader of the Commons, said the vote was a historic step forward and would meet with others to discuss how to proceed. 
Lawmakers in both the Commons and Lords will hold future votes on the plan when the laws are pro­posed, which cannot happen before the next parliamen­tary session beginning in October. 
Prime Minister Tony Blair voted in favor of a 50 per­cent split between elected and appointed Lords, but he did not take part in the other votes, his Downing Street office said. 
Campaigners lobbying for an entirely elected second parliamentary chamber claim only Lesotho -a poor African kingdom -has a system similar to Britain's, allowing a mix of unelected and hereditary appointees to influence laws. 
The process of appointing peers has been clouded by a police inquiry into allega­tions that Blair's govern­ment, and the opposition Conservative Party, appoint­ed Lords in exchange for financial support. 
Blair succeeded in ejecting 600 hereditary members in 1999 -with the remaining 92 due to be removed once reforms are agreed -but he has been unable to muster broad support behind any new formula for selection. In 2003, lawmak­ers voted down five options for further change. 


Measures voted on Wednesday could be pre­sented to Parliament as a bill before the end of the year but must be debated in both the Commons and the Lords, and -following any amendments -put to a final Commons vote. 
Some legislators fear an entirely elected Lords would present a rival to the supremacy of the House of Commons. 
The House of Lords, which emerged around 700 years ago, does not make laws but has the power to amend leg­islation, subject to the con­sent of the House of Commons, or to delay the passage of legislation for a limited period. 
A bitter clash between peers and Prime Minister David Uoyd George over his 1911 budget·_ which the Lords had threatened to veto -led to a limiting of their powers and brought the first modern call for reform. 
Of 65 nations with a two­chamber parliament, 46 elect most or all representa­tives, according to James Graham, who campaigned for members to be elected. Of the 19 that appoint most or all second chamber law­makers -including Britain and Canada -only five are established democracies, he said. 
Britain, unlike most other democracies, appoints peers for life terms, rather than fixed periods of office. 
Straw, the House of Commons Leader, proposed a 540-seat house -a reduc­tion of around 200. Under his plans, all remaining 92 hereditary peers -mem­bers who inherit their right to be in the chamber -will be removed. 

Some Church of England bishops -known as the Lords Spiritual -will remain, selected by an inde­pendent body reporting to Parliament. 
For most of the chamber's history, all those with inher­ited titles -created by the monarch -could take a place in the Lords, provided they were male, over 21 and citizens of Britain, the Commonwealth or Ireland. Since 1958, women and so­called life peers -mainly drawn from the ranks of retired politicians or those nominated by political par­ties -have also been appointed. 
Law aims to hinder online predators 
Associated Press 
HARTFORD -Connecticut law­makers unveiled legislation Wednesday that would require MySpace.com and other social-net­working sites to verify users' ages and obtain parental consent before minors can post profiles. 
The bill comes a day after a man was sentenced to 14 years in prison for using MySpace.com to set up a sexual encounter with an 11-year­old Connecticut girl. It was one of the first federal sex cases involving the popular site. 
Attorney General Richard 

Blumenthal, who met with other attorneys general on Tuesday, said 10 to 20 other states are considering similar legislation. 
"The technology is available. The solution is financially feasible, prac­tically doable," he said. "If we can put a man on the moon, we can check ages of people on these Web sites." 
Under the proposal, any network­ing site that fails to verify ages and obtain parental permission of users under 18 would face civil fines up to $5,000 per violation. Sites would have to check information about par­ents to make sure it is legitimate. Parents would be contacted directly when necessary. 
Blumenthal said Connecticut has jurisdiction because the advertise­ments posted on the Web sites are seen in the state. 
In a statement Wednesday, MySpace Chief Security Officer 1-Iemanshu Nigam said the company is committed to protecting teens online but does not believe the pro­posed bill is the best way to do that. 
"We have and will continue to focus considerable resources on developing effective ways to make our site safer. Attorney General Blumenthal's proposal, while well intentioned, is not the answer," he said.

"I didn't pick her to go up against that !barrier!. and we didn't even bring it up in the campaign." 
Braun agreed that "making history" was never an objective of theirs. 
"Liz and I, from the start, acknowledged that we were the first all-female ticket running, but our gender never really crossed our minds," Braun said. 
While it certainly wasn't their goal, Brown did concede that they are "certainly proud" and that "it's definitely a cool bene­fit." 
And when they announced the appointment of current Pangborn senator Sheena Plamoottil to the position of Chief Executive Assistant (CEA). they added another female to the head of the stu­dent government hierarchy.

IN BRIEF 
FBI finds mortgage fraud on the rise 
WASHINGTON -The number of mortgage fraud cases investigated by the FBI almost doubled the past three years, reflecting a problem that is "pervasive and growing," the bureau said Wednesday in its annual report on financial crimes. 
The bureau said its mortgage fraud cases increased from 436 in 2003 to 818 in 2006, and acknowledged that its case load likely represents a small piece of the problem. 
The FBI said mortgage fraud is difficult to track for a variety of reasons. For starters, the industry is not required to report fraud. Moreover, the sale of mortgage loans on sec­ondary markets can "conceal or distort the fraud," thereby reducing the number of cases reported. 
"The true level of mortgage fraud is largely unknown," the agency's report said. 
The bureau said fighting mortgage fraud is a priority due to the impact of mortgage lending and housing on the broader economy. 
Stocks stabilize in a calmer market 
NEW YORK -Stocks fell slightly but showed more signs of stability Wednesday as investors sifted through new economic data and found little reason to resume last week's heavy sell­ing pace. 
The stock indexes wavered in a narrow range, reacting little to comments from Chicago Fed President Michael Moskow that inflation remains stubborn and that interest rate increases might be needed to contain costs. The stock market was similarly unim­pressed by data showing a weaker jobs picture and sluggishness in some areas of the country. 
Investors in the past week have harbored concerns about a global economic slowdown and have been looking at data to try to deter­mine whether the U.S. economy is still capable of pulling off a soft landing. 
In late trading, stocks turned lower after drifting higher for most of the afternoon, unable to build on the rally of a day earlier. Tuesday's advance was strong -the Dow Jones industrials made up about 26 percent of the losses they suffered in the previous week -but it left investors wondering whether renewed volatility would subside long enough to allow Wall Street to build some consensus about where stocks were headed. 
Gas prices skyrocket in California 
High costs are expected to spread to the rest of country by this summer 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO Gasoline prices have jumped above $3 a gallon in some parts of California and Hawaii, and may hit that level other parts of the country when the busy summer driving season approaches. 
"It kills me," said Gloria Nunez, 53, as she filled her Ford Explorer SUV at a San Jose gas station. Nunez, a clerk for a com­munications company, has started working a couple hours of overtime each week to help soften the blow. 
"All of a sudden you kind of have to watch your pen­nies," she said. 
Analysts say drivers should brace for more increases in the coming weeks. Crude oil, which makes up about half the price of gasoline, is trading above $60 a barrel. Higher demand, refinery mainte­nance and fears about springtime shortages are also driving up prices, par­ticularly on the West Coast. 
"The West Coast will cer­tainly be the wild, wild West this year," said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst for the Oil Price Information Service. Extensive mainte­nance work at West Coast refineries has curtailed supplies and exacerbated

George Gordon Byron poet 
You began to live on your own much like the Boxcar children did before they were rescued by their rumored-to-be-evil, but 
actually-not-that-bad grandfather. And your parents couldn't confiscate your porn. 
My point'? You've come a long way since your kindergarten days of hanging your Starter jacket in acubby hole and sitting Indian-style on the "magic carpet" during storytime. 
Well, not exactly. Over Spring Break, you might find yourself on a beaeh in the Bahamas, and after you've had a little too much Sex on the Beaeh (the cocktail, of course), you might feel that warm sensa­tion otherwise known as an "accident" dribbling down your leg. Whoops. 
But rogardless, you're older now. "Accidents''-although they have been known to afllict college-age folks-are no longer acceptable. And your Migration, Edueation and Assimilation: Three Forces that Built America professor surely didn't list a spare pair of underwear as a require­ment in the syllabus. 
But she does want you to finish the semestflr-i.e. make it baek to South Bend alive. 
While Cable news feasted on the story of Natalee Holloway when she disappeared in Aruba in 2005, those who knew her were deva..'itated. After all, perhaps she had once been an uber-lova.ble Santa Claus-believ­ing, Boxcar Children enthusiast too. 
You work hard, calculating derivatives and filling up blue books. You undoUbtedly deserve a break. But don't forget that you've lived through a lot. And that you haVI~ a lot left to live tlrrough-more books to read and more heartbreaks to endure. And maybe one of these days you'll even learn how to parallel park. · 
So be safe next week-in whatever cesspool of sin you happen to be swim­ming.

Be mindful of those in need, wherever they're from 
During the Lenten season, the Church asks us to pay special attention to three areas of our lives, namely prayer, fasting and almsgiving. Our Lenten resolutions traditionally include one practice from each of these three areas. By paying special attention to these dimen­sions of our spiritual life, we enable Richard v "the image of Jesus Christ to be Warner cs"c brought to perfection within us" and ' prepare to celebrate with greater joy FaithPoint than ever Easter and the promises it holds out to faithful believers. 
An issue which contains many dimensions for us and which appears frequently in the news has to do with our policies and practices with regard to immigration. The political forces in our country seem to be divided between attempting to develop a compromise which would be fair and just in our treatment of these people and provide a legal solution to the very large numbers of illegal immigrants and growing raids to capture and deport illegal immigrants while stepping up efforts to make our southern border more impenetrable·. 
I believe that when we think about almsgiving, our concern for the poor expresses itself not only in addi­tional acts of service and sharing our financial resources with our brothers and sisters, but also enables us to give people who are poor a special place in our lives during the Lenten season. 
On Sunday, the New York Times published an article titled "Inmates Will Replace Migrants in Colorado Fields." The story expressed the growing concern that farmers in the southeastern portion of Colorado have with regard to how their crops will be harvested this year because of restrictions on immigration ami policies which are new and tough. The farmers are concerned that migrant workers will avoid Colorado and leave their fields of sweet corn, peppers and melons unhar­vested. A solution through a pilot program of the Corrections Department of the State of Colorado will provide supervised low-risk prisoners to harvest these crops. In return, the farmers will pay the state a fixed fee and offer the prisoners 60 cents a day! 
Among the many arguments that are made when the issue of how to deal with illegal immigrants is discussed is the concern that these men and women are taking jobs away from American citizens. While many of these low-risk prisoners surely fall into that category, this solution does not seem at all to address concerns with regard to living wages for field workers. 
Our readings for the Lenten Monday Mass included the codification of the ways in which the Israelites treat-
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Sacrifice is worth it 

What is the difference between making a person into a slave and requiring someone to make a sacrifice for the good of another? That is, when does jus­tice require us to make sacrifices? The question is difficult -and probably impossible -to answer to everyone's satisfaction, of course, but perhaps we can make some progress by considering cases where the harm suffered in the sacrifice greatly outweighs the benefit thereby achieved, or vice versa. The former cases, where trivial goods are achieved through great sacrifice, seem clearly to be in conflict with justice. Just as clearly, on the other hand, justice seems to require minor sacrifices for the sake of very dear goods. We can apply these observations to the question of universal health care. 
First we have the sacrifice, in the form of a more-or-less progressive tax scheme. That is, universal health care requires someone to sacrifice some material wealth, of course, and the burden could be laid more heavily on the shoulders of the more wealthy by requiring them to pay relatively more. Next we have the good, the health and well-being of the poorest members of our society. Lest we think this is a trivial good, I would draw your attention to the fact that, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, over 15 percent of the population had no health insurance in 2002, and it's expected that the num­ber has increased over the past four years. Universal coverage would not prevent all health problems, of course, but it would mean the difference between life and death from preventable and easily treatable diseases for many of the poorest members of our society. 
Now, our observations lead us to these questions: Can we claim, seriously, that the material wealth of the richest members of our society is more important than the health and well-being-indeed, the very lives-of the poorest members? In taxing the wealthy for the sake of the poor, do we forcibly remove men and women from their comfortable and secure lives, strip them of all dignity as free human beings, put whips to their backs and force them to obey the capricious whims of cruel masters? Or is that a more accurate description of the life of poverty? Which is the more egregious vio­lation of justice: requiring a wealthy lawyer to pay taxes or requiring a 10­year-old boy to die from an untreated infection because his mother can't afford for both him and his brother to go to the dentist this year?

ed other people including strangers among them and the scene on the last day when people will be separated according to the way they treated strangers, as well as those who are sick, in prison, naked, thirsty and hungry. The point of the Gospel story is that how we focus our attention on the concerns that together contain the essence of the Beatitudes is critically important for us because when we deal with these brothers and sisters of ours we are truly dealing with Jesus Christ himself. 
While political options in dealing with the issues of illegal immigration will continue to divide our country more and more deeply until some significant and long­standing solution is reached, Lent may be the perfect time for us to remember these people in our prayers and to give serious thought as Christians as we each face the necessity of determining where we stand per­sonally on such a critical issue, one which affects many people who are not only poor, but fellow Christian believers as well.

Eradicate pornography 
In the Tuesday, March 6 edition of The Observer I read an article regarding pornog­raphy in male dorms ("Group discusses pornography in male dorms"). As the Gender Relations Commissioner for Carroll Hall, I felt that I should speak up on the issue. The arti­cle mentioned that students (males and females alike) feel uncomfortable around pornography; this is due to the action of their consciences and is a sign that pornography is not "good" from a moral standpoint. I am extremely embarrassed to say that images of scantily clad women abound in rooms in my hall and all around campus. Alumni Hall senator Danny Smith raised the question (and I paraphrase): "Is Sports illustrated's Swimsuit edition pornography?" My answer is a clear and resounding "Yes!" 
Pornographic images are those which cause males to lust over the female body. When this happens, women are not viewed as people but instead as objects, and the casual and everyday acceptance of pornog­raphy leads to the cultural acceptance of objectification of women. I am not saying that it is wrong to appreciate the female form, as God made us complementary to one another, in body and mind. However, I (and the Catholic Church) feel that a male should appreciate a woman's mind along with her body to support a loving and fulfilling rela­tionship. I hope that some time in the future pornographic (including non-nude but lust­inducing) images will be removed from the dorms to allow students to mature morally as well as academically over their time here, as well as decrease the lack of respect young males seem to have for women in this day and age. 
In the meantime, I look forward to working with the Gender Relations Center and Father Jim Lewis, rector of Carroll Hall, to create programs addressing dorm pornography which will raise awareness of its detriment to moral and academic development and eradi­cate its presence in the dorm completely.

FSD empowers students 
Apathy toward global issues 'critically affects college campuses across the nation. Students attempt to expand their under­standing of the world by studying abroad in other developed countries, but frequently end up spending social time amongst fellow Americans. This all-too-common experience fails to deliver an understanding of the fac­tors that result in poverty for almost half of the world's population in ways that outreach programs such as the Foundation for Sustainable Development (FSD) can. Without students seeing the reality of the developing world, is there truly any wonder why they suffer from apathy? 
Fortunately, an increasing number of uni­versities are working to tackle global poverty by sending their students abroad to intern and volunteer with underserved communi­ties. The recently-opened Blum Center for Developing Economies at the University of California at Berkeley is one example of a prominent school using faculty, students and immense resources to implement projects in developing cotintries. It joins a growing list of schools like Stanford, Northwestern, Princeton, Notre Dame and many others that are shifting their students away from tradi­tional study abroad programs and toward active engagement in the developing world. 
"Colleges are slowly responding to a grow­ing number of students who want the resume builders and skills needed to enter a very competitive job market. Ifone expects to work in a global profession like interna­tional development, he must have active experience abroad. Study abroad doesn't deliver enough experience," says Alex Michel, Outreach Director ofFSD. FSD pro­vides students with hands-on training and project implementation with almost 200 grassroots development organizations in Latin America, East Africa and India. 
Participants in their programs often gain college credit for their internships, but most importantly, they gain experience and the relationships thatallow for entry into a chal­lenging career field. Their internship pro­gram involves students and professionals being trained and given the opportunity to collaboratively design and implement proj­ects that are funded directly by FSD. 
Fundamental to FSD's development philos­ophy is intense cultural immersion and ensuring that all funded projects respond to community needs and avoid imposing west­em ideals on developing communities. To find out more, please visit www.fsdintema­tional.org

FIGHT FEATURE 

Tommy Z hooks, blocks and jabs for charity 
By BRIAN DOXTADER and ERIN McGINN Scene Writers 
The last strains of "Sweet Home Alabama" faded, giving way to a barely­audible bagpipe rendition of the Notre Dame Victory March. The standing-room­only crowd jumped to its feet, while those who had chairs climbed up to get a better look as Notre Dame's strong safety confi­dently paraded toward the ring. 
Tom Zbikowski (or Tommy Z as he's known in boxing circles) climbed into the ring wearing Fighting Irish green trim on his shorts and extended an arm into the air, as Three 6 Mafia's "It's a 'Fight" blared from the speakers. It was a three-ring cir­cus, and the man everyone had come to see was finally taking 
In many ways, the event resembled noth­ing less than a cireus -a raucous and chaotic atmosphere in which there was always something happening. There were "round-card" girls (students from the Chicago-area Harper College) that appeared during eaeh eontest. In one of the more spirited moments, the "round card girls" also threw miniature boxing gloves inio the crowd, which clearly excit­ed the fans. 
There were nearly a dozen lights preced­ing Zibby's, but it was obvious why every­one was there. Though the early bouts were entertaining -including a match that featured Eva Jones-Young, a South Bend native and the three-time female world champion, and a flght that ended in an unquestionable knockout -the audi­ence's impatient buzz became more pro­

No. 9 clearly dictated the pace and flow of the fight, but seemed to ease up in the second round before coming out strong in the third. In fact, St. Germain was probably one of the only guys in the entire Center who wasn't rooting for a speedy knockout. 

Among the familiar Irish faces excited to see Zibby fight were players like John Sullivan, Ryan Harris and Trevor Laws, as well as coaches Charlie Weis and new defensive coordinator Corwin Brown. 
Zbikowski was initially scheduled to go against another fighter, Kevin Murphy from Chicago. Murphy had to drop out, and St. Germain was scheduled in at the last minute after Murphy's boxing license was suspended for testing positive for steroids. 
After the fight, Nagle continued the silent auction and Zbikowski signed autographs for waiting fans. It is estimated that, after expenses, the event raised around $40,000. 
It was an enjoyable evening for all in attendance and a great way to raise money for some worthy causes. And admittedly, it is a guilty pleasure for any opportunity to see Tommy Z in the ring.

DVD REVIEW 

'Samurai' re-issue enhances timeless masterpiece 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Editor 
1954's "Seven Samurai" is widely regard­ed as Akira Kurosawa's finest effort, which in turn makes it one of the finest films of all time. A sprawling, 200-plus minute epic, "Seven Samurai" was groundbreaking for its breadth, depth and well-choreographed action sequences. 
The film's plot is relatively simple-seven samurai band together to ward off thieves who are terrorizing a small village in Japan. Among the protectors are master samurai Kambei (Takashi Shimura), his protege Katsushiro (lsao Kimura), the headstrong Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune) and the master swordsman Kyuzo (Seiji Miyaguchi). A series of strikes and counter-strikes lead up to a climactic battle that tests the physical and mental will of each of the samurai. 

"Seven Samurai" is a deep and powerful film, with many profound scenes, and its sure-footed narrative keeps the film from flagging, though it certainly requires cine­matic patience. The gorgeous black-and­white cinematography {a trademark of Kurosawa) emphasizes the differences between the samurai, the bandits and the villagers. The appearance of guns highlights the sweeping away of the old way, with Kambei standing as a symbol -the most honorable and pure character in the film, he represents one of the last vestiges of tra­dition and honor. The same theme would appear in films for years to eome (especially in the Western), including Sam Pnckinpah's "The Wild Bunch" and Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven." 
Criterion, one of the bondunarks of DVD quality, already released "Seven Samurai" once before in 1998. It was one of the com­pany's earliest DVDs, but Criterion has recently reissued the lilm in a deluxe three­disc special edition. Unlike the original release, whieh was a single disc, the spoeial edition of "Seven Samurai" spreads the !lim itself over two discs, which was a great deci­sion, since it optimizes picture and audio quality -the two elements that should really be the bottom line for any DVD releaSe. · 
The film looks beautiful, having received an "all-new, high definition digital transfer." The image quality is much-improved over the original release, witl1 deeper contrasts and many of the specks and image imper­fections removed. 
The audio comes in the original Japanese mono track, with re-done subtitles, though it's easy to suspect that some of the flavor of 
Kurosawa's script has been 


lost in translation. There are also two audio commen­taries -one by film scholars David Desscr, Joan Mellen, Stephen Prince, Tony Hayns, and Donald Richie -the other by Japanese-film expert Michael Jeck. Jeck's deep, insightful commentary, in particular, lives up to the scholar's reputation as one of .Japanese cinema's foremost minds. 


The bulk of the special features come in the form of three documentaries -a 50­minute "making of," a two-hour video con­versation between Kurosawa and Nagisa Oshima -called "My Life in Cinema" and "Seven Samurai: Origins and Influences," which puts the film in a historical eontext. The best of these is "My Life in Cinema" because it really allows the viewer to get an intimate, poignant glimpse into the heart and soul of Kurosawa. 
Criterion's packaging is also quite nice, as the DVDs come housed in an attractive cardboard case that includes a bookfe't sup­ported by several essays and pictures. 
"Seven Samurai" is one of those films, like "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Schindler's Ji<;t," that everyone should feel obligated to see at least once. Its epic sweep and passionate sense of purpose make it Kurosawa's most ambitious film -no small feat from the director of "Han" and "Rashomon." The filmmaker may have made several other films as accomplished as "Seven Samurai," but the 1954 masterpiece has that rare cin­ematic magic, in whieh everything about the film works -it is, of course, both timely and timeless. 
While realistically it would seem that no release could do "Seven Samurai" justice, Criterion's re-release outdoes its already­high benchmarks, giving one of cinema's greatest gems the lavish treatment it so richly deserves.

sc E &i~~ D Creative concoctions combat culinary conventions 
While some may argue that E-Z-Mac and Hamen noodles are the staples in a college kid's diet, it's inevitable that when it comes to campus food, dining halls are at the top of the list of easy and affordable (heck, to us it feels free) options. Notre Dame is no different, with South and North Dining Hall providing a plethora of delica­cies. 
Well, for the first month of school, any­way. 
After a good five or six weeks, it's almost impossible not to · experience what I like to call "DH Overload" -that sinking feeling you have when, having just entered either South or North, you can only smell the far-too-familiar odor of cod nuggets and fajita pizza. You walk through each line in a state of malaise, and you're just plain tired of what they've got to offer your now-unsatisfied palate. To you, disheartened diner, life seems a little bit dimmer as you resign yourself to sticky rice and Vegetarian Vegetable soup. 
However, there is another solution to DH Overload-pursuing the challeng­ing (but oh-so-gratifying) art of the con­coction. 
"Say what?" you ask, confused and possibly a bit disturbed. But to those of us initiated in the concoction club, the dining hall is a wonderful world of ever­renewing possibilities. You may have seen one of us strolling casually between the food lines before -we are such stuff as homemade pizzas, restau­rant-looking wraps and never-before­seen pasta blends are made on. If you'd Uke to join, the Church of the Concoction is always accepting new converts, and you and your taste buds will definitely be the better for it. For those of you who may be newbies to this art of what is essentially cooking with pre-cooked food, let me enlighten you with a few of my favorites. 

The fact that SDH supplies me with the means to feed my broccoli addiction daily is nothing short of a gift from the dining hall gods. While I too was first trapped in the rut of slapping a hunk of broccoli onto my plate each day, I soon began to expand those food horizons. Currently, my favorite use for broccoli is as a substitute for rice or pasta. Top your broccoli with your favorite sauces, Asian dishes and even the occasional taco salad. Adding extra color and vita­mins to your diet never hurt anyone, and it also tastes pretty ridiculously excellent. . 
For future reference, though, I would­n't recommend adding broccoli to a sandwich. Too wet, too messy and too difficult to eat without looking like a 4-. year-old who can't handle holding a wrap together. 
Salads are another opportunity to go, as Strong Bad would say, "crazy-go­nuts" with variety and concoction happi­ness. Sunflower seeds? Mandarin oranges? Tortellini stir-fry? Nothing is off limits if you pair it with the right greens and a complimentary dressing. 


No longer will you be trapped in the days of wilted -iceberg-and -overripe­tomato salads, my friends. Baby spinach leaves, feta cheese, peppers and bal­samic vinaigrette create what is nothing short of a heavenly blend of loveliness. 
Lastly, never underestimate the power of the panini presses and that Quiznos-· style grilling thingy in aiding your new creations. Toasted wraps are always better than untoasted, and with the sandwich presses even you can achieve cross-hatching grill marks and pretend you're Bobby Flay on "Boy Meets Grill." 
If you're feeling particularly ambitious, you can even use flatbread or pitas to create your own grilled pizzas. 
So what's the bottom line, kids? Getting trapped in a state of DH over­load can happen to anyone, but the ingredients are there to find your free­dom. You just have to get cooking.

CD REVIEW 
'Wellies' play perfect Storm for St. Patty's Day 
By SEAN SWEANY 
Assistant Scene Editor 
With St. Patrick's Day and the Wearin' of the green just around the corner, Irish cul­ture is in full bloom in expectation of the hol­iday. As would-be revelers prepare for parades, parties and green beer, the distinct sound of traditional Irish music can be heard not far behind. For those looking to add some last minute Irish music to their repertoire before the 17th, they need turn no further than "Bring Yer Wellies," the newest album from the acclaimed Irish band Gaelic Storm. 
A California-based traditional lrish group, Gaelic Storm got its start touring Irish pubs near Santa Monica. In 1997, the band starred· as the steerage band in the film "Titanic" and the popularity gained from their appearance vaulted them into the international spotlight as one of the world's top Irish bands. 
Gaelic Storm's self-titled first album reaf­firmed to listeners that the band could pro­duce an Irish sound while incorporating ele-

BringYer Wellies 
ments of rock and other musical instru­ments not usually associated with Irish music. While not a Flogging Molly or Dropkick Murphys, Gaelic Storm spanned the gap between these groups and more tra­ditional ones such as The Chieftains, creat­ing a niche for itself and finding an appre­ciative audience. 
One decade and five albums later, Gaelic Storm shows that it still has the same inge­nuity and energy with its sixth album, "Bring Yer Wellies" ("wellies" is slang Wellingtons, rubber rain boots in Europe). 
Nearly every song in "Bring Yer Wellies" has a fun, carefree tone that one might hear from a band in a reallrish pub. An intricate 
' combination of fiddles, whistles, bagpipes, drums and an accordion allows Gaelic Storm to create full melodies catchy enough to make feet involuntarily tap along in time. The album starts on an upbeat note with the fast-paced song "Scalliwag," where a "raggle taggle gypsy" narrator bids the lis­tener to escape with him over the waters. After this, the album settles into a pattern of alternating between barroom ballads and quicker songs like the first one. One of the notable ·barroom ballads is "Hello Monday," which laments the arrival of the work week after a week­end spent enjoying the previous week's paycheck. Most of these "pub songs" are funny and light­

Recommended tracks: 'Scalliwag,' 'Bare in the Basin,''Hello hearted in nature, 
lending an enjoyable

Monday ' and 'The Salt Lick' 
air to the album. 


Interspersed throughout are several instrumental numbers that make strong use of the electronic bagpipes for which Gaelic Storm is famous. These include fast paced jigs and reels, each containing three parts that flow into each other to create songs worthy of being replayed again and again. 
The best of the instrumentals is "The Salt Lick," which begins slowly and escalates to a rushing tempo dominated by the bagpipes. Here and elsewhere on the album, the bag­pipes have a clear, undisturbed sound that is unlike the sometimes harsh tone real bag­pipes create. 
Each song on "Bring Yer Wellies" gives the impression· of being a live recording while maintaining a clear and rich sound -a dif­ficult feat to accomplish. What makes this even more impressive is that fact that the band recorded the 14-track set in only one month, a testament to their hard work and commitment to their music. 
By the fmal song of the album, entitled "Kiss Me I'm Irish," listeners will feel com­pelled to take to the streets and proclaim this Irish saying to anyone who will listen. In "Bring Yer Wellies," Gaelic Storm delivers a festive collection of genuine Irish sounds, despite technically being an American band. The ·album is the perfect way for anyone ready for St. Patty's Day to get a head start on the merriment.

Associated Press 
Daniel Graham is the lat­est addition to the Denver Broncos, one of the most active teams so far this off­season. 
The Broncos agreed Wednesday with the former New England tight end on a five-year, $30 million deal that includes $15 million in guaranteed money. 
A team spokesman said he could not comment. The deal was disclosed by a per· son familiar with the deal who requested anonymity because it had not yet been signed. 
Meanwhile, the Atlanta Falcons were talking to 35­year-old wide receiver Joe Horn, who was cut last week by their NFC South rivals in New Orleans. 

ESPN .com quoted unnamed team sources as saying the Falcons reached agreement with the outspo­ken receiver, but the Falcons denied it. 
It's not done yet," Falcons spokesman Reggie Roberts said Wednesday night. "We haven't signed a contract, so he's not an Atlanta Falcon. We haven't reached an agreement, so he's not an Atlanta Falcon." 
Graham had been with New England since the Patriots drafted him with the 21st overall pick in 2002. He caught 120 passes for 1,393 yards and 17 
IN BRIEF 
Pistons Hunter suspended
after positive drug test 
NEW YORK -Detroit Pistons guard Lindsey Hunter was suspend· ed 10 games without pay by the NBA on Wednesday after testing positive for phentermine, a banned substance primarily used for weight loss. 
''I'm as shocked as anyone," Hunter said after arriving at the Palace on Wednesday. "It was a diet pill -we've all taken stuff and nothing ever happens." 
Hunter said the pill was pre­scribed for his wife Ivy. 
"We do that at our house -if I've got a head cold, I might grab one of her pills," he said. "It was just a bonehead mistake on my part." 
Phentermine is listed as a steroid or performance-enhancing drug under the league's Anti-Drug pro­gram and brings an automatic 10­game penalty for a first positive test. 
touchdowns in his time with the Patriots, but is now pri­marily a blocker. 
The 6-foot-3, 257 -pound Graham grew up in Denver and attended the University of Colorado. His father, Tom Graham, p1ayed linebacker for the Broncos from 1972 to 1974. 
He joins newly signed running back Travis Henry plus two players the Broncos obtained in trades: cornerback Dre' Bly and defensive tackle Dan Wilkinson. 
In Davie, Fla., Joey Porter passed his physical and signed a five-year, $32 mil· lion contract with the Miami Dolphins. Porter, a three­time Pro Bowler, spent his first eight seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers, who released him last week in a salary-cap move. He ranks fourth in Steelers history with 60 sacks, including seven last year. 

Porter joins a defense that ranked fourth in the NFL in yards allowed and included defensive player of the year Jason Taylor. 
"It's great that we were able to acquire a player of Joey's caliber," Taylor said. "He has been an impact player in this league for many years, and when you add someone who has the ability to make plays like he does, it will help not just the defense, but the entire team." 
Hunter, who is 36 and in his 13th NBA season, averaged 4.6 points, 
1.4 assists and 14 minutes in 39 games as a key reserve for the Eastern Conference-leading Pistons. 
LSU women's basketball 
coach announces resignation 
LSU women's basketball coach Pokey Chatman, who twice took the Lady Tigers to the Final Four after taking over as head coach in 2004, unexpectedly announced her resig· nation Wednesday. 
"I have notified the university today that I will step down as head coach of the women's basketball program in order to allow me to pursue other career opportunities," Chatman said in a prepared state· ment that did not give details about those other opportunities. 
The 35-year-old Chatman said she would stay with the team through the upcoming l':'JCAA tournament and will be under contract until April 30. 
"To eliminate any further distrac· tion from our preparation for and participation in the NCAA tourna· ment, I will have no further com­ment and answer no questions on this subject," she added. 
Ducks defenseman Pronger

ANAHEIM, Calif. -Anaheim Ducks All-Star defenseman Chris Pronger will be out about two weeks because of a broken bone in his toe. 
He was injured during a post· game workout Sunday night, the team said Wednesday. 
Pronger had an X-ray Tuesday night, which revealed the break. He was at the Ducks' arena Wednesday to receive treatment. 
Pronger has endured various mishaps in his first season with the Ducks since being traded from Edmonton.

Woods announces plan to host PGA event 
Golfer also says it's undetermined where event will take place 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Tiger Woods joined elite company Wednesday as one of only three players to host a PGA Tour event during their careers. 
But this wasn't about taking his place with Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. Woods was more interested in the dozen children seated to the side of a packed lounge in the National Press Club, where Woods and PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem announced plans for the AT&T National that marks the return of golf to the nation's capital. 
Still to be determined is where the tournament will be played and the size of the field. 
Woods made clear, however, that the tournament would pay tribute to the military over the Fourth of July, and pay for a new Tiger Woods Learning Center in the Washington area as he expands his foundation's goal to help children. 
"The last year or so, we've been looking up and down the Eastern seaboard for a new learning center," Woods said. "And then this opportunity fell into our laps. It makes sense to build it here, we just haven't had time to find a site yet." 
The first step is to build a tournament. 
The AT&T National replaces the International outside Denver, which shut down last month when tournament founder Jack Vickers couldn't find a sponsor, which he blamed in part on Woods not playing the event. 
It will be played July 5-8, and Woods isn't sure if he will be able to play this year because his wife is expecting their first child. But while Palmer bought the Bay Hill Club and Nicklaus built his own course in his hometown outside Columbus, Ohio, Woods is establishing his tournament roots in Washington. 
"That's our intent, to stay here and have this be our home event, hopefully for perpetuity," he said. 
The Tiger Woods Foundation will run the tournament, with charitable money going to the foundation toward building a learning center. Woods' first learning center, which cost $25 million, opened a year ago in Anaheim, Calif. 
Woods becomes tho youngest player to host a tournament. Bobby Jones was 32 when the Augusta National Invitation ­which later became the Masters -was held in 1934. Nicklaus was 36 when the Memorial was played for the first time. Palmer was 44 when he took over at Bay Hill, and Byron Nelson had been long retired when he gave his name to a tournament in Dallas. 
"Not too many people are for­tunate to have an opportunity like this," Woods said. "What Bobby Jones did for golf and starting the Masters, that won't be touched. As far as what Jack has done at the Memorial, or Arnold at Bay Hill or Mr. Nelson in Dallas, those have been true legends of the game. They made a tremendous impact on our sport. 
"I want to build something along that level," he said. 



"Obviously, with my compotitive nature, I want it to bA bottor." First thfl tour has to soeuro a golf course. 
All signs point toward Congressional Country Club for 2007 and 200R. Thcr club is to vote on the tour's request over the next fow weeks, and Woods and Finchem openly lobbied members to approve it. 
"Right now, the energy at Congressional is very, very posi­tive and very supportive," Finchem said. "And we hope that carries over to the response from tho overall mem­bnrship." 

Finehem said the purse would bn at least $6 million, but he hasn't decided the size of the liold. 
lie said it likely would be comparable to other invitation­als -Memorial, Bay Hill, Colonial -which have fewer than 156-man fields typical of summer events. 
Woods always dreamed of being host of a regular PGA Tour event-he just didn't expect it this soon. 
He started the Target World Challenge, an unofficial event held in California in December, in 1999 and spoke to his father about finding a way to earning full tour status. 
"The way the tour is struc­tured, it didn't look like we would have an opportunity until 2010, '11 or '12," Woods said. "But we were lucky enough that this one came up." 
It eame at the expense of the International, played at Castle Pines outside Denver. Woods only played there twice, the last time in 1999, and didn't return because he didn't care for the golf course. 
AT&T now is title sponsor of five tournaments. The company sponsors PGA Tour events at Pebble Beach and in Atlanta, along with two tournaments on the Champions Tour. Finchem said the deal in Washington would be for at least five years, with an option to sponsor the event through the end of the TV contract in 2012. 
Why couldn't AT&T work in Denver? 
"For whatever reason, we couldn't find any magic for sponsors as it relates to Denver," Finchem said. "We had been trying two years. The sec­ond this is, the International is run by the club and its member. This concept was one where it would be run by the founda­tion." 
Woods already has put his mark on his new tournament.

NBA 
Kobe suspended one game for hit 

AP Lakers guard Kobe Bryant shoots during the second quarter of a 102-94 Los Angeles win Feb. 26 over Utah. 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Kobe Bryant was suspended one game by the NBA on Wednesday for striking a player in the face, his second penalty for that action in a little more than a month. 
And if he does it again, he could be looking at a more severe punishment. 
"We considered suspending him for multiple games," NBA executive vice president Stu Jackson said on a conference call. "Certainly if this occurs again, most likely there would be multiple games." 
The most recent incident came with 58 seconds remain­ing in the fourth quarter of the Lakers' 117-107 double-over­time loss to Minnesota on Tuesday night, when Bryant struck Timberwolves guard Marko Jaric after taking a shot. 
The play was similar to one that drew Bryant a suspension late in January, when he hit San Antonio's Manu Ginobili in the face after taking a shot. Jackson determined that play to have been an unnatural basket­ball action and suspended Bryant from a game at New York. 
There was no foul called on the first play, but Bryant was called for a foul Tuesday. 
Lakers coach Phil Jackson was restrained in disagreeing with the suspension, but could­n't help letting some sarcasm drip through. 
"In this league, everybody's got a pretty face, and we're going to try to keep it that way," Jackson said before the Lakers' game at Milwaukee. 
Jackson acknowledged that the two plays Bryant was sus­pended for are similar, but made it clear that he didn't agree with the punishment. 
"If they're going to make a call. even if they're wrong, they'll still be consistent," Jackson said. 
Bryant, second in the NBA with 29.2 points per game, missed Wednesday night's game and forfeited about $161,000 in salary. 
Jackson said Bryant was sim~ ply using his normal follow­through in an attempt to draw a foul. 
"I think I'm going to have to put about 50 clips of Kobe shooting his shot and his arms going out like that so the judger of this deed of Kobe's sees that he does this a lot," Jackson said. 
"It's not an unnatural basket­ball motion." 
And Jackson said Bryant is hardly the only player who uses his arms to create space for shots or draw fouls, pointing to the Lakers' Dec. 17 overtime loss to Washington in which Gilbert Arenas shot 27 free throws. 
Bucks coach Terry Stotts said he sees Bryant and other star players use their hands aggres­sively all the time. 
"As far as extreme flailing into a face, I don't see that very often," Stotts said. 
"But I think star players throughout the years have fou~d ways to get off them, too. 
Stu Jackson acknowledged being surprised by having this incident come up from Bryant again, but did not want to com­ment on Bryant's intent.

"I was just trying to be aggressive," Heynolds said. "A switch kind of turned on in me where I wanted to be more aggressive on the ball. It ended up where I was going to the line, and, you know, it worked out."

"We've just had two great games," Villanova coach Jay Wright said. "This is going to be a battle, man. That's what it's all about when you get here." 
Sammy Mejia scored 20 points, and Wilson Chandler and Draelon Burns eaeh had 18 for DePaul (lS-13), whieh was playing in its first Big East tour­nament after joining the confer­ence last season. 
"You've got to make open shots, and we didn't make them," DePaul coach Jerry Wainwright said. "It's nut a magic game. They were more efficient than we were. They took advantage." 
Heynolds was outstanding with sonior guard Mike Nardi sidelined for most of the game with a lel't ankle injury. Nardi was injured in tho first half of the Wildcats' victory over Syrac:uso on Saturday, and only played 5 minutes in this one. 
But Heynolds made sure Nardi wasn't completely missed. lie shot 6-of-19 from thc~ lield, ineluding 4-of-11 from 3-point range, and was B-of-16 from the foul line to tie a Villanova record for points in the Big East tournament. Kerry Kittles also scored 29 against Providence on March 11, 1995. 
"Scottie knows what he's doing and he can run the show," Wright said. 
Villanova led 28-26 at half­time, but came out shooting to start the second half. The Wildcats took a 39-28 lead on an 11-2 run that included two 3-pointers by Sumpter and another by Reggie Redding. 
The Blue Demons kept chip­ping away, getting within three points three times, but just 
.eouldn't make any big stops on the Wildcats. 
"Somehow we have to figure out a way to come up aggres­sive and match the other team's intensity because I think that was the difference in the game," Mejia said. "We made a lot of runs when they were up double digits or when they were up and we got close." 
After Mejia got DePaul within live at 57-52 with a layup with 
4:48 left, Heynolds made two free throws and then missed a 3 before Chandler hit one of his own to cut the Blue Demons' deficit to 59-55 with 2:57 left. Redding's jumper made it 61­55, but Mejia hit two free throws with 2:07 remaining to make it a four-point game. 
It was a foul shooting clinic from there, with Villanova going 14-of-18 from the line, includ­ing Reynolds' 6-of-8, as the Wildcats sealed the victory. It was a good thing Villanova was so good from the foul line -33­of-38 compared to DePaul's 16­of-19 -because it shot just 17­of-4 7 (36.2 percent) from the field. 
"If it does get into a free­throw shooting contest, usually we're pretty good," Wright said. "That gave me confidence. We talked about finishing games. If we can get into a position where we've got the lead, we're usually pretty good because our guys shoot well." 
West Virginia 92, Providence 79 
If West Virginia keeps hitting shots from all over the Madison Square Garden court, it might have a long stay in the Big East tournament. 
West Virginia made a Big East tournament record 17 3-point­ers and the seventh-seeded Mountaineers beat Providence in the opening round Wednesday night. 
"When we shoot like that we're a tough out," coach John Beilein said. "We've had moments where we're extreme­ly efficient. We really did a great job tonight." 
The win kept alive West Virginia's chances of an atclarge bid to the NCAA tournament should it not win the conference title. 
"I think the best idea for everyone in the eountry is just to keep winning," Beilein said. "I know the NCAA selection committee does a terrific job, but we just need to keep win­ning and not worry about any of that." 
Frank Young and Alex Ruoff each scored 21 points for the Mountaineers, who moved into the quarterfinals against sec­ond-seeded Louisville on Thursday night. 
"Twenty hours and we're back playing again," Beilein said.

loss of starting point guard Kyle McAlamey to suspension, the Irish went 23-6 overall and 11-5 in the Big East during the regular season. Almost every statistical category improved tremendously. Russell Carter became one the confer­ence's premier scorers. Tory Jackson and Luke Harangody made the Big East All-rookie team. Colin Falls a..c;sumed leadership of the team and guided the locker room through thick and thin. 
All in all, it was Mike Brey's sea­son of redemption. He silenced the critics, fixed his earlier mistakes and put a surefire NCAA Tournament team on the floor. 

But Brey and his team can't be finic;hed yet. They still have some demons to exorcise, beginning today in the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament in Madison Square Garden against Syracuse. 
Brey (and the Notre Dame pro­gram for that matter) has seen nothing but frustration in the Garden in the past. The coach is just 2-6 in the Big East tourna­ment, while the Irish overall-have gone just 3-11 since joining the conference before the 1995 season. 
The Orange (22-9, 10-6) come into tomorrow's game red hot and with a chip on their shoulder. Since losing to the Irish 103-91 Jan. 30, Syracuse has won seven of nine, blistering past Connecticut Tuesday, 78-65 in the first round. 
So with all that working against them, why should Notre Dame expect to win today? 
Because this team refused to stop believing in itself. Not when it was picked the finish 11th in the Big East. Not when it lost to Butler Nov. 13, 71-69 on a missed last second shot by Carter that was eerily reminiscent of 2005-06's close losses. Not even when McAlamey wa..c; suspended for a semester and Jackson was thrown into the fire a..c; the starting point guard. 
Mike Brey needs this win and maybe a couple more for good measure while his team is in New York Even his three NCAA Tournament teams faltered in the Big East tournament. l-Ie's fixed many of the problems with his pre­vious teams this year (inside play, defense, winning games), but all that redemption won't matter if the Irish bomb out of yet another con­ference tourney. 
Fortunately for Brey, this is the team to do it. This is the team that can win a game or two -or maybe even three -in the Garden, see their NCAA Tournament seed rise the week before Selection Sunday (instead of fall) and get rid of' the one blemish their coach's critics can still point to on his record. 
They don't need to win the tour­nament or -even make it to the championship. They just have to come out poised and make a good showing to tell the selection com­mittee and the nation that this is a new era in Notre Dame basketball and the days of meekly bowing out of the conference tournament are over.

NFL 
Lewis signs one-year deal vvith Cleveland 
Associated Press 
CLEVELAND -The Browns finally tackled Jamal Lewis. 
Unable to reach a deal to remain in Baltimore, the free agent running back signed a one-year deal on Wednesday with Cleveland, the team he blistered for an NFL single­game record 295 yards in 2003. 
Lewis was released last week in a salary-cap move by the Ravens, who elected not to pay their career rushing leader a $5 million roster bonus. He'll now join the Browns, Baltimore's AFC North rival, who were last in the league in rushing in 2006. 
"We are pleased to add Jamal Lewis to our team," Browns general manager Phil Savage said in a statement. "He is a proven NFL back who brings a toughness and demeanor to the game that his teammates and our fans will appreciate." 
Lewis, 27, visited the Browns on· Wednesday and decided to sign with the team before leaving town or talking 
to another team. Financial terms were not immediately available. 
Lewis' agent, Mitch Frankel, did not return several mes­sages seeking comment. 
With the Ravens reportedly interested in acquiring Buffalo running back Willis McGahee, Lewis decided to look else­where and found a fit with the Browns -one of the teams he has torched while rushing for 7,801 yards and 45 TDs in seven seasons. 
Lewis spent the afternoon at the Browns' facilities in sub­urban Berea, meeting with Savage and coach Homeo Crennel. Savage was with tho Ravens in 2000 when the club drafted Lewis in the first round out of Tennessee. 
Lewis, the NFL's Offensive Player of the Year in 2003, is an upgrade at running baek for the Browns, who now have to figure out what to do with feature back Reuben Droughns. They owe Droughns a $1.75 million ros­ter bonus later this month, but may choose to cut him instead.

Freshman attacker Will Yeatman needs to eon­tinue his scoring sueenss. Along with Podgajny, hn leads the team with nine points. Sophomore attacker Hyan lloiT also has helped out with four goals and two assists of his own.

Midto-wn ntadness 
Irish hope to duplicate winning ways against Syracuse in Big East 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Writer 

NEW YORK -The last time Notre Dame played Syracuse, the Irish utilized an up-tempo transition offense to set their season high point total in a 103­91 win over the Orange Jan. 30 in the Carrier Dome. 
But Notre Dame coach Mike Brey expetts the teams' second meeting to be different. The Irish face the Orange at 2 p.m. today in an ESPN televised quarterfinal of the Big East tournament at Madison Square Garden in New York City . 

-"I would think if we play Syracuse they will play zone for 40 minutes," Brey said. "They will sit in it arid make us play against that for 40 minutes. I was surprised that we didn't see it at all [last time]." The Orange (22-9, 10-6 Big East) broke away from their traditional 2-3 zone in the teams' first matchup and played man-to-man defense -but to little use. Playing without

New York offers Brey chance to cap surprise season, improve seed 
NEW YORK-The last three seasons had been rough for Notre Dame men's basketball. And no one had taken more heat than coach Mike Brey. 
After two years of being on the wrong side of the bubble and last year's dis­astrous 1-8 start in the Big East, expecta­tions were very low fbr the 2006-07 Irish. 
There were numerous questions. Where would the lrL'ih inside-game come from? Would the young point guards be able to run the team? Would Notre Dame be able to do anything offensively aside ti·om shooting threes? Would Brey keep his job if his team missed out on another NCAA Tournament bid? 
Six months later, those questions are a distant memory. Despite the
