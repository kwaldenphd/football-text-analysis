Campus empties as students depart on break 
Vacation plans vary from home to abroad 
By JEN ROWLING

As the stress of midterms subsides, suitcases are replacing books and students are focused on fall break activities from football games to trips abroad. 
Some. like Pasquerilla West sophomore Aly McKillen, aren't terribly concerned about following set plans. 
''I'm going to Long Island to stay with a friend from NO and we're going to the city and whatever else. It really is not that planned of a trip. We might go to the boy's soccer game at St. John's,"McKillen said. 
Among the swirl of plans to catch some surf and sun, a group of Notre Dame stu­dents have planned a trip down ·south for the week, 
"We are going to road trip down to Mobile [Ala.] where I am from. Then spend some time in New Orleans and Nashville before coming back to NO," Dillon junior Zach

O'Hare travellers hope new regulations decrease delays 
By PETER LEAHY 
News Wrirer 
As students pour into air­ports to hop. a flight back home for fall break, they will inevitably face the dreaded delay. Unfortunately for those who take advantage of Chicago's air travel options, O'Hare International Airport has been recognized as one of the worst airports in the nation. 
In an effort to reduce the sys­tem-wide congestion caused by the problems at O'Hare, the Federal Aviation Administration made an agree­ment with airlines in August to cut 37 peak-hour arrivals at the hub airport. 
The reduction of flight traffic is expected to reduce delays at O'Hare by about 20 percent and across the rest of the national air. network by 5 per­cent, airport officials said. Before the FAA stepped in, records indicate that only 6 7 percent of flights were arriving there on-time 
"After meetings [last August] with the FAA the airlines vol­untarily came to an agreement to cut flights," Annette Martinez. spokeswoman for the City of Chicago Department of Aviation, said. "We were at the bottom of the top ranking U.S. airports in the U.S. in May. Now we are 26th." 
Martinez was referring to Bureau of Transportation sta­tistics that rank the major national airports based on the number of delays, with the slower aiTports lower on the list. 
Martinez said that the rise is probably due to improved

Ready for a break 
I'm not sure I can even describe how happy I am that it is finally fall break. During the past eight weeks I have put in countless hours at The Observer office, written a file folder's worth of papers. read noveL'>. plays and poems, put together lesson plans for the sen­iors I teach at Washington lligh School-I'll stop the list there.

inside, reminding me that the school year is a quarter over. and I'm that much closer to graduation. 
I'm not sure I can even count how many people have asked me the infa­mous question. "So, what are you doing alter graduation?" 
The truthful anstver is, I Just don't know. 
Over the past few weeks, many of my friends have started interviewing for jobs. Some already have offers. But for people like myself who aren't sure where they will be living or what they will be doing after graduation, thinking about the future makes my throat constrict. 
From the time I was little, I always thought I would be a teacher. Throughout middle school and high school, I watched my mother, a middle school teacher, touch lives and forever change her students. And I want to do that. 
But during my sophomore year at Saint Mary's, I found journalism, and things have been confusing ever since. Ideally, I'd like to do both: Teach high school EnglL'ih and freelance write on the side. But it would be nice to have a social life too. 
During my junior year, I thought I had all the time in the world. Over the sum­mer, I was carefree. mostly unconcerned with what my future held. But coming back to Saint Mary's, the topic is ever. present, and I need to make some deci­sions -fast. 
I don't know what the future holds. While that's exciting, more than that. it's scary. I remember thinking college was daunting, but the real world is down­right petri1ying. 
I won't have the things I've come to rely on at Saint Mary's-friends around every corner, tunnels to avoid walking outside to class in the rain and (although 
I sometimes complain about it,) a dining hall ready to serve me at meal times. 
The real world is looming, and that's a fact that has to be faced. Over break, along with relaxing. I need to update my resume, get my writing portfolio in order and if I feel up to it. perhaps start looking at geographic locations I could move to. 
I thought college would last forever. Four years seemed like an eternity the first time I stepped onto campus. And now, everyday I wake up knowing that I have one less day as a college student. 
So. while I will certainly be enjoying my time off. I can't help but think that this is my last fall break -Ijust don't think I'll be getting one when I enter the job force. For now, I'll just pack, and ponder what the future holds.

British prefer death to spiders 

LONDON -Spiders are more scary than terrorists ­at least according to a sur­vey of a thousand Britons. 
Household creepy crawlies frighten Britons more than terrorist attacks, or even death, the survey found. 
Terrorism came second on the list of respondents' top 10 fears, according to the survey conducted by RSGB Omnibus for Universal Pictures UK Ltd. The survey was based on telephone interviews of 1,000 aged 16 to 55 across Britain. 
Another crawling phobia -snakes -was ranked third, followed by a fear of heights. Death came in a surprising fifth place as the nation's greatest fear.

Students cantpaign during break 
By NICOLE ZOOK News Writer 
Unlike many of their peers, many politically-minded Notre Dame and Saint Mary's stu­dents are using next week's hiatus as an opportunity to actively campaign for the upcoming presidential election. 
Some members of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College Republicans and College Democrats will be spending their break canvassing door to door in their own neighbor­hood, rallying support for their preferred candidate. 
Saint Mary's College Republicans co-president Mary Allen said that while the club itself does not have any activi­ties planned over break, many of its members will participate in these door-to­
door campaign ':4 lot ofpeople are Once you're efforts of their going to get involved involved with

also be spreading the political word. 
"A lot of people are going to get involved and volunteer as much of their time as they can while they are at home," Taylor said. 
Taylor will be participating in the campaign efforts during the break. 
"I live in Ohio, and I'm going home to work all week for the Kerry campaign in Ohio," he said. "It's so close in Ohio right now ... it's virtually a dead heat, and I just want to help out as much as I can. And I enjoy doing it." 
Also from Ohio is Sarah Staley, president of the Saint Mary's College Democrats, who said she is excited to see John Kerry speak in her home state on the first Saturday of the 
break. 
"It's a great 
opportunity. 
same things like 
going door-to­

door and phone banking," Staley said. 
Staley said by contributing to the campaign efforts in their own hometowns, club mem­bers are "taking a step in the right direction." 
Allen agreed, emphasizing the importance of making information available for all. 
"It's important to get the vote . out," she said. "Some people really don't know who is run­ning or what the candidates believe. It's important that everybody gets out there and expresses their opinion." 
Notre · Dame College Republicans co-presidents Tom Rippinger and Ian Ronderos have already planned club activities for when school resumes. 
"We have contacted the Michigan Republicans," Rippinger said. "As soon as we get back, we want to do some swing state work in Michigan. Especially in the 72 hours before the vote, it's important to kick it up." 
Ronderos agreed that the few days before the election will be crucial for all candi­dates. 
"We're going to skip classes on Election Day to work for the Mitch Daniels campaign," he said. 
Democrats from both col­leges will also be participating in additional events as the election draws nearer. Together, the clubs will attend a Kerry rally in Battle Creek the last Sunday of fall break and canvas neighborhoods, including a trip to the Toledo area the weekend before the election. 
"We're going to be going door to door, making sure peo­ple can get out to vote," Staley said. "The day of the election, a few of us are going up to Michigan to be runners, doing things like checking off lists of people who need to vote and helping the elderly to get rides. It will get students and resi­dents pumped up for the elec­tion."

Graduate school dean named AAAS fellovv 
Special to The Observer 

Jeffrey Kantor, vice president for graduate studies and research and dean of the Graduate School, has been named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). 
Kantor is the 10th AAAS fel­low in the history of the University and the only engineer to be so honored. The others are: Subhash Basu, Harvey Bender, Frank Collins, Thomas Fehlner, Richard Fessenden, W. Robert Scheidt, Phillip Sloan, Anthony Trozzolo and Paul Weinstein. 
Founded in 1848, AAAS serves sqme 262 affiliated societies and academies of science and 10 million. individuals. It is an inter­national non-profit organization dedicated to advancing science around the world by serving as an educator, leader, advocate and professional association. Fellows are recognized for com­mendable efforts to advance sci­ence or its applications. 
Kantor also has been reap­pointed to the board of the Indiana 21st Century Research and Technology Fund. The fund was created in 1999 by the General Assembly to stimulate the process of diversifying the state's economy by developing and commercializing advanced technologies in Indiana. The enabling act created a board, representing most of the aca­demic and commercial sectors of the state, which establishes fund awards. reviews policies and approves awards. Kantor, who had previously been appointed to the 21st Century Fund board in July 2001, will serve through September 2006. 

Kantor was elected vice presi­dent for graduate studies and research in 2001. He is respon­sible for both the development and state of all postbaccalaure­ate work in the University and for the development and admin­istration of all research conduct­ed by its faculty. 
Prior to assuming his current position, Kantor served for five years as vice president and asso­ciate provost of the University. In that role, he established the University's Web administration office, created and filled the position of chief information offi­cer, and was instrumental in academic budget and space planning. He also chaired the Provost's Task Force on Strategic Directions in Science and Engineering. 
A member of the Notre Dame faculty since 1981, Kantor is a professor of chemical engineer­ing and specializes in chemical process dynamics and control theory. His research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and sev­eral industrial sponsors. 
Former ND tailback returns to work at OIT 
Special to The Observer 
Former Notre Dame tailback Reggie Brooks is full of surpris­es. 

In 1992, he surprised coach Lou Holtz by making a seemingly impossible catch of a two-point conversion pass in the back of the end zone, securing an Irish win over Penn State with only 20 seconds left in the game. 
That same season, he sur­prised Irish fans when he rushed for 1,343 yards, knocking one of the famed Four Horsemen from the record book and coming within inches of breaking the yards-per-carry record set by George Gipp in 1920. 
As a running back for the Washington Redskins in 1993, Brooks became the first rookie to lead the team in rushing in 18 years. This may have shocked Washington fans, but the Irish faithful had learned to expect the unexpected. 
Today, Brooks -and his cur­rent "team" position -might surprise the Notre Dame com­munity once again. 
Eleven years after leaving Notre Dame to play professional ball, first for the Redskins and then for Tampa Bay, Reggie Brooks has returned to Notre Dame to pursue another love: computers. -­

Last February, Brooks, his wife, Christina, and four children relocated to South Bend when he was offered a full-time position with the Office of Information Technologies (OlD as an admin­istrator of production systems. A management information sys­tems major as an undergradu­ate, Brooks is a configuration management specialist. 
"It was a funny thing how it worked out," Brooks says. "I had applied for a position here sever­al months before, and then did­n't really think much of it. Then, a few weeks prior to getting a call about the-· position, my wife and I were discussing possible places to raise a family." Three weeks later, Brooks heard from OIT, and tqe move just seemed to make sense. 
Both he and his wife are nos­talgic for Notre Dame, having met here as students. They were both optimistic about the oppor­tunity to raise their family in a community with such strong tra­ditions. 
Brooks is immersed in the Renovare Project, the cam­puswide replacement of the University's information systems. A few of his responsibilities include verifying changes and defining processes that allow OIT to track changes to the sys­tem more efficiently -all to ensure that the University is able to make a seamless transition to the new system. 
Surprise, again: His office has only a football calendar to sug­gest Brooks' past. There is not a piece of college or pro memora­bilia to be seen. A slot in the U93 radio post-home-game show is where Brooks reconnects with his past. 
If his pro career ended prema­turely, Brooks' observations indi­cate it was getting time for him to move on. "Football is a busi­ness," Brooks says. "Even col­lege ball is becoming a business. You lose a lot of joy in playing because of it. It has hurt the game in my mind."

"I am going to New Jersey with a bunch of friends to watch ND dominate Navy, to sleep and to go out in New York City," senior Helen Kearney said. 
"For fall break I am going back to New Jersey to go see the Navy game, root on the Irish and tailgate with my family and friends from school. For the rest of the week I'm just laying low and playing some golf," Keenan sophomore Greg Stewart said. 
The Notre Dame student section at Navy game might be less than a sea of green, however, as director of stu­dent activities Brian Coghlin said that a number of stu­dents did claim their Navy tickets they won in this week's Student Union Board ticket lottery. 
At least 40 pairs of tickets currently untaken, and they are available for purchase by any student. 
Whether it is time spent here, at home or aboard, the break will be welcomed after a long, weary week of midterms.

Conference examines economic growth 
Special to The Observer 
Understanding the condi­tions necessary for economic growth in developing coun­tries will be the focus of a conference on Oct. 15 and 16 at the University of Notre Dame. 
Organized by Notre Dame's Department of Economics and Econometrics, "The Seng Conference on Money, Banking and Economic Development" will bring together economists from around the world to examine factors for economic growth in countries that enjoy high standards of living, and bar­riers to development in coun­tries that do not. 
"The most important driv­ers of development are tech­nological advancement, inter­national trade. financial intermediation, and invest­ment in physical and human capital," said Christopher J. Waller, Gilbert Schaefer Chair of Economics and primary organizer of the conference. "Data show that high stan­dards of living are observed in those countries that engage in these a·ctivities, whereas there are no exam­ples of countries enjoying high standards of living that do not engage in these activi­ties. We need to understand why some countries do not adopt them." 
Presenters at the confer­ence will explore governmen­tal policies that enhance trade, strengthen payment systems and encourage investment, as well as those monetary policies that destroy banking systems and credit markets.

"On time performance has improved mainly because of better weather," Martinez said. "It could have been the flight cuts but we won't know that until we have more time to assess the impact of the flight cuts." 
Whether it's the weather or the cuts, students routed out of O'Hare are crossing their fin­gers for a smooth trip. 
One of the unlucky ones, Zahm freshman Creston Brown said he was once delayed 20 hours on a flight going to China. 

"Our flight was scheduled for 7 a.m. and we left after mid­night," he said. 
Over break, Brown is flying from the South Bend Airport to O'Hare to his home in Columbia, S.C. He has an already scheduled three-hour layover at O'Hare, but Brown said he can handle it. 
"After 20 hours three hours doesn't seem like much," Brown said.

U.S. crew headed to the international space station Thursday, surging into orbit aboard a Soyuz spacecraft none of the three astronauts has piloted before. 
The Soyuz have been the only manned vehi­cles able to reach the orbiting research lab since the U.S. space shuttle fleet was grounded 20 months ago after the Columbia burned up on re-entry. 
Russians Salizhan Sharipov and Yuri Shargin and American Leroy Chiao were flying their first mission in a Soyuz spacecraft -a rare rupture with a tradition of having at least one crewman with previous experience in piloting the capsule. 
Chiao and Sharipov both have flown U.S. space shuttles, while Shargin is a spac~ rookie. 
Over one million register to vote 
RAMALLAH, West Bank -More than one million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza have registered to vote in upcoming municipal and general elections, officials said Thursday, completing the first phase in an often delayed election process. 
The voter registration drive launched by the Palestinian Authority last month officially ended Thursday. although officials at the Central Election Commission said 16 of its offices will remain open. 
In the first days of the drive, few of the 1.8 million eligible voters turned out to register, citing frustration with official corruption and Palestinian leader Vasser Arafat's inability to bring an end to the conflict with Israel. 
The commission embarked on a wide adver­tising campaign, and the Islamic Hamas called on its supporters to register in large numbers.

Judge rejects Jackson request 
SANTA MARIA. Calif. -A judge Thursday rejected a defense request to throw out the indictment against Michael Jackson, saying prosecutors had presented enough evidence of child molestation and an attempt to silence the alleged victim's family for the case to go forward. 
Judge Rodney S. Melville rejected argu­ments that the indictment should be thrown out because of prosecutorial misconduct, improper legal instruction and insufficient evidence. 
The decision came after perhaps the most unusual of a string of media restrictions in the secrecy-shrouded case against the pop star: Reporters and other members of the public were prohibited from talking in court, even before the proceedings. 
Student convicted of manslaughter 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.-A Harvard graduate student was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to six to eight years in prison Thursday for stabbing a young man to death in a fight that heightened the generations-old tension between the Ivy Leaguers and work­ing-class Cambridge. 
Prosecutors had charged 26-year-old Alexander Pring-Wilson with murder in the slaying last year of Michael Colona, arguing that Pring-Wilson attacked the 18-year-old Colona for ridiculing him as he stumbled home drunk.

Cheney stops in South Bend 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. -The presidential campaign made its way into Indiana for the first time in three months, although it turned out to be little more than a rest stop on the way to the battleground state of Michigan. 
Vice President Dick Cheney flew into South Bend on Thursday evening and planned to overnight there before making a bus tour through southwest Michigan on Friday. He did not have any public events in South Bend.

Marines launch attacks on Fallujah after city delegation suspends peace talks 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD U.S. Marines launched air and ground attacks Thursday on the insurgent bastion Fallujah after city represen­tatives suspended peace talks with the government over Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's demand to hand over terror mastermind Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. 
Late Thursday, residents of the city, 40 miles west of Baghdad, reported shudder­ing American bombard­ments using planes and armored vehicles in what they said was the most intensive shelling since U.S. forces began weeks of "pre­cision strikes" aimed at al­Zarqawi's network. 
In Washington, however, a senior military official, speaking on operational matters on condition of anonymity, described the latest fighting as strikes against specific targets and of the same scope as previ­ous attacks into Fallujah. 
Warplanes and artillery pounded the city as two U.S. Marine battalions attacked rebel positions to "restore security and stability," 1st Lt. Lyle Gilbert, a spokesman for the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, told CNN. 
"It is going to be a long night," he said. 
Maj. Francis Piccoli, spokesman for the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, told The Associated Press that two Marine battalions were engaged in the fight backed up by aircraft. 
He would not say the attack was the start of a major campaign to recap­ture the city, saying he did not want to jeopardize any future operations. 
Piccoli said the goal of the operation was to "disrupt the capabilities of the anti­Iraqi forces." 
"Ultimately, the intent is to help the Iraqi government bring in democracy," he added. "As you bring in sus­tained security and stability, the Iraqi government can 
Advisers say safeguards sufficient 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Federal health advisers unanimously agreed Thursday that current safeguards on blood donations in the United States are sufficient despite the disclosure that a second British resident most likely acquired mad cow disease through a tainted transfusion. 
"The United States is not Great Britain," said Dr. Stephen DeArmond, a University of California-San Francisco pathology professor. DeArmond pointed to the lack of evi­dence that so-far symptomless mad cow infections suspected in thousands build on as they go into elec­tions" in January. 

U.S. officials believe al­Zarqawi's terrorist group, Tawhid and Jihad, is head­quartered in Fallujah. The group purportedly claimed responsibility for two suicide bombings inside the heavily guarded Green Zone in Baghdad on Thursday, according to a statement posted on a Web site known for its Islamic content. The unprecedented attack killed 10 people, including four Americans, and wounded 20. 
The U.S. military said its targets were linked to al­Zarqawi's terrorist network, including a building being used to store weapons, two safehouses used to plan 
of British residents are an issue in this country. 
The Food and Drug Administration advisory committee agreed that donor restrictions are still warranted. But it stopped short of asking for additional safeguards in the United States to fur­ther prevent the risk of transmission of mad cow disease through blood. 
The agency already bars blood donations from people who lived more than three months in Great Britain or who received transfusions there after 1979. 
In both confirmed British infections, recipients got blood from donors who were young and apparently healthy at the time of donation. The chances attacks, several illegal checkpoints and a weapons cache. 
At least five people were killed and 16 wounded, according to Fallujah General Hospital. 
Fallujah residents said the Americans were attacking several areas with rockets, artillery and tanks. One resi­dent said U.S. forces were using loudspeakers in the west of the city to urge Fallujah fighters to lay down their arms "because we are going to push into Fallujah." 
Residents reached by tele­phone from Baghdad also said there were sharp clash­es in the northern part of the city, which was a major battlefield during last April's Marine siege of Fallujah. 

that two confirmed infections among people who received blood was caused instead by eating mad-cow tainted beef were remote -1 in 80,000 to 1 in 1 billion, the panel was told. 
Getting the human form of mad cow disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, through tainted blood "is a reality. And we've got to treat it like that," said Steven Anderson, an FDA risk assessment expert. 
The new case involves a woman in her 80s who died from an unrelated medical condition early this year, according to Dr. Robert Will, a neurol­ogist who founded the British mad cow surveillance team. 
Allawi warned Wednesday that Fallujah must surren­der al-Zarqawi and other foreign fighters or face mili­tary attack. 
Abu Asaad, spokesman for the religious council of Fallujah, said that "handing over al-Zarqawi" was an "impossible condition" since even the Americans were unable to catch him. 
"Since we exhausted all peaceful solutions. the city is now ready to bear arms and defend its religion and honor and it's not afraid of Allawi's statements," Asaad said in a live interview with Al-Jazeera television. 
However, he used the Arabic word for "suspend," implying that the talks could resume later.

''The West Wing'' eyes Republican successor for Bartlet 
President's second term to end soon; change could rejuvenate ratings 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES The 
prospect of a change in the 
White House tends to draw a 
strong reaction. pro or con. 
Not from "The West Wing" executive producer John Wells, though. lie seems unfazed by the coming end of Democratic President Josiah "Jeb" Bartlet's tenure -and maybe even a Republican successor. 
"We were a year and a half into the administration when we started the show," Wells said of the NBC drama enter­ing its sixth season. "We have term limits in this country and so, on our electoral schedule, Bartlet's second term would end a year from this coming January." 
That fact foreshadows a hybrid season when "The West Wing" returns Wednesday (Oct. 20, 9 p.m. EDT). Bartlet (Martin Sheen) grapples with his legacy while others fight for the chance to replace him. 
Among them are contenders played by two familiar actors: Jimmy Smits ("NYPD Blue"), who's a potential Democratic candidate, and Alan Aida ("M­A-S-II") vying for the GOP nomination. 
Also in the running is Vice President Hussell (Gary Cole). with talented staff member Will Bailey (Josh Malina) at his side. 
Could Wells envision "The West Wing," if re-elected by NBC to a seventh season, with a Republican president? 


Wal-Mart's expansion plans hit road block 
Associated Press 
TEHHE HAUTE. Ind. -The City Council has at least tem­porarily blocked zoning approval for a new Wal-Mart store. the latest stumble for the retail giant's expansion plans in Indiana. 
Discussion of the planned 
store on Terre Ilau te 's north side drew a crowd Tuesday night that packed a City Hall meet­ing room. with many applauding those who spoke against the proj­ect. 

The council voted 4-3 against a zoning change for the store. Two council members. 
however, were absent, and one councilman who at first voted to approve the store changed his vote. meaning he could ask for it to be reconsid­ered as soon as next month.

Low-profile drive worries retailers 
COSTA MESA, Calif. -Few people took notice when Sony Electronics Inc. opened a tiny storefront last year here at South Coast Plaza, a swanky mall south of Los Angeles. 
As it turns out, the small store would rep­resent a big change in how Sony sells its tel­evisions, DVD players and other gear. 
Since opening its first store last year, Sony has quietly opened stores in seven other cities. The Japanese giant will open in its 11th and 12th U.S. stores this month, in Denver and Las Vegas, and expects to have about 30 Sony Style stores in the United States by April 2006. 
Some retailers that sell Sony products worry they will lose sales. They also worry that if the stores are successful. other manu­facturers will open stores, too. 
"We're going to watch very closely what they do with these stores," said Tom Campbell, vice president of Ken Cranes Home Electronics Inc., a chain of eight stores in Southern California. "The manufac­turer is becoming a potential competitor." 
Company wants 30,000 stores 
SEATTLE -Java junkies often must jour­ney more than two blocks to find a Starbucks, which the company sees as a problem, its chief executive said Thursday. 
As a fix, Starbucks plans to more than triple the number of its worldwide outlets to 30,000, with half of those in the United States. 
"Despite what you hear now that we must be nearing saturation in North America, that is not true," Chief Executive Orin Smith told analysts, saying convenience mattered both to frequent and infrequent Starbucks customers. 
"Americans don't walk, so if you have to go more than two blocks, they don't go," he said. 
Starbucks will focus its growth in American suburbs and small towns, with many of the new coffee shops being drive-throughs. It cur­rently has about 8,500 stores, including 6,100 in the United States. 
One reason for Starbucks' rapid expansion is demographic. Smith said the company is seeing younger, less affluent, less educated and more ethnically diverse customers. 


U.S. trade deficit skyrockets 
Imports swamp exports as Americans buy Chinese cell phones, toys, TVs 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The trade deficit jumped to the second-highest level in his­tory as surging demand for foreign oil swamped a small gain in U.S. exports, the government reported Thursday. America's trade gap with China hit an all­time high as retailers stocked up on cell phones, toys and televisions in preparation for Christmas sales. 
The worse-than-expected trade performance in August -a deficit of $54 billion-represented a 6.9 percent widening from July's trade gap of $50.5 billion. The record monthly deficit was set in June at $55 billion. 
Exports, helped by a rise in shipments of commer­cial aircraft and record foreign sales of American cars and auto parts, rose by a slight 0.1 percent to $96 billion in August. 
However, this improve­ment was overwhelmed by a 2.5 percent surge in imports to a record $150.1 billion as America's foreign oil bill climbed to the high­est level in history. The average price for crude oil jumped to a 23-year high of $36.37 per barrel.

Associated Press 
PHNOM PENH ~ Retiring King Norodom Sihanouk's son. a former ballet dancer and U.N. cultural ambassa­dor, was of!icially confirmed Thursday to succeed his father on the throne, assuring the continuation of the ancient monarchy. 
Prince Norodom Sihamoni, who has spent much of his life abroad. was unanimously approved by a nine-member Throne Council. said a state­ment signed by the panel's chairman, Chca Sim, who is also the country's acting head of state. 
The meeting was triggered by the 81-year-old Sihanouk's surprise abdi­cation last ried, has long been consid­erect the choice of his mother, Queen Monineath. 

The other possibility had been Prince Ranariddh, who served as his father's political proxy for more than two decades, as head of the royal­ist party and a former prime minister. But Ranariddh had said repeatedly he was not interested in being king. 
Born in 1953, Sihamoni went to school in Prague, Czechoslovakia. at age 9, graduating in 1975 from the Academy of Musical Art. Later. he studied film-making in North Korea, according to his official biography. 
From early 1976 until January 1978, he was a pris­oner of the Khmer Rouge.

Sihamoni, 51. is with Sihanouk in Beijing, where the monarch has been receiv­ing medical treatment. They are expected to return to Cambodia next Wednesday, and a coronation ceremony is planned for Oct. 29, said Sihamoni's half-brother Hanariddh, who is head of the National Assembly. 
Sihanouk once said Sihamoni "would probably decline that royal job which he finds frightening." But after abdicating, the king made clear that it was his son's royal duty to accept the crown if offered. 
No one expects Sihamoni to dominate the country like his father. whose reign was marked by deep falls from grace and astonishing come­backs. most notably his ill­fated alliance with the com­munist Khmer Rouge, respon­sible for the deaths of 1. 7 mil­lion Cambodians. 
But having Sihamoni appointed to the throne helps Sihanouk ensure the survival of a monarchy that stretches back to the 13th-century splendor of the Angkor empire and whose future had been questionable in the face of a government dominated by former communists. 
"With Sihamoni in place ... the monarchy is preserved, but only as a shadow of what it once was in the 1950s and 60s." said Milton Osborne. one of Sihanouk's biogra­phers. 
Sihamoni. who never mar-number of malaria deaths is ris­
ing. We need some new tools." 
The vaccine, which 
GlaxoSmithKline Bio has been 
developing for 20 years, was 
tested in 2,022 children aged 1 
to 4 in Mozambique, where the 
mosquito-borne disease is 
endemic. 
After the children were treat­
ed with malaria drugs to get rid 
of any traces of the parasite, 
half got three shots of the 
malaria vaccine in three con­
secutive months, while the 
other half got other childhood 
vaccines. 
The children were followed up for about six months and blood was taken every few weeks to check for malaria. Any Q{:,\Yh cases wBre immediately treated. 
The researchers, led by Dr. Pedro Alonso at the University of Barcelona, found infection in 30 percent fewer children in the vaccine group than in the com­parison group. The vaccine also reduced the risk of getting sick by 30 percent, the risk of get­ting repeated attacks by 30 per­cent, and cut by 58 percent the chance of developing severe malaria. 
Within the comparison group, four children died of severe malaria, while none of the chil­dren who got the vaccine died of malaria. 
The vaccine was most impres­sive in children under 2, in whom the disease is most dan­gerous. The vaccine reduced the number of severe malaria episodes in that age group by 77 percent. 

Malaria is caused by the para­site Plasmodium falciparum, which is carried by mosquitoes. When the parasite is injected into the human body it is in a form that can only infect the liver. where it transforms and multiplies. After about a week, 10,000 daughter parasites leave the liver, now in a form that can infect red blood cells. 
When one parasite invades a red blood cell, 10 pop out and in 

doing so, rip open the cell, 
killing it. 

The vaccine. which targets 
the parasite before it invades 
red blood cells, is made using 
an antigen, a piece of a protein 
that sits on the surface of the 
parasite and can be recognized 
by the immune system. When 
the vaccine is injected, the 
immune system kicks into 
attack mode and makes anti­
bodies. 

When a mosquito later injects 
the parasite, the immune sys­
tem recognizes it. 

The antibodies stick to the 
surface of the parasite. hoping 
to stop it getting into the liver. If 
that doesn't work, the immune 
cells find the parasite in the 
liver and kill it there. And if that 
fails. scientists believe the 
immune cells reduce the multi­
plication of the parasite and 
block some of the more virulent 
daughters from getting out. 

"Fewer parasites coming out of the liver and a possible filter­ing effect of preventing the viru­lent parasites from exiting, is one possible explanation for why we see less severe dis­ease," said the vaccine's co-cre­ator, Ripley Ballou of GSK Bio. 
Further studies still have to be done to see that the vaccine works in children elsewhere in Africa and to verify that it will not interfere with other immu­nizations. 
"It's quite obvious that there is going to be no single way of protecting against malaria. You won't do it just with drugs, you won't do it just with a vaccine or just with bed nets..Y<;J.u.'ye really got to put these together," said Geoff Targett. a malaria researcher at thP London School of llygiene and Tropical Medicine who was not involved with the study. 
"We may have to think about living with the parasite. b'ut in a way where death and severe disease are very rare events. That's probably the way we 'II end up," he said. 
childhood shots can prevent nearly one-third of cases and slash the risk of severe, life­threatening attacks by almost two-thirds. 
Experts say the findings, out­lined this week in The Lancet medical journal, provide robust evidence that the dream of developing a vaccine that will get babies through the most vul­nerable period of infancy could become a reality by the end of the decade. 
Researchers have been work­ing on a malaria vaccine for more than 20 years. but until now none of the candidates showed promise. If this research bears fruit, it would be the first human vaccine against a parasite. 
Specialists agree that, at least for the foreseeable future, there is no prospect of a vaccine that would wipe out malaria like the smallpox vaccine did for small­
home, only to be detained at the royal palace. 
"During that time, we saw no one," Sihamoni said in a rare interview in 1995 with the Phnom Penh Post. "For food. we grew vegetables and fruit in the garden of the palace. Twice a week, Khmer Houge guards came to the back door and gave us rice and fish. We cooked every­thing ourselves ... We wore 
black clothes given to us by the Khmer Rouge. We washed everything ourselves." 
"This period was a very unhappy one, especially for our morale. My father's morale was low," Sihamoni said. "I got on with things. I am very physical, being a dancer, so I worked in the gardens. I cleaned out the throne hall." 
After a Vietnamese invasion Saharan Africa. 
"We think a vaccine is impor­tant because as quick as you can make new drugs, there's resistance and [delivery of] bed nets has not been as simple as one would have hoped," said Melinda Moree, director of the Malaria Vaccine Initiative, which backed the latest study. "We've been trying to apply our existing technologies and the

As Sihanouk rallied a coali­tion of guerrilla groups to oust the Vietnamese-installed government, Sihamoni went to Paris, where many Cambodian refugees had set­tled. He taught and per­formed ballet and classical Khmer dance. 
In 1992, he briefly served as Cambodia's envoy at the United Nations after Sihanouk's guerrillas reached a peace agreement with the government in Phnom Penh. The accord led to elections and Sihanouk's restoration as king in 1993. 
From then until this year, Sihamoni served as ambassa­dor to UNESCO, promoting Cambodian culture while working on the issue of stolen artifacts.

CAMPAIGN NEWS 
Cheneys object to Kerry's remarks 
on lesbian daughter Mary 
WASHINGTON -Dick Cheney and his wife say they are angry at John Kerry for invok­ing their lesbian daughter during the final presidential debate. Kerry says he was just trying to say something nice about how the · Cheneys have dealt with the issue and meant no offense. 
Temperatures have risen sharply since the vice presidential debate, just last week, when Democrat Sen.· John Edwards mentioned Mary Cheney and the Republican vice presi­dent thanked him for his "kind words." 
This time, a back-and-forth ensued that had the vice president's wife, Lynne Cheney, . accusing Sen. Kerry of a "cheap and tawdry political trick" and Elizabeth Ed«rards, wife of Kerry's running mate, suggesting Mrs. Cheney was ashamed of her daughter. 
Debating President Bush Wednesday night, Kerry referred to Mary Cheney when asked whether homosexuality is a choice. 
"We're all God's children," he said. "And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter. who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was. She's being who she was born as. I think if you talk to anybody, it's not a choice." 
Bush said he didn't know if it was a choice or not. But no one was talking about that on Thursday. 
Kerry's defenders said he was well within bounds, particularly given that Cheney has also talked about his daughter when dis­cussing gay issues. 


JudJ;!e rules Ohio voters can cast 
balrots at wrong polling place 
TOLEDO, Ohio -In a victory for the Democrats, a federal judge ruled Thursday that Ohio voters who show up at the wrong polling place on Election Day can still cast ballots as long as they are in the county where they are registered. 
U.S. District Judge James Carr blocked a directive from Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell, a Republican, who recently announced that poll workers must send voters to their correct precinct. 
The judge said voters who show up at the wrong polling place after moving without notifying the elections board, and those whose names cannot be found on the regis­tration rolls, should be able to cast provision­al ballots there. 
Denying any voter the right to a provisional vote will erode confidence in the election and lessen the incentive to vote, the judge said. 
FCC will allow anti-Kerry film 
WASHINGTON The Federal Communications Commission won't inter­vene to stop a broadcast company's plans to air a critical documentary about John Kerry's anti-Vietnam War activities on dozens of TV stations, the agency's chairman said Thursday. 
"Don't look to us to block the airing of a program," Michael Powell told reporters. "I don't know of any precedent in which the commission could do that." 
Eighteen senators, all Democrats, wrote to Powell this week and asked him to investi­gate Sinclair Broadcast Group's plan to run the program, "Stolen Honor: Wounds That Never Heal." two weeks before the Nov. 2 election. 

Candidates enter final weeks 
Bush assails Kerry's liberal record; Kerry says Bush fights only for elite

Associated Press 
LAS VEGAS -President Bush criticized Sen. John Kerry as a liberal trying to hide from his own record Thursday as the two men entered the last, post-debate lap of a close race for the White House. The Democratic challenger said his rival "fights, literally, for the privileged few." 
"I believe we need a presi­dent who will fight for the great middle class and for those who are struggling to join it," Kerry added. 
The ubiquitous polls made the race a statistical tie as Bush and his Democratic rival plunged into the final18 days of campaigning. That marked an improvement in Kerry's national standing over the course of three pres­idential debates -even though Democratic officials confirmed West VIrginia and its five electoral votes have been written off as lost. 
And there were veiled hints of concern within the Bush high command as the campaign entered what the president called a "sprint to the finish." Marc Racicot, campaign chairman, told reporters· the Democratic challenger had helped him­self during the face-to-face encounters: "I think it was temporary," Racicot said. 
Democrats and their allies tried to deflect criticism over Kerry's debate-night refer­ence to Vice President Dick Cheney's gay daughter, Mary. "A cheap and tawdry politi­cal trick," Mary's mother, Lynne Cheney, said of the remark. 
Kerry and Bush both cam­paigned in Nevada during the day, a state with five elec­toral votes and one of rough­ly a dozen still competitive in the final days of the race. 
The four-term Massachusetts senator unleashed an attack on the Medicare legislation that Bush signed into law last year, saying it was "full of empty promises and special interest giveaways." 
Kerry also faulted the pre­scription drug card benefit that took effect this year, a transition to a full overhaul of the Medicare program that he said does little to lower the cost of drugs. 
"The truth is that after doing nothing to really lower the cost of prescription drugs for you, the president is now telling you that he solved the problem. Right. And those weapons of mass destruction are going to be found any day now," he said with sar­casm. 

Bush's after-debate mes­sage was simple -Kerry is a liberal who will raise taxes, increase government spend­ing, stick with the status quo on Social Security, and give other countries too much say in the use of U.S. troops over­seas. 
"My opponent wants to move in the direction of gov­ernment-run health care," the president added. "I believe health decisions ought to be made by doctors and patients, not officials in Washington, D.C." 
Attempting to pin the liber­al label on Kerry, he added, "Now he dismisses. that as a label. Must have seen it dif­ferently when he said to a newspaper, 'I'm a liberal and proud of it."' 
Apart from the public rhet­oric, the two sides readied their campaign endgame strategies. 
For Bush, according to White House officials, that will mean stepping up his effort to portray Kerry as a flip-flapper, a liberal with few accomplishments in the Senate. At the same time, officials said the president will play to one of his cam­paign strengths -his wartime leadership. He intends to travel to New Jersey next week to deliver what aides call a major address on terrorism. 
The state hasn't voted for a Republican since the presi­dential election in 1988, but New Jersey is just across the river from New York City and it suffered a significant loss of life when terrorists struck the W.orld Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. 
Kerry, having performed well in the debates, hopes to use the fmal 2 112 weeks of the campaign to persuade voters that he is a safe replacement for Bush in an era of terrorism. The effort will include a series of speeches designed to cast the senator as the champion of the middle class -as he said during the day -and depict Bush as the defender of the elite. 
Final figures showed that 51 million Americans watched at least part of the final presidential debate. 
While the candidates were ready to move on, one con­troversy simmered. Both Cheney and his wife criti­cized Kerry for havin-g referred to Mary Cheney's sexuality during the debate. 
"You saw a man who will do and say anything to get elected," the vice president said in Fort Myers, Fla. "And I am not just speaking as a father here, although I am a pretty angry father."

John Kerry supporter looked over at the Bush supporter and saluted. The President George W. Bush supporter wiggled his fin­gers as though to say, "Hello." The con­trast epitomized the reversed universe of this year's electorate. 
This column will be the last published before the election between Bush and Kerry. As Americans decide the outcome of the final debate, my crystal ball has sharpened its electoral images. Voters are processing how to reconcile a slump on the home front with a strong defense while equating how Iraq figures into their voting equations. 
Voter registrations have soared through­out the nation which highlights the impor­tance Americans are placing on the elec­tion and the future direction our next president will take us. Some constituen­cies are splitting from routine election pat­terns based on war, election spin or reli­gious views. Yet one trend that is pointing to the outcome of November's results is the slow, steady rise of John Kerry in the polls while the president stagnates in the mid to upper 40 percent ranges. 
John Kerry is viewed as having per­formed better in each of the three presi­dential debates. Americans contrasted the unfiltered remarks of both candidates dur­ing the three debates. After the first debate. Kerry was viewed as having won by 16 percent immediately after the debate. Within a week. voters viewed Kerry the winner by 38 percent. While the second debate was a slight win for Kerry, the Senator won the third debate by 13 percent immediately after the event. 
The debates this year served as a springboard for Kerry like the one and only debate in 1980 catapulted Ronald Heagan past then-President Jimm:Y Carter. A mere week before the election of 1980. Carter led Reagan by three percentage points until they met in the

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Do unto others 
In response to Andrew Yi's "Abortion is a Human Right" letter, I wish to open my article with a quote from Ayn Rand: 
"If I ask people whether they believe in life. they never understand what I mean. It's a bad question. It can mean so much that it really means nothing. So I ask them if they believe in God. And if they say they do, then I know they don't believe in life. Why? Because, you see, God­whatever anyone chooses to call God -is one's highest conception of the highest possible. And whoever places his highest conception above his own possibility thinks M very little of himself and his life. It's a rare gift, you know, to feel reverence for your own life and to want the best. the greatest, the highest possi­ble. here, now. for your very own." · 
I do not question Yi's claim that. as a pro-choice Catholic, his integrity and character have been repeat­edly attacked. It certainly isn't a compliment to describe the Catholic Church as having a pervasive undercurrent of anti­intellectualism. Ending one's article with a quote from Ayn ltand. whose claim to fame, among other things. is her vehement con­demnation of religion as being con­trary to reason only reinforces this impression that Yi carries a deep grudge against the Catholic Church. In fact. the down­right hostile rhetoric of his article seems profoundly anti-religion in nature; I am not surprised that his integrity and his faith in Catholicism would be ques­tioned by others. 

Is this to say that there is something wrong about not being Cathol.ic? Certainly not. But the language Yi uses when he describes anti-abortionists as a sexist, misogy­nic bunch of bigots is harsh. Why then should he expect the inevitable response to be calm and reserved? When a person is called a bigot, a misogynist, a sexist (pig), it is an all-too-human reaction to respond with ad homo­nym of one's own. Perhaps that is why Yi's integrity and character have been repeatedly attacked. After all, he who casts the first stone has no right and no moral 
superiority when those he attacks fling his insults right back at him. Lest there be the inevitable responses calling me a fool for missing the main topic of Yi's article -abortion -I shall examine it in some detail, even though I feel that it would be repeating the same, tired old spiel to an audience that is not listening. Yi's argument seems to indicate that he believes 
that the right of a woman to control her own body takes precedence over the life of 
the fetus. Very well. When then does the fetus gain the same rights of a human being as the mother? At birth? But such a claim is nonsensical -one minute 
before birth, one hour before 
birth, one day before birth ­how much difference is there in between? To arbitrarily des­
ignate time x as that point in time when a fetus magically becomes a baby is about as logical­ly coherent as believing that 
Pinocchio's Fairy Godmother trans­forms him from a puppet into a little boy. In closing, I suggest Yi consult a dictionary 

before he bandies big words about. I am not a bigot. I do not hate women. I do not consider women somehow inferior to men. I am none of these things, but I do condemn abortion.

Defining 'lifestyle' 
I want to congratulate Cody Graeber (Letter to the Editor on Oct. 14) on identifying the key mis­conception in the debate concerning acceptance of gay and lesbian students on this campus. Indeed, we need to make a distinction between "the person and the act" and accept that one's "identity is bound up in much more than [one's] sexuality." However, I am,afraid that Groeber ascribes this misconception to a wrong party in the discussion. 
It is not the "gay activists" who tend to equal human beings and sexual activity over and over again. It is the people who claim that we cannot fight discriminatory atmosphere because it is hard to distinguish between a person and his or her "homosexual lifestyle." 
What is a "homosexual lifestyle?" Are we talk­ing about the passion of gay men for hamburgers, or about the inclination of lesbian couples to enjoy road trips during their vacation? No, the "homosexual lifestyle" is a reference to sexual intercourse between two people of same sex. Isn't this an attempt to equal a person with his or her sexuality? Would it not be more appropriate to accept gays and lesbians as human beings need­ing "to love and be loved" (a desire that everyone seems to agree on) and leave their private deci­sions about their sex life out of the arena of pub­lic scrutiny? 
Do we discriminate against unmarried hetero­sexual couples because it is possible that in their private lives. they are breaking the rules of Catholic teachings? That would be absurd. would­n't it? So why is it normal to do the same thing when it comes to gay men and lesbians?

Muslim vote not considered 
During Friday's debate, the issue of judicial appointees was discussed among the candidates. Jonathan Michaelson asked President George 
W. Bush how he would fill anticipated vacancies in the Supreme Court if re­Hassan Khaja elected. In his rebut­tal to the president's Rutgers answer, Sen. John University Kerry said he would Daily Targum apply the late Justice Potter Stewart's standard: one who reads the opinion ol' a judge fit for the Supreme Court should not know whether or not the judge is "a Mus1im, a Jew or a Christian." 
To understand the significance of Kerry's use of the dreaded "M" word, one need only look to the Muslim vote and its role in this election. No one thinks. anytime soon, a Muslim will be nominated to the Supreme Court, but this marks the first public considera­tion either of the candidates has gjven to Muslim voters. 
American Muslims deserve special consideration because they find them­selves in a unique position in the United States. Two fears have been joined upon the American Muslim. 
One of those fears ,is the very real fear of a terrorist strike. The fact that one Df the airplanes on Sept. 11 was downed in Shanksville, Pa. -a short distance away from a school-shows us just how real. unpredictable and inescapable a terrorist attack is. 
However, there is a fear that has been visited on American Muslims in addition to the fear of being victims of terrorism -being labeled the prime suspects. Evidence of the air of suspi­cion Muslims face is the demand placed on them by non-Muslims to condemn terrorism. Naturally, it is assumed if they don't condemn it, which is unlikely, they supportit. At the same time. if they don't rush to pub­licly condemn ter'­ror on the air­waves. they feel they will be placed under the same suspicion. 

This fear is only exacerbated by abuse of the terror alert level on the part of the Bush administra­tion. Certainly, if law enforcement needs to be on guard, then it does them good to know there is addi­tional chatter that intelli­gence agencies are picking up on. But, the prevailing logic holds that alerts fall on deaf ears when they are too frequently relayed to the pub­
lic. Law enforcement officials are trained to take every alert seriously and to be ever vigilant. The layper­son, on the other hand, is not. 
But there is an alternate, unintend­
ed consequence to the abuse of alerts -creation of an atmosphere of fear. Law enforcement officials, in this sit­uation, are supposed to be and are expected to be properly trained to 
handle all threats. Once again. the layperson is not. In an atmosphere of fear. to said layperson, every­one becomes a sus­pect: Considering Islam is the com­mon thread among 
the more popular terrorists, the inevitable conse­
quence is the singling-out of Muslims. Excluding the more ignoran·t racial and ethnic 
profilers, law enforcement is usually keen to the science of criminal profiling. It's been understood 
among American Muslims that. in an envi­ronment of fear. they must 
watch what they say. The Constitution guarantees free speech, but common sense guarantees, in a time of fear, hysteria prevails over the law. 
With Tariq Ramadan and Yusuf Islam, widely considered moderates, being denied entry into the United States, the prevailing logic was shat­

tered. 
While there certainly might be peo­ple who -either out of a genuine effort to understand Muslims or out of a concern for political correctness ­won't vocalize hatred or suspicion of Muslims. their survival instinct might not have set in yet. If impulse is left to rule, as sometimes it will, who is to say that impuls.e will not cause suspi­cion of Muslims. who have long been understood in American culture as the new enemies? When backed into a wall, wouldn't impulse force desper­ate action? 
In light of this, the candidate who wins the Muslim vote will be the one who does the most to quell the atmos­phere of fear. In this regard. the choice will probably be overwhelm­ingly for Kerry, considering Bush cre­ated the atmosphere of fear and third-party candidates are considered unlikely to win. 
There's still a segment of Muslims, however, who support Bush. In fact, if Bush makes a sincere effort to reach out to Muslims who -like all humans in a state of fear -might act against common sense. ignore the past years of fear and vote overwhelmingly to re­elect Bush.

Adding to the talented lineup will be Nick Curran, who won the 2004 WC Handy Award for Best New Artist Debut. The young guitarist and vocalist incorporates R&B into his rock and blues music, interpreting classic songs as well as crafting his own. His albums "Doctor Velvet" and "Player!" have earned him national and international critical acclaim. The musicians will be playing for 

more than the audi­ence, in a way, as all proceeds will benefit the Center for the Homeless. The Center has had strong ties to the Notre Dame com­munity since its incep­tion. Founders Dave Link, former dean of the law school. and D'Arcy Chisholm approached University President Father Edward Malloy for help when they needed more funds to refurbish an 
abandoned men's department store. 
Malloy went to the Board of Trustees 
and asked for a $1 million to purchase and rehabilitate the building to begin ·the center-a brave move, since he was early in his tenure as president at the 
time. 
"It has a full continuum of services 
for individuals and families to help 
break the cycle of homelessness, of 
addiction, of dependency," Lou Nanni, 
vice president for University Relations 
and former executive director of the 
center, said. 

An example of services for children is the occupational therapy program that works with newborns. The center has the only full time Montessori program in a homeless center, and works with children ages 3 to 5 before kinder­garten. It also works with the South Bend school system to help children once they begin school. attending to details like making sure they are picked up on the bus first and dropped off last so it is not obvious that they are homeless. 
"For adults, there are emergency assistance, crisis management, life skills. job training and home ownership programs, and all services are located 
at the center," Nanni 
said.

Raiders must stop the run against AFC rival Broncos 

Oakland has allowed a league-worst 156.9 yards per game 
Associated Press 
OAKLAND. Calif. -The Haiders realize another bad day by their run defense won't cut it against the Denver Broncos. 
One of Oakland's top priori­tins in the offseason was to upgrade a unit that allowed a league-worst 156.9 yards per game on the ground. 
So far. it's been a work-in­progress mastering defensive coordinator Hob Hyan 's new 3­4 scheme. 
The next test will come Sunday. when the Raiders host their AFC West rivals in Oakland's first game against a divisionaf opponent. 
"There's no question, in our division we're going to have to stop the run to play," coach Norv Turner said. "We know the things we have to handle with Denver. We have to stop the run. Certainly they're very mobile at quarterback and do a lot of things with misdirection, bootlegs. reverses, fake revers­es. those types of things. We're going to have to have a plan to handle that." 
It will be tough. because the Broncos always seem to get a big performance from one of their backs. 
Denver coach Mike Shanahan doesn't have a simple answer as to how he's been able to get so much out of his running 
backsyearafieryea~ 
Heuben Droughns went off for 193 yards -the ninth­highest one-game total in Denver's regular-season history -in a 20-17 win over Carolina last Sunday. This week, it could be someone else to emerge. 
"It's a combination of every­body," Shanahan said. "To get close to a couple hundred yards, you've got to have every­body play good." 
The Haiders gave up 312 yards rushing over the last two wm~ks. including a career-high I05 yards by llouston 's .Jonathan Wells. then 136 to Edgerrin James in a 35-14 loss to the Colts last week for Oakland's 12th straight road defeat. 
Denver (4-1) has already run for 656 yards. and the Broncos also have Tatum Bell and Garrison Hearst healthy and ready as options this week. 
"It doesn't matter [who]. They just do what they do best," Haiders defensive end Bobby Hamilton said. "We know up front we've got to play ball this week." 
They've got to be smart, too. 
The Haiders (2-3) have already been penalized 48 times for 335 yards, and they aren't taking care of the ball well. either. Oakland has lost five of its 10 fumbles and thrown nine interceptions, seven by Kerry Collins in the past 2 1/2 games. 
In two games against the Hroncos last season. Oakland

-
committed 13 penalties for 98 yards. 
The Haiders were flagged 11 times for 89 yards in a 22-8 loss to Denver at home last Nov. 30. prompting former coach Bill Callahan to call the Haiders "the dumbest team in America." 

team's one-year tender of $8.782 million Aug. 31. 
"I mean, why wouldn't he think that?" Bailey said. "He's had a great career so far. He's got every right to think that. Of course, I think that about myself. And if you want to get that top-paid corner spot, you definitely have to feel like it. or promote yourself like you are, and play like it. I feel like I'm worth what I'm making. and that's good enough for me." 
Turner .is sticking with Collins at uarterback des ite his struggles. The coach faced questions this week about giv­ing backup Marques Tuiasosopo an opportunity. 
"Each week I fen! more and more comfortable with what we're doing," Collins said. "''ve just got to make some bettnr decisions, and I will. Lih I said, each week that I'm out here I'm really concentrating hard in practice and getting to the point where I feel comfort­able going into games. I know it's going to get better for all us." 


"We just have to be sound in the things we're doing," Turner said. 
The Broncos acquired Pro Bowl cornerback Champ Bailey in an offseason trade with Washington, signing him to a seven-year, $63 million con­tract to be their shutdown cor­nerback. 
That should make for a chal­lengin'g day for the Haiders' young receiving corps, which seems to feature a new face in the primary role every week. 
Turner coached Bail for 

two seasons with the Hedskins. The coach said both Bailey and four-time Pro Bowler Charles Woodson of the Raiders are great athletes. but with differ­ent styles. 
They both .like their money, though. 
Woodson, the Haiders' fran­chise player in his seventh pro season. has said he wants to be the highest-paid cornerback in the league. 
He held out for four months hoping for a long-term con­tract, but finall si ned the

Park holds a tw-o-stroke lead in Sainsung Chainpionship 

Her score was the lowest in tourney's 24-year history 
Associated Press 
PALM DESERT. Calif. ­Grace Park capped an almost flawless round by rolling in a 25-foot birdie putt for a 10­under 62 Thursday that gave her a two-stroke lead after the first round of the Samsung World Championship. 
Park. looking frustrated moments earlier when her wedge shot missed the 18th grePn, beamed and waved to acknowledge the applause after her snaking, perfectly paced putt from the fringe dropped into the cup. 
Scores were low on the open­ing day of the tournament, with Park's the best in the tournament's 24-year history. The event is being played for the first time at Bighorn Golf 

Club, the 13th course used for the tournament. Sixteen of the 20 players in the field broke par. 
Catriona Matthew had a 64, while three-time champion Annika Sorenstam was tied at 66 with defending champion Sophie Gustafson. Lor,ena Ochoa and Cristie Kerr. 
Amateur Michelle Wie, who turned 15 on Monday, played with Sorenstam and shot a 74. She had a triple-bogey 8 on No. 12 when she hit into the desert shrubs along the fairway. 
Park was still beaming 20 minutes after she finished her round, which included one bogey, an eagle and nine birdies. 
''!' m extremely thrilled. It's my first time shooting 10 under, so I'm happy. Today was just an unbelievable day," said Park, who had a 61 earlier this year on a par-70 course in the tournament in Tucson, Ariz. 
Park won her first major title, the Kraft Nabisco, earlier 
this year in nearby Rancho Mirage. ''I'm a desert kind of girl, I guess," she said, laughing. 
She made an 18-foot birdie putt on No. 2. made two more birdies with a 15-footer on 4 and a 10-footer on 5 before three-putting the par-3 6th for the bogey. 
She had six more birdies and made a 2-foot eagle putt on No. 12. 
Then she finished the round off in style. 
"I had a horrible second shot [to the fringe on 18] and I was thinking I could two-putt. I would have been happy to fin­ish 9 under," Park said. "But I got a big bonus there." 
Wie lamented her bad drive on 12. 
"One swing. I was hitting the ball fine until that one shot," she said. 
Wie said she was trying to stay focused on her game, but that she also was watching Sorenstam. 


NFL 



Colts spend bye week trying to diversify offense 

Indy leads the AFC in yards and the NFL in points scored 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -By almost 
any measure the Indianapolis 
Colts have the AFC's most dan­
gerous offense. 
They lead the conference in 
yards and the NFL in points. 
They have the AFC's top-rated 
quarterback, the conference's 
No. 2 runner and three receivers ·ranked among the top 11 in receptions. Peyton Manning still believes they're improving. 
"We'd love to have no 
turnovers. but we want to kind of 
build on what we've started," 
said Manning, last year's co-MVP. 
Indianapolis ( 4-1) has spent 
the bye week refining some of 
the few kinks Manning has diag­
nosed before Jacksonville (3-2) 
visits next week in a game that 
could give the Colts a substantial 
edge in the AFC South race. The 
Colts already hold a one-game 
lead on Jacksonville and have 

beaten Tennessee and the 
Jaguars on the road. 

Five games into the season, the 
question is how much better can 
the offense can be? 

Edgerrin James has looked less 
like a man coming. bad from a""torn anterior "cfudaw"tigament and more like the runner who captured NFL rushing titles in 
1999 and 2000. 

Brandon Stokley and Reggie 
Wayne have become two of 
Manning's top targets. and 
although Marvin Harrison hasn't 
been getting as many balls 
thrown in his direction, he's still 
catching enough to top 90 recep­
tions at this pace. 

Stokley's 25 catches already 
are a career high and all three 
receivers are on pace to top 
1,000 yards. 

Around the locker room, 
nobody is complaining. · 

"As a whole, I think we're 
doing extremely well," Harrison 
said. ''I'm happy to be in the situ­
ation we're in." 

On the field, the Colts might be 
tougher than advertised. 

When opponents double-team 
Harrison, Manning has routinely 
hooked up with Wayne and 
Stokley for big plays. When defenses play man-to-man cover­age, Manning has been content handing off to James. 
The result is the Colts have scored no fewer than 24 points in a game. have topped the 30­point mark twice and 40 once. 
For coach Tony Dungy, who came to Indianapolis three years ago with a reputation for creat­ing stout defenses, this is the offense he's always envisioned. 
"We've been able to play all types of games and we're playing with patience," he said. "Even though we're playing with more patience, we're scoring more points. This is probably the best we've played [on offense] since I've been here." 
But there are a few areas Manning, a perfectionist, believes could use work. 
He entered the season with a goal of completing 70 percent of his passes. He's at 66.2 percent. The Colts have scored 15 touch­downs and two field goals on 20 trips inside the red zone, and Manning thinks they can become more proficient. 
The Colts have converted a conference-high 49.0 percent of third-down conversions. a num­ber Manning hopes to increase. 
And although nine of 16 AFC teams have committed more 
· turnovers than the Colts (six). Manning and the offense believe reducing that number will increase their overall output. "The key is not to say how many points or yards you have, the most important thing is how many times you turn the ball over." Harrison said. "I think that's the league's mind-set and that's Tony's philosophy." The warning for opponents is that the Colts are only getting started. Tight end Marcus Pollard has been slowed by a bruised left 
-
knee and tight end Dallas Clark has just two catches. Running back Dominic Rhodes has just started to emerge as another dangerous runner. and wide receiver Troy Walters hasn't played since breaking his right arm in the second preseason game.

AP Cardinals' Albert Pujols points to the dugout after breaking a 4-4 tie in the eighth inning of Game 2 last night. With the win, the Cardinals took a 2-0 series lead. 
Cardinals rain on Astros' early hit parade 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS -Rain or shine, the St. Louis Cardinals' big bats always seem to come through in the end. 
Albert Pujols led off the eighth inning with a tiebreaking home run, Scott Rolen followed with his second homer of the game and the Cardinals stormed back to beat Houston 6-4 on a miserable Thursday night for a 2-0 lead in the NL champi­onship series. 
The weather was awful all evening, with drizzle delaying the start for almost a half-hour and the rain lasting through the final pitch. By the time it was over, with tempera­tures falling into the mid· 40s, no one in the sellout crowd at Busch Stadium was complaining. 
Pujols and Rolen connect­ed for the first consecutive home runs in the Cardinals' long, proud postseason his· tory. Larry Walker also homered, enough to offset yet another shot by Carlos Beltran and a homer by Morgan Ensberg for the Astros. 
Now, the series shifts to Minute Maid Park for Game 3 on Saturday, with Roger Clemens set to start for Houston against Jeff Suppan. If the Rocket can pull the Astros close, then 20-game winner Roy Oswalt will have a chance 

to even it in Game 4. Still, the Cardinals hold a commanding edge. 
Of 61 clubs that have fall­en behind 0-2 in a best-of­seven postseason baseball series, only 12 have come back to win. 
Julian Tavarez got the victory in relief. Jason Isringhausen worked around two walks in the ninth, getting Ensberg on a long fly out to finish for his second save of the NLCS. 
Dan Miceli took the loss as the Astros' bullpen con­tinued to falter. He took over to begin the eighth and gave up home runs to the first two batters he faced. 
Rolen, nursing a strained left calf, was 0-for-14 in the postseason before hitting an RBI single in Game 1. 
He showed no ill effects in Game 2, as he, Rolen and Walker hit two-run homers that put St. Louis ahead 4-3 in the fifth. Rolen was the first batter Chad Harville faced after he relieved journeyman starter Pete Munro. 
Beltran's sixth homer of the postseason helped the Astros to a 3-0 lead off Matt Morris. 
Houston later made it 4­all in the seventh when Lance Berkman doubled. stole third and scored when Ensberg grounded a single past the drawn-in infield. The tying hit off Kiko Calero came against an especially odd backdrop. 

IN BRIEF Woods' yacht detained by
Coast Guard in Puerto Rico 
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -Tiger Woods and his bride were briefly detained Thursday by U.S. Coast Guard officers on their yacht Privacy, then were turned away from San Juan's port because they had failed to notify authorities of their arrival. 
Since July 1. new security regula­tions require many boats to submit an arrival notice at least four days before entering a U.S. port, Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Eric Willis said. 
The 28-year-old golfer and Swedish model Elin Nordegren, 24, were mar­ried Oct. 5 at a luxury resort in Barbados and later set out on the Privacy, along with a crew. 
The yacht entered San Juan's port at about noon Thursday and a Coast Guard boat stopped it, Willis said. Five Coast Guard officers boarded the yacht and escorted it to port, he said. 
"They were not supposed to be here because they didn't notify us," Willis said. 
The captain said he decided to stop in San Juan only to refuel. Willis said. The Privacy was allowed to refuel as immigration authorities spoke with those aboard, including the newly­weds. Davenport regains topworld ranking 
MOSCOW -American Lindsay Davenport regained the No. 1 ranking for the first time since early 2002 by defeating Dinara Safina of Russia 6-4, 6-2 in the second round of the Kremlin Cup on Thursday. 
Davenport officially will overtake France's Amelie Mauresmo next week to move atop the WTA rankings for the fifth time. She trailed Mauresmo by just 15 points, 4,395 to 4,380, after winning the Porsche Grand Prix in Filderstadt, Germany, on Sunday. 
''I'm amazed that I was able to get back to No. 1 after a tough couple of years," said Davenport, who has struggled with assorted injuries since last being at the top on Jan. 13, 2002. She also had brief stays at No. 1 in 1998 1999 and 2000. PGA. rookie Dufner leads 

after one tound at Chrysler 
GREENSBORO, N.C.-Jason Dufner pointed to last week as evidence any­thing can happen on the PGA Tour. He hopes to prove it again. 
Mired in an awful rookie season, Dufner shot a 7-under 65 Thursday to match his best round of the year and take a one-shot lead after the first round of the Chrysler Classic of Greensboro. He has missed the cut in 15 of 26 tournaments, and with only two events left. he's 186th on the money list. 
Only the top 125 are guaranteed a spot for 2005. 
"It's been a tough year," he said. "I haven't played that bad for the year, but it's just not working out. I really need top fives or better to secure my card for next year."

Belles hope to extend their hotne win streak 
By RYAN DUFFY 
Sports Writer 
Like most of the students heading out for fall break. the Belles couldn't be happier to be returning home. 
After an excruciating loss to Kalamazoo on Wednesday off a last-second penalty kick, the Belles will look to rebound Saturday when they take on Alma at home, where Saint Mary's holds a 5-0 record this year. 
"Alma is a strong team, so we'll be looking to bring our best game against them," sen­ior captain Jen Herdman said. "We're going to come out strong, and focus on playing as a team. It should be quite a game." 
The Belles tied Alma 1-1 in their first meeting this year, but will need to finish their opportunities against Kalamazoo if they wish to bring home a victory this time. "The loss to Kalamazoo was tough, and hard on the team; we're a very close team. thought, so we bounce back strong," Herdman said. "We're not going to let it get us down. We're just going to take it one gamP. at a time; we've put it behind us, and we're looking forward to the games we have left to play." 
Although the Belles were close the entire game, the Kalamazoo game still repre­sents an opportunity missed. 
"The loss to Kalamazoo was unfortunate," sophomore Ashley Hinton said. "We had our opportunities to put the ball in the back of the net, and we just weren't able to capital­ize on them." 

Wednesday's adds another chapter to the story of the Belles' woes on the road this year. 
"It was a tough game, and everyone played well, but the ball just didn't fall our way," Herdman said. "Don't get me wrong, Kalamazoo is a good team, but they got a great break to a get a penalty kick in the final 30 seconds. We played strong defense, and it was a 50-50 battle throughout the game, but luck just wasn't with us in the end." 
The Belles will look for a big advantage from the return to their home field. "We seem to be playing better on our home field, so we're really excited to play at home," Hinton said. "We still need to get our act together on the road as well, though." 
Despite the loss to Kalamazoo, which dropped the Belles down to third in the conference standings, Saint Mary's remains optimistic in its hopes for a MIAA title. 
"This conference isn't a typi­cal conference; no team domi­nates, and anything can hap­pen," Herdman said. "The great thing about soccer is, on any given day, any team can beat anyone. If we play the game we're capable of, we can definitely have a shot at con­ference." 
With the season winding down, the Belles will have to play their best soccer to win their conference.

'The Trade' leaves team.s optim.istic 

AP Chargers coach Marty Schottenhelmer gets his message across to defensive backs Quentin Jammer, right, and Jamar Retcher last Sunday. The Char.2'ers defeated the Jaguars 34-21. 
Chargers remain only one game offthe lead in the AFC West 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Three years after The Trade, neither team has any complaints. 
The Atlanta Falcons got Michael Vick, who quickly led them to the playoffs and became an icon for the NFL with his dazzling skills. 
The San Diego Chargers wound up with LaDainian Tomlinson and Drew Brees, along with Reche Caldwell and Tim Dwight. Not too shabby, either. 
"Let bygones be bygones," Vick said. "It worked out for both teams. They have a great running back and a good quar­terback in Drew Brees, who's playing real well right now. And I think the Falcons got what they wanted." 
On Sunday, the teams meet 
'!f..:a 

for the first time since their blockbuster trade. The Falcons (4-1) are trying to bounce back from their first loss of the sea­son, while San Diego (3-2) is just one game off the lead in the AFC West. 
Rest assured, someone involved in that 2001 deal will play a key role. 
''I'd say both teams pros­pered quite well from the trade," Chargers coach Marty Schottenheimer said. 
Atlanta set its sights on Vick after he put in two spectacular seasons at Virginia Tech, then entered the NFL draft. 
The Falcons were set to pick fifth. too far down to get one of the best college players to come along in years. So they called up the Chargers, who had the first overall selection, but were bogged down._trying to agree on a contract with Vick's agent. 
When the Falcons offered an attractive package of three picks and receiver-return spe­cialist Dwight, the Chargers accepted on the eve of the draft. 
The rest, as they say, is his­tory. 
Vick spent one season as a backup, then took over the starting job in 2002. He guided the Falcons to the playoffs, was voted to the Pro Bowl and set an NFL record for quarter­backs by rushing for 173 yards in a game. 
With the picks acquired from the Falcons, the Chargers got Tomlinson, Caldwell and cor­nerback Tay Cody. After pass­ing up Vick, they also used one of their own picks to take Brees, forever linking him to the trade. 
Cody started 11 games before he was cut last year. Everyone else acquired by the Chargers is sti!LG9n.tribu\ing, no one more than Tomlinson. 
He rushed for more than 1,200 yards as a rookie, then topped 1,600 yards each of the last two seasons.

Associated Press 
SIIANGIIAI. China -Yao Ming was the star in the NBA's first China game, scoring 14 points and grabbing seven n~bounds to lead the Houston Hockets past the Sacramento Kings 88-86 Thursday. 
There was a capacity crowd on hand at Shanghai's city gym­nasium to cheer the 7-foot-6 cnnter. whose return has domi­nated headlines in his home­town. The crowd chanted Yao's name repeatedly -even when he wasn't on the court. 
llowever. he missed his first two shots and was shaky defen­sively at the start. 

"I didn't play a great game. I was really nervous in the first half. It was almost like the feel­ing I had playing in my first NBA game," Yao said. "I felt suffocated and I just wanted to find an exit, but I just tried to focus on technical details and then things settled down." 
His first points came on a dunk 7 minutes into the game, and he brought the fans to their feet when he scored on an alley-oop pass from Tracy McGrady in the second quarter. 
Brad Miller led the Kings with 19 points, but the game was clearly a showcase for Yao.

Still, he was gracious to Liu after the game. 
"He played very well and his performance was really up to his usual high standards," Yao said. 
Chris Webber scored 14 points for Sacramento, includ­ing a half-court buzzer beater that gave the Kings a 72-67 lead heading into the fourth quarter. 
McGrady had 12 points, seven rebounds and three assists for Houston. Still, Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy is looking for more out of both McGrady and Yao.

Irish set to compete in invite 
After a two-week respite, golfers take the road for Lady Razorback invite 
By ERIC RETTER 
Sports Writer 
The Irish return to action Sunday after a two week break, playing in the Lady Razorback Invitational in Fayetteville, Arkansas. 
This event, hosted by the University of Arkansas, will run between Sunday and Tuesday. The Irish arc hoping this break will not affect the momentum they have accumulated in recent weeks. The team is coming off of two straight wins against strong competition, dominating at both the Shootout at Legends and the Jeannine McHaney InvitationaVCentral Hegional Preview. 
Despite the potential drawbacks that come with a break from com­petition, head coach Debby King welcomed the break. 
"I think it's good in one respect. because it gives [the team! a chance to take a little breather and catch up on some school work," she said. "It keeps you from getting burned out and keeps you hungry." 

The team will have to rely on that hunger for competition and good play to continue their streak, as they face another challenging field. The Irish will face three teams ranked ahead of them in the 18-team field -Michigan, Missouri and host Arkansas. 
However, because of recent suc­cess. the team's mindset going into events like this is beginning to ished the Shootout at Legends in an 8th place tie. 
Joining her will be sophomore Noriko Nakazaki and senior Karen Lotta. Nakazaki has been a staple in the Irish lineup, and Lotta has performed well for the Irish when she has competed. 
Rounding out the contingent will be junior Sarah Bassett and fresh­man Jane Lee. Lee has already made a considerable impact on the team in her rookie year, and 
change. 

''I'm getting a dif­ferent perspective as a coach," King said. "Normally, I would be happy with a top-5 finish, but t~ you look at the teams ranked ahead of us and we've beaten them already. We think we can go in and win again."

Bassett is competing in her first event after a strong week of qualifying. 
Over the break, the Irish spent lots of time on qualifying, in part to simulate competitive play. They have also worked extensively on the mental aspects of the game as a kind of insur­ance for the upcom­ing competition. 
"We've been prac­ticing with every

Belles face Adrian in season-defining game 
By JUSTIN STETZ 
SportS Writer 

The Belles upcoming match this Sunday. can either make or break their season. 
The Belles will travel to Michigan to take on confer­ence rival Adrian College who is currently 5-6 in the league. The Bulldogs are currently in fourth place in the MIAA, while the Belles stand in seventh with a 5-7 record. 
However, only one game separates fourth to seventh place in the division and with the season coming to an end, the Belles are hop­ing to take advantage. 
The Bulldogs defeated the Belles in their match-up earlier this season. Saint Mary's defeated Adrian in the first game, only to lose the following three consec­utive games. During the contest, Elise Rupright had one of her best games this year as she registered 14 kills on offense. Michelle Gary and Amanda David gave the Bulldog's offense headaches as both collected 17 digs apiece in the match. 
Rupright has consistently contributed to Saint Mary's this season. The senior cap­tain has totaled 101 kills on offense and is among the team leaders in attack per­centage. She has also played a valuable role on defense with 40 blocks. 
One positive factor for the Belles is Adrian's recent slump. Over the course of their last 10 games. the Bulldogs have only won three games and are 1-5 against conference oppo­nents. Fortunately for Saint Mary's, the Belles have improved since the first meeting by going 4-2 against MIAA teams. 
This game will be the fourth away game in a row for the Belles in the past two weeks. They have gone 1-2 in the first three games, but have played consistent­ly against strong opponents in the losses. 


WOMEN'S TENNIS 



Thompsons live their dreams at ITA Championships 
Twins became the first Irish team ever 
to reach the finals of a grand slam event 
By ANN LOUGHERY 
Sporrs Writer 
Make no mistake -sopho­mores Catrina and Christian Thompson are doers, not dream­ers. 
While doubles teams across the country aspire to compete in championship tournaments, the No. 7 Thompsons are living their dreams. 


The twins recently enjoyed their share of success at the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Women's All-American Championships last weekend. The duo was the first Irish team ever to reach the doubles fmal of a grand slam event. 
En route to the finals, the Thompsons upset the No. 6, No. 1 and No. 11 teams. Although they fell just short of a grand slam championship title, the twins secured a place in the National Intercollegiate Indoor Doubles Championships Nov. 4 and 5. 
"It was really dissapointing los­ing," Catrina Thompson said. "It bugged me all week. But we know we'll have another opportu­nity to win and prove ourselves." 
In the days leading up to the fmals, the pair proved that with a little confidence, there isn't any­

-
one they can't beat-including the country's top ranked team. 
University of Alabama's No. 6 Ashley Bentley and Robin Stephenson -who are ranked Nos. 49 and 16 in singles, respec­tively -were the frrst challenge for the Thompsons. After the twins trailed 4-3, Christian Thompson spearheaded the team's comeback, not missing a first serve in six attempts to even the score and jumpstart a scoring run. Bentley and Stephenson, who were undefeated this season, fell 8-4 to the twins. 

The next day, the Thompsons overpowered University of Arizona's No. 1 Dianne Hollands and Maja Mlakar in a tight 8-6 victory. After trailing 5-3, Hollands and Mlakar refused to surrender a win, tying the score at 6-6. However, their efforts proved to be futile as the Irish ral­lied and secured the victory as they broke Arizona's serve. 
Coach Jay Louderback attrib­utes the twins' complimentary playing style for their upset against Arizona. 
"Catrina has really improved her serve and hits the ball with a lot of speed and pace. She's becoming a weapon for the team," Louderback said. "And Christian has been a really con­sistent player. She's getting better at finishing off the point instead of keeping the ball in volley." 
Showcasing their strengths against University of New Mexico's No. 11 Maja Kovacek and Iva Gersic, the Thompsons collected their third win of the tournament 9-8 (7-5) in a closely contested match. 
"Every point was a great point," Louderback said. It was fun to see them play some of the top players in the country. They look forward to playing the best players they can." 
University of Florida's Whitney Benik and Lolita Frangulyan handed the Thompsons their only loss of the tournament in the finals 8-3. Christian Thompson

said that the prestige of the title match -and the pressure that came with it -ultimately proved to be the twins' Achilles heel. 
"When you get nervous, you don't move your feet as well," Christian Thompson said. "A win would've been sweeter at the tournament, but that match helped us realize what we need to improve on." 
Catrina Thompson agreed. 

"It was just mentally frustrating because we had opportunities to get back into it, but we didn't cap­italize," Catrina Thompson said. "It was hard not winning because

Despite the loss, Louderback praised the twins' performance, describing the tournament as a starting point for the season. 
"They will probably be ranked very high this season because of their play in the All-American tournament," Louderback said. "They will have to keep that high level of play because everyone will be out to beat them."

NO CROSS COUNTRY 


Irish com_pete in pre­NCAA cham_pionships 
Runners look to see how they compare to their competitors 
Special to the Observer 
Notre Dame's nationally ranked men's and women's cross country teams will travel to the campus of Indiana State University to take part in the pre-NCAA championships this Saturday, Oct. 16. Several of the nation's top teams are look­ing to see where they stack up against each other at the site of the 2004 NCAA cham­pionship to be held Monday, Nov. 22. The sixth-ranked Irish women take to the course at 11:35 a.m., while the No. 9 men hit the path at 
12:50 p.m. This meet pro­vides a great opportunity for runners to earn at-large points, which are critical for qualifying for the NCAAs if they do not place as an auto­matic qualifier. 
The Teams 
On the women's side, 23 of the teams are ranked in the top-30 of the latest FinishLynx.com poll. includ­ing eight in the top-10. Joining Notre Dame in the top-10 are the No. 1 ranked Stanford Cardinal, Michigan (3), Colorado (4). Arizona State (7). North Carolina (8). Tennessee (9). and Missouri (10). Fellow BIG EAST mem­bers, Villanova (12) and Georgetown (28). will also take to the course alongside the Irish. 
The men's field features 24 

of the top-30 in the latest MONDO poll and as was the case with the women, eight of the top-10 will be on hand. Stanford (2). Iona (4). Michigan (5), Colorado (6). Georgetown (7), North Carolina State (8), and Butler 
(1 0) join the riinth-ranked Fighting Irish in what ought to be a highly competitive race. Villanova also cracked the ranks in the men's poll at 12th. 
The Lineups 

The Notre Dame women will be running at full­strength for the first time all season. Junior Molly Huddle (Elmira, N. Y./N otre Dame) headlines a group of runners that includes senior Lauren King (Toronto, Ontario/Lawrence Park Coli. Inst.). who is running her first race of the 2004 cam­paign. Huddle placed 10th at the 2003 pre-nationals and King collected a top-20 fin­ish, as she placed 19th. Senior Kerry Meagher (Allentown. Pa./Allentown Central Catholic) looks to repeat her success of a sea­son ago when she finished 12th overall for the Irish, who placed third out of 32 teams. Stephanie Madia (Wexford, Pa./North Allegheny). a winner earlier this year at the National Catholic Invitational, fresh­man Sunni Olding (Minster, Ohio/Minster). junior Jean Marinangeli (Arlington Heights, Ill./Buffalo Grove). and junior Elizabeth Webster (Dearborn, Mich./Divine Child) round out the runners for Notre Dame.

"RecSports told us that if we 
tied O'Neill, we'd get the 
fourth playoff spot," Griffin 
captain Yin Monaco said. 
Instead, the Griffins were 
informed after the game that 
their season is finished and 
the Morrissey Manorites will 
be playing the. Knights after 
fall break. 
As for the game itself, 
O'Neill opened the scoring 
with a 50-yard interception 
return for a touchdown, first 
points of any kind scored on 
Stanford since their first game 
of the season. 
The resulting two-point con­
version was controversial, 
however. 
"None of the refs signaled 
that they got it in," Monaco 
said. "Until halfway through 
the third quarter we thought 
it was 8-6 us. Then they told 
us it had counted." 
Stanford then mounted a 
long drive behind its suddenly 
powerful running game, 
which accounted for 101 
yards on the night. 
Part of the improvement in 
the running game was credit­
ed to fullback Eddie Medick, 
who started the season on the 
defensive line but was placed 
on the offensive side of the 
ball last week against 
Morrissey. 
The march was halted, how­
ever, by an interception at the 
Angry Mob six-yard line. 
The next play, O'Neill tried 
to run a reverse pass, but the 
play broke down and resulted 
in a safety. 
Stanford then proceeded to 
push the ball 50-yards in 10 
plays to tie the game. 
Once O'Neill regained pos­
session of the ball, their next 
drive moved quickly, aided by 
an unsportsmanlike conduct 
penalty against Stanford fan 
Trinidad Arredando. He threw 
a football onto the field and 
hit O'Neill quarterback Matt 
Hughie in the back. However, 
the Mob's hopes were dashed 
by another interception. 
After the half. both teams played conservatively, espe­cially Stanford, since the Griffins thought a tie was all they needed. A last ditch pass by O'Neill was completed but ·came up well short of the goal 
line.

to look only at the next game on the schedule, the Irish fall break road trip is a tradition in the pro­gram. 
"This is typical fall break proce­dure for us," Sawyer said. "We know coming up to fall break we're going to be on a week-long road trip, playing three games, that's how it is every single year." 
However, a week away from campus isn't the chore that some might think. 

"They schedule it like that so we don't have to miss classes when we don't need to," Sawyer said. "But I think all the guys like beihgon the road together. If we're going to be off for fall break, we may as well be togeth­er on the road."

East tournament" coach Randy Waldrum said. "They are a very athletic team and are going to match up to us very well." 
Despite the similarities between the teams, the Irish have some­thing that no other Big East team has earned -a freshman player receiving offensive or defensive honors for the Big East players of the week. 
Amanda Cinialli achieved this 
honor this week for the Irish. 
"Cinalli has been playing really well. She has gotten some great goals the past two games," Schefter said. "She has played so well for a freshman and stepped up and been rewarded with great goals and the league has noticed that and given her an honor that she deserves." 
Waldrum said Cinalli has played great soccer since she joined the team this season. 
"I've been really happy with her since day one. She has looked and played like a veteran since she's been here," Waldrum said. 
Last Sunday, Cinalli scored a clutch goal for the team to tie the score 1-1 against Georgetown last in the first half before going on to win the contest 2-1. 

During the fall break, the Irish also face challenges against two other conference rivals. Waldrum is slightly disappointed that the games are scheduled during the break. 
"They are going to be huge for us. I wish they fell on weeks our students were back on campus because they are big games for us," Waldrum said. 
On Oct. 22, the Irish will be competing against Rutgers, cur­rently 9-7. 
"This game be key for us," Waldrum said. "It is going to be huge." 
The players are just as aware ofthe importance of this contest. 

"They've had great players in the past and we are definitely going to be ready for them," Schefter said. 
The Irish will close out the break on Oct. 24 against Seton Hall (6-5-2). Although its record is barley over .500, the team is not looking past any Big East rival. 
"Seton Hall [is] going to throw everything they can at us. We played a close game last year," Schefter-said. "If we aren't on top of our game, each team will play their best."

 
One factor that has loomed large so far for the Irish this season is the lack of produc­tion on the power play. That could prove to be a problem heading to Miami, where the Hedllawks are 2-0 on the young season. 
More notably. they have also yet to allow a power play goal by an opponent. 
"I look at our power play in the fact that we lost five tremendous seniors who all played a great deal of time on the power play last season," Poulin said. "We have to figure out what components fit

-
where. 
"We worked on it three days this week at practice, and I've never spent that much time on special teams since I've been a coach." 
The RedHawks were one of the surprise teams in the CCHA last season, picked to 

have missed a 
beat. Miami won the Lefty McFadden Invitational Tournament in Dayton, Ohio, knocking off Boston University 5-1 Friday and then defeating Northeastern 6-2 Saturday. 
The RedHawks and Irish are two of the youngest teams in the CCHA this season -Miami and Notre Dame each have just three seniors on its roster. 
"They're a team that's very similar to ours," Poulin said. "They lost five very very good seniors so th.ey're a team that really has to just get out there and skate. I'm hoping that both teams can just skate through the penalty situations this weekend and we can have a great series." 
Yet for the Irish so far the top player has been one of those three seniors. Goalie Morgan Cey started Notre Dame's 2-2 tie against Minnesota-Duluth Friday, making 38 saves on the way to be naming the Perani No. 1 Star of the Game. He is expected to start the first game against the RedHawks, as well. 
The senior has a 4-4-0 career average against Miami, with two shutouts. 
"[Cey] may have had as good a week [at practice] as any goalie I've ever coached here had," Poulin said. "He's been tremendous this week. He's stronger physically, really sharp mentally and just looks to be in tremendous control." 
After dealing with the RedHawks, the Irish return home to the Joyce Center to face Boston College in a one­game series for the John A. "Snooks" Kelly-Charles "Lefty" Smith Trophy. Notre Dame currently is the owner of that trophy, after their 1-0 'win last season, and they'd certainly like to continue owning it. 
Notes: 
Irish senior forward Brad Wanchaluk will no longer play for the Irish, Poulin said Thursday. 
"Brad is no longer with the team," he said. "It was my decision." 
Poulin declined further com­ment.

Navy's option offense is 
sixth in the country averaging 
267.4 rush yards per game . Notre Dame's mn defense is eighth in the nation, giving up 
86.8 yards per game. One of those averages has to budge come Saturday. 
Johnson said last season Notre Dame has parade All­Americans, Navy has guys that march in parades. The Irish must take their parade All-Americans, take their pride, take a swagger into stopping the run and trounce Navy until the message is delivered. 
That way, in the fourth quarter, Fitzpatrick will not even need to put his pads on. Because if Notre Dame plays like it should, Notre Dame won't need a hero.

But Navy is known for its running game. Being poised and under control will be a big factor in preventing the Midshipmen from getting free for big runs. 
So far in 2004, Navy has scored three rushing touch­downs of 20 yards or more ­and a big play in the dose Navy-Notre Dame game last year was a 65-yard touchdown run by Navy's Eric Rolfe after an Irish breakdown on defense. 

Early in the 2004 season, the Irish showed a susceptibility to giving up big plays. They will have to prevent those plays Saturday if they want a chance to win. 
"I just think you have to be sharper in what you do," Tuck said. "It takes away more of the risk that you'll take than against other teams. But in this game we know that we have to play our assignments. 
"We know that if you miss an assignment on any given play they can bust you for a long run. So we just have to be focused and geared in to play­ing them."

NAVY 2004 Schedule 
MIDSHIPMEN RUSHING 
Notre Dame's rush defense is ranked No, 12 in the country, surren­dering just 86.8 yards per game on the ground. The defensive line and linebackers held Stan­ford to 67 yards on 25 carries, and the second­ary is ready to tackle the Navy option attack.  
This is what Navy does. Navy runs the football. The Midshipmen have run the ball 281 times this season. They have thrown the ball 4 7 times. The unconven­tional wing-T offense and the option create at least some problems for all defenses that face it.  

If Notre Dame wins this battle, it wins the game. But the Navy running game is No. 6 in the nation, !\,nd th~ Midsljipffie Yf not lo~ yet ;nsing cbaracteris~jc...... opt attack. Polanco and full­back Eckel lead Navy against an equally threat­ening Notre Dame defenSe. 

MIDSHIPMEN PASSING 
The Irish secondary has struggled, particularly against Orton and Purdue. The 'bend­don't-break' philosophy has given opponents loads of yards but few touchdowns. The pass defense must contain option passes and trick plays against Navy. 
Polanco has the talent and ability to throw the ball downfield and make opposing defenses pay for sneaking up against the run. He has thrown three interceptions in 4 7 attempts thus far this sea­son. The leading Navy receiver is Tomlinson, with eight catches for 173 yards. 
SPECIAL TEAMS 
Fitzpatrick averages 41 yards per punt. He has made 5-of-7 field goals. In short, the kicking game has improved for the Irish. Coaches have changed personnel on kick coverages to prevent big returns. Anastasio and Hoskins lurk as danger­ous threats on returns.  
Navy averages a paltry 35.3 yards per punt and has made 1-of-5 field goals so far this season. The Midshipmen return kicks for an average of 21.5 yards and punts for 5.2 yards. Navy's special teams are not game changing and shouldn't be again Saturday.

Notre Dame will have more of a home crowd with alumni buying tickets to see the Irish at the Meadowlands. But the Irish are not playing well and are carrying a 40-game winning streak against a hostile and undefeat­ed Navy football team. 
Navy is 5-0 and probably tired of hearing about los­ing 40 straight to Notre Dame. The Midshipmen have played four average teams at best and aD I-AA program in Northeastern, so the Midshipmen are eager to prove what they can do against a national program like Notre Dame.

Fitzpatrick becomes 'star' of special teams 

By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN Sports Editor 
Last year at this time, he had just made a name for himself. 
D.J. Fitzpatrick helped Notre Dame beat Navy for the 40th consecutive time with his game­winning 40-yard field goal as time expired. 
Fitzpatrick was playing in place of Nicholas Setta, a senior who was a fourth-year starter until he got hurt earlier in the season. 
But this year is different for Fitzpatrick, a senior with one year of eligibility remaining. He started the season as the starter at both kicker and punter, and he has been solid at both posi­tions for the Irish. 
"When we started the season, I thought one of our areas of weakness would probably be our kicking game, that we need­ed to see it improve," Irish coach Tyrone Willingham said. "We had questions as to who would be our punter. We felt pretty good with D.J. as our kicker, but we were also going to look and see there if we couldn't improve." 
Fitzpatrick competed with sophomore Geoffrey Price for the starting spot at punter and he emerged as the starter for the first game. 
"That just comes from all the hard work I put in this summer and also Geoff putting pressure on me," Fitzpatrick said. "Him and I have been battling, and he's made me a better punter ana I've made him a better punter. Right now I just feel comfortable going out there and. trying to be consistent week in and week out and trying to help out the team in that respect." 

Fitzpatrick is averaging 42.7 yards per punt, booting 15 punts inside the 20-yard line. This is a vast improvement from last year's 36.8 yard average and only seven kicks inside the 20-yard line in six more attempts. 
"What D.J. has done has real­ly just took the lead and put himself in a position where we feel comfortable with him doing both of our field goal and extra points and also doing our punt­ing," Willingham said. "He has continued each week to improve and get better, whereas I think he's almost an 8-yard improve­ment over how he finished last year in his punting." 
Special teams coach Buzz Preston called Fitzpatrick the "shining star" of the special teams unit. But Fitzpatrick is as humble as ever, attributing his improvements to hard work and dedication this summer. · 
"I think it's all technique," Fitzpatrick said. "I am th~ same size this year, it's just a matter of hitting the ball cleanly, like a golf shot. If you hit the ball square, it's going to go a lot fur­ther. Now that I can manipulate the ball away from the returner, that will protect against big returns. . 
Fitzpatrick's improvements in punting have helped the Irish significantly. They can count on him for a consistent punt each time he goes out on the field, helping Notre Dame win the battle for field position. 
"[Good punting] is critical because that is an area that you can exchange fairly huge chunks of yardage," Willingham said. "If you have that as a plus for you, that means thai's one more first down that the oppo­nent has to gain, and in his case he's done a great job of punting the ball inside the 20-yard line, inside the 10-yard line. So you are really gaining there when you can back them up in that manner." 
Preston is also impressed with Fitzpatrick, who has hit 5-of-7 field goal attempts this season, with a long of 45 yards. 
"He's made great strides," Preston said. "He's been the most consistent aspect lof spe­cial teamsJ." 
Fitzpatrick also kicked off in the second half against Stanford, but that might not happen against Navy, as the Irish do not want to overuse his right leg. 
"We just have to keep him going, not over-kick him, use him wisely during practice," Preston said. "And if that can happen, we know he can have a heck of a year." 
Fitzpatrick also said although he doesn't want to do too much, he loves being able to do both the kicking and punting for Notre Dame. 
''I'm going to try to do as much as my leg will let me," Fitzpatrick said. "A kicker's leg is kind of like a baseball pitcher. You just can't push it too far, or you're going to be hurt the rest of the season. I'm just trying to be careful with it and when I do feel good and when coach thinks it's appropriate I'll be kicking off. 
"I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm always getting ready for something. No time to get cold or get out of the game men­tality. It's fun. It's a lot more f11n that way and I love it."

Undefeated Navy seeks to end win streak 
By JOE HETTLER Sports Writer 
Of the five teams Navy has beaten this season. one has a winning record -and that team is in Division 1-AA. 
The Midshipmen haven't exactly been world beaters en route to their 5-0 start, knock­ing off Duke (1-4), Northeastern (3-2 in Div. 1­AA), Tulsa (1-4), Vanderbilt (1­
4) and the Air Force Academy (3-3). But they enter Saturday's game against Notre Dame undefeated and eager to end a 40-year losing streak that dates back to 1963. 
That season, the Midshipmen were led by a quarterback named HogPr Staubaeh. Navy won the game 35-14, and Staubach went on to win the Heisman Trophy. 
Since then, there have been many rlose calls in the series, including 1997, 1999, 2002 and 2003. But each game, Notre Dame found a way to snatch victory from Navy's hands. 
During Monday's press con­fprence. Navy coach Paul Johnson blatantly downplayed Navy's chancps of beating Notre Dame this season. 
"People talk about the last 40 yPars, but the all-time series n~cord is 6 7-9-1 so it's not like [Navy wasl killing [Notre Darnel before the 40," said Johnson, who has compiled a 15-15 record during his two and half years at Navy. "There's a reason. We don't have anybody on our team that Notre Dame recruited." 

But Notre Dame coach Tyrone Willingham isn't buying Johnson's statement. 
"J look at it as another chal­lenge, another outstanding football team we have to play," Willingham said. "If we don't play our best, we won't win." 
The Midshipmen are ofT to a quick start thanks to an out­standing running game. They have run for over 200 yards in four of their first five games and are ranked sixth in the country in rushing, averaging 267 yards a game. 
To beat Navy, Notre Dame must stop the wing-T offense, which is based on a variety of misdirection runs and the option. Quarterback Aaron Polanco leads the team with 464 rushing yards, followed by fullback Kyle Eckel's 387 yards on the ground. 
Navy rarely throws a pass, as indicated by Polanco's numbers through the air this season ­30-for-47 for 563 yards, two touchdowns and three inter­ceptions. 
Notre Dame will counter that explosive Navy rushing attack with the nation's 12th best run defense, allowing just 86.8 yards per game. 
The Midshipmen have been involved in a variety of kinds of games this season, playing in three close games and two blowouts. 
Navy opened the year with a comfortable 27-12 win against Duke and followed that by slip­ping past Northeastern 28-24 on Sept. 11. 
They cruised past Tulsa the following week 29-0 and then squeaked past Vanderbilt 29­26 before facing their biggest game up to that point in the season -Air Force on Sept. 
30. ESPN was in Colorado for the Thursday night matchup broadeast nationwide. The Midshipmen used a last-minute field goal to escape with their second consecutive win against Air Force. 
With the win. the Midshipmen picked up more confidence heading into their bye week and Saturday's game. Navy fans in the stands held up signs during the Air Foree game saying, "We want Notre Dame." 
.Johnson is trying to keep expectations under control. But even he hinted that Navy has a chance to pull off one of the biggest upsets in their football history. 
"We aren't ever going to be on the same talent level as ~otre Damn, but sometimes the best players don't win, the best team does," Johnson said. "We 1-iave to try and get a plan and go try and be the best team."
