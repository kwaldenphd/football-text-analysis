Congress reasserts authority 
in ~~1~~ ~~~~~~!~!~~~,~J.:~,"~;,~~~~~~h~h·;~~.~~
''No longer is Congress willing to 
be a rubber stamp or cheerleader 
for the executive branch," Con­
gressman John Brademas told an 
overflow crowd yesterday at Hag-
gar Hall auditorium. 
Brademas. majority whip of the 
House of Representatives, dis­
cussed the changing role of Con­
gress in foreign policy. 
The third ranking Democrat in 
the House. Brademas represents 
Indiana's Third Congressional dis-· 
trict, which includes South Bend. 
Although the national and inter­
national crises of the first ·half of 
the twentieth century resulted in 
the •·•aggrandizement of the pres­
idency", Brademas explained, · ·•watergate ana Vietnam helped 
bring about . the reassertion . of·· 
Congress~onal authority in recent 
years." · · . · . 
Beginning with descripti<?ns of basic Americ~n govemment, Brad~ emas -explained why Congress should have a role in foreign policy. The framers qf the Constitution, he explained, intended the· executive and legislative branches to share the pmyers of foreign policy mak-. ing. 
Congress, according to the Con­
stitution, has the power to make 
laws governing foreign commerce, 
declaration of war and support of 
the armed forces. The President, 
as chief diplomat and commander­
in-chief, also has diplomatic, mil­
itary and war-making powers. 
Normally, the powers are shared by the two branches. However, the depression of the 1930's, World Wars I and II and the Korean War "triggered the need for decisive action, for leadership from one head," Brademas said. Con­sequently, Congress was forced to let the President make quick de­cisions in these crisis situations. 
In the post-World War II era of Me" and "Talkin' Blues." He recalled his day·s with Guthrie in I-lew York, when they were called

applause of his own. He also played two instrumentals on the recorder. 
"Sometimes there's a powerful message you can say even if you don't say a word," he noted. 
After singing "Where Have All the Flowers Gone," Seeger re­marked that often the simplest songs are the best. "You bounce the experience of your life through simple words and often they bounce with new meaning," he said. 
"Real folk music is kitchen 
music, back porch music, maybe 
barroom music," he explained. 
Once called a "Commie folk· 
singer" by the New York Herald, 
Seeger noted the importance of

sources s~id the bargainers "had a difficult morning." 
Meanwhile. Energy Secretary James R. Schlesinger told Con­gress the administration is pre­pared to order coal moved to states hard hit by the strike if the walkout isn't ended soon. 
Schlesinger also said that between 6,000 and 8,000 mega­watts of electricity a day already are being moved to utilities in Midwestern states faced with the severest coal shortages and that the government is studying ways to increase this flow. 
Marshall told reporters he would keep bargainers for the striking United Mine Workers (UMW) and the soft-coal industry in session throughout the night if necessary to meet his deadlines. 
Marshall declined to say what steps might be taken if negotiators are unable to reach agreement by today. 
Carter meets governors 
Meanwhile, President Carter, 

who prodded the bargainers with a 
White House pep talk Wednesday 
night, arranged -to meet with 
governors from a dozen states 
hardest hit by the increasingly 
disruptive strike. 
Officials said the discussion 

would deal with ways to alleviate 
hardships caused by the walkout. 
In addition, they said Benjamin 
Civiletti, in charge of the Justice 
Department's criminal division, 
would meet with the governors to 
discuss ways of preventing vio­
lence. 
Governors from lllinois, Indiana, 

Ohio, Michigan, Missouri, Ken­
tucky, West Virginia, Virginia, 
Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Mary­
land and Wisconsin were invited. 
Sources had said earlier that 

Marshall, who is taking personal 
control of the talks, intended to 
keep negotiators at work in inten­
sive sessions. 
Negotiators had no comment 

before beginning face-to-face dis­
cussion. 
Union president Arnold Miller 
said Wednesday night he thinks a 
contract agreement is possible by 
the end ofthe week ifthe other side 
will "get down to business." 
"I'll know how serious they are a 
few minutes after we sit down," he 
said. 
But another source said, "It 
could take a while, depending on 
how hard-headed both sides want 
to be." 
. Resumption of the talks on 
Wednesday came as the effects of themselves on the country. 

Effects on states 

In Indiana, National Guardsmen 
escorted coal trucks over a road 
strewn with nails. In Ohio, state 
troopers kept an eye on coal 
shipments in their state. 
Utilities in both states staved off 
power cutbacks for another day,but 
officials said curtailments appear 
inevitable before another week 
goes by. 
In Missouri, about 350 workers 
at the Noranda Aluminum Inc. 
plant at New Madrid were laid off 
after the company had trouble 
securing electricity because of 
dwindling coal supplies. 
Meanwhile, Carter announced 
he has granted Indiana Gov. Otis . R. Bowen authority to suspend clear air regulations as a coal­saving measure. He earlier had granted similar authority to the 
governor of Ohio. 
The Commerce Department said 
the coal strike already was affect­
ing industrial production but that it 
would be another month before it 
could disrupt the economy. 
The industrial output showed 
coal production in December was 
half of what it was in November 
and that it fell even more in 
January. 
The Association of American 
Railroads said rail carloading of 
coal for the five weeks ending Feb. 
4 fell by 55 percent from the 
comparable period in 1977. It said 
major railroads have begun provid­
ing additional service to Eastern 
and Midwestern points they do not 
normally serve in order to transport 
surplus coal from the West to 
hard-pressed utilities and indus­
tries. 
Marshall said Wednesday night 
negotiators reached "general con­
sensus" that a tentative contract 
settlement rejected by the union's 
bargaining council would serve as a 
starting point for the resumed 
talks. He said bargainers agreed 
not to reopen the entire settlement 
package. 
The rebellious bargaining coun­
cil rejected the tentative settlement 
last Sunday. The agreement, voted 
down 30-6, would have levied fines 
and imposed other discipline on 
miners participating in wildcat 
strikes. It also would have meant 
company takeover of health cna 
pension systems now administered 
by independent trustees and would 
have meant deductibles in health 
insurance coverage now free to the 
UMW members and their depend­
ants.

nion once moved a massive arsenal of nuclear missiles near its border with China and offered to join the United States in a pre­eruptive nuclear strike against the Chinese, according to H.R. Hald­eman, former White House chief of staff. 
Haldeman's new book, The Ends of Power, claims that U.S. recon­naissance photos showed 1,800 Russian nuclear missiles grouped within two miles of the Ussuri River 
on the Chinese border during the 1969 Soviet-Chinese confrontation, according to ABC News, which said it had obtained galley proofs of the book. 
The report said further that Haldeman once President Richard 
M. Nixon'~ chief aide, had Jogged a prediction by Henry A. Kissinger on Dec. 10, 1969, that the Soviets would attack China by the following April 15. 
Kissinger was then national se­curity advisor at the White House. 
According to the book, Nixon subsequently ordered ambassador to Poland walter Stoessel to pub­licly contact China's ambassador in Warsaw in order to signal, in ABC's words, "in unmistakable terms. American disapproval of the proposed nuclear strike. Only after that did the Russian remove their nuclear forces." 
In an interview with ABC News, Kissinger denied Haldeman's ver­sion of the Soviet-Chinese episode.

1itEW plans tighter control \lover student aid program 
Washington [AP]--HEW Secretary Joseph A. Califano Jr. announced today that his department will rely primarily on federal employees rather than private bill collect~r~ to track down more than $400 mlllton in defaulted student loans guaran­teed by the government.· 
The secretary of health, education and welfare said private collection agenc.ies will be. us~d "on an 
e~penmental ?asts lD. two re­
gtons. '' He satd concern for the privacy and civil rights of student borrowers has slowed the depart­ment's announced plan to turn the former students' bad debts over to private collectors. 
Califano also announced a prog­ram to tighten controls over federal aid programs for students and said that HEW will seek legislation enabling the Internal Revenue Service, (IRS), to halp track down defaulters. 
A section of the 1976 tax law prohibits the IRS from providing taxpayers to anyone outside the government. 
Califano said he will ask the Treasury Department and the IRSto support an amendment that would permit the IRS to provide ex-stud­cnt's current addresses to the institutions that granted the .loans. 
"We will inten"Sify collection ef­
forts," Califano said. "We will rely 
primarily on HEW employees, but 
we will contract with private col­
lectors on an experimental basis in 
two regions. We will also begin 
new training programs in debt 
collection practices for the ;Jeder 
personnel."

As a service to Saint Mary.'s students; faculty, and staff, the Notre Dame Credit Union has opened a SMC branch in the lower level of LeMans Hall, available Monday through Friday from 9 
a.m. until 3 p.m.

Barbituates cauise cancer in rats 
byEdMoran \ 
Research conducted at the Gal­
vin Life Science Building, headed 
by Morris Pollard, chairman of the 
microbiology department, has 
shown that the use of barbituates 
can accelerate the growth of cancer 
which is already present in ani­
mals. 

The experiment. conducted on 
rats, was an offshoot of a four-year 
project designed to determine the 
nature of the aging process in 
animals. "Once we found that the 
rats had developed cancer, we 
decided to take advantage of it and 
go ahead with the expenment,'' 
said Pollard. 

Pollard stated that tl ~ dose 
given to the rats in their drinking 
water was comparable to an 
amount which would sedate a small 
child. 

Although the experiment may 
affect the ways of treating cancer 
patients. breast cancer, and pros­
tate cancer patients in particular, 
Pollard ·refused to term the experi­
ment a breakthrough, instead call­
ing the results "a new develop­
ment in the study of cancer." 
The findings, published in the 
scientific journal "Oncology," 
received national attention and 
were released on the AP and UPI

Alaska pipeline to resume 
after JSabotage causes spill 
FAIRBANKS, Alaska [AP] • Workers prepared to restart the trans-Alaska pipeine yesterday fol­lowing the second sabotage and the biggest sptll in the line's short history. An Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. spokesman said the line, which became fully operational last July, was heading toward restart by midday yesterday. Thousands of barrels of crude oil gushed from a two-inch hole blown in the half-inch steel pipeline on Wednesday. Alaska State troopers said some kind of explosive device was used to blast the hole in the $7.7 billion pipeline. A 20-foot length of slow-burning fuse was fuund near the site of the blast. about six miles east of Fairbanks. troopers said. The spilled oil formed into pools 
of frozen tundra before workers could place atemporary patch over the jagged gash. The State Department of Envi­ronmental Conservation estimated the leaked oil covered up to one acre, with a mist of oil spattering five to 10 acres. Much of the oil seeped under the 3 -foot snow cover. No one had a precise estimate on the amount of oil spilled. But Alyeska said it was the largest so far. The largest previous spill, totaling Jess than 1,000 barrels, occurred during last summer's startup, when a worker accidently drove a truck into the 800-mile pipeline. Troopers said there were no arrests in the latest incident. the second involving explosives and the pipeline. Three persons were

Tanker trucks were dispatched to take away the oil that workers siphoned from large pools around the elevated portion of the line. By late Wednesday, nearly 1,000 bar­rels of spilled oil -clean enough for use -had already been loaded into trucks and taken to the nearby North Pole refinery. 
Oil-laden snow was trucked out. 
Alyeska personnel, state troop­ers and a military demolition team also worked through the night to uncover additonal clues. Investiga­tors found a hole at the base of the depression and a black stain on the snow, which they believed were the remains of a primer cord for explosives.

Volunteer info available for '79 seniori 
by Renee I..eucbtenJ 
The Office of Volunteer Services has information on volunteer opportunities for seniors next year. Social workers, youth workers, teachers, day care workers and skilled tradespeople are among many of the volunteers needed in organizations throughout the United States and foreign coun­tries. 
Sister Judith Anne Beattie, dir­ector of Volunteer Services believes there are more people now inter­
.J 

ested in post-graduate voluntary ' service than in previous years. She attributes this to the new courses with social justice themes which have raised the consciousness of students who are interested in testing themselves and their com­mitment to justice. Beattie added that some people are looking for a simpler lifestyle and others want to take time off before beginning graduate school. Also some students are looking to reaffirm the values they have as Christians as well as to decide whether they want to pursue careers in certain fields, she said. 
Students may find information about voluntary organizations inthe Office of Volunteer Services in LaFortune. So that the student may clarify in his own mind why he would like to do voluntary service. and what type of work, living and financial arrangements he would like, Beattie encourages stu­dents to put into writing these ideas and then make an appoint­ment to speak with her. 
Students are advised to act immediately because application deadlines for many of the programs are soon.

Pull the Plug 
Colder, dimmer days are ahead for all of us, as Indiana and Michigan Electric Co. (I&M) is forced by the coal shortage to cut back on energy allowances. 
With the United Mine Workers (UMW) and the Bituminous Coal Operators As­sociation {BCOA) still at loggerheads after a 73-day strike, drastic energy rationing has become a necessity in Indiana and elsewhere. Even if current negotiations are successful, a contract probably could not be approved by the UMW bargaining council and ratified by the 160,000 striking miners in less than two weeks. If the negotiaions are not successful, the coal shortage may force the closing of schools, which rank lowest on the energy priority list. 
Saint Mary's, which receives all its electric power from I&M, has already voluntarily cut back energy consumption by 35 percent. Notre Dame has also reduced its energy consumption, although the University, with its own power plant and a 6-8 week supply of coal, is only partially dependent on I&M for electricity.

~ 
soon, Saint Mary's and Notre Dame may have to send their students home and make up the lost time at spring break (if the strike is settled) or through independ­ent study. To keep the campuses operating as long as possible, students must do their part to cut down energy consumption. 
Students can help by: --keeping room or house lighting to a minimum. --curtailing the use of appliances such as popcorn poppers, hot pots, electric curlers and curling irons, hot lather machines, electric razors, strobe lights, etc. --disconnecting dorm room refrigerators (the window sill makes a pretty good substitute). --minimizing use of stereos, radios and TV sets. Popular shows could be listened to or watched by groups using one machine rather than by each person in his own room. --taking shorter, cooler showers and otherwise keeping down hot water use. --putting an extra blanket on the bed and wearing warmer nightclothes, rather than turning up the heat. --handwashing necessary items such as socks and underwear and drip-drying them. 
Students will also be asked to put up with inconveniences which may include (and in some cases, do include) dimmer lighting in the dining halls and the libraries, less heat in classrooms, and reduced hours at Angela, the ACC, LaFortune, the Snack Bar and other campus buildings. 
Please remember that we are in the midst of an extraordinary situation -the nation's longest coal strike-and are forced to take extraordinary measures to keep our schools operating.

Racism 
and the 

shuttle 

Dear Editor: 
I would very much like to give an 

ar:count of an experience to the 
Notre Dame -Saint Mary's com­
munity. The occurence took place 
wcr a week ago, but it is still fresh 
1r1 my mind. 
Several black students and :nysclf had taken the shuttle to the ')aint Mary's campus to attend the performance of the Talent 'N Action Theater Troupe at che Little Theatre. After the 5-hl)W we went to catch the shuttle and return to Notre Dame. 
We stood in front of Holy Cross. appro.'<imately 25 strong. waiting for the bus. When it could be seen approaching. thirty or so coeds (all white) came out of Holy Cross to board the bus as well. Fine. 
We got on the bus first, almost all of us each taking a separate seat. Consequently, there were only one or two seats left totally unoccupied when the first white student boarded. After those seats were taken, one would expect that they would begin taking seats next to us. What did happen was truly disgracefull! 
The coeds all chose to stand; and even though black students (both men and women) were seated throughout the entire bus, they refused, at first, to go any further than the back door. This not only 
showed the lack of respect which they had for us, but the lack of respect which they held for each other as well. Those who were already within the warmth of the bus were selfish enough to let their neighbors, their friends, stand out in the snowy cold. Even after several requests by the driver that those standing should step to the rear of the bus, the coeds stubbornly refused. 
Fortunately for those outside, we don't possess such an immature mentality. Those black students who were sitting one to a seat doubled up so that those white coeds who were reluctant tu share seats with us could sit down. More importantly, we didn't feel that those who hadn't already boarded should be made to suffer because of the childish attitudes of others 
Q 
(even though they might have acted equally childish had they been on the inside.) A couple of gentlemen stood so that the coeds could sit down. (I was one of them.) And it was only after the driver's requests turned to com­mands that a few students did finaly venture past the rear exit. 
At the time I thought what was happening was funny -I seldom fail to find stupidity humorous. But later I became angered, realizing that the entite scene had been extremely insulting. But how I feel doesn't matter. What is important is how you feel. How does it feel to know that such an antiquated mentality continues to exist at a Christian university, whose moral foundation is (supposedly) bro­therly love? America, haven't you learned your lesson yet? Were you taught nothing by the holocaust? Did Martin Luther King Jr. live (and) die in vain? 
I don't want to answer these questions, but you must. College is the final plateau of institutional education. Unfortunately, having reached that summit, I must pain­fully confront the reality -Amer­ica's oldest and strongest tradition continues to thrive at Notre Dame.

We deserve the facts, not rhetoric 
Dear Editor: 

In the game of rhetorical chess played by the University adminis­tration and the Teamsters over workers' rights to unionize, public opinion has been a pawn manipula­ted by both opponents. On<! of the latest moves, Mr. Mason's letter appearing in The Observer Jan. 31, is typical: the public is told the University has never engaged in wrongdoing and will "present its evidence in public" to prove this. Notre Dame has made the state­ment before, yet no evidence has been produced. The letter says nothing new, beyond Mason's ac­cusation that the Teamsters have delayed the NLRB decision. 
The Teamsters charge Notre Dame with blocking workers' unionization attempts. But they 
produce no ev\_dence ·either, also using rhetolic. not facts. Mr. Parra, in his response to Mason, printed Feb. 6 in The Observer, says it is Notre Dame which is dragging its feet by hiring "a fancy law firm." Parra, sidesteps the charges of delay made by Mason, only to make his own accusations. 
This is my advice to the Univer­sity and the Teamsters: Stop the flow of rhetoric. The issue is already clouded enough. Now that Wednesday's NLRB hearing has been postponed until April, challenge both sides to make a public presentation of their evi­dence, in a public forum, modera­ted by an impartial campus authori­ty, perhaps Fr. John Fitzgerald. No lawyers, no rhetoric, just the public. 
If the University and the Team­sters have any respect for the human beings involved in this matter--not just groundskeepers, but also concerned students and faculty--they will step away from the chessboard, face the public with concrete evidence, and tell the truth.

Letters to a Lonely God 
The Friday After Ash Wednesday / 
Reverend Robert Griffin 

Last week, the Friday after Ash Wednesday, a part of me that I loved very much was separated from me and set ahead of me into an early grave. Some teeth (not all, but only some) were set upon by a dentist with an angry forceps, grappled with as though they were the powers of darkness, and pulled out ofmy head as painfully as though they had roots that grew down to my heart. Afterwards, I mo•1rned the loss of those teeth as though I had betrayed them. In a very real sense, blameless little fellows that they were, I feel that I did betray them. 
Oh, how detached Mister Modern Dentist seems when he looks over your mouth and says of life-long molars, "Well, Father, I guess those teeth there can come out." 
"Come out." you want to scream at him, 
"Why that's part of me that you're talking 
about. I've put a million hours into 
brushing those teeth. I've sat up with them 
nights when they weren't feeling well, 
bringing them cups of cold water and 
aspirin. Those are the teeth I graduated 
from high school with; the teeth that gave 
me a stiff upper lip when I kissed my first 
girl friend. What to hell is this "Come out" 
crap you are handing me?" 
But you don't speak that way to Mister 
Detached Modern Dentist. Instead you 
suggest practically: "Couldn't we just take 
out the nerve and wax them with Glocoat? 
Couldn't we enlay them with diamonds and advertise for Tiffany's? Couldn't we call in Dr. DeBakey and transplant them to my navel?" Oh, God, I don't want to lose those teeth. I don't want to admit that a part of me is dying. I don't want them to precede me into eternal life. 
In the end, Mister Detached Modern Dentist has his selfish way, jabbing you jaw with novocaine. You think:"If those teeth had eyes, they would look at me now like Darby O'Gill, pleading to be kept and not. sent to the used puppy farm." You remember the filet mignons those teeth have bitten into, the gallons of Manhattan that have washed over them. You sing them snatches of a popular song: ''I've been true to you, darlings in my fashion. I've beeri true to you, darlings, in my way." In the end, nothing takes away the pain; nothing diminishes the guilt. 
Afterwards, the teeth lay side by side, like fallen marines, on the dentist's table. The nurse says: "Would you like to keep them?"· 
"What for?" you snarl. "The tooth Fairy will never find her way into my bedroom. The Tooth Fairy discriminates against me on account of age.'' 
You look at them stretched out as little corpses. and you want to cry. "Go not gentle into that good night,'' you whisper. That same day. Mister Detached Modern Dentist replaced my natural teeth with chompers of his own. Did you ever have 
strange chompers pushed into your face, mismanaging themselves, behaving badly, like the Irish moving into Protestant neighborhoods? I find it hard to imagine, if I were ever married and then divorced, that I could risk it with a second wife; but I think it would be easier to do that than to get along with alien teeth. 
On Wednesday of last week, ashes were placed on my head, and I was reminded that, as man, I came from dust, and into duft I will return. The liturgy has no ritual as stern as the dentist's chair to warn us that in our bodies, we have no lasting city, and day after day, the Enemy is pound.ng down the walls. But if for days now, I have had the blues stabbing at my mind like the regret for a lost love, it has not been death that is depressing me, nor the torture from teet)-that didn't come with the mouth. 
Last week, when I first felt with my tongue the spaces left by the removal of teeth that I loved, I honestly par.icked. Irreversible, unchangeable decision! Oh, horror inflicted against pearls of great price! Sin against the body's wholeness: crime against the mouth that suckled at my mother's breast! 
I admit: I get nervous at a hair cut; I store toe nail clippings in a jar. There is none of me that I like to lose; maybe it's because we never had much when I was a child. I have had friends I could say goodbye to more easily than to those teeth, friends I would willingly lay down my life for. I 
wanted those teeth buried with full military honors: there was so much of the good 
fight we had fought together. 
The teeth .I have left are now being pampered like spoiled children. I'm just afraid they are going to start distrusting me. "You got rid ofthem," they could say. "Maybe someday, you'll get rid of us." 
"Honestly," I want to explain, "that's not the way it happened. You see, there was this detached modern dentist..." I can imagine those remaining teeth turning up their noses at my excuses. 
The body, they say, is merely an irs ~rument to be used by the soul; at death, we will give up our bodies, at least until the Resurrection. Maybe the reason God lets us fall apart is so that we can begin early, hoping for the Resurrection. Maybe He takes back our bodies gradually, bit by bit, moment by moment,. permitting us to begin to die from the instant of our birth, sometimes even snatching back--through the angry tools of Mister Detached Modern Dentist--parts of the body the soul hasn't even finished with. 
There is comfort on the far side of anguish 
as we watch our bodies die: "These dry 
bones will live again." 
Even Mister Detached Modern Dentist can't tell me that the best part of my smile will not live forever. 
Juni Mitchell's new albun• Don Ju;m 's Reckless Daughter, is unm ual in many wavs, but the fact that it is u;~usual is not, in i-tself. unusual. Her alh11m· have te!lded to\\ ard the idiosyncratic sit.c:e her live Miles of Aisles summed up and thereby capped off her career as popular-acces· -;able-singer-songwriter. With The Hissing of Summer Laws, then Hejira, and now Don Juan's Reckless Daughter,she has, dc!Jcnding on one's perspective, either W( irded out or pretty much bitten the dust as a major talent, or gone on to pursue her in· ~rests and develop her talents by cr:atively experimenting and expanding ht.. · style. From both perspectives Joni M:tchell has been unusual; the difference bc!ween the two perspectives lies in the co mutations they give this word: "unusual would mean ''strange'' from the first 
p('rspective and "ambitious" from the 
s<:"~ond. (The reason for the two perspec· 
tives is. I feel. a misunderstanding on the 
part of those with the first perspective. 
Many of those who reject Joni Mitchell's 
newer material judge it in terms of her 
ol.ier, very good and very accessablc style, 
ad because of this they are unable to 
a1•preciate the newer stuff on its own 
le··el.) 
This is an ambitious album. Ms. 
Mitchell takes a lot of risks. sticks her neck out quite a bit. Even before listening to it, you (as an average record buyer) might observe from the notes that she sings one song accompanied only by percussion instruments, sings another song backed . only by an accoustic guitar (somewhat of a return to her "folk" days) includes an "Overture" (what is that?), fills one whole side with one song (something that is unheard of from a major song writer-singer since Bob Dylan's "Sad Eyed Lady of the LowLands" eleven years ago), and even includes a seven minute percussion in­strumental. Also, if you were familiar with the group, you might notice that all but one of the members of Weather Report play on the album, not surprising considering Joni's similar use of the L.A. Express a few years ago. except that what she uses here 
are not horn players but percussionists 
and a bass player, Jaco Pastorius. 
Finally. you would notice that it is a double 
album. indicating a physical as well as 
stylistic expansion of her music. (You 
might wonder about the justification 
behind expansion. however. because at 60 
minutes this album is only about ten 
minutes longer than her last, yet almost 
twice as expensive.) Having observed all 
of this, regardless of whatever else you 
might say, you would not say she wasn't 
ambitious. 
When the record finally does reach the 
turntable, the average record buyer-turned 
listener will find it a very fine album. The 
"Overture." a strangely pretty interplay 
between guitar, bass, and vocal parts, 
pulls the listener in almost hypnotically. 





Joni Mitchell's Don Juan 
At the same time it is an excellent lead-in to "Cotton Avenue, the most catchy and :.tpbeat song on the album. This is a funnny yet sympathetic song about night­life in a small town, and it is the first of many references to youger days. The next song. "Talk to Me," is on a more serious note. It is an earnest sometimes desperate appeal to a gentleman for conversation. 
then returns to the basic song for its conclusion, and finally ends with a string instrumental, "Into the Sunset" fadeout which might conceivably have been found on a Weather Report album except for Ms. Mitchell's distinctive piano. The song is one of Joni Mitchell's biggest gambles on the album, and though the piece is not flawless, it works. Since it is a gamble, 
J.· 

songy, almost childlike vocal, which deals again with dreams. The contrast of her innocent-sounding voice with the primal drumbeats offers a contrast which might strike many as being too eclectic, too unharmonis, but I find it interesting. The lack of instrumentation is so glaring that I find myself filling in harmonies and other background sounds, and I do not think it is improbable that she intended something like this. 
With side four comes a return to normalcy, relatively speaking of course, songs bemg offered in a more familiar form. This side is the most emotionally revealing of all. It begins with "Don Juan's Reckless Daughter," a song describing a short-term affair--the type of which seems most common for her--using American Indian metaphors and terse, Indian-stereo­type language, occasionally throwing pieces of the American national anthem for effective contrast. She realizes the draw­backs involved in such encounters, but expresses confidence that in the end more good comes from the!Jl than bad. She sings about the less glamorous type of short­term affair in the next song, where she describes the pains of being an abused lover, an "Off Night Backstreet"who "he" comes to see only when he wants to cheat on his girlfriend. Both of these songs address a person ("you") directly, and so would seem to be rather immediate reactions to these relationships. She ob­serves her lifestyle in a more reflective light (and in first-person) in the final song, "The veils of Ardor." In this in 
(··Are you really exclusive or just miserly? You spend every sentence as it were marked currency! Come and spend some on me.") Ms. Mitchell's voice and guitar are accompanied only by Jaco Pastorius' bass. and this arrangement is very effective in highlighting the intensity of her plea. The side ends with "Jericho," a song about dealing with a disintegrated romance. The song appeared for the first time on Miles of Aisles in a snappier, 
happier version, but this version is more appropriate to the message being con­veyed. 
Side two is "Paprika Plains," a sixteen minute song dealing with Joni Mitchell's childhood, Indians, and dreams, all three of which are themes that recur throughout the album. It begins with the basic song (lyrics set to the melody). then moves into an interlude with piano and strings dominating -nice but perhaps a bit long -­something new and out ofthe ordinary, it is that much more satisfying when it does work. This is the high point of the album. Side three, in contrast, is a bit disap­pointing. It opens with "Otis and Marl­ena," a scathingly sarcastic song about old people who go to Florida for the comfort­able, artificial existence the area offers them. ("They've come for fun and sun/ while Muslims stick up Washington...") Such treatment seems unnecessary; any ridicule of old people seems cruel. An attack on the privelege of wealth might be justifiable. but this is not what she strikes at -in this song. Following this is "The Tenth World," a seven-minute persussion instrumental, featuring eight different types of percussion instruments, and including various unintelligible chants thrown in from time to time. I don't know what Ms. Mitchell's intentions were in including this when she made her album, 
j 

b~ jim ha~es 
but they certainly did not match my expectations of enjoying it when I bought it. It seems to have no reason for existence but them again, what, or who, does. The last song on the side is "Dreamland, " the apparent conclusion to "The Tenth World" in that the percussion instruments domi­nate, t '1ough they use a bit more restraint here. In "Dreamland" they serve as accompaniment for Joni Mitchell's sing­
song. which she utilizes only voice and guitar, returning to her most basic musical as well as spiritual level, Joni Mitchell expresses regret for her loss of innocence-thereby explaining her pre-occupation with her childhood--and voices a desire for an ideal love, thus clarifying the importance of her dreams, since "It's just in dreams we fly" ("we" meaning she and her lover). 
Beyond being impressed by her voice, which has never sounded better, and by her lyrics, which continue in their general level of excellence, and by her general musical talents, which are awesome, one is moved by her honest and authentic emotion to the point where one feels with her. It is the ability to accomplish this last effect that makes Joni Mitchell an out­standing rather than merely proficient artist. It is the accomplishment itself that makes this album such a pleasure to listen to.

Head's rapport with the audience is marvelous and, though all of the other major skaters do a commendable job, he easily steals the show. For many of the children in the crowd, the highlight of the evening is appearance of the Hanna­Barbara cartoon characters. Scooby-Doo, Yogi Bear, Quick­Draw McGraw, Fred Flinstone and Huckleberry Hound all appear in the skit ''Scooby-Doo and the Gang from Magicland." This skit has members of Ice Capades Corps de Ballet skating as butterflies and as daisies in beautifully colored cos­tumes. 
Two other skits are particularly worthy of mention. "Island Mag­ic," performed right before in~er­mission is visually stunning with spectacular lighting, bright back­
ground, colorful costumes, and 1ine skating. David Sadleir, Australian champion Sharon Burley and Rob­ert Berry all individually showcase their skating talents during this act. 
The other noteworthy act, which directly follows the 15-minute intermission, is "Chopin Fan­tasy." This is a beautifully choreographed piece, skated by the Corps de Ballet to the music of Chopin. The fantasy reminds one of a scene from "Nutcracker Suite." 
All in all it is a most entertaining show. Two of the remaining six Ice Capades performances at the ACC

Ice Capades is in the process of making its annual tour through the United States. This weekend the show has stopped in South Bend to give the people of the Michiana region a chance to see its magic. 
This year's version of the Ice Capades revolves around the theme of magic. The titles of the individual acts of the performance indicate this. The show opens with a peice called "Magic-Time" and moves on to other acts entitled "H okey-Pocus,"' "Champion Magic," and "Magic Moments." All of the magic is not serious, however, as there are many put­ons, pranks and figure skating follies throughout these routines. 
The skater who is most noticable during these routines is Terry Heao. Although there are five or six other skaters who were an­nounced as stars of the show along with Head, he steals the show. Head is an ice comic; an ice comic who easily captures the fancy of the audience, especially the younger people in it. 
Two of Head's skits are partic­ularly memorable. The first is called "The Artist's Surprise." Here Head is an artist who has created what seems to be a monster. In reality it is only a beautiful woman. Gisela, who needs only some oil to get her mechanical joints moving. Once Head finally gets her moving, the two skate madcap around the ice, taking physical liberties with each other in the process. Their frollicking is particularly enjoyable. 
The second skit of Head's which is memorable is entitled "Horns-A­Plenty," a take-off on the\ '<ings. Again, the comic's frantic ::.i,ating

A Notre Dame senior charged Dynamic Reading Inc. with ·'fraud or negligence" for inflating the final test scores of students taking a speed reading course last week­end in the CCE. 
Jerry Harmon, Dynamics course instructor, denied the charge, and noted that Ed Hendrie, the student who made thecharge,received a full

The Sociology Club of Notre Dame is holding it's annual mini-convention tomorrow from 1 to 5 
p.m. in LaFortune Student Center. Any student, regardless of major, who has written a paper of sociolo­gical interest is urged to submit it. 
The papers will be discussed in student-moderated forums. The author of the paper judged to be the best in each section will be invited to submit it to the third annual Intercollegiate. Sociology Convention to be held at NO on 
April 7 and 8. 
The Sociology Club President, Mark Samolczyk, stated that any person who has ever written a paper for a sociology course is invited to submit it in the mini-con­vention. Participants will be asked to present a short, oral outline of the paper. A discussion among students will follow the presenta­tion.

Hendrie said that on the final class day Harmon gave. the stu­dents part of a book to read. They were told to raise their hands when ­they finished. Harmon, who timed ~hem, wrote their individual read-mg rates on the blackboard after they raised their hands. 
"J:Ie wrote down that I was readm~ 3,~00 words a minute," ~e~dne satd, "but ~ knew that was ndtculous. I had timed myself by

Harmon replied that he does not agree that Hendrie read the pas­sage in four minutes. "I don't know the exact time, but what he told me was not what I read on my stopwatch," Harmon asserted. 
"I changed his score because I wasn't going to stand there and argue with him in front of the rest of the class," he added. "I wasn't going to sacrifice the confidence and the positive feelings the other people had." 
Harmon ~aid he felt the dis­agreement with Hendrie .arose from a "personal conflict." He said he refunded Hendrie's money 
"because he wasn't happy, and not because he didn't increase his reading speed at least three times, as we guarantee." 
Harmon added that the note on the final comprehension test stat­ing the passage contains 5,000 words is incorrect. He said the person who composed the test notified Dynamic Reading teachers months ago that there were really 6 400 words in the passage 
'The students were told ab~ut this error, Harmon said. He noted that the chart he used to calculate reading speeds is based on 6,400 words in the passage. 
''I've never counted it word for

Harmon said that if he finds out for himself that there are closer to 5,000 words than 6,400, he will use 5,000 words in the calculations for thts weekend;s class. "I'm going to figure student 
student will calculate the time for himself and we will check it against my stopwatch to see if the times agree." 
Pat Campbell, who completed one of the weekend courses taught in the Fall semester, noted, "If you can get your money back, I don't see how people can be hurt." 
"As far as I'm concerned," Campbell added, "I'm so excited about the course I'd recommend to my friends to go. Since I've completed the course, I know I get more out of reading than before." 
This. fall w~s the first time Dynamic Readmg, Inc. came to ence co-ordinator Philip McKier­nan to rent space on campus to conduct its course. 

"We've never had any com­plaints before," McKiernan noted. 
Harmon said although he has given refunds for the course before, this is the first time anyone has questined the integrity of the course. Harmon has taught previ­ous Dynamic Reading courses at Michigan, Michigan State, Eastern Michigan, Western Michigan and Akron universities. 
He has also taught other speed reading courses at Notre Dam~ as an Evelyn Wood teacher, he satd.

Soviet dissident to discuss USSR human rights 
Avital Shcharansky, wife of im­prisoned Soviet dissident Anatoly Shcharansky, will talk about the current human rights situation in the Soviet Union next Tuesday at 
4:30 p.m. in the Library Lounge. 
Anatoly Shcharansky, a 29-year old computer programmer, worked openly for several years on behalf of human rights and was a leading figure in the Jewish emmigration movement. 
He is also one of the 43 members (eleven of whom are now in prison) of the Helsinki Monitoring Group, a group created in Moscow in May, 1976 by several prominent dis­sidents to enforce Soviet comp­liance with the human rights clause of the 1975 Helsinki Accords. 
Shcharansky was an important link between the Monitoring 
Group, Jewish dissidents and the 
Western press. 
Last March, the government newspaper Izvestia charged Shcha­ransky with spying for the CIA--a charge denied by President Jimmy Carter and the U.S. State Depart­ment. 
On March 15, 1977, Shcharansky was confronted on a Moscow street, and forced into a waiting car. One month later his mother was informed of his arrest. 
In June, 1977, Shcharansky was formally charged with espionage and treason, charges that carry a minimum sentence often years and a maximum sentence of death by firing squad. 
Shcharansky's trial was originally scheduled for December 15, but 
Brademas deJends need for Congres$ional authority 
[continued from page 3] I carrymg out of poltcy abro~ as well as at home." 
Recent legislation which ac­cording to Brademas, has re­asserted Congress' role in foreign policy, includes the 1973 War Powers Act, rejection by Congress in 1976 of requests for American arms for factions taking part in the Civil War on Angola, and a­mendments to foreign aid legis­lation linking the receipt of U.S. assistance to the protection of human rights. 
"And I am sure the proposed jet 
sales  to  the  Middle  East  will  
provoke  debate  in  the  next  few  
weeks," Brademas added.  

Besides legislation, Brademas said that Congress is reasserting its foreign policy powers in other areas. 
"In 1973, the House Subcom­mittee on International Organ­izations began holding hearings on human rights. It was Congress that brought this issue out,'' he said. 
As the head· of Congressional delegations to Eastern Europe (Russia. Hungary and Yugoslavia) and the People'sRepublic of China, Brademas said he spoke with several heads of states and found "growing recognition by other countries that the president is not the only one in the U.S. involved in foreign affairs." 
Brademas acknowledged that there is criticism of Congressional involvement in foreign affairs. "I see nothing wrong with criticism on substantive matters. However, far too often the criticism is translated i11to criticism of the principle of congressional involvement in for­eign affairs." Brademas noted that former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was a critic of this principle. 
Aside from the power granted by the Constitution, Brademas ex­plained that "the reality of the decentralized party system" de­mands a greater role for the legislative branch in foreign policy. 
•'The lack of party discipline explains the difficulty the president has in dealing with Congress,'' Hrademas stated. 
Unless Congress is informed and involved in foreign policy decisions -_nembers will vote according to their regional or special interests rather than according to their pllrty's position, Brademas ex­
~·lained. 
Hrademas listed other reasons for the assertive role. 
"Members can be most valuable in educating their constituencies. Members can enlighten thP pres­ident's understanding of the ram­ifications. Members can prevent and correct wrong decisions of the executive in foreign affairs. And lastly; if members are consulted. they are more likely to support the oresident,'' he stated. 
During a question and answer sesion which followed, Brademas stated that he applauded Carter's performance thus far, with one major reservation. "I wish he enjoyed politics more," Brademas said. 
"The executive branch must realize that they have to deal with Congress in domestic and foreign affairs. Bargaining and politics make the system operate," he concluded. 
was postponed indefinitely because of the attention the case attracted in the Western press. Shcharansky 
is  presently  being  held  incom­ 
municado  at  Moscow's  Lefortovo  
Prison.  

Mrs. Shcharansky, herself a mem­ber of the Monitoring Group, was not in the Soviet Union at the time of her husband's arrest. She was forced to emmigrate to Israel in 1974 after Soviet authorities refus­ed to reissue her expiring exit visa. 
Although it was her understand­ing that her husband would be able to join her within six months, Shcharansky was refused a visa. 
Since her husband's arrest, Mrs. Shcharansky has been travelling in the U.S. and Western Europe trying to raise support for her husband and the dissident cause. 
She has appealed to both U.N. Secretary General Kurt Waldheim and Vice-President Walter Mon­dale. 
Several groups have taken up the Shcharansky case. Deans of -72 American law schools have signed a resolution protesting the handl­ing of the Shcharansky case and the National Academy of Science has called Party Chairman Leonid I. Brezhnev to express their concern. In addition, U.S. publishers have protested, and a committee for the release of Scharansky has been formed in New York with Sen.

Irish leers face Duluth 
by Ted Robinson Sports Writer 

In a series that will carry a great deal of importance in determining playoff possibilities, the Notre Dame hockey team closes out its home season by hosting Min­nesota-Duluth tonight and tomor­row night at the ACC. 
Although the Irish are presently sixth in the WCHA and the Bulldogs are eighth, only two points separate the teams. In fact, only four points separate fifth-place Colorado College from ninth-place North Dakota. 
However. Notre Dame has one advantage in that they have two games in hand on all the league teams with the exception of North Dakota. Also, the Irish will play six of th~::tr final eight games against teams below them in the standings. 
This wcekeud's series with Du­luth carries extra importance for the Irish because a sweep would virtually guarantee Notre Dame a playoff berth. as the top eight 
teams  in  the  ten-team  league  
4ualify for  the post-season  tourn­ 
ament.  

This weekend will also be par­ents-alumni weekend for the Irish hockey players. Nine Notre Dame seniors will be playing their final games at the ACC. and the parents of the entire team along with about 20 former Irish players will be in attendance for the series. 
Although the Irish are coming off an excellent weekend of hockey against Michgan Tech, they will be meeting a hot team in Duluth. The Bulldogs arc coming off a sweep of michigan at Duluth last weekend by scores of 8-7 and 6-1 which moved them into eighth place in the standings. 
Coach Gus Hendrickson, in his third year at the helm of the Bulldogs. is starting to reap the benefits of good recruiting. His top recruit from last year, sophomore center Dan Lempe from Grand Rapids. Minn., tore up the league as a freshman. 
Lempe was voted the league's outstanding freshman by the play­ers and was named to the Denver Post WCHA All-Star Second Team. 
He set Duluth's single season scoring mark and finished seventh in the league in scoring. 
Lempe has not scored as many points this year (32 points. ranking third on the team), but his right wing. John Rothstein. has become the third-leading goal scorer in the league with 22. Bruce Olson. a converted center. will be the left wing on Duluth's most productive unit. 
Notre Dame Coach Lefty Smith is planning to use the Geoff Collier­Steve Schneider-Greg Meredith line against Lempe's line for the majority of the weekend. The entire line has played well over the last month. and Collier has tallied four goals in the last three games. 
Duluth also has the league's highest scoring dcfensemen in Curt Giles and one of the league's hottest goalies in Rick Heinz. Giles. the team captain, ranks twelfth in the league in scoring with 39 points and had a hat trick in the Michigan series last weekend. Heinz. who often times plays witt

He doesn't do his coaching in a kelly green jacket or even wear a 
Stetson cowboy hat. His style is more low key, a pink cardigan sweater 
or a conservative grey business suit. Lefty Smith may not be as 
flamboyant as some. but his coaching methods and personality speak 
for themselves and this year has been emblematic of his abilities. 
To see Smith stomping behind the bench during a hockey game, 
making observations into his pocket tape recorder or even pointing out 
a mistake or two that the referees have made doesn't give an indication 
of the real Lefty Smith. It takes a little time to get to the bottom of the 
coach; you have to see him spreading the selling points of hockey at 
Blueline Luncheons around the WCHA, representing Notre Dame 
while traveling with the club on the buses and airplanes, and most of 
all watch a practice some afternoon when Smith is at his best. 
Practice brings out the good natured side of Smith more than any time. The remarks and wise cracks fly at a steady pace and no one player escapes the verbal barrage of the former blueliner. "Back in the days when defensemen were tough," often starts the tales at practice. "Good job, Kevin, not many people could have missed the net from three feet ... Greg, center is a thinking man's position, can you handle it... Peterson. don't be so dramatic on those saves...Boy. with all those spins and moves you can tell you've been playing with Jackson, Danny.... One more whirl and you'll set the record...Bobby. we South St. Paul boys always knew you West Side guys were tough...." 
And then there comes the tirne when someone gets shaken-up in a workout. That's when Lefty tosses the player a silver bullet to bite on and jokes, "Dear Mom, I'll be home in the morning. They're playing with live ammunition." 
The hockey season is the longest schedule of the year in collegiate sports. Skaters start preseason conditioning in mid-September and live hockey for the next six months. The travel takes up a lot of time too. and the trips aren't always scheduled for the garden spots of the world. Houghton and Grand Forks seem to be neglected by most travel agents. Getting there is half the fun. 
Somehow Smith keeps his team in good spirits throughout the long season of competition. He builds high morale and character as he does his coaching and that's just as important to Lefty as being ahead in the contest at the end of 60 minutes. Developing a comraderie is important to the overall success of a team and it was evidenced at the outset of this season. 
Starting with a young team that was inexperienced at several skill positions, Smith predicted "the team would get better every weekend and be a formidable opponent wid: continued improvement." After dropping eight in a row at the outset of the campaign it appeared to many that it was to be a dismal year for Smith after achieving so much success last year. But Smith knew better and so did the skaters. 

no support in front of him, has the league's eleventh-best goals a­gainst average at 4. 73, but also has a respectable .883 saves percen­tage. Two weekends ago, Heinz was forced to make 99 saves in a yeoman performance. 
But the Irish can counter with two hot goalies in their own duo of Len Moher and John Peterson. Peterson, who has won three consecutive outings. is eighth in the league with a 4.17 GA while Moher is ninth with a 4.67 GA. It is likely that Smith will continue his alternating system this weekend with Moher playing Friday and Peterson Saturday. 
The other Irish combination will remain the same with Brian Burke centering for Terry Fairholm and Kevin Nugent, Rom Michalek be­tween Bob Baumgartner and Kevin Humphreys and Tom Farrell be­tweP·: John Friedmann and Kevin Nagurski. On defense. it will be Don Jackson with Don Lucia, Dick Howe with Jeff Brownschidle and Dan Byers with Scott Cameron. 
With six road games closing out the season. Smith views this week­end's series as extremely impor­tant for his team's playoff hopes. 
·'Anytime we play a team below us in the standings. the games become more important.'' Smith noted. "These games against Duluth will each be four-point games. And I'm sure they've improved. just as we have. since Notre Dame sophomore Rich Branning scored 14 points and dealt 7 our first meeting last October."

The team was snake-bitten. none of the breaks went their. way. But they never gave up or threw in the towel. They travelel. to Den~er for their seventh and eighth games of the year and were sttll fightmg. f?r their first win on Saturday night when they were down 7-1. Co-captam Terry Fairholm got a goal with less than four minutes left to give the Irish their second score of the night. It was this type of attitude that keyed the turn-around. Now that the Irish have won 10 and tied one in their last IS WCHA games the complection of the season has changed radically and you have to give Sm;th a great deal of credit. 
Oh, don't tell Lefty that he's done a great job to turn around the season. he'll just say it is a "credit to the kids and their character," that they have worked hard and never given up. True, the team is made up of some of the hardest workers in the WCHA that may give away an advantage in talent to another club. but as for hustle, pride and determination the Irish lead the league. Lefty doesn't look down the bench and see Dave DeBol. Kip Maurer or Dan Lerg, a few of the Michigan stars who were supposed to lead Dan Farrell's NCAA runner-up to the championship this year. Instead he sees Terry Fairholm, Geoff Collier, Dick Howe, Tom Michalek, Len Moher and John Peterson to name just a few of the scrappers; a group that has carried Notre Dame past Michigan as the Wolves dropped 13 of their last 14 league games. 
There must be something to this Smith character from St. Paul. After all, the WCHA coaches picked Notre Dame for an eighth place finish. They should be able to evaluate the teams on a basis of talent in an objective manner. But then again, Smith says that coaches are only old defensemen who got hit in the head with a puck too many times. Why else would anyone want to be a coach. 
Coaching seems to be a lot of factors all rolled into one: strategy, psychology, recognizing abilities and adapting to changing situations. This season one would have to say that Smith combined all of these factors and brought his club out of the cellar and into sixth place, a mere point from fifth with two games in hand. He's doing it with quite a smorgasbord of personalities; with three goalies, two who are pre-meds, one with a 4.0 GPA. and another who is a surefire politician. And then there are the forwards, one's an engineer with a shot at a Rhodes Scholarship, and four of five sophomores boast 3.S GPA's or better. One or two could host the Gong Show while a few others are cut in the business mold. 
Looking at the whole picture I'd have to say that Lefty Smith must be a pretty good coach, behind the bench or off the ice with his hockey family. You could never tell him this, he'd credit his skaters with the accolades. Maybe I could wear a pink sweater this Saturday as sort of a salute.
