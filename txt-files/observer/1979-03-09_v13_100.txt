McMurtry addresses crowd mostly about movie making 
by Andy Segovia StaffReporter 
Larry McMurtry, noted novelist and screenplay writer, addressed a near capacity crowd last night in the Library Auditorium as the Sophomore Literary Festival c.ontinued. 
"I am going to talk primarily about movie making," McMurtry began. "Movie making involves a large complex industry, elaborate technology, and interesting people.'' 
"Novel writing docs not incorporate thts," he quipped. 
McMurtry contended that he felt uncomfortable speaking about his own novel writing. "I have no elaborate theory of an," he said. 
He feels it is analogous to the athlete analyzing his own performance after the game. ''Any explanation must be taken with a grain of salt since the actions involved trained reflexes and experience," he stated. 
According to McMurtryone of the more interesting aspects of the movie industry is the "star system" in which film projects are financed on the names of established box office stars. He explained many potentially good films are never made since the screenplays lack dominant roles which can be filled by big name stars. 
The filming of "Hud," based on McMurtry's novel Horseman Pass By, was not able to be financed until the character of a minor character was expanded in order to make the role attractive to Paul Newman. 
The crowd burst into lau~hter several times as McMurtry recounted amusing incidents mvolved in the filming of "Hud." One concerned the two-day effort, at a cost of $90,000 a day, in obtaining a scene of a-couple of buzzards flying off a limb. 
McMurtry pointed out that because the movie was made in 1961, there was a si"gnificant amount of careless spending. "Such carelessness can no longer be afforded in current film making,'' he 
stated.

by Tom Jackman Senior StaffReporter 
Two r~n-offs ~on~luded this year's class elections, with the Tom 
~e~ney ucket wm_ntng _narrowly over the Mark Kelley ticket in the 
JUOlor class prestdenual race, and the Steve Bruemmer ticket 
defeatin_g the Chip Gerhardt ticke~ in the sophomre class run-off. 
The semor class officers were dectded on Tuesday, when the Nick 
Schneeman ticket downed the Mark Carney ticket. 
Of_ 987 _votes c~st, the ticket of Behney (president), Kevin 
L?ve)oy (":tee prestdent), Jean Men~ni (secretary) and Mary Pat 
Z10lko_wsk1 (treasurer) wo'? by a margm ot60--519 to 459, with nine 
wnre-m ":ore~, over rhe ticket of Mark Kelley, Michael MeSally, 
Ann Mane Pterson and Mike Onufrak. The Behney ticket rolled 
52.6 percent of the vote, toKelley's47.5 percent. 
Victo~ious p,resident~al candidate fom Behney congratulated the Kelley ucket for runmng such an excellent campaign," and noted that Kelley narrowed down the margin between the two by over 90 votes from the first election on Tuesday. Behney listed his goals for next year as ''greater participation by members of the class a lot more informal activities," and also to "make sure that thin'gs don't slack off between October and April next year." 
The freshman class turned out with 1035 votes for the race b~tween the "A~CD" ti~ket of Steve Bruemmer (president), Ttmorhy Dages (vtce prestdent), Karen Alig (secretary), Missy Conboy (treasurer) and the "Shout" ticket of Chip Gerhardt, Tim Sweeney, Tara Kenney and Terry Dunn. Bruemmer won by a total of 574 to ~4o.• or 55.4 percent to 42.6 percent, with 2 percent of the 
votes wnte-ms. 
Sophomore president-elect Bruemmer said last night "We're go_ing t~ do_ our work--we're going to do what the class ne~ds.'' ·He satd thts mcludes ''increasing social activities, publishin~ an· overseas newsletter (for sophomores abroad),'' and circulatmg a survey "to find out what people want us to do." 
Steering Committee met and 
named Hamel as a second 
candidate for the position of 
director. The second nominat· 
ion was made necessary be­
cause of the Board of Commis­
sioner:s fa,iJure. t? approv~ the 
committee s ortgtnal nommat­
ion of Tim Coughlin for SU 
director on Wednesday night. 
"The Board felt that Tom's 
exl_>erience, organizational 
abtlity and leadership will en­
able him to be a successful 
Student Union director," Andy 
McKenna, Student Body presi­
dent and member of the board, 
stated. 
The Student Government 
Constitution requires that the 
SU Steering Committee nom­
inate the SU director and this 
nominee be approved by the 
Board ofCommissioners. 
McKenna said, ''The pur­pose of this provision is to tnsure that the perspectives of all branchesof Student Govern· ment and the students they repre~enr are we!~hed in the selectton process. 
The controversial decision was clouded by the refusal of board members to directly com­!Uent on the evening's proceed­mgs. 
Bill Roche. director of Stu­dent Union, stated, ''Before the meeting started, I made an agreement to stand by the board's decision and to keep silent about the proceedings. However, the issue is very confused and many people want exphmations. I regret that earlier decision, but I feel ethically bound to stand by it." 
''There are number of quest­
ions, specifically dealing with 
the constitution which have to 
be answered," he added. 
''As representatives of the 
student body, as a whole, we 
had to weigh the opinions of the 
Steerin~ Committee very 
heavily, 'Beau Mason, Student 
Government Treasurer and a 
member of the Board, explain­
ed.' 'But we had to take other 
considerations into mind be­
sides the Steering Committees' 
views," he added. 
John Bonacci, SU social commissioner and member of the SU Steering Committee, stated, ''The decision by the Board of Commissioners was based on a complete lack of knowledge of the nominees. The Board did not even inter­view the candidates. I think that their decision was one of ignorance. ' ' 
Hamel, a junior Arts and Letters student, has served as chairman of the Student Union Book Exchanges. Hamel is currently serving as the pro­grams coordinator of Ombuds­man office and is a member of the Obud Steering Committee. Last year, he acted as the director of Personnel for Obud. 
"Bill (Roche) has done a good job this year. I would like to maintain the same level of quality in the Student Union," Hamel said. "My first goal would be to get further ac­quainted with Student Union. I would just like to interview and choose candidates for commis­

According to McMurtry the 
"star system" eroded moment­
arily due to the J?henominal 
success of Easy Rtder which 
made over $45 after costing 
only $1 million. 
He stated that the movie 
signaled a brief period where 
the ''star system'' was not 
dominate and thus movies such 
as ''The Last Picture Show'' 
(for which McMurtrywrote the 
screenplay) were able to be 
made. [continued on page2_1

OnAprilll, 1978Jane Byrne declared her intentton to chal­lenge incumbent Michael A. Bilandic for the mayoral seat in the city of Chicago. From that day on, her daughter Kathy, a Samt Mary's senior govern­ment major, has had to budget her time between her busy academic and political carreers.

(AP)--Day after day, the months go by and the seven Russian Christians remain crowded in a single 12-by-15­foot room in American hands, virtually isolated, some sleep· ing on the floor, waiting for a way out, their hopes at times dimmed by despair. 
This tiny, dedicated band of believers; after years of fo.rced family sepa~atio~s r harass­ments and unpnsorunents, eight months ago sought help at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. It granted asylum but that itself

permits for them to emigrate to the U.S. He says the U.S. hasn't pressed for it despite the offer of a Presbyterian Church in Selma, AI., to sponsor the group. 
A Czech-born former OSS man with U.S. forces in World War II , Hruby has a network of confidential sources supplying documentation from the SoViet sphere, published in the monthly Religion in Communist Dominated Areas, which he edits. 
He and various Christian groups, including the National Council of Churches, have urged President Carter to inter· vene on behalf of the embassy refugees. Their circumstances ''are contrary to Carter's own human rights policies including the right to emtgrate," Hruby says. 
· "But the embassy seems more embarassed by their presence than concerned. They're being treated as ex­pendable in the name of so­called 'broader' diP.lomacy. But these are specific human

The little group is among about 500 Pentecostals in the Soviet Union that for l7 years have sought permission to emi~rate to the U.S., enduring parttcular persecution because they're outside Soviet-author­ized churches. 
Over the years, many have gone to prisons or labor camps for holding meetin~ or defying atheist schooling of children. Peter Vashchenko and his wife both have suffered arrests and imprisonments. 
Although they're barred from receiving mail, Hruby has issued the latest brief note received from them, saying in part: 
"Please write letters ... to So­viet authorities, Brezhnev , President Carter and . . . pray for us to the Lord that he enable us to emigrate and that he soften the hearts of the Soviet authorities as in the past he had softened the heart of pharaoh and gave freedom to his nation."

Vietnam has said it would be prepared to negotiate when a total withdrawal of Chinese troops took place. 
Japan said yesterday it was acting as a mediator in the China-Vietnam war. 
As the columns of returning military trucks passed through the ctty of Pinxiang (Pm Hsiang), firecrackers exploded and the ancient city resounded with the beating of drums and gongs, and cheers of~e wel­comtng crowds , Xinhua said. 
Vietnamese artillery forces entrenched on a mountaintop shelled Chinese troops with­drawing northward Tuesday morning toward the Dong Dang area near Lang Son, and the Chinese struck back, it said.

SMC 's faculty questions rank and tenure proposals 
by Pam Degnan 

The validity of two Rank and Tenure Committee proposals was questioned at the Saint Mary's Faculty Assembly yesterday afternoon. 
The first proposal requested that the College president release to the faculty the percentage of promotion and tenure cases which have been denied by the commtttee during the last five years. 
The motion was passed by a 32-11 majority vote. 
The second proposal, however, was postponed for discussion until John Duggan, College president, presents his report next montfi on the previous tenure cases to the assembly. The proposal discussed the issue of confidentiality of cases investigated by the Rank and Tenure Committee. 
The committee consists of three elected commtsstoners, the 
Dean of Faculty and an administrator appointed by Duggan. The 
purpose of the committee is to review and evaluate perspective

At the palace, the American president and Sadat a.Ppeared on the balcony with their wives. 
Carter said he and Sadat pled~ed themselves not to dis­a.Ppomt those who hope for ' the long-unrealized but deei?­ly desired state of peace to this region." 
After the arrival statement, Carter met with Sadat to review the U.S. suggestions for break­in~ the stalemate in the negoti­auons. They were accompanied by their advisers. 
Carter, after a 12-hour flight from the United States, said at the palace that he was struck by the eyes ofthe Egyptian women which held ''a hunger and a prayer that their sons and their husbands would never again have to suffer in the cause of 
combat.'' 
The long journey by the American president is being viewed by Egyptian and Israeli leaders as reviving prospects for a peace treaty that has so eluded the region. 
Both Khalil and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin have said that Carter's trip could lead to a treaty signing. 
However, several difficulues remain, and Sadat addressed one of them at the palace; the issue of the 1. 1 million Pales­tinians who live in Israeli-occupied terrjtories on the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
"We are determined," Sadat 
said, ''to enable our Palestinian brothers to realize their nation­al rights and regain their free­dom." 
Sadat has insisted on a timetable for the civil autonomy for Palestinians that Begin has promised. Begin, in turn, has opposed linking the Palestinian 
problem to the treaty. A reported compromise would set a target date for implementing autonomy, but no hard dead­line. 
Sadat's remarks may have been intended to reassure other Arab countries that he is pro­tecting the Palestinian cause. · 
The Israeli Cabinet accepted the U.S. proposals earlier this week. Khalif said the Egyptian Cabinet had prepared its coun­terproposals to discuss with the American parry. 
''There will be a few changes," said Khalil before Carter arrived. 
Khalil said that the U.S. proposals were' 'negotiable and can be modified according to our ideas." His comments were the first indication that the suggestions were not entirely sausfactory to the Egyptians. 
Carter will remain In Egypt until Saturday night, when _he flies to Israel for consultation 

-with Begin. There is the possibility that if an agreement IS solidified Vance or another 
U.S. mediator will remain in the region to wrap it up. 


formation" about Crane's per­
sonal life. 
The request came in re­
sponse to a derogatory article 
published Wednesday by the 
Manchester Union Leader, the 
politically conservative news­
paper p~blished in the state's 
largest city. 
The page 1 story centered on allegations about Crane's drinking habits and sex life ­quoting unidentified sources as sayinr, the Illinois Republican was 'too /ood looking" and "once tol a friend he was committed to beddin~ down 
1,000 different women. ' 
In a letter to Reagan, Crane, 48, called the report "grossly untrue." He wrote: "I appeal to your sense of decency and justice and urge you to investi­gate your staff to find the person or persons involved and dismiss them. Such action on your part will show that in 1980 politics such behavior by campaign operatives will not be tolerated.'' 
Reagan said in a .statement that he had "informed Con­gressman Crane that none of 
my staff was in any way responsible for the articles.'' He said that if Crane has evidence of involvement by any 
Reagan  staffer,  ''it  was  his  
responsibility  to  get it  to  me  
personally.''  

Crane, a candidate in New Hampshire's first-m·the-nation presidential primary, was here to address the House of Repre­sentatives. 
The 400-member House ·unanimously passed a resolu­tion apologizing for the "totally unsubstantiated allegations a­mounting to a grossly unfair and vituperative personal at­tack" on Crane. 
The newspaper article quoted a number of unidentified sour­ces, listed only as Crane's former and present associates. 
Beneath the report, the news paper carried an editorial back­mg Reagan for president in 1980. 
Paul Tracy, editor-in-chief of the Union Leader, said "we stand by our story" and "we couldn't care less, " about the House apology.

Two Ancient CSC's tell us flow to Live and Die 
[The Brother who lives on campus at Columba Hall, is Brother Brendan Luby, CSC and the Brother who lives at tne shores of the St. joe River is 
!!_rother Finbarr Buckley, CSC.] 
Dorothy Day sat one torrid afternoon 
in New York, as I asked, inobtrusively, 
answering the insistent query of a rash 
young stalwart, HOW DOES IT FEEL 
TO BE THAT OLD? That churlish 
question runs through my mind every 
time I talk with, nay befriend, two 
nonagenarian Brothers of Holy Cross, 
more or less unnamed now, for their 
own reasons. Each is 92; each has 
been a Brother for sixty-two of those 
years. One lives on the campus side of 
Highway 31; one on the other, on the 
shores of St. ] oe River at Dujarie 
House. 
"And how does it feel. .. ? " I 
conjecture, but never ask. But they 
tell; embarassingly they tell all, in 
fact. The Brother at the river says, he 
waits ... and waits. If that were all, it 
would be ghastly! But he reads and 
thinks and moves as much as his 
decrepitude will allow. He reads every 
single copy ofThe OBSERVER which I 
bring from Notre Dame, no mean· 
achievement, with only one good eye, 
which he has. But he thinks, not of 
then, what it was like, and how horrid 
times are now (he knows for reading 
the two local TRIBUNES how times 
are) but what it's all about, this 
Thanatology thing, Death and Dying, 
and we talk about it. Not all the time, 
you understand, but the Brother who 
lives near the river gets his point in. 
How he will be happy to die, how he is 
happy to be alive, but then, oh, there 
is that expectation--of that Eternal Life 
after life. He can wax profound, 
having the native gift of the Irish, and 
uses all the eloquence at his command. 
Naturally, or sometimes I think 
supernaturally, he does not go into 
detail about his vision of Death. He 
could I am sure. He has been clinically 
dead, once on an occasion, went blank, 
and of course, does not recall any of 
''what went on.'' But he knows that 
this is the way he wants to go, and he 
talks of his dying this way. 
And all of this is interspersed with 
talk-of-life. Not life after but life on 
this planet. The Brother who lives on 
campus, at Columba Hall, speaks 
glowingly of life, the one he has had 
for these nine decades, ftrst in Ireland, 
as with the Brother who lives near the 
river, and then, in En~land and 
various places, and ftnally m America 
as a Brother of HolyCross. After years spent laboring "in the vineyard" selling the now-defunct-Ave Maria magazine, as a f.refect at Notre Dame, inBrownsonHal, not the Main Build­ing, he worked, and he works. Today he has another career, mending and tailoring other peoples' clothes--all without use of eye glasses. 

And so he works on--and he waits for the Light. He knows and feels that he is more vulnerable, in fact brittle now, as he has fallen recently, and does of course not wish to fall again. So he is careful. Careful with everything but his time, which he devoted to praying with the commun­ity at .Columba Hall, in office and at Mass, but otherwise he is an "activ­ist. '' His work of tailoring, one is told by others, is meticulous and carefuL 
He is careful in all but how he SJ;>ends the.se "twilight" years, and history could record one day, that he is carefree of his time. To the back­ground of music aired from the Notre Dame FM station, or the "other" one from Berrien Springs, at Andrews 
1University, he works against the day--and even the night. Brother sleeps when he is tired, perhaps in ftts and starts, and worries not a whit about the eight hours required for the human animal. The light in his room might be burning at any hour of day or night, and he works while there is light, to be sure. ­
As with us all, Brother would have ''it'' come fast. If death is the ftnal obscenity, he would be happily dis­patched from it, without the ensuing agonies. But he remains OJ;>en. Most of his contemporaries, fnends and family, are gone, and he has only the family of Holy Cross to succor him now. But he finds that family quite satisfactory, if you mind. The unmen­tionable Death is not a stranger co him, and, as with the remainder of us he fears the dying, but not the Dead{. 
So his will be the death of the just. But this is hardly the source, or preoccupation, of our Tuesday after­noon conversations; rather we speak of life, and more particularly, of travel. Ever the picaresques, we share our places and locations we have been, our trips. He loves to travel the QE2 (Queen Elizabeth) from New York to Southampton, and I prefer the jet-set mode. But we palaver and speak of Du Dublin, Limerick, the Liffey River, and I get the feeling that I am Irish too--only a half-truth.

He 1s roughly contemporary with J a~es Joyce, and they both attended the same Jesuit school, not together but within a few years of each other perhaps, and we speak glowingly of the environs of Dublin, or taking the boat train, and of how life appears to us, in various quarters of London. If travelling to England sounds like high treason too "old Sod' types, so be it. We revel in the sounds and sights of Londontown, although I am for "bed and breakfast'' in Argyle Square­King' s Cross-St. Pancras, and he stays at die Barclay Hotel, of Picadilly. 
We speak in the present tense, no 
mean task, when sentimental remini­scence tends to flower over one's recollections. And we talk as if we would be treading the gangplank of the QE2 in short order, about to embark on yet another journey, as we even halfI Irish know is a part of the heritage. And we hardly ever dwell on the history of Notre Dame, which he knows so well, but keeps mum on. We drink large amounts of tea and/or coffee, aJ:?.d practice the high art of conversation. 
And the Grim Reaper is hardly the 
source of the kind of presiflage which 
we practice. But he is there, or course. 
What we do, of course, somewhere

and places, and of tailoring, is talk of 
life and --Death. It is, to be sure, a

which places me at his feet, to learn,

And now he reads, perhaps more carefully, but he reads mor·e than before. And he understands. 
The wanderlust has never been a part of his makeup, but he has sought and found life in the printed word. He is firmly convinced that " ... there are just no~ enough hours in the day ... " and he 1s never bored. His enrichment is constant, ongoing, and although he

does not tell me this, I know. As with most Notre Dame fans, he is "up" when the team is up, and .down when the team is down. But he is never so far down as all that, for there is the rest of world, which he views through high-powered spectacles, to be sure, but he is viewing, and not just seeing all of the time. 
When we talk, it is of the events of the day, what is happening in Chicago and in South Bend, or in the world at large, but he is telling and I am listening. Being an inveterate skeptic, I o~serve, for signs of some malcon­tent attitude, some clue that, as with many of the old, he would regret. But none of that, if you don't mmd. In a younger .person, one mi~ht say, "just a facade' but into the mnth decade of one's life, that seems not likely. 
With Brother, it is a case of going all the way. As a young man in 1reland, he saw what he wanted, crossed an ocean to do it, and has not regretted the move. He delights in a choice of doing what he has wanted to do from an early age, and then sticking with one's choice-till the end. Again, we do not talk of Brother's end-Death­because there is so much else to speak of. We talk of books, of the charismaic movement in South Bend, and a good bit of the time we spend speaking of the climate outside hts room--the snow and the sunlight on it, and a hawk that perches in a tree nearby. It is, after talk ofliving, how Brother does it, how I do it ... how the hawk does it.

Finally, the ancients give up the secret of wisdom that comes with age. And of course, that wisdom is as homely, as earthy, as the planet which they have inhabited, lo, these ninety and some years. They have passed Kubler-Ross' test, the final stag~, of acceptance and moved beyond. While grasping life, they have let go. And leting go, giving over, has freed up their lives and experiences, the better to share their integrity with those whom they touch. To be sure, they are pensive, waiting for the Reward, not being sure what the Reward is. Faith tells them all is well; their Celtic humanity flares up when occasionally they show spleen at their slowness of gait, loss of hearing. But, in the end, those losses are but inconveniences when measured up against the person­hood, the wholeness they have come to. From here on in, and even now, all the rest is just moving on. And they do it with Grace.

Williatn Gaddis-APortraitofHis Work 
Beth Williard 
"What is any artist but the dregs of his work?'' The Recognitions, 1955 
In many ways William Gaddis 

appeared to exemplify this quote from 
h1s first nove., T6e Recognitions, 
when he spoke before a large crowd in 
the Library. Auditorium on Tuesday 
evening. ' Dregs" is often interpreted 
as an uncomplimentary label, but in 
this case it does not have to be so. 
Gaddis seems to be the dregs of his 
work simply in that he is what is left 
over from it, and may be described or 
criticized on the same rounds as his 
work may be. 
Gaddis has published two gargantuan novels, The Recognitions and JR, twenty years apart. The Recognitions has as its main character an unsuccessful painter who turns for~er because he knows he can succeed with in the frameworks developed by other artists. Written in 1955 when realism was a dominant trend in literature, the novel is characterized by great length (956 pages), many plot Intricacies and sub-plots, and surrealistic images. What one critic calls a "pervasive sense ·of damnation and degeneration'' is relieved by some off-beat comedy. Certainly the work was quite different from others produced during that time period. 
The Recognitions received mixed 
reviews; ratings varied from "an underground classic" to "terrible." In the years following, critics' opinions 
of the book gradually became higher 
as it was recognized as a forerunner of 
Black Humor, parody, and self­
parody. The more readers looked for, 
the more they found. 

Many of the devices of The Recognitions were found in Gaddis' monologue for the Sophomore Literary Festival. He spoke for close to an hour and a half on a bewildering variety of topics, sub-plots iffou will. One was not quite sure unti the conclusion of his speech what his main theme was. There was certainly a thread of r.essimism running through his ideas, 1f not quite "pervasive damnation." 
Gaddis related that the rewards one dreamed of receiving, once one was a writer, were not what one wanted after all once the "rewards" were attained. He stated: "We know it will end in failure, so do something worth failingat.'' 
The atmosphere of gloom was dis­pelled by Gaddis' wry humor, however. Many of his Jokes were directed against himself and writers in general as he spoke of his extreme paranoia a~d the insanity of trying to 1mpress h1s own message on total stran~ers who had "never done a thing ' to him. 
In Memory ofSid Vicious 
Browsing through a recent news­paper, I noticed a headline tucked away on pa~e 4. It read ''Heroin Kills Sid Vicious . The ensuing story dealt with the basic facts of the depraved saga that John Simon Ritchie, nee Sid Vicious, called life. I think, however, that this story deserves a little more attention than that which was given it by the newspaper. Why? Because I don't think it was simply hero10 that killed Sid Vicious. 
Sid Vicious first entered the public spodight as a member of the ill-fated Sex Ptstols, band. With lead singer Johnny Rotten and the other Sex Pistols, Vicious attained rapid notori­ety as a leading purveyor of punk rock, a supposed new wave in rock music. The Sex Pistols gained more attention for their antics, 10 and out of concert, than they did for their music. Vomiting on stage, inflicting wounds upon themselves, destroy10g instruments, fighting with fans, using profanity on television, and several other disgust­ing and disconcerting acts became their hallmark. Decadent was not a strong enough word to describe their behavior; it was more aptly referred to as nihilistic. 
As the Sex Pistols gained notoriety in England, the punk scene began to grow 10 the United States. Soon,the Sex Pistols were crossing the Atlantic, promising to incite us in much the same way as they had the young people of England. The Sex Pistols, however, turned out to be more like cap guns in the U.S. and the group broke up shortly ;Jter entering the countrv. 
After a few months of inactivity, Vicious began to live up to his name. On October 12th of last year, he purportedly stabbed his long-time girlfriend, Nancy Spungen, to death. Freed on bail, he was later arrested for assaulting Patti Smith's younger brother, Todd, in a barroom brawl by hitting him in the face with beer mug. Freed again, Vicious took a fatal dose of heroin later that night. This chain of events could easily be chalked up as 'another rock star destroying himself'. But in this case, this generalizaton is unfortunately, and somewhat ironicaJiy, true. If the life of Sid Vicious 1s looked upon in a general, ~ncompassing way, tt is very frighten­mg. 
Punk rock can be thought of as a metaphor of nihilism in the 70's. Nihilism is the denial of any objectivetruths and values. It is die attitude 
Anthony Walton 
that life is senseless and useless, and 
it often employs elements of self-
destruction. -Nihilism is thought of nowadays mostly as a fanactical philo­sophy that died with the Russian Revolution, but consider Sid Vicious as 
a paradigm of this attitude today. 
When a member of our so-called 
civilized society can descend into such 
a depraved state, it is time to take 
notice and try to ascertain the causes. 
The death of Sid Vicious has a very 
interesting possibility. Looking at 
previous periods of nihilistic behavior, 

the common denominator is that they 
have signaled the end of an epoch in 
history. Mayan, Roman, Russian, and 
Chinese histories all give evidence to 
support this. In eadi case a dynasty 
or monarchy was about to fall, giving
lead to a complete revolutionary 
change in that society. When a society
loses its goals, ind1vidual goals are 
also soon lost. No goals equals 
nihilism. A prime example of this 
today is Iran. When there are no 
answers to the questions of life, people 
begin to search for them. Note Jim Jones and Jonestown. A group search for answers and meaning that culmi­nated in self-destruction. 
Can the death of Sid Vicious be 
signalling the end of another epoch in 
Western society? Is there. a break­
down of society and subsequent revo­
lution in sight? Vicious and the other 
punk rockers were part of a social 
uprising in England, (as evidenced byt 
the chaotic situation with the strikes 10 
England lately), and though the atti­
tude of punk was not as prevalent 
here, seeds of discontent are being 
sown. The punk rockers portend this 
brewing tide of angry rebellion in 
England; it will be interestin_g to se if 
this social malaise comes to fruition in 
the next decade. 

The death of Sid Vicious should be a warning signal about the present plight of our society. Sid Vicious, though his life is over, should alarm us to be wary of the insanity inherent in life. He is now a sort of sick martyr for the unhappy young people around the world. I do not mean to paint Sid Vicious as some kind of hero. I do find the story of his life, and the circum­stances surrounding his death, quite depressing. Solutions are hard to come by in bizarre cases like Sid Vicious. For me, to be aware of his absurd life is enough--enough to wonder why he's dead, and why l'm at Notre Dame. 
Twenty years after the publication of The Recognitions, Gadd1s tried once again to impress his views on others 
with the 1975 publication of his novel JR. The story revolves around an 11-year-old boy who gains control of a huge financial empire because no one is effectively in charge of anything. Gaddis uses monologue, dialogue, radio and television broadcasts almost entirely to portray action; there is very little narrative background and description in the 726 page novel. From confusion of language characters and plots emerge. The book has been called a writers' novel, with the ''best'' characters artists who cannot achieve what they wish to be in the noise-and money-activated milieu that people like JR thrive in. Yet they continue to try. · 
The debasement and degeneration of language in ]R serves both as a S}'mptom and a cause of the confusion of values portrayed. ]R himself possesses a certam logic that makes one wonder if his values are not, after all, correct~ His idea of putting advertisement in the midst of textbook pages to cut publication costs might be emphatically applauded by students expected to purchase $35 text books. Indeed, ]R 's cry seems to be ''Why get mad at me because I thought of it first?" 
After sifting through the chaotic mass of impressions generated by Gaddis' address one concludes that the common theme of both his novels and speech is the quest for a secure value system and answer to the questions ''What is worth doing?'' and "What is worth failing at?" Although he does not provide answers he does force the question upon o~e. 
Gaddis said that much of his writing is an attempt to sort out the confused ideas in his mind. His speech appeared to served the same purpose. His presentation inevitably evoked mixed reactions, as do his books. While one person may have thought the Nelter of anecdotes, preaching, and conversational impressions brilliantly witty and valuable, another may have found the monologue deJ;>ressingly long and the value out­weighed by the turmoil with which it was surrounded. 
William Gaddis stressed that a writer should be read, not heard; that there is nothing in the artist that is not in the art. After his witty but close to inchoate monologue of Tuesday evening, one is inclmed to take him at his word and believe that his novels and personal life both are expressions of the same question: "What is worth doing?'' 
Lenten Fast 

GIVE UP 
There is a question being asked by 
virtually everyone on campus these 
days, whipping the populace into a 
furor not often seen so universally in a 
body of fortunetellers. Sightseers fail 
to see the importance of formulating 
an incoherent mass of data into a 
decision worthy of the circular file. 
1 can, though. So can you, 1f only 
you put your neck to the millstone and 
plunge into .the ~entle abyss, never to 
be seen agam, and better for it. Chalk 
it UJ? to experience when someone 
quenes querulously: ''What are you 
giving up for Lent?" Neither rain nor 
sleet nor hail nor fruitcup nor eggplant parmeseannor gloom of night should ever stay you from serious considera­tion in answering. 
I've overhead many a conversation 
in the past week concerning this 
question. They've generally gone 
something like this: 

"What are you giving up for Lent?" 
"None of your beeswax! What are 
you?" 
"I'II tell if you tell! " 

''I double-dare you to tell!'' 
"Okay, we'll tell at the same time. 
1...2 ... 3!"

"Hey! You were supposed to tell!" "I knew you wouldn't, so I didn't! Hmmph!'' "Yeah--see you later--like as to much!" 
Hands clasped, I applaud this exhibition of the true Lenten Psachal spirit. BRAVO! 
Now how should you go about making this all to thirteen-fold de­cision? I'm gonna tell you, so take copious notes soon to join the ranks of files. Bartleby the Scrivener takes great deslight tn scrivening all those whom he considers "idle," so prepare your reply, and be quick about it! Follow my guidelines and Bartleby will be repaid in full, for ar we all know, he who scrivens last scri vens best. 
Well, there are always the old standards to go by. You could give up by putting sugar on your cereal in the morning, or eating desert on ever third Tuesday. You could give up the fat patties at the dining hall (double entendre), or maybe that second helping of collard greens.

But t?e pledge I get the biggest kick ou~ of IS when somebody goes "I'm go10~, to trr, ~IJ be ~ better pers~m this Lent or I m go10g to be mce to peoP.le." This is the ultimate cop-out. Whtle the first group is just plain nebulous, these statements are down­tight heinously nefariously blasphe­m<?us. That's right--if you say you're go10g to be a better person, you're blaspheming. The proof has a whole ~unc~ of steps so I'm not going to go m~o It n~ht now, but just remember thts--don t use this type of statement for your Lenten pledge. It's .insipid too, by the way. 
The next grouf of 'giver-uppers' are what I like to cal the cheaters. Here's a feY' examples of what they' II prom1se: 
''Im going to give up going to class before 10:00 A.M." "lm going to give up losing at poker." 
"1m going to give up Jistenir. ~ to that talk show on WSND on Me .1day nights.'' 
''1m .&oing to give up all responsi­bility for my actions when under foretgn influences.'' 
No, no, no, no, uh-uh; nix-nein­Nagurski. That's not what we're looking for, Notre Darners, you breed of men in many positions. I shudder and quake in uncontrollable sobs when I find ~h~t pressing queston ''What are you glVlng up for Lent?" taken for granted. 
. Wh3:t we're loo!cing for is something hke ~h1s. declarauon which, upon my hear10g It, my heart became feather light, like a lark trilling in his total ecstacy. I skipped home, nary a care felt the desire to share my joy, and danced around in a disgusting 
manner. 

"I vow to strike wine, women and song and your basic human emotions out of my life for the next forty days.'' 
This is what the Church intended! As the number one Catholic University in the country, we should set an example by adhering to these simple 
. guidelines, don't you think?

Letters ToA Lonely God 

The Manhattan Piper 
Reuben was a Village piper who piped his tunes on the streets of Manhattan; or sometimes late at night, in Washington ~quare Park, you could hear songs bemg played .o~ a flute and it would be Reuben stmngalon~, at home with his music, entertaining himself with the sweet· ness of melodies he was just discovering. 
On July and August afte~noons, when I was perched on a stool tn front of the rectory, greeting passers-by on the Avenue of the Americas, Reuben would come along. Standing next to me, he would pipe me a concert that moved from Mozart to Jesus-songs. Tourists would stop to stare. at us, wondering when the sales ettch for salvation was going to begin. The cops would come along and check us out; street crowds made the cops nervous, but they were willin~ to allow a priest the freedom of the stdewalk in front of his own rectory. The Catholics who recognized me would smile a greeting; only a few of them disapproved o.f the cleric who had time to waste wtth a street mustctan. 
Eventually, I would say: ''Reuben, I have to go inside now." . 
He would say: "I haven't eaten stnce yesterday." Or he would say: "I got locked out of my room last night, and I had to sleep in the streets.'' I would search my pockets for the small subsidy of cash I knew h~ wa:s always in need of, and I would ~tve tt to him. In a mood of mutual gratttude,

we would shake hands and separate. On summer days, Reuben made me a patron of the arts; I made him a ward of the church. He would have felt uncomfortable with a more complicated arrangement. 
One afternoon, I waited nearly two hours for Reuben; it was four o'clock when I turned my head to see him standing beside me looking blue. 
''They got my flute,'' he sai~. ''Last night, in the park, I was sleeptng, and they got my flute." I didn',t, hav~. to ask whom he meant by they : Junkies, or winos, or tough kids desperate for money. 
"I drunk a little wine," he said, "and fell asleep. While I was sleeping, they came and got my flute." Reuben was twenty years old. He had grown up in rough neighborhoods. There was nothing I could tell ~im.about the ways in which New York ts a Jungle. He was too street-wise to have been so careless. He had gotten too much into wine that was all, and he had trusted too ~uch that his friends in the park would keep him from being bothered. "What are you going to do?" I said. 
"I've got to look around and find me a flute "he said. "I can't ever make a living ~ithout my flute. I can't even go to sleep at night without my flute. I've got to find me a flute just as pretty as the one I had. Then I got to find me some money and go and buy it." 
"Reuben," I said, "I've got a little money, if it will help." "You got money," he said, "but you ain't got enough money to buy me a

After that, I didn't see him for awhile. J missed his coming by. Without Reuben, I was just a fat man whose backside overflowed the stool he sat on. The tourists didn't stop. The cops didn't check me out. The Catholics who thought I should be writin~ s~:rmons instead of peo~le­watchtng walked on the oppostte stde of the pavement. 
Once Reuben rang the doorbell and asked to see me. He wanted me to know he had found the flute worthy of his piping. "The money," he said, "I haven't got the money, and I can't find a job that will afford me that flute, and I can't even pipe fo~ pennies .on the sidewalk.'' He hadn t been eattn~, he said, and he hadn't been sleeptng. ''All I ever had to call my own was my music. I didn't have no radios, and I never had no family. It was like me and music decided to be each other's family." He would have stolen the flute he had fallen in love with, he said but the cops would know right 
' away who· took it.. He was ju~t afraid he would die wxthout musxc. He thought that maybe without music he had already died, and the city had forgotten to bury him.

essential needs that can be paid for with money, and I was sure I could afford the price of a flute ·· when he showed up one afternoon, pale and thin, with his l~ps firmly set on the mouthpiece of hts new ptpe. 
Thatafternoon, Reuben flayed me songs I had never hear before. Tourists stopped, cops checked us out, and the Catholics who disapproved went home to write letters to the Chancery. The tunes were lovely, but they did not strike me as happy, not as happy as the songs I would h.ave expected from a piper who has JUSt found his pipe again. "Pe~haps,". I thought, "suffering makes hun play 10 a minor key.'' . 
Afterwards, when I talked with hut?-, I discovered the reason for hts melancholy. . 
"Reuben," I said, "where did you get the money. ? " "A man gave it to me," he said. "He bought me my flute." "That's nice isn't it, Reuben," I said "that a m~n bought you a fl~ne?"
"i had to have it," he said, "tt means more to me than a girl.'' There were words that he was hesitiating to say that were like a wall between us,. "I'm living with the man," he satd finally. "He told me he w.ould buy me my flute if I lived with him. I !lever lived with a man before, but thts old guy told me ifI would live with him, he would pay for my flute." .

In protest march 
Iranian"WOtnen demand rights 
(AP) Chanting "at the dawn of freedom we have no free­dom," more than 8,000 Iranian women, defiantly dressed in Western clothing, paraded through Tehran on Internation­al Women's Day yesterday to demand preservauon of their rig~ts under the new Islamic regtme. Some tried to enter the offices of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazar­gan but were dispersed when guards fired over their heads. 
Thousands ofwomen in other countries paraded or held meet­ings to mark the day set aside by the United Nations to im­prove the rights of women around the world. 
In Rome about 10,000 wo­men, man} carrying signs, marched. One sign read: "March 8, Women's Day, and the other days?" In Milan, groups ofwomen encircled men and danced around them. The Union of Italian Women an­nounced it would form a tribun­al ~o "try" cases of abuse agamst women. 
Also in Rome, a group called ''Feminist Counter-power'' claimed responsibility, in a leaflet found in a phone booth, for recent bombing attacks on the offices of two gynecologists and an electrical appliance plant which, the leaflet claim­ed, employed "proletariat wo­men for sub-standard wa~es." The bombings caused no mjur­tes. 
The Iranian demonstration followed a rally at Tehran University. Marchers were harassed by groups of young men and by one group of women dressed in chadurs, head-to-toe Islamic veils worn by many Iranian women. 
During Iran's revolution many women adopted the cha-

Notre Dame's senior dean was praised for his long service by Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh, 
C. S.C., University president. "Dean W aidman is a fine administrator who has ably accomplished our goal to strengthen science education at the University. As an estab­lished scientist in his own right, he has encouraged excellence in research while maintaining 
our  commitment.  to  excellent  
teaching."  
During his  tenure  as  dean,  

Waldman implemented plans for developing the College of Science, an effort supported by a $5.6 million grant from the National Science Foundation. He also oversaw physical

Department  of  Chemical  
Engineering,  it  has  been  
announced  by  Timothy  

O'Meara, provost of the University. 
Schmitz, a member of the Illinois faculty since 1962, will assume the chairmanship of the Department of Chemical Engineering, succeeding Dr. Jultus T. Bancharo who is retiring. 
Judo Club

"We are deeply indebted to Professor Banchero for his leadership during the 20 years he has headed the Department of Chemical Engineering, the longest tenure of any currently acttve chairmen,'' commented O'Meara. 
Schmitz did his under­graduate work at Illinois and received his Ph.D. in 1962 from the University of Minnesota. He received a Guggenheim fellowship in 1968-69, and the following year his publications in the dynamics and control of chemically reacting systems 
won  the  Allan  P.  Colburn  
Award  of  the  American

To honor Dean Waldman, Science Advisory Council mem­bers, many of hts former Ph.D. students, and friends will join members of the Universit>r com­munity to celebra~e a "Waldman Festival" on Friday, March 2. The obser­vance will highlight the dean's career in nuclear physics. 
W aidman  was  on  of  the  
scientists  who  aided  in  the  
development  of  the  atomic  

bomb and one of four U.S. scientists who witnessed from a~ airp!ane the 1945 bombing of Htroshtma, Japan. 
At the banquet Friday evening, Dr. Heinz H. Barshall of the University of Wisconsin, one of W aidman's colleagues on the government's Man­hattan Project, will talk about his "Reminiscences of the Early Days of Fission,'' illus­trating his remarks with slides of the work at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory and devel­opment of the bomb. 
A native of New York City, Waldman received his doctor­ate from New York University in 1939, a year after he joined the Notre Dame faculty as a research associate. The Notre Dame laboratories he directed with physics professor George 
B. Collins were the first to show that nuclei can be disintegrated with high speed electrons.

Congress denies security threat 
WASHINGTON (AP)-The Sen­ate yesterday narrowly rejected a move by conservative oppo­nents of President Carter's China policies to declare that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would threaten the securilty interests of the United States. 
With Vice President Walter 
F. Mondale on hand, the Senate defeated 50-42 a proposal de­claring a military threat against Taiwan would be a threat "to the security interests" of the United States. 
For more than an hour and a half, the president was on d1e brink of a stunning foreign policy defeat. 
By an earlier 49-45 vote, dte Senate had refused to set aside a tough Taiwan security amend­ment proposed by Sen. Charles Percy, R-Ill. 
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd succeeded, how­ever, in changing enough votes to reverse the outcome, allow­ing Carter to escape what would have been a major confessional setback. 
Acting on a similar China Bi~l, the House approved by voice vote an amendment pled­gin~ that the United Stat1::s "w1ll maintain its capacity to resist" the use of Chinese force against Taiwan. But House members later turned down, 221-149, a orooosalpledg!_ng that the United States would "act to ~eet the danger'' if Peking should attack Taiwan. 
Mondale, present in his role as Pr~sident of the Senate, would .have voted to break any tie in Carter's favor. 
Moments 1:-efore the ftrst vote, Sen. Frank Church, D­Idaho, ·chairman of the Senate Forei~n Relat_ons Committe1e, said 1f the Senate approved a Taiwan security bill that vio­lated agreements with Peking, the president "has only one recourse, and that is to veto the 

bill. .. Earlier, in a letter to other senators, Percy said wording on Taiwans security approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was too weak. The committee approved a bill say­ing a move by China against Truwan would be "of grave concern" to the United States. 
Meanwhile, Carter admin­istration sources said the Chinese have let it be known 
thFv are disturbed even by the wea..·er language approved by the co.'llllittee. 
Chine.oe Ambassador Chai Zemin personally advised Sec­retary of State Cyrus Vance of his government's, displeasure. 
The most intensive opposi­tion ofCarter's China policy has originated with Senate conser­vatives ButPercyis counted as a moderate Republican and as a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee was con­sidered likely to sway middle­of-the-road senators from both parties. 
Carter announced last De­cember 15 that the United States would reco~nize China and drop diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The measure under debate in Congress would set up an informal arrangement for continuing commercial and cul­tural ties with Taiwan. 
At the same time, Carter said the United States would termi­nate with a year's notice, the 27-year old mutual defense treaty with Taiwan. 
Ryan announces gift 
A gift of $50,000 . to the College of Business Admini­stration at Notre Dame by the partners and staff of Alexander Grant & Company, a ftrm of certified public accountants, has been announced by Brother Leo V. Ryan, dean, and Frank 
S. Covaro, principal and nation­al director of Personnel Devel­opment for the firm. 
The gift, payable over a five-year period, is made in conjunction with the Universi­ty's current "Campaign for Notre Dame," and will come largely from the 15 Notre Dame alumni associated with the firm. The Alexander Grant & Company Foundation will also participate in the gift. 
Brother Ryan said the funds received from this gift will be used by the C:oJlege of Business Administration for the support of a variety of faculty and student activities in the Depart­ment of Accountancy. 
Covaro added, "The partici­pation of the Alexander Grant & Company Foundation reflects our continuing supJ,>ort of ac­counting and audltlng educa­tion. The leadership ofJohn C. Burke, managing partner of our Kansas City office and a 1960 Notre Dame graduate, was a major factor in organizing the alumni effort to reach our contribution goal. This _grant is one of the largest financial commitments undertaken by the Foundation." 
The Grant Company, found­ed and now headquartered in Chicago, has offices in more than 50 U.S. cities and affilia­tions throughout the world .

The team is young and should be improving. The men's team enjoyed a successful season, placing sixth at the MCSA regionals, and also taking second in the East­ern Division of the MCSA. The team also placed first in one regular meet and· had four second place finishes, consis­tently beating out more exper­ienced competition. "We are really doing well to come in second most of the time," Powers said, "And some of the other teams get 
disturbed because we have so much fun doing it." 
Both the women's and the men's team, captained by Powers, fund most of the pro~ram themselves through vanous fund raising activities, although they do get some money from the University, and also from a special fund. 
The Ripcho-Wilson Memorial Fund was established in mem­ory of Stan Ripcho and Gordon Wilson, two former Notre Dame ski team captains who were killed in a plane crash last year.

NBC to tE~levise Bengals finals 

byLeoLatz Sports Writer 
The 49th annual Bengal Bouts Tournament will con­clude this Sunday night at 7:00 p_.m. with a slate of at least 11 
championship bouts. If the third round of this year's ~engal' s tourney is anything like rounds one and two, it will indeed by a banner year for the Bouts. 
NBC-TV will add to the excitement of the Bengal Bouts' conclusiong as they will tape Sunday's evening's fights. The boxing competition will be feat­ured on an edition of "Spons­world." 
Competition has been the keynote of this year's tourney as the weight devisions have been the best balanced in years. The fact that three past 
champions and two returning finalists have been upset this year demonstrates the intense spirit of the club. 
Division by division, the fight card reads as follows: 
130 POUNDS; Doug Borgatti and Rocky Romano surviVed this division which included two returning finalists and a former champion. One of those final­ists and a former champion. One of those finalists is Borgatti and the champion is Romano. Borgatti, whose nichname is 
"tough guy," certainly lives up to h1s reputation as he beat Darryl Reyes, the other finalist on a technical knockout last night. Romano would love 1to repeat as champion in only his second year of boxing. Look for a bout that will be toe to toe from the wund of the first bell. 
135 POUNDS: Returning finalist Joe Viola faces Roben Rivera in this weight division. Wiola combines speed and power while Rivera features an unorthodox roundhousing style. 
When Rivera connects, he has the power to end the fight. 
140 POUNDS: Mike "Olld Man" Mazurek meets jeff··-' Mosher for this weight champ­ionship. Mazurek is a law student and is truly an "olld man", by college standarrls, at age 32. He was a finalist in and Belzer are very aggressive

Irish, Jackets cancel series 
ATLANTA (AP) -Notre Dame has agreed not to play football with Georgia Tech in 1982 and 1983 so the Yellow Jackets can increase their par­ticipation in Atlantic Coast Con­ference competition, Tech Athletic Director Doug Weaver said Thursday. 
The two schools had agreed to play in those years, but no contracts had been signed, Weaver said. The current Tech-Notre Dame contract ex-
Tech, which joined the ACC last year, will replace Notre Dame with North Carolina State in 1982 and Virginia in 1983, Weaver said. 
"We want to compete for the ACC championship as soon as possible," he said. "We are working on other changes, but this is the first we've complet­ed. I still can't say when we'll be able to play for the title, but it could be in 1983 and possibly as early as 1982. ''

In Tennessee 

Irish start NCAA competition 
oy Paul Mullaney Assistant Sports Editor 
Before every basketball season Notre Dame Coach Digger Phelps emphasizes his team's top goal is .o win 20 games, and thus be assured of receiving 3: p~st-season tour­nament mvttatlon. 
And while another season has come and gone, Phelps will lead his charges into NCAA -tourney action this weekend for the sixth straight season, mak­ing the eighth-year Irish mentor the orrty current coach who can make that claim. 
The Irish, recipients of the top seed in the Mideast Regional, will open play on Sunday in the second round against the winner of Friday's contest between Tennessee and Eastern Kentucky. 
Both Friday night's and Sunday afternoon's games will be played in 11,478-seat Murphy Athletic Center on the campus of Middle Tennessee State in Murfreesboro, Tenn. Notre Dame's Sunday game will be televised regionally (WNDU-TV) by NBC Sports, with tipoff set for 3:36. Dick Enberg and Billy Packer will provide the commentary. 
What the Irish (22-5) hope to provide is play that will advance them to the regional final site of Indianapolis' Market Square Arena. To do that, Notre Dame will have to regroup after a pair of season-ending losses at DePaul and to Michigan before a Pontiac Silverdome crowd of 37,283 last weekend. 
. ''L?sing our last two games dtdn t do much for our morale," said Phelps. "But, and I've said this all season, we

The 1979 NCAA Mideast Regional appears to) --------:,...------------, 
boil down to a showdown between Notre Dame 
(22-5) and the Spartans of Michigan State (21-6). · 
This wiii be the sixth straight NCAA appearance 
for the Irish under Coach Digger Phelps, and 
their 16th overall. 
The Spartans, coached by Jud Heathcote, will 
be makmg their 4th visit to the prestigious 
post-season classic. This could very weii be the 
last college appearance for 6-8 Earvin "Magic"

leave an NCAA championship trophy in East 
Lansing as he moves on to the NBA. 
Louisiana State, the SEC champs and Big 10 
runnerup Iowa should also advance ·to the regional semi-final games. The Hawkeyes are paced by star backcourtman Ronnie Lester and a scrappy defense. L.S.U. will have to count on 6-2 guard AI Green for most of their scoring. . punch with the loss of top scorer Dewayne. Scales. The 6-7 Scales showed an amazing sense of timing in deciding to negotiate a pro contract, 
the week before the NCAA tourney. 
The only other team which has an outside shot 
at going anywhere is Detroit. The Titans have 
defeated 4 NCAA and 2 NIT tourney teams en 
route to a 22-5 season and could surprise 
intra-state rival M.S.U. in the 2nd round. 
The rest of the Mideast teams appear to have' 
little or no chance at going anywhere but home 
for spring break. Lamar, Appalachian State,, 
Toledo, Tennessee, and Eastern Kentucky are, 
the teams in this category. 
The Irish were awarded the #1 seed and: 
deservedly so. It seems as if too much has beeni 
made of the twin losses to Depaul and Michigan; 
last weekend. I doubt if there is any need for! 
panic on the part of N.D. fans. , 
What the Irish need to do is simply loosen up1 and play the brand of basketball which madel them so awesome in mid January. Notre Dame has played a tou~h~ schedule of road games before some very hosule fans (West Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky), The/

we can take a loss and learn· 
from it." 

While the Irish will have to 
wait until tonight to learn whol

Tennessee rates as the favorite 
to meet Notre Dame. The 
Volunteers head into this year's. 
NCAA tou.rney followins their

Whether or not Don DeVee's squai:l can make a serious bid for the regional title depends heavily on the play of JUnior forward Reggie ] ohnson. The two-time all-SEC player is averaging 21.5 ppg for Tennessee, shooting .559 from the floor and .764 from the free throw line. Johnson is the mao the Vols look to for insicl ~ strength as well, as his "il rebounds indicate. .

In the Backcourt, DeVoe's likely starters will be 6-3 Gary Carter, an all-SEC freshman· team elect, and Bert Bertelkamp, a 6-3 junior who is billed as a top-notch outside shooter. Carter is averaging 
10.5 ppg while Bertelkamp contributes 4.9 ppg. 
"Tennessee 1s a team that beats you with its quickness and its ability to run,'' said Phelps. ''They have good size and they're extremely rugged on the boards. Any team that can beat Kentucky three times in one season has to be pretty

Quinlivan caps successful ski season 
by Mark Perry Assistant Sports Editor 
Although they are hampered by no practice facilities, little funding, and little publicity, the Notre Dame ski team has just finished another 3uccessful season. 
Mike Quinlivan capped the season for the Irish skiers, as he finished second over-all at the National Collegiate Ski Associa­tion races, the small college national championships, held on March 3 and 4 at Cliffs Ridge in Mar9.uette, MI.

Knockouts highlight Bengals 
by Lou Severino Sports Writer 
Hard-hitting action and even­ly matched fights marked the semi-final round of the 1979 Bengal Bouts held last night before a crowd of 3,400 at the ACC. 

The 2nd bout of the ni~ht proved to be the most excitmg of the 22. Defending 125 lb. champ Rocky Romano rallied in the 3d round, battling back with counter punches to offset the left jab of Chris MacDonald and capture a split decision. At the end ofthe fight, both boxers were covered with blood as they . received a standing ovation from the crowd. 
Romano was one of only 3 defending champs to post victories, while 3 others were upset. 
Two-time champ Tony Ricci overcame a 3 inch height dis advantage to score a unanimous decision in the 149-pound class.

But the most powerful punch of the night came in the next-to-last bout as 230-pound grad student Sean McCormick delivered a vicious risht cross to the chin of Jeff Catra.

And while Eastern Kentucky 
(21-7) doesn't have the billing 
that the 20th-ranked Vols 
(20-11) have, they do have the 
personnel that can't be taken 
for granted. 
''This is a team that can hurt 
you both inside and out,'' said Phelps of the Colonels. ·"They have one of the top shooters in the country 10 James ·Tillman, and he can shoot the long one as well as muscle underneath. His 181 rebounds 
prove that. 
''Eastern Kentucky .is an

and can hurt you in a lot of 
different situations." 
Eastern Kentucky's fire­power originates in the person of James "Turk" Tillman. The

experience gained by playing in such situations 
coupled with memories of last year's Final Four 
trip should benefit the squad immensely. 
The Irish depth, which has been emphasized 
all year, wiii be enhanced by the tournament 
format. Playing tournament games within short 
periods of time and at different sites will stress 
the need for depth-something which the Irish 
possess in a supply unlike most othe NCAA 
clubs. 

One such team is Michigan State. The name 
Earvin ] ohnson has become synonomous with 
M.S.U. basketball. The 6-8 soph runs the show from the point guard spot for the Spartans. "Magic's':.Jlliu>oint passing sets up the inside scoring of Greg Keiser and will provide a stern test for i:he Irish big men. But there are two factors which seem to favor Notre Dame if they meet up with the Spartans. I( M.S.U. has no depth past 6th man Ron Charles and 2( 6-7 Bill Hanzlik will match up with Johnson as weII or better than any other guard in the country.

So look for a spectacular game when the Irish ·and Spartans cc ,: .Je in Indianapolis. This matchup will maLt\. the resumption of a rivalry which last took place in 74-75 when N.D. triumphed 91-89. 
Mental attitude, cutting down on turnovers and defense are three facets of the game which are crucial in tournament play. 'f the Irish can regain these as_pects of their game which have deserted them m recent weeks look for an Irish win and another trip to the Fina' four. 
But don't expect it to be easy.
