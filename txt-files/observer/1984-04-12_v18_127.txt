Outcry may bring end to CIA-directed mining of Nicaraguan harbors 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -As members of Congress voiced anger over covert 
U.S. activities in Nicaragua, Reagan administration officials said yester­day that the CIA-directed mining of Nicaraguan harbors might not be resumed because of the mounting outcry against it. 
A senior State Department official said the initial phase of the mining had been completed before the Senate overwhelmingly condemned the action Tuesday night in a non­binding resolution demanding that no federal funds be spent on the operation. 
The official, who spoke only on condition that he not be identified, said the CIA will be forced to halt support for anti-government guerril­las in Nicaragua if Congress rejects an administration request for $21 million to finance the insurgency. 
The official said the current phase of the mining was completed a few days ago, and denied there was any "cause-and-effect" connection with the burgeoning controversy over President Reagan's Central America policies. 
Nonetheless, the official ack­nowledged that the OA might be reluctant to resume mining after the Senate's 84-12 adoption of the anti· mining resolution sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and backed by Senate Majority Leader Howard H. Baker Jr., R-Tenn., and GOP whip Ted Stevens ofAlaska. 
President Reagan gave his written approval for the mining in February, Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., dis· closed Tuesday in a sharply critical letter to CIA director William Casey. 
As Reagan toured a Ford assembly line in Claycomo, Mo., yesterday, he was asked his reaction to the Senate resolution. "You wouldn't want to hear it," he replied. But Tuesday night, immediately after the Senate vote, the president told reporters that "if it's not binding, I can live with it." 
Deputy Secretary of State Ken­
neth Dam told a House hearing that 
the United States is not at war with 
Nicaragua but is engaged in 
"collective self-defense." 
Rep. Michael Barnes, D-Md., chair· 
man of the Foreign Affairs subcom­
mittee on Western Hemisphere 
affairs, asked Dam about a statement 
by Goldwater that the mining was 
"an act ofwar." 
"I don't believe that is a correct 
statement," Dam replied. He said the 
UN. charter explicitly recognizes 
the right ofcollective self-defense. 
The atmosphere at the subcom­
mittee hearing, from Republicans as 
well as Democrats, was confronta· 
tional. 
"Mr. Secretary. when is the presi­
dent going to stop dragging the good 
name of this country in the mud?" 
demanded Barnes. 
The Senate vote, though not carrying the force of law, was the first major setback to Reagan's .policy in the Republican-led Senate. The House had previously refused twice to approve funds for covert 
U.S. actions against Nicaragua's left­ist Sandinista government. 
Kennedy also is seeking a Senate 
vote demanding that the administra­
tion reverse itself and subject its 
Central America policy to the 
scrutiny of the World Court, where 
Nicaragua has filed an anti-U.S. com­
plaint. 
Another senior administration of­
ficial, also speaking only on 
condition that he remain 
anonymous, said many CIA officials 
believe the furor in Congress 
probably has killed any chances of 
House approval of the 521 million 
request for aid to Nicaraguan rebels. 
White House spokesman Larry 
Speakes said that if the $21 million 
request is rejected, as House 
Speaker Thomas O'Neill predicts, 
covert aid to the rebels will have to 
cease. 
The senior State Department offi­cial said Secretary of State George Shultz had "misgivings" about the Nicaraguan mining, although he did not actively oppose it. 

Chemenko becomes 10th president of U.S.S.R. 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -A triumphant Konstantin Chernenko became the Soviet Union's lOth president yesterday, giving him the top three leadership posts and a stature equal to that of his two predecessors. · 
Chernenko, 72, has been Communist Party secretary general, the most powerful position in the Soviet Union, since after the Feb. 9 death ofleader Yuri Andropov. He also took over as chairman ofthe Defense Council. 
He smiled broadly. waved and clasped his hands over his head when the joint session of the 1,500-member Parliament voted to a:so make him president. 
"I certainly realize the great responsibility of the duties and powers connected with my position," he said in a briefacceptance speech. "We now. more than ever, need to work to improve the economy and the living conditions ofthe Soviet people." 
Looking tanned and fit, he pledged to pursue a foreign policy of "constant activity. firmness, consis­tency in the search for ways to sensible accords. It is directed at overcoming international tension, ensuring security, our state interests in the world arena, and upholding peace throughout the world." 
lbe vote was unanimous as usual. As in all other ac­
tions ofthe Supreme Soviet, the nation's nominal parlia­
ment. it reflected the thinking of the 12-man ruling 
Politburo. 
Chernenko's rise to the p~esidency was swifter than that ofAndwpov, who became president seven months after assuming the pany leadership post. 

The practice of having the Communist Party leader also serve as president was established by Leonid I. Brezhncv, Andropov's predecessor, who took over as Communist Party leader in 1964 and added the presidency in 1977. Brezhncv died in 1982. 
The president, formally chairman ofthe Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, serves as chiefofstate. It was con­sidered a ceremonial post devoid of real power until Brezhnev. 
Chcrnenko, a Brezhnev protege, was nominated for 
the  presidency by  Mikhail  S. Gorbachev,  who  has  
emerged as No. 2 man in the Politburo.  
In  his nominating speech, Gorbachcv,  at  53  the  

youngest Politbuw member, said the pany had decided one man should be both party leader and president. 
He praised Chcrnenko as a "staunch fighter for com­munism and peace ...who has outstanding political and organizational abilities." 
During tts 45-minute session in the ornate Kremlin Palace, the Supreme Soviet named Gorbachev chairman of its foreign affairs commission, a post held by Cher­nenko under Andropov and by No. 2 party secretary Mikhail A. Suslov under Brezhnev. 
It also re-elected Premier Nikolai A. Tikhonov to an­other term as chairman ofthe I00-man Council ofMini­sters o.fthe Soviet Union. 

Konstantin Chernenko appears at a Kremlin session ofone ofthe two houses ofthe Sovietpar· liamentyesterday afternoon.

Sabaditsch said foreign exchange programs like Notre Dame's are beneficial for both countries. Many Austrian 'students, he said, are eager to spend time in the U.S. because the experience is valuable in the Austrian job market.

Ht: es­timates that there are currt:ntly I,600 Austrians holding visas in the Midwest, and more than 100,000 in his region with an Austrian back­ground. 
However, it is the task ofacquaint­ing Americans with Austria that Dr. Sabaditsch enjoys most. He recently attended a folklore festival in North Dakota designed to familiarize Americans with Austrian culture. "VVe received a tremendous rt:cep­tion," said Sabaditsch. "We were physically and mentally tired at the end of the festival but it was very enjoyable." 
gave him a S78 lead over Hart in na­tional delegates and completed a sweep of three industrial states that started with Illinois and New York, the former vice president shied away from the front-runner label like it was a bad New Hampshire dream. 
"I am not the front-runner," he told one television interviewer Tuesday night even before the ques­tion was posed. He reiterated that disclaimer word-for-word to a group of auto workers yesterday in St. Louis and added, "There's a tough road ahead and I am not taking any­thing for granted." 
But Mondalc couldn't ket:p the grin off his face and acknowledged that -for the first time since his campaign was knocked into a tailspin by Hart's upset victory in New Hampshire six weeks ago -ht: sees a chance to lock up the nomina­tion before the .July convention. 
"I now believe I have a chance to get the delegates before the conven­tion," he said. "Up until Pennsylva­nia, I didn't think I had that chance." 
Mondale was in the St. Louis area reminding workers at a Chrysler plant how he helped work out federal loan guarantees to save the automaker four years ago and how Hart opposed that plan. 
Mondale, who had started out the campaign year with a win in the Iowa caucuses Feb. 20, headed to Arizona later in the day where he and Jackson campaigned for 33 delegates at stake in caucuses Satur­day. After that, the only contests on the April calendar are caucuses in Utah, Missouri and Vermont. 
When Mondale holds out hope for a pre-convention victory, he is talking about the 931 delegates he needs to meet the magic plateau of 1,967 -the number of votes that it takes to award the nomination. 
Hart, on the other hand, needs to win roughly two-thirds of those yet to be selected to accumulate the 1,389 additional supporters he will need at the convention. 
"The calendar from now on favors 
me," Hart said in an interview en 
route from Washington to Denver 
after the die was cast in Pennsylva­
nia. "We are headed into states 
where the positions he ( Mondale) 
has taken are going to 
begin to cut the other way." 

Hart was heavy on football anal­
ogy in outlining his plans. 

"We are happy ... because we just 
came out of our most difficult 
period," Hart said. "It is the second 
half. You know the sun is coming 
out. The field is going to be a lot fas­
ter." 

The Colorado senator was back in Denver yesterday for his first day off the campaign since December ­resting and trying to shake a cold aide Tom Gleason described as "nothing serious."

World economy recovery hindered by enormous U.S. budget deficits 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON· Enormous hudgt't dd1dts in the United States pose a "major potc..·ntial dangc..·r" for the healthy recovery of the world's c..Tonomy. till' International Monetary Fund ~aid yc..·sterday. 
A rc..·port hy the fund's staff said budgc..·t red-ink tends 10 keep inter­c..·st rate..·~ higher than they would otherwi~e be. Ami that, it said, has "implications that go heyond the borc..lt:rs of the countries actually ex­pt·rkncing the deficits," particularly for dc..·veloping nations struggling to rc..·pay 1heir debts. 
"l'iscal rc..·straint is thus clt:arly 
needed, from an intc..·rnational as 
well as from a domestic standpoint," 
it said. 
Till' report, c..·alkd the World 
Economic Outlook, was relt:asnl as the spring meeting of the 146­membt:r organization got under way at the fund's Washington headquar­ters. In recent years, the IMF has been instrumental in fashioning aid 
packages  ti>r  debt-stricken  
countries.  
The  fund  staff  study  said  

"suhstantial progn:ss" was made last year in coming to grips with those countries' dt:hts, estimated at S669 hillion in 198.3 for dt:vdoping na­tions which don't export oil. 
Still, it said the dt:ht-riddt:n na­tions cannot lt:t up in dlorts to reduct: their hudget deficits, main­tain overseas markets for their products and kt:t:p inflation under control. 
At the same time, the in­dustrialized nations must maintain economic momentum so they can continue huying goods from developing countries and fight off' pressures at home to bar foreign products which are competing with domestic industries, the economic survey said. 
The report forecast that if tile in­dustrialized nations maintained a healthy growth pace, with most in­flation and declining interest rates, the deht troubles of the poorer countries would gradually ease. For example, it said, the ratio of the foreign debt of the 25 biggest deb­tors to their exports would decline from 150 percent last year to 132 percent in 1987 and to 124 percent in 1990. 
However, the study also found that the debt obligations of key countries would actually rise around 1987 because payments of principal on their loans would start coming due.

Midwestern pizza parlors front for heroin smuggling ring 
Senate campaign manager is kidnapped, released 
Associated Press 
LEXINGTON, Ky. -The Senate campaign manager to former Gov. john Brown Jr. was kidnapped at gunpoint and later released when a ransom was paid. An arrest has been made in the abduction, the FBI said yesterday. 
Wallace Wilkinson was abducted from his office here Tuesday morning and released about 9:30a.m. yesterday after the payment of an undisclosed amount of money, said FBI special Agent James Yelvington. 
Jerome Bush Jernigan, a 54-year-old busi­nessman, was arrested near Wilkinson's office here yesterday afternoon by the Lexington­Fayette Urban County police, said detective Michael Moynahan. 
Wilkinson, the owner of the Capitol Hotel in Frankfort, was abducted at gunpoint about 3 p.m. Tuesday and was taken to Frankfort, where he spent the night, Moynahan said.

OLNEY, Ill. -Joe's Pizza Parlor, across from the high school, is a popular spot where the Lions Club meets every Thursday. 
But federal officials say joe's also was a crucial link in an international heroin smuggling conspiracy that has smuggled more heroin into the United States than the notorious "French Connection." The case, which involves a group of Sicilian­born pizza shop operators in several Midwestern communities, has been dubbed the "Pizza Connection."

southeastern Illinois, said they were shocked by the news. Until the Pizza Connection, Olney was known mainly as one ofthe few places in the country to have a population of al­bino squirrels. 
"The Pizza Connection is definite­ly getting top billing" in coffee shop and other gossip, said editor James Small of the Olney Daily Mail. Small printed a few hundred extra copies of the paper Tuesday to tell his readers about the federal officials' announcement in New York. 
joe's, a three-room, red-brick cafe, has stayed open for business but the owner, Giuseppe "joseph" Glagow, where an undisclosed amount of money was delivered and Wilkinson was released. 
A 1982 Lincoln Continental owned by Jim Aldridge, president of New Farmers National Bank in Glasgow, was reported stolen and later recovered by police. 
The ransom has not been found, Moynahan 
said. 

Police received information yesterday that Jernigan could be found at a Lexington hotel, where he was staying, or at Wilkinson's office, Moynahan said. 
Police staked out both locations and ar­
rested Jernigan, who offered no resistance, 
Moynahan. 

Jernigan was held in the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Detention Center and would be formally charged with extortion at a court appearance this morning before a U.S. magistrate, Yelvington said. 
Trupiano, is in jail after failing to post a $1 million bond. 
On Monday, federal authorities in New York accused Trupiano and 30 others with participating in a ring that smuggled $1.6 billion worth of heroin into the country from Sicily over a ftve-year period. The heroin allegedly was shipped through three pizza parlors in Illinois and one in Wisconsin. 
Small, who called Joe's Pizza Par­lor "a nice, small, out-of-the-way place," said Trupiano was known as "a good Catholic" who "never missed Mass."

~Reagan visits autoworkers 
Associated Press 
CLAYCOMO, Mo.-President Reagan told autoworkers at an assembly plant yesterday that the economy has recovered and people have gone back to work because "all of us ... have hung tough" and ignored those who said it couldn't be done. · 
In remarks after lunch that Reagan had in the hourly workers' cafeteria and a tour ofan assembly line of a modernized Ford plant in Clay County outside Kansas City, the presi­dent said his effort ro "rebuild America from the bottom up" hasn't been easy. 
"Times have been rough, and yes, the reces­sion was much deeper and longer than almost anyone predicted," Reagan said. "But these problems had been building up for 20 years, and we were determined to find a real economic cure, not just resort -as they had so often in the past -to another political quick ftx." 
And in a jab at his political opponents who accuse him of a lack of compassion, he said, "There's no compassion in snake oil cures." 
close his parlor until 4 p.m. each 
weekday because school officials 
complained that pupils were mis­
sing classes ro play pinball at the 
cafe, Small said. 
Robert Malone, a leader in the Chamber of Commerce, called fel­low member Joe Trupiano "a very personable young fellow" who had lived in Olney about 10 years. 
"It just looked like a little old country town restaurant." Malone said. 
Olney wasn't the only small-town link in the Pizza Connection. Officials said other suspects in­cluded Giuseppe "Joe" Vitale. 42, 

"All of us, working together and ignoring the gloomcriers and pundits who said it couldn't be done, have hung tough," Reagan added. "Today, as we see the auro industry and the economy humming with activity, aren't we glad we did?" 
While Reagan visited the Claycomo plant, which the White House had selected as a model of resurgence in the auto industry, the leading Democratic contender for his job, Walter F. Mondale, toured a Chrysler plant across the state in Fenton. 
Many of the several hundred workers gathered at the end Of the assembly line to hear Reagan's speech wore blue and white "Mondale" baseball caps that had been handed out earlier at the plant gate by the United Auto Workns. 
Mondale's trip was strictly political -the Missouri Democratic caucuses are a week away -whereas the president's trip to Claycomo and Dallas, where he is to visit a housing site today, was billed by tht: Whitt: Hous~: as an official visit and therefor~: paid for by the taxpay~:rs and not the Reagan re· election committee. 
owner ofJoe's Pizza and Italian Food in Paris, Ill., population about 10,000; Pietro Alfano, 57, who runs Alfano Pizza in Or~egon, Ill., popula­tion about 4,600; and Emanuele Palazzolo, 37, who operates a piz-. z~:ria in Milton, Wis., population 
about 4,000. 
Law enforcement officials said dis­cussions about cleaning pizza tables and delivering flour became codes for drug deals. "Oven," for example, was said to be a code for a kilogram of heroin. 
Sometimes, the white heroin was distributed in pizza boxes, said Bob Long ofthe FBI in Chi~ago, who sug­gested that the small-town pizza par­lors were chosen because they were inconspicuous. 
In New York, Associate U.S. Attor­ney Dennison Young said the parlors generally became "way-stations," or transshipment points, for the heroin, not selling points. 
In Oregon, high school senior joy 
Balcom described Alfano Pizza as 
one ofthe town's teen-ag~: hangouts. 
"We have two pizza places," sht: 
said. One is "more for the wild, 
rowdy type," but "the cheerleaders, 
jocks, everybody hung out at Al­
fano's." 
"No one really expects a small town like that to have a big drug ring," she said. "When you think of drugs, you think of the city, New York and Chicago. When you think of Oregon, you think of sweet, cutesy, small town, nothing hap­pens, real dull." 
But the FBI in Chicago said Mon­
day it seized "automatic weapons, 
handguns, ammunition, bulletproof 
vests and a large sum of cash" at Al­
fano's. 
In Paris, across the street from 
Vitale's restaurant, people at the 
Moss Grain Co. said they were 
puzzled about the news concerning 
the neighbor they call joe. 
"He's an excellent neighbor. He's a family man, very concerned about his children," Mary Moss, 46, said. "I 

like Joe and his family very, very much." Terry Moody, 19, said, "He serves excelknt pizza." 
Customers knew Vitale as a man who made sure they were served promptly and treated well. "He'd just about take your coat and get you sat down," Darrell Spencer, 25, said. 
"He'd make his rounds and talk to people," Moody said. "If something went on. he'd put a stop to it." 
They said business improved since Vitale opened the shop in 1970, replacing the original pizzeria with a new, sit-down Italian res­taurant. 
In Milton, Wis., high school teac­her james Polarski said of Emanuele Palazzolo's restaurant; "We certainly didn't see any activity. There was no street peddling."

Militarism yields to democracy in South America 
Associated Press 
SANTIAGO, Chile -Democracy has a new Latin heat, one echoing up and down a contint:nt. 
You can hear it in the clangor of pots and pans in Chik, in the samba drums of young Brazilian marchers, in the chants of election crowds in 
Argt·ntina  and  demonstrators  in  
Uruguay.  
Across  South  America,  the  

military lockstep is breaking down. 
Where only two elected civilian governments existed five years ago, a half-dozen now debate and decide their nations' future in tht.· open light of parliaments and the prt.·ss. And pressure is mounting on four n·maining military governments to hasten their withdrawal to the bar­racks. 
"Civilianization" is contagious. Last October's elections in Argen­tina inspired democrats in nearby Uruguay and Chik. And those move­ml'llls now t.·neouragl· others, evt.·n raising faint hopes in Paraguay, ironclad domain of strongman (ien. Alfredo Strol·ssnt.·r. 
"We havl· to unite all the opposi· lion around a single, peaceful action plan, just as the Chileans art· doing now," Paraguan opposition kader Juan Manuel lknitez Florl·ntin told a rl·portl·r visiting Asuncion.

in 1984 may determine whether the Marxist left or <:apitalist center leads the opposition, and whether strikes and demonstrations can force the army to abandon the general. 
The hattie lines arc dearly drawn. 
"We will never have a dialogue with Pinochct," Gabriel Valdes, leader ofthe centrist DemocraticAl­liance coalition, said in a recent in­
terview.  
"The  public  keeps  saying,  
'Enough! enough!'"  
A pinochet spokesmen,  Alfonso  

Marquez de Ia Plata, government secretary general, said the regime is willing to discuss changes in Pinoc­het's long-established plan for a slow return to democracy. 
"But the opposition says, 'We are the only ones who have the truth, everything we say is right,' " Mar­
"Growing public awareness, international condemnation of military coups and the armed forces own weariness . .. may slow the historic cycle ofmilitary 
coups,

Within a year Chile slipped into a disastrous depression -unemploy­ment reached 2'5 percent -and many Chileans' apathy gave way to anger, finally overflowing into "National Protest Days" of strikes and rallies staged monthly begin­ning last May, protests orchestrated 
to  the  rhythmic  banging  of  
household  pots  and  pans  in  the  
smoggy Santiago evenings.  

The demonstrations were costly -62 peoph: were killed in 1983, most shot by police in clashes with protesters. But Pinochet ended some harsher authoritarian measures and opened indirect talks with the Democratic Alliance, comprising Valdes' Christian Democrats and four other centrist panics. 
Talks collapsed. The Alliance demands Pinochet's resignation and full democracy within 18 months. The general, for most Chileans just a white-uniformed figure on televi­sion, counters with a vague scheme for future plebiscites to endorse the Pinochet way to democracy. 
But the demonstrations continue and so do the president's conces· sions. After protests March 27, Pinochet dismissed his economic team and pledged to relieve un­employment. 
The opposition is weakened by distrust -legacy of the Allende years -between its two political hlocs, the Democratic Alliance and Almcyda's Democratic Popular Movement, a coalition of Com­munists and other Marxists. 
Popular young labor leader Rodolfo Segue!, a key anti-Pinochct organizer, has sought to draw the two factions closer together, but he sounds exasperated. 
"The political differences arc very deep," he said in an interview. "It's not for labor leaders to try to resolve them." 
Elsewhere on the continent, the dash is not so bloody, hut the anti­military fever runs as high: BRAZIL 
By the tens of thousands, to a Brazilian samba beat, T-shirted protesters are parading and rallying in Rio de janeiro, Sao Paulo and other cities to demand "Dirctasja!" -"direct elections now" for presi­dent. 
They reject the 20-ycar-old military government's pian for the presidential choice to be made next Jan. I'5 hy an electoral college dominated by the pro-military party. As elsewhere, debt-burdened Brazil's economic woes feed popular anger at a leadership the peoph: did not choose.

The continuing wait for an alcohol policy 
Alcohol is to be prohibited in all party spaces on this campus when and where students under the age of21 arepresent. 
This is the alcohol policy many students expect to be handed down from the Provost as recommended by the Committee on the Responsible Use ofAlcohol More optimistic students, though, still hope for a policy less restrictive than a 21-campus. 
The previous paragraph hinges on the two words, "expect" and "hope." By this date, students should be mounting a formal protest, or breathing a sigh of relief, and toasting the A.lcohol Committee's chairman, Father William Beauc­hamp. Neither a mug nor a picket sign can be raised, though, because the ad­ministration has yet to announce a new alcohol policy. 
In a forum held in Breen-Phillips Feb. 21, Beauchamp said the policy should be released by April l. One ofthe reasons the April 1 deadline was set was to allow any students who might want to move offcampus because ofthe new policy to do so without forfeiting their housing deposits. The deadline for pulling con­tracts had been changed from April 2 to April 6. 
April 1 and 6 came and passed without any official word conceming the JX>licy. Student Body President Rob Bertino was the only "official" to comment on the ignored deadline. He said any student who wanted to move off campus would not be penalized. 
Today is April 12, ll days past the projected release date for the policy. A source in the Student Affairs office has confirmed that the report has been com­pleted. But still the student body is waiting for word from the Dome. 
One can only assume that the administration had little concern for meeting the deadline it had set for itself All the talk ofApril 1 had been nothing more than a pacifier for students. Housing contracts were never seen as a problem from the administrative standJX>int. 
was the committee planning all along to delay the date, waiting for a strategic time to break the news, i.e., Easter break orexam week? Was it hoping to slip the JX>licy through inconspicuously when passions had cooled and students had other things on their minds? Or was it determined not to allow enough time before summer for an organized student rebuttal? 
Judging from the lack ofuproar, few people were surprised by the announce­ment's absence. After all, for the past year the administration has been playing games with the students over the issue. Not since the decision to go co-ed has student social life been so affected by a single administrative decision ~ yet the students do not know what the decision is, when they will be informed about it, or what its effect will be. 
The administration has insisted all along that it cares about student opinion and will consider student input, but its actions indicate just the opposite ~ it is concerned merely with implementing its policy with the least tumult possible. 
Committee member Brian Callaghan set the new date for the committee's release at April 18. Then again, it might be announced in a letter over the sum­mer. _ The Observer

P. 0. BoxQ 
Convention a success 
Dear Editor: 
I could not be happier with this 1984 edi­
tion ofthe Mock Convention. How could one 
not be thrilled over an event which drew 
more than 500 of our supposedly apathetic 
people, have them come back three nights in a 
row and have many return for a I p.m. Satur­
day session after being there until 3 a.m. in the 
morning? 
On the convention's opening night. I told 
the delegation about my hopes for this con­
vention. I hoped everyone would learn how a 
national convention operates, and how each 
candidate stands on the issues. Surely this hap­
pened, given the heart and soul I saw on the 
faces of every campaigner, every debater and 
nearly every delegate. There were the emo­
tional chants of "Gary, Gary," "Mondale, . Mondale" and, ofcourse, "Reubin, Reubin!" 
The greatest feature, though, is that no one had to work at being educated because, while this was occurring, we were fulfilling the Mock Convention's other equally important goal -meeting people and having a great time. 
I am proud of the Hart-Boggs ticket. It is a refreshingly new one, steeped in those tradi­tional Democratic ideals Mike Turpen spoke of -compassion, courage and idealism. And anyone who thinks Mrs. Boggs is a token woman ought to think again -she is ex­perienced, effective, a great source of good­will and one of the new leaders of the Democratic party. 
I am equally proud of the delegates, par­ticularly on Friday night. Having begun Friday at 7 p.m., we still had more than 80 percent of the original crowd eight hours later when, at the height ofdrama. Mike Brogioli conceded the Mondale campaign and Bernie Pelligrino's Hart forces fmally triumphed over the courageous, upstart Reubin Askew campaign. We really came together then, and the drama and emotion of that night is a feeling I won't soon forget. 
And all this on a weekend in an arena where alcohol was not sold. I guess we all put our alleged alcohol problems behind for four days and discovered that proverbial "great social event without alcohol for sale" which is so sorely needed around here. Too bad it will be another four years, unless we can think of something for the general election next fall. 
All my thank.<; to my committee, to Mary An­thony, Mike Beaudine, Katie Collins, Beth DeBauche, Ken Fisher, Mitsy Hasley, Bill Hea­ly, Paul Komyatte and Pete Pierret. And a great big thanks to the delegates -you were fantas­tic. It could never have come offwithout you.

Rose gets married but held hitless 
Associated Press 
CINCINNATI -Pete Rose took five walks yesterday -four to first base and one down the aisle. 
The Montreal left fielder got married in his hometown earJy yes· terday, then went 0-for-1 with four walks in the Expos' 9·3 afternoon victory over the Cincinnati Reds to remain one hit shy of4,000. 
His next shot at that mark will come in Montreal's home opener Friday night against the Philadelphia Phillies, the only other team for which he has played. 
"I'm going to get another hit this year. I'm not worried about that,"

=:> SOUTH BEND 
Rose said. ''I'm just happy we won today's game. I'm a little disap· pointed, but it was just one of those things that happen." 
The wedding, Rose's second, was a private ceremony at his attorney's office. He married 29-year-old Carol Woliung ofLawrenceburg, Ind. 
"It was a short ceremony this morning, that's all," Rose said, shrug· ging it off. "That's something you do on your way to getting 4,000." 
"I had to get married because that was the only way I could get her on the team plane back to Montreal. 
Only  wives  are  allowed  on  the  
plane."  
With  the  nuptials  behind  him,  

Rose turned his attention to getting the lone hit that keeps him from the plateau reached only by Ty Cobb. 
He swung only once, fouling off a pitch, while drawing walks in his frrst three trips to the plate against starter Bruce Berenyi. He walked on a 3·2 count and a pair of 3·1 counts, while the fans booed Berenyi's wild· ness. 
Rose hit the frrst pitch back to reliever Frank Pastore in the sixth, and drew a walk on a 3·1 count from Pastore in his last at-bat in the eighth. 
Fans tossed debris on the field when Rose was taken out for a pinch runner, and Pastore was booed when he was removed. 
"The only bad thing about the whole day, I think, is I didn't like the reaction toward Pastore," Rose said. "He was just trying to do his job." 
Cobb set the all-time record of 4,191 hits in 24 major-league seasons with Detroit and Philadel· phia in the American League. 
Cobb reached 4,000 hits in his 23rd season at age 40, playing for Philadelphia in 1927.

The first round of Bookstore Bas­
ketball XIII continued yesterday, the 
fourth day of action, as 80 teams 
took to the courts at Lyons, Stepan, 
and the Bookstore. 

"It was a beautiful day for 
Bookstore Basketball," Tournament 
Commissioner Jeff Blumh said last 
night, and, indeed, it was a very good 
day for some ofthe participants. 
Perhaps as a result of impatience 
from waiting four days to play, the 
teams participating in yesterday's 
games set·med to want to dispatch 
their opponents quickly. In 19 ofthc 
40 games played, the losing team 
scored fewer than I0 points, as the 
winners rolled to the required 21 
points. 

The most notable blowout of the day was White Lightning's 21-0 vic­tory over We Never Practiced Even Once. White Lightning shot an amazing 21-of-25, as not one of the players on the team missed more than one shot. Perhaps a little bit of practice would have helped We Never Practiced Even Once, as the team missed 24 shots en route to becoming the first shutout victim of Bookstore XIII and one of the few non-scoring participants in Bookstore history. 
The high scorer for White Light­ning wa'i Chris Beiter, who ac­counted for six of his team's points. Tht: high non-scorer for We Never Practiced Even Once was Pat Markey, who failed to connect on 10 attempts. 
Rivaling the performance of We Never Practiced Even Once was Wimps, which barely escaped the shutout on Mike Stephan's only bas­ket of the contest. Darth and the light Sabres were the 21-1 victors in that matchup. 
Led by Mike Renaud's 12-of-1 B shooting, Darth and the Light Sabres hit 21-of-33 shots as a team. The Wimps, meanwhile, were 1-for-16, 
led(?) by Scott Criminski's 0-for-6. 
Two teams were in the three­point club for the day yesterday. Rockit went 3-for-16 to lose to the hot-shooting ( 21-of-35) Windy City Action. hKitball player Joe: Johnson was 12-of-16 for Windy City Action, whi<:h also includes fmlthall players Mike: l.arkin ( 3-of-6) and Ricky Gray ( 4-of-7). Joe Dougherty was the: star non-scorer for Rockit, mis.o;ing six times in as many attempts. 
Chaotic Oscillations was the other three-point award winner, as Scratch Twice and the Three Itches took the game on 21-of-45 shooting. Don Cleary shot 6-of-9 for the win­ilc Jim Beckwith of the Chaoti<: Oscillations choked on five shots.

Five Screams From the l.oft lost by 17 to Your Freudian Slip Is Showing, ao; Roger Diegel shot a perfect B-of-H. Diegel's mark is the second-best per-· feet game in B(Kikstore history, second only to Kevin Griffith's I 1­of-1 I in Bookstore XII. 
Two other teams managed only four points in yesterday's games. The Macintosh and Four Other Had Apples fell to the Deattitudes, who were led byJohn )aurcgito's B-of-15 shooting. Four-of-32 shooting gave 90125 a loss at the hands of Pat Ewing and 'lbrec Other Guys That Can't Add. 
In the 21-5 category, Trucker and the Dookcrs fell to Over the limit, thanks to Marty Roddy's hot 7-of-9 hand.

tough. 

"You won't see it (the com­petition) better any place else," commented Renshaw. "A lot of the guys you see there, you will also see in Los Angeles (at the 1984 Olympic Games)." 
Notre Dame sophomore Mike VanderVelden and freshman Charles Higgs-Coulthard will be making this trip as the number one and the number two fencers on the U.S. foil team. Their spots were won in the U.S. junior Olympics and prior competition earlier this season. 
VanderVelden (32-8 on the season and 66-2B lifetime) took the gold at the li.S. Junior Olym­pics hdd in Portland, Ore., in February to capture the top spot. He also finished second in a field of 25 at the 19B4 Great Lakes Championships and 14th in a field of 30 at the 19B4 NCAA Championshiops. 
Higg.o;-Coulthard ( 43-6) captured the second spot with strong performances earlier in the year and at the Portland tournament. On March 21, he won a gold in the NCAA Cham­pionships and was crowned ao; the 1984 national champion in the foil. He also captured fourth place in Great Lakes competition. 
Marc Dejong, assistant foil coach for the Irish who fenced in the Junior World Olympics in 1981, notes that while the outing wiU be tough, the Irish representatives should do well. 
"Americans usually have a hard time overseas because they're not familiar and because tbe directors are not familiar with them," said Dejong. 
"As far ao; I can see, they (VanderVelden and lligg.o;­Coulthard) are far better prepared than I ever wao; and that's to their credit because they've been working really hard." 
''I'm looking for them to fence in at least three or four rounds and do well." 
Bringing pride to the l Jnitcd St;~.tes, the two Irish foilcrs will fence in this championship meet next week, April 19-20, in Leningrad.
