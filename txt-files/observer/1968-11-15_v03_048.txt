THE 'WORLD TODAY 
Baffle Erupts Near Cambodian Border 
SAIGON (UPI) -U.S. and South Vietnamese forces defending Saigon approaches counted 337 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong killed in heavy fighting that ended yesterday near the Cambodian border. It was the biggest battle since the bombing halt and the first major Communist attack in three weeks. 
Allied communiques claiming victory said at least I ,000 Communist troops were involved in the abortive attempt to overrun a base camp 60 miles northwest of Saigon manned .by South Vietnamese Rangers. Men of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division Airmobile, recently moved into the area, joined the battle. 
There was no overall report on allied losses, but the U.S. command said two Americans were killed and five wounded in fighting around a rubber plantation three miles from the main focus of action.

The key to world politics today seems to be recognition. All the 
dehate, demands, proposals, offers, moves-toward, both serious and 
not so serious, condemnations and glorifications center around 
recognition. Israel's recognition of the Arabs, the Arab's recognition 
of Israel, or in other words, who's really "there," and who's not 
"there." With this in mind, or wherever one puts it, now let us take a 
look at two of the action centers of world politics. 
UN 
Representative of Albania: We move that the nations of the world 
recognize that Communist China is "there." 
Representative of U.S.: Communist China is not "there." Representative of Albania: You don't want to admit that China's "there" hut you know it's "there." Representative ofU.S.: Yon tbink Communisl China is "there" but we know it's not "there" because we're really "there." Representative of Albania: Well, if Communist China isn't "there" then who is? 
Representative of U.S.: Chiang kai Chek is "there." 
Representative of Albania: No, Chiang used to be "there" but he 
isn't "there" anymore. Representative of U.S.: Chiang is only pretending that he's not "there", but as soon as he makes his move he'll be "there." Representative of Albania: Communist China has instructed us to inform you that she doesn't think any of you arc "there." Representative of US: Well see, we know we're "there"· so that just proves that Communist China isn't. 
Paris 
Representative of Saigon: We refuse to take part in any further negotiations until the US denies that the NLF is "there." Representative of 1/anoi: We refuse to take part in any further 
negotiations until the US admits that the NLF is "there." 
Representative of US: We think that it's time for someone else to 
make a concession. We've already concceded that Hanoi is "there" 
now how far do you want us to go? ' 
Representative of Saigon: You said that the NLF is "there" didn't you? Representative of US: We didn't say that the NLF is "there." We're only letting them pretend to be "there" as part of the Hanoi delegation, but we haven't said that they're "there." Representative of NI.F: What do you mean we're only pretending to be "there?" If we aren't "there," then who have you been fighting for the last six years? Representative ofUS: Oh, when you're "there" you'll know it. 






Representative of N/Y: You used to say that the Russians were the bad guys, but now you admit that they're "there."
