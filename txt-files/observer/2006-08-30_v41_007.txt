University plans Eddy Street Commons 

By KATIE PERRY Assistant News Editor 
Notre Dame is forging ahead with plans to develop a retail and residential dis­trict just south of campus and has confirmed talks with a preferred developer for -the project, University officials said Tuesday.. 
Greg Hakanen, director of asset management and real estate development for Notre Dame, said the Unfversity has selected Indianapolis-based develop­er Kite Realty Group for "exclusive negotiations" in the Eddy Street Commons project. 
"It's not for certain [the University is working with Kite]," he said Tuesday. "That process has not been concluded yet." 
Hakanen said there is "no particular time frame" for when the University plans to reach an agreement with the developer. 
"We will finish and make an announcement once we've worked our way through the issues," he said. 
Last Wednesday, Associate Vice President for News and Information Don Wycliff told the South Bend Tribune there were some "stumbling blocks," but said the University hopes to strike a deal with Kite. 
Wycliff told The Observer Tuesday he could not dis­cuss specifically what need-

Three Darners scale one of world's highest peaks over summer break 
By MEGHAN WONS News Writer 
Notre Dame senior Colleen Mallahan, freshman Kirsten Blazic and Class of 2003 alum Caitlin Blazic all know what it feels like to stand on top of the world. And they have the pictures to prove it. 
Over the summer, all three of these 'climbing Irish' reached the summit of Tanzania's Mt. Kilimanjaro, which at 19,350 feet is the highest freestanding moun­tain in the world. 
Mallahan climbed Kilimanjaro­or "Kill," in her words -in June after taking a yearlong leave of absence from Notre Dame to attend the School for International Training in Uganda in the fall and the University of Cape Town in South Africa in the spring.

NDSMCOBSERVER.COM 'Tradition' Shirt sales Increasing 
Fans embrace year's design, organizers say 
By JOHN MINSER News Writer 
The Shirt, in normal years as much a staple of Notre Dame football as tailgates and the Victory March, will flood the Stadium this season as sales skyrocket far beyond the norm. 
"[This year's Shirt] is trend­ing better than any Shirt we've sold so far," said Sally Wiatrowski, director of retails operations at the Bookstore. "Just shy of 80,000 units have been sold." 
This rivals even the leg­endary Return to Glory Shirt of 2002, when more than 100,000 Shirts were sold, she said. 
Why so popular? 
"There's a lot of things this year's Shirt has going for it," Shirt Project president Richard Fox said. "There's a very classical element. It's something every Notre Dame fan can relate to." 
This year's The Shirt -the back of which reads "Tradition: This is the day and you are the team" -was the brainchild of senior Ryan Ricketts, whose design was selected QVer almost 25 other plans. 
"I submitted the design way back in the first semester of last year," Ricketts said. "It just kind of came full circle. I wanted to show past coaches who had had great success, something well-liked, like a

Students rush to grab campus jobs 
By MARCELA BERRIOS 
News Writer 
If that first encounter with the randomly appointed room­mate was not sufficiently nerve-racking, freshmen also had to survive these past few days of frantic searching for a good job on campus. 
Many returning students have also undergone the process of calling different offices, submitting resumes and waiting impatiently for good news from the people in charge. 
Despite the rush for the 
prime jobs, more often than not, the student does get hired. Currently more than 40 percent of the entire Notre Dame student body is employed on campus, said Matt Biergans, senior student service representative at the Office of Student Financial Services. 
Biergans said more than 3,000 students from all socio­economic backgrounds opt to take campus jobs that range from technology consultants at OIT's computer clusters, to lifeguards under the Athletic

Saint Mary's offers dual degree 
By KATIE KOHLER 
News Writer 
At two schools where fin­ishing a degree in four years is strongly encouraged, a five-year engineering degree· program offered between Saint Mary's and Notre Dame was formalized and updated after existing for nearly 30 years at the College. 
Saint Mary's students are able to receive an engineer­ing degree from Notre Dame in addition to a non-e ngi­neering Saint Mary's degree in just five years -a unique example of the close relation­ship between the schools.

the dog days of summer and the commencement of the best four months of the year -college football season. 
It seems the only thing that can get me more excited for the 2006 season would be a preseason poll. And not just any preseason poll, but the preseason edition of Greg Arbogast's completely biased, largely unresearched and partially cred­ible College Football Top 10 Plus 1 Rankings. 
Notre Dame -Did you honestly expect me to put somebody else in the top spot? This isn't even a biased rank­ing. Quinn, D-Walk, Samardzija, Rhema. Opposing defensive coordinators will be having very sleepless nights this fall. 
florida-There's a good vibe going through this state. Florida won the NCAA tournament, the Dolphins are primed to be serious contenders this year, and Florida hasn't even been hit by a hurricane ... yet. 
West Virginia-Steve Slaton ran for 1,128 yards and 17 touchdowns. Pat White finished with combined totals of 1,780 yards and 15 touchdowns. Both led their school to its first BCS victory in Mountaineer history. What did you do your freshman year? 
Texas -Back up just one second. Vince Young wasn't the only player on the Longhorns? And you're saying that he won't be on the team this year? 
French "Football" Team-After Zidane's headbutt against Italy, the French proved they might have learned a little something about American foot­ball. Who says France is anti-globaliza­tion? 
Ohio State -They would be higher, but I just can't stand that pompous little vest Jim Tressel wears. I'm already praying for a Fiesta Bowl rematch. 
LSU -Which Tiger team will show up this season? The one which was pasted in the SEC championship game 34-14 by Georgia? Or the one which destroyed Miami 40-3 in the Peach Bowl-with their backup quarterback? 
Louisville -Brian Brohm is the best quarterback you've never heard of. Michael Bush (no relation to Reggie) is the best running back you've never heard of. They play in the Big East. Any more questions? 
Oklahoma-Adrian Peterson is the best college football player everyone completely forgot about. After rushing for 1,925 yards and making a serious run for the Heisman his freshman year, Peterson succumbed to injury apd obscurity last season. Even without ex­quarterback Rhett Bonehead, expect Peterson to reappear this year. 
South Carolina-No preseason rank­ing is complete without a dark horse team. Steve Spurrier was a disaster in the NFL, but boy can he ever coach col­lege football. 
USC -On the plus side for the Trojans, USC is leading the nation in ... sexual assaults.

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Group discusses goals for year 
Student safety, community relations, diversity at forefront ofagenda 
By KATHLEEN McDONNELL 
News Writer 
Safety concerns, community relations and diversity issues dominated discussion at Tuesday's Council of Representatives (COR) meet­ing 
To begin the group's first meeting of the academic year, student body president Lizzi Shappell asked representa­tives what topics they'd like to pursue in the coming months. 
''I'd like to use this first meeting as a body [to hear] 
"I'd like to focus on

tions as two top­ics to address." 
Shappell plans to have the South Bend Police Department (SBPD) visit COR again to address a growing number of student safety con­cerns. 
Off-campus president Spencer Feren said SBPD would like to initiate a self­defense course at Notre Dame. Officers would address situations like that of the female student allegedly assaulted in her Turtle Creek apartment last week. 
To promote better commu­nity relations, Shappell brought up the community summit that was part of her election platform. The goal, she said, is to bring communi­ty leaders and local colleges and universities together for discussion. 
''I'd like to focus on stu­dents becoming good neigh­bors in the community," Shappell said. 
The summit would include not only Notre Dame, Saint 
Mary's and 
Holy Cross but 
Lulu Meraz 
brought up race relations as a crucial issue for COR to address. 
"Racism and indifferent comments __:_ that was a really big issue for me last year," Meraz said. "I've heard it both in joke settings and in normal, serious conversa­tion." 
The body focused its atten­tions on working with the dorms to create an atmos­phere in which all students feel welcome. The multicul­tural committee is currently training a multicultural com­missioner from each dorm, Pangborn senator Sheena Plamoottil said. If COR brain­storms initiatives, the com­mittee can pass the informa­tion directly into the dorms through the commissioners, she said. 
COR members also dis­cussed the possibility of fur­ther integrating diversity exercises into resident assis­tant training so that these dorm leaders can foster a sense of openness among their residents. 
Meraz said the multicultur­al committee could institute mandatory diversity meet­ings, at least for freshmen, like the Pillars group already does.

Project discusses China before 2008 Oly111pics 
Special to the Observer 
The global community will learn much about China in two years, when Beijing plays host to the 2008 Olympic Games (Aug. 8 to 24). And, to hear from the average Chinese citizen, the world has much to learn, accord­ing to interviews conducted ear­lier this year by a Notre Dame professor. 
Jonathan Noble, a visiting assistant professor of East Asian languages and literatures, has compiled a DVD featuring inter­views with Beijing residents from diverse social and economic backgrounds on what they think about their country hosting the Olympics. He was assisted on the project by Kevin Abbott, an edu­cational technology specialist at the University. 
The participants were asked seven questions concerning the Olympics and their relationship to China's contemporary social and culture environment. The respondents were generally posi­tive about the Olympics, saying they plan to serve as volunteers and that the Games will mark a significant turning point in the nation's history. 
Most notably, the interviewees believe China is "misunderstood" worldwide and hope that the media coverage of the country during the Olympics will correct misperceptions. 
"They (the Games) will revise the way the world views and understands China and Beijing," said Gao Ming, an attorney. "Because, perhaps, China has been viewed as a traditional country, and now there is this idea of the 'China threat,' actual­ly the Olympics may change the views of foreigners who come to Beijing . . . China .is actually both a tolerant and friendly country that possesses a modern con­sciousness. It is also a very advanced and modern country." 

Dong Shuzhen, a retiree, said that the media focus during the Olympics will "display China's effective role within the global community ... Before, foreigners considered China to be the 'sick patient' of East Asia." 
Lui De, the owner of a design company in Beijing, recognized that positive and negative media accounts of China will be written and broadcast in two years. 
"If you host the Olympics, lots of media from the West will be reporting," he said. "Of course, during the-reporting, some things will be good, others bad. That's not" a problem. This infor­mation will let people in the West have an objective understanding of China, of Beijing, and of Beijing's current development." 
Not all of the responses to vari­ous questions were quite so pro­found. 
The attorney, Gao Ming, for example, said foreign visitors should know three things about China in advance of the Olyrilpics: "how to use chopsticks ... cross the street ... and use the squat toilets."

The program, which has been available to Saint Mary's science and mathematics majors since 1977, gives stu­dents the chance to pursue an engineering major -a degree not offered at Saint Mary's alone.

Toni Barstis, chemistry department chair and dual­degree advisor at Saint Mary's, said the program is advantageous to the women interested in combining sci­entific knowledge, human values and proficiency in the professional world. 
"The program broadens professional and post-gradu­ate opportunities by enhanc­ing students' technical skills with the values and problem­solving skills developed through a women's liberal arts education," she said.

Dame's School of Engineering, said the University works with Saint Mary's students to make sure they are taking the appropri­ate calculus, chemistry and physics courses before they enroll in engineering classes. 
"Some of the classes are scheduled so they are woven together so th·at they count toward both majors," she said. 
Pieronek said the hardest part of the five-year program is getting through the first and second years. 
"By the time we see the stu­dents [at Notre Dame] in their junior year, they are already fully committed to finishing the major," she said. "Once students reach their first engineering classes at Notre Dame, most continue with the 
plification of the transfer process. 
"The [transfer] process has been streamlined and made faster," Barstis said. 
Notre Dame has agreed to make the transfer process more efficient by requiring only official college tran­scripts and a transfer appli­cation form, Barstis said. Students will not have to sub­mit standardized test scores, high school transcripts or a personal statement. 
Also this year, Saint Mary's has offered to provide on­campus housing for students in their fifth year. 
Barstis said she is pleased with the updated program. 
"Now students can benefit from the best of both institu­tions by combining the broad liberal arts foundation of the Saint Mary's experience with the strength of Notre Dame's engineering curriculum," she said. "It also offers the option and flexibility to design a combination of majors that fits a student's individual interests." 
Junior Emily Coffer, who is majoring in chemical engi­neering at Notre Dame and chemistry at Saint Mary's, cites the dual major as one of the incentives that convinced her to attend Saint Mary's. 
''I'm really glad that an engineering program was offered here [Saint Mary's] because that is always what I've wanted to do," Coffer said. "I would have gone to Purdue otherwise." 
Erin Heck is also a junior chemistry major in the joint engineering program. She said she enjoys the opportuni­ty dual engineering majors are given to experience both schools: 
"We ·have the joy of attend­ing small classes and benefit from having a liberal arts education from Saint Mary's, but we also have the opportu­nity to experience the atmos­phere of a larger university," Heck said. "This program is an opportunity of a lifetime." 
Susan Vanek, associate dean for advising at Saint Mary's, spoke highly of the program and its coordinator. 
"[Barstis] has done a lot of work over the last few years to make it more feasible for Saint Mary's students to do a major here with engineering at Notre Dame," Vanek said. 
Nicole Gifford, a fifth-year senior majoring in chemical engineering, said the pro­gram's course load is diffi­cult. 
"But it is definitely worth it," she said.

British police arrest more suspects 
LONDON -British anti-terrorist police charged three more people late Tuesday with conspiring to commit murder in the alleged plot to blow up U.S.-bound airliners. 
The three -Mohammed Yasar Guizar, Mohammed Shamin Uddin and Nabeel Hussain -were also charged with preparing to commit terrorism by helping in an alleged plan to smuggle explosives aboard the planes, police said. 
Eleven people have now been charged on those two counts. Four others were charged with lesser offenses, including having knowl­edge of a terrorist activity but not disclosing information about it. 
A Scotland Yard statement said Guizar, Uddin and I Iussain conspired with eight other suspects in the alleged plot and had intended to commit "acts of terrorism engaged in con­duct to give effect to their intention to smuggle the component parts of improvised explosive devices onto aircraft and assemble and deto­nate them on board." 
Afghanistan suicide bomber kills 21 
KANDAHAH, Afghanistan -A suicide bomber in a car struck a NATO-Afghan military convoy Tuesday, killing one civilian and wounding two others, a day after a bomb at a market left 21 civilians dead and 43 wounded, officials said. 
Another bomb, detonated by remote control, killed two police on patrol in Helmand province, an official said. 
The suicide bomber hit the military convoy on the main road linking Kandahar with the city's airport, said Col. Sher Shah, who was in the con­voy. No NATO soldiers were wounded. 
A civilian driving near the convoy died in the blast, while another civilian and an Afghan sol­dier were wounded, Shah said.

Tower controller missed plane crash 
LEXINGTON, Ky. -The lone air traffic con­troller on duty the morning Comair Flight 5181 crashed cleared the jet for takeoff, then turned his back to do some "administrative duties" as the aircraft veered down the wrong runway, a federal investigator said Tuesday. 
The crash killed 49 people -everyone on board except first officer James Polehinke, who was in critical condition Tuesday. 
The jet stuggled to get airborne and crashed in a field after taking off Sunday from a 3,500­foot runway instead of an adjoining one that was twice as long. Experts said the plane needed at least 5,000 feet for takeoff. 

Poverty rate stabilizes in latest study 
WASHINGTON -Four years into an eco­nomic recovery, the number of people living in poverty has finally stopped climbing. 
Household incomes edged up slightly in 2005, but 37 million people were still living below the poverty line, about the same as the year before, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday. 
It was the first year without an increase in poverty since 2000, just before President Bush took office. 
The numbers immediately became political fodder, with a little more than two months to go before midterm congressional elections that will determine whether Republicans continue to control the House and the Senate.

Ernesto drenches south Florida 
Miami could get up to afoot ofrain; residents prepare for storm by filling sandbags 
Associated Press 
MIAMI Tropical Storm Ernesto's leading edge drenched Miami and the rest of southern Florida on Tuesday as it steamed toward the Sunshine State with a potential for more than a foot of rain. But forecast­ers said there was only an outside chance it would strengthen into a hurricane. 
Residents took no chances, though, mindful of the seven hurricanes that have hit the state since 2004 and Katrina, which struck New Orleans exactly one year ago. 
"I don't think it's going to be too big, but you never know," said Frankel Herad as he removed brightly colored African dresses from. the walls of his store in Miami's Little Haiti neighborhood. 
By late afternoon, Ernesto had top winds of 45 mph. And there was only a "remote possibili­ty" it could become a hurricane with winds of 7 4 mph or greater before crossing over Florida overnight, the National Hurricane Center said.

is vice president of the Notre Dame Climbing Club and has climbed often since she began college, she said. 
When Mallahan was 16, a swnmer service trip to her sister parish in Malawi sparked her interest in climbing Kilimanjaro. 
"I saw it (Kilimanjaro) from the plane and it has been sort of a life dream to climb it ever since," Mallahan said. 
She prepared for her five-day trek up the mountain by going climbing and hiking almost all weekend, every weekend while studying in Cape Town, she said, in addition to weekly surfmg les­sons. 
"Between the swimming and surfing, hiking and climbing, I was in pretty good shape before I attempted the climb," Mallahan said. 
She climbed with a Canadian student who was also studying abroad at Cape Town, a guide, an assistant guide, four porters and a cook, she said. 
Mallahan recorded her journey up the mountainside in a daily Weblog, both to update her friends and family and to have a memory of the experience. 
On June 20, two days after Mallahan began her ascent, she hit 15,520 feet and was prepar­ing for the push to the summit. 
"[We] spent the afternoon eat­ing and resting and mentally preparing for our summit attempt, which was to start at midnight," she wrote of the day. 
"With the summit still nearly 4,000 snowy feet above us, I was excited but slightly terrified." 
After Mallahan reached the top of the mountain at sunrise on June 21, she was able to pause and reflect on her surroundings. 
"It will be a long time before I forget the moment at which the first rays of sun hit the glaciers of Kilimanjaro;"'' she wrote. "The soft red glow of dawn slowly turned the sky pink and then blue as I took pic­tures ... although the summit of Kili is often characterized by wind and -30 degree (Celsius) temperatures, we were treated to blue skies and sunshine at the summit." 
If Mallahan has it her way, even more peaks may be on her horizon. 
"While I definitely need a peri­od of rest before attempting another big peak, Kilimanjaro left me with an even stronger desire to climb the mountains in my own backyard corner of the United States," she said. 
While Mallahan 's dream of 
climbing Kilimanjaro began 
when she was just 16, freshman ·Kirsten Blazic said she wasn't initially interested in making the climb. Her father, Greg Blazic, and older sister Caitlin Blazic convinced her to go. 
The three reached the summit 
together on August 6 -just 
weeks before Kirsten Blazic 
arrived on Notre Dame's campus 
for Freshman Orientation week­
end. 
None of the Blazics had any previous mountain climbing experience, Kirsten Blazic. said, but the three had planned their trip to Africa since last August. 
Blazic was a long distance run­ner in high school and prepared for the climb by following a beginning marathon runner's training schedule, she said. 
"The most difficult part of the climb was definitely the last cou­ple of days when we were approaching the summit," she said. "It became entirely men­tal." 
The Blazics spent the night at the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro, and Kirsten Blazic said she has never been so cold. 
"We woke up in the morning to the sound of our porters chipping ice off of our tents," she said. "After that, I don't think Notre Dame winters will be so bad."

Department's jurisdiction, to cashiers for the different restaurants and cafes that Food Services oversees. 
On average, these students will work between eight and 10 hours a week and earn from $6.75 to $7.65 per hour, according to the Office of Student Employment. 
"The minimum wage is $6. 75, which is fifteen cents higher than last year and in line with what other universi­ties pay their student employ­ees," Biergans said. 
Sophomore Andrew Parnell is one of those 3,000 students who balance work with school. 
"Last semester I worked 

around thirteen hours every week, which wasn't too hard because I enjoy my job, but it definitely took away valuable time that I could've used to study for some of my tougher classes," he said. 
But the responsibility and time commitment factors don't seem to threaten the demand for jobs among students at Notre Dame. 
"Our jobs are usually all full by the end of the first or sec­ond week of the semester," said Kelly Koski, University Libraries business manager. 
Students also tend to stick to their first placement, rather than jump around to different jobs, Koski said. 
"Once students start working for us, they often return to that job or another within the library for the rest of their 
time at NO," she said. 
While many employment opportunities for students are posted in the Office of Financial Aid's online job board, University Libraries simply resorts to printed applications available to any­body who visits the Hesburgh Library at the beginning of every semester. 
Though opportunities abound, there are still stu­dents having trouble finding a job that fits their schedule. 
"I didn't really rea! ize at first that all the good jobs would be gone quickly, and I went over to the Huddle really late," freshman Jenn Perriconi said. "All the good Starbucks shifts were gone. All that is left now are Friday .and Saturday night shifts. Next semester I am definitely get­
ting out [of] there as soon as possible." There is still hope of finding that perfect campus job. 
"If there really is a depart­ment that interests you, and you would like to work with them, just check back to see if there are any positions that may open up throughout the year," Biergans said. "As departments and other organi­zations settle into the school year and the workload grows, there may be new opportuni­ties for students to come in and work. Something new opens up everyday." 
Just ask freshman Sierra McNamara. 
"I was doing kidney cancer research over the summer and wanted to continue doing that at the undergraduate level," she said. "I e-mailed a biology professor over the summer to see if she would be willing to take me on board, even though I'm a just a freshman, and it turns out that she was really helpful about it and I will be w,?rking with her this semester. 
Though the work may be time-consuming, students like Parnell and McNamara come away with valuable insight about dealing with superiors and co-workers that cannot be taught in the classroom. 
That shift during the lunch break is almost like another class, but the reward doesn't come in credits or letter grades. It's the cash that will pay for those weekend taxi rides.

IN BRIEF 

Gold decreases; crude oil follows 
NEW YORK-More weakness in crude oil sent New York gold futures to their lowest level in more than a month Tuesday. 
December gold fell $4.80 to $619.10 a troy ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
"As we see the energy market pulling down, I think there is less fear that there is going to be inflationary pressures," said John Person, presi­dent of National Futures Advisory Service. This, in turn, reduces the likelihood of any future Federal Reserve rate hikes, he continued. 
"But by the same token, gold is probably corn­ing into a value area here from $610 to $620," he continued. "Six hundred [dollars] is going to be quite significant support." 

When inflationary fears subside, this also means an increased likelihood of an economic slowdpwn, related Person. 
"And if there is an economic slowdown, people have less disposable money for spending on jew­elry," he said. "So jewelry demand could poten­tially decline as well." 

Japanese restaurants sell U.S. beef 
TOKYO -Japanese restaurant chain Zenshoku said it will serve U.S. beef starting Tuesday, a first among this nation's restaurants since the ban on American beef was lifted last month. 
American beef has been trickling in to Japan since the easing of the ban, imposed in 2003 due to mad cow fears. Many Japanese are wor­ried about the safety of U.S. beef, which have yet to be sold at Japanese supermarkets ­except for the nation's five Costco stores, run by the Japan unit o_fU.S. warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. 
Zenshoku Co., which specializes in Korean­style barbecue dishes said in a statement on its Web site that it plans to offer U.S. beef starting with the Tuesday evening dinner rush. Zenshoku operates about 80 restaurants mostly in the Tokyo area and western prefecture (state) of Osaka, where it's based, It will serve U.S. beef at 57 locations, spokeswoman Tae Okuda said. 
On the menu, the various dishes clearly list the origin of the beef-U.S., Australia or Japan. A serving of American roast costs 480 yen ($4), while a bigger serving of a variety of cuts costs 1,200 yen ($10). 

Toyota, Honda come to Indiana 
Brand loyalty fades for U.S. automobile companies; GM prepares for sales drop 

AP 

A 2007 Chevy Tahoe sits in a dealership lot in Lone Tree, Colo. Sunday. GM sales are expected to decline as Japanese companies move production to the United States. 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -When it comes to the automobile, Indianapolis has been a General Motors stronghold since the 1920s. 
Nearly two of every five new vehicles sold in. central Indiana are GM models. That's the largest market share for any automaker, and one of GM's best show­ings in any major metro area in the nation. 
Now, some dealers of GM brands sense the loyalty might fade, and with it, sales. 
By 2008, Toyota Camry midsize sedans will roll off an assembly line in Lafayette. Honda cars ­probably compact Civics and subcompact Fits -will be made in Greensburg. 
As a result, Honda is set to become a key piece of indus­trial Indiana. Toyota is already a major manufactur­er here. And GM officials say steadfast customers could accept Japanese name­plates, trading Buicks and Chevys for Hondas and Toyotas. 
"It's going to be OK for a farmer to drive a Toyota Tundra" pickup truck, sug­gests Jay Neisius, GM's Chevrolet market manager in Indianapolis. 
Could GM's vaunted mar­ket share crumble? Sales reports show that simply because an automobile is made in Indiana, it doesn't guarantee sterling success on the car lots. 
"I actually think Honda having a plant in Greensburg will help Toyota sales in Indiana," said Skip Walters, general manager of O'Brien Toyota, an Eastside Indianapolis dealership. "Honda's an import, too. Having them in Indiana will break down the barriers people have. Carnry going to Lafayette will help, too." 
Today, four automakers turn out nine car and truck models in five Indiana assembly plants. Only one of those models -GM's Chevrolet Silverado pfckup truck -is an Indianapolis sales leader. 

Toyota's competing Tundra also hails from Indiana-lit­tle Princeton near Evansville. For every Tundra sold off a Toyota lot in Central Indiana, however, Chevy dealers sell 20 Silver ados. 
Drivers don't buy the Chevys because they prefer Fort Wayne, home of a Silverado assembly line. On the car lots; geography seems irrelevant, Walters said. 
"I don't know if people in Indianapolis even view southwest Indiana as home­grown or part of their area," Walters said. The reason: No freeway links the regions, so the Evansville area seems remote. 
Drivers here buy autos, Walters said, for the same reason as they do in other states. They shop for quality, price and design. That's what has hurt the Tundra's sales. 
The pickup has always seemed a tad small com­pared with Silverado, though Toyota now is bringing out a beefier model. Expecting larger sales volumes, it also is opening a second Tundra plant, at San Antonio. 
Seventeen years after Subaru opened in Lafayette, almost a decade after Toyota landed at Princeton, Central Indiana has warmed to for­eign makes. International brands account for one of every three new autos sold in the area. 
"There are still people who care and won't buy a Japanese car," said Gary Hohmann, new car manager at Butler Toyota, a Westside dealership, referring to baby boomers and seniors. 
Still, this is Detroit country -Ford, Chrysler and espe­cially GM. 
General Motors counts 91,000 employees, retirees and their dependents in Indiana, the largest GM con­centration outside Southeast Michigan. That drives brand loyalty. Employees and their dependents, and employees of GM suppliers, receive GM price discounts on new autos. 
"In my 40 years experi­ence in Indianapolis, we've always dealt with a very powerful GM influence." said Jerry Harvey, president of Paul Harvey Ford, a Westside dealership. 

Peds meet; market recovers losses 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Wall Street advanced for a second straight ses­sion Tuesday after minutes from the latest Federal Heserve meeting failed to produce any bombshells about the economy, and oil prices dropped below $70 per barrel. 
Stocks recovered from earlier losses triggered by disappointment over the Conference Board's con­sumer confidence index, which slipped further than expected and raised the possibility that the econ­omy may be moderating faster than hoped. 
The market initially waffled after the release of the minutes from the Fed's Aug. 8 meeting, when the central bank refrained from raising interest rates. Wall Street had become cautiously optimistic that the Fed's two-year campaign of 17 straight rate hikes is over, especial­ly given recent economic reports that pointed in that direction. 
The minutes said the pause in rate hikes would give the central ba.nk time to determine if the increases have contained inflation· without slowing the economy's growth too far, but it did not rule out further credit tightening. 
"The Fed initially knocked the market down, but once that was away and people realized it wasn't as bad as it could have been, buy­ers carne into the market and took it up," said Todd Leone, managing director of equity trading at Cowen & Co. "The Fed is being vigilant on inflation, and we're seeing evi­dence the economy is slowing down. They have to portray a tough stance." 
The minutes showed that the cen­tral bank believed another rate increase "could well be needed" to slow inflation and orchestrate an economic soft landing. But, the market largely discounted the com­ment since a series of reports, including slowing home sales and the latest consumer confidence numbers, indicated the economy is indeed slowing. 
The Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced 2.50, or 0.19 percent, to a three-month high of 1,304.28.

ISRAEL 
Annan orders end to blockade of Lebanon 
Israel will leave once troops secure border, halt aid to Hezbollah 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called Israel's air and sea block­ade of Lebanon a "humiliation" Tuesday and demanded it be lifted. But Israel said it first needed assurances that forces deployed on the border can stop weapons shipments to Hezbollah. 
The dispute was the latest threat to the fragile cease-fire that ended 34 days of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas. 
Annan arrived in Israel as part of an 11-day Mideast tour intended to shore up the truce, help Lebanon recover and secure the release of two Israeli soldiers whose capture by Hezbollah on July 12 sparked the fighting. 
"We need to resolve the issue of the abducted soldiers very quickly," Annan said during a visit earlier Tuesday to a U.N. base in south Lebanon. "We need to· deal with the lifting of the embargo ­sea, lp.nd and air -which for the

As part of the. effort to get international troops on the ground quickly, a five-ship Italian fleet departed for Lebanon on Tuesday carrying 800 soldiers. 
Annan was to meet Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who plans to call for "the uncondi­tional return of our captives in Lebanon," said his spokes­woman Miri Eisin, referring to reserve soldiers Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. A third soldier, Cpl. Gilad Shalit, was captured by l-lamas-linked militants from an army post near the Gaza Strip on June 25. 
The soldiers' families met with Annan and said he told them he had no new informa­tion about the captives, and there were no negotiations ­not even secret ones -taking place. 
"But the good news was that we got a personal pledge from the secretary general of the 
U.N. that he accepts the mission to get the three kidnapped sol­diers home and that's a really big thing," Goldwasser's wife, Karnit, told Israel TV.

Amir Peretz and urged the block­ade be lifted "as soon as possible in order to allow Lebanon to go on with normal commercial activities and also rebuild its economy." 
Israel has said it will allow free movement once it is assured the forces deployed on Lebanon's borders can prevent Hezbollah from rearming itself. Israel wants international forces to help patrol the Lebanon-Syria border to enforce an arms embargo on Hezbollah. Lebanon says its troops can secure the border on their own. 
Peretz said he told Annan about the importance of con­trolling the border "and the implementation of the embargo against the transfer of arms and ammunition between Syria and Lebanon." 
Annan said Israel was respon­sible for most of the violations of the cease-fire and appealed for everyone to work together to ensure peace holds and "not risk another explosion in six years or 20 years." 
Israeli troops are still occupy­ing a security zone in southern Lebanon and have sporadically fought with Hezbollah guerrillas since the truce took effect Aug. 
14. Israel says it won't leave until a sufficiently strong con­tingent of Lebanese and inter­national troops arrives. 
Annan said the U.N. hoped to have 5,000 soldiers in the region by Friday. That is double its prewar number, but still far short of the 15,000 internation­al troops eventually supposed to patrol the border along with 15,000 Lebanese soldiers. 
"Israel will pull out once there is a reasonable level of forces there," Peretz said without say-

In Beirut, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, on a mission to secure the soldiers' release, said he was told they were alive during meetings in Damascus with Syrian President Bashar Assad and Khaled Mashaal, llamas' political leader. 
"The Hamas leadership says that the soldier they are holding is alive and well," Jackson said. 
"The president (Assad) believes that the two held some­where by Hezbollah are alive," he added. 
Annan visited U.N. peace­keepers in Naqoura, about 2 1/2 miles north of the Israeli bor­der, where the base for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon is located. 
He was briefed by French Maj. Gen. Alain Pellegrini; the UNIFIL commander, and other top officials, then reviewed an honor guard of U.N. troops in blue berets insid.e the U.N.'s white-walled compound. 
He laid a wreath at a monu­ment for nearly 300 peacekeep­ers killed in Lebanon since UNIFIL deployed there in 1978. Muslim and Christian clergy­men said prayers and the U.N. chief stood in silence in front of portraits of those killed, includ­ing four UNIFIL members who died in a July 25 Israeli airstrike on their base in Khiam. 
Annan told the troops their role was "misunderstood and criticized" and they were "never given credit for the wonderful things they have done and the sacrifices they have made." 
IRAN 

President challenges Bush 
White House dismisses Ahmadinejad's request to debate world issues 
Associated Press 

TEHRAN-Iran's hard-line 
President Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad on Tuesday chal­
lenged President Bush to a tele­
vised debate, a proposal the 
White House immediately dis­
missed as a "diversion." 
The challenge came during a freewheeling, 2 1/2-hour news conference and only two days before a U.N. Security Council ultimatum demanding Iran roll back its suspect nuclear pro­6'l'am. 
Ahmadinejad said no one can prevent Iran from pursuing what he called a peaceful nuclear pro­gram-not even U.N. Secretary­General Kofi Annan, who was expected to visit here Saturday. 
"Mr. Annan, too, has to move 
within the framework of interna­
tional regulations. No one has a 
special right or advantage," he 
said. 

The U.N. Security Council has set Thursday as a deadline for Iran to suspend uranium enrich­ment -a process that can pro­duce either fuel f(Jr a reactor or material for weapons. Iran has refused any immediate suspen­sion, calling the deadline illegal, and instead this wonk ofl'ored a counterproposal that tlw United States and somn European nations said lilll short. 
Ahmadinejad's latest show of defiance seemed to solidify the country's determination to snub the Security Council, following a string of war games and uncom­promising public statements this month on the nuclear standofl'. But whether the U.S. can muster enough support on the 15-nation council to impose economic or political sanctions remains in question. 
In his criticism of the Security Council, Ahmadinejad singled out two of its permanent members with veto power -the United States and Britain -for what he called their failure to listen to the needs of other countries. 
"The U.S. and Britain are the source of many tensions," he said. "At the Security Council, where they have to protect secu­rity, they enjoy the veto right. If anybody confronts them, there is no place to take complaints to." 
'This (veto right) is the source of problems of the world," he said. "It is an insult to the dignity, independence, freedom and sov­ereignty of nations." 
The United States' ambassador to the U.N., John Bolton, dis­missed Ahmadinejad's remarks, and Britain's ambassador to the world body suggostod, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, that the com­ments were mild compared to Ahmadinejad's past sharp rheto­ric against Israel and others. 
"Given some of the comments he makes, we should probably take that as a compliment," An1bassador Emyr Jones-Parry said. 
After an opening statement, Ahmadinejad allowed Iranian reporters to ask questions. One Iranian journalist stood up and showered him with praise. 
The local reporters were more casually dressed than the foreign press, who later were allowed to question him about a range of topics. 
At one point, the president joked that he would call on a par­ticular reporter because he and Ahmadinejad were wearing simi­lar outfits. 
In his challenge to Bush, Ahmadinejad said the debate should focus on "world issues 
puted nuclear 
program. 
The Bush administration had a similar reaction Tuesday to the debate idea. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said it was "just a diversion from the legitimate con­cerns that the international com­munity, not just the U.S., has about Iran's behavior, from sup­port for terrorism to pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability." 
Iran offered last week to pur­sue negotiations on its nuclear program but dnclined to suspend uranium enrichment as a precon­dition to talks. The U.S. State Department described the Iranian proposal as serious but said it fell short of what Iran must do. 
The Bush administration this week reaflirmod its intent to pur­sue U.N. sanctions against Iran if it defies the approaching dead­line. But Hussia, whose support for sanctions is essential, has publicly counseled patience with Iran -a possible signal of reluc­tance to go along with the U.S. 
Divisions within the interna­tional community over Iran's nuclear program could hand a victory to Tehran, French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy warned in an interview released Tuesday. 
"The international community must not become divided, to cut itself in two. That would be a vie­tory for the Iranians," Douste­Blazy told Euronews television.

Heavy water contains a heavier hydrogen particle that allows a nudear reactor to run on the nat­ural uranium mined by Iran, without undergoing the enrich­ment process. But the spent fuel from a heavy-water reactor can be reprocessed to extract plutoni­um for use in a bomb. 
Large-scale military exercises also have been under way in Iran over the past month. 
Iran says the weaponry is intended to defend itself against the possibility of a U.S. attack and has expressed worry about Israeli threats to destroy its nuclear facilities. 
Despite intense disagreement over suspected nuclear weapons programs and terrorism, the Bush administration decided Tuesday to allow former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to visit the United States. 
Khatami plans to attend a U.N. conference Sept. 5-6 in New York to promote dialogue, then speak at the Washington National Cathedral on Sept. 7 on the role of Islam, Christianity and Judaism in shaping peace.

Average scores fall for nevv SAT 
Point drop for math, reading sections not significant, College Board says 
Associated Press 
The high school class of 2006 got stuck with a new, longer version of the SAT and didn't fare well on it. Average reading and math scores fell a total of seven points -the sharpest decline in 31 years. 
Experts agreed the dip in combined math and critical reading scores on the college entrance exam was related to the new version of the test ­but differed as to how. The updated exam, with a new writ­ing section, also features more advanced math questions and replaces analogies with more reading comprehension. 
Average reading scores fell from 508 to 503 and math scores fell from 520 to 518, the College Board announced Tuesday, with the changes hurt­ing boys more than girls. 
Boys' reading scores fell eight points, while girls' dropped just three. And girls scored 11 points better than boys on the new writing section. Boys' and girls' math score fell two points each to 536 and 502, respec­tively. 
The College Board, which owns the exam, downplayed the drop, saying it amounts to a fraction of one question per exam. The board's explanation: about 3 percent fewer test-tak­ers, out of 1.5 million, tried the exam a second time. Combined math and reading scores typi­cally rise 30 points when a stu­dent retakes the test. 
The College Board also insist­ed fatigue wasn't to blame. The new exam has been expanded from three hours to three hours, 45 minutes, and can take more than a full morning counting prep time and breaks. Some parents and fair-testing advo­cates predicted the longer exam would cause scores to decline, but the College Board said its research showed no drop-off in student performance as the test goes on. 
Still, the results will spark debate over whether the College Board -also facing criticism over 4,000 incorrectly scored exams last year -was able to deliver a new test that is com­parable to the old one. 

The new scores also stand out shift in emphasis from vocabu­because just two weeks ago the lary to reading comprehension rival ACT exam reported its favored girls. biggest score increase in 20 "Interpreting language that's years. in front of them -girls do bet­

"This is just the latest in a long line of bad news," she said. "They're in a very defensive posture." 
The results were not a sur­prise in the academic communi­ty. The College Board had previ­ously indicated scores would be down this year after numerous colleges began reporting the trend. 
Average reading scores for black students rose 1 point from 433 to 434, while math scores fell two points from 431 to 429. 
The College Board lists three categories for Hispanic stu­dents. Scores for Mexican­Americans rose three points overall, Puerto Ricans' fell two points and scores of students who identified themselves as "Other Hispanic" fell 11 points. 
Girls' average overall score of 1506 out of a possible 2400 remains 26 points below boys' average, but the addition of the writing section and changes in the reading section helped them narrow the gap. Parker said the 

Camara. That 
suggests the test 
may have been marginally harder but that the decrease in retesting was a sig­nificant factor. 
Another factor limiting retest­ing may be migration to the ACT. The number of SAT test­takers in this year's class declined slightly to about 1.47 million while the number of ACT test-takers, about 1.2 mil­lion, rose slightly. There is no way to determine how many students took both exams, but ACT numbers in traditional SAT states like Connecticut and New Jersey rose this year, suggesting more high-achieving students are trying both. Most colleges accept either. 
"We definitely have seen more of that in the last few years," said Princeton Review's Parker. 
The College Board also released information about the new writing section, which includes a 25-minute essay. The College Board said in 97 percent of essays, which are graded on a 12-point scale, the two read­ers agreed on toe score or dif­fered by just one point. 
Fugitive polyga111ous sect leader captured 
Warren Jeffs allegedly arranged marriages of young girls, older men 
Associated Press LAS VEGAS -The charismatic leader of a polygamous sect was captured during a traffic stop three months after being put on the FBI's Most Wanted List and faces charges he arranged mar­riages between underage girls and older men. Warren Steed Jeffs, 50, was arrested without incident just out­side Las Vegas late Monday after more than a year on the run, the FBI said. No weapons were found, but the 2007 
Jeffs' vehicle was stopped on Interstate 15 for having a tempo­rary Colorado license tag that wasn't easily readable, FBI and Nevada Highway Patrol officials said. 
John E. Lewis, special agent in charge of the FBI Phoenix divi­sion, said the trooper became sus­picious when Jeffs identified him­self as John Findley using a con­tact lens receipt from Florida as identification. 
"That would commonly say to the average police officer that there is something wrong, so I am going to continue to probe just a little bit," Lewis said. 
Jeffs confirmed his identity to an 
FBI agent who was 
called to the scene.

said. 

Jeffs leads the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a group that broke away from the Mormon church a century ago. He is said to have at least 40 wives and nearly 60 children. 
Church dissidents say that underage marriages -some involving girls as young as 13 ­escalated into the hundreds under hi'> leadership, and that he broke apart families by casting out mar­ried men and reassigning their women and children to others. 
Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard told KTAR-AM of Phoenix that Jeffs' arrest marks "the beginning of the end of ... the tyrannical rule of a small group of people over the practically 10,000 followers of the FLDS sect." He predicted it will lead more people to come forward with allegations of sexual abuse. 
Most of the church's members live in Hildale, Utah, and adjoining Colorado City, Ariz., but authori­ties have said they believe Jeffs had "safe houses" in four other states -including Nevada -and Canada.

Jeffs was being held Tuesday in Clark County jail, awaiting a court hearing on a federal charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecu­tion. 
The two people traveling with him, wife Naomi Jeffs and a brother, Isaac Steed Jeffs, both 32, were released and will not be charged, FBI agent Steven Martinez said. Martinez said Warren Jeffs initially used an alias, but Martinez would not dis­close the name. 
Jeffs is wanted in Utah and Arizona on charges of arranging two marriages between underage girls and older men. The charges include two counts of rape as an accomplice in Utah, with each count punishable by up to life in prison. 
He had been on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list since May, with a $100,000 reward offered for information leading to his capture. 
The FillS Church split from the mainstream Mormon Church when the Mormons disavowed polygamy more than 100 years ago. Warren Jeffs took over the renegade sect in 2002 after the death of his 98-year-old father, Rulon Jeffs, who was said to have had 65 children by several women. Warren Jeffs took nearly all his father's widows as his own wives. 
Jeffs has been called a danger­ous extremist by those familiar with his church. Church dissidents said that while the sect has long practiced the custom of arranged marriages, young girls were rarely married off until Warren Jeffs came to power. 
People expelled from the com­munity said young men were sent away to avoid competition for brides. Older men were cast out for alleged disobedience, and their wives and children were reas­signed by Jeffs to new husbands and fathers, the former members said. 
"Ifthis will bring an end to that, that will be a good thing," said Ward Jeffs, an older half-brother of Warren. "We're excited for the people down there, but we're very concerned about who might step up and take the leadership role."

Common sows the seeds of dissent 
There has been some question as to whom the artist Common was referring when he shouted "[Expletive] bush" dur­ing his recent performance at The Show. A debate has sprung up between two major schools of thought: Bush as United States President, and Bush as Plant. 
For my part, I am at frrst inclined to believe that Common was indeed referring to President Bush. You see, Common is a soeially conscious hip­hop artist. You can tell which artists are socially conscious because they profane the name of Bush at intervals during their coneert'i. It is com­mon knowledge that any artist who does not in some way profane the name of the president during a performance is not soeially conscious and actually hates the poor and downtrodden. (Third Eye Blind is, by the way, doomed to conservative hell.) So to make rude remarks about the president would serve the dual purpose of keeping his soeially conscious image and letting the poor and downtrodden know just how deeply he really does care about them. 
But perhaps this line of reasoning betrays my superficiality. Common is soeially conscious, after all, and he doesn't say things simply because they rhyme, like other hip-hop artists. Anything he says could have a deeper meaning, espeeially when it comes to enigmatic statements like "[Expletive] bush." 
This is where the second argument becomes compelling. You see, there are 

EDITORIAL CARTOON 

those who would argue that Common was actually referring to the type of woody plant that grows outside of the Joyce Ccmter. Common grew up in the inner city, which is built mostly of concrete; indeed, many of his songs are about how these surroundings have shaped his life and opinions. Perhaps that is why he was so angry last night -he was never exposed to foliage in his youth and is bitter that Notre Dame provides them J{Jr young peo­ple today. 
But Common doesn't seem like a bitter kind or !-,'lly. It is more probable that his concern, if he did indend refer to plants, was purely humanitarian. IIe assumes that most members of the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame communities grew up in aflluent neighborhoods where bushes · were plentiful, and, therefore, we do not care about the poor and downtrodden. Notre Dame must be a veritable bastion of social injustice because, after all, halfofits studenL'i vote Hepubliean. 
The Ill<\ior hole in this Bush-as-plant argument, however, is why he chose to use that particular pejorative. Dictionary.com delines the expletive as, first, "to have sex­ual intercourse with," and, seeond, "slang. to treat unfairly or harshly." 
The first definition fails on a purely empirical basis. Plants, as most people know, do not reproduce through sexual intercourse, but are instead aided by bum­blebees and the wind in a process called fertilization. 
The second definition makes a bit more sense, but ifCommon did intend it that way, he contradieted his entire message_ in a single phrase. From what I could gather from remarks during his show that I could both hear and process, he wants nothing more than to spread peace and harmony throughout the world. But maybe Common is just not a "love thy enemies" kind of guy. 
Or maybe he was referring to the presi­dent, but in an affectionate way. Everyone knows that profanity in hip-hop music can be as much a friendly jibe as an insult. Despite his objections to the president's foreign policy, he could in this instance have been extending the olive branch, as it were. Perhaps, by wishing the president the best of luck in his romantic endeavors, he was trying to be the better person -or else just relate to the president on his own level. 
Whether it was Bush or the bushes, something Friday night made Common very emotional. Emotional enough to use the expletive that he did, a surprising choice given that non-violent resistance to tyranny and freedom of sexual expression are some of Common's central messages (the latter of which was made most clear to the audience during his performance). 
Whatever Common's intended meaning, I am sorry to conelude that he was at fault. It's bad enough that his remark was, in either ease, so out of context that it's hard to be sure what he was talking about. The President of the United States, at least, is capable of defending himself against the profanity of hip-hop artist<;. 
But as I left the Joyce Center after the concert, I noticed that the Hibiscus syria­tus looked distinctly wilted. As usual, the real victims that evening were those that had no voice.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Beware stereotyping 

In Tuesday's Letter to the Editor, ("An invalid assump­tion," Aug. 29) Ryan Davidson is writing from the per­spective of a dangerous ideology. It is clear from his lan­guage that he is prey to the "savage Arab" stereotype­that of an uncivilized people that needs to be punished, isolated and sent to bed without its supper. 
When he states that countries such as the U.S., Canada, Britain and Germany cannot deal with the Middle East as we could deal with more "civilized nation states," Davidson propagates this harmful and unsophisticated Western-supremacist view of Arabs. The issues at stake here and the responses and behav­ior of both sides must be analyzed with attention paid-to the real and often quite logical behavior of those who "hate us." 
Try turning the tables for a minute, Davidson-here we are accusing "uncivilized" Iran of making nuclear weapons for unfriendly purposes when we are the only one who has actually dropped the bomb.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Looking back on Katrina 

anniversary 

August 29, 2006 marked the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. As a New Orleans native and someone who was personally affected by one of the worst disasters to hit the United States, I was shocked that there was not more coverage in The Observer. The only mention of Hurricane Katrina was a reprint of an Associated Press article on Page 6 and a quote by Father Bill Lies in an article on CSC semi­nars. I found Lies' quote to be especially poignant: "With the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina upon us, these seminars give students the opportunities to ask questions we need to be asking, especially at a Catholic university." Clearly, Lies recognizes the importance of the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and the response that should be evoked at a Catholic university. But what about everyone else? The question I would like to ask is "Does the Notre Dame community even care about the widespread destruction and despair in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast due to Hurricane Katrina?" I would hope that the answer is "Yes." 
Having been at Notre Dame as a senior when the September 11 attacks occurred, I know that the Notre Dame community can be very compassionate and quick in responding to tragic events. However, I feel that the victims of Hurricane Katrina have been forgotten by Notre Dame and by the rest of the country. New Orleans is still in the very beginning stages of cleaning up. Things are by no means "back to normal." In fact, things will never be the way they were before the storm. So many people lost everything dtir­ing Katrina. Those who survived the storm are still strug­gling to make it through each day. I feel like we have all seen and heard the news stories of the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina, but somehow we have grown compla­cent. Somehow we feel like it is not our problem. Somehow we feel like we are too far away to make a difference. 
These are not the responses I am used to hearing from Notre Dame students. Notre Dame is not just another univer­sity. Notre Dame is a place where people care about each other and strive to help those near and far, being true to our Christian mission of service and love. Being part of the Notre Dame family means more than just being on campus in South Bend. Let us not forget that the Notre Dame family extends beyond all geographical boundaries. Right now the people in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast need our help. Let us not forget them.

hoping for res­cue and aid. Families were separated and lives were destroyed. 
And as often happens, the real tragedy of the hurricane came afterwards as the government and federal agencies passed the buck, shifting blame from cracks in one bureaucracy or the other while the media perpetuated dis­cussions of the underlying race and class issues that still exist in the United States. 
The victims of Hurricane Katrina were by no means all black. However, since the most indelible screen images were those of African Americans, they became the representatives of the entire incident. And because we live in a polarized society anyway, all things eventually become "black and white." 
So, what are the race and class issues that exist today? Well, one has been stated above. Whenever some discuss race and class in our society, it is auto­matically executed in terms of 'black and white.' When we think in black and white, we put limitations and set standards in regards to either group's social status and capabilities. We hear "white," and we think majority, wealthy, educated and advanced. And when we hear "black," we think poor or ignorant. If you do not think in such terms, then count yourself among the more enlightened section of society. I certainly do not subscribe to these social antiquities and archaic paradigms. However, I have heard stereotypical remarks made in reference to blacks' supposed abundant con­sumption of fried chicken and watermelon or to the effect of blacks lacking nautical skills. The majority of you have proba­bly heard of such comments, or, if not, participated in their con­tinued use. 
This is another problem when discussing race and class. No one really wants to discuss these underlying racial issues. Minorities proclaim their disad­vantaged social status due to hundreds of years of institution­alized segregation and unequal access to education. Instead of pondering these historical set­backs with any profound insight, the majority simply throws money at the minority in hopes that they will "catch up" while feeling "burdened" to help them. 
Need convincing? Last year, during the hurricane coverage, some news media applied "searching for food" to photos of white victims breaking into stores, while they applied "loot­ing" to photos of black victims searching for food. Upon visiting some hundreds of displaced vic­tims in Houston, Barbara Bush said to a reporter, " ... So many of these people were under-privi­leged anyway, so this is working out for them." Mrs. Bush was implying that being displaced was to the their benefit. However, it is unlikely that those individuals, who were separated from their families, and who had lost what little they had, felt relief and thanks in being shipped in a bus to Houston days after the storm. 
One can never really compre­hend poverty or class issues if one is isolated from the realities of the American social structure. What would anyone know about what it means to be "poor" if they themselves have not lived in poverty? This theory of the white man's burden is lacking in this respect. Aside from being self­inflicted, the supposed rationale for the alleviation of this burden has proved problematic. You cannot fix poverty with money. That is, social welfare, minority scholarships, vouchers and so forth, while advantageous (thanks), only begin to tap the surface of the larger issue. 
The most pervasive poverty has been generational. At the turn of the last century, many African Americans were still sharecropping. Actually, this generation now is merely the second generation of blacks hav­ing access to a diverse education and opportunity to compete in society. And the last generation had a rocky road attempting to obtain higher education at an institution of their choice. Ask an African American student at Ole Miss if their grandparents attended college, and you will probably find that the majority of that generation did not. While the privileged have enjoyed cen­turies of education and the pass­ing and sharing of knowledge, some minority groups are only now beginning to start this cycle. 
Suffice to say, this is why the discussion of race and class are interconnected. For a long time, one's race determined their class. And unfortunately, in some instances it still does. With the influx of Hispanics, the majority of them from Mexico, it would seem that there has not been sufficient societal maturation, as this "new" minority is the recipi­ent of verbal abuse and class-ism from both the traditional white majority and the old black minority. I suppose "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" are not without their costs.

SAMUEL l. JACKSON FEATURE 
'Star Wars' to 'Shaft' to 'Snakes' 
By SEAN SWEANY 
Assistant Scene Editor 
A lifetime of fighting deadly snakes at 35,000 feet. serving as a Jedi Knight and living as a philosophical hit man would be enough for just about any­body -but not Samuel L. Jackson. These are just a few of the roles the hardest work­ing actor in llollywood has played during his long and famous career, and the 58­year old shows no signs of. slowing down. 
Since his debut in the 1972 film "Together for Days" as a student at Morehouse College, Jackson has acted in more than 95 movies and currently has no less than six projects in various phases of develop­ment. To date, his films have grossed more than $3 billion at the worldwide box office, which is more than any other actor in the history ofcinema. 
Jackson's repertoire of films spans the entire spectrum of Hollywood genres. from sci­ence fiction to comedy to drama. Some, like "xXx," "Shaft" and "Sphere," either received extremely poor reviews or made hardly any money at the box office. 

However, roles in films such as "Unbreakable" and "A Time to Kill" demonstrate that Jackson is a legitimate actor who can easily impress critics in his performances. In 1994, Jackson earned an Oscar nomination for playing hitman Jules Winnfield opposite John Travolta in Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction." 
This summer's cult hit "Snakes on a Plane" featured one of Jackson's most spirited and unique performances and brought him and his career into the limelight, thanks to his personal and dedicated marketing of the movie. The surge in popularity has left many p~wple wondering exactly how .Jackson has become the most successful actor in Hollywood history. 
Jackson's bread and butter has been his ability to portray stone cold, tough guy charac­ters like Jules Winnfield in "Pulp Fiction" or even indomitable Ray Arnold in the original "Jurassic Park" film. In "Pulp Fiction," Jackson clearly flourished under Tarantino's direction and was able to deliver one of the most memorable screen perform­ances of all time. 
Success has coupled with critical acclaim when Jackson diverges from his usual path and tries his hand at vulnera­ble, emotional characters. 
Examples include the fragile Elijah Price in M. Night Shyamalan's "Unbreakable" and unstable family man Doyle Gipson in the 2002 thriller "Changing Lanes." Jackson turned in remarkable performances in both of these films that cemented him as one of the most versatile and capable actors in Hollywood. 
Considering Jackson's wide slate of films, it may seem hard to identify the reason for his success. However, one need look no further than his explanation for why he signed on for "Snakes on a Plane" to find out why he has succeed­ed. · 
He jumped on board, he said, simply because he loved the title so much. 
Jackson's penchant for mak­ing movies that he personally enjoys translates into fun for audiences as much in "Snakes on a Plane" as it ever ha.s before. This simple mantra of making fun films has pro­pelled Jackson to the top of the film world and could keep him there for a long time. 
The self dubbed "King of Cool" will undoubtedly contin­ue to make films that appeal to him for a long tin1e to come in the hopes that his films will continue to resonate with the­atrical audiences. 
It is not unimaginable that "Snakes on a Train" or "Snakes on a Boat" could slither into theaters sometime soon.

Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff can rest easy in their graves. Samuel L. Jackson has taken it upon himself to earry the torch of the B-list movie hero with ilie recent release of "Snakes on a Plane." 
While "Snakes on a Plane" has created quite a buzz in pop-culture circles. it's not anything new. With its scary snakes and descriptive title, the movie falls into a long tra­dition that dates back to the Universal horror films of the 1930s. "Dracula," "The Wolf Man" and "The Creature from the Black Lagoon" were all films that told the audience all they needed to know in the title. "Dracula" has its vam­pire, "The Mummy" its mummy and "Frankenstein" its monster. The titles were simple, qescriptive and easy to 

remember. What if "The Wolf 
Man" had been titled "The 
Man Who Goes Through an 
Attitude Adjustment Every 
Time there is a Full Moon?" 
Not quite as catchy. B-movies 
don't need creative titles or 
creative stories fi)r that mat­
ter. They neod strange situa­. tions and simple problems. 
"Snakes on a Plane" could 
have easily been "Snakes on a 
Boat" or -even more deadly 
-"Snakes on a Submarine." 
The writers of the film hap­
pened to decide on a plane as 
the setting for their film and 
gave it an appropriate title. 
Vampires, werewolves, crea­
tures from black lagoons and 
snakes in places where they 
shouldn't be are all scary. 
They ·turn normal situations. 
whether an an~heological dig 
at the pyramids or a routine 
plane ride, and turn them into 
situations with tension and 
conflict. 
B-movies are also films iliat know what they are, and "Snakes on a Plane" is no dif­ferent. "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," ilie epitome of a eult film, knows that it is strange, different and not appealing to most people. The main character is a transves­tite alien from the planet Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Mom and Dad are not going to see this film. 
This is not to say that "Snakes on a Plane" appeals to the same crowd as "Rocky Horror." It does not. The simi­larity between these two films lies in the fact that they know what they are and do not pre­tend to be anything different. 
The. makers of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" know iliat it is a film iliat appeals to a sub-culture. The makers of "Snakes on a Plane" know they have made a film iliat is not a work of high art but is a film that.no one has tried before. They have hired a well known actor in Jackson who hams it up in his perform­ance. Tim Curry made the exact same career move 30 years ago. Here is a man who graduated from Cambridge with combined honors and worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company dress­ing in drag. 
Every era has its great cult film. The 1930s Universal hor­ror films are still well remem­bered in Lugosi's eternal per­formance in the titular role of "Dracula." No fan of movies will look confused when told, "I vant to suck your blaahd." 
The 1950s had an expedi­tion down the Amazon dis­rupted by a man-reptile from a certain lagoon, transvestite aliens were a hit in the 70s and this era has snakes . . . on a plane. Ed Wood and Doctor X would have been proud.

MOVIE REVIEWS 
Jackson's shtick saves 'Snakes' 
By ERIN McGINN Assistant Scene Editor 
The only way to really see "Snakes on a Plane" is with a lively audience. Without that experience, there is not much to redeem this highly pre~ dictable and low-caliber flick. 
On its own, this Samuel L. Jackson horror-thriller is fair-. ly uninspired, with some of the best parts of the film added in post-production after Internet fans clamored for the movie to be transformed from a PG-13 romp to an R -rated scare-fest.

Scene Editor 
Every once in a while, a film comes along so stunning that it boggles the senses, rekin­dles the magic of the cinema and restores faith in mankind. "Snakes on a Plane" is such a lilm. Words do it no justice. The pictures adorning review does it no justice. "Snakes on a Plane" is an experience, one to be savored in all of its awe­inspiring glory. It is as funny as "Annie Hall." as epic as "'Braveheart" and as moving as "On Golden Pond" ... but with snakes. 
As the immortal Indiana Jones once philosophically mused, "Snakes ... why did it have to be snakes?" The answer? Samuel L. Jackson. 
Jackson stars as himself kicking butt and taking names (though his character has the much wussier moniker of Neville Flynn). Flynn has been assigned to protect Sean Jones (Nathan Philips, nailing the young David Hasselhoff look perfectly), a Hawaii surfer dude who witnessed a murder and is set to testify against gangster Eddie Kim (Byron Ellis) in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, Kim has differ­ent plans, which he sets into motion by putting snakes on the plane that is to take Flynn and Jones to California. 
Jackson-best remem­bered as the engineer who says "hold onto your butts" in "Jurassic Park"-turns in the most complex, multi-faceted performance of his career. Watching his frustration as he attempts to ward off snakes with first a taser, then a spork is pure cinematic magic, the perfect blend of character and action. It is obvious that Jackson has come a long way as an actor, and his Method­esque performance has the gravitas of Brando in "On the Waterfront," the conviction of Peck in "To Kill a Mockingbird" and the charis­ma of Jimmy Stewart in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" ... but with snakes. 
Above all, "Snakes on a Plane" is classy. Stunning cin­ematic techniques like the green-tinted "snake vision" and amazingly rendered com­puter-generated snakes are well-utilized assets, though they don't detract from the plot and characterization. 
plane combination. 
Once the snakes are released (after the plane is well over the Pacific Ocean, of course) the predicted mayhem ensues as the snakes find themselves in every possible place on the plane. One of the most clever -or annoying ­aspects of the film is the "snake vision," givil\g the audience the snakes' perspec­tive on the action. More than 450 real snakes, as well as their computer-generated counterparts, come flying out of overhead compartments, toilets and bags to attack the terrified passengers. 
The passengers themselves are as stereotypical as they come (a strategy that relieves the need to develop real char­acters), with everyone from the unattended minors to the guy who is afraid to fly, to the rude British guy and hot rap artist. The flight attendants follow this same pattern and include one on the verge of retirement, the young hot one and the smart (also hot) one. 

The movie does have ma.ny genuinely frightening moments balanced out by excellent support work from the cast, which includes for­mer SNL cast member David Koechner and current mem­ber Kenan Thompson. 
Samuel L. Jackson does a great job playing an FBI agent playing Samuel L. Jackson. He gives quotable anti-snake speeches and drops swear­words like candy to children. Although he has seen better roles, no one else besides Jackson would be taken remotely seriously attacking snakes with his bare hands. 
Director David R. Ellis does what he can with the material and, in the end, the movie is about what can be expected from a bunch of snakes on a plane. The joy of the movie, however, doesn't come from the film itself -it comes from experiencing the "Snakes on a Plane" phenomenon.

While some of the dia­

Snakes on a Plane
logue and violence may initially appear crude, it becomes increasingly obvious that director 


David R. Ellis is build­ing on a foundation ·laid by such luminaries as Mamet, Tarantino and Peckinpah ... but with snakes. The artistic mastery of direction and design elevates the already high-concept material into something far more transcen­dent, which is itself bolstered by the presence of Jackson. 
Symbolism abounds throughout the picture. Consider the moment when the prissy white American rides the kickboxing Asian across the plane, or when the stuffy British guy gets his head bitten off. Obviously, the true meaning of these scenes only become clear upon closer, more in-depth analysis. Once fully scrutinized, however, their socio-political allegorical significance becomes evident. 
"Snakes on a Plane" is also about characters overcoming the odds. The rapper 3 G's has a phobia of germs, which he overcomes when he befriends a little kid. One of the mem­bers of his posse is called upon to save the plane despite his relative youth and inexpe­rience. These moments warm the heart and illustrate the good-natured undercurrent that runs just below the sur­face of the film's admittedly complicated text. 

It might not be a stretch calling "Snakes on a Plane" The Greatest Film of All Time. So few pictures are so power­ful, inspiring and well crafted. Others might argue for films like Renoir's 'The Rules of the Game," Coppola's "The Godfather," Scorsese's "Raging Bull" or Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia." But none of those films have snakes, and thus, none can hold a candle to the masterful majesty of what will undoubtedly be considered the crowning opus of Jackson's storied career. 
After all, it's no coincidence that "Snakes on a Plane" rhymes with "Citizen Kane."

MOVIE REVIEW 

1Accepted' unimpressive, worthy of rejection 
By ERIN McGINN Assistant Scene Editor 
While "Accepted" has a great deal of 
promise, the final product comes 
nowhere close to reaching its potential. 
Like films of the high school genre, 
movies about colleges and college stu­
dents are generally successful, since it 
is easy to relate to the characters and 
their predicaments. . "Accepted" follows the long line of 
"lovable losers in 
college" movies

role as Bartleby Gaines, a loser who is rejected from every college to which he applies. No school in the nation will take him, and apparently local community colleges are not an option. With the help of his friends, he decides -for some unknown and unexplained reason -to convert an abandoned mental institu­tion into the fictitious South Harmon Institute of Technology (just in case the significance of the initials is lost, the movie points them out over and over again). 
Because Bartleby has the most gullible parents in the world (what par­ents hand their child a check for $10,000 to cover his tuition?), he is suc­cessful in starting the college that was supposed to be for him and his friends alone. 
However, due to a fluke on the subse­quently created fake Web site, thou­sands of accepted students -also rejected from every real college ­show up for orientation. As a fellow vic­tim of rejection, Bartleby can't bring himself to shatter their dreams, so he proclaims that South Harmon will be a college for the students, run by the stu­
dents.

climax and con­
clusion of the pic­
ture. 
Long is likable in his first leading role, but he doesn't get the chance to fully demonstrate the sarcastic edge that should define character. His char­acter is reminiscent of Vince Vaughn roles, and if given the right parts, he could be shaped into an actor akin to Vaughn. 
Much like Long, comedian and "The Daily Show" regular Lewis Black.., is kept under tight reign as the make­believe dean. While Black is left with a few inoffensive rants, it's easy to see his acting potential. The other characters are left undeveloped and, for the most part, completely unentertaining. 

At the helm is screenwriter-turned­director Steve Pink. While "Accepted" mar~ his first film as a director, previ­ous writing credits include the John Cusack classics "High Fidelity" (2000) and "Grosse Point Blank" (1997). Had Pink and the other writers of those off­beat comedies developed "Accepted," the result probably would have been a much sharper, cleverer and more inter­esting film. 
Unfortunately, Pink had no hand -in the script for "Accepted," which was written by three newcomers who defi­nitely do not receive high marks for this product. 
With a tighter script, more capable direction and better acting from the supporting cast, "Accepted" could have joined the honor roll of great and defin­ing college films. Instead, it falls flat with few redeeming .moments. "Accepted" is instantly forgettable and easily rejected.

DPAC SPOTLIGHT 

Brando shines in classic 'Waterfront' film 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Editor 
Late in Elia Kazan's "On the Waterfront," Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) gets into a car where his broth­er is waiting for him with orders to kill. 
"You don't understand," Malloy pleads. "I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been some­body, instead of a bum, which is what I am. Let's face it. It was you, Charley." 
The mono­logue, one of the 
The film was semi-autobiographical for Kazan, who worked with the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities (HUAC) in anti-Communist McCarthyism. Unfortunately, his self­righteousness is a bit problematic for the film, which draws its morality in black-and-white as starkly defined as Boris Kaufman's monochromatic cine­matography. 
Controversy would follow Kazan throughout his career, which makes separating his cinematic work from his political life prbb­lematic. Taken on its

ner of 1954, "On the Waterfront" invigorated the career of both Kazan and Brando and remains one of the most enduring pic­tures of its time. Despite its relatively dated social concerns, the film paints an accurate and interesting portrait of 1950s corruption and its effects on blue­collar workers. 
"On the Waterfront" follows Terry Malloy (Brando), a one-time boxer turned dockworker who ultimately fights against the Mob-controlled union led by Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). Malloy is initially reluctant to do the right thing, but upon meeting Edie (Eva Marie Saint), the sister of one of Friendly's victims, he comes around and decides to testify against Friendly -a potentially fatal decision. 
more force and vigor 
than ever in his 
career, surpassing even the narrative clarity he brought to Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar Named Desire" (1951). 
At the center of it all is Brando. It might be hyperbole to claim that he rev­olutionized acting -but not by much. The Method style of acting he brought to Malloy was a revelation, influencing actors for generations to come. 
"On the Waterfront" is easily among the great performances of all time, even if elements of it seem outdated by today's standards. The acting across­the-board is excellent, from Saint's sen­sitive Edie to Cobb's slimy union boss Johnny Friendly. 
The music by "West Side Story" com­poser Leonard Bernstein is also memo-rable, anchored by a wistful, flute-driv­en love theme. Bernstein~s only film score punctuates the on-screen action in a way far different that most scores, intentionally running against the real­ism of the film rather than complement­ing it. This creative choice affects some of the scenes drastically, though it does­n't necessarily reduce the gravitas of any crucial scenes. 


The big winner at the 1954 Oscars, "On the Waterfront" took home stat­uettes for Best Picture, Best Director (Kazan), Best Adapted Screenplay (Schulberg), Best Actor (Brando), Best Supporting Actress (Saint), Best Cinematography (Kaufman), Best Art Direction (Richard Day) and Best Editing (Gene Milford). 
More recently, it was ranked by The American Film Institute as the eighth greatest film of all time, a testament to its longevity and timelessness. 
"On the Waterfront," one of the clas­sics of American cinema, will be screened on Saturday at 3 p.m. in the Browning Cinema of the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center as part of the PAC Classic 100.

NFL 

Palmer not satisfied with return to the field 
Despite scorching Green Bay for three first-half touchdown passes, Cincinnati QB found room for improvement 
Associated Press 
CINCINNATI -Instead of get­ting caught up in those three perfect touchdown passes, Carson Palmer chose to dwell on what went wrong. 
A few things were a little bit ofT during his return from a devas­tating knee injury. He missed his mark on a pass or two. He didn't make the right decision on every play. There was a little bit of rust on his game. 
"I defmitely have a long way to go to get where I need to be," he said. 
While Palmer looked at areas of improvement after the Cincinnati Bengals' 48-17 pre­season victory over the Green Bay Packers on Monday night, everyone else saw the big pic­ture. 
From that viewpoint, these Bengals are contenders again. 
"We are picking up from where we left off last year," receiver Chad Johnson said. "Some say that what we did last year really doesn't matter anymore, but we are picking up from right where we left off last year." 
They ended last season as AFC North champions, losing a first­round playoff game at Paul Brown Stadium against the Pittsburgh Steelers. On Palmer's first pass of that game, Kimo von Oelhoffen drove his shoulder into Palmer's left knee, shrndding two ligaments and dislocating his knee cap. 
The Bengals' chances of con­tending for another title depend­ed upon how Palmer's rehab went and how long it took. He sat out the first two preseason games, acknowledging that he wasn't ready to try to reclaim his job. 
After playing less than one half on Monday night, the job was his. 
A crowd of 65,614 fans-the biggest ever for a preseason game in Cincinnati -went silent whenever Palmer got hit or took off running. It cheered every time he got up. And, it marveled at how well he played. Palmer went 9-of-14 overall for 140 yard:;. three touchdowns and a passer rating of 136.9 -about as good as it can get. 
By halftime, the Bengals had a 34-7 lead and their playoff swag­ger back, along with their start­ing quarterback. 
''I'm sure he answered all the critics' questions and all the doubts that everyone had in their minds," said Johnson, who didn't catch a pass. "We scored 34 in the first half. That is ridiculous. Imagine if we had the first team play the entire game. I nnnd not say more." 

Even coach Marvin Lewis hint­ed that Palmer had done bntter than nxpected -a rare conces­sion by a coach who likes to give the impression that he's on top of everything involving his team. 
"I can't say I'm all that sur­prised," Lewis said at halftime. "Maybe he was a little sharper than you'd expect, but we've seen him working every day for six months." 
Afterward, Lewis named him the starting quarterback for the season opener Sept. 10 in Kansas City. 
Perhaps the biggest test for Palmer was getting hit for the first time since his injury, which came on a 66-yard completion to Chris llenry. In an inter11sting bit of symmetry, his first completion on Monday also went to Henry. And, Palmer got hit again right after he released it. 
This time, Green Bay's Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila hit him around the waist and took him down. The lineman's 6-foot-4, 250­pound body landed on top of Palmer, a tame but telling hit. 
Concerned teammates immedi­ately checked on him. 
"I said, 'How do you feel?' He said, 'I feel great,"' receiver T.J. lloushmandzadeh said.

Associated Press 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich . -Cheryl Ford l-ed the Detroit Shock back to the WNBA finals with a tena­cious style that is reminis­cent of her dad, 14-time NBA All-Star Karl Malone. 
That is all well and good, but Ford is not fond of such comparisons. 
"Like I said before, I'm just trying to do my own thing, make my own name," Ford said Tuesday after practice at The Palace. 
The Shock will face. the defending champion Sacramento Monarchs in the best-of-five finals that begin Wednesday night. 

Malone sat courtside and watched his daughter help Detroit win the WNBA title three years ago, during her rookie season. He covered his eyes as the power forward sank four key free throws in the final minute of the decisive third game against Los Angeles, then embraced her when it was over. 
With all the numbers and accolades Malone gar­nered during his career, Shock coach Bill Laimbeer said Ford can be even bet­ter than her father. 
"Cheryl Ford arguably has been our most valu­able player all year long. Her rebounding has been 
IN BRIEF 
Martin placed on PUP list,
Pennington mimed starter 
NEW YORK-Curtis Martin will miss at least the first six weeks of the season. It could be the end of the 33-year-old running back's career. 
The NFL's No. 4 career rusher, who underwent knee surgery last December, was placed by the New York Jets on the regular-season physically unable to perform list on Tuesday. That means he will miss the first six weeks and the Jets will have 21 days to decide whether to activate him. 
The Jets also announced that Chad Pennington is their starting quarter­back. Pennington. who has under­gone shoulder surgery for two straight years, had been the starting QB throughout the preseason. But first-year coach Eric Mangini had not designated a starter from among Pennington, Patrick Ramsey, Brooks Bollinger and rookie Kellen Clemens. 
so consistent, she leads the league in rebounding," Laimbeer said. "Her inside presence, being able to score has been more than we expected this year." 
Much like the 2003 title team, Laimbeer's squad rolled through these play­offs with a dominating inside game, anchored by Ford. She is also averag­ing 11.8 rebounds in tiJe playoffs. 
"She's a beast," said teammate Katie Smith, an All-Star guard. "The sky is the limit for her. It's fun to be on the floor with some­body who competes, espe­cially rebounding. You don't have to worry about the rebounding too much because she can corral most of those." 

But star forward Swin Cash knows Ford can't do it alone . 
"It's going to be up to our guards, myself and Ruth (Riley) to really help Cheryl and not have her getting 30 rebounds and us getting like one or two," she said. "We have to col­lectively rebound as a group." 
Sacramento hasn't lost a game in these playoffs, eliminating Houston and Los Angeles. 
"We have to be mentally tough," Ford said. "If we let them knock us off focus, then boy we're in for a long series." 
Pacers sign gt!ard, two 
assistant coaches 
INDIANAPOLIS -The Indiana Pacers have signed guard Jimmie "Snap" Hunter and assistant coaches Johnny Davis and Leonard Perry. 
Hunter, a 6-foot-4 guard, played last season with the Gary Steelheads of the CBA and led the league with 27.6 points a game. In March, he signed with Etosa Alicante of the Spanish ACB, where he averaged 15.3 points and 3.7 rebounds in 12 games. 
Davis played for Indiana during 1978-82 and averaged 12.9 points and 
4. 5 assists during a 10-year NBA career. He has been a head coach twice, going 42-111 in stints with Philadelphia and Orlando, and was an assistant with the Minnesota Timberwolves last season. 
Perry had been in college coaching since 1994 and is taking his first NBA job. He went 48-97 in five years as the. head coach at Idaho before being fired in March following a 4-25 season. 
Hoosiers enter season loaded 
at running back 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind -Marcus Thigpen has the breakaway speed Indiana coach Terry Hoeppner craves, and Demetrius McCray offers the elu­siveness a college running back needs to stay healthy. 
After assessing the duo for the past month in practice, Hoeppner has final­ly made a decision: He'll play both in Saturday's season-opener against Western Michigan. 
If Hoeppner wanted a primary run­ner, he certainly didn't lend it any cre­dence. 
Rather, the Hoosiers coach plans on using four backs this weekend _ Thigpen, McCray, Bryan Payton and Josiah Sears. 
The running back competition was the most-watched duel of spring prac­tice, but when it didn't produce a clear­cut winner, the battle was rekindled in August. Again, neither pulled away in the competition, which now continues.

NCAA FOOTBALL 
Suspension ends for Purdue starter 
Boilermaker's return lineman Uche Nwaneri after fight last year 
Associated Press 
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. -Uche Nwaneri's return to Purdue's offensive line could turn the unit into one of the Big Ten's best. 
After starting every game at left guard two years ago, Nwaneri was suspended and missed last season because of a fight with then-teammate Ryan Noblet. Nwaneri is back for the senior year he expected to have last year, starting Saturday against Indiana State. 
"It's hard not to be able to do something you've been doing your whole life," he said. "It gave me a chance to contem­plate things I need to accom­plish, gave me a little more focus on things I need to do." 
Nwaneri had an emergency appendectomy last week, but still is listed No. 1 on the depth chart. Coach Joe Tiller hopes Nwaneri will be ready for Saturday's game. 
"Certainly, when he's in there, we're a better offensive line," Tiller said. 
All five starting offensive line­men have at least 11 career starts. Purdue's media guide lists four all-Big Ten candidates for the Boilermakers _ and three are linemen. Tackle Mike Otto has 36 career starts, more than any player on the team. Guard Jordan Grimes has 12 career starts and tackle Sean Sester has 11. 
Robbie Powell started 11 games in Nwaneri's place at left guard last season and has since moved to center. He won the team's Pit Bull Award for his play during the spring. Quarterback Curtis Painter said Powell has adjusted well and has done a good job of keeping the line working together. 
Purdue's offense ranked 25th nationally with 428.5 yards a game last season. Now, Nwaneri brings his athletic ability and improved strength to a unit that allowed nine sacks last season, second-fewest in the Big Ten. 
"I just want to add to it," he said. "I don't want to say that I'm going to make the line the best line there is, but we're all going to work hard to make this the best line it can possibly be." 
He said he's proud of the way the unit played last season, but was unhappy with the fact that Purdue went 5-6 last season and missed a bowl game for the first time since Tiller became coach in 1997. 
"It's never fun to sit there and watch your team lose and have problems like we did, but we're past that now." 
Tiller said Nwaneri weighs 318 pounds and is the most solid he's been. Tiller said Nwaneri's commitment to get­ting into shape has earned respect from his teammates.

Belles begin year at Tri-State Invite 
O'Brien shoots an 82 as team finishes seventh 
By BECKI DORNER Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's opened its 2006 campaign with a seventh-place finish at the Tri-State Invitational Saturday. 
The Belles recorded a cumu­lative squat total of 351, and Indianapolis took the team title with a final score of 308 at the par-73 5,828-yard Zollner Golf Course in Angola, Ind. 
Ball State followed closely in second place with a 310. The overall individual medalist was Indianapolis' Kristi Piepenbrink, who finished with a two-under-par 71. 
Saint Mary's junior Katie O'Brien led the Belles with an 82 -good enough to earn a tie for 20th place. A hole-in­one at the par-3 15th punctuated

"We had moments of bril­liance but we were more rusty than we should have been after a summer of playing golf," he said. "I was encour­aged with what I saw from the freshman group. I expect strong performances from them once they get adjusted to the college scene." 
The young Belles undoubted­ly have some big FootJoys to fill. Last year, the team gradu­ated four seniors, including MIAA league MVP and NCAA qualifier Megan Mattia, who departed after finishing 18th in the spring Division III national championships. 
For O'Brien, who returns with Sei as one of the leading contributors from last season's MIAA championship team, this year promises "a lot of poten­

Freshman Kate Dornbos recorded an 89, earning the second-lowest score for the Belles in her first collegiate event. Alex Sei and Claire Orfanos finished with 90s and Bri Baker rounded out the Belles score with a nine. Orfanos and Baker also com­peted in the first event of their collegiate careers. 
Belles coach Mark Hamilton acknowledged that the team's performance not as strong as 

athlete golfers, behind only Princeton and Yale. 
Hamilton reiterated that the team's goal is to repeat as league winners. 
"We need to work on consis­tency, stacking up the pars, and staying away from the big numbers [in order to repeat as champions!," he said. 
The Belles' next contest is the Ferris State Invitational this weekend.

Young Irish teatn has holes to fill this season 
After finishing fifth last year, ND looks to build on success 
By DAN TAPETILLO 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame heads into the 2006-07 season after placing fifth in the final ITA rankings -its best finish since becom­ing a Division I program in 1985-86. The Irish earned the mark after ending the year with a 27-2 record and reaching the NCAA quarterfi­nals. 
"It was an incredible year and I was definitely glad to be a part of it," said Notre Dame senior Catrina Thompson. "Everyone was such a delight to work with." 
Several changes have been made in the team's staff and lineup over the summer --a challenge as Notre Dame lost seniors Lauren Connelly, Kiki Stastny and Kelly Nelson. 
Connelly, the team captain last season, competed in dou­bles with Stastny at No. 3. The duo ended the season 37-6. 
Although Nelson only com­peted in two dual matches last season, she provided necessary wins for the team by finishing 2-0 and 13-2 in 2006. 
"All three [seniors! will be missed," senior Christian Thompson said. "It'll be very hard to replace [Connelly and Stastny] in doubles because we could always count on them for a win in several close matches last season." 
Notre Dame also lost its assistant head coach Michelle Dasso after she accepted a position as the head coach at Illinois. 
"[Dasso] was a huge part of our success last season and the team knows she will make a great coach at Illinois," sophomore Katie Potts said. 

Despite these losses, Notre Dame returns several key players -making the Irish a threat once again this sea­son. 
Leading the pack are the Thompson twins, who claimed the school's first­ever title in an ITA national championship last October. After peaking at No. 1 in the ITA rankings last season, the sisters finished the season at 
No.  10  and  with  a  22-7  
record.  
This  summer,  the  

Thompsons also claimed two professional tournaments in doubles. They were able to compete and maintain their collegiate eligibility by not accepting prize money. 
"This past summer is really­going to help their confi­dence." Potts said. "[The Thompsons] are going to have an incredible year." 
Also returning is junior Brook Buck, who played at No. 3 singles last season. Buck earned the ITA doubles title with teammate Kelcy Tefft and will compete in the Riviera/ITA All-American Championships Oct. 5-8 in Pacific Palisades, Calif. 
The final returnee is Potts, who competed at No. 6 for the team last season and fin­ished 23-2 in dual matches. 
Joining the team this sea­son are Cosmina Ciobanu, Colleen Rielley and Kali Krisik. These incoming fresh­men were ranked as the nation's top class by TennisRecruiting.net. The three combined for one dou­bles and five singles titles in ITA events this summer. 
"We're hoping to build upon the success we had last year," Christian Thompson said. "The freshman class won several singles titles this summer and I know they are going to really add depth for us."

Notre Dame will be tested this weekend when it wel­comes a pair of Golden State teams to the Inn at St. Mary's Classic at Alumni Field. The Irish face Southern California Friday at 7:30 p.m. followed by what is projected to be their toughest regular season opponent of the year -No. 9 Santa Clara Sunday at 1 p.m.

starters -defensive end Adamm Oliver, defensive tackle Joe Anoai, and line­backers KaMichael Hall and Philip Wheeler -return. The lone veteran in the secondary is Kenny Scott, a cornerback. 
A year ago, Georgia Tech's defense finished No. 13 in the country against the running game, but No. 52 against the pass, allowing 103.9 and 
213.6 yards per game, respectively. They finished No. 22 nationally in total defense. 
The offense boasts eight veterans -including All­American receiver Calvin Johnson, starting quarterback Reggie Ball and four offensive linemen -but new starters will sprinkle the field. Gailey isn't sure how they'll react in their first game under the lights -a game that also happens to be in prime time and against a possible nation­al championship contender.

three-year start­ing quarterback Reggie Ball, who will take the snap behind an offensive line returning four veterans. 
"It always starts with the quarterback," Weis said. "Any time you have a quarterback that's a dual threat, it's a con­cern.

Although it's hard to judge special teams outside of the game context, Weis said, he was confident about them as well. 
"I expect a very good per­formance," he said. 
Overall, Weis was unabashed about admitting he thinks that the team that will take the field against Georgia Tech on Saturday is better than the one that lost 34-20 to Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl. Specifically, he traees the improvement to the return of basically four starters on both the offensive and defensive lines. 

"Any time you have two vet­eran lines, you have to think that you have a chance," he said.

small things on an individual basis and large areas as far as certain teams, packages and groups," Gailey said. "You don't know. You have not seen anything, so you are waiting to see how it works out." 
The Yellow Jacket offense averaged less than 200 yards per game in the air last year -No. 89 in Division I-A. Rushing was 40 spots better at 153.8 yards per game. But the much-maligned numbers of last year's offense aren't Gailey's primary concern. 
"I think that's speculation, and [let's] wait and see what happens," he said. "The bot­tom line is to win the game ­it's not statistics." 
Running back Tashard Choice, in his first year as a starter, said a major offensive problem was mental mistakes and failing to capitalize on red-zone opportunities. 
"This year we understand that we want to pick up and improve from last year," he said during the teleconfer­ence. "You have to continue to get better from year to year. This year we're focused on capitalizing on mistakes made by the defense so we put points on the board, allowing us to rely on our defense and special teams." 
Winning isn't new to the Yellow Jackets -and highly ranked teams don't intimidate them, either. Last year, they beat then-No. 3 Miami and then-No. 15 Auburn. The Irish stand at No. 2 in the Associated Press poll and are tied for third in the coaches. 
Still, Gailey doesn't take Weis lightly. 
"[Weisl picks and chooses what he thinks his advantages are, and he does a really good job of creating advantages for his people," Gailey said. "That's what made them good last year." 
A new wrinkle in the Irish defense will be the addition of Travis Thomas, listed as the starter at weakside line­backer. 
"We don't know a thing about him at linebacker," Gailey said. "We'll just have to wait and see how he looks on the field." 
Gailey doesn't have long to wait.

Happy Birthday: You may have trouble making up your mind, and that will hold you back this year. Start jumping in with both feet, doing whatever has to be done to get you where you envision yourself being. You have so much insight this year that you shouldn't be second-guessing your every move. That is only a waste of valuable time, better used for accomplishing. Your numbers are 13, 15, 17, 29, 34,46 
ARIES (March 21-April 19): Stop taking everything so seriously. If something doesn't turn out the way you want, don't sweat it.

Weis prepares, Gailey questions 
Irish coach versed in all facets of Yellow Jackets' game plan 
By KATE GALES Associate Sports Editor 
Charlie Weis knows that Georgia Tech's two backup quarterbacks are left-handed. 
He watched tape of Henderson State dating back to 1999 and 2000 when Yellow Jackets offensive coordinator Patrick Nix was the head coach. 
And he knows how many pass interference plays have been called against All-America receiver Calvin Johnson's defenders-it's 16, if you were wondering. 
Notre Dame's second-year head coach enters Saturday night's 2006 season opener at Georgia Tech knowing every­thing there is to know about the Yellow Jackets.

Head Jacket .keeps 
young Tech team focused before opener 
By KATE GALES Associate Sports Editor 
The hype is deafening, and Chan Gailey is trying to stay focused on the questions his team has yet to answer. 
Gailey, Georgia Tech's head coach, is trying to limit the speculation and concentrate on his players -many wet behind the ears -and the game they will bring to Bobby Dodd Stadium Saturday. 
"You've got some guys who have not played extensively in games before, so you are anx­ious to see how they will react and handle themselves," he said Tuesday during his week­ly teleconference. 
Although the Yellow Jackets -who were 7-5 in 2005 ­return 15 starters, only five play on defense. Four of those

Kaelin making inunediate in1pact 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 
Notre Dame freshman Christina Kaelin was selected Monday as Big East Hookie of tho Week, only two days after the Irish hitter put in a 24-kill performance against Bowling Green. 
It was the first time an Irish player had accumulated more than 20 kills in a single match since current junior Ellen Heintzman had 22 kills in five games on Nov. 26, 2005. 
Kaolin, however, snt her mark in just three games. 
"A week ago I didn't know where I was going to be in the starting lineup," Kaelin said. "I thought it was a big shock -I didn't even know they gave out that award. It was a good honor." 
And the honor is only the start of a homecoming of sorts for the Louisville native. Born in South Bend, Kaelin moved away from the city at the age of two, but has always felt a connection with the school.

Two titles aren't enough for team 
Talented squad hopes to repeat 2004 finish 
By TIM DOUGHERTY Sports Writer 

When it comes to postseason hardware, Notre Dame women are gold diggers. Fifteen months after outlast­ing UCLA 1-1 in a shootout ( 4­
3) to bring home the pro­gram's second national cham­pionship in 2004, the Irish are mining as hard as ever for another piece of NCAA gold. 
The first time around was quite a rush, so much so that 2006 senior captain and defender Kim Lorenzen says she still can't transform her emotions into precise words, a feeling that the players around from the 24-1-1 2004 squad are having a hard time living without. 
"The perception is once you get one national champi­onship it's probably good enough for everyone, Lorenzen said. "To be honest, every season is new and all teams every year are differ­ent. Now this year we have to prove to everyone that it was­n't just a one-time thing. Notre Dame is a top team that can do it more than once." 
Senior midfielder Jill Krivacek, then a sophomore, scored the final goal of Notre Dame's 2004 season when her penalty kick eluded UCLA keeper Valerie Henderson, before an Erika Bohn save netted Notre Dame's second title. The win m.ade the Irish the first two-time champion· besides North Carolina, which has won 18. 
Portland equaled Notre Dame's feat last year when the Pilots won their second title, toppling the Irish 4-1 in the NCAA quarterfinals along the way. The Irish said the loss refocused the team and reignited its ambitions.
