New debit card system said to benefit students 
By JULIE BARREn Assistant News Editor 
Notre Dame Student Gov­ernment is looking into a debit card system for campus use which would eliminate the need for cash payments to University vendors, serve as identification, provide access to campus facili­ties and dorms, and act as a supplement to the established meal plan. 
Student Government has sent out questionnaires to assess students' opinions about im­plementing the card system and to determine which campus services and facilities should be targeted first. 
"Student government is hoping to use the results from the questionnaire to put pres­sure on the upper administra­tion to accept the new card sys­tem," said Associate Provost Andrew Hollander. 
The card would have several technologies incorporated on it, according to Phil Johnson, di­rector of Notre Dame Security. "There would be two magnetic stripes on it, each students' li­brary bar code and their pic­ture. It would be their identifi­cation card, their meal card, their detex card as well as a debit card." 
As a debit card, it would al­low students to add money to an account from which to deduct expenses on a per item basis. 
Students could use the card for services such as laundry, copying and vending machines, as well as for facilities possibly including The Bookstore, The Huddle and The Oak Room. 
"Students would no longer have to carry cash around with them," Johnson said. 
The card could also be used in place of a detex to enter resi­dence halls, he said. "The card would have a specific PIN number on it for the students to get into their dorms. This would make the dorms safer because if the card was lost, whoever found it wouldn't know the PIN number to get into the dorm." 
The new card system would be more cost effective and less problematic than the current one, Johnson added. 
"If the card system is on one computer database, as planned, it would be easier and faster to cancel the card if lost." Hollander said. 
The card could be replaced quickly, as well, Johnson said. 
"The new card could be in­stantly produced here at Notre Dame through video imaging or by an instant polaroid." he said. "The current ID's are sent off campus and take several

over dinner Sunday night, hoping to forge agreement on how to break Washington grid­lock and push through a quick­action agenda. 
"We've got a big job to do and we've got to do it together," Clinton said earlier in the day awaiting the arrival of Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, House Speaker Tom Foley and House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt. 
Clinton and his wife, Hillary, greeted their dinner guests in the driveway of the governor's mansion about 8 p.m. EST. Their meeting was expected to last at least three hours. 
It was their first meeting since Clinton's victory; the op­portunities were big, since this marks the first time Democrats will have control over both the White House and Congress in 12 years.

Homeless Week held to increase awareness 
BY MAn JEZIOR News Writer 
Notre Dame Student Gov­ernment is sponsoring NO for the Homeless Week, which be­gan last Saturday and ends this Saturday, to increase awareness on campus about the problem of homelessness, according to Whitey Griffin, who is coordinating the week with Kellie Abbott. 
"The main goal is just to get people to talk about [homelessness] some more, to try to make more people aware of this problem," Griffin said. 
The idea for having a week­long event came from last year's Homeless Day, which had a favorable turnout, according to Griffin. 
The week will include "Fireside Chats," small, per­sonal discussions to be held in various residence halls around campus. Featured at these chats will be actual homeless people, allowing students to talk with them one-on-one, Griffin said. The coordinators of the chats t--------------------------1 them from sexual assault and rape," said one South Bend woman in the march. 


The Saint Mary's Center for Women's Alliance was pleased with the turnout for the event, according to Sarah Miyata, co­president of the center. 
"I hope that a far greater number of women are aware of the increasing number of rapes and assaults than just those who have marched tonight," said Lauren Siragusa, a junior from Holy Cross.

said they are concerned that students may feel ashamed or guilty about having people who have so little in their dorms where the students have so much. 
"This makes it all the more important, because in order for us to understand who they are, we first have to realize who we are, and to appreciate all that we have," Griffin said. 
The week also includes a sleep-out Thursday at Stepan Center, directed by Fr. Tom McDermott of Campus Ministry, and Lou Nanni, director of the South Bend Center for the Homeless. The night will include films depicting home­less life, group discussions, guest speakers and mass, fol­lowed by a sleep-out, Griffin

Chalkings key to victory for ND football 
Two years back, Notre Dame Stadium lost one of its trademarks to flashy white interlocking NOs in each end zone and, a year later, to giant, golden-domed sesquicen­tennial logos. 
David Kinney 
In 1990, Notre Dame 

News Editor
fell to poor Stanford and Penn State teams at home. One year ago, the -------­Irish were a victim of a 24-point comeback against Tennessee, their only viable opponent to play in the Stadium. 
And in the first three home games this year, the team tied the overrated Michigan Wolverines and allowed Stanford to eclipse a 16-point deficit en route a 33-16loss. 
Two years ago, Notre Dame lost its heart, its ability to dominate opponents by wearing them down with a potent running attack. Two years ago, Notre Dame Stadium was stripped of its primitive end zone chalkings. Now, the diagonal white stripes are back, and so is Notre Dame's heart. 
It's difficult to argue that NO hadn't lost a step in the past two seasons. The fire seemed to be gone, the desire to win and the guts to defend Rockne's house were not there anymore. For fans, reacting to losses was easier, even at home. 
With the end zones returned to their primitive state this October, Notre Dame has won three straight. 
Was it the chalkings? 

It's tough to argue against them. Since 1987, Notre Dame has never lost a home game with primitive end zone chalkings. They represent the essence of what football in South Bend had come to be: no flash, no glitter, no dancing, just hard-hitting defense stopping the run and bullish offense intent on running the ball. 
It is an open stadium with grass and cold­weather contests. It is a black quarterback named Tony Rice and a firey nose guard called Chris Zorich. 
Notre Dame was the opposite of those dancing, undisciplined convict 'Canes in Miami, the sole force of good defending an age-old sport that was being infiltrated by flash, domes. turf and an unbridled passing game. 
It was in those days that Lou Holtz knew that miracles do happen, and that they seem to happen here more than anywhere else. But the miracles seemed to stop coming with the loss o the chalkings. 
After beating Miami in 1990, Notre Dame failed to win a big game against a quality opponent at home until this weekend. 
Indeed, the victory over Penn State was among the most satisfying in several years, after disappointing losses to Penn State in 1990, Tennessee in 1991 and a tie against Michigan this year. 
More impressive was that it was won on guts and spirit. Quarterback Rick Mirer showed the same determination that beat Michigan two years ago. And in a defensive battle, Notre Dame proved time and again that it was up to the task. 
But in the end, it was the primitive end zone chalkings that made the difference. 
Is the football of yesterday back at Notre Dame? Not quite. But the move back to chalkings could signal a rethinking of the team's philosophy. And if Lou Holtz leads, the Fighting Irish will follow.

The University of Notre Dame has received a grant of $100,000 from the Ralph M. Parsons Foundation, to be used to renovate the chemistry de­partment's undergraduate teaching labs. 
The award, along with con­tributions and other grants similar to the one recently re­ceived from the Kresge Foun­dation, will make up part of the estimated $8,000,000 needed to modernize and expand Nieuwland Science Hall, according to Paul Helquist, department chair of chemistry and biochemistry. 
Slated to begin in the spring of next year, the project should be completed by the end of 1993. 
According to Helquist, the facilities are in need of modern­ization. "The labs we have now are 40 years old," he said. "This project will bring the labs up to modern day standards." 
Founded in 1961, the Los Angeles based Parsons Foun­dation makes a total of $8,000,000 worth of grants yearly in amounts ranging from $1,000 to $1,000,000 to projects in the areas of social impact, health, civic and cul­tural, special projects and higher education. 
According to Chris Sisley, an officer of the foundation, the recipients of the foundation's 110 yearly grants are chosen from a pool of nearly 200 appli­cants and are judged on the qualification of their applica­tions and their proposed use of the funds. 
"Notre Dame was picked be­cause of the worthiness of our stated goal: to improve our science curricula," Helquist said. 
According to Helquist, the University has looked to 20 dif­ferent sources to raise the money needed to begin the Nieuwland Project, including corporations, private individu­als, alumni and other grants. Efforts in organizing funding are coordinated through both the administration and the Uni­versity Development Office. 
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) ­
U.S. senators investigating the fates of missing American ser­vicemen in Vietnam said Sun­day they will ask Vietnamese authorities for answers on spe­cific cases and for more docu­mentation. 
Three members of the Senate 
Select Committee on POW-MIA 
Affairs will begin a five-day 
visit to Vietnam and Laos on 
Monday. It will be the 
committee's last major trip be­
fore its final hearings and re­
port at the end of the year. 
The report could significantly 
affect the pace of normalizing 
relations with Vietnam. Presi­
dent Bush has linked that pro­
cess to Hanoi's cooperation in 
accounting for the MIAs. 
However, Bush has said no 
decision would be made before 
his term ends in January, so the 
issue will likely face President­
elect Clinton. 
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., the 
committee chairman, said he 
and Sens. Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
and Hank Brown, R-Colo. will 
discuss specific MIA cases with 
the Vietnamese. 
"We're going to be looking 
very hard at the 135 or so 
cases where there is the great­
est likelihood that something 
ought to be be able to be 
known about them, where they 
were either last known to be 
alive in captivity or where 
circumstances strongly indicate 
they should have been taken in 
captivity," he said. 
Kerry said he will also deliver 
to President Le Due Anh a 
letter from President Bush on 
the MIA issue that is meant "to 
encourage cooperation and to 
suggest good reasons for that." 
He would not elaborate. 
He said he believed it was the 
first time a U.S. president has 
written to his Vietnamese coun­
terpart since Richard Nixon, 
who left office in 1974. 
The Communists defeated the 
U.S.-backed South Vietnam 
government in 1975. Since 
then, Washington has isolated 
Vietnam and imposed an aid 
and trade embargo. 
The Bush administration has been lifting some restrictions ­such as allowing telecommuni­cations links -in return for Vietnam's cooperation in end­ing the Cambodian war and in accounting for the 2,266 Amer­ican MIAs.

Ending the week-long lecture series on Mary Wollstonecraft's works, author Frances Sher­wood discussed her forthcom­ing novel, "Vindication," which is based on Wollstonecraft's lifestyle, at a lecture last Friday entitled, "Mary, the Woman." 
"Vindication," a fiction novel, is based on the many loves of Wollstonecraft's life and will be published in May 1993, accord­ing to Sherwood. 
The novel is divided into five parts which focus on the five different loves in Woll­stonecraft's life, Sherwood said. Those loves include her child­hood friend, Fanny, her mentor, two lovers and her husband, William Godwin.

Spokesman says Bush recovering from election 
WASHINGTON (AP) President Bush returned to the White House on Sunday after a five-day Florida vaca­tion that his spokesman said had lifted the president's spirits and readied him for a "dignified and cooperative" final two months in power. 
"The president's in good spirits," Marlin Fitzwater, the presidential press secretary, told reporters just before Bush and his wife, Barbara, left Boca Grande, a quaint village on tiny Gasparilla Island off Florida's Gulf Coast. 
The president and Mrs. Bush flew by helicopter to nearby Fort Myers airport, where they parted company. Bush took Air Force One, a Boeing 747, back to Wash­ington, and Mrs. Bush flew a backup jet to Houston to go house hunting. 
Fitzwater said the Bushes had been deeply disap­pointed by the Nov. 3 election defeat but had used their time in Boca Grande to resign themselves to the loss. 
"You know, when you fight hard it's like a football game, really," Fitzwater said. "You put everything into it, you fought hard for six, eight months, you think you're gonna win. It's your whole life, and so it takes a day or two to turn around your thinking. But by this time everybody is in good shape." 
Fitzwater said Bush was committed to a graceful handoff of power to Bill Clinton. 
"He wants a smooth transi­tion. He wants it to be dig­nified and cooperative," the 

George Bush 
spokesman said. 
Fitzwater was asked about a New York Times report published Sunday that de­picted the president as in a state of despair and demor­alized over the defeat. 
"That's crazy," Fitzwater said. "We were all disap­pointed a few days after the election because we fought long and hard. But he's had plenty of time to start think­ing about the future." 
It was not clear how much Fitzwater knew about Bush's state of mind, however. In an earlier conversation with re­porters on Sunday before leaving Florida, he said he hadn't spoken with the presi­dent since he arrived there last Wednesday. 
Outwardly, at least, Bush did appear in better spirits his last two days in Boca Grande.

Professors help cover staff pay cuts 
BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -It wasn't often that Santa Claus' name was heard in the solemn halls of the Louisiana State Uni­versity economics department -until some professors cov­ered their secretaries' pay cuts out of their own pockets. 
In the music department, too, the faculty is pitching in to reimburse its staff for the week's pay the university took away to offset a midyear cut in state funds. 
"Some of these are single people, and some are single mothers. And we didn't feel like this is a very good plan," said Loren Scott, who chairs the economics department. 
Secretary Donna Burton, who is divorced and raising an 8­year-old son while taking night courses, said a $400 salary cut would have hit her hard. 
"I was starting to panic about Christmas even. You know, like telling my son about there's no Santa Claus," she said. "It turns out, there is a Santa Claus." 
Louisiana state government is cutting $93 million this year, $45 million of it to come from higher education. That includes $9.3 million from LSU's Baton Rouge campus, which is raising tuition, cutting salaries, and freezing hiring, travel and equipment purchases. 
For the staff, an across-the­board 2 percent pay cut was in­stituted to save the school $1 million. Tenured faculty can't be forced to take a pay cut so they're being asked to volunteer 2 percent. 
Katherine Kemler, a music professor, said her department's faculty cheered at a meeting in response to a suggestion that they pitch in $50 each to reimburse 10 members of the support and custodial staff. They'll try to have the money to them by Christmas. 
"The staff people don't have a choice, they make significantly lower salaries than we do and they're even less able to afford it than we can," she said.

Investigation of murder broadened 
VENTURA, Calif. (AP) Prosecutors plan to broaden an investigation into the death of a millionaire rancher who was shot by deputies during a drug raid in which no drugs were found. 
Ventura County District At­torney Michael Bradbury said preliminary findings indicate that the Oct. 2 shooting was justifiable because 61-year-old Donald Scott, partially blinded by recent cataract surgery, threatened deputies with a loaded handgun. 
But Bradbury said those findings will not be released until he has more thoroughly investigated the scope and pur­pose of the raid on Scott's ranch home in the Malibu area. 
"I have concerns about the entire operation," Bradbury said. "I have asked for an addi­tional investigation. I will be personally reviewing all of this material." 
The shooting led to allega­tions that the raid by about two dozen officers was motivated by a desire to seize Scott's prop­erty, rather than illegal drugs. He had refused to sell his ranch to the federal government .

The three-stage Soyuz rocket blasted off from the once-secret Plesetsk space center near the northern Russian port of Archangel. 
Mounted on the rocket is the Resurs 500 satellite and des­cent module, which will orbit Earth for about five days before splashing down in international waters about 200 miles off the coast of Washington state.

KARLOVAC, Croatia (AP) ­Prisoners released from a Serb­run detention camp in Bosnia, thin and wan from months of confinement, on Sunday praised the Red Cross and the camp commander for making sure they survived. 
More than 700 prisoners, mostly men over 55 years old, were released from the Man­jaca camp on Saturday and bussed to safety in the Croatian town of Karlovac southwest of the republic's capital, Zagreb. 
They joined about 1,000 former camp inmates released on Oct. 1 and still waiting for resettlement in third counties. 
The men waited for food coupons late Sunday, exhausted by their ordeal. 
But in contrast to tales of beatings, torture and murder from other camps, these de­
tainees said they  were  not  
abused.  
"We  can  only  thank  the  

camp's commander, retired Yugoslav army Col. Bozidar Popovic, who did not allow anybody to slaughter us," said Sead Hadzikotnic, a 42-year-old locksmith from Doboj, a town 37 miles east of Manjaca. 
He was swept from his home by Serb soldiers in early June and had been at Manjaca ever since. 
"In the beginning we were literally starving," said Muhamed. The 53-year-old man did not want to give his family name to protect relatives remaining in Manjaca. 
He said the prisoners were given only a half piece of bread and a square of salami a day until the International Commit­tee of the Red Cross began bringing in foo.d daily late in the summer. 
''I'm still weak, I can't stand for a long time," he said, his bones showing though his sal­low skin. "Only God and the ICRC existed for us." 
He said his village of Gornja Sanica, near Kljuc in western Bosnia, had been of its non­Serbian population back in June. 



Krylov, an oceanographic re­search vessel, plans to fish the module out of the Pacific and take it to Seattle on Nov. 24, two days before Thanksgiving. 
In Seattle, officials are plan­ning receptions, art shows, folk song and dance performances, and a tour of the Krylov. Hun­dreds of Russian sailors, digni­taries and others are expected to be on hand.

Theresa of Calcutta claims that poverty in the United States is worse than poverty in India. Even though poverty is more acute in such countries as India, the masses are able to share a commonality in their poverty. In the United States the poor are forced to live in the midst of one of the wealthiest nations in the history of civilization, and are viewed by many as failures, bums, drug addicts, alcoholics and rejects of society. It is this mentality which the homeless person must confront on an every day basis. Many homeless persons were reared in dysfunctional families and many feel very acutely the rejection and marginalization from society. This mentality leads to low self-esteem and often loss of hope. Hopelessness and isolation are the most difficult obstacles which the homeless person must confront.

Eagle on 18 lifts Love at Kapalua 
KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) ­Davis Love eagled the par-5 18th hole from 40 feet Sunday to break a tie with Mike Hulbert and win the $800,000 Kapalua International golf tournament. 
Love's final round of 6-under­par 67 gave him a total of 15­under 275 and the winner's purse of $150,000. 
Three times Love has finished second at Kapalua, including last year when Hulbert came from four shots back to catch Love in the last round and then beat him with a birdie on the first hole of a playoff. 
This time Love turned the ta­bles, coming from four shots behind Hulbert, who finished alone in second at 276 after a closing round of 72 on a windy day at the Kapalua Resort's par­73 Plantation Course. 
In addition to being tied at the end of regulation play last year, Love and Hulbert were dead­locked again atop the leader board after this year's first round. 
At the end of two rounds, they were still tied, this time one shot off the pace. And on Sun­day, with only one hole to go, they were tied again after Hul­bert birdied No. 17. 
But Love settled the matter with his dramatic eagle on the 18th. 
'It feels a lot better than it did a year ago," Love said. "I knew I'd have to make eagle to avoid the playoff because you knew he (Hulbert) was going to make

birdie. 
"I made a couple of long putts today, which is unusual for me. The one at 18 was just icing on the cake. It was a lot of fun," he said.. 
Playing one group behind Love, Hulbert watched from the fairway as Love rolled in his uphill putt. He knew then that he needed an eagle to get into a playoff. 
Hulbert gave it a bold try, hit­ting his second shot 30 feet to the left of the pin, then sliding his eagle putt less than a foot by on the right of the hole. 
He had to settle for birdie and the second place money of $91 000

Miami maintained its solid grip on the top spot with a 48-0 victory over Temple. The Hur­ricanes received 61 first-place votes and 1,549 points from a nationwide panel of sports writers and broadcasters. 
Alabama, which beat Missis­sippi State 30-21, was the run­ner-up again with one first­place vote and 1,483 points. 
If Miami (9-0) and Alabama (10-0) remain undefeated and 1-2 in the poll, they will meet for the national title Jan. 1 in the Sugar Bowl. Miami has games remaining against Syra­cuse and San Diego State, while Alabama must play Auburn and either Florida or Georgia in the Southeastern Conference championship game.

the opening kickoff using a combination of passes to Adrian Jarell and Irv Smith and runs by Brooks, Dean Lytle and Lee Becton, but had to settle for the first of Craig Hentrich's three field goals in the game. 
Mirer has a solid day for Notre Dame completing 12 of 23 attempts for a touchdown and 164 yards. The rushing crew, slowed by the snow, managed 201 yards for the game led by Bettis' 89 yards on 15 attempts and Brooks' 78 yards on a career-high 23 at­tempts. Smith topped the Irish receivers with four receptions for 59 yards. 
Penn State stole away the lead near the end of the first quarter when Mirer, under pressure, overthrew Lytle at the Penn State 15-yard line and Nittany Lion free safety Lee Rubin picked off the ball. 
Penn State mounted a scoring drive of its own highlighted by a 15-yard pass which split end Tisen Thomas turned into a 46­yard play by dancing down the sideline to the Irish 14. The touchdown came when, on his third try, tailback Ritchie Anderson (26 for 73) made it over the top and into the endzone. 
In retrospect, what happened after the touchdown gave the end of the game meaning. On the point after attempt, fresh­man Bobby Taylor got some hangtime and blocked V.J. Muscillo's kick for what would become the Irish's one point advantage. 
The Notre Dame offense, stalled by the snow and the Penn State defense, tied up the game in the waning minutes of the first half on another Hen­trich field goal, this one for 31­yards. Freshman Derrick Mayes kept this scoring drive going after literally stealing the ball

Penn State bounced right back in the fourth quarter with a touchdown after taking over on downs at its own 34-yard line and Penn State quarter­back Kerry Collins (7 of 28, 131 yards) leading the team to the one-yard line. The Irish defense led by Devon McDonald and Demetrius DuBose stood tough preventing the Nittany Lions from scoring the touchdown on three tries and forcing the field goal which tied the game at nine. 
The drama at the finale was set up by a Penn State touch­down late in the game which came after Smith fumbled the ball near midfield. Anderson, 0.

•1992-Payback time. 
The close games against Penn State usually didn't go Notre Dame's way over .the past decade, but Saturday all the frustration melted away with the snow at Notre Dame Sta­dium. 
Mter Rick Mirer engineered a long scoring drive in the final minutes, the Irish once again needed to execute a two-point conversion to shake off their long-time nemesis. 
A fierce pass rush forced Mirer out of the pocket, but he rolled right and released just before he got hit. The pass sailed toward the back of the endzone, and so did Brooks. And when the ball and Brooks met, Notre Dame had finally won a close one against the Nit­tany Lions. 
The series couldn't have ended any other way. 
"It was a typical Notre Dame­Penn State game," Irish coach Lou Holtz said. "We're going to miss playing this game, they're are a class team." 
Others in the Notre Dame locker room echoed Holtz's sentiments. 
"I love playing Penn State, it's always so competitive," junior Jeff Burris said. "There is al­ways added enthusiasm sur­rounding this game. I will miss it a lot." 
So will college football.

First win still eludes improving Irish hockey team 
By BRYAN CONNOLLY Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame hockey team earned its first point of the sea­son this weekend by tying the University of Illinois-Chicago Flames in the UIC Pavilion. 
After falling to the Flames by a score of 3-2 on Friday night, the Irish journeyed to Chicago on Saturday night and came back from a three goal deficit in the third period to claim a 4-4 tie. 
In a physical contest, the Irish (0-8-1 ), fell behind early in the series opener at the Joyce ACC as the Flames (3-5-1) took a 2-0 lead in the first period. Notre Dame captain Matt Osiecki scored on a power play with just under two minutes remaining in the period to bring the Irish to within a goal. 
Freshman defenseman Garry Gruber tied the game at two midway through the second period with the second Irish power play goal of the night. 
However, Notre Dame con­tinued to struggle while at even strength and was unable to sustain any pressure in the UIC zone until late in the third pe­riod. 
Shannon Finn scored the game winning goal for the Flames on a two-on-one break with 7:59 remaining in the third period. UIC was able to withstand an intense Irish at­tack over the last few minutes of the game to hold on to its victory. 
Brent Lothrop made 26 saves on the evening for the Irish as Notre Dame out shot UIC 35-29. 
Irish coach Ric Schafer was very disappointed after the loss, saying, "This was a step backwards as far as I'm con­cerned." 
"This is one team in the 
league which we are more on par with than any other team in the league," Schafer said, "Maybe the players thought that would be the case." 
The hockey team responded to its poor showing on Friday by playing much more inspired hockey the following night. 
Freshman Matt Bieck scored his first goal of the season four minutes and four seconds into the game to give the Irish a 1-0 lead which lasted until the Flames scored on the power play with forty nine seconds left in the first period. 
Despite being out shot by the Irish in the first two periods 27­18, UIC managed to take a 2-1 lead into the third period, where it netted two early goals to take a 4-1 lead. 
The Irish responded to the deficit with an intense offensive attack led by captain Dave Bankoske. Bankoske sparked the Irish resurgence with two power play goals, the frrst com­ing nine minutes into the final period. 
Cutting to the middle of the UIC zone, Bankoske received freshman Jamie Ling's pass from the corner and rifled it from the slot through Flamer goalie Jon Hillebrandt's pads. He scored his second goal two minutes and forty three seconds later on a pass from behind the net by senior Eric Gregoire. 
The Irish tied it up with only two minutes and forty seconds left in the game when freshman Jamie Morshead scored his second short handed goal of the season with Ling assisting again. 
Notre Dame managed three shots on goal during the score­less overtime period while holding the Flames to none. 
Carl Picconatto saved twenty eight shots for Notre Dame as

The Irish know that they will need to build on this weekend's effort if they are to have sue­cess next weekend against Western Michigan, which is currently ranked lOth in the nation. They are hoping that the momentum they gained from this weekend's tie will carry over into the coming weekend's competitions and lead them to their first victory of the season.

Women finish fourth at District meet Notre Dame volleyball 
By MIKE NORBUT 
Sports Writer 
For approximately twenty minutes Saturday, Bloomington, IN. was the sight for a scene of mass disorder, as the Notre Dame women's cross country team took on 205 other runners from 29 other schools located across the Midwest at the NCAA District IV Meet. 
As the final competitor crossed the finish line, the Irish found themselves with an im­pressive fourth place finish with 115 points, sandwiched in between five Big Ten powers. 
The University of Wisconsin won the meet with 35 points, defeating district favorite Michigan, who finished with 54 points. Both teams automati­cally advanced to the NCAA Championships November 23. 


The University of Iowa fin­ished third with 105 points, and should qualify for an at large bid. Notre Dame will find out this afternoon if they were awarded an at large bid and a chance to compete in next Monday's national champi­onship race. 
"We were ranked fifth going in to the race, so we did better than everyone expected us to," said sophomore Sarah Riley, who finished 16th in the race. "Everyone ran well, and we also ran really well as a team." 
Clare Eichner, a senior from Wisconsin, won the race, fol­lowed by Tracy Morris from Iowa and Michigan runners Karen Harvey and Molly Mc­Climon. Eichner, Morris, and Harvey advanced individually to

arbitrator, the finish line. 
When the starting gun fired, Notre Dame fought for position. After 3000 meters it was clear the Notre Dame would hold nothing back, the Fighting Irish were no longer a team but a squadron on a mission to the national championships. 
Notre Dame's top runner, all­American Mike McWilliams, head off early to keep pace with a lead pack that included Olyp­ian Bob Kennedy. Irish captain and all-American John Coyle stayed back with his team and brought three of the top five runners through the middle miles. When Coyle headed out on his own, sophomore Nate Ruder stepped into the position of leadership. As fifth Irish runner J.R. Meloro said, "We owe a lot to Nate Ruder. He really brought us together. Nate was being the leader out there." 
Ruder brought with him Meloro and freshman phenom Derek Seiling. Half way through the race the Irish were running as a team. Out of the

the NCAA Championships. 

For the Irish, Riley's 16th place finish set the pace, fol­lowed closely by Stefanie Jensen (17th) and Eva Flood (19th). Kristi Kramer finished 35th, and captain Lisa Gorski was 41st. 
"Last year we finished in 11th place, and no one really ex­pected anything from us this year," continued Riley. "Next year I think we'll be able to do even better." 
Whether or not they receive an at large bid to the NCAA Championships the Notre Dame women's cross country team had an extremely strong showing Saturday, and has established itself as a national power. 
231 individuals fighting for po­sition, there was a cluster of blue and gold jerseys doing it together. 
When it was over, the Irish had the done far more than make the cut. They placed sec­ond in the meet behind Wis­consin, beating Michigan by 26 points and demolishing Eastern Michigan by 37. 
"It's a great feeling to have gone down there and accom­plish what we had set to do," said Irish Captain John Coyle. 
"This has been one of our goals all year long," said Irish head coach Joe Piane. "It was the best we ran all season." 
The question is, can they do it again? Can Notre Dame go to another big meet and put forth a team effort. The competition a week from now will be even greater than what they faced this weekend. 
"I think that we can run even better than we did. We have the potential to do some really great things at the Nationals," said Piane. 
As Coyle put it, "Only half of the goal has been met. Next week we've got to go down to Nationals and bring back some hardware." 
dominant in home finale 
By DANIEL PIER 
Sports Writer 

If the Notre Dame women's volleyball team could have writ­ten a script for Saturday's final home match, it would probably have read much like the match turned out, but with one excep­tion. The team might have agreed to show visiting LaSalle a little more mercy. After all, the Explorers made the trip all the way from Philadelphia only to score a mere three points in a 15-0, 15-3, 15-0 shellacking. 
Coupled with a 15-6, 15-5, 15-12 win over Duquesne ear­lier in the day, the win com­pleted an undefeated Midwest Collegiate Conference regular season for the Irish. Notre Dame (27 -5, 7 -0) will have the first seed in next weekend's MCC Tournament. If the Irish win that meet or get an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament, they could host a first-round match in the NCAAs. 
Five of Notre Dame's six se­niors started the match, but no one would have guessed it was an unusual lineup. The Irish swept past the Explorers quickly in the first game, led by senior Jessica Fiebelkorn's six kills in seven attempts. Despite the thrilling performance for the departing seniors. Fiebelkorn was one of several with mixed emotions. 
"I feel extremely sad; it's very emotional." said the star middle blocker. "But this season has been absolutely incredible, beyond anything I thought we could accomplish." 
Notre Dame scored the first nine points of the second game before LaSalle finally cracked the scoreboard when Notre Dame had its first of just five hitting errors on the night. Seniors Marilyn Cragin and Alicia Turner came up with five kills and four digs, respectively. 

Andrea Armenta 
Turner looked back happily at the time she and her class­mates have spent in Notre Dame uniforms. 
"It's been an incredible four years," said the team captain. "I don't regret a thing. I love all of my teammates, and they are what I'll miss the most." 
In the third game, the seniors started once again and left the match one by one to rousing ovations. The loudest cheers from the Notre Dame bench came for Andrea Armento, who made her first ever appearance in the front row and pounded out two kills, a team high for the game. 
All the Irish seniors con­tributed substantially to the dominance. Majenica Rupe had two solo blocks and two block assists, while Cynthia May contributed three kills with no errors in five attempts. Without forgetting that her team still has work to do, head coach Debbie Brown took the chance to enjoy the home fi­nale. 
"It was a lot of fun," said Brown of the match. "We got the opportunity to play every­one, especially the seniors, and we played really, really well. It will be a special memory for them."

Heroics lift Irish over Penn State 
MIKE 
SCRUDATO 
Random Thoughts 

Notre Dame seniors leave as w1nners 
Notre Dame's outgoing seniors had been haunted by one thing throughout their careers-losing at home due to turnovers. 
And for the first 56 minutes of their final home game, it looked as if they would close out their four years at Notre Dame Stadium doing just that. 
The vaunted Irish offense never seemed to get on track and when it did, it turned the ball over. 
The defense, which was again impressive, finally cracked after Irv Smith's fumble at midfield. When Brian O'Neal put Penn State up 16-9, a third straight loss to Penn State seemed almost inevitable. 
But, Rick Mirer then decided to leave Notre Dame Stadium the way he entered as a starter almost three seasons ago against Michigan-leading the Irish on a game-winning drive. 
Though he overlooked an open receiver or two, Mirer did something a lot of people wondered if he could still do. With time running out and the pressure on, he marched the Irish to the game-winning score. He got the job done. 
Now, when people look back at Mirer's time here, they will not recall his bad days or his tendency to float balls over the middle, they will think of Rick Mirer, the "Golden Boy" and engineer of the drive that sent Penn State to the Big Ten hanging its head. 
He made a great first impression and an even better final impression to the 59,075, and those are the most lasting. 
A few other seniors made some terrific memories of their own. Years from now when we are telling our grandchildren about this season, Reggie Brooks will not be the one who went from "weak link" to 1000-yard rusher. He will be the tailback, with what Lou Holtz described as "bad hands," who made the biggest play around here since Pat Terrell knocked down a two-point conversion attempt against Miami in 1988. 
Irv Smith will not be the one that
, 
almost fumbled the rivalry away, he will be the six-foot-four, 246-pound tight end with an ear-to-ear grin sitting on the shoulders of a delirious bunch of students. 
Then, there will be the defense. It started creating its image a few weeks ago, and continued to do so on Saturday. It will not be the bend-but­don't break unit that seemed to sur­render about 500 yards of offense per week. Rather, the defense that allowed Demetrius DuBose, Devon McDonald and Karmeeleyah McGill to close their home careers by virtually shutting down BYU, Boston College and Penn State. 
The seniors as a whole, will not be the best class not to win a national championship, but the class that did something no class since Tony Rice and the class of 1990 did. 
They walked out of Notre Dame Stadium as winners.

Do or die. 
That was the situation for the Notre Dame football team going into the last 25 seconds of its 17-16 win over the Nittany Lions of Penn State, according to Irish quarterback Rick Mirer. 
With the ball on the four yard line on fourth down, it was crunch time for the Irish. Using what would normally be the Irish's two-point conversion play, Mirer took the snap and with plenty of time from the offensive line, found fullback Jerome Bettis open in the endzone to bring Notre Dame within a point. Playing for the win, Irish head coach Lou Holtz called for a two-point conversion. 
With a semi-frozen capacity crowd on its feet, the final seconds of the game ticking away and with the Penn State de­fense pursuing, Mirer spotted tailback Reggie Brooks in the corner of the endzone and unleashed a pass that landed on the diving Brooks' fingertips and in the scorebook as the Irish took a decisive one-point advantage. The crowd went crazy as the Notre Dame team won its final home game of the season for the first time since 1989.

Notre Dame, Nittany Lions end classic series in classic fashion 
By JASON KELLY 
Sports Writer 
It was a classic ending to a classic series. 
Notre Dame's 17-16 win over Penn State was another in a long line of fantastic finishes that have turned the annual Notre Dame-Penn State game into one of college football's greatest rivalries. 
But Saturday's game marked the end to the series as Penn State prepares to join the Big Ten. 
"It has been a great series and it's too bad it has to end," Penn State coach Joe Paterno said after Saturday's game. "It has been good for college football. It seems like every game, with the exception of last year (a 35-13 Penn State win) ended like this." 
When the excitement of Reggie Brooks' game-winning catch subsides, the Notre Dame-Penn State series will fade into history. 
But the memories of the frigid November battles that have decided championships and created heroes will never fade. 
•1982-Notre Dame was 6-1-1 and fresh off an upset of top-ranked Pittsburgh, and Penn State was once­beaten and ranked fourth. National championship implications loomed large as the teams battled under the lights at Notre Dame Stadium. 
With the Irish leading 14-13 after three quarters, hopes were high. But they were soon dashed as Penn State quarterback Todd Blackledge connected with Curt Warner for a 48-yard touch­down pass, giving the Nittany Lions a lead they would never relinquish. 
The national championship awaited Penn State, and a 6-4-1 recGrd loomed ahead for the Irish. 
•1986 -Lou Holtz's first season with Notre Dame. A season of near comebacks and close shaves against the nation's best teams that earned the Irish nothing more than respect and six losses. 
With third-ranked Penn State leading 24-13 early in the fourth quarter, it looked like Notre Dame would once again fall to a ranked opponent. Like so many times in the 1986 season, the Irish did lose, but they threw quite a scare into Joe Paterno's troops in the process. 
Steve Beuerlein directed a 64-yard scoring drive early in the final period to bring the Irish to within 24-19. And with 
2:29 left, the Irish had the ball and a chance to win. 
It was first and goal from the six in the final minute, but Penn State's defense would hold, as Beuerlein's fourth-down pass from the 18 to Mark Green left the Irish short of the goal line. 
Another national title for Penn State, another tough loss for Notre Dame. 
•1987 -A resurgent Notre Dame team traveled to the snows of Pennsylvania to stake its claim as a national title con­tender. Sophomore Tony Rice was at the controls of the versatile Irish offense that had beaten the likes of Michigan, U.S.C. and Alabama. 
After a late Irish touchdown, only a successful two-point conversion separated Notre Dame from victory. 
But Tony Rice was stopped short on an

courage of our football team. We had a similar situation in '87. We scored with 30 seconds left and went for the two­point conversion, and lost the game 21­
20. I've never had a football team drive the length of the field in the last minute of the game and have to make a two­point conversion and do it," said Holtz. "I thought Rick Mirer was outstanding today." 
And then added with a smile. 
"You won't believe this, but Reggie Brooks has bad hands. He wouldn't be the first guy I'd want to throw to." 
Mirer admits that he eouldn't have written a better ending to the game. 
''I'm excited. That's the way to go out. Two groups (of seniors) haven't had a chance to win their last game at home," said Mirer. "This is as close to the feeling I had after the Michigan game my sophomore year. It felt good." 
For fellow senior, Brooks, the play featured one of his best catches ever. 
"I just remember catching the ball and then just looked up and saw the referee signal the touchdown. A lot of emotion swelled up in me and I just thanked God. I couldn't thank him enough," said Brooks. 
The drama in the final seconds of the game shifted the focus away from the hard-nosed defensive battle that dominated the other 59 minutes of the game. Snow that fell for a good portion of the game blanketed the field, making the yard lines hard to see. the footballs slick and the footing tricky in addition to forcing the defenses to dig in for an effort featuring mud-caked uniforms and turf­encrusted helmets that would have made NFL sportscaster and former coach John Madden proud. 
The Notre Dame defense controlled the field and effectively shut down the Penn State offense for most of the game. DuBose led the team in tackles with 12 and Bryant Young had two sacks for 13 yards. John Covington had the only Irish interception in the game after fellow defensive back Tom Carter tipped the ball. 
The Irish opened the game by marching 53 yards down the field after

Men's cross country earns NCAA bid 

By SEAN SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
The stage was set on a cool November afternoon. 
The Notre Dame men's cross country team was to meet with the University of Michigan, the University of Eastern Michigan, the University of Wisconsin and 31 other schools last Saturday to decide who would go to the national championships. 
It's the toughest district in the nation. Four teams are in the top 12. only three go on to nationals. 
While the field is consistently strong Wlseonsin is the clear favorite. The Badgers, ranked second in the nation, are strong contenders in this meet as well as the nationals. Notre Dame had faced Michigan and Eastern Michigan earlier this year. The lrish beat Michigan handily, but had surpassed Eastern Michigan by only one point. This victory had not convinced the pollsters and going into Districts Notre Dame was ranked lOth and Eastern Michigan was ranked 9th. 
However Michigan could not be counted out. The Wolverines were a far greater threat than before. They had improved dramatically since their previous meeting with the Irish and had recently levelled the field at the Mid· America Championships. 
But previous records and national polls mean nothing in the districts. The only judge is the dock and the only
