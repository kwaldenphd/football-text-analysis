Elephants turn Orange Bowl into circus

What sticks in my mind about the Orange Bowl -pardon me, the Federal Express Orange Bowl-is "A Twist of Orange," one of the most ridiculous halftime shows I've ever seen. 
I suppose elaborate halftime shows are to be expected now, and perhaps I haven't watched enough bowl games to become immune to the glitz of prime-time college football, but elephants doing headstands on a football field is a bit much. 
I wasn't in Miami for the Orange Bowl, so I watched it on TV. NBC devoted a few minutes to the Notre Dame and Colorado marching bands. most of which was inter­rupted by eommcrcials and sports commen­tators. The network did a great job, how­ever, of covering "A Twist of Orange," featuring Chubby Checker, dancing elephants, and Paul Williams in a leather jacket. (Boy, was he a hot-looking speci­men.) 
The medley of songs ranged from the ex­pected to the bizarre. Some songs are not meant to be performed at a halftime show. and Em1~rson, Lake and Palmer's "Karn Evil #9" is one of them. I knew we were in trouble when the show opened with 
"Weleome back my friends to the show that rwv1~r ends, we're so glad you could attend... " 
It seems the Orange Bowl officials, net­work nxecutives, or whoever comes up with these halftime productions believes the show draws big ratings. Viewers didn't tune in to hear Paul Williams sing or see circus elephants prance across the field; they tuned in to watch #1 Colorado play #4 Notre Damn. The emphasis is on the two sdwols during the game, and that's where it should be at halftime. 
Instead of showing celebrities sing and dance (and massacre classic rock tunes) the networks might focus on the schools' marching bands. During the season. the rwtworks cut away from the game at half­time to giw updates on other college games, so viewers usually don't see the bands perform. 
If the networks are adamant about tele­vising the halftime show during bowl games, why don't they showcase the univer­sity bands that have been working so hard all year? 
If football players represent their schools during the game, why can't the bands rep­resent their schools during halftime? I'd rather watch any college band do "Louie, Louie" at halftime than see those dancing elephants again.

A Vietnam veteran who lost his ability to speak when he suffered a stroke seven years ago is among 30 contestants competing in a special Hoosier Lottery program Friday in Evansville. Michael Graham, 40, may make his choices by using paper and pencil in vying for a chance at the $1 million top prize. The former construction worker has collected disability since two strokes four years apart left him mute and walking with a limp, and able to communicate only with a number and letter board. 
Hoosier Lottery profits will not be used for capital improvements at the local level. The state Senate voted against a proposed bill Wednesday which would have set aside 25 percent of the profits for such measures, instead opting to sup­port the fledgling Build Indiana Fund, which will use lottery projects to build new buildings, bridges and roads at all levels of government.

$12 mil. in gifts adds business complex to new quad 
By JOHN O'BRIEN Assistant News Editor 
The University of Notre Dame has received $12 million in gifts which will be u!fed to under­write the construction of a new complex to house the College of Business Administration. 
The complex, to be located on the new DeBartolo quadrangle, will be underwritten by gifts from University Trustee Donald Kelly, 1959 alumnus Vincent Naimoli and an anonymous donor. 
"We accept these major con­tributions to the future of busi­ness scholarship at Notre Dame with gratitude and antic­ipation," said University Presi­dent Father Edward Malloy in a press release. "In the area of business ethics particularly, we look forward to further en­
DART-ing dilemmas 
hancing the strength of our business programs," he said. 
John Keane, Gillen dean of the College of Business Admin­istration, called the announce­ment "wonderful news. We're grateful to all; the donors, the administration and everyone who helped make the complex a reality." 
"This new complex will help to ensure the continued excel­lence of the College's under­graduate program and, at the same time, will foster its growth at the graduate level," said University Provost Ti­mothy O'Meara in the press re­lease. 
The new complex is expected to provide some 80,000 square feet of floor space for class­rooms, offices and program centers, as well as library, computer and research facili­ties, said Keane in the press re­lease. 

The anchor building of the complex will be underwritten by a $6 million gift from Kelly and will house the College's faculty and administration. Gifts of $3 million each from Naimoli and the anonymous donor will un­derwrite two pavilions housing the College's research center and its graduate studies and seminar rooms. 
According to O'Meara, the new complex is expected to be completed in mid-1993. The College is currently housed in Hurley Hall of Business Admin­istration, completed in 1932, and Hayes-Healy Center, com­pleted in 1968. 
According to Keane, the new business complex will house all aspects of the College "except for the undergraduates" who will use the Edward J. DeBar­tolo Classroom facility, part of the original gift that estab­lished the quadrangle. 

Kelly, a university trustee since 1987, is president and chief executive officer of D.P. Kelly & Associates, L. P. He was a member of the College of Business Administration Advi­sory Council from 1976 until 1988 and served as chairman of the University's Sorin Soci­ety, an organization of Notre Dame benefactors, from 1981 until1984. 
Naimoli is chairman of the board, president and chief ex­ecutive officer of Anchor indus­tries. He was graduated from Notre Dame in 1959 with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and has been a member of the College of Busi­ness Administration Advisery Council since 1987. 
The College currently has an enrollment of 2,109 students in its undergraduate, MBA and MSA programs, making it the second largest academic unit at Notre Dame, exceeded in size by the College of Arts and Let­ters. 
Over the past decade, under­graduate enrollment in Busi­ness Administration has almost doubled, the College's faculty has grown from 60 to 1 00 members, and four new centers of scholarship have been estab­lished: the Center for Ethics and Religious Values in Busi­ness, the Center for Business Research, the Center for re­search in Banking and the Cen­ter for International Develop­ment.

Casino industry officials said they were sure casinos could flourish in Gary -provided that a state law is written in such a way that several busi­nesses in the gaming industry can band together to build huge hotels joined in a large com­plex. 
James Ritchie, a counsel for the Golden Nugget casino com­pany, painted a "picture of the Emerald City that may well be Gary some day." 
Representatives of Circus Cir­cus and Resorts International also spoke in favor of the bill, as did several elected officials and labor leaders from north­west Indiana. 
Allan Rachles, an accountant hired to do an economic analy­sis for the casino industry, said 26,000 to 36,000 jobs could be created if six to nine casinos were built in Gary. City resi­dents could hold 14,000 to 19,000 of those jobs, he said. 
Revenues in gaming, property and innkeeper taxes could range from $183 million to $228 million annually, he said. 
The proponents said the mea­sure also has adequate safe­guards to prevent the infiltra­tion of organized crime into casino operations. 
But opponents questioned that and other assertions made by casino advocates. 
"I think we've listened to a Roman orgy this morning," said Paul Oakes, an Indianapo­lis businessman and longtime gambling opponent. 
Oakes also cited poll results showing Hoosier citizens op­pose casinos.

INDIANAPOLIS {AP) -A bill to legalize casino gambling in Gary faces a close vote in an Indiana House committee that heard two hours of debate on the measure Wednesday, the Democratic chairman of the panel said. 
Ways and Means Democratic Chairman B. Patrick Bauer of South Bend said a vote is likely Thursday on House Bill 1200, but only after members of his committee get a chance to sug­gest changes in the bill. 
"I think it's close," he said. "It depends on how willing they {the bill's sponsors) are to make changes."

Holographic artist Douglas Tyler. an assistant professor of art at Saint Mary's College, has been chosen as the first recipi­ent of the European Jlologra­phy Award, presented by a West German museum. 
The award was presented to Tyler on the occasion of the 1Oth anniversary of the Mu­seum fur Holographic & Neue Visuelle Medien in Pulheim, West Germany, on Nov.4. 
The award, which is dedicated exclusively to international holographers whose work represents a major contribution to the aesthetical development of the medium, is endowed with a 10,000 Deutsche Mark {approximately $5,500) grant, which is presented to the chosen artist. 

Tyler was seiected for the award by a five-member jury of European museum directors, academics and government cul­tural affairs directors. As part of the award ceremony, several pieces of Tyler's work were displayed at the Pulheim mu­seum. 
Tyler has exhibited his holo­graphic works extensively in Europe. 
Opponents of the bill said casino gambling would bring more crime to the city, which they claimed should look. at more traditional methods of economic development. 
Gary Mayor Thomas Barnes, careful to avoid using the word "casino" during his statement to the committee, portrayed casinos as part of an enter­tainment and tourist industry that could revive his city.

Bush:Troops may remain in Six Dallas girls snatched from beds 
Panama during drug summit 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi­dent Bush said Wednesday he still wants the rest of U.S. inva­sion troops withdrawn from Panama "as soon as possible," but he feels under no pwssure to get them out before next month's drug summit in Colombia. 
Bush. posing for pictures in thn Hose Garden with Gen. Maxwell Thurman, the com­mandnr of U.S. forces in Panama. congratulated Thur­man and his troops for "the outstanding job they did for our country." 
Bush denied that the United Statns was having diffkulties finding countries willing to host Viee Presidnnt Dan <)uayln on a fnnce-mending mission to the region. Quayle will visit Hon­duras, Panama and Jamaica .Jan. 27-29. 
Pnruvian President Alan Gar­da. perhaps the most outspo­ken eritie of the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion that toppled Manuel Antonio Noriega. has said he won't attend the Feb. 15 drug summit unless the U.S. invasion force is out of Panama before then. Garda plans to send a minister in his stead. 

The United States sent nearly 15,000 troops to Panama for the strike against Noriega and his Panamanian Defense Forces, more than doubling the 12,000 troops on permanent duty there to defend U.S. bases and the Panama CanaL 
"We want them out of there as soon as possible," Bush said. "It's my objective to get the troops out and get back to the levels before this military action." 
But he emphasized, "It has nothing to do with the summit in Cartagena at alL This is pru­dent, it is right.... I'm not driven by the summit." 
"I want to do what's right for Panama. I want to do what Panama wants," the pwsident told reporters. 
"It's Panama's show now." Bush said before going into a National Security Council meet­ing with Thurman and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to dis­cuss Panama and its needs. 
Bush said the new Panama­nian government of President Guillermo Endara "is strength­ening their democracy." 
DALLAS (AP) -Life in a quiet, residential section of the city isn't the same since a nocturnal intruder snatched six sleeping girls from their homes. 
Officers patrol on foot. homeowners use security systems even When they're home and parents and school officials grapple with protecting children without traumatizing them. 
Some parents tell of changing the pink drapes in their daughters' rooms to white to avoid tipping someone to the location of girls' rooms. 
Since September. six sleeping girls have been taken from their north Dallas homes in the middle of night. A man sexually assaulted three of them and tried to assault the other three, police say. 
Sometimes. he called them by name as he took them from their beds. 
The latest episode occurred a week ago. when an intruder carried an 8­year-old girl from her 
bedroom but dropped her outside the house, unharmed, after she screamed. 
Some neighborhood men have quit taking evening walks for fear people will suspect them. Other residents worry that someone will get shot acddentally as tensions rise. 
"The parents are really struggling with how to protect their children and at the same time keep from instilling fears in their children so that they can't sleep at night." said Lori J\1esserschmidt, who has coordinated counseling for families in the neighborhoods where the attacks occurred. 
More than 500 parents from the middle-to upper­class neighborhoods came to meetings Tuesday at two schools to talk about the attacks with school officials and police. 
In the exclusive Bent Tree West development where the latest attack occurred, the homeowners' association passed out fliers asking par­ents to take safety precautions: locking doors. watching their children, using security systems even when they're at home. 
"Our neighborhood knows each other, that's why it was so shocking," said Jane Hood, who lives in the development. "But I think everybody on our street is remembering to lock their doors." 
Police said Wednesday thny have no solid leads in the at­tacks. The victims, all elementary school-aw1 girls. haven't been able to give good descriptions, although all say the attacker was a white man with dark hair, police said. 
Investigators say some of the victims have been in heavily secured homes, complete with elaborate alarm systems and fences. But in at least the last attack, an unlocked patio door provided the intruder an easy way in. 

Dogs maul, kill elderly grandmother 
LOS ANGELES (AI') -The owner of two part-pit bull dogs that fatally injured his eldnrly grandmother in a half-hour at­tack wants the dogs destroyed, but authorities said Wednesday the animals' deaths must await an investigation. 
Marjee Lilly, 70, died Wednesday at County-USC Medical Center despite six hours of surgery that included tlw amputation of her left arm. 
"She had puncture wounds on most of her torso and all the llnsh had biHlll natnn off both arms from the wrist to the shoulder." police Lt. Alan Ker­stllin said Tuesdsay. The dogs gnawed on the woman for about :{0 minutes. 
The San Diego woman had been visiting her grandson, Clarence Hubbard. when the dogs attack11d Tunsday. 
Lilly. who remained conscious during the mauling, told police thn dogs attacked while she was trying to feed the 45-to 50-pound animals. 

Hubbard. 34, who found his 4-foot-11, 130-pound grand­mother on the lloor. said he's owned the 14-month-old pit bull terrier-boxer mixed breed dogs since th11y were puppies and they had never attacked anyone bdore. 
Hubbard told police he wantnd the dogs destroynd, but dty Department of Animal Con­trol Lt. Michael Burns said the dogs would remain in quaran­tinn at the North Central Ani­mal Care and Control Center. 
"Our investigation is far from bning complete,'' Burns said. "We arn going to hold the dogs for two masons: First. we don't know if they have bitten anyone else so we are holding thnm on a 10-day rabies quarantine, and second. we have to sen if thnrn is any kind of negligence." 
Because there are morn of them, G11rman shepherds are the nation's No. 1 biting dog. "But per capita. you will have greater injuries with pit bulls," Burns said.

East German coalition in danger 
WEST BERLIN (AP) -East Germany's ousted Communist Party chief, Egon Krenz, said Wednesday he blundered in dealing with dissension in the past, but denied being respon­sible for last fall's brutal sup­pression of pro-democracy protests. 
In other East German devel­opments, a political party threatened to bring down the shaky coalition government and the official news agency ADN announced the resignation of the nation's chief Supreme Court judge, Guenter Sarge, and the firing of the country's deputy chief prosecutor, Harry Harrland. 
Last week, Parliament opened disciplinary proceedings against both men, for allegedly moving too slowly to prosecute corruption and abuse of office. 
Krenz appeared before an in­vestigating commission of the East Berlin city government looking into police brutality during Oct. 7-8 street protests. 
The protests, coinciding with the visit of Spviet President

The Church: Its Role and Influence in Yiew of the February 25th Nicaraeuan Elections 
by Rev. John Medcalf· (Autho,r of A Parish at War--Letters from Nicaragua, Templegate Publishers) 
Mikhail Gorbachev, provided a turning point in the pro-democ­racy movement that led to the ouster of hard-line leader Erich Honecker 10 days later. 
Krenz said he accepted "joint responsibility for misjudging dissident citizens and dissident groups for years." 
"From today's viewpoint, it is incomprehensible that there was no general Politburo dis­cussion about the negative de­velopments then taking place in society," said Krenz, an influ­ential Politburo member even before Honecker's fall. Krenz succeeded Honecker and him­self was ousted six weeks later. 
Krenz added that he and other Politburo members at the time failed to realize the Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches were "not working against but rather for the German Demo­cratic Republic." 
Krenz, who was in charge of many police functions at the time of the October protests, criticized the attacks by club­swinging officers. 
"The excessive action of law enforcement authorities was neither politically nor morally justifiable," he told the panel, but he said he was not person­ally responsible for orders to attack protesters. 
Another ousted Politburo 
member told the commission Honecker himself ordered the attacks. 
"Honecker took things into his own hands," Guenter Sch­abowski said. Like Krenz, Sch­abowski denied personal re­sponsibility for the orders to attack the demonstrators, most of them young people. 
The panel members are inves­tigating the possibility of filing criminal charges against the ousted leaders. 
Communist Premier Hans Modrow is struggling to hold together the coalition govern­ment formed to govern the na­tion until elections May 6. 

The Christian Democrats, one of the non-Communist parties in the coalition, threatened Wednesday to pull out to protest the Communists' con­tinued tight grip on power. 
Party spokesman Lothar Lueck said the party leadership was showing "a very strong tendency to leave the govern­ment." The party holds three of the 27 Cabinet seats. 
A collapse of the coalition could force Modrow to appeal to the pro-democracy opposi­tion to help govern the country until elections in May.

SEATTLE (AP) -Two sailors at a top-security submarine base and a pawnshop clerk were the latest victims in a deadly thrnP.-day crime wavf! that left night dP.ad in five ap­parently unrelated shootings, police said. 
The rash of killings lnft invf!s­tigators searching for motives and for an nxplanation to the sudden jump in Snattln-area homicides. 
"I can't renwmber evnr hav­ing this many in a three-day pe­riod," said Cecil Hay, a police spokesman for King County, which includes Seattle. Thn county had only one slaying this year beforn tlw latest spren. 
Navy oflidals said the sailors werP found shot to death Tues­day in thn baclwlor enlisted quarters at Naval Submarine Basn, Bangor, whieh is about 25 milns west of Seattle on tlw llood Canal. 
Tlw oflicials said little about the killings, whkh occurmd at the base for the Navy's West Coast lltwt of Trident sub­marines. The sailors were identified as David Allen Parker, 21, of San Diego, and Scott Anthony Seely, 18, of North Hidgeville, Ohio, west of Cleveland. 
Parker was a radioman and Seely a fireman on the subma­rine USS Michigan. 
Special Navy investigators wt~re railed in from San Fran­cisco and San Diego to help a Naval Intelligence Service offi­cer at Bangor investigate the killings, Navy spokesman Gene Homann said. 
The gun used in the shootings has not btwn found. Except for those used by security guards, guns are banned on the base. 
Homann said the Navy killings were not connected to a shooting later Tuesday at a Bremerton pawnshop in which derk Julie Michaels, 32, was killed and her 35-year-old brother critically wounded. 
Bremerton is about 10 miles from the naval base.

Chinese gov't. drafts stricter laws towards Hong Kong 
HONG KONG (AP) -China on Wednesday further hardened its line toward Hong Kong by deciding that top officials in the post-1997 government could not possess the right to live abroad. Hong Kong govern­ment radio said. 
A top Chinese official also announced that Hong Kong civil servants with British pass­ports would not be allowed to seek British consular protec­tion while in the territory after it returns to Chinese rule in seven years. 
Local newspapers quoted Lu Ping, deputy secretary-general of the Basic Law Drafting Committee, which is writing llong Kong's post-1997 blueprint, as saying civil ser­renounce their Chinese citizen­ship. 
In London, the British For­eign Office said it was "seeking clarification" of the announce­ment. 
The announcements threw into doubt a British plan to of­fer passports to 50,000 key llong Kong professionals and officials, including civil ser­vants. 
The passports were being of­fered as a security neL for Hong Kong residents. Confidence in China's promise to retain Hong Kong's free-wheeling economic system for 50 years evaporated after the bloody June 4 crack­down on a movement for democracy in Beijing. 
The moves marked new re­

The Basic Law Drafting Committee decided in Canton that the territory's chief execu­tive, its principal officers and all its executive councilors could not possess the right of abode in another country. 
Government radio said the committee still must decide whether to ban the territory's two top judges and all its legis­lators from possessing the right to live abroad. 
Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong's top officials are already prohibited from holding a for­eign passport. The move by the

Chile imposes ban on fruit transport 
SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -Au­thorities on Wednesday banned the transport of all fruit out of central Chile's Aconcagua Val­ley after the discovery of at least 12 Mediterranean fruit flies in the area. 
The government Agricultural Service chief. Juan Carlos Sepulveda, said the flies were found in a residential neigh­borhood in Los Andes. a city 48 miles northeast of Santiago. He said none had been detected in the fruit-growing areas. 
Nonetheless, Sepulveda said, diately implemented that in­cluded banning the transport of all fruit out of the valley. 
Grapes, peaches, nectarines and kiwis are grown in the Aconcagua area. About 16 mil­lion crates are expected to be harvested this year in the valley, virtually all for export to the United States, Japan and western Europe. 
Police roadblocks were established to enforce the quarantine, which coincides with the start of fruit harvest­ing in the Southern Hemi­

Regional governor Raul Celis said authorities believe the problem -the first time Mediterranean fruit flies have been found in Chile since 1978 -will be resolved quickly. 
The emergency plan, Sepul­veda said, includes fumigation of fruit and trees with chemi­cals. Harvested fruit will be placed in cold storage three to four days, a common procedure to kill the fly and its larvae. 
Sepulveda said the Mediter­ranean flies found in Los Andes are believed to have been come

U.S. "green" card or a resi­dence permit for Canada or Britain. 
Britain has said it hopes the passport package will boost confidence by encouraging key residents 'to stay in the terri­tory by giving them a last re­sort. 
But China says the· package violates the 1984 agreement under which Britain will hand the colony back to China. 
Lu said the British Consulate in Hong Kong would be prohib­ited from helping Hong Kong civil servants with British pass­ports after 1997. 
He said that without the right of abode in Britain, Hong Kong's people would settle in Hong Kong. 
"Now you, Britain, grant them right of abode, so just in case they commit corruption offenses or get int trouble, they can flee Hong Kong," Lu said. 
Lu's statement directly con­tradicted assurances made Tuesday by British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who said all Hong Kong residents with British passports would be granted consular protection. 
China does not recognize dual nationals. 
The committee is expected to finish drafting the Basic Law in four days. Then it will go to China's parliament, the Na­tional People's Congress, for a largely ceremonial vote in March. 

Medellin cartel vows to stop drug trade 
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) ­The Medellin cocaine cartel said Wednesday the government has won the war on drugs, and it said it would halt its terror campaign and stop dealing drugs in exchange for a par­don. 
The cartel released two kid­nap victims to back up its offer, which was similar to previous proposals that have been re­jected by the government. The difference in this proposal was the cartel's statement that it accepted defeat. 
Also Wednesday, a Colombian brother and sister were flown to North Carolina to face ­charges of running a cocaine­trafficking ring. That brought to 13 the number of Colombians extradited to the United States since President Virgilio Barco launched the crackdown in August. 
The drug cartel's commu­nique followed Barco's state­ment Tuesday night that his government is not "inflexible" in regards to a negotiated set­tlement with drug lords. Previ­ously, Barco ruled out talks. 
Barco, President Bush and the leaders of the cocaine-pro­ducing countries of Peru and Bolivia have joined forces to fight drug traffickers. They are expected to sign an accord to that effect at a drug summit in Cartagena, Colombia, next month. 
Patricia Echavarria. who was kidnapped Dec. 16 in Medellin along with her daughter, car­ried the 11-point communique when the two were freed Wednesday in Medellin. 
Interior Minister Carlos Le­mos Simmonds verified the au­thenticity of the communique. When asked if the government would negotiate, he said simply that officials were pleased the traffickers had conceded de­feat. 
The communique, like others from the traffickers, was signed by The Extraditables, the name of the Medellin car­tel's armed wing. 
"We accept the triumph of the state," said the commu­nique. "Thus we will Jay down our arms and abandon our ob­jectives for the benefit of the highest interests of the father­land." 
"We submit to the existing legal establishment in the hope of obtaining from the govern­ment and from society respect for our rights and our return to our families and communi­ties," the communique said. 
That has been the traffickers' way jn the past of saying they want pardons and to not be ex­tradited to the United States. 
Barco began his crackdown on drug dealers five months ago after drug lords assassi­nated a leading presidential candidate, Sen. Carlos Galan, who demanded more action against drug trafficking. 
As part of the crackdown, Barco revived Colombia's ex­tradition treaty with the United States, something feared by traffickers here. 
In the latest extradition, Di­ana Maria Caballero Rangel Gamber, 29, and Roberto Ca­ballero Rangel, 32, were turned over to U.S. marshals by Colombian authorities and flown Wednesday to Greens­boro, N.C., the Marshals Ser­vice said. 
The two were arrested Oct. 
20 by Colombian authorities in 
Bucaramanga on trafficking 
charges stemming from a 1988 
indictment returned by a fed­
eral grand jury in Greensboro. 
Drug traffickers have re­sponded to the government crackdown with a terror cam­paign that has killed 209 people.

II. 

Foreign reporters have been barred from the region. 
President Mikhail Gorbachev sent 11,000 army and internal security troops to the southern region Tuesday, but they have been slowed by Azerbaijanis who erected barricades on roads and at a military airfield. 
The reinforcements "haven't helped yet because they haven't started to act," said Dmitri Se­leznyov, spokesman for the In­terior Ministry in Moscow. 
Troops engaged in at least one battle Tuesday, when an armed group tried to seize five armored personnel carriers near the village of Tazikend. Soldier!) fired on the group, wounding two men, Tass re­ported. 
"Since then, attempts to take APCs have stopped, because be­fore this they weren't used to having weapons used against them," Seleznyov said. 
Heinforcements also were sent to the nearby border with Iran, Tass said. More than 7,000 Armenians have been evacuated from Baku, many in ferry boats across the Caspian Sea. 
In Baku, a· handful of Soviet soldiers for nearly three hours held back a crowd of 5,000 people trying to prevent the de­tention of 10 nationalists who broke into the apartment of' a Hussian family, Tass said. They finally agreed to release the 10, and led the Hussians and an Armenian family out of the house, protecting them with shields. 
In Armenia, residents broke into police stations and other buildings seeking weapons, Se­leznyov said. About 50,000 people attended a rally in the Armenian capital Yerevan to hear reports about the fighting, said Armenian aetivist Karen Shakhbazyan. 
Azerbaijanis staged protests in Baku and elsewhere to' de­mand they be armed and al­lowed to defnnd tl11~ir daim to Nagorno-Karabakh, newspa­pers and officials said. 
Azerbaijanis continued their rail blockade of Armenia's 3.5 million people, cutting short fuel and other supplies. Azer­baijan has 6.9 million people. 
The Soviet government and the Communist Party issued a joint statement of condolence to families of the dead.

Religious items sold on TV can be taxed 
WASHINGTON {AP) -Reli­gious items sold by television evangelists through the mail or at crusade appearances may be taxed by states just like any other merchandise, the Supreme Court ruled Wednes­day. 
The court said such taxes do not violate religious freedom, and unanimously upheld lower court rulings that forced the Louisiana-based Jimmy Swag­gart Ministries to pay $183,000 in back taxes to California. 
Most states tax the proceeds of at least some mail order sales to their residents, but Cal­ifornia apparently is the only state that does not exempt reli­gious organizations. 
Other states searching for additional tax revenues now could follow California's lead. 
"California's non-discrimina­tory sales and use tax law ... imposes no constitutionally significant burden on {Swaggart's) religious practices or beliefs," Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court. 
The tax at issue was imposed on the sales of religious books, tapes and other merchandise sold by Swaggart's organiza­tion from 197 4 through 1981. 
Swaggart did not challenge California's taxing T-shirts, mugs, bowls and crown-of­thorns mplicas sold by his min­istry. 
Mail-order sales from Swag­gart's base in Baton Rouge, La., to California consumers during those years totaled $1.7 million. Sales of merchandise at California crusades totaled $240,000. 
Swaggart's challenge of the 
tax had been supported by an 
array of religious groups 
-from Hare Krishnas to mainline Protestants. Lawyers for the National Council of Churches, represent­ing most Protestant denomina­tions, called the California tax "a serious threat ... a tax on the dissemination of religious messages, and thus a forbidden tax on the exercise of religion." Backing California's authority to impose such a wx were two organizations not usually allied in court -the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Conference of State Legislatures. Swaggart's lawyers had relied heavily on a 1943 high court ruling that overturned the convictions of Jehovah's Witnesses who violated a city ordinance requiring all people engaged in door-to-door can­vassing to get licenses and pay fees. 
The Jehovah's Witnesses were distributing religious literature, and the 1943 ruling said, "This form of religious activity occu­pies the same high estate under the First Amendment as do worship in the churches and preaching from the pulpits." 
But Wednesday's decision drew a distinction between those fees and the California tax. 
"Our concern (in the 1943 ruling) that a flat license tax would act as a precondition to the free exercise of religious beliefs is simply not present where a tax applies to all sales and uses of tangible personal property in the state," O'Connor wrote.

Court to rule on Reagan subpoena 
WASHINGTON {AP)-A fed­eral judge Wednesday ordered a hearing in connection with John Poindexter's effort to subpoena former President Reagan as a witness at Poindexter's upcoming trial. 
U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene said next Tues­day's court session will focus on whether a president or former president may be sub­poenaed to be a witness at a trial under any circumstances. 
Greene asked that lawyers for Reagan, Poindexter, the Justice Department and the Iran-Con­tra prosecutor's office address possible alternatives to bring­ing Reagan to court to testify during Poindexter's trial. 
Alternatives might be having Reagan give a videotaped depo­sition or giving written re­sponses to questions. 
Poindexter is seeking court approval to subpoena Reagan's testimony, asserting that the president authorized some of the activities in the Iran-Contra affair for which the ex-national security adviser now is accused of crimes. 
The judge said the lawyers should address what kind of showing Poindexter must make regarding the "materiality or necessity" of Reagan's testi­mony before the former na­tional security adviser is al­lowed to subpoena his ex-b(!ss. 
In connection with a separate subpoena, Reagan was ordered by Greene to turn over to the court by Jan. 7 portions of the former president's diaries per­taining to Iran-Contra matters. 
Greene is expected to rule on whether the excerpts will be turned over to Poindexter in preparation for his trial. 
Attempted hijacker overpowered by police 
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -A man accused of trying to hijack an American West airliner to Cuba seemed agitated before the flight but told airline agents he was nervous about flying and worried about a sick rela­tive. 
Airline employees accepted his explanation and allowed Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 39, of New Orleans, on Tues­day's 10:45 p.m. flight from Houston to Las Vegas, an air­line spokesman said Wednes­day. 
Shortly after, passengers said, Gonzalez-Gonzalez grabbed flight attendant Stacy Wood, 26, announced he had a bomb and demanded to go to his native Cuba. 
He was apprehended at Austin's Robert Mueller Munic­ipal Airport by a police officer who climbed up an emergency chute and overpowered him. 
Gonzalez-Gonzalez, a native of Cuba, was to be arraigned Wednesday afternoon on air piracy charges, a federal of­fense punishable by 20 years to life in prison. Police said he signed a confession. 
No bomb was discovered, but a device made of a toothpaste container and a "flashlight­type article" was found, said FBI agent Michael Wilson. 
Authorities declined to elabo­rate on a motive for the at­tempt. 
"The only thing he asked for was to be flown back to Cuba. ... He just felt like, I think, that he was personally being threat­ened and people were out to get him," Austin Police Deputy Chief Kenneth Williams said. He said Gonzalez-Gonzalez has been in the United States since April 1962.

Boston Marathon course will not change despite new rule 
(AP) -The Boston Marathon course won't change, despite nnw rules that exclude races run on it from consideration for world or American records. rae!~ din~ctor Guy Morse said Wednesday. 
lie also said the race will ron­tinue to award bonuses to run­ners who beat the best time ever run by Americans or for­eign competitors or who set course rPcords. 
The New York City Marathon, in the same predicament, also intends to maintain its course and systl\m of bonuses, race coordinator Allan Steinfeld said. 
The Athletics Congress, which oversees track and field and road racing in the United States, adopted rules last month in an apparent attempt to standardize the kinds of courses on which marathon rncords can be set and limit the possibility of one being set on an easy course. 
In the past, TAC had one record for marathons whose starting and finishing lines were relatively close to each other and another for marathons which started at one point and finished at a dis­tant point. 
Under the new rules, TAC will 
recognize only one record. The 
races must be run under the 
following guidelines: 
-The starting line can be no more than one meter per kilo­mnter -about 42 meters ­higher in altitude than the lin­ish line. The difference in Boston is about 150 meters, said Basil llonikman, TAC's na­tional records chairman. 
-The starting and finishing linns can be no further apart than 30 percnnt of the race dis­tance -or about eight miles. If a racn doesn't meet that stan­dard. it still can qualify for a record as long as the wind doesn't exceed a certain level still to be established.

"It clarifies a system that lacked integrity." Ilonikman said. 

Bob Hersh. chairman of the TAC rules committee, said, "This is designed to bring legit­imacy and give the proper recognition without having the circumstances like excessivQ wind and excessive downhill being a factor." 
The New York race meets the first standard. but its start and finish are further apart than allowed. 
Although Boston doesn't meet either criterion, Morse contends that it is not an easy course. Only three world records, whose validity are now in doubt, have been set on it. An attempt to exempt Boston from the new rules failed. 
"It's clear to any athlete you talk to, world class or everyday runner. that it is a tough course that beats you up," Morse said. lie hopes to con­vince T AC to change the rulPs. 
Morse and Steinfeld said courses cannot be comph~tely 
standardized since they are run outdoors in different cities throughout the world. They were particularly upset by the retroactivity of the rules, which wipes out from record consid­eration any times already run in Boston and New York. 
Morse said eight of the top 18 times run by Americans were run in Boston. Until the new rules were adopted, the fastest accepted marathon run by an American was Alberto Salazar's time of 2:08:51 in Boston in 1982. TAC now rec­ognizes Tony Sandoval's 1979 time of 2:10:20 as the Amnriean record. 
Steinfeld said thn rntroaetivity "doesn't make any sense whatsoever." 
Hersh said the new rules first were approved by TAC's three committees that dPal with long­distance running. But Steinfeld, a mnmber of the mpn's long­distance running eommittee, said he and possibly other members didn't rnalizn the rules would be applied retroac­tively. 
llonikman said the records system is just a small part of thn sport and TAC will keep a list of the top marathon per­
formances no matter what 
course they wern run 011. 
.Jack Mahoney, sports mar­keting consultant for .John llancock Financial Services, which sponsors the New York and Boston races, said llancoek has no plans to chal­lenge the rules. 
"What can you do rPally?" he said. "I think there's more amu~emPnt here than anything else. 
"This is absolutely crazy," Steinf~ld said. "The rules sup­posndly wPrn supposPd to makn morP sense of things." 
llonikman said the Intnrna­tional Amateur Athletic FPdera­tion has b1Hm talking about set­ting more uniform standards. 
"It sePms to be a good idea to work toward an intPrnational syst1w1 of world rncords." he said.

Noah, McEnroe advance in Australian Open 
(AP)-Yannick Noah is back in all his glory and threat­ening to crash a party that seemed reserved for the usual big names in tennis. 
Diving and leaping, his dreadlocks flying wildly, Noah's resurgence is sending a buzz through the Australian Open equal to the excitement about the rejuvenation of John McEnroe. 
Noah and McEnroe, two of the most colorful and popular players in tennis, advanced to

just trying for a good percent­age." 
To Agenor and most ob­servers, though, Noah's serve was big enough. In the final set, Noah lost only one point in five service games. In the second set, he lost only three points in four service games. 
McEnroe, a self-proclaimed longshot here, is looking less so every day. 
He sounded gleeful as he re­counted in diabolical detail the demise of his second victim. 
"He became very, very shaky," McEnroe said after the 78-minute mismatch against Antonitsch.

"We went with last year's 
starters in the second half and 
then got things going," Phelps 
said. "We played very well in 
the second half. And against 
Boston College, we played two 
really good halves." 
The Irish downed Boston 
College 80-67 behind the 21 
points of Robinson. Fredrick, 
Tim Singleton, Ellis and 
Jackson also hit double figures. 
LaSalle handed Notre Dame 
its fifth loss of the season 86­
78 as Lionel Simmons and 
Doug Overton scored 27 points 
apiece. The win improved the 
Explorers to 10-1, their only 
loss coming at the hands of 
Loyola-Marymount. 
Against Rutgers Tuesday 
night, Fredrick and Robinson 
turned in good efforts off the 
bench. The score was tied at 27 
at halftime, but the Irish pulled 
away to lead 48-36 and then 
held on for the win. 
Now it's back to the road for 
the showdown in New Orleans, 
the showdown against high­
scoring Chris Jackson and a 
team tabbed by many as one of 
the best in the country. 
"If we can improve on the 
road and cut down on our 
turnovers and cut down on 
other teams getting offensive 
rebounds -that's part of the 
process," Phelps said. 
The process may seem slow 
at times. but it's definitely 
coming.

Whalers tie Bruins; Isles trip Habs 
(AP) -Kevin Dineen scored with 17 seconds left as the Hartford Whalers rallied to tie the Boston Bruins 5-5 Wednesday night. 
Mikael Andersson, Randy Ladouceur, Scott Young and Pat Verbeek also scored for the Whalers, who are an NHL-best 13-8-2 on the road but only 8­13-2 at the Hartford Civic Center. 
Hay Bourque had two goals and Handy Burridge, Gary Galley and Bobby Carpenter also scored for Boston. Craig Janney added three assists. 
Burridge and Bourque scored goals 1:53 apart early in the third period to give Boston a 5­4 lead. 
Bourque scored a power-play goal at 3:51 of the third period to tie the score at 4. Burridge, who has 20 goals in 29 career games against the Whalers, gave the Bruins the lead at 5:44 when he scored on breakaway. 
But the Whalers, who at one point trailed 3-0, pulled goalie Kay Whitmore and earned the tie when Dineen beat Andy Moog from the slot for his 16th goal of the season -enabling Hartford to avoid a sweep in the home-and-home series. 
The Bruins led 3-0 lead early in the second period, as Janney assisted on goals by Galley, Carpenter and Bourque, before the Whalers rallied, scoring four times within a span of 10:33. 
Andersson seored from be­tween the circles at 6:59 and Ladoueeur tapped in a rebound at !0:07 to bring Hartford within 3-2. Young's blast from the left circle at 15:20 tied the game at 3-3 and Verbeek's tap­in at 17:32 gave Hartford its 4­3lead. 
Galley opened the scoring at 
2:49 on power play with a ris­ing slap shot from the top of the right circle. Carpenter made it 2-0 at 10:15 when he con­verted Janney's pass from the
