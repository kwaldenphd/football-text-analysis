ND releases sports proposal to co01ply -with Title IX 
by Michael Lewis Exe;.cutive News Editor 
Notre Dame released irs long-awaited proposal to comply with Title IX Saturday, calling for a major women's basketball program, cutbacks in the present hockey program, and m.ajor efforts to "improve athletic revenues" by charging students for football tickets, raising ticket prices, and creating an athletic endowment. 
Hockey is the only current sports program that will lose scholarships under the proposal. The plan will be presented to the Board ofTrustees for approval, probably when the full Board meets on campus beginning May 2. 
In a major break with tradition, Notre Dame students will be charged for football tickets. Students will be able to buy tickets at a 50 percent discount. The plan calls for an increase in football ticket price to $12 per game, so students can expect pay $6 per game next fall. 
The initial women's ~rant-in-aid will be concentrated in women's basketball, whiCh. is expected to begin Division I competition in three to four years. The University's women's team currently competes in Division III. 
Athletic Director Edward Krause said the University will ''go all out" to field a top-flight women's team, but said that other women's sports will receive grants-in-aid "right away." 
Krause did nor know exactly how many scholarships will be offered to women next year. Richard "Digger" Phelps, coach of the ND men's team, will assume overall responsibility for the women's program. 
Krause added that the University will begin interviews for a new coach of the women's team, and that current coach Sharon Petro will be one of those considered. 
The University will reduce the cost of hockey by decreasing hockey scholarships from 20 to 18 next season. Further cuts were implied by the statement, but Krause said he does not know what further measures will be taken. 
Hockey ticket prices will also increase, but Krause was unable to specify the amount. Students now pay $1 per game with a season ttcket, and $1.50 per game at the door. Other hockey spectators pay $3 per game. 
In addition, Notre Dame will try to reduce the travel costs of participating in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. The

Shah leaves Panama for Egypt 
PANAMA CilY,Panama (AP) -The deposed shah of Iran left Panama for Egypt yesterday aboard a chartered American jet, ending a 100-day residence in this tropical coun­try where he faced extradition proceedings, U.S. and Panamanian officials reported. 
White House security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski said in Washington that the self-exiled monarch left Panama in order to receive medical attention. Physicians have said the shah suffers from lymphatic cancer, which may have spread to his spleen. 
Iran's revolutionary regime, seeking the return of the shah on char~es of mass murder and corrupuon, has said that his departure from Panama would delay the release of about 50 American hostages held by militants in Tehran. A legal representative for Iran said Saturday he planned to meet a Monday deadline to file evidence with Panamanian authorities to support the case. 
A Panamanian government spokesman said the shah, "having received a perso~al invitation from Egypuan President Anwar Sadat, chose to move to Cairo." Brzezinski also said the shah had accepted 
Sadat's longstanding invitation 
of asylum. 
However, spokesmen for 
Sadat issued another denial 
yesterday that the Shah was en 
route to Egypt. 
A Panamanian air force 
officer who asked not to be 
identified said White House 
advisor Hamilton Jordan also 
left Panama for Washington 
apoard a U.S. government 
Jet. Jordan arrived here Friday, apparently to arrange the shah's departure. 
Tht · Panamanian officer said the shah was aboard a DC-8 jet chartered from Evergreen International Airlines of Ore_gon. A Panamanian air traffic controller said the com­pany had filed a flight plan which called for a refueling stop in the Azores Islands in the Atlantic Ocean at 8 p.m. EST: 
The officer said the shah, accompanied by his wife Farah, eight aides, their pet dogs, and 1000 pounds of luggage, departed from Tocumen Airport here at about 
1:40 p.m. EST. 
At midday, Shah Moham­mad Reza Pahlavi, 60, and his wife flew on a small private plane from their residence on Panama's Comadora Island, accompanied by former MONDAY, MARCH 24, 1980

Carter's budget 

Russo expects negative results 
by Kelli Flint Senior StaffReporter 
President Carter's budget cuts will probably have a negative effect on two of the five federally funded financial aid programs at Notre Dame, according 'to Joserh Russo, Qirector of Financia Aid. 

Panamanian ambassador to rhe United States Gabriel Lewis. Visibly sad, the former shah thanked Panama for its hos­pitality. 
Panamanian television re­ported that Jordan and Tor­rijos, a former Panamanian president, met with the shah Saturday on Comadora Island, where the former monarch has lived since Dec. 15 after receiv­ing medical treatment in the United States. 
The three student aid programs that will probably not be affected by the budget situation are the Supplement­ary Educatinal Opportunity Grant (program), the College Work-Study program, and the National Direct Student Loan program (NDSL). "Carter's budget cuts will not affect the 
tentative appropriations · made for these programs for the 1980-81 term," Russo said. ''These programs are campus­based, and will probably remain the same as this year.'' The two programs facing pos­sible problems are the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant (BEOG) program and the Guar­anteed Student Loan program. ''These have become the first and second most expensive federal aid programs in recent years," Russo said. "There is concern over the growing cost increase ofthese programs.''·._ 
The maximum BEOG allot­ment was $1800 this year. ' 'An increase to $1900 was being considered,'' Russo said. 
"Due to cutbacks, the extra $100 will probably nor be d ,,
grante . . ''There was senous concern over the Guaranteed Student Loan program before the bud­get cut," Russo said. "Be­cause of the budget cut, the senate is ~ooking more closely 
at the amounts of the program and its cost to the govern· ment.'' 
According to Russo, one aspect of the Guaranteed Loan program that the senate may consider is the :;:~ideline for eligibility. "Famity income gmdelines are currently not a factor for a student's eltgibiliry as a result of the passage of the Middle Income Students Assistance Act in 1978,'' Russo said. ''Any student is current­ly able to take a loan and receive federal interest subsid­ies while in school. The current budget situation could mean a closer look at the lack of income ceilings in the pro­gram.'' 
Russo added that there may very possibly be an increase in interest rates on loans. Pre­sently interest on the NDSL is

DirectorofSecurity Terry wishes to handle recent complaint by NDstudent personally 
by Margie Brassil SMC News Editor 
Director of Security, Glenn Terry has decided to personally handle the complaint brought against three ND security guards by a student last Tuesday. The complaint was filed by Sophomore Gordon Geraci against Ray Garcia, Tom Costa, and Ken Wilbur, charging them with verbal abuse and harassment. 
The incident between Geraci and the guards occurred last Sunday night when Geraci tried to get his ID in return for a 15 minute pass. According to Geraci, he went twice to the Main Gate for his ID. The second time, he made a wise­crack to the guards. Garcia reportedlly then flared up at Geraci. 
''He threw down his badge and said he was resigning. He then began cussing at me and came foreward as if to hit me and had to be restrained by Costa,'' claimed Geraci. Geraci alledges that Costa then began to indirectly threaten him_ 

Geraci S_{>oke with Terry when he filed hts complaim on Tues. Terry had then said he would try and get a hearing set up with Geraci, the guards, and a University representative. Ac­cording to Terry, he had re­ferred the matter to Dean Roemer, who then referred it back to him.

Israeli Cabinet allows Jews to settle in Arab cityfor first 
trme 

JERUSALEM (AP) -In a decision likely to complicate already stalled palestinian au­tonomy negotiations, the Israe­li Cabinet voted for the first time to let Jews settle in an occupied Arab city. 
The Cabinet approved by an 8-6 vote, with three absten­tions, a proposal to establish two schools in which Jewish students would live full-time in the Arab city of Hebron on the West Bank of theJordan River. 
The last Jewish residents of · Hebron left the city after Arab rioting in 1929. 
Opponents of the settlement plan said they would appeal the vote to the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee in the Israeli Parltament, and Prime Minister Menachem Begin a­greed to delay action until the committee meers. The Parlia­ment begins a one-month re­cess Thursday. 
Israel has built more than 50 settlements on the occupied West Bank but has not allowed Jews to settle in Arab cities. However, Begin has come un­der pressure from right-wing Israelis to carry out the Hebron move. 
The settlement issue is re­garded as one of the major stumbling blocks to a success­ful conclusion, targeted for May 26, of Palestinian autono­my negotiations. There has been little progress in the talks to determme the nature and extent of the autonomy, and President Carter has sum­moned Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to Washington for separate meet­

Begin said yesterday. he would respond in the next few days to a letter he had receive d from Sadat and would call a special Cabinet session before leaving for his meeting with Carter. 
Israei news reports said the 

letter from Sadat to Begin 
placed responsibility for the 
outcome of the autonomy talks 
entirely on Israel. The Egyp­
tians have placed greater em­
phasis on progress being made 
by the date set in the Camp 
David peace accords. 
Israel, Egypt and the United States began negotiations on Palestinian autonomy last May with a one-year deadline for establishing an autonomous A­rab administration on the West Bank and Gaza Strip where there are 1.2 million Palestini­an Arabs. The territories were occupied by Israel in the Mid­east War of 1967. 
The United States and Egypt have been pressing for an end to Jewish settlements on the West Bank. Washington has criticized the settlements as an obstacle to peace. 
The Israeli cabinet declared in February that Jews have the ri~ht to settle anywhere in the Btblical land of Israel, which includes the West Band and Hebron, a city of 50,000 Arabs 20 miles south of Jerusalem that is the burial site of the Patriarch Abraham and is con­sidered holy by both Moslems and Jews. 
However, the vote on the Hebron settlements was post­poned more than a month

because of its controversial nature. 

Cabinet spokesman John Salem said after yesterday's severn-hour meeting: ''The political implication of the de­cision was the main issue discussed." He also said the Cabinet wanted to make it "very clear and very direct" that Jews would not be barred from Hebron or anywhere else.

Available institutional funds offset recent increase inSMC tuition 
ty Katie Gzlligan 

Due to the recent rise in the tuition feces at Saint Mary's for the 80-81 school year, many students have expressed con­cern in regards to meeting this increased financial demand. However, according to Director of Financial Aid, Kathleen Jeffnies, a substantial rise in available institutional funds should permit a broad range of distribution. 
These funds, which include grants, scholarships and en­dowments, are awarded on the basis of individual need. Although 53 percent of the 
. Saint Mary's student body is on some type of financial aid, the rise in tuition will only affect the institutional scholar­ship funds. As Jeffries points out, there will be more funds, and not necessarily more scholarships. In this way, either more lower-figure awards can be given, or per­haps, fewer, but more expen­sive ones, can be distributed. During this school year, $330,095 was available, yet due to the new tuition increase, there will be approximately $336,310 available to the stu­dents. Currently, 385 students are using these funds, and next 
year's expected enrollment does not show a marked in­crease in those wanting finan­cial assistance. 

Like all types of loans, money from Saint Mary's institutional funds is distributed on the basis of need. "Need" is defined by the family's income, assets, current debts, medical or unusual expenses, the num-· ber of dependents, and the number of dependents enrolled at the post-secondary level. The family is expected to pay a calculated sum, which will then be accompanied by the aid. Although this calculation is federally mandated, there is no clear cut-off point when deter­mining . the eligibility of a family. 
Another financial aid division at Saint Mary;s, the Work/ Study Program, which received a $68,000 increase in funds over the '78-'79 school year, is hoping for equal assistance. 
Last year, the program re­ceived only $46,260 as opposed to this year's originally slated $75,000 which rose to $114,725. Next year's figures are undeterminable at this time, but Jeffries promises a ''comparable student work pro­gram.'' 
The funds received from the

te.am will compete in the WCHA next season, but the University wtll "explore other options, including membership in a geographically more compact league,'' according to the statement. 
Student fees for football tickets, a first for Notre Dame, is part of the attempt to increase athletic revenues. With the ticket price increase and the student fee, next season will probably bring record gate receipts for ND football. University President Fr. Theordore Hesburgh said the time had· come to charge students for football tickets. ''I think we were the only school in the world that gave free football rickets to its students," he said. "Now we can'r." 
Krause said he believes the student fee will not affect student attendance. ''Students pay for hockey and basketball, why not football," he said. 
The proposal also calls for the establishment of an athletic endowment to help meet rhe costs of the University's varsity, club and intramural sports, but neither the statement nor Krause could offer specifics on this endowment. 
Hockey coach Charles "Lefty" Smith called the endowment "a great move." "It has to be done in this day and age," he said . 
. . . Budget

three percent, and interest on a Guaranteed loan is seven per­cent. "In the Higher Educa­tion Amendments pending leg­islation, an increase from three to seven percent is proposed for the NDSL,'' Russo said. ''The Guaranteed Student Loan faces a possible increase from seven to nine percent. These increases from seven to nine percent. These increases may affect the 1981-82 term.'' 
"It is not impossible that the budget cutbacks will create problems for students this fall, but they will most probably affect students this time next year," Russo said. "Lender participation in the Guaranteed Student Loan program is a problem. At present, the government pays lenders up to 16 percent on student loans. This is done to increase the availability of loans for stu­dents. If controls and limits are put down, the availability of loans will be reduced. Fewer lenders will be willing to put up with the red tape and possible additional costs.'' 
' 'The Guaranteed Student Loan program is the most commonly used loan program at Notre Dame," Russo said. ''The costs of the program are spiraling.'' 
''Many students attending private schools have a limited choice between public and private institutions,'' Russo said. "The effects of Carter's budget cut could make it more difficult for these students to attend private institutions.'' 
Russo added that because of the elections, the significant changes in federal aid will probably not take place until the 1981-82 school year. "Public pressure in an election year from middle families who benefit from these programs will greatly offset a major change for the 1980-81 (school) year.'' 

government are used t0 pay for 
80 percent of tbe swdents' 
wages, while Saint Mary's 
pays the remaining 20 percent. 
If, however, a student is employed by the college but not because of financial need, then Saint Mary's must pay the full salary. 
Therefore, because there are 
a frozen number of available 
jobs, it is financially advanta­
geous for the college to employ 
only those involved in the 
Work/Study Program. The 
money that Saint Mary's would 
have to use to pay those not in 
the program can then be 
reallocated for other programs, 
including the institutional 
scholarship program. 
Despite the tuttion hike, and 
the rate of inflation, Jeffries 
stated that the number of those 
who would seek financial aid 
for the '80-'81 school year 
would remain "fairly con­
stant'', with the possibility of 
only a "slight increase."

Sr. Maureen Feedler lectures on Catholic viewpoint ofERA 

by Mary Ellen Woods 

Sr. Maureen Feedler, repre­senting Catholics for ERA, addressed a small crowd in the Library Auditorium Lounge last night. In her lecture, Feedler presented a Catholic perspec­tive on the Equal Rights Amendment. 
Drawing from ''a distinctive Catholic, religious and scriptor­al tradition," Sr. Feedler ex­amined the text of the ERA. She pointed out that the pro­posed amendment consisted of only 52 words. 
The amendment is prohibi­tive, she emphasized. It does not force any action, nor is there any connection with abor­

tion  or  the  use  of  lavatory  
facilities.  
''Equality for  men  and  wo­ 

men is an integral part of the Judeo-Christian tradition,''

noted Feedler. Vatican II, for­mal Church doctrine, states that any form of discrimination is contrary to God's intent. Sr. Feedler sees ERA as an imple­mentation of the teachings of Vatican II. She also pointed to the gospel as a norm for equal rights, citing Jesus' treatment of the women of his day. 
Sr. Feedler emphatically told 

· the audience of the situation today for the women of Amer­ica. "Women earn $.59 for every $1 that men earn,'' explained Sr. Feedler, quoting a U.S. Government report. 
This situation is not getting better. ''In fact the difference is broadening," she said. In the last decade, women earned $.63 for every $1 earned by men. 
This discriminatory situation can only be corrected by ERA, according to Feedler. The ERA will guarantee equal rights for both men and women. 
Sr. Feedler proposed to end her often dramatic presentation with a discussion of the myths and distortions surrounding the ERA. In fact, her comments were concerned solely with the connection of abortion and the proposed amendment. 

''The ERA is guilty by asso­ciation in regards to the ques­tion of its relation to abortion,'' demonstrated Sr. Feedler. 
ERA has no legal connection with abortion, according to Feedler. It proports to deal with the protection of those rights that are of concern to both men and women. As Sr. Feedler pointed out, men cannot be­come pregnant. Pregnancy be­ing a necessary precondition to the desire for an abortion, the question of equal rights and abortion can and will not be tied to ERA, she said. 
The floor was then opened to questions from the audience. Sr. Feedler was asked to com­ment on the need for ERA in light of the Fourteenth Amend­ment and the Civil Rights Amendments. She noted that as presently interpreted, "these are not grounds for protection 
against sex discrimination.''' 
An interesting point was 
raised regarding the benefits of 
ERA to men. According to Sr. 
Feedler, the rights to be grant­
ed alimony and child custody, 
as well as the responsibility of 
women to aid in military duty 
would be of service to men. 
The discussion frequently de­volved to heated debate as Sr. ·Feedler was asked to defend ERA against ar~uments ques­tioning its effectivity, relevancy and ability to protect the rights of women in particular situa­tions. Sr. Feedler replied con­fidently, ifemotionally, that she knew how the amendment would be implemented, point­ing to the ridiculousness of the fear that men and women would be forced to share the same rest room facilities. 

Sr. Feedler requested sup­port of the Notre Dame· com­munity in the up-coming na­tional, Pro-ERA march on Chicago on May 10. The march on Chtcago is vital, according to Sr. Feedler, in the drive to have Illinois ratify ERA before the 1982 deadline.

The Massachusetts senator, who so far has won only two primary and caucus contests compared with President Car­ter's 18 election triumphs, again attacked Carter's hand­, ling of economic, energy and

Kennedy said he would not withdraw from the race even if Democratic Party leaders asked him to. 
Meanwhile, a Gallup poll done for Newsweek magazine said Carter and Reagan were running about neck and neck in vot'-1s' eyes if they are the major party nominees. Forty­five percent of those question­-:d leaned toward Carter and 44 percent toward Reagan in the poll, which has a margin of error of 4 percent either way. 
Forty-eight percent, inci­dentally, replied that they thought the primaries thus far were not a good way to choose the best-qualified candidates, while 40 percent approved of the system. 
At stake in the New York primary tomorrow are 282 dele­gates to the Democratic National Convention in New York next August. On the same day, primary voters in Connecticut will select 54 con­vention dele~ates.

A daring and thinking Republican 
WASHINGTON--As a dark horse turned into a bright horse, the galloping John An­derson of Illinois has had a change of fortunes equal to his change of views. 
In his early years in Con­gress, 1962 and 1963, his conservative voting record earned him two zeros from the Americans for Democratic Ac­tion, the watchers of the left. Then he went wild and soared to 8 and 11. But in 1966, as though the 8 and 11 were numbers on a timetable and he was holding a through ticket to reckless liberalism, he jumped off the train and went back again to zero (His latest rating was 55). 
After Massachusetts and Vermont of 1980, the zeros Anderson gets now are from the right. Headlines call him a liberal, and he presents himself as a maverick moderate. It is a new public perception, though Anderson himself saw it coming as far back as 1970 when he told an interviewer that except for the "real rightwingers" back in his congressional district, he was supported by all factions of Republicans and Democrats. The right, he said, ''thinks that because I've moderated some of the positions I held origi­nally, I'm sort of Benedtct Arnold.'' 
Although the hanging parties of the right won't be stringing up Anderson now, the question for everyone else, particularly liberals, is whether Anderson is refreshing merely because he is ~ daring and thinking Repub­ltcan among the rote and the dull--the Reagans, Bushes and other sleep inducers--or is he worth noticing because, as Wil­liam Haslitt said of Jeremy Bentham, "He meditates the coming age.'' 
If it's the first, why bother? It was only dumb luck that An~erson found himself pitted agamst Reagan, Bush, Crane, Connally, Baker, and Dole. How could he not seem pro­found? He may be in for still more luck, with Gerald Ford thinking of giving up his life­long goal on the fairways of breaking 90, and becommg a candidate. In the context of the 
primaries, Anderson is a horse 
Colman McCarthy 

among mules. But that doesn't make him a thoroughbred. 
A large debt, for sure, is :>wed him for the lively politics he has offered so far. It's been good theater. He speaks his own mind. He doesn't care much for safe applause lines. He has said a few things that will end up in the quotation books. Best of all, he has made the right kind of enemies: those Republicans whose thought, as George Orwell de­scribed a mind set of his day, "is a kind of playing with fire by people who dorft even know that fire is hot. '' 
Conceding all that, and even being grateful for it, the cheer­ing for Anderson may be pre­mature. No one yet knows exactly how free he is of his old positions or of the thinking processes that led to those positions. He told the gun lobby in New Hampshire where to go last month, but in 1971, when he came up against the supersonic transport zealots, he took safe refuge in the ·jobs argument: he supported SST appropriations because aircraft employees--expecially those in his own distnct--shouldn't be asked to retrain themselves for other work. 
It is heartening that John Anderson has been moving more and more to the left. But when lifted out of the context of backward Republicanism and placed into the context of the political renewal that the tense times call for, he brings to mind the remark ofW.H. Auden: "It is a sad fact ofour culture that a poet can earn much more money writing or talking about his art thaa he can by practicing it." With John Anderson, we are excited by the way he talks about politics, but we know little of how he practices it. 
He is known, for example, as a religious man. He took his duties seriously as a trustee of the Rockford, IL, Evangelical Free Church. He told his House colleagues in a floor debale a few years ago that stopping ''the tide of secu­lansm tn our land is a most desirable objective." But this is standard fare. Jimmy Caner is religious, yer his pohtics are not noticeably altered by the teachings of Christianity. 
The change that has come to John Anderson is one of con­texts. He has shown that a market exists for a thinking Republican graced with a de­veloping mind. But the country needs more than that. It doesn't need a Republican or Democrat. It needs a politician who is above the conventions of parry politics. The country's current politics are assuredly not conventional.

Lipocalyps~ ~hen? 

Francis Ford Coppola is right. It is 
"Apocalypse Now." What was true 
for the people of ) esus' day is 
applicable today. They were given a 
frightening projection of the terrify­
ing experience of the Last Days. But 
the apocalyptic strategy was to draw 
from such future projections lessons 
and pointed exhortations for the 
present moment. People were to 
realize that, in a real sense, the 
future was already happening. 
The same is true for us. We don't have to go past our morning head­lines to discover the current applica­tion of the catastrophic biblical vision. We see, to note but one of numerous examples, Amnesty Inter­national's annual report, which doc­uments that executions, arbitrary arrests and imprisonment and staged disappearances contribute to what is presently a global pattern of human rights abuse. 
With such data, plus the additional cataclysmic vision of world starvation and impending nuclear war, one senses the fulfillment of what Will­iam Butler Yeats anticipated in his famous poem, ''The Second Com­ing": · 
Things fall apart; the center cannot hold Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence zs drowned; " 
The best lack ali conviction, while the worst Are full ofpassionate intensity. 
But there is another purpose of apocalyptic writing beyond admoni­tion, warning and ''final notifica­tion." In the strictest sense, these writers had as their purpose the intention to comfort a people distres­sed and anxious about the future by showing that it is God who is in final control of the world. There is the promise that God will not be absent: "earth and sky may pass away but My words will never pass away'' (Mark 13, 31). In the midst of bad news, there is good news: The Lord will be present in His power to sustain the people. 
Easier said than done. It's a challenge to us to believe this, to believe that, in a world obviously out of control, God is in control. It's crazy and absurd ... like every Christ­ian gamble. We are, for example, meant to live in such a way that it would make no sense unless God exists, unless God cares. In a world going crazy, we crazy Christians are called to affirm joyfully our faith in God. 
And all we have to go on to do this is His word ... and our willingness to believe in it. But does He know what He is talking about? That's the question. Does ) esus' own experi­ence bear out the truth of what He said? 
It is necessary to take a hard look at the Passion, where ) esus faces His own personal apocalypse of pain, judgment and destruction. Jesus' personal world collapses wah as much catastrophe as can be found in the most shatterin~ apocalyptic writ­ing. In the mtdst of His own apocalypse, Jesus was willing to believe that the Father was in control of His world: "Into Your hands I commend My spirit.'' 
And then a marvelous thing hap­pened. It wasn't the end-time, the obliteration of ) esus' world; it was just the end of waiting for the beginning ofglory that would have no end at all. Which means that ) esus' message to us is simple: "You see how I lived? You do the same. You see where I am now? That is your destiny as well--joy and happiness that has no end-time, but is everlast­ing ... for those who are faithful to the end!" 
One last point: ) oy is not only our final destiny; it is meant to be our possession here and now. It follows from the crucial fact that God is not only not absent--His life is within us. This is the cause of our joy, in the midst of all our apocalypses. '')oy,'' Leon Bloy once wrote, "is the most infallible sign of the presence of God.'' Our joy flows necessarily from the realization that the God who comes to heal, to restore life and to liberate is alive within our hearts. 
Thus in the midst of our crazy world, inundated with evidence for despair, we can make our own the words ofScripture: "Shout for joy, 0 daughter Zwn; sing joyfully, 0 Israel! Be gla.d and exult ~ith all 
your heart, 0 daughter)erusalem ... the Lord is in your midst, you have no further misfortune to fear." Crazy Zephaniah could say that at a time of decadence and tragedy. "Rejoice in the Lord always! I say it again. Rejoice! The Lord himself is near." Crazy Paul could say that at a time of persecution and crisis. 
Have you ever noticed that there are probably as many tears at a wedding as at a funeral? The bride's mother lT'ay even bring two handker­chiefs (one for her husband as he contemplates the bills?). Usually we say that they are tears of joy. But I suspect there is a mixture: tears of joy for obvious reasons, and tears of sorrow with the awareness that many rough days lie ahead for the starry­eyed couple. How appropriate this is; for life is ambiguous. 
All our joys seem tainted with sorrow--the "quiet before the storm," the pessimist would say. But all of our sorrows seem to fade away after their initial sharpness-­"Time heals all wounds," the opti­mist would say. However, we do need more than time for a healer. Ultimately, we need God's presence, the source of our joy in the midst of our way of the cross.

Spring rites and Vernal feasts 
When in April the sweet showers fall 
Andpierce the drought ofMarch to 
the root, and all 
The veins are bathedin liquor ofsuch 
power 
As bn"ngs about the engendenng of 
the flower ... 
from the Poet ofSpring, 
Geoffrey Chaucer 

Spring has always been a time for celebrauon. Though all ancient civili­zations had their unique cultural festivals, one theme is common to them all. Spring was a time of death and rejuvenation, and andent peo­ple, out offear and wonder, tradition­ally honored the gods they saw as responsible for the earth's fertility. 
In Egypt, the ancient Feast of Sed, probably the oldest festival of which any traces have survived, was enact­ed to ensure the rejuvenation of the land. 
The pharaoh, being the intermedi­ary between the people and the gods and endowed with divinity, was required to J?erform the seasonal rites ofrejuvenation. He was equated with Osiris, God of the mysteries, (Him whom one may not name), and thus the pharaoh became the dispenser of bounty who filled Upper and Lower Egypt with strength and life. 
The Hebrew spring festival was known as the Pesach or Passover which began as the full moon neared the vernal equinox at which time the firstlings of the lambing season were offered. There were sacrifices to the fertility divinity. 
The Pesach was combined with the assoth or Feast of Unleavened Bread, an agricultural rite recorded in Exodus and Deutoronomy as the annual commemoration of release from rhe Egyptian yoke. The various traditions connected with the Hebrew spring festival were interpretated in terms of these biblical events. 
Greece offers us Dionysius, god of Spring. Ceremonies began on Feb. 11 when the second fermentation of wine came to an end and was ready for drinking. According to Robert Vacca, assistant professor of Modern and Classical Languages, the Greeks were ''very uninhibited' in their methods of celebration. Heavy drink­ing followed with lads jumping on wine skins and girls being swung in swings to promote fertility. 
Greater Dionysia lasted from March 9-13 and was the last of the Dionysian festivals to be instituted in 
Athens. Vacca explained that for these five days, everyone from the lowest slave to the wealthiest citizen was equalized in the spirit of celebra­tion. 
When the Greeks held their Diony­sian festival, the state even paid for the celebration to insure that every­one could enjoy the coming of the 
season.  The  orgiastic  and  ecstatic  
Dionysian  rites,  prominent  in  the  
vintage  festivals  became  rather  

sobered and turned into occasions for presenting the finest literary achieve­ments of poets and dramatists from 100 B.C. onwards. 
According to Vacca, the Dionysian theater had a seating capacity of 17,000. Actors performed comedies and tragedies, representative of the age's classic drama, for three of the five days. 
The Romans also had their unique way of celebrating. Prior to the calendar reforms of ) ulius Caesar, March was the first month and was dedicated to Mars, the agricultural gou.. Apart from also being the war 
god, Mars was invoked to promote 
the prosperity of crops, flocks, and 
herds in addition to the welfare of the 
farmer and his household. 
Statements made by St. Augustine 
in De Civitate Dei,. yield information 
on these festivals. and games. The 
Romans sacrificed cows to Tellus 
Mater (Earth Mother). Ewes and 
cows were fumigated in order to 
propagate freely and provide a 
plentiful supply of milk. The Romans 
believed that if the animals ran 
through fite, they would be more 
fertile. 

The Robigalia was a ceremony to 
avert red mtldew from the wheat. It 
involved a prayer to Robigus, the 
placing ofincense and wine into a fire 
on an altar, together with the flesh of 
sheep and the entrails of a dog. 
The Floralia celebrated the god­dess of flowering plants. It involved licentious games coupled with exces­sive drinking. In 173 B.C., the event became an annual festival by Senate decree. The obscene features of these rites were relics of an earlier fertility cult performed to ensure the earth's fruitfulness. 
The Lemuria was an ex_pulsion ritual practiced in order to dnve out evil spirits who were believed to be excessively rampant in the spring. 
The Lupercalia which originated as a rustic purific.ttion festival for flocks and herds, .. vc-.ved into a fertility rite on the Palatine Hill. Young men would run around the base of the hill, striking all whom they encountered in order to make themselvesfertile. 
Even the -\merican Indians had their special way of celebrating Spring. In a gentle custom, they remo· erl their moccas9ls from their 
feet in order to demonstrate their 
reverence for what they considered 
the pregnant earth. 
Another spring celebration which can be more closely identified with, is the drama of Redemption at the Easter Festival --a climax of the liturgical year. In the representation of the death and resurrection of Christ, the crudities of earlier obser­vances have disappeared. The funda­mental structure, however, has been 
retained. 

Thus Easter in celebrated at the 
full moon nearest to the sprin~ 
equinox between March 21 and Apnl 
25. The blessing of the Easter fire represents a survival of a prominent custom of holding fire festivals at this season. The Paschal Candle itself has solar associations and is a life-giving symbol. At first, it illuminated the nocturnal Vigil rites, but then it was reinterpretated to express victory over sin and death and the power of darkness. 
From Adon, meaning Lord, both Adonis, god of Spring and Adonai, the Supreme being derive their names. AU the beauty of early srring rejoicing is in harmony with Ea5ter. Thus the lilies in the wheelbarrow will always jolt their way to the shrines and altars. 
If you really get enthused with spring, you could follow the exa nple of one Englishwomen centuries ago, who was overcorr.e with spring lew. As she said, "it's the only chir g co wash one's face with.'' So ext erne was she in her belief that she gc r up every morning at 4 to perform this ritual. Follwing suit, many En .ilish people proceeded ro collect dew .rom the grass with silver spoons and bottle it.

Two versions 

Senate debates balancing the budget 
said that the Seniors will leave 
Sunday to accomodate Satur­
day's game. Expenses will 
include seven days and six 
night in Nassau, he said. 

''We figure it will t.:ost some­
where between $400-$450 in­
cluding car rent?.l on the is­
land " Geis said. H~ added 
that the San Fran :isco trip .which would have lasted half as long was priced at about $350. 
''When the surveys came 
back," he said, "Jamaica was 
the overwhelming preference.'' 
But the trip would have cost 
about $500, he said. Plane fare 
alone is $370. 

Juniors were asked to fill out the survey distributed in re­sponse to the "Rumor that the Irish Southern California ~arne would be moved back mto the first week of December thus ending the ABC college series," Geis said. . The San Francisco trip was originally planned to include this game in the itinerary. 
Although the Senior Trip­Committee was informed of the change almost two weeks ago, they were obliged to attribute everything to heresay until ABC made an offictal an­nouncement today, Geis ex­plained yesterday. 
"We are supposed to submit a bill to ABC for the added costs of printed materials and cancellations,'' Gei~ said.

WASHINGTON (AP) -Re­
publicans and Demouats are 
squaring off in the Senate to see 
which stde can come up with a 
more appealing plan for ba­
lancing next year's federal bud­
get. 

The Senate has set aside 
tomorrow for debating the 
~eparate approaches, both of 
which would result in a balance 
between spending and income 
in the 12 months that begin 
next Oct. 1. 

The Repubk:an version go a step further and limit spending during that period to a fixed percentage of national income -a move that Democrats insist would force severe cuts in many programs. 
. While the Senate prepares instructions for its Budget Com­mittee, the House will consider the spending plan already rec­ommended by its budget­writers. That plan would cut $16. 5 billion from the budget submitted by President Carter in January and would result in a $2-billion surplus. 
Rep. Robert Giaimo, D­Conn., chairman of the House Budget Committee, anticipates problems in getting that budget passed. The reason: liberal Democrats insist the budget­cutting fever would gut social programs they've been swear­mg by for years. 
With inflation running at an annual rate of 18 percent, the drive to reduce government spending and balance the bud­get has taken on new life this year. The Carter administration and congressional leaders say a balanced budget will be a major signal to workers and to finan­cial markets that the govern­ment means business in the anti· inflation battle. 
Nine Democrats and 37 Re­publicans have signed the GOP 
plan, which is sponsored princi­
pally by Sen. Bill Roth, R-Del. 
That resolution simply directs 
the Senate Budget Committee 
to ensure that the next budget 
does not exceed 21 percent of 
the Gross National Product, a 
measure of all goods the nation 
produces. 

That would limit spending to either $596 billion, as Roth says, or $584 billion, according to Democratic opponents. 
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie, chairman of the Budget Com­mittee, insisted such limitations would make it more difficult for Congress to deal with the ups-and-downs of the economy and would force unnalistic cuts in spending. 
In an effort to sidetrack the Roth resolution, Muskie won endorsement by the Democratic

his main comi_>etitors for the GOP presidenttal nomination ­George Bush or John B. Ander­son -would be the team player Reagan says he would want in a vtce. presidential running mate. 
Reagan dodged a reply about Bush, without endorsing him in any way. About Anderson, he said: "How could you choose a fellow as vice pre..ident who says he doesn't want you as president and couldn't support you? It's a case of his turning me down.'' 
Later, at an "agriculture day" . event, Reagan was asked whether he favored 100 percent 
Caucus of a substitute that would require a balanced bud­get and earmark any surplus for tax cuts. And to give the Senate a clear choice, 1t would show where additional cuts could be made in order to reach the 21-percent level preferred by Roth. · 
The Senate will continue talking this week about Carter's proposed "windfall-profits" tax on the oil industry, which also is a major part of the war on inflation. 
Republican-led opponents of the bill, which would cost oil producers and royalty owners an estimated $227.7 billion in the 1980s, are drawing out the debate in an effort to force the 
convening of a new Senate­House conference committee that would write a more accept­able version. 
of parity · a subsidized farm price level intended to give farmers the same purchasing power they had before World War I. ''I am not as familiar with some things like that,'' he replied as a murmur of sur­pnse swept his audience of farmers. 
Bush scoffed at the Connecti­cut poll results and proclaimed himself "the new me" who talks only about issues and not public opinion surveys. He also challenged the Carter ad­ministration to explain why the deposed Shah of Iran left exile in Panama, and said he hopes the United States is trying to see that the shah gets the medical treatment he needs.

Griffith dedicates tournam.ent to friend 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) ­Louisville's Darrell Griffith was a man possessed in Saturday's 80-72 NCAA basketball tourna­ment semifinal round victory over Iowa. 
Aboard the team bus on the way to Market Square Arena, the All-America guard said he was feeling sad. 
''He told me he was thinking about Jerry back home,'' said Louisville assistant Wade Houston. 
At a pep rally Friday in Louisville, Griffith had told about 1,000 fans that he was dedicating the tournament to a friend who had cancer. That friend is ] erry Stringer. 
'')'hey go back to grade school,'' Houston said. 
Stringer was the basketball team manager at Louisville's Male High School, a team Houston coached and Griffith guided to the 1975 Kentucky high school basketball title. 
Houston explained that Stringer's dtsease was diagnosed about six months ago as bone cancer, and the resulting medical battle has proved upsetting to Griffith. 
''Darrell saw ] erry right before we left Louisville,'' Houston said. ''It made him sad. So he dedicated the game 

Brown 's 'toughest' decision brings success to UCLA 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -The 
Bruins are back. UCLA once 
again is competing for the 
NCAA basketbalJ title. Tradi­
tion is being served, largely 
because first-year Coach Larry 
Brown had the guts in mid­
season to fly in the face of 
tradition. 
"It was the toughest decision 
I've ever had to make,'' 
reflected Brown on the eve of 
the Bruins' matchup against 
Louisville Monday night for the 
NCAA championship. "But I 
had messed the team up pretty 
good in the beginning of the 
year, and I had an obligation to 
UCLA to get this program 
where it belongs." 
With the Brums struggling at 
8-6, Brown told his players he 
was making some lineup 
changes. Seniors Darrell 
Allums and Gig Sims, as well as 
sophomores Tyren Naulls and 
Tony Anderson were benched. 
This went against the accepted 
way of doing things at UCLA, 
where senwrs are usually 
catered to and pampered. 
''I was doing things because I 
didn't want to hurt peoples' 
feelings," said Brown. "It 
wasn't working, and I know 
why. I wasn't being myself. I 
wasn't coaching the way I know 
I can coach. I wasn't being fair 
to myself, to my players or to 
the program.'' 
So Brown inserted talented 
sophomore Mike Sanders into 
the starting lineup, and also 
gave increased responsibility to 
his ' 'four young whackos' ' ­
freshmen Rod Foster, Michael 
Holton, Darren Daye and Cliff 
Pruitt. 
"I've never seen a group as talented as these kids," said Brown. "They have no fear. They honestly believe they are better than anybody -and sometimes they are.'' Since Brown shuffled his lineup and simplified his offensive and defensive patterns, the Bruins have won 14 of 17 games. They made it into the expanded 48-team NCAA tourney, where they knocked off top-rated DePaul, among others, on their way to the final. 
It was the chance to work with youngsters like the "four whackos'' at a place like UCLA that made the 10b so attractive for Brown. After 6 1/z years of coaching in the pro ranks, he was a nervous wreck when he left the Denver Nuggets under fire on Feb. 1, 1979. 
Leaving the Nuggets to coach at UCLA might be like going from the frying pan to the fire, and while he got burned early, Brown says he's never been happier. 
"I've never had a relationship with players like I have with these kids at UCLA," said the 39-year-old native of Brooklyn, 
N.Y. "The nature of the college game leads to unselfish­ness, which is not the case in the pros. There you read about super players instead of super teams. 
''I wanted to be a teacher and have a real relationship with my players, and I wasn't getting that satisfaction in the pros.'' 
Brown almost took the Memphis State coaching job, but turned it down. The UCLA post, however, was one he could not refuse.

opposite Griffith. 
The freshmen starters on the UCLA team include Rod Foster and Michael Holton in the back-court. One of the starting front court players is a sopho­more, center Mike Sanders, while forwards Kiki Vand­eweghe. and James Wilkes both are semors. 
''I'm sure they'll press us as soon as we leave the dressing room," said Brown. "Ifwe get into a schoolyard game with them, we'll be in deep trouble. 
"We'll have to play team defense and try to stay away from one-and-one situations.'' 
The Bruins have assumed the unofficial title of this year's "Cinderella Team"-a tribute to their late-season resurgence after a poor 8-6 start. They finished fourth in the Pacific ­10 Conference and were among the last teams invited" into the expanded 48 team field. 
''I set so many negative records at UCLA this year that I don't even want to think about it," said Brown. "I can only thank the NCAA for enlarging the field this year so a fourth/lace (conference) team coul be invited.'' 
The Bruins, though, have been playing as well as any 
team  these  days  and  come  
flying  into  the  championship  
game  with  a  string  of  five  

NCAA playoff victories. With Saturday's victory, they im­proved their ,record to 22-9. 
The championship game, fol­lowing the third-place consola­tion game between Iowa and Purdue, will be witnessed live by more than 17,000 fans while millions more will watch on national television. 

again to Jerry on the bus." 
In Saturday's game, Griffith exploded for 16 of Louisville's first 18 points and finished with a game high 34 points. 
''All we could do was go to the boards and watch Darrell,'' said sophomore forward Derek Smith. 
''Iowa took us out of our fastbreak offense and played rough defense, so we had to play their game," said forward Wiley Brown. ''We had to go to Darrell, and he came through

''Griffith is a great player,'' said Iowa Coach Lute Olson. I 'The tighter we played him, the better he shot the ball. He played as well against us as any player ever was.'' 
Iowa's hopes were hurt when guard Ronnie Lester, who scored the first 10 Hawkeye points left the game with his club trailing 22-17 after receiving what Olson said was a

ward to the tiebreaker having 
lost the first set of the match 
after taking a 4-2 advantage 
only to lose it, 4-5. But in thts 
Jeciding best-of-nine points 
rhird set, McMahon rallied 
from a 1-3 deficit to take the 
march, 5-3. 
In another singles match de­< tde"d in a similar fashion, number three Hopwood defear­<'d Grant Rolley, 6-2, 6-7 (4-5) and 5-2 in the make-shift third set. 

The win was coach Tom Fallon's 349th in his 24-year career, surpassing fencing mentor Mike DeCicco for se­cond place on Notre Dame's ~11-rime coaching victory list. Only retired baseball c0ach Jake Kline has more wins with 
552. Fallon also posted 62 wins as wrestling coach before 1969, bringing hi5 grand total to412. 
Saturday's gp ;dge match with Indiana State was sweet re­vmge for the h ish who lost to the Sycamores a year ago, 6-3. The match was all but decided following the six singles competitions with Notre Dame winning four of them. 
McMahon did away with Tin Capulong, 6-2, 7-5 and junior Mark Hoyer battled to a hard­fought victory over Chuck Nor­man in the number four singles match 7-5, 7-6 (5-4). Sopho­mores Tom Hartzell and Tom Robinson wasted little time in beating Galen Scott and Steve Hudack at the number five anp six singles respectively, 6-1, 6-0 and 6-3, 6-1. Robison improved his singles record to 5-l, best on the team. 
The two Irish losses came at the number two and three singles. But after the disap­point:ng lo~ses, Harris and Hop\Vood joined forct"s to take the number one doub·es comp­
etition,  6-2,  2-6,  6-4.  You  
could  tell  things  were  going  
wel1  for  Notre Dame  when  

Carl ton Harris lost control of his racquet after a serve. As the defenseless Harris watched his racquet slide all j,be way to the net, Hopwood put away the Indiana State return for the 
POint. 

'"We're about where we ex­pected to be at this point,'' said Fallon. "Things are looking very good for the rest of the season, and that goal of 20 wins still isn't out of the question. We can only afford one more loss, but with the great attitude on this team, we may not lose any. The leader­ship this year has been great with Carlton (Harris, senior -captain), and these guys have a real winning attitude. They take defeat hard.

Fallou is especially pleased 
with the progress of freshman 
McMahon. The San Diego, 
Calif., native owns a 4-4 record 
thus far with three of the four 
losses coming af5ainst NCAA 
tournament participants. ''I 
think Mark is gaining more 
confidence with every match,'' 
said Fall on. "I think his 
deterrpined performance 
against Capulong and ex­
pecially Van Lieshoot this 
weekend showed th~t. '' 

Fall on will take the team to 
sunny Mexico City and Acapul­
co, Mexico, on Thursday after­
noon for a ten-day, ten-match 
workout/vacation. The team 
will be the guest of a group of 
former Irish players under 
Fallon. "The major objective 
of a trip of this nature is 
conditioning," says Fallon. 
"Playing a match a day on 
mostly clay courts in Mexico's 
high altitude would get any­
body into top shape.. , 

The Irish will need to be in 
top form upon their return as 
they will play 15 matches in a 
23-day span starting with Bel­
larmine on Friday. April 11 is 
the first match of the Notre 
Dame Quadrangular Tourna­
ment. ''I'm looking for the 
team to be playing it's best 
tennis right after we get back. 
With Hawaii, Ohio State, Ind­
iana, Kalamazoo and Western
