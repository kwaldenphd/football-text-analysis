Group hosts Spring Fling for local kids 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 
The Silver Wings Club of Notre Dame helped underprivi­leged children from the South Bend community celebrate the beginning of spring with its annual "Spring Fling" event at Stepan Center Saturday. 
The club provided fun and games for more than one hun­dred children from the Logan Center's "Super Sibs" program, the Robinson Center, St. Margaret's House and the South Bend Center for the Homeless. 
"We just wanted to be able to give these kids who really deserve it a fun day to cele­brate," event coordinator Brittany Shelton said. "It was really fun to put it on and spend the day with them." 
Sophomore Annalise Loehr, who was in charge of enter­tainment and public relations for the event, said Silver Wings' Spring Fling included a variety of activities, including an Easter egg hunt, arts and crafts, cookie decorating and several inflatables. Silver Wings provided lunch for the young participants, who ranged in age from 2 to 14, and Notre Dame's Porn Squad also performed. 
"Just to see [the kids] run­ning around having a great time was really exciting," Shelton said.

SMC goes virtual for career fair 
New event connects students, employers 
By KATIE KOHLER Saint Mary's Editor 

Starting today and continuing through April 5, the Center for Career Opportunities at Saint Mary's will host the first-annual electronic career fair entitled "Opportunity Knocks 2007." 
The fair is powered by MonsterTRAK, a resource for college students seeking their first job. It will feature entry­level, full-time professional and summer internship positions, according to Jeff Roberts, direc­tor of the Center for Career Opportunities. 
"We are trying to make finding a job as easy and convenient for students to respect their busy schedules," he said. "We under­stand that being a full-time stu-. dent is hard enough, so we are doing something contemporary to facilitate that process." 
Over the next two weeks, more employers will have the opportu­nity to join the fair, and Roberts said he is hoping to have 50 to 60 organizations in virtual atten­dance by the time it ends. 
"What you don't see today, may be in the fair tomorrow," he said. "We are waiting for more to come aboard." 
"Opportunity Knocks" is an entirely Web-based event exclu­sively for students. It will cost employers $200 to participate, but offers unlimited postings throughout the fair -a rate

Runners raise funds for Katrina 
By EMMA DRISCOLL 
News Writer 
On Sunday morning, more than 350 racers showed up prepared run the dis­tance -13.1 miles, to be exact -to raise money for victims of Hurricane Katrina in this year's Holy Half Marathon. 
The race drew between 360 and 375 participants in its third year -an increase from last year's race that had "just over 300" runners, marathon direc­tor Kathleen Coverick said. The past two years have seen a significant swell in the number of participants from the first Holy Half held in 2005, which "had prob­ably 80 people" and made a little over $2000, Coverick said. 
Coverick attributed the rise in partici­pation to both talk among interested stu­dents and the distinctiveness of the race as a half marathon. 
"It just definitely spread through word of mouth," she said. "It's just a pretty unique race in that it's the only half

close to the end. Why did I do this? 
Because of Bill Raftery. 

For the first time ever, I actually wanted to watch a game because ofwho was announcing it, more than I wanted to watch it because of who was playing. You will never agree with everything com­mentators say during a game (though with Raftery I often do), so what you look for most in announcers is to bring you the excitement of being there. It enhances the drama of the game and gives you a better viewing experience ifthe announcers get into the game as much as you do. 
Most importantly, you want someone who conveys the element of fun when you are watching. Sports are supposed to be fun. Bill Raftery (and Dick Vitale) match all of the above criteria, Billy Packer (who will be commentating during the entire Final Four) does not. Packer has done every Final Four game on television for the past 32 years and every one I've heard him do, it sounds as though he would rather be somewhere else. In a cruel twist of fate, Raftery and Vitale, who would be excited to announce my broth­er's fifth-grade league games, have never done one on television. 
So when I kept the end of the Ohio State game on Saturday, I treasured the final minutes I had to listen to Haftery until next winter. "Send it in," "Onions" and "With the kiss." will all have to wait for another year. I mean, the guy gelc; excited when somebody properly boxes out or sets a perfect off the ball screen. How can you not love that in an announc­er? 
As for Vitale, as much as some people think he is annoying, you have to respect his love for college basketball. Vitale's inspired lunacy exemplifies everything that is good about college sports and you cannot help but become enthralled in the action when he loses control on air after someone dunks or hits a big shot. 
Some snobbish and arrogant writers feel Vitale, who is a finalist to enter the Basketball Hall of Fame, should not make the final cut because he rarely has any­thing negative to say. So what ifhe only wants to focus on the good in the sport? Since when is this a bad thing? These people need to find more important things to worry about and need to re­evaluate their moral compass when they criticize a man because he does not want to criticize players who are not making millions ofdollars. This is sports, not life or death. Vitale has been good for the game of basketball all his life and has promoted the game through his personal­ity, celebrity and work. 
But alas, Billy Packer, who adds no sense of excitement whatsoever to any­thing he covers, will once again announce the final three games of the college hoops season. Just once, I would love CBS to get Vitale away from ESPN, and throw him with Raftery and Gus Johnson (who goes as nuts as Vitale does when doing the play-by-play ofa game) for the Final Four. 
You would get top-notch analysis, first­class entertainment, and a lot of fun. Oh yeah, and the games might be good too.

Professor exatnines abortion ethics 

By AMANDA GONZALES 
News Writer 
Margaret Hogan, a McNerney­Hanson professor of ethics at the University of Portland, took on the hot-button issue of elective abor­tion during her lecture Friday on "Bioethics Ethics and Its Gordian Knot." 
Hogan, who called abortion a "bloody battle that has taken many lives and left many scars," said it is a subject on which "everyone has taken a stance, but no decision has been made." 
Hogan said she considers elective abortion the "Gordian knot" of medical ethics. The idea of a "Gordian knot" stems from Gordius, ancient king of Phrygia, who tied a knot that was to be undone only by the person who was to rule Asia. That knot was cut, r~ther than untied, by Alexander the Great. 
Hogan said four ideas have "tied" the Gordian knot around the prac­tice of abortion, including a partic­ular philosophy, a particular legal theory, the split of feminism and the form of ignorance that she said pervades American society. 
Hogan said she believes by changing the ways in which our society views abortion -primarily by working to change these four ideas -the Gordian knot can be untied. 
Hogan also spoke about the ideals of motherhood, and how the relationship of a woman to her unborn child is a human union, both physically and morally. Because it is such a union, "the task of the woman is for her to speak for the unborn and its rights," Hogan said. 
She said humans are dependent creatures -not only on God but also on each other -and it is our duty to help those that are helpless, including unborn children. 
Hogan said Catholics are not doing enough to stop the practice of abortion. 
"Catholic intellectuals have sat on the side," she said, stressing the need for greater participation in this heated controversy. Catholics must be willing to take a risk in today's society and can make a change, even though they are small in number, she said. 
Hogan was the 18th lecturer to speak at the 22nd-annual J. Philip Clarke Family Lecture in Medical Ethics series and is also a fellow of Notre Dame's Center for Ethics and Culture. 
The Philip Oarke Family Lecture, hosted by the Center for Ethics and Culture as well as the Notre Dame Alumni Association's Alumni Continuing Education Office, brings 100 practicing physicians and health care workers from around the country to Notre Dame to speak about the issues currently facing the medical community.

Participation was not affected by students who pre-registered for the race online but did not show up for the race, due to large num­ber of people who signed up on the day of the race. Coverick said the nearly 100 walk-ups showed up Sunday morning. 
Law student 'Dan McGrath fin­ished first with a time of 1:11.03. While he said he was happy to have done so well, he enjoyed the whole experience of the run. 
"It was fun to get the win, but I didn't really take too much out of it," he said. "It was a campus run, it was a charity thing. It was fun." 
McGrath has been training to run in the Boston Marathon in three weeks. He said he does a specific workout each week, along with a progressively longer run. McGrath said the Holy Half was just like another workout to him. . "This was what I was going to do this weekend anyway," he said. 
McGrath said there were people all over campus cheering for the runners. 
"I was really impressed with how many people showed up and how many people were out there cheering," he said. 
The race raised around $6,000 -about the same as last year ­to be donated to Operation Helping Hands, according to Coverick. She said Helping Hands is the project of Catholic Charities in New

Roberts said is "far below that of internet and newspaper listings." 
Students participating will be provided a link to register, allow­ing them to view the openings and submit a resume. 

"Students spend an average of three to four hours on the internet a day," Roberts said. "We are hop­ing that when they're online, they jump around our site and utilize the programs." 
The career fair is targeted at Saint Mary's students, but Notre Dame undergraduates are also invited to participate. While some positions are in higher demand than others, the Center for Career Opportunities is willing to make arrangements to ensure a strong turnout, according to Roberts. 

"To fill postings in such 'high need' areas, such as special edu­cation teacher~ or nursing, we may also invite additional guests from select programs at area col­leges and universities," Roberts said. 
Alumnae are also invited to par­ticipate if they are interested in any of the jobs. 
"As the fair is designed to fea­ture internships and entry-level professional positions for current students, alumnae seeking this level of work are definitely invited as guest<;," Roberts said. 
In the past, Saint Mary's has hosted an annual career fair in the fall called the "Showcase of Careers," which was suspended this year to prepare for this event. 
"The 'Showcase of Careers' is undergoing an overhaul and should reappear on our program­ming schedule in the fall," Roberts said. '"Opportunity Knocks' is a new offering to build strong rela­tionships with high quality employers." 
This new program, however, was not intended to replace "Showcase of Careers."

''I've done service with them before and a lot of Notre Dame students, when they do service in New Orleans, that's the organiza­tion they work through," Coverick said. 
Funds from last year's race were also donated to I Ielping Hands. 
Runners could load up on carbo­hydrates at a dinner catered by Olive Garden on Saturday night, which raised $250 of the $6000, Coverick said. Senior Alli DeJong spoke during the dinner about the situation in New Orleans, accord­ing to Coverick. 
Runners paid a $15 dollar entrance fee that Coverick said will "go right to the charity," because campus organizations covered the costs of the race. 
Sunday's warm weather might have proved to be an unexpected obstacle for runners, because many participants had become used to running in cold weather during the winter months, Coverick said. 
Fortunately, 20 people from First Aid Services Team (FAST) were there to help runners. 
"There were three major first aid incident<> -all of which hap­pened within ninety seconds of one another -but all are OK now," Coverick said via e-mail. "The [FAST] team member I spoke with attributed it to a mid-race heat wave. Most cases were ones of exhaustion rather than acute leg injuries, but I'm sure lots of people will be icing over the next few days."

"We are always trying to do things better," Roberts said. "Making it virtual will allow more employers to participate without having to make the trip." 
Roberts said the Center for Career Opportunities is using this experience to "re-tune" the "Showcase for Careers" for next year. 
They are also hoping student turnout will be higher due to the timing. 
"Now that we are holding it in the spring, more people are look­ing into the job market for the sununer," he said. "A different mix of students will be present, but the strongest group to participate will probably be liberal-arts sopho­mores and juniors looking for internships." 
The advantages of the new career fair, Roberts said, is differ­ent for each participating group. 
"From an employer's perspec­tive, it is the lowest cost and most convenient may to meet high­quality candidates," he said. "From a student's perspective, they get direct access to nation­wide opportunities with high qual­ity organizations." 
The College, Roberts said, may be benefiting the most. 
"Building effective personal­recruiting relationships with top organizations creates benefits in new student recruitment, fundraising, collaboration with the faculty and career programming," he said. "It is a positive step in moving Saint Mary's College toward the upper echelon in national liberal arts colleges." 
The Center for Career Opportunities will work with the participating organizations to arrange interview schedules to screen candidates either over the phone or in the campus offices. 
"At this first shot, I would be ecstatic if 500 students participate. That would be overwhelming," Roberts said.

EU leaders call for Sudan sanctions 
Britain and Germany called Sunday for tougher action against Sudan to end four years of blood­shed in Darfur, where the new U.N. humanitari­an chief warned of a possible collapse in the massive effort to aid refugees from the violence. 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair called the actions of Sudan's government "unacceptable" and German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the Darfur region's suffering "unbearable." 
Experts say the few economic sanctions imposed on Sudan by the United States and European Union have done little, and U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon recently voiced his frustration at Sudan's government for refusing to let a 22,000­strong U.N. peacekeeping force into Darfur. 
Sudan has angered the West by repeatedly rejecting the U.N. peacekeepers. And prosecu­tors at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, linked Sudan's government to atrocities in Darfur, naming a junior minister as a war-crimes suspect. 
Britain backs N. Ireland government 
BELFAST, Northern Ireland -Britain said Sunday it intends to try to hand power immedi­ately to a new Catholic-Protestant administra­tion for Northern Ireland -but is open to Protestant demands for an extension to May. 
Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hairr said Saturday's decision by the major Protestant party, the Democratic Unionists, to reject his Monday deadline would not spell the end of Britain's decade-old effort to forge a stable powp,r-sharing administration. 
I lain noted that the Democratic Unionists have pledged for the first time to forge a coalition with Sinn Fein, the major Catholic-backed party, by an unspecified date in May. Britain would do what it could to make sure this happened, he said.

Both parties criticize Gonzales 
WASHINGTON -Republican support for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales eroded Sunday as three key senators sharply ques­tioned his truthfulness and a Democrat joined the list of lawmakers who want him to resign over the firing of eight federal prose­cutors. 
"We have to have an attorney general who is candid and truthful. And if we find out he's not been candid and truthful, that's a very compelling reason for him not to stay on," said Sen. Arlen Specter, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees the Justice Department. 
Specter, R-Pa., said he would wait until Gonzales' scheduled April 17 testimony to the committee -on the dismissals before deciding whether he could continue to sup­port the attorney general. He called it a "make or break" appearance.

Iran still holding 15 U.K. marines 
Blair calls capture ofsailors a 'serious, fundamental issue'for ~ritish government 
Associated Press 
LONDON -British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Sunday that 15 British sailors and marines cap­tured by Iran as they searched for smugglers off the Iraqi coast had been outside Iranian waters, and warned that Britain viewed their situation as "very seri­ous." 
The group was seized at gunpoint on Friday, and the Foreign Office in London said British officials do not know where Iran is holding them. 
Speaking at an EU summit in Berlin, Blair said Iran's claim that the sailors had crossed into Iranian territo­rial waters "is simply not true." 
"I want to get (the situa­tion) resolved in as easy and diplomatic a way as possi­ble," B.lair said, but added he hoped the Iranians "understood how funda­mental an issue this is for the British government." 
Britain said its diplomats met with Iranian officials in Tehran on Sunday, and their demand for access to the group was denied after Iran refused to say where they were being held. 
"This is a very serious sit­uation," Blair said. 

In New York, Iranian Foreign Minister seized, saying this "very about the condition of the the case "required an Manouchehr Mottaki said detailed information has British sailors and marines. inquiry into such suspicious British Foreign Minister been submitted to the rep­He was told by Rahimpour events."

Lavvyerin Duke rape case dies 


AP Kirk Osborn, a lead defense attorney in the Duke lacrosse sexual assault case, died Sunday. 
Associated Press 

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. ­Kirk Osborn, a lead defense attorney in the Duke lacrosse sexual assault case, died early Sunday, a fellow defense attorney in the case said. He was 64. 
Osborn had a massive heart attack on Friday and died shortly before 1 a.m. Sunday, attorney Joe Cheshire said. 
Osborn represented Reade Seligmann, one of three Duke lacrosse players charged in the case stem­ming from a dancer's allega­tion she was sexually assaulted at a team party. The players were originally indicted on charges of rape, sexual offense and kidnap­ping, but Durham District Attorney Mike Nifong dropped the rape charges in December after the accuser changed a key detail in her story. 
All three have steadfastly maintained their innocence. 
"We will never forget Kirk and his sacrifices for Reade and for justice," Seligmann's family said in a statement. "Kirk's fight for the truth and for justice in this case met the highest standards of ethics and professionalism and stand in stark contrast to those who condemned Reade. 
He is an example of what a lawyer should be." 
Actions by Osborn in the case included a motion with phone records and security camera images showing Seligmann would have been nearly a mile away from the Dvrham house at the time the woman said he was tak­ing part in the attack. 
Osborn also filed a motion to have Nifong removed from the case, arguing that Nifong went after the lacrosse play­ers to win votes. 
In January, Nifong asked the state attorney general's office to take over the inves­tigation after the state bar charged Nifong with several ethics violations tied to his conduct in the iacrosse case. If convicted of the ethics vio­lations, Nifong could be dis­barred. 
Hockey

Porrazzo said he thought Notre Dame was at a disad­vantage when they lined up against the Spartans on Saturday, especially since Michigan State had defeated Boston University 5-1 in the NCAA first round. 
"MSU came off a huge advantage after beating BU. and they obviously had the momentum at the beginning of that game to beat us," he said. 
Muldoon, however, said he was very pleased that the fans still showed incredible support for the team. 
"The hockey band was incredible, helping every­body stay rowdy even after the [Spartans! had a two­point lead," he said. "I was scared that the crowd is going to go flat." 
Still, Muldoon said both he and the hockey band were there to keep that from hap­pening. "The greatest things are that we have an incredi­ble coach and fan base," he said. 
Senior Joe Dosch said the high turnout of fans kept the game intense. 
"We were expecting to be outnumbered by the Michigan State fans, but when we got that first goal, we were so into the game that it didn't feel that way," he said. 
And despite the fact the hockey team came so close to victory, the fact that they had made it that far was still exciting for students like freshman Jordan Carey. 
"A 32-7-3 record isn't bad," Carey said. "Though I was disappointed, it's always good to see a Notre Dame team exceed expecta­tions." 
And, as Dosch pointed out, there's always next year. 
"I've been following the hockey team since I was a freshman, and it's pretty exciting to see where the hockey team is going," he said. "And it dnfinitely seems like the program is going in the right dimetion."

IN BRIEF 
Eli Lilly challenged on cancer drug 
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. -Eli Lilly and Co. has fended ofT patent challenges from generic drug makers who want to copy star seller Zyprexa. But now rivals want a piece of No. 2 seller Gemzar. 
The Indianapolis drug maker has filed three lawsuits against companies that want to make generic versions of Gemzar, an injectible chemotherapy that treats several forms of can­cer and rang up $1.4 billion in sales last year. 
The challengers say their versions of the Lilly drug will help lower health care costs. Lilly argues that its patent is legitimate, and it needs the billions of dollars from future drug sales to fund more research. 
The company also has launched a patent defense for the osteoporosis drug Evista, which brought in $1 billion last year. 
"I would say it's critically important that they maintain the intellectual property for (Gemzar) and for Evista," said Seamus Fernandez, an ana­lyst who covers Lilly for Leerink Swann. 
Lilly has a mixed record on patents so far. In December, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a 2005 ruling that backed the company's patent protecting the anti­pyschotic drug Zyprexa. 
Stocks rise amid jump in home sales 
NEW YORK -Stocks closed mostly higher Friday, sending the Dow Jones industrials' to their best week in four years after a surprise jump in home sales eased concern that frailty in the housing market will hurt economic growth. 
Existing home sales rose by the biggest amount in nearly three years in February amid a sharp increase in sales in the Northeast, the National Association of Realtors said. The 3.9 percent increase was the largest since a siinilar jump in March 2004; analysts had been expect­ing a decrease. 
Still, the report did have some downbeat aspects -the median price of a home fell year­over-year for the seventh straight month and inventories rose. 
The Federal Reserve this week said an "adjustment" in the housing sector was continu­ing, offering some relief for investors left unnerved by the woes among so-called sub­prime mortgage lenders.

Pizza boxes turned into wanted posters 

Associated Press 
CINCINNATI -Customers at some suburban pizza parlors are getting something extra with their pepperoni and mushrooms -wanted posters for parents accused of failing to pay child support. 
The idea came to Cynthia Brown, executive director of the Butler County Child Enforcement Agency, while she was ordering pizza. 
"It suddenly dawned on me that most people running from the law don't eat out, they order pizza," said Brown, whose coun­ty is north of Cincinnati. 
Enforcement agencies across the country use a variety of methods to locate support scofflaws and collect past-due payments. Virginia has issued subpoenas to cellular phone companies seeking addresses and phone numbers. California's Kern County seizes and auctions parents' vehicles, with proceeds going to the children, said Kay Cullen, a spokeswoman for the National Child Support Enforcement Association. 
State child support agencies collected more than $23 billion in child support for 17.2 million children in 2005, but the cumu­lative past-due child support since the agencies were first formed more than 30 years ago is $106 billion, Cullen said. 
"While we have made progress, putting the wanted posters on pizza boxes is an example of the innovation and commitment that we need," she said. 
Other Ohio counties put 
posters on their Web sites and work with local Crime Stoppers programs, and a few contract with companies that can track people through rental and ct~ll phone records, according to the Ohio Child Support Directors Association. Some include fliers in water and sewer bills. 
Butler County has printed posters with mug shots of its 10 most-wanted parents, placing them in post offices and other government buildings and send­ing them to Ohio's 87 other counties. The lineup, chosen by prosecutors, is changed twice a year. 
The Butler County sheriff's office served 1,224 nonsupport warrants last year, said sherifl"s Sgt. Todd Langmeyer. The coun­ty has about 350,000 residents. 
Brown approached several restaurants and chains with her idea of affixing the posters to pizza boxes, but so far only three pizzerias are participating. 
Since the first pizza posters appeared in August, they have led to one arrest, Langmeyer said. "It's a good idea any time you can put the faces out there," he said. 
The owner of Karen's Pizzeria hasn't heard any complaints about her participation in the poster program. 
"Some customers joke about it and say they're glad they aren't on it," Karen Willis said. "Most seem to think it's a good idea." 
An attorney who focuses on fathers' rights cases called the tactic "horrible." 
"It's just a way of shaming peo­ple," said Maury Beaulier, whose firm is in Eden Prairie, Minn. 
Debate on interspecies cloning sees new life 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO -It was nearly a decade ago that Jose Cibelli plugged his own DNA into a cow's egg in a novel cloning attempt that was con­demned as unethical by President Clinton and landed the Michigan State University researcher in a mess of contro­versy. 
Even though Cibelli and his colleagues patented the so-· called interspecies cloning technique, they soon aban­d<Jned the research as a failure and 'the uproar subsided. Now the tempest is brewing all over again. 
At least three respected teams of British scientists have reignited the moral debate over inserting human genes into ani­mal eggs by proposing experi­ments similar to Cibelli's. 
Their goal is to eliminate the need for women to donate eggs for the cloning of human embryos, a research goal they say will enable them to better understand the genetic causes of many diseases and design personalized medicines. 
Currently, the few scientists actively pursuing human cloning are hobbled by a nearly nonexistent human egg supply. And each researcher will need thousands of them. 
"Getting eggs from women is the bottleneck to cloning," Cibelli said. "An alternative would be welcomed." 
All three U.K. teams aim to get around that bottleneck by taking DNA from patients sick with a disease like Alzheimer's and fuse it with cow eggs that have had all their genetic mate­rial removed. The hope is that the human DNA will trick the eggs into thinking they're preg­nant, beginning development. 
After about five days of growth, the cloned embryos would be destroyed and the stem cells extracted. The stem cells would be grown in their labs and the researchers could look for the onset of diseases, study their development and test experimental drugs on the cells. 
"You can model Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease in a dish," said Stephen Minger, director of the Stem Cell Laboratory at King's College in London. 
Minger's request for a gov­ernment license to use cow eggs instead of women's eggs to generate human embryonic stem cells stirred significant controversy in the United Kingdom last year. His applica­tion with the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority -along with another from Lyle Armstrong of the North East England Stem Cell Institute -is expected to be ruled on later this year.

A tnodest catnpaign proposal 
Today, I am announcing my future intention to possibly form an exploratory committee which could potentially uncov­er the chance that I may or may not declare my unofficial candidacy for the nomination of a partie­war party for the presi­dency of the United States of America. (Technically, I have to wait until I am 35 to do this, but if the curnmt primary season has proven anything, it's that it is never too early to start nmning for president. Consequently, all of my campaign promises will apply to the 2020 elec­tions.) 
My fellow Americans, this nation stands at a crossroads. We can merely sit back and allow the numerous problems facing the world to pile up like a stack of greasy dishes that were stolen from the dining hall and now sit in the rancid compost heap that is your oll'-campus kitchen sink. Or, we can put down our Nintendo Wii remotes, march into that kitchen, scrub the hell out of those dishes and get to work fixing the rest of America's troubles. 
If! am elected president of the United States (in 2020), Am(~rica will begin tack­ling those problems which have festered in its kitehen sink for far too long. The time has come to ask not what you can do lor your country, but what your country can sack up and start doing for you. When I am finished with this place, Ameriea will be so much more than the shining city on a hill promised by Ronald Reagan -it will be a scintillating casino standing like a beacon of hope in the middle of an Indian reservation. 
My first act as president (in 2020) will be to solve America's growing dependency on foreign oil. Others have suggested devel­oping new fuels like ethanol, some have advocated building hybrid cars and a few more have encouraged tapping into the oil supplies of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I, however, oll'cr an entirely new possibility: whale oil. 
Throughout much of the 18th and 19th centuries, the United States dominated the global market in this most lucrative of hunting expeditions. Heroic whalers departing from New England sailed the seven seas in the hopes of bringing glory, money and vast supplies of wonderful whale <iil back to the shores of America. For much of this era, nearly aU of America's oil needs worn satisfied by the burning of whale spermaceti, and I see no reason why this great nation cannot return to those glory days when men were men and whales were merely fat wads of blubber meant to be incinerated into vats of hot oil. It's ealled manifest destiny, peo­ple. So let's quit whining about saving the whales and start hurling enormous barbnd harpoons into their eyes until they helplessly bb~d to death for the sake of our V8 en)..,rines. 

My second act as president (in 2020) will be to eradicate the global warming that AI Gore has recently been so bold as to inconvenience us all with. Sure, we could take the easy way out and reduce our car­bon dioxide emissions to Kyoto Protoc:ol standards, but what's the fun in that? We're America-the land of' the free and the home of' the Cadillac Escalade. Let's solve global warming the American way. 
I hereby propose that we compensate for the dwindling ozone layer by con­structing a new atmospheric layer of insu­lation out of one of this eountry's greatest heat protoetors-asbostos. Yes, my lbllow Americans, for decades we insulated our homes, schools and ollices with this mag­nificent substance, and at what risk? A lit­tle lung cancer? 
Ladies and gentlemen, let me be the first to say that I would mueh rather proteet our polar iee eaps and our eoastlines while contracting asbestosis than have Miami Beach and its topless women sink into the Atlantic with a bunch of drowning polar bears while I come down with melanoma. This nation was built upon sacrifice, and now we must follow in the footsteps of other American martyrs -like Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr. and Anna Nicole Smith -by sacrilidng ourselves lor the greater good of this country. 
Finally, the problem of illegal immigra­tion has long burdened lawmakers who must attr~mpt to balance the rights of dili­gent immigrant families with those of American citizens whose way of life is often risked by this influx of illegal work­ers. Everything from massive deportations to Great Walls of China to complete 
amnesty has been proposed, but none of 
these plans truly protect the American 
people. 
As your president (in 13 years), I will solve this problem for good by using a sim­ple protective measure that I picked up from some of my favorite medieval knight movies. I'm talking, of course, about moats. In a matter of months, the entire U.S.-Mexican border will be trenched out like a World War I battlefield. We will then fill this ditch with billions of gallons of the murkiest water in the country-derived mostly from Lake Erie and the north Jersey shore. Finally, we will load this moat with the most ferocious animals known to man, including crocodiles, hip­popotamuses, stingrays, the University of Miami football team, piranhas and. of course, tl1e Loch Ness Monster. 
The only way into America from Mexico will eventually be an enormous wooden drawbridge that spans between San Diego and Tijuana in southern California.

Well, after unsuccessfully pnti­tioning the Democratic, Hepublican, Libertarian, Green and Know-Nothing Parties, I was forced to branch off and start the Dance Party for the sake of this great nation. 
So in 13 years, with these policies at my side, the Dance Party and I will be on to Iowa, on to New Hampshire, on to South Carolina and on to the White House! Yeaaaaaaaaah! 
Oh, and God bless the United States of America.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Logo conflict embarrassing 
As a graduate of Cathedral lligh School and a current student at Notre Dame, I am both frustrated and saddened by the recent events occurring between both schools regarding Cathedral's use of the Leprechaun as its mascot. When Cathedral was founded in 1918 by the Congregation of Holy Cross, the same order as the founding priests of Notre Dame, the school took the nickname of the Fighting Irish. It is interesting to note what Notre Dame's football team was called before Cathedral opened in 1918. Notre Dame was the "Ramblers" and Hoekne changed the nickname after hearing about the Indiana high school's nickname through the brothers at Holy Cross who ran both institutions at the time. There were strong connections between the two schools, both Irish Catholic, and Cathedral was seen as a smt of stepping stone to Notre Dame. 
It seems that many do not realize that Cathedral actually designed the Leprechaun logo. When Cathedral developed this logo, Notre Dame liked it and asked to use it, then proceeded to go ahead and trademark the logo. Furthermore, it is not as if Cathedral is stealing from the Notre Dame market by using the Leprechaun. The revenue Cathedral generates by the use of this logo is miniscule to the amount of money Notre Dame is able to generate. Does Notre Dame truly feel threatened by a high school? And honestly, if Notre Dame is banning Cathedral from using the Leprechaun due to revenue issues, then the University has its prior­ities way out of line. 
I am sure that many of my current classmates at Notre Dame are saying "Get over it and stop worrying about a high school mascot." But I say to them, ifyou have not been part of the Cathedral tradition, then you just won't understand, just as someone who has not been part of the Notre Dame tradition will not understand the strong love for our university. However, I am ashamed to say I am part of a school that turns their back on family.

Thanks for a successful 
hockey season 
Thank you Noah, Mike, Brett, David, Stewart, Erik, Brian, Kevin, Christian, T.J., Dan, Kyle, Christiaan, Tom, Wes, Jason, Jordan, Evan, Garrett, Tom, Josh, Brock, Ryan, Mark, Dan, Justin and Coaches Jackson, Pooley and Slaggert for being the greatest hockey team in Notre Dame his­tory. You guys accomplished a lot this season and set the bar high for future teams. You were the first Notre Dame team to win the regular season CCllA title, the CCI-lA tournament championship and an NCAA Tournament game. You more than doubled your wins from last season. You lit up the big num­ber one on top of Grace Hall for two months. 
We remember how last year we were able to roam freely in the nearly empty stands, and Mike's "Get in the box!" could be heard anywhere in the North Dome of the JACC. Today it is a little harder to hear Mike since there are now thousands of cheering fans every game. You have drawn sellout crowds to the JACC for more games than we cp.n remember. You were the guys who brought people to wait two hours in line for tickets that were not even guaranteed. You reinvigorated a f~;~,n base, created an aura of confi­dence and gave fans a mindset for victory. 
When you look back at the season, just remember that among the many things you accomplished, you decimated then-No. 1 Boston College (though only by six goals) and sent the Wolverines scampering back to Ann Arbor three times. You guys deserve to play in a new arena (to whomever it may concern: build it soon please), and you showed Notre Dame how fun hockey can be. Thank you for this season. 
Every fan should cheer as loudly as Mrs. Thang. Go Irish.

Facebook not real campaigning 
With the future presidential election looming, students normally would have to do research in order to make a good decision regarding who will receive their vote. However, in this election, students won't have to look any further than their Facebook accounts; that is, ifthey want to know which candidate likes the same kind of music they do. Jackie Stark 
Presidential hopefuls have actually 
Northern
begun to create their own Facebook profiles. Michigan This sort of campaigning, ifit can University 
The North l'Vind
even be called that, has made me question how elections are run. Sure, going on Facebook is a good way to get your name out to college-age students, but do we really need to know that one of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney's favorite singers is Roy Orbison, or that Mark Twain's "Huckleberry Finn" is among his favorite books? 
If these candidates want to use Facebook as a means of reaching out to the younger generations, they should at least be informing them on their political views and posi­tions on issues such as education, health care or the Iraq war. 
Yet instead of useful information, whieh citizens should be basing their votes on, we learn that Senator John McCain's favorite book is Hemingway's "For Whom the Bell Tolls" and that one of his interests is baseball. 
And some of these presidential hopefuls even leave out some of the basic information that can be found at the top oftheir profiles. For example, Hillary Clinton lets everyone on Facebook know that her hometown is Chappaqua, New York, but her "relationship status" is not mentioned. I wonder what Bill thinks about that. 
Senator McCain and Governor Romney don't even state what their political views are. It seems as though they are hesitant to let the world know that, yes, they belong to the Republican Party. 
If I were to use these candidates' Facebook profiles as deciding factors in my vote, then I would have to say that Senator John McCain would be receiving it, because he listed "Seinfeld" as one of his favorite TV shows. How bad could he be ifhe loves this classic sitcom? Governor Romney would definitely be out, as his taste in music is severely lacking. (I just can't bring myself to vote for someone who enjoys Alan Jackson.) Clinton and Barack Obama wouldn't even stand a chance, as they have no personal information on their profiles at all. Tlieir lack of candor makes me wonder what they don't want the rest of us to know. 
The truth is that in today's world of online everything, these candidates are using the best possible medium to reach people in the younger generations. Our generation is partly to blame, as more of us voted for the next American Idol than for George Bush in the previous elec­tion. In last year's season of the show, 63.4 million votes were cast, according to washingtonpost.com. This is more than the amount of votes cast in the entire presidential election, and much more than were actually cast for President Bush. 
Anyone looking at the walls of these candidates can also see our lack of seriousness when it comes to choosing our next president. 
Clinton was called "a goddess" by a supporter. However, looking two wall posts down reveals an Obama supporter who befriended Clinton only to let all of her supporters know, "Life's a bitch, so don't vote for one." 
One Facebooker expressed his love for McCain on McCain's wall, while another called him an "insult to true Republicans." 
Obama has received over 100 gifts, 79 of which are the foam fingers saying super on them. Another of his many wall posts is a chain letter in which he is named as one of the sender's 15 prettiest girls on his friends list. 
This infiltration of Facebook by presidential candidates was a bad idea to begin with. Favorite movies and witty quotes should not factor into anyone's decision on who to vote for in any presidential election. However, now that they are on there, perhaps Facebookers can use their pro­files for something a little more constructive than sending the candidates gifts of toilet paper and soap to help them clean up the country.

MySpace usage may lower grades 
Social networking sites such as MySpace might seem like an easy way to stay in touch with friends; however, a new study has shown that the use of these sites can seriously impact grades. 
A survey of more than 500 students from three Fresno, Calif., area high schools Johnna has shown that 72 percent of stu-Scrabis dents who use MySpace have . reported a significant drop in Pennsylvanza their grades. State 
The study began when Roberto l!niversity_ Vaca, a guidance learning spe-Dazly Collegzan cialist at Sanger High School, noticed that students with lower grades were spending a lot of time on MySpace. 
According to the study, 42 percent of students with MySpace accounts frequently have MySpace open while doing homework. 
Vaca called Tamyra Pierce, assistant professor of communications and journalism at California State University, Fresno. Pierce became involved and began contacting local high schools to see if 1:here was a link between MySpace and lower grades. 
The survey specifically targeted high school stu­dents, but Pierce said the results could be similar for college students. 
"In talking to a lot of my students, I have seen that they too spend a lot of hours on MySpace," she said. 
Pierce said many students reported spending an upward of four to five hours a day on MySpace, which would detract from homework time. Even more alarming in Pierce's opinion was the amount of pornography she found on the MySpace accounts of young teenagers. 59 percent of the sites included sexual poses and nine percent included direct links 
to pornography, she said. "There are just so many risks associated with that," Pierce said. The survey said 34 percent of students will delay homework to spend time on social networking sites. 
Rob Dunlap, a sophomore communications major, said for him, MySpace is a distraction from doing recreational activities outside. 
"I keep getting rid of it and then getting it back again because I'm addicted," he said. "It's like cocaine."

DPAC REVIEW 

Met's rousing 'Barber of Seville' comes to ND 
By ANALISE LIPARI 
Assistant Scene Editor 

The Metropolitan Opera House in New York City isn't exactly easy walking dis­tance from the Notre Dame campus. The DeBartolo Performing Arts Center (DPAC), however, bridged that gap this Saturday in the first of its ongoing series of live opera broadcasts from the Met with "II Barbiere di Seviglia," or "The Barber of Seville." 
In an effort to bring opera to a wider audience than those close to an opera house, the Met will, via satellite, bring its latest operas to movie theaters around the world, including the DPAC's THX-cer­tified Browning Cinema. With its talented performers, ingenious design and Gioachino Rossini's gorgeous music, "II Barbiere di Seviglia" was a wonderful start to the series. 
The Met, which was the site of the opera's original premiere nearly a centu­ry earlier, seemed an appropriate location for this latest incarnation of the work. This production of the "Barber of Seville" featured famed Juan Diego Flores as the dashing Count Almaviva, Joyce DiDonato as the feisty heroine Rosina and Peter Mattei as the incomparable barber, Figaro. Rounding out the cast were John Del Carlo as Rosina's curmudgeonly guardian, Doctor Bartolo and John Relyea as his sinister assistant Don Basilio. The production was directed by Bartlett Sher and designed by Michael Yeargan, both of whom worked on the Tony award-win­ning musical "The Light in the Piazza." 
The story of 'The Barber of Seville" is often less familiar to audiences than its music. The ubiquitous line "Figaro, Figaro, Figaro" often comes to mind, and music from the opera has been widely featured in popular culture, ranging any­where from Robin Williams singing Figaro's "Largo al Factotum" in the 1990s film "Mrs. Doubtfire" to Chuck Jones's Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd in Looney Tunes' "Rabbit of Seville." The audience's inevitable familiarity with key melodies added a different layer of enjoyment to what is often an infrequently viewed type of performance. 
Rossini's opera opens with Almaviva singing to the empty balcony of his love, Rosina, while disguising himself as "Lindoro," a humble servant. Rosina begins to fall in love with the Count's beautiful music, but is held captive by her guardian, the elder Doctor Bartolo, who wants nothing more than to marry Rosina himself. In near despair, Almaviva finds the help he needs in the skillful hands of the traveling town barber (and part-time matchmaker), Figaro. Through an intricate series of plot twists, disguises and schemes, the two lovers escape the clutches of Bartolo and find love in one another's arms, with Figaro watching and laughing over all of Seville. 
A medium often unfamiliar to most col­lege students, opera is a blend of power­ful music and impeccable vocal talent. In this production of "The Barber of Seville," neither was in short order. Flores and Mattei were both delightful; each gave their well-known roles a different and personal touch, with Mattei in particular making Figaro his own with llavor and good-natured humor. 

Other highlights included Claudia Waite as Berta, Bartolo's beleaguered servant, and her performance of "II vecchiotto cerca moglie;" the ingeniously designed set, which featured a number of oversized doors on wheels that gave the set a fluidi­ty and energy; and the effective use of an extended platform in front of the orches­tra pit, which allowed for each performer to literally get in touch with their audi­ence.

The High Definition technology used in the broadcast also added to the appeal, as the camerawork highlighted the perform­ers with remarkable clarity. 
With both this impressive performance and a broadcast of Puccini's "II Trittico" to be featured at the Browning on April 28 (with others to follow during the next academic year), the DPAC's showcasing of live opera from the Met can only grow in bringing new audiences to a timeless art form.

MOVIE REVIEW 

Penelope Cruz illuminates AlmodOvar's 'Volver' 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Senior Staff Writer 

No film by writer-director Pedro Almodovar is ultimately what it seems to be about, and "Volver," his latest, is no exception. His pictures, which are usually sensitive and perceptive melo­dramas, start simplistically, but gradu­ally reveal their thematic complexity -often, as in the case of the critically acclaimed "Hable con ella" ("Talk to· Her"), things are not all that they seem. "Volver" is the work of the director at the height of his cinematic powers, a film that is simultaneously funny, touching and sad. 
The film follows two sisters, Raimunda (Penelope Cruz) and Sole (Lola Duenas). Raimunda is a janitor who lives with her unemployed hus­band Paco (Antonio de la Torre) and daughter Paula (Yohana Coho) in Madrid. At the beginning of the film, the sisters visit their Aunt Paula (Chus Lampreave), who is being cared for by the neighbor Agustina (Blanca Portillo). 
After Paula (Raimunda's daughter) accidentally kills Paco when he tries to sexually assault her, Raimunda takes a job catering for a film crew at the

Meanwhile, Aunt Paula dies and Sole goes to the funer­al, where she believes she sees the surprisingly corporeal spirit of her dead mother Irene (Carmen Maura). From there, "Volver" takes on an almost mythical quality, but Almodovar has the good sense to ground the film and resolve its issues in ways that are logical and narrative­ly sound. 
As funny and engaging as it is affect­ing, "Volver" is one of those rare serio­comedies that actually works. There are hints of tragedy, and its revelations are slowly introduced, which gives the film strong emotional undercurrents ­the audience never feels lost as Almodovar takes it through various plot twists and turns. 
"Volver" is not as brash as some of Almodovar's other films, and the direc­tor reeled in some of his more exces­sive tendencies, though he still has a penchant for odd camera angles and colorful compositions. The cinematog­raphy by Jose Luis Alcaine (who also worked with Almodovar on his previ­ous film, "La mala educacion" ["Bad Education"]), is gorgeous, especially in its elegant camera movement. Yet the film is clearly the brainchild of Almodovar, whose writing and direct­ing is in top form -his impeccable filmmaking sense really gives "Volver" a lot of character, which ultimately anchors it emotionally. 
The acting is across-the-board excel­lent, though it's Cruz who commands the picture. More at home with her native Spanish, the actress is absolute­ly brilliant here, doing the best work of her career as Raimunda, a character whose emotional depth ranges from shallow and funny to deep and heart-but it indicates that the director is reaching a zenith. His storytelling is in top form, and he balances all the story threads with aplomb and elegance. "Volver" was criminally overlooked upon its initial American release, but its reputation will surely grow as view­ers discover Almodovar's gem of a film.

felt -although, to be honest, her looks are a little distracting. It's hard to imagine Raimunda as part of the same gene pool that produced the frumpy Sole or the matronly Irene (though Almodovar winkingly acknowl­edges this throughout this film with various comments about Raimunda's cleavage). 
"Volver" may not be Almodovar's best work -it doesn't have the same visceral impact of "Hable con ella" ­

S(g§~~~~:' 

By MARTY SCHROEDER Assistant Scene Editor 
When George Lucas released the "Star Wars: Special Edition" films in the late 1990s, he promised that we could see these epic films "again, for the first time." A new generation was able to see perhaps the most famous trilogy in fllm history in theaters for the first time. Once more, for the first time, was enough. 
However, this was only the beginning of Lucas's OCD in regard to the films. With the plethora of DVD releases -each with their own new changes -and the upcoming 3-D theatrical releases, we'll be able to see them again, and again and again. When is enough enough? 
I recently purchased the original trilogy Limited Edition DVDs, which include not only the 2004 re-mastered transfers but also the original theatrical releases from 1977, 1980 and 1983 of"A New Hope," "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi" DVDs. When I first played the discs, I was confused. The original releases -the primary reason I waited to purchase these editions-are includ­ed in the Bonus Features of the second disc. The first disc, containing the ver­sion from the 2004 DVD "Star Wars" box set, is the one that has the "definitive·~ version of the film. I put "definitive" in quotation marks because on each of the three films, Lucas made all of the changes himself. This brings up some very important issues in regards to film authorship and what the roles of the director and the producer are after a film has been released. In other words, who "owns" the movie? 
In 1977, Lucas wrote and directed the first installment in the 'Star Wars" saga. Called "A New Hope," it quickly became one of the most popular films in history and spawned two sequels, three prequels and a host of books, toys and fanatic fans. No one, including myself, questions Lucas' claim to "A New Hope"-he both wrote and directed the screenplay. However, he did not direct either "The Empire Strikes Back" or "Return of the Jedi." Irvin Kershner and Richard Marquand can claim that credit on these films, respectively. Lucas didn't even write the two films that complete the

original trilogy. The credit he claims in regard to these films is that of the execu­tive producer. He fronted the money, and the basic story of the entire "Star Wars" narrative did come from his imagination. However, the creative force behind both "Empire" and "Jedi" came from different people. The story goes that Lucas showed up on and they are going to release a new "definitive" version that fits more in line with their vision of the film -completely disregarding the wishes of Scorsese? Granted, this is an extreme situation that isn't going to happen, and the situation with "Star Wars" is slightly different 
since Lucas is the imagi­
nation behind all of the

what he wanted -in creation of the "Star opposition to Lucas at the any part in? Wars" mythos and the 
time. Does Lucas then have the right to go back to these films and make changes to decisions that he never had any part in? 
The answer is a resounding no. Consider famed American director Martin Scorsese. What if, 30 years from now, the executive producers from "The Departed" decide that Leonardo DiCaprio's character isn't really needed, influence the creative and 
technical teams of these 
two films had on a gener­ation of moviegoers and their children. I am certainly one of those in our genera­tion that grew up with the "Star Wars" many of our parents loved dearly. 
I am not trying to argue the ownership issues that arise between the creator of art versus the audience that consumes it, for art is just another commodity at its most basic level. I am merely arguing that the creator of a work of art should be respected in our time. I may hire someone to paint a mountain. I may pick the mountain that is to be painted and pay for the painter's supplies. But unless I paint the mountain myself, I am not an artist; I cant put my name down in the corner of the finished result. So too with "Empire" and "Jedi." The end credits of "Empire" do not say "Directed by Irvin Kershner (and George Lucas too! ... but for only a few scenes which he thought were necessary to change, and other than that it's all Kershner)." 
And the release of the Limited Edition DVDs, with their 2004 and original ver­sions, is not the end of the battle. A the­atrical release of all six of the "Star Wars" films in 3-D is slated to begin this year. Lucas directed and wrote all three of the prequels and the first of the Original Trilogy. I have no problem with him doing whatever he wants to these films -even though I think showing films in 3-D is one of the worst decisions anyone could make. He has the creative control; the films are his. But to release "Empire" and "Jedi" in 3-D is taking these excellent films and pandering to a fad. Some may call me backwards, and I'm sure if 3-D becomes the standard, the voices crying foul will sound akin to those looking for blood when silent film became the talkie and when Dorothy walked into Oz and color took the reins from black and white. 
However, "Empire" is considered the best film in the "Star Wars" franchise and one of the fmest pieces of American cinema in the latter half of the 20th cen­tury. To take a respected American film and pander to the way a 1 0-year-old would want to watch movies is a gross foul in regard to cinema as an art form and any notion of authorship needed to protect credibility. 
I may be a dinosaur, but I'll be reveling in the un-mastered, stereo sound, non­anamorphic widescreen of the original trilogy. Lucas isn't giving us museum relics the filet -we get the scraps from the "master's" table. And I wouldn't have it any other way.

BRISTOL -As Jeff 
. Burton considered how to beat Kyle Busch in the clos­ing laps at Bristol Motor Speedway, he couldn't shake the lessons his moth­er taught him as a child. "My mother always told me to do onto other people the way you want them to do you," Burton remem­bered. "That's the only thing I know to do. I've always tried to let the guy I am racing with set the rules.... Kyle drives hard. He drives really hard. But he's always raced me with respect." And with that, Burton refused to bump Busch out 

of the way Sunday, instead pulling alongside of him before Busch beat him in a drag race to the fmish line to win the first Car of Tomorrow race. 
The two have battled in the Busch Series this sea­son, and had a stirring door-to-door duel in Las Vegas two weeks ago that Burton won as Busch spun backward across the fmish line. 
Burton credited Busch with racing clean that day, and both drivers had it fresh in their memories on the final three laps Sunday. 
"JeiT Burton easily could have dumped me there in three and four, but I think our Vegas finish helped me out a little bit with that," Busch said. "I think I had some brownie points to use up." 
Busch took the lead with 16 laps to go on a smooth pass around Denny Hamlin in thick traffic and stayed there through a pair of cau­tions. He had driven away from the competition when the 15th and final caution set up a three-lap overtime. 
With Busch and team­mate Jeff Gordon running 1-2 at the restart, the two plotted their own strategy with their respective crew chiefs. 
"Well, good job guys," Busch sighed at the final caution. "We'll do what we can. I can't promise you 
anything." "He'll be nice," crew chief . Alan Gustafson said. "He'll play nice." It didn't sound that way on Gordon's channel. 
"Tell that 5, if I get a 
fender underneath him, he 
better think about the fact 
that we're teammates," 
Gordon said. "If I don't get a 
fender underneath him. I 
won't move him out of the 
way." 
It never mattered, 
though, as Burton jumped 
past Gordon on the restart 
and quickly pulled onto 
Busch's rear bumper. 
Burton looked low and 
Busch threw a block, then 
he went high and Busch 
blocked that, too. 
IN BRIEF 

Donovan learns to be leader 
from marriage 

TAMPA -Newly-wed Landon Donovan thinks he finally under­stands what it takes to be a leader on the U.S. soccer team. 
"I got married this offseason and that's helped me grow up," the 25­year-old forward said Sunday after scoring three goals to lead the Americans over Ecuador 3-1 in an exhibition game Sunday. 
''I'm now embracing a leadership role. I used to say: 
Td love to be a leader. I want to be a leader.' But it's not good enough to say it. You have to show it." 
And that's exactly what Donovan did in his first game as U.S. captain since last May 28. Following an 18­game, 1 1/2-year scoreless streak in international play, he has five goals in three matches this year, helping the Americans to a 3-0 record. 
Pettersen benefits from 
Ochoa's mistakes in tourney 
SUPERSTITION MOUNTAIN ­Lorena Ochoa blew a four-stroke lead to Suzann Pettersen, then birdied four of the last five holes for a two-stroke victory in the Safeway International on Sunday. 
Ochoa shot a 4-under 68 to rally past Pettersen (66). 
Ochoa blew a four-shot lead in the final round for the second time in three years at Superstition Mountain Golf and Country Club. But this time she survived, overtak­ing Norway's Pettersen with birdies on the 14th, 15th, 17th and 18th holes. 
Ochoa, the tour's reigning player of the year, earned $225,000 for her 1Oth LPGA Tour victory. She finished at 18 under. 
The Mexican star opened the day with a four-stroke lead. But it dis­appeared as Pettersen then added another birdie on the seventh. 
Youngest Keller makes family 
proud 
MELBOURNE -The baby of the Keller family had bragging rights at the world swimming championships Sunday after big brother Klete sur­prisingly failed to qualify in the 400-meter freestyle. 
Kalyn Keller, the youngest of three swimming siblings, gave the 
U.S. its second medal of the meet, earning a silver in the grueling 25­km open water race off St. Kilda Beach. 
Back at Rod Laver Arena, Klete Keller fared much worse. 
He finished 10th, missing the final by 0.31 seconds in a swim about 5 seconds off his best time. 
"I don't know what the heck hap­pened," Keller said. "Maybe that's what's wro-ng. I didn't think about it enough." 
His sister's race finished 24 hours after it began in the treacherous waters of Port Phillip Bay.

WOMEN'S lACROSSE 

Laxers earn first 
conference victory 
By MICHAEL BRYAN Sporrs Writer 
No. 12 Notre Dame picked up its first Big East win of the season Sunday, defeating Loyola 11-1 in Baltimore. 
In giving up only one score, goalkeeper Erin Goodman and the Irish defense set a Notre Dame record for fewest goals allowed in a game. Goodman, a sophomore, recorded 14 saves on the game and allowed the only goal on a free-position shot in the second half. 
The Irish took a 7-0 lead over the Greyhounds heading into halftime, led offensively by junior Caitlin McKinney's three early goals. After Notre Dame picked up a Lena Zentgraf goal 55 seconds into the second half, Loyola finally got on the board with the free­
position  goal  from  Kate  
McHarg.  
Goodman  and  the  Notre  

Dame defense stifled the Greyhounds the rest of the game, however, and piled on three more second-half goals for the victory. 
The Irish offense was led by McKinney, who finished with four goals on the game. Sophomore Jillian Byers also contributed two goals and an assist, and the senior Zentgraf also turned in a strong per­formance with two goals and two assists. 

With the goals, Byers and McKinney went over the 30­goal mark on the season -the second year in a row both players have reached that mark. 
Both teams had 23 shots on goal for the game. Loyola goal­keeper Karen Nicolaus had six saves to Goodman's 14. 
Goodman, in her first season as starting goalkeeper, has elevated her play since giving up 18 goals to defending NCAA champion Northwestern March 1. Since that loss, the sophomore is 5-1 with an 8.33 goals against average and a .550 save percentage. 
With the win, Notre Dame improved to 7-2 overall, 1-1 in Big East play. Loyola fell to 1-6 and 0-2 in conference. 
The 1 0-goal margin of victo­ry tied for the largest Notre Dame win of the season. The Irish drubbed Canisius 18-8 in Buffalo earlier in the season. 
Looking ahead, the Irish play four of their last five regular season games at home before the inaugural Big East cham­pionship, beginning next weekend with games Friday against Connecticut and Sunday against Duquesne.

Saint Mary's outfielder Ashley Peterson throws the ball toward the infield during the Belles' 10-1 win over Rose-Hulman Sunday. 
By REBECCA SLINGER 
Sports Writer 
The slaughter rule may have ended the first game early, but it didn't end the Belles' slaughter of Rose-IIulman Sunday afternoon. 
The Belles took the first game 10-1 in five innings and the second 5-0, improving their. record to 11-1 -2-0 at home -and dropping the Engineers to 7-9. 
"[Rose-Hulman] played pret­ty much as expected," Belles coach Erin Sullivan said. "They hit the ball well, made some good adjustments, good improvements throughout the game. The pitchers were great as always." 
Sophomore Calli Davison pitched the first game, shut­ting down the Engineers' best hitters and allowing just one run. 
In an action-packed third inning, the Belles broke the game open with six hits and five homers, including a grand slam by sophomore catcher Ashley Fusaro. 
After the offensive outburst. the Belles closed out the game quickly with the mercy rule. In Rose-Hulman 's last chance to keep the game going, Davison got an out on a pop-up to freshman second baseman Mo Healy and struck out the next two hitters to end the game. 
In the second contest of the doubleheader, Kristen Amram blew away the Engineer hit­ters, giving up no runs on three hits and lowering her ERA from an already minis­cule 0.44 to 0.33. 
Shortstop Sarah Miesle drove in four of Saint Mary's five runs on a grand slam in the bottom of the first inning. 
"She did an all-around amazing job," Sullivan said of Miesle. "She just hit the ball great." 
Miesle was more humble. 
"I just played like I normally play," Miesle said. "I try and play hard every pitch. I just happened to have a good day today." 
Last season, Saint Mary's ·set a school record with 28 wins and was 9-3 after 12 games. This year, the team is already two games ahead of that pace. 
The Belles will travel this weekend to face Alma College at 2 p.m. Saturday and Manchester at 1 p.m. Sunday.

Irish athletes post 19 Big East qualifying marks 
By BILL BRINK Sports Wrirer. 

Notre Dame posted Mideast regional qualifying times in seven events this weekend at the Arizona State Clif Bar Invitational in Tempe, Ariz. 
In addition, the team posted 19 Big East championship qualifying marks in both the relay events and the individ­ual races. 
-
Leading the Irish was senior Maryann Erigha, who quali­fied for the regional in three events. Erigha won the 200­meter dash with a time of 
23.91 seconds and qualified in the event for the fourth year in a row. 
She also ran in the 4x100 meter relay with senior Okechi Oqbuokiri, freshman Joanna Schultz and junior Domenique Manning. The team won the race with a time of 45.46 seconds. Finally, she ran the anchor leg of the 4x400 meter relay along with Oqbuokiri, Schultz and senior Crysta Swayzer. The team fin­ished fourth in 3:41.12. 
Freshmen Balazs Molnar had a strong meet, finishing fourth in the 400-meter hur­dles with a time of 52.36 sec­onds. That mark gave Molnar the third-fastest time in

Belles rained out, retnain 5-4 on season 
By ELLYN MICHALAK Sporrs Writer 

Still 5-4 on the season, Saint Mary's was unable to add another win to its record this weekend due to unfortunate weather circumstances. 
The Belles' match Saturday against Indiana Wesleyan University was cancelled because of forecasted rain and a lack of indoor tennis courts. 
Today, the Belles will hit the road again to face a tough conference opponent -the Knights of Calvin College. 
Last year. the Belles lost 8-1 to Calvin. 
Despite last year's defeat, Belles' coach Dee Stevenson still has faith in his team, which is currently 1-0 in the MIAA conference. 
"Calvin College is not as strong this year," Stevenson said, "And we are a bit stronger than we were last year. It should definitely be an interesting match." 
The Belles' regular lineup will be ready to take on Calvin College with senior captain Kelly McDavitt playing num­ber-one singles and standout freshman Camille Gebert tak­ing the number-two spot. Together the duo will also compete in the number-one doubles spot. 
The match will take place today in Grand Hapids, Mich., at 3 p.m.

Tiger wins his last event before Masters 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -They can move this World Golf Championship around country and continents, change its name and stick it in a different spot on the calendar. Tiger Woods still seems to wind up with the trophy. 
Woods made sure the out­come was never in doubt Sunday, making enough key putts to keep everyone at a dis­tance and playing it safe at the end for a l-over 73 to capture the CA Championship by two shots over Brett Wetterich in his final tournament before the Masters. 
"Very pleased," Woods said about his game heading into the first major. 
He is believed to be the first player to win a PGA Tour event six times on six courses. Woods also won this tournament, pre­viously known as the American Express Championship, in Spain, Ireland, Atlanta, San Francisco and London. And it was his third straight victory at Dora!. 
"He's good on Bermuda, good in wind, good in no wind, he's good on bent grass. He's just a good player," U.S. Open cham­pion Geoff Ogilvy said. "What do you say?" 
Woods never let anyone clos­er to him than four shots for most of the warm, blustery afternoon on the Blue Monster until Wetterich made birdie on the 16th to get within three. Equipped with that margin, Woods played iron off the tee on the tough 18th, laid up, and hit a wedge 50 feet beyond the flag. He lapped to tap-in range for bogey. 
Wetterich had an 8-foot birdie putt to make it interesting, but left it short and settled for a 71. 
Woods finished at 10-under 278 to continue his dominance in these World Golf Championships. It was his 13th title in 24 tries, and he is 11-of­16 when the tournaments are stroke play. 
school history. 
The meet was Molnar's first of the year since the 400­meter hurdles is not run dur­ing the indoor season. Molnar also ran in the 4x400 meter relay with senior Hyan Postel, senior Jordan Powell and jun­ior Austin Wechter. The team ran the second-fastest time in school history, finishing in 3:09.38, and finished in sec­ond place. 
Postel, in addition to the relay, won the 400-meter dash outright in 47.20 seconds. He has qualified for the Mideast regionals in the 400-meter dash in three of' the last four years. 
Junior hammer thrower Kyle Annen posted a throw of 
57.36 meters, setting the eighth-highest mark in school history and qualifying in the event for the third year in a row. 
Erigha also won the 100­meter dash with a time of 
11.77 seconds. That put her two-hundreths of' a second away from a fourth regional qualifying time. Schultz and Oqbuokiri finished second and third, respectively, behind Erigha in the 200 meter dash. Schultz had a time of' 24.51 seconds; Oqbuokiri crossed the line in 24.60 seconds. 
Senior Christopher Jacques 
placed third in the long jump, leaping 7.00 meters. Sophomore Lauren Biscardi and senior Cassie Gullickson both finished in the top five in the high jump. Biscardi placed second, clearing 1. 70 meters, and Gullickson cleared 1.65 meters to finish fifth. She also placed fifth in the triple jump, finishing with a distance of 
11.63 meters. 

The Irish also had a top-five finisher in the men's high 
jump.  Sophomore  Blair  
Majcina cleared 2.05  meters  
and finished third.

Notre Dame scored two more in the sixth inning, but the early offensive production was more than enough for Bargar to claim another vic­tory. 
Notre Dame 3, St. John's 0 
The second game of the doubleheader featured less offense than the first and turned into a pitcher's duel. After freshman Heather Johnson started the fourth inning with a single, a series of pinch running and small ball ensued, including a sac­rifice bunt. It lead to an RBI sacrifice fly from Lux, giving Notre Dame a one-run lead. 
The fifth inning saw sopho­more Linda Kohan hit a sacri­fice fly to bring senior Stephanie Brown home.

first two batters. but after a walk and a single, Seton Hall was on the board. 
For the second time in the game, Laing started a rally with a double, breaking the tie in the bottom of the fourth with a two-out HBI single from Lux. Although the Irish threatened to score another insurance run in the sixth, Bargar had enough support to close out the game, improving to 9-7 on the sea­son. 
Notre Dame 9, Seton Hall 1 
The Irish bats came out strong again on the way to a 9-1 win, sealing the sweep on the day and their fifth win in a row. Fuemmeler improved to 5-5 on the season with her complete-game four-hit gem. After Kohan got on base with a hit, a wild pitch advanced her, before she scored on a double from Johnson. 
Seton Hall quickly tied the game up in the second, mak­ing things interesting. The stalemate, however, did not last when Notre Dame made yet another two-out rally in the third inning -this time for three runs. The Irish then dropped a four-spot in the fourth frame, but in the end, it was Irish pitching and con­sistency from the plate that gave Notre Dame the edge.

ND beats Boilers, keeps streak alive 
ByJAYWADE Sports Writer 
No. 5 Notre Dame, enjoying its highest rank since 2002, fol­lowed its victory at the Blue Gray Classic March 18 with a resounding 7-0 win Sunday against Purdue. 
The Irish extended their win­ning streak to 10 matches and improved their overall record to 16-2 while Purdue fell to 8-5, 1­2 in the Big Ten. 
Notre Dame's streak is its longest since the 1989-90 team won 15 consecutive games. 
"I think the rankings indicated that we were a heavy favorite, but that does not always play out. ... I was happy with how we took care of all the things we needed ·to in a professional man­ner," Notre Dame coach Bobby Bayliss said. 
The Irish had to adjust to new conditions while playing in West Lafayette. After a recent outdoor tournament, the team was forced to readjust to an indoor setting because Purdue's new outdoor courts are not yet fin­ished. 
Also, senior Irish standout No. 8 Stephen Bass -who has won nine of his last 10 matches ­had to play freshman Branko Kuzmanovic, who he was not prepared to face. Bass adjusted well to his unknown opponent, defeating Kuzmanovic 6-2, 6-2. The Irish senior now has a record of 26-8. 
"Bass did a good job of attack­ing his second serve, which was the key to winning that match," Bayliss said. 
Like Bass, the rest of the Irish made short work of their oppo­nents, with only junior Sheeva Parbhu dropping a set before his 6-3, 4-6, 10-4 victory. The win put Parbhu's overall record at 23-9. 
"Sheeva let the second set go from him, but he came back and played a very good match," Bayliss said. 
In singles play, Brett Helgeson defeated Eric Hodgman 6-1, 6-4, Barry King defeated Kurt Zaske 6-4, 6-2, Andrew Hoth defeated Scott Warner 6-1, 6-2, and Hyan Keckley defeated Paul Foley 6-1, 6-2. 
Keckley, who clinched the vic­tory for Notre Dame, got his 60th career win. 
Bayliss was particularly impressed with both King's and Helgeson's victories. 
"They both beat strong players with their physical and aggres­sive ground strokes," he said. 
In doubles, Keckley and Parbhu defeated Kuzmanovic and Rose 8-6, King and Helgeson defeated Hodgman and Zaske 8­2, and Bass and Hoth defeated Foley and Griffin Neinberg 8-5. The victory for seventh-ranked Keckley and Parbhu put their record at 21-10, 7-9 in dual action. 
Overall. it was a dominant vic­tory for the Irish. 
"Once we got a couple on the board quickly, it put a lot of pressure on the Purdue boys," Bayliss said. 
The Irish play again Wednesday at Michigan State.

Belles improve scores in Kentucky tourney 
By BILL BRINK Sports Writer 
. Junior Katie O'Brien posted a team-low, two-day total of 167 to lead Saint Mary's to a 20th-place fin­ish in the Northern Kentucky Invitational over the weekend. 
O'Brien shot an 83 in the first round and an 84 in the second dur­ing this weekend's tournament. 
"[She] played well both rounds. She struck the ball very well," Belles coach Mark Hamilton said. "She struggled somewhat in putting, but still managed to shoot good scores." 
Sophomore Meredith Fantam shot a 91 in her first round and an 87 in her second, totaling 178. Sophomore Meaghan Fontein shot a 110 during her frrst round, but significantly low­ered her score, posting a 91 in her second round, to finish at 201. 
"[She] improved twenty strokes over her first score, so she really played well for us today," Hamilton said. 
The team was more comfortable after having played their first tour­nament of the year, and it showed. O'Brien beat her previous score by 24 strokes and Fantam lowered hers by 19. 
"Everybody was a little more relaxed," Hamilton said. "We just played slightly closer to our poten­tial." 
As drastic as the improvements were, however, there are still kinks to be worknd out. 
"We still struggled on the greens this week, so we're still looking for an answer for that," he said . 
Hamilton said the field of 22 teams was stronger than the compe­tition faced during the previous tour­nament. He also said that the course was very conducive to lownr scores and expressed relief the weather had improved since the team's last tournament. 
"The conditions were benign, the weather was perfect," he said. 'There was almost no wind." 
The dip in scores was partially indicative of fme-tuning. but also had to do with the experience of playing in a tournament the week before, Hamilton said. 
"We made some adjustments as far as strategy, as far as understand­ing how to play the course a little bit better," he said. "After having a tournamnnt under your belt, you're a little more relaxed when you go out and play. We kind of lost our deer-in-the-headlights look a little bit from our first tournament of the year and played closer to our poten­tial." 
Perri 1-iamma and Theresa Tonyan rounded out Saint Mary's competitors at the Invitational. Hamma shot 93 and 101 to total 194 and Tonyan shot 114 and 110 to post a score of224.

Bulls 
continued from page 24 
Big East opener. 
Phelps scattered three hits, struck out 10 and allowed just six Bulls base rurmers to earn the win and improve his record to 4-1. 
"David pitched exactly how we scripted it and bit his spots," Irish head coach Dave Schrage said. 
The outing was Phelps' first career complete game. 
"It's a little surreal," he said. 

South Florida starter Danny Otero gave up just one run on seven hits in seven and two-thirds innings, but took the loss and fell to 4-4. 
The Irish threatened in the first, putting shortstop Brett lilley on third and third baseman A. J. Pollock on first with nobody out, but centerfielder Danny Dressman hit a tailor-made double-play ball to third. After the Bulls got the out at second, second baseman Dexter Butler threw the ball home, catching lilley for the sec­ond out of the inning. 
Dressman, thinking the inning was over, jogged ofT first base and was tagged out to retire the side. 
The next inning, Notre Dame didn't bother with base running, as first baseman Mike Dury blast­ed his fifth home run of the season over the right field fence to give the Irish a 1-0 lead. 
South Florida threatened to the tie the game in the ninth, getting a single from shortstop Walter Diaz to open the inning. After a strike­out, a blooper by third baseman Addison Maruszak would have scored Diaz, but the ball landed just foul. 
"We were playing at home," Schrage said. "It was the luck of the Irish." 
Instead, Phelps struck out Maruszak and Butler looking to end the game. Notre Dame's last 1-0 win came against BYU with 
J.P. Gagne on the hill in 2002. 
South Aorida 13, Notre Dame 10 
South Florida capitalized off Notre Dame's mistakes Saturday, and there were a lot of them. 
The Irish gave up eight walks, two hit batsmen, four passed balls and three errors in their 13-10 loss to the Bulls. 
Notre Dame's starting pitcher, junior left-bander Wade Korpi, left the mound in the top of the sixth with a 5-2 lead and two runners on base. Two Irish pitchers would come to the mound -junior Joey Williamson and senior Jess Stewart -and allow a combined five runs off four hits in the rest of the sixth inning. 
"The bullpen has done a good job all year," Schrage said. "[Stewart and Williamson] have been solid for us all season and today they weren't. I would do that again and those guys have pitched well for us all year, and we thought they'd come in a do a good job, but they didn't." 
Notre Dame took the 5-2 lead in the bottom of the second. Jeremy Barnes started off a four-run burst for the Irish with an HBI down the third-base line. 

The Bulls shut out the Irish in the bottom of the sixth before tak­ing to their bats again. Stewart allowed two more runs in the sev­enth before Notre Dame brought in freshman left-bander David Mills from the bullpen. Mills walked the only three batters he faced, allowing two runs to score before junior right-hander Tony Langford took the mound. Langford allowed one more run to close out the inning. 
Langford gave the Irish a fight­ing chance when he allowed no runs in the top of the eighth. With a 13-6 deficit, Notre Dame scored four in the bottom of the eighth. 
The Bulls brought in freshman right-hander Shawn Sanford to close out the rest of the inning. Sanford allowed one run off an error before finishing the inning. Those four runs would be the end of the offensive charge for the Irish. Both Southern Florida and Notre Dame posted scoreless ninths to leave the final score at 13-10. 
Notre Dame struggled defen­sively the entire game and despite making strong drives in the sec­ond and eighth, it was not able to rally. 
"It's tough to shut any team down when you give them that many free bases," Schrage said. "I was proud of how our kids bounced back with the bats and kept battling, but we just gave up way too many runs." 
South Aorida 9, Notre Dame 1 
Notre Dame left 14 runners on base and fell 9-1 to South Florida Sunday. 
The Irish banged out 13 hits, but only mustered one run. In contrast, South florida needed just nine hits to knock in its nine runs. 
Notre Dame got a hit in every inning and put at least two run­ners on base from the third through the eighth frames, but couldn't drive any of them in. The only Irish run came on a lead-ofT home run by shortstop Brett Lilley in the first. 
"It was one of the most frustrat­ing games I've experienced," Schrage said. "People were get­ting hits with no one on base, but then they'd come up with a chance to knock some in, and they wouldn't do it." 
The best chance to score for the Irish came in the third, when Lilley and Pollock got back-to­hack hits. With two outs, a line drive by Dury seemed about to score them, but Maruszak leaped to his left and made a diving mteh to retire the side. 
The Bulls put two runs on the board in the first without getting a hit. Shorl<;top Walter Diaz walknd, advanced to second on an error by Pollock, took third on a sacri­fice by leftfielder Ty Tabomlli and scored on a wild pitch. Maruszak, who reached on the error, seornd one batter later on a ground out to third by Butler. 
Notre Dame responded in the bottom of the inning with Lilley's home run, but would not score again. 
After five scoreless innings, the Bulls got four more runs in the top of the eighth, loading the bases with one out and scoring when Notre Dame reliever Kyle Weiland walked Butler to force in a run and another run on a sacrifice fly by first baseman Brandin Daniel.

Irish pitcher Wade Korpi delivers a pitch in Notre Dame's 13-10 loss Saturday to South Florida at Frank Eck Stadium. 
The next batter, designated hitter Nick Cardieri, knocked in two more with a double. 
South Florida seornd three more in the ninth, with Maruszak knoeking in right fielder Josh LeHoy, Taborelli seoring Diaz with a sacrifice fly, and Butler getting an HBI single to drive in Maruszak. 
All in all, the Notre Dame bullpen of Weiland, sophomore Brett Graffy and freshman Eric Maust allowed seven runs on live hits in four innings relieving Kapala. 
"Every time we made a move to the bullpen, nobody did the job," Schrage said. "That's frustrating because that was one ol' our strengths coming into this week­end." 
Bulls junior Chris Delaney allowed just one run in 6.1 innings to earn the win and improve to 5­0 this season. Freshman Shawn Sanford recorded his fifth save of the season. Kapala took the loss to fall to 0-2.

ry, finishing second to Harvard's Timothy Hagaman by a single touch. It marked the third straight season that Ghattas lost in the championship bout, a fact that the captain said eats at him. 
"It's hard," Ghattas said. "It's like the same feeling three years in a row." 
Still, Ghattas contributed a point to the team score with each of his 18 victories in pool play. He and sophomore Bill Thanhouser, whose 17 wins tied him for fourth most, accounted for 35 of Notre Dame's 160 points. 
"It's nice to see [Thanhouser l fencing so well," Ghattas said. "We were solid.... We did our job." 
But Thanhouser's perform­ance was only the second-best among the team's sophomores. Classmate Nott captured third place with a 9-8 win in sudden death over Penn State's Tamara Najm. Nott finished sixth in 2006. 
Nott, whose hometown coach was friends with first-year Irish assistant Gia Kvaratskhelia, said Kvaratskhelia's instruction on her footwork was especially important this season. 
"I just hope I have two more chances to do this," Nott said. 
If Nott does reach the national competition again, it likely will be with Hurley, who took sec­ond in women's epee. The freshman earned 18 pool victo­ries before beating Reka Szele of St. John's to advance to the finals. 
There, she traded touches in a fast-paced first period with Wayne State's Anna Garina, a 30-year-old southpaw senior from Kiev, Ukraine. Garina took a quick 2-0 lead, but Hurley battled back to tie the score at 6-6. After Garina took the next touch, the two traded two dou­ble-touches and two single scores to end the period with Garina up fl-10. The senior claimed a 13-11 lead early in second, but the San Antonio product tied the score at 13-13. But that was as close as Hurley got, and Garina took the bout 15-13. 
After the bout, Hurley said she was upset with missed opportunities that could have put away the three-time nation­al champion. 
"Maybe in a little while I can look at it as a positive, but right now I'm just so angry I missed those chances," Hurley said. 
On the other end of the spec­trum, Providenza's career ended in frustrating style. 
With her semifinal bout knot­ted at 14-14, Providenza deflected an advance by Columbia's Daria Schneider and hit Schneider's lamee. But Providenza didn't score the touch because of new timing 
· rules. Schneider counterat­tacked to beat the senior and overcame Penn State's Caitlin Thompson in a thrilling final for the individual crown. Still visibly upset with the semifinal loss, Providenza tried

to battle back after falling behind 8-3 in the third-place bout but fell short with a 15-13 defeat at the hands of Columbia's Emily Jacobson. 
In men's epee, junior Greg Howard earned eighth place with a 13-10 record in his first competition at the NCAAs. Sophomore teammate Karol Kostka finished three spots behind Howard with 12 wins. 
Howard, who came to the NCAAs as a spectator last sea­son, said he was less nervous competing than he was watch­ing because he "had some con­trol" this time. That, combined with his laid-back personality, produced a relaxed attitude that propelled him to several key wins, including a 5-2 victo­ry over fourth-place finisher Dwight Smith of Columbia. 
"I feel like I got a lot better this year," Howard said. "I defi­nitely became a little bit more focused." 
In men's foil, Notre Dame sophomore Mark Kubik took seventh with 13 wins, and Irish junior Jakub Jedrkowiak fin­ished ninth with 12 victories. 
On the women's side of the foil, Notre Dame sophomore Emilie Prot went 6-3 Sunday after posting a 5-9 record in Saturday's first four rounds. 
Irish sophomore and Orange, 
N.J. native Ashley Serrette fin­ished 9-14 in the women's sabre competition but was only minus-10 in total touches. 
In all, Irish non-seniors earned 77 percent of the squad's points. 
"We should be glad they fenced well," Bednarski said. "They showed fury. They showed ambition." 
Notes: 
+ With Garina's win against Hurley for the women's epee crown, the Ukraine native earned her third title with a championship victory over a Notre Dame fencer. Garina topped then-sophomore Amy Orlando 15-6 in 2005 and for­mer Irish national champion Kerry Walton for the crown in 2004.

a 2-0 hole against the No. 1 team in the country and proceeded to deny the Irish for over 90 minutes before finally surrendering a goal. N arduzzi stood on his head for the Chargers, making 49 saves before freshman Ryan Thang finally found a chink in the armor for a 3-2 double overtime win­more than four hours after the opening faceoff. 
Notre Dame avoided the monu­mental upset, but the victory was a Pyrrhic one. The Irish had less than 24 hours to recover physical­ly and mentally from the marathon matchup, and it was clear they were a step slower than Michigan State during their 2-1 loss in Saturday's regional championship game. 

The lack of steam was most evi­dent during the second period when Michigan State goalie Jeff Lerg faced only three shots and the Spartans got off nine, includ­ing a Chris Mueller put-back that gave them their first lead of the game. 
The Spartans frustrated the exhausted Notre Dame team by feeding it a dose of its own medi­cine. A pestering forecheck, a solid team defense and an impen­etrable penalty-kill unit kept Notre Dame from even sniffing a scoring chance on its five power plays. All season Notre Dame has controlled the puck from start to finish, but Saturday Michigan State won the faceoffbattle (45­
36) and seemed to control the pace for much of the contest. 
In order to keep up with their opponents, the Irish were forced to take a lot of penalties. 
"I think that is where a little bit oflast night showed up," Irish coach Jeff Jackson said after Saturday's game. "They weren't discipline penalties -they were a little bit a-step-behind penalties." 
The team was whistled for 1 0 penalties on the night. Two of those led to Michigan State's goals, and another took away an Irish goal that would have tied the game at two apiece with less than three minutes left. 
Sophomore left wing Garrett Hegan was called for goaltender interference when he crashed the net hard and collided with Lerg in the crease. The Irish put the loose puck in the net, but referee PetHr Feolay waved off the goal due to the contact. 

Irish junior right wing Evan Rankin struggles with an Alabama-Huntsville defender in Notre Dame's 3-2 double overtime victory Friday 
"I felt that he was funneled in to net. Tbe goalie was still eligible to play the puck after the initial con­tact," said junior linemate Evan Rankin. "I thought it was a very questionable call," 
It seems a bit cliche to dwell on officiating after the final loss of a season, but the crucial call could have gone either way down the stretch. 
The call extinguished the last bit of spark the Irish had in them and all but ended what was arguably the greatest season in the history of Notre Dame hockey. 
The team and its fans were clearly disappointed to fall short of reaching the Frozen Four in St. Louis, but the humongous strides taken this season will go a long way toward reaching what Jackson has referred to as "the ultinmte prize"-a national championship.

Irish finish fourth at NCAA Championships 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Writer 
MADISON, N.J. -It just was­n't Notre Dame's year. 
But this weekend's NCAA Championships at Drew University might be a sign of better things to come for the Irish. 
Notre Dame finished fourth in the team competition to con­clude a season that included a surgery and lengthy absence for head coach Janusz Bednarski, the hiring of a new assistant coach for the foilists and the

Jeers fall to Spartans in NCAA Midwest regional final, 2-1 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 
-
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -Irish coach Jeff Jackson sat alone at the post-game press conference table minutes after Notre Dame fell 2-1 to Michigan State in a loss that put a premature period to the end of a season no one expected, and after it was over, no one wanted to see end. 
Jackson looked at the empty seal'> to his left where his players usually sat and told those assem­bled in Grand Rapids for No. 1 Notre Dame's second NCAA Tournament appearance Saturday that none would be leaving the locker room anytime

departure of Olympic gold medalist Mariel Zagunis. 
The Irish beat regional rival Ohio State but fell short of St. John's, Columbia and champion Penn State. Notre Dame also finished fourth last year. 
Still, four Irish fencers gar­nered first-team All-American status with top-four showings -freshman epeeist Kelley Hurley, sophomore foilist Adi Nott and senior sabreists Patrick Ghattas and Valerie Providenza. 
In all, nine of Notre Dame's 11 qualifiers earned at least honorable mention All-American status with top-12 finishes in their weapon, and seven of those nine will return to the squad next season. 

"Happy -we are not. We always want more," Bednarski said as the Championships closed inside the Simon Forum and Athletic Center. "(But! I am very proud of the kids, who kept going. We have new fencers who are showing good skill." 
Ghattas became the 25th three-time first-team All­American in Notre Dame histo­

Bulls take conference series 
By CHRIS KHOREY and DEIRDRE KRASULA Sports Writers 
Notre Dame dropped two of three games to South Florida over the weekend at Frank Eck Stadium in its opening Big East series. 
The games were the first out­side of Florida for the Bulls (18-8, 4-2 Big East), who looked eold in a 1-0 loss in the rain Friday, but heated up once the weather got warmer to earn a 13-10 win Saturday and a 9-1 decision Sunday over the Irish (11-11, 1­2).

By LORENZO REYES Sports Writer 
Notre Dame started Big East play with a perfect record after a doubleheader sweep Saturday of St. John's and another twin-killing, this time Sunday over Seton Hall. 
The Irish were carried by hot hit­ting, most notably from freshman Christine Lux, who had three hits and four RBis over the weekend. 
Notre Dame pitchers threw two shutouts -the first two of the season. Sophomore Brittney Bargar allowed only two hits with eight strikeouts for an 8-0 victory in the first game. Senior Kenya Fuemmeler also pitched a complete-game gem, conced­ing four hits and striking out seven. 

Notre Dame 8, St. John's 0 

The third inning saw Notre Dame make a three-run rally with two retired already in the frame. Junior Katie Laing pro­duced some offense with a two-run double. After advanc­ing to third base on an attempted throw home, Laing crossed the plate on a single to right field by Lux. 
The Irish also exploded with a three-run fifth inning. After Lux was credited with an RBI
