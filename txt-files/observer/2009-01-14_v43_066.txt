Balkan crisis leaves MBA students cold 
Classmates on trip to Bosnia for business course face low temps as natural gas is cut off 
By AARON STEINER Assistant News Editor 
Keith Flatley said it was a cold couple of days he and five other Notre Dame MBA students spend in Bosnia at the beginning of the month, as much of eastern Europe was affected by a cutoff of natural gas from Russia that began on Jan. 1. 
The MBA students-travel­ing to Bosnia for a course called "Business on the Frontlines" -arrived in the country on Jan. 2. Shortly after their arrival, they were among the thousands affected by the gas cutoff. The Associated Press reported that tens of thousands of homes and buildings have been left without heat in freezing weather since the disruption. 
The cutoff stems from a dis­pute over pricing agreements between Ukraine and Gazprom, Russia's state-run monopoly that supplies natu­ral gas to Ukraine and much of Europe. 
As temperatures plunged to 
6.8 degrees Fahrenheit in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, Flatley said that students braced for the cold nights without heat. 
"It was about 10 below Celsius," Flatley said. "We just did what we could." 
While in the country, the students stayed in an apart­ment, which is heated by nat­ural gas. Flatley said the group had an electric oven which they tried to use for heat, as well as a heat lamp in the bathroom. 
Other than that, the stu­
dents bundled up on the cold nights, he said, and found as much heat during the day as possible. 
"We'd be out all day, doing our work, [and] some of the buildings had heat," he said. But the majority of businesses didn't have heating. 
"We found a couple places of heat," he said. 
The AP reported that sales of electric heaters soared, something Flatley confirmed in an e-mail from Jan. 7. 
"There are lines forming at stores selling electric heaters. The price of an electric heater on Monday was under $100 U.S.; it is now over $200," he wrote in the e-mail. "The heaters sell out within minutes of the stores open­ing." 
The infrastructure in Bosnia varies, Flatley said, 

but natural gas heating is common, with much of it con­structed since the Bosnian conflicts that left the country in shambles. 
"When [Sarajevo] was rebuilt, because the electric grid was kind of shoddy, they basically redid the city with natural gas," he said. In some cities, where natural gas is less common, there is a mix of firewood and electric heat­ing systems, he said. 
Flatley said the mood in the country wasn't too negative. 
"They're tough people," he said of Bosnians, noting they've endured far worse during years of bombings and conflict in the region. 
"I think it was more an issue for us than for the peo­ple there," he said.

Saint Mary's installs signpost 
New campus landmark points, shows distance to study abroad locations 
By LIZ HARTER Saint Mary's Editor 
Saint Mary's students exiting the east doors of the Student Center and Spes Unica Hall may have noticed two new signposts near both buildings. 
While one might expect the signs to point visitors towards other buildings on campus, they actually point towards the eight countries in which Saint Mary's has study abroad programs. The signs also show how far away 
the locations are from the College. 
The signposts were purchased by the Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership (CWIL) with funds from the Lilly grant, said Elaine Meyer-Lee, CWIL director. 
"[The signs] are a visual reminder of the College's many opportunities to study abroad," Meyer-Lee said. 
Those opportunities include semester and full year programs in Maynooth, Ireland; Dijon, France; Innsbruck, Austria; Seviller Spain; Rome, Italy; and Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, as well as summer programs in Seoul, South Korea and Beijing, China, all of which are included on the signs. 
.The College also offers a semester or full year in Fremantle, Australia; Mumbai, India; Cordoba, Argentina and a women's studies semester in Europe. There are also summer programs in Ecuador, Honduras and Greece, and semester break

Parking lot restrictions spur student discontent 
By SARAH GUNN News Writer 

Saint Mary's students who commute to campus returned from break to find they will have a longer walk from the parking lots to the main parts of campus. 
The Science Hall parking lot, on the northeast side of campus, has been restricted to students and is only open to faculty and staff. 
Students may park in the 
parking lot on weekends and on weekdays after 5:30 p.m., but many students expressed frustration with the new restrictions. 
Senior Kristen Edelen, said the new restrictions are "ridiculous." Since returning from break she has had two warnings and one parking ticket. The two warnings were a result of being "improperly parked" in the newly restrict­ed science lot. Edelen said the

hours on Christmas Eve, I was nearly a 
sports reporter. 

And although the Notre Dame Fighting Irish defeated the University of Hawaii Warriors 49-21 in the last game I will ever see as an undergraduate, I did not cheer, clap or shout while I was in the Aloha Stadium press box. 
I may have smiled. 

Prior to Christmas Eve, the closest I'd ever come to covering a sporting event was writing a story about the new water ski club. 
But The Observer sent me to Hawaii for the Sheridan Bowl to write an article about students who attended the game and I found myself sitting a few seats down from the stadium announcer and within viewing distance of Charlie Weis in the Notre Dame coaches' box. 
My family sent me text messages asking me to take a picture of Charlie with my phone. I refrained, even though No 
Taking Pictures with a Camera Phone in 
the Press Box is a book that has not yet 
been written. 

We arrived at the stadium just moments before kickoff, due to a faulty GPS system that, at one point in the trip, directed one of my colleagues onto a military base. 
When we walked into the press box, everyone else was already seated, notepads and computers at the ready. 
My two Observer colleagues, both vet­eran Notre Dame football reporters, took their designated seats at the front of the press box. I was given a seat in the sec­ond row, right behind them. They took out their laptops and opened up their Word documents and Excel spreadsheets and began entering drive yardage and pass completion data. 
The reporter sitting next to me, whose name setting indicated he worked for a local Hawaiian paper, had his laptop open. He had already written the lede of his story, leaving blanks for the final score. 
After every drive, he made notations in his notebook to track the progress of the game. 
Up and down the rows, the men of the bowl game press corps were quietly watching and recording. 
And there I was, sitting among them, just watching. I took out a notebook so I would be less conspicuous and started writing down some questions I'd ask of fans later. 
That took about five minutes. 
But I couldn't just sit there and watch while everyone else was obviously work­ing. I'm sure no one was assuming I had an extraordinary game play memory. 
I made a note each time Notre Dame scored. And again when Hawaii scored. I made a note about the Hawaiian shirts the coaches and managers were wearing. 
It wasn't great sports reporting, but at least I dido 't cheer.

'American Idol' sues 'Stripper Idol' 
AUSTIN -"American Idol" wants an Austin strip club to take it off. The company that owns the popular television show sued in federal court to stop the weekly "Stripper Idol"contest at Palazio Men's Club. FremantleMedia North America also wants to seize Palazio's profits from the amateur stripping contest. 
In its lawsuit against Palazio, FremantleMedia calls "Stripper Idol" a trademark violation that could mislead the public to think the TV show sponsors the event, The Dallas Morning News reported in Tuesday edi­tions. 
Advertisements for the stripping contest use a logo with a "color scheme, design and font"similar to the TV show's. Waitresses at the club also wear T­shirts emblazoned with the logo, according to the lawsuit.

encouraging students to inves­tigate the darker moments of rivalry and even persecution that mark the pages of history to those invigorating engage­ments between scholars of our two communities." 
A member of the faculty since 1992, Signer, an international scholar, was a professor of Jewish history at Hebrew Union Co liege-Jewish Institute of Religion in Los Angeles from 1974 to 1991. 
Specializing in the fields of Judaism and medieval exegesis, Signer was interested in the multiple relationships between Judaism and Christianity. 
Signer once said he cherished his years at Notre Dame because they offered him "the opportunity to engage in the day-to-day lives of Christian colleagues and students as they wrestle with what it means to live their tradition in the mod­ern world. Their struggle to discover how their faith can guide them as they negotiate a path to discover meaning in the pluralistic society that sur­rounds them without surren­dering a distinctive religious identity awakens many echoes of the Jewish tradition which has in the past and continues to chart its course between assim­ilation and resistance to con­temporary culture." 
"We are saddened at the loss of our dear colleague Michael Signer," said John Cavadini, chair of Theology at Notre Dame. "His leading work in Christian-Jewish dialogue and his scholarship in medieval bib­lical exegesis made him a beloved teacher and scholar whose loss will be keenly felt not only by his colleagues and students in our theology department, but by the theolog­ical community worldwide." 
Signer graduated from the University of California Los Angeles in 1966. He earned a master's degree from Hebrew Union College in 1970, the same year as his rabbinical ordination. 
As a doctoral student at the University of Toronto, Signer became interested in interreli­gious affairs. While in Los Angeles, he taught Bible cours­es to Catholic seminarians, par­ticipated in dialogues between Catholic priests and rabbis and

Frost watched the game from the front row of Aloha Stadium, directly behind the Notre Dame team.

Cold weather in the Midwest almost prevented Notre Dame senior Brandon Frost, who was born and raised in Hawaii, from returning home in time for the game.

"There were more people cheering for Notre Dame than I expected," Frost said. "And that just shows that no matter where Notre Dame goes, we have a large following." 
Notre Dame sophomore Mckenna Nakamura, a native of Hawaii, said he wasn't sure which team to cheer for before the game started. 
"I was a [Hawaii] fan when we were 0 and 12, so rooting against them was hard for me," Nakamura said. 
Nakamura compromised his loyalties by wearing a Notre Dame T-shirt and a University of Hawaii hat to the game. But he held a sign that said "Even Santa picks Notre Dame" and after the game was ecstatic about the Irish win. 
''I'm so pumped about this," he said. "I never thought I'd get to see Notre Dame in my home­town." 
The only negative part about the game, Frost said, was that the Notre Dame Marching Band was not present. After the game, to fill the void left by the band, Notre Dame players Pat Kuntz and Brian Smith led the Notre Dame football team and fans in singing the Alma Mater. 
Frost was worried the Notre Dame players would have trou­ble acclimating to the weather, but said the team looked great and played mucl~ better than during the regular season. Frost said he was planning on celebrating the victory after the game and also attending Christmas Eve mass. 
"I totally forgot tomorrow was Christmas," Frost said, "because I was just so focused on this game and our team." 
But the victory was a great Christmas present, he said. 
Notre Dame junior Jonah Bautista took some friends from Notre Dame surfing earlier in the week. He said his Christmas would almost be complete with a Notre Dame bowl victory.

Martinez was arrested Sunday. He's sched­uled to be arraigned Wednesday in Monterey County Superior Court on felony charges of procuring a child under age 16 for lewd and lascivious acts, statutory rape and cruelty to a child by endangering health, according to the prosecutor. 
The prosecutor's office said Martinez did not have an attorney of record yet.

Daniels warns lawmakers about budget 
INDIANAPOLIS -Gov. Mitch Daniels cautioned lawmakers about Indiana's fiscal challenges dur­ing his State of the State speech Tuesday night, saying that drafting a new two-year budget this session will be full of hard decisions. 
But Daniels, sworn in to a second term 'on Monday, said spending restraints and other actions taken during his first term have left Indiana in better shape than many states and in a strong position not only to weather the economic hard times, but make progress. 
"Thanks in large part to the people here assem­bled, we can speak tonight of challenge, but not crisis; issues but not emergencies," Daniels told a House cb.o!Jnber packed with legislators, judges and other dignitaries. 
Gov. Blagojevich to preside over hearing 


Illinois governor to swear in Senate that will decide ifhe will be dismissed from office 
Associated Press 
SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -The state Senate that will decide whether to throw impeached Gov. Rod Blagojevich out of office will be sworn in Wednesday by -who else? -impeached Gov. Rod Blagojevich. 
In an ironic, surreal scene, the governor will preside briefly over the chamber that will hold his political life in its hands in less than two weeks. The opening of a new legislative session is normally an upbeat occasion, but how the senators and the gover­nor wiJj respond this time is anyone's guess. 
"On one hand, it's a time of great celebration here in the Senate of a new beginning and new leadership," said Sen. Jeffrey Schoenberg, an Evanston Democrat. "On the other hand, there will be no denying the fact that the gov­ernor's participation in the proceedings will give it a character and flavor that many members would just as soon not experience." 

Blagojevich was impeached by the House on Friday, a month after his arrest on fed­eral charges that he tried to sell official government action -including an appointment to President­elect Barack Obama's Senate seat -for campaign contri­president Emil Jones of the new session -no Senate sion," said Cullerton, a butions or a plush job.

Clinton plans fresh approach to diplolllacy 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday that she intends to revitalize the mission of diplomacy in American foreign policy, call­ing for a "smart power" strate­gy in the Middle .East and implicitly criticizing the Bush administration for having downgraded the role of arms control. 
At a daylong confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, President-elect Barack Obama's choice for secretary of state sailed smoothly through an array of non-con­tentious questions until two Republican committee mem­bers pressed her to take addi­tional steps to ensure that for­mer President Bill Clinton's global fundraising work does not pose even an appearance of conflict with her role as the chief U.S. diplomat. She balked, saying disclosure rules already in place were carefully crafted and adequate to avoid any conflict. 
Clinton appeared headed for easy confirmation. She encountered no challenges to her basic vision for foreign policy. 
Clinton, who will relinquish her seat in the Senate when confirmed, spoke ·confidently of Obama's intentions to renew American leadership in the world and to strengthen U.S. diplomacy. 
America cannot solve the most pressing problems on our own, and the world cannot solve them without America," she said, her daughter Chelsea seated behind her in the audi­ence. "The best way to advance America's interest in reducing global threats and seizing global opportunities is to design and implement glob­al solutions. This isn't a philo­sophical point. This is our reality." 
In laying out a general out­look for American foreign poli­cy under Obama, Clinton spoke in a clear, unhurried voice and looked at ease. She made it plain, citing policy themes that were familiar from Obama'-s presidential campaign -and in many cases her own -that the incoming Democratic administration wants to ele­vate the role of diplomacy. She and Obama contend that the Bush administration relied too heavily on the military to carry out foreign policy and that it leaned too much on ideology and too little on pragmatism. 
The Foreign Relations Committee. planned to vote on Clinton's nomination on Thursday. If it approves her, she could gain full Senate con­firmation as early as Inauguration Day. 
The Senate also held confir­mation hearings for o-ther Obama choices for Cabinet and top White llouse positions. Appearing were Peter Orszag, to head the Office of' Management and Budget, and Hobert Nabors II, for deputy director of OMB: New York housing official Shaun Donovan. to be secretary of housing and urban develop­ment; Steven Chu, to head the Energy Department; and Arne Duncan, as education secre­tary. 
Chu promised that if con­firmed as energy secretary he will aggressively pursue poli­cies aimed at addressing cli­mate change and achieving greater energy independence by developing clean energy sources. At his hearing, Duncan said that the No Child Left Behind law should stop punishing schools where only a handful of kids are strug­gling. 

Obama's choice to run the Treasury Department and to lead the economic rescue effort disclosed to senators Tuesday that he failed to pay $34,000 in taxes from 2001 to 2004, a last-minute complica­tion in an otherwise smooth path to confirmation. Timothy Geithner paid most of the past­due taxes days before Obama announced his nomination in November, an Obama transi­tion official said. The unpaid taxes were discovered by Obama's transition team while investigating Geithner's back­ground, the official said.

"We felt that they could be a useful symbol for the broader internationalization called for in [President Carol Ann Mooney's] Strategic Plan [for the College[," Meyer-Lee said. 
The building and grounds crew installed the signposts shortly before Christmas break. 
Senior Deanna Molosky said she was pleasantly surprised to see the signpost outside of the Student Center. She said "it reminded her of the Peace Pole which the Sisters of the lloly Cross have in front of the Chureh of Loretto on campus. 
Molosky spent her fall break in Monterrey, Mexico on a service pn~eet and said there was also a Peace Pole there. 
"The Peace Pole is what imme­diately jumped into my mind when I saw it followed closely by my memories of my recent jour­ney to Mexico," she said. 

Molosky also said the sign is a great way to showcase and remind students of the interna­tional opportunities available to them. 
"It also seems like it would be a great memory jogger for those who have been to those fabulous places," she said. 
Senior Angela Siler agreed, say­ing she wasn't sure why the sign­posts were installed when she ftrst saw them, but likes that she has the visual reminder of Seville, Spain on campus since she stud­ied abroad there in Fall2007. 
"Whenever I see the sign I think about my wonderful experience in Seville," Siler said. "And even though it says that Seville is 4,126 miles away, seeing the sign makes it seem like it's not that far."

IN BRIEF 
Missing pilot tied to Delta bankruptcy 
ATLANTA-Missing investment manager Marcus Schrenker's theft conviction, involvement in securities lawsuits filed against him by past clients and questions about whether he was reporting all of his income to the IRS started to unravel more than two years ago in an unlikely place for the aviation buff -Delta Air Lines' bank­ruptcy case. 
Schrenk~r, whose small plane crashed Sunday night en route to Florida in what may have been an attempt to fake his own death, over the years convinced dozens of active and retired Delta pilots to allow him to manage their retirement accounts. 
"He had a way about him -you trusted the guy," David M. Smith, one of the retired pilots, said Tuesday. "He was very credible. He talked a good story. So, we entrusted him with a task he never produced." 
WellPoint barred from adding patients 
INDIANAPOLIS -WellPoint Inc. said Monday the Centers for Medicare and Meclicaid Services suspended the company from enrolling new patients in the health insurance Medicare Advantage plan and the prescription drug benefit, Meclicare Part D. 
WellPoint, the nation's largest managed-care company based on membership, said it has been working with the federal agency over the past six months to resolve issues identified as a result of both internal and government auclits. 
"Due to a sharp increase in the past twelve days in beneficiary complaints about WellPoint and WellPoint's self-dic;closures regarcling beneficiaries b~ing denied prescription drugs, CMS is taking this immediate action to ensure that WellPoint focus~s its eilorts on correcting its significant com­pliance problems before further expanding the number of enrollees in its Medicare plans," the agency said in a notice to WellPoint. 
Th~ Inclianapolis company in a statement said that its work included "detailed action plans" to the agency. The company also said it had "engagPd an indepPndent third party to provide CMS with ongoing assessments regarding our compliance, including verification of systems, processes and procedures."

Goatwhore. 

What comes to mind when you read that word? I think the only legitimate answer to that is the amazingly talent­ed blackened death metal band formed in New Orleans in 1997. 
That's right. 
Goatwhore. 
And don't you 

ever call them a metal band. They're black­ened death metal. What is black­ened death metal you might ask? Well, as Wikipedia tells me, blackened death metal (also called "death/black metal" or "black/death metal") is a fusion genre of extreme metal utilizing clements of death metal and black metal. 
"But surely there cannot be this many genres of metal?" 
Oh, I was once as innocent and naive as you. But as it turns out, after listen­ing to countless lectures on metal music from my good friend Paul, metal is as diverse a species as homo sapi­ens. There's heavy metal, death metal, black metal, grindcore, rapcore, nu metal, the ever popular groove metal, folk metal and my personal favorite ­Viking metal, a veritable Wonka facto­ry of metal. ­
Now of course you raise the very important question, "Am I supposed to care about all of this garbage?" Yes, actually, you are-and here's my first point: there are so many genres of metal that a new metal band can potentially come into existence and claim it is its own genre simply by say­ing it has fused the styles of two differ­ent bands who have done the same thing before them. There aren't this many genres of metal because the music is different enough for such variations to exist; this "genre" -fication exists because otherwise new metal bands get pegged as being followers. And we all know you cannot be a fol-lower and still be metal (exelamation 

point). · 

But then what-does this discussion of 
metal say about music as a whole? 
Surely such an underground style as 
metal can't represent the entirety of 
the music industry. Well, I tend to 
think that it can, especially when it's 
one of the best-selling genrns in the 
business. It may pain me to realize 

that, but as Paul tells me -metal fans 
are billions strong. 

So now the problem isn't metal, the 
problem is music. What kind of an 
industry could let itself get so out of 
hand'? A world completely controlled 
by the economic interests of record 

executives and production teams. Yet 
that's what the industry has always 
been. For instance, rock bands in 

Britain weren't getting enough publici­
ty beeause of the Beatles, so along 
came the concept of the "British 

Invasion" and eV!~ry IIerman 's llermits 
or Dave Clark Five eashed in. But the 
demands of an industry didn't cripple 
music as much as they do now. 

Today we see people inventing gen­
res that don't logically make sense as a 
cheap tactic to sell more records. 

Executives have found a perfect way to 
convince avid music fans that what 

they're producing is new and different, 
and therefore really, really awesome. 
Musicians, in11uenced by such aetion, 
have followed suit: we've seen how 

Eric Cartman learned that in order to · sell a million records, all he had to do was form a Christian rock group. Yes, 
even religion has been exploited so 
more money ean be made. 

And it's not just music. Look at high­
er education. Young academics seeking 
advancement opportunity have to find 
niche markets. An appreciation of a 
holistic and comprehensive under­

standing falls by the wayside as more 
profit can be culled from ever­
increased specificity. 
So what can we do? Will "genre"­

lication last forever? If it does it could 
have lasting ramifications and reper­
cussions. Once enough of a precedent 
has been set wealthy and powerful 

individuals will start to believe that the model will work everywhere. The gov­ernment will decide to stop legislating on behalf of the country and only legis­late in favor of the personal desires of the Congress. Doctors will only work on projects that profit them personally -there go our hopes of curing dis­eases like Cancer and Alzheimers. 
Personally, I don't think music "genre" -lieation will continue forever, but we have to be careful in how we handle the problem. Here's my plan. First step: stop the problem at its source, which as I pointed out is metal. We need to condense all diffenmt forms of this branch of rock into one category, one place where Cannibal Corpse and Metallica will be forced to compete against each other in the market. The heightened economic competition will lead to a natural sur­vival of the fittest; metal fans will be fon~ed to choose to listen to only the best the unified genre has to offer. From here, the number of metal bands will dwindle until the population becomes sizable enough to be ignored by the main-stream media. Once these groups are denied attention, people will stop listening. And then, after peo­ple stop listening, the music industry will get the memo. 
I started with metal and I ended with metal; the chiasmus of my column shocks even me as I review it. But it ultimately became necessary to pro­mote a change that will aid our cul­ture. Eliminating metal will bring us to a new place, a better place, a safer place. My friend Paul isn't going to like this news, but I think he'll realize that it's for the greater good. 
Stop listening to metal and you'll save the world ... or at least you'll stop promoting what I consider to be the most annoying form of music out there. Maybe that's why I wrote this column. A-thank you.

As a senior, my friends have been constantly asking me what my plans are for next year. Being a History major that has no intention of going to Law School, my answers have been varied and usually sarcastic. However, thanks to The Observer, I know what I want to do. 
I will spend all my time reading The Observer, finding something that bothers me. Then I will write a scathing Letter to the Editor about how things have changed from "the good ole days" when I was a student. Judging by how many alums have been doing it recently, it must pay pretty well.

U-WIRE Product downsizing cheats consumers 
You wouldn't pay the same amount for half a sandwich as you would for a full one. You wouldn't pay for a "supersized" meal and be content with the regular size. So why are you paying for full-sized groceries 
Natalie Hein 

and receiving minis? 
UCLA Daily

Perhaps you've heard of downsiz­Bruin ing in reference to layoffs -a­practice that, as students, does not necessarily affect us. But our sinking economy is causing downsizing in areas beyond the job market. Downsizing, in terms of selling less product in a standard package for the same or higher price, is becoming more popular. This means fewer pota-_ to chips in a bag, less cereal in a box while you're still paying as high a price as ever. And you thought the recession wasn't affecting you. 
As our country's economic activity continues to diminish, the cost of raw materials continues to climb. Over the past few years, manufacturers have made budget cuts everywhere they could, due to the rise in cost of raw materials. 
Yet manufacturers have reached the point where there's not much fat left to trim, and so their financial burden has been passed down to us, the con­sumers. But because of our competi­tive market, manufacturers and retailers are reluctant to raise the price of their product outright. They fear breaking a popularly accepted price point because doing so would give their competition the upper hand. Surely, the last time you bought paper towels, you scanned the aisle for the lowest price for the most rolls. Knowing this consumer trend, manu­facturers and retailers often opt for a sneakier price-increase tactic: down­sizing their product. 
Changes in product sizes are virtu­ally unnoticeable to the undiscerning eye. A box of Apple Jacks now holds 15 ounces where it once held 17. Fruit Loops now hold 17 ounces where they once held 19.7. A Hershey's bar that was previously eight ounces is now 6.8 ounces ~nd parades around as a "Giant bar." Frankly, with so many weight-loss­centered New Year's resolutions, a cut in portion sizes isn't really the worst thing for the American consumer. It is the deceptive nature of these down­sizes that is really the key issue. 
A sneaky case'of Cottonelle bath tis­sue downsizing was recently unrolled by an online source, mouseprint.org, that works to expose fine print in advertising. They visually compared two packages that both claimed to hold 304 sheet rolls with each sheet measuring 4.2 by 4.0 inches. Yet, one package was noticeably taller than the other. After contacting the compa­ny and learning of the company's downsize from 4.5 inch sheets of bath tissue to 4.2, the site deduced that some of the older 4.5 width rolls were put into a newer wrapper that had the new lowered sheet count and nar­rower width on the label. They specu­lated that the packaging mistake was perhaps "an interim step in the down­sizing process to hide the change for anyone comparing the older label to the newer one." 
Such hurdles to fair-price-compar­isons should not be allowed in our market. What's more is that in many cases, a downsize cannot even be detected through side-by-side com­parison. 
I didn't notice downsizing until I was helping my mom cook dinner over break. A box of Dreamfields pasta, weighing one pound, used to fit perfectly into a canister in our kitchen. I watched my mom empty the contents of the box into the canister, and to my surprise the pasta did not reach the top. Something was wrong. I checked the box. The box that used to read 16 ounces now read 13. There was no discount for the missing three ounces, but rather a price increase. What's more troubling is that accord­ing to a Nielsen report from this past summer, products like dried pasta are supposed to .be unscathed by our eco­nomic downturn. The inaccuracy of this assertion supports a different claim that 2009 will hold a commodity cost increase double that of 2008, leaving no product immune to down­sizing. 
This supermarket shrinkdown is surely shielding us from the reality of our economic situation. We are wit­nessing few price increases at the grocery store, yet prices have sky­rocketed. The American consumer did not consent to having the wool pulled over her eyes. According to Nielsen, 47 percent of American consumers would prefer to buy larger products for more money than having their normal portions downsized, while only 9 percent of surveyed Americans showed support for downsizing. 
Manufacturers are thus not only miniaturizing their products, but also minimizing the consumer's influence in the marketplace by forcing us to comply with a price-increase strategy that we would otherwise oppose. 
Downsizing has more of a downside than just being deceptive. It produces "upsized" waste. With fewer plastic baggies in a box, there is more waste per baggie as the box is more quickly emptied and discarded, and a new box is purchased just to reach the same fate. Downsizing also leads to bungled recipes. A recipe that calls for a can of Starkist tuna will now come out less fishy due to the shrunk­en content in the cans. 
The unknowing consumers don't know to adjust their recipe to the new smaller portions until it's too late, and who has time to calculate conversions for the missing ounce or two here and there? 
As college students, our purse strings are already tighter than most, and we tend to rely on price-compari­son shopping to help us budget. Yet fair comparisons are far more diffi-­cult to make, now that downsizing has confused the market against our will. Manufacturers and retailers should be increasing prices outright instead of trying to sneak them under our noses. They've downsized their prod]lct, not my intelligence, and I'm not fooled.

CENE 
By CAITLIN FERRARO 
The big winner at the 66th Annual Golden Globe ceremony on Sunday night was "Slumdog 
illionaire," fhe film about an impoverished teenager, Jamal Malik, from the streets of Mumbai 
ho is accused of cheating on India's version of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" After the votes were tabulated, the Hollywood Foreign Press honored the film with four awards including Best Motion Picture -Drama, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Original Score. This was a surpris­ing sweep for a semi-Indie film originally playing in only select Gities, but a well-deserved one. The film is an innovative story of Jamal looking back on how he discovered each of the answers to the game show throughout his difficult life. 
Another big winner of the evening was Kate Winslet who was honored with Best Actress ­Drama for "Revolutionary Road" 
Cleavage was the name of the game at this year's Golden Globes. Almost every dress highlighted the actress' busts by tightening the material around her mid-section and avoiding the usually present necklaces, drawing further atten­tion to the lady's upper-half, where one would naturally expect to find 
ewels dangling around the collar­bone. Hayden Panettiere, in a deep purple sequined design from Gianfranco Ferre, exhibited this look well. Many others also cap­tured the same feel including Eva Longoria Parker, Anna Paquin, Rumer Willis (who stunned viewers in a beautiful purple Reem Acra gown and eclipsing her status of being just Bruce Willis and Demi Moore's daughter). Tina Fey and Drew Barrymore (who unfortunate­ly looked like an 80's prom night­mare with her over-teased hair and far too-pale blue mermaid gown). It almost felt like in the hopes of being anti-Hollywood with their and Best upporting Actress for "The Reader." Winslet was a,bsolutely giddy during her accept­ance speeches, and seemed gen­uinely surprised and grateful at both her wins. Overall it seemed. like a good night to be from the United Kingdom as Sally Hawkins, Simon Beaufoy, Danny Boyle and Colin Farrell joined Winslet in win­ning. 

Best Performance by an Actor' in a Motion Picture -Drama was handed out to Mickey Rourke for "The Wrestler" who seems to be this year's comeback kid. He joked that Robert Downey Jr. should give the speech for him, but he did a good job himself with a heartfelt speech thanking those who took a chance by casting him. Intriguingly, Darren Aronofsky, the film's director, gave him the finger (although the West Coast missed it due to the 7-second delay). "The Wrestler" \Vas also praised for Best Original Song, which was written and performed by Bruce Springsteen. Springsteen thanked Rourke for inspiring him to write the song, as the two have been 
of over-powering jeweled neck­laces, they all cemented the look as the ultimate Hollywood trend. 
Blake Lively did not hit it off with her gown on the red carpet. Was the color fabulous? Yes. Was the sequined beading fabulous? Yes. Were her hair and makeup fabu­lous? Yes. Then what could possibly be the problem for this fashion icon? Well, it was very difficult to focus on all of those wonderful attributes when Blake Lively's peri­winkle Nina Ricci gown was just a little too tight. Though Blake Lively has a wonderful-figure and is a gor­geous girl, all eyes were drawn to her mid-section, which wasn't flat­teringly displayed by the dress she chose. Stars need to take into account the highlights and shadows that will be created when they walk; the red carpet and Lively's gown turned--features that weren't bad into major faults because of the ill fit of the otherwise beautiful dress. Tips on the proper fit of a gown could have been taken from the beautiful Megan Fox who allur­ingly shimmered in a Ralph Lauren confection of gold and glitter or Beyonce who always looks fabulous

Anne Hathaway looked sophisti­cated and elegant in her navy blue and black hand-pleated bustier gown from Armani P'rive, which was accented with cool blue high­lights.

January Jones also picked an extremely beautiful color to compliment her light blonde hair and pale complexion and her icy blue Versace gown did just the trick. The elassiest act of all Sunday night was Kate Winslet in her black belted Yves Saint Laurent gown, and not just because she has a British accent. Her hair, makeup and dress looked every bit the part of a Golden Globe winner, and that she was, scooping up two Golden Globes in the Best Actress category for "Revolutionary Road" and Best Supporting Actress category for "The Header."

Things could not have gone much better for the Irish in paradise. 
After a week spent sunbathing, surfing, shutting down water parks and apparently a few very produc­tive practices, Notre Dame took the field. 
The 70 degree temperature and soft Pacific breeze made for pretty nice game condi­tions. There was even a rainbow on the horizon. 
The Irish took advantage by racking up enough records and gaudy stats to make a freezing, bitter loss to Syracuse a month earlier almost seem like a bad dream. 
Almost. 

As nice as the blowout victory was, the real story of the Irish foot­ball season was the struggles in the second half of the year or more importantly how to fix them. The offense certainly looked fixed against Hawaii. It looked good enough to give most of the Irish nation ridiculous expectations for next season. But don't confuse one very good performance against a shaky defense with the kind of offense that wins championships. There is still plenty of work to be done. 
If the Hawaii Bowl proved any­thing, it was that the program as a whole is headed in the right direc­tion. 
That progress starts at the very top. If there is any honeymoon peri­od for an athletic director, Notre Dame's Jack Swarbrick didn't have very long to enjoy his. Before the end of his first semester at the reins he had a very difficult deci­sion to make with what must have seemed like the entire world look­ing over his shoulder.

The success continued to trickle down to the field and nowhere was it more apparent than with embat­tled sophomore quarterback Jimmy Clausen. His stats (22-of-26, 401 yards passing, and five passing touchdowns) are a little bit mis­leading-they could have been much better. 
The four passes that fell incom­plete were all well thrown balls, two should have been catches and the other two could have been. The 400 yards passing and five touch­downs were jammed into less than two-thirds of the game. Clausen's day was over with 7:22 left in the third quarter.

Tate and Clausen definitely stood out, but the team also played as a unit with several guys stepping up as role players. Armando Allen and Robert Hughes were both big assets to the offense out of th backfield. On the other side of the ball, Ethan Johnson had a huge game with two sacks, almost matching his total for the regular season. Senior line­backer Steve Quinn also had a career day with a sack and five tackles. 
From top to bottom Notre Dame was the better team in a postseason matchup .for the first time in over a decade, which is clearly moving in the right direction.

Celebrating the end of a drought 
By BILL BRINK Sports Editor 
The mix of emotions on the field after Notre Dame's 49-21 win over Hawai'i in the Hawai'i Bowl on Dec. 24 stretched from bewildered to jubilant to comic. 
And who can blame them? The players had just ended a nine-bowl game losing streak in a convincing fashion. 
The bewildered: quarterback Jimmy Clausen, whose 401 yards passing and five touchdowns in about three quarters of play electrified Notre Dame's offense. He walked around with the giant Sheraton Hawai'i Bowl trophy with a confused look on his face, shouting, "Where do you want me to put this?" to no one in particular. Whether he was bewildered by his strong performance or the fact that he got stuck with the heavy trophy was anyone's guess. 
The jubilant: pretty much everybody else. As soon as the final whistle sounded, senior safety David Bruton screamed, ''I'm free! I'm no longer Irish." Running back Armando Allen donned the leprechaun's hat. and Bruton waved the Irish flag. 
Defensive back Sergio Brown, disap­pointed with his view of the celebration, hopped on freshman Mike Golic Jr.'s shoul­ders. "I come to Hawai'i to do two things," he says, channeling his inner Duke Nukem: "Kick some a** and chew bubble gum. And guess what: I'm all out of bubble gum." 
This prompted a round of makeshift Hawaiian cheers -'aloha' and 'mele kalikimaka' were really all anybody knew. 
Dan Wenger wanted a better view too, but nobody had the power to get him up high enough. 
The comic: who else but defensive tackle Pat Kuntz, signing autographs near the tunnel before heading to the locker room. While signing helmets and shirts, he made sure to protect his name. "These better go for at least 50 bucks," he shouted to the fans. 
The players' reaction came as no sur­prise considering the end of Notre Dame's regular season. The Irish lost four of their last five, threw up a goose egg at Boston College, fell in the final minute on senior day to Syracuse and couldn't cover the 31.5-point spread against USC. Coach Charlie Weis' job hung in limbo for a few days, and the Irish, who looked like they had erased all memories from last year's 3­9 season, slipped closer to their previous persona. 
The perception that little had changed stayed with the fans and made Hawai'i a trendy upset pick. Some questioned why Notre Dame should go to a bowl at 6-6, let alone get a week in Honolulu. 

But after the game, Weis said Clausen's success stemmed from the bowl bid and the extra time the team had to practice. 
"One of the reasons for going to a bowl game at 6-6 is all those extra practices," Weis said. "Things that in the hectic sched­ule of a normal week, you don't have time to focus on, you can work on." 
Clausen said he worked on the little things, like footwork, during the three weeks Notre Dame had to prepare for the bowl game. It showed: 22-of-26, 401 yards, five touchdowns, and new Notre Dame bowl records for completion percentage, yards and touchdowns. 
And the celebrations continued. Weis' Hawaiian-style Notre Dame shirt looked suspiciously damp and red, as if someone had dumped a cooler of Gatorade on him.

Linebacker Brian Smith stole injured fresh­man Kallen Wade's crutch to use as an oar on top of a bench. Players, families, coach­es, coordinators, cheerleaders, assistants and managers embraced left and right, happy to be, as Kuntz said, part of "the team that did it." 
The Irish fans, about 150 of them, stayed well after the fmal play and watched the celebration. Then they honored the team with an impromptu alma mater. 
But receiver Golden Tate seemed to want more. Not more celebration, but more suc­cess. ''I'm going to enjoy Hawai'i," said Tate, who had six catches for 177 yards and three touchdowns and shared the MVP with Clausen. "I don't want to come back here for a bowl again."

One shy of a Ha-waii 5-0 
Notre Dame flew southwest to spend its Christmas in Honolulu with plenty to 
prove. The Irish were coming off a disappointing end to their season, head coach Charlie Weis needed a chance to prove his critics wrong, and the whole team was trying to snap an NCAA record nine game drought in the postseason. The Irish accomplished all of their goals and then some. Sophomore quarter­
back Jimmy Oausen exploded for 401 yards passing and five touchdowns through the air. He and his teammates tore apart the Notre Dame and NCAA record books by hanging 49 points on the clearly overmatched Rainbow Warrior defense. On the other side of the ball, the defense was not to be outdone. They posted eight sacks, five tipped passes, an interception and a fumble recovery against the high-flying Hawaiian offense. 
Notre Dame's senior captains all road into the sunset in style. Safety David 
Bruton had two turnovers and wide reciever David Grimes hauled in a touch­down pass in the second quarter. Coaches Mike Haywood and Jappy Oliver also had sweet goodbyes as they finished their final games on the Irish sidelines. 

Clockwise from top, Golden Tate sheds a defender after one of his six catches; Senior Pat Kuntz strikes up the band for the alma mater; Armando Allen celebrates one of his two touchdowns; Tate avoids tacklers and sideline ads in the third quarter; Senior David Bruton takes down a Hawai'i receiver for one of his four tackles in Honolulu.

In the heart of Mumbai's over­whelmingly impoverished and over­crowded slums .lives orphan Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), the 18 year-old hero of "Slumdog Millionaire" who brings hope to his lost childhood love· and the millions of Mumbai's desti­tute inhabitants when he lands a spot on India's version of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire." 
As he answers more and more questions correctly, suspicions mount that this barely educated boy who has lived on the streets the majority of his life might be cheating and he is taken in for governmental question­ing when the show breaks for the evening. After being physically tor­
.· · tured and intimidated by the impa­tient Indian police, he finally confess­es to how he knew each answer and the revealing anecdotes he shares covering events from his childhood to the present day show how honest and how pure this gem from the slums really is. Irish director and Golden Globe winner Danny Boyle calls this mas­terpiece his "love letter to Mumbai," and does his best to capture the prominent role the belief in destiny plays in the Indian culture by using it 
as the motivating factor that drives the actions of his protagonist. In an interview with Fox Searchlight Pictures, he says of the multitude of Indians living in poverty, "They accept, you knQw, maybe what we would regard as a terrible condition of life ... They 51ccept that-that that is their destiny." The Indian belief that they are in the place they are supposed to be allows them to accept and cope with their living conditions and the situations they are placed in and it is this belief in destiny fused with the Western belief in controlling your own destiny that drives Jamal Malik's pursuit of a better life. 
The pursuit of his fate begins shortly after being orphaned when young Jamal realizes that all he has to rely on for his survival is his older brother Salim (Madhur Mittal). While he and his brother flee the Hindi­Muslim conflict in his village that was responsible for the death of his moth­er, they come across a dirty lonely girl abandoned in the streets and from the moment Jamal's eyes fall on this intriguing and innocent orphan named Latika (Freida Pinto), he knows she is the third musketeer he and his brother Salim have been missing.

even though as

Because Jamal knows he is destined to be with Latika, he refuses to give up pursuit of her and it is this belief destiny that drives his final attempt to re.unite with her by appearing on and determinedly win-IP· ning "Who Wants to be Millionaire."

This winner of four Golden Globes, including Best Director, Picture, Screenplay and Score truly deserves every award that comes its way. The roles were perfectly cast, the plot and screenplay indulgea the audi­ence with a bittersweet taste of life on the Mumbai streets, and the fusion of Indian beats and American hip-hop mirrored the audiences' desire to run with Jamal, Latika, and "Slumdog Millionaire" away from life's hardships and into the winner's circle.

NCAA BASKETBALL 

Associated Press 

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. Jodie Meeks was just try­ing to get a victory. He didn't fathom having a chance at earning a spot among Kentucky's great­est players. 
Meeks scored a school­record 54 points to help Kentucky cruise to a 90­
72  win  over  No.  24  
Tennessee  on  Tuesday  
night.  

"It means a lot oo be in the same sentence as Dan Issel. It's mind-boggling," he said. "I was just out there playing to win." 
Meeks, who broke Issei's 39-year-old record of 53 points set at Mississippi, was mobbed by his Kentucky team­mates in the middle of the Thompson-Boling Arena court, where the Wildcats (13-4, 2-0 SEC) handed the Volunteers their third loss in January. 
The Southeastern Conference's leading scor­er surpassed liis previous high of 46 points, which he set Dec. 20 against Appalachian State, with 
4:50 left as he hit an open 3, one of 10 3-pointers he would make for the night. He set the record with free throws with 1:31 left. 
Meeks entered the game ranked fourth in the nation in scoring with an average 24.2 points per game. 
"I have never seen any­thing like it," Kentucky coach Billy Gillispie said. "Jodie Meeks had 46 against Appalachian State, and they are a nice team, but not near a team the quality of Tennessee and on the home court." 
The 54 points was also the biggest indiyidual SEC performance since Chris Jackson's 55 for LSU 
against Mississippi  in  
1989.  
"There have been  so  

many great players -this is the greatest basketball tradition in the world at the collegiate level -and to be able to put your name up there with some of those greats is quite an accomplishment," Gillispie said. 

Down by 6 at the half, Tennessee (10-5, 1-1) cut Kentucky's lead to 43-41 on a fastbreak basket by Wayne Chism a minute and a half into the second half. 
But the Vols' spotty defense couldn't contain Meeks, who hit a layup and two 3-pointers to help the Wildcats on a 10-0 run that gave them a 53­41 lead. Even contested shots sank perfectly through the nets. 
"Defensively we tried to guard him as a team," Tennessee coach Bruce Pearl said. 
IN BRIEF Atlanta reaches prelimi­
nary deal witli Lowe 
ATLANTA -The Braves bounced right back from the disappointment of losing John Smoltz. 
Determined to rebuild a once­proud pitching staff that fell into disarray, Atlanta reached a prelimi­nary agreement Tuesday on a $60 million, four-year contract with Derek Lowe and finalized a deal with Japanese all-star pitcher Kenshin Kawakami. 
Just like that, the Braves' rotation -once the most dominant in base­ball -suddenly looks a whole lot stronger with spring training just a month away. 
"You've got to have pitching," manager Bobby Cox said. "You could have the best hitting team in the history of baseball and you still may not get it done. We will feel confident now that whoever toes the mound on any particular night, we've got a good chance of win­ning." 
Boston College hires 
Spaziani as head coach 
BOSTON -Frank Spaziani stayed at Boston College,. even though he was disappointed when he was passed over for the head coaching job in 2006. 
That loyalty paid off Tuesday when the longtime assistant was promoted to the top spot. 
The 61-year-old who built top defenses during his 10 years as coordinator succeeds Jeff Jagodzinski, who was fired last Wednesday after two seasons when he interviewed for the New York Jets coaching job after being told he would be dis­missed if he did so. 
''The fact that he (Spaziani) really wants to· be here at Boston College and bleeds maroon and gold, that was extremely important," athletic director Gene DeFilippo said, "but it wasn't the most impor­tant factor." 
Trial about Burress' car 
lease to begin today LEBANON, Pa. -Plaxico Burress is in court again. 
A civil trial is scheduled to begin Wednesday in Pennsylvania to determine how much the New York Giants wide receiver will have to pay in dam­ages over a car he leased that ended up being impounded by New York City police. 
New York police said Tuesday that they impounded the car in August 2005 in connection with a shooting in the Bronx. Arrests were made, but the records were sealed and police gave no other details about the incident. 
Court papers in Pennsylvania say a Lebanon County car dealer allowed Burress to borrow a 2004 Chevrolet Avalanche worth more than $36,000 in exchange for Burress agreeing to sign autographs at promotional events. 

Exuberant, intense and defense-oriented, Mora takes over for Holmgren bringing a different look to the Seahawks 
Associated Press 
RENTON, Wash. -Jim Mora threw his hands above his head. He punched the air. He made sharp, slicing motions with his hands for emphasis. 
He talked of running at 
5:30 a.m., wearing a head­lamp, up his favorite moun­tain outside Seattle. No switchbacks, straight up. Like most of his coaching career. 
''I'll be there Friday morn­ing, if anyone wants to join me," Mora said, a smile !'lashing across the 47-year­old's boyish face.

that kept the Gators out of the NCAA tournament last year for the first time in a decade. 
Florida has struggled rebounding, defending the paint and the 3-point line, and matching up against athletic teams. Donovan has tried to camouflage those weaknesses with an occasional press, some traps and an up-and-down tempo designed to force opponents into ill-advised shots. 
So far, so good. The Gators have won 11 of 12 and even beat Mississippi last weekend despite get­ting outrebounded 46-22. But Donovan believes things have to change for his team to have sustained success this season. 
"There's definitely some deficiencies and things we. have," Donovan said. "Every team has it. There's no pure team that has no weaknesses. But the good teams identify what their problems are and what they've got to do to mask them or overcome them or really confront them in a way that they say, 'There's a commitment where we're not going to let this hap­pen.' 
"Some of the things on forced teams to reconsider driving the lane.

The Gators lead the league in assists and 3-pointers, and rank second in turnover margin. But they're lOth in rebounding, and last in blocked shots and 3-point defense. 
"We've definitely got to be better at other things," Parsons said. "We've got to shoot the ball more consis­tent, we've got to block out better, we've got to defend. better. There's a lot of things we need to work on.

The Gators, who lost cen­ter Marreese Speights to the NBA last summer, had hoped to get some inside presence from 6-10 centers Kenny Kadji and Eloy Vargas as well as fellow freshman Allan Chaney. But Donovan said they have other shortcomings pre­venting them from logging many minutes. 
It could get better next season with the addition of 6-10 Georgetown transfer Vernon Macklin, but Donovan cautioned against considering Macklin the answer to the team's post woes.

Pioli latest piece of Patriots' tree to branch 
Associated Press 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -Scott Pioli, who helped build and lead a dynasty in New England, is now in charge of a Kansas City franchise which hasn't won a playoff game in 14 years. 
The 43-year-old Pioli will be introduced on Wednesday as Chiefs general manager, replac­ing Carl Peterson. 
"He will have complete charge of football operations," Ryan Petkoff, a spokesman for Chiefs chairman Clark Hunt, told The Associated Press. "He will report only to Clark." 
The fate of coach Herm Edwards and his staff was not immediately known.

The fan base is loyal, though restive, and the team will be playing next year in a virtually new stadium. Arrowhead, which opened in 1972 and is notorious for being loud and rough on vis­iting teams, is undergoing a $325 million renovation, which includes new luxury boxes, wider concourses and enhanced amenities in addition to new practice facilities, an enlarged indoor field and a brand new state-of-the-art headquarters building. 
In addition, the Chiefs are about $32 million under the salary cap, extra money that will. come ,in handy because KC owns the overall No. 3 pick in the draft. Besides that, there are a number of promising young players who Edwards was

counting on as the foundation of his rebuilding project. 
Pioli, the son-in-law of Miami Dolphins boss Bill Parcells, has been honored many times for his contributions to the Patriots' three Super Bowl champi­onships. With Pioli working with Belichick, the Patriots used an effective mix-and-match of trades, free agent signings and draft selections to dominate the league. In 2007, six players drafted by Pioli and Belichick made the Pro Bowl. 
"We are very excited to wel­come Scott to the Chiefs," Hunt said in a statement. "With his proven track record of success, Scott is the finest player person­nel executive in the NFL, and we look forward to his leadership in building a championship organi­
zation."

said. "He is thor­

all possible resources to help 
coach Belichick and his staff 
lield the players needed to win 
consistently. He has played an 
important role in building a 
championship tradition with 
players that I am proud to call 
Patriots." 
Pioli's NFL career started 
when Belichick hired him as a 
pro personnel assistant for the 
Browns in 1992. Belichick then 
brought him to New England 
shortly after he became head 
coach of the Patriots. 
From 2000-08, the Patriots 
were an NFL-best 102-42 in the 
regular season and rang up 14 
playoff wins. · 
"To sum up in words every­thing Scott Pioli has meant to this organization and to me per­sonally would be difficult, if not impossible," said Belichick. "From the day I met him. he has demonstrated a passion for foot­ball and respect for the game that is second to none." 
A club spokesman conlirmed there had been no determina­tion made on Edwards' status. That may have been a point of discussion between Pioli and Hunt when they negotiated their deal. Hunt signed off on the rebuilding project that Edwards launched this year and said in training camp he knew it would be a painful process early on. 
And it certainly was. Beset by injury, including season-ending mishaps to the top two quarter­backs, the Chiefs beat only Oakland and Denver and set a number of team records for defensive futility. Their 10 sacks were an NFL-low since the stat was kept beginning in 1981. 
Yet, when he announced the resignation on Dec. 15 of presi­.dent, CEO and general manager Peterson, Hunt said he thought Edwards was the best man for the Chiefs program going for­ward. But he also said the new general manager would have "significant input" into the final decision.

MEN'S SWIMMING 

ND opens spring season ice cold 
By MOLLY SAMMON Sports Writer 
For its annual winter break training trip, Notre Dame spent time in San Juan, Puerto Rico for rigorous training. When the Irish returned, a loss to Louisville brought them back to reality. 
In an open-air, 10-lane lap pool, the swimmers and divers trained twice a day, then lifted weights and did other dry-land workouts for all-around training. 
"!The practices! brought our team closer because it was necessary to rely on each other to reach the level or training we desired," sopho­more Pat Augustyn said. 
To depart from the normal 
practices, they participated in an informal meet against both Southern Illinois University and LaSalle University while in Puerto Rico on a different part of the island. 
On the way back to South Bend, the team made a stop at Louisville, currently ranked ' No. 16, for a conference meet, but a 1 7 8-117 Cardinal victo­ry dropped the Irish confer­ence record to 3-4. 
"We saw to our potential, although we came up a little bit short in the end," Augustyn said. 
In the 200-free, John Lytle 
(1:40.51) came in a close sec­ond, and Andrew Hoffman 
(1:43.51) came in fourth. 
The 200-medley relay team, composed of Mitchell Sherman, Marshall Sherman, 
Patrick Augustyn and David Anderson, finished in third place (1:37.06), unable to keep up with two accom­plished Cardinal backstro­kers. 
Irish swimmers Michael Sullivan and Bill Bauman fin­ished first and second respec­tively in the 200-individual medley. 
In the three-meter diving event, Caleb Dunnichay took first with 369.80 points, fol­lowed by Irish divers Eric Lex in second place and Wesley Villa11or in third. 
The season picks up again on Jan. 16 for a home meet against Northwestern.

Senior Billy Buzaid followed freshmen Jordan Rincon in taking the top two spots in the m.en 's 600 at the Indiana Opener in Bloomington, Ind. Saturday. 
The meet at Indiana University was the team's lirst since the Blue-Gold Meet before Christmas Break, and only its second meet overall 
Hincon's time of 1:20.46 bested Buzaid by only 0.4 sec­onds. 
In the women's 600-meter dash, sophomores Kelly Langhans and Natalie Johnson also finished first and second, running times of 1:33.47 and 1 :34.65, respoctively. 
Most of the team was allowed to enjoy the extent or their holiday break, and thus less than 25 athletes competed Saturday, yet the list or posi­tive starts to the season con­tinues. Senior Anna Weber qualified !'or the NCAA Championships in the women's weight throw with a throw of 
19.18 meters, finishing only a half meter out of first and earning second. Weber also placed seventh in the shot put at 14 meters. 
Sophomore Justin Schneider took fourth in the men's 800 with a time of 1:56.81. Coach Joe Paine described Schneider's performance as "pretty good, since he's a decathlete." 

Junior Erie Quick placed sec­ond in the long jump by leap­ing 7.13 meters, or over 23 feet. 
"Eric Quick had an excep­tionally good opening perform­ance," Coach Paine said. 
Senior Mary Saxer won the women's pole vault with a height of 4.00 meters. Junior Joanna Schultz came in third in the women's 200 meters with a time of 25.10, and Schultz touk fifth in the 400 
meters by posting a  time of  
56.29 seconds.  
Finishing  fourth  in  the  

women's 800-meter run was junior Elizabeth Myers at 2:15.76, and freshmen Maddie Buttinger finished fourth in the high jump with a height of 1. 70 meters. 
The men's team received fourth-place finishes from jun­ior pole vaulter Matt Schipper as he cleared 4. 90 meters, and sophomore shot putter Denes Veres took fourth with a 16.58 meter toss. 
The solid start to the season left Paine looking to the future. 
"Where we really want to run well is the Big East meet," Paine said. "This was just one small step to getting the ream ready for the Big East." 
On Friday, the Irish return to the Loftus Center to host the Notre Dame Indoor Opener, and next week host a quad meet with Marquette, Michigan State and Wisconsin.

Padres to give Prior yet another chance 
Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO -Right-hander Mark Prior, who has missed more than two full seasons because of shoulder problems, and infielder Chris Burke agreed to minor league con­tracts with the San Diego Padres on Tuesday and were invited to spring training. 
Prior signed with the Padres as a free agent prior to the 2008 season but missed the entire year after undergoing surgery on his right shoulder on June 4, the latest medical setback to a once-promising career. 
Prior also missed the 2007 season after undergoing sur­gery on the same shoulder that April. 
He last pitched in the big leagues on Aug. 10, 2006, with the Chicago Cubs. He was 1-6 with a 7.21 ERA that sea­son. 
Padres general manager Kevin Towers said Prior threw off a mound on Friday for the first time since surgery, and the report from team trainer Todd Hutcheson was good. 
"The last surgery benefited him a great deal," Towers said. "It looks like his mechan­ics are back in line again and he has good carries on his throws when he's doing long tosses. 

"He's had quite a few sur­geries, and we're hoping this one certainly fixed any issues he had," Towers said. "I hate to put any timelines on it, but we hope he's pitching compet­itively at the start of the sea­son. If it's not in the Qig leagues, then maybe a few starts in the minor leagues." 
Prior will make $1 million if he's on the big league roster. Jlis salary is not guaranteed. 
Prior was once thought to be the Cubs' ace of the future. In 2003, he finished third in the NL Cy Young Award voting, was 18-6 with a 2.43 ERA and struck out 245 in 211 1-3 innings. 
That October, he was on the mound for Game 6 of the NL championship series against Florida with the Cubs leading the series 3-2. Chicago led by three runs in the eighth inning before the Marlins, perhaps helped by fan Steve Bartman's play on a foul ball at Wrigley Field, rallied to win. Florida won Game 7, then went on to win the World Series. 
Prior has won just 18 games since then. 
He grew up in San Diego and was the second pick overall in the 2001 amateur draft.

"I don't think the team played great as a whole," he said. "We were definitely a little rusty." 
Against Minnesota-Duluth, the Iri.c;h started hot, with two goals in the opening period from senior Garrett Regan. Senior Erik Condra added an empty-net goal with one second left in the game to give Notre Dame a 3-1 win and the Shillelagh Tournament title. Irish goalie Jordan Pearce was named the totirnament's most outstanding player. 
"I give them a lot of credit because it looks like we eame back in good shape," Notre Dmne coach Jeff Jackson said. "I thought we played really well against Duluth Saturday night." 
Jackson said he was pleased with the outcome of a tournament as a whole, and credited Associate Athletic Director Tom Nevala for organizing it. 
"He did an outstanding job in making it a first-class event," Jackson said. "I thought it was a huge suceess and I know that we're looking at doing it again next year. With a full year to actually market it and sell it, it would be an outstand­ing tradition." 
The Iri.c;h continued their winning ways last wenkend against Alaska, eking out 2-0 and 3-0 wins in games that entered the third period scornless. In the first game, junior Ryan Thang notched a goal at 
11:40 of tho final period, and Condra addPd and empty-netter to clineh the game. In the second game, llanson snapped the dead­lock at 5:53 of the Ulird period with his team-leading 14th goal of the season. Ryan added another at 12:28, and Thang notched an empty-net goal to finish the scoring. 
Jackson said his team's ability to wait for the right chance was eru­cia:l in the wine; over the Nanooks. 
"When you're playing against teams that strt.'SS a lot of defense, it's hard to generate scoring chances," he said. "So you're going to have to be patient." 
Hanson echoed hie; coach, saying that it wac; important that the team remained ca:lm, even ifthey weren't scoring goals. 
"If we got a:head of ourselves or got a little antsy and took a stupid penalty, they definitely had the abili­ty to r,apita.lize and then just pack it in for the rest of the game," he said. 
Jackson also praised Pnarce for his back-to-back shutouts. "He's been a rock all season," he said. "And I think this weekend was 

juc;t a eulmination of it." 
The wins maintained Notre Dame's hold on the top spot in the CCHA, giving the Irish a five-point cushion over Mimni (01-I). 
"Ibe four wins to start the second half are a stark contrast to last year when the Irish, hot going into the brca:k, went 2-5-1 and struggled for much of the second half before rebounding in thn NCAA Tournament. 
"Going through that last year, I think it really gave us a lot of experi­ence," Hanson said. "Before Christmac; break we had a team meeting where we really stressed the importance of guys staying in shape over brea:k." 
The Irish haven't lost since an Oct. 25 defeat to the hands ofMimni (OH), but Hanson said while win­ning was obviously a good thing, the team wouldn't rest on their labrels. 
"It's something to be proud of," he said. "But it's also something that we can't get caught up in." 
Jackson was more frank with his evaluation of his team's suceess. 
"We're not going to win every game the rest of the way," he said. "We just have to be prepared so that when we do lose, we bounce back well the next game."

Hanks brings home second Hermann Trophy, one offour players ever to win two 
By BILL BRINK Sports Editor 
It may not ease the pain of losing a National Championship, but being named the best player in the country can't hurt. 
Irish senior forward Kerri Hanks won the MAC Hermann Trophy, awarded to the best Div. I player, for the second time in four years, becoming the fourth player ever to win the award twice. She joins Mia Hamm and Cindy Parlow from North Carolina and Christine Sinclair from Portland State, the other two­time recipients. 
''I'm grateful to everyone at Notre Dame -my team­mates, coaches, staff and our fans who are the greatest in the country -for all of their support, not only this year but throughout my career," Hanks said in a statement

Winning s·treak still intact 
By SAM WERNER Sports Writer 

The Irish picked up right where they left off before Christmas break, winning games against Union, Minnesota-Duluth and Alaska to run their unbeaten streak to 18 games. 
After a three-week break, Notre Dame returned to action on Jan. 2 and 3, hosting the Shillelagh tourna­ment against Union, Minnesota­Duluth, and Massachusetts-Lowell. 
In the first game against Union, the Irish fell behind 1-0 after the first period, but rebounded thanks to goals from senior Justin White and sophomore Ben Ryan. Junior Dan Kis..'iel added a third-period goal to secure the win and a spot in the tournament title game against the Bulldogs. Despite the win, senior Christian Hanson said he thought the team could have played better.

Belles beat first ranked team since going D-ill 
By KATE GRABAREK Sports Writer 

The Belles broke new ground over the break and accomplished something they've never done. 
Saint Mary's bounced back from an early deficit to defeat No. 1 Hope College 91-84, winning the first game over a ranked oppo­nent since joining Div. III over 10 years ago. 
"Our team never gave up in the Hope game," head coach Jen Henley said. "We were down 10 points with 
6:15 left to go. We did a nice job on the boards down 
the stretch and our bench gave us a lift on the offen­sive end." 
Senior Nicole Beier had a breakout second half to lead the Belles in scoring for the game. Beier scored a career-high 25 points, 17 of those coming in the second half of the game. 
Freshman Patsy Mahoney also stepped up for the Belles, scoring 18 points and 11 in the second half. 
"I think our freshmen have adapted well to their first season of college bas­ketball," Henley said. "I believe they understand
