The nation's media chip in with a few notes of local interest-
Beano Cook of ABC television sports: This year's Notre ])arne-Southern Cal gan ,e drew the largest television audience of any regular season football game (pro or college), more than 13 million. 
* * * 

Paul Zimmerman of the New York Post: Why is the Army-Notre Dame game headed for Yankee Stadium on Oct. 11 instead of Shea, as originally planned? ... The Mets finish the baseball schedule out of town, the Yankees at home, which means Shea is available for football the last week in September...That leaves only one wild guess: The Mets have a W or!d Series hunch...Is that wild? ... Or just plain fanciful? 
* * * 

Jim Murray of the Los Angeles Timess: I played golf with Joe Willie (Namath) Thursday at the Astrojet tournament down here. "Hello, I'm Jim Murray," I told him. "Nobody's perfect," said Joe Willie ... 
To find Joe Willie, you first have to peel off the protective layer of blondes in calfskin boots and miniskirts and purple sunglasses. If it's dark out, you can find Joe Willie. Just follow the scent of Chane! No. 5. Or listen for a lot of whispers. Joe only knows girls who whisper all the time. He introduces you to them by their first names alone. 
They say New York i~ a washed-up town but Joe Willie proved it's still the Big Ar pie. Even the muggers would ask for his autograph if they found him walking through Central Park alone at night. The little kid from Pennsylvania's coal country took one look at the mines and started firing footballs through tires. Fifty-two schools were after him. Bear Bryant gave him everything he could, and Bear is all-powerful. 
"I went to Notre Dame but I nearly had a heart attack when I found out they didn't have women," Joe told me on a fairway when we briefly came together. "They said, 'There's a girls' school just across the lake.' I said, 'Man, I don't SWIM after my women. I want them, like, they can come up to MY place. I don't want to talk to them on no pay phones."'

Gustavus (15-2-1) enters the NAJA tournament next week on the strength of its fourth consecutive MIAC championship. The Gusties have lost only once since Notre Dame handed them a season opening 6-3 defeat in December. 

Led by NAJA all-American defenseman Pat McKusky and center Jerry Kreiger, the MIAC's leading scorer, the Gusties have averaged a fantastic 7.6 goals per game while permitting only 2.9 a game to be scored against them. 
Compared with those statistics, Notre Dame's 5.4 for and 4.4 against seem meager. 

Centers Kevin Hoene and Phil Wittliff pack most of the Irish fire power. Hoene leads the team in total points (45) and assists 
(22) while Wittliff leads goal production (27) and is secotld to Hoene in points ( 40). 
Although Ohio State has lost its only two Big Ten games to Wisconsin, the Badgers have also been a nemesis to Notre Dame tagging the Irish with four of their seven loses. 
The Buckeyes own a 10-17-0 record on the season. 

Track 

After grabhing second place in the 14-team Central Collegiate Conference Championships last weekend, the University of Notre Dame track and field team will host Miami of Ohio in a dual meet Saturday, March I.

Irish on ice tonight 
annual event. 
Bill Hurd, All-America sprinter of the Irish, copped CCC first place trophies in both the 60 yard dash (:06.3) and the 300-yard run (: 30.6 ). 
Other Notre Dame firsts were: Rich Wohlhuter in the 600-yard run, Jim Brady in the 880-yard run and Joe Quigley in the I 000-yard run. 
Wohlhuter's time of I:09.4 in the 600 took a full second off the CCC record of I: I 0.4. 
Miami brings a 5-0 record into the meet and has the best pole vaulter the Irish will face all season-Lester Smith who has done 1 6-7 indoors this season.

Irish heavyweight Pat Mudron had little difficulty winning his match yesterday at Illinois-Chicago Circle. 
Athens, 0., on Saturday. 
Notre Dame's tank unit split a pair of decisions at home this past weekend with a couple of Big Ten representatives. The Irish halted a three-meet string of losses by walloping Northwestern, 66-46, in their first encounter but fell to the Boilermakers of Purdue, 71-52, two days later. With their season record hovering precariously just above the .500-mark at six wins-four losses, the Irish swimmers view this final road trip as crucial to their hopes for a successful season. 
The lone bright effort in Notre Dame's Joss to Purdue occurred when the Irish 400-yard freestyle relay team lowered the pool and varsity standards in that event by one-second with a 3:21.5 clocking. Seniors Mike Davis, Tom Hock, Bill Ladouceur, and John May combined to lower the mark established last year in the Motor City Invitational.
