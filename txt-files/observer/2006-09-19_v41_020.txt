ND scholars -weigh in on pope's remarks 
Faculty stress quote's context; Muslims denounce violence 
By MADDIE HANNA News Writer 
Since Pope Benedict XVI gave a speech one week ago that ignited controversy among vocal and violent segments of the Muslim world, the riots and protests have only accelerated. 
But at Notre Dame, the hope is for everything to slow down. Faculty experts say the pope's remarks -however insensitive -were taken out of context, and on Monday, Muslim mem­bers of the University commu­nity denounced the ongoing vio­lence. 
Benedict XVI spoke at the University of Regensburg in Germany last Tuesday on faith and reason at modern universi­ties, said R. Scott Appleby, director of the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies and an expert on religious violence. The pope quoted 14th century Byzantine emperor Manuel Paleologos II: "Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new, and there you will fmd things only evil and inhu­man, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached." 
"But he also quoted the Quran, which says there is no compulsion in religion," Appleby said. "This reference is in key with Benedict's previous remarks on Islam, in which he argues Islam is being betrayed by extremists who invoke vio­lence. Although the remarks were taken out of context, the

All spinach pulled due to E. coli outbreak 
By KATE ANTONACCI News Editor 
Across the country, over 1i 0 people have become ill and one person has died from an outbreak of E. coli 0157:H7 linked to fresh spinach -and Notre Dame is taking steps to make sure that the number does not increase on their watch. 
"This is an issue in every food service outlet and gro­cery store in North America," said David Prentkowski, Director of Food Services. 
Indiana is only one of 21 states to report E. coli cases linked to tainted spinach. Though Wisconsin has report­ed the most cases, the out­break is still cause for con­cern. 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a broad advisory to consumers on Sept. 14 to avoid spinach or any product containing spinach. Natural Selection Goods a San Juan Bautistia, Calif. company ­followed suit on Sept. 15 by issuing a "voluntary recall of every retain and foodservice product containing spinach with a 'Best if Used By Date' of Aug. 17 through Oct. 1. "' 
Following the announce­ments, Notre Dame Food Services took immediate steps to pull spinach from salad bars in the dining halls and from all other food locations on campus. 
"All uncooked spinach is in question," Prentkowski said.

the natural thlng regarding the newly opened hall of science: avoided .it like the plague. 
Lately though, I've been thlnking that I haven't had the right approach. Why shouldn't I go explore just because every­one inside the building can make potions out of substances that I can't even pro­nounce, especially since Jordan is appar­ently now the nicest building on earth except that hotel in Dubai that goes underwater? Sorry, but that one's still cooler. 
This has led me to the formulation of my new goal: enter every Notre Dame building by the time I graduate. 
I realize that this is not a standard "before I graduate goal for Notre Dame student [such as, say, graduating with honors, winning somethlng, making the men'slwomen's team of your choosing, or dating someone from the men'slwomen's team of your choosing] but I believe it's a good goal for a Notre Dame student to have. For starters, it might help combat the 'looking down at my shoes as I walk slowly towards class in weather condi­tions under which most states would give the ski patrol the day off tunnel vision that everyone on this campus suffers from between mid-November and, say, Easter. Not only would scouting out new buildings make each trip to class less monotonous, but everyone could find a new place to thaw out their fingers. 
Further, Notre Dame is a bigger cam­pus than most people give it credit for, and it is densely packed with interesting places. For instance, did you know that there are numerous restaurants and cafes hidden around campus, such as the Greenfield's in the Hesburgh Center or Cafe di Grasta in Grace Hall? There are others as well, and, as someone who is committed to eating every day, I plan to dine at each of them at least once. 
As a senior, I realize I don't have much time to complete my goal, which is more ambitious than what I first realized. With commencement being held on May 21, I have eight months and two days to get inside a lot of buildings, and truthfully, I have a long way to go. This university has 27 dorms, and in my first three-plus years here, I've only found my way into 19 ofthem. 
However, I have already made progress. Last Friday at 4:30, I attended a lecture in McKenna Hall, enabling myself to cross it off the list. Up until4:18 of that day, I did not know where McKenna Hall was, or even that Notre Dame had a McKenna Hall. Every day I'm learning. 
So, maybe the next time you are walk­ing to class and you hear the soloist play­ing by the open window at the top of the Crowley Hall of Music, walk upstairs and tell him/her that he/she is doing a good job. While you're there, look around, see what it's like inside. 
They did build it for a reason.

Man is happy with life at the top 
VIENNA, Austria -The world's tallest man says he's happy with his height but used to wish he were "normal." 
At 7 feet, 8.95 inches, Xi Shun, of Chifeng in China's Inner Mongolia, has held the world record as the tallest living man since January 15, 2005, according to London­based Guinness World Records Ltd. 
"Before I wanted to be normal, but now I like it," Xi Shun, a herdsman, said in an interview Sunday with The Associated Press on the sidelines of Vienna World Records Day. The event was open to anyone who wanted to set a world record -or trump one that already existed. 
Dressed in a traditional embroidered blue shirt, pants and brown sandals, Xi Shun, speaking through a translator, said he lives in a house built specifically for him.

Special to the Observer 
The Ufiiversity of Notre Dame's Reilly Center for Science, Technology and Values will spon­sor an international conference titled "The Commerce and Politics of Science" from Sept. 21 to 24 (Thursday to Sunday) at McKenna Hall. 
he conference will examine how commercial and political interests have shaped, and con­tinue to shape, scientific knowl­edge and practice. It also will consider whether one or another economic or political context is favorable or unfavorable to sci­ence and is more, or less, likely to produce "good science." 
Keynote speakers for the con­ference include Sheldon Krimsky, professor of urban and environ­mental policy and planning at Tufts University; Robert Berdahl, president of the Association of American Universities; and Philip Mirowski, Notre Dame's Carl E. Koch Professor of Economics and Policy Studies. 
The conference will feature sessions on "Democracy and the Commercialization of Science," "Commercialization and the Philosophy of Science," "Commerce, Politics, and Science in the United States and the European Union: Comparative Perspectives," "Commercialization and Technology Transfer in the University" and "Scholarly Duties and Private Interest Science." 
The conference has been organized in collaboration with the University of Bielefeld, Germany, to allow for an interna­tional dimension and regional comparisons. 
In addition to the Reilly Center, the conference is sponsored by Notre Dame's Nanovic Institute for European Studies and Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts. 
Established in 1985, the Reilly Center seeks to make a distinc­tive contribution to the humanis­tic understanding of science and technology. 
College recognizes alumnae achievements 
Humanistic studies majors mark anniversary 
By MANDl STIRONE News Writer 
Saint Mary's College Humanistic Studies Majors celebrated the concentra­tion's 50th anniversary this week, a milestone marked by lectures, presentations and an open discussion led by Professor Gail Mandell. 
The main purpose for the events -which started Sunday and ran all day Monday -was to celebrate the department, as well as the accomplishments of its alumnae, said Humanistic Studies department chair Philip Hicks. It was also a chance to bring together HUST alumnae and current students so they could learn from one another, Hick said. 
The program included more than 100 alumnae as well as current HUST majors. 
The alumnae ranged from SMC's most recent graduates in 2006 to some of the origi­nal Humanistic Studies majors from 1957. A few current HUST majors partic­ipated in the open discus­sion, as well as other events on campus. 
Mandell's open discussion Monday focused on the strengths and weaknesses of the program. 
Speakers included President Carol Ann Mooney, who spoke at lunchtime on Monday. Professor Miri Ruben also gave a Christian Culture Lecture entitled "Mary: From Jewish Maiden to Global Icon" late Sunday night in O'Laughlin Auditorium. 
Other speakers included Professor Gail Mandell, Professor Philip Hicks and various Humanistic Studies alumnae. The events were held in Stapleton Lounge, O'Laughlin Auditorium and other campus locations. 
The Humanistic Studies· major is a "study of western 
culture with special appreci­ation of Christian contribu­tions to the west," Hicks said. 
The major boasts small classes where students read and discuss what Hicks called "the great books." The intimate environment created by the selective major creates lifelong friendships, Hicks said. 
Currently there are 13 I-JUST majors graduating in 2007 and 15 graduating in 2008. The program is unique to Saint Mary's because it is the "only program that we know of in the United States that still is based on the educational ideas of Christopher Dawson," Hicks said. 
Dawson was a British his­torian who published a series of articles in Commonwealth magazine, starting in 1953. 
He emphasized Christian culture's influence in many fields of study. 
Originally named the Program for Christian Culture, the major began in fall 1956 with 13 students. In 1957, the program was renamed Humanistic Studies. 
Professor Bruno Schles­inger, who pushed for the creation of the major in 1956, recently retired after 60 years at Saint Mary's and 48 with the HUST program.

He did not mention any marshmallow-related ejec­tions from the stadium. 
Also, three individuals were arrested on campus by NDSP Saturday related to counterfeiting and theft, Director of Ticket Operations Josh Berlo said. 
The arrests came one week after undercover police arrested a man sell­ing counterfeit tickets on the southeast edge of cam­pus before the Notre Dame­Penn State game Sept. 9. 
"This is a joint effort between Notre Dame Security/Police, South Bend Police and what we learned at the Penn State game," Berlo said. 
"We were able to utilize that information ... to make three very successful arrests." 
Berlo did not elaborate on how the Sept. 9 arrest was connected to the latest ones, but said he expects charges to be filed by the St. Joseph County Prosecutor early this week. 
About 100 counterfeit tickets are linked to the arrested individuals, Berlo said. 
"We're going to keep our eyes out for counterfeits.... We have the tools in place to make future arrests if necessary," Berlo said. 
Johnson said when tickets are bought on the street, there is a "great risk" of the ticket being counterfeit. "People should be very cau­tious in buying tickets," he said. 
In addition, 14 people were issued trespass notices "banning them from campus property," most issued for urinating in a public place, Johnson said. Another man was issued a trespass notice for urinat­ing in the Stadium Lot. 

NDSP officers also arrest­ed one man for "operating while intoxicated" and one fl?.an for public intoxication near the Mason Support Service Building, Johnson said. 
One man was arrested for 

' public intoxication and pos­session of marijuana near the Stadium, where he returned later in the day after being ejected by ush­ers. An additional arrest was made near Hammes Mowbray Hall of a man who was publicly intoxicated and was observed taking a bike from a residence hall. "The bike, which was recovered by NDSP, was not registered nor reported stolen at this time," Johnson said. "Investigation of this case continues." Officers, most in uniform and "easily recognized as law enforcement officers," were present on campus and in parking lots to help maintain a "family friendly atmosphere" among tailgate gatherings and to enforce Indiana law, Johnson said. "This is not an undercover or covert operation," Johnson said. "NDSP will continue to work with other area police officials for future home football games Law enforcement officers will arrest underage drinkers on campus and at tailgate par­ties."

Nun asked forgivness for killers 
NAIROBI, Kenya -Sister Leonella, a nun who devoted her life to helping the sick in Africa, used to joke there was a bullet with her name engraved on it in Somalia. When the bullet came, she used her last breaths to for­give those responsible. 
"I forgive, I forgive," she whispered in her native Italian just before she died Sunday in the Somali capital, the Rev. Maloba Wesonga told The Associated Press at the nun's memori­al Mass in Nairobi on Monday. 
Sister Leonella's slaying raised concerns that she and other foreigners killed in Somalia recently are victims of growing Islamic radical­ism in the Horn of Africa country, where a hard-line Muslim militia has been expanding its reach. 
Bombings kill four Canadian soldiers 
KAFIR BAND, Afghanistan -Three bomb­ings killed at least 19 people across Afghanistan on Monday, including four Canadian soldiers in an attack that tested NATO's claim of success in driving insurgents from this volatile southern region. 
The deadliest attack, in the usually calm western city of llerat, killed 11 people and wounded 18 including the deputy police chief, officials said. Initially, officials said it was a suicide attack by a militant strapped with explosives and riding a motorbike. 
But Afghan President Hamid Karzai, speak­ing later Monday in New York where he was attending the U.N. General Assembly, said it was not a suicide attack as initial reports indi­cated. Karzai did not elaborate on how the attack did take place in his remarks to the Asia Society. 
"It was not a suicide attack as I know now," he said.

Bush faces UN disagreement 
President arrives at New York meeting with policy problems at home and abroad 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -President Bush faced disagreement Monday over how to con­front Iran's nuclear ambi­tions and skepticism about his approach to Iraq and the Middle East as world leaders gathered for the 
U.N. General Assembly meeting. 
Still, Bush was upbeat, focusing on his push for democratic change and first lady Laura Bush's call for governments to embrace literacy programs to improve lives. 
"We don't believe free­dom belongs only to the United States of America," Bush said at the White House Conference on Global Literacy hosted by his wife. "We believe that liberty is universal in its applications. We also believe strongly that as the world becomes more free, we'll see peace." 
Bush arrived in New York to attend the 61st session of the world body with poli­cy problems at home and abroad that have narrowed his room to maneuver on the international stage.

Like Rougeau, Appleby noted how quickly the news hit the Islamic world -and how quickly Muslims responded. 
"I think the pope underestimat­ed the power of his own words, given the growth of a strong Islamic network of response, a network that has becoming increasingly sophisticated in the last number of years," Appleby said. "Like Jews and Christians, Muslims are sensitive to the way they are portrayed publidy, espe­cially in the current political set­ting. 
"And the pope perhaps made the same miscalculation that many professors make -they can be too subtle for their own good." 
That subtlety, said theology pro­fessor Lawrence Cunningham, is what's important to consider when evaluating the pope's speech. 
"Leave it to the pope, who is a very good scholar," to include that particular quotation, Cunningham said. He labeled the remark "a small part of a big talk" and a "sound byte" that has been blown out of context. 
"Here's the ironical thing ­what was the reaction in part of the Muslim world after this talk? Violence," he said.

Witnesses tell of Hussein's atrocities 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD -A former Kurdish rebel testified Monday he tem­porarily lost his sight in a chemi­cal weapons attack by Saddam Hussein's forces nearly two decades ago. He removed his glasses so the court could see his swollen eyes. 
Karawan Abdellah said he still lives in "pain and suffering" from the March 1988 attack, when Iraqi warplanes raided Kurdish guerrilla positions in the village of Shanakhesiya in northern Iraq. 
After the initial airstrike, Iraq fired chemical weapons on the vil­lage, Abdellah said.

Before adjourning until Tuesday, the court heard from a second witness, Khunja Kaim Hassan, who testified that her husband went missing and her house was destroyed in the Anlal offensive. 
A defense lawyer challenged her testimony, saying her hus­band, Mahmoud Ilassan, died in 1985 not in 1988 as the widow testified. The chief judge said the court would verify the datn of her husband's death. 
Saddam is still awaiting a ver­dict on Oct. 16 in the first case against him -the 9-month-long trial over the killings of 148 Shiites in Dujail after a 1982 assassination attempt against him there. He and seven co-defen­dants could face the death penalty in that case.

Singer on trial for genocide lyrics 
Associated Press 
ARUSIIA, Tanzania -A renowned Hwandan singer went on trial Monday before a 
U.N. tribunal, accused of writ­ing lyrics that incited murders during the 1994 genocide in Hwanda. 
Simon Bikindi "chosn to use his fame to incite hatred," prosecutor Hassan Jallow said during opening statements before the International Criminal Tribunal for Hwanda. 
The sight of the singer on trial was unusual, but the key role of propaganda in the Hwandan genocide has been well-documented. In 2003, the 
U.N. tribunal convicted two broadcasters and a newspa­per editor of genocide, incite­ment to genoeide, crimes against humanity, and exter­mination and persecution because of information that was broadcast and printed. 
The organizers of the geno­cide that killed more than 500,000 people in 100 days used radio as a means of urg­ing 1-Iutu civilians to kill their Tutsi neighbors and direct the slaughter. 
"Between 1990 and 1994, Simon Bikindi composed, sang, recorded or distributed musical works extolling Hutu solidarity and accusing Tutsis of enslaving Hutus," the tribu­nal indictment stated. 
Jallow told The Associated Press that three of Bikindi's sqngs are at the heart of the trial, one of which calls on 1-Iutus to remember the sufTer­ing under the Tutsi monarchy. The others urge Hutus to remain united against the "Tutsi enemy" and to be vigi­lant. 
Bikindi, 52, has said he is innocent of the six counts of genocide and related charges. 
The genocide started hours after Rwandan President Juvenal Ilabyarimana's plane was mysteriously shot down over Kigali on April 6, 1994, as he returned home from peace talks with Tutsi-led rebels. 
Militants from the 1-Iutu eth­nic majority, known as intera­hamwe,, quickly set up road­blocks across Kigali and on April 7 began killing Tutsis and moderate Hutus. 
Bikindi is known for his work starting the Irindiro Ballet, famous for its blend of tribal singing and dancing. He also was an official in the Ministry of Youth and Sports in the 1980s. 
The U.N. tribunal, which does not impose the death penalty, has convicted 26 sus­pects and acquitted four. Trials are under way for 28 others.

IN BRIEF 
Home buyers use agressive tactics 
NEW YORK -Not so long ago, home sellers used aggressive tactics to squeeze every last bit of profit from their home sales. Now that home sales are weakening, buyers have taken a page from the sellers' playbook, demanding everything from new appliances to no closing costs to upfront cash to get the deal done. 
In some cases, what they are doing is down and dirty -sellers have been asked to pay off buyer's credit-card debt, cover costs of the buyer's current home or even pay for the buyer's commuting costs from the new home. 
This kind of gamesmanship allows buyers to get the most for their money. It also reveals that the housing market's ugly side may be here to stay. 
The residential real estate market is cooling from its record-setting pace. New home sales are projected to fall about 16 percent in 2006, and existing home sales are forecast to dip 7.6 per­cent, according to the National Association of Realtors. Growth in home prices is expected to be minimal, coming in at less than 3 percent in 2006 and 2007. 
Media ownership study suppressed 
WASHINGTON -Sen. Barbara Boxer on Monday made public a second Federal Communications Commission study on media ownership that she says was shelved by agency officials. 
The FCC Media Bureau report analyzes the impact of deregulation in the radio industry. The report states that from March 1996 through March 2003, the number of commer­cial radio stations on the air rose 5. 9 percent while the number of station owners fell 35 percent. 
The intense concentration of ownership fol­lowed a 1996 rewrite of telecommunications law that eliminated a 40-station national own­ership cap. 
The report, apparently prepared in 2003, was never made public, nor have any similar analyses followed, despite the fact that radio industry reports were released in 1998, 2001 and 2002, said Boxer, D-Calif. 
Last week. Boxer released a draft of another FCC study, this one showing that media con­solidation leads to less local TV news cover­age.

Corporate leaders miss lessons 
Hewlitt-Packard scandal is the latest example ofcompanies playing the blame game

NEW YORK -Things go right in corporate America, and companies are quick to tout how dif­ferentiation gives them the competitive edge. Things go wrong, and suddenly they say they are just fol­lowing the pack.

The station will begin broad­casting its programming on campus cable channel 53 at

Senior Adam Fairholm, who is NDtv's executive director, said he hopes the event brings a greater understanding of the University's "for students, by students" television sta­tion. 
NDtv began in 2002 as a project of the Film, Television and Theatre department as a bi-weekly, 30-minute variety show. 
Since then, it has grown into a multi-show station airing news, sports, comedy and entertainment review pro­grams. Previously, NDtv was broadcast on campus cable and was only available in dorm social spaces and other campus buildings.

issues of ethics in business. The lecture was entitled "What's Hot in Corporate Ethics." 
Thomas-Moore outlined the recent factors that have caused executives worldwide to clamor for increased transparency and accounta­bility in their businesses. 
The federal government introduced corporate sen­tencing guidelines in 1991, which were "the first com­prehensive set of self-polic­ing guidelines for compa­nies," Thomas-Moore said. 
The government amended the guidelines in 2004 following the wave of cor­
The New York Stock Exchange's new standards of corporate gover­nance derived from high-pro­file corruption cases, she said. Additionally, "the Securities and Exchange Commission now requires corporations to have a code of ethics which is posted on their webpage," Thomas­Moore said. 
Perhaps the legal corner­stone of the movement for ethics in business was the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which set or enhanced existing standards of corporate gov­ernance and ethics in 2002. 
Thomas-Moore said the issues companies face regarding business ethics are not unique in history but mirror similar questions that have arisen in the past, most notably after the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. 
"Ethics have not changed, and I don't think they ever will," she said, but· noted that specific concerns may differ by circumstance. 
Show (a late night comedy and interview show) and The Final Cut (an entertainment review program) -all of which will air weekly new episodes. 
In addition to the new mate­rial from this season, pro­gramming from the past three seasons will air during the day. 
"With comedy and enter­tainment, there is a backlog of material that hasn't been seen [by the majority of students]," Fairholm said. 
The station also will offer advertisement opportunities for campus-related events and organizations this year. Both the programs and commer­cials will remain Notre Dame­centered, Fairholm said. 
"A lot of college stations aren't university-specific," Fairholm said. "The priority for us is Notre Dame events." 
Fairholm is proud of the sta­tion's focus on and coverage of campus events. 
"For a college [organization] as young as we are, we have wide coverage on everything Notre Dame," Fairholm said. 
In the four years since its 
Thomas-Moore enumerated key issues that face ethics officers and businesses today. One set of issues targets companies working interna­tionally. 
"If a company does busi­ness in certain countries, [different ethical standards are] going to change their ethics program," she said. 
In France, for example, pri­vacy laws prohibit the use of hotlines to report violations of a company's code of ethics. Such hotlines are required by law in the United States. 
"This is not a result of the regulations, really. This is a result of globalization," Thomas-Moore said.

Additionally, she said, cor­porations are turning to out­side sources to evaluate their practices and codes of ethics, as well for assistance in implementing new technolo­gies such as those involved in online training programs. 
"If you're .interested in a consulting career, this is an area that's growing like crazy," she said. 
Thomas-Moore also empha­sized the importance of a code of ethics focused global­ly, continuously under review and in line with employee training programs. 
In today's workplace, "hav­ing a code of ethics is not enough," she said. "Having the rules just doesn't cut it." 
To illustrate her point, Thomas-Moore provided examples from her own com­pany's ethics training pro­gram. Weyerhaeuser is a start, NDtv has nourished in both coverage and in partici­pation. With only about 14 students in 2002, NDtv now works with about 90 students. 
"Each show has its own crew," Fairholm said, adding that students are involved in every aspect of production. "We do all of our own work." 
"We have a sort of open door policy," NDtv News director Melinda Leonard said. "Students can get involved as much and as often as they want to." 
The station's leaders are hoping Wednesday's event and the wider availability of NDtv dorm rooms will increase awareness of the stu­dent-run station. 
"The optimal reaction, right now, is a reaction," said Fairholm, noting that most students are currently unaware of what NDtv offers. 
"Having the student body know about NDtv and making it a part of campus media" is a primary goal of the station's fourth season.. Fairholm said.

Among the persons reported ill, 53 percent were hospital­ized, 16 percent developed a type of kidney failure and an adult in Wisconsin died. 75 per­cent of the cases were female and 5 percent were children under 5 years old, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

this, national communications make us aware of the issue so that we can react as quickly as possible," Prentkowski said. 
The recent outbreak is the latest in a string of "19 food­poisoning outbreaks since 1995" linked to lettuce and spinach, the AP reported.

Though no cases have been reported on campus, there has been one case reported in the county, Prentkowski said, though it is not affiliated with Notre Dame. 
Notre Dame has strict sanita­tion and food handling proce­dures to try to avoid such situa­tions. To provide program assurance, Prentkowski said the University also has a safety manager on staff. 
Prentkowski said E. coli is no more prevalent in spinach than it is a variety of fruits and veg­etables.

NATO victory spurs bombing 
4 Canadian soldiers and at least 15 Afghans killed Monday 
HUNGARY 

Violence follow-s anti­govermnent protests 

Associated Press 
KAFIR BAND -Three bomb­ings killed at least 19 people across Afghanistan on Monday, including four Canadian soldiers in an attack that tested NATO's claim of success in driving insur­gents from this volatile southern region. 
The deadliest attack, in the usu­ally calm western city of Herat, killed 11 people and wounded 18 including the deputy police chief, officials said. Initially, officials said it was a suicide attack by a mili­tant strapped with explosives and riding a motorbike. 
But Afghan President Hamid Karzai, speaking later Monday in New York where he was attend­ing the U.N. General Assembly, said it was not a suicide attack as initial reports indicated. Karzai did not elaborate on how the attack did take place in his remarks to the Asia Society. 
"It was not a suicide attack as I know now," he said. 
A suicide car bombing in the capital Kabul killed at least four policemen and wounded one offi­cer and 10 civilians. 
Afghanistan has been suffering the heaviest insurgent attacks since the Taliban was toppled in late 2001, and the bombings came a day after NATO ended a two-week offensive against Taliban fighters in this region that the commander called a "signifi­cant success." 
"It does appear that they are resorting to these despicable tac­tics after the pressure we have them under in their strongholds," a NATO spokesman, Maj. Luke Knittig, said in Kabul. 
In Ottawa, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper praised the lost soldiers. 
"It's a tough mission, but the men and women of the Canadian Forces sign on for tough missions if they know they can do good in the world -that's what they're doing and ... they have the absolutely unwavering support of their government," he said. 
NATO said 25 civilians also were wounded in the blast in Kafu Band, a clutch of mud-brick homes surrounded by grape and pomegranate orchards. 
"Fifty to 60 soldiers were patrolling on the main street when a man on a bicycle stopped and blew himself up near the forces," said Fazel Mohammed, a farmer who lives near the blast site. 
The explosion tore through the Canadian patrol, shredding uni­forms and military equipment. Blood soaked into the dusty road, and the bomber's legs ended up near a gold-colored military patch torn from a soldier's uniform. 
Four helicopters hovered over the village, and at least two land­ed to retrieve the wounded and dead soldiers, Mohammed said. 
"This attack amounts to a seri­ous violation of international humanitarian law," said Tom Koenigs, the top U.N. official in Afghanistan. 
The commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. David Richards, said the attack took place as Canadian troops were arranging aid, reconstruction and development for villagers in the district, which suffered heavy damage during the NATO offen­sive. 
At least 36 Canadian soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan since 2002. Five died during Operation Medusa, in which NATO estimated it killed at least 510 insurgents with airstrikes and ground assaults. 
On Sunday, Richards called Operation Medusa a success and said NATO had reclaimed crucial territory from the Taliban. 
Most of the village's 25 families fled the fighting and only the des­perately poor stayed behind, Mohammed said. 
"Taliban were in this village before, but now there are fewer remaining," said another villager, shopkeeper Jan Mohammed. "But if you kill 100 or 1,000 Taliban, another 1,000 will come to con­tinue the fighting." 
Most of the recent surge in vio­lence has occurred in southern provinces. 
NATO commanders say they need 2,500 more soldiers, plus greater air support, to crush the Taliban threat more quickly. 
Reacting to the recent spree of western attacks, Afghan and for­eign troops launched an opera­tion Monday in Farah, where a dozen Taliban and police were killed by insurgent raids last week. 
Operation Wyconda Pincer involves Afghan soldiers and police along with U.S., Italian and Spanish troops, NATO said. 
"This operation is in response to a growing number of terrorist acts that have occurred in recent weeks," said Cdr. Michael Horan, a NATO official in Farah.

BUDAPEST -Protesters clashed with police and stormed the headquarters of state television early Tuesday, responding with violence to a leaked recording that caught Hungary's prime minister admitting the government "lied morning, evening and night" about the economy. 
Rescue services said at least 50 people were injured as police fired tear gas and water cannon at rock-throwing pro­testers, who have been demanding the government resign. 
The violence followed a mainly peaceful demonstration that began a day earlier out­side parliament, after a record­ing made in May was leaked to local media. On it, Socialist Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany admitted officials lied about government finances to win April's elections. 
Despite the surge in violence involving dozens of the protest­ers, Gyurcsany said that he had no plans to resign. 
Socialist members of parlia­ment voted unanimously to support him and the govern­ment called for an emergency session of the cabinet for Tuesday morning. 
As the crowd grew by Monday night to more than 10,000, according to an esti­mate by MTI, several hundred broke away and marched over to the nearby headquarters of state television, demanding to deliver a statement in a live broadcast. 
While most of demonstrators watched, a few dozen broke through police lines and into the TV headquarters. 
Police tried to disperse them with water cannon sprays but the truck was quickly disabled by the rioters, some of whom escorted the police officers operating the vehicle to safety. Several cars near the TV build­ing were set on fire, their flames scorching the building. 
Adding spice to the scandal, Gyurcsany's comments were full of crude remarks and called into doubt the abilities of some of Hungary's most respected economic experts. 
"We screwed up. Not a little, a lot," Gyurcsany was heard saying. "No European country has done something as bone­headed as we have." 

The prime minister also told colleagues the government needed to end its duplicitous ways. 
"I almost died when for a year and a half we had to pre­tend we were governing. Instead, we lied morning, evening and night. I don't want to do this anymore," he told his fellow Socialists. 
Confronted with initial excerpts of the 25-minute recording, which Hungarian state radio posted on its Web site Sunday, Gyurcsany not only acknowledged their authenticity but seemed relieved they had been made public -leading to speculation that the leak came from sources close to him. 
"It deflates pent-up tensions regarding the reforms and ... can be used to support the gov­ernment's position that they are urgent and inevitable," said political analyst Zoltan Kiszelly. 
Gyurcsany appeared on two live television shows Sunday night, trying to turn the focus of the debate away from his government and into a wider discussion about the failings of Hungary's political elite since the 1990 end of communism. 
He also defended his foul language, saying it had been used in the context of a meet­ing of friends and colleagues and that he was proud of his "passionate speech." 
The real issue in Hungarian politics today is not who lied and when, but who is able to put an end to this ... who can face up to the lies and half­truths of the past 16 years," Gyurcsany wrote in a Sunday night entry of his blog, intro­ducing a lengthy transcript of his May speech. 
"The lies are the sins of the whole Hungarian political elite." 
But on Monday the political mood was against Gyurcsany. Opposition parties demanded his resignation, while President Laszlo Solyom chastised the prime minister for "knowingly" jeopardizing people's faith in democracy and asked Gyurcsany to publicly recog­nize his error. 
SWEDEN 
Leader resigns after 12 years 
Associated Press 
STOCKHOLM Prime Minister Goran Persson submit­ted his resignation Monday fol­lowing the defeat of his Social Democrats in weekend elections, an outcome that ended 12 years of leftist rule. 
With 99.7 percent of districts counted, the four-party opposi­tion alliance led by Fredrik Reinfeldt had 48.1 percent of the votes, compared with 46.2 per­cent for the Social Democrats and their two supporting parties. 
The victorious center-right alliance is promising only to tin­ker with the welfare state -but some believe their efforts toward lower taxes and more flexible labor rules could herald a deeper shift toward market liberaliza­tion. 
"This is a historic change for Sweden, it's a real break­through," said Anna Maria Corazza Bildt, a local Moderate politician and wife of former con­servative Prime Minister Carl Bildt. "People were tired of the Social Democrats." 
The vote's big winner was prime minister-designate Reinfeldt, whose Moderate Party rebounded strongly from a weak result in 2002. 
Reinfeldt, 41, will form a coali­tion government backed by a parliamentary majority of 178 
· seats in the 349-member Riksdag. He declined to say how the four parties would divvy up Cabinet posts after their first talks Monday. The center-right alliance pledged moderate tax cuts, espe­cially for low-income families, trimming unemployment benefits and selling off state assets in big companies. But experts expected Sweden's overall tax pressure to remain high and did not expect the big system change that Persson warned of in the elec­tion.

Over the past few weeks, a number of readers have submitted letters to The Observer regarding their opinions on whether or not Muslims are "civilized" and how the West should interact with the Muslim world. Since September 11th, Americans have exhibited a wide range of thoughts on the matter, from Moveon.org's 2001 letter of opposition to the war against the Taliban, to random acts of hatred against patriotic Muslims in the United States. As Notre Dame students and educated citizens, we must demarcate the distinction between the religion of Islam and the political ideology of Islamism, particu­larly radical Islamism. Understanding this difference and the underpinnings of Islamism is critically important to the determination of American strategy in the War on Terror. 
The religion of Islam, as with other major world religions, contains diverse interpretations and schools of thought. Since the 2003 liberation of Iraq, most Americans have heard of the Shi' a and Sunni branches of Islam, but there are also a number of subgroups within Shi'a and Sunni Islam. These include Progressive Islam (also known as Ijtihadism), Wahhabism and Sufism. One of these schools, Wahhabism -com­monly referred to as Islamic fundamen­talism in the West -has provided most of the adherents to radical Islamism, which uses an interpretation of Islam from the first three generations after Muhammad as the foundation for a dis­tinct political ideology. 
According to Professor Bassam Tibi of Gottingen University, "Islamic funda­mentalists challenge and undermine the secular order of the body politic and aim to replace it by a divine order, the so­called hakimiyyat Allah. The order they envisage is not simply a domestic one, 

Jonathan Klingler 
Forward the Revolution 
but the foundation for the new world order they expect to mount in place of the existing one." Radical Islamists, such as Sayyid Qutb and Sayyid Abul A'la Maududi, have the goal of creating a global Islamic state and a universal Islamic social order which would super­sede the personal religious adherence of individuals. In addition, radical Islamism is similar to Communism and Nazism in the sense that all three ide­ologies separate society into "desirable" and "undesirable" groups, based on class, race or religion, respectively. Islamism is a coherent political ideology which is quite distinct from Islam itself, and its followers are committed to a goal which cannot be fulfilled as long as liberalism thrives inthe United States or anywhere else in the world. 
According to Gilles Kepel, author of ''Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam," radical Islamism began its ascent in the early 1970s with the demise of Arab nationalism as the dominant ideology in the Muslim world. At this time, the region experienced a rapid increase in the number of educated and unem­ployed young people alongside growing middle class frustration with the control that the military or royal families had over economic opportunity in many Middle Eastern states. The ideas of Islamist intellectuals such as Qutb and Maududi offered the poor the possibility of social revolution, and the middle classes the promise of seizing economic control from the ruling elite. 
The continuing attraction of Islamism to the marginalized elements of the Middle East is based on the failure of most Arab states to create effective political structures, build broad-based economies and foster technological innovation. Newsweek columnist Fareed Zakaria wrote that "the gulf govern­ments offered their people a bargain: we will bribe you with wealth, but in return let us stay in power. It was the inverse slogan of the American revolu­tion -no taxation, but no representa­tion either." As long as the governments of the Middle East operate by this bar­gain, the soil will be rich for Islamism to take root and terrorism will bloom. 
Without the components of liberalism implemented in Middle Eastern nations, Islamism will continue to be an influen­tial factor in budding democracies if not the dominant ideology. As Zakaria writes, "It turns out that modernization takes more than strongmen and oil money. Importing foreign stuff­Cadillacs, Gulfstreams and McDonald's -is easy. Importing the inner stuffings of modern society -a free market, political parties, accountability and the rule of law-is difficult and danger­ous." Liberal democracies have been forced into fighting an ideological war with Islamist terrorism, as the current administration has currently stated, unfortunately it will not be won by hold­ing elections alone but by fostering the foundations of liberalism abroad. 
According to experts like Tibi, Kepel and Zakaria, the people of the Middle East desire economic opportunity, gov­ernmental accountability and open soci­eties, and their frustrations have led many to Islamism as a last resort. Liberalism has accomplished these things for such diverse societies as Japan, India, Germany and Costa Rica, and can do so in Iraq, Afghanistan and the greater Middle East if the world's liberal democracies have the will to sup­port the creation of liberal institutions throughout the Arab world. American measures which foster open markets, a free press and the development of strong political institutions in currently autocratic states will be far more suc­cessful in combating Islamist terrorism than by establishing elections alone.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Papal apology unnecessary 
I question whether the Muslim world merited an apology from Pope Benedict for quoting from an ancient Byzantine emperor. After all, Muslim leaders around the world dis­torted the larger message he sought to communicate. With his speech in Germany, Benedict set out to condemn reli­giously motivated violence. His unmistakable message was a summons to interreligious dialogue based on reason, respect and reconciliation. 
One may wonder if Benedict will demand an apology from the Muslim cleric who compared him to Hitler, a comparison so ludicrous as to be dismissed with the con­tempt it so richly deserves. Still another Muslim cleric (Sheik Abubakar Hassan Malin), referring to the Pope, was quoted in Sunday's New York Times as saying: "Whoever offends our Prophet Mohammed should be killed on the spot." And sure enough, apparently in response to the Sheik's entreaty, an Italian missionary nun was dutifully killed on the spot in Somalia. Who in the Muslim world will apologize for this atrocity? 
One can only wonder why Muslim leaders capable of mobilizing such anger at Benedict for a mere literary lapse seem to mute their voices when confronted with religiously motivated violence in their own backyards. Where are the Muslim voices of outrage against suicide bombers who indiscriminately murder men, women and children, against calls for the destruction of Israel, against radical clerics who preach a religious duty to kill Americans and other "infidels," against Shiites and Sunnis who butcher each other on the streets of Baghdad and against those Muslims who speak generally in the lan­guage of revenge and retribution, all in the name of Allah? 
Their silence is deafening.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Quality of life matters 
No piece of student writing has ever made me sadder than the column "Quality of Work Matters" which appeared in the Sept. 11 edition of The Observer. The author attacks the idea of wages being determined by the govern­ment rather than by employers and employees in a "free market." His clear intention is to discredit the Campus Labor Action Project, a collaborative movement among Notre Dame students, staff and faculty to advocate for a fair wage for University employees. The Project is based on the idea that without collective action to ensure just compen­sation, laborers have little power vis-a­vis their employer. 
The author supports his argument with the fantasy that "there is an inti­mate connection between the value one produces and the wage one is paid." While this may hold true in perfect­world neoclassical economic models, where wages are determined by the marginal product of labor, there are myriad real-world examples to discredit this na"ive assertion. For example, gar­ment workers stitching identical types of clothing in Mexico and the United States are paid very different wages, even though their products are sold for the same prices in the same markets. Critics may argue that this just reflects different levels of productivity between Mexican and American workers, but it is clear that wages paid to workers depend on a lot more than the value of what they produce. Historical conditions of a coun­try, structural conditions of an industry and the kind of alternative forms of employment for workers all contribute to determining wage levels. 
Adam Smith's labor theory of value argues that a link exists between the labor inputs of a commodity and the value of that commodity on the market. Even if the labor theory of value is accepted as valid, it does not automati­cally support the assertion that wages are intimately connected to the value of one's work. Within the capitalist system, those who own the means of production earn a profit through the appropriation of a portion of their workers' labor. It is in every capitalist's best interests to pay as low as wage as possible so as to cap­ture the highest profits. There is not an intimate connection between the value of a laborer's production and the wage paid for that labor. Rather than pay workers for the full value of their labor, employers have every incentive to squeeze profits out of their workers. 
Low wages may reflect an unfortunate abundance of low-skilled labor on the market. However, an excess labor supply does not justify paying wages so low that those wages cannot sustain the workers earning them, no matter what intro eco­nomics textbooks may say. If a flood of labor came onto the market in South Bend, would the inherent worth of any individual's work suddenly decrease? Should we value an individual less because there are others who could do the same work?. 
Consider college graduates who look for jobs in May. The influx of new grads into the market in the spring certainly pushes wages down. However, this does­n't mean that anyone has become less productive or inherently worth less. 
If market-determined wages are so low that workers can't afford to raise a family, this sends a clear signal to those workers. It tells them that their worth is so low that they don't deserve to even live in the community. Krueger and Card found that when workers earning low wages had their wages raised, their pro­ductivity rose and employment actually increased (Foundation for Economic Education, 1999). With this in mind, it is unfortunate that the author of "Quality of Work Matters" scoffs at any non-mar­ket mechanism for increasing wages. In addition, he asserts that raising wages to the minimum level of$12.10 per hour would represent an increase in wages of over 100 percent. His assumption that workers are starting from $5.15 is sim­ply wrong. Many workers earn $8-10 per hour, and the increase to $12.10 would likely not have the elasticity effects he claims. 
The author bashes minimum wage laws as an "insult to human dignity," arguing that most low-level jobs do not produce much of value and should therefore not be paid much. Instead of turning to the "arbitrary" social policy of a minimum wage, he proclaims, workers should seek "honestly negotiated com­pensation" for their work. He celebrates the capitalist system of voluntary con­tracts while conveniently ignoring the problems of inequality and injustice within capitalism. In reality, the unequal power relationships between workers and employers mean that workers rarely have the means to negotiate honest com­pensation without organizations like labor unions or the Campus Labor Action Project to contribute to collective action. 
The University of Notre Dame is one of the best employers around. The University is certainly doing a lot of things right in looking after its workers. This does not mean it is perfect, though. If the University has the resources to set up a special taskforce to investigate something like off-campus crime, it must have the resources to examine the living wage issue seriously. Until then, I hope it will not be swayed by the myth that any "artificial" increase in wages will auto­matically be a net bad for her workers and for the University.

Fan etiquette questioned in loss 
Student section surpasses norm 
I'd like to know what area of the senior section Megan ~aulsen was in this past Saturday, but I sure don't remember seeing a mass exodus of "senior after sen­ior leaving the game before half­time," or a near silent student section that she claims existed for "the majority of the game." Yes, I did observe a handful of seniors leaving around the forth quarter. And yes, I did notice our section, as well as myself, grow quieter as the game wore on. However, the senior section did not paint the picture of apathy that Paulsen would like people to believe. 
I was very fortunate to have my family come in for the game and be able to have my sister, who attends Auburn, in the stu­dent section. I wanted to show my family, especially my sister, what Notre Dame football was all about, and the unique experi­ence that is our senior section. In the fourth quarter, while some of the seniors left, my sister was shocked the majority of us still remained, saying: "At Auburn, nearly all of the students would have left a long time ago." The other members of my family where also impressed that the majority of us still remained to support our team. 
Paulsen seems to forget the majority of seniors that still stayed for the game, or perhaps she confused us all with the thousands upon thousands of Notre Dame fans outside the stu­dent section that left early. She also seems to forget that our stu-
Not fans' best showing 


dropped passes or missed tackles. As a lifelong Notre Dame fan, I love to believe that our team and coaches are god-like creatures, but they are nonetheless mere mortals, capable of human error. 
Brady Quinn is one of the best quarterbacks Notre Dame has ever had, but he is not, as is no one, perfect. Although I'm positive Evan Sharpley is a fme quarterback, to make a com­ment that Brady should be sitting is just asinine. I challenge anyone in the stands who thinks they can do better to put on a helmet and pads and show the 80,000-plus fans that you are. 
Finally, your job as a Notre Dame fan is to cheer for our football team, through good times and bad. When you walk into that stadium, wearing Notre Dame attire, you are represent­ing the entire University fan base. At the Penn State pep rally, Tom Zbikowski got the crowd fired up by exclaiming that the media does not feel that we, the fans, are loud enough and challenged us to prove them wrong. Until last Saturday, I defended the Notre Dame fan base. Now, however, I must change my tune. Although I realize there is still a large number of fans who proudly and greatly support the team, the few "fair-weather" fans in the stadi­um only weakened our argument that we are one of the best fan bases. 
Whether it was fans complaining or students leaving early, Saturday was not the fans' best showing. Thus, as a Notre Dame student and a proud supporter of Irish Football, I challenge the alumni, the students and all those who claim to be Notre Dame fans, to actually be fans when Purdue comes here on Sept. 30. I hope for few complaints and pray that our fans will stay until the end. Please show our team the utmost respect and support. The players deserve it.

FASHION SPOTLIGHT 
'Olympus fashion week' features new looks 
Designers unveil spring couture in downtown New York 



Anna Sui's spring collection reflected the movement towards more organic design.

Scene Writer 

Twice a year, the city of New York brings together the world's leading fashion designers for seven days of full-on fashion festivities. Think of fashion week as the "Super Bowl" of American fashion. It's an opportuni­ty for designers to unveil their cre­ations before the arrival of each fall and spring season. Olympus Fashion Week, named for its sponsor, is held each time in the heart of Midtown Manhattan. Enormous white tents fill the lawn of Bryant Park, which is conveniently located near Vogue's Times Square headquarters. 
Access to every show is exclusive and comes by invitation only. Invitees generally include journalist and buyers or celebrities and socialites. Fortunately for non-A-list fashionistas, previews of the collec­tions are posted via magazine web­sites such as style.com and elle.com. While some designers have begun to take the non-traditional route of showroom displays, most still prefer the excitement of runway shows. 
Most fashion enthusiasts will find Marc Jacobs to be one of the most impressive and original runways. Not only was his catwalk construct­ed to look something like that of a freshly mowed spring lawn, but his clothes were the embodiment of spring -playful and lively. Although the use of pastel polka dots and stripes is typical, his eye for layering makes it look far from traditionaL Fans of the designer should preview his larger collection over the smaller "Marc by Marc" collection. While Jacobs' feature collection is substan­tially pricier, it is considerably more innovative. 
Vera Wang's show proved to be another exceptional display. Attempting layers in a different way, she constructed eye-catching ensembles with translucent layers and original shapes. The unity of delicate fabrics and richly romantic colors was the epitome of elegance. 
This year's Spring 2007 collections featured a general aura of female independence and youthful ele­gance. Modest yet distinctly femi­nine clothing left much to the imagi­nation as nothing was particularly fQrm fitting. Liberation for the aver­age woman came at last, as design­ers constructed organic, non-restric­tive pieces flattering to most shapes and sizes. Romantic details paired with structured basics and a punk­like edge modernized previous run­away looks. 
Some aspects of spring came with little novelty, as -surprise, surprise -whites pervaded the looks for 2007. Keeping things clean cut, black and white was an obvious combination choice for designers such as Vena Cava and Luella. There also appeared to be a collec­tive use of white with metallic shades of gold and platinum. The most noticeable examples of this look was presented in the Ralph Lauren show. Metallic brocade skirts and slim cropped pants could easily translate from early day to evening. 
Other color palettes included muted tones of creams and grey or soft pastels like the soft canary yel­low used throughout Alice Roi's col­lection. Shorts as well remained an obvious spring staple, but "hot pant" opponents could rejoice over the variety of lengths and sizes. Taken long or short, designers frequently implemented cuffs to create the impression of maturity. 
Other commonly used details included the use of worldly prints and ruffies. Necklines were general­ly s.cooped as opposed to collared, and waistlines were generally tied as opposed to belted. Pants moved from pencil thin to wide-leg linen, while high-waisted trousers were styled with silk blouses. 
Jumpers, rompers and frocks translated from fall, while knee­length pleats created a new look for spring. Tent dresses were paired with lanky .cardigans, and volume remains critical as bubble skirts stuck around for one more season. Finally, feminine ensembles created a dancer-like elegance, and layering remained the mark of fashion know­how. 
The excitement from fashion week is far from over. Beginning next month, magazines will move away from fall fashions to showcase spring collections and trends. Winter has yet to arrive, but with last week's fashion festivities, who can help but look forward to the upcom­ing spring?

Ratner weakens trilogy with final chapter

Hollywood producers usually stick to and exploit the adage of not having enough of a good thing. In the case of "X-Men: The Last Stand" ("X3"), producers may have changed the adage entirely -"You can't have enough of something that used to be good, so long as it makes money." 
A disappointing third act to a promising comic book series, the "X3" DVD fails to deliver in almost every aspect. This begins with the film itself, which is directed by Brett Ratner ("Rush Hour," "Red Dragon"). Ratner took over the series from the direc­tor of the first two X-Men films, Bryan Singer, who left to direct "Superman Returns." Unfortunately, the decision to hire Ratner turned out to be a step in the wrong direction and greatly impacted the film. 
"X3" follows the Marvel Comics mutants Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry) and Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) as they grapple with a newly discovered cure for mutation. The implications this stirs up cause their enemy, Magneto (Ian McKellan), to begin a war over the possible eradication of all mutants. 
This war pits mutants and humans against each other in a typical "fight to the seems like it's trying to emulate a poor Broadway musical. 

In other words, everything here is too over the top, lacking any genuine sense or subtlety that should be present in a film. This appears to be part of the reason why "X3," in spite of earning $445 million worldwide, was still viewed as a massive underachievement. 
Perhaps due to the poor quality of the film, but more likely because of the film's tepid reception in theaters, the rest of the materials on the "X3" DVD are under­whelming. 
For dedicated fans, a director's commen­tary provides interesting tidbits of informa­tion, but items like these do not usually impress the masses. Deleted scenes and three alternate endings fill out the meager offering of special features and make for a disappointing DVD release. 
Not surprisingly, the end of "X-Men: The Last Stand" leaves open the possibility for more sequels and prequels. Hollywood pro­ducers seem to want more of what has now, thanks to a poor third film and poorer DVD, become a bad thing. 
Time will tell if the X-Men series can ­regain its balance and stand tall once more.

death" epic battle of good against evil. The special effects here and in other large scenes are impressive and shine as one of the few bright spots of the movie. The visu­al scope of Ratner's movie certainly does not lack imagination. 
Unfortunately, the rest of Ratner's film fails to live up to the lofty expectations placed upon it. "X3" has a complicated plot that relies heavily on prior knowledge of the previous "X-Men" movies. Additionally, many new mutant characters from the comic books are introduced and integrated into the "X-Men" universe. However, a 104­minute runtime does not help either of these causes. 
The plot ends up becoming too convolut­ed to follow, and the overabundance of characters means that no single mutant can have enough screen time to display emotion or character growth. This is espe­cially true for main characters Wolverine and Storm. 
In addition to their paltry screen time, Berry and Jackman suffer from poor direc­tion from Ratner and too often seem forced to spew out corny cliches and one-liners. In effect, they take several steps backwards from the character arcs they displayed in the first two movies. 
Other characters like the villain Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), who are arguably more interesting than many of the new mutants, 
are completely

DVD REVIEW 
'Lake House' leaves audiences unsatisfied 
distance romance that knows no barriers, but it is unsuccessful in this attempt. The glass lake house represents the emptiness and isolation in the protagonists' lives, but it could also represent the emptiness of the movie. Something is amiss, and it very well may be the characters themselves. Alex and Kate are such sad, morose human beings that it's difficult to see why they are attract­ed to each other. Perhaps it's best that they fall in love through letter-writing because if they appeared to each other face to face, they would be thoroughly depressed after a few minutes of conversation. Smiles are rare and laughter is non-existent. The char­acters lack the chemistry that would be imperative for a normal relationship, but fortunately for them, this deficiency is dis­guised in flowery language and moving anecdotes. 
The DVD extras are sparse, with five deleted scenes, outtakes and a the­atrical trailer. Clearly a box office bomb, producers wasted no time making the DVD anything special. However, an expla­nation of what led Bullock and Reeves to make this movie, out of all othPrs, 
would have been worthwhile. 
Truth be told, the movie would not be as disappointing if it had starred other actors. This Bullock-Reeves reunion appeared out of thin air and did not pack the same hype 
By CASSIE BELEK 
Assistant Scene Editor 
Bombs on buses equal movie magic for Sandra Bullock and· Keanu Reeves. Houses on lakes do not. In the duo's follow-up to 1994's thriller "Speed," the two fail to recre­ate the chemistry from their electrifying bus-ride and instead float through a melan­choly romance with mind-numbing plot twists and a shared canine. 
Argentinean director Alejandro Agresti cannot be blamed for Reeve.s' typical wood­en performance, but the movie itself defies all logic of the time-space continuum. Kate (Bullock) is a lonely doctor living in 2006. Alex (Reeves) is a lonely architect living in 2004. They both live in the same glass lake house. Through the intervention of a magi­cal mailbox of love and the aforementioned dog they 
apparently share, the two begin a correspon­dence and form an emo­tional bond as they empathize with the other's mis­

ery. This bond turns to love, but it seems impossible that the two will ever meet. Throw in a plot twist here and there, and all logic collapses. Get past this, and the film can be enjoyable. 
"The Lake House" aims to be a true long-as its predecessor did. Naturally, no one was expecting to recapture the glory of "Speed," especially with a straight-up romance, but the fact that it is Bullock and Reeves in this movie sets it up for an even bigger fall. The pair would have been wiser to choose a vehicle similar to that of "Speed," but the damage is now done and it is doubtful that the two will act together again after this failure. 

Even with the lack of chemistry and absence of logic, "The Lake House" has potential to be saved. However, a pre­dictable ending coupled with an impossible plot dooms the movie from the beginning. But the glass lake house Ls pretty to look at, and so is Bullock. Even in a flop, the actress appeals to audiences, letting us root for Alex and Kate to end up together, if only to see Bullock flash a dazzling smile. However, "The Lake House" has too many inconsis­tencies, and no amount of Sandra Bullock can turn it into a memorable and com­pelling romance.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. ­Big Ben was back. He wasn't back to form. 
Wearing protective padding around his mid­section, Ben Roethlisberger returned to Pittsburgh's lineup against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Monday night, barely two weeks after having an emergency appendectomy. He was far from effective, though, and Jacksonville's defense had a lot to with that. 
The Jaguars har.assed Roethlisberger, held Willie Parker to 20 yards on 11 carries and ended the defending Super Bowl 
IN BRIEF 

Clarett pleads guilty to rob­
bery charges 

COLUMBUS, Ohio -When the day comes that Maurice Clarett can be released from prison 3 1/2 years from now, the former Ohio State football star's life story will hardly have been told in full. 
If his lockup ends on the earliest possible date, Clarett, who struck an unexpected plea deal Monday for rob­bery and concealed weapons charges, will be all of 26 years old. His 8­week-old daughter, who was present for his sentencing, will not yet have turned 4. 
"It's in a range that will allow him to get his life back together after his release," Prosecutor Ron O'Brien said. 
Judge David Fais announced the agreement on the day Clarett's aggra­vated robbery trial was to begin. He was sentenced to 7 1/2 years with release possible after 3 1/2 years, and five years of probation. 
champions' nine-game winning streak with a 9-0 victory -the lowest-scor­ing game in Monday Night Football history. 
Josh Scobee kicked three field goals for the Jaguars (2-0), who improved to 4-0 against the Steelers in September and 3-0 against them on Monday night. 
The Steelers (1-1) kept it close all game and had the ball with about five min­utes to play, but Rashean Mathis intercepted Roethlisberger's slant pass and returned it into field goal range. Scobee kicked his third field goal, a 42­yarder with 4:26 to play. He had a 31-yarder late in the third and a 32-yarder earlier in the fourth. 
Mathis picked off anoth­er one with 1:44 remain­ing, sending Roethlisberger walking slowly to the bench. Mathis also sealed last year's victory at Pittsburgh, intercepting a pass in overtime and returning it 41 yards for the decisive score. 
The shutout was Jacksonville's first since December 2003 against Houston. It also was the fifth time the defending Super Bowl champions have been shut out. The 1980 Steelers were blanked once, and the 1981 Raiders were shut 

out three times. 
Roethlisberger threw his hands up in frustration after his first interception, then walked off the field with his hands on side fol­lowing his next posses­sion, when he took a jolt­ing shot to his midsection after throwing a pass. 
The Jaguars, mean­while, spent the closing minutes celebrating their first Monday night win since 2001, improving to 7-2 in the league's most 
coveted  time  slot.  It  
marked  a  new  low for  
scoring  on  a  Monday  

night, however, dipping below the San Francisco 49ers' 7-3 win over the New York Giants in 1990. 
T-9· und.ergoes surgery on 
IDJUred finger 
IRVING, Texas -Terrell Owens played in a Super Bowl for Philadelphia seven weeks after getting a plate and several screws put in his ankle. Now he's hoping another plate and three more screws in his right hand will enable him to play against the Eagles. 
Owens had a plate screwed into the bone attatched to his right ring finger during an operation Monday evening. His recovery time is estimated at two to four weeks, but he's likely to do all he can to rejoin the Dallas Cowboys in 20 days for his much-anticipated return to Philadelphia on Oct. 8. 
"Most of those injuries, when they put a plate in there, which I think they might do, that pretty much fixes it," coach Bill Parcells said Monday, before the surgery. "Once they put that in there, it's not going anywhere, you're not going to displace it again. It's a matter of if you can get it functional." 

Saints provide hope for 
recovenng city 
NEW ORLEANS -Clinical psycholo­gist Mindy Kronenberg says she could­n't tell the difference between a run­ning back and a quarterback if she had to. 
She does know one thing, however: The New Orleans Saints' early-season winning streak is a welcome tonic for a region still struggling with the after­math of Hurricane Katrina. 
Indeed, the 2-0 Saints are the talk of the town. And hundreds of fans lined the road leading from the airport when the team returned Sunday night from its 34-27 victory over the Green Bay Packers. 
The timing couldn't be better as the team gets ready to take on the archri­val Atlanta Falcons on Sept. 25 in a Monday night matchup for the lead in the NFC South. It should be an emo­tion-filled evening as the Superdome is reopened more than a year after the hurricane.

Lessard double dips in 5-2 win over Atlanta 
.. 
Dallas right wing tallies power play, empty-net goal in exhibition opene; big-name players sit in favor of rookies 
Associated Press 

DALLAS -Junior Lessard scored a power-play goal in the second period and added an empty-netter with 1:02 remaining to lift the Dallas Stars to a victory over the Atlanta Thrashers in a presea­son game on Monday night. 
Jussi Jokinen and Perttu Lindgren had power-play goals, and Joel Lundqvist also scored for the Stars. 
Former Dallas center Niko Kapanen scored on the power play, and Jim Slater added a goal for Atlanta. 
Both teams sat most of their big-name players in the exhi­bition opener for each club, giving extensive ice time to rookies. The Stars played the first of four games during a five-day span. 
After Lundqvist notched the only goal of the first period, Slater tied it at 1 early in the second. Jokinen put Dallas back in front 15 seconds into a second-period power play, scoring on a breakaway against former Stars backup goalie Johan Hedberg. 
Lessard padded Dallas' lead to 3-1 at 13:41 of the second period, but Kapanen narrowed the Thrashers' deficit to one goal at 17:24 of the second period. 
Lindgren extended the lead to 4-2, capitalizing during a man advantage at 6:17 of the third period. 
Sabres 4, Maple Leafs 0 
Jiri Novotny, Derek Roy and Daniel Paille scored power­play goals in the second period and Mike Ryan added one in the third to lift the Buffalo Sabres to a preseason vietory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Monday night. 
Martin Biron made 23 saves for the Sabres, who were 4­for-11 on power plays. 
Andrew Raycraft, the Maple Leafs' new No. 1 goalie, played well in making 28 saves but didn't stand much of a chance because Toronto was short­handed so often. 
The Maple Leafs, in the debut of new coach Paul Maurice, went 0-for-7 with the man-advantage. 
Things heated up in the sec­ond period when Ben Ondrus fought Chris Thorburn. Ondrus connected with two hard punches and dropped Thorburn to the ice. 
Novotny opened the scoring at 8:05 of the second. Raycroft stopped Thomas Vanek's shot with his stick, and new Leafs defenseman Hal Gill couldn't keep Novotny from knocking in the rebound. 
Roy made it 2-0 at 14:58 when Adam Mair sent a cross-ice pass to him for a goal into the open side of the net. 
Paille got a puek to roll over Haycroft's right leg pad at 18:08. 
Oilers 2, Panthers 1 
Hyan Smyth's power-play goal at 4:24 of the third proved snapped a tie and carried the Edmonton Oilers to an exhibi­tion win over the Florida Panthers on Monday night. 
In their first home appear­ance since _a Game 6 win over the Carolina Hurricanes in the Stanley Cup finals, the Oilers took advantage of a two-man power play when Shawn Horcoff' dished the puck to Smyth for an easy tap in past Panthers backup goalie Craig Anderson. 
The Western Conference champion Oilers improved to 2-0 in the preseason while the Panthers fell to 0-2 on their Alberta road trip. 
The Oilers scored lirst when a pair of highly touted prospects conneeted on the power play. Rob Schremp found defenseman Tom Gilbert at the point for a shot past new Panthers starter Alex Auld.

Mets clinch division with shutout victory 
4-0 defeat ofMarlins gives team first NL East title since 1988 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -They soaked themselves in wine and beer, then ran out of their club­house to go back on the field, jump up and down some more and share the glee with their fans. 
Ending nearly two deeades of disappointment in their division and days of delay, the New York Mets brought the NL East title back to Shea Stadium for the first time sinee 1988 with a 4-0 victory 
over the Florida Marlins on Monday night.

Fireworks shot off from behind the center-field wall when Cliff Floyd caught Josh Willingham's fly ball to left for the final out. The Mets rushed to the eenter of the diamond for a bouncing group hug near shortstop.

When the Mets win any­thing, it's time to let loose. 
"If we win the World Series this year, it's not going to erase the Yankee mystique," Tom Glavine said. "They've done it year after year, and they deserve all the attention they get. We're just trying to play well and take some of that attention. But sure, we want our piece of the pie." 
The Mets had hoped to clinch last week during a trip to Florida and Pittsburgh. But the 280 or so bottles of Freixenet Cordon Negro Extra Dry sparkling wine that had been flown from city to city were neatly arrayed in four trays outside the club­house before the game, as if to tantalize passing players. 
By the fifth inning, when the Mets were up 3-0, Pedro Martinez was sitting on the edge of the dugout, wearing goggles -perhaps in antici­pation of sprayed sting in the celebration ahead.

The Wild Women of Walsh will meet up with the Pyros of Pasquerilla East tonight at 7 p.m. on Riehle West field­both teams hoping to bounce back from an opening week loss. 
"I think we're pretty well rested," Pyros captain Molly Fox said. "We know Walsh has some really good athletes on their team, but we're ready to pull an upset." 
Walsh (0-1) lost 8-6 to the Welsh Family Whirlwinds last Sunday. The loss was a tough one and Walsh hopes to erase all memory of it with a solid vic­

"We've been practicing every aspect of the game," captain Kerri Bergen said. "We're just getting ourselves pumped up for the season."

The Belles' offense is led Lauren and Ashley Hinton ­the sisters have three goals each in the first four games of the season. Senior Caroline Stancukas also contributed a goal for the Belles in Sunday's game against North Central. 
On the defensive side of the ball, Heline and the young Saint Mary's defense will have their hands full with the Knights' offense. Calvin is led by senior forwards Sarah Weesies and Jill Capel -the two have seven and six goals respectively on the season. 
"Hight now our plan is to play our game. We are not planning any special attacks or defenses," Heline said. "We know that they have strong, experienced forwards and midfielders, so we will need to play tight in the back and con­trol the midfield." 
The two teams met twice last year and the Knights took both games 1-0 and 3-0. Capel, who had 21 goals in 2005, had one in each win, and Weesies added two more in the second victory. Calvin went on to win the MIAA championship with a 15-1 record.

the defense stepped up the challenge as well Sunday. 
A Babes pick in the second half gave them possession of the ball deep inside PW's terri­tory, but the Weasel defense held strong. The PW secondary also stepped up near the con­test's conclusion when the Babes began to move the ball. 
But a series of incomplete passes allowed time to expire and PW to walk away with the shutout still in hand.

Badin 13, PE 0 It all ended with a trick play. What appeared to be a sim­
ple sweep left turned into a reverse that allowed Badin captain Meghan Charlebois to run 30 yards for a touchdown that sealed the deal against the Pasquerilla East Pyros. 
With 10:12 left in the second half, the Bullfrog offense, which had relied mainly on the arm of sophomore quarterback Katie Rose Hackney, gave the ball to their senior captain to finish off the Pyros. 
After the game, Charlebois was humble about her run. 
"It was really just great blocking by my teammates, especially junior Ginna Dybicz," Charlebois said. 
For most of the first half, neither offense could get any­thing going. Both defenses played well and refused to give up big yardage. The great defensive efforts included two interceptions by PE freshman Anne Horst. 
"Anne really played great, making two good intercep­tions," Pasquerilla East cap­tain Molly Fox said. 
The stalemate ended with about seven minutes left in the first half when Hackney took over. Through a combination of screen passes and scram­bles, Hackney marched the Bullfrog offense down the field 
· and capped the drive with a 19-yard touchdown pass to sophomore wide receiver Courtney Rains. Hackney finished 10-of-21 for 100 yards with one touch­down and two interceptions. Badin head coach Charlie Doar was pleased with his team's performance and said the 
strategy was simple. 
"We wanted to make sure we got time for our talented fresh­men while still making sure our veterans got touches," Doar said. 
On the opposite side of the ball, the Pasquerilla East offense just couldn't get going. The passing game, led by Caroline Nally and Laura Adams, struggled. completing just two passes on the day. 
The Pyros then turned to their running game. But the Badin defense was quick off the line and repeatedly snuffed out PE's play of choice -the quarterback option. Despite the limited offense, PE head coach Nathan Dyer was not discouraged. 
"Our team played great today with the exception of two big plays, which were !Badin's] only scores. We exe­cuted pretty well on offense, but we can still improve our passing game," Dyer said. 
Next week Badin takes on Cavanaugh while PE will face Walsh.

off the left side with less than two minutes to go in the game con­verted a key third down and ended any hopes of a St. Ed's comeback. Manning, in addition to his touchdown, had 10 carries for 40 yards. 
The Stedsmen looked a bit rusty early, fumbling on their sole play of the first quarter. Things only got worse when their start­ing quarterback suffered an apparent hand injury in the sec­ond quarter -forcing the Stedsmen to resort to direct hand-otis and options. 
"The injury definitely affected our play calling," St. Ed's captain Ge Wang said. "But Nick Strom played a good game for us." 
Strom rushed for 20 yards in the second half. The Stedsmen, however, could not muster any semblance of a passing threat. 
St. Ed's found production on the ground from running back Zach Labrecque (1 0 carries for 47 yards), but its lack of a pass­ing offense led to minimal gains and drives. 
There also seemed to be some communication issues when Strom first entered the game, as the Stedsmen were called for several false start penalties. 
Wopperer didn't see the injury as a big factor for the Ramblers' defensive scheme. 
"We came out playing our game," he said. "It didn't matter who their quarterback was. They weren't moving the ball on us." 
The Stedsmen threatened in the fourth quarter, but the Siegfried defense came up with huge fourth-down stops. 
St. Ed's defense stiffened in the second half as well, holding the Ramblers offense to 30 total yards.

disappointed after ending up on the wrong end of a 12-0 battle. 
The Juggerknotts came ready to play as they marched 65 yards down field on their opening pos­session to take a quick lead. Running back Trey Patrick pun­ished Zahm with 70 yards on 20 carries, including a 10-yard touchdown run in the opening minutes. 
"We played really well out there today," Patrick said. 'Tve got to give props to the coaches and the rest of the team that really stepped up. We had some key plays when we needed them, and that's expected. We have some prime time players." 
Knott converted on two fourth­down opportunities in the fourth quarter to ice the game -the second of which was a 15-yard touchdown pass to the corner of the end zone. 
"It was a great game all around," Knott coach Abdel Banda said. "Our backups really stepped up. We just beat the defending champions, so this proves that we are capable of beating anyone." 
Zahm captain and quarterback Sean Wieland threw for three interceptions. He had a 38 per­cent completion rating and 38 yards passing. 
"We really couldn't get much going on the offensive side of the ball," Wieland said. "You have to give credit to their defense though, they played a good game. 
"We still have three games left, and we hope to get to the playoffs by winning all of those. I think this loss will be motivation to work harder in practice." 
Zahm looks to improve next week against Fisher -after a four-turnover performance ­while Knott will try to keep the ball rolling when they face Siegfried. 
Carroll15, Sorin 6 
Carroll's offense controlled the air and exploited the Sorin sec­10 yards on 2-of-8 passing. 
Sorin threw for minus three yards and an interception in the second half, but ran for 138 yards and a touchdown on the game. 
Carroll receiver Mike Versagli said that despite the win, the Vermin have to improve. 
"Mentally, I think [SorinJ did have the edge. We didn't play as well or execute as well as we should have," he said. 
O'Neill 7, Dillon 0 
O'Neill senior Alex Fortunato recovered a fumble in the game's closing minute and The Angry Mob hung on to a victory over Dillon Sunday. 
O'Neill scored the only points of the game in the second quarter following a dominating 21-play drive that began in the first quar­ter. 
Running back Braden Turner scored on a four-yard run on third down. 
He finished the game with 14 carries and 30 yards. Running back Mike Mattingly rushed for 31 yards on eight carries for the Mob as welL 
Dillon changed its offensive strategy at halftime to focus on the running game and, more specifically, the quarterback option. 
The option was effective in rat­tling the Mob defense, which allowed eight first downs in the second half after giving up one in the first half. 
Dillon went on a 13-play, 64­yard drive in the third quarter. 
O'Neill called a timeout to stall Dillon's momentum, but the Big Red gained another 21 yards after the break. 
Dillon converted on a fourth down at the O'Neill 24-yard line, but Fortunato recovered the fum­ble by the Dillon quarterback six plays later. 
Next week, Dillon will face off against Stanford, while O'Neill will b~ttle Keough. 
play, but Keenan's defense was able to stop a late-game charge from Keough and earn the win. 
With less than two minutes left in the game, Keough marched toward the end zone trailing 13­
8. The Kangaroos had the ball on the two-yard line but the Keenan defense made the stop and took home the victory. 
"We played three strong quar­ters, but we learned that we are going to have play tough the entire game," Keenan captain Alex Staffieri said. 
Late in the first quarter, Keough fumbled a punt return and Keenan recovered. After a steady march down the field, senior quarterback J .J. Vega found sophomore Jimmy Zenker in the end zone to give Keenan the 6-0 lead. The extra point was blocked. 
Keenan's defense stopped Keough's attempts to move the ball doWn the field forcing a punt on the next drive. 
The Knights continued to capi­talize on offense on the following possession. Zenker connected with Andre Villable, who made an impressive catch down field and ran it into the end zone. Keenan led 13-0 after the made extra point. 
Keough made a charge in the fourth quarter. The Kangaroos forced their way down the field and freshman quarterback Matt Bruggeman found an open receiver for touchdown. It then made the two-point conversion on a quarterback keeper to cut the lead to 13-8. 
The Keough defense delivered some big hits and forced a Keenan fumble, but was ulti­mately unable to gain momen­tum. 
Keough sophomore Dorian Inzunza was not discouraged by the loss. 
"We play hard," he said. "We have a very good team, and we are ready to step it up next game and come away with a win." 

next Sunday at 2 p.m. 
Alumni 14, Stanford 6 
An interception and touchdown rush by Alumni junior Eddie Villa provided the deciding score for the Dawgs Sunday. 
Villa picked off the pass in the third quarter and scored on a short rush to put the Dawgs up 14-6. 
"Our practice really paid off today," Villa said. "All 11 guys did what they needed to do, and the team was able to come together and come out with the win." 
Shapot hit Villa with a long pass in the second quarter and ran untouched into the end zone for the 7-0 lead. 
The Alumni defense was led by Brett Shapot, who was in on many of the Dawgs' big defensive stops and played quarterback on offense.. 
Neither team allowed any points in the first quarter. · 
"We started out a little disor­ganized, but eventually the offense was able to come togeth­er and get things done," Villa said. 
Stanford junior Tregg Duerson got away from his defender and caught a pass in the end zone near the end of the second half to cut the Alumni lead to 7-6. The point after was blocked. 
After halftime, the defenses continued to play strong, culmi­nating in Villa's interception. 
The Stanford defense did not allow any more points in the fourth quarter. But the offense was unable to find any holes in the Dawg defense, and the Griffins fell short. 
Alumni battles Morrissey this Sunday, while Stanford will play Dillon.

conference, but across the country that there is an even playing field," Notre Dame head coach Debbie Brown said. "Our goal has always been to win the regular season and then the conference championship. I don't think it's going to be easy, 
accomplish what we want to do." 
Notre Dame compiled a 13-1 record in conference play last season -the lone loss came Nov. 5, 2005 at Pittsburgh 3-2 -to share the season title. The No. 8 Irish then went into the league championships at Louisville's home court and defeated the No. 7 Cardinals in an electric 3-2 win for the title. 
It was the Cardinals' first sea­son in the Big East -they pre­viously played in Conference USA -but a quick rivalry developed between the two teams. Louisville, along with Pitt, will be key games in Notre Dame's 14-game conference schedule, but the Irish will not treat the two any different than the rest. 
"We'll probably look at those two matches in terms of the history between the programs and how we've competed against each other," Brown said of Pitt and Louisville. "Past that, we do respect the teams in the Big East and it's a challenge for us to win the regular season and conference championship." 
No Big East teams were ranked in the American Volleyball Coaches. Association poll released Monday, but Louisville was on the bubble, receiving 33 votes. The Irish ure each will have in confer­ence play. 

"It's still too early to know exactly how [the season is] going to play out because there been such a variety in the con­ference teams in who they played against," she said. "It's going to take a couple of weeks of conference play to get a bet­ter feel of how things are going to shake out." 
Notre Dame will travel to New Jersey for its second straight weekend Sept. 30 to face Seton Hall and will host Marquette and Syracuse a week later in its conference home openers. 
"It's always good to play at home, not having the travel on the weekend is a big thing," Brown said of playing at the Joyce. "In just being in comfort­able and familiar surroundings and not having the extra bur­den of hours of travel." 
An Oct. 13 match against DePaul at home is the final game for the Irish before a fall break trek to Hawaii. 
 

Notre Dame will play a two­game set against the No. 15 Warriors starting Oct. 16 in Honolulu. 
"It's not .a question in my mind that playing the matches over there will be beneficial for us," Brown said. "We're going over there with every expecta­tion that we're going to win. It's a chance to play a top-25 team and take away a couple wins. It's a chance for us to prove ourselves again." 
The remaining eight games on the Irish schedule after the break include Pitt and Louisville, but Notre Dame and Brown refuse to look farther than Saturday. 
"I think that the staff and the team -we're trying not to look at the season as a whole thing," Brown said. 
"To be quite honest that's a few weeks down the road, and right now we're just thinking about Villanova and Rutgers and opening up the Big East this weekend and taking it one match at a time."

but it's going to be attainable." 
With the graduation of sec­ond-team All-America Lauren Brewster and All-America hon­orable mention Lauren Kelbley, and the influx of seven fresh­men, the Irish have suffered more losses -five -in eleven games than they did all of last year. 
"We're not where we wanted to be in terms of our win and loss record but we still have high expectations for the team," Brown said. "If we learn and continue to grow every match, there's no reason we can't

up quick on Notre Dame's aca­demic support system for ath­letes. 
"Everyone who goes there graduates," Gray said succinct­ly. . 
But Notre Dame won't expect Gray simply to graduate. Notre Dame will expect him to com­pete immediately for roles in a secondary that has been beat­en by opponents repeatedly over the past three years. 
"He thinks there's a very good opportunity [for playing time with fifth-year senior] Mike Richardson being gone next year," Frank said. 
Frank said Notre Dame's coaches were successful in recruiting Gray by not forcing him to make a hasty decision. 
"I think he started talking with Bill Lewis and Charlie

Weis and felt really comfort­able with both coaches," Frank said. "They just did a real nice job of not pressuring him." 
Gray had praise for both Lewis and Weis Monday. He called Lewis "soft-spoken" and "well-rounded" and referred to Weis as "straight­forward." 
"Coach Weis ... he's not going to tell you what you want to hear," Gray said. "He's going to tell you the truth." 
Gray said watching the Irish lose to Michigan served no harm to Notre Dame's chances in his decision-making process. 
"The atmosphere was great," he said. "Even though they went down 21, 28 points, everyone stays [and~ supports the team."
