The HPC will hold off any fur­thPr discussions about the $1,400 bill from the food fight until the Senate meets next week with John Goldrick, asso­ciate vice president of residence life, announced HPC Co-chairman Bob Daley at Tuesday's meeting. 
Daley said the HPC has no opposition to paying the bill but would like to make that deci­sion in a combined effort with all of student government and the student body. 
Daley and Co-chairman Tim Salmon said they hope to meet with Bill Hickey soon to obtain a general idea of his feelings concerning the student body's response to the proposed food bill. 

In other business, Liam Can­ny, president of Pangborn, is drafting a proposal to increase the number of tickets that are available to students for away football games. Canny told the Council he hopes to meet with Michael Bobinski. manager of ticket sales at the Joyce ACC on Thursday to discuss a change in the present ticket policy. Only 250 students received tick­ets to the Michigan game, ac­cording to Canny. Daley said

WASHINGTON -The con­gressional Iran-Contra report paints a picture of a Reagan administration at odds with the law and the Constitution, but minority Republicans dis­missed it Tuesday as a partisan indictment of the president that ignores foreign policy ques­tions raised by the affair. 

The report says President Reagan flirted with constitu­tional crisis by creating a White House atmosphere that encouraged evasion of legal re­quirements and flouting of proper procedures for reaching foreign policy goals. 
It also says the administra­tion violated the Constitution by going to third countries to solicit donations for Nicaragua's Contra rebels at a time when Congress barred even indirect military aid to them. 
And it is sharply critical of Attorney General Edwin Meese III, questioning why he delayed launching a criminal investigation of the affair when it became public a year ago.

By ERIC M. BERGAMO Senior Staff Reporter 
Starting with next fall's freshman class, the card in­coming freshman use to indi­cate their decision to attend the University will no longer in­clude a place to state their first and second choices for residence halls, said Evelyn Reinebold, director of student residences. 
Reinebold said that having a place to express a preference on the card gave incoming freshman the impression that they would receive their first or second choice. 
"We have gotten some really vivid letters because (freshmen) were not given their first or second choice," she added. 
The policy had freshmen being placed into a dorm on the basis of when the confirmation card was received, she ex­plained. Those returning the card earlier usually received their preference, while those who sent their cards later were less likely to get their choice. 
"We decided that it might eliminate a lot of hard feelings . . . if we took that first and second choice factor off the card," Reinebold said.

But glimpses of its findings were gleaned Tuesday from a report of minority Republicans on the House and Senate inves­tigating panels and from com­mittee sources. 
"Clearly, what went on here was not what the founding fat­hers envisioned,'' said a source familiar with the report, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. "It paints a picture of a government out of con­trol." 
In its broadest criticism of the president, the Democratic­directed report concludes that Reagan failed in his constitu­tional duty to "take care that the laws be faithfully ex­ecuted." 
In the introduction to their own dissenting version of the report, the GOP members con­tended that the Democratic report also attempts, "almost as an overarching thesis, to if it were behaving with wanton disregard for the law."

"The onlything I don't like about Notre Dame is the football team." 
"It ruins the academic credibility of the Uni­versity," continued the visiting professor. Ad­mission standards are lowered to admit ath­letes, he said. Millions of dollars spent to build the team's new indoor sports facility should have been used to improve academics, he added. 
Was the professor right? 
Through a survey of 760 college and univer­sity presidents, U.S. News and World Report"s Oct. 26 edition ranked America's top 25 "na­tional universities." 
Notre Dame wasn't ranked. Nor was it ranked among the article's top 10 "national univer­sities" located in the midwest. 
Could a "big time" college football program prevent a university from achieving academic excellence? 
A quick check of the survey's results showed three Big Ten universities: Michigan (8th), Il­linois (20th) and Wisconsin (23rd) ranked in the top 25. A possible Notre Dame Cotton Bowl op­ponent, the University of Texas, was 25th on the list. 
Schools with big time basketball programs also placed on the list. Duke was seventh, and the University of North Carolina finished eleventh. 
Why, then, doesn't Notre Dame command the ''respect and attention in the realm of American higher education," (1987-88 Notre Dame Bulle­tin) that these universities do? 
Some have suggested Notre Dame's Catholic character prevents the school from becoming a truly great university. They argue that reli­gious teachings on abortion, homosexuality and birth control prevent Notre Dame from attack­ing these issues in the classroom. 
Again, a check of the survey results shows the "best" colleges and universities can be re­ligiously affiliated. 
Valparaiso University was ranked the num­ber one "midwestern and western comprehen­sive institution." Villanova University was ranked the best comprehensive institution in the east. And Saint Mary's College was ranked a top 10 "smaller comprehensive school." 
Why, then, didn't America's college and uni­versity presidents rank Notre Dame on any of the survey's lists? 
The answer is research, or Notre Dame's comparative lack of it. Notre Dame barely qualifies for the survey's definition of "National universities; the major research universities and leading granters of doctoral degrees." His­torically an undergraduate university, Notre Dame's research programs lag far behind those of the top 25 universities in the country. 

Chris Bednarski 
News Editor 


University President Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh was one of the first to realize that Notre Dame's research programs need improvement. His last years as president were marked by vigorous attempts to improve Notre Dame's graduate programs. In his footsteps, President Father Edward "Monk" Malloy has pledged continued improvement of the University's research programs. 
Top research programs, however, come all too often at the expense of undergraduate pro­grams, as professors are taken away from their students. 
Notre Dame professors interact closely with students, teaching them values that form the moral base for "the University's strong lead­ership on issues of world peace and social jus­tice," the article said in its only reference to Notre Dame. 
Close interaction with professors helps make Notre Dame a home for students, not just a school. It also helps develop individuals who will benefit society, not just the work force. 
Research improvements at the University may one day pay off, and a news magazine may one day rank the University as a top 25 research institution. 
In the meantime, Notre Dame will have to settle for an average research program, a tradi­tion of close-knit students and faculty and a top 10 football team. 
I'm not complaining.

Nicaraguan plan called an attempt to defeat Contras 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON The Nicaraguan government's cease-fire proposal is little more than a disguised attempt to help the Sandinista army achieve victory over the U.S.­backed Contras, a top State De­partment official said Tues­day. 
The official said the pro­posal, unveiled here last week by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, "is the type of thing a conquering commander would issue as terms of sur­render to a defeated foe." 
The official spoke to a group of reporters on the condition that he not be identified by name. 
Later Tuesday, House Speaker Jim Wright and Secre­tary of State George Shultz made an unusual appearance before television cameras to 
try to settle what Shultz called "a little tiff" over the speaker's ~~· embroilment in the Central

look ahead and focus on things we agree on, insofar as our Central American policy is con­cerned," said Shultz, after coming to Capitol Hill for a hastily arranged meeting with Wright. 
Sharp differences over U.S. policy and tactics in Central America remained between Wright and the administration, but the meeting appeared de­signed to quiet the public clash which officials feared was dis­tracting attention from sub­stantive peace talks in Central America. 
Under Ortega's proposal, any Contras who lay down their arms and accept a government offer of amnesty may rejoin the political life of the nation "with full enjoyment of rights." 
The government asked rebels to move to any of three cease-fire zones where their safety would be guaranteed once the 30-day truce goes into effect on Dec. 5. Humanitarian aid could be sent to the Contras, but military resupply would be forbidden. 
Ortega has made clear he sees his offer as a proposal and not an ultimatum. 
The plan has been hailed by Wright, D-Texas, as another step in the ''progression toward peace" even though some

'Shoppers beware of dangerous toys' 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The fuzzy white moose seemed to smile, and his bells jingled, as the head of the government's prod­uct safety agency held him up Tuesday with a warning that such friendly-looking toys pose hidden dangers to the unwary. 
The loosely attached bells on the moose can easily come loose and might choke a child, Terrence Scanlon, chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, noted at his agency's annual toy safety briefing. 
The moose was one of mil­lions of toys kept out of stores by federal officials, along with a toy train that had 300 times the legal amount of lead in its paint and a rattle with a long handle that could choke an in­fant, Scanlon said. 
Recalls covering some 2.9 million children's products-­mostly toys --were announced during the 1986 fiscal year, Scanlon said. In addition, he said, 2.2 million unsafe toys were stopped at ports of entry by commission and Customs 
Service officials. 
But still, 35 children died last year in accidents involving toys and more than 100,000 were hurt seriously enough to

Mr. Potato Head gives up his pipe 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-Mr. Potato Head, 35, quit smoking Tues­day. He gave his pipe to Sur­geon General C. Everett Koop and vowed never to touch it again. 
"He started to smoke the day he was born," said Koop. "Not only is it dangerous to his health, it gives the message to kids around the country that smoking is not a bad thing to do." 
So pleased was Koop with Head's decision that he proclaimed the giant potato the official "spokespud" for this year's Great American Smokeout, the American Can­cer Society's drive to get mil­lions of Americans to give up smoking, at least for the day, on Thursday. 
About 40 million Mr. Potato Heads have been sold since the Playskool toy was introduced 35 years ago, complete with stick-on eyes, ears, a nose, a mouth--and a pipe. 
Now that he has kicked the habit, Playskool officials are thinking about reshaping the mouth--which now looks a lot like a mustache--into a smile for the estimated 1 million toys manufactured each year. 
First lady Nancy Reagan sent "heartiest congratula­tions" to Head. 
"By kicking the habit, Mr. Potato Head will not only im­prove his health, but will serve as a good example to young people who need to learn the importance of maintaining good health habits," Mrs. Reagan said in a message read by Koop.

Campus police officers didn't care who the machine belonged to and slapped a ticket on it for violating parking regulations. -National On-Campus Report 
Apartheid protesters were convicted at the University of Texas. A jury required only 90 minutes of deliberation, after a week of testimony, to convict 11 of 16 demonstrators on charges of disruptive ac­tivity. The protesters last year briefly took over the school president's office, barricaded the doors, and presented a letter demanding divestiture from companies dealing with South Africa. Those convicted face a fine and possible jail time. -National On-Campus Report

Twenty-three cities are on both lists. The 26 largest metropolitan areas are on one or the other. 
Thomas said "a handful, maybe 10" cities, including New York, Denver and Los An­geles, probably would have to restrict auto use to meet the standards. 
That could be done, he sug­gested, "by measures like ride­sharing and car pools and mass transit." 
Thomas' policy, announced for public comment before adoption early next year, calls for all states to submit new pol­lution control plans for non­compliance areas in the next two years.

Bishops to raise funds for poor, elderly nuns 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -America's Roman Catholic bishops voted Tuesday to raise funds to aid thousands of the nuns who taught young Catholics in past decades and now have grown old with little or no money to live on. 
"It's a matter of justice, not merely of a matter of charity," Bishop Michael Sheehan of Lubbock, Texas, said before the National Conference of Catholic Bishops voted 156-10 to launch the national fund­raising drive. 
Numerous other bishops made similar comments, all praising the work of the nuns in parochial schools, hospitals and other ministries. Several bishops emphasized the word "justice," noting that women in Catholic religious orders have traditionally worked for low wages and that this fact has contributed to their current problems. 
Bishop John McGann of Rockville Centre, N.Y., head of a committee sponsoring the proposal, declined to specify a goal for the fund-raising drive, which will focus on national col­lections in Catholic churches in each of the next 10 years. 
McGann noted that an ac­counting firm estimated the eventual need might reach $2.5 billion, even assuming the sale of $1 billion in religious orders' land and buildings, including schools, residences and semi­naries. He and other bishops said said no one expects the drive to raise anywhere near that much. 
McGann's committee, which includes representatives of re­ligious orders of nuns and brot­hers as well as the bishops, said a 1985 estimate indicated there were 44,000 nuns and 3,600 brot­hers over the age of 70 at that time. 
Some belong to orders that are relatively well-to-do. But others were described as in desperate straits, with large and growing numbers of older members at the same time relatively few young women are joining to take their places and help support them. 
Before voting, the bishops debated the subject at length. But their disagreements were on such matters as when the collection should be held and how the money should be par­celed out, not on whether the drive was necessary. 
Several bishops said religi· ous orders that have substan­tial wealth should be asked to join the effort to help im­poverished orders. McGann said that would be done.

Negotiators discuss deficit 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON White House officials and congres­sionalleaders, pledging to con­clude a deficit-cutting deal this week, met into the night Tues­day, but agreement remained elusive. 
"We have no choice but to put it together," said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Commit­tee. "We have to show that the president and Congress can work together. Otherwise, the psychological fallout on the fin­ancial markets will be very bad,"

Under the present policy, stu­dents are never allocated more than five percent of the tickets the University receives for away games, said Daley. 
Mike Thomas of Morissey Hall proposed a new program of selling books by computer print-out. As a possible future HPC service project, it could save sellers and buyers of books time and money, ex­plained Thomas. 
To advertise books, students would fill out a computer form with their name, phone number and the title of their book or books. The computer print-out containing this information would then be placed in the mailboxes of all on-campus stu­dents, said Thomas. 
wanted to agree, and even though it was "sort of a moving target, and (sometimes) it seems like it recedes," success was "certainly a possibility." 
Between closed-door talks, House and Senate leaders met privately with President Reagan and White House offi­cials to discuss the troubles. The goal is to reduce the deficit for fiscal 1988, the year that began Oct. 1, by at least $23 billion, in order to avert auto­matic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law. 
"The president is, of course, disappointed that we don't have an agreement yet," said White House spokesman Mar­lin Fitzwater. "He wants one very badly and feels that we have bent over backwards to compromise and be construc­tive, and we have not had quite that same sense of cooperation from the Democrats." 
With the two sides searching for about $2 billion more in spending cuts, White House budget director James Miller suggested on Tuesday trim­ming domestic programs, in­cluding child nutrition, Medicaid, and food stamps. Democratic lawmakers said the proposals were unaccepta­ble, according to people familiar with the talks.

Iraq raids nuclear plant; 
Iran says 11 
Associated Press 
MANAMA, Bahrain -Iraqi warplanes raided an Iranian nuclear power plant Tuesday, killing 11 people, and an Iranian nuclear official claimed the attack could lead to another Chernobyl, Iranian news reports said. 
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, moni­tored in Cyprus, quoted energy official Reza Amrollahi as saying the plant contained nu­clear material. 
He said the raid might lead to "the same transfrontier ra­dioactive release and radiological consequences as the Chernobyl nuclear acci­dent," IRNA said. 
Iraq did not announce that it had bombed the plant and there 

were killed 
was no independent confirma­tion of the attack. Iraq has raided the plant at least five times since 1984. 
Amrollahi, president of Iran's Atomic Energy Organi­zation, sent an "urgent protest note" to Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, Austria, IRNA re­ported. 
He asked Blix to rush a team of experts to the scene to mon­itor the effects of the raid, the agency said. 
IRNA reported the air strike on the nuclear plant and ac­cused Iraq of violating "in­ternational conventions." 
The 7-year-old war has recently heated up, with Iran threatening a major assault on Iraq.

'New' courses strange yet practical 
t's registration time onI campus again, time to sign up for the classes you'll be taking next semester. Next se­mester at this time things won't be quite the same. That's be­cause the Administration, In keeping with Its usual benevolent and paternal stance, has been looking out for your best interests, and they've decided to Introduce some new classes for the 1988 fall semester. 
course is to teach the student how to deal with the anxiety Incurred by walking Into a crowded bar with a crummy ID. Grades will be taken mainly from pop quizzes In which ran­dom students will be forced to give their social security num­bers and home addresses on command. Trick questions such as "Is this really a picture of you?" and "You're kidding. right?" will also be asked. Re­quired texts Include Edward's 

KrlsMurphy 
Altered 
These new classes will be more relevant to the life of the college student. and their pur­pose will be to give the student a deeper Insight Into his or her role In the Notre Dame family. What follows is only a sample of these new and more relevant courses. 
Sociology 348: Introduction to Confusion 
The purpose of this class is to lead the student to a better understanding of the role of confusion In his or her life. Students will be asked to ex­plain concepts that are way over their heads and then forced to write papers on them. Grades will then be given, but not explained. Teachers will answer questions unless they don't feel like it. and the class will be held In a different room every day. Anyone who com­plains will be shot. Required texts will be announced later. Maybe. 
Psychology 240: Advanced Flirting 
This course will attempt to move beyond the classic, but highly Ineffective, Notre Dame pick-up lines such as "What's your major?". New techniques such as blatant staring and highly suggestive comments will be attempted, first In lab and later on a class field trip to Bridget's. Anyone who fails to score on this field trip will au­tomatically fall. Two papers will be assigned, one on beer goggles and another on how to avoid the other person. This course may be taken In con­junction with Psych 280: Inter­mediate Teasing.

classic "The Agony of Defeat: Having Your Fake ID Taken Away" and the recently pub­lished "No Officer, That's How I Looked Before Plastic Surgery." 
PLS 290: Introduction to Mellowness 
This course will attempt to mellow out everyone involved. At the beginning of the semes­ter class will meet twice a week, and a relatively laid back discussion will ensue. A paper will be assigned and a test will be taken, but neither will be collected. Near mldsemester, class meetings will be cut back to once a week and discussions will slow down, centering mainly on questions such as "What's for dinner?" and "Que Pasa?." By the end of the se­mester students will be encour­aged to stay home and lie on the carpet. Required texts in­clude "Are You Mellow Or Just Dead?" Prerequisite: PLS 190: Modern American Laziness 
English 430: Literature of Nastiness 
Really nasty books by really

majority of this course's materi­
al. Classics such as "''m OK. 
You're a Rancid Scumbag", 
"Meln Kampf" and "Portrait of a 
Skinny, Geeky Irish Kid as a 
Young Man" will be read and 
discussed. Students will be en­
couraged to express their 
opinions through physical vio­·lence, and insults will be graded according to how hard the insulted ·person cries. Papers will be assigned and then read in front of the class and laughed at. 
Sociology 100: Introduction 

to Alcoholism 
This course is open only to 

freshmen and will attempt to 
teach the little buggers how to 
handle their liquor. Topics such as "The Beer Run", "Introduc­tion to Mixed Drinks" and "Passing Out: Where and When To Do It" will be addressed in the course of the semester. Obnoxiousness will be tolerated and even encouraged, so freshmen have nothing to worry about. A field trip off­campus is scheduled late In the semester for those who have made enough progress to find their way home after the party. 
Criminology..300: Inter­mediate Police Brutality 
Members of the South Bend Police Force have been so kind to donate their time to the Uni­versity In an effort to better relations with the student body. Topics will include "skull bus­tin"' and "butt kickin"' as well as 'just plain yellin' and screamin"' and why these methods are so effective at breaking up student parties. The importance of savage dogs and breathalyzers will also be examined. The eternal question

"Don't the South Bend Police have anything better to do?" will not be asked under any circumstances. 
Psychology 580: Applied Snottiness 
This Is a graduate course for students who have demon­strated their ability to be spoiled, stuck-up, snotty, and generally obnoxious in regard to other people and the world in general. Intensive labs will be held to promote bragging about how much money you have and being totally apat­hetic about anyone but your­self. Everyone will get A's, be­cause if they don't. they'll moan to their parents and the University will lose impor;tant donations. Enrollment limited to those who moan and rag the loudest. 
History 440: Stress Seminar 
The purpose of this course will be to totally freak out everyone involved. It's that simple. If you think you worry a lot now, sign up for this class and realize how good you had it. We won't even tell you what the class is about. That should give you something to think about. For all you know it could be an EE course. And guess what? We're going to make it required! Ha!

Regulations, expenses and ads all part of running food sales 
by RENEE GAU and JULIE CASKO Business Writers 
Editor's Note: This is the first in a series of three arti­cles investigating the food sales operations in six wo­men's and six men's dorms. 
When most people think of food sales they think of a good excuse for a study break, a place both to so­cialize with friends and to satisfy their late night munchies. Most people do not realize, however, that behind the food counter is a genuine business enterprise, the prod­uct of many arduous hours given by managers and employees. And, as with any business, they keep inven­tories, pay bills, create sales and specials, earn revenue and encounter regulations. 
The regulations spring from a history of problems sur­rounding food sales. 
About five years ago, said Michael McCauslin, director of the Department of Envi­ronmental Health and Safety, the sanitarium found many plumbing and electrical prob­lems in a number of the dorms. Some food sales, for example, would use a single outlet to plug in a microwave oven, a small pizza oven and a freezer. This overload created an electrical fire haz­ard. 
Since then, both the Univer­sity and the dorms have taken steps to improve this situation by funding renova­tions of the basements. 
The University also publishes a pamphlet delineating the rules for "a safe operation of Residence Hall Food Sales." Among the variety of guidelines, they forbid such things as selling canned or home prepared food and the use of grills, griddles or deep fat fryers. Also, food sales managers cannot remodel of make addi­tions of equipment (ie. freezers, ovens) without the approval of the Department of Health and Safety. To in­sure that managers uphold these regulations, the Univer­sity conducts semester in­spections. 
These regulations, however, do not solve all of the prob­lems. One of the guidelines calls for "adequate refrigera-, tion and freezer storage space" and yet the food sales in Pangborn, St. Ed's and Lyons have just enough room for one decent size refrigerator. 
With these problems it is obviously difficult to run a competitive business which can serve the needs of the students. And yet the managers find ways to com­promise and cut corners. Beth Rosa, co-manager of Lyons Hall Food Sales, sees it as an educational entrepreneural experience. "Working in Lyon's Food Sales has become a learning process in both finance and accounting," she said. 
Chuck Bower of Grace Food Sales sees it as a chance to develop managerial skills while contributing to the im­provement of the dorm. "Managing <Grace Food Sales) has been a great expe­rience," he said. 
The University and the dorm rectors do protect the food sales operations. For example, if managers run a food sales into debt, as hap­pened at Morrissey's last year, the dorm will undoubt­edly help start operations anew. 
Managers do not have "ul­timate" responsibilities like real business managers. They have the freedom to make mistakes, learn from them and still be assured of a con­tinuing business. Also, unlike a fully organized enterprise, dorm food sales honor either very simplified business con­tracts or verbal contracts and none file tax forms. 
"Food sales is a very, very small scale business but it is easy to see from running it how a large-scale business would work," says Nolene Morrissey, co-manager of Farley Food Sales. Although the goal of all food sales is to maximize profit, the ability to do so is limited by the dorm's size, location and equipment. Each food sales manager is presented with problems arising from the unique situa­tions at each dorm. 
Morrissey finds it hard to get Farley residents to pur­chase from food sales. "A lot of the girls here are health conscious. Our biggest seller is Diet Coke," she said. 
Competition is also a prob­lem facing many of the smaller, centrally located dorms. St. Ed's Food Sales mangers, Scott Lechner and Greg Buelock, must contend with competition from the nearby Huddle. 
The majority of managers do not promote their food sales ouside of the dorm. "Advertising in the dorms," however, "is very impor­tant," said Ed Kelly, co­owner of Holy Cross' fondly 
. named 'Pigpen' food sales. Kelly jokes that one technique is to specialize in female employees. "The girls lure guys down." he said. 
Many managers have found that even with cutting prices, advertising and offering spe­cials, profits are not easy to come by. Revenue generated from sales sometimes just barely covers costs. 
The biggest cost is inven­tory. Many managers pur­chase their food from dis­tributors who offer lower prices and less hassle. Other major costs are employee wages and rent. Rent varies from dorm to dorm, with some having none to others paying $750 per semester for equipment and space. 
Because some food sales managers are under contract with their dorms and other are not, there is a difference in how profits must be dis­tributed. Some managers, such as St. Ed's and Walsh's receive all the profit, while others such as Dillon's, Howard's and B.P.'s are obligated to share the· profit with the dorm Hall Council. 
The opportunity to make a profit and gain practical busi­ness experience are the two major incentives for students to undertake the operation of dorm food sales. Of course, as Maria Gonzalez, manager of P.E. Food Sales, admits, "It will look good on a resume!''

Business Briefs 


Northwest Orient has competitive prices if you are willing to leave on New Year's Eve and return Monday the fourth. Bowl fans can fly from Chicago for $227, New York for $198 and Los Angeles for only $218. 
Eastern's flight from Chicago costs $297. An Eastern traveler can depart on December 30 and return on January 4. 
Delta has the lowest Chicago-Dallas fare for Wednesday­Sunday travelers. This flight will only set you back $207. However, to obtain Delta's best LaGuardia and LAX fares, Irish fans can leave Wednesday, but must return Monday. The New York flight costs $228. The L.A. fare is $288. 
Local Irish fans can fly Piedmont from South Bend to Dal­las for $258. There are three flights leaving South Bend Wed­nesday, with a return on Monday the fourth. 
There are still plenty of hotel rooms available for New Year's weekend. Ramada Inn's Arlington location rents four­person rooms for $52 a night. 
Comfort Inns' nearest location is in Garland, about 15 miles from downtown Dallas. Four-person rooms will go for $54 per night. 
The Irving Sheraton consists of rooms with king-size beds, with a limit of two people per room. The rates are $75 or $59 a night. 
Quality Inn has rooms available at its Irving location for $52 a night. The rate of these four-person rooms drops to $35 per night after January 1. u Looks like we'll be seeing less of Spuds MacKenzie in the future. 
Critics have attacked Anheuser-Busch for selling Spuds shirts, posters and stuffed dolls. The critics maintain that through selling these products Anheuser-Busch is promoting beer drinking to children. 
According to a source close to Anheuser-Busch, the com­pany is planning on scaling back the use of Spuds to promote Bud Light beer. This decision is not completely due to Spud's critics however. Anheuser-Busch also believes that the dog's appeal may also be waining. u The Last Word-Charlie York, a bond trader with Salomon Brothers, commenting on getting a job in the se­curities industry: "I'll be honest with you. There's the pre­October 19th Market and the post-October 19th Market, and you have to be realistic about your chances in this business right now." I guess this means that these writers will be wearing name tags and will be uttering, "Would you like fries with that?" at their jobs next year.

looking for a new coach.

Earle Bruce and the resignation of athletic dlrec-
Ohio State searches for coach 
Associated Press 

COLUMBUS, Ohio -No sooner had it been announced that Earle Bruce had been fired as head football coach at Ohio State than the speculation began over a successor. 
But, in light of the contro­versy swirling around Bruce's firing by university President Edward Jennings--and the sub­sequent resignation of Athletic Director Rick Bay in protest-­almost as important as who might be interested are their reasons for being interested. 
"If it's a coach who already has a good job now, then he'll take (the circumstances sur­rounding Bruce's firing) into consideration," said Michigan coach Bo Schembechler. "There are a lot of coaches around the country who will jump into any void. They (Ohio State) will have no problem getting a coach, but whoever goes in there will have some apprehension." 
Jennings, however, said he expected not to have trouble at­tracting a replacement. 
"I'm confident we can at­tract the finest coach in the country, and I'm confident that we will," he said. 
Bruce was fired despite an 80-26-1 record in his nine seasons at Ohio State. 
Jennings said at a Tuesday news conference that he planned to meet with James Jones, the associate athletic director appointed to succeed Bay, to review the process for selecting a new football coach. Jennings said he hoped that a

Toronto's Bell wins MVP, narrowly defeats Trammell 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -George Bell of the Toronto Blue Jays became the first member of a Canadian team to win the American League Most Valuable Player award Tuesday, beating Alan Trammell of the Detroit Tigers in the voting. 
Bell, also the first Dominican to be named MVP, beat the Tigers' shortstop by 21 points, getting 332 points to Tram­mell's 311 in voting by the 
Baseball  Writers  Association  
of America.  
For  winning,  Bell  will  

receive a $50,000 bonus from the Blue Jays. The outfielder's base salary for 1987 was $1,285,000. 
Two association members in each of the 14 AL cities were eligible to vote. Bell received 16 first-place votes and Tram­mell12. 
Minnesota outfielder Kirby Puckett was third in the voting with 201 points, followed by Boston's Dwight Evans and Milwaukee's Paul Moiltor. 
Bell's outstanding season was somewhat tarnished by a damaging slump in the final weeks of the season as Toronto battled Detroit for first place in the AL East. 
Bell struggled through a 2­for-26 finish as the Tigers swept the Blue Jays in the final three games to win the division. 
Bell, who is not always cooperative with the media, hit .308 with 47 home runs, a league-leading 134 runs batted in and 111 runs scored, the lat­ter three setting club records. He also had a .605 slugging percentage and 16 game­winning RBis. 
He staged a season-long bat­tle with Oakland rookie Mark McGwire for the AL home run title before McGwire finished with 49. 
"He's got a bad shoulder from carrying the rest of the ball club all summer," Detroit Manager Sparky Anderson said of Bell after the Tigers beat the Blue Jays 1-0 on the final day of the season. 
Trammell moved to the No. 4 spot in the lineup during spring training, after the defec­tion of free agent Lance Par­rish. Trammell responded by hitting a career-high .343 with 28 home runs, 105 runs batted in and 205 hits. 
He was the first Tiger since Al Kaline in 1955 to have 200 hits and 100 RBI. 
There were no excuses from Bell after the Tigers swept the final three games from Toronto in Detroit. 
"They gave me the pitches to hit. I missed them," he said. 
Since becoming a full-time player with Toronto in 1984, Bell has averaged .296 with 33 homers and 106 RBI. 
He was drafted by Toronto in 1980 from the Philadelphia Phillies organization, despite missing most of that season with a stress fracture in his shoulder. 
Toronto's AL East champi­onship year of 1985 also was Bell's most controversial. 
He gave notice to the league of his power when, in consecu­tive games, he hit home runs twice over the left field roof at Comiskey Park in Chicago--the first player to accomplish that feat--and also into the center­field bleachers 455 feet away. 
He also showed his temper on "brush-back" pitches when he charged the mound in Bos­ton after a close pitch by Bruce Kison and delivered a drop­kick. Bell was suspended for two games. 
replacement could be found by the end of the year. 
"We would look for, in a new coach, an individiual who represents the institution well," Jennings said, refusing in response to a question to say that Bruce had failed to do so. 
Heading the list of prospec­tive coaches are several former Ohio State assistants and prominent head coaches with Ohio backgrounds. 
The top contender could be 37-year-old Kent State Univer­sity coach Glen Mason. Mason took over the Kent State pro­gram in the spring of 1986, upon the sudden death of Coach Dick Scesniak. He took a 3-8 team in 1985 to a 5-6 record and conten­tion for the Mid-American Con­ference crown. 
This year, with one game remaining, Kent is 7-3, its best record since 1976. 
Mason, a former Ohio State linebacker married to a former OSU cheerleader, spent six years under Bruce as the offen­sive coordinator at Ohio State. He also has had coaching stints at Ball State, Allegheny, Iowa State and Illinois. 
Asked Monday night if he would be a candidate for the position, Mason said, "If you are asking me if I have an in­terest in the job, yes, I have an interest in the job. A very big interest. I've dreamed of going back to OSU some day." 
Others mentioned as poten­tial candidates have varied backgrounds. 
Marshall University head coach George Chaump worked as an assistant for 11 years un­der the late Woody Hayes and is 13-8-1 in his two seasons at Marshall.

It appears there will be no deal between the Orange and Cotton bowl games regarding the Notre Dame-Miami winner and loser. The folks in Dallas want Notre Dame, nobody else, to bring in bucks and TV ratings. TV ratings are all the more important this year as the Cotton and Fiesta Bowls go head-to-head at 12:30 on Janu­ary 1 with CBS and NBC, respectively. 
So Miami has a chance to 
play for the national champi­
onship again, against the 
Nebraska-Oklahoma winner. 
While the odds will say the Hurricanes should win, the od­dsmakers cannot estimate the magnitude of two more impor­tant numbers. 58 and 7. 
The first number is the score Miami ran up to crush Notre Dame in Gerry Faust's last game as head coach. The second number is all the strug­gling Irish offense could muster in that game. But the 1987 offense does not struggle ­it knows how to move the foot­ball. And the 1987 defense does not let anybody run up the score, even in a friendly card game. 
If the Alabama game was emotional, the Miami game should be twice that. Not only does Notre Dame have a chance to kill Miami's hopes for a national championship, it can keep hope for an eighth na­tional title alive with a win. If that is not incentive enough, nothing could be. 
Over half of this football team and student body was here for the embarrassment of the 1985 debacle. We remem­ber. And so does a certain CBS commentator who led the Irish to two national championships in ten years. His tenure is referred to as the Era of Ara. And his words on that infamous day in Miami two years ago now look like those of a prophet. No matter what bowl Notre Dame plays in on New Year's Day, no matter what title is at stake, Ara Parseg­hian was right when he said: 
"From these ashes, a phoenix will rise."

And then there were three. 
Of the eight teams that gained a berth in the men's in­terhall soccer playoffs, only the Off-Campus Hoobers, Holy ·cross, and Zahm remain in the 
hunt for the championship. 
The Hoobers, defending champions and second seed, appear on their way to retain­ing the title. They were expected to be tested Monday night in a matchup against top­seeded Holy Cross but instead, displaying the skill and inten­sity that helped them breeze through the regular season without allowing a goal, they ran away with a 3-0 shutout. 
The game was of particular 
interest because of the seeding 
controversy. Off-Campus was 
regarded by almost everyone 
as the heavy favorite to suc­
cessfully defend the champion­
ship, but Holy Cross received 
the first seed while the Hoobers 
had to settle for the second. 
"I was surprised we were the 
number one seed," said Holy 
Cross captain Jeff Utz. "The Hoobers are the defending champs. NVA probably just flipped a coin." 
For thirty minutes, the con­test did live up to its billing as the teams battled to a scoreless tie at intermission. But after halftime, Off-Campus took con­trol. Tom Keating headed a throw-in past Utz, the Holy Cross keeper, midway through the second half to put the Hoobers on the scoreboard. That goal signaled the begin­ning of the end for Holy Cross, who were never able to regroup and mount an attack on the Hoober goal. 
"We seemed to give up after the first goal," remarked Utz. "That took us out of our game." 
Off-Campus kept the pres­sure on the Holy Cross goal, forcing a defensive error which resulted in the second score. A Holy Cross defender attempted to play the ball back to Utz in goal, but the kick went past him and into the net. The victory was clinched with a minute remaining on an insurance goal by Sean Evers, who headed in a long cross from Jim McKeln. That goal put the finishing touch on the Hoober's best ef­fort of the playoffs. 
"This was the first game we played with great intensity," said Off-Campus coach Dave Thompson. "Before, we could win on skill alone, but against Holy Cross we came to play." 
The loss drops Holy Cross into the loser's bracket, where they will face Zahm, the sixth­seed and surprise of the playoffs. Zahm defeated Flan­ner F.C. 2-1, in overtime, on a pair of goals by Kevin Keeley, both assisted by Steve Barth, for the right to play Holy Cross. The winner of the Holy Cross­Zahm matchup will then move into the final against the Hoobers. 
In the final, Off-Campus will only need to win once to win the championship. However, because of the double-elimina­tion format, the Holy Cross­Zahm winner will need to beat the Hoobers twice for the title. And if the action thus far is any indication, that will be no easy task. 
"We've already beaten both," said Thompson, "and we know what to expect." 

Tennis team wraps up fall season 
By CHRIS FILLIO Sports Writer 

Coach Bob Bayliss of the Notre Dame men's tennis team knew last week that competi­tion in the Rolex Regional Qualifier would be tough. 
Unfortunately, he was right. 
The tournament, held last weekend in Bloomington, pitted Irish hopefuls against strong teams from the Big-10 and Mid-American confer­ences. Six members of the Irish squad entered the singles divi­sion: Paul Daggs, Sean O'Brien, Dave Reiter, Brian Kalbas, Mike Wallace and Ryan Wenger. Reiter teamed with Wallace and Kalbas paired up with Wenger for the doubles com}>etition. 
Daggs was the only member to advance in the singles with a 6-4, 6-1 victory over Cartey Richie of Western Michigan, but then fell to Tim Keller of Miami(Ohio), 2-6, 6-3, 6-4. The doubles division saw Kalbas and Wenger cruise over the team from Eastern Michigan, 6-1, 6-1, only to lose to Akeman and Bendley of Northwestern, 6-3, 6-2 in a see-saw battle. 
After sustaining a slight hand injury in the doubles match Thursday night, Mike Wallace gave eighth-seeded Malivi Washington a tough match before going down 6-1, 6-3, in a contest closer than the final score indicated. 
Nonetheless, the team ends the fall season with optimism. Junior Dave Reiter said that the fall was a: good indicator of upcoming spring competition as well as how much work the team will need. 
"We have some good things going for us-great facilities, good freshmen and a highly motivated coach. Hopefully, the support from the student body will also increase." 
Sean O'Brien regards the construction of the Eck Pavilion as a key to the team's success in his last season with the Irish. 
"The new courts will help us improve with additional prac­tice over the winter. Now we are able to have matches from January to April and also at­tract better schools and players," he said. 
According to Ba~ 'iss, close matches, aggressivt. tactics and tough competitiL 1 were par for the course dur1'lg the past season. However he shares the team's optimisr.·for the spring season. 
"The future looks good," sa1, Bayliss. "We have a great facility, a good administration, and a school that sells itself. Of course academics come first, but there's room for both. We will be there one day." 

Volleyball team falls to W. Michigan 
Special to the Observer 
The Notre Dame women's volleyball team suffered its ninth loss of the season at the hands of the Western Michigan Broncos last night. 
The Irish were swept in three games, 15-4, 15-3, 15-6, to West­ern Michigan, which is cur­rently ranked 15th in the na­tion. 
Seven of Notre Dame's nine losses have come against teams ranked in the top twenty in the nation. With 29 victories and nine losses, the Irish will have a difficult time making the NCAA tournament. 
Maureen Shea led the Irish with 15 kills and six blocks. Zanette Bennett contributed 12 kills and 18 digs, and Jill Suglich added 15 digs. 
Notre Dame was without the services of freshman setter Amy White, who did not make the trip to Western Michigan because of illness. 
This weekend, the team will travel to Chicago to compete in the North Star Conference tour­nanemt. The Irish were unde­feated against North Star op­ponents during the regular season. 
·Pony Express rides again 
Outlined against a blue-gray November sky, the Pony Express rode again. 
In frontier days, that form of communication across the land delivered important messages to men and women of the wilderness. But that was only a preliminary. Today, it has reappeared as the Notre Dame backfield, delivering an important message to Irish opponents, pollsters, and even the omnipresent bowl representatives. 
Notre Dame is for real. 
Grantland Rice may have put it differently when he made another Irish backfield, the Four Horsemen, a house­hold name with his immortal words over sixty years ago, but you get the idea. 

Brian O'Gara 
Irish Items 

No more pussyfooting around. No more having to prove themselves. No more unqualified high national rankings. The Irish football team that beat up on Alabama last Sat­urday deserves to be where it is--en route to a New Year's Day bowl game and still in the chase for an unprecedented eighth national championship. 
Alabama is not a bad football team. Saturday, they were not a bad football team. Then why did the Tide get taken to the cleaners? Because Notre Dame was an awesome football team. They tackled like a top team is supposed too. They blocked like a top team is supposed to. They kicked like a top team is supposed to. And they ran like few other football teams in this country can. No wonder Alabama left Green with envy and Crimson with embar­rassment. 
Junior tailback Mark Green made the Tide his third consecutive victim of 100-yard games on Saturday with 149 yards rushing, including a spectacular 74-yard dash. Not to be outdone, freshman Ricky Watters had a 75-yard romp late in the game. The Pony Express effort of these two, Tony Rice, Tony Brooks, Braxston Banks and Tim Brown has given the Irish an average of 350 yards on the ground in the last five games for 75% of their total yards. 
Any mention of Notre Dame's success running this year is blatantly incomplete without recognizing what may be the best offensive line in the country. Fifth-year seniors Chuck Lanza, Byron Spruell, Tom Rehder and Tom Freeman will be sorely missed when the young Irish run­ning backs return next fall. 
But the most important thing on the minds of the Irish should not be next year, or even January 1. It's next week, and the week after. 
Penn State lost to Pitt last week, 10-0. They are hungry to avenge that loss against anybody, especially Notre 
-Dame, and secure a bid to the Florida Citrus bowl on January 2 against Clemson. And, just as a spirited Irish squad wanted to guarantee a win for the seniors in their last home game, the Nittany Lions are anxious to do the same in their final home contest this Saturday against the Irish. Notre Dame cannot look past Joe Paterno and Com­pany. 
But Coach Paterno and the Lions are targets for the eye of an Irish hurricane that is heading east to College Park then southeast to Miami. 
For the past two years, Notre Dame has been told that it was not good enough to leave home on New Year's Day. Now, Miami is being told that they are too good to leave home on New Year's Day.
