Irish cagers do it: 
ND 71--UCLA 70 
by Vic Dorr Sports Editor 
Who would have thought it possible'? 
Who would have thought that Notre Dame could trail UCLA by 17 points in the first half and then rally in the final20 minutes to hang a 71-70 defeat on the previously­unbeaten Bruins? 
Who would have thought that Notre Dame, still down 11 points with 3:22 remaining in the game, could outscore the Bruins 12-0 during the final moments of the contest to give UCLA its first loss in 89 outings? 
And who would have thought that Dwight Clay and Gary Brokaw, a duo which has successfully worked its magic on opponents such as Marquette, Pittsburgh, and Ohio State, would be able to dazzle John Wooden's defending National Champions in similar fashion? 
Who would have thought it possible? Certainly not Wooden himself. "We certainly didn't figure to lose with three minutes to go and we up by 11 points," he said. 
But they kept at us, and they deserve a tremendous amount of credit for their play. We lost a little of our drive and played &little tqo conservatively at the end, but Notre Dame's man-to-man defense hurt us, their players really hurt us, and their crowd really inspired them." 
_Nor did the Bruin players think it possible. Wooden's line-up, which included All-American Bill Walton, played its game cooly and un­flappably, and not until Notre Dame's John Shumate leapt out of a crowd to pull down the rebound of a last second tip-in try (That was the greatest rebound I ever got," bubbled Shumate in the victorious Irish locker-room) did the spectre of a streak-ending defeat descent upon the poised, confident Bruins. 
But there were believers-both on the Irish bench and in the ACC capacity crowd of 11,343. One of them was Digger Phelps, the Notre Dame coach. 
"We never quit," he said. "We were down 11 when I called time out (with 3:22left to play) and we had to make some changes. We went with our press, putting (Ray) Martin back in instead of <Billy) Paterno. The kids never quit, and it happened for us. For 88 other coaches including myself, it was a great win. 
"And it was especially so for Notre Dame--for everyone in­volved from the coaches, team, school, alumni, and everyone else. I'm sure a lot of people around the country were rooting for Notre Dame today. It's only human nature to want to see the Bruins beaten." 
Another believer was Shumate, 
who made several contributions 
beyond his last-second, game­
ending rebound. "It's the greatest 
feeling of my life," said Shue, who 
finished the game with 24 points and 11 rebounds. "I knew we could make a game of it if we stuck with it, and we did. 
"I was just trying to do what I do best, and all I asked during the game was that I not lose con­fidence in myself or my team­mates. I knew we had to have faith." 
But faith alone wasn't enough to offset the Bruins' awesome first­half shooting display. The Uclans shot 70 per cent from the floor during the first 20 minutes, and with 6:02 remaining in the half found themselves leading by 17 points after Bill Walton bounded over Shumate to drop in a lob-pass basket. 
But Walton's score triggered an Irish spurt, and some four minutes later Shun1ate beat Walton inside to cut the spread to seven, 39-32. Billy Paterno's 25 footer cut it to five with 49 seconds left in the half·, but at string of four unanswered free throws sent UCLA off at halftime in possession of a 43-34 lead. 
Phelps changed the offensive complexion of the game at half­time by electing to go with his "speed team "--Brokaw, Clay, Martin, Shumate, and Adrian Dantley--but the Irish made no attempt to alter their man-to-man defense. 
"Why should we change?" asked Phelps afterwards. "There's not much you're going to do about a 70

Union director Bohlander~ faces short, busy term 
by Gregg B. Bangs Staff Reporter 
New student union director Pete Bohlander has only a short term ahead of him but it's a busy one. 
Bohlander, a senior chemistry major, took over the reins of the Student Union immediately after Rybarczyk resigned. He was not, however, in the dark on how to run the post of student union director. "We knew all along that Jim was going to leave (not necessarily because of the ticket scandal) so he had been working with me all along. I pretty much knew what to do when he finally did leave." 
It may sound ironic that one of the first responsibilities Bohlander has to live up to is preparing someone to take his place come April 1. Bohlander said that a list of people was being considered for the post and a co-director would be chosen from them. This co­director would take over Bohlander's position April 1 and hold it the rest of the spring semester as well as the ensuing academic year. 
As far as plans for this year go, Bohlander doesn't plan to make any drastic changes. "Our first concern is to make sure that the

Sorin party penalties relaxed 
by Jack d'Aurora Staff Reporter 
The three Sorin Hall students responsible for an allegedly out of hand party the night of September 21 are now allowed to go to athletic events but will have to work for 25­30 hours apiece. 
This change of disciplinary action from Dean of Students John Macheca 's original decision to deny them attendance to athletic events came as a result of an appeals court's recommendation that he review the case at the beginning of the second semester. 
The students, Chris Oberhardt, Bill Oberhardt and Terry Cavanaugh, had waved their right to go before the Judicial Board, deciding to let Macheca judge their case. Approximately one week after receiving the Dean's decision, they decided on October 7 to appeal their case. Thus they were put on probation with no interim measures taken. 
The appeals court met 
December 6 and affirmed 
Macheca 's original punishment of 
denial of attendance at athletic 
events for the remainder of the 
first semster, but recommended 
that he review the case at the 
beginning of the second semester. 
The reason for the delay of the 
hearing is the S.L.C.'s slowness in 
assembling an appeals court. 
Grounds for appeal were 
twofold. First the students 
believed they had suffered undue 
process of law. "Dean Macheca 
persuaded the three of us to place 
ourselves in his hands for 
judgment and sentencing. We 
were under the impression that 
other avenues open to us were 
more risky and less desirable," 
according to their written 
statement. 
Mardi Gras comes off all right," 
he said, "and basically carry through on what has already been planned for this year." 
However, before these events take place, there has to be enough money in the budget to cover them. 
Bohlander and his staff will attempt to make money to cover debts and try to raise enough funds to stabilize the budget. 
When asked what events had~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
been successes thus far, Bohlander thought that the Homecoming Dance, the Armory Party and the train trip to New Orleans (barring Amtrak's con­tributions) had been worthwhile ventures. He mentioned that he would like to sponsor another Armory party this semester. 
He also mentioned that he would like to see the Student Government and Student Union work more closely with each other. To achieve this, these two organizations will be meeting frequently throughout the semester. Bohlander seemed enthusiastic about this develop­ment, thinking that it would help promote student activities. 
With working on the budget, Mardi Gras, interaction with the Student Government and training a new director, Bohlander's seemingly short term will be concerned with quite a number of events. It is Bohlander's hope that everything will go smoothly . 
Two more years 
President Nixon begins his sixth 1 year as President today. 
Secondly, they believed that deprivation of attendance at athletic events "is to severely limit our social life in an already limited atmosphere." 
Upon beginning the preceedings the plaintiffs were informed that they would have to decide which was more important. The court could only decide on one appeal; they chose the latter. 
The major problem concerning the case is the discrepencies in regard to "what one saw and what actually happened," remarked Macheca. Sorin's rector, Fr. Richard Zang, reported that there were about 80 people in the hallway, with an unknown number drinking. An R.A. cited the number nearer 50. Zang also complained that there was no attempt to keep the crowd inside the room. An R.A. stated that there was a "serious attempt to keep tbe party under control." 

Allegedly people were drinking beer from bottles and cans. Ac­cording to Oberhardt, "If there was anybody drinking from cans or bottles, they weren't from our party. We served everybody beer in cups." A second party was going on elsewhere in the Hall at this time. 
Oberhardt added, "We crammed everybody into the room after the first complaint," referring to R.A. John DiPietro's first warning. "I saw no more than 7 or 8 people in the hallway with beer," he con­tinued.

The Calendar Vote 
The Academic Council is one of the truly important legislative bodies on campus because they are respon­sible for the academic codes and regulations at the university. In­cluded in that responsibility is their duty to set the limitations within which the university administration can schedule their academic calendar. The council voted to drop the limitation which prevented the academic year from beginning before Labor Day. Now that that 
,.. 
limitation has been removed, the 
administration has scheduled 
classes to begin prior to Labor Day. 
The furor that arose after the calendar was announced was widespread. Students, over 75 per cent of them in a poll, stated their opposition to the early start. Discontent was obvious in the faculty. Yet, the calendar stood firm. Fr. Burtchaell insisted throughout that the new schedule would stay and rationalized that no calendars are popular when first announced. Burtchaell's attitudes seemed throughout the crisis to also become the attitudes of many of the members of the council who ap­peared to be acting in blind ignorance of the discontent that their resolution caused. 
Finally, the council has responded to the voices that have been raised. Ten members of the group have petitioned for a rehearing on the calendar issue and they should be praised for being responsive to the people of this campus. Too often the Academic Council is locked into their private sessions and lose their grasp of the fact that they are legislating for the people who work and study here and that they, as any other legislator, are responsible to their constituency. 
What to do? 
There are a couple of things that need to happen before Thursday's meeting of the Academic Council. First, the Faculty Senate meets Tuesday and it is their responsibility to pass a motion stating their displeasure with the pre-Labor Day beginning. Their strength allied with that of the students could be a crucial factor in overturning the calendar. If the Senate can pass such a resolution and the faculty members of the council overlook the stance of their colleagues, then they are clearly are being negligent in their responsibility. 
Sec-ond, the students must work for a calendar change. Right now, the best way to do that is to consult with the faculty and administr,ati(Jin members of the Academic Council. 
Talk with them and show them that not only are we upset with the new calendar but we have rational reasons to be upset. 
The vote comes Thursday and the calendar must be changed. There is still time to chage it for next year despite Fr. Burtchaell's arguing to the contrary. Just remember, a few years ago at approximately this same point in time, a complete merger of schools was called off. The one stumbling block to changing the calendar for next year is that the motion to re-institute the block of a pre-Labor Day opening for the 1974­75 school year can be tabled in the legislative session. Burtchaell is rumored to be contemplating that. If the motion is tabled, at least we know where the impetus to squealch the rehearing of the calendar for next year carne from.

Last semester a student in Dillon Hall was suspended for violating parietal regulations and violating the University's rule on human sexuality. Some of the curious facts surrounding the incident bear closer scrutiny. 
First is the charge itself. Cer­tainly, there are many known parietal violations every weekend, and there must be hundreds more that are unknown. Therefore, the extremely harsh nature of his penalty leads one to conclude that it was mainly directed at his violation of the sexuality rule, not parietals. (The student in question never denied having had sex with his lover, his freiends say that his personal integrity made it im­possible for him to lie -a lie which probably would have saved him.) 
What is the University's rule on sexuality? Have you ever heard of it? I haven't, but apparently there really is one on the books somewhere. I'm told that what it says, basically, is : no sex until you're married, gang. Not on our campus anyway. Why'? Because it's immoral. 
In a long talk with Dean Macheca two days ago, I asked him whether or not the University regards the problem of morality as a personal philosophic question instead of a set list of rules and regulations. Well yes, he said, morality is a personal thing; but then he proceeded to ramble on about parameters of behavior that the University has established in 
light of its own moral code etc. etc. It was a long vague reply but what it boiled down to is : you may have your morality but we have ours, and while you're here you do it our way or not at all. 

This is a pretty heavy line. It's bad enough that the Burtchaell­Macheca teams atavistic vision of "morality" bears a sickening resemblance to the Nixon-Mitchell team's delusions of law and order, but what's worse is that they are going to ram it down our throats in the same self-righteous manneras those creeps in the White House tried to do. 
But this shouldn't be surprising, no more than Watergate was. Mter all, this is a "Christian" university. Despite what Christ is supposed to have said, legislation of morality and enforcement thereof has long been a solidly "Christian" endeavor -from the Spanish Inquisition to the hotbed of anti-abortion zealotry that exists on this campus today. 
And to speak of enforcement of morality leads us to the second outrage of the case, namely, the blatant snooping actions of our esteemed provost. It seems that he went to the room in question ­notwithstanding the fact that the student lived on the second floor and Burtchaell was the third floor RA and found the door locked. He then opened it with his pass-key ("He knocked first," says Macheca) and really got the goods on this heinous sinner. Not only were the beds pushed together ( ! ! ) but there was a woman's clothing lying around (! ! ! ) . 
And this, we are told, are ac­tions of a "Christian" doing his duty to the University .. and to God Almighty, I suppose. 
But this is getting off the track. As I say, none of this should come as any surprise to anyone. The University's heavy handedness is a well~stablished fact and is their perfect legal right, this being a private institution. They are the first to tell you that it's their ball­game and if you don't like it you can leave. 
But what was surprising was the incredibly condescending attitudes displayed by the University of­ficials. The student told me that, to him, and I agree, the most in­credible thing about the whole affair was that Burtchaell and Macheca really seemed to believe that this was all done for his own good. This will make a man out of you, son with a pat on the head. Macheca calls it "rehabilitative discipline." 

CQme on, John. You don't try to "rehabilitate" well-respected honor students with clean records. Hell no, you should be out rehabilitating prowlers and peeping Toms that sneak into other people's rooms. These are the real perverts. They are the ones whose souls are in big trouble. 
There are other aspects of the case that should be dealt with in greater length, things like the curious stiffening of the penalty that caused the student to have to fly back to this doomed sinkhole of a university just after having left. But later for that. I'm getting too distressed just dwelling on it all to write any more. 
Don't get caught screwing around, fellow .. Domers. It's against the rules.

way that ·belies the truth of their words.'' However, Macheca stated, "I feel it was their intention to have a private party but things escalated." 
The complaint was signed by the Sorin Hall staff, but as DiPietro stated, "the complaint, as far as I was concerned, was just stating a technical violation of the rule prohibiting people from drinking in the halls. The sentence is ex­cessive," referring to the student's original denial of attendence at athletic events. 
"It seems to me that the word of one person is being taken over everybody elses. Our R.A. and hall president disagreed with the complaint," said Payne. 
Oberhardt added that "at no' 
time were we confronted with pir accuser Zang. That right is stated in the handbook, and we weren't granted it. That is only one out of seven rights of a total of 16 student rights in disciplinary action that we failed to see." 
The same night this party was held a second allegedly out of hand party was being hosted by Sorin Hall student Mike Bonnifer. Bonnifer decided to go before the Judicial Bo ard, his case being heard December 14 and 16. He stated "I was found guilty of violating University rules con­cerning alcoholic beverages.

Scott: 'Let it all hang out' 
WASHINGTON <UPI>--8enate Republican Leader Hugh Scott said Sunday he has some in­formation on which President Nixon could be "exculpated en­tirely" or wrongdoing in the Watergate affair. He urged Nixon to "let it all hang out." 
But Scott, who met with the President Friday at the White House, said he has been unable to "break through the shell down there of all his advisers who feel differently about it, who feel that the President no longer needs to make some of these replies. 
"I have found nothing that in­dicates any guilt on the part of the President of a nature that would be impeachable," the Pennsylvania Republican said. "But I think they'd help themselves if they told the public some of the things that I know." 
Asked why the White House has not made such information public, Scott said: "God knows. I don't know. I've tried." 
Scott was interviewed on CBS­TV's Face the Nation. 
" ... The President has a better defense than he's made, and it's very frustrating in trying to get him to make it," Scott said. 
"I have the feeling and in­formation available to me, and I wouldn't want you to misinterpret how complete that is, that would indicate that on specific items the President would be exculpatedentirely." 
On the matter of the missing 18lh minutes from one of the President's crucial Watergate­related tapes, Scott said: 
"I can say quickly that I have advised the President to let it all hang out. I did advise him on Friday that as to this erasure, I hope the FBI would discover who did it and that he would authorize a complete and thorough in­vestigation of everybody who could have had anything to do with it. 
"I have had some information which is not yet public which is 
Psychology Society organized 
The Psychology Society has recently been formed at Notre Dame .In the past,there has been a lack of undergraduate in­volvement in the activities of the Psychology Department. This has been due to the absence of a vehicle for organizing and chan­neling student interest. The purpose of the Society is to provide a means through which those undergraduates interested in, or majoring in psychology can pursue their interests in an organized way. The Society hopes to help provide for the personal, social, educational, and career needs of these students. 
In order to achieve these ob­jectives, the society has been organized with five basic com­mittees: academic, career, governance, advisory, and social. Each committee is headed by a chairman and has one represen­
tative to the main cabinet which 
serves as the governing body of the 
Bowl rerun 
considered 
by Jane Cannon Staff Reporter 

Notre Dame Publicity Director Dick Conklin has announced the possibility of another rebroadcast of the Sugar Bowl game. . 
The national championship game has already been on the air four times. Area television stations WSJV-TV and WNDU-TV have both telecast the game twice. Students who attended the game in New Orleans have expressed a desire to see the replay as many had not yet returned from vacation at the time of the rebroadcasts. 
Don Fuller, general manager of 
WSJV-TV doesn't know if there 
will be a rebroadcast on his 
station. Although there is no 
problem in obtaining the necessary 
permission from ABC and the 
Sugar Bowl Committee, Fuller 
sees a problem of time. It would 
take three hours, uninterrupted by 
commercials, to replay the game, 
and Fuller can't seem to work it 
into an already busy broadcast 
schedule. 
Fuller explained that it would be 
possible to release the tape for a 
close circuit showing in the ACC. 
The problem again, is finding a 
time most convenient for students 
to view the replay. 
On the question of a replay on 
WNDU-TV, the University owned 
station, Mr. O'Hagen, vice­
president, stated, "I don't know 
anything about it. There's none 
scheduled on our station. There 
may be one scheduled on WSJV." 
organization. The society has one undergraduate representative to the main cabinet which serves as the governing body of the organization. 
The society has one un­dergraduate representative to the psychology department faculty meetings who will provide a student voice in faculty meetings decisions and policy making. This representative will be the coor­dinator of the main cabinet although he is not allowed to vote in faculty meetings. 
· The Society is also sponsoring an election for a second student representative. This represen­taative need not be a member of the society. He must, however, be a psychology major (declared or intended). His duties are primarily the same as the other representatives except he is allowed to vote on issues presented at the faculty meetings.

Irish icers split with No. 1 Tech 
by Jo~n Fineran 

Michi'gan Tech was made painfully aware that it doesn't pay to be ranked number-one in the nation and have to play Notre Dame. The Huskies lost, 7-1, Friday evening, and if their top ranking was tarnished by the score, it certainly was rebuffed Saturday evening as they defeated the Irish, 7-5. 
The split catipulted the Huskies into a first-place tie with Denver in the WCHA while the Irish remained in seventh place. However, only 12 points separate the league's 10 teams as both Duluth and North Dakota fashioned sweeps over Denver and Colorado College. 
"Friday night was a real satisfying win for us," Notre Dame's Lefty Sm-ith said. "Saturday, however, we played very poor defensively. 
"They may have had more shots Friday, but we got the good breaks and created them through good hustle." 
Indeed, the Irish did hustle on 
Friday night, and the hustle of 
Notre Dame was evident most 
notably in the play of reserve 
center, senior Mike Tardani. 
The 5-8 Muskegon, Michigan native is more noted for his thrilling work on Notre Dame's shorthanded team. However, with Brian Walsh out with an injury, Smith used Tardani between fresh­men Clark Hamilton and Alex Pirus. 
The substitution immediately 
paid dividends as Steve Curry scored into an empty net after Tardaniand Pirus had succeeded to fake Tech goalie, Rick Quance, out of position. Pirus got another first period goal which counterbalanced 
Mike Usitalo's goal for Tech. 
The Irish added two goals in the 
second period for a 4-1lead. First, 
Larry Israelson somehow 
shovelled the puck behind Quance 
from a bad angle at 4:10, and next, 
Ray DeLorenzi scored on the 
powerplay at 8:55. 
However, at 10:06, while skating 
on his regular shift, Tardani was 
hit by a s!apshot in the head. As he into a wide-open net at 19:34 for a 5­2 Tech advantage, but Ray DeLorenzi, with a beautiful feed from Israelson, forced it under Quance with five seconds left in the period for a 5-3 second stanza score. 
Mike Usitalo upped it to 6-3 as he wasunguarded in the slot at 2:45, but Steve Curry, on the powerplay, and Ian Williams scored within 18 seconds to bring the score to 6-5 with 4:16left. 
Notre Dame came alive, and almost tied the score when Pat Conroy just missed with a slap­shot. It was another defensive lapse, however, which gave the Huskies the final goal of the game at 17:49. 
Lorne Stamler was left un­checked in front and, after taking a quick feed from Bill Steele, fired the puck past Kronbholm. The self-disgust of the Irish players was quite apparent, especially in the face of Tardani. Although Smith pulled Kronholm for the sixth attacker, it took two brilliant saves by DeLorenzi in the Irish crease to avert another Huskie goal. 
Tech coach John Macinnes joked before Friday's contest that the Irish, now 9-12-1 overall, were number one. "Notre Dame beat and tied us on our ice, so that makes them No. 1. Right?" 
Saturday, however, Macinnes played superbly, making 44 saves, easily could have prevented. put the disappointing season for many of them brilliant, 16 more Jim Murray put Michigan Tech the Irish into proper perspective. than the Tech netminder. ahead 1-0 at 2:58 when his shot "If it wasn't for us, I think Notre
