S.B. police chase n1an to can1pus 
Man in possession of cocaineflees from road 
By JOSEPH McMAHON Assistant News Editor 
Police continued search­ing for a man who fled from his vehicle on the Toll Road and eluded 
police  during  a  chase  
through  Notre  Dame's  
eampus  early  Sunday  
morning.  
A  traffie  seanner  

described the man as a black male wearing a white shirt and he was said to be in possession of about three grams of cocaine. 
According to the South Bend Tribune, the Indiana State Police conducted a comprehensive search of the area, including using a K-9 unit, to traek the sus­pect. The man was last seen near the Morris Inn. 
Phil Johnson, director of Notre Dame Security Police (NDSPI said NDSP assisted in the search, but refused to eomment fur­ther. 
"We were asked to assist another police agency and offered that assistance in looking for someone who had fled from them," he said. "That person was not located. [Any more infor­mation] would have to be gotten from the Indiana State Police."

Sorin's disposition is sunnier than 
Honolulu on Tuesdays in July between 
the hours of four and seven in the 
afternoon. 
But our good nature has its limits. There are those on this campus who would take advantage of our kindly disposition to usurp our property and sully our reputation. They attack our very way of life and openly disdain those virtues we hold dear. They have committed egregious offenses directed at Sorin College for generations, with no signs of stopping and without action on our behalf. 
There comes a time in 1wery Ottnr's life whern he must stand up and fight for that in which he believes, though lw might not understand it. That time is now (actually two days ago, but this is the earliest we could get it in The Observer). 
No longer will we be held prisoner to the whims of a dictatorial regime sim­ply out of our own chivalry and love of lazing around tlw house. While they have tho advantage of numbers, we are superior to them in experience, wisdom, and swimming abilities. 
There will be casualties: dignities will bn crushed, fnelings tweaked. and maybe evnn a few contusions. But can wn go on living as we live now'? Going through our daily routines as if noth­ing is wrong, while knowing all the while of the wholesale oppression of our people being perpetrated by a group of smelly girls? 
They must see the consequences. They must see what they get. They rn ust see what they get when they mess with the otters. And though they might be wild women, we are scream­ing otters. And otters never give up. 
Our resolve will be put to the test, but we shall prevail over the tyranny we face. 
And then we shall dance. 

With this document, therefore. we men of Sorin College hereby declare war on Walsh Hall. 
Premier Soriano will be given all chances to yield sovereignty, but this cession need be timely (and for our own purposes, only digital clocks will be used). At 0900 hours tomorrow (that means sometime around noon, if you can't read army time), vanguard forces will mobilize, and the annexa­tion of' Walsh Hall will be inevitable, unstoppable, irreversible, unceasing, and kind of sexy... in an otter kind of way. 
In closing, please understand that we are really. really serious and if you don't believe us, you should ask some­body from Sorin.

Man declared dead feels 'pretty good' 
OKlAHOMA CITY -Four months after he was declared brain dead and doc­tors were about to remove his organs for transplant, Zach Dunlap says he feels "pretty good." 
Dunlap was pronounced dead Nov. 19 at United Regional Healthcare System in Wichita Falls, Texas, after he was injured in an all-ter­rain vehicle accident. His family approved having his organs harvested. 
As family members were paying their last respects, he moved his foot and hand. He reacted to a pocketknife scraped across his foot and to pressure applied under a fingernail. After 48 days in the hospital, he was allowed to return home, where he continues to work on his recovery. 
On Monday, he and his family were in New York, appearing on NBC's "Today." 
"I feel pretty good. but it's just hard ... just ain't got the patience," Dunlap told NBC.

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 
Spanish, Sociology clubs ask for trip funds 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY 
News Writer 
Two co-sponsorships were presented at the Saint Mary's Board of Governance (BOG) meeting Tuesday ~vening as representatives from the Sociology Department and Spanish Club attended the meeting to ask BOG to help fund some of their upcoming events 
Nicole Loughridge, a senior in the sociology department, asked for money to help fund attendance for her and four students at the North Central Sociology Association (NCSA) Conference, March 27-29 in Cincinnati, Ohio, with three other seniors. Three of the stu­dents are going to present their senior comprehensives, two of which have already won prizes. 
"That is exciting for Saint Mary's as a whole," Loughridge said. 
The seniors will be showing their comprehensives to sociol­ogy professionals and students from colleges from seven differ­ent states in the Midwest. 
Since 2004, Saint Mary's has been awarded the first, second or third place prize, Loughridge said. The women attending want to gain recognition for Saint Mary's 
Junior Spanish Club treasurer Becca Mason was also at Tuesday's meeting in search of funds for a symposium the club is setting up for gender bias. The symposium will take place on Oct. 2-3. 
The club will be showing a film on the first day along with several guest speakers on both days. Professors from Rutgers University and Ohio State, as well as professors from Saint Mary's, will speak. Topics will range from the effect the Iraq war has on women, the dis­placement of women in Africa and the trafficking of women in Eastern Europe, Mason said. 
In other BOG news: 
+Mickey Gruscinski, the stu­dent body president-elect, and Sarah Falvey, the student body vice president-elect attended the meeting in preparation for the turnover at next Tuesday's meeting. 
+Cassie Quaglia, president of the Residence Hall Association, said Le Mans Hall will be selling sweatshirts in the Student Center Atrium during lunch and dinner. 
+Student body president Kim Hodges said there will be birth­day cake in the Student Center Atrium Wednesday at 11 a.m. through lunch for Feb. and March birthdays. Everyone is welcome to help themselves.

Barnes agreed with her and said that she has already begun to share her experiences with her Critical Issues in Mass Communications course. 
"We all definitely plan on implementing what we learned at Saint Mary's," Barnes said. ''I'm talking to my class about what I observed about the media in Dubai." 
Each of the women who attended the conference are applicants for the new CWIL Certificate for Intercultural Learning which debuted this year. 
"For the last couple years we've really been developing the structure and process [of the certificate]," said Evans, who is also one of the key leaders of the program. The leaders did work on the cer­tificate for about two years until they were ready to run what she called a "pilot year." 
Participants of the pro­gram are required to attend a kick-off retreat, peer-men­toring meetings, advising meetings, the capstone retreat, and mentoring meetings with an interna­tional leader and a local commu·nity leader. There is also a study abroad require­ment, 50 hours of communi­ty-based service required, and a catalyst trip, also according to the certificate's Web site. 
All this must then be included in an inclusive leadership project and final­ly in the e-portfolio, accord­ing to the Web site. The portfolio highlights students' experiences studying abroad, reflection papers, power points, video clips, and digital essays, Evans said. 
"It's the idea that they're practicing their leadership and they're practicing the through several documents that the group read. 
Barnes said the group also talked to the mother of another Saint Mary's student who is from Morocco. 
"[The mother] talked to us about the culture and taught us basic Arabic phrases, which was so helpful," she said. "When we were in Dubai, we knew what to expect a lot of the time because of all the advice she gave us." 
Barnes said she learned a lot at the conference but the most important thing she learned was to try to be

"This group of students got together and decided that they wanted to go to the conference," Evans said. "It was not paid for by the [cer­tificate] program at all." 
The group received most of its funding from CWIL, but also wrote grant proposals to the Board of Governance and Student Diversity Board. 
Rodriguez said it took a couple of months to prepare for the trip because they had to get the grants in order and then study the culture and language of Dubai

At least 9 killed in drug shootout 
GUATEMALA CITY --Police say at least nine people have been killed and seven wounded in a shootout in eastern Guatemala that is likely tied to drug traffickers. 
Interior Ministry spokesman Ricardo Gatica Trejo says the nine people killed were apparent­ly ambushed Tuesday in the town ofTeculutan. 
Trejo says police have arrested three Mexicans and three Guatemalans who were carrying an arsenal of automatic rifles and grenades near the shootout. Investigators are still trying to determine if those arrested are linked to the attack. 
Saudi king calls for religious dialogue 
RIYADH --The Saudi king has made an impassioned plea for dialogue among Muslims, Christians and Jews --the first such proposal from a nation with no diplomatic ties to Israel and a ban on non-Muslim religious services and symbols. 
The message from King Abdullah, which was welcomed by Jewish, Christian and Muslim leaders, comes at a time of stalled peace initia­tives and escalating tensions in the region. 
Muslims have been angered by cartoons pub­lished in European papers seen as insulting the Prophet Muhammad and by the pope's baptiz­ing on Easter of a Muslim journalist who had conv1~rtcd to Catholicism. 
The arrests ended an ordeal that began Monday morning with a botched bank robbery in this town southeast of Caracas. The hostage standoff at the Banco Provincial branch was the longest in at least a decade in Venezuela.had stopped active work on a nuelear weapons program in 2003.

ALAMOSA, Colo. --Crews started pump­ing chlorine through this southern Colorado city's water system Tuesday to rid it of salmonella bacteria that has sickened nearly 250 people. 
Residents will not be able to drink the water until the last of the disinfecting chemical washes out of the water system, possibly a couple of weeks, officials said. Bathing with it may be allowed within a couple of days. 

Dozens seriously injured in train crash 
CANTON, Mass. --A train car loaded with lumber hit a stationary commuter train during the Tuesday afternoon rush hour, injuring dozens of people, authorities said. 
About 50 people reported mostly minor injuries, and 10 passengers and crew mem­bers were taken to hospitals, said Scott Farmelant, a spokesman for Massachusetts Bay Commuter Rail. He said he did not know the extent of those injuries. 
The commuter train's locomotive was not moving when it was hit by a CSX freight car that had rolled from a branch onto a main track south of Boston, said Joe Pesaturo, spokesman for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. The com­muter train's engineer was among those injured, he said.

IN BRIEF 
Fed auctions $50 billion to ease crisis 
WASHINGTON -Fighting to ease a dan­gerous credit crisis, the Federal Reserve has provided a total of $260 billion in short­term loans to squeezed banks since December to help them overcome credit problems. 
The central bank on Tuesday announced the results of its most recent auction -the eighth since the program started in December -where commercial banks bid to get a slice of $50 billion in short-term loans. 
It's part of an ongoing effort by the central bank to provide relief to a spreading credit crunch that has unnerved financial markets. The situation threatens to push the country into a deep recession. Counting the latest auction results announced Tuesday, the Fed has provided a total of $260 billion in short­term loans to banks since December. 
In the most recent auction -which marked the eighth -commercial banks paid an interest rate of 2.615 percent, the lowest rate for any of the auctions of this kind conducted so far. 
Housing price drop continues trend 
NEW YORK -llome prices plunged by record levels in January from a year ago, with almost no major cities immune from the spiraling market. Analysts worried that even the usually reliable spring selling sea­son would fall 11at. 
The closely watched Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index of home prices in 20 cities fell nearly 11 percent in January from a year earlier, the biggest drop in its two-decade history. 
Prices were down about 20 percent in Las Vegas and Miami, both paying the price for especially rampant speculation and too much new construction during the housing boom. Fourteen other cities posted record deelines in the Tuesday report. 
The only bright spot was a 1.8 porcent increase in Charlotte, N.C., when~ real estate agents say prices rose more modest­ly during the boom years and the regional economy is relatively strong.

Argentina fanners prolong strike 
President vows to not give into concessions on 45 percent export tax hike 
Associated Press 
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina President Cristina Fernandez refused to ease tax hikes on agricul­tural exports Tuesday, fac­ing down angry farmers embroiled a nationwide strike that has all but halted production in one of the world's biggest beef-export­ing nations. 
At least 9,000 cattle nor­mally enter this capital's sprawling stockyard each day for slaughter, yet not a single animal arrived this week due to the farm and ranch strike, the largest in decades. 
South America's second­largest economy -a lead­ing exporter of soybeans, beef and wheat -is in full farmbelt rebellion over a new sliding-scale increase in export taxes. Soybean taxes are being hiked from 35 percent to 45 percent, with smaller increases on corn and other farm products.

According to Lucke, South Bend also plans to invest money in coming years for a facility for nanoelectric com­mercialization in the city where the old Studebaker car manufaeturing buildings once stood. 
"This is a great opportuni­ty for new companies to come set up shop in South Bend," Lucke said. lie added the initiative could add jobs in the South Bend area. 
Brown said South Bend had long pondered the future of the site of what was once South Bend's most lucrative industry. 
"The big question has been, 'What can we do with these old buildings?"' Brown said. 
Bernhard described nan­oteehnology as an up and coming field necessary for the updating of computer systems. 
"Inside a computer, a lot of things are being stored in memory," Bernhard said. "Calculations are being done with bits and they use lots of devices called transistors."

we see something opposing it, we have to speak out." 
"Notre Dame is an icon of Catholic education in America," said Ritchie, explaining the group's motivation in targeting Notre Dame for protest. 
"We're protesting the play at every Catholic campus where it's being held," Ritchie added. 
The Vagina Monologues used to be performed at 36 Catholic campuses and is now only per­formed at 19, Ritchie said, citing protests as a factor that caused several universities to cancel the play. 


Families unsure of Virginia Tech settlement 
Associated Press 
RICHMOND -Those close to the victims of the Virginia Tech mass shootings offered mixed reactions Tuesday to a pro­posed multimillion-dollar state settlement and whether it will properly honor their loved ones. 
Families of the victims have until Monday to say whether they'll accept the settlement, which would give $100,000 to representatives of each of the 32 killed and ensures that families will have the chance to talk to the governor and university officials about the shootings. 
Under the proposal, a copy of which was obtained by. The Associated Press, $800,000 would be available to injured victims. They and the families of those killed could seek addi­tional money from a $1.75 mil­lion hardship fund. 
Roger O'Dell, whose son Derek was among two dozen wounded April 16, said while he considers the proposal a very reasonable offer, he is concerned about how the money would be split among the survivors. The proposal only states that the money would be distributed "based on a matrix acceptable to the commonwealth, with a maxi­mum payment of $100,000 to any individual." 
''I'm inclined to believe this will not be settled by April 

The protesters held signs with slogans such as, "Honk ifyou are against the V-Monologues at NO." Over a dozen passing cars honked over the course of fifteen minutes. One woman leaned out her window and called 'Thank you" to the protesters. A younger man shouted "Freedom of speech" as he drove past. 
This protest was in no way affiliated with any campus groups or anyone from Notre Dame. 
"I didn't know anything about this protest," said Mary Kate Da1y, a Notre Dame student who is involved in organizing students opposed to the presence of the Vagina Monologues on campus. 
'"I agree with their reasons for not supporting the Monologues 


15th," O'Dell said. "I think there are too many question marks in the proposed offer." 
Seung-Hui Cho, a mentally disturbed student, killed two people in a dormitory just after 7 a.m. University oflicials did not send an e-mail alert until more than two hours later -just before Cho killed 30 others in a classroom build­ing across campus and then committed suicide. 
Twenty-two families have filed notice with the state that they may sue. They have until April 16 to file. Families of all deceased victims and the sur­vivors would be eligible for a payout under the settlement. 
By accepting the proposal, family members would give up the right to sue the state gov­ernment; Virginia Tech; the town of Blacksburg, where Virginia Tech is located; Montgomery County; and the New River Valley Community Services Board, which pro­vides mental-health services in the area. 
Cho had been ruled a danger to himself during a court com­mitment hearing in 2005 and was ordered to receive outpa­tient mental health care. He never received the treatment. 
Diane Strollo, whose daugh­ter Hilary was shot three times but is back at Virginia Tech, said she believed the negotia­tions were ongoing. 
"The families want account­ability, justice and change," on campus," she said of the protest. But Daly said student protests will be different. 
"Today's protest is more con­frontational, much more vocal," she said. "Ours is more of a 'silent witness' to a particular standpoint. We hope to give a message to the administration about our disappointment that they are allowing the Monologues to be on campus for seven out of the past eight years." 
Daly said that she also wants students to start to think about the play beeause of the protests. 
"We also hope to get students to think about this play," said Daly. "Mainly, though, we are sending a message to the University that it's not a particu­lar group, but rather a student contingent that is opposed to the Monologues on campus." 

Daly said that students' rea­sons for protesting are similar to those that motivated the TFP. 
"It is a disgusting, vile play that does nothing to promote the dig­nity of women. It's also degrading to men since it eneourages disre­spect of' women," said Daly citing the Theology of the Body and John Paul ll's apostolic letter as "better ways to approach the topic" whieh the Monologues address. 
"This play only inspires more anger, more hurt. It really doesn't accomplish what it intends," she said.

she said. "We have yet to see it." 
O'Dell said there is no con­sensus among the families regarding the offer, though many feel it's "good in a num­ber of respects." 
"It's totally across the board as to how people feel. Some people feel that there is no wrongdoing and therefore there's no obligation by the state or the university to be paying anybody anything," O'Dell said. "At the other end, there's some who feel that this agreement -proposed settle­ment agreement -doesn't go nearly far enough and there needs to be much more money put into it." 
The total cost of the pro­posed settlement, including attorneys' fees and a $1.75 million fund for charities, comes to about $8.5 million, plus the cost of reimbursing and paying for medical and psychological treatment for victims' families and survivors. 
In October, the families and surviving victims received pay­ments ranging from $11,500 to $208,000 from the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund, set up in the days after the shootings to handle donations that poured into the school. 
In contrast to the Virginia Tech shootings, attorneys say there is little to indicate law­suits might be pending against Northern Illinois University over its response to a Feb. 14 attack on campus. In that case, former student Steven Kazmierczak, 27, opened fire in a lecture hall, killing five people before killing himself. 

Chicago attorney Kathleen Zellner, who has won several high-prol1le lawsuits, said the sehool might avoid being sued because there's no indication of glaring shortcomings in its security response. 
Police entered the NIU lec­ture hall just minutes after the shooting began, and the school launched its emergency alert system -sending out e-mails and posting messages on Web sites to notify students a possi­ble gunman was on campus ­before authorities could con­firm the gunman acted alone and was dead. 
Attorney Michael Helfand, who monitors Chicago's legal scene for an online lawyers referral service, said attorneys would have been hotly pursing NIU lawsuits weeks ago if they thought they could win one. 
There doesn't appear to be talk about a settlement in NIU's case similar to the one being offered in the Virginia Tech case. 
"We have not had any such discussions," NIU spokes­woman Melanie Magara said Tuesday. 
She referred other questions to the school's legal depart­ment. Messages left at the offiee were not returned Tuesday afternoon.

PAKISTAN 
NeW" pri111e 111inister takes office 
Yousaf Raza Gilani calls for a change in Musharraf's military policy 
Associated Press 
ISLAMABAD -A key figure in Pakistan's new government told two top U.S. envoys on Tuesday there needs to be a change in President Pervez Musharrafs policy of using the power of the army against Islamic militants. 
The call came as a new prime minister, Yousaf Raza GHani, took office, closing the book on eight years of military rule. 
President Bush phoned Gilani after his swearing-in and invited him to Washington at his convenience. Gilani's office quoted the new premier as saying Pakistan would "con­tinue to fight terrorism." 
But it was clear Pakistan's civilian rulers are rethinking counterterrorism strategy, amid concern that use of mili­tary force against al-Qaida and Taliban has provoked a bloody militant backlash. 
Partners in the incoming coalition government have said they would negotiate with some militant groups -an approach that has drawn criti­cism from Washington, the source of about $10 billion in aid to Pakistan since it joined the war on terror in 2001. 
Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte and Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia Richard Boucher held a flurry of meetings with Pakistani leaders Tuesday. 
Their first talks were with former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was ousted in Musharrafs 1999 coup and is now demanding the president's resignation. 
Sharif said he told the American envoys there was "no longer a one-man show in Pakistan" and that the new parliament -elected in February polls that dealt a crushing defeat to Musharrafs allies -would decide after exhaustive debate how Pakistan should approach Islamic extremism. 
He lashed out at Musharrafs U.S.-backed policies, saying they had led to a wave of sui­cide bombings that killed for­mer Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and many others, and argued the security of Pakistan must not be sacrificed to pro­tect other countries. 
"It is unacceptable that while giving peace to the world we make our own country a killing field," he told reporters. 
"If America wants to see itself clean of terrorism, we also want our villages and towns not to be bombed," he said, alluding to recent airstrikes near the Afghan bor­der apparently carried out by 
U.S. and allied forces. 
The U.S. envoys also met with Musharraf, army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and Asif Ali Zardari, Bhutto's widower and now chief of her party. Neither Negroponte nor Boucher made public com­ments on the meetings. 
Zaffar Abbas, an editor with Dawn newspaper, said the visit of such a high-profile U.S. dele­gation was badly timed, coin­ciding as it did with the inau­guration of Gilani as Pakistan's 22nd prime minister. 
That would signal to both Islamic extremists and moder­ates that "here are the Americans, right here in Islamabad, meeting with sen­ior politicians in the new gov­ernment, trying to dictate terms," Abbas said. 
"The problem with the Americans is they don't under­stand the domestic pressure on the new government," he said. "People are expecting this gov­ernment to explore other pos­sibilities for a solution to what's happening in the tribal areas." 
The U.S. Embassy said the visit was part of a regular dia­logue and had been planned for some time. But an official at Pakistan's Foreign Office said the trip was arranged sudden­ly. The official requested anonymity because of diplo­matic protocol. 
The visit could add to grow­ing mistrust of Washington here, even among liberals and the Western-educated elite. 


ARGENTINA 
President refuses to lower farm taxes 
Associated Press 
BUENOS AIRES -President 
Cristina Fernandez refused to · ease tax hikes on agricultural exports Tuesday, facing down angry farmers embroiled a nationwide strike that has all but halted production in one of the world's biggest beef-eating and 
beef-exporting nations. 
At least 9,000 cattle normally 
enter this capital's sprawling 
stockyard each day for slaughter, 
yet not a single animal arrived 
this week due to the biggest farm 
and ranch strike in decades. 
Scattered shops began empty­
ing of beef, milk, chicken and 
cooking oil Tuesday as farm­
workers mounted the most seri­
ous challenge yet to Fernandez's 
fledgling government. 
South America's second-largest 
economy -a leading exporter of 
soybeans, beef and wheat -is in 
full farmbelt rebellion over a new 
sliding-scale increase in export 
taxes. Soybean taxes are being 
hiked from 35 percent to 45 per­
cent, with smaller increases on 
corn and other farm products. 
"Bad policies by the govern­
ment are leaving people without 
food, without beef," complained 
Mario Llambias, one of the farm 
protest organizers who 
announced Tuesday a 13-day old 
strike would now continue 
"indefinitely." 
But in a tough speech later in the day, Fernandez announced her government will not grant any concessions to striking farm­workers nationwide, vowing not to "give in to extortion." 
The speech drew angry protests from farmworkers, who lit new tire fires on blockaded roads and vow to continue demonstrating indefmitely. 
After a searing 2002 economic meltdown, the government replenished its coffers through taxes on surging grain exports and soaring commodity prices. The cash influx powered an eco­nomic rebound, with growth rates topping 8 percent annually. 
Argentina's economy is back on track -and agriculture remains one of its most profitable sectors. It's only fair that farmers and ranchers be taxed on more of that wealth, according to Economy Minister Martin Lousteau, who announced the controversial tax overhaul on March 11. 
Growing demand for foodstuffs in China and other teeming nations, high oil prices and other shifts in the global economy have all helped pushed grain prices to new highs in recent months. 
But the agriculture industry is howling at having to pay more. 
"The countryside says 'Enough!'" declared one strike leader, Eduardo Buzzi.

Adoration is the answer 
Els11where, this is Easter Week. At NotrP Dame it appears to be The Week of the Vagina Monologues. To the read­er's reliel', this column will defer discus­sion of' that production. Instnad, we sug­gest a bnttor way to 
Charles Rice
spond your time 
those next few days 
and boyond. 
Right or
One impact of the 
Wrong?
papacies of John 
Paul II and Benedict XVI is a dramatic 
rise in the practice of Eucharistic 
Adoration in parishes and other venues 
throughout the world, including Notre 
DamP. What is it? And why is it such a 
big dP.al? 
The Eucharist was institutl~d by Christ at the Last Supper, fulfilling the promise he made as recorded in the sixth chap­tPr of John's Gospel. "In the ... Eucharist. the body and blood, ... soul and divinity, of our Lord .Jesus Christ and, theref'orn, the whole Christ is truly, rPally and substantially containnd. This presonce is called 'real,'... not ... to exdude the other types of presence ... but becausn it is presence in the fullest sense ... it is a substantial presence by which Christ, God and man, makes him­self wholly and entirely present" (Catechism, no. 1374} This is called transubstantiation because the sub­stance of the bread and wine changes whiln the appearances remain the same. The distinction between substance and appearance is familiar. When the angel appnared to the women at the tomb on Easter, his appearance was that of a man but his substance was that of an angel. Mark 16:1-8. 
Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament is possible whenever the consecrated hosts are reserved in the tabernacle, as indi­catnd by the lighted lamp near the tab­ernacle. The term, Eucharistic Adoration, however, commonly refers to adoration when the Sacrament is exposed to view on the altar. Such expo­sition is available at Notre Dame, in the Basilica on Friday from noon to 5 p.m., with Benediction at 4:45p.m., in the Coleman-Morse chapel Monday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., with Benediction daily at 8:45p.m. and at 

various times in some residence halls. 
In his apostolic exhortation, Sacramentum Caritatis (Sacrament of Love) (2007), Benedict XVI stresses "the inherent rolationship between Mass and adoration of the Blessed Sacrament .... The act of adoration outside Mass pro­longs and intensifies all that takes place during tho liturgical celebration itself. Indeed, 'only in adoration can a pro­found and genuine reception maturP. And it is precisely this personal encounter with the Lord that then strengthens the social mission containnd in the Eucharist, which seeks to broak down not only the walls that separate the Lord and ourselves, but also and especially the walls that separate us from one another'." No. 66." 
Adoration of the Eucharist, thewfore, is not some kind of sterile, self-centered devotion. Hather, it has a soda! impact. "[Tlhe sacrifice of Christ is for all," Benedict said, "and ... the Eucharist thus compels all who believe in him to become 'bread that is broken' for otlwrs, and to work for the building of a morn just and fraternal world ... The union with Christ brought about by the Eucharist also brings a newness to our social relations [and] is soeial in eharae­ter." 
Notre Dame emphasizes the impor­tance of sorvice to others. Benedict notns the role of Christ in the Eucharist as a motivator of such service and concern: "We cannot remain passive before cer­tain processes of globalization which ... increase the gap between the rich and the poor worldwide. We must denounce those who squander the earth's riches, provoking inequalities that cry out to heaven (ef. Jas. 5:4) ... The Lord Jesus, the bread of eternal life, spurs us to be mindful ol' the situations of extreme poverty in which a great part or humani­ty still lives: these are situations for which human beings bear a dear and disquieting responsibility." SC, Nos. 88­90. 
Mother Teresa of Calcutta spoke often of Eucharistic Adoration as a source of' power. "When the Sisters are exhausted, up to their eyes in work. when all seems to go awry," she said, "they spend an hour in prayer beforn the Blessed Sacrament. This praetice has novnr failed to bear fruit: they expnrienee peace and strength." Mother Ternsa was asked, "What will convert America and save the world?" She roplied, "My answer is prayer. What we nend is for every parish to come bnfore Jesus in the Blessnd Sacramnnt in holy hours of prayer." 
When he was ordained a priest. Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen promisnd that he would sp1md an hour in adora­tion before the Blessed Sacrament nvnry day. I le kept that promise and described the "holy hour" as not merely a devotion but "a sharing in the work of rndnmp­tion. He [Jesus] asked for an hour of reparation to eombat the hour ol' Pvil; an hour of victim a] union with the cross to overcome the anti-love of sin." 
So adoration of the Eucharist is a very big deal. But no one can cram it down your throat. We are free to accept it or reject it. If you arn not convinced that is it true, it might still be worth a visit to check it out. Th1m~ is no set formula. You don't have to eontact anybody. Just show up. Stay for as long or as short a time as you wish. You can pray, read or just think. II' you f'all asleep, don't worry about it. Archbishop Sheen roeounts the time in a church in Paris when he knelt down. promptly fell asleep and "woke up exactly at the nnd of one hour." lie won­dered if he had made his promised I lour until he realized "thaCs the way the Apostles made their first Holy I lour in the Garden." 
If you want to do something real for Notre Dame and for yoursell', don't wastn your timn on anything like the Vagina Monologues. Go instead to sp1md some time with the person who himself really is Truth. And Love.

Royal flush 

The Chinese government is certainly a busy agency. It undoubtedly has trouble finding time to rest in between squash­ing Tibetan dissenters (led by the sav­age, incendiary Dalai Lama), blocking YouTube from all Internet traffic, and suing Guns N' Roses for their use of "Chinese Democracy" as the band's 13-years-in­the-making album title. But when the government does have a few spare moments, it turns its attention to the upcoming Olympic games scheduled for this August in Beijing. 
Olympic officials recently faced a chal­lenge when they realized that many of the half-million expected foreign visitors will not be accustomed to China's squat toilets, little loos built into the ground that require no skin-to-porcelain con­tact. The organizers therefore decided to switch many of their squat commodes to Western-style sit-down toilets. This will relieve American visitors accus­tomed to relaxing on their porcelain thrones, but the switch to sitters also sacrifices some potential water use effi­ciency. 
We here in the West are not lacking in efficient toilet options -we just fail to explore the full range oflavatory alter­natives. For example, I attended John Cabot University in Rome last spring and I was much impressed by their dual-flush toilets in the bathrooms there. These rising stars in the toilet industry have two flush options: a low­flow flush for liquid waste and a high­flow option for solid waste disposal. (Apologies to those of you reading this in the dining hall.) Giving the user the option of two flushes offers huge poten­tial for water conservation. 

The American industry standard for toilet water consumption is 1.6 gallons per flush on all toilets since 1992. Older toilets gulp 3.5 or even 4.5 gallons of water every flush. The dual-flush toilet, in contrast to these water hogs, uses between .8 and 1.1 gallons for low-flow flushes and from 1.3 to 1.6 gallons for high-flow flushes, yielding an average of about 1.2 gallons per flush. That gives a 25 percent savings each and every time you plop down to read the newspaper. 
The prospective water conservation on campus that a move to dual-flush toi­lets would bring is staggering. If the University wants to appear serious in its environmental efforts, it should -after chopping off the power plant smoke­stack-make a commitment to dual­flush toilets. (It could be the "No. 2" pri­ority. Pardon the pun.) Allow me to ­forgive me -dump some figures on you.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Boycott Beijing 

Last week's events in Tibet reminded the world what China really is. Behind the mask of new economic prosperity and porous borders lies a nightmare of human rights violations, zero freedom of the press, and frequent hostile military action in the face of peaceful protest. 
In an effort to extend economic interest and "open" a closed world, the interna­tional community ignored a patterned history of irresponsible and egregious behavior and awarded China the 2008 Winter Olympic Games. The Olympics holds to a mantra of respecting universal fundamental ethical principles and pre­serving human dignity. From 1989 Tiananmen Square to last week in Tibet, China has repeatedly ignored human rights, and crushed human dignity within their country. China is in complete discord with the Olympic Movement. 
Contrary to President Bush's statement, the Olympics is much more than sport. Awarding the 2008 Winter Games to China was a deep oversight. China's lack of responsibility spreads beyond their borders. The country's economic interest in Africa coupled with its permanent spot on the U.N. Security Council has helped to extend the conflict in Darfur (leading to the popular label "Genocide Olympics"). 
In addition, the country's complete disregard for the environment threatens the entire world. The hopes that the Olympic Games would lead to a new order in China has been exposed as farce. China's human rights record stands as a mock­ery to the Olympic Games. I ask Olympic athletes and viewers alike to "Boycott Beijing!"; boycott the Genocide Olympics.

campus toilets cleaned by Building Services every day. Now, I realize that some of those toilets are male-use uri­nals. In my section's bathrooms in Siegfried Hall, we have two urinals and five toilets, or two urinals for every seven working toilets. Assuming that campus toilet facilities are evenly split between genders, we have 1,000 toilets for use by males. Applying the urinal:toilet ratio of 2:7 to this number, we find that roughly 300 (or 286 for you fraction sticklers) of the male toilets are urinals. That does not even take into account the urinal troughs of the Stadium, quite active during football weekends. Subtracting this from the overall 2,000 potties gives us a working figure of roughly 1, 700 sitter toilets with the potential for a dual-flush overhaul. 
The average person flushes about six times per day. Returning to my case study of Siegfried: The residence hall has about 50 toilets (five toilets and two urinals for six sections, plus AR, rector, and first-floor bathrooms). If the dorm's 240 residents each flush six times daily, the collective 1,440 flushes spread out over 50 toilets yields 28.8 flushes per toilet per day. Taking into account high­traffic latrines in classroom buildings, we can allow for a conservative esti­mate of 30 uses of a toilet throughout the day. Multiplying the 30 by the 1, 700 campus sitters gives us 51,000 flushes of the john every single day. 
Using conventional water closets, we go through roughly 81,600 gallons of water to dispose of our waste every day (51,000 flushes times 1.6 gallons per flush.) Now if we return to our earlier figure of a twenty-five percent savings gained from dual-flush toilets, we find we can potentially save over 20,000 gal­lons of water per day. That means over seven million gallons of water saved annually. 
I realize, of course, that not all waste­water is irretrievably lost. Sewage treat­ment facilities can reclaim a great deal of the water we bid adieu, but the figure of seven million gallons nevertheless demands attention. Many bodies of water contain less. I would guess, based on no scientific calculations whatsoever, that you could empty one of the campus lakes and fill it up again with the 7 mil­lion gallons we can save every year. 
Here at Notre Dame, we don't have to worry about Olympic preparations or Tibetan protesters or YouTube censor­ship, and Guns N' Roses only occasion­ally wreaks havoc. With all the time we have, we ought to explore installing a sophisticated network of dual-flush toi­lets, saving the precious natural resource of water. The Dalai Lama would approve.

Support the troops, not the war 
My name is Chris, I am the student who was directly referred to in the letter to the editor ("protesters Out of Line," Mar. 20). During the Iraq War protest last Wednesday at the Fieldhouse Mall, I asked Meghan, the author of the letter, and her ROTC boyfriend to join the protest last Wednesday. Meghan, upon seeing you and your boyfriend, him in his mili­tary gear, my first impulse was to thank him for his service. l thanked him and offered, not yelled, for him to join us in opposition to the war, as I had every person that walked by the protest. 
I understand you thought I was an ungrateful college student spitting on the soldiers on a mindless quest to peace. I want you to know that is not who I am and that is not what I rep­resented on campus last Wednesday. Your anger seems justified since you believed we were holding signs, "complaining of Iraqi deaths brought about by American soldiers." The sign read "655,000 Iraqis killed." This number is of civilians, not oppo­sition insurgents. We were by no means condemning the soldiers for their actions; we were calling atten­tion to the collateral damage of war. 
We do not blame the soldiers for that, we know they are doing the best job they can to protect the inno­cent in Iraq. Meghan, I have sent e­mails to soldiers thanking them, prior to yesterday, and will continue to do so (anysoldier.com). I am thrilled that you called this campus to action to do something to give back to the soldiers! But I will not allow you to condemn me for protest­ing this war. 
Are you claiming that the war sup­porters on campus who crumpled up my flyers, or those in town that gave me the finger are somehow better than those of us protesting the war? I would be interested to see how many pro-war people on this campus have sent care packages or emails when it would take just a minute of their time amidst hours of Facebook, ESPN, and partying on the weekends. 
Supporting the troops is not always supporting a war. It is about making sure this administration backs up its patriotism by offering health care and benefits to those affected by the war. It is about realizing that one in three homeless in this country are veterans. It is about understanding the political implications of our involvement in Iraq, and the long his­tory of violence there that makes "victory" a very ambiguous term. 
There are extremist protesters that make other protesters look bad, but there are also thousands of people protesting the war because a family member was killed overseas, because they are veterans of past wars, or because they believe in getting our troops out of a civil war. 
It is time we stopped profiling all anti-war protesters, liberals, or any­one else who believes in some sort of withdrawal of troops, as country-hat­ing, troop-hating extremists. These are people who care about their country, the reputation of their coun­try around the world, and most of all the lives of their men and women in the military. "Support the Troops, Not the War

Writer-Direetor Richard Kelly had to wait until his first film "Donnie Darko" came out on DVD before it rose to popularity and gained iconic cult status. 
However, for such to happen with his second fllm, "Southland Tales," he may have to wait a little longer. 
"Southland Tales" released on DVD March 18, after a dismal run in the late November 2007 box office, where it grossed less than $400,000. The fllm stars a broad ensemble, beginning with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, who plays Boxer Santaros, a movie star who suddenly disap­pears and then turns up in the

The story begins in 2005 and alters history a bit, beginning with a nuclear explosion in Abilene, Tex. The attack starts World War III and the U.S. goes to war in the Middle East and North Korea. Homeland security and the price of oil go through the roof. This inflation leads to the discovery of a new energy

source, Fluid Karma, which somehow draws energy out of the ocean's waves and wirelessly channels it out in an electrical field. We're told that the invention was used on U.S. soldiers, including in Abilene, as an enhancing drug, but with sketchy results. 
The film then cuts to 2008 in which an election between the Democratic and Republican Party has come down to the state of California where the Republican ticket of Elliot/Frost is scrambling to locate the vanished Santaros, fearing his disappearance to have been an attack on the Republican Party. And it is. 
There are quite a few other bits of altered history. 
After the nuclear attack, the 
Republican Party helped start this 
program called US-IDENT, a means 
Taverner and his identical brother,l planning to use them in an elabo-1 rate scheme to make the govern-t 
ment look bad. But things don't go as planned and the! story shoots ofT in an array of different directions. 
The rest of the story is made up of a blur of confus-1 ing plot twists involving a screenplay Santaros suppos-t edly wrote which keeps predicting the future in at countdown to the apocalypse, the truth behind thet dual nature of Officer Taverner and his brother, and ~ drugged-up musical interlude by Abilene. 
A longer version of the film debuted at Cannes inl 2006 and received very little love. To eombat wha~ many critics called "a disastrous mess," Kelly short­
ened "Southland Tales" and added a running narra­tion by Timberlake's character, made up of recita­tions from the Book of Revelations. Whether or not1 the additions and subtractions provide any mor~ cohesion to the story is debatable. It's still ridiculous-· ly hard to follow and leaves many of its questions unanswered. 
"Southland Tales" is movie that might be too vast for its own good. Like "Donnie Darko," it tries to explore realms of the fourth dimension and possibili­ties of time travel, while questioning human pur­pose. Unfortunately it waits until the final 15 min­utes of the two and half hour film to let us know what's really going on, and that might be a bit too long for an audience to wait.

You might know Zooey Deschanel from movies like "Elf" and "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," but did you know she can sing? She can sing quite well, and together with indie folkster M. Ward, she just put out a very solid record under the name She & Him. 
In this collaboration, Deschanel takes care of the lyrics and vocals, while Ward supplies pretty much everything else. He plays all the necessary instruments and pro­

As you can probably tell from the last two tracks mentioned, the pair's music is essentially trying to recapture the pop and country sounds from the SO's and 60's. 
Instead of trying to innovate and add anything new, they work to emulate the sound produced by the female country singers and the Brill Building work of Carole King and Gerry Goffin from that time period. 
Fortunately, they do it to perfection, and pop tracks like "I Was Made For You" mix fantastically 
with woeful country tunes like

She may not have the greatest voice in the world, or the best range, but her full-bodied and impressively expressive vocals

"crying all night until there was 
nothing left." In Black Hole, she's "alone, on a bicycle for two." But then in "I Was Made For You," she sings about "waitin' for a long, long time for a boy like you." The innocence and charm of these simple lyrics are very disarming and fit the music so well. 
There are also two covers on the album. The first is Smokey Robinson's "You Really Got a Hold on Me." Unfortunately, it's probably the weakest song on the album. It adds nothing to the original, and is 
played straight the entire song through. The sec­ond is a cover of The Beatles' "I Should Have Known Better" which is a standout on the album. Deschanel and Ward slow it down, and allow the tune and melody a little more space to breathe. It's a fantastic interpretation of a classic early Beatles song. 
"Volume One" is a refreshing window into the simpler, more innocent songs of the past. While She & Him branched out into a few more styles and themes (a bonus track rendition of "Swing Low, Sweet Chariots" show the promise of Deschanel's voice in gospel music), there's always time for that in "Volume Two." And at just 35 min­utes, the album does not overstay its welcome, but provides a brief respite for lovely escapism into the past.

Men's frisbee reaches semis 
Women's water polo earns No. 1 ranking; rugby falls to IU 
Special to The Observer 
Both the men's and women's teams made the trip to Statesboro, Ga., to participate in the College Southerns tour­nament over the weekend. The men fell in the semifinals while thfl women finished in 
.. firth plaee. The men entnred Saturday's pool play with the No. 3 seed, drawing Oberlin in its opener. .Junior Daniel Heimer proved to be a dangerous deep threat in both a 13-9 win over Oberlin and a 13-8 vietory over Florida State -games that were both a little tighter than initially anticipated. Notre Dame finally got things clicking in its third game, a 13-4 win over Charleston, thanks to the steady handling of junior Thomas Rivas. In Saturday's fourth and final game, a matchup that would deter­mine the pool winner and Sunday's bracket seeding, Notre Dame demolished Marquette 13-1 thanks to a fast start and the stifling defense of grad student Steve Kurtz. The Irish opmwd Sunday's round of 16 against Chicago, and senior Eric Morin sparked the elub en route to a 15-8 victory, setting up a matchup against a tough Iowa squad. After winning a close battle in the round of 16, the llawkeyes maintained their momentum and intensity to establish an early advantage against Notre Dame. The Irish eliminated the mistakes that allowed Iowa to gain an edge in the first half. Once it rf1gained the lead, Notre Dame rolled to a 13-9 victory, thanks to sophomore Bill Carson's cutting. The Irish were finally stopped in their semifinal tus­sle with Tufts. which sprinted out of the gate to grab a 6-0 lead -a hole Notre Dame was never able to dig out of. .Junior Panny Collom led the Irish charge to get back into the game, but their efforts fell short in a 13-10 loss. Senior captains Nick Chambers and Mike J-llorack were a steady presence all weekend. On the women's side, the Irish won their first two games easily, beating Columbia 13-1 and Ohio 12-5 
as sophomore Allie Keuthen 
and freshman Megan Franke 
led the offensive attack with 
great cuts and puts. 
With a pair of losses, 13-4 
to Emory and 13-6 to Tufts, 
Notre Dame finished the day 
at 2-2, good for third in its 
pool despite the tough defense 
of freshman Colleen Harris. 
Notre Dame started strong Sunday morning, defeating Williams 10-8. Sophomore Erin Maxwell and senior Shields Duss, who had stepped up all weekend in the absence of several of the Irish's normal handlers, made the difference on the offense for the Irish. The squad then fell to Iowa State, 14-7, before rebounding to defeat Wellesley 11-4 and Virginia 13-8. 
Women's Water Polo 
Despite being off this week­end, the team made news by earning the club's first ever No. 1 national ranking. The team is 18-0 against club competition and 7-4 against varsity opponents, many of which were ranked, for an overall record of 25-4. 
Rugby 
Notre Dame dropped a pair of contests at Indiana this weekend as the A-side lost 48-14, while the B-side fell 29-22. Don Greiwe and Bob lluguelet each scored a try for the top squad, with Greiwe successful on both conver­sions. It was the first venture into Div. I competition for the Irish. 
Chris Liedl, David Bray, Tom Hiley and Andy O'Conner each scored a try for the B-side. O'Conner managed the only conversion. 
Men's Water Polo 
No. 21 Notre Dame ven­tured west for the weekend, where it played in the peren­nially competitive Las Vegas Open. 
The Irish received a tough draw in pool play, falling to UC-Davis, the tournament's eventual runner-up, 25-17, 23-25, 15-9. Notre Dame was able to establish an early lead, but a mid-game lapse cost the Irish dearly in the 11rst game. Thanks to outside hitter Dan Zibton's perform­ance, the Irish took the sec­ond game but couldn't main­
tain that momentum in the 
third. 
No. 6 Utah Valley State then disposed of the Irish, taking the match in two games despite the superb passing of senior John Tibbie. 
Notre Dame closed out pool play against Cal State San Marcos in one of the tourna­ment's most interesting story­lines. San Marcos, despite its mismatched jerseys, beat the Irish in two games, handing them a last-place 11nish in the pool. But following the match, Notre Dame's fortunes turned when the tournament director announced that San Marcos had professional beach play­ers on the team that did not attend the school. San Marcos was disqualified, and Notre Dame was awarded the victo­ry. 
With a respectable finish still within reach, Notre Dame refocused for the second day. The Irish opened the double­elimination bracket against No. 22 Michigan State. Despite a bout with food poi­soning, sophomore Mike Nejedly excelled at the net, capitalizing with a kill on nearly every set he received in Notre Dame's 25-19 first­game win. After falling in the second game, the Irish stormed out to a 9-4 lead in the rubber game and never looked back. 
In the second round, the Irish faced No. 17 Texas A&M. The Aggies were no match for the Irish, as Notre Dame blew by the Aggies in straight sets, 25-15 and 25-21. 
For the right to go to the bracket championship, the Irish then faced the varsity squad from Holy Names University. Strong right side attacking by senior Tim Goldsmith controlled the tempo of the match, allowing the Irish to build comfortable leads throughout. The Hawks were able to steal the second game, but the Irish won the third and advanced. 
In the bracket's champi­onship, the Irish found them­selves against No. 11 Central Florida. Notre Dame created large leads in both games behind Mark landolo. Strong serving by the Knights broke down the Irish offense, how­ever, allowing UCF to crawl back into both games and eventually take both games.

Bargar, Irish look to stay hot against IUPUI 
By CHRIS DOYEN Sports Writer 
Notre Dame has won eight of their last nine games and will try to carry that momentum through their home opener against IUPUI this evening. 
Junior pitcher Brittany Bargar has been instrumental in the recent run. She was recently named Big East pitcher of the Week for the second week in a row. Bargar had a three-appear­ance stretch at the Charleston Southern University Lowcountry Softball Invitational in which she registered a 0.41 ERA, earned three victories, allowed only 13 hits in 17.1 innings, struck out 12 batters, and allowed only one earned run. Following that feat, she stepped into the circle against Western Michigan last Thursday to lead the Irish to their most recent victory. 
In that outing, Bargar pitched the full seven innings, gave up only two hits, and struck out nine Broncos en route to a shutout that moved her record on the season to 12-5 and the team's record to 15-9. 
Western Michigan's Kyla Sullivan walked in one run and gave up a solo home run to sen­ior Katie Laing, and those two runs wound up being more than enough for Bargar. 
In her 18 appearances this season, Bargar has held the opposition without an earned run an astounding twelve times, including the win over the Broncos. 
In tonight's home opener, the Irish will face an IUPUI squad with a record of 1-8 to start the season. The Jaguars are coming off a split with Dayton in which they were able to notch their frrst win of the season. 
Senior Meaghan Haynes pitched a complete game and allowed only four hits in getting the 11rst win of her career. She helped her own cause by going 2-2 at the plate and scored one of the Jaguars' three runs. 
Notre Dame has already played 24 games this season, but this will be the first time the Irish will get to play in front of a home crowd. For a team with plenty of contributing freshmen, it could give a fresh feel to a season that began over a month ago. 
The first pitch is set to leave the circle at 6:00 p.m. at Ivy Field.

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The top Republican on the con­gressional committee that investigated whether Roger Clemens used per­formance-enhancing drugs released a report Tuesday questioning the Democratic majority's con­clusion that the seven-time Cy Young Award winner might have lied in his tes­timony before the panel last month. 
The 109-page report, obtained by The Associated Press, contains details Rep. Tom Davis believes could challenge the credibility of Brian McNamee, the personal trainer who testified under oath he injected Clemens with steroids and human growth hormone from 1998-01. 

Republican staff from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will pass along additional information to the Justice Department. The FBJ is investigating whether Clemens lied to Congress. 
"Did Roger Clemens lie to us?" Davis said in a release accompanying the report. 
"Some of the evidence seems to say he did; other information suggests he told the truth," the Virginia Republican said. 
"It's a far more complicat­ed picture than some may want to believe. Memories fade and recollections dif­fer. That's human nature, not criminal conduct. My concern is the integrity of sworn statements made to Congress. At this point, the Justice Department is best equipped to investigate that central question and reach a fair conclusion." 
The report includes por­tions of previously undis­closed interviews with new witnesses and addresses issues such as whether Clemens attended a party at then-teammate Jose Canseco's house in 1998; information about injec­tions of vitamin B-12; and whether Clemens devel­oped an abscess on his buttocks. 
The report -"Weighing the Committee Record: A Balanced Review of the Evidence Regarding Performance Enhancing Drugs in Baseball" ­stands as a counterpoint to the 18-page memo released Feb. 27 by chair­man Henry Waxman. 
That was the day Waxman and Davis asked Attorney General Michael Mukasey to open an inves­tigation into whether Clemens committed per­jury. The following day, the Justice Department told the FBI to take up the mat­ter. 
IN BRIEF Red Sox fans wake early,
watch season opener on 1V 
BOSTON -Red Sox fans ate their sausages with eggs and hash browns instead of peppers and onions, and bars were opened so early they could­n't legally serve beer. 
And that was just the start of a unique opening day for Boston, where fans rose before the sun to watch the Red Sox defeat the Oakland Athletics in the land of the rising sun. 
Bars around Fenway Park and else­where catered to big breakfast crowds as the season officially started in Japan at about 6:05 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday. 
Terry Boccelli of Stoneham said she would have made the trip to Boston to watch the defending World Series champions, no matter what time of day or night. 
"I could not wait for the Red Sox," said Boccelli, who was at the Cask'n Flagon. "I have withdrawal all winter long." 

Pacers' Walsh not clear about 
future plans 
INDIANAPOLIS -The Indiana Pacers insist Donnie Walsh has not agreed to oversee basketball oper­ations for the New York Knicks after the season. 
"Donnie said this morning there's nothing clear about his future," Pacers spokesman David Benner said Tuesday. "When there is he'll make a statement. He has­n't agreed to anything with any­body." 
Walsh, the Pacers' chief execu­tive and president since 1988. said Monday he would step aside after this season, but-he would not com­ment on his future. The Pacers have turned over operation of the troubled franchise to Hall of Farner Larry Bird. 
The Associated Press left a mes­sage with Walsh's office, but his secretary said he would not respond to the inquiries. ­
IU opens spring practice, 
star quarterback suspended 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -Indiana's offense just got a whole lot faster, even with caretaker quarterback Ben Chappell calling the signals. 
The Hoosiers, who last season real­ized their goal of playing in a postsea­son bowl game, opened spring foot­ball practice Tuesday with Chappell directing a new no-huddle offense while star quarterback Kellen Lewis serves a suspension for an undis­closed violation of team rules. Lewis is not expected back before the start of training camp this summer. 
"It was better than could be expect­ed, really, putting in the new offense," said Chappell, a sophomore who appeared in just three games as a backup last season and completed one of two passes. "No huddle, man, we're going fast, we're on the line, ready to go. We're playing fast but under control. So that's the goal for this spring."

me." 
Sooners center Courtney Paris had 24 points, 16 rebounds and five blocks, and guard Jenna Plumley hit 6-of-10 3-point attempts en route to 18 points. Forward Amanda Thompson had 19 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. 
Irish guard Ashley Barlow had 16 points, and guard Tulyah Gaines had seven assists on the night. 
Allen almost destroyed the night she had so beautifully craft­ed. After Irish guard Lindsay Schrader rebounded Barlow's missed 3-point attempt, Gaines and Allen played keep-away until, with 44 seconds left, Allen lost control of the ball. It bounced out of bounds and gave Oklahoma possession. 
The Sooners took immediate advantage of the miscue. A tight Notre Dame defense kept them from getting a good outside look, but they found Courtney Paris in the paint for an easy bank shot to tie the score at 65 with 9.9 sec­onds left, forcing overtime. Plumley hit her sixth 3-pointer of the game and forward Amanda Thompson hit1a jumper to put Notre Dame down five to start overtime. But Allen hit a 3-point­er and helped force a steal, which Barlow converted into a layup, to tie the score at 70 with three minutes left. 
"Basketball is a game of runs, they had a 5-0 run," Allen said. "We had to come out and match that, and we did. We won." 
With under a minute left in overtime and the shot clock expiring, Gaines raced after a loose ball and threw it towards the rim to avoid a shot clock vio­lation. Robinson fouled her on the play, and Gaines hit one of two free throws. 
"I was thinking, the shot clocks about to go out, so throw it up," Gaines said. "Thank God they called the foul." 
With 38 seconds left, Barlow stole a pass near mid-court. Forward Nyeshia Stevenson fouled her to prevent the easy basket, but Barlow made both shots. Thompson's 3-point attempt missed, but she got another chance and sank it. Schrader threw the inbounds pass to Barlow across mid-court, where Barlow was fouled and made both free throws to seal the game. 
"We handled their run when they went up five," Barlow said. "They're a good team. We just handled their run, got out and made our free throws at the end of the game." 
The Irish hit 57 percent of their shots in the first half, but only 30 percent in the second. It was their free-throw shooting, howev­er, that won them the game. They made 22-of-24 free throws, or 
91.7 percent. 
"I give credit to Notre Dame, they were terrific from the free throw line," Sooners coach Sherri Coale said. 
When Oklahoma had a 56-49 lead with 7:26 remaining, Allen had enough. She made straight four foul shots during a three­minute span when she scored 10 points. 
After a steal in the offensive end, center Erica Williamson hit two free throws. Allen helped force a steal in the full-court press and made an awkward baseline and hit two more foul shots to make the score 61-58 with 3:57 remaining. 
The press, along with the Notre Dame fan contingent, increased its energy and hassled the Sooner offense more than previously. The Irish had struggled to fmd quality shots in the second half, but by getting the double bonus they battled back from the foul line. 
Notre Dame led by as many as nine in the first half, but the Sooners fought to keep close and finished the frrst half down four. 
Notre Dame 75, SMU 62 
With Erica Williamson in foul trouble, freshman forward Becca Bruszewski scored a career-high 16 points off the bench during No. 5-seed Notre Dame's win over No. 12-seed Southern Methodist in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. 
"I thought Becca Bruszewski was phenomenal off the bench," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "You don't expect a freshman to show up in the NCAA Tournament and get a career­high, and that's just what she did today." 
Ashley Barlow had 20 points and 12 rebounds, and Charel Allen had 14 points. 
The Irish jumped out to a 25-8 lead in the first half, but the Mustangs pulled to within four by halftime. 
In the second half, Southern Methodist tied the game at 57 when Allen a fade-away jump shot to give the Irish the lead. They went on a 12-0 run full of layups and free throws and never allowed the Mustangs back in the game. 
Notre Dame out rebounded Southern Methodist 49-26 and had 24 offensive rebounds.

Irish brave w-eather, com_e away with fifth 
By MIKE BLASCO 
Sports Writer 
On a day when the wind was blowing everyone away, Notre Dame was just glad to hold on. 
In wet and blustery condi­tions, No. 25 Notre Dame eked out a fifth-place finish with a 36-hole total of 642, 51 over­par, at the Betsy Rawls Longhorn Invitational in Austin, Tex. Irish freshman So-Hyun Park carded her seventh top-1 0 finish in eight contests with a 12 over-par 156, ending up seventh overall. 
The inclement weather wreaked havoc in Austin, short­ening the tournament by forcing the University of Texas Golf Club to cancel the second round of competition and driving scores up across the board. 
"The conditions made it very tough," Irish coach Susan Holt said. "You knew the scores were going to be high today, but I was shocked with how high they were." 
The tournament featured some nation's best, as the field of18 featured five top-25 teams. No. 22 New Mexico led through­out the tournament, clinching a first-place fmish with a 32 over­par 623. No. 5 Florida finished one shot back while Texas (630) and No. 6 Arkansas (632) fin­ished third and fourth, respec­tively. Notre Dame and No. 24 TCU tied for fifth, rounding out the top five. 

Coach Holt accepted her team's finish, especially consid­ering the competition and weather. 
"There were some good teams here and [the weather] affected everyone," Coach Holt said. "I just told our team to keep g:r:inding. I feel like we made the best of the situation by tying for fifth. It could have been worse but we grinded it out." 
Behind Park, fellow freshman Katie Conway shot her third top-1 0 finish of the season for Notre Dame, finishing play with a 13-over 157 in a three-way tie for lOth. Co-captain Lisa Maunu carded a 21 over-par 165 to fin­ish tied for 51st overall. 
Notre Dame returns to com­petition April 6-8 at the Canes & Cards Classic in Miami, Fla. The tournament will be the Irish's last contest before the Big East tournament. 
"We should play well [in Miami] and hopefully that'll give us some momentum heading into the Big East tournament," Holt said. "You just kind of have to toss this tournament aside and move on and that's what we'll do when we go to Miami."

Irish starting lin smacked his pitcher Brian Irish coach sixth homnr of' 
Du pra, who worked six innings and gave up just two runs, allowed Ball State to plate the Jirst run of the game in the top of the third. 
But Notre Dame responded in its half of the inning. With one out, shortstop Brett Lilley drew a walk and stole second base. It looked like Lilley would be stranded after David Mills lined out to center, but Irish sophomore A.J. Pollock singled up the middle to drive home Lilley and tie the game at 1-1. 
"That's a big lift," Dupra said. "You're working your hardest to pretty much keep a lead and keep zeroes on the board, so when the team picks you up like that, it's a big lift." 
Ball State scratched out another run in the next frame when Cardinals left fielder Nate Fields hit a sacrifice fly to drive in first baseman Matt Stoeklen for a 2-1 edge. 
But Dupra kept the Cardinals at bay for the remainder of his outing to pick up the l'irst win of his Irish career. · "I give IDupra] a lot of credit for battling through it today," Schrage said. "[Ball State has] a great hitting team and the wind [was[ blowing out, and 
the season as 
his drive just 
cleared Fields' outstretched glove and flew over the left field fence. 
Boockford clobbered a solo shot of his own to lead off the sixth inning and give the Irish another insurance run. The right fielder hit a mammoth blast off the screen in left-cen­terfield for a 5-2 lead. 
Boockford 's run and the one scored by Irish third baseman Mick Doyle later in the inning proved crucial as Irish right­hander Kyle Weiland ran into trouble in the ninth inning. 
Weiland surrendered a pair of runs on three hits before closing out the Cardinals. 
Schrage said he is happy with the play of his team's defense, which did not commit an error. 
"That's the strength of our team right now, just playing good 'D,"' Schrage said. "We tell our pitchers if we just let [other teams] hit it, we'll make the plays." 
Barnes had two diving stops that prevented Ball State hits. 
"There were a couple of great plays," Dupra said. "Jeremy Barnes had some highlight-reel type things."

"I have a lot of great memo­ries with these guys," Kurz said. "It's been a wonderful year. We had so many great wins and grPat SUCCeSSPS, but obviously this one really hurts." 
Kurz helped instill a tireless work ethic into his teammates, and many of them said throughout the season Notre Dame wouldn't havP made it this far without him.

They let us be physical in there. Sometimes he tries to (Teate contact and get some of those. That didn't happen [Saturday]." 
Washington State wouldn't just double-team Ilarangody, however. When the Irish drove to the basket, at least two Cougars defenders greeted them and made shooting or

Mike Brey

But no amount of hard work Irish coach could have saved Notre 
passing out of the trap diffi­cult. Coming off screens, the Cougars hedged or beat Notrp, Dame around them and made it hard for the Irish to use the screens well. 
Brey said even though Washington State's double­teams affected the Irish early 
small comeback. Junior for­ward Zach Hillesland and Harangody each hit a pair of free throws and Notre Dame managed to string together a few defensive stops. Junior guard Kyle McAlarney, who led Notre Dame with 12 points on 5-for-13 shooting, then hit a three after a Ilarangody offensive rebound to cut the Cougars lead to seven with 
13:49 to play. After a jumper by Cougars guard Derrick Low brought the lead back up to nine, McAlarney had a chance to cut the lead to six, but his three-pointer went in-and-out. 
After trading baskets the next few possessions, Washington State went on a 12-2 run to put the game out of reach. Cowgill started it off by hitting two consecutive perimeter jumpers. After guard Tory Jackson turned it over on Notre Dame's end, Washington State guard Kyle Weaver had Kyle McAlarney beat by a step on a fast-break to the basket. But McAlarney didn't let Weaver have the easy bucket, and reached out to grab Weaver as he went up for the shot. 
Only, the .referees whistled McAlarncy for an intentional foul. Weaver hit both free throws and then hit one-of­two after the Cougars got the ball back and he got fouled again. On the Cougars next possession, guard Derrick Low hit a three to put the his team up 52-35 with 8:34 left and end any hope of an Irish comeback. Notre Dame never got closer than 17 the rest of the game. 
The Cougars hardly put on an offensive clinic of their own, managing to shoot a 

middling 24-for-54 from the floor and just 4-for-17 from beyond the arc, but Low and Weaver proved a handful for Notre Dame to guard. Low fin­ished with a game-high 18 points and the 6-foot-6 Weaver were a tough matchup Notre Dame, finishing with 15 points and nine rebounds while Cougars guard Taylor Hochestie finished with seven assists. Low and Weaver each had thrne steals as well. 
"[Low and Weaver! are very good wings. They're threats. They can either go to the hoop, or they can shoot the three or a jump shot. So you have to be aware of that. They were coming ofT all those screens. The big guys were setting good screens for them and the were curling or fad­ing. They're very versatile and multi-threats." 
Things began promising enough for Notre Dame, Tory Jackson began his second straight game with a three­pointer and McAlarney added one of his patented runners in the lane to put the Irish up 5-0 with 18:24 left to play in the first half. 
But things quickly went downhill from there. Notre Dame managed just two points over the next 8:42 and Washington State jumped out to a 17-9 lead with 9:42 left. During that stretch, Low scored six points and Weaver poured in four. Notre Dame would pull within six after a pair of free throws from Kurz, but Washington State then went on an 11-2 run, capped off by a three from Low.

ND earns NCAA bid after losses 
By MATT GAMBER Associate Sporrs Editor 
Rarely is a team that has just lost consecutive one-goal gamns in its conference tournament as reliew~d the morning after as the No. 11 Irish (24-15-4) were on Sunday. 
After losing an overtime heart­breaker to No. 3 Miami (Ohio) 2-1 on Friday and giving up a pair of third-period goals in a 2-1 loss to Northern Michigan in an emo­tion-less third-place game the next night, Notre Dame's NCM Tournament hopes were very much in doubt, especially after the team enten1d the weekend in Detroit with the expectation that it had to win at least once to guarantee il'ielf a berth. 
And yet. when the pairings were announced Sunday morn­ing, there the Irish were ­yelling, cheering, but most of' all, breathing a gigantic, collective sigh of' relief that its dismal record in the season's second half had not ultimately cost them a chance to get back to the

Season-ending defeat will leave bitter taste 
DENVEH-Tho Irish had a good season but, boy, dons that type of loss leave a bad taste in their mouths. Like the dry. putrid taste you have in your mouth af'IN a long night of partying. No amount of' toothpaste can f'ully eradicatn that taste. 

But filJ' Notre Dame, there are some positives to be taken from ib sea­son-ending loss to Washin!,rton State. The Irish saw what it takes to advance beyond the first weekend of' thn NCM Tournament. 
Before the Tourney, I said that anything short of a Swent 16 berth would be a disappointnwnt for the Irish. I still bdieve that. but aftnr seeing Washington Stat(~ dismantle Notre Dame, I now also more fully rnalize why the Hound of 16 is labelod "Swnet." You have to play really, rnally well to get thorn. Obviously, llw Irish didn't. 
But I think Saturday's loss had more to do with Washington Statu's oxecution than with Notre Dame's poor showing. The Irish
