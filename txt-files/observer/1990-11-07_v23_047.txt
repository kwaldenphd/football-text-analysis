Sloan: Catholic universities can support Great Books 
By COLLEEN GANNON 
News Writer 
Catholic highnr education can sustain a Grnat Books Program, said Profnssor Phillip Sloan, the chairman of thn Program in Liberal Studies, Tunsday in the lntnllectual Life Committee Forum. 
Instead of simply answering with "a rnsounding yns," to the qunstion of sustaining a Great Books Program in Catholic higlwr education, Sloan bngan by tracing three traditions in liberal education. 
Thn humanistic tradition stmssed the enriehmnnt of the citizen. Sloan said. On the other hand, aceording to Sloan. the philosophical tradition, as ex­emplified by Plato and Aristotle, pnrct~ived liberal arts as only prnparatory and incomplete in thernselvns. The nnlightnnment tradition strt~ssed a liberating education that frees the mind from prej ud iees. 
In modern limns. Sloan said, liberal education combines all three of thnsn traditions. According to Sloan, a primary dnfinition of liberal education ineludes, "critical awareness, fmedom from prejudices, non­dogmatic thinking." 
At the core qf the program is the seminar, i1e said. At the seminar, tutors are "not present to provide right answers." 
The program brought to Notre Dame "the idea of read­ing primary sources by students directly in an open seminar at­mosphere, where the teacher was considered a fellow discus­sant, not a guide," Sloan said. 
While claims have been made that Great Books members are elitist, Sloan said, "the origin of the seminar was highly not eli­tist in its intent." He further added. that it was a "boldly democratic experiment." In many respects, the distinction between teacher and student is abolished in the seminar's at­mosphere. 
"The program's students and faculty are just as likely to be involved with liberal politics as with conservative," Sloan said. 
The Great Books program has

INSIDE COLUMN 
Save your insults; give us your input 
I was sitting in class 
yesterday and my profess'or was com­menting on the gen­eral writing skills of the class, or the lack thereof. He told the class that in order to 

write well they O';~ght Colleen Cronin 
to read magazmes 
and newspapers that Accent Editor are written well. which is an excellent idea. He then pro­ceeded to qualify that. 
"The Observer is not a model of good writing." I was appalled that a professor would make so callous and rude a remark. 
The Observer is a student newspaper-it is run entirely by students. There are no journalism professors looking over our shoulders. 
Notre Dame does not have a journalism department; in fact it offers no more than five "journalism" classes. So it is impossible for The Observer to limit itself to only em­ploying journalism students. Anyone who is interested in writing can do so. whether their major is engineering or American studies or anything in' between. 
The Observer staff. from the editors down to the reporters, are working with what they have learned on their own. Granted, some know more than others, but none of us knows it all. Some of us worked on high school newspapers, but not all of us. All of us are learning as we go along. 
That is what we are here at Notre Dame for. That is what· we are paying $16,000 a year for. 
We know the newspaper is not perfect­no newspapers are. Being "merely" a college newspaper, I suppose we have more faults than professional papers, but that is not an excuse to hold up The Observer as a general example of what not to do. 
One hell of a lot of work goes into these pages Monday through Friday, and all that work is usually at the expense of free time and sleep. No one at The Observer receives credit hours for their work, so everyone carries a full load of classes which includes a full load of reading, papers, and other sorts of homework. 
Many of the people intend to pursue writ­ing as a career and therefore treat their po­sition as seriously as an internship. I am not complaining, though. If I hated the situ­ation I would not continue to put all this time into it. 
Professors are here to teach the students and help them out, but comments such as the one that my professor made are coun­terproductive. We know th~t by putting out a newspaper for everyone to read we are holding ourselves up for scrutiny and com­ments, both good and bad. 
But instead of shunning the paper, and encouraging others to do the same, why not offer constructive criticism and help us im­prove it?

Mcinerny discusses faith, reason 

By STEVE ZAVESTOSKI 
News Writer 
"Today it is the Catholic Church that is the defendPr of reason." argued professor of Philosophy Halph Mcinerny at Tuesday's lecture concerning the relationship of faith and philosophy. 
Mcinerny outlined three pos­sibilities for the relationship of faith and philosophy, the last of which was the basis of his talk. "Faith is a positive aspect to philosophizing," claimed Mcinerny. as opposed to a hin­drance or an entirely separate state of mind. lie also empha­sized that religious belief is not a substitute for philosophy. 
"The believing lin Godl philosopher does not seriously entertain that an air tight ar­gument for the nonexistence of God can be formulated," added Mcinerny. He continued to de­scribe an 'animal faith' that one brings to philosophy. 
Mcinerny referred to Descartes' process of reasoning to exemplify his idna of an 'animal faith.' Descartes con­cludnd that he existed merely because he could conternplatn his existence and so Mcinerny believes that any person brings certain similar bnliefs into phi­losophy-such as a belief in God. 
Mcinerny shownd a concern for the celebration of reason present in Descartes' time which is absent now. "We live in a time which has been charac­terized by Allister McEntire as a time of Universal lmmotivism," Mcinerny said. lie continued to define Universal lrnrnotivism as the belief that all moral judgments arc only personal opinions. 
Mcinerny expressed hope declaring that "Today it is the Catholic Church that is the main defender of reason." lie also added that there seems to be no other outspoken source of morality other than the Catholic Church. 
Mcinerny described two de­terminants of morality for the Christian: scripture and tradi­tion, and natural law. lie com­mented on such issues as abor­tion. fornication, and homo­sexuality, coneluding that "these can be seen by natural reason to bn wrong." 
"This is a unique claim in tlw contemporary world that you and me can forget about rnve­lation, can forget about the sanctions of the church. We can figme out by appeal to objective criteria what is right and what is wrong." 
Mcinerny concluded by reit­erating the importance of the Catholic Church in the study of philosophy. lie lnft his listeners at St. Edward's llall with the question, "Who other than the church is concerned with the defense of human reason?"

The fact that insurance claims were only 84 per cent of premiums in the past year is good news for the university and for faculty members. ac­cording to a guest presentation that followed the routine committee reports at Tuesday's meeting of the Faculty Senate. 
Roger Mullins, Director of Human Resources, told Faculty Senate members, "We did have a relatively good year with health insurance. Claims were 84 per cent of premiums which 
is really good news. There's going to be a 12 per cent in­crease in premiums: 12 per cent for the university and 12 per cent for the premium holders." 
Although premiums will be going up in the next year, there is still good news in the fact that premiums exceeded claims. according to Mullins. He said "If claims exceeded prcmiu~s. it is conceivable that J'd be telling you that claims would go up 25 to 40 per cent. We all should recognize that health insurance, health costs

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) Democratic Secretary of State Joseph Hogsett appeared headed to victory over Republican challenger William Hudnut early Wednesday in one of the closest statewide elections in recent history. 
Hogsett had 580,840 votes, or 
51.7 percent, to Hudnut's 542,248, or 48.3 percent, with about 78 percent of the state's precincts reporting.

Gov. Evan Bayh, Hogsett's political mentor, joined the secretary of state at the Democratic rally, lifting Hogsett's arm in triumph. Bayh's wife, Susan, embraced and kissed Hogsett. 
Earlier, Hudnut, the four-term mayor of Indianapolis, expressed hope of pulling out a victory.

Hogsett, appointed to his office when Bayh left it to become governor, has said for months the election could be one of Indiana's closest ever in a statewide race. 
Hudnut had enjoyed sizeable leads in early polls this year, but the margin steadily shrunk as Hogsett put on a multimillion-dollar advertising blitz. 
Nine Hoosier Congress members win re-election 
(AP)-Nine of Indiana's 10 U.S. House members won re­election Tuesday, but GOP incumbent John Hiler was trailing in incomplete 3rd District returns delayed by a computer glitch. 
Hiler was behind Democratic challenger Tim Roemer by 11,000 votes, with only one­quarter of the heavily Republican Elkhart County precincts counted. 
Hiler has faced strong chal­lenges during off-year elections throughout the 1980s, winning by 47 votes in the nation's clos­est congressional race in 1986. 
Elkhart County Republican Chairman Roy Rogers said the county's vote-tallying comput­ers were rejecting an undeter­mined number of correctly punched ballots. Rogers said the final count could be delayed until Wednesday. 
Democrat Jim Jontz won re­election in the 5th District, de­feating Valparaiso businessman John Johnson in what had been projected as the state's closest race for Congress. 
The state's two senior-most congressmen won re-election, extending House careers that began in the 1960s. 
Democrat Lee Hamilton de­feated Scottsburg plastics engineer Floyd Coates for a third time in southern Indiana's 9th District. Hamilton has held the seat since 1964.

Democrats had hoped to improve on their 55-45 majority anywhere they could, but especially in North Carolina. They were disappointed, and llelms rubbed it in. 
"There is no joy in Mudville tonight," the 69-year-old senator said. "The mighty ultra-

liberal establishment, the liberal politicians and editors and commentators and columnists have struck out again." 
Democrats also pushed for a piek-up in Oregon. But early returns showed Hepublican Mark llatlield. who has served four t11rms, outdistancing businessman and scientist Harry Lonsdale, who tapped into voter discontent and made it a dose race.

ND Business College establishes business communication center 
By VALLI VAIRAVAN 
News Writer 
The Notre Dame Center for Business Communication has been established by the College of Business Administration. 
According to James O'Rourke, director of the Center, the main focus of the Center is to provide instruction in writing and speaking in the business school. 
"All Notre Dame students get help with writing and speaking in their freshman year courses but [after this] the amount of help is very uneven for students of different majors, such as English majors and business majors... junior and senior business students are not get­ting help with writing," said O'Rourke. 
In the graduate business school, there has not been any program in writing and oral communication until now. O'Rourke said that several in­dependent studies reinforced the need for such a program. 
" Employers said repeatedly that among the most important skills for MBA students are writing and oral communica­tion, and not just at the entry level. .. in fact [these skills] are more important at mid-career." 
Currently, the Center, located in 110 Hurley Hall, is offering one undergraduate course, Business Communication. The course is taught by Eugene Fanning, an entrepreneur and businessman and who drives to Notre Dame once a week from Chicago to teach the course, said O'Rourke. O'Rourke indi­cated that by next fall, two Business Communication courses will be required of MBA students. 
Two other goals of the Busi­ness Communication Center, according to O'Rourke, are to do research and publications, and to provide assistance for all business students in the form of non-credit · workshops, seminars and small group in­teractions. 
O'Rourke hopes to gradually expand the program, and antic­ipates having three instructors by next fall. By establishing this Center, and acknowledging the importance of writing and ver­bal skills, "Notre Dame is in exclusive company among busi­ness schools," said O'Rourke.

The introduction of the GrPat

was an item of controversy in 
the 1950's. "Notre Dame was 
the first Catholic university to 
have the program," said Sloan. 
At this time in history, many of the books were considered dangerous for Catholics to read, he said.

Homosexual soldier allowed to re-enlist 
WASIIINGTON (AI')-The Supreme Court carved out a one-man exception to the mili­tary serviens' ban on homosex­uals Monday, letting stand a ruling that forces the Army to re-enlist a gay soldier. 
The justices, without com­nwnt, rejected the Bush admin­istration's challenge to the ordtm~d reinstatnrnent of Perry Watkins of Tacoma, Wash., a I6-year veteran with an excel­lent servien record. 
Monday's action is not ex­pnetl~d to alTect in any sweeping way thn military's ban on ho­mosexuals. The appnals court ruling in Watkins' casn did not address thn validity of that ban, but instead notnd the Army re­pnatedly had r11-enlisted Watkins while knowing he is gay. 
The case nnvertheless had been elosely watched by gay rights advocates. 
"These days. we'll take a vic­tory any way we can get one," said Paul DiDonato of the National Gay Bights Advocates in San Franciseo after ac­knowledging that Watkins' vie­tory was a narrow one. 
But DiDonato said Watkins' easn "sends a broader signal out to tlw military and thn country at larg1~ that gays and lesbians cannot bP treated un­fairly fornver by the military or any other employer." 
Watkins said. "My next stnp is obviously to get reinstated." lie said he wants to serve until he can retire with an Army pen­sion in about live years. 
Asked if he anticipated prob­lems after his reinstatement, Watkins said, "That goes with­out saying. The problems that are going to be there are the problems the system itself will create.... I'm asking for the same rights any other citizen receives." 
There was no immediate re­action from the Army or the Department of Dnfense. 
In other matters, the court: 
Hefusnd 
to let some Puerto Hieo cable TV systems be pros­ecuted for carrying The Playboy Channel, rebuffing arguments that states' anti-obscenity ef­forts may be hampered unduly. 

Left 
intact a ruling from Illinois that lets prosecutors punish businesses convicted of dealing in obscenity by seizing their property. 

Huled 
unanimously in a Mississippi case that someone suing morn than one defendant generally does not have to in­clude all of them in the same lawsuit. 

Agreed 
to decide in a case from California whether con­victed defendants may seek a federal court's help if state courts refuse to explain why their appeals were rejected. 

Let 
stand an Ohio Supreme Court ruling that the public has no constitutional right to attend juvenile court proceedings. 


In the case of the gay soldier, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year said, "Sgt. Watkins has greatly benefited the Army, and therefore the country, by his military ser­vice."

Walker trade bust for Vikings, boon for Cowboys 
(AP)-Last Sunday night, Herschel Walker ran onto the field for the Minnesota Vikings, carried the ball for 12 yards and ran off the field. 
For a guy who had 9 yards on six carries in his two previous games, 12 yards was wonder­ful, yet he was taken out of the game. 
And that. perhaps better than anything, demonstrates the point: The Trade is a boom for Dallas and a bust for Minnesota. 
"If this takes us to the Super Bowl in the next two years, then it's a great deal," Mike Lynn, then president of the Vikings, said when he dealt six players, five draft ehoices and a host of conditions to the Cowboys for Walker. "If it's not, then it's a bad deal." 
It's a bad deal. 

Since the trade was made in the fifth week of the 1989 sea­son, Minnesota is 9-11 and Walker never has approached the 148 yards he gained in his Vikings debut. The Vikings were blasted from the playoffs in their first game last year and are 2-6 this year. They need a minor miracle to return to the playoffs, even with an addi­tional wild-card spot. 
Nor will Dallas make the playoffs this year, but it, at least, is showing improvement. The Cowboys' three wins are three times last year's total. And coach Jimmy Johnson, the man who made the deal, says the polite and conventional thing: "It was good for both teams." 
Sure. 

But unlike the Rams. who have slid back because some of the players they got with draft picks from the Eric Dickerson deal of 1987 appear to be dis­appointments, the Cowboys al­ready are showing why their deal was so good. 
So far, this is what the Cowboys have: 
 
Running back Emmitt Smith. who became one of the Cowboys' extra No. 1 draft picks. The Cowboys actually dealt one of Minnesota's picks to move up in the draft and get Smith. Johnson won't say it, but he certainly wouldn't trade Smith, six years younger, even up for the 28-year-old Walker. 

 
Linebackers Freddie Solomon and David Howard and cornerback Issiac Holt, all obtained from the Vikings in the Walker deal. Not only has their loss drained the Vikings' 


depth, but all, particularly Holt, are peforming well for the Cowboys. 
 
Defensive end Daniel Stubbs, who leads the Cowboys with 4 112 sacks. He was ob­tained from San Francisco with the since-released Terrence Flagler for one of the second­round picks in the deal. They got that pick for a choice that had been tied to one of the players the Vikings gave them, Alex Stewart. It became a sec­ond-rounder when the Cowboys released Stewart two weeks after they got him. 

 
Fullback Alonzo Highsmith, obtained from Houston with another of the second-round choices~a 1991 pick-that the Cowboys got from the deal. Like Stubbs, he played for Johnson at Miami; unlike Stubbs, who leads the Cowboys in sacks, he has yet to produce, although his potential is unlim­ited. 


In addition, the Cowboys have Minnesota's top pick next year and its top three in 1991. That could give the Cowboys three picks in the top 1 0----their own, the Vikings' and the one they got from New Orleans (3-5) for quarterback Steve Walsh. 
Compare that to what the Rams got for Dickerson in the three-cornered deal that also sent Cornelius Bennnett to Buffalo and brought them run­ning back Greg Bell, who now plays for the Raiders. 
In '88, they used the draft picks they got from Buffalo and Indianapolis on running back Gaston Green, wide receiver Aaron Cox and linebacker Fred Strickland. 
The only thing Green has done is return a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown in a 41­10 loss to Pittsburgh two weeks ago. Newman is a nickel back and Cox has been productive when healthy, but has spent more time injured. 
In fact, the best player the Rams got in that draft, wide receiver Flipper Anderson, came on a second-round choice obtained from San Diego for Barry Redden. 
In '89, the Rams used a first­round pick from Buffalo for running back Cleveland Gary, who is just now starting to emerge, and a second-rounder on cornerback Darryl Henley, who like Cox has spent most of his time injured. 
Moreover, Dickerson, despite his hassles with the Colts, raised Indianpolis from the 
depths to respectability and a 
playoff berth in '87. 
But to say that the Walker 
trade helped both teams, as 
Johnson does in his diplomatic 
way, is stretching. 
Vikings coach Jerry Burns, 
whose use of Walker~or lack 
of it-could cost him his job, 
says he never got Walker to 
make him a 30-carry-a-game 
guy who could take a team to a 
Super Bowl by himself. 
Running backs rarely do. 
Dickerson has never gotten to 
a Super Bowl. O.J. Simpson, 
Gale Sayers and Earl Campbell 
never came close, and it took 
Walter Payton 13 seasons to get 
there. 
"I never expected Herschel to 
come in and dominate our of­
fense," Burns says. "Herschel's 
a hard worker. He's done ev­
erything we've asked him to 
do." 
Part of the problem is what 
he's been asked to do. 
In Dallas, where he led the 
league in total yards in 1988 on 
a 3-13 team, he ran out of the I 
formation and often was set out 
wide as a receiver. He led the 
NFC that year with 1,586 
rushing yards and caught 53 
passes. 
"He needs space," says Halph Hawkins, former defensive co­ordinator of the Jets and _Seahawks and now a scout in Seattle. "You need to get him a 
seam or an open field." 
But in Minnesota, which uses 
a split-back formation, he's also 
expected to block, which he 
never really has done. If he's 
most effective carrying 30 
times a game, he's rarely car­
ried more than 15 in 
Minnesota,-even Sunday 
night, his best game this year, 
he carried 10 times for 59 
yards. 
It has now come to this for 
the Vikings: They hope to get 
SOMETHING for him after this 
year, like a No. 1 pick from a 
team whose offense he'd fit, 
like the Redskins or the Rams. 
And even Lynn, while he 
hasn't admitted failure, has 
come close. 
"You make good trades and 
bad trades," he said as he left 
the Vikings to take over the 
commissioner's job with the 
World League of American 
Football, the NFL-sponsored 
league scheduled to start in the 
spring. 
"If this one doesn't work out, 
it could be my legacy to 
Minnesota." 
Some legacy.

Clemson just seems to be a slightly more complete team.

SUGAR (Jan. 1; New Orleans, La.): Tennessee will beat Mississippi, Auburn will strug­gle against in-state rival Alabama, Florida is ineligible for bowl competition, and the Sugar will choose the Volunteers over Auburn for the SEC berth. Tennessee will face major disappointment Nebraska, which will continue its record of futility in major bowls. 
ORANGE (Jan. 1; Miami, Fla.): A rematch of last year's game, Colorado fans hoping for a dif­ferent ending will have to wait another year. The Irish, pro­vided they survive a Murderer's Row ending, are more balanced offensively this year, while the Buffaloes have not proved they can pass or stop the pass yet this year. 
What does this all mean for the National Championship? In a perfect world, Washington and Notre Dame would meet to decide the title. However. in the world of polls, Notre Dame would finish No. 1 because un­less the Irish lose, the pollsters won't knock them out of the top spot.

Japan: has the new juggernaut arrived? 
TOKYO (AP) -First it was cameras, cars and electronics. And now, horror of horrors, is baseball to be the next U.S. in­dustry to find itself outgunned by the Japanese juggernaut? The question, which would have evoked laughs last week, seems suddenly pertinent after the showing of a major league all­star team touring Japan for an eight-game series. The Americans have lost the first four games to their Japanese counterparts, includ­ing an 11-6 rout Tuesday in Fukuoka, a city on the southern island of Kyushu. The major league team, which includes Cecil Fielder, Dave Stewart and Rob Dibble, lost 4­1, 4-3 and 2-1 in its previous three games. "The Japanese are playing really well," commissioner Fay Vincent said. "You can't take anything away from the Japanese." In Game 3, four major leaguers were thrown out on the bases. In Game 4. the major leaguers made four errors. "''m trying everything to win," said Don Zimmer, the Chicago Cubs manager who is managing the all-star team. "We want to win. We all want to win. But they've (the Japanese team) outplayed us." 
Does this mean sayonara to U.S. superiority on the field? Does this mean the World Series of the future in Tokyo? Hardly. say the experts. "Japanese baseball is better than most Americans think," said Robert Whiting, whose book "You Gotta Have Wa" ex­amined the differences between the Japanese and American ap­proaches to the game. "But it's not as good as some of these Japanese commentators are starting to say now." 
To begin with, the playing field is not exactly even for the series. The major leaguers have to contend with jet lag and most of them have been off for a month since the end of the regular season. 
And while the Japanese roster includes virtually all the coun­try's top players, many of the leading stars from the United

Kingston Rule takes title in Australia's prized race 
MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -Kingston Rule, a son of Secretariat, won the $1.56 mil­lion Melbourne Cup on Tuesday as trainer Bart Cummings cap­tured the race for the eighth time. 
Kingston Rule, ridden by 
Darren Beadman, made his bid three-sixteenths of a mile from the end of the two-mile race when he overtook Our Magic Man, which had been running second to Argentine import Savage Toss. 
The Phantom finished second and Mr. Brooker was third. Kingston Rule went off as the 7-1 co-favorite with The Phantom. Mr. Brooker was 14­1. 

A spokesman for the New South Wales state off-track betting service said Monday 
that an estimated $273 million would be wagered on the race. That is approximately $15.60 for each of Australia's 17 mil­lion people. 
Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, presented the three-handled gold cup to the winner, who earned $940,000. 
Australians packed pubs and huddled around televisions to watch the Melbourne Cup, Australia's biggest horse-racing spectacle.

Holtz pumps up volume, preps Irish for Knoxville 

By FRANK PASTOR Associate Sports Editor 
Three weeks ago, Lou Holtz placed a long-distance phone call to Miami head coach Dennis Erickson before Notre Dame faced the Hurricanes in what was then perceived as the most important game of the college football season. Holtz placed a call of a different sort this week, seeking advice from former Alabama head coach Ray Perkins as his top-ranked Irish prepared for Saturday's contest against No. 9 Tennessee, the current version of the most important game of the college football season. 
"Ray Perkins has taken a team up there," Holtz said, "and I figured Alabama was always a real intense rival with Tennessee. He didn't have much to say, except that {the quarterback) can't check off, it's difficult, and you're gonna hear that Rocky Mountain Top Tennessee song all the time.

"When your quarterback throws an out cut on the other side, it may be downhill 2 1/2 feet. You may only be able to see the top of the other team, and that throws off your passing game." Holtz has sought a second opinion. "I've talked to some different coaches," Holtz said. ''I'll probably call some more. I figure I'll call until I can find somebody say something positive about going into Knoxville. Everybody just says, 'Don't go unless you absolutely have to.'" 
With Notre Dame's 7-1 record, the national championship, and the reputa­tion of every major bowl preview writer on the line, the Irish have no choice but to show up at Tennessee's 91,100-seat Neyland Stadium on Saturday. Crowd noises and country songs blared from speakers in the Loftus Center at Monday and Tuesday's practices as Holtz tried to simulate the noise level his team will contend with at Tennessee.

Peltier finds a large corner at Notre Dame 
By getting his degree at Notre Dame, former Irish baseball star Dan Peltier has attracted many people to "his corner." 
This slugger, who after his junior year here was the Texas Rangers' third-round pick in the '89 draft. plays baseball in the minor leagues during the. spring and summer, and studies at Notre Dame in the fall. "I remember when my fiancee's (Notre Dame senior Amy Tri) family came down to watch me playing in Tulsa (The Rangers' 
double-A affiliate in Oklahoma) this summer," recalls Peltier. "They came all the way from their home in Minnesota to watch. Well, I remember them sitting there when I was up, and I hit a home run. They started yelling and cheering, with Mr. Tri and his son jumping up and down. It was crazy." 
The Tri family is just one such group within the Peltier corner. After all. the Notre Dame family extends throughout the nation, and who can help but like this 22-year-old outfielder who etched his name all over the Notre Dame and national record books? In his junior year at Notre Dame, Peltier set single-season records in batting average (.446), doubles (32) and RBI (93). For career bests. Peltier topped the Notre Dame books with a .406 batting average, 60 doubles, 28 home runs and 202 RBI. And remember, he set these records in only three years. 
In fact, Peltier's career batting average is fifth best in NCAA history. His mark of 32 doubles in a season, furthermore, is third-best in the country. When you post numbers like that. alumni will notice and follow your progress. "Probably the best move I ever made was coming to Notre Dame," says Peltier, sitting in the television room in LaFortune Student Center. "There are so many opportunities, and I learned that this summer. Traveling on the road this summer to different towns, alumni in the area would take me to lunch and treat me like family. 
"I know people around the country are watching my stats and pulling for me. I just hope I don't let them down." From how he has performed so far in the minors, Peltier need not worry about that. In the Pioneer Rookie League in 1989, he hit over .400 at the Ranger's affiliate in Butte, Mont. His coaches were impressed enough to let him work out at the Hanger's spring training camp the following year, and due to his success there he moved up to the Texas AA League in Tulsa. During that season, Peltier hit .279 with 11 home runs and 55 RBI, but in the month of August, when the Rangers' General Manager was watching, he hit near .500. Peltier's manager there, Tommy Thompson, told him that if the manager was promoted to the Rangers' AAA club, he would take Peltier with him. 
Thompson got promoted. 
''I've really been fortunate because they're moving me up quick," says Peltier. "I could be in single-A right now. I'm thankful that the Rangers think what they do of me." The fact that Peltier is also academically conscious makes his

The bowl situation: here are a few predictions on a 'ridiculous season' 
The college bowl 

scene is becoming ridiculous. Bowls should be rewards for excellent seasons, not cash cows which can feed the coffers of deficit-ridden athletic 
Rene Ferran budgets. Moreover, 
Sports Writer fans are not willing to tune in to watch two mediocre teams battle in Shreveport, 
Tucson, or Anaheim, as evidenced by falling ratings. 
However, it does make for an interesting exercise to find attractive matchups. Here then are what I think the bowl confrontations should be. Two things to remember: 1) there's still plenty of time for some team-Stanford for one comes to mind-to come along and mess up the works; 2) I'm the one who picked Oakland in six. ALOHA (Dec. 25; Honolulu, Hawaii): An Associated Press report has Syracuse going to the Aloha. and its opposition will be Indiana. The Orangemen will proceed to show how over­rated Indiana was. BLOCKBUSTER CLASSIC (Dec. 29; Hollywood, Fla.): The newest addition to the bowl parade, South Carolina, the regional draw, will be pitted against the Texas A&M Aggies. Texas A&M has a legitimate Heisman candidate in running back Darren Lewis. The Gamecocks-who lost to The Citadel earlier in the year-aren't in the same class as the Aggies, as Texas A&M easily will prove. FREEDOM (Dec. 29; Anaheim, Calif.): Representatives of the Freedom Bowl have been following the Oregon Ducks since mid­October. The Ducks have not disappointed, and Bill Musgrave's "Quack Attack" will handle an Ohio State team still reeling from losses to Iowa and Michigan. INDEPENDENCE (Dec. 29; Shreveport, La.):
