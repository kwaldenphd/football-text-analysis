William Bennett advocates values, culture in NO lecture 
By PAUL PEARSON 
Assistant News Editor 
A friend of William Bennett, thn national "drug czar," re­cnntly refnrred to him as "the Chris Zorich of drug policy." 
At a lecture Wednesday, Ben­nett did nothing to dispel this image by saying that values and culture "arn more real. more important and have more im­pact on the lives of our chil­dnm" than other issues facing thn nation today. 
BPnnett was at Notre Dame to discuss the problems facing American children, which he said wern "rootnd in behav­iors." lin said that the worst problem facing children today is drugs, which he ealled "a problem of private behavior and morality." 
lin criticized the findings of Code Blun, tlw report of a na­tional commission on America's tiHmagers. "Code Blue," he said, "idnntifics a crisis of the spirit, a sickness in the soul and it mcommends aspirin, Band-Aids and a hall pass to sec the nurse."

He said that a parent's love is critical to the upbringing of a child. "We know young people can grow up by themselves, but they can't be raised by themselves." 
Bennett defended this by say­ing that family. should be viewed as "a trust held by par­ents on behalf of their children. A family's first object of love and attention must be its chil­dren." 
In addition to the family, Bennett also emphasized the role of.America's schools "to help instill sound and full char­acter in our children." 
He said that the problem with the current educational system is that "we are still waffling on the need to teach the tougher­minded virtues, like self-disci­pline and self-control, individ­ual and civic responsibility, perseverance, and hard work. To neglect these is a mistake." 
However, Bennett warned that the government cannot provide all the solutions to these problems. 
"Great as it might be," he said, "government has never raised a child. And it never will." 
Bennett said that society must be the primary agent for moral education. 
"The state does not, cannot, and even should not always piek up where families and in­dividuals leave ofT," he said. 
On the other hand, Bennett said, "a decent society will not nourish or decay because of what goes on in Congressional committees, the courts, state houses or even the White House. Because regeneration comes from within." 
Students attend conference Senate continues budget debate 

on the environment at Ill. 
By CAROL DOMINGUEZ 
News Writer 
Forty Notrcl Dame and Saint Mary's students recently at­tended the nation's largest stud IHl t Pnviro nmen tal confenHJce held on the earnpus of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. 
More than 7,000 college and university students from over 1,000 campuses attended the CATALYST conference held Oct 5-7. The student nnvironmental leaders met to plan an nnvironmental agrnda for tlw I !J90s. 
Most of tlw NI> students partir.ipating in the eonferenee wnm members of thn local chapter of the 
S.E.A.C. (Students for En vi ron nw ntal Action Coalition l. Amy Jenista, prnsid1mt of the club, said that tlw group rnturned with defi­nihl plans to address environ­mental issues at Notre Dame. 
Speakers included Hobert Bedford, Halph Nader and .Jesse .Jaekson. Although their spnechns were laced with statistics concerning the nnvironmnnt, Jenista said that they elicited a strong emotional response from the students. 
Nader spoke of student effi­caey in the area of corporate responsibility. Jenista said that he focused on corporate accountability and stressed that students should play a major role in enforcing eorporate "conscience" in the area of environment. 
After a march through Champaign, student delegates from foreign countries spoke of environmental issues facing their own countries. Jenista said that she was particularly struck by a Chinese student who had graduated from ND. lie said that he had contacted an underground revolutionary from his homeland who asked him to remember to campaign for environmental rights as well as human rights. 
.Jenista said the remainder of the conference centered around workshops that stressed local and campus activism. The students attended different sessions in order to pool their in­formation. SEAC is now "overflowing with ideas," Jenista said. 
The chapter hopes to focus on the issues of energy conservation, food choice and corporate divestment at the University. "We plan to become more active and implement more projects on campus," Jenista said. 
"The new generation of students will point the way to heightened environmental activism and help mobilize thousands of people around the environmental issues,"she said. 

WASHINGTON (AP} -Senate leaders Wednesday night scrambled for support for a $250 billion deficit-reduction plan that would double gasoline taxes, cut Medicare benefits and mildly boost income taxes on the wealthy. 
The measure includes a broader-based tax increase than the soak-the-rich House version that President Bush has said he will veto. 
Democratic and Republican leaders spent much of the day trying to line up enough votes to defeat what they called a killer amendment that would strip the gasoline tax boost from the measure. The amend­ment by Sen. Steve Symms, R­ldaho, would cost nearly $43 billion in revenues over five years. 
"We're either going to come out of this exercise with a $500 billion deficit-reduction pack­age, or with nothing," warned Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine. 
As debate began, Democratic Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said, "We tell the American people

ND needs better concerts than New Kids 
It's just damn de­pressing around here lately. Just last week we lost at home to a bunch of Ivy Leaguers whom a high-school team could beat. Then during the week we fell out of U.S. News Mike Owen and World Report's Top 25 National Uni-News Copy Editor versities. 

You might ask, "Mike, what can possibly shock us now?" Well, if you think you've cried your last golden tear for a while, just wait: THE NEW KIDS ARE COMING! 
Yes, that's right. In just a few short weeks our friends from SUB will be bringing us Jordan, Danny, Johnny, Donnie, and Joey. 
Go ahead. Let it out. Have a primordial yell or an earth shattering scream. Our campus is being invaded by the Titans of Top-Forty, the Princes of Pre-Pubescence, the Commandants of Cosmetics: the NEW KIDS. 
What is this University coming to? Our "army" lost the big battle, we were academ­ically ridiculed and now, instead of locusts we get THE NEW KIDS! 
More importantly, the Notre Dame con­cert scene has been definitely lacking in the last couple of years. Recent examples in­clude Barry Manilow, Def Leppard, Richard Marx, and now, ZZ Top. 
Last year seemed to be an oasis in this fog 
of eternal bad taste. R.E.M played a decent 
(yet overrated) show, as did Squeeze. So, 
we were a little behind in the times for the 
ascent of these bands, but remnants of 
something decent i§ better than nothing. 
Maybe it's just me, but don't names like 
Def Leppard or the "new" Van Halen remind 
you of junior high? Those bands were great 
back then, but now we are in college. Hope­
fully we have gained something during our 
collegiate transition. 
The Student Union Board should take 
some initiative and book an alternative 
band instead of the typical mainstream 
bands they have booked in the past. These 
bands might not appeal to everyone in the 
South Bend community, but they would have 
a large following among the students here. 
If the acts aren't going to sell out with 
just Domers, then why don't they book them 
in a place like Theodore's. 
Remember De La Soul? They were an al­
ternative success minus a few problems. 
Not only were the students satisfied, hut 
many of them got their first glimpse inside 
that underground mecca called Theo's. 
The prospective concertgoer at Notre 
Dame appears to have three choices: (a) 
demand we have Dread Zeppelin or another 
alternative band booked by Spring, (b) put 
on your chest size button of your favorite 
New Kid and take a St. Joe's 9th grader to 
the concert, or (c) NO's favorite method of 
avoiding an issue-crank up Billy Joel's 
Greatest Hits Volumes I &II and pound 
thirty Old Milwaukees. It's your choice.

Professor speaks on the effects of language in international relations 
By SCOTT KEEGEL 
News Writer 
l.an~uagP plays a major role in domestie and international rPlations, according to Carol Cohn of Harvard University, 
Cohn said language can, "prevent good thinking" or even "stop thinking altogether." An Pxample she provided was the usn of the word "deterrent" to justify nuclear arms. 
Application of such vocabu­lary can help to end some unePrlainties about nuclear weapons by placing a definitive answer in the middle of all the "what ifs" and moral issues, aeeording to Cohn. 
She said labeling someone such as Saddam Hussein as "another Hitlt~r" brings about thoughts of the terrors of World War II and thP atrocities of the holoeaust.

United States can (ease objec­tions to) mobilization," she said. 
Cohn spoke of the role of Third World countries and how they are perceived by security and defense analysts. While working within the defense analysis circles she said she was "flo.ored" by how Third World countries were spoken about as factors in U.S.-Soviet relations rather than as sepa­rate entities. 
In the meantime, Third World countries are viewed as strictly independent threats by many others, she said. 
"After all, they (Third World countries) are unpredictable since they have a complete lack of impulse control and are very apt to have maniacal leaders," she said.

Cohn also discussed world se­curity in the post-Cold War era. She told the audience of an ar­ticle in Atlantic magazine which said that "the mathematical likelihood of conflict in Europe is more likely" without the bal­ance of power present during the Cold War. 
The United States, among others will have to take a close look at its policy dealings with some countries (namely Ger­many, Poland, and Czechoslo­vakia) in the future, she said.

Prof. speaks on economic impact of disarmament 
By KATE MANUEL 
News Writer 
The economic impact of dis­armament may be negative and costly in the short term, but it will definitely include positive benefits for the consumer in the long run, according to Jurgen Brauer, visiting associate pro­fessor of business administra­tion and economics at Saint Mary's. 
Brauer, a visiting faculty fel­low at Notre Dame's Institute for International Peace Studies, helped to organize "Economic Issues of Disarmament," a con­ference for Economists Against the Arms Race, to be hosted by the Institute Nov. 30 to Dec. 1. 
The negative economic im­pacts of disarmament include the lay-offs that will occur when the military sector is con­verted to civilian production and the costs of cleaning up ar­eas that were formerly devoted to military production, accord­ing to Brauer. 
"(For) those workers that presently produce war materi­als, it might mean they lose their jobs," said Brauer. "What do they do? Will South Bend lose a thousand jobs? And, that would mean less money for the government. Disarmament may be costly in the short run." 
However, disarmament will also have positive economic ef­fects, as those workers who formerly produced for the mili­tary begin producing consumer goods that civilians want, and as there are greater opportuni­ties for trade with the Soviet Union, he said. 
"It is possible that workers can be more productive in pro­ducing civilian goods than in armament production," said Brauer. "Economists have been working along these lines for at least two hundred years. Economists have in general

"In producing for war society loses something," he said. "It loses the labor of those who produce missiles; labor that could have gone into producing tables and chairs." 
The papers and discussions presented at this conference will reaeh and affect the gen­eral public in a variety of ways, according to Brauer. 
"We have benn in negotiation with publishers to produce a scholarly conference volume. There is also the possibility of video-taping," he said. "Students in my classes down the road might have to read the papers. The discussions may also influence the testimony that conference participants might be called on to give in Congress or at conferences." 
The three day conference will be divided into eight sessions focusing on different economic concerns, including the conver­sion of the military sector to civilian uses, the effects or dis­armament on international trade, the impact of disarma­ment on Third World develop­ment and the environmental impact of disarmament. 
There will also be one session open to the public, which Brauer encourages everyone to attend. 
While this is the first such conference to be sponsored by Economists Against the Arms Race, a group formed in December 1988, Brauer said he likes the notion that sueh a conference might become an annual or biannual oecurrenee. 
"I would hope that this would be a continual effort," he said, "but I am very happy to be hav­ing a conference on the eco­nomic issues of disarmament as opposed to the economic issues of armament."

And the White House said the 

Senate version could form the 
basis for ending the govern­
ment's long budget stalemate. 
"The White House is ready to 

receive the bipartisan package 
similar to the Senate package," 
said Bush's chief of staff, John 
Sununu. "Get it to the presi­
dent's desk and he'll sign it." 
The administration also said 

Bush might not shut down the 
government Saturday if law­
makers show good faith 
progress toward a deficit-re­
duction package. Sununu said 
Bush might sign legislation 
keeping the government 
operating if it included budget­
cutting provisions that "show 
Congress meant business about 
it." 
Until now, the president has tried to keep the pressure on by threatening to shut the gov­ernment down unless Congress sends him a full budget he can accept. Without emergency leg­islation, federal authority to spend money expires at 12:01 
a.m. Saturday. 
Acting one day after the Democrats pushed a bill much tougher on the rich through the House, Senate leaders chose to face Election Day just three weeks off with a proposal bearing all the marks of a polit­ical compromise. 
There would be limits on de­ductions for people with in­comes exceeding $100,000, but no boost in tax rates for the rich as the House approved. The 9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax would be doubled, but the earned-income tax credit for the poor would increase, too. 
The package would shave about $250 billion from the federal deficit over the next five years by raising $142 billion in new taxes and paring Medicare, farm support and other benefit programs. Savings in other bills -mainly defense cuts ____,. would bring total deficit-reduction to about $500 billion, including

Bush had threatened to veto the House bill because of its in­crease in the upper bracket in­come tax rate. Though adminis­tration officials objected to some provisions in the Senate version, Sununu said in an in­terview on NBC-TV the presi­dent liked the compromise. 
Despite the pi an's powerful supporters, the Senate's Demo­cratic and Republican leaders spent the day defending their plan from lawmakers unhappy for regional or philosophical reasons. 
Western senators complained that the higher gasoline tax would be a severe blow to states such as theirs, where people routinely drive long dis­tances. Others insisted that the bill's overall tax package was unnecessary, that spending should have been cut more deeply instead. 
"Grab your wallets and run for cover because Congress is getting up a head of steam to raise your taxes," said Symms.

With the recent increase in crime on campuses across the country, several universities have taken steps to ensure the safety of their students. 
The University of South Carolina-Columbia, has special festivities throughout October, National Crime Prevention Month. 
The university, student gov­ernment and safety force joined resources at an outdoor fair where the main attraction was the distribution of safety whis­tles, according to Lieutenant Weaver Grayson, training offi­cer of USC Security.

these tri-tone whistles have been distributed. Students at­tach the whistles to their key chains and use them to attract attention if a problem would ever occur. 
"Even if the students don't need the whistles because of a problem, they are a good re­minder to walk in pairs and to take other safety precautions," Grayson said. 
Because of the increased awareness of campus safety, emergency responsl;_l call boxes have been installed around the USC campus, he said. 
On campus, Notre Dame Se­curity and Student Government have been working together in order to increase crime preven­tion. 
According to Rob Pasin, stu­dent body President, an emer­gency response telephone sys­tem will be installed on campus by spring break. Last year, Student Government organized the SafeWalk student escort service, Pasin said. 
"We've never discussed han­dling whistles, but if security feels it would make a difference and if it would not be cost pro­hibitive, we'd like to do any­thing we can to help," Pasin said. 
"Whistles are not a bad idea as long as they are taken seri­ously," said Chuck Hurley, as­sistant director of Notre Dame Security. "However, they don't take the place of common sense."

ceived Russian stackable dolls which it markets as souvenirs. McDonald's has not received revenues but reinvests in the Soviet Union so it will be able to open more chains. 
Another impediment to forming a Western economy is the lack of trade laws. Copyc right laws do not exist in the Soviet Union. Marzke brought up the example of a computer software designer who made little profit off of his programs since there was no law against pirated copies. There has been no need for copyright laws since the government has had control of all production. 
Marzke suggested that there was a need for a change in atti­tude by the people. 
Association president, Chet Kaminski, asked if there was hope with the younger genera­tion. In speaking with younger Soviet citizens, Marzke found them to be more receptive to change. "Children there are learning English and think Western," he said. 
The present working class has no incentive to work since they do not feel rewarded for their effort. There is no mone­tary incentive because their currency is relatively worthless. Most have plenty of money but nothing to spend it on. In addi­tion there is no sense of job in­security which prompts people to work harder. Unemploy­ment does not exist in the So­viet Union, workers are simply moved to another area if their performance is poor. 
The other major difficulty that must be solved is one of unity. "Gorbachev was riding a horse that has now become a bucking bronco which is out of control," said Marzke. Ethnic unrest can only be solved through a sense of leadership and with confidence in both the country's economy and its lead­ership. Once some of the inner strife has been put to rest eco­nomic changes can be made more smoothly. 
Marzke remarked that he did not think that his visit had sig­nificant impact on Soviet com­puter security procedures. The EDP auditor for CMS Manal!e­
ment Systems applied for the program because of his interest in the changes in the Soviet Union and a "naive notion that I could help." Although Marzke thinks that there are many hurdles left to overcome, rapid changes in the Soviet Union make a Western style economic system a growing possibility.

Business ethics: An oxymoron? 
By Father Oliver Williams 
In reeent weeks we have been overwhelmed by reports in 
the media of ethical failures in business. Whether it be the 
shady deals of financial genius Michael Milken or the irre­
sponsibility of Denver's Silverado Banking, Savings and 
Loan, the American people are increasingly angry that the 
ethical business executive seems to be a dying breed. What 
can we do to assure ourselves of a better ethical climate in 
business today? More specifically, how can I prepare myself 
so that I am not the Michael Milken of tomorrow? 
In my view, a major benefactor for ethics teaching and re­
search at Harvard Business School, John Shad, stated the 
challenge well. Shad, former ambassador to the Nether­
lands, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and most recently top officer of Drexel, Burn­
ham, Lambert, Inc., put it this way: "The (business) schools 
must hone their ability to certify that their graduates have 
the character and integrity to use the knowledge gained for 
the benefit-rather than the abuse-of society" (The Wall 
Stroet .Journal, July 27, 1987, p. A19). 
.John Shad, by emphasizing the need for character analysis, 
or 'virtue theory', pointed to the single weakness in the pre­
sent state of the field of business ethics. What Shad, and I 
dare say, all of us want in the business world is not simply 
people who know what principled action is, but rather peo­
ple who exhibit uncommon virtue in maintaining allegiance 
to their principles. That is, we want people of character. 
How does one grow in those human strengths or virtues 
that are so admired in the character of a Jim Burke of J&J 
or a Bill Hewlett of Hewlett Packard? The point here is that 
much of the behavior that is cited as exemplary in the corpo­
rate world, for example the Tylenol decision by Johnson & 
.Johnson or the Hely product recall decision by Proctor and 
Gamble, is not sufficiently explained as just principled action. 
Hathor, what made the top management of these firms cor­
porate heroes in the eyes of many is that they exhibit un­
common virtue in maintaining allegiance to their principles. 
This was demonstrated, for example, in the courage to act 
to protect human welfare even in the midst of incomplete in­
formation, as well as in the integrity and humility in com­
municating with consumers about possible difficulties with a 
product. Some of the virtues highlighted for the professions 
by one ethicist advocating a theory of virtue include perse­
verance, courage, integrity, compassion, candor, fidelity, 
prudence, public-spiritedness, justice and humility. 
Where the virtue of fidelity serves as the glue of a business organization, there is a promise by business to its public that every effort will be made to look out for human welfare within the limits of its operation. The Johnson & Johnson Tylenol withdrawal was not so much a matter of telling the truth (principled action) as it was of being true to its promise (virtuous action). 
The very virtues which may prevent us from going the way of the white collar criminals so prominent in the press today are the same ones that enable us to live in a community here at Notre Dame. To live a humane life with others we develop certain virtues or skills such as honesty, truthfulness, com­passion, loyalty and justice. Often ethical failures are the re­sult of these virtues being eclipsed by the values so dominant in our culture today: efficiency and effectiveness. While effi­ciency and productivity are clearly important, when they be­come the only values reinforced in an organization, slowly people are molded to do whatever will get the job done with­out adverting to broader considerations. Expediency rules the day and business ethics does indeed become an oxy­moron. 
Theories of principles need to be complemented by virtue theory-rules need a context or vision. However, there is also a less obvious point here: In our own professional life we need more than a set of rules to maintain our ethical bearings, we need a vision and set of habits or virtues. We should all have an idea of the sort of person we would like to become and the sort of families and communities we would like to form. The central questions then become: "What sort of person am I shaping?" and "What sort of organization am I shaping?" Is it the sort of person that I want to be? ... the sort of organization I want to be part of? Had Michael Milken or the Silverado crowd asked those questions along the way they might not be where they are today. 
Father Williams is an associate provost and a teacher and researcher specializing in the area ofbusiness ethics. 

Soviets attempt capitalism 

By CATHLEEN MCLAUGHLIN Business Writer 
The Soviet Union's efforts toward a Western-style econ­omy was the focus of a speech by Dave Marzke at the Michi­ana chapter of the National As­sociation of Accountants meet­ing Wednesday. 
Marzke had visited the Soviet Union for three weeks in May as a computer security special­ist with the Citizens as Ambas­sadors program. During his stay in Moscow, Minsk, and Leningrad, Marzke had an op­portunity to observe the chang­ing economic system. 
The Soviet Union's switch to­ward capitalism has left some hurdles to overcome. 
The central economic plan­ning system has caused the most difficulty, particularly be­cause of the central pricing sys­tem followed by the govern­ment, said Marzke. Prices of both inputs and outputs are legislated by the government rather than determined by the market. This method makes it difficult for supply and demand to equilibrate. 
Government regulated prices 
DaveMarzke 
along with imposed annual quotas also make the economy unstable. The quotas are not based oa any sort of demand analysis so variations in taste tend to cause shortages. Citi­zens do not have the option of going to another store or pro­ducer because there is no com­petition. 
You can usually find what you are looking for, as long as it is not something that is in short supply, but your choice is very limited, Marzke said. However, if you can't find it in the stores there is a "healthy black mar­ket'' in operation. Most items tend to be stolen or homemade since selling government items would be too risky. 

To assist the transition to 

capitalism many Western com­panies have become involved in joint ventures in Hussia. 
The 'cooperatives', as they are referred to, are self funding companies which receive no support from the government. Cooperatives are still required to adhere to government regu­lations and high taxes are le­vied against them. The high taxes function to bring in Eu­ropean money which helps the Soviet economy. 
Currently, Pepsi, Ben and Jerry's and McDonald's are a few of the companies involved in joint ventures in the Soviet Union. The Western companies do not take money out of the Soviet Union, since Soviet money is worthless in Western markets. 
Instead, companies take their revenues in the form of goods. Pepsi has received shipments of 
vodka  to  sell  in  the  United  
States.  Ben and Jerry's has re-

Housing starts continue to decline 
Eight-month slump is the longest on U.S. record 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Hous­
ing starts skidded 0.6 percent 
in September, continuing an 
eight-month slide that has be­

record, the government said 
Wednesday. Analysts foresee no 
improvement before next year. 
"The expectation is, we will

F. Seiders, chief economist with the N a tiona! Association of Home Builders. 
"The basic trend ... is declin­ing levels of new construction" through the first quarter,

The Commerce Department said starts of new homes and apartments fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.14 million units on top of a 1 per­cent drop in August. 
It was the first time starts had fallen for eight consecutive months since the department began recording them in 1959. And the September level was the lowest since construction fell to 1.05 million units in Au­gust 1982 during the last re­cession. 
Seiders said the Home Builders are forecasting starts to total just 1.04 million this year, down from 1.38 million in 1989 and 1.49 million in 1988. Already, starts are off 10.4 percent from the first nine September alone, when another 20,000 jobs were lost, he

Building  permits,  often  a  

barometer of future construc­tion activity, did not suggest improvement either. They were down 4.2 percent to an annual rate of 1.01 million applications on top of a 3.0 percent drop the previous month. 
The weakness in the housing industry has resulted in the loss of 311,000 construction jobs since last February, Seiders said. Construction unemploy­ment totaled 11.8 percent in tempted to beat a deadline for expensive new regulations de­signed to make apartments more accessible to the handi­capped. 
Other problems for both sin­gle-and multi-family construc­tion, Peach added, included high interest rates and limited sources of financing following the savings and loan crisis. 
Starts dropped 11 percent, to an annual rate of 105,000 units, in the Northeast and 4.4 percent, to 328,000 units, in the West. 
However, starts rose 3.3 per­cent, to 249,000 units, in the Midwest and 3 percent, to 453,000 units, in the South. 
'McPaper', 'McDome'-What's next? McDonald's markets pizza 
OWENSBOHO, Ky. (AP) ­Stacy Mcintire and her visitors want11d something with cheese and sauce, so they did the obvi­nus thing at a not-so-obvious plaee. 
They went out for pizza -at McDonald's. 
"We had company over and we fed four people on two piz­zas for something like $12," she said. "We went to the drive­through and didn't even have to get out of the car. We got it in five minutes." 
Pizza, in the land of all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions and sesame-seed buns? Is this a fast-food induced nightmare? 
Not at all. McDonald's, which for years counted its ham­burger sales in the billions, may soon be counting pizza, pasta and other non-traditional offerings in an attempt to boost siuggish U.S. dinner sales. 

Owensboro's four Golden Arches and 10 others across the Ohio River in Evansville, Ind., are among 240 restau­rants nationwide which are test-marketing tomato pies. The 12-inch pies also are being tested in Las Vegas; Hartford, Conn.; Fresno, Calif.; and sub­urbs of Chicago. 
"Our customers are interested in a little more variety and more choices," said Melissa Oakley, spokeswoman at Mc­Donald's Corp.'s Oak Brook, Ill., headquarters. "But we have to be very careful in what we choose. We're still committed to serving a limited menu." 
McDonald's, held up by many as a model American corpora­tion, has long been committed to test marketing. Salads, the McDLT and Chicken McNuggets made the grade; the Hula-burger-two slices of cheese with a slice of grilled pineapple on a toasted bun, did not. 
McDonald's sacrificed fresh dough for frozen in its attempt to make pizza a fast food. Some customers say the dough will be the pizza's downfall. 
"It tastes like cardboard," said 16-year-old Josh Hamburg of Owensboro.

Inhumane research procedures torture animals without benefit for humanity 
Dear Editor: 
October 20, 1990, could be one of the most exciting days for Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students this year. The day will entail cheering, party­ing, tailgating and just plain going nuts. Yet this is not all that will occur. Grace Hall's 24 Hour Run 1990 will have kicked off its fund-raising for the Northeast Neighborhood Center. 
The Center, located at 803 North Notre Dame Avenue, helps families and residents of the neighborhood who are not in the best of situations. Activities include trash cleanup, dealing with area recreational problems, the establishment of the "Neighborhood Watch" program to reduce crime and technical assistance to elderly and low-income homeowners. Also, volunteers of the Center have distributed basic food and clothing commodities to hun­dreds of local residents. 
To run the Center, about $15,000 is needed annually. The state used to fund the

Center, but since 1984 the grant has not been renewed. This is where the community's help and fund-raisers like Grace Hall's 24 Hour Run is needed to maintain the operation of the Center. 
Starting at noon on Friday, Oct. 19, Digger Phelps, Tim Roemer and students of Grace will be taking turns running around the campus. However, this unbelievable accomplish­ment in itself will not raise the money. A tent will be set up in the Fieldhouse Mall where Grace residents will be asking for donations. Note: these stu­dents are not going to harm you, so avoiding or ignoring them is unnecessary. A gift of loose change, a bill, or more will be greatly appreciated by the Northeast Neighborhood Center. 
To make this exciting week­end complete, remember Grace Hall's 24 Hour Run and its need for donations.

Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to the article by Shannon Ryan (The Observer, Oct. 10) which explained Dr. Richard Doyle's view that medical research us­ing animals is necessary and acceptable. As a person con­cerned with animal welfare, I would like to challenge his views and balance the article with some additional informa­tion. 
First, Dr. Doyle mis­characterizes the position of animal rights groups when he says that they "attempt to con­fer human rights upon animals and present them as equals." The views of Peter Singer, a leading authority on the animal rights movement, are articu­lated in the book Animal Liberation. Singer makes it clear that animal rights ac­tivists do not claim that animals are equal to humans, but merely that animals share with humans the capacity to feel pain, and that their pain should 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to the Viewpoint letter entitled, "Cancellations cost students a bundle," (The Observer, Oct. 11). In the letter, three Lewis 
_women complained that for each cancelled class, the University was cheating them out of their $26.67 of paid tu­ition. I would like to ask, "Do you actually think you can buy an education?" Learning can be attained practically free; the only costs are the investment of some time and a lot of initiative. Almost anyone can pick up a book at the local library and not be discounted. 
I also disagree with Dr. Doyle's portrayal of the existing state of animal research and the laws which govern it. He implies that most research is humane and of great benefit to mankind, when in fact the majority of animal research is severely painful and unrelated to saving human lives. Moreover, the federal Animal Welfare Act and funding re­quirements provide little pro­tection for research animals. While the act provides for cer­tain constraints on research using cats, dogs and primates (an estimated five percent of animal research), no procedure is actually illegal. Researchers can and do burn, freeze, elec­trocute, starve, poison, drown, blind and dismember live ani­mals without anesthetic. 
Finally, I would like to emphasize that the views of Dr. Doyle are not representative of the medical profession. A growing number of physicians are objecting to the use of ani­mals in biomedical research. The non-profit organization "Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine" is a group of physicians who oppose research on animals and promote alternatives including cell, organ, tissue and bacteria cultures, clinical and epidemio­logical surveys and mathematic and computer models. The group has begun to impact the medical community's views on animal research. For example, in the past two years, twelve medical schools have stopped using dogs as part of their educational curriculum. 
Because an estimated 40 million animals are used each 
· year in the United States for research purposes, and such research is largely paid for with tax dollars, the issue is deserving of public concern.

Most students agree that sit­ting in a classroom for the full fifty minutes does not guaran­tee any additional learning. The fact remains that the material learned in the classroom is a minute aspect of students' edu­cation. So, what does tuition money pay for? The answer is obvious: a Notre Dame degree. 
A Notre Dame degree opens the world to students. if they want it to. The four years which students purchase expose them to an infinite number of experiences, ranging from free

'The Happy Hooker' 
Security guard Jeanne Miller latch-hooks aspects of NO life for Lyons Hall 
By LISA EATON 
Accent Writer 
A visit to Lyons Ilall is no lonw~r complntn without a visit to thn now famous latch-hook rugs (at lnast among Lyonites) of Jnannn Milh~r. the hall's se­curity guard for thn past sixteen ynars. 
For many years now Joanne has lwPn hooking her way into tlw !warts of all who meet her and she has definitely left her mark upon tlw halls of Lyons. Tlw latrh-hook portraits of Fr. llnsburgh and Lyons llall arn continual rnmindnrs of all that .Jeanrw has donn for Notre Damn and for "her girls" at Lyons llall. 
.Jnanne started this hobby many ymtrs ago to give herself sornnthing to do to while away the many quiet hours of the night. .Jeanne's youngest daughter, Lori, had a kit that somnonn had given her for Christmas that she did not have thn tirnn to start. One night .leannn gave it a try, and the rnst, as they say, is history. She fnll in love with it immediately and has benn hooked ever sincn. Shn was dubbed "The Ilappy !looker" because of her nnw found hobby. 
Through tlw ynars, .Jeanne has passnd from a rank ama­tnur to a latch-hook profes­sional. Slw now dnsigns hHr work lwrsnlf. Thn enormous rug of Lyons llall was her first major work and she has now progrnssPd to portraits of such Notrn Damn favorites as FathHr Tlwodon~ llesburgh and Lou lloltz. 
Last ynar .Jnannn celebrated hnr fiftnenth anniversary as a security guard at Lyons Hall. 
During thn surprisn party the hall threw for her, she was fi­nally able to present Father Ilesburgh with the rug that had been sitting in her closet for two years. Now framed and hanging in a prominent position in the dorm, the latch-hook is a reminder to all not only of the great things Father llesburgh has done for Notre Dame but also of all the great things Jeanne has done for Notre Dame. 
Jeanne started working at Notre Dame in 1974 when Lyons was first converted to a women's dorm. She remembers her first night vividly. "The night was so wild and crazy. We had a brand new rector, assistant rector, and five R.A.s and me. We hardly knew what we were doing. This was all so new to us." 
Despite some initial frustra­tions and crazy times, Jeanne cannot imagine doing anything else. "If is wasn't for the girls and the people, I wouldn't have stayed all these years. I would really miss it. I'll walk by rooms, and I'll still remember from.. years back who lived hern. 
She still keeps in touch with all of the rectors with whom she has worked throughout the years. "Closeness with the staff has kept me here for all these years," statns Jeanne. Her job keeps her young, she says, be­cause she has to keep up on all of the latest college "lingo." 
Jeanne can certainly tell many stories about her years at Lyons from the wild and crazy 1970's when there was no alco­hol policy of any importance to today. Jeanne has watched many generations of students

pass through the university, and she thinks that students are getting more mature and responsible each year. 
Jeanne has put her many life experiences, including those that occurred in Lyons, into words. She has written her life story entitled "Sentimental Journeys" which documents her life from the time she was five years old until the present. She has also written "Lyons-zoo-ol­ogy #101" which tells all about everything that she has seen, heard, and experienced as a se­curity guard for Lyons Hall. 
One of her favorite stories is about the winter of 1977 when it snowed so much that school was cancelled and everything was shut down. Jeanne carne to work through a snowstorm because she knew that they were going to need her that night. She ended up being stuck at Lyons, having to spend the night at the firehouse for two nights. She wrote in her book, "The students really started to 'climb the walls.' They ran out of beer and couldn't get out to buy any." When she returned a couple days later she brought apples and and "a lot of munchies [for] the girls." She was mobbed. Everything was gone in fifteen minutes. 
Jeanne says that she feels more like a house mother than a security guard. She is always there to take care of illnesses, injuries, and anything else that comes up during the night. She often walks the halls and sees people up typing papers and thinks to herself, "If I could only type her paper for her so she could go to bed." 
Being a good listener is an essential part of Jeanne's job. She has had men and women alike come to her in the middle of the night to just talk about whatever. She has been the first person that some have told of their engagements. She says, "I try not to give advise because I'm still learning, too, and I don't want to give the wrong advise, but I'm a good listener." 
When Jeanne is not busy working at Lyons, she is busy doing something else. Latch­hook is just one of her many hobbies. She knits; one winter she knitted over 250 navy and gold scarves for students and faculty. She is an interior dec­orator in her spare time, spe­cializing in Christmas trees. One Christmas Jeanne and her husband, Dale, had an upside down Christmas tree because "the world was turning upside down." 
She also golfs; she was one of the first women to join the Ladies Golf League at Notre Dame. Before Burke Memorial Golf Course would allow women on the course, Jeanne dressed up as a man because she was determined to play on Notre Dame's golf course. She made it to the fourth hole. 
Destiny seems to have brought Jeanne to Lyons Hall. She was born the same year Lyons was built. When Jeanne was younger and dating NO men, she broke parietals, ironi­cally, in the same dorm (thnn a male dorm) where she would end up enforcing parietals as a security guard. Many students and rectors have come and gone through Lyons, but Jeanne is always there, no matter what. 
Perhaps Jeanne was summed up best by the Lyonite who said, "She is sooo cool." That's Jeanne, security guard, house mother and woman of many hobbies. 

CBS' sitcom 'Uncle Buck' disappoints viewers with unsuccessful humor 
The endless pursuit for a new and humorous sitcom contin­ues, and it will still continue after viewing "Uncle Buck," for this program most definitely does not fill this gap. Continuing the trend of the cur­rent television season, "Uncle Buck" exhibits a lack of both humor and originality. 
"Uncle Buck" can be viewed on Monday nights at 7:00p.m. on CBS, and although hard to believe, it finds its basis in the movie of the same name. If the astute moviegoer is able to re­member, and it may be easy to forget this particular film, the reviews of "Uncle Buck" the movie were not tremendously stellar. John Candy was said to have a few moments of minor comedy, but the movie as a whole was average at best. 
Why would CBS then choose to base an entire series on a relatively unsuccessful movie? NBC seemed to make a better choice with "Parenthood," for that work did meet with a number of successful reviews, but CBS' decision seems a bit ridiculous. 
The background of "Uncle Buck" is easily understood, but then complexity is not a trade­mark of its genre. Uncle Buck Russel (Kevin Meany) has be­come the guardian of his late brother's three children. In his care are Tia (Dah-Ve Chodan), 
MARC JOHNSON 
TO BE CONTINUED... 
who is age 16, Miles (Jacob Gelman), who is 8, and Maizy (Sarah Martineck), who is 6. 
Buck is the antithesis of the man one would desire to care for the children. He is quite a slob, a bit ignorant, and some­what crude, but he is a Chicago Cubs fan, so he is definitely not all bad. 
Uncle Buck exhibits this well­meaning side in the episode this week. His girlfriend Stacy has returned, and the plot revolves around the conflict that Buck faces between his easy going past and the responsibility of his future. 
When Uncle Buck first re­unites with Stacy, his romantic intentions are stymied by the fact that he cannot find a baby­sitter for the two youngest children. Tia is finally bribed into the task. Buck asks Stacy, "How much money do you have?" When she responds $50, Buck says that won't do. When she then responds with a plane ticket (she is a stewardess}, Buck says that will do. Our only response can be that this hu­mor won't do. 
Buck does go on a date with Stacy, and their relationship is as strong as ever. It is so strong that Buck and Stacy decide to marry. The series here throws the viewer a major twist because instead of the children being a hindrance to the rela­tionship, they are the catalysts for Stacy's feelings. What a move of pure genius. In the end the romance dies because nei­ther party really asknd if they loved the other. 
If you just finished reading this last paragraph and are somewhat confused, then do not feel terribly upset. I had a very difficult time with the ro­mantic Buck Russel. A fat guy in a tight shirt and shorts is not my concept of a love machine. 
I had heard that "Uncle Buck" was a slightly off-color series, and I was hopeful that a couple crude jokes might have been learned before the demise of Buck and Stacy's fling. There was one joke about Miles writ­ing his name in the snow, but it seemed fairly tame. On a previ­ous show Maizy said to Miles "You suck," but college students have heard worse. 
In general, I was disappointed by the quality of "Uncle Buck" as I have been disappointed by most television series this fall season. Each is approached with an open mind, and perhaps the positive review is just around the corner. Then again, don't hold your breath.

Marino presents new problems for Patriots 
MIAMI lAP) -In a s1~ason t hat has hmm had news for the Nnw England Patriots, here's some more: Thny no longer 
have Dan Marino's numbnr. 
Thn Pats won six in a row against Marino's Miami Dolphins from 19X6 to 1988. holding his oiTnnsn to 10 points or lnss four tinws. But Marino has played well in his past three games against New England, and Miami has won tlwm all. 
Thn AFC East rivals meet again Thursday night at Jon Hobbie Stadium. Miami is 4-1 and shan~s the division lead with Buffalo; New England is 1-4 and has lost three consecutive gamns sincP Sf!Veral players were accusnd of sexually harrassing a female reporter. 
The Patriots have been outscored 111-40 during their losing streak. 
"No one really cares what our problems are." coach Hod Bust said. 
"It's a disappointing season right now for us," cornerback Honnie Lippett said. 
In the past, New England could count on getting well against Marino, who holds 18 NFL reeords. Statisties show that no team has done a better job of containing him. 
Marino has thrown more in­terceptions than touchdown passes against only one AFC team -the Patriots. They've intercepted Marino 27 times.

CAREER PLANNING 
Many students think a Notre Dame degree is all they need. Unfortunately, that isn't always the case. True, a degree from Notre Dame might get your foot in the door, but where you go from there will depend on many other factors. Mr. James Hunt, President of BDS, Incorporated will be honoring us with his insights as to what every undergraduate should be aware of when making decisions about their career. 
This is one in a series of four 
L.A.N.D. Lectures (Life After Notre Dame) presented to the student body. 
The lecture will start promptly at 7:15 pm in the Hesburgh Library.

The A's were expected to come to Cincinnati to begin their one­sided march to a series championship, a sweep even. Instead they return to Oakland in quite a spot.

The A team did not finish the race, and this dropped the team from a sure first-plaee finish to third out of four teams in the standings. Over the fall break, the team will compete in the Halloween Regatta at Cincinnati. Additionally, the club will be training on Lake Michigan for the National Sloop Championships, to be held at Annapolis. 
The team qualified for the nationals in these large-keeled boats earlier this season with a second-place finish at the Midwestern Collegiate Sailing Association sloop champi­onships at the Detroit Yacht Club. The Notre Dame Rugby Club faced the Kalamazoo Men's Club on Saturday, and was defeated, 38-19. The more experienced, bigger Kalamazoo players wore down the Irish in the 80-rninute match. Notre Dame trailed by only three at halftime, but was simply outmanned after that point, as the Kalamazoo team was able to put together several scores late in the game. This weekend, the Irish will face a new challenge as the Notre Dame Old Boys come back to South Bend to take on the youngsters. The Old Boys are a conglomeration of former Irish rugby players, convening on South Bend this weekend for the Irish-Miami Hurricanes football game. Last year, the Old Boys. many of whom still play organized rugby, defeated 
the Irish.

Saint Mary's volleyball team rallies to beat Indianapolis 
By EILEEN McGUIRE 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's volleyball team defeated Division II school Indianapolis in a nail-biting match, 15-13, 12-15, 13-15, 15­8, 15-11 on Tuesday. It was the last home game of the season for Saint Mary's, who begins a five-game road trip to Boston over midsemester break. 
The Belles were down two games to one but came back strong to win the final two games. In the third game, Saint Mary' jumped out to a 12-5 lead before falling, 13-15. 
"It goes back to the inconsis­tent style of play we've been trying to work through," said Saint Mary's head coach Sue Medley, "but in the games where we started out on a bad streak, we didn't let them (the Greyhounds) run on it." 
The Belles realized that they needed to work hard to win the next two games. In the fourth game, they gained a 5-0 lead on their way to a 15-8 win over the Greyhounds. 
In the last game· of the match, Saint Mary's seemed to have lost its concentration early in the game, falling behind 2-7. However, the Belles came back, playing as a team to tie the score, 8-8. In the forty minute see-saw battle, Saint Mary's came out victorious 15-11.

Off-Campus qualifies for Interhall playoffs 
By RENE FERRAN Sports Writer 

The interhall playoff picture cleared slightly last night as Off-Campus clinched a berth and Keenan was eliminated. 
ALUMNI 6 KEENAN 0 

The two defenses shined in this contest played. with in a 25 mph south wind. The game's only score was set up when at the Knight 33, Maier was flushed from the pocket and sacked from behind by Chris Jafford. The ball was knocked free, and Brendan Fitzpatrick recovered with 49 seconds left. 
Jim Passinault then led the no-huddle offense to perfection, finding Pete Parten for 22 yards and Caretta for nine more. After two incom­pletions, with no time left, Passinault found Parten in the middle of the end zone for the touchdown 
"On that last drive, I was thinking we had to suck it up and play like champions," said Parten. "We showed lots of composure out there." 
OFF-CAMPUS 22 DILLON 0 
The Off-Campus defense, led by Antoine Lark and John Schoen, rose to the occasion, holding Dillon to two first downs and nine total yards while the Crime rolled up 12 first downs and 202 yards on the ground. Phil Coury gained 90 yards on 15 runs and Brian Doherty 83 yards. 
"The key to any halfback's success is his line, and our line really did a number on them tonight," said Coury. 
The Crime scored just before halftime when Bob Allard lofted a pass over two Big Red defenders to Chuck Moser in the end zone from the 11. Off­Campus broke it open by dri­ving 65 yards to start the half, capping the drive on Allard's one-yard sneak. The Crime's final touchdown came on its next possession on a Doherty 34-yard run. 
"The line really gave me a lot of time to pass," said Allard (6­15, 57 yds, 1 int, 1 td). "I wasn't on tonight ... but [my receiving corps] made up for it with spectacular catches." 
SORIN 20 CARROLL 2 
The Otters closed an unde­feated season by overcoming an inspired Vermin attack. After a scoreless first quarter, Kevin Kramer found Vic Lombardi on a corner route with 5:20 in the second from 31 yards out. The TD was set up by a key fourth-down catch by Sean Ryan. 
Sorin then took the second­half kickoff and scored on a three yard counter run by Ryan keyed by a Kramer-to­Lombardi 62-yard hook-up. 
"I think our offense hit fifth gear tonight," said Lombardi. "We're definitely going into the playoffs on a high note." 
Sorin's last score came when Kramer hit Tim O'Shaughnessy, who broke two tackles and dove into the end zone. Carroll's points came on a safety when Chris Estes was tackled in the end zone by a host of Vermin.

Amy from Farley and six of her friends pooled their tickets in order to get home early and to make some needed money. She's received offers for their student tickets ranging from $30-$100 apiece, with the typical caller offering $50. 
''I'm hoping that other ticket sellers won't back down on their prices," says Amy, "because if they sell out, they'll ruin it for the rest of us who want to make a lot of money." 
For every seller, though, there has to be a buyer. Lloyd, an off­campus senior, noted that the phone has been ringing off the hook in response to his ad to buy a student ticket. Most callers are asking $50, al­though a few have been in the $75-$100 range. 
None of this should be any surprise to Bubba Cunning­ham, the Notre Dame ticket manager. His office fielded737 calls Tuesday, some for local concerts, but the majority of callers asking for tickets for the NO-Miami game. 
One person thought the per­sonal touch might get Bubba to send tickets. He wrote a letter claiming to be the biggest fan in Amsterdam, Ohio. As proof, he offered photos of his licens11 plate ("ROSARY"), the roof of his car sporting a replica of the Golden Dome, and his silo, complete with golden dome. It wasn't enough; he didn't receive tickets. 
Shane Hitzeman and Matt Helminiak have run an ad for Miami tickets for several days for friends from Boston College. Tickets selling for as high as $125 last week now are $50. "The price is dropping because people were holding out hopin demand would go up, and i just didn't happen," said Matt. 
Another Grace resident is in the market "to bring buyer and sellers together in friendly manner." He's fin din also that the market ha. collapsed recently. His ad als asks for GA's, but these are to hard to come by at the moment. 
"I expect the market to im prove greatly this weekend al the pep rally and before gam time," he said. "Hopefully, GA' will be more available with th influx of alumni." 
Not everyone, however, be lieves in the almighty power o the dollar. 
"There's no way I'd sell m Miami ticket," said senior Chri Sullivan. "No way I'd jeopardiz missing this, or any, game." 
"There's no way I'm going t miss the Miami game," said ju nior Katherine McCarthy. "It' dPfioitelv more imoortant tha

Reds enjoy 2-0 Series lead after come-from-behind victory over A's 
Pacers ride second-half spurt to beat Mavericks 

APF'rotl Cincinnati Reds right fielder Paul O'Neill watches his game-winning double to left field in the second game of the National League Championship series against Pittsburgh. 
CINCINNATI (AP) -Lose Game 1? No problem. But lose the first two games of the World Series, and even the Oakland Athletics consider themselves in a bit of a spot. Mter the Cincinnati Reds won 5-4 in 10 innings on Wednesday night to take a 2-0 lead in the World Series, the concept of losing dawned on the /\s for the first time. 
"What are you going to do?" third baseman Carney Lansford said. "You're either going to crawl in a hole and let them win or you stay and fight it O)lt. 
"We're the defending world champions. I'm not going to give anybody anything. If I'm going to go down I'm going to go down fighting."

The Indianapolis Pacers cruised to a 111-91 victory over the Dallas Mavericks after opening the second half with a 27-8 run which ran them out to a 30-point lead in an NBA exibition game Wednesday night at the Joyce ACC. 
Forward Chuck Person led the way for the Pacers with 24 points, while Reggie Miller added 17 and Rick Smits chipped in 16 points and 10 rebounds. 
The Mavericks, playing with­out injured stars Rolando Blackman (sore right knee) and Alex English (pulled ham­string), were led by center Roy Tarpley, who scored 14 points andadded 13rebounds. 
Indianapolis went with its starters for much of the game while Dallas opted to give some of its substitutes a chance to play in the absence of Blackman and English. The Pacers' starters averaged 28 minutes apiece, compared to 
Students flood market with Miami tickets 
By RENE FERRAN Sports Writer 
Eighty-five dollars was the magic figure for LuAnn, a freshman in Knott, to sell her Miami ticket. She wanted to get back to Pittsburgh in time to catch her friends before they went back to school. It took seven callers responding to her ad before finding her price. 
''I'm going to throw a party Saturday afternoon with my friends to watch the game," LuAnn said in defense. "I trea­sure my friendships back home...and I miss them."

21 1/2 minutes for the 
Mavericks. 

"For them (Dallas), this was a game to see what different players could do, since they didn't have those guys," said Smits. "They didn't put the emphasis on winning tonight." 
The Pacers, who did put more emphasis on winning, turned the tempo up a notch in the second half. Point guard Vern Fleming took advantage of numerous Dallas defensive lapses to drive the middle and convert easy layups and dish to Miller. 
Indianapolis took control of the game in the early going and never let Dallas get back in the game. The Pacers scored the first six points of the game, and increased their lead to 31-23 at halftime. By halftime it was 58-45, and then Indianapolis put the game away with the early second-half explosion. 
Still, the Pacers weren't en­tirely pleased with their per­formance. 
"Our only weakness seemed to be our rebounding. That was a definite weakness," Smits said, "but we still have got a bunch of (exhibition) . 
games left and we will just have to progress step by step." 
"The game turned out pretty good, we played excellent indi­vidual and team defense," Person said. "We ran the court really well, but we still gave up too many second shots." 
For Dallas, Randy White added 12 points and Lafayette Lever, acquired from Denver in the off-season, pitched in 11 to go with four assists. But the biggest cheer from the 2,362 fans at the JACC went up when Indiana graduate Steve Alford, who led the Hoosiers to a National Championship in 1986 and the United States Olympic team to a gold medal in 1984, scored his first basket. Alford fmished with six points for the Mavericks. 
Still, the game belonged to the Pacers, and Person credits his team's success to an un­selfishness which has surfaced this preseason. 
"Each guy has to be willing to pass the ball to the other guy," Person said. "Last year each guy was trying to make himself look better, but this year we're concentrating on making the other guy look better."

way to defending their World 
Series title. It was an unruffled 
room. Mter Game 2, the /\s looked a little more disbelieving, a little 
more shocked. They knew they had lost a game they could 
have won. 

They had been unable to de­liver an early knockout, and they allowed the Reds to hang around long enough to win on points. 
"We played better ball tonight than we did last night," Lansford said. "We pushed and pushed and pushed and we just couldn't get that big hit · late in the game, and they did." 1\velve of the first 23 A's to bat Wednesday night reached safely, and Oakland scored four times. But the other seven stranded runners represented wasted opportunities.

Sailors cop two thirds 
With the weather cooling off, many club teams at Notre Dame are heating up. 
The Sailing Club sent teams to two regattas this weekend and brought home two third-place trophies. 
The Irish sent a team to Columbus, Ohio for the Ohio State Fall Regatta. In the A division, the boat was skippered by freshman Michael Kane, with Laura Rolando deAgular Scully serving as crew. Patti Losinske Club Corner skippered the B boat, and Susie Tobin was the crew. Overall, the team finished third out of 18 boats. 

"I was pleased," said Kane. "I've done offshore sailing for years, but it's taken a while to get used to lake sailing." At the Lake Forest Regatta on Lake Michigan, the Irish suffered a bad break which cost them first place. The A boat, skippered by senior sailing aficionado Watts Hudgens, suffered a freak capsize while leading its race. "We were in first place by a good bit when we capsized," said 
see CLUBS I page 13 11, going 0-for-9 with runners in scoring position. 
This time the A's stranded two runners in the first, third and fourth innings. In the second, seventh and eighth, they stranded another runner each time. 
"As far as the offense is con­cerned, we got it going early today, but then all of a sudden nothing happened," first base­man Mark McGwire said. "That's not us. That's not the Oakland A's. 
"We've got to score in more than a couple of innings in a game and take the pressure off our pitching staff and keep them from having to shut them out the rest of the way. I mean that's tough to do." 
Nothing went right in Game 1, so it was easy to shrug off that one. 
see SERIES I page 13
