Controversial decision has broad implications 

WASIDNGTON [AP] -The Supreme Court was urged yester­day to decide whether special programs to aid racial minorities are valid and vital to society or whether they should be banned for illegally discriminating against whites. 
The view that the court's nine justices take in the reverse discri­mination case of Allan Paul Bakke could have a profound effect on the future of so-called affirmative ac­tion programs in education and business across the nation. 
Many civil rights leaders and constitutional scholars believe the court's decision will be its most important ruling on race relations since it banned segregation in 1954. A ruling is expected before the court concludes its current term next July. 
The case drew wide attention, and hundreds of people lined up outside the court building begin­ning Tuesday night to gain admis­sion to the session. 
"Allan Bakke's position is that he has a right not to be discriminat­ed against because of race," San Francisco attorney Reynold Colvin argued in urging the court to uphold a ruling by the California supreme court. 
The state court_ ruled that a special admissions program used by the University of California's medical school at Davis made Bakke a victim of racial discrimina­tion because it allowed less aca­demically qualified minority stud­Bakke. Bakke, a 37-year-old Sunnyvale, Calif., engineer with the nation's space program, suc­cessfully contended in state courts that he would have been admitted if the medical school had not set aside 16 of each year's entering class for minority students. 
The university appealed the Cali­fornia court's ruling, and its attor­ney argued that such a program is needed to aid persons "long vic­timized by racial discrimination.'' 
The attorney, former Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox, told the justices that "race may be taken into account for proper purposes" such as overcoming the effected of past oppression. 
While Cox's arguments focused on the rights of minorities to have a real opportunity for full member­ship in American society, Colvin's contentions centered on Bakke's rights as an individual to be treated equally. _Both attorneys said the Constitu­tion's 14th Amendment, which guarantees such equal protection, favored their positions. 
Each member of the court posed questions to the attorneys, the first coming only seven minutes after Cox began his presentation. 
Cox was joined by the Carter administration's solicitory general, Wade McCrae, who appeared as a friend of the court to urge the justices to overturn the California ruling. 
"To be blind to race today is to that governmental affirmative ac­tion programs have not yet a­chieved their stated goals of equal justice and equal opportunity. 
While Cox argued that the medical school program had the valid "objective of breaking down isolation,'' Colvin claimed that "race itself is an improper guide for selection to the medical school.' 
While Colvin said the California court was correct in its finding that "there were alternatives" to a race-conscious admissions policy, Cox contended, "The other alter­natives suggested simply will not work " 
Cox and Calvin also entered into a semantic discussion over whether the admissions program at Davis represented a ''racial quota.'' 

Colvin charged that it did, that a certain number of medical class seats were reserved for racial minority members therefore limit­ing the seats for which whites such as Bakke could compete. 
Cox said the program was "not a quota, at least as I would use the word." 
He stressed that only "qualified" minority applicants were admitted under it. 
But Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., asked, "Does it really matter what we call this program?" 
Cox agreed that the central issue was whether the university's pro­gram could "take race into ac­count." 
The 
Many of the justices' questions centered not on the constitutional question but one of federal law. 
The California courts found that the program not only violated the Constitution's 14th Amendment but also a portion of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 wh~ch prohibits racial discrimination in education programs receiving federal fund­
ing. 
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justices William J. Brennan, Jr., and Byron R. White pressed Colvin and Cox on whether the case could be decided without reaching 
the constitutional questions. If the court takes such a route, the chances of an expected "land­mark" decision would decline.

to attempt his release from prison or to assassinate the President. 
For two years, Bugliosi inves­tigated, interviewed, and prac­tically lived with the Manson family. This investigation led Bugliosi to repeatedly warn the 
F.B.I. that persons such as "Squeaky" Fromme were dan­gerous and capable of attempted presidential assassinations. 
In his case study of the "Manson mentality," Bugliosi reveals the surprising and often misunder­stood facts about the family's background, their philosophy, and how the different types, from class president to child molester came to truly believe Charles Manson was Jesus Christ. 
The motive for the killings -to ignite a black-white Armageddon called Helter Skleter in which Manson would emerge the ultimate victor, and the suport they found for their beliefs-in the Bible and in the lyrics of the Beatles which they splashed across the walls in the victims own blood, are examined in Bugliosi's book. 
Now in private practice in Los Angeles, Bugliosi is currently wor­king to re-open the files on Robert Kennedy's assassination based on new evidence which, he feels, points to Sirhan Sirhan's frame-up and the existence of a "second assassin.''

Off-campus burglaries continue 

by Brlgid Rafferty Staff Reporter 
An electric typewriter, calculator and portable television set were stolen from the home of Notre Dame law student Scott Sullivan, 802 East Corby Street, sometime on Tuesday afternoon. 
South Bend police said that the robbery probably occurred between 1 p.m., when Sullivan left his house, and 5 p.m. when his upstairs neighbors returned and noticed that his rear door was partly open. 
"I think that the thief entered by kicking in a bas.ement ~indow," 
said Sullivan. "l rememoer com­ing home on Monday afternoon and finding the basement door open,

The need for a change in society's attitudes toward career women's roles was the basic theme presented by Carol Glass, a profe.s­sor of psychology at Notre Dame, in her lecture last evening at Lewis Hall. The lecture, the first in a series on the new role of women in the world presently being spon­sored by the joint academic com­missioners of the women's halls, was titled "Women, Careers and Marriage''. 
Glass advised the women in attendance to "make sure you know where your future husband stands"beforedeciding to become a ''two-career woman''. She said that marriages often suffer because women feel wronged by having to work and perform the traditional but I didn't think anything of it.

"When we hear of an area where special problems are occurring, we try to get more police cars there to deter to crime," he added.

to a letter he sent to Dr. Jeremiah Freeman, head of the chemistry department, "a large majority of retired faculty occupy and continue to use exactly the same offices assigned to them when they were active members of the faculty." Also, the pattern of moving retired faculty out of their offices or to other offices has been "atypical of the chemistry department." Final­ly, he refuses to ''quickly fade from the scene." He has "every intention of continuing" his re­search already begun in his lab. 
On August 12, according to Danehy, Freeman told him he was to exchange offices with Conrad Kowalski, assistant professor of chemistry. Kowalski's present office does not have an adjoining lab, and Danehy was not assigned a lab to continue his research. He assumed he would have to work in a larger laboratory used by stu­dents, which, he noted, would be ''unprofesssional treatment for someone who has been on the faculty for 26 years." 
No action had been taken by the chemistry department to move Danehy from his office until last week. Danehy said he entered his office Monday morning and found "half of the floor space taken up by empty carton boxes." Last Thurs­day his attorney met with the University's lawyer, according to Danehy, and asked him to have the boxes removed. That night, Dane­by said, the boxes were gone.

Lenahan lecture compares 19th to 20th century writers 
by Ellen Buddy 
Nineteenth Century American Literature was the topic of last 
night's  American  Scene  Lecture  
Series.  Professor William Lenahan  
of  the  University  of  Wisconsin  

presented the lecture. comparing such nineteenth authors as Twain, Crane and Kate Chopan to the modern authors, Hemmingway, Fitzgerald and Faulkner. 
Lenahan stressed the control of tone. "the author's ability to control the reader's attitude toward the material". The nineteenth century authors lead the way in tone control through their succes­ses and failures. he said. 
Lenahan focused directly upon the new ideas of the nature of man at the turn of the century and commented that the twentieth cen­tury authors had a hard time following in the footsteps of their contemporaries because they could not accept these new concepts of the nature of man. 
As twentieth century literature progressed, the authors lost sight of the theme in literature and tended toward the technique, losing the effect of the literary

Carter signs new housing bill 
-----------=---------~-­
WASHINGTON (AP]  The Cart­er administration's first new urban program was signed into law yesterday promising billions for ravaged American cities and their poor and out of work residents. 
The $14.7 billion housing bill includes an expansion of the Com­munity Development program, with an emphasis on older cities, as well as more money for housing pro~rams and rent subsidies for poor families. 
The rent subsidies plus added financial !lid to hard-pressed cities will help an additional 345,000 families find housing at rents they can afford, according to the Depart­ment of Housing and Urban Devel­opment. 
At the same time, administrati.on officials estimate the measure will provide a half million jobs in construction and related industries where unemployment rates are the highest. 
On the heels of his eye-opening tour last week of the South Bronx, President Carter said as he signed the legislation that it will provide "a giant step forward" in improv­ing urban living conditions. 
"The bill is a big improvement in giving more attention to the older, central cities," says Richard

Nathan, urban expert at the Brook­ings Institution. "It will help a lot of big Northern cities, but also the inner ring suburbs and more than a few Sunbelt cities." 
New elements in the community development program include a $400 million Urban Action Grant fund for spurring economic devel­opment in the nation's most trou­bled cities. The bill includes a formula that drastically increases federal aid to cities in the Northeast and the Midwest but also provides a trickle more money for growing cities of the South and West. 
Carter said his visit to the South Bronx revealed slums that are "a disgrace to our great country." 

In fact ghetto-marked cities like New York, Detroit and Baltimore will receive millions of dollars more under the Carter housing bill than 
they  were  to  receive  under  the  
'expiring legislation.  
The  housing  and  community  

development bill, product of a two-month conference between the House and Senate, extends the community development program for revitalizing cities for three years and funds it with a total of $10.9 billion, a $2.4 billion increase. 
Included in the housing bill is $1.2 billion in rent subsidies for low-income families, as well as a variety of subsidies for homeown­ers and the housing industry.

A Thought for Founder's Day 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiCathy hedge s 
Ifone walks around campus at any given time and eavesdrops on the daily conversations of the passing students, one will inevitably hear all sorts of complaints floating around, i.e. the food is terrible, I hate studying, the social life is lacking, I hate parietals. We think the rules are strict now, but if our founders, Fr. Sorin and the Holy Cross Nuns, could pay a visit to St. Mary's today, they would probably die of shock ... 
Let's go back to 1903, when the school catalogue described the primary aim of St. Mary's as the training of "the heart as well as the mind, to form women who will grace society ... and honor and edify it with their virtues.'' Our parietals may be limiting today, but the girls in 1903 were not allowed visitors at all on the grounds the "frequent and protracted visits are highly detrimental to the
~. .. . 
improvement of the pupils.'' The girls wore a uniform dress of navy wool, and "the uniforms must be made without silk linings or silk trimmings." The use of jewelry was prohibited. Pupils were alloted three-four hours per week for letter writing, but they could not write to anyone their parents had not approved. Under "Eatables" in the catalogue; "hence, consideration of health compel us to say that confectionary, or other eatables sent or brought to pupils will not be delivered." Tuition was about $300.00 per year, but the girls had to bring their own table utensils, of course. The curriculum of the Collegiate Course included Church Doctrine, Church History, Latin, Greek, Philosophy, literature, and Music courses.

CILA provides service programs 
by Sam Fink 

One of the most expansive 
. community service programs at Notre Dame is executed by CILA: the Council for International Lay Apostlate. With a membership of nearly 200 students and faculty members, CILA has as its main concerns summer projects in rural and urban areas and local com­munity services for the South Bend area, according to Mark Heberlein, head of CILA's Community Service Branch. 
Chess games scheduled for Friday nights 
The Notre Dame Chess Club has announced that each Friday even­ing, beginning tomorrow, Room 325 of the Computing Center and Mathematics Building will be open 
at  7 p.m.  for chess games.  All  
students  interested  in  chess  are  
invited to attend.  

There are six principal organiza­tions for which the group provides volunteers at this time, Heberlein noted. The focus of these agencies are the elimination of major social ills affecting our modern society. 
At the head of the list is CILA's newest undertaking: the Elderly Discount Program, Heberlein said. This project was initiated by CILA, he explained, following the re­commendation of member Tony Bruno, who noted that similiar programs had proved successful in large urban centers such as Mil­waukee, WI. 
This service, in the planning stage, will provide Souh Bend residents, age 65 and over, dis­counts of ten to fifteen percent at local retail stores. "The greate;;t income relief will be in the costs of groceries and pharmacueticals," Heberlein believes. Members are contacting nearby businesses, do­ing community research to evaluate the desire of senior citizens for such an agency, and distributing program cards to eligible indivi­duals. 
EARN OVER $600 AMONTH FOR THE REST OF YOUR SENIORYEAR. Ifyou are interested in math, physics or engineering, the Navy has a program you should know about. It's called the NUPOC-Collegiate Program (NUPOC is short for Nuclear Propulsion Officer Candidate), and if you qualify it can pay you as much as $611 a month for the remainder ofyour senior year. Then after 16 weeks of Officer Candidate School, you will receive an additional year ofadvanced technical education, education that would cost thousands in a civilian school, but in the Navy we pay you. And at the end ofthe year oftraining, you'll receive a $3,000 cash bonus. It isn't easy. Only one ofevery six applicants will be selected, and there are fewer than 300 openings. But those who make it find themselves in one ofthe most elite engineering training programs anywhere. With unequalled hands-on responsibility, a $24,000 salary in four years, plus travel, medical benefits and education opportunities. For more details on this program, ask your placement officer when a Navy representative will be on campus, or call the Officer Program Office listed below; or send your r~sume to Navy Nuclear Officer Program, Code 312, 4015 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Va. 22203. The NUPOC-Collegiate Program. It can do more than help you finish college; it can lead to an exciting opportunity.

NAVY OFFICER. ITS NOTJUSTAJOB, IT'S AN ADVENTURE. 
CILA hopes that the system will be fully operable at the pnset of the second semester, Heb~rlein said Since Research Servi~es Inc., a.,. other local firm, failed at a similiar task, the project will be an uphtil battle, he explained. Nevertheless, "CILA is optimistic about the chance for success and hopes to enlarge the plans substantially enough for the city of South Bend to take over the project." 
Among other local interests, Heberlein stated that CILA volun­teers work at Portage Manor, a St. Joseph county nursing home for the elderly and disabled. The imput here is in recreational activi­ties. 
At the Northeast Neighborhood 
Center, located five blocks froJn campus, the group is involved~in both urban renewal and neighb r­hood organization, he stated Some ofthe problems faced incl <e preventing high school trua~' ', alleviating illiteracy by teach,iLg English to non-English speakh ;;; people, and fighting malnutrition among the elderly, he explained. 
CILA members also arrange field trips, recreation, and Big Brother and Big Sister programs at Misha­waka's Family and Children Cen­ter. They are involved with children, 9 to 18 years old, who come from disrupted families. 
Another recent undertaking of 
CILA workers, according to Heber­
lein, is participation in Birth Right, 
and agency which aids pregnant 
women with special attention 
directed towards unwed expectant 
mothers. The group offers coun­
selling and referral aids to the 
women, he said. CILA volunteers 
administer pregnancy tests, per­
form clerical work, and assist in 
counselling. 
Corvilla House, a home for the 
physically and mentally handicap­
ped of all ages, is yet another 
activity in which members offer 
their help. The main type of work 
here, Heberlein noted, is in the 
range of household chores and 
recreational activities. Members ­
deal directly with the 17 residents, 
age 6 to SO years, who are both 
educably and ineducably retarded. 
CILA programs are scheduled, 
Heberlein explained, so that the

Courtis receives award 
by Cathy Murray 

Sandy Courtis, a St. Mary's senior, was recently awarded a $500 cash prize and a gold medal­lion accounting award as an out­standing business major with an acounting concentration by the Ernst and Ernst Accounting firm. This is the second year that such an award has been presented at St. Mary's. 
Ernst and Ernst ranks among the nation's major accounting firms and every year this award is given at a number of schools with accounting programs to encourage outstanding students to seek careers in public accounting. 
In order to receive this award, business majors with an accounting concentration may apply during tl.eir junior year of studies. The winner is announced during the spring semester of that year, and the award presented during the fall semester of senior year. 
The criteria considered in the presentation of this award include: scholarship, leadership, Clttzen­ship, character and extra-curricular activities. 
A resident of LeMans Hall. Courtis currentlv has an internship at the Bendix C~rp. in South Bend. She is the social commissioner of LeMans Hall and is active in the business club. Upon graduation Courtis hopes to work as an accountant for a major firm. 
The formal awards ceremony was held in the office of St. Mary's President John Duggan on Oct. 4. Also present at the ceremony were Bill Schmuhl. chairman of the business department and Richard Zona. manager of the South Bend office of Ernst and Ernst. 
Banker approves pumpkin loan 

BELLEVUE* WASH. (AP] -Bank Manager Wally Adam<; sat the 35 third-graders around his confer­ence table and told them yes, he would approve their $100 loan so they could go into the pumpkin business. 
But th~y have to repay it by Nov. 1 -with a 82 cents interest. With Adams' go-ahead, Lois Rich­ards, loan officer at the Bellevue branch of the Seattle First National Bank, processed the application yesterday. It didn't matter that none of the applicants could say how much they plan to pay for the pumpkins or how much they'll charge when they sell them to their classmates at St. Louise School. 
As head of the class foray into high finance, pupil Jason Mattingly signed on the dotted line. So did teacher Sheri Andrews, to make it legal. 
Pupil Siobain Guicon said he knew the class had done a lot better at the bank than it would have accepting a loan offer from a St. Louise teacher. 
"She said we had to pay $50 rent." he said. ''And we had to pay it back by Saturday," added another pupiI. 
What will happen if the money isn't there when the loan comes due? 
"We'll just write a check," one youngster said. If we only make like $80, we'd have to, uh, babysit.'' said Michael Osterhought. 
"Ifyou can't po:: it back, they take things you have,'' worrried another little fellow. "Your house, your car, your bike... " 
One little girl said the venture looked like a sure thing "on account of Halloween." 
Banker Adams didn't seem wor­ried about the possibility of a default. He said it was often good financial practice to borrow money to pay for an inventory. 
"We plan to discuss that," the teacher said. "We're going to talk about the idea of using money frivolously. This is just the first of the unit."

Dark Horses: Toronto: Under new coach Roger Neilson, the Leafs may find the formula to help jell their nucleus of young talent. The Leafs possess an erratic but talented array of scorers (Sittler, McDonald, Williams( and solid defensemen (Salming, Turnbull(. Mike Palmateer, a rookie sensation last year, is a future superstar in the nets. This team could make a move on Boston or Buffalo. Buffalo: Marcel Pronovost is the new coach, inheriting a squad that has been beaten by the defense-minded Islanders two years straight. Despite the lP.ague's most explosive offense, this team will never win with Gerry Desjardins in goal. Los Angeles: Rogatien Vachon is the most underrated goalie in the league, and Marcel Dionne is a dynamic scorer. With those two players, any team could go far, but new coach Ron Steward proved in his first stint with the Rangers that he's not a NHL coach. Other Playoff Teams: Pittsburgh: The perfect example of this team is right wing Wayne Bianchin, who had 28 goals and 6 assists last year. They don't understand defense. Minnesota: ND alumnus Alex Pirus was one of four North Star rookies to score 20 goals last year. But despite a good offense, their defense is poor, and that prevents them from being serious contenders. St. Louis: They qualify out of default (Smythe Division). Before making any advances, the Blues must get rid of Emile Francis. Chicago: They also qualify out of default (Smythe Division). Their only positive point is Tony Exposito, one of the league's most persecuted goalies. 
N.Y. Rangers: This team only missed the playoffs by Mpoints last year. With the addition of goalie Wayne Thomas· and defensemen Don Awrey, and the development of younger players such as John Bednarski, Pat Hickey and Mike McEwen, the Rangers seem a good bet to overtake Atlanta. 
The Others: Atlanta: It's hard to imagine that a team with goalies such as Dan Bouchard and Phil Myre won't make the playoffs. Credit it to the toughest division in the league. Washington: The Caps actually showed signs of moving towards respectability last year. They stiii need someone who can score. 
Detroit: Although Ed Giacomin is their goalie, they are the worst team in the league. Vancouver: A team with some talent, but no front office knowledge. Colorado: Still the best name in the league, but no longer the worst team. They actually have a star in Wilf Paiement, only 22 but beginning his fourth year in the league. aeveland: Judging by their attendance figures, it's obvious no one cares.

Hooton's five-hit pitching for a 6-1 victory over the New York Yankees in Wednesday night's second game of the 1977 World Series. The Dodger victory, constructed aroung the home runs and Hoo­ton's baffling knuckle-curve, tied the best-of-seven series at 1-1 with the next three games scheduled for Los Angeles beginning Friday night.

Dodgers and kayoed in just "2 ~~d 113 innings. By the time Manager Billy Martin came out to get him, the Dodgers had all the runs they would need on this cool, crisp night. 
Steve Garvey climaxed the home run onslaught with a solo shot in the ninth off Yankees relief ace Sparky Lyle. 
Martin, operating with a some­what slim supply of healthy pitch­ers, had taken· a calculated risk starting Hunter, who had been sidelined since Sept. 10 with a urological disosrder. It became obvious early that this was one gamble the Yankee's manager was going to lose. 
In the first inning, Hunter retired the first two batters he faced but then surrendered a ringing double to right center field by Smith. The Yankees right-hander got ahead of Cey with two quick striked, but the Dodgers third baseman deposited the next pitch well beyond the left field fence, just to the right of the 387-foot sign. 
An inning later, Hunter again retired the first two Dodger bat­ters, bringing up Yeager. Again, Hunter was one strike away from the out, and again, the batter won the showdown. Yeager's shot landed in virtually the same spot Cey's had in the first inning, well beyond the left field fence. 
In the third, Bill Russell laced a one-out, first-pitch single to right field, bringing up Smith. The count went to 2-2 and the Dodger's outfielder sent a tape-measure shot halfway up the bleachers beyond right center. 
As Smith circled the bases, Hunter stood on the mound, his head bowed, perhaps a remebering better World Series moments. He took a 4-1 career Series record into Wednesday night's game. But the Dodger bats were not impressed. 
Martin came out to get Hunter before more damage could be done. The power display was a

Coxswain views Irish crew strategy 

The Notre Dame crew is composed of dedicated athletes including Bill MacKay, who is more than determined to excel in his position as coxswain, regardless of handicaps. 
by Laura Larimore Sports Writer 

A unique member of the Notre 
Dame crew is Bill MacKay. 

Unique. for he is ordinarily con­
fined to a wheelchair, a result of an 
accident several years ago. Getting 
around campus has been made 
easier by University officials with 
the addition of ramps at most 
buildings. However, they never 
made any provisions for rowing a 
boat in the heat of a race. 

Actually MacKay is well suited for his position in the crew, as he serves as the coxswain, the director of the crew or the "skipper." He is the only one who can see in the direction the boat is traveling. 
A coxswain sits at the rear of a shell, or boat, which seats either four or eight men. He is the navigator, strategist, and on-the­spot coach during the race. He is responsible for keeping the rowers together and keeping harmony in the crew. Confidence must be displayed by the coxswain· to inspire confidence in the crew. 
If he seems uncertain of his strategy, the oarsmen react accord­ingly. Orders have to be given loud and clear in an authoritative man­ner, yet without being bossy. Corrections have to be made during a race that lasts only a matter of minutes; there is no time for argument or resentment. 
To insure everyone hearing the coxswain's commands down at the end of the 65-foot-long boat, only he and the last man at the front end are allowed to speak. Instan­taneous decisions are required of the coxswain; the shell has to remain in its own lane, and not hit other boats; power strokes of the race have to be verbally counted, 
SMC, Irish place in tourney 
by Laurie Reising Women's Sports Editor 

The Notre Dame and St. Mary's tennis team placed well in the Indiana Small College Tennis Tour­nament held last weekend. Amond the 16 schools competing, St. Mary's finished in second p1ace with 19 points, behind the winner, Valparaiso University. Notre Dame, with 9 points came in at fourth. 
St. Mary's coach Cathy Cordes said she was "just elated" over her squad's performance, "Especially considering the level of competition we were up against." "We seeded 1'.11 six of our players, which is an honor in itself." cited Cordes. 
Freshmen, Cindy Shuster was singled out by her coach as showing exceptional determination during the week's competition. "Cindy has been consistently strong for us during the whole season and I thought she did an admirable job again," Cordes praised. Shuster took top honors in the third singles action putting down players from Franklin, But­ler, Earlham and DePauw.

NHL Preview 
I 
Montreal? I 

Clarence Campbell is finally gone, the WHA is still trying to survive after being back-stabbed by Harold Ballard of the Maple Leafs, and the Colorado Rockies are preparing for another season in Denver. But, one thing always remains the same in the National Hockey League--the Montreal Canadians. As the league opens its 60th season tonight, the term "competitive balance" is being threatened by the impending dynasty of the Canadians. On the eve of the league opener, there doesn't ~eem to be any change in the league structure, and only one team seems to have a legitimate shot at dethroning the Habs. The top four: Montreal: Without a doubt, the greatest collection of talent in modern NHL history. Winning 24 of 27 playoff games in the last two years is the best barometer of this team's phenomenal talent. And there's no reason

to think that it won't continue. Ken Dryden is only 30 and the marvelous defense trio of Larry Robinson, Guy LaPointe and Serge Savard still have years left. If ever they should break up a hockey team, this is the one. 
N. Y.lslanders: The team with the best shot at winning the Cup other than 
the Canadians. They came closer than reople realize to beating the Habs · [continued on page 9] 
Teammate Noreen Bracken, competing in the fourth singles division looked as if she too might go all the way but fell in the finals to the eventual Valpo winner. Bracken won the first set 6-4 but dropped the second in a tie-breaker 6-7. She then was defeated in her third set 1-6 due to what her coach called a "mental letdown." "After all we had gone through to get that fflr, that second set was just too much." Cordes explained. 
The coaches at the tournament voted not to seed the doubles teams and Cordes felt this proved to be a detriment to her team's chances. "By choosing not to seed, this had our number one doubles team of Purcell and Timm running up against the Valpo combination in only the second round." Cordes said. · 
"Meeting this early was bad for us and told everyone who was going to win very early in the matches." Timm and Purcell, who had placed second in last year's competition, were halted early in their attempt to repeat history, losing in two close sets 4-6,6-7. 
Finishing in second place qual­necessitiating a good judge of distance. 
"After all," Bill said, "who wants to call the last thirty and still have ten yards to go to the finish?" As the signal caller of the shell, the coxswain often gets the credit for a victory or blame for a defeat much as a quarterback answers for the football team. 
MacKay first joined crew last spring as a freshman. A fellow classmate, Jim Martin, now vice­president of the crew, invited him to join. He thought MacKay had just the right temperment for a coxswain. After he decided to join, one of the first fears the team had for their new member was what would happen should the boat somehow overturn, MacKay re­called laughingly. Actually, he is a strong swimmer. 

Bill had no previous exposure to crew unless you consider the fact that the Michigan State Crew practices across the street from his house in Lansing, Michigan. He has never seen the annual race held there but is looking forward to participating in it this year. 
At Lansing Catholic Central 
ifies St. Mary's team to go to the Regionals which are to be held during the spring in Chicago. It is the first time for such an honor and coach Cordes says she is "thrilled and looking forward to competing in them." 
Notre Dame, finishing in fourth place, had four of their players gaining a seed in the tournament with two of the girts· making their 
·way down to the semifinal action. 
Junior Diane. Shillingburg, seeded 
third in the fourth singles com­
petition, battles her way to the 
semis only to lose to the eventual 
champion from Valpo, 0-6,7-6,2-6. 
Teammate Mary Shukis came close to taking it all in first singles by defeating players from Butler and Taylor, but fell to Hanover's player 2-6,3-6. Coach Petro had nothing but praise for her seasoned players when she said "Both Diane and Mary had a great day and put forth a real effort." 
Petro was "very impressed" with the play of her third singles player, Jean Barton. Seeded fourth, Barton defeated Hanover's player 6-1,6-1 but lost in a tie­breaker to her opponent from Earlham College, 3-6,6-1,6-7. 
The Irish doubles teams did not fair quite as well Saturday morn­ing, capturing only one point. Shillingburg and Barton combined forces to put down the duo from Taylor 6-3,6-2 but were defeated by DePauw 1-6, 1-6. 
Both Notre Dame and St. Mary's will complete their seasons this weekend in the Notre Dame-St.

travel in the same bus. The only difference is that they race against the other female crews. Both have their own coaches, who are usually experienced ex-crew mem­bers who decide to coach what would usually be their last year in competition. 
The team should do well this year, according to MacKay. They have experience, a "never say die" attitude, and they are well pre­pared. Last year the four-man shell crew was ranked fourth in the nation. The first real test for the crew this fall will be at the prestigious "Head of the Charles" race in Boston Oct. 23, featuring the Ivy League schools and MIT. It is also one of the longest races, a three mile test of endurance. 
Perhaps the greatest enjoyment for MacKay in being in the crew is the thrill of the race. As those who have raced know, nothing can compare with the intense concen­tration and excitement that comes in the short time of a race. There is no time to come back and correct your errors; each moment counts. 
Little mistakes often spell dis­aster. Each person in the crew continually works to improve his technique for those few minutes of

The New York area--a home away from home for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Subway alumni, a sellout crowd and the demanding New York press corps await the Irish as they make their first appearance in the area since the 1973 meeting with Army at West Point. 
Back in that championship season of 1973 the Irish trounced the Cadets 62-3 and then followed that victory with a 23-14 win over Southern Cal the f<l)lowing week in South Bend. The stage is similar this fall as the Irish will battle the Black Knights of the Hudson before a capacity crowd at the New Jersy Meadowlands Sports Complex. 
Dan Devine and his charges must gear up after a week off and the opportunity to ponder the less than artistic victory over Michigan State. Although the Irish had their best offensive showing to date against the Spartans they squandered several scoring opportunities with fumbles and penalties. The Irish will need to get back on the track and avoid the mistakes in fundamentals if they are to try to repeat the script of the 1973 season over the course of the next two weekends. 
Army has a veteran and talented team, especially on the offense, and can present a problem for the Irish. The old adage of "playing them one at a time" easily applies to this week's game and 78,000-plus at the Meadowlands and the local television audience here in South Bend will be watching to see if the Irish are indeed "looking ahead." 
When Army has the ball: The Cadets offense is a mirror-image of Purdue's-all the way down to the black and gold uniforms. Leamon Hall is the Cadets' version of Mark Herrmann and the 6-5, 220-pound senior currently ranks sixth in the nation in passing and seventh in total offense. Hall owns every record that a passer would want to own in the Army record books and is currently hitting on S81/2 of his passes totally 1, 115 yards and 12 touchdowns. 
Clennie Brundidge, a 6-4, 218 pound tight end is Hall's primary target as the junior is ranked second in the nation in receiving with six catches per contest. Brundidge, who also letters in basketball at the Point, is averaging 16 yards per reception and needs but 53 yards to establish a new career standard for the Army record book. 
On the ground the Black Knights are averaging 3.2 yards per attempt on their 39 rushes per game. Halfback Greg King leads the way for the ground troops with 333 yards on 66 carries. 
Defensively the burden will again fall to the pass rush. The front four has accounted for 17 tackles-for-loss thus far amounting to minus 169 yards. Ross Browner seems to be coming into form and now has five tackles-for-loss totaling minus-SO yards. The remaining pressure will fall to sophomore linebackers Mike Whittington and Leroy Leopold who will
