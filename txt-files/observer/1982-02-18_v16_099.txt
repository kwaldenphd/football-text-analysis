Lee Strasberg,who taught "method acting" to a genera-· tion of stars such as Marlon Brando, James Dean and Marilyn Monroe, died yesterday ofa heart attack. He was 80. The graduates of Strasberg's Actors Studio comprise a virtual Who's Who ofAmerican acting: Robert De Niro, Paul Newman, Al Pacino, Jane Fonda and Sally Field, to name afew more. In 1974, the master teacher made his movie debut, and won an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of an aging underworld boss in "Godfather II." Such recognition also followed his pupils -organizers ofan Actors Studio party in 1980 figured Strasberg's students had won or been nominated for 128 Oscars, Tonys and Emmys. Strasberg was stricken at his apartment on Central Park West at 6:30 a.m.-and rushed to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital, where doctors tried to revive him until 7:56a.m., saidJohn Springer, publicist for Strasberg and the studio. He will be memorialized at the Shubert Theater at 11 a.m. Thursday, Springer said. Burial will be at Westchester Hills Cemetery. -AP 
"Have gun, will travel"'says ex-copJoseph Wam­baugh, whose films and novels about police work have helped put him in the running for police chiefof Houston, a job he never even applied for. The author of "The Blue Knight," "The Onion Field," "The Choirboys" and "The New Centurions," says he will en­thusiastically accept if chosen from a field of 11 current or former law enforcement officers being considered for· the job by Mayor Kathy Whitmire. Seven of the candidates applied for the job. The others were recommended by various people. The mayor's office would not say who recommended Wambaugh, a 14-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department. Wambaugh eventually became a detective sergeant. -AP 
The owner of New York's famed Sardi's res­
taurant waded into icy Central Park lake to rescue a woman who nearly drowned trying to save two brothers who had fallen through thin ice. Vincent Sardi, 66, was bicycling in his business suit when he saw Barbara Varnhagen flailing about iri the water. Sardi found some rope and waded into the water. "I kept flipping the rope to her," he said. After pulling her out, he rode on to Manhattan's theater district, where he downed a few brandies at his restaurant to warm up.· Enzo DiBello, 13, and his 9-year-old brother Victor had been pulled to safety by two young men. But in the confusion, nobody noticed whether the woman who had tried to save them ever made it to 
shore herself Police in diving suits and in boats searched ~he lake for four hours before it was learned that Miss Varnhagen had already been saved. -AP 
The 15-year-old daughterofa Michigan official probably will be placed in state care after she admitted respon­sibility to arson in the fire death ofher father, a Michigan prosecutor said. Nancy VanNote was charged with arson and manslaughter in the death ofher father, Stephen VanNote, 49, in a Dec. 30 fire at their lansing home. However, assistant Ingham County Prosecutor Kim Eddie said the manslaughter charge was dismissed following her ap-~ pearance Tuesday in Ingham County Probate Court. She admitted responsibility for arson, and as a result will be placed in the state's custody as a juvenile. The girl apparently had not intended to kill her father, Eddie said. "She admitted setting the fire," he said. "We believe she was frustrated and apparently was trying to get atten­tion." -AP 
William T."Billy the Kid" Kidd of Indianapolis 
was held in the Marion CountyJail yesterday after police said he kept four people at gunpoint and took a fifth person hostage following a discount store holdup. He was held in lieu of S6I,000 bond pending a Municipal Court hearing Wednesday afternoon. Kidd, 22, was released from prison recently after serving two years of a five-year sentence for robbery. Charges of confinement and robbery were pending. No one was injured in the incident. Ironically, Kidd was captured at a house next to the one ~is hostage ran to for help after being released, authorities said. The 35-minute incident began about 
2:30 p.m. Tuesday in a K-Mart on the city's far east side when security personnel confronted Kidd, accusing him of shoplifting. During questioning they allowed Kidd to go to a restroom. When he emerged, he had a .38-caliber revolver, a store spokesman sai~, and ran 50 yards aoss the parking lot to the Accent East Inn, a motel. There he waved the pistol at four people in the lobby, ordering them to wait by the front desk, police said. -AP 
Federal officialspicked through a swath ofdebris in a muddy cow pasture yesterday, investigating a plane crash that killed six members of a lebanon, Ky., family, their Hoosier pilot and an employee of the family business. The investigators, two from the Federal Aviation Administration and one from the National Transportation Board, said it probably would take until today to comb the debris. They said it might be three months before they had a report. The eight-passenger, twin-engine turboprop crashed on Cecil Moraja's farm Tuesday night while trying to land at the Lebanon-Springfield Airport in heavy fog, officials said. The plane went down about five miles north oflebanon, about a mile from the airport. The dead were identified as David Ball, 38, ofLebanon, presi­dent ofB&T energy Corp. in Louisville and owner ofa local gasoline and oil distributorship; his wife, Alice, 34; their children, Chad, 5, and Lance, 22 months, Mrs. Ball's parents, Owen Isaacs, 62, of Lebanon, and his wife, Louise, 61; John Robert Watts ofLouisville, an engineer for B&T Energy; and the pilot, Doug Baker, 31, ofCharles­town, Ind. -AP

Good news and bad news 
Last week there were more than a few complaints 
voiced about apathy in the Notre Dame student body 
dections. Voter turnout percentages for both the initial 
dection and the subsequent runoff dipped down into 
the forties. Ifyou thought that was pretty sad, you ain't 
heard nothin' yet. 
Consider today's student body elections at Saint 
Mary's College. The election is not simply "boring" or 
"irrelevant," as some described last week's SBP cam­
paign, it is an example of a downright sickening new 
low in s~udent apathy on campus. Why? There is a situa­
tion that reminds me ofsome otherfateful electionslike 
Nyguen Van Theiu's campaign for President of South 
Vietnam in the early 70's, or the rubber-stamp 
"elections" held in communist-bloc countries. Only 
one ticket is running. 
The only candidates are Kathleen Murphy for Student 
Body President, Elaine Hocker for Vice President for 
Student Affairs, and Beth Tighe for Vice President for 
Academic Affairs. I am not in any way attacking these 
candidates; they are to be commended for having the 
guts to stand up and get involved enough to have their. 
names on the ballot. But what happened to the rest of 
tlile student body? 
Apathy among the ranks of voters is -a sad enough commentary on the pathetic condition of student politi­cal attitudes on campus, but tlilings really scrape the bot­tom ofthe barrel when a stu­..Qlent body the size of Saint  Mary's cannot come up with more than one candidate for three ofthe top positions-on campus. 
The problem runs deeper 
tlilan just a suggestion of a _lack of student concern: it also sends a message to the administration. How can we continue to point an accus­ing finger at the ad­ministrators of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's for not 
giving a damn about student life when it becomes more 
apparent with every instance ofone-ticket candidacies 
~nd low voter turnouts ihat mayt:: the students really 
do not give a damn themselves any more about what 
happens? 
Well, I guess things could be worse-d~ere could be 
no candidates for office. Let's hope we never take that 
next step down the ladder ofapathy. 
For a change of pace, consider for a moment a 
campus institution that is working: the Notre Dame 
Placement Bureau. That busy but cramped office on the 
second floor of the Administration Building has been 
like a second home to me and thousands of other 
seniors over the years. The Class of 1982 was the first, 
however, to go through the rigors of job interviewing 
under a new computerized interview-scheduling sys­
t,em. 
Many would-be young executives had mixed feelings 
1ast fall when the new system was announced. On the 
one hand, there were those who breathed a collective 
sigh of relief, hoping that the computerized system would eliminate the need for camping out in the LaFortune Student Center the night before sign-ups for interviews. On the other hand, however, there were the hard-core capitalists who feared that they would lose their competitive edge in securing interviews to those who were just a bit less willing to spend a night on the floor ofthe LaFortune basement. 


A semester and a half of scheduling and hundreds of interviews later, the system has earned itself generally good marks for its performance. Despite an occasional interview not granted, or a mistaken name placed on the "blacklist" for having alleg~dly missed an interview, the entire setup has worked amazingly well. Those who desperately want to interview with a firm have the op­tion of utilizing one of the two priority interview re­
. quests allotted to students each semester. Most stu­dents have found that the Placement Bureau has managed to honor these re­quests; and even in the-event that someone did not make the schedule, the staff has been helpful in providing in­formation and assistance to students' willing to inter­view during breaks in the in­terviewer's schedule or at his/her room at the Morris Inn. The new system has also provided for a more 
v democratic way of ass~guing interv-i.ews -to students in aU colleges -not just.the busi­
ness and engineering 
"throats" who . traditionally get most caught up_in the job 
The big complaint about the Placement Bureau, however, continues to pe its cramped quarters. The staff is doing an excellent job considering the facilities, but any studen~ who has tried to cram into the office and sign up for an interview on Monday or Tuesday at lunchtime, or who has had an interview in a voting booth in the LaFortune Ballroom, knows the Placement Bure:_~.u needs more space. 
'There may be some changes in that situation in the near future. Some rumors have it that the WNDU build­ing, soon to be vacated, will be offered to the placement bureau. The sources"certainly are not authoritative, and no decision has been made public yet on the future use , ofthe building, but there may be some hope in the fact that the idea is being discussed. The Placement Bureau is doing a good job and deserves a public commenda­tion, but it also deserves more space for the future.

Arrests, fines 
Polish police continue 'sweep' 
WARSAW, Poland (AP)-Police detained 3,SOO people and fined an­other 7,000 for martial law viola­tions, the official PAP news agency said yestt;rday in reporting the big­gest dragnet since military rule was 
imposed in Poland.  
In  addition,  PAP  said  145,000  
people  were  warned,  29,000  
lectured,  and  4,000  sent  to  mis­ 

demeanor courts, and that 614 people still fdce police courts for martial law violations uncovered during the recent two-day sweep called "Operation Calm." 
PAP said 25,000 regular and volunteer policemen checked 5 I ,000 shops, 60,000 vehicles and 3500 hideouts for "criminal ele­ments," adding, "It can be stated on the basis of reports of police patrols that the state of obedience to exist· ing regulations of martial law is not the best." 
Radio Warsaw, monitored in Lon­don, said the raids were "carried out throughout Poland" and that many were conducted at night. It did not give the exact dates of the sweep, and it was unclear how many of those detained were still in custody. 
Before the latest action, authori­ties had repor~ed 4,000 people in detention since martial law was imposed Dec. 13, the independent union Solidarity suspended, and its leader Lech Walesa detained near Warsaw. 
The latest report indicated that all or some restrictions of martial law such as a ban on inter-city travel without permission, or a ban on pos­session of passports, may not be lifted as promised by the authorities last month. 
Gen. Wojciech jaruzelski, the martial law chief, along with other officials, have said most if nQt. all martial law restrictions may be lifted by the end of February if the situa­
tion remains calm.  
Meanwhile,  Deputy  Planning  
Commission  Chairman  Stanislaw  
Dlugosz  criticized  U.S.  sanctions  

against the martial law government. "It's apparent that the United 
States counts on the complete 
breakdown of our economy, 
followed by social dissatisfaction," 
he told PAP. 
Dlugosz said U.S. sanctions 
depriwd Polt:s of 170 tons of fish 
from American waters, and crippled 
the chicken breeding and producing 
industry which was dependent· on 
U.S. feed credits to purchase im­ported corn and soybeans. The at­tack coincided with new setbacks in the economy. PAP reported that Polish industrial production declined I7.S percent from Decem­ber toJanuary. 
The statistical office, however, reported an 8.8 percent hike in coal production, putting January output this year at I S.4 million tons ­above planned levels. 
Coal is Poland's must important hard currency earner, and the report of increased production may be seen favorably by Western bankers considering possible rescheduling of Poland's estimated $26. S billion debt to the West. 
Budget revision 

·Stockmru;ttestifies before Congress 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Besieged three-year tax cut. with criticism and apJlcals for com; But later, Stockman appeared to promise, the administration signaled back off somewhat on those two Congress Wednesday that there may issues. He told the panel that Reagan be some leeway in President feels,the tax code "isn't chiseled in Reagan's refusal to raise taxes or cut stone." With that, he pointed specifi­the IH percent Pentagon buildup in f, cally to the billions of dollars in tax

A key · Democrat called the development "progress.-progress and hope" for a bipartisan revision of the embattled 5757.6-billon plan. 
At, first, the. oliv!! branch offered Ilouse Democrats by Budget Direc­tor David Stockman seemed rdati.vcly barren, even as he told the Bud)>:et Committee that the everall p:tckagt·· was not "the last word, the tln:tl solUtion." At that point, he reiterated, Reagan's insistence that the defense program be left intact· and that there bc: no reversal of his

the Pentagon. Stockman did not reject the idea outright; instead he said "there may be room for savings which we haven't found or that you may want to propose." 
Aspin said that while deeper cuts might be "devastating" to the defense budget, $8 billion to S I 0 bil­lion could be trimmed "without damaging national security severc­ly."Stockman did not dispute him. 
Rep. james Jones, D-Okla., the committee chairman, called Stbck­man's statements "progress progress and hope. I thought his tes­timony by Itself did give running room ·to allow a compromise tQ emerge.... " 
With Stockman in the witness chair, one Democrat after another had assailed Reagan for what House Majority LeaderJim Wright ofTexas called a non-ending cycle of "high interest rates, high UQ.employment rates, high deficits." 
But Wright and }lthers a!so ap­pealed for compromise. 
The budge_t direct9r said he was looking forward to suggestions from Congress "where genuine savings arc possible that we have not found." 
At the same time, Stockman told 
the committee that Reagan's

UAW board approves concessions 

CHICAGO (AP) -The United Auto Workers' 225-member Ford Council voted overwhelmingly yes­terday to approve a tentative con· tract that would help save the automaker up to $1 billion, a local union president said. 
Only about 12 delegates dis· sented during-the standing vote, said Michael Whyte, president of Local I 324 in Ontario, Canada. 
The vote;: came at the end of a more than three-hour meeting by the council, made up of local union leaders from around the nation, and set the stage for the union's rank· and-file members to vote on the pact. 
Dissident UAW members had held a news conference before the coun· cil meeting to say they opposed uni· on President Douglas A. Fraser's proposal to approve the pact with Ford Motor Co. 
"The proposal is ludicrous," said AI Gardner, president of UAW Local 600, from a tool-and-die plant in Dearborn, Mich. "It gives the cor· poration a billion dollars and doesn't change anything. It won't save jobs and it won't lower car prices to help the consumer." 
Rank-and-file voting will take about two weeks, officials said. If ap·

proved by members, the contract could take effect at once. 
The 31 -month contract, packed with worker concessions, includes elimination of the 3 percent annual productivity raises for hourly workers, nine-month deferral of cost-of-living allowance increases and dropping of paid personal holidays. 
Auto industry analysts estimate the pact would save up to If> 1 billion, but union and company officials refuse to confirm the estimate. Ford sais it lost more than If, 1 billion in. 1981. 
UAW Vice President Donald Eph· lin admitted yesterday that some jobs would be lost with the elimina­tion of workers' paid personal holidays. It has been estimated up to 3,000 jobs for fill-in employees would be eliminated. 
The agreement, reached Saturday after I 3 days of bargaining, offers at least 50 percent of base wages to laid-off Ford workers with I 5 years or more seniority and improved sup­plemental unemployment benefits to other laid-off workers. There would be a 24-month moratorium on plant closings due to sub­contracting of work to non-union and overseas facilities.

In a related development, the Sal· vadoran military high command said only 28 leftist guerrillas were killed during a five-day army offensive last week in southeastern Usulutan province. A field commander in the operation had previously claimed 400 guerrillas killed. 
The command also denied reports that 400 peasants were massacred during the sweep. 
Nutting, head of the Panama­based Southern Command, arrived Tuesday following reports that the guerrillas were making headway in their 27-month war to overthrow the ruling civilian-military junta. 
Salvadoran officials said Nutting 

met  privately  yesterday  with  
Defense  Minister  Gen.  Jose  
Guillermo Garcia.  

A U.S. Embassy source, who asked anonymity for diplomatic reasons,' said Nutting would "assess the ef. fectiveness of our military assis· tance" during his three-day visit. 
He said Nutting "will visit places where our trainers are working with the Salvadorans" as well as meet with top military officials. 
The Reagan administration an· nounced earlier this month that it was sending $55 million in emer· gency military aid to El Salvador's civilian-military junta, in addition to $25 million approved by Congress two months before. 
In addition, about 50 U.S. non­combat military advisers have been here since early 1981, helping train Salvadoran officers and troops in anti-guerrilla combat and servicing equipment. 1 
The Southern Command controls American military operations throughout Latin America, including lOll Salvador. 
The Reagan administration's an· nouncement of additional aid followed a daring guerrila raid Jan. 27 on the military Ilopango Airport outside San Salvador in which more than a dozen helicopters and plane were damaged or destroyed -half the junta's air force. 
Six Huey· I troop transport . helicopters already have arrived as the first replacements. 
The airport raid and an earlier guerrilla attack that isolated eastern El Salvador by destroying a main bridge over the Lempa River indi· cate the guerrillas' progress in their hit-and-run war. ' 
Western diplomats and relief workers, who asked anonymitY. for security reasons, estimated the guer· rillas move almost at will through 10 ofEJ Salvador's 15 provinces." 
The Reagan admmistration has said additional U.S. military aid is necessary to prevent a . leftist takeover of this Central American nation.

causal link between breastfeeding decisions and marketing practices. 
In May 1981 the World Health Or­ganization passed a non-binding code, by a I 18-1 margin, with three 
1abstentions, which requires infant formula manufacturers to curtail their marketing practices. The only negative vote was cast by the United States on the ground that the code was unconstitutional. The Justice Department later stated that the code was not unconstitutional since it was not a binding agreement. The code calls for the following as mini­mum standards: 
I. An end to the practice ofdis­tributing free samples to mothers and to health workers and institu­tions. 
2. 
An end to the professional service representatives (e.g., mot­hercraft nurses) and a ban on con­tact with mothers or pregnant women by marketing personnel. 

3. 
An end to "financial or material inducements" offered by manufacturers or distributors to health workers and their families to promote infant formula. 

4. 
An end to advertising and other forms of promotion to the general public by infant formula manufacturers-distributors. 


Said Nestle's Dr. Jackson, "Nestle complies with local legal structures developed to meet the needs of in­dividual countries. It will continue to do so. Every nation that voted for the code -and the 39 that did not -can enact the recommended code on its own. Whenever a code is enacted, we will follow it. Nestle will work with every nation in which it markets infant formula and will cooperate in the development of local codes, if so requested." 
Despite the claims by Nestle that the code is being followed, viola­tions arc still being reported. According to reports by IBFAN, the International Baby Food Action Net· work, numerous violations of the code throughout the world have oc-

curred. In September oflast year, for example, it was reported that free samples delivered every week by Nestle are given to each mother on discharge from rural maternity hospitals. In many countries, no changes in label information have been made. 
According to Tim Smith, Ex­ecutive Director of the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), meetings held in late July of 1981 between Nestle's top policy makers and high-level church leaders revealed that Nestle will not adopt the W.H.O./UNICEF Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes as its own.

SMC Academic Council discusses Sr.comps 
ByJIM PLAMONDON 
News Staff 
The Saint Mary's Student Academic Council, a group which deals mainly with questions and problems concerning course cur­riculum, is considering changes in what is felt by some to be an unfair system of administering the senior comprehensives. 
The council, headed by Student Body Vice President Emmy Lopez, has received complaints from stu­dents who feel that some people must work much harder than others to pass the mandatory com­prehensives depending upon their major. The comprehensives are re­quired by each department for graduation. 
Student Body President Eileen Murphy feels that they are "inconsistent from department to department." In some majors a stu­dent is required to take three day dcpartmentals while in others she must complete a lengthy research and Mr. Furer (Chairman of the 

Board), made it explicitly clear in 
our talks that Nestle does not intend 
to adopt the W.H.O./UNICEF Code of Marketing as their own code of conduct, despite the stipulation in Article II of the Code that manufac­turers should regard themselves as required to implement the Code," said Smith. 
In 1978, the Notre Dame/St. Mary's community voted to boycott Nestle products. Notre Dame Food Services also participated in the boycott. In effect for two years, the boycott resolution was extended last year by the Student Affairs Bo}Wtt Gmn ittee . 
project. She added, "We need a 
more equitable system." 
An even greater problem is that some students do not even receive credit for their comprehensives while others do, depending on the students major. Specifically, art and music majors do not get credit, despite the hard work they must put into the comprehensives. 
Lopez says that there is " no con­tinuity between departments." She suggests there be a stipulation of continuity between each depart­ment, so that the comprehensives can be fairer and and so that all stu­dents receive credit for them. 
Mrs. Teresa Marcy, President of Academic Affairs, realizes that there is "considerable unevenness" in the senior comprehensives but feels it is up to the individual departments to correct it. 
The council presently is consider­ing making a booklet which would explain the philosophy of each major and exactly what is required ofa student in that major.

EconomicUpdate 
Car sales fell4.8 percent in the first 10 days of February, the smallest decline this year. The General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation sold 15,370 cars daily in the nine selling days of the period this year, compared with 16,151 in the 10 selling days ofthe same 1981 period. GM reported the smallest sales decline of the domestic industry, selling 9, 792 ars daily, down four-tenths of 1 percent from the 1981 period when 9,834 cars were sold daily. G.M.'s sales totaled 88,131, for a 62 per­
cent share ofthe market, up from the 57.8 percent share held in the comparable 1981 period. "This is a very, very price-sensitive and price-conscious market and the G.M. experience really dramatizes it," said Arvid Jouppi, an analyst at Colin, Hochstin Company in Detroit. 

Marketing Update 
Sagging Selectavision salesare the reason the RCA Corporation yesterday cut the videodisk player's suggested retail price to 5349.95 from S499.95. Early sales of the players, in­troduced last March, have been disappointing. RCA had expected to sell 200,000 units in 1981 but sold only about 65,000 Total industry sales were estimated by RCA at 105,000 units last year. "There are competitive players out there at a lower price, and we must be com­petitive,"Said Frank McCann, a spokesman for RCA's consumer electronics division in Indianapolis. The price-cut, which could drop even lower because of dealer discounts, "comes as no surprise,"said John S. Reidy, an industry analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "But there's still a marketing task ahead to convince the consumer he needs that technology." 
Pac-Man became a hitlast year in America's video game arcades by running around inside a little electronic maze eating dots. These days he could probably eat steak. He could also dance to his own record, "Pac-Man Fever," wear his own Pac-Man pajamas, and tie his shoes, if he had feet, with Pac-Man shoelaces. Although the Pac-Man game was the biggest seller in the $5 billion a year video game industry's briefhistory, the creature's performance in the sublicensing game, according to Stanley W.Jarocki, vice presi­dent for Marketing at Bally Corporation, makers of Pac-Man, will earn the company even more in the long run. "It's a cute creature with cute features," he said. "I don't think the novelty is going to wear off." 
Bud is still king.Anheuser-Busch Inc. has solidified its position as the nation's largest brewer. Last year, according to Emanuel Goldman of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Anheuser raised its market share to 29.5 percent from 27.8 percent, lengthen­ing its lead over Miller to eight points. 

Research Update 
The Reagan Administration'Splan to abolish the Department of Energy has met so much resistance in Congress that legislative approval ofsuch a measure seems unlikely this year. The main obstacle appears to be the strong opposition ofkey mem­bers of the ~ouse and Senate and the lack ofinterest by most other lawmakers in spending much effort on behalf of a measure that seems to have little political appeal and which would do virtually nothing to reduce the budget. 
Fetal studieSare revealing a new understanding of of how a mother affects her unborn child. The series of studies is based on nearly 60,000 births in the United States. The studies, which followed more pregnancies, and for longer periods, than had been done before, raise serious questions about the safety ofworking until the end ofpregnancy and explain how sexual intercourse, cigarette smoking, poor nutrition and advanced maternal age can com­promise the health and survival ofthe fetus.

Transit Freeze-ups 
Researcp. feels budget pinch 
Special toTbe Observer 
--···-­

Governmental agencies are not alone in feeling the pinch of the Reagan administration's budgetary concerns --at least one Notre Dame engineering research project is ex­periencing budget-related changes. 
The research and development project concerns cold weather tran­sit technology, and in spite of some HI ItFii t TI'Iffiiij 
program revamping, continues to 
progress in its search for a means of 
"thawing" mass transit systems often 
rendered inoperable by severe win­
ter weather. 
One of the major changes in the 
project reduces its level ofeffort un­
der 1981 funding to spread the cost 
over a two-year period, thereby 
eliminating additional funding from 
the government's 1982 fiscal year 
budget. The project was initially 
proposed to Congress for funding 
approval over four years. In addi­
tion, the change in the Department 
ofTransportation's focus to develop 
problem-solution technologies for 
use in the near future by existing 
transit systems also led to a search 
for rail systems applications rather 
that those related to automated 
guideway systems. 
Congress approved second-year 
funds in its 1981 transportation ap­
propriations bill at the same level as 
the first year ( 55.5 million ) and the 
grant has been received from the Ur­
ban Mass Transportation Ad­
ministration (UMTA).. Total project 
funding now stands at 51 1 million, 
the halfway point of the original 
program. 
The engineering research is done by Notre Dame faculty who coor­dinate their efforts with the Vought Corporation, which does the 
Rowland's money, Lakerhopes to starta "People's Skytrain' seroicefromNew York to London using some ofhis now repossesed DC -1Os like the one pictured above. One major obstacle to Laker could be Britain's CivilAviation Authority which issues operating licenses. The authority takes into account a personsfinancial past before granting a license. 
engineering test and development. 
With the change in focus, final progress reports are being prepared for some of the work conducted in the first phase of research. Subjects included in those reports are the character of iceophobic materials for traction, studies on the coeffi­cient of friction and rolling friction for rubber-tired vehicles, and the development ofspecial wind tunnel facilities. 
As the second phase of work 
begins, research efforts will em­
phasize problems encountered by 
buses and commuter rail systems 
used in metropolitan areas. Work 
will continue with the goal of 
determining the physical properties 
of the interface between ice, snow, 
and the electrified rails oftransit sys­
tems. 

Researchers will also study pos­sible precursors that may signal initial frost formation that can inter­rupt the electrical power transfer between the rail and the vehicle, thus shutting down the system. Ifan effective system can be developed, it ·may serve as the preventive medicine to eliminate system shut­down by allowing a signal through the rail to notify the operator that frost is forming and that counter­measures should be used. 

Studies are also continuing to ·determine the amount ofenergy and technology needed to remove ice and packed snow from the rails. The use of advanced technologies, including radio frequency induc­tion, microwave, sonics, and hydroblast, are being studied to determine when and where they would be most beneficial. 
The practical application of the Notre Dame research is being carried out by the Vought Corpora­tion of Texas. Vought researchers will work with two existing transit authorities to test the effectiveness of devices such as bus wheel-well liners to prevent buildup of ice and snow and an air drying system to prevent the freezing of condensa­tion in drive motors to cut down on costly motor repair and replace­ment. 
In spite of the reduced pace, Notre Dame's cold weather transit technology program is now aimed at producing useful solutions more quickly, while at the same time the government put a lid on the federal budget.

P.O.BoxQ. 
Dear Editor; We at Nestle a;e ap­
palled, dismayed and outraged at the 
lies and half-truths that have been 
published as fact in The Observer 
about our company's marketing 
practices. An example of a lie is the 
statement that Nestle advertises in­
fant formula in the Third World--this 
company does not and has not for 
more than three years--an easily as­
certainable fact. A half-truth is the 
quotation about bottle-fed infants 
and their relative mortality rate. 
What was unsaid, however, is that only approximately five percent of bottle fed babies are fed exclusively infant formula from those bottles. 
A university has a commitment to truth and objectivity. That commit­ment is sullied when complex issues arc viewed with a built-in bias that takes the statements of some par­tisans at face value and automatically doubts others.

neither should be the terms of the 
contract, given the dismal economic 
and industry conditions. 
Fact after fact, statistic after statis­tic reiterates the worsening economy. We are in the midst of a recession that has put 9.5 million Americans out of work, pushing the January unemployment rate to over 9 percent. The gross national product declined 5.2 percent during the final quarter of 1981 and Treasury Secretary, Donald Regan, predicts the GNP will continue to decline. Last years housing starts, a key in­dicator of economic strength, reached a 35 year low, and interest rates continue to soar to record heights. The Commerce Department recently issued a report claiming im­provements signalin the economic 
the other to cry uncle." Gone arc the days when both labor and managment could afford lengthy, costly work stoppages, demanding much and giving little. Industry slump has made the inherent depen­dency of labor and managment on one another recognized again, as well as the necessity tp agree to con­cessions. 
In addition to the Ford agreement, other recent labor agreements typify the new cooperative relationship. Unions seem to be willing to sacrifice the wage gains they, often, bitterly fought for, in return for assurances of job security. In radical contrast to the Teamsters-trucking company con­tracts of three years ago (guaranteeing a 35 percent pay raise) 

The proposed labor agreement. awaiting rank and tile approval, be­tween the Ford Motor Company and the United Auto Workers, should challenge beliefs that 'the labor uni­ons are ruining this country' with their excessive demands. In the midst of an industry slump and with an eye on dismal economic realities, labor unions are taking a responsible attitude in current bargaining ses­sions. Job security, not wages, is the top demand of labor. 
Provisions of the Ford contract in­clude a 31 month wage freeze and a nine month freeze on cost of living pay increases. The union also relin­quished 26 personal holidays over a three-year period. In return, Ford agreed to a two-year moratorium on plant closings which resl!lt ff!J~ sub­contracting of work to nonunion or foreign sources. In addition, Ford will guarantee 50 percent of the pay of laid off workers with 15 years or more seniority. 
UAW President, Douglas Fraser, as would any self-respecting union leader, termed the agreement his­toric. His remark may not be unex­pected, given his position, but recovery is 'just around the corner.' Well, having heard that song so many times before it begins to sound like a bad version ofan old joke: How do you know the Commerce Depart­ment is crazy? They work in round rooms yelling Recovery is around the comer. 
Like most old jokes, it's not very funny anymore. Union leaders cer­tainly aren't laughing. Despite the administrations rhetoric about a bright future, they are keenly aware of the dark economic realities of the present. Ford Motor Co. lost one bil­lion dollars last year and closed four plants. American Motor Corp. has lost some $300 million over the past two years, and as of January, General Motors has laid off 349,000 workers and closed 21 plants. Finally, American-made new car sales have dropped by approximately 3 million units over the past three years while import sales continue to rise. 
Labor-managment relations are undergoing changes. It is no longer a case of the biggest and the strongest holding back, detiantly, waiting for

Bulls dismiss Head Coach Sloan 
CHICAGO (AP)-Chicago Bulls 
Coach Jerry Sloan was fired yester­
day after the team, haunted by 
rumors ofdissension, skidded to the 
13th loss in its last I 7 contests, a 
team !>pokesman said. 
Sloan, who became head coach in 1979 after II years as a player, was to he replaced temporarily by either General Manager Rod Thorn or As· sistant Coach Phil Johnson, accord­
ing to team spokesman Tim Hallam. 
Immensely popular in a fiery decade-long career as a guard with the Bulls, Sloan tried to bring his on­court intensity to coaching. He led the National Basketball Association team to the playoffs last year, where they were eliminated by the Boston Celtics. 
But ths season's team, with a 19­31 record, was mired in t1fth place in the NBA's Central Division, a situa­tion some players blamed on inter­nal bickering and hostility toward Sloan and his coaching sntem. However, Sloan denied that person­nd problems led to his downfall. 
"I don't blame anyone," he said in a telephone interview. "I have no ill feelings toward my players." 
Sloan said he was not yet certain whether he would seek another coaching job. 
"I would like to spend some time with my family and some other things, but I don't have any specific plans," he said. 
The team scheduled a news con­ference for this afternoon to name

an interim coach. Thorn, who· hired Sloan, expressed regret at his firing. 
"Unfortunately, this kind of thing happens when a team is not playing well," Thorn said. "Hopefully, a change will get the team moving iry the right direction." 
Slqan said he had· no feelings of bitterness at his dismissal. 
"I feel about like I always do," he said. "I don't have any regrets. If I had had one mpre game to coach, everything would have been all right." 
Sloan became the second Chicago ht·ad coach to leave his job this week, and the third this year. Chicago Black Hawks Coach Keith Magnuson resigned Monday night, and Chicago Bears Coach Neill Armstrong was fired after last season. 
A native of McLeansboro,· Ill., Sloan was a college All-American at Evansville University. He was selected in the first round of the 19()5 NBA draft by the Baltimore Bullets and was acquired by the Bulls a year later in the expansion draft in which the team was formed. 
Sloan became known as the "Charlie Hustle" of the NBA, teaming with Norm Van Ucr to form one of most toughest backcourt tan­dems in the league. The pair gained a reputation for dogged defense and diving for loose balls while leading the Bulls into the NBA playoffs in six ofSloan's last seven seasons.

Holmes-Woneyfight postponed 
NEW. YORK (AP) -The Larry 
Holmes-Gerry Cooney heavyweight 
title bout was rescheduled yester­
day for June II after Cooney Was 
checked by three physicians for a 
partially torn muscle behind his left 
shoulder. 
. "I feel very hurt that the fight will 
not take place .in March," Cooney 
said at a news conference at the.New 
York University ,Medical Center, ; where the examination took place. 
"If all I was looking for was the 
money, we wouldn't be here now, 
and I'd be in there March 15. ~y goal 
is winning the heavyweight cham­
pionship of the world." 
Co-promo~r Don King im­
mediately predicted that 
postponement will make the match 
for Holmes' World Boxing Council 
title bigger than ever. King and Sam 
Glass ofTiffany Promotions had said 
each fighter could make as much 
SI 0 million on the March date. 
"The postponment should in­
crease the revenue 25 per cent," 
said King. "Instead of SSO million 
gross, we're talking S7S million and 
S100 million." 
King said the bout at a 32,000-seat 
arena at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas 
now will be held when the weather 
is warmer in the Northeast and more 
outdoor stadiums will be available 
for closed-circuit telecasts.. 
Acouple of hours before the fight 
officially was postponed, King had 
said a tentative date was May 24. At 
the news conference, Bob Halloran, 
sports direc:tor for Caesars World, 
said, "We think it's better in June 
t,han May," ad~ing a lot of rooms 
would be available in Las Vegas then. 
Holmes said Tuesday in Las Vegas 
that if the match was postponed, he 
would fight someone else to stay 
sharp while waiting for Cooney. 
"Holmes probably will be t1ghting and Dennis Rappaport, Cooney's co­in the interim," King said at the news managers, had been "conniving and conference. "It would be in the same scheming" because they wanted to time frame -late March or early push the day back to May orJune all April." along.

me, and it's given me a super educa­tion. But I can see it (the education) taking me off to something else other than (professional) hockey." 
Every college athlete likes to feel that when his athletic career is over, he in some way has contributed to the program he's leaving behind. When one gives of himself so totally for four years, all he hopes for is that people remember him for what he tried to exemplify as an athlete. 
Or as Poulin says, "He'd like to be recognized as someone who gave one hundred percent at all times, and who was fortunate enough to have been given a leadership role, and been able to handle it." 
When asked to write his Notre Dame hockey epitaph, Logan was baffled for a few moments and then responded, "I'd like to be remem­bered by my hockey aspects, but more importantly, I'd like to' be remembered by my good friends on the team."

Boxers prepare for Bengals 
BENGAL BOUTS -Although there are still 17 days until the opening bell for the annual Bengal Bouts tournament, there has been no signs ofprocrastination by the 70-plus members of the Notre Dame boxing club. 
Since the beginningofthe semester, the boxing room in the North Dome of the ACC has been bustling daily with puddles ofsweat similiar to the puddles of melted ice found outside the gym. 
"We have been working them very hard," says club co-president Dickie Hillsman. "Our practices have been quite intense, but we have a very dedicated group with lots ofdetermination. 
"Having our finals televised once again nationally by NBC only adds to our incentives. We realize that the harder we work, the better we look and the better our overall program looks on the national coverage." The team members put in two hours of practice every day, not including the miles that are run before or after practices. 
The tournament itself begins on Sunday March 7, continues with the semi-finals on March 9 and con­cludes with the finals on March 11. Nine or ten weight divisions are planned with a hope of as many as eight participants in each division. Besides the dedication of the members, there is another reason why this year's bouts promise to be more entertaining than ever. 
"Since I have been here," says the senior Hillsman, "this is the most strongest overall group we have had. In the last couple ofyears we have had one or two people that just really stood out over everyone. but this year we have at least 10 people who can be really called top amateurs. 
"We have excellent senior talent which means that the tournament will be all the more intense since it will be their last shot for a title. Plus we have a very good group of novices." 
Seven defending champions return to try to retain their titles -all but one of them being seniors. These returnees include Mike Martersteck ( 140 pounds), club co-president Tommy Bush ( 145), John Donovan ( 150), Greg Brophy ( 170), Mike Burke ( 177) and heavy'!Veight champ Mike Walsh. Graduate studentJim Mladenik also returns to defend his 155-pound title. 

There is more to the Bengal Bouts, however, than just the athletic prowess of the competitors in the ring. As always, the main emphasis that the club measures its real success by is the proceeds which go to the missions in Bangladesh. Now in its 52nd year of existence, the club has raised over a half-million dollars for the mis­sions, including over $19,000 last year. 
MEN'S-WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS -Domination by Notre Dame sophomore Denise McHugh highlighted the gymnastics weekend for the team last Saturday at the University ofMiami (Ohio). McHugh easily took all­around honors among the 18 women that competed by taking first place in the vault, ba!ance beam and parallel bars while placing second in the floor exercise. 
Freshmen Cindy Salvino and Kathy Wolter also had commendable individual efforts. Salvino was runner-up to McHugh in the vault and took fourth place in the floor exercise. Wolter, meanwhile, had a third-place finish in the balance-beam competition. The Miami women won the meet with 104.35 total points while the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's club had 75.2. Purdue finished with 37.95 points. 
The men's team was led by club president Brian McLaughlin, who finished in third place among 35 par­ticipants in the all-around competition. Top individual performances for Notre Dame were turned in by fresh­man Mike Dorenbusch who placed sixth on the rings, junior Ed Barret's seventh-place finish on the high bar and senior Louis DeLeon's eighth-place spot on the pummel horse. 
An all-scholarship team of Slippery Rock placed first in the meet with 219.9 total points. Miami, Notre Dame and Purdue finished with 154.55, 123.75 and 46 points respectively. ·

Poulin, Logan spur on icers

Sports Writer 
With the brand of successful and 
consistent play that the Notre Dame 
hockey team has shown of late, it's 
forgivable if one forgets the 
mediocre performances of Novem­
ber and Decemlber. 
Whenever a team does a complete turnabout during the course of a season, the reasons usually stem not from one player or one aspect of the game, but rather from numerous in­gredients which combine to produce a formula for victory. The 1981-82 Notre Dame hockey team is no exception. 
Goalie Bob McNamara finally is living up to the high expectations he brought with him from high school, and has been stellar in the cage. The defense has gelled and in the last three games has given up only five goals. The team is playing physical hockey, and combined with the backchecking ofthe forechecking of the forwads, the Irish are wearing down opponents early. 
Perhaps overlooked in NO's 10-3­1 stretch since Christmas break is the leadership and performances provided by the co-captains, Dave Poulin and jeffLogan. The man who directs the team from behind the bench, Coach Lefty Smith, has not fallen prey to this oversight however. 
"Very frankly," says Lefty, "I at­tribute the success ofthis year's club to the captains, and the leadership 
NIT : Togetin, you've gotta win 
NEW YORK -Digger Phelps has come home, and he's looking for some help. 
Traditionally, Phelps brings his Fighting Irish team to The Big Apple once a year. While the trip is a valuable recruiting tool, it is more of a media event. Digger meets with the New York press to trade one-liners and stories about his childhood days in nearby Beacon. 
He also comes so the powers-that-be in the media 
world get a chance to watch his tournament-bound 
team perform. He talks up his stars, brags about their 
ability, and boldly makes predicitions about their 
chances in the annual chase for the national champion­
ship. 
This year, all the talking in the world may not help. 
Phelps has been pumping up the press with talk of 
"near misses," telling the writers about "the best 7-13 
team in the country," and how his team has "made a 
complete turnaround." If the Irish beat Seton Hall 
tonight, he's going to need a lot of help from those 
writers, and from other New York natives as well. 
Phelps has made a promise, the latest of many that 
llave, so far, fallen by the wayside in this, the winter of 
Phelps' discontent. He promised the press, and he 
promised the students. Now, he's got to try to make 
good. 
We are in the backyard of the National Invitational · 
Tournament, a catch-all event that used to decide the 
nation's college basketball champion, but now serves 
simply as a goal for harried coaches with undermanned 
squads. 
For teams like Phelps's 1972-73 edition, it is the undreamed-ofreward at the end ofa Cinderella season. Coming off a 6-20 season, the Irish were 18-11 before they lost an ovenime thriller to Virginia Tech in the finals ofthe NIT that year. 
For teams like Terry Holland's 1979-80 Virginia team, the NIT is the last hurdle on the road to respectability. Ralph Sampson was just a freshman when he led the Cavaliers to five NIT wins and the title just two shon 
years ago. 
For teams like the 1980-81 squads ofTulsa and West Virginia, it is proofthey can play in the big time, and it gives them the self-confidence that's made both a Top 20 team this season. 
But to get in, you've gotta win. 
For all the talk about "almost" and "ifonly," the Irish have not won, and chances are very strong that they will not get in. 
A win tonight would help. You can be sure the NIT people will be in the Brendan Byrne Arena at New jer­sey's Meadowlands Spons Complex, and they'll be watching very closely. 
r 

It will be no easy task for the Irish. Seton Hall is tough, and will be no pushover. Head Coach "Hoddy" Mahon took over a program in shambles when he got the job last November. He inherited an 1 1-16 squad that Bill Rafeny left to pursue business interests. Mahon got the job as interim coach, and Seton Hall promised a nationwide search for a successor. 
Now, they may end the search. 
"The first application they're going to get for this job is mine," says Mahon. "I have no intention ofgiving up the job after only one year; I've had a lifelong dream to be head coach at a college and it has finally come true." 
Mahon has made the Pirates respectable in a very tough Big East Conference. They have been able to hold their own with every opponent, and actually beat several conference opponents early in the season. 
"These guys are tough," attests Villanova's Rollie Mas­simino. "They came very close to beating us just before we played Notre Dame. They are no pushover anymore.'' 
Mahon built this winner around very little ex­perience. The one exception is 6-2 guard Dan Cal­landrillo. The Pirates leading scorer last season, he led the entire Big East with a 19.4 ppg average in 1979-80. So far this year, he has moved up the all-time Hall scoring list, leading his club in scoring for the third year in a row. 
Then, unfonunately for Mahon, things fell apart over Christmas vacation. Three Pirate staners were placed on academic probation, and Seton Hall fortunes took a dramatic turn for the worse. They are struggling.now; actually, floundering probably is closer to the truth. But that makes this no less vital a game for Notre Dame. 
Phelps realizes the importance of this game, and he put the Irish through a particularly tough practice week in South Bend. 
"1 promise," Digger said to the students assembled at the Mardi Gras dance last weekend, "that you'll all have place to go over spring break. We are going to steal an NIT bid." 
Now, however, aU the talking is over. The future of the Notre Dame basketball season rests, just as it always had, real1y, with the men who will take the coun tonight. 
we've gotten out ofour seniors." 

With four crucial contests and the playoffs on the horizon, do the two captains feel an extra responsibility to the team? 
"The responsibility intensifies and I welcome it," says Poulin, "But at this time everyone is more intense." 
Logan echoed his teammate's sentiments: "I'm really looking for­ward to it (the last four games)," he says. "This is going to be the ending of my career and I really want to make this last stretch count." 
Perhaps Logan's burning desire to make his last few games memorable stems from the fact that he'd probab­ly like to forget what thus far has been a season full of personal disap­pointments. 
"I've had a rough year," he la­ments. "My performance doesn't even come close to the goals I've set for myself in the beginning of the year. 
"But teamwise we couldn't be sit­ting in a better position, we're peaking. I think this is the best I have seen us play in my four years here." 
On the other hand, center Dave Poulin must be quite satisfied with the season he has had up until now. Leading the team in points with 27 goals and 26 assists, including three goals this past weekend against Fer­ris State, he has proved himselfto be one the premiere players in the CCHA. 
The modest co-captain attributes 
his impressive sta-statistics to fate. 
"Fate has had its way," he says. "I've 
been injury free, the line set-ups 
have been great, and of course the 
fact that the team is doing well has a 
lot to do with my perfomance." 

With five wins in a row, Notre 
Dame has produced worry in the 
hearts ofCCHA foes. In years passed, 
no one wanted to play the Irish in 
the playoffs because of their un­
predictability. This year no one 
NCAAplansformat for women'S tourney 
By MARK HANNUKSELA 
Sports Writer 

Although an 83-53 setback does 
one's chances of receiving a bid to a 
national tournament little good, 
Notre Dame's women's basketball 
Coach Mary DiStanislao still harbors 
hopes. 

Ofcourse, what happens through 
the season's remaining four games 
will have a great deal of impact on 
Irish chances. Wins over South 
Carolina, Nebraska, DePaul and 
Michigan State will by no means 
guarantee Notre Dame a bid, despite 
the fact that the Irish will have won 
20 games. 

Chances are, though, that wins 
over those four very good teams 
might make Notre Dame one of 19 
teams that will receive an at-large 
benh. 

Thineen conference winners will 
qualify automatically for the 32­
team event. Ohio State, a winner 
over Illinois in the finals of the Big 
Ten tournament last weekend, and 
Kansas State, champion of the Big 
Eight, are among the teams which al­
ready have qualified. 

Winners ofthe Southeast, Atlantic Coast, Mid-American and Southwest conferences are among the other automatic qualifiers. 
This is the first year that the NCAA has sanctioned championships for women. Previously, tournaments came under the auspices of the As­sociation ofIntercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW). 
wants to play the Irish in the playoffs because they are predictably good. 
But what kind of effort is it going to take to qualify for the CCHA Tournament in Detroit, and come home with the MacNaughton Cup? 
"It's going to take twenty guys pulling together," Poulin feels. "If we get the same kind of perfor­mance we've had as of late, we can go all the way." 
Is Poulin referring to Providence, RI., the cite ofthis year's NCAA Divi­sion I Hockey Finals? "Providence is the sight that we all have our eyes on," he says. 
"Providence is where everyone is really aiming at," adds Logan. "In the past we've talked about it, but it hasn't been a reality." 
Is all this talk about the Final Four 
just wishful thinking among the 
players? Not according to Coach 
Lefty Smith. 
"The way we've been playing as of 
late," says Smith, "is such that any­
thing is possible." But the National 
Championship? "I'd say this team has 
shown that it's very capable of win­
ning the National Championship." 
Whether the Irish end their 
season in Providence, Detroit or 
South Bend, it's probable that all the 
seniors will be hanging up the skates 
that they've been lacing up since 
early childhood for the last time in a 
few weeks. 
Both Logan and Poulin realize that 
their shifts are numbered and hock­
ey will be just a pleasant memory 
shonly. "I've thought about it quite a 
bit, and it's a kind of scary feeling, 
says Logan. "I could never really un­
derstand how the seniors in the past 
felt, but now I can." 
Poulin feels very appreciative to 

the sport that has given him so 
much. "I don't see hockey as an end 
in itself," he says. "It's been great to 
See CAPTAINS, page 10 

A number ofschools have chosen to continue to compete under AlAW guidelines, which means that if they should win a tournament in one of the conferences that has an automatic qualifier, it will be up to the conference to recommend to the committee who its representitive should be. 
In many cases, that representitive will be the runner-up in the tourna­ment. 
All teams will receive their official bids at 5 p.m. on March 6, following a three-day conference in Kansas City, Kan., between a nine-member selection committee. 
IfDiStanislao's club receives a bid, it will come within minutes of its final regular season game against Michigan State. 
The NCAA tourney format for women is similar to the men's for­mat. Eight groups of four teams will be set up. Each group will have what
