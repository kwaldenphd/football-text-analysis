Lafayette case unresolved 
By LAUREN BECK 
Nev.·s Wrirer 
Debate in the lawsuit between the city of South Bend and Tari pp Development Corp. may be over for now, but students who live in Lafayette Apartments remained con­fused about the situation and worried that tho issue is not yel. resolved. 
Thomas Dixon, attorney for Taripp president and Lafayette landlord Chris Matteo, said tho lawsuit has been stayed, meaning neithnr party is currently pursuing it. 
Dixon said he and his client had clarified the mis­understandings that caused the problem and had worked to solve it without subjecting Lafayette ten­ants to fines or eviction. 
South Bend filed the law­suit against Taripp follow­ing repeated complaints of intoxication, consumption of alcohol by minors, loud noise, indecent exposure and trash and debris on the property. Specific concerns regarding a party on Sept. 6 were cited in the lawsuit, which was filed on Oct. 11. 
Assistant City Attorney Ann-Carol Nash said the police had been addressing problems for the past three years at the apartment complex, leading the city to believe that the property constituted a public nui­sance. 
Concerns about possible trouble with the city prompted Tracy Clark of Real Estate Management, 

property manager for Lafayette, and Capt. Wanda Shock of the South Bend Police Department to meet with Lafayette residents on Sept. 4. Clark and Shock advised students of policies regarding gatherings. 
Dixon said a key mis un ­derstanding occurred at that meeting, leaving resi­dents unclear as to the offi­cial rules. 
"The police informed ten­ants that the City was con­cerned with parties spilling over into the front parking areas of the comp]ex and adjoining streets, and that as long as parties were kept under reasonable con­trol in the back area, there would be no problem," said Dixon. 
But the tenants' lease states that outdoor parties

A St. Joseph County Superior Court judge could forgo a jury trial and rule in favor of a former S a i n t Mary's stu­dent who alleged in a lawsuit that ex-Notre Dame foot­ball player Clifford Jefferson raped her last year. 
Lawyers for the alleged vic­tim this week asked Judge Jenny Pitts Manier to enter a default judgment for the woman, according to court 

are not allowed without the landlord's permission. 
"Quite reasonably, the tenants believed they had received that permission because a representative of the landlord was present when the police gave the OK for parties in the back area,"said Dixon. "That understanding was bol­stered at the next party when, throughout the evening, police on regular patrol told students to keep their party in the back." 
When police issued cita­tions to five guests at the party, which took place two days after the meeting with Shock and Clark, the city decided to take legal action to get its message across to students and landlord.

records. If Manier approves the motion, it would have the effect of' finding Jefferson liable in the civil case and would likely negate the need for a trial. 
In the meantime, the judge has postponed the trial to Jan. 21. 
The trial was to begin Monday, but neither Jefferson nor an attorney ror the for­mer Notre Uame cornerback appeared in court. That's when attorneys for the plain­tiff' made a motion for default judgment, a tactic commonly used when the opposing party is unresponsivt~ to court dates.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Words of advice 
I thought I would take this opportunity to pass down a few words of advice to my junior counterparts. 
Last year, my friends and I con­gratulated our­selves on being masters of the uni­verse after con­quering that most­difficult-of-all years, junior year. I had made it through what was suppos­edly the most diffi­cult philosophy class. my roommate survived public pol­icy and business law. We were, of course, amazing students to have sur­vived such classes and planned to enjoy the fruits of our labor when we stepped onto campus as the ever-powerful, ever­unproductive senior. 
We signed up for the mandatory but lazy 12 credits, planning on spending most of our nwnerous hours offree time planning what outfits we would wear to Heartland and coming up v,ith new MP3 play lists. 
We came onto campus basking in the sunlight of senior year. 
Then the great shadow of the comp eclipsed our sunlight and made us the slaves we are today. 
Hours and hours of free time spent watching ESPN, blending daiquiris and dancing turned into hours and hours in the library. Did anyone else know that place actually existed? 
The piles of beer cans and clothes that_ were smoky from the bar were replaced with piles of books on subjects as fasci­nating as "Sartre and his existentialist drama," "the army oflnd.ia and the development of frontier warfare" and "male domination in the image of ath­letes." And that was just the beginning. 
We thought we spent a lot of time in front of our computers before. But time in front of computers junior year gener­ally involved chatting on IM, playing Snood, and checking email to see if that guy you met last night actually emailed like he said he would. 
This year, when I'm looking at my computer screen, Microsoft Word pro­claims that I am revising page 10 of 25 pages of single-spaced paragraphs regarding what should help me with the rest of my life. 
But let's think about this. I am a the­atre and philosophy major. I'm going to law school next year. As much as I want to spend hours and hours writing a paper on Sartre's "No Exit" (don't get me wrong, I really do like the play), I have trouble seeing how the comprehensive requirement is going to better prepare me for law school. 
Want a better example? How about spending weeks of your life chronicling the war in India and Pakistan, compar­ing it to the war in the Middle East and discussing what relevant lessons were learned in the first war that could help the conflict in the Middle East. Then, after writing that 30-page paper, try tak­ing a two-day test on every period in human history. 
Welcome to senior year. 
Welcome to the comp. 
Welcome to hell.

Jefferson 
continued from page 1 
Jefferson had missed f'iling deadlines and court dates related to the original April 3, 2001. suit against him. On the day of the hearing to consider tho motion, Jefferson retained a new lawyer who asked for an extension to file a response to the original complaint. 
Hecent documents show that Jefferson, who graduated in 2001, is not currently rep­resented by counsel in the pending lawsuit. His last lawyer withdrew in October because he was unable to communicate with his client after Jefferson returned to his native Texas over the summer. 
The suit against Jefl'erson alleges that he raped then­19-year-o ld Saint Mary's freshman early March 22, 2001, after meeting her at a downtown South Bend bar. It claims Jefferson gave the woman a false name at the bar and later raped her in his car parked on Saint Mary's campus while she was passed

out from the effects of alco hol. 
The woman wont home to Pennsylvania a week after the alleged assault and has not returned to school. She filed suit after a state police inves­tigation found no grounds to pursue criminal charges. 
The suit seeks damages for medical bills incurred by the woman and for physical and emotional suffering. It also seeks damages to discourage the alleged assailant from future sexual assaults. 
Jefferson has reportedly denied the rape allegation and claimed the sex was con sensual. 
Four other former Notre Dame football players are awaiting trial early next year on criminal charges that they sexually assaulted a then 20· year-old female University student in March. University officials expelled the men in April for sexual misconduct, and the St. Joseph County prosecutor brought charges against them last summer.

From Friday to Sunday, the annual Madrigal Christmas Dinners take place in Regina North Lounge, where guests can celebrate the holidays. Renaissance-style. 
Nancy Menk, production coordinator of the Madrigal Dinners, describes the production as being reminiscent of the 16th century.

Harrass, 
a senior at Saint Mary's and one of the Madrigal singers, looks forward to partici­pating in her first Madrigal Dinner after many weeks of practicing for the performances. 
"We have been practic­ing ever since Fall Break and we've put a lot of work into it. It's been nice, singing traditional songs, since I'm used to singing contemporary pieces. It's really put me in the Christmas mood and has been a lot of fun," Harrass said. 
Although very few changes have taken place over the years, Menk looks forward to improve­ments in this year's din­ners. 
"Our costume designer, Maggie Baker, has designed new costumes for the food servers and actors. Also, Thomas Boelman, the Set Designer, has improved the set, making many physical changes to the performance," Menk said. 
Since past reactions to the Madrigal Christmas Dinners have been highly favorable, Menk said she is confident in the success of this year's production. 
"The Madrigal Dinner is a well-supported tradition in our community. We sell out every year, which is why we have added a fourth performance on Sunday afternoon." 
The Madrigal Christmas Dinners takes place in Regina North Lounge, beginning at 7:00 p.m. The Sunday afternoon matinee takes place at 
2:00 pm. 
Tickets are $32.50 and are available only in advance at the Saint Mary's College Box Office, 284-4626. Tickets to attend Friday and Saturday's dinners are sold out; tickets are still available for Sunday.

The lawsuit stated Lafayette posed a risk to the health and safety of the community and held Taripp responsible for permitting illegal activities on their property. 
"We sued the owner of the property since the peo­ple creating problems var­ied from year to year. so we concluded the place wasn't managed well," said Nash. 
An Oct. 30 letter from D i x o n explained ever, does not define what constitutes an outdoor party. 
Dixon insisted he and Matteo were on the stu­dents' side. 
"Some students were upset and didn't realize what we had to do to keep the city at bay, but we wanted to let them know that we hear them and understand where they are coming from," he said.

Dixon said the party vio­1ated the residents' lease because students attending the party broke the City's noise, trash and public incl'ccency laws. The party exposed residents to poten­tial eviction and fines from the City ranging from $50 to $2,5000. 
Some tenants criticized the letter as harsh and con­fusing, but Dixon said he just wanted to make sure students controlled their future parties since the City had its eye on them. 
To assuage students' fears. Dixon held a meeting that night to clarify the terms of the lawsuit and address other student con­cerns. In a letter he wrote the next day, Dixon acknowledged that students were confused about the policy on outdoor parties. Since Shock and other police officers had given students information that contradicted the terms of their leases, Dixon agreed that it would be unfair to assess them attorney's fees. 
Dixon said the lawsuit did not apply directly to stu­dents. but he advised them to carefully study and abide by their lease. namely. the clause that forbids outdoor parties without prior approval. The lease, how­

Senior Lafayette resident Albert Gembara said the apartments have been sub­dued in the months after the lawsuit was filed, although he thought it was too early to judge the whole situation. 
"It has detracted from the whole atmosphere. There are still some random par­ties but not to the same extent," he said. 
Gembara said he and other tenants still did not know what the status of the lawsuit was and what, if any, consequences it would have for them. Overall. he said his experience at Lafayette has not lived up to his expectations. 
"We wouldn't have lived here had we known it was going to be like this," he said. "If we have problems,. the landlord addresses them, but haphazardly and unwillingly." 
Nash said she is pleased with the current situation at Lafayette and thinks the lawsuit will be resolved soon. 
"I think that the owner of the complex and the man­agement have been working hard to help everyone understand what the rules should be, and I haven't heard any complaints from the police department," she said. 
Dixon recently wrote a letter to the city asking officials to dismiss the law­suit without prejudice,

IRAQ 
Hussein urges Iraqis to support U. N. inspectors 
Associated P rcss 
BAGHDAD 
President Saddam Hussein urged the Iraqi people on Thursday to support the new U.N. arms inspections as a welcome opportunity to disprove American allega­tions that his government still harbors weapons of mass destruction. 
The White I louse quickly rejected those claims, insisting they lack credibility. President Bush, asked on Thursday if the United Stales was headed toward war, replied: "That's a question you should ask to Saddam Hussein." 
In a holiday greeting to Iraqi leaders, Saddam said he agreed to the inspections, in which one of his own palaces was searched, "to keep our people out of harm's way" in the face of U.S. threats. 
The Iraqi president's remarks contrast­ed sharply with a vice president's harsh words about the inspections late Wednesday. Taha Yassin Ramadan had accused the U.N. monitors of being U.S. and Israeli spies and of staging the presi­dential palace inspection as a provocation. 
Saddam spoke at a gathering of the leadership of his Baath Party and the Iraqi military on the first morning of the three­day Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. 
He denounced an "unjust, arrogant, debased American tyranny." Then, turn­ing to U.S. allegations that Iraq retains chemical and biological weapons, he said Iraqis wanted to disprove those claims after a four-year absence of U.N. weapons inspectors from their country. 
"Some might claim that we didn't give them a proper chance to resist, with tangi­ble evidence, the American allegations," Saddam said. 
"We shall provide them with such a chance," he said, referring to the round of 
U.N. weapons inspections that began last week. 
Washington threatens to go to war against Iraq if, in the U.S. view, it does not cooperate in the disarmament effort. Alluding to eventual war, Saddam declared: "We shall take the stand that befits our people, principles and mission. Victory will be yours." 
In Washington, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said the United States will provide intelligence to U.N. inspectors to prove allegations that Iraq still holds banned weapons. 
"The president of the United States and the secretary of Defense would not assert as plainly and bluntly as they have that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction if it was not true, and if they did not have a solid basis for saying it," Fleischer said.

lsreali tank shell hits building, kills 7: 
Amid a battle with Palestinian gunmen, an Israeli army tank lircd a shell into a two-story building in Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, killing seven people and wounding at least seven, wit­nesses and hospital officials said Friday. Israeli troops moved into the camp early Friday with tanks backed by helicopters. The army said it was conducting a targeted operation. 
Australia wildfire destroys homes, cars: 
The worst bush fires in a generation raged out of control around Sydney on Friday, forcing hundreds of people to flee their homes as firefighters strug­glnd to contain the towering flames. Overnight, strong, hot winds fanned more than 60 fires around Australia's largest city, including one in a park just six miles from downtown. Overnight rain in some areas and a change in wind direction failed to extin­guish the flames. 
NATIONAL NEWS BRIEFS 
Bush to argue Iraq violating U.N. pact: 
The Bush administration set the stage Thursday for mak­ing its case for U.N. Security Council action against Saddam Hussein, contending it has solid evidence that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. The White House would not say what its evidence might be. Saddam said in Baghdad that Iraq wants to disprove the U.S. allegations, though he did not explicitly deny having chemical, biologi­cal and nuclear weapons or a program to develop long­range missiles. 
Aircraft hits Miami Federal Reserve Bank: 
A small plane crashed into the Federal Reserve Bank Building and one body was recovered from the wreckage Thursday night, the branch manag­er said. About 90 people were evacuted from the one-story building, and no one inside was injured. The aircraft slammed into the northeast side of the bank about 8:45 p.m., exploded and burst into flames. 
Court weighs campaign finance arguments: 
A federal court Thursday heard challenges to tho new campaign finance law's limits on the ads that political parties and interest groups run on behalf of candi­dates. even as the Federal Election Commission spelled out how it will enforce the limits. Lawyers opposing the limits told a three-judge panel the law will chill political speech by corporations, labor unions, and political parties. They were among several groups challenging the law in a hearing that began Wednesday. 
Ore. child welfare workers fired by state: 
Two child welfare agency workers were fired Thursday for how the agency handled reports that a girl was being sexually abused by a man who now is charged with killing her and a friend.

The couple's attorney, Michael Karr, said he would advise them to ask the full court to review the decision by the three-judge panel. Karr declined to comment further on the opinion. 
Li and Yu, an unmarried couple, fled China in 1998 after officials gave Ll a forced pregnancy exam. At the exam, she was held down while a doctor examined her "private parts," Li, then 19, said according to court records. 
Li said she was told she would receive similar tests in the future, and if found preg­nant, would be subject to an abortion. She said officials told her her boyfriend, Yu, then 21, could also be sterilized. 
"I was so scared. I was yelling. I was making noises," Ll said, according to court doc­uments, adding that officials threatened her, "For the rest of your life you cannot have child." 
Her exam came after the two were observed spending time together until early hours of the morning, and a man in their village told Li her rela­tionship with Yu was "shame­ful," she said. Li told him to stop interfering, and that she planned to have many babies with her boyfriend. 
After the exam, the couple applied for a marriage certifi­cate, but were told they did not meet the minimum marriage age requirements -20 for females, 22 for males. 
A few months later Li and Yu heard there was an order for their arrest. They fled to San Francisco, where they claimed they were United States citi­zens. They later admitted they were citizens of China. 
The Immigration and Naturalization Service sought to send them back to China, but Li and Yu applied for asy-

lum. Karr said Li was perse­cuted because she resisted a "coercive population control program" by the Chinese gov­ernment. 
Li was turned down by an immigration judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals because she failed to demon­strate she had been persecuted in China. or that she had a well-founded fear of persecu­tion, according to court docu­ments. Justice Department spokesman Jorge Martinez declined to comment on the case. 
In its opinion. the federal panel agreed with the immi­gration board in denying Yu's asylum petition. 
"While one may condemn the way Xu was treated as inconsistent with human rights, we cannot say that the record compels us to conclude that her treatment was an 'extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment,' or that she would likely face such treatment on her return," Judge J. Clifford Wallace wrote. 
Philip Hwang, staff attorney at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights in San Francisco, which helps low-income refugees seeking asylum, said the decision could make it more difficult for others. Hwang read the decision. but was not involved in the case. 
"The danger is that the court has somehow raised the bar on what you need to show," Hwang said. "If a woman who has gone through an invasive physical examination of her private parts by strangers can't meet the standard for persecution, what is that going to mean for the next refugee?"

"We are interested in high­lighting that the introduction of the Euro is not simply an economic event," Messina said. "That is something that to some extent is underempha­sized. We are going to learn as a result of the papers and pre­sentations from our colleagues what they think the ultimate significance of the Euro will be. We don't have a precon­ceived idea about this."

Mattel agrees to pay $477,000 fines 
Mattel Inc., maker of Barbie dolls and other famous toys. agreed along with two of its for­mer employees to pay $477,000 in fines for making political donations in the names of other people, the third-largest fine ever imposed by the Federal Election Commission.

Among the recipients: the Democratic National Committee, the Gore 2000 presidential campaign; committees for California's Democratic senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein.

Grand jury to hear N.H. church abuse case 
Associated Press 
CONCORD, N.H. 

A grand jury investigat­ing how the Catholic church handled child sex abuse cases has been scheduled for a special meeting Dec. 13, The Associated Press has learned. 
The grand jury has been hearing evidence against the Roman Catholic Diocese of Manchester for several months. Sources familiar with the case, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a decision on an indictment could come as soon as the meeting next Friday. 
While priests have been convicted on sex abuse charges, no diocese over has been indicted in the United States. 
Attorney General Philip McLaughlin would not com­m en t Thursday on the i,nvestigation, but would not rule out a settlement. 
The grand jury in Manchester is looking at cases dating to the 1960s which involve nearly 50 priests and more than 100 alleged victims, according 

to Senior Assistant Attorney General Will Delker. He said tho probe has focused on the church's actions, but individuals also could face charges. 
Any indictments likely would be misdemeanors brought under the state's child endangerment statute. For an institution, a misde­meanor conviction carries fines of up to $20,000 per offense. 
Patrick McGee. spokesman for the diocese, declined to comment. The diocese covers the state. 
McLaughlin's office has 
been investigating whether diocesan officials violated child endangerment laws by transferring from parish to parish priests suspected of molesting children. He has said he planned to finish the investigation before he leaves office on Dec. 18. 
Patrick Schiltz, dean of the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis, said an indict­ment of a diocese would be unprecedented. Schiltz. who has represented the church in abuse cases, said he was skeptical about going after the church, 
rather than individual wrongdoers. 
"To go further and indict the Catholic Church in the clergy sex abuse scandal is pretty out there," he said. 
Delker would not say whether Bishop John McCormack is a target of the investigation. McCormack, who became bishop of Manchester in 1998. has been ace used of ignoring complaints about abusive priests in Massachusetts while he served as one of Cardinal Bernard Law's top deputies from 1984 to 1994.

117 cruise passengers fall ill 
Associated Pres, 
MIAMI 

Nearly 120 people have ber.n sickened with symp­toms consistent with a. Norwalk-like virus on a fourth cruise ship to report an outbreak of a stomach ailment in recent weeks. 
The Oceana, operated by P&O Cruises of Great Britain. reported that 114 passengers and thrne crew nrnmhlrs have been treat cd for some sort of virus. the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
said Wednesday. 
More than 1.000 passen­gers have recently become sick cin cruise ships, but cruise lines and travel agents said the problems have not significantly cut into business. 
A CDC spokesman said the symptoms aboard the Oceana arc consistent with the virus that have recently plagued llolland America's Amsterdam, Carnival Cruise Lines' Fascination and Disney Cruise Line's Magic. Federal health offi­cials were expected to board the Oceana to inves­tigate. 
The Oceana, carrying 1,859 passengers on a 15­night trip, is on only its third sail since its inaugur­al voyage from Fort Lauderdale's Port Everglades on Nov. 1. 
The Norwalk and Norwalk-like viruses can cause diarrhea, stomach pain and vomiting for 24 to 48 hours. according to the CDC. They are spread through food and water and close contact with infected people or things they have touched. 
Health officials said the "Some of our passengers sickness is common, espe­who are experienced cruis­cially in colder months. ers do understand the real

Flight delays decrease 21 percent this year 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Flight delays are down 21 percent this year and. notwithstanding Thursday's East Coast storm, good weath­er is the main reason. 
The Federal Aviation Administration considers a flight delayed if it takes off or lands at least 15 minutes later than scheduled because of problems in the air traffic sys­tem -mostly weather and congestion. Through the first 11 months of the year, delays fell to 263,197 from 332. 562 in 2001. 
Weather is responsible for about two-thirds of all delays. 
While the good weather was mainly responsible for the improvement, FAA officials also credited a project begun in the delay-ridden summer of 1999 to improve air traffic procedures and use new tech­nology. 
"We're getting more experi­enced," FAA spokesman William Shumann said. "The entire FAA air traffic system and the airlines and other users are doing a better job of managing delays due to weather." 
A comparison for just the first eight months of each year shows that delays fell by 32 percent in 2002. That time frame does not include the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the congestion that followed as the aviation system strug­gled to return to capacity. 
Helping ease air traffic this year was a 7. 9 percent decline in scheduled flights through November 2002. 
David Stempler, president of 
the Air Travelers Association. said the decline in delays is good news but that air tra!Tic control is just one part of an aviation system that needs to be improved. "More and bet­ter-utilized runways would go a long way in reducing delays," he said. 
The FAA's survey includes all scheduled flights -from airliners to corporate jets ­in the United States and Canada. The survey does not measure delays caused by an airline, such as engine trou­ble. 
J\ separate survey by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics shows that in the first eight months of this year, late arrivals fell by 24 percent and late departures by 28 per­cent, compared with January­October in 2001. These statis­tics measure 10 major air­lines. 
FAA Administrator Marion Blakey said this week that more improvements in the air traffic control system as well as four new runways opening next year in some of the nation's busiest airports ­Denver. Houston, Miami and Orlando, Fla. -will further reduce delays.

6 South American leaders hold trading bloc summit 
Associated Preos 

BRASILIA 
Six South American presi­dents convened a summit of the continent's largest trading bloc Thursday. aiming to work out a timetable for a free trade agreement covering most of the continent. 
A key issue at the two-day summit -taking place amid political and economic turbu­lence in the region -was a schedule for eliminating tariff barriers between the six Mercosur countries and five other South American coun­tries that belong to the Andean Community trading bloc. 
Cl.oser cooperation between the two blocs could give South America more muscle in U.S.­led negotiations for the Free Trade Area of the Americas, which would create a free trade zone stretching from Alaska to Patagonia by 2005. 
The Mercosur presidents, who met behind closed doors Thursday, were also expected to formalize a plan to allow people to work in member countries and more easily obtain citizenship. 
But turmoil distracted from discussions. Financial chaos in Argentina and currency prob­
-, ...~ .. ~'l'"l~.~.... -~ ~ ~

lems in Brazil have dragged the Mercosur region into crisis. 
The trading bloc -Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay -has a combined gross product of almost $1 tril­lion. Chile and Bolivia are associate members. 
On Thursday, traders pushed the value of the Brazilian real down to a five-week low of 
3.77 to the dollar. 
Investors in South America's largest economy are nervous about inflation while firms are having to pay burgeoning debts in dollars. There are also concerns about President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's delay in appointing key eco­nomic officials. 

News that Paraguayan presi­dent Luis Gonzalez Macchi faces impeachment on charges of corruption sent ripples of concern among delegates at the summit. 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Lafer underlined that "there is a democratic clause characterizing Mercosur. That means full respect of the democratic rule." 
Mercosur has used its power before to ensure that democra­cy prevailed in Paraguay. 
Countries that do not comply with the organization's democ­racy rule face the threat of being expelled from the trade bloc. 
Paraguayan President Luis Gonzalez Macchi, who was attending the summit, told reporters Thursday the allega­tions against him -that he once owned a stolen luxury automobile and mishandled millions of dollars in state funds -were politically moti­vated and he was ready to face Paraguay's parliament. 
Gonzalez Macchi also said the summit's final declaration Friday will address the politi­cal chaos in Venezuela and the crisis in Argentina. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez had intended to sit in on the sum­mit but was forced to cancel because of a general strike at home aimed at ousting him from power. 
Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru belong to the Andean Community. 
Outgoing Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso hosted the summit, but visiting presidents also met with Silva, who takes office Jan. 1.

Prosecutors seek reversal in New York jogger case 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

Citing DNA on a sock, prosecu­tors asked a judge Thursday to throw out the convictions of five young men found guilty of beat­ing and gang-raping a jogger during a 1989 "wilding" spree in Central Park that exposed the city's deep racial divide to the rest of the nation. 
District Attorney Hobert Morgcnthau's recommendation came 11 months after a convict­ed rapist who had never before come under suspicion in the case confessed. Also, DNA tests con­firmed that his semen was on one or tho socks the victim was wearing 13 years ago. 
Morgenthau stopped short of declaring the five innocent, but said the confession and the tests create "a probability that the verdicts would have been more favorable to the defendants." And he said no purpose would be served by retrying them. 
The decision of whether to throw out the convictions rests with state Justice Charles Tejada, who is expected to rule by Feb. 6. 
The attack on a white 28-year­old investment banker, allegedly by a gang of black and Hispanic boys from Harlem, became emblematic of New York City's struggles with crime and race relations in Urn late 1980s. 
The live defendants, who were 14 to 16 at the time of the attack, arc now mostly in their late 20s and have already com­p I e tcd prison terms ranging from six years to 11 1/2 years for the crime. shooting of black youths on the "I was a monster," Reyes said were used."

Not only was the lawsuit involving Lafayette Apartments a colossal misunderstanding, but it was also an avoidable one.

a lawsuit against Lafayette's landlord following the Sept. 6 Kickoff Classic party, stating that the apartment complex was a public nuisance. 
Students were then told by their landlord they could not, in fact, hold gatherings anywhere outside the apartmenlS, without prior pennission from the landlord. The police had been mistak­en. 
As students feared they would be assessed attorney's fees or be sued themselves, they maintained the conflicting rules con­fused them. The police said one thing. The landlord said anoth­er. And the students didn't know who to believe. 
If authority figures want people to respect rules, they must enforce them evenly and make sure they are known, rather than creating additional uncertainty for students. 
Students should be held to the same standards under the law as any other citizens. If they throw rowdy parties and in effect invite police action, they must deal with the consequences of their actions.

as any other South Bend residents. They should be treated with the same dignity as any other apartment tenants. 
And that means the police and their landlords owe them the respect to communicate with one another, to coordinate what they tell students and to cooperate with each other's rules and 
regulations. 
If they expect students to obey the law and com­

what is permissible under each, especially since some behavior is legal but not allowed according to the terms ofthe leases. 
Police, tenants and landlords have now begun to work togeth­er to solve this problem. This is a commendable step in the right direction. 
But this type of communication should have started long ago. Ifit had, the City of South Bend and Lafayette Apartments could have avoided the whole legal mess in the first place. 
ln the future, when students ask what type of behavior is per­missible on and around their property, they deserve a straight­forward, well-researched answer, not two or three contradicto­ry ones. 
Students need to know on whom to rely and who to trust when it comes to important legal matters. 
If students, police officers and tenants show each other mutu­al respect, communicate regularly and aim for a common understanding, they can avoid another mishap like the one at Lafayette. 
Turn to page 23 of Notre Dame's 1974 Dome yearbook. It shows a picture of two students looking out of separate windows in Dillon Hall. On the left is a student flashing the "peace" symbol typi­
cal of the Vietnam era, holding two fin­gers in the fonn of a "V." On the right, lurking in the shad­ow of the window screen and hard to see, is my friend Joe Schmitz. 


It was 30 years ago this month that Gary J. Caruso I, a senior, met the underclassman Joe. We quickly Capitol became friends Comments and stayed in touch for several years after graduation. But today, he is as ghostly as his image on page 23. We lost touch of each other, and for almost 20 years now we have had no contact. 
Many years ago, I. sent Joe a Christmas card containing a three-page note. It was returned with the addressee unknown. Today it sits in a drawer wait­ing for another sending, but without a hope ofever being sent. Despite all of the Internet tracking technology and Notre Dame databases, Jo.e has been lost. 
That yearbook is one of a limited reminders I have of a good friendship during my senior year. 
I think back to the holiday decorations I had on my dormitory door during those long-lost days at Notre Dame. Twinkling lights, probably banned in the dorms today, surrounded an irreverent Santa with his slightly impaired reindeer, each of which held various alcohol and drug paraphernalia. Today I feel like Scrooge peering with the Ghost of Christmas Past at his boyhood campus. 
All ofus have pictures of yesterday's Christmas eras. My family has boxes full ofWorld War II era photographs featur ing most of my deceased relatives. I wonder if those days were as warm as the memories the photographs instill in me today. They give me an incentive to appreciate this holiday season as it unfolds so my digital photographs will mean more in years to come. 
This season is like the calm before the storm, both politically and economically. We have a president intent upon waging war with Iraq regardless of the findings of United Nations' inspectors. With it will come casualties both American and oth­erwise. How many of those who are nearing the end of their lives on earth are exerting a special effort to appreci­ate the events of this month? 
Throughout the world, families are preparing to celebrate this holiday sea­son. For some, they will lose a loved one before they can celebrate together. For others, this will be the last holiday they will celebrate with their families. Are any ofthem making a personal effort to celebrate as though it was their last? 
It is easy for us to ignore global politics while focusing on our personal lives. It is easy for us to limit our sights on what immediately affects us without consider­ing how delightful that experience may be in rel.ation to others. It is difficult for us to separate each day and live it with such zeal that it seems longer than a mere 24 hours. 
Ironically, we focus on tragedy and unpleasant experiences. Tomorrow we commemorate the 61st anniversary of a day that lived in infamy at Pearl Harbor. Unless that day is a birthday or wedding anniversary, it remains a negative blot on our calendars. 
This writer has no magic formula for appreciating life other than to be aware of the moment as it unfolds. Having lost my father two years ago, I can look back and appreciate various moments we shared together. In hindsight, I would have savored those moments more intensely as they occurred rather than just to have "attended" those times. And while today I still have such incredible memories of those experiences, I have Jeamed to intensify my personal atten­dance in my contemporary life. 
In the spirit of the holiday season from brown-tinged photographs of the Civil War. black and white photographs of soldiers during World War II or colored photographs of Notre Dame in 197 4, we make our existence meaningful through our appreciation of events as they unfold throughout our lives. Make this month as meaningful as it unfolds. Someday, it may only be a blurred image in next spring's yearbook.

applaud the University of Iowa for their terrific football season. I feel. however, that Mr. Leach has chosen the wrong target in his effort to ensure that Iowa plays in a major BCS bowl. 
The first target that Mr. Leach misses is the Bowl Championship Series itself. The premise of Mr. Leach's article is that the best college football teams should play in the major BCS bowls. That is arguably a fine idea, but it is not the system that the con­ferences and Notre Dame established. The system could have sent the top eight ranked teams in the BCS standings to the major bowl games, but instead decided to have automatic bids for conference champs and at-large bids left largely to the discretion of the individual bowl games. 
Perhaps Mr. Leach should be writing to the Florida State school paper, and imploring a four-loss Seminole team to decline their automatic bowl bid. No matter how the at­large bids are distributed, Florida State will be the least deserving team in a major BCS bowl. 
The second target that Mr. Leach misses is the Big Ten. The Big Ten conference has an automatic berth in a major BCS bowl. Iowa

would have two losses and would not go to a major BCS bowl. 
Mr. Leach also fails to note that Notre Dame played one of the hard­est schedules in the country, playing five teams ranked in the top 25, to Iowa's two. He also fails to mention 
that the Big Ten is cur­rently trying to bribe the Orange Bowl into selecting Iowa. Were Notre Dame to engage in such behavior, I am sure 
Iowa fans would be the first to criticize. Iowa had a very good football 
season. If they don't end up in a major BCS bowl, it will be because of 
the system their conference agreed to, and because of their conference's poor sched­uling. Notre Dame is responsible for neither, and should accept an invitation to a major BCS bowl if it is offered.

Racism is a social problem 
We wish to quickly respond to the Dec. 4 letters written by Barry Baumbaugh and Andrew Henrick. Both express typically closed-minded white responses to racism fostered within a cul­ture still seething with an undercurrent of white supremacy. 
As to Baumbaugh's argument that we should define racism strictly according to the dictionary, we ask if Baurnbaugh (associ­ated with the Physics Department) would accept that physics terms can adequately be defined by Webster's. If so, we do not need a physics department at all, we only need the good book of Webster's. Race and racism affect our daily lives just as docs physics. and so the process of continual study and redefinition of the terms of racism is no less justified. 
In Henrick's column, we see an appeal to a Webster's dictio­nary definition from 1936. Effectively, this is a definition of racism that was written by white men back when the denial of restaurant service to blacks was considered a white man's moral duty in parts of this country. We argue that such definitions are questionable based on the context in which the were developed. 
Also, Henrick asks why we view only societies as racist. We do not; we also acknowledge that individuals functioning within and supporting the racist social structures are racists. Racism is defined as participation within that racist social structure, a structure designed to consolidate power for only one race. Therefore. while non-white people can discriminate based on race, when they do so, they do not participate in the racist social structure and are, therefore, not acting racist. This, however, is not to say that racial discrimination is ever permissible. 
We thank both men for speaking up and presenting their feel­ings. Yet, we ask that they and other people (white and non­white) viewing race through archaic status quo analyses might take some time to think about these new. more complete defini­tions of racism.

Reconsidering issues about Church scandals 
I agree with Robert Davidson's Dec. 2 letter that stated that homosexuals should not be blamed for the Church scandals. [ also agree with him that our bishops have failed to act as true shepherds and have been complicit in grave evil. 
That being said, I found his letter a bit troubling for a number of reasons. First. we can agree that homosexuals are not to blame for the current crisis in the Church, without disregarding the facts as they exist on the ground. 
As a descriptive matter, the sexual abuse involved in the current scandals has been predominantly homosexual. The victims have been largely young teenage males. Whether this indicates that homosexuals are more apt to abuse is a different question. Nevertheless. we should not allow a false notion of tolerance to cloud our vision to the actual facts as they stand. The abuse involved in this crisis has been primarily homosexual. 
Second, though his words indicate differently, to be charitable to a young man studying to serve our Church as a priest. l assume that Davidson takes seriously the Church's teaching on sex­uality and homosexuality in particular. Those who experience same-sex attraction are experiencing desires which are objectively disordered. That is, they desire something which is by its very nature disintegrative. If the Church's teaching is true, which Davidson and I believe it to be, then such desires might make one more apt to engage in disintegrative behavior called to holiness, a realization that including the abuse at issue in the cur­Christ reveals to us our true path rent crisis. which is radical service to God and 
Third, it is true that if the Church others. and a deepening sense of had been more faithful to her Christ's presence in everyday life. teachings, this scandal would ----Our bishops have failed to 
not be gripping the Church. But Davidson's analysis seems to be way off the mark. He cites Vatican II's push for decentraliza­tion. Though such a push might be found in the pages of the National Catholic Reporter and the writings of Father McBrien, it is unclear where the impetus for such structural reform is in the actual documents of that Council. 

Pope John Paul II, inci­dentally a father of the Council, has been offering an authoritative interpretation of Vatican II for these last 24 years. That inter­pretation is one that promotes a radi­cal service to the truth and the laity on the pa.rt of the priesthood and the epis­copacy. a flowering of lay movements, an understanding that every Catholic is 
remain faithful to that authentic vision. By acting as corporate CEOs protecting their turf and fail­ing to act as fathers. they 
have truly failed Christ and us all. 
Our priests have commit­ted grave sin and failed to live their sex­
uality as a pos­itive gift to the Church. The human carnage left in the wake of 
these failings is almost unbearable. But, note that none of 
this has to do with failing to decentralize or to give up 
"power.fl It has everything to do with a failure to realize that authority is not synonymous with authoritarian or power but rather with radical ser­vice. 
Fourth, Davidson makes bald asser­tions with absolutely no backing. Banning homosexuals from the priest­hood will lead to more repressive semi­naries according to his argument. Repressive seminaries caused the pre­sent crisis. Here Davidson falls into the quick and pat assumptions for which he criticizes Mr. Sanchez. I have a feel­ing that the current roots of the scan­dal are much more complex than either of these quick answers. 
Finally, it is a valid theological ques­tion. to ask whether self-identifying homosexuals can be priests. Here one must differentiate between those who identify as homosexual and those who experience same-sex attraction. If one cannot see oneself or understand one­self as spouse and father, it might well be impossible to be a priest. For that is truly what a priest is: a spouse to the Church and a father to his flock. 
Can homosexuals see themselves as married to the Church and as fathers? I do not know. But we need to ask these and many more questions if we are to get the real roots of the crisis. The facile answers to which Mr. Davidson rushes certainly make for good, bombastic prose. They do not, however, lead us any further toward getting to the roots of the crisis and to finding a solution to It -a solution which will only come from being open to the truth and letting him lead us wherever he desires.

Hidden deep within the bowels of DeBartolo Hall, the majesty of Shakespeare's "Hamlet" electrified the too often stagnant air of an often under-occupied classroom as the Not-So-Royal Shakespeare Company brought the 400 year-old text to life Thursday night. With a collection of some of the most talented actors the University has to offer, the NSRSC expertly tackled one of Shakespeare's most complicated plays. 
When young Prince Hamlet (third-year law student Matt Holmes) returns home to Denmark upon news of his father's untimely death, he finds 
that his uncle, Claudius (senior Dan Fisher), has taken the throne and married his mother, Gertrude Gun­ior Katy Kertez). 
But it soon becomes clear that 

there is more than meets the eye to the king's death. Hamlet is visited The Not-S by the ghost of his father (freshman

I Gunior Meg Ryan), whose brother, Laertes (Adel Hanash), vows to make Hamlet pay at any cost in turn. The situa­tion quickly spirals out of control, fatalistically marching 
toward one of the bloodiest and tragic finales in Western literature. 
"Hamlet" is considered by many to be Shakespeare's most difficult and most beautiful play. Some have con­tended that the show is, in fact, the single best play in the Western tradition. The Not-So-Royal cast and director senior JJ Marler immediately realized the enormity of producing the show. 
"The expectations when people come to see 'Hamlet' arc so high that you have to know that you are going to get a great cast and great group of people to work around you," Marler said. 
And Marler got exactly what he wanted. About half of the cast mflmbers are long-time veterans or the NSRSC, all having worked on three or four of the Company's pre­vious shows. The other half of the cast making their debuts with the NSRSC had a strong foundation to build on. The cast also had a protracted rehearsal period of three and a half' months to prepare the show. 
"lThe cast] started to gel right away because they've been on stage many times together ... Some cast mem bers started showing real chemistry on day one," Marlor said. 
The cast's hard work pays off in spades. Holmes capti­vates the audience with his portrayal of Hamlet, tapping into the deepest recesses of the character's turbulent thoughts to create one of the most amazing showcases of acting skill in a dramatic production at the University in 
recent memory. He plays the role with passion and truth, embodying a Hamlet that is both tortured and pure. Ile dominates the

Byron Dafoe's return to Boston wasn't any better than his departure. 
Dafoe made 36 saves and held Boston scoreless for two periods but Glen Murray scored his 16th goal of the season at 1:53 of overtime to lift the Bruins to a 4-3 victory over the Atlanta Thrashers. 
Dafoe (2-2-0) made his first start against the Bruins since signing with Atlanta on Nov. 20. It was his second career start against Boston. 
"It was kind of weird, but it was good to get it over with," Dafoe said. "This was the one game I had to be leery of, I'm glad it's over." 
The Bruins had their eight­game home-unbeaten streak snapped Monday in a 4-0 lost to St. Louis, but they returned to the win column when Murray scored his second goal of the game. The power-play tally came after a tripping penalty to Mike Weaver behind the Atlanta goal. 
"This club is still learning how to play together," Murray said. "We have to learn more about playing with a lead." 
Dafoe was 132-104-34 with a 
2.29 goals-against-average and 25 shutouts in 283 games over five seasons with Boston. But, after going 35-26-3 with the Bruins last season, he became an unrestricted free agent and was not offered a contract by Boston. 

"Byron looked good to me," Bruins coach Robbie Ftorek said. 'Tm sure he will be back in form by Christmas." 
Flyers 3, Rangers 2 
Michal Handzus became the second player in NHL history to score an overtime goal on a penalty shot when he beat New York's Dan Blackburn with 36.7 seconds left in overtime in the Philadelphia Flyers' victory over the Rangers. 
Handzus, who was taken down from behind by defense­man Tom Poti, faked a forehand shot, then went to his backhand before lifting a shot over Blackburn's left pad.

Saddam's son torturing athletes 
. Group says Iraq's Olympic athletes are being tortured 
Associated Press 
GENEVA 

A human rights group formal­ly demanded that the IOC expel Iraq's national Olympic commit­tee claiming its chief -Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's eldest son Uday -tortured and jailed athletes who failed to please him. 
Indict. based in London, said it had lodged a complaint against the Iraqi body with the Ethics Commission of the International Olympic Committee. It said it had includ­cd witness statements and United Nations reports. 
"Iraq has violated every single provision of the IOC Code of Ethics," said Charles Forrest. chief executive of Indict. "The IOC should have investigated this on its own. Now 1 hope it will be forced to." 
IOC officials said they were aware of the complaint but were unable immediately to comment because they had yet to receive the document. 
Indict said Uday once made a group of track athletes crawl on newly poured asphalt while they were beaten, and ordered that some be thrown off a bridge. It also alleged he ran a special prison for sportsmen who offended him. 
"The Iraqi committee is the only Olympic committee in the world with its own prison and torture chamber," said Ann Clwyd, a British lawmaker who is fndict's chairwoman. "To allow (it) to participate in the Olympic movement is to mock all of the Olympics' high princi­ples." 
The Iraqi committee also par­ticipated in the looting of Kuwait during Saddam's 1990­1991 occupation of that country and continues to run front com­panies that are used to duck 
U.N. sanctions, Indict claimed. 
Indict was set up in 1997 to try to get Saddam and leading members of his regime brought before an international tribunal on charges of crimes against humanity. 
Forrest said Indict had com­bined testimony from exiled for­mer Iraqi sportsmen, evidence from United Nations human rights investigators and media reports to build its case to the IOC. 
Indict had had difficulty col­lecting evidence from former athletes because they often were living as refugees in the West and wanted to avoid pub­licity because they were afraid family members who still live in Iraq would be harmed, Forrest said. 
He said the IOC should look again at how it tackles viola­tions of Olympic ethics by the national committees. 
"The ethical standards the 
code establishes are not equipped to deal with things like torture or running a prison," he said. 
IOC officials noted the organi­zation previously suspended Afghanistan's national commit­tee because the country's for­mer Taliban regime barred women from sports. 
Iraq was investigated in 1997 by the international soccer gov­erning body, FIFA, after allega­tions members of the Iraqi national squad were tortured because they lost a key match. 
FIFA spokesman Andreas Herren said two officials were sent to Iraq, where they inter­viewed members of the Iraqi Football Association. Twelve players also were interviewed and physically examined. 
"They weren't able to find any evidence or any witness to con­firm those allegations," Herren said. 
But, he added, "We were quite conscious of the fact that our investigative resources were very limited. We are a non-governmental organization and there are limits to what we could achieve." 
But Clwyd said the FIFA inquiry was a "disgraceful whitewash." 
"You can't expect athletes interviewed in Iraq to commit suicide by telling the truth. The IOC must deal with these allega­tions of torture and corruption in a much more serious man­ner," she said. 
NFL 
Davis being phased out from Redskins 
, l 
Associated P rcss 
ASHBURN, Va. 
There's not much a player can say when it appears the team is phasing him out. Accepting it seems wrong. Complaining about it seems wrong. 
So Stephen Davis shrugged. 
"What am I going to say? What can I say?" the Washington Redskins running back said Wednesday. He didn't speak in an impolite or angry manner. In fact, he looked at reporters and added: "Nothing against y'all. Trust me. Nothing against y'all." 
Davis is Washington's No. 3 career rushing leader and the first player in franchise history to run for 1,000-plus yards three years in a row. He's not flashy, but he has excellent vision and the reputation for turning a 3-yard gain into a 6­yard gain. 
But now he's playing for coach Steve Spurrier, who would rather pass the ball, even though the Redskins don't have the quarterbacks to run a pass-oriented offense. 
Though he's tried to bolster his case with comments such as "this offense has to go through me," Davis has just 726 yards on 193 carries. He's on pace to get fewer than 1,300 yards and fewer than 290 carries for the first time since 1998. 
Then, this week, Spurrier dropped the latest Davis bomb shell: Second-round draft pick Ladell Betts will get plenty of playing time over the final four games as the Redskins (5-7) wind down the season. 
"Stephen has carried it a whole bunch this year," Spurrier said. "And if we are going to look to these younger guys, maybe there is a time to do it in the next four games." 
The Redskins will have to deal with Davis after the sea­son because he is scheduled to count an unwieldy $11.4 mil­lion against the salary cap in 2003. Either a new contract has to be negotiated, or Davis will have to be cut. 
So far. there have been no negotiations. 
The soft-spoken Davis isn't the transient type, and he's said he would like to remain in Washington. But he's taken shots at Spurrier's play-calling. including a not-so-subtle "their game plan was better than ours" after the Thanksgiving loss at Dallas. 
Spurrier has waffled in response. He's said, at times, that he needs to run Davis more, and other times he's indicated he'll keep throwing because the run has been just as ineffective.

Expos superstars might be on the trading block 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 
Bartolo Colon. Javier Vazquez and Vladimir Guerrero might be available for the right price. 
The Montreal Expos have concluded they will have to shed some payroll in 2003 to keep to the budget given them by the commissioner's office. 
Expos general manager Omar Minaya began calling other GMs, telling them to think about proposals to bring to the winter meetings, which start Dec. 13 in Nashville, Tenn. 
Montreal president Tony Tavares said the team had begun talking about possible trades and about extensions with the agents for Guerrero and Colon, both eligible for free agency after the 2003 sea­son. 
"Omar is looking at the land­scape right now to see what's out there," Tavares said. "You have to look at what all the alternatives are." 

Montreal, sold by Jeffrey Loria to the other 29 teams last winter, is operated by the com­missioner's office, which is exploring a possible sale before the 2004 season. The Expos had a $38 million payroll last season, and keeping the same group together probably would result in a $50 million payroll next year, the team estimates. 
"We probably can't take on 50," Tavares said, "but that doesn't mean we can't be cre­ative about getting additional revenue and reducing expens­es." 
Guerrero's salary goes from $8 million in 2002 to $11.5 million next year, Colon's salary jumps from $4.8 million to $8.25 million and scc-ond baseman Jose Vidro's increas­es from $4 million to $5.5 mil­lion. Vazquez, who made $4,775,000, is eligible for salary arbitration. 
Montreal, whose attendance is among the lowest in the major leagues, figures it will increase revenue by shifting 22 home games from Olympic Stadium to San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
"You've seen a lot of creative deals out there," Tavares said. "We're looking to do that out of necessity, not out of choice. This year we're revenue chal­lenged, but we can take on more in the future." 
Minaya declined comment, and commissioner Bud Selig didn't return a telephone call seeking comment. 
"We don't know exactly which way this Rubik's cube is going to spin," Tavares said.

Monday Night Football creator found dead 
Associated Puss 
NEW YORK 

Hoone Arledge. a pioneering television executive at ABC News and Sports responsible for creating shows from M()nday Night Football to Nightline, died Thursday. He was 71. 
Arledge died at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. spokesman Jeffrey Schneider said. The cause of death was complications from cancer, ABC News reported. 
"Hoone changed the face of television sports coverage with Wide World of Sports in the early 1960s and the production of the Olympic games," said longtime broadcaster Jim McKay. 
Although he retired in 1998, Arledge ·s far-reaching influ­ence can still be seen on TV: when a slow-motion replay is shown at a sporting event. when Peter Jennings reads the news or when a sportscaster criticizes a player. 
Arledge was single-handedly credited with bringing modern production techniques to sports coverage, then building ABC News into a power during the 1980s. For a decade, he was president of the sports and news divisions at ABC. 
The 36-time Emmy winner was cited as one of the 100 most important Americans of the 20th century by Life maga­zine in 1990. 
"Roane Arledge revolution­ized television and with it the way people see and understand the world," ABC News President David Westin said in a statement. "He was our leader and our friend, and we will miss his passion and his will to make us all better than we were." 
Roone Pinckney Arledge was born July 8. 1931, and reared on Long Island. The Columbia College graduate joined ABC Sports as a producer in 1960 after a five-year stint at NBC. 
Appealing to his bosses to bring showbiz to sports, the 29­year-old was given control of ABC's NCAA football broad­casts. Through the 1960s, he introduced innovations taken for granted today: slow-motion and freeze-frame views, instant replays, hand-held cameras and the placement of microphones to bring the sound of the game into living rooms. 
In addition to all the techni­cal innovations. McKay said Arledge would also be remem­bered for "putting the focus on the human being involved in sports." 
In 1961, Arledge created "ABC's Wide World of Sports," one of the most popular sports series ever, and coined its tag line -"the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat." 
Arledge, who became presi­dent of ABC Sports in 1968, supervised coverage of 10 Olympics from 1964 to 1988,

Nevin wouldn't waive clause for Griffey trade 
Associated Prcss 

SAN DIEGO 
The Cincinnati Reds and San Diego Padres agreed to trade Ken Griffey Jr. for Phil Nevin last weekend but the deal died when Nevin wouldn't waive his no-trade clause. 
Nevin said that he told Padres general manager Kevin Towers that he wants to stay in San Diego, where he resur­rected his career in 1999 after arriving as a backup catcher in a spring training trade with Anaheim. 
"I let them know that's where I want to be," Nevin said by cell phone from Las Vegas, where he was golfing with Padres manager Bruce Bochy, "I just don't really want to talk about it, honestly. I'm staying in San Diego and wc'JJ just take it from there. Those are things that are sup­posed to be left between the teams." 
Towers said he had no com­ment. 
A baseball source familiar with the proposed deal, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the teams agreed to the swap over the Thanksgiving weekend. 
Griffey has been bothered by injuries the past two seasons after orchestrating a trade to Cincinnati in 2000. 
He tore a tendon in his knee during the first week, setting up another season limited by leg injuries. He also pulled a hamstring and strained hip muscles, limiting him to 70 games. a .264 average, eight homers and 23 RBIs. 
Nevin·s agent, Barry Axelrod, wondered why the Padres would even discuss a Nevin trade in the first place. 
"There never could have been a deal, at least from our point of view," Axelrod said. 
The Padres included a no­trade clause in the $34.5 mil­lion, fuur-year contract exten­sion Nevin signed in November 2001. That extension kicks in with the 2003 season. 
But with Nevin again vacat­ing third base in favor of Sean Burroughs. he's apparently become the target of trade talks. Nevin is expected to play right field. 
Last spring, Nevin moved from third to first, and first baseman Ryan Klesko moved to right field so the rookie Burroughs could play third. 
That experiment failed, though. Burroughs struggled because of a shoulder injury, was benched. went on the dis­abled list in late May and then spent 1 1/2 months at Class AAA Portland. 
Nevin moved back to third base after Burroughs was benched, but broke his left arm diving for a ball two days later. He had a frustrating season, capped when he made an obscene gesture to a heck­ling fan late in late September, angering Towers and Bochy. 
Axelrod said Towers asked 
him before the recent general 
managers meetings whether 
Nevin. an All-Star in 2001, 
would ever waive the no-trade 
clause. 
Nevin and his wife have a 
new home in the San Diego 
area and he has a a daughter 
from a prior relationship who 
lives in the area, Axelrod said. 
The only way he would consid­
er agreeing to a trade is if it 
were to a West Coast team 
that has spring training in 
Arizona and that he'd play 
third base. 
"Clearly, Cincinnati would 
not be one of those," Axelrod 
said. 
Nevin was the top pick over­
all in the June 1992 draft, by 
Houston, but developed a rep­
utation as a hothead and 
bounced around the majors 
until settling in with the 
Padres. He became their start­
ing third baseman in August 
199'l.

A search of' the vehicle turned up a small amount of marijuana, police said. Misdemeanor possession is punishable with a fine of up to $1,000 and up to three months in jail. 
Afterward, Stoudamire and Wallace appeared in a brief news conference, where they apologized for the incident. 
Stoudamire's plea comes the same week that prosecutors in Oregon's Washington County decided not to pursue felony domestic abuse charges against Blazers' forward Ruben Patterson. 
Patterson's wife Shannon called police to their home on Nov. 25 alleging she had been assaulted by her husband. Patterson was taken into cus­tody and later released on bail posted by a teammate. 
On Monday. Shannon Patterson went to Washington County prosecutors and said she did not wish the prosecu­tion to proceed with the case. District Attorney Bob Hermann announced a day later that Patterson would not face formal charges because of a lack of evidence. 
The Trail Blazers could take their own disciplinary action against Patterson. 
"We're still gathering infor­mation, sorting through what the options are, and when we come to a decision, we'll cer­tainly tell you," team general manager Bob Whitsitt said. 
Patterson apologized to Blazers' fans in his first public comments, made before Portland was routed 103-88 by the Dallas Mavericks Wednesday night. 
"It's a family matter, and I'm going to take care of it and move on," Patterson said. "Everybody knows I'm not a bad person."

NCAA FOOTBALL 

Franchione accepts Texas A&M position 
A..,odated Press 

COLLEGE STATION, Texas 
Dennis Franchionc left Alabama after only two sea­sons to take over as the new coach at Texas A&M. 
Erle Nye, chairman of the Texas A&M board of regents, confirmed Franchione had agreed to a deal with the Aggies. 
Franchione leaves Alabama less than a year after the school was hit this year with harsh NCAA sanctions. He replaces R.C. Slocum, who was fired Monday after the Aggies' 50-20 loss to Texas closed out a 6-6 season. 
Texas A&M scheduled a news conference for 9:30 a.m. EST Friday to announce the hiring. 
The 51-year-old Franchione and new Aggies athletic direc­tor Bill Byrne landed in a pri­vate jet at A&M on Thursday afternoon and strolled down a crimson carpet that had the Aggies' logo on it. 
Franchione brushed past reporters. saying, 'TH talk to all of you tomorrow." 
Byrne also declined to answer questions. 
Franchione -25-11 at TCU from 1998-2000 and 17-8 in two years at Alabama -had been noncommittal on his plans in recent weeks. 
He dismissed reports in Texas newspapers that he would be the Aggies' new coach and called one "idiotic." He said he had "never wavered" on his intentions to return to Alabama next sea­son but never promised he would stay. 
"The first week they brought it up, he was just like, 'Don't worry about it. Just focus on the game,"' Alabama center Alonzo Ephraim said. ''.That's just his personal life. I don't think it will hurt our pro­gram.'' 
Mike McKenzie, who edits Franchione's Web site, said Thursday that Franchione told him he planned to have the position coaches notify the Crimson Tide players and he wouldn't return to meet the team. 
Franchione's deal caps a tumultuous week at A&M. beginning with Slocum's firing and the hiring of Byrne on Tuesday. 
Nye said the school and Franchione had agreed to many terms of a contract, including duration and salary. 
The A&M board of regents has proposed a five-year con­tract for Franchione to take over the Aggies' football pro­gram, the Houston Chronicle reported. The offer to Franchione was believed to be worth $10 million to $11 mil­lion. 
Despite a 10-3 record this season, Alabama isn't eligible for a bowl game because it is on NCAA probation due to recruiting violations that took place before Franchione was hired. 
Franchione met for about three hours Wednesday with Alabama athletic director Mal Moore and members of the Alabama board of trustees, then left without commenting. 
Franchione canceled speak­ing engagements Wednesday night in Columbus, Ga., and on Thursday in Montgomery, Ala. 
Moore said he granted A&M officials permission to talk to Franchione but wanted the coach to stay with the Crimson Tide. 
PGA TOUR 

Furyk's 'boring' 64 takes lead 
Associated Press 

THOUSAND OAKS. Calif. 
Jim Furyk had a boring round compared to Tiger Woods and Davis Love III, which was fine by him in the Target World Challenge. 
While both Woods and Love went eight consecutive holes without a par, Furyk picked his spots at Sherwood Country Club and avoided costly mis­takes on his way to an 8-under 64 to take a one-stroke lead. 
Nick Price and Padraig Harrington were at 65 after playing without a bogey. which was the best way to move up the leaderboard ­and stay there -on a perfect day for scoring. 
"You can make a bunch of birdies, but it's also a course where vou can make a bunch of mistakes," Furyk said. "If you can eliminate those bad holes, which is difficult, you can shoot a really low round." 
That's what stopped Woods 
(68) and Love (66). 

Woods, the tournament host and defending champion of the $3.8 million exhibition, reached the 15th hole and looked over at a large score­board; 
"You have to shoot 10 under just to keep up," he said under his breath. 
Instead, he was running in place, answering every birdie with a bogey, and vice versa. 
After a par on the opening hole, Woods didn't make another par until he missed a 5-foot birdie putt on the 10th. 
He really got it going in the middle of his front nine with four straight birdies that pulled him within two strokes of the lead, then hit into the hazard off the ninth tee and had to get up-and-down for a bogey. 
"They were absolutely per­fect conditions. Just look at the board,'' Woods said, noting that only four players in the 16-man field failed to shoot par or better. "You just knew you had to take it low today." 
The good news? "I didn't shoot myself out of the tournament," he said. 
Neither did Love, who had the most entertaining round of them all with nine birdies and an eagle. His problem was Love had only four pars. 
Good day or bad day? 
"I like making that many birdies," Love said. "If you miss it any place on this golf course, JOU can make a big number. 
His biggest came at the par­3 15th, when his ball came up just short in a mixture of grass and rocks. Love had a decent lie. but was worried about hit­ting the rocks with his club and wound up advancing the ball only a few inches. He wound up with a double bogey. 
"I should have gotten it out," he said. "I just chickened out of the shot." 
It's hard to blame a guy for not wanting to get injured, not in a tournament that pays $1 million to the winner and $130,000 for last place. And not with the start of the 2003 PGA Tour season -the money that counts -only a month away. 
The other secret to low scor­ing was lack of sleep. Furyk, Price and Harrington -the top three guys on the 
Jeaderboard -were all in South Africa last week for the Nedbank Challenge. 
"I knocked some of the rust off," Furyk said. 
He played with Chris DiMarco, who knocked the ball all over Sherwood -eight birdies to go with a bogey and a double bogey that put him at 67 with David Toms and Retief Goosen. 
Phil Mickelson played the par 5s even par -two bogeys and an eagle when he hit a 6­iron for his second shot on the 522-yard 11th hole. Ile was at 68, and gets to play with Woods on Friday. 
After going 18 months with­out playing together, this will be the fifth time in their last eight rounds that Woods and Mickelson ~ Nos. 1 and 2 in the world -get to spend qual­ity time inside the ropes. 
That means more cameras, which isn't good news fur Woods. 
On Sunday in the Skins Game, a man without media credentials clicked a camera during Woods' swing out of a bunker on the final hole with $200,000 on the line. Caddie Steve Williams removed the camera and dropped it into a lake. 
On Thursday, a photograph­er clicked as Woods stood over a 6-foot eagle putt. He paused but didn't yell, and missed the putt. 
"It was early enough that I was OK," he said. "I just mis­read it." 
Williams didn't heave the camera into the Sherwood for­est, he simply asked the pho­tographer in a strong voice not to do it again.

If the Irish win, they will play the winner of the other first round contest between Michigan State and George Mason (22-7) at 4 p.m. on Sunday. Last year, the Spartans (19-11) eliminated the Irish in East Lansing, Mich. in the first round of the NCM Tournament. 
With less than 24 hours between matches, Brown and her staff are ready to play either opponent should the Irish beat the Cougars.

Belles have high hopes for home tourney 
By HFATHER VAN HOEGARDEN 
Sports Writer 
This weekend will be a true lest for the Saint Mary's bas­ketball team as the Belles host the Saint Mary's Roundball Classic. 
Joining Saint Mary's in the tournament arc the University of Chicago (l-3), 2002 Division Ill NCAA Tournament qualifier Savannah College of Art and Design and Rose-Hulman (1­
4). 

The Belles started the sea­son off strong, despite losing their first two games to Franklin College (63-86), and 
Hanover  (67-81),  at  the  
Franklin  College  Tip  Off  
Tourney.  

The Belles picked up their first victory of the season at home on Nov. 26, with their 67-42 victory over Manchester College. They enter this week­end's tournament on a positive note, as they hope to expand on their first home win. 
Despite the mixed results, ath­letic director Gregg Petcoff feels the team is meshing very well. 
"This team is playing very well thus far, despite the two losses.ff Pctcoff said. "When the subs go in, they don't miss a beat. Our expectations are rising, as we continue to win more games each year." 
Looking to build on their upset of Kalamazoo in their final game last season, the team is still adjusting from the loss of last year's seniors as

well as one player studying abroad this semester. 
With only ten girls on the team, coach Suzanne Bellina knows each player needs to play well for the Belles to be successful. 
"We are an extremely bal­anced team. Top to bottom, we are very strong," Bellina said. "This year's seniors want to go out on a high note, and the young players want to turn the program around, beginning with this year."

continued from page 28 
over two years ago, Miller remained in close contact with his former school. He still has old Maryland athletic gear boxed up in his house at home along with his Final Four ring. However, he is missing the national championship ring the Terrapins won last year without Miller's help. 
Needless to say, Saturday is a game he's been waiting to play for a long time. 
"It's a game I've had circled for a while," Miller said. "But I can't get too excited about it, I can't get to high about it. I have to go out and prepare for it like any other game." 
Easy for him to say. Even without the emotional connec­tion, the defending 

and experi­
enced. 

But that was part of the rea­son Miller left in the first place. 
A McDonald's All-American coming out of high school. Miller barely received the chance to star with the Terrapins. His best season came his sophomore year, when he earned the team's "Unsung Hero" award after starting all 34 games. 
But the next year, he aver­aged 18 minutes a game and 
4.8 points a game as Maryland's other stars led the team to its first-ever Final Four. Feeling uncomfortable, Miller decided to switch schools. 
He didn't have to look very far. Greg Miller, Dan's older brother, played at Delaware under Brey, and Miller was well acquainted with Brey's coaching style. Plus, the chance to earn a Notre Dame degree helped convince the 6­foot-8 forward to don an Irish 
, uniform. 

· "It was definitely difficult," 
1 Miller said. "I was leaving behind my teammates and friends to enter a new situa­tion. But my teammates and coaches at Notre Dame helped me along, and it was a great transition for me." 
Brey normally doesn't like accepting transfer players who can play for only one year. But the Irish coach looked down the road and saw the Irish would be both thin and inexperienced after David Graves, Ryan Humphrey and Harold Swanagan graduated.

Bringing Miller in, even if it was just for one year, would help give the youthful Irish stability and leadership. 
"Chemistry wise, you have to make sure it's a fit," Brey said. " ... But Dan has the respect of his teammates in practice, he earned it in prac­tice last year, and he's a big asset with our young players." 
Although the NCAA required him to sit out last season, Miller spent the season improving himself as a player and spending more time in the weight room. He challenged the rest of the players in prac­tice even as he prepared him­self to fill in for the Irish the next season. 
Even though the season is seven games young, Miller is already well on his way to becoming the impact player the Irish hoped he would be. His leader­ship has

his pres­
ence on the 

court gives the Irish tremendous matchup advantages. 
Come Saturday, the Irish will need Miller to continue his early-season play if they want to win. After playing Maryland on Saturday, the Irish will face either Texas or George Washington on Sunday. 
But for now, Maryland is in the spotlight. 
"'The focus is on Notre Dame and Maryland, not Dan Miller and Maryland," Brey said. "But he understands that and I want him to keep playing the way he's playing." 
Miller still keeps in contact with his former teammates. He speaks to guard Steve Blake, one of his best friends on the team, almost twice a week. In fact, Blake called Miller to congratulate him after the Irish knocked off No. 10 Marquette earlier this week. 
But come Saturday. any friendly feelings Miller has toward his old teammates will disappear even beforn he takes the court wearing a dif­ferent uniform and sits on a different bench. 
"We 're still good friends, there's no hard feelings or anything like that," Miller said. "But once the game begins, once its out on the court, we know we're out there to win. We're going to go hard at each other."

It will have to be a new Notre Dame team that takes the floor on Saturday.

"Everything," 
coach Muffet McGraw said. 

Arizona State is off to it.s best start in the last 10 years. The Sun Devils have been on fire, beginning with a 5-0 record, including an upset against No. 14 Georgia Monday. In addition, the Sun Devils are looking to add a 14th win to their record-set­ting home winning streak. 
The Irish don't look as hot. 
In its last two games, Notre Dame has not been executing effectively on offense. Although it's been shooting nearly 58 per­cent from the floor, the offense has not been as effective as McGraw would like. 
"We haven't executed in the. last two games," McGraw said. ''We've got a lot of work to do." 
Offensively, that work will have to focus around playing against a man-to-man defensive scheme. The Sun Devils defense, ranked first in the Pac-10 last season, has used its man-to-man scheme to shut down opposing offenses. The Sun Devils are giv­ing up an average of 62 points per game, more than 13 points less than their scoring average of75.8 points per game. 
But the good defense isn't what is most surprising about this young Arizona State University team. The Sun Devils are playing without two of their best players. Junior two-year starter Betsy Boardman left Arizona State University and sophomore forward Alexis Tate suffered a season-ending knee injury. Despite it.s losses, Arizona State is on fire offensively. 
Led by freshmen standouts Jill Noe, Kristen Kovesdy and Amy Denson, the Sun Devils are shooting 45 percent from the floor and 42 percent from behind the arc. That's a 
player and 
they've all stepped up," McGraw said. "So they're all contributing a little bit more than they did before." 
What may be more important is how the Sun Devils play offen­sively. Where the Irish have not executed as much as McGraw would like, the Sun Devils have run a patient, mistake-free offense. 
"Offensively, they don't make mistakes," McGraw said. "They don't beat themselves. They just kind of take their time." 
The Irish will have to focus to remove the mistakes from their game. Although they only had two days of practice to fix Wednesday's mistakes, McGraw is sure two days is enough. 
"It's a lot of mental stuff," McGraw said. "They just need to focus and get in their heads that they're going to get on their game." 
Tip-off is Saturday at noon. 
Note: 

Saturday's game is part of the AstraZeneca Hoops for the Cure Classic 11. Arizona State will be playing host to the second annu­al tournament that benefits breast cancer research, treat­ment and education with dona­tions going to the Susan G. Kornen Breast Cancer Foundation.

he never would have agreed. Had Brey known he was going to receive a senior transfer from Marvland, he never would have given a ver­bal commitment that pitted the Irish and the Terrapins against each other. Had Brey known Dan Miller would step on the same court Saturday wearing a different uniform than the players, he never would have said the Irish would play in the BB&T Classic. But Brey gave his word two 
years ago he would play in the tournament this weekend, six months before Miller trans­ferred from Maryland to Notre Dame. So Saturday at the MCI Center, Miller will be reunited with his former teammates on the court for the first time since he left the Terrapins. 
"Quite frankly, if we knew we were getting Dan Miller, we would never schedule this gam~." Brey said. "I don't think.overall it's a healthy sit­uation, but he's a fifth-year senior, he's in his niche out there, and I think he's excited to go back."
