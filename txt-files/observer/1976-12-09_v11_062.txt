Reservations for travel should be finalized soon 
by Mike Moses Staff Reporter 
Students desiring to travel by plane this holiday should already have their reservations made; and if not, they should make them as soon as _possible. Planes leaving South Bend and Chicago in Decem· ber are filling up rapidly at both United and North Central airlines. 
Return flights with United and North Central to South Bend and Chicago are heavily booked for Jan. 
17. the dav when most students will be returni.ng to Notre Dame and St. Mary's. There are only a few seats still available on certain flights that day. 
Some students traveling by plane this holiday have taken advantage of the ''freedom fares,'' a seven to 30 day excursion at 20 percent off the regular coach fare. A passen­ger on one of these round-trip flights must spend at least seven, but not more than 30 days (not including the day of initial depar­ture) at his chosen destination. However, for these flights, reserva­tions must be made and tickets bought at least 14 days in advance. 

Anyone going to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut or Massachu­setts this Christmas can take the Amtrak with other students at a reduced rate. 
Forms may be picked up in the Student Activities Office inLaFor­tune todav or tomorrow, or in the Senior Chiss Office in the basement of LaFortune. tomorrow between 2:30p.m. and Sp.m. Money should be deposited at that time. After tomorrow, anyone still wishing to take the Amtrak should call Bob Grant at 3183. 
The Amtrak will leave South Bend on Dec. 21 at S:OS p.m., arriving in New York City at 12:15 
p.m. Dec. 22. The return trip leaves New York at 6:15p.m., Jan. 
16. and arrives in South Bend at 
1:25 p.m.. Jan 17. 
Major stops (listed here with their round trip fares) include Buffalo ($40). Rochester ($44.50), Syracuse ($53), Albany ($65), and New York ($78). These prices represent a 25 "1o discount off the regular fare. 
According to Bob Grant, who organized the trip, there will be a party the night before departure from South Bend for all the people who are going on the trip. It will be held in Darby's Place on Dec. 20 at 9 p.m. 
In addition, Amtrak may possibly provide a group meal in the dining car. also at a reduced rate. So far, 110 students have signed up for the trip. 
T,Pe Pittsburgh Club is sponsor­ing a bus to and from Pittsburgh for the Christmas break. The roundtrip is $30 ($27 for members), and one way is $20 (for members and non-members alike). 

The bus leaves Notre Dame and St. Mary's on Dec. 21, at 1 p.m., and leaves Pittsburgh on Jan. 17 from the Greyhound Terminal, also at 1 p.m. Sign-ups are in room 2C of LaFortune this Sunday at 6:30 p.m. 
The Cleveland Club is also chartering a bus for the break. Round-trip fare is $20 ($23 for non-members); one way is $12 ($14 for non-members). The bus leaves Notre Dame and St. Mary's on Dec. 21 at 1 p.m. It leaves Cleveland on Jan. 17 from the Greyhound term­inal at 6 p.m., and from Exit 9 of the Ohio Turnpike at 6:30 p.m. Sign-ups are in the Grace Hall pit this Sunday from 6:30 p.m. to 7 p.m., and in the lobby of LeMans from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. For additional information, call Dave at 3805. Mike at 1694. or Debbie a[ 4-4729. 
The Student Union had sign-ups after Thanksgiving to test student ~nter~st in a bus to O'Hare Airport, tn Chtcago. Only 16 people signed up, however. This was little over half the number that would have been needed to charter a bus according to Greg Lang. assistan; services commissioner. Therefore the program was dropped.

Freshmen to be permitted to have cars on campus 
by Joe Gill Staff Reporter 
Freshmen will be allowed to 
bring cars back to campus for the 
second semester provided they 
have a 2.0 GPA, James Roemer, 
dean of students, said yesterday. 
Roemer cited the work of the 
Freshman Advisory Council under 
Chairman Kurt Hench as responsi­
ble for the change. 
Hench said there were two 
problems the council had to resolve 
before presenting the proposal. 
The first was ''whether or not the 
freshmen could handle it" and the 
second "if there was enough space 
available for the extra cars.'' 
In a letter to Bro. Just Paczesny, 
vice-president of student affairs. 
Hench noted that the "University 
policy which prohibits cars for the 
first semester is due to the tremen­
dous adjustment to college life," 
and suggested that "this adjust-
Fallout fashions hit market 
The latest apparel in nuclear fallout fashions is a synthetic fiber suit called NucleClean, designed and marketed by former nuclear engineer Marlin Ebert of Liver­more. California. 
Ebert said growing public con­cern over the hazards of nuclear radiation from weapons or nuclear power plants prompted him to design what he calls a ·'radiation hazard emergency personal anti­contamination kit." For $16.50 , it includes a respirator. a pair of overalls, gloves, boots, mask and special towels and detergent spon­ges for decontamination. 
"What people don't realize is that they can handle fallout. like many other forms of contamina­tion." Ebert comments. "It's a really super garment," he added, "and with the particle respirator it will keep you in good shape... 
He said the suit is made of 
DuPont Tyvek, a material with 
smaller "pores" than conventional 
clothing. Ebert stated he hopes to 
sell to the same people who buy 
emergency foodstuffs for their 
fallout shelters. Other potential 
customers included the armed for­
ces and the Defense Civil Prepar­
edness Agency.

The United States Army is inter­
viewing sophomores for future positions 
as Army officers. 

Applicants are required to participate 
in a six-week summer program at Fort 
Knox, Ky., to qualify for college ROTC 
courses next yPar. Pay for the six weeks

ment is completed by the begin­ning of the second semester.'' 
Secondly, Hench said the Uni­versity "could easily accomodate the increased number of cars" and cited similar changes in 1973-7 4 and 1974-75 that resulted in only 200 to 215 freshmen registering cars after the midsemester break. 
He also noted the problems that many freshmen had getting trans portation home due to the late scheduling of exams, when "their usual source of transportation may have already left." 
Paczesny commented that he "acted upon the proposals pre­sented by Dean Hofman and the freshmen'' in implementing this new policy.

SLC decay due to basic problems 
Last Tuesday was the second time in as two years ago. Bro. Just Paczesny confes­man:y meetings that the Student life ses that he feels initmidated by the Council failed to meet officially because it prescence of the Observer reporter, while lacked a quorum. Although all the student other members of the council claim they 
representatives and most of the admini­fell intimidated by the prescence of Br. 
strators showed up for both meetings, some faculty representatives did not. 
The SI..C attendance problem stems from a larger problem, a lack of interest on the part of its members. Since this SI..C's tenure began last scjlool year, the council has discussed little of significance and has done even less. Some major student life concerns such as the recent pensions due to parietals and drinking violations, or even the riot earlier this semester have gone completely unmentioned, while other matters such as tne WSND affair or Gassman's cable TV proposal were men­tioned only briefly and quickly passed over. They have spent most of their meeting time debating the purpose of their existence-and still do not know what it is. 
The SI.C was founded in 1967 as a forum for student, administration and faculty opinion on student life. Whether it actually possesses policy-making authority or merely exists as an advisory board to the administration and-or the Board of Trus­tees is unclear. What clear authority it has, however, is at least that which Br. Just and Dean Roemer admit it has: namely, an authoritative voice in the realm of rules and regulations goveming student life,· subject to Fr. Hesburgh's approval. If the SI..C would consider doing anything, it might consider work:.ng to clarify those standing rules and regulations, especially the parietals rule. 
The lack of concrete discussion, and the resulting lack of accomplishments, are the result, some claim, of the timidity ,,f some of its members. The SI..C may sllll feel intimidated by Hesburgh's veto fo their last attempt to clarify the sexuality rule Just. Bro. Just's proposed solution to the whole problem is to close the first half of SI..C meetins;!s to public access. 
Closing the SI..C is not the solution. The SI..C members are representatives of the university community. They should not be afraid to let the community know what they are doing (or not doing.) Closing the doors would create suspicion and perhaps even administrative dominance, as been the alleged weakness of the academic council. If the SI.C believes they need periods of off-the-record discussion in special situa­tions, they could use a brief executive session which are closed to the public. 
· The SI..C's decay has been reflected in how they have been treated by others. Fr. Burtchaell recently ignored the council when he set up the official  university evaluation of co-education. Also , al­though it may have been the result of poor planning or bad weather, students side­stepped the recent Sl.C-sponsored off­campus Tuwn Meeting. Aside from the media and student representatives, only one student attended the meeting, and he was only there to get a ride home from The Observer reporter. 
The Student life Council did an effective job in past years, and was a leader in improving student life here. The student representatives cannot be blamed for the attendance problem this year. They can, however, be partly blamed for its under­lying misdirection and inefficiency. If they would work to solve these basic problems, the attendance problem would solve itself. As it stands, t.he lack of direction has led to a lack of attendance. It has amounted to a lack of leadership.

Laundry and Cable TV 
The administration is considering two proposals 
recently presented by Notre Dame's student govern­
ment. One of them, the laundry proposal, is expected to 
be decided upon today by Bro. Just Paczesny 
Vice-President for Student Affairs. The second, SBP 
Mike Gassman's campus wide (and costly) cable TV 
proposal, will probably linger on the desks of the 
administrators a little longer. 
It is our hope that Bro. Just will announce the 
implementation of the laundry proposal in his 
up-coming statement. The proposal calls for the 
installment of washers and dryers for the use of 
on-campus male students. The new service will provide 
these students with an inexpensive alternative for 
doing excess laundry. Altbough it is difficult to 
determine whether the university will gain or lose 
money as ~ resut of the new service, it should accept it 
to try to keep student laundry costs at a minimum. 
Regarding Gassman's Cable TV proposal, and its 
awesome price tag of $500,000, the University should 
determine its final opinion on the basis of services vs. 
cost. The proposal has vast educational potential. This 
potential, coupled with Cable TV's recreational 
advantages would be far more valuable than $500,000. 
If the University _can find the money, the proposal 
should be given a go-ahead. 
Mike Gassman and his staff should be commended 
for the organization and professionalism they displayed 
researching and pressing these proposals. The admini­
stration should seriouslyconsider them and implement 
them if they are financialli feasible.

Men do not I ive on bread aJone 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii-anne blandford 
I wish tu reply brietly to 1\.k-;­sieurs Allen':·, and D'Aurora's re­marks supporting the Hunger Co­alition. 
Since you, Mr. Allen and Mr. D'Aurora, are "pragma' .r ideal­ists" and not pure idealists, I assume you can respond to prac­tical question about vour ideals. 
First, do you wish to eliminate starvation or malnutrition? The adage "Men do not live on bread alone" is literally true. We need complete proteins, wltich are not supplied in every grain. Does the World l.unger Coalition seek to change .Jitures' poor nutrition by forcing ·he'll to eat Textured Vegetable l otein (processed soy­beans), feed babies milk, utilize all resources available, and control their popul. lion growth Does the Coalition intend to feed people in times of drought and other natural disasters or does it intend to eternally support populations living in areas, '-¥hich cannot, by lack of fertility. support themselves? 
These qJestions presuppose that you have the means to obtain the grain (soyhe:tns? wheat? corn?) you desire. My home is a farm in the Miclwe· . I see the 111argin of profit decli;<.ng. As the profit decreases, the [dOduction is like­wise decreasing. Farmers at home use less f<'rtilizer because of its prohibitive cost and so the yield is going down. Farmers farm very pragmati,·al'y. "they do it for a living. So, sirs, ;r you want more grain, thL money will have to come from some\'·here. 
In reg rds tr your praise of Congres resolut;~n that human beings have the nght to food, I would ask you ·vhere Congress gets its authority tu legislate this right for all humanity! The United States does not legislate the rights to life, liberty, or happiness for citizens of other states. I~ we· recognize rights, recognition is the obligation that the right be upheld. Will th· United States government enforce this right? If so, how? 
Ye:,, .te~~teurs Alifn and 
D'Aurora. th.::re is comething sini~:·· 
ter in a t'nited Naions for Food. 
l"he power sruct.tre of the United 
Nations was a retlection of the 
in"quity of po\\ ·~: at the time of its 
Jnception. The JN, too, was 
foUI;dd on prag!T'atic idealiam. 
The Jnited Na1"·~·1s has been 
paralyzed; it has 1 vt maintained 
worlcl peace. As ion~ as nations are 
tlot elpally in n{ed of each other 
for survival. an <. tive United 
Nations of any kind is unfeasible. 
The goal of a st[ te is in its own 
self-interest. Ifyou aJ. ·a proponent 
of World Federalism, to which your 
United Nations for Fo d would be a 
logical outgrowth, I \\·mid say you 
had better prepare to annihilate 
every sovereign state. After this 
action you could proceed tc say 
each member of your state has a 
right to food. 
Meanwhile, I fursee no Robin Hoods in this 20th century. The farmers are not fa. ming for the masses of malnourished peoples, but to feed and clothe their families. The citizens of the United States are not going to put their interests second to world interests, whether Congress has passed a resolution or not. National govern­ments are not in existence to enforce inherent human rights, (if there are any), for non-citizens. 
You. sirs, see dreams fulfilled. I do not. Do you actually think the Civil Rights Acts did away with racism? Do you believe the college dream -to become a Domer -will end ignorance and injustice for the graduates? Apparently, you con­tend· you have found the good cause, free from evil consequences. I find this absurd. It will take much more than faulty rhetoric to im­pro~e the human condition. I have yet to see any cogent idealism in your statements, much less prag­

the natural c:onsequence of this 1 matic idealism.

Juniors hold traditional SMC X-mas 'Animal Walk' 
by Beth Welch Staf£ Reporter 

The St. Mary's junior class con­ducted the traditional Christmas Animal Walk last night. According to Nancy Mogab. junior class president, the juniors met in the SMC coffee shop at 8:30 p.m. for refreshments which were provided by the St. Mary's Alumnae As­sociation and at 9 p.m .. the walk from dorm to dorm began. 
McCandless was first visited, moving to LeMans. They took the tunnels from LeMans to Holy Cross and then to Regina. The outdoor trek to Augusta ended the walk. 
Though some aspects have been altered since its origin, the tradi­tional walk is always made up of juniors who walk in procession through the floors and halls of each dorm carolling. 
The girls arc dressed in night­gowns,· robes, and slippers, and carry candles as they sing. In keeping with the custom, the students of other classes sit outside their doors with their stuffed aminals when they hear the pro­cession approaching. These stuffed 
animals are placed outside the doors. facing away from the Church of Loretto. As the carrot ling procession passes by. the juniors turn the animals around so they are facing the Church. 
According to· Stevie Wernig, 

assistant dean of student affairs, 
"The turning of the stuffed animal·: 
toward the Churh of Loretto is a 
remembrance of the coming of the 
animals to the stable when Crhist 
was born. The carolling procession 
is ~J mbolic of the angels announc­
ing the birth of the Christ child. 
The Animal Walk has been a

Christmas tradition for many years 
although  no  one  is  exactly  sure  
when  or  how  it  started.  "This  
tradition  was  probably  initiated  

around 1935, at the time of Sr. Madeleva," said Wernig. "Most of the traditional Christmas acitivities were .?eveloped under her influ­encc. 
When the walk originated. finals were held after Christmas vacation, . and Christmas could be celebrated during the last week of classes before vacation. "On the last night before vacation, a Christmas ban­quet was held, and later that night. between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m.. the juniors staged their Animal Walk," said Wernig. 
"At that time. they wore the senior's black commencement gowns so that they were all dressed alike, but instead of white collars. they wore red ribbons. They also sore holy and tinsel in their hair, but now because of the high price of holly, only tinsel is worn," Wernig explained. 
The Woak ended in LeMans with a Christmas Mass. and hot choco­late and donuts were served after­wards. Since the calendar change in 1969, with the fall semester ending before Christmas vacation, all holiday acitivities must be planned for the week before finals. 
"We just can't do it the old way anymore because of finals," said Wernig. "But Christmas here has a real tradition. Years after gradua­tion, SMC girls remember the 


special ways we celebrated here." 1 1...-------------~

Volunteer service work available 
by Mary Ann Layden Staff Reporter 

The post-graduate or summer volunteer opprotunities are a u­nique experience and a different way for the indivieuals to grow and learn as well as a chance for them to gain insight and respect for other cultures, said Joan Griffin of the Office of Volunteer Services. The Office wants students to be aware of alternative possibilities outside of school. 
Seniors and undergraduates in­terested in post-graduate and/or summer volunteer opportunities should consider the different pro­grams and apply now, Griffin stressed. 
Tht Volunteer Services Office in LaFortune has brochures, sample applications and guidance concerning both summer and post­graduate opportunities. 
Interested students can get in­formation from the office and write directly to the program of their choice. Some of the summer pos­siblities include working for Trin­itarian Lav Volunteers, Glenmary Home Missionaries and lnnisfree Village. 
Post-graduate opportunities in­
clude the Channel Program, Inter­
national Voluntary Services, Jesuit 
Volunteer Corps. the Peace Corps 
and Vista. 
Most of the applications provice 
careful screenting process, but the 
programs are flexible. Application 
requirements can vary although

Stipulations for campus businesses released 
by Mary Pat Tarpey Senior Staff Reporter 
Notre Dame's Student Union and Student Activities Office have re­leased a revised and formal mer­chandising policy which defines the criteria for businesses and conces­sions operating on campus. 

Gennv Burke, Student Union scn·ices commissioner. explained that these guidelines are to be followed by students wishing to sell any type of merchandise on ,·am pus. 
"An~· student has to submit an applic-ation to us at Student Union. We'II evaluate it and then forward the application and our recommen­dation to Bro. John Benesh. direc­l<lr of Student Activities." explain­L'd Burke. If the applicants meet the criteria. the business will be ·tpproved. 
. application should contain the nalliL' of the applicant along with the name and location of the supplier. After an evaluation, a written response will be given to the student. 
The policy states that the product cannot be sold by any other outlet on campus. This includes the Notre Dame Bookstore. Food products or any other product that could endanger anyone's health or safety are not allowed. 
According to the guidelines. the product should be unique and should offer the purchaser some real benefit. Benesh stated, "We are looking for ways in which services can be developed for the students. we have to insure our students are served.'' Burke added, ''The service has to be worthwhile to the students and not something they could get else­where on campus.'' 
If a business is approved, the applicant must apply for a mer­chandising permit from the State of Indiana and also comply with all appropriate and legal tax require­ments which includes the Indiana local sales tax. Burke said informa­
tion  concerning  this  could  be  
obtained through her off ice.  
The  applicant  must  send  a  

monthly statement of their costs and sales to both the Student Union and Student Activities. There is a fee of $25 per semester which is paid to the Student Union. "This fee is paid for the exclusive rights to operate a business on campus," Burke explained. , 
Burke said this is the first time a formalized set of guidelines is in print. "This is more definite than we had before. Last year the criteria wasn't more definite be­cause there wasn't a great need for it. But with the more requests we received we had to have a definite policy.''
