Congress receives budget; record deficit predicted 
by Edwin L. Dale Jr. 
(c) 1972 New York Times 

WASHINGTON, Jan. 24--President Nixon today sent his third budget to Congress showing a cumulative deficit of $87 billion for the three years of his term. 
The deficit figure is without precedent, for Republican or Democratic presidents, except for unusual conditions of world war II. 
The New Budget for fiscal year 1973 puts outlays at $246.3 billion and receipts at $220.8 billion--both figures, in light of recent experience, subject to wide margins of error. If the current fiscal year 1972 is any test, the estimated deficit of $25.5 billion for fiscali973 will turn out to be much larger. 
Nixon made no apologies for his big deficits. He said the deficit planned for next year would stimulate economic recovery at a proper pace without risking a new wave of inflation. 
"Deficit spending at this time, like temporary wage and price controls, is strong but necessary medicine," the president said. "We take that medicine because we need it, not because we like it; as our economy successfully combats unem­ployment, we will stop taking the medicine well before we become addicted to it." 
For the current fiscal year, now half completed, the president estimated the deficit at $38.8 billion, by far the largest "peacetime" deficit in history. A year ago, for this same budget year, the deficit was Pstimated at $11.6 billion. 
The huge error was caused by a number of fac­tors, but the main one was the failure of the economy to grow robustly last year, which in turn, cut back receipts to the federal government. The sluggish economy is a major element in all three deficits. 
The budget contains no proposals for tax in­creases, except for the perennial request for $300 million in higher taxes on truckers which is regularly rejected by Congress. Social security taxes would rise for many, however, because of the proposed increase in the "wage base" from $9,000 to $10,200, effective this year. 
Despite the growth of government spending under his administration to nearly $250 billion, Nixon expressed pride in his record, saying that "the rate of increase in government spending has been cut nearly in half compared to the three comparable years before this administration took office." Noting that individuals this year will pay $22 billion less in taxes than under the laws in effect in 1969, he added: 
"The basic shift in the government's fiscal 
philosophy has gone relatively unnoticed. The 
upward curve of federal spending is beginning to 
flatten out, while the federal income tax 'bite' out of 
the individual paycheck is becoming measurably 
less." 
In a separate message today, the president asked 

the notre dame-saint mary's community Tuesday, January 25, 1972 
Congress to enact for the first time "an absolute limit on spending" for the new fiscal year at the hudget level of $246.3 billion. The ceiling would apply to Congress itself as well as to the executive branch of government. The president said, "It is vital that the executive and Congress act together to stop raids on the treasury which would trigger another inflationary spiral." 
Regardless of the demonstrated inaccuracy of the over-all spending and receipts estimates in modern budgets, the new budget, like its predecessors, involved major and meaningful choices on in­dividual programs. The salient choice in this budget, confirmed by high officials talking privately, was a big increase in defense allocation after several years of essential leveling out. 
Because of the long "lead times" in building ships, planes and other weapons, actual defense spending will not rise much--about $700 million in fiscal 1973 to an estimated $76.5 billion but new spending authority, if Congress agrees, will jump about $6 billion to $83.4 billion, meaning higher outlays later. 
Mainly because of the momentum of existing domestic "human resource" programs, above all social security, defense outlays will continue, for the fifth consecutive year to have a s smaller share of the total budget, despite the proposed increase. 
The same is even more true of other parts of the budget that have long been a matter of controversy­-space, foreign aid, farm subsidies, the highway program. Each of these is now, relatively speaking, almost tiny and some, like foreign aid and space, are actually declining. 
The huge growth in total outlays has come in domestic cash grants from Washington-to people and to state and local governments, mainly under laws enacted before Nixon became president, but partly under laws he has proposed. In the new budget, he again placed high priority on revenue­sharing with state and local governments-a form of direct grants with few restrictions on use--to the tune of $5.3 billion in the new fiscal year, if Congress approves.$ Nixon asked that revenue sharing be retroactive to last Jan. 1, and thus he included $2.5 billion for this account in the current fiscal year. 
In his message, the President said the "Central 
purpose" of the budget was "a new prosperity for 
all Americans without the stimulus of war and 
without the drain of inflation." 
The category of the budget called "income 
security"--cash payments to people -has soared to 
$69.7 billion in the new budget, up from $55.7 billion 
in fiscal 1971. Social security is the biggest item-­
andis not limited to the poor--but the category also 
includes rapidly growing welfare, food stamp, 
unemployment compensation and various military 
and civilian government employee retirement

(c) 1972 New York Times 
Washington, Jan. 24--The Supreme Court 
unanimously struck down today "emergency" laws 
passed last year by the New York and Connectitut 
legislatures in efforts to curb rising welfare costs by 
barring state welfare aid to persons who had not 
resided in the states at least one year. 
Both st~tes ha~ sought to avoid a 1969 Supreme 
Cou~t ruhng agamst such residency restrictions by 
calhng them necessary to avert financial 
catastrophies due to mushrooming welfare costs. 
_Bu~ in both instances, special three-judge Federal D1stnct Courts had struck down the laws, terming them transparent efforts to circumvent the Supreme Court's 1969 decision. 

Today the Supreme Court acted unanimously and without a hearing to summarily affirm the rulings of both lower courts. There was no opinoin, since the justices simply issued an unsigned order in each case saying "The judgment is affirmed." 
Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's recommendation last spring for enactment of a new one-year residency law was based upon a remark in the Supreme Court's opinion in the 1969 decision Shapiro V. Thompson, that such a restriction on fr~ interstate travel could not be justified unless it was required by a "compelling governmental interest." New York's old one-year residency requirement had been struck down by a lower court, shortly after the Shapiro decision was announced. 
The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the suit that overturned the law, said in an opposing brief that only about 11,000 new people who had been in New York less than a year were added to the welfare rolls in 1970, or less than 1 percent of all who received welfare benefits in the state. 
All three of the justices who dissented form the 6­to-3 ruling in 1969 have since left the supreme Court. They were Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justices Hugo L. Black and John M. Harlan. 

Chief Justice Warren E. Burger had indicated in an opinion two years ago that he did not agree with the 1969 Shapiro decision, but today he joined the majority as the court indicated, as it has on several occasions in the recent past, that it will not be quick to reconsider liberal doctirnes that were established before the Supreme ourt acquired its present conservative cast.

Include Laos and Cambodia in Paris talks: Mansfield 

(t·) 1!17:! Washington Star 
Washington. Jan. 24--Senate Majority leader Mike Mansfield said today that the Paris Peace Talks should be expanded to include the opposing forces in I .aos and Cambodia, and should lw relocated in or near Indochina. 
In a speech prepared for ciPlivery in the Senate, Mansfield suggested that Prince Norodom Sihanouk be returned to power in Cambodia in the place of the Lon No! Government which over­threw Sihanouk two years ago. In Laos. he suggested, the "com­promised" leadership of Prince Souvanna Phouma be replaced by a new government under the King. Sri Savang Vatthana. 
Mansfield said there had been no serious negotiations in Paris cturing the three years of the talks thPre, and that it now appeared impossible to work out a set­llemmt of the war in Vietnam without Pxpanding the talks to include the neighboring countries in Indochina. 
"What once was one war, winding down, has now become thrt>e wars sealed into one," 1\lansfield said. "That was the inevitable consequence of the invasion of Cambodia in 1970 and th( military adventure into Laos in 1971." 
Mansfield said the government of Souvanna Phouma in Laos was created as a result of the second (;Pneva settlement in 1962 when the Prince held the confidence of various Laotian political fac­tions. 
"For a decade the Prince tried to shape a single government of national unity," Mansfield said. "His efforts have been astute and dt>dicated but they have also been in doubt from the very beginning. 
"In the past few years they have broken down completely and the second Geneva accord has come to be ignored on all sides." 
While North Vietnam has supported the Pathet Lao, he said, the United States has supplied "hundreds of millions of dollars of military and other aid" to Souvanna Phouma 's govern­mPnt and "I regret to say it, but it seems to me that our help has been so overwhelming that we may well have compromised Prince Souvanna Phouma 's neutral status beyond any ex­pecta tion of recovery." 
Mansfield said the King, who 
resides in the Royal Capital at 
I .uang Prabang while Souvanna 
!'houma is in the functional 
capital at Vientiane, "may 
command sufficient trust and 
rt>spt>ct among the Laotian 
political .factions which, when 
combined with the Quasi­
rt>ligious loyalty of his people, 
may permit him to speak for the 
Pntire country with a measure of 
authority." 
Mansfield's assessment of 
Cambodia was even more 
pt>ssimistic. "The blunt truth is 
that the present government in 
Pnompt>nh is hapless, helpless 
and hopt>less," lw said. 
"Only the resources of the 
lfnitt>d States stand directly and 
indirt>ctly between the continued 
survival or the sudden demise of 
that government." 
II(' addt>d that "lhe sooner we 
rt>move ourselves from this 
situation the better for all con­
l'Prnt>d." 
Mansfield credited Sihanouk 
with kt>eping Cambodia out of the 
Indochina war for 15 years. "In 
rt>trospect." he said, "the 
overthrow of Sihanouk has 
prown more than regrettable; it 
has !wen a tragedy for the Khmer 
pt>oplt> and it has served this 
nation's interests not at all." 
Sihanouk is living in Peking as a guest of the Chinese.

Da('ca, Pakistan--Bangladesh was recognized Monday by the Soviet Union in a move announced simultaneously in Moscow and Dacca. The recognition was the first by a great power to the new nation proclaimed by Bengali separatists in East Pakistan. The only other nations to recognize Bangladesh have been from the Indian sub­continent or Eastern Europe. 
Karachi, Pakistan--President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto reversed his stand against Pakistan's financial elite and appealed for the help of businessmen in rebuilding the war-shattered economy. He also an­nounced that no new categories of industry would be nationalized and released from detention three industrialists charged with holding foreign exchange outside the country illegally. 
Washington--The Nixon administration was accused by Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, in a lawsuit filed in Wahsington, of illegally raising the federal price support for milk in return of $322,500 in campaign contributions from the dairy industry. The White House declined to comment on the matter since it was before the courts. 
Washington--A proposal to give strong enforcement powers to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was delayed in the Senate when administration opponents, who had prevailed in early votes on the measure, saw their strength dissipate when Senators Hubert H. Humphrey and Henry M. Jackson left the floor to go campaigning for presidency.

employee retirement programs 
The bulge in unemploymen: compensation payments, to ar estimated $7.2 billion in thf current year, partly because ol new legislation, was a major reason for the serious un­derestimate of total spending in fiscal 1072. The total is now put at 
236.6 billion, compared to the (stimate of $229.3 billion a year ago and a revised estimate of $232 billion in early September. 
r 
If lhP spending estimate for the new fiscal year proves correct-­which is doubtful--the rate of increase in spending will, as the President daims, slow sharply. Outlays rose $15 billion in fiscal 
1971 and an estimated $25 billion
! 
in fiscal 1972 and this would drop 
to an incrPase of just under $10 
billion in fiscal 1973. 
But looked at in another way, thP jump of $25 billion in spending in the eurrent fiscal year was the largest for a year in the entire postwar period--larger even than the biggest increase, in fiscal 1967, during the period of the Vietnam War buildup. The 1967 increase of 24 billion was larger in percentage terms, however. 
During his election campaign four years ago, the President persistently criticized the large budget deficits of the Johnson Administration as inflationary, although he said he did not support "a mechanically balanced budget." He justifies his own large deficits on the ground that the economy is now sluggish rather than booming as it was in the late nineteen sixties and can safely use stimulous from the federal budget. 
Although the over-all rise in the new budget was relatively small, it contains literally dozens of increases in individual programs, ranging from foster grandparents to rural housing.

Hall Life Board-Futility revisited 
Notre Dame witnessed another administrative abortion Monday---the an­nouncement by Rev. Thomas E. Blantz, of the appointment of members to the Hall Life Board. Of all the various committees and commissions that deface Notre Dame's landscape, this is one of the more grotesque. The Hall Life Committee was set up by the Student Life Council to oversee the halls. In the spring of 1970 the Trustees made the Board a separate entity and charged it with the responsibility of "reviewing hall constitutions and parietal regulations and insuring both conformed to standards set down by the board." 
Its achievements rank among those of other outstanding committees in the nations past, like the emergency cow manure production committee, set up during the last great conflict. 
What its achievements will be in the future could be a source of amusing speculation, if one was so inclined. 
This University doesn't need another committee to investigate and pass along suggestions and recommendations about improving hall life to "the proper authorities." This University doesn't need another committee composed of people that either have too little time, or experience to solve the problems they are called upon to investigate. 
The Trustees made a pledge last fall to the Student Government to improve conditions in the halls and the student center. Nothing has been done to fulfill this pledge. Nothing has been done to fulfill this pledge because of administrative inertia. A few bare beginnings have been made, a few bare beginnings esconsed in a lot of rhetoric. 
The Hall Life Board, according to available information, is not mandated to carry out this pledge. Even if it was, it probably couldn't. Such a body would need members with lots of time, some money and a good dose of expertise. The Hall Life Board lacks all three. 
It isn't easy to get the Trustees to make a pledge to do anything, much less promise sweeping changes in student life at this university. The present student government managed the difficult task of extracting that pledge. So far they have failed to obtain a commitmentfrom the administration to carry it out. 
Lack of funds may delay immediate implementation of physical im­
provements on a broad scale. The Trustees though, the same trustees whose job 
it is to scrutinize our financial affairs decided last fall there was enough money to 
begin. 

There is no cogent reason why that beginning hasn't been made, no reason at 
all, save the fact that the people responsible for that beginning have been un­
willing to do it. 

The best thing the Hall Life Board could do is to meet, dissolve itself and call 
for the creation of a body empowered to begin reconstructing the halls and the 
student center. 

That is the best thing the Hall Life Board could do and the only thing it could 
hope to do well.

Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know What life is, you who hold it in your hands -T. S. Eliot 
Hook seized me as I was walking off the wharf. I cried out, but who would be near to help me on such a night, so foggy and dark? Even what small light there was, burning in the dim street lamps, was itself diffusing into the heavy mist. He overpowered me easily with his strong arms and thick body, and I could tell from the sureness of his stride that he was resolute on dragging me off. He pulled me down over a restraining wall (whether it restrained the land from crumbling into the river or the river from wandering over the land, I do not know) to a place below the wharf where he had a sort of cabin. He kicked open the door and hurled me inside. The place was mostly dark except for where the lamp glowed on the table. The furnishings were rough and the entire room smelled of waterlogged and rotten wood. Hook shut the door behind him, locked and bolted it, then took his coat off. I was more astonished by my plight than afraid, and I soon lost all thought harm would befall me when he served me bisquits and tea. Make sure you eat salt on your bread, he told me as he drew up a chair. 
He said nothing for a good while after that; the gleaming eyes in his massive dark head were cast down at the table, his arms folded in front of him. It was then for the first time that I noticed his hook. His arm, emerging from his sleeve, was covered at the stump with thick leather, fastened to a wooden core by brass studs. From the end of this grew the hook. In the dim light I could not tell of what metal it was made, but I don't think it was of a kind I had ever seen before. So smooth, it did not look like a battle claw, I thought. After a time Hook straightened his back and seemed about to speak. I've had enough of my own villainy, he said, and I want to put that aside now. I mean you · no harm; I just want to talk to somebody. It's because of my reputation for evil and the unpleasant mein of my hook that people avoid me and I cant bear it no more because ... inside I'm . . . I haven't always had this hook you see-I once had a hand. There's my 
boyhood and young manly times you've got to remember. And so I'd like you to think back with me now, back to when my hand was with me. In fact, if you will, I'd like you to pretend its my hand himself who speaks, because (here Hook began to speak in a new voice) it's the secret places have discovered, the waxy folds of an ear or the final suction of the gums as I pulled a tooth out. I remember -yes, I can really remember now! -rooting up carrots, poking a seed with one finger into the warm earth. It was so queer, the tiny weight of that sparrow and his nervous feet. Oh, I was clenched and angry, squeezing myself into a fist. Even now I can feel his lip splitting. I remember touching the hand of a blind man, and envying it, for it could see. Or pulling nightcrawlers from their holes. Or in the barn up the cow's vagina, pulling her calf out. Then the bee stinging and the mad puffing of the flesh afterwards. I remember when the other arm went numb from pain; I felt with awe over its broken places, its mangled bones. It lay there like a thing hurt, like a fawn crushed under a flurry of hoofs. It was the arm of a dead man, I thought. And so I took the bread and broke it, raised the cup. All hands on deck, they said,all hands on deck. Lord, how that cannon was hot! And how cleanly I made off with that woman's necklace, and give us this day our daily bread from thy bounty through Christ through -Christ! right through the bone and the blood pouring out and the pain and God, I'm strangling! 'All hands on deck! All hands on deck! they said. To arms! To arms! All hands on deck and hold infinity in the palm of your ... Lord I'm losing my grip, I'm going to fall! I'm going to fall! hook lurched out over the table at me but I sprang to the door. He grasped the empty air and then collapsed across the table. He lay motionless for many minutes, nor did I move, watching him. Finally he turned his head to me and said, It's your life now! You have the hook! I closed the door, and fled.

Boccacio 70-two outta three ain't bad 
For $1.00 tomorrow you can see a one­line joke go on for forty-five minutes; Sophia Loren and Romy Schneider in their underwear; and three fairly reputable directors add nothing to their reputations. The occasion is the Cultural Arts Com­mission's presentation of Roccacio '70, an Italian film creation. Roccacio '70 was the brainchild of Carlo Ponti, who is married to Sophia Loren. He should have quit while he was ahead. 
The Temptations of Dr. Antonio is the most ambitious of the three films, and as such the biggest flop. Federico Fellini directed and co-wrote the screenplay with his customary sledgehammer symbolism. It was Fellini's first color effort-the film was done in 1961, as were the other two ­and in use of color was perhaps the only category in which he applied restraint. The thing was in short, gaudy: overripe, overplayed, overdone. 
I say the film was a flop; but I mean that the film is a flop as entertainment; of Dr. Antonio as art I have no opinion. It does not create a sustained impression; to does not mold or define the intangible; it creates no permanent sympathetic bonds; hut none of that is really art; in fact, who knows what art really is? Some critics thumped the tub for Fellini because of this film; and some critics panned him for it; so it is with most things. 
As entertainment, The temptation of Dr. Antonio is a one-line joke blown up a thousand times by cinema's magic lamp. P£>ppino de Fillippo plays the joke; Dr. Antonio Mazzulla, a dour, moralistic physician with a compulsion to catch people in acts of carnality. He is generally successful, to nobody's severe disac­eomodation hut his own. While addressing a troop of boy scouts (on purity, of course) <"onstruction crews roll by him on their way to the center of the park, where they Prect a large billboard with Anita Ekberg 
Joseph Abell 
on it. Anita is wearing a slinky dress and holding a glass of milk and smiling like Mae West under anaesthesia. In the background, a loudspeaker sings the Italian equivalent to Drink More Milk. 
At this point the film begins to get arty ­that is to say, disconnected and dull. Mazzulla sees the commissioner of public morals, and the commissioner clucks sympathetically a couple of times before throwing him out. He sees the Bishop; walks through the church during a funeral to rope up a few inspecting secretaries; rides with the secretaries in funeral silence to the spot of the alleged eyesore; and listens helplessly as one of the secretaries grimly pronounce, "We've already seen this picture." 
The important thing about the film to this point it its element of noise -whenever Dr. Antonio makes noise, nobody listens. People honk their horns while he's speaking or talk over him or ignore him or agree without understanding. Nothing new here. 
At this point his rage boils over into action. He hurls inkbottles at the huge billboard, until the cops come and haul him away. Later that afternoon, they cover the billboard with paper. 
Later in the evening, Dr. Antonio en­sconced safely in his home; a storm rumbling outside; the family is gathered to celebrate his triumph. Stammering and protesting, Antonio agrees to play the piano and sing a little. But as he begins, he is suddenly beset by a vision: Anita Eck­berg leering at him from the now-covered billboard. 
As the storm continues; the rain and the wind conspire to tear down the restraining paper. Antonio goes to bed, but the stor­m's noise wakes him up. Hesitantly; almost against his will, he walks to the window and looks out towards the billboard. There, to his horror, he sees Anita, making faces at him. 

Then the fun begins. He tears down to the park, runs up to the billboard, and begs Anita to leave the city. She climbs off the billboard and begins to taunt Antonio. He begs and pleads; does the If-1-could-only­help-set-your-morals-straight routine, and finally confesses everlasting love. So it goes. 
Anita Eckberg crawls down from the billboard but she acts like she's still up there. Peppino de Fillipo isn't much better, and whoever dubs his voice does it with a strained agony which sounds halfway between anger and constipation. 
In truth, though, it would be difficult for any actor to deliver lines like "If she en­ters the city two million souls will be drivel from the archangel Cupid. This may be art, but it isn't much fun.

In the last scene she lies tearfully on her bed, awaiting Milan's plastic passion as he hungrily writes out his check.

In The Raffle a bunch of dirty old men raffle off Sophia Loren's body with her unhappy consent. The raffle raised 210,000 lire, and a sexton wins.

{ seen Dallas ticket offices before a Cowboy game. No matter who the opponent, Cowboy fans in Dallas start marathon lines to get tickets for it, somethimes even if there is little chance to see the game. Only the hopt> of seeing the Cowboys play keeps them going. Tak!' the recent Super-Bowl game, for instance. I<'or the second year in a row, the Cowboys have a shot at the Championship. And their Dallas fans knew it--so much so that the first in line with ticket options was in front of the window ten minutes bt>fore the Pnd of th!' NFC Conference cham­pionship game was over. So began the saga of the ticket-wait in Dallas. A friend of mine, Kevin Kite-Powell, was one of th!' hundreds who waited in that infamous line. He was gracious enough to tell me his story and adventures, and here I pass them on to y'all: The scene: Expressway Towers, home of the Dallas Cowboys <and numerous other "respectable" businesses). The w£'a ther: the worst in recent Dallas history. (Yes, Dallas dot's have snowstorms and freezing weather). The temperature was a South Bend high of -5 degrees. and the streets had been graced with a nice, two-inch layer of ice. A heautiful day for standing in line! The spirit: high excitement and enthusiasm for the Cowboys. 
R: oo on Tuesday morning, and the ticket office did not open until Wednesday at 7. lie arrived, complete with nothing except a transistor radio and a few growing ap­prehPnsions. He "signed in" somewhat similarly to an SMC freshman at 12:00 and received his number as 179 in the line. 
The first order of business after signing in was to find a suitable place to spend the next 23 hours. Line-waiters were allowed to stay in the tower lobby. He headed for the area near the front door. 
That idea was changed the first time the door opened. 

Many were set up as completely as IS­year-old Rick Doucet here, and others, like author's frit>nd Kevin Kite-Powell, had very few conveniences. Blur in upper left­hand corner is Kevin.

At that time, the wind invaded the lobby at about 30 miles per hour. Immediate choruses of "Close the door! Close the door!" rang out, but by then the tem­perature inside had dropped to around 20 degrees, which was a bit too frosty for KPv, "so I ditched that for a warmer corner." He found one and crawled into it and listened to the tinny sounds of a local popular radio station. 
After about half-an-hour, a small, vaguely rotund man with a hint of a moustache approached him. 
"Want some company?" he asked. 
Kev shrugged. "Why not?" 
"Name's Jerrol," he told Kev. 
A long conversation began, during which 
Kev learned the tickings of a. "gung-ho, 
banzai Cowboy fan." His mother had 
apparently given him ticket options for 
Christmas, and he was in line early to see 
that he got the tickets. 
H£> was one of the people who comprised 
about 50 per cent of the crowd--people who 
would actually use the tickets they were 
waiting for. High hopes for a Cowboy win 
abounded among them as Pthnic, racial, 
and other differences disappeared in 
convt>rsations about their team. 
The other 50 per cent was made up of 
paid mPrcenaries, of which Kevin was a 
member. These were mostly college 
students with little else to do in the 
Christmas vacation, and had agreed to sit 
in line for various business blocks of ticket 
options. Their fees ran anywhere from 
nothing to $100. "One guy got some kind of 
agreement to get $5.00 for every ticket he 
eventually bought. He wound up buying 
over 80 tickets, getting some $400," Kev 
said. He himself had agreed to do the job 
for $50. 

"That was before knew what 
everybody else was getting." 
Noon was rolling around by this time, and so were the gastric juices in Kev's stomach. Arrangements for lunch had fallen through and salvation managed to arrive in the form of myself. 
Having seen news reports of the line at Expressway Towers, I had braved the slick streets (salt on the streets? in Oallas? when it gets cold how often?) to see if it was really true. Under my arm, a sleeping bag, the result of a telephone call making various requests. 
"This place is a real zoo!" was the only thing I could greet Kev with. By this time, about 300 people were standing around. A couple of Frisbees sailed past my hPad as their owners, two-and three-year-olds, went tearing through my legs. An over­weight woman asleep on a couch woke up and leered at me as a small girl crawled up on the couch after her paper plane. Music and the soapy sounds of "Days of Our Lives" bombarded me from all sides. Kevin laughed. 
Suddenly. a shrill voice made itself heard above the din. "Roll call! Roll call!" and like a flock of Notre Dame frosh before their first mixer, the crowd gathered around the voice. "This is the part that's the most fun." Kev explained. It seemed that a roll call was made at odd intervals to make sure nobody sil(ns up and leaves. 
Thm proceeded 30 mmutes of name­calling. "Everybody always gets real hyper about roll call," Kev said, after the man had pronounced only half of his name. "The first time, guys were calling wolf­y'know, fake roll calls--and gettin' everybody hacked off. The second time, it didn't work." 
By this time, equipment was at its peak in the Towers lobby. People waiting in line had brought any and everything in the line of distractions. Most had only a blanket and a radio, but one man had an entire stereo, complete with turntable and speakers, a card table and chairs, two lawn chairs, a portable radio, cards, and a television set. His area resembled a discount store. Most people were playing cards or monopoly. 
By 5:30 that night, nearly 800 people had been registered and placed in the parking garage. By this time, also, a system had been worked out to give everyone a specific place to sleep. "This was the ultimate in sheepherding," Kev com­mPnted. "We were all shuffled around and put in a place, y'know number so and so­Joe Blow--here, Ralph Whatsyername, here, and so on." Until 10:00. 
He finally lay down for the night at about 
II ::m, and was "fairly comfortable," if a bit cramped. 
At 5:30, the waiting was nearly over as a woman woke him up by packing her Pquipment up. Everyone was allowed to put his stuff in his car in anticipation of the final wait, to be made standing in an actual line. Lacking a car, Kev was forced to hold £>verything while waiting. He struggled through the door juggling sleeping bag and radio as his name was checked off for the last time. He joined the final line as his stomach was waking up. The line-­reaching a final total of over 1000-wound from the office through the lobby and back into the parking garge. At 7:15, a bedraggled Kevin turned over 14 options and $140 to the friend he was waiting for; and thankfully went home. 
Would he do it again? "Not for fifty bucks." Well. I guess there are jocks and not so 
.iocks.

Editor: 

When in a community obvious discrepancies arise between the ideals hoped for and the ac­tualities practiced, we firmly feel it not only our right, but our obligation to conscientiously oppose them by voicing our concern. 
There has been a breach of trust. The women of St. Mary's, specifically the freshmen, had been led to believe through of­ficial college publications that "because of the recent unification of St. Mary's College and the University of Notre Dame, freshmen entering SMC in the Fall semester of 1971 will have available to them all the bachelor degree programs of the University of Notre Dame." That promise has been broken. The merger has been called off. Many of the members of our community are suffering due to that about-face decision; time, money, effort, and credit hours have been lost. The students might be willing to accept this decision if they could be assured that it had been made for the common good of the community. Unfortunately, the Trustees' lack of an explanation causes doubt as to whether this decision is in fact for the common good. 
This silence is especially apalling in a so-called Christian community. As Fr. Burtchaell so aptly illustrated: "The first and most serious deficiency in our religious situation is a is a certain persistent disregard for the common good ... a society of trust needs members who will not only contribute their personal in­tegrity, but will take respon­sibility to oppose publicly those who exploit the common good." In Fr. Burtchaell's own words, then, we would ask '~How Christian is our community?" 
It appears to us that in the midst of the Trustees' silence and the apathy of most Notre Dame students, the only people upholding their Christian responsibility are the women of St. Mary's. By organized and selfless actions they have illustrated their concern for and rejection of the discrepancies brought about by this decision. We hope that their actions will lead all members of our com­munity to strive more toward the realization of the Ideal as the Actuality.

Your editorial remarks seemed needlessly cruel, unsupported, and I beliPve irresponsible, blaming Sister for present dif­ficulties without evidence, and ignoring her many positive ac­complishments during this dif­ficult period since the death of Monsignor McGrath. Sister Alma and the whole Notre Dame-St. Mary's community deserve much better of you.

Editor: 
The December 1st edition of The Observer pointed out especially well a major problem of the paper, the quality of the typing. Whoever sets the type for The Observer is becoming more and more careless as the weeks progress. Wednesday's edition contained a number of important articles on the collapse of the merger and the statements issued by Father Hesburgh and Sister Alma in connection with this. However, in reading the articles one soon became frustrated by the number of typographical errors, resulting from carelessness. Also closely related to this is the problem of omitting occasional words. In two separate places in this same issue, the same statement by Sister Alma was quoted. First, at the beginning of an editorial on page four was: "I wonder if it would not be a good thing for the majority of freshmen not to return (to St. Mary's)." Then in the first column on page three the same quote was used, but there it

read: "I wonder if it would not be a good thing for the majority of freshmen to return." From the comments that foiled in this article by De Ellis, it was obvious that one important word, NOT, was omitted in the second quote. It is important to realize that errors of this nature can drastically change the meaning of a story. Thus, I would urge Thr Obsrrver to encourage care and accuracy in the preparation of each edition for the press. This would greatly improve the quality of the paper and strengthen its reputation.

Editor: 
1 find it necessary to respond to your editorial of January 21, 1972, entitled "The Ideal Plan." A few facts are needed to avoid an uncalled for slur upon the quality of education at the Law School. First, regarding the faculty, there can be no doubt that these are men of outstanding scholarship and ability. A clear indicia of this is the fact that the published works of these men are known and utilized by the members of the legal profession. Textbooks and casebooks authored by members of thP faculty are in use in many other Law Schools throughout the nation. Another indicia is the number of graduates passing various State Bar exams last vear. In New York, where passage is not routine, all can· didates from the Law School passed. 
Next. regarding the student body, a few facts clearly show the level of quality. This years First Year Class entered the Law School with a mean LSAT score of 620 and cumulative college average of 3.3. Next years en­tering class will enter with a mean LSAT score of 645 and a cumulative college average of :l.4. These figures evidence a student body which is well qualified. The fact is that the Law School is already well stocked with('xcellentstudentsandawell

NJ law muffles ear pollution for first time

Weekend security report 
by Ed Rahill 
This weekend saw the theft of a black Cadillac and $500 worth of merchandice, according to Security Director J. Arthur Pears. 
Pears reported that thieves stole a black Cadillac belonging to Mr. H. Holsinger of Terre Haute, Indiana, from the Morris Inn parking ot Tuesday evening between 6:20 and 7:45 P.M. County police later recovered the car, stripped of its wheels, the next morning. In addition thieves broke into three cars last week and stole an estimated $500 worth of merchandise. 

In comparison the entire vacation period was relatively crime-free, with only the theft of an electric screw driver repor­ted. Pears attributed this to what he called the "tight security conditions" on campus during the vacation. 
According to the security director, the post-vacation return of students was partially responsible for the increase in crime. However, Mr. Pears refused to assign sole blame upon returning students, asserting that some of the thieves might have come from the South Bend area. "We do not know who they are", he said. 
remarked a state environmental 
official, "is to give less bang for 
the buck." 
In signing the measure this morning, Cahill, a Republican who is gaining a tough reputation in protecting New Jersey's deteriorating environment, said that the state was the first to legislate in this field. 

As a result, instead of ex­cessive noise remaining a local crime of disturbing the peace, it will now be a statewide offense of disturbing the environment. 
Because New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the nation; ·becaus it has the most heavily traveled highways. and because it is one of the most industrialized states in the country, state environmental officials say it also is the noisiest. 
The noise has prompted one community after another to adopt local ordinances aimed at reducing it.

Winter Consort will replace Jonathan Edwards in the Notre 
DameMardiGras concert on February 13, Rich Donovan, Social 
Commission Concert Chairman announced yesterday. 
The classical jazz group was chosen after Edwards cancelled out 
of his engagement this past weekend, Donovan said. He reported 
that Edwards was unable to appear because he was booked for two 
performances that same weekend in the South, and felt con­
sequently that it would be too difficult to keep his Notre Dame date 
We are not at all disappointed with our substitute Winter Consort, 
however, the Concert Chairman stated. "They appeared with 
Gordon Lightfoot last spring and were extremely well received." 
Donovan also noted that the group had previous 'jam 'sessions 
with Richie Havens, who will also appear that night.
