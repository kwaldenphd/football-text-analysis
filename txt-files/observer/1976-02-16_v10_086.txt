Planks supporting women's rights, stiffer gun control mea~­ures, and large scale economtc reforms to help minorities were passed Friday night by the Mock Democratic Convention's Platform Committee in a fifth and final meeting. 
Advocating passage of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), among other specific legislation, the com­mittee also called for full employ­ment to help lift minorities out of their economic dilemma. 
Controls on buying guns ap­proved by the committee included state committees to determine who would be permitted to purchase firearms. and state regulation of stores selling firearms. 
Also passed were planks favor­ing family planning, reforms in criminal rehabilitation, decriminal­ization of marijuana and a crack­down on the selling of narcotic drugs, and equal recognition of l~rael's and Palestine's rights to live in the Middle East.

Debate was subdued at the final

women's rights and gun control 
issues being the most difficult 
proposals dealt with. The minority

with no debate and no amend­

up by the Black Caucus. 
The main area of contention in the women's rights bill was whether to support the ERA alone, or to also advocate legislation dealing with specific women's problems. After a lengthy debate, the delegates kept both the ERA and the specific legislation.

Borges opens Literary Festival 
by Reed King Staff Reporter 
The lOth annual Sophomore Literary Festival began dynamical­ly last night with the appearance of Jorge Luis Borges, the internation­ally renowned Argentine author. 
An excited, capacity crowd of over 600 students and professors jammed Washington Hall long before Borges was scheduled to appear. When the blind writer-poet finally was Jed slowly onto the stage, wild applause was there to greet him. The momentum of that rousing welcome carried through the entire evening, as the audience became immediately enraptured with the pert little man, so full of vibrant mental energy. 
Borges' talk focused upon Walt Whitman, especially his poem, "Leaves of Grass." He spoke of Whitman's great contribution to America, descnbing him as an "essential poet" in the formation of America. As Borges explained, Walt Whitman wrote of everything in America, both the good and the bad. 
He further portrayed Whitman to be a great believer in democracy who felt that the New World createda poetry all of its own --that of the common man and his life. 
Borges described Whitman as the "Father" of free verse and use of colloquial language in po­etry. He talked of the great poet's influence in his own writing, ad­ding that Whitman's epic poem, "Leaves of Grass," was a poem of all men of all ages, and that it allowed everyone to share vividly in his dream of America. 
Borges openly declared his ad­miration of Whitman as a great man, not merely a clever one, as shown by his statement, "Clever-ness was tor Jesser men I'' As Borges further mentioned, ''Amer­ica has given the world Walt Whitman, and the world should be grateful." 


Although not a believer in demo­cracy himself, the Argentine author was still able to demonstrate vividly Whitman's great love for America. In fact, when Borges spoke in his lilting, musical voice, one got the impression that Walt Whitman himself was speaking. He portrayed Whitman as a real flesh-and-blood human being, al­beit a very wise one, not merely as a vague figure resurrected from some dusty old history or literature textbook. He spoke of Whitman as an old friend, almost as if he had known him personally. 
Throughout the entire evening, the audience was simply enthralled with Borges, who addressed them as a friend, almost as if he were a wise grandfather relating various tales of his life. Borges' humor, candor, and energetic personality endeared him with everyone. 
During a question and answer period after his talk on Whitman, he was very witty and at home wit his audience. In an indirect response to a question about which "category" he felt his works belonged to, he replied, "No reason to read my works at all. don't read them. I only write them." 
When asked whether or not his works were surrealistic, Borges retorted, "No, I know little about surrealism and care less." Borges' quiet, dry humor kept the audience always on its toes and attentive. 
Also during this question period, a glimpse of the deep inner forces acting within the man was appar­ent. When asked if there was any driving motive behind his writing, Borges responded softly, "No, I follow the whistling of the wind, my dreams." This was greeted with much applause. 
Borges' talk was concluded with a fine round of applause from an appreciative audience, a tribute to a truly great writer. 
The Sophomore Literary. Festival will continue tomorrow with the appearance of John Gardner in the Library Auditorium. His talk will begin at 8:00 p.m. All are invited and encouraged to attend.

Fr. Hesburgh oncommittee to assist federal agencies 
by Terry Keeney Edltor·ln-Chlef 
Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, Univer­sity president, has been appointed to a 10-member committee to advise the U.S. Departments of Labor and Health, Education and Welfare on Federal affirmative action programs for colleges and universities. 
The committee will aid the two Federal agencies in adopting work­able guidelines for the hiring of women and minorities in higher education. 
The committee was appointed by Labor Secretary John T. Dunlop, who has since resigned, and HEW Secretary F. David Mathews. It is headed by Robben Fleming, presi­dent of the University of Michigan, and includes the presidents of PJ;inceton and Harvard. 
The committee, scheduled to meet for the first time on Feb. 27 in Washington, D.C., includes three women, two of them black, one black male and one Chicano male. 
Hesburgh said that the commit­tee was formed because present guidelines, adopted by the Labor Department, are not working. The committee will bring Labor and HEW together to provide reason­able hiring requirements for wo­men and minorities in higher education. 
"I think we're all agreed we want affirmative action in the best way possible," Hesburgh said. He hopes that by bringing together the two Federal agencies the commit­tee can avoid the "Micky Mouse" of the current stringent guidelines. 
The committee is an outgrowth of hearings on affirmative action plans in higher education held last summer and fall by the Labor Department. Fr. James Bur­tchaell, University provost, in tes­timony at the Labor Department on Oct. 1, said that affirmative action standards for colleges and universi­ties were unreasonable because of the lack of trained women and minorities to meet hiring quotas. 
According to Hesburgh, the ori­ginal Labor Department guidelines were unreasonable partl~ because they were based on the same quotas as those for corporations. Hesburgh hopes that the commit­tee will tailor guidelines for affirm­ative action hiring specifically to higher education. 
Hesburgh said that, unlike cor­porations, colleges and universities must draw their faculty and staff from the pool of women and minorities receiving their doctoral degrees. Because this pool of available women and minorities is so limited, colleges and universi­ties have not met their affirmative action uidelines. 

Blacks endorse Humphrey 
The Black Caucus of the 
University of Notre Dame last 
night unanimously endorsed a 
draft of Senator Hubert H. 
Humphrey at the Mock Political 
Convention in their caucus 
meeting. 
"We believe that Humphrey 
best characterizes the position 
of Black students on this cam­
pus, and, more importantly, of 
black people in the United 
States," said members of the 
caucus in a statement released 
last night. 
The caucus alsQ stated that 
they favored the nomination of a 
black candidate at the Demo­
cratic convention, saying that 
they felt this action to be a 
"great necessity." They noted, 
however, that due to social and 
economic conditions in the U.S. 
at the present time this was not 
a viable alternative. 
Black Assemblyman Julian Bond of Georgia won the sup­port of the caucus originally. The caucus noted, however, that . Bond confirmed his intentions to seek the nomination last sum­mer, but decided to witiYiraw in 
J14ly due to a lack of finances. 
·"A realistic evaluation of the 
present conditions in our coun­
try" led the Black caucus to

Toohey notes 'good' trend 
Are ND students more religious? 
O'Brien stated that the theology
by Tim Boyle 
Staff Reporter 
Is there a renewed religious feeling among the students of Notre Dame? The members of the campus clergy seem to think so, both in lay student participation and in seminary vocations. 
Fr. Bill Toohey, the head of Campus Ministry, said he senses a general feeling of religious commit­ment in the Notre Dame student body. Toohey notices a definite increase in attendance at services and calls this a "real sign" because attending mass "is something stu­dents are not about to do in a phony way." 
Toohey observes three other signs in addition to mass atten­dance. One he cited is a renewed interest in theology itself. Theo­logy Prof. William O'Brien said that over fifteen percent of this year's Arts and Letters seniors and 
8.6 percent of business seniors have taken more than the required number of theology courses.

Teaching and research assistants will have their stipends increased to a base of $2,800, will be eligible for the University's Blue Cross group plan ,, and will have a new meeting room said Vice President for Advanced Studies Robert Gor­don, in a talk Thursday at 8 p.m. in the Library Auditorium. About 40 graduate students heard the talk, sponsored by the Graduate Student Union. 
The outlook for graduate education includes a reduction in the demand for Ph. D.'s in aca­demia due to decreasing college enrollments, steady reducation of research funds and decline of all forms of financial support.. 
In spite of t,he bleak outlook for graduate. schools, "it would be absolute disaster to close them,'' said Gordon answering a question. He added that the relationship between graduate students and professors is reflected in teaching, research and the general quality of university education. 
"Federal government will turn on and off the spigot,'' Gordon said referring to research funds. He cited the "Camelot era" of

department just recently began keeping these statistics so there are 
no  past  figures  with  which  to  
compare.  
Toohey  also  noted  "a  real  

interest in retreats and in meetings of prayer groups in the last couple of years." The Campus Ministry has scheduled seven retreats for the remainder of the spring semes­ter. Toohey mentioned daily Charismatic prayer meetings in Cavanaugh Hall. 
Toohey added that the quiet mood on today's campus is often mistaken for apathy and docility. He prefers to think of it as ''a kind of cooperative spirit of searching and exploring." 
He concluded that though there are no radical movements as there were in the late 1960s students are still concerned with serving hum­anity. He cited the Volunteer Services and the platform of the Mock Democratic Convention as examples of social concern. University Chaplain Fr. Robert 
new benefits 
research funds which reached its peak in 1966 and dried up in 1971. Funds will still be available in health-related areas, in fields that provide services and in energy research. In other areas research funding is meager. 
Gordon pointed out that job­oriented master's degrees are going to be popular. Ph. D.'s should consider their European counterparts who, though they are scholars, do not rely on their expertise to earn a living. He cited as examples a European bank manager and a department store manager who have advanced de­grees in scholarly fields and are businessmen. Gordon plans to write a ''white paper'' to dispel the notion held by personnel managers that, ''If you have an advanced degree, you're too good for us." 
Gordon praised Margaret Grounds, president of he Graduate Student Union, for enquiring into the Blue Cross question and sug­gesting that the university acquire the warehouse at the site of the new graduate women's apartment complex. The building has been purchased, and plans are in the works for converting it into a graduate student commons. 
Griffin said he notices "greater religious awareness and practice than there was seven or eight years ago.'' He said in his trips around campus he sees a high rate of attendance at masses in womens' dorms as well as in the Keenan Hall chapel. 
An informal survey of the hall rectors reveals increased atten­dance at masses this year, particu­larly at daily services. Some rectors, while admitting this fact, wished to remain nameless be­cause they do not consider merely promoting numbers at the masses to be a concern of their ministry. 
As Toohey commented, "There are more important things than counting hosts and lighted candles at the grotto." 
Fr. Joseph Carey is head of admissions at the Moreau Semin­ary and he has observed a substan­tial increase in vocations over the past three years. There are cur­rently 83 seminarians enrolled, up fifteen from last year. Carey said the increase is the result of more college graduates enrolling in the seminary. He said that persons entering the seminary after they have graduated from college are more sure of their vocation than college underclassmen and are much less likely to drop out. Eleven of the 21 men who entered the seminary last fall are college graduates. 
Carey added that there are 30 people on campus and ten lay residents at Moreau who are considering joining the priesthood. 
"When I was in the undergrad­uate theology deparatment here at Notre Dame in 1968 and '69 there was a mood of indifference," he said. There is much more interest now."

NotreDame votes may determine county issues 

by Jean O'Meara Staff Reporter 
"A solid block of votes from the Notre Dame community could af­fect the student life on and off campus," said Clerk to St. Joseph County Circuit Court, W. Joseph Doran, this Friday in his office at the County Court House. "So far," 
he added,  "the voting  has  been  
apathetic."  
According  to  Cathy  Bernard,  

president of the League of Women Voters, the issues on national, state and local levels will be determined by the active interest and concern of the constituents before the primaries. 
The actual turnout in the Nov. S, 1974 election revealed 961 voted from a total of 2,097 registered voters in the Notre Dame commun­ity. Corinne Wroblewski, in charge of Voters' Registration in St. Joseph County, attributes this margin to the general apathy of all voters after Watergate and to the transient character of Notre Dame life.

Unusual weather plagues WWW 
by Lisa Morel Staff Reporter 
Plans for the 2nd annual "Wacky Winter Weekend" scheduled to take place this Friday and Satur­day, February 20 and 21 in cooper­ation with the Notre Dame and St. Mary's Social Commissions are still under way, even though the weather isn't cooperating. 
It seems to be a tradition for the Wacky Winter Weekend to have unusual weather. "Last year we wanted snow and we got rain--this year we wanted cold weather conditions, and instead we are getting warm weather," explains John Rooney, Wacky Winter Weekend chairman. He adds, "Maybe we should change the name to Wacky 'Weather' Week­end! But as for me, I would just as soon see the weather stay warm so more people will come out and have a good time." 
Molly McKenna, St. Mary's Social Commissioner is in charge of Friday's activities which will begin with a Happy Hour at Kubiaks from 3-6:00 p.m., sponsored by the 
Hartke prediets Ford to lose 
INDIANAPOUS (AP) --U. S. Sen. Vance Hartke, D-Ind., pre­dicts President Ford will lose his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. 
Ford's performance in the first five presidential primaries will be the key to his campaign for the GOP nomination, Hartke told the Democratic Women's Club here Saturday. But if he falters in those crucial tests, Hartke warned Ford's campaign might not be able to recover. 
The primaries cited by Hartke include New Hampshire, Feb. 24; Massachusetts, March 2; Florida, March 9; Illinois, March 18; and North Carolina, March 23. 
Hartke said Ford's campaign is feeling increased pressure from former California Gov. Ronald Reagan, adding that the President shouldn't overlook a challenge from Vice President Nelson Rock­efeller.

their university life, they aren't aware of what is happening in St. Joseph's County or in Indiana. This is really their adopted state, she added. 
Wroblewski, however, doesn't encourage out-of-state students to register and vote in Indiana. "Many young people are not aware that any student receiving funds from their home-state may jeopar­dize any financial aid if they register in Indiana." 
Brother John Lavelle, Democrat­ic Precinct Committeeman of Dis­trict I on the Notre Dame campus, revealed that in the May primary preceding the election in November of 1974, only ISO voted out of the 2,097 total. 
''This sounds very discouraging until you realize the students are on their way home after taking exams and getting ready to work for the summer," Lavelle concluded. 
Wroblewski emphasized that the May election would include the presidential primaries. Other pri­maries on the slate will be Gover­nor, Lt. Governor, U.S. Senator, Congressman, two State Senators, two County Commissioners, four 
junior class. Also, depending on the weather there will be ice-skat­ing on Lake Marion and tobaggan­ing behind Regina Hall. 
The rest of Friday's activities will take place in LaFortune. The ballroom upstairs will be redecor­ated to the effect of a discoteque, and will be the scene of the disco-dance held from 9-1:00 a.m. 
A dance contest will be held with the winners receiving prizes. WSND will broadcast live from the dance, and the sound system is Mcintosh Equipment, donated by The Sound Room. Downstairs the lounge will be open for people to sit, and relax and socialize. 
Activities will resume Saturday at l2 p.m. with hot dogs and hot chocolate being served in Holy Cross Hall. There will be an extra shuttle bus running, beginning at

At 1 p.m. ND and SMC vs. the Off-Campus guys in a hockey game. At 1:40p.m. there will be an ice cream eating contest with one person from each hall competing in a race to eat a half-gallon of ice cream. 
Beginning at 2:00p.m. will be a bunny-hop, 2:20 p.m. a ski-race, and at 2:30 the egg-toss will begin.

Four males assault couple 
by Frank Tennant Staff Reporter 
A Notre Dame law student and his date were assaulted early Saturday morning outside gate 10 of the ACC. William Sparks and his date were attacked while leaving the Lewis Formal, by four males at approximately 1:15 a.m. 
Sparks, a second year law stu­dent, described the robbers as four well-dressed young blacks, about 18 years old. The assailants took his wallet with $50 in it. He said they assaulted him as he opened the driver side of the car after he let his date in the passenger side. 
County Councilmen. The slates will be completed by March lS and by that time the issues on all of these 
levels  will  be  made  into party  
platforms.  
The  issues  which  affect  the  

quality of student life at Notre Dame have been fought for through representatives and St. Joseph County committee members, La­velle said, but "the man who carries your banner doesn't always win the day." 
The most recent disappointment concerned the famous House Bill 1818 which would have lowered the drinking age to 18. Both State representatives, backed by ND students, Richard Bodine (D) and Robert DuComb (R), supported the Bill. Yet in March 197S, the Bill 1818 was killed by House Chairman Chester F. Dovis, who decided not to hold a vote. 
At that time Student Body Pres­ident, Pat McLaughlin, stated in the Observer, March 7, 197S, "It's going to be introduced every year until the damned thing gets through." 
Other issues of immediate con­cern to students are handled by St. 
Immediately following will be Snow Bowl '76 which will feature a football game between interhall football champions, Keenan and Pangborn. 
Ending the weekend on a high note will be a concert by Robert Klein, a nationally famous comedi­an. The concert will be held at 
Stepan Center at 8 p.m. and the price will be $2 per person. Ticket sales will be announced later in the week. 
Also, throughout the week will 
be a contest run by Kevin Saddler 
to guess the whereabouts of the 
"Wacky Wabbitt". Clues will be 
given throughout the day on WSND 
and also in the Observer's personal 
ads. The person who guesses the 
location at the disco-dance Friday 
night will win a prize of $100. 
If anyone is interested in joining 
any of these activities, they are 
urged to see their hall representa­
tives or get in touch with the 
following people: Disco-dance-­
Molly McKenna (4600), Saturday's 
activities--Nancy Budds (1333) or 
Cori Ching (1298). 
"We hope everybody will come 
out and enjoy the nice weather 'and 
have a good time,'' comments 
Molly McKenna, "it'll be a big and 
exciting weekend to fill the gap 
between Mardi Gras and An Tos­
tal." 
The incident occurred in the 
lighted parking lot about SO yards 
from gate 10. After beating Sparks 
and his date, the assailants fled 
south on Juniper Road on foot. 
Sparks said he could not catch any 
of them. 
Sparks said they received only minor injuries. He suffered abras­ions on his forehead and a few cuts. One attacker hit his date as she pushed her way out of the car and ran for help. 
Sparks doubted if he could identify the assailants and specu­lated they were not students. 
Notre Dame Security said they were not authorized to release any information concerning the inci­·def!t. 
Joseph County Council members, presently represented by Walter Mucha (District B: ND and SM campuses) and Tom Catanzarite (District G: off-campus students). These men can affect laws on burglaries, road funding, recrea­tion development (St. Patrick's  Farm) and the County Airport. 
On a broader level, the League of Women Voters is preparing ques­tions for all candidates which they, as a group, think should be included in the party platforms. President of the League, Barnard, mentioned a few of the concerns. On the national level, Barnard thinks the Equal Rights Amend­ment must be dealt with. "It should not be reduced to ERA or Right to Life," she stressed. "One does not exclude the other." Federal funding for the survival of the South Shore Line should be asked of Senator Hartke, Barnard said. 
Those representing the State levels must be confronted with their position on: revised Penal Code, Pari-mutuel betting, the phosphate ban, stated .tlarnard. 
Notre Dame students, she is convinced, should pursue the cand­idates with their questions and convictions. In this way, they could affect the party platforms before the primaries. 
COUL to distribute social life questionnaire Tuesday 
By James Flahaven Staff Reporter 
Co-educational housing, student drinking habits, and social space will be the topics of aquestionnaire to be distributed by the Committee of Undergraduate Life (COUL) on Tuesday. SLC representative Ed Van Tassel, who heads the project, .said,' 'This will be the first real indicator we will have on the social atmosphere at Notre Dame." 
The questionaires, which will be distributed randomly to some 1200 students by the hall presidents, deal with various facets of the three topics. 
In the area of co-educational housing, students will be asked if they favor co-ed dorms, if they would live in such a dorm, and other questions concerning the effect of such dorms on the University. According to Van Tassel even with favorable re­sponse on co-ed dorms, it could be 
some time before they would be implemented. "Even if they are 100 per cent for it I don't think next year would be realistic. I think it would be at least the year after that," said Van Tassel. 
Questions on drinking habits will center on the student's weekly

consumption and reasons for drink­ing. "There has been a Jot of interest in this, this year", said Van Tassel. "And since we were distributing the questionaire I thought we could include some different questions that would be of interest to people concerned with social life at Notre Dame."

What Was Not Said 
Last Thursday's Town Meeting was interesting as much for what was not said as for what was said. 
The rreeting brought out the ideals of the panelists about what Notre Dame should become. From Fr. Hesburgh's notion of Notre Dame as a "caring community" to Prof. Peter Walshe's plan for an egalitarian university, the panelists discussed a Notre Dame that seemed at tirres fictional. 
Beneath the rhetoric, serious questions were raised about the future of this place, including how it is governed and how students and faculty are treated in the ''COilJOrate structure'' of the University. These questions went unanswered throughout the session. 
What was not said was why the University adheres to a policy of "in loco parentis" under which the University claims to be a sUITOgate parent Ed Byrne correctly observed that philoso­phically "in loco parentis" is a poor way of treating anyone past adolescence. Ironically, the Notre Dame Commencemmt speaker last May said the same thing. 
What was not said was whether the University system of governance is appropriate and worldng. Beneath the disucssion about refonning the COilJO:r­ate structure lies a dissatisfaction with the cwrent representative bodies on this campus --the SLC, Faculty Senate and the Academic Council. Prof. Paul Conway never had the chance to discuss the proposal from the Arrerican Association of Universi­ty Professors on University Governance. 
What was not said was why parietal hours cannot be further extended. Fr. Hesburgh argued that the Board of Trustees probably would not want to discuss the issue which it has considered four tirres in the last six years. There was no discussion about the PUilJOSe of parietals. Do parietals exist as a mechanism for privacy, as Diane Merten argued, or as a means of enforcing the University sexuality 
code? 
Undoubtedly, some good things emerged from the Town Meeting. It brought together students, faculty and admini:strators to discuss both ideals and grievances. It provided a clarification of the University's alcohol policy and the admini:stration's hopes to build a campus pub if Indiana ever approves an 18-yea:r-old drinking age. It also gave Brother Just Paczesny the chance to ''show and tell" University plans for I.aFbrtune. 
Ed Byrne and Student Governmmt had a good idea to hold the Town Meeting. Yet whether the Meeting fulfilled its PUilJOSe is another matter. Many of the serious questions were not answered. Fr. Hesburgh's remark that the University's problems are small compared with world problems of injustice and hunger is obviously true, but that is no excuse for minimizing the serious and legitimate grievances of persons in the University community. 
The Town Meeting may have been long on lofty ideals, but it was short on practical issues.

Chapter Seven: The Work of -Celmar Marcel (1880-1957) 
Part One 
Marcel originally studied to ­become a priest, a decision largely motivated by a vision he had when he was seven. In it, the ;Virgin Mary appeared to Marcel telling him he must warn the world to turn away from double-knit suits. She also promised she would re-appear in 1925 and tell Marcel a good spot to open a McDonalds, but this never occurred ... Hours before his ordination as a priest, however, Marcel was asked to leave the monastery for making immoral advances towards a piece of French toast, 
Undaunted, Marcel left to go to 
the Academie in Paris to study philosophy. It was at the Academie that Marcel met one of his closest friends the famous philosopher Bertrand Humus (Humus' father had named him after Bertrand Russell, something Humus never understood since at the time Ber­trand Russell hadn't been born). Humus was not only a brilliant logician, he was one of the few people in the worfd who could talk about Marcel and keep a straight face. He was a rather tragic figure who worked all his life on a proof ofGod's existence. However, the closest he could get was a recipe for 
Welsh. Rarebit 
Upon leaving the Academie in 1905, Marcel finished an essay so controversial he could not find a publisher, although several copies were distributed in specially mar­ked boxes of Kellog's Sugar Frost­ed Flakes. The new work sug­gested that Descartes created Cartesian Dualism in the hope he could file separate tax returns. When the book finally appeared all Paris was in an uproar and for days people refused to eat yogurt. Eventually, however, the work became well accepted and Marcel was awarded the "Le Guard de 
France", a medal he later returned as part of the world wide protest when New Jersey tried to make mayonnaise their state bird 
It was soon after this initial success that Marcel had his first strange dream. In the dream Marcel is standin by the ocean's 
DOONESBURY 

edge when a giant lobster comes out of the water and begins carving the Chinese alphabet on his fore­head. Jung thought this sympt­omatic of a lifetime of epistomo­logical and cosmological inquiry, while Freud thought it was prob­ably something he ate. Marcel eventually stopped having the dream but he still always carried with him a bottle of seafood sauce. 
Next Week: Part Two traces the last thirty years of Marcel's life both his successes and setbacks: He fails to win the Nobel Prize but his monumental work "Prolegom­ena to Logical Positivism" is turned into a popular TVgame
show. 

Since the U.S. House of Representatives' vote to curtail all aid to Angola, a commentary and a letter have appeared in the 
Observer favoring military intervention. The authors bemoan the fact that the Congress has shirked its responsibilities to support the pro-Western forces and to protect our long-range economic and strategic interests. In groping for reasons to intervene, the authors overlook information pertinent to an adequate evaluation of the conflict. In attempting to draw out the "right" history lesson from, of all places, Vietnam, they studiously ignore the past twenty-five years of African history. 
While an historical perspective is essential, Americans nonethe­less tend to ignore history. The present administration's assessment of Angola and past administrations' conceptions of Vietnam are really quite 'similar, in that they have consistantly displayed a profound disregard for the historical trends in those areas. The author of the letter, in trying to justify intervention, stresses that Angola is different from Vietnam because the two pro-western factions apparently carry considerable popular support. Though this isolated fact is true, I find the overall argument insufficient because, again, it fails to put the conflict within the framework of political developments on the African continent. 
In the past two decades over two dozen African states have been liberated from their European colonizers. To prime their unstable economies, and to protect themselves from possible aggression of neighboring nations, these struggling states have accepted aid and arms from almost anyone. Many maintain trade relations simulataneously with the West, China, Russia, and African countries as well. While foreign assistence plays an important role in their development, it is overly simplistic and unwarranted to assume that these African states who recently fought so hard for independence will somehow fall prey to foreign dominance. 
Besides, there are numerous indications which also tend to weaken the pro-interventionist stance concerning the fate of Angola. Sino-~oviet jockeying tor position on the continent has alienated a number of African leaders. Tanzania, which has received Russian arms and Chinese technical assistance, retains a great independence admired by most African leaders. Kenya cracked down on Sino-Soviet sentiment within its government. Zaire (formerly the Congo) saw a contingent of Cubans in the President's personal militia in 1966. They were expelled in 1968. The Sudan stopped exporting Soviet arms to rebels in the Congo. These, along with the widely publicized Egyptian rejection of the Russians, are perhaps the most prominent examples in the current trend to assert nationalism. 
Perhaps it is in the somewhat waning spirit of the current ''Fifties Revival" that the author of the commentary chose to resurrect the "Domino Theory". This alarmist viewpoint has been over-used unsuccessfully to the point of being intellectually threadbare. Particularly in instances where newly liberated countries have accepted aid and arms from Russia, alarmists in the West have cried out that the country in question would be the first Russian satellite on the continent--as they mourned the fate of Guinea in 1958, of Zanzibar in 1963, and of the Congo in 1966. In their eyes, these and other countries were destined to become centers for subversion to overrun the rest of the continent. Their judgements were simplistic and premature. In the past twenty years, the Russians have failed, except in Somalia, to gain significant influence on the continent. 
That communist revolutions in one country will promote more communist revolutions worldwide is a very limited outlook. It is highly unlikely that the fate of a few million Vietnamese peasants has had any profound effect upon the political persuasions of some rival Angolan tribes. Revolutions will occur wherever local conditions warrant; to attempt to causally relate that to political movements elsewhere lays bare the shallowness of perceiving the world through an obsolete, Cold War, mentality. 
In a recent visit to a Notre Dame government course, a top Air Force advisor, whose field of expertise is Angola and Uganda, lucidly remarked that the worst thing we can do to the Russians is to let them win in Angola. He felt that the communist backed MPLA forces would win, but hastened to add that they would probably be expelled in the not too distant future, following the pattern of recent African history which has displayed a decided aversion towards Russian domineering. 
It seems rather obvious to this author that heavy expenditures by the United States in the virtually unformed African state of Angola is an investment against the grain of history and would be sheer folly.

John Gardner: "I thought I was going to die tragically young" 

The Sophomore Literary Festival will present John Gardner. a noted American novelist, critic, poet, scholar, and medie­valist. tonight at 8 P.M. in the Library Auditorium. 
The New York Times proclaimed Gard­ner as "a major American writer whose promise for the future seems unlimited." Critics have acclaimed Gardner as a writer with rare brilliant imagination and power and h<>· et :!mired his "Homeric vitality."
(,'c}.t.~er was born in 1933 in Batavia, New York. He obtained his bachelor's degree from Washington University at St. Louis in I%4 and received his masters and Ph.D. degrees at the State University of Iowa. 


Of his early life, Gardner writes,   I grew up on a farm and wrote poems, novels, and plays on the typewriter in my grand­mother's law office and under the tractor in :he back lot when I was supposed to be >lowing. Went to DePauw University, 
vhere I thought I was a chemist; left after 
J faculty publications '] 
two years and went to Washington University in St. Louis where I thought I was a great poet and was going to die tragically young. went to the State University of Iowa where I worked hard and wrote worse than in my childhood. Became, by accident, a medievalist." 
Gardner has taught creative writing and medieval literature at Oberlin College, Chico State College( Chico, California), San Francisco State, Southern Illinois Univers­ity and Bennington College (Vermont). 
Gardner has written several textbooks and six novels; his articles of short fiction and poetry have appeared in many journals. Gardner is co-author of The Forms of Fiction (1961); he has also written 
modernizations of The Complete Works of GawaJn-Poet(1965) and The Alliterative Morte Arthure')1971) along with The 
Constitution of the Wakefield Cycle(1974) and Dragon,Dragon and Other Tales( 1975) His novels are Nickel MountaJn(1963), The Resurrection (1966), The Wreckage of 
Anglo-Saxon Poetr!f·· 
tribute to a retired Medieual scholar 
One of latest faculty publications by the University of Notre Dame Press has been a volume of critical essays on Anglo-Saxon Poetry edited by Lewis Nicholson and Dolores Warwick Frese. It contains 25 pieces of criticism and interpretation "created and collected in honor of John C. McGalliard on the occasion of his retire­ment from the University of Iowa after a distinguished career as a scholar-teacher of medieval literatures.'' 
The collection reflects important con­temporary interpretations of the Old English Classics and shows evidence of extensive and ambitious groundwork by Nicholson and Frese. Their, efforts, however, have proved professionally suc­cessful. It is appropriate and exciting tribute to a man so reknowned in the field of Anglo-Saxonism. and an excellent overall view of contemporary and even conventional Anglo-Saxon interpretation. 
Of the 25 essays on Anglo-Saxon poetry in this critical cornucopia, the first five deal exclusively with Beowulf criticism. The first of these is by Norman Eliason, a who moves to resolve the long debate over the appellation of Healfdene's daughter in line 62 of Beowulf and the presumed 
thomas o'neil 
naming of her husband (commonly accept­ed to be Onela) in the same line. 
This essay by Eliason resolves the battle by attacking the basic presupposition that either of the two were named at all. It suffices, he believes, to assume they are not named(in particular, Healfdene's daughter), a belief which is consistent with the poet's delivery in other places through­out the poem and one which should console the literary gluttons who believe, because of this peripferal ambiguity, that they are missing a major piece of the poetic pie. 
The second essay is written by John Gardner, the accidental Medievalist who is appearing tonight in the Library Aud­itorium as a guest speaker of the Sopho­more Literary Festival. In his essay "Guilt and the World's Complexity" he suggests that Beowulf may somehow be myster­iously and indirectly responsible for the murder of Ongentheow by illustration and parallel between the "Old Swedish King and the flame-spewing dragon." Blood­drenched as Beowulf's hands are by the end of the poem, Gardner nonetheless feels content with indirectly blaming Beowulf with yet another death, and further allows his imagination to relate expired majesty with hideous monstrosity. But he does so without malicious intent. 
Agathon(1970), Grendel (1971), Tbe Sun­
Ught Dlalogues(1972), and Jason and 
Medela( 1973). 
Gardner's awards include the National 
Endowment of the Arts Award, Woordow 
Wilson Fellowship, Danforth Fellowship, 
and Guggenheim Fellowship for creative 
writing in fiction. 
Nickel MountaJn is both a religious and a 
love story, a story of Henry Starnes, a 
middle-aged man who runs a diner, and 
the girl he marries. In a Catskill mountain 
setting, ,Gardner tells what they meant to 
each other throughout the various states 
and the ups and downs of their lives. 
Critics say that Nickel MountaJn "seeks to 
celebrate what is best in humanness, the 
gift by which in our best moments we counter cosmic indifference and disorder, the love all human beings can sometimes feel for all that lives." In Time, Timothy Foote compares Nickel MountaJn to The Sunlight Dlalogui.J in the following man­ner: "If The Sunlight Dialogues was masterful in its paced switches from cops to robbers, philpsophers to magicians, bureaucrats to babblers, and if Gardner was proud to charm his snakey topic with every riff he knes, Nickel MountaJn is very different. Until the key scene in the new novel, Gardner modestly hides those riffs by giving characher a stolid life of its own and meaning anunchaperoned vulnerabili­
ty. 
Spring provides the background for The Resurrection, a book in which the main character, Professor James Chandler, moves his family back to Batavia, New York, his childhood home. "he has returned home to make peace with his past because a ruddy-faced doctor in California has put a limit on his future; an immutable deadline on knowing, on loving. There is little time. But as the ironies of fate conspire with the demands of ~rtality, ends forge beginnings-and death becomes a prelude to life.'' After the release of The Resurrection, Tbe New York Times :Book Review called Gardner a "philosophica-l novelist, concerned with conflicts of mind within a physical world." 
Agathon, the Seer, and Demopdakus, his disciple( the Peeker), tell The Wreckage of Agathon; these two narrators share a prison cell in ancient Sparta ruled by 
dauid beno 
tyrannous Lykowrgos. · 'Agathon, horny, foul-smelling, lame, mocks the world, its philosophical systems, its political virtues and his own vital history. Their prison cell is as much a metaphor as Sartre's in "No Exit". But it is more than that: it is a 'real' place, with corners, four walls, slop on the floor. 
Grendel can be considered a version of Beowuld which is written from the point of view of the title monster. Grendel is described as "warm, friendly, and compas­sionate ... a kind of Medieval King Kong." The National Observer asks the question, "Who's so funny? At times you may laugh at this 'pointless, ridiculous monster. crouched in the shadows, stinking of dean men, murdered children and martyured cows.' But with only slight introspection you will discover your laughter is directed not at Grendel, but at all mankind." 
Having been included on the New York Times Bestseller List for 14 weeks, The Sunlight Dialogues is considered a major American novel. The story takes place in Batavia,(upstate) New York (Gardner's own birthplace). 
In the epic poem Jason and Medela, one of Gardner's greatest accomplishments, 
Gardner retells-the famous  myth of the  
same  name.  Jason-the  hero- is  a  
Westerner,  an  intellectual,  a  politician,  

grakdson of death, while Medeia-who is in love with Jason-is a Easterner, passionate, and intuitive, a granddaughter of the Sun. 
Gardner presents the  'first detailed nd complete analysis" of the Wakefield pageant cycle in The Construction of the Wakefield Cycle; he celebrates the beauty of the cycle as a work of art and theorizes that it might have been developed by just one man-the Wakefield Master. 
Dragon, Dragon, and Other Tales, Gardner's latest book, is his first volume of tales for younger readers. Four suspense­ful fairy tales, sull of witches and dragons, in which Gardner combines the new and the traditional with a "slyly humorous, contemporary flare,'' comprise this collec­tion. 
Critics have widely .acclaimed Gardner's "reverence for ancient forms and perma­nent truths" and have labeled his "a man with a message." John Gardner brings that message to Notre Dame tonight. 

His suggestion is an academic one, and for Beowulf scholars, another important part of Beowulf's intricate interlace. 
Lewis Nicholson's own essay on Beowulf concludes the first section with an essay entitled "Hunlafing and the Point of the Sword'' in which he suggests that Hunlaf­ing is actually Hunferth. The implication and suggestion we are to draw from that is "then Hunferth's gift of a sword to Beowulf ... may be the same sword that was used at Finns burgh to_ kill brothers." Therefore the sword, being fratricidal and thus a weapon of personal betrayals, fails Beowulf in his fight against Grendel. This suggestion has further important implica­tions and, if true, illustrates more drama­tically the calculated genius behind Beo­wulf's extraordinary quality of interweave. 
The first section on "Secular Heroic Poetry" is followed by sections of criticism on "Religious Heroic Poetry", "The Lyric Tradition," "Biblical Narative," "The Runic Tradition," and "Wisdom Litera­ture." An essay by Dolores Frese is included under "The Runic Tradition" and invloves as the title ("The Art of Cynewulf Runic Signatures") infers, a discussing of Cynewulf's masked identity in his work. 
The list ot other contributors to the edition is impressive and particularly awesome. Some of the most outstanding names in the study of Anglo-Saxon Poetry are included here, and given voice to propose new interpretations etc of the Old English Masterpieces which continue to entertain us today. And all in honor of a patriarch of Medieval study who is ·still alive, although retired from professional life, and who has deservedly received the respect of his students and the homage this volume offers him.

Hearst jury to visit SLA crime scenes, hideouts 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -Mem­bers of the jury in the Patricia Hearst bank robbery trial prepared for a guided tour Monday of some places they have heard the defen­dant describe from the witness stand. But it was not certain whether the scene of the crime would be available for inspection because of the George Washington birthday holiday. 
Defense and prosecution attor­neys and U.S. District Court Judge Oliver J. Carter were scheduled to the SLA rob in April 1974 will be closed Monday, and bank officials had not said whether they would open it for court inspection. 
The trial was scheduled to re­sume Tuesday, and chief defense 
lawyer  F. Lee  Bailey  said  Miss  
Hearst  would  be  back  on  the  
witness  stand  to  conclude  her  
testimony.  

In an interview on ABC's "Is­sues and 1 Answers " broadcast Sunday, Bailey said that if the case group kidnapped her on Feb. 4, 1974, and the time the robbery took place about 10 weeks later. 
The prosecution has maintained that Miss Hearst was a willing participant in the robbery, but Bailey has said she was forced to help SLA "soldiers" in the holdup under a death threat. 
He said he would try to introduce evidence from lie detector tests to "show the objactive facts about her belief that first, she was under a constant fear of death, and second, she was told if she messed up in films of the robbery to laboratories for examination and those studies showed "that what appeared to be a smile on her face was really something quite different."

He said blowups of the T1ims aiso show that Miss Hearst spoke only the word 'Tania,'' the name she used in SLA communiques he says she was forced to record, during the holdup. A prosecution witness had testified that Miss Hearst shouted out orders in foul language during the holfup. 
Defense experts on brainwash­ing will testify after Miss Hearst leaves the stand, Bailey said. But he said it is not essential to his case to establish that his client was ~rainwashed into accepting SLA ideology and rejecting her family.

Challenges may be made 
By Mary Beth Mlracky 
Staff Reporter 
Anyone who thinks he has been denied "full and timely opportunity to participate" in the 1976 Mock Democratic Convention may chal­lenge the delegations certified by the State Parties according to the ··Procedures for the Credentials Committee." These procedures modeled on the 1976 call for the Democratic National ConventiOn were outlined by author and Cre­dentials Committee Chairperson Kevin J. Bouffard in an interview Monday. Also present was Delega­tion Coordinator James "Buzz" Reynolds. 
The challenges must be presen­ted to Bouffard at 121 Pangborn, phone 8325, by the full credentials committee meeting to be held on Sunday, February 22 in 127 Nieuw­land Science Hall at 6 p.m. 
Procedures require that the chal­lenge must have the signatures of at least three persons who were denied the right to participate through some violation of the National Democratic Party's "affir­mative action plan." According to the procedures, this plan is "to insure a proportional representa­tion of age, sex, and race among the delegation. 
Also stated in the procedures, "The challenge must be in the form of a resolution stating: (1) the reasons why the challenging party is discriminated against as a result of the actions of the State Party, and (2) the corrective action which the challenging party proposes to rectify the situation." 
The procedures offer as the solutions the replacement of the entire delegation or the promotion of alternated to full delegate status. 
·'The challenged party must also submit the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the challeng­ed delegated or State Chairperson" according to procedures. The document states: "FAilure to meet any of the above requirements is grounds for the challenge to be rejected out of hand by the Creden­tials Committee Chairperson."
