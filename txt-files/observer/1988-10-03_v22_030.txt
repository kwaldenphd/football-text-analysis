TALLINN, U.S.S.R.-­Members of an Estonian nationalist group accused the Kremlin on Sunday of sapping their republic's resources and demanded that Moscow give them greater control over their land and economy. 
Thousands of supporters cheered the speakers at the first congress of the fledgling People's Front. 
"We have been reduced to 
the level of slaves in a manor," 
farmer Enno Peets told more 
than 3,000 delegates. 
Some speakers objected to what they called the Kremlin's "colonialist" policy, which they said syphons off Estonia's agricultural output and 
Changes in Contra aid considered 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON--The Reagan 
administration expects to take 
advantage of a minor change 
in the new humanitarian aid 
package for the Contra rebels 
to institute a series of non­
military training programs de­
signed to make the insurgents 
more self -sufficient. 
The aid program that ex­
pired Friday said the adminis­
tration could use the $17.7 mil­
lion package "only" for food, 
clothing, medical services and 
shelter. 
The new $27 million six­
month package signed into. law 
by President Reagan Saturday 
calls for assistance in the same 
four areas but the word "only" 
has been deleted, permitting 
the administration greater 
flexibility in how the money is 
spent. 
In signing the $14.3 billion 
foreign aid bill, Reagan 
criticized what he said was a 
minimal amount of 
humanitarian aid for the Con­
tras. 
U.S. officials, insisting on anonymity, said they envision U .S.-sponsored "skills train­ing" in areas ranging from radio maintenance to record keeping, human rights and health care. 
The officials said such pro­grams should boost the morale of the thousands of rebels who are camped along the Honduran-Nicaraguan border with little to keep them occu­pied. 
Many of the rebels flocked to these camps from inside Nicaragua over the past six months to take advantage of the assistance programs being carried out in the border area

"These people are to blame for our suffering here, the lack of food here," delegate Albert Danielson told the audience at the Town Hall in Tallinn, the picturesque capital of this republic on the Baltic Sea. The two-day conference opened Saturday with an ad­ is key for Gorbachev, who is beset by unrest among the So­viet Union's more than 100 eth­nic groups. The stirrings have been particularly troublesome in the Baltic republics of Es­tonia, Lithuania and Latvia, and in the southern republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Soviet Union took over  up just 60 percent of the popu­lation. Delegates rejected a contro­versial proposal to encourage "remigration" of Russians and other non-Estonians living in the republic. The measure was politically explosive because thousands of Estonians themselves were

Bush and Quayle differ over arms 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK--Sen. Dan Quayle said the United States should make completion of a treaty on long-range nuclear weapons conditional on Soviet concessions on conventional arms, a position that differs from that of Vice President George Bush, The New York Times reported. 
In an interview reported in the newspaper's Sunday edi­tions, Quayle said he was worried the Soviets would not negotiate seriously on cutting conventional weapons if the two superpowers reach a prior agreement in their strategic arms reduction talks. 
"If we negotiate on START, what leverage do we have on conventional?'' Quayle told the Times. 
The Reagan administration has rejected the idea of linking talks on strategic nuclear arms with talks on conventional arms, saying it would delay completion of a strategic arms treaty. The Bush campaign has endorsed that position. 
Quayle said in the interview he would follow administration policy if he became vice pres­ident. 
"The view of the Bush cam­paign is that we are going to proceed with START, and we want to talk about conventional arms control," Quayle said. "But there has not been the linkage that I discussed." 
If Bush is elected President, Quayle said top officials "will 
sit down and discuss what the 
strategy is going to be" on nu­
clear and conventional arms is­
sues. 
Quayle, a member of the Sen­ate Armed Services Commit­tee, had not previously revealed these positions in the campaign, the Times said.

INSIDE COLUMN 
'Don't worry, be happy' is bad advice 
Bobby McFarrin may very well be a talented musician and a dazzling performer, but there is definitely something wrong with his song, "Don't Worry, Be Happy" because every time it comes on the radio, people cringe. 
This is more than a case of pop stations killing a song about living the good life like what hap­pened to Whitney's "GreatestLove of All." Bob­by's problem is his message itself... Who buys it? 
He probably does. But then, he can buy a lot. He's made more than a million dollars with four words. Why should he worry? 
Does he have twenty-six thousand dollars in college loans to pay off? Does he have a total of eleven dollars to his name, 9 of which are in a checking account for which he cannot find the checks? Or, has he just realized that after forty-thousand dollars and four years of college that he could make more money holding a road construction flag than in his chosen career field? 
Probably not. But we have all faced these questions in the college community and "Don't Worry, Be Happy" just doesn't cut it .as a .so­lution for gray hairs and ulcers. SociOlogists tell us that college-aged individuals face the most stress of all ages and maybe we could use a little of this simplistic advice, but deadlines, jobs and career plans kind of get in the way. 
Has his boss just told him that he could screw up a two-car parade? Did he have a Whitesnake song running through his head while he was trying not to think about the fact that he really had to go to the bathroom halfway through the LSAT exam on Saturday? Or did he try to drop a class he's never been to on Friday only to discover the last drop day was Thursday? 
Sure, if failing a class isn't something you'd mind too horribly, you probably shouldn't wor­ry. But most of us don't intend to go to school to fail. Yet it happens to the best of us, and most of the time, worrying does no good for the situation. But, like snow falling on South Bend, worrying about these things is unavoidable. 
They have a way of staring us in the eyes like 
a praying mantis or of sitting on our shoulders 
like a lead balloon. 

Sometimes, we realize that getting a 'D' in 
our major or attending "Choose a Major Night" 
as a Senior may very well be our fault, but in 
the face of realizing our mistakes, it's not likely 
that we're going to tell ourselves to be happy 
and not worry about it. People associate a 
worry-free life with being a 'blow-off'. A worry­
free life is potentially hazardous when you fail 
a Music Appreciation exam for the sake of Mar­
guaritaville, or when you declare yourself one too many academic holidays only to return to class and be handed a blue book by surprise. 

Maybe we shoud have been worrying all along about these things instead of the other things we worry about. The song has a point, in this case. No, we should not worry about being told that last night's date resembled a sweaty pig from Guam, or which color socks best matches khaki pants. These things just don't matter, and they are things that we worry about. 
It may be stupid, it may be productive, but it's definitely unavoidable. That's why his point is moot and frustrating for people in a strive­to-succeed environment. 
People don't exactly have control over whe­ther or not they will worry. Things just come up and to live life without reacting to them in some way is virtually impossible. 
Society doesn't work that way, either. If we don't worry, won't get anywhere, and if we don't get anywhere, we won't be happy, becuase our reward structure isn't built to advance those of us who take off for Jamaica in the face of dis­aster and social responsibility. 
And, you can bet that Bobby doesn't totally buy into it, either. Mter all, making it in the music business means more than being a one­time-wonder, and the pressure is on for him to do another song. Don't worry, Bobby, now that you have annoyed your public, be happy.

Racial problems in South Africa remain 
Associated Press 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa--Government officials are elated by the success of their diplomatic offensive into black Africa, but foes of apar­theid said Sunday the cam­paign does nothing to resolve domestic racial problems. 
"Africa is talking to South Africa," President P. Botha said after meeting Saturday with President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire. It was Botha's third summit with a black African leader in three weeks. 
City Press, South Africa's largest-selling black newspa­per, described the visit to Zaire as "sheer hypocrisy." An offi­cial of the African National Congress guerrilla movement condemned Mobutu for agree­ing to meet Botha. 
Foreign Minister Pik Botha and the president said on the flight from Zaire that the in­creasingly open contacts be­tween South Africa and its black neighbors discredited the sanctions campaign waged against South Africa by West­ern countries opposed to apar­theid. 
Apartheid establishes a ra­cially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the

economy and maintain sepa­rate districts, schools and health services. 
"I have often stated that South Africa has something to convey to Africa, and espe­cially to southern Africa," President Botha said. "Now, suddenly, it seems they are coming to grips with this truth." 
City Press, in an editorial Sunday, said, "What is the point of achieving peace and stability with neighbors when your own country is engulfed in flames?" 
Apartheid must be abolished and negotiations held with legitimate black leaders, City Press said. "Until these mini­mum demands are met, Mr. Botha can tour the rest of Africa as much as he likes ­peace will not come to this country." 
Stanley Mabizela, the ANC's chief representative in Zim­babwe, said African leaders should shun Botha because he "executes people who are vic­tims of an inhuman society, as well as political prisoners." 
The summit also drew criticism in Zaire, where troops fired warning shots to disperse university students protesting Botha's visit. 
Contras 
continued from page 1 
by the Agency for International Development. 
No deliveries were made in­side Nicaragua because agree­ment could not be reached with the Sandinista government on an acceptable delivery system. 
The officials said they expect opposition to the proposed training programs from mem­bers of Congress hostile to the Contras who don't want them to survive as a viable organi­zation. 
The prospects for a renewal of military aid for the rebels are not good. The aid package, initially approved by the Sen­ate in August, authorized the release of $16.5 million in stock­piled military equipment under certain conditions. 
But the funds would require congressional approval before adjournment of the current ses­sion, and there is only about a week left before members go home until the next session starts in January.

NEW YORK--Three Haitian 
soldiers armed with rifles who 
forced their way onto an Amer­
ican Airlines jetliner in Haiti 
were arrested Saturday when 
the plane landed at Kennedy 
Airport, officials said. 
No one was injured in the in­
cident, said American Airlines 
spokesman Jim Brown. The 
three men had surrendered 
their weapons before the 
were waiting when the plane, 
with 224 passengers and a crew 
of nine, arrived about 8:15p.m 
in New York. The three men 
were arrested without incident, 
Brown said. 
"They intended no harm to 
anyone, there was no threat of 
violence," said James Fox, 
director of the FBI's New York 
office. "They just said they 
wanted to leave Haiti for New 
York City." 
American Airlines Flight 658 
took off at 4:40p.m. after the 
three soldiers slipped under a 
wire fence that surrounds Port­

airport employees said.

said the men made no political 
statements. 
Eric Boucicault, director American Airlines in Haiti, said "three soldiers on duty en­tered at the end of the line of passengers with a determined air. We could not refuse their entrance. As a result of negotiation, they deposited all their arms, pistols and rifles, in the pilot's cabin. 
"Now they are seated calmly in their seats, and normal ser­vice is being maintained," he said before the airplane landed in New York. 
Flight 658 runs daily between New York and the capital city of Port-au-Prince, where it ar­rives about 2 p.m. and leaves after 4 p.m. 
"The pilot did a super job," said passenger Cameron Smith of Boston. "He negotiated a deal with them. He put them up in first class and tended to them the rest of the way." 
Other passengers were not immediately let off the plane as authorities questioned them. The approximately 200 people who were waiting for the flight's arrival said they were not told about the incident until the plane landed. 
Haiti has been beset by tur­moil in recent weeks. 
Navy and Air Force fighter and attack jets are not out of line, according to officials. Indeed, they said the Navy is actually enjoying one of its all-time safest years for aviation. 
Accident spurts involving the Navy's F-14s and the Air Force's F-16s have prompted both services to launch careful monitoring campaigns. 
The Air Force said it has found no equipment problems, but has changed some of its pilot training techniques and increased supervision because of the rise in mishaps. 
Officials said last year's F -16 accidents involved pilots who lost consciousness as a result of fast aerial maneuvers or who became disoriented and lost track of where they were.

For some people, living out the mes­sage of one's faith can be another mo­tivation to become a volunteer. Living out the message of one's faith can take many different forms. The commit­ment to volunteer your services to a marginalized community is not an easy choice. It requires the denial of the life­style you have grown accustomed to and an embracing of an often radically different lifestyle. What's the point in rejecting all the material things you and your family worked so hard to gain? There is no easy answer. There is a feeling though. A feeling of solidarity and an attempt to under­stand, from the inside out, a part of society that is rarely given a voice. 
And one does not need to necessarily go to a foreign country to feel the effects of living on the margins of society, of being a minority. Perhaps even more revealing is for one to enter a commu­nity in one's own country in which one is a minority. To perceive that you are being prejudged by someone who knows nothing about you personally can be disconcerting to say the very least. To realize this is to open your heart and mind to a whole new perspective on cul­ture, politics and economics among other things. 
Another aspect of volunteering that provides an invaluable experience is community living. If my housemates and I learn nothing this year, we will at least have learned the meaning of flexibility. Five persons and one car necessitates some clever planning and a lot of give-and-take. community living also provides a forum for more learning. An experience is worth very

little unless it is absorbed and looked at critically. My housemates and I pro­vide each other with opposing views which cause us to reevaluate our own positions. 
Reading over what I had already written, one of my housemates pointed out that I was not conveying adequately what we had thus far experienced be­cause I had failed to mention the "fun" side of the story. Sometimes we are blind to the obvious. "The toughest job you'll ever love" slogan comes to mind. The five of us are involved in several different programs in a community lo­cated fifteen minutes from San Juan. 
Our separate projects include or­ganizing a cooperative of local artisans, running a soup kitchen for the elderly, and beginning a library program to en­courage children to read. Every after­noon for three hours the five of us also tutor children after school in various subjects. It is hard to describe the inner joy that is felt when that fifteen-year­old comes to you and tells you that he wants to learn how to tell time. Or when the old toothless woman grins from ear to ear when she sees you coming to the door with her lunch. And I cannot forget to mention the time and experiences shared with my new "family." Getting a flat tire at dusk down at the docks and discovering then that we had no jack or spare tire was only one of many. We have begun a year together that has already been and promises to be filled with new and exciting learning and growing experiences.

"Why volunteer?" Sitting around the kitchen table after dinner, my four housemates and I here in Puerto Rico quickly decided that was the fundamen­tal question this article should address. Over two hours later we had a list two pages long of reasons why we chose volunteer work as a post graduate op­tion. Perhaps the most important con­clusion we made is that there are many different reasons why one may choose to commit himself to a volunteer pro­gram as well as a variety of types of volunteer programs available. Post Grad Volunteer night at the Center for Social Concerns provides the potential volunteer with an opportunity to be­come better acquainted with several different programs.

guest column 

What would motivate a senior in col­lege, finishing up four years of prepa­ration for the work world or graduate school, to devote a year or two to volun­teering? The choice to volunteer is not always an easy one. For every senior sure of his or her decision to volunteer, there are several unsure of whether their desire to volunteer is a wise one. Institutions and family expectations cham,el JS in certain dil ·ctions. and break mg the pattern of th!S process is oJot lllwayf: Pasy Some people will say that doing volunteer work is a waste of a year better spent gaining work expe­rience or continued schooling. But how can a year spent facing personal chal­lenges and opening oneself up to new environments be denied its inherent value? In the short six weeks we have been here, we can only marvel at how much we have learned, not only about the people we are working with, but also about ourselves. 
Volunteer work also should not nec­essarily be viewed as a career ''break,'' an interim between other endeavors. Several of my housemates, for exam­ple, have approached this year as a nat­ural step in careers such as economics and law. Statistics and graphs can tell an economist all he thinks he needs to know about an area's economic char­acter. But let him talk to a family living at the poverty level, and he will ap­proach his material the next time in a very different manner. 
No study or statistic tells the full story. So much more insight is gained through direct contact. For example, our situation here in Puerto Rico has made us aware of the colonial syndrome typical to most Third World nations as we had never understood it before. The colonial experience has left an indelible mark on the Puerto Rican people and accounts for many cultural attitudes that are misunderstood by foreigners. Learning about the Ameri­can role here has also caused us to take a critical look at ourselves as members of a nation whose political, economic and cultural dominance is staggering. 

Senior Reflection proves rewarding 
Dear Seniors: 

The Senior Reflection Groups are an outstanding opportunity for seniors to meet and discuss some common inter­ests and feelings as they near the end of their four years at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. We feel that it is our duty to make you aware of this potentially great experience so that you do not pass it up. This is a unique way of getting involved and reflecting on our college life and future plans. 
The group, consisting of six male and

six female students, meets twice this semester and four times next semester at a faculty member's house. Home­cooked meals are prepared by the stu­dents and the atmosphere is very relax­ing and fun. This is not necessarily a religious experience--it is a chance for you to converse and encounter fellow classmates in our final year. So, if this sounds as interesting and exciting as it really is, please stop by the Center For Social Concerns before Oct. 7 and prepare yourself for a truly stimulating experience.

Rice 
continued from page 16 
Reggie Ho and a goal-line stand by the Stanford defense to end the first quarter kept the Car­dinal in the game longer than it might have been. 
But Stanford quarterback Brian Johnson fumbled the snap on the first play after the goal-line stand, and Notre Dame's Ned Bolcar recovered the ball on the Cardinall-yard line. 
This time the Irish crossed the goal line, as Mark Green jumped over 16 seconds into the second period. Rice added the two-point conversion on a keeper and the rout was on. 
"When they stopped us at the goal line and got the ball back, and then fumbled on the very next play, that was big," Holtz said. "That got the team up. I'm not saying it turned the game around, because itdidn't. I thought we controlled the foot­ball game." 
The Irish amassed 332 rush­ing yards to Stanford's 59. Car­dinal running back John Volpe was the only Stanford player with positive net rushing yards, gaining 67 on 17 carries. 
Green gained 63 yards on 10 carries for the Irish. Sopho­more tailback Tony Brooks (12 carries, 59 yards) scored from five yards out, dragging Stan­ford defender Mike Newton with him most of the way, to make the score 21-0 in the second quarter. 
Rice's passing touchdown was a three-yard toss to fresh­man tight end Derek Brown on the first drive of the third quar­ter. Brown and split end Pat Eilers each caught two passes, while sophomore flanker Ricky Watters led the Irish with four receptions for 51 yards. 
Stanford's run-and-shoot of­fense managed 215 passing yards, 158 coming from back­up quarterback Jason Palumbis. Palumbis replaced Brian Johnson early in the third quarter and was 16-of-23 with a touchdown pass. 
But Notre Dame was again overpowering behind its young offensive line, which continues to erase any early-season doubts about its ability to replace all five starters from last year. 
"We had a great challenge coming into this game," junior guard Tim Grunhard said. "They have two all-American candidates in (Ray) Huckes­tein and (Andy) Papathanas­siou, and we took that as our challenge. But we like knock­ing people in the dirt. I guess they learned that the hard

Season ends with Boggs, Gwynn regaining titles 
Associated Press 
Tony Gwynn of the San Diego Padres won his second con­secutive National League bat­ting title, this time with the lowest average in the league's 120-year history, and Wade Boggs of the Boston Red Sox led the American League in hit­ting for the fourth consecutive year. 
Gwynn, who didn't play Sun­day, batted .313, 57 points less than his league-leading batting average last year. Larry Doyle of the New York Giants had the previous lowest average for an NL champion, batting .320 in 1915. 
"There are so many domi­nant pitchers this year," Gwynn said. "There is a whole list of pitchers who have dominated. Last year they said pitching was down, but it's not this year." 
Boggs, who also did not play Sunday, batted .366 and be­came the first AL player to win four consecutive batting titles since Rod Carew of Minnesota from 1972 through 1975. The only AL player with more con­secutive batting titles was Ty Cobb, who won nine straight from 1907 through 1915. 
"It's my fourth in a row. You want to be the best and that's the way to measure it, so it's very gratifying," Boggs said. 
Boggs had 214 hits, becoming the first player this century to get 200 hits in six consecutive seasons. 
A year after offense reached record levels, pitching dominated. There were 3,180 
home  runs,  a  28.7  percent  
decrease  from  last  year's  
record of 4,458.  

There were just five .300 hit­ters in the NL, the fewest since 1968. The AL average dropped from .261 to .259. The NL average fell from .265 to .248.

HOUSTON --Hal Lanier was fired as manager of the Astros Sunday after a disappointing season that ended with Houston losing 13 of its final17 games. 
Lanier, 46, said he was told about an hour before the game, a 5-1 loss to the San Diego Padres. Fired along with Lanier were third-base coach Denis Menke, bullpen coach Mark Hill and hitting instruc­tor Gene Clines.

New York Mets led the NL with 39 homers. Jose Canseco of the Oakland Athletics led the AL with 42 and also had 40 stolen bases, becoming the first 40-40 player in major league history. 
Kirby Puckett of the Min­nesota Twins finished second to 
Astros fire Lanier after 4-13 finish 
in baseball," Astros owner John McMullen said in a state­ment distributed in the press box at the start of the ninth in­ning. "It is the culmination of all the possible pressure on an individual. Hal Lanier has been a first-class citizen and done many positive things for the or­ganization. We feel at this time, however, it is best to wipe the slate clean and start over again." 
"I've had three great years with this club but this is not a happy time for anyone," 
-------Lanier said. "However, I don't 
hold any bitterness toward anyone. Dr. McMullen had a job to do. He and I have been friends and we'll continue to be friends. I think I'm the best competitor in this game. John McMullen just felt there needed to be a change. 
"He has the right to be dis­appointed. He was committed that we wanted to have a pen­nant winner. We were still in the race in September but I Boggs with a .356 average, the highest by a right-handed bat­ter in the AL since Joe DiMag­gio hit .357 in 1941 for the New York Yankees. Puckett's 234 hits were the most by a right­handed hitter in the AL since Al Simmons of the Philadelphia Athletics has 253 in 1925 and the most for a right-hander in either league since Ducky Med­wick of the Cardinals had 237 in 1937. 
The Twins drew 3,030,672, be­coming the first AL club to top 3 million and the fourth major league team to do so. On the field, the Twins made just 84 errors, the fewest ever for a major-league team. The previ­ous record of 95 was set by Bal­timore in 1964 and tied by Cincinnati in 1977 and Bal­timore in 1980. 
The Boston Red Sox commit­ted just 93 errors this season. And of course there was a record for balks. 
don't think any manager could have come in here and won the way we were scoring runs." 
"I can't see anything ever being tougher than this," gen­eral manager Bill Wood said. "However, the manager is the chief on the field. He sets the tone and direction of the team and we just didn; t get it done this year. We thought we had overcome some of our prob­lems but they seemed to bubble up to the surface even more than before." · 
Lanier's fiery, aggressive style of baseball seemed to re­charge the Astros in 1986. Lanier was named manager Nov. 5, 1985, promising the same wide-open base running attack he learned as a third­base coach under Whitey Her­zog in St. Louis. 
The Astros won the West Division by 10 games but lost to the New York Mets in a six­game playoff, dropping the final game in 16 innings.

Men upset Providence at National Catholic meet 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO Sports Writer 
The men's cross country team has done it again, starting off as the underdog and finish­ing as the victor, this time at the 9th Annual National Catho­lic meet. 
Tl)e meet, held on Friday at a specially desisned five-mile circuit at the Burke Memorial Golf Course, saw the Irish emerge victorious, accumulat­ing a meet-low 46 points. 
Second place finisher Loyola (Ill.) collected 75 points, and Providence finished at a dis­tant third with 96. 
Was this a big upset? "I think it is," said Head Co­ach Joe Piane, who is also the 
director of the meet. "I didn't expect that much of a margin between ourselves and Provi­dence. Providence has an out­standing team, but our runners did an excellent job." 
Providence entered the race as the favorite, with Loyola a close second. However, the Irish runners proved to be too much for them, taking three of the top ten spots and four of the top eleven. 
Included in those top-ten finishes were senior captain Dan Garrett and senior Ron Markezich, who tied for first place, uncontested, with times of 24:39. 
Junior Tom O'Rourke came through in sixth place with a strong time of 25: 13, and junior Mike O'Connor finished in 11th at za:Ju. 
Freshman Mike Drake had an impressive meet, finishing the race in 26:08, which was good enough for 26th place. 
Sophomore Matt Ronzone finished 32nd with a time of 26:15, and classmate Ryan Cahill finished 40th at 26:32, but was slightly bothered with an injury. 
The ease with which the Irish won came as a surprise to al­most everybody, especially considering their times were not the greatest. 
"Dan (Garrett) and I were suprised that no one really challenged us that hard," said Markezich. "Our plan was to pick up the pace after about 2 1-2 miles, but no one was there. We didn't have to pick up our speed at all." 

"We had the capability of finishing four in the top seven,'' said Piane. "I know it sounds arrogant, but I don't mean to be. We have a really good club." 
Piane can only hope that their times can be much better, considering that the Notre Dame Invitational takes place this Friday, and they will need better times than they had last Friday to win. 
The Irish will also have to avoid any more injuries, con­sidering that senior Rick Mul­vey and sophomore Pat Kearns are out of action. Mulvey's sit­uation continues to improve, 
but he most likely will not be 
able to run at the Notre Dame 
Invitational. 
Michigan and East Tennes­see in particular will make things difficult on the Irish to repeat their finishes from the National Catholic. 
"We were up for it (the Na­tional Catholic), but we really didn't run that well," said Gar­rett. "If we don't get our act together, we're going to get killed at the Notre Dame Invi­tational.'' 
"We're pleased we won, but we know we have to improve to win on Friday," said O'rourke. "We have to run more as a team, with less of a gap in between our first and fifth man."

defense shut down Buffalo, 
handing the Bills a 24-3 loss 
on Sunday, their first of the

McMahon completed 20 of

"Good teams have to be able to win on the road," says UCLA coach Terry Donahue. And seven members of the Associ­ated Press Top Twenty, led by second-ranked UCLA and No. 3 Southern California, did just that. 
In Seattle, a place they hadn't won in their last three visits, the UCLA bruins needed a 48-yard pass play from Troy Aikman to Reggie Moore with 
1:28 left to beat No. 16 Wash­ington 24-17. 
Southern Cal had an easier time in Tucson. Rodney Peete threw three touchdown passes to Erik Affholter, leading the Trojans to a 38-15 victory over Arizona. 
UCLA and Southern Cal are 4-0, as is No. 20 Oregon, a 34-13 winner at San Diego State. However, Saturday's game was the Bruins' first Pac-10 contest while USC and Oregon are 2-0. 
Meanwhile, No. 1-ranked Miami pounded Missouri 55-0, fourth-ranked Auburn ham­mered North Carolina 47-21 and No. 5 Notre Dame trounced Stanford 42-14.

The Giants, 3-2, held a 24-9 lead in the third quarter, but allowed Washington to pull within a point on two touch­down passes from Mark Rypien to Ricky Sanders. The comeback was aided by a defense that sacked Phil Simms five times, including four by Dexter Manley.

cleverly placed sets that al­
lowed her hitters to find the 
holes in the Bronco defense. 
And the Irish hitters took full 
advantage of the sets, as Ben­
nett recorded an astounding 
.714 hitting percentage on 14 
kills, with Waller following 
close behind with a .682 
percentage on 16 kills. 
The team as a whole had an 
impressive .469 hitting 
percentage for the match and matched their strong offensive performance with defensive hustle as well. 
Bennett tallied nine total blocks and senior Maureen Shea added seven as the Irish outblocked the Broncos 13-6 for the match and Shewman and Bennett picked up 14 and 13 digs, respectively. 
"Art's got a great team," said Bronco head coach Rob Buck. "They've got at least 10­12 strong, really good athletes and they've definitely im­proved from last year. They took advantage of our errors and just played with more con­fidence." 
The Irish had every reason to be confident, coming off of

Friday's trouncing of Butler. 
It took Notre Dame only 44 
minutes to completely annihi­
late Butler in three games, 15-2, 
15-2 and 15-8, as the Bulldogs 
could only manage a paltry .028 
hitting percentage for the 
match. 
Irish dominated game one, 
establishing a 10-1 lead behind 
a two-man army of Bennett and 
Waller, before the Bulldogs 
realized what hit them. 
And just about every Irish 
player did hit the Bulldogs, as 
the team recorded a .600 hitting 
average for the game with only 
one error. 
Game two gave Butler much 
of the same, as Shea, Shew­
man, Waller and Bennett as­
sualted the Butler defense, 
which could only manage two 
team blocks for the entire 
game, with an errorless .733 
team hitting percentage. 
The entire Notre Dame roster saw action before the end of game three after Waller and Bennett left the game with 10 and six kills, respectively be­hind hitting percentages of .692 and .833. 
Junior Kathy Cunningham and sophomores Rachel Hall and Jai Bruno all recorded im­pressive .667 hitting percent­ages for the match and Shea followed close behind with .625.
