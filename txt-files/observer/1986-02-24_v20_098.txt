Reagan plan requests reduction of missiles 
WASHINGTON -In a formal reply to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's arms control proposal, President Reagan has drafted a sweeping plan urging elimination of medium range missiles In Europe as a first step, a LJ.S. official says. 
The official, speaking on condi­tion of anonymity, said Reagan's proposal was contained in a letter signed over the weekend that would be mailed 10 Gorbachev at the beginning of the week. A presiden· tial statement to the nation also is planned, he said. 
White House spokesman Ben Jar­rett confirmed Saturday that the White House was circulating Reagan's plan to ll.S. allies, key Congress members, and the ll.S. arms negotiating team in Geneva. He declined to say when the letter would be sent to Gorbachev or dis­~:.·uss Its contents. 
Reagan's proposal to eliminate medium range missiles "holds out the hope of earliest progress," the other official told the Associated Press. 
The official said Rl·agan also proposed that the more than 100 mobile SS-20 missiles the Soviets haw deployed in their Asian tl·r­rilories he reduced to very low num­hl·rs. These missiles are targeted on China and Japan and were not in­cluded in the disarmament proposal Gorbachev made Jan. 1t;_ 
The United States has deployed 2:~6 Pershing II and cruise missiles in West Ciermany, Britain and Italy, all aimed at Soviet territory. Even­tual installation of t;72 missiles is planned. The Soviets. meanwhile, have about 300 SS-20s targeted at Western Europe. 



Marcos denies claims that rebellious troops forced him into exile 
Associated Press 
MANILA, Philippines -President Ferdinand Marcos appeared on na­tional television today in a live broadcast, and said claims by rebels that he was preparing to leave the country were an effort to frighten the people. 
Radio Veritas, the Roman Catholic church station that has been a staunch critic of Marcos, had said he was leaving the country. 
Marcos appeared with his wife, Imelda, and some ofhis children and· grandchildren around him. 
"Don't believe any of these stories," said Marcos, calling the reports "propaganda lies they are peddling through the air waves." 
"They (the reports) are com­pletely without basis. hey are in­tended to frighten our people," Marcos said, directing his men to "use all necessary force" to defend their installations. 
He directed soldiers to use small arms to defend themselves but said big weapons like tanks and armored personnel carriers should not be employed "as yet." 
"I appeal to civilians to get out of the line of fire," Marcos said. 
Several local and foreign reporters were in the hall with Marcos, and the president said this would prove the broadcast was not taped in advance 
As Marcos spoke, thousand ofstu­dents chanted the name of opposi­tion leader Corazon Aquino outside his heavily guarded palace. 
Radio Veritas had broadcast state­ments by the two rebel military offi­cials, former Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos, the former deputy armed forces chief, who said "tyranny" had been defeated. 
The Radio Veritas announcer then said Marcos was leaving the country. Sources at the presidential palace told reporters that Marcos wa.'l res­ting. 
In a battle of broadcasts, the government television replied: "the government remains in full control ofthe situation." 
Announcer Thelma Dumpit said on the government's Channel 4 that her report came from Information Minister Gregorio Cendana, who did not appear. 
An Associated Press correspon­dent said some soldiers at the presidential palace were wearing white armbands, but they refused to talk with journalists. Rebels have said soldiers wishing to surrender or join the revolt should wear white bands. 
Drivers of vehicles passing the palace honked horns and crowds gathered around the barricades. 
An official at the ll.S. embassy said, "I don't have any confirmation that he (Marcos) has left." He added that es are "more fluid this morning than they were yesterday." The offi­cial, contacted by phone, spoke on condition ofanonymity. 
In Washington, U.S. state Depart­ment spokesman Warren Magruder said, "We've heard those reports (of Marcos leaving) too, but we can't confirm them." 
Meanwhile, battle-dressed marines, firing tear gas and swinging truncheons, attacked clvlllans man­ning street barricades outside the military camp where Ramos and Enrile were entrenched. 
The marines dispersed hundreds of people supporting two senior military officials in an adjacent military camp who are demanding

Minority awareness topic of unity week 
Station managers intend to resign after ban on homosexual message 
By MARK PANKOWSKI 
AssistantNews Editor 
The station managers at both student-run radio stations have an­nounced their Intentions to resign after the administration told WSND­FM to stop running a public service announcement from a homosexual organization, said Vito Gagliardi, ex­ecutive news director of WSND-FM and WVFI-AM. 
Although neither WVFI-AM sta­
tion manager Reginald Daniel nor 
WSND-FM station manager Eileen 
Ridley has submitted a written 
resignation, both were absent at an 
executive board meeting yesterday, 
Gagliardi said. 
In addition, Daniel "is no longer 
fulfilling his responsibilities as the 
AM director or even his shifts as disc 
jockey," Gagliardi said. "I believe 
the same is true for her (Ridley)." 
Daniel and Ridley's resignations 
become effective Friday, the same 
day their terms as station managers 
previously had been scheduled to end, said Gagliardi, who learned thursday of their intentions to resign. 
Daniel declined comment, as did Ridley, who said that "the issue has not been resolved." 
The station managers' announce­ment came after Assistant Vice Presi­dent for Student Services Father Francis Cafarelli met with Ridley last week and told her that ad­ministrators no longer wanted WSND-FM disc jockeys to read an announcement from a group named 
Gays  and  Lesbians  at  Notre  
Dame/Saint  Mary's  <::ollege,  
Gagliardi said.  
Cafarelli  declined  to  comment,  

saying It was "premature to talk about it publicly." He did say, however, that he was not aware of Daniel and Ridley's intention to resign. 
After Cafarelll's meeting with Rid­ley, WSND-FM disc jockeys stopped reading the homosexual group's an­nouncements, he said. 
Cafarelli met with Gagliardi Friday and told the news director that several administrators, includ­ing University President Father Theodore Hesburgh, had received complaints about the announce­ments on the FM station, Gagliardi said. 
Cafarelli "only bannned the an­nouncement on the FM station be­cause that's the only station he was gettiflg complaints on," said Gagliardi. 
According to WVFI-AM disc jockey Tim Adams, however, WVFI­AM also had run the announce­ments. In addition, "there were a few occasions when ( WVFI-AM) DJs did not read the announcement In a straightforward way," said Adams. 
Adams added that he did not know whether WSND-FM disc jock­eys had failed to read the announce­ment In a serious manner. 
According to Gagliardi, Cafarelll and other administrators' reason for banning the announcement was

In an effort to create a better understanding of the status of minority students, two campus groups are teaming up to present "A Focus on llnity Week" today through March l. 
The purpose of the week Is to make Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students aware of the lack of unity between minorities and other students, as well as the lack of unity among the different minority groups themselves, ac­~:.·ordlng to Beth McCahill, ex­ecutive coordinator for student government. 
"We want students to know that it's everyone's responsibility to help out in unifying the gap between minorities and stu­dents," said McCahill. 
She added, "A lot of students are not aware that the campus Is 92 percent white and only 3 per­cent Hispanic and 2 percent black. This should strike some students. Hopefully, through some statistics presented in the media and through a few rallies with guest speakers, we will be able lO bring to light how reveal­ing and Important these .statistics really are." 

Another minority group that will be participating in the aware­ness week is the Black Cultural Arts Council. The BCAC co­President Usa Boykin said she feels there is a necessity for some type of minority awareness week at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
"In my opinion, there is a major problem at Notre Dame," Boynkin said. "There is a lack of unity even among the different minority groups and this makes It hard to get the various groups

Junior Parents' Weekend more than meals, speeches 
I am neither a junior nor a parent, but despite beingin the minority this weekend of those who were, Junior Parents' Weekend had more meaning to me than simply directing an invasion of people to LaFortune Center or the bookstore. 
Sure, Junior Parents' Weekend is filled with a great deal ofsmall talk and introductions, speeches you have heard somewhere before, and yet another showing of "Wake Up The Echos," but beneath the superficial aspects of the weekend, there is something more. 
From an outsider's point of view of the festivities, juniors and parents gathered for more than the sole purpose of eating and drinking. in fact, JPW seems to serve as a time for parents to look into a world which they previously knew only from a distance, a world in which their children have lived for almost three years. 
Although JPW may appear as simply an extension of the annual high school or grade school "parent/teacher" night, in that situation parents faced the prospect of hearing "Johnny just doesn't behave

Parents hear those stories that they otherwise wouldn't hear: when they knocked on Father Hes­burgh's office door at midnight or when they were found sound asleep on the floor after a very long all­nighter.

Al­though parents get glimpses of these changes at home during school breaks, JPW offers an environment of which the parents are not ac­customed, an environment far removed from the area they grew up in. Parents are the guests of their children for an entire weekend; they are not here to serve as dorm room movers or to run endless errands to the local Kroger's and University Park Mall. 
For alumni and regular football tailgaters, this is not another hectic visit to the campus. It seems JPW is meant to be a relaxing weekend where parents and stu­dents can just get to know each other on a more equal basis. 
For almost three years most parents only can catch glimpses of their child's successes and failures at Notre Dame. Now they get to meet their junior's friends.

everyone has a good time; 
the reason is money. Be­cause of JPW, more people can finance spring break travel every y~ear. More students are able to work on their Florida tans. 
Of course, most students choose to work or leave town since there is generally nothing else to do on campus that weekend. 
Campus security once again becomes understanding as you are not obliged to provide next ofkin before the gate guard lets you pass and student cars are free to use on-campus parking lots whether there are parents in

stances). 
Of course the most significant point to make about 
Junior Parents' Weekend for those who are not juniors 
is that it marks the end of the very un~xciting month of

Everyone seems to benefit from JPW somehow. For 
this sophomore, it makes me look forward to next year.

Congress to eye Nicaraguan aid while Reagan pleads for defense 
WASHINGTON · Much of the debate in Congress this week will focus on President Reagan's am· bitious plans for military spending and his expected request for S I 00 million in aid to Nicaraguan rebels. 
Legislators also are expected to renew their denunciations of fraud in the Feb. 7 Philippine presidential election and press calls for President Ferdinand Marcos to step aside. 
Meanwhile, the leaders of the House and Senate budget commit· tees will be taking some informal, preliminary steps that could set the stage for movement toward a bipar­tisan budget compromise. 
On Wednesday, Reagan is scheduled to deliver a nationally broadcast address to discuss his views on military spending and make a pitch for gaining congres­sional approval of no million in military aid and 130 million in economic assistance for the rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist regime. 
Faced with a skeptical Congress, the president has participated in a series of events aimed at building support for the aid. 
Last Thursday, the president briefly visited Grenada, where U.S. 

Domenici: budget law fatalistic 
As!loclated Press 
WASHINGTON · The chair­man of the Senate budget com· mittee told the nation's governors yesteray that the balanced-budget law is "a planned train wreck," but he voiced optimism that Congress would act to avoid scheduled, automatic spending cuts. 
Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said the odds are better than SO· 'iO that Congress will "pull the switch and the wreck will be avoided," by passing its own budget that meets the deficit· reduction targets of the Gramm­Rudman balanced-budget law. 
"It is best analogized as a planned train wreck. No one

troops participated in a military ac­tion to remove a Marxist junta in 1983. Administration officials, making arguments for ald to the Nicaraguan rebels, have pointed to Grenada as an example of how com· munist influence can be turned back in this hemisphere. 
On Saturday, Reagan said in his 

weekly radio address, "Helping 
those fighting for their own freedom 
in Nicaragua is both morally right 
and vital to our own national 
security. 
"If the communists consolidate 

their power, their campaign of 
violence throughout central 
America will go into high gear, 
bringing new dangers and sending 
hundreds of thousands of refugees 
streaming toward our 2,000-mile­
long southern border," the presi­
dent said. 
Today, administration officials are 

expected to release an intercepted 
Nicaraguan government document 
outlining a campaign of misinforma· 
tion aimed at influencing U.S. policy. 
House Speaker Thomas O'NeillJr., D-Mass., has said that carrying out the administration plan for aid would only bring "slaughter and 
would plan a train wreck, but we did," Domenici said. 
Domenici, speaking to the ex­ecutive committee of the Na­tional Governors Association, said the final budget solution may include some additional tax revenues to "glue it all together." 
But Domenici, who offered few details of what he thought the budget would look like, said a major increase in taxes for the purpose ofreducing the deficit is unlikely, even if included in a package ofoverall tax reform. 
Domenici spoke as the gover­nors began their annual winter meeting. They were attending a black-tie dinner and reception at the White House in the evening, and were going back to the ex· humiliation" of the rebels, resulting in "disaster and shame" that would lead to the introduction of U.S. troops in Nicaragua. 
House Majority Leader Jim Wright, D-Texas, is expected to deliver a similar message in the for­mal Democratic response following Reagan's Wednesday night address. 
O'Neill, Wright and other senior Democrats have said that instead of military aid, the United States should be doing more to foster negotiations among the nations in the region. 
The president also is expected to use his speech on Wednesday to dis­cuss his request for 1320.3 billion in military spending authority for the fiscal year beginnins Oct. 1. That would be about an 8 percent in­crease· after accounting for inflation · from the current level Congress ap­proved last December.

An Associated Press survey of the governors found a substantial majority opposing a federal tax increase to whittle at the federal budget deficit, or at least saying any boost in taxes ought to be only a last resort. They were also opposed to cutbacks in Social Security to lower deficits.

Researcher says smoking habits causing shorter female life spans 
PITfSBURGH-Women are losing their life expectancy advantage over men becauseofthe growing number offemale smokers, not because ofin­creased stress, a researcher said Saturday. 
"The life expectancy of men and women will be about the same in the next 4(, to 50 years," said Gus Miller, director of Studies on Smoking Inc., a non-profit group in EBORO. 
"Firstly, women are smoking more Secondly, men in the older age have been quitting smoking double the rate of women, so they are living longer," he said in a telephone interview. 
Miller, 61, a statistician and one­time smoker, studied statistics compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics for American men and women who died after age 30 between 1920 and 1983. 
He found that women lived an average of one or two years longer than men in 1920, a ratio that climbed to a high of 7.8 years in the late 1970s. 
The longety difference has fal­len steadily since then and stood at sen years in 1983, the latest year for which accurate figures are available, Miller said. 
The average American man lived to be 71.7 years old in 1983, while the average woman lived to be 78.7. 

ACLU blasts porn commission 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-A constitutional rights group charged yesterday that a pornography commission es­tablished by Attorney General Ed­win Meese dwells on "bizarre sexual practices" while disregarding fair fact-finding methods. 
"Our worst fears have been surpassed," American Civil Uberties Union legislative counsel Barry Lynn said in a 31-page report on the Attor­ney General's Commission on Por­nography. 
"Even though many commissioners concede they have only a rudimentary understandingof the law, they continue to spend more time discussing bizarre sexual practices than in learning anything 
about  the  First  Amendment,"  he  
said.  
He  said  commission  methods  

have been "so intellectually indefen­sible that they taint the integrity and credibility ofany final recommenda­tions." 
The Justice Department issued a statement from commission Chair­man Henry Hudson, Arlington County, Va., prosecutor, saying the

panel has been fair and has con­sidered a wide variety ofopinion. 
ACLU allegations were "not sup­ported by the record ofthe hearings conducted by the commission," the statement said, adding that since the commission has made no final deci­sions on recommendations, specific comment on the ACLU criticism would be "premature and inapprop­priate." 
The 63-year-old civil liberties group said hearings in six cities over the past 11 months have featured biased witnesses, "limited" social science data and "inordinate atten­tion to aberrant sexual practices." 
"The commtsston staff was directed to purchase several glossy, interracial sex publications and a magazine called Young Girls in Bondage" while on a Sept. 11 visit to "three Houston peep shows," the report said. 
"It is as if by finding the single most despicable scene of sexual conduct ever photographed the commission would be justified in ur­ging suppresion of all sexually oriented material," it said.

Black men and women, for ex­ample, lived to about the same age in 1920, Miller said. But once black males began smoking in greater numbers after World War II, the gap widened and peaked at 8.8 years during the 1970s, he said. 
The longevity difference between black men and women stood at about 8.2 years in 1983. 
"Putting these two (comparisons) together, none of the other theories can come close to explaining it," he said. 
Miller, whose latest findings were reported in the February edition of the New York State Journal of Medicine, preously studied more than ,000 people over age 30 who died during the 970s. 
He found that non-smoking males lived an arage of 2 years longer than smoking males and that non­smoking females lived an average of 6 years longer than female smokers. 
In a study published two years ago, Miller reported that women whose husbands smoked cigarettes died of cancer at nearly twice the rate of those whose husbands did not smoke 
He also found that non-smoking wives who worked outside the home, and thus were eosed to cigarette smokers, had a higher in­cidence ofcancer than non-smoking wives who remained at home where no one smoked.

Meese established the panel after President Reagan called in May 1984 for a study of new evidence that has become available since a 1970 federal commission found no links between pornography and anti­social behavior and urged repeal of numerous obscenity laws. 
Lynn told reporters Friday he ex­pects the commission to urge approval ofsweeping Senate legisla­tion that would violate constitu­tional rights. In specific, he criticized a measure sponsored by Sen. Paul Trible, R-Va., to outlaw use of home computers to transmit sexual information about children. 
Lynn said the ACLU would not oppose a ban on plotting crimes against children but believes Trible's measure overshoots that tar­get. 
"Mr. Trible isn't really interested in drawing those narrowbills that do what he says his bills do," Lynn said. "Mr. Trible is interested in stopping adults from communicating about sex."

"that there's no way you can disas­sociate that (homosexual group's) message and Notre Dame because the station is named WSND and is owned by Notre Dame." Disc jock­eys also say "several times each hour that they are broadcasting live from the tower of O'Shaughnessy Hall on the campus ofNotre Dame." 
Cafarelli also told Gagliardi that the announcement, which like all public service announcements was run free ofcharge, "was counter to a lot of things that a Catholic univer­sity should stand for," Gagliardi said. 
According to WVFI-AM program­ming supervisor John Rogers, the group's announcement "gave basi­cally who they were, what their membership consisted of, and said that if you'd like to know more, here's the address." 
"It (the announcement) was like any other type announcement sent to the station just as something from the Glee Club," said Rogers. 
According to Gagliardi, "Ridley has had no prior beef with the ad­ministration, whereas Daniel has

Daniel has asked the administration for an increase in the budget for the station next year and funds to replace WVFI-AM's problem-plagued transmitter sys­tem. Cafarelli has said the station "has a pretty good chance" ofreceiv­ing a budget increase and may receive funding for the system. 
The banning of the announce­ment, however, poses a problem beyond just the losing oftwo station managers, he said. 
"The announcement's ban represents the potential for the ad­ministration to directly control what goes out on air," he said. 
"Considering the power, espe­cially financially, that the admistra­tion has over us, we cannot guarantee that they will not, quote, take us over," Gagliardi said. "They could tell us what music to play and how to operate. "They haven't told that to us yet, but considering the financial power they have over us, they could," he said. "But I don't expect it."

Failing Indiana farmer enters mental hospital
Because of problems with typesetting, Assistant Vice Presi­dent for Student Services Father Francis Cafarelli was misquoted. In addition, a paragraph quoting WVFI-AM and WSND-FM Chief Engineer Mike Thesing was omitted. The correct version should read: 
Cafarelli said he didn't know the chances of WVFI-AM receiv· ing any funds or the amount the station would receive ifthe funds were appropriated. He did say, however, that he is "going for the goal of getting the station received in all the halls as quickly as possible." 
Thesing, however, said that he sees the station "getting enough money to replace a couple of things, but that wouldn't be enough." 

Associated Press 
REMINGTON, Ind. · A farmer facing foreclosure on land that once belonged to his parents was hospi­talized at a mental health center yes­terday after firing shots toward officers during a four-hour standoff, state police said. 
Cpl. Patrick Calkins said David Berenda, 37, ofrural Remington was admitted early yesterday to the Wabash Valley Hospital Mental Health Center in West Lafayette. No 
charges  were  lodged  against  
Berenda, Calkins said.  
Berenda  surrendered  without  

force to authorities at 10:35 p.m. Saturday after an ordeal in which he first threatened suicide, led police on a short high-speed chase and then fired shots over the heads oflaw of­ficers at his 1,000-acre farm, Calkins said. 
"It was more a threatening action than to cause injury," Calkins said of the gunfire. No one was hurt and there was no damage, he added. 
State Police Sgt. Peter Popplewell said Jasper County sherift's deputies notified Berenda last week that the farm four miles west of Remington would be foreclosed upon. On Satur­day, officials of the Federal Land Bank notified Berenda he needed to vacate the farm by March 4. 
Popplewell said the farmer's financial troubles made him desparate. 
"He said he was mad at the system, mad at the people repossessing his farm," Popplewell said. "He said nobody understands. He said, what's he going to do now? how's he going to support his family?" 
Berenda is married and has several children, Popplewell said. Berenda had just bought the farmhouse and grew up on the farm. 
The incident began about 6:30 
p.m. when Berenda left the house, threatening suicide. A relative called police and there was a five-minute chase on rural roads in southern Jasper County, police said. 
The chase ended back at the farm and Berenda fired several shots In the air over the heads of officers, police said. About 2~ units from the state police and Jasper County sherift's department responded and police blocked the roads leading to the farmhouse.

Special to The Observer 
P 
repare yourselves for a storm of 
incredible proportions, a 
howling nightmare powerful 
enough to destroy anything in its 
path. Prepare yourselves for "The 
Tempest." 
William Shakespeare's last and most magical play, "The Tempest," the third Notre Dame and Saint Mary's production of the season at Washington Hall, will make a stop at Notre Uame this week and next. 
What Is unusual about this production is that a professional actor from Chicago, Robert Stor­mont, will be playing the role of Prospero In the play. which is directed by Mark Pilkinton, chair­man of Notre Dame's communica­tion and theatre department. 
Pilkinton said ofStormont, "It will be a great experience for our students to act with someone ofhis caliber. Acting opposite a profes­sional usually raises the level of concentration in students, and consequently Improves their per­formances." 
Stormont said that a strange string ofcoincidences led up to him receiving this particular role. A good friend unexpectedly called him up with the offer to play Prospero, and both Stormont and his friend said, "It's a small world," and the deal was solidified. This type ofcoincidence happens often in acting, according to Stormont. "Besides, I thought it would be a good experience" to perform at Notre Dame, Stormont added. 
''Ithink 
Shakespeare is . .. the best writer the world has ever known.'' 
-Robert Stormont 
Along with his acting role in "The Tempest," Stormont also will be conducting acting workshops, both with classes and outside ofclass. He said he feels that Notre Dame drama students, and actors in general, benefit more from hands-on ex­perience with professional actors than lectures by professors with much knowledge ofacting and theater. 
Stormont's experience in acting is extensive, and his forte is Shakespearean theater. "I think Shakespeare is wonderful. He is the best writer the world has ever known, and his writing is warm and human -full offunny guys, bad guys and funny bad guys." 
"The Tempest" is full ofintrigu­ing characters, like Prospero's evil brother Antonio, who usurps Prospero's dukedom early in the play. Later in the play, a spirit named Ariel helps Prospero in his search for his brother. Prospero himselfuses his magic to seek a prosperous ending to the story. 
This particular production of "The Tempest" will be slightly altered, according to Pilkinton. "We have changed a word here and there to make the play more under­standable," he said. He also allows Prospero to struggle with his magi­cal power, instead ofwielding it with ease. "I would like Prospero to struggle to make his magic work .... IfProspero believes that at any moment his power could fail and all would be lost, it will heighten the dramatic effect ofhis magic," said Pilkinton. 
"The Tempest" will play Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights at 8:10p.m. at Washington Hall, both this week and next. Tick­ets cost S6 for main floor seats, S5 for balcony seats and S4 for stu­dents.

SHUT UP! 
Dave Dvorak 
Out of the lunch box 
I 

'm convinced that this campus is full complainers-people who just never seem to be happy. Cynical and pessimistic, they spend their four years at Notre Dame groaning, grumbling, and . griping. I think we all know the type. 
Last Friday, I had the dubious distinction ofeati11g lunch with one such individual. He's a guy from class whose p:rsonality in many ways resembles a dark storm cloud. He's always finding things about the school to fuss and rag and moan about. Some people like to call him Willie the Whiner. 
Willie threw down his Observer and looked across the lunch table at me, disgust written all over his face. 
"Can you believe what Holtz is doing?" he asked me. "He's got a 
lot of nerve recruiting that quarterback Tony Rice. Have you seen 
the numbers on that guy?" 
Yeah, sure-7,000 yards total offense, 40 touchdown passes, only 
two career losses .... 
"No, that's not what I mean," said Willie. "I'm talking about his 
SAT scores-640 total. I'm shocked that this place would lower its 
standards like that to recruit intellectually inferior athletes." l What do you mean by intellectually inferior? 
"Well, my sister tried to get into NO last year," Willie said, "and 
she got rejected. Her SAT scores were double what Rice got. 
Where's the integrity around here?" 
Can your sister throw a football? 
"What's that got to do with it?" 
Everything. Notre Dame doesn't need another person with high 
SAT scores-heck, this place is oozing with high s<-hool valedic­
torians. What this universityrea/(y needs is somebnJy who can 
toss the old pigskin, run like lightning and bring back Notre Uame 
football fever. 
"But he'll never make it in the classroom," Willie protested. 
Give the guy a chance. Charles Dickens and Thomas Edison 
never even graduated frorpgrade school, much less took the SATs. 
They did all right for themselves, didn't they? 
Willie the Whiner stared at me blankly for a few seconds, then 
took a bite ofhis fried fish sandwich. 
"You know," he said. "I'm sick and tired of this university 
dictating morality to me. I should be able to make up my own mind 
whether or not to eat meat on Fridays during Lent. This fish 
sandwich is offensive." 
Well, there's.always a pretty good selection ofcereal here-Apple 
Jacks, Raisin Bran, Cap'n Crunch .... 
"Yeah, Cap'n Crunch with no cruncbberries. And those plastic 
cereal dispensers here in South Dining Hall have got to be the 
dumbest things in the world." 
I might have to agree with you on that one, Willie. 
"Speaking ofdumb things," he continued, "when are they going 
to finish that Fieldhouse monument? It looks even uglier than it did 
in the plans." 
I'm sure it'll look nice when they're finished. The same goes for 
that addition on LaFortune -that'll be a big improvement. 
"Yeah, they'll probably finish LaFortune about the time I'm back 
for my 1Oth year class reunion," whined Willie. "Then they'll hit 
me up for a donation and make me pay for it. Meanwhile, our 
student center is in shambles, just like the whole social life here ­
shambles!" 
C'mon, the social life isn't all that bad. How about the SYRs? 
"I have a rotten time at my SYRs. My dates always leave early on 
me, the unappreciative wenches. They try to tell me that I'm too 
negative about things." 
I don't know what would make them think that. 
"Me either," muttered Willie."And you know what else really 
peeves me? Last Monday was President's Day -all the schools and 
businesses in the entire nation were closed. But does Notre Dame 
close? Noooo. Classes are still in session. I guess that just proves it." 
Proves what? 
"Proves that the administration is made up ofa bunch of 
communists." 
Communists? 
"Sure. They don't respect national holidays. They slap us with the 
alcohol policy and the parietals rulings. They've taken away all our 
freedom and all our fun. Face it, this place is run by communists." 
r really think you're exaggerating a bit, WHile. 
"No, it's been this w~y since the founding of the University. 
Father Sorin didn't want us to have any fun, either." 
How can you possibly make a statement like that? 
"Well, just look where he chose to situate this place-South 
Bend, Indiana -a city with rotten weather, lousy radio stations and 
a stirlldng ethanol plantr 
I dpn't think Father Sorin was too concerned about radio stations 
and the ethanol plant back in 1842. 
"He should have planned ahead." Willie wiped his mouth and got 
up to leave. "I've gotta run," he said. "I have to cash a check at the 
Cashier's Office." 
Isn't it amazing how the ladies that work there are always in such 
a wonderful mood? They're always so nice and friendly. 
"Yeah, they must be up to something," Willie said. "You can 
never trust a smiling person. Actually, I think it's just part ofthe 
administration's scheme to make it appear like people arc happy 
here." 
Well, I'm happy here. 
"I always knew there was something about you I didn't like." 
Willie the Whiner picked up his tray and left the table. I breathed a 
deep sigh ofreliefas the dark storm cloud followed him out.

Unlikely couples give 'Heart Day' a new meaning 
Recently, we celebrated the most romantic day of the year, Valentine's Day. "Heart Day" brings to mind visions ofromance, love, roses and happy couples in love -couples like Romeo and Juliet, Bogy and Bacall, Sir l.an­celot and Guinevere, or maybe even Mom and Dad. Tr-.ese reprrsent some of the greatest r romantic pairings of all time. Great. But have r you ever thought about what some of most r mismatched couples in the world could be? 
Well, I did. And thankfully that is all I did.

r 
together they could cause nothing less than

"The Fall of Rome -Part II." 
~  Carol Brown  
r  
r r  in these times  
r  
r r  In current news, let's say. . . Marcos and Aquino. If marriage is based on trust, can you  
~  imagine  where  these  two  would  be?  
"Ferdinand, where were you last night? Stuff­ 
ing the ballot boxes again, huh ?" How's that  
for marital bliss?  
As long as we are  in the political realm,  
picture  the  newly wed couple of Ronald  
Reagan  and  Geraldine  Ferraro-Reagan.  
(Warning: attempting this vision at home may  
be hazardous to the stability of your political  
identity). Granted, it is normal for even the  
happiest couples to experience disagreement  
on  some  issues,  but  these  two  would  
definitely take the cake -which after Ronnie  
had thickly iced it to preserve the status quo,  

Geraldine would promptly proceed to cut it up and distribute it to the poor. And could this couple ever give a simple party? What kind? Republican or Democrat? 
And what couple could possibly form a greater "morality-mismatch" than the bible­thumping Reverend Jerry Falwell and America's most humorous sex-therapist, Dr. Ruth Westhei,mer? Just to think of that first night of their honeymoon gives the word a 

Or, how about this typical childhood scene: "T, honey, when Mr. Jones said he was taking Troop 732 on a survival outing in the country, I don't think he meant for you to bring all that military gear. Besides you might scare off the other little boys." "What! I pity the fool who would dare to mess with my G.l. Joe army gear!" And poor Erma would not only have to deal with the usual colds, bumps and scrapes of childhood, but . . . "Dr. Smith I just don't 
know what to do with T. All ofthose chains he 
wears are causing an awful rash on his 'little' 
chest." 
Anyway, this just goes to show what a lot of trouble a little imagination can get you into. Oh, and how about this one . . . Manute Bol and Mary Lou Retton? ... naaah.

whole new meaning, honeymoon? 
How about social justice and civil rights? Imagine the sparks that would fly from the union ofClare Huxtable of"The Cosby Show" with America's all-time, prime-time fascist: Archie Bunker. Clare is the sort of indepen­dent, ERA. woman that Archie would definitely label as "one of those ding-bat liberated womens nuts." Their views would be as different as black and white, particularly in Archie's eyes. 
Domestic tranquility? This would most assuredly be one ofthe few homes in America which staged civil liberties' protests rather than garage sales. Bunker definitely would not be the king ofthis castle. 
And last but oh so far from least would be the humorous teaming up of the mother-son duo of my favorite, Erma Bombeck, with the infamous Mr. T. Can you imagine America's great "Mother Suburbia" trying to mother a man who eats rocks for breakfast? "Oh, T! How many times have I told you, chewing on rocks is bad for your teeth.

Therapeutic encounter 
inferior to confession 
r 
r 
r 
DearEditor: 
r ~ To say that I was disturbed by Ann Pettifer'!; Feb. 12 article, "Sexism of Confessional Tur­
r ning Women Away," would be at best an un­
r derstatement. Her position that, ". . . . the 
r therapeutic encounter is the obvious, con­
r structive alternative to confession (for women)," demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding ofthe sacrament ofpenance. This sacrament is an opportunity for a man or woman to confess his or her failings to a representative of Christ on Earth, namely a priest. He has been empowered by his ordina­tion to pronounce the sins forgiven in the light of true contrition. The slate is, so to say, wiped clean, and the penitent is admonished to live as Christ called for us to live. Now I ask, what is entailed in this "therapeutic encounter?" A psyc­hiatrist/psychologist discusses your failing with you. Fine. But now I ask, can he or she offer you guidelines by which to live as the Gospels suggest? More radically, do they or their profession accept the concept of"sin" as Christians know it? But most importantly, can he or she absolve you ofthe stain on your soul as can a priest? I offer NO to all of the above. The only pos­sible conclusion for a Catholic: the therapeutic encounter is grossly inferior to the sacrament ofpenance. As to Pettifer's complaint that women have no voice in the control of this sacrament and should therefore abandon it, may I offer a quote from the decrees ofthe Second Vatican Council. 
doesn't even know by calling the girl a bimbo, just to get her point across? We believe an apology is in order. 
Second, you are totally out ofline with your criticism of the acts of the undergrads. Ob­viously, you failed to notice that Undergrad Night ils chaperoned. Thus, you fail to realize that the chaperones approached the three dancing on the table, and did nothing more but ask the the undergrads to replace the disl­ocated panels when they were finished, which they did. If the people who protect the establishment were not concerned, then what makes this vandalism? 
Third, we see it as unfortunate that you seniors felt compelled to return to your "homt: away from home" on Undergrad Night. Are you that out of touch with the senior class? If so, we know of some big high school functions planned for this weekend. 
Finally, you can take your advice and ... ret­hink it. It is not because ofpeople like us that the administration did away with parties. If you knew anything about the alcohol policy, you would realize how ridiculous your state­ment was. Moreover, it is attitudes such as yours whichadd to the "dryness" ofthis com­munity. Need we say more?

Following the 1982 incidents there were reports of eyedrops containing acid, and one that hits close to home for me, Hygrade Ball Park Franks were reported to have broken razor blades and pins inside them. 
The parent companies lost millions of dol­lars and possibly many customers, not be­cause of their negligence, but because someone decided to harm someone else. Johnson & Johnson recalls its Tylenol products for inspection. Hygrade recalls all of its Ball Park Franks in its home base area of Detroit. 

Johnson &Johnson now has to go through a similar procedure again. Hopefully this time it will uncover something that will help to recover its losses, and help to keep loyal cus­tomers. 
Hygrade discovered, after the recall, that all three incidents were created by the victims themselves. Hygrad was now the victim. livonia, Mich., Hygrade's hometown, stood behind Hygrade, and in the course of almost two weeks livonia ate more than 105,000 Ball Park Franks, one for every person in livonia. 
The people ofthe United States should con­tinue to backJohnson &Johnson. I am not tel­ling everyone to go out and buy its products, but I am saying that if you have been a regular Tylenol user, you should continue to use Tylenol when Johnson & Johnson and the FDA are satisfied that the problem no longer exists. 
We cannot allow the sick people of the world to take the companies we have trusted for so long away from us.

Seniors should not be fast to condemn others 
DearEditor: 

As underclassmen who attended Undergrad Night at the Alumni-Senior Club onJan. 24, we would like to enlighten the ladies who were so quick to condemn us in their Feb. 7letter to The Observer. 
First, your choice in adjectives for the young lady you saw dancing on the table was far more "asinine" than anything she did. What type of mature college senior has to resort to publicly humiliating someone she

P.O.BoxQ 

Hesburgh's recent talk was rhetorical exercise 
Dear Editor: 
Father Hesburgh's recent speech at Howard Hall was an exercise in rhetoric and, to use his term, a "simplistic" appraisal of the South African problem. 
While Hesburgh did say that the University is an open forum for issues, he made it per­fectly clear that he had read more than most on the issue of apartheid and that divestment is an easy answer espoused by those who have not properly considered the implications of such action. 
Abandoning his "open forum" stance, he likened those who favor divestment to Pon­tius Pilate-a "simplistic" analogy ifever there was one. 
True to past form, Hesburgh spent much of his speech comparing South African apartheid to the situation in America prior to the civil rights movement of the 1960s; still more of the speech was spent addressing the role Hes­burgh himself played in the movement. Hes­burgh deserves a tremendous amount of credit for his part in the civil rights movement in America, and he makes sure he gets every ounce of it. 
The issue to be addressed is South Africa! And while there are similarities between South African and American history, the two are far from identical. Yet each time a member of Wednesday's audience raised a unique feature of the South African situation, such as its wholly racist constitution and government, Hesburgh played Rosa Parks or Martin Luther King as a trump card. 
The time has come for Hesburgh to stop resting on his admittedly well-deserved laurels and resume his role as a civil rights leader, heading the call of South Africa's oppressed majority. 
Hesburgh warned against "simplistic" ideas such as "divest now." Yet his own appraisal of the situation seems quite simplistic. He said that in moments of reflection he had often wondered what he would do if he had God's power to resolve the South African crisis; his answer involved some representational divi­sion of the land between blacks and whites. This hardly represents an informed reaction to the situation in the troubled nation. 
Somehow irr his assessment of the 
problems, Hesburgh neglected to incorporate 
the views of the black leadership; he implies 
that since the whites hold racist views toward 
blacks, black leaders must also harbor racist 
feelings toward whites. No more "simplistic" 
conclusion could possibly be drawn. South 
Africa's black leaders have been ever-mindful 
to keep their movement free from racist 
hatred oftheir oppressors. 
In conclusion, I must say that the cry for divestment is anything but "simplistic." After much thoughtful consideration of the real in­justices practiced by the illegitimate govern­ment of South Africa, there is no question but to divest. The legitimate leaders of the South African majority are calling out to Hesburgh to once again make a strong stand for human rights. Divestment might be a simple act, but it is far from "simplistic."

Article on counseling did not complete story 
DearEditor: 
After five years of occasional Observer reading, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised at finding yet another error in an Observer story. Yet the misrepresentation of the Counseling and Psychological Services Center in Feb. 1 7 article on counseling services must be cor­rected. 
The article states that the Center "is com­prised of doctoral trainees in psychology." As a graduate student myself, I would never denigrate those graduate students in the Counseling Psychology Program who counsel clients at the CPSC, under the supervision of center staff. The incomplete article, however, implies that the CPSC is staffed solely by these doctoral trainees, and that the service as such is somehow second class. 
According to the information pamphlet published by the CPSC, the center staff in­cludes licensed clinical and counseling psyc­hologists (a total of nine Ph.D.s), a certified social worker and a consulting psychiatrist. I have personally met a number of the CPSC staff and benefitted from their knowledge and sldlls in center-sponsored workshops. They have always acted in a professional and caring manner. 

The Viewpoint Department 

Indeed, the CPSC is one ofthe few organiza­tions on this campus, outside the graduate school, which has recognized the special needs and concerns ofgraduate students. The center staff, both professional and doctoral students, provide an important service to the Notre Dame community. They, at the very least, deserve factual reporting from The Ob­server.

Students who exercise should do so defensively 
DearEditor: 

I always have been impressed with the large 
numbers of the Notre Dame community ex­
ercising on campus. Warm weather will bring 
more out on our narrow roads. I feel it is im­
portant to remind these enthusiasts to RUN 
DEFENSIVELY while enjoying our beautiful 
campus. 

As one who drives and jogs on campus, it is 
obvious the number of vehicles using the 
roads. I am amazed that a Notre Dame student 
has not been seriously injured on campus. We 
recognize that "pedestrians on campus have 
the right of way at all times," but common 
sense should prevail. 

We know there are many safety rules of the 
road that include walkers and cyclists. Below 
are three rules that I am continually reminded 
ofas I drive or jog on campus: 

l. Run defensively, single file facing the traffic. 
2. If you must wear a head set be sure you can hear the traffic behind you. 
3. Wear bright colored clothing at night.

War memorial fountain glorifies the act of war 
DearEditor: 

As I was sitting in the Lady Chapel ofSacred 
Heart Church at 5:30 this morning praying for 
peace, a monstrous contradiction came to my 
mind. Starting a peace institute and having 
such activities as a 48-hour vigil for peace go 
directly against the subtle form of indoctrina­
tion the planners of the new war memorial 
are, perhaps unwittingly, putting forth. 
I was leery of the memorial when I heard 
that $500,000 was being spent on a bunch of 
concrete when there are so many in dire need 
of money and financial aid right here at our 
university, but I did not complain. I, too, 
believe that we should remember the in­
dividuals who died fighting for freedom, but 
we should never glorify or honor war. 
The stone that reads "Po patia et pace," for the homeland and for peace, glorifies the war, not the individuals involved. This type of at­titude is dangerous because it does not look for alternatives to war -war is considered the path to peace. 
In this time of nuclear instability and ad­vanced conventional weapons, we must realize that war never can be an alternative, that we must strive for peace, justice and freedom in other more Christ-like ways. 
Now that the money and labor have been spent, the memorial appears here to stay. Per­haps we should begin a perpetual peace vigil around the memorial in order to counteract the attitudes which it implies. I want those who designed the monument to know that their opinion is dangerous. War is not always and may never be a means to peace.

Facts should be clear on Zahm hockey past 
DearEditor: 
First, let me congratulate Tim Adams on a fine article about the Zahm Rabid Bats hockey team. But second, let me clear up some mis­conceptions present in the article. For ex­ample, the reason the Rabid Bats never won a game in their entire existence prior to the 1983-84 season is that before the 1982-83 season the team was known as the Fightin' Zahmbies. As a member of the Zahm Hall hockey team from 1978-82 I recall that we won about half of our games and that fan sup­port was almost as good then as it is now. During that period the team was coached by a colorful character named Andy Pavelko (ask Father King about him) and our goalie was the same Tim Murphy who painted the familiar murals in the Zahm party room. But in any case it is good to know Zahm still has the same spirit it had years ago.

Dear Editor: 
Congratulations on the excellent anti­abortion commentaries. I only wish the pro­choicers were given some print. I feel that doing so would have strengthened the pro-life position even more.

Bird, Celts roll to win over Indiana 
Notre Dame's Trena Keys drives for two In a home game against North Star Conference rival Loyola (Chi.) earlier this season. Keys was a one-woman wrecking crew in Chicago this weekend, as she led the Irish to a 79-67 victory over Loyola on Friday and a 73-58 win over DePaul yesterday. Marty Strassen has all the details of the road trip, begin­ning on page 16.

Lendl captures Lipton title with victory over Wilander 
Associated Press 
BOCA RATON, Fla. ·Top-seeded Ivan Lend! won the pivotal rain­delayed tiebreaker and then cruised to a 3-6, 6-1, 7-6, 6-4 victory over second-seeded Mat Wilander of Sweden Sunday night to capture the men's singles title in the Lipton In­ternational Players Championships tennis tournament. 
The third-set tiebreaker took nearly 3 1/2 hours to complete, being interrupted by a 3-hour, 1 5· minute rain delay. The score was 2-2 when the rain began at 4:15 p.m. EST.

percentage from 44.4 percent to 
57.4 percent in the final 20 minutes and pulled away. 
Although the Demons boasted only a 5·5 record coming into the game, the victory was a big one for Notre Dame. 
"DePaul is our big rivalry in everything from marbles to basket­ball," said DiStanislao. 
The Irish held 5·5 guard Sally An· derson to only 1 2 points in the game, while Keys proved once again why she is one of the premier players in NCAA women's basket­ball. 
"She's a senior and a leader," said DiStanislao. "This was a big, big game for us and she knew what she had to do. We needed her ex­perience. She got rebounds when we needed them and points when we needed them. She did her job once again."

When the players returned to the court at 7:30, they traded points to 5·5, when Wilander made two great saves of powerful Lend! forehands, .only to hit a backhand long. After using power to get ahead, Lend! then won the tiebreaker with a touch 
drop volley. 
In the women's final Saturday, 
top-seeded Chris Evert Uoyd beat 
second-seeded Steffi Graf of West 
Germany 6-4,6-2. 
"I was struggling all day long," 
Lend! said. "I couldn't get the 
crunch on my serve. But I played 
much better once we got back out." 
Keys, who was held to just two points in Notre Dame's 55·53 vic­tory over DePaul earlier in the year, was more concerned with the vic­tory than with redeeming herself. 
"The fact that they shut me down la'>t time was in the back of my mind," she said. "But you can't take a basketball game as a per1;onal thing. The main thing I wanted to do was make sure we beat them. Whether I scored two points or 25 points doesn't matter, as long as we beat them." 
Botham added 2 3 for the Irish in addition to 14 rebounds, countering the physical inside play of DePaul. DiStanislao was glad to see the 6-2 sophomore play the kind she has played all year for her squad. 
"Sandy Botham came alive," she said. "She did today what we knew she could do when we recruited her. She played a great game in a big game." 
Botham was not surprised with the physical play of the Demons. 
"It was very physical, especially in the second half," she explained. "When they were losing, they figured their only way to get back into the game was by pushing us around. They were frustrated. 
"For myself, it was just a matter of being on. It was a good night."

Men's, women's fencing teams go unbeaten over weekend 
By TRISH SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame fencing teams head into the Great Lakes Tourna­ment this coming weekend with perfect ledgers and an NCAA tide on the line. This past weekend, the men's and women's squads travelled to Ohio to take on Wayne State and then to East Lansing, Mich., to meet Michigan, Oakland, Illinois and Mic­higan State. The Irish came out on top in all cases to continue the men's ~3-meet winning streak and the women's 23-meet winning streak. 
Once again, the 23-0 men's team found their strength in the foil squad. Against Wayne State the team went 9-0 with senior Mike Vander­Velden, junior Charles Higgs­Coulthard and sophomore Yehuda Kovacs all going 3-0 against their op­ponents. 
"This foil squad is the best we've ever had here," commented Head Coach Mike DeCicco. "They are really unbelievable. It's a good feeling to have them lead the team as we head into the Great Lakes and the NCAA tournament." 
The women took a 1 0-6 victory from Wayne State as well, with sop-

we needed to, and we also had some 
ouside shooting strength." 
Miami coach Bill Foster agreed 
that his team had been pretty much 
outplayed. 
"Dennis Burns (23 points) played well early but overall we were physi­cally whipped," said Foster. "We considered playing man-to-man defense, and we tried matching it up at times. But we had to go to zone to keep the big guys in. We went back to man for the last two-and-a-half minutes, but we can't guard this team that way-we'd foul out a lot of guys inside. 
"The refs seemed to be letting a lot go, and I think our kids were a little gun-shy. That type of game suits their style of play a lot better than it does ours. We don't have any real physical players, whereas most of their players are physical." 
Miami was without the services of 6-7, 210-pound forward Tim Daw­son, who was lost for the seasonwith a thumb injury suffered in late January. That left 6-10, 245-pound juniorTim Harvey as the only beefin the Hurricane lineup. Because Har­vey has been fouling out during the national anthem lately, Foster figured all along that it was going to be a long night for Miami. Harvey fouled out with 10:53 left in the game, after playing just 17 minutes. 
It doesn't get any easier for the Hurricanes, who have a visit to bruising Marquette on March 5 to look forward to. 
"I watched Marquette and Notre Dame play, and it was like watching the Packers and the Bears -they're the same kind ofphysical team," said

final game then Miami head coach Ron Godfrey had announced his resignation, effective at the end of the season. 
Seven weeks later , on April 22, 1971, it was all over. The University of Miami Board ofTrustees voted to drop basketball "temporarily until such a time as a permanent fieldhouse could be constructed on the main campus." Sagging atten­dance figures and serious financial losses were also believed to con­tribute to the board's decision. 
The program that had produced All-Americans Dick Hickox, Rick Barry and Don Currnutt, and the team that set an NCAA record by averaging 98.4 points per game in 1964-65, was gone. 
The revival began a little over 12 years later, on July 15, 1983, with the hiring of Athletic Director Sam Jankovich. Jankovich, A.D. at Was­hington State for seven years, im­mediately announced that the resurrection of men's basketaball at Miami would be the top priority of the early months ofhis tenure, in or­der to give Miami "one of the na­tion's most complete and visible overall programs in the country." 
Three months later the University Board of Trustees voted un­animously to reinstate men's basket­ball at Miami. The key factor in that decision was Jankovich's report stating that men's basketball could

Keys leads Notre Dame women to pair of wins on road 
By MARlY STRASSEN 
Sports Writer 
CHICAGO · Perhaps Loyola and DePaul can find some consolation in the fact that they will never have to play against Trena Keys again. 
The 6-1 senior stormed the Windy City this past weekend, lighting up the scoreboard and leading the Notre Dame women's basketball team to a pair of important victories. The Irish downed Loyola, 79-67. on Friday, then victimized DePaul yes­terday afternoon in a 73-58 win. 
Notre Dame boosted its record to I7-7 overall and 9-1 in the North Star Conference. 
Keys began her weekend domina­tion of Chicago teams at Loyola's Alumni Gymnasium, exploding in the second halfto spark the Irish to a big victory over the Lady Ramblers. Loyola, which dropped to 7-3 in the conference, stayed close in the first half, but it was only a matter of time before Notre Dame took charge. 
Keys, whose seven first-half points put her team on top by four at 33-29, took matters into her own hands in the second half. She found her mark shooting over the Rambler zone, netting 2 3 points in the second half to lift her game total to 30 on I 3-of­2I from the field and 4-of-5 from the free-throw line. 
Irish head coach Mary DiStanislao has come to expect such perfor­mances from Keys. 
"Trena took over and that's what you expect from your senior all­America candidate," DiStanislao said. "There wasn't anybody in the country better than her tonight. 
"In the second half she really worked to get open. She went after her opportunities and got them. She was really aggressive and it paid off." 
Keys' 30 points were one short of her own Notre Dame record for points in a game, and she set a new record for career 10-point games in the contest, surpassing Shari Mat· vey's old mark of 70. 
"In the first half I wasn't shooting well," Keys said. "In the second halfl stopped thinking about it as much and just played my game. The shots just started falling." 

Diondra Toney and Mary Gavin added II points apiece for the Irish, while Sandy Botham and Heidi Bunek chipped in IO each. Toney, a 5-9 freshman, pulled down a personal-high I4 rebounds with the Irish front line in foul trouble. 
"We dodged a bullet with the big people getting in foul trouble," said DiStanislao. "Didi (Toney) is doing a good job. She did a great job on the boards and took advantage of her weak-side positioning." 
Toney credited her success to a recem increase in playing time, as Friday's game was her second con­secutive start. 
''I'm getting more into the of­fense," she said. "I decided that this was my time to contribute to the team. I'm staning to do more be­cause I'm getting more playing time. It's just coming naturally now. 
"I've been working on my rebounding in practice. I know I can't jump over anybody so I just try to get postition and make sure I'm around the basket." 
The Irish turned their thoughts to DePaul yesterday and expected a physical contest. They were not dis· appointed. 
Keys scored 20 of her 25 points in the second half. once again turning a close game into a decisive victory. In fact, the Irish trailed the Lady Blue Demons by a point at the half, but they raised their shooting
