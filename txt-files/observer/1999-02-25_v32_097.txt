Concentration focuses on Catholicism 
By JOSHUA BOURGEOIS 
News Writfr 
Beginning August 1999, the College of Arts and Letters will have a new concen­tration focusing on the, principlos of the Church's social doctrine. 
The idea of the concentration, the Catholic Social Tradition, began four y~Htrs ago with professor Kathleen Weigert of the American Studies department. She gath­ered a committee of theology. philosophy, economics, history and anthropology pro­fessors from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's to discuss and form the concentra­tion. 
The committee asked Todd Whitmore, professor of theology, to direct the concen­tration one year ago. Last Sl'lmester, the College of Arts and Letters approvod the concentration and allocated the funds for it. 
"Tim concontration is necessary for Notro Dame because of its Catholic identi­ty, the lack of' knowledge most Catholics have on Church social doctrirrn, and the influence and authority Notre Dame gradu­ates have in the real world," said Whitmore. 
Whitmore added that sincll Notre Dame is a Catholic university, it should have pro­grams that promote its Catholic identity such as the Catholic Social Tradition con­centration.

Stortn Warnings 
February in florida i.s typically a slow month for news broadcasts. By this time, people are sick of hearing about the tourist season and U's still months away from hurri­cane season, which leaves them liUle else to Finn Pressly broadcast excflpt sc>-News Writer called "human interest" stories, which are ironically of no interest at all to anyone with an 10 over that of a shoelace. 
Stories like this are easy to spot, because they begin with "A day at the beach turned into a brush with tragedy when.... " They like the beach/tragedy/resolution scenario a lot. Usually it's something earth-shattering like, "A day at the beach turned into a brush with tragedy when a little boy dropped his sand­wich. Thankfully, rescue workers were on hand to provide him with a substitute sand­wich." After the clip, the newscasters shuffle their papers, turn to each other with genuine concern and say, "Thank goodness it all ended happily." 
The only time we ever get anything close to actual news is when a hurricane starts brew­ing. Even if it's nowhere near the Atlantic Ocean, the news stations bend over back­ward to concoct fancy graphics with the name of the storm superimposed on video footage of a streetlight swinging in the wind. Then, they command the airwaves to broad­cast interviews with that guy at the National Hurricane Institute (who looks suspiciously like Orville Redenbacher). His sole purpose, it seems, is to alert us to the fact that Hurricane Gidget may possibly obliterate the greater part of our state. 
The newscasters never ask him questions like "Will the hurricane hit us?" or "Where is the hurricane located?" They never want Orville to reveal that Hurricane Bambi is actually just a small rainstorm off the coast of Montevideo. Uruguay. This would keep fami­lies from going to the shelters, which is the goal of all hurricane broadcasts. "Run to the shelters!" they say. 
It's like they have a contest each year to see how many people they can stuff into the West Palm Beach Auditorium. The Auditorium was recently sold to the Jehovah's Witnesses to be used as a temple and convention center. I hope they still let us use their new temple as shelter, because oth­erwise that'll put damper on all the TV sta­tions' hurricane fun and games. 
Our family was never a shelter family. For some reason, our hurricane emergency plan is to drive to our aunt's house, which is no less vulnerable than our own house. Our logic is that as long as we're sleeping on the floor of a strange house surrounded by defunct hurricane lamps and soup cans, the storm will take pity on us and go hit Antigua instead. I also think that part of the reason we go to my aunt's house is because she puts a big 'X' of masking tape on all her windows, which is the equivalent of lamb's blood on the door jamb when it comes to storms. That tells the hurricane not to destroy that particular house. 
For everyone headed south for Spring Break, be sure to pack the masking tape, because you never know when they'll start herding you into the shelters.

Student activists call for stronger code on· sweatshop labor 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. 

Non-confrontational dialogue con­tinued yesterday as student activists and university administrators contin­ued to address the issue uf sweatshop labor in the collegiate apparel indus­try. 
Members of Students Organizing for Labor and Economic Equality said they were told by other campus anti-sweat­shop organizers that college adminis­trators nationwide are looking to the university for leadership on this issue, adding that what happens in Ann Arbor will set the tone for resL of the nation. · 
After some discussion, the five mem­bers of SOLE present at the meeting with University general counsel Marvin Krislov and Senior Associate Athletic Director Keith Molin decided to set their next meeting for March 9. 
"We want to find the candle to light the way out of the darkness," Molin 
¦ UNIVERSITY Of fLORIOA Regents to decide on medical school 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. 
If and where a new state medical school is created likely will hinge on what the Board of Regents and several state university presidents decide during a meeting in Orlando Wednesday. The Regents' Workshop on Medical Education comes just days after a study reported Florida State University would be the cheapest site for a new state med­ical school. UF President John Lombardi said the meeting will allow state leaders to hear the consultant's report and learn what the experts say. "We are there to provide what­ever insight is helpful from our experience with a public medical school in Florida," Lombardi said of the seven SUS presidents who will speak at the meeting. The $214,230 FSU-Regents study, conducted by Dr. Richard Janeway, former Bowman-Gray Medical School dean, and MGT of America Inc., showed a four-year FSU medical school would cost the state $25.5 million annually. 
¦ BROWN UNIVERSITY New financial aid policy approved 
PROVIDENCE, R.I. 
In an effort to keep Brown competitive among its peer institutions, the Corporation approved a new financial aid policy at its retreat this weekend. The new policy is aimed at reducing the amount of loans and other self­help components of the university's financial aid pack­ages, while increasing the amount of scholarships and grants. The university will spend $5 million over the next four years to phase in its new plan, which will take effect beginning with the class of 2003. While the changes will benefit students from all income groups who are on financial aid, they are aimed especially at low-income households -particularly those with household incomes under $30,000, according to Laura Freid, executive vice president for public affairs and university relations. "This is a substantial reduction" in the self-help aspect of financial aid, said president Gordon Gee.

Students win MTV celebrity contest 
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. 
While most students endured flurries, bar raids and studying for exams, Josh Kessler and his girlfriend Katie Hennessy lived up the celebrity life as winners of MTV's Celebrity Skin contest. Last Thursday MTV cameras visit­ed the Champaign-Urbana area to capture Kessler's reac­tion upon learning that he would be treated to the high life for a weekend. Kessler was surprised by a phone call from Courtney Love after his boss and friends lured him away from Hennessy's apartment. As Love talked to Kessler a camera crew stormed into the apartment. "I don't think he believed what happened," said Hennessy, a junior in ACES. Kessler and Hennessy f'lew first class to Los Angeles. They stayed at L'Ermitege Hotel in Beverly Hills. Friday. Kessler interviewed the band Hole for the MTV program Fanatic. "They were real laid back and more down to earth than I suspected," said Kessler. 
¦ DARTMOUTH COLLEGE Alumni support residence initiative 
l-lANOVEH, N.11. 
The College has gained more money in donations than it has lost as a result of the Board of Trustees' controversial new initiative, but it is not clear how long that trend will last, as many alumni are waiting to see what will happen next before deciding whether or not to rescind pledges. Since the announcement of the residential and social life initiative, ten to twelve alumni have rescinded pledges, for a total loss of less than $2,000. During the same time peri­od, however. three alumni have pledged a total of $40,000 to the alumni fund stating specifically that they were pledging because of the Trustees' initiative, according to Director of the Alumni Fund Jennifer Williams. One of these alumni, who graduated in the early 1990s, pledged $5000 saying his donation was a "vote of confidence." But some alumni are not as enthusiastic about the residential and social life initiative. 
public disclosure of factory location and ownerships and a wage that takes local living factors into consideration. 
Students at Duke and Georgetown Universities and the University of Wisconsin -Madison have forced their administrators to take action for a stronger code. 
SOLE members met with University President Lee Bollinger Friday. deliv­ering a letter of ultimatum that called for the University to stand for public disclosure and better wages. 
Molin said the university has been one of the leaders calling for indepen­dent monitoring of factories. 
"For independent monitoring to occur, you need Lo know where the factories are," Molin said. 
University administrators said they want to continue to address the issue in a non-confrontational way, hoping to come to a resolution by the target date of March 12.

In a compelling demonstra­tion of' the problems of trying to write with one's left hand in a right-handed desk, Morrissey senator Ryan Costantini stated that, UThe back is not in a nat­ural position when writing this way. Notre Dame has the resources to accommodate left­handed students."

Five people remained missing, the Austria Press Agency said. Seven miles awav. in Galtum·. the death toll ros() to 16. and rescuers searchfld for 15 others still believed buried by an avalanche on Tuesday. 
"This is a catastrophe such as wr have not had for centuries," said Wendelin Weingartner. govm·nor of Tyrol province in western Austria. 
Authoritifls said among the dflad in (;,dtuer wern eight G11rmans, includ­ing two children, two Danes and six Austrians. all residents of the village of 700. 

More than 60 people across Europe have died in avalanches so far this year as the area endures its heaviest snows in decades. In Chamonix, France, 12 people were killed in an avalanche earlier this month. 
Austrian television showed scores of rescuers using long metal probes to detect survivors. 
But they have so far been unsuc­cessful, despite the use of avalanche dogs trained to locate people buried undflr masses of snow. 
The huge wave of snow crushed cars and hurled them across the vil­lage. The snow and ice cleanly sliced the top off of one house like a razor blade. 
Hflscue squads couldn't rflacb the winter sports resort or Galtuer until W!1dn()sday morning due to bad weather and roads blocked by earli­c r avalanches. The government began an airbridge between J.andeck and Galtuer at first light Wednesday. 
A strady stream or helicopters landing and taking off l'rom the l'ontlatz Austrian army base took rescuers into Galtuer and by after­noon. soldiers in Landeck wern quickly loading the chopprrs with 
pallets of fresh fruits, V()getablcs and other foodstuffs. Survivors and tourists were flown out on the return leg. 
Many or the peoplr arriving refused to talk to rnportPrs. Sonw had tears in their eyes, others looked relieved and a few described digging in the snow in search of victims. 
"My husband and I raced out and found two small children in thr. snow. Th()y were probably dead," said a Belgian woman who gav() heir name only as Anita. /\uthoritir.s nev()r told hr.r wlrnther tlw rhildnin survived or not.

"I thought it was just a storm," said llanno Heinz, 17. from Hadstadt, Austria. Ile said tlw snow came with such f'orrn that it blr.w opnn tho hinged windows of' tlrn guesthouse. dumping 4 inchns of snow on the floor.

¦ Kosovo 

Ethinic Albanians unite for freedom 
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
PRISTINA 
SoUing aside deep mis• trust that hn.mJJercd past efforts to press for inde­pnndence, Kosovo's rival Alhanian factions announced Wednesday lhoy had formed a coali­tion to push harder to secedfl from Serbia. 
Ttrn surprise announce­m ent came a. day aftor Kosovo peace talks con­cluded withoul any hreak­through on an lntorna• tionally brokered deal to end a ytmr of fighting that has left more than 2,000 people dqad in the .south­
ern Serbian province. 

Sr-rb nr.gotiators to the peace talks In llambouillet, France, returned homo to Belgrade and declared victory, saying they sue" cMded In keeping foreign troops out of the ethnic A Iba n i an -majority province. 
Serbs were Jubilant about coming away from 17 days of talks without conceding to a key demand from the West: the deployment of thou• 
sand!:l of NATO peace­
keeping forces on Serbian soil to police any Kosovo agreement. ­
State media conlrollod by Yugoslav hard-line President Slobodan Milosevic joined in the exultation, saying the Serbs had prevailed against enormous international prl:lssure. 
Besides the high casual• ty figures. some 300,000 people. mostly e~hnlc Albanians. have been dis• placed in the battles between Kosovo Albanian guerrillas seeking inde­pendence and tho joint forces of Serb police and 
tho Yugoslav nrrny. 
Kosovo is part of Serbia, Yugoslavia's major repub• Uc. but more than 90 per• 
cent of its population is ethnic: Albanian and most want independence. 
No documents were signed at Hambouillot, and although the Kosovo Albanian delegation said it was rnady in principle to sign at a new meeting, Serbs remained steadfast­ly oppost~d to th1~ station· Ing of a NATO force on their soil. 
But the announcement that rival Kosovo factions were ready to work together spelled success for a long-torm American and European goal: get­ting ethnic Albanians to spoak with one voice.

extflrior of the building need to be inviting places," said Tina Velthiuzen, rector of the Church of the Holy Trinity. 
The discussion also focused on how age differences within a congregation call for more creative approaches within the service. 
"People 65 and older are 

used to the oral tradition of church whereas people under 30 are accustomed to elnc­tronics, color, sound bytes, action and the lnlernet. The church has a real problem reaching that generation because those that do the planning don't relate," said rerguson-Patton. 
Forms of "electronic market­ing" are already in effect, according to tlrn panelists. In one non-denominational church in California the pas­tors use PowcrPoint during their sermons. The congrega­tion can view the presentation at computer stands locatnd on the sanctuary.

With fewer students, growing apathy, and competition f'rom non­African Amel'ican activities, African American studP.nt leader­ship may be gelling stretched too thin. In some sense, it's also a lack of leadership development that hurls (i.e. delegation and lime management skills.) Overworked and burned out, they often are forcod to turn thn reins ovnr aftor a year or two. Th<m, in the intprest of maintaining traditions, more young students are tmggod to take on overly-significant leadership roles, which perpetuates lhe cycle. 
The cycle -the newest tradition -perpetuatml is "academic sui­cide." Basically that would be first and second year studnnts throw­ing tlrnmsnlves wholnheartedly into tlwsn traditions, trying to maintain the standard set by thnir predecPssors, al the nxpnnse of tfwir own ar.adnmic and physical lrnalth. They bncomn martyrs for the caus1•. The traditions wind up surviving, but Lhc studonts don't, or ii' tlrny do, it's with snvernly undermined academic records. Yet, this isn't why lhey came to ND! 
We haven't loarned to say "No, I'm committed to anotlrnr project" or "No, I need to get on top or my studins first." When we twist a "frim1d's" arm to get them involved in something, we show more concern for the survival of th11 tradition than we do their aca­demic survival. Moreover, there is 110 rnason why such evnnts and traditions need be "exclusively" African i\merican. We just cannot afford tbe burden of tnaching and cntnrtaining oursdves (and the dominant culture) to the degree that wo forget why wn came hem. 
Cnrtainlv, a lot can be accom­plishnd wfth a small numbnr of tal­nntnd, focused individuals working as a t11am. This is clear from tho number of African American orga­nizations that arc llourishing, with mature lead1ll'ship.

¦ So, WHAT'S Mv POINT? 
SMC Goal ofDiversity Must Be Attained 
Cable is now available in the dorms. Admissions are up this 

year for the first time in several years. We've been ranked the 
numbor one liboral arts school In tho mirlwest for thn fifth con­
secutive year. 
Hight now, we 
at Saint Marv's 
arn feeling rather 
proud of our­
Nakasha 
selves. Our ster­ling worth has been proven in 
Ahmad 

the l\irrn ol' awards and high• ----------------er admissions. 
(Not, of course, 

th.it we ever need1ld proof', b\lt still, it's always gratifying to 
receive affirmation ... ) 
Tt is therefore encouraging that in tho midst of this success, 
the Boa.rd of Trustees met last. weok (fittingly, during Black 
History Month) to discuss diversity and how to impn,vP thfl 
College's standing in this area. 
A lot of meetings about diversity -99 percent I would esti­
mate -are only that: Meetings. Meetings mean moro nHwtings 
which mean morfl meetings which mean more task forces · 
which mean more reports which mean even MOHE meetings ... 
Meetings can bticome a vicious eye!" in whid1 problems arn 
probed, solutions rhapsodized upon, suggestions offered. But 
f'ew, if any, of the suggestions can translate into concrete policy, 
and the very few that do are usually so radical as not to b1! 
impltlmented. 
In his book Ilow Washington Really Works, Charl<'s l'etPrs, a journalist covering Washington, D.C. -meeting mecca of' the fren world -commented that the morn work is b11ing dorw by an organization -the less meotings tlwre am. In an activn organization, things just get done, without having endless task forces pose, posturn and pontificate on it. 
Thus, meeting mania is not symptomatic of this collogn, or 
even educational institutions genf'rally, but of any bureaucratic 
machine that is trying to handle one or morn large and 
unwioldy tasks. 
While the Board of Trustees' mePting was all of tho abovo­described things and more, it also led to a rew very practical suggestions that might let this campus become mom divnrs,• in the next few years. 
There are those who say that the subjects of multiculturalism and diversity are boing heat to death by minority students. IL is not that those two topics arc tho only ones of' interost to us. Minority students are interested in and can speak about every topic under the sun (though the !'act that we are never heard· upon those other topics was highlight11d by Kimmi Martin in her letter to The Observer last week). But few topics arc as entwined in most (though maybe not am minority students' everyday exporience and existencn. 
It is always nice if an individual or institution adopts the con­cept of diversity and multiculturalism for il,; own sake. for the realization that we all am, in fact, oqual, and not limitNI into tho stereotypical boxes wo are usually locked into. 
But when the "niceness" argument fails, thPrn is only 01m 
thing left to do: bring out the economic argument. · 
This theory sounds terribly Marxist. And Marx was tlw pnrson who proposed tJ1at economic activity is bnhincl everything. While I would not unqualiliably agwe with him, I can't deny I.hat economics is a driving force in a lot of lmsinoss. 
According to the U.S. Census Bmnau. by 2001), ethnic minori­ties put together will hP the ethnic-majority in this country. So, the economic argum!1nt goos something likn this: Admissions may be up now, but if there is little or no improvmnent in the diversity at this campus, tlrnn minorities will not come here. And when minoritit,s becomi~ thii majority. if thii colhign hasn't maclo any new strides in promoting and welcoming divorsity. then admissions will go downhill. And the College will lose money. 
This is not to say that Saint Mary's ha.'i no r.ommitrn1mt to diversity whatsoever. In the tinw rhave been hore, th<'ro has been much mote talk of diversity, and moni people sc1\111 to want to chango tho luck of it hem. llowovor. I do say that thn commitment (on tho part of tho administration) has bPen loss than perfect. (I must also add, howevnr, that many of thn f'aeul­ty, esrwcially in cert.tin d(,partmenL'i. lni.tve nothing t.o ho <1'•sired in thoir commitment to and concern for many of ttws11 issues.) 
When Saint Mary's wants to improve itsnlf. it can.

Tm:hnology dmngns artt conL-rote 1tnd tangible; improving diwH'sity is u vagun goal with no set guidelines, and it is a very diflkult goal. llowevnr, the College bas proven that when it rnally wants to mPet a goal. it can.

ROAD TRIPS: Chicago and Windsor, Canada 

By JULIA GILLESPIE 
Assistant Scene Editor 

Do you ever find yourself' going crazy 111 South Bend? 
Does the University Park Mall just not do it for you? 
Are you frustrated with the food and service offered on Grape noad? 
How does a road trip sound? 

The month of February is tho shortest month of the year, but it seems like the longest when you live in South Bend. Sometimes it helps to try something fun and.get away for a day or the whole weekend. ThAre are several popular places that are less than a few hours away from campus. 
Some popular choices include Chicago, Windsor, Michigan City and nearby colleges. 
Talln1 a read trip II Chicago 
Chicago is the perfect getaway for many students. It is a mern 90 miles away from campus. You may either take the South Shore Train for $10 or take the Skyway into the city for the simple cost of' a few tolls and gas. 
You can tour the Windy City for the day, or stay the weekend with friends or family in the area. 
As soon as you approach the skyline you will forget how close you really are to campus. Lake Shore Drive is a beautiful wav to drive into Chicago. Lake Michigan is a striking sight, especially once you approach Navy Pier. 
Chicago offers students a wealth of options that range from museums, shopping, fine dining and excit­ing nightlifA. 
"Chicago is always the perfect place to go for either a few hours or the weekend. It's an exciting and fast­paced atmosphere sharply contrasts South Bend," said junior Kristin Grove. 
Some students enjoy the exhibits at the Field Museum of Natural History or the Science and Industry Museum. The Shedd Aquarium offers an interesting scope of underwater life. Its oceanarium is set on Lake Michigan and has hourly shows that exhibit dolphins. 
Lovers of Asian culture may discover something new at the Oriental Museum located on the City's south side in Hyde Park. Art lovers may enjoy a tour, such as the Mary Cassatt exhibit at the Art Institute on South Michigan. 
Gentlemen and young ladies may both find some­thing of interest on North Michigan Avenue. Interesting sights include Nike Town, FAO Schwartz, Borders Bookstore, Water Tower shopping center and Bloomingdales. There is something for every shopper. 
The tourists and fast-pace that characterize North Michigan Avenue turn off some students. Fortunately, there are unique shopping opportunities in Lincoln Park and Lake View where trnndy boutiquos and funky thrift shops border the streets. Tho Century Mall on Clark and Diversey offers a more intimate shopping atmosphere. 
Trendy stores, such as Sole .Junkies on Clark and Belmont sell shoes for men and women that can not be found anywhere in South 13cnd. Thrift stores, such as Oisgraceland on Clark and Aldine provide a large array of funky clothes perfect for any theme party. 
Arter an exhausting day of shopping there are a host of restaurants to choose from. Water Tower's Food Court offers a broad range of eating options that include everything from tofu to pizza. Farther South there are fun theme restaurants, such as Chicago's famous Hard Hock Caf6, Planet llollywood, Michael Jordan's and Ed Dabeveck's. 
If you are coming from the North Side you may enjoy stopping at the trendy Italian restaurant Mia Franchesca's. Or you and your friends might enjoy something a little less expensive, such as tlrn Mexican Rnstaurant El Jardin's. 
Chicago is also well known for its delicious Italian Restaurants, such as the Hosebud and Carmi,ws. 
After a late dinner those of you who are over 21 may enjoy hitting the nightlifo of downtown. I lot spot dance clubs range from Excalibur to Liquid and Dennis Hodman's favorite Crow Bar. NotrP Dame' graduates may often be spotted al Lincoln Park's dance club, Beaumont. 
Other fun sports bars in Wriglnyvi!l11 include Sluggers, Cubby Bear and IIi Tops. 
1111101 dewn In Wlndser, Canada 
Windsor, Canada, is a fun getaway that many stu­dents also enjoy. Although it is not the cultural metropolis of Chicago, it attracts many students under the age of 21. The legal drinking age there is 19. 
It is about a three-hour drive from campus and it is just outside of Detroit. 
Windsor is the perfect place to visit with anyone from Detroit if you want to eliminate the cost of lodg­ing. Otherwise, hotels are priced reasonably. 
The average hotel costs $130, which is reasonable when you split it amongst a group of pcopln. For example, tlrn Days Inn on the main strip ol' casinos is $120 per night. Don't forget that you earn morrny on the Canadian Currency exchange rate. 
Students of either sex enjoy the rocking Windsor Casino and trendy shops. You may find anything them from Cuban cigars to the perfect feather boa. 
There are fun restaurants, such as Peppers, to eat at once you get hungry. It is reasonably priced and has a fun dance floor. Peppers is famous for its deli­cious appetizers, such as their spinach dip.

It happened somewhere in West Virginia while trying to merge loft without cutting any­one off and looking for an exit with a McDonalds. 
My roomrnatt~s roared fo1• their lives as I screamer\ at the other ca!'s taking up t.he lane I wanted to move into. The other drivers seemed oblivious t.o my frustration until r nnally cut them all off and forced my way into th11ir lane. I heard the car behind me blare its horn and I waved and smiled at him. 
All seemed fine until my roommate spoko up from the backseat. of my car. Pull over right now, you psycho driver. You're done, she said. My turn at the wheel -my job as speed racer and captain -had ended. 
Near-death experi1rnce numb,~r two hap­pened somewhere in Georgia. I swear that I followed all of the rules from Drivers Ed ­mirror, signal. blind spot. go -but somehow, I did not see the car in the right lane. I c<wtainly heard his car horn, however, as he followed behind me for the next few minutes. 
Don't get me wrong: I am not a bad driver. I've never even been pulled over. No warnings, no tickets, no crashes (knock on wood). I just seem to have a problem when I don't know where f am going, which, with my stellar snnse of direction, is just about all of the time. 
Lucky fol' me. however, the near death expe­riences have yet to put n damper on my partic­ipation in one of the best weekend activities ever invented -the road trip. 
What is it a.bout about thH combination of a full tank of gas, a loud radio, a road map and a car full of friends that makes even the longest trips seem like adventures? I cannot give an exact answer. but I prefer to believn it's the sense of possibility that makes it all so much 
fun. 
Taking a road trip -a real road trip ­means not following a specific minute-by­minute plan. It means getting some vague directions, hitting the road and seeing whcro it goes. Want to stop at that sketchy restaurant with the big neon sign that says "Oasis?" Then stop, Want to get off the highway and drive through a different city or a famous place'? Then get off. Through truck stops and rc>st areas. side roads and highways, them is always someone new to meet or something n11w to se11. 
Besides the speed limit, no one makes rules when you take a road trip. It's you, your friends, the car and the open road, driving away, from reality and into the unknown. And when that happens, as Bruce Springsteen told us all in a Thunder Hoad,"Thesc two lanes can take us anywhere." 
It's the feeling of going somewhere that mat­ters on the road. Not wlwn you get tlwrn, not how you get t.hern, not nven if' you get there at all. Just going, with endless possibilities ahead and miles of highway behind. It's tlw good con­versations and tho good radio stations. It's watching out the vvindow as you drivo hy pieces of' America. 
Never mind the nnur d(!alh expPrienrns, thP spetiding tickets or Urn otlwr angry drivers on tho road. They r.mmot erasii thn adventurP and the freedom of a road trip. 
So what arc you waiting !'or'? I lit tho road.

Fencers' home meet provides chance for student support 
•¦ •NBA · 

Lakers fire Harris after tfiree-game losing skid 
By MIKE CONNOLLY 
Sporrs Writer 

If you are like most students on this campus, you probably know as much about the elections in Lithuania as you do about fencing. You may think that a foil is something your mom used to wrap your sandwich or that Sara Walsh is Brenda's long-lost sister on 90210. 
And it would be a shame that. with one of the top fencing teams in the country practicing just minutes from your dorm room. you still do not plan to support them when they take on top Midwest com­petition this weekend at the Joyce Center. 
Many students might claim that because they don't know anything about the sport, 
,,_..., they don't want the attend the meets. If simple ignorance is the only reason why our fencing team toils in relative anonymity. I hope that perhaps this sim­ple beginner's guide to fencing might enlighten you to this great sport and increase the support for these top-level athletes. The basic premise behind fencing is very simple: Hit your opponent before he hits you. From this basic goal. strategy and tactics arise that give fencing its excitement and drama. There am three weapons in fencing: foil, epee and sabre. Men compete with all three weapons while women compeie in epee and foil only. Tlw foil is the most slender of all the weapons. Its target area is also the small­est. Only touches to the torso -not the head, arms or legs -made with the tip of the weapon count. Tlw 1ipee is a thicker wi. apon and has a larger target area. A fencer may touch the 
• 
tip of the weapon to the torso, arms or legs of his opponent and still score a point. 
The sabre is the most unique of the three weapons. A sabre touch can be scored anywhere on the body and with any part of the blade. 
'.\low that you possess a rudimentary knowlr,dge of fencing, you are ready to head over to the Joyce Center to watch the Midwest Championships on Saturday and Sunday. The meet lasts all weekend and tlwre are many storylines worth. watching. 
The men's epee team lost only one Midwest match all year. Lawrence University downed the Irish 5-4 last week­end in Appleton, Wis. Now the Irish have Lawrence in their house and in the words of two-time All-American C.J. Jackson, "I have nothing but revenge on my mind." 
The epee clash between the Irish and Lawrence this weekend is certainly a bout to see. 
The women's epee team will also have several bouts that should not be missed this weekend. Two-time All-American Magda Krol and All-American captain Nicole Mustilli lead the Irish against the Buckeyes of Ohio Statfi and the Wildcats of Northwestern. Both squads have previ­ously defeated the frish. 
Lo.ok for the epeeists. however, to fence stronger this weekend and send the Buckeves and the Wildcats home with sound· dr,feats. 
The men's foil team should continue its steady play this weekend. Captain Stephane Auriol, who once starn•d in a Nerf Fencing commercial, leads the Irish squad into battle. 
If you aren't looking for close bouts and would instead prefer to see a blow-out, look no further than the men's sabre team. Led by 1998 NCM champion Luke LaValle, the sabre team is undefeated on the season and has yet to be seriously challenged. 
The "Fabulous Freshmen," Andre Crompton and Gabor Szelle, have teamed with LaValle to form by far the best sabre team in the country. So if seeing teams like Michigan, Ohio State and Purdue get crushed is what excites vou, be sure to watch the sabre team. · 
If you only see one match this weekend, make sure you don't miss the women's foil team take on Ohio State. 
Both meetings between these two squads have been tough. The Irish won the first meeting 11-5 and the second meeting 10-6. As a team the Irish should have no trouble beating the Buckeyes for the third time this year. The bouts to watch will be the onus in involving Irish fencers Sara Walsh, Myriah Brown and Buckeye foilist Yelena Kalkina. 
Seniors Walsh and Brown are three­time All-Americans who could become the first four-time Irish All-Americans since Molly Sullivan in 1985-88. 
Kalkina -a two-time All-American who 
also won the 1997 NCAA championship ­
is the only foncer who has managed to 
defeat Walsh on the year. 
The matches last all day both Saturday and Sunday. So come on out and support one of the most successful teams in Irish history. 


INGLEWOOD, Calif. In with the Worm, and out with the coach. 
The. slumping Los Angeles Lakers, consi.defed one ofthe teamSto beat in th~.N~~ tht's S(lll$On; fire~f.<ooach.. Del 
Harris ()J} Wedn-OS(iay on '.tire }!eel$ of three r9ad losses in as many days. 
The move was announced while 
Dennis Rodman, the NBA's leading 
rebounder the last seven seasons, was 
participating in his first practice ses­
sion wi.ththe team aftersigrting a con­
trac ' 
J presi­der ·. •.···••··•·· ... sketbaU (jpl)'r ....•.··· .....·· s, said 
that ()lie of two assistants --Kurt Rambis or Larry brew -,-will succeed Harris for at least the rest of the sea­son. 
West said longtime assistant Bill 
Bertka .will .handle the h~ad coaching 
duliflf'l'hursday.nigt:)t.~gainst the 
winlessLos Angeles.Clippers in 
Anaheim before a decision is made on 
Drew or Rambis, both former Lakers 
players.. 
West didn't say when a final deci­sion would be made, and added he had n% spoken to former Chicago BuUs. £1;:lfhPhU Jackson or anyone else,,oecause things happened so 
quickly, •. 
"It'i, 'always difficult to t.alk about 
hypotheticals, but if that situation is 
presented, I know that Phil would look 
at that carefully," Jackson's agent, 
Todd Musburger, said by telephone. 
Wostpointed out the Lakets usually 
hire,coaclles from .. within.and Harris 
said he hoped Ram.bis or Drew would 
get thejob. 
"I just feel the last two games we've 
played have not been acceptable," 
West said, referring to a 117-113 
overtime loss :in Denver on Monday 
night and a 93-83 .1oss ·at Vancouver 
on Tft~S~ay, night. "tjust felt like there 
was a··deterioration." 
DonvQr's victory was only its second 
in 10 .games this season, and the 
GrizzUes had never b.eaten Los 
Angeles in 12 previous garMs. 
"[ talked to [owner] Jerry }3uss this . motnit}~ ij,nd we just felt1ike the time 
wa~,rL~. ·.....· ow/' ~.est $ald. "Right 
nuvv/~t oo .· Hkeiwe ;r~<~6.undortrig. 
111at'sinot'.whatthe fanspayto see." 
Thfiosses left the young, talented 
Lakors.at 6-6 with 38 games remain­
ing in the abbreviated season. 
"Particularly for me, the thing that 
makes. it so awkward is that Doi has 
been a friend for many years," West 
saif ..The direction of a team is very 
important, We do feel like we have the 
talent here." 
Harris, 61, was in his fifth season. 
He guided the Lakers to a 224-116 
record and improved their regular­
season record in four consecutive 
years, a feat accomplished by only 
eightotlrnr coaches in NBA history. 
''I don't feel like a loser today," Hairis ,said. "There will be other doors, that will open for me. Tht•re always have been when other doors have closed. 
"I was hoping today to tell my team 
that everybody's laughing at us today, 
but we're going to have the last 
laugh." 
Harris has been under criticism 
from many directions the last few 
years despite his team's improvement 
every year. Two years ago, the Lake rs 
lost to the Utah Jazz in the Western 
Conference semifinals and last spring 
were swept by the Jazz in the confer­
ence finals. 
Despite the fact that star Shaquille 
O'Neal missed 22 games last season, 
the Lakers had a 61-21 regular-sea­
son record -one of the best in the 
league. 
"This team will mature," Harris 
said. "It's already an outstanding 
team. Forget 6-6. This team is better 
than 6-6. I don't have any excuses to 
make. This team could go on a 10­
game winning streak whether I was 
here or not. 
"I think it was a reasonable deci­
sion,'' Harris added of being fired 
although he admitted he was disap­
pointed he couldn't at least finish the 
season. "I enjoyed being with this 
bunch. Whoever takes my place will 
not have failed irthey don't win it this 
year;" 
Harris' contract runs out after this 
season. 
Most of the team that won almost three-quarters of its games and reached the conference finals is back thisy~ar, but the Lakers have been ·· on~again, off-again since the start of 
the campaign.

What Am I Going to Do with My Life? 
Jim Lies, C.S.C. 

"I'm not sure." There is only one other phrase, probably, that I've spoken more often than 'Tm not sure," and it's, "I don't know." 
When I was younger I thought that as 1grew older, with more educa­tion and experience, I would have fewer and fewer occasions to use these phrases. And yet, as I have gained so much in the way of education and experience, I find myself using just such phrases all the more. 
Some years ago, a senior here at Notre Dame told the story that when she was a first year student she was pretty sure she wanted to be an attorney. She studied like a future Supreme Court justice, giving herself entirely to that future goal. She even began to pick out law schools. As time passed, and with more education and experience, she became less certain. For vari­ous reasons, some which she didn't understand herself, she grew less sure about being an attorney by the time her second semester senior year rolled around. When asked about what she was going to do after graduation some four short months away, she would say, "I don't know." This was difficult not only because she felt the need to be certain, but because she felt like she owed it to others, especially to her parents, to be certain, and to be success­ful. 
Although the story of Jesus tells us that what we do is important, it also tells us that how we do what we do is often more important. Jesus was somewhat of a wandering preacher and teacher who told people who seemed sure of what God wanted of them, and sure of an exact way to be saved, that perhaps they ought to think again. Jesus welcomed with love all people, especially those most brutally excluded by society. It was not just what Jesus did that revealed him as God, but how he did it. Christianity is first and foremost a way of living in the world. 
We are well into the second semester. At times it may seem like the pressure is on. There is that popular question, "What are you going to do?" Anxiety seems to go hand-in-hand with unsurety; and at this point in our lives we expect to grow in certainty, not uncertainty. Perhaps many of us, especially seniors in their final semester, are realizing that when it comes to discerning a job choice or a career, 100% certainty is at least unlikely and probably impossible. 
Maybe one of the most important benefits of education and experi­ence is a dispelling of the ways in which we are tempted to oversimplify the complexities of life. There is something about dying and rising in all of this, a dying and rising w:1ich takes place during this life, and which we celebrate during the Lenten and Easter seasons. Hopefully, we die to old ways of see­ing ourselves that were narrow and exact in order to continually rise to new ways of seeing ourselves and others; a dying and rising that allows us the freedom to change and appreciate the ability of others to change; a dying and rising that heightens our appreciation of the Paschal Mystery. Maybe we have to let go of that image of ourselves that is so sure of ourselves, and that seems not to need God. Perhaps this dying and rising calls us to be a·lit­tle more comfortable with not being so sure all of the time, and not knowing everything there is to know, exactly. What else is faith for but to give us the surety to rest comfortably in the unsurety. 
I don't need to say that what we do with our lives is important. Our choices can have a great impact on ourselves and on our world. However, maybe the question which should precede "What do I want to do?" is "How do I want to be?" And maybe then our uncertainty can move us ever closer to the truth of our lives, and of our faith; and ever closer to our God. Maybe the most important thing is not always what we do with our lives, but how we do it. Maybe it's time to rest, even revel, in the uncertainty, as a means by which we surrender our own wills to the will of our God. It's time to consider not so much what we do as the measure of our success, or how much money we make, or the status of our particular job or occupation; but rather, to consider how we choose to live our lives in whatever we choose to do; and whether we have welcomed the surety of God into the unsurety of our lives.

for different reasons than what 
Bailey had in mind." 
Nevertheless, Iacobucci, Mcghan Eckstein, Hrittany K1lne and Jill Matalavage chose to stick with Bailey's tougher stan· dards until graduation. 
From an original cast of eleven freshmen, the Class or '99 men are now reprns1rnted by Mike Doyle, Scott Zumbach, Vince Kuna and captains Fugate and Steele Whowell. 
The same year the women's and men's teams separated was Notre Dame's first year in the Big East. Not even the upper­classmen could give advice or make predictions about the new conference. With the new confer­ence to face and Weathers was hired at the last minute, the team's direction was uncertain. 
"The first year was almost chaos," Kline said. "We didn't even know we were getting a new coach, and we didn't know what to expect from him." 
Fortunately, the change proved to be for the better. 
"Since Bailey came in when we were freshmen, we've been on our way to our long term goals," Iacobucci said. "I was sad about the break-up of the team, but I'm glad I'll be part of this history." 
"We've done a complete 180 since freshman year, and I know a lot of it's due to Bailey coming in," Eckstein said. 
Upon entering the Big East, the Irish Sports Report picked the Irish men's swimmers to place dead last and the women near the bottom at Championships. With significant contributions from the freshman Class of '99, 
the men placed seventh and the 
women third. 
Since then, the women have won the confernnce title twice and the men are aiming to taku second place this year. 
"Our main goal of the first year in the Big East was not to win the meet. It was lo place as many peoplo as we could in the top 16," Kline said. "Now we're trying to qualify as many a.s we can for Ithe NCAA Championships)." 
"All of us have been through some tough times at the begin­ning of our career, and as we got older, we've really excelled and gotten faster over the years," Fugatfl said. 
But it is the team culture that has undergone the most change, according to Pugate. In the past, group activities outside of the pool were often allowed to inter­

-
fere with performance in the water; the seniors now stress that they let nothing come between them and their goals. 
"Our freshman year. being on the team was more of a partying thing," Kuna explained. "Since then, we've curtailed the party­ing and fo~:used on getting faster as a team. 
The uniqueness of' the men's Class of '99 has always been evi­dent. When they were freshmen, coach Tim Welsh labeled them the most talented class Notre Dame swimming had ever had. 
"Ever since our freshman year, we were really the dominant class," Whowell said. "The close­ness of our cla'is and our leader­ship skills both in and out of the pool have brought the team to where it is."

McGwire in spotlight again after off season 
Associated Press 
JUPITER. Pia. 

Mark McGwire was back behind the microphones Wednesday, laughing off predic­tions of 80 home runs and defending his use of muscle pills. 
It was like he never left. 

As about 100 reporters watched and three sports net­works broadcast the spring train­ing news ronference live, McGwire said he was willing to discuss his record 70 home runs only until the new season starts in April. 
''I'm mentally prepared to talk about last year up until the last day of spring training," McGwire said. "Once the season starts. talking about 70 is gone. 1 think 
-
it's foolish to think I'm going to carry this over and talk about last year." 
McGwire said he would contin­ue using androstenedione, the controversial muscle-building supplement that is prohibited by the NFL, NCAA and International Olympic Committee. At a drug conference last month, JOC vice president Dick Pound said base­ball had allowed McGwire to become a "souped-up hero" by not banning andro. 
"Major league baseball is not the IOC," McGwire said. "And it has absolutely nothing to do with me hitting a baseball. I don't endorse the produce. I never did. Somoonr, stuck a nose in my locker." 
At spring training last year, only about 20 reporters showed up for the first full-squad work­out. But that was before McGwire beat Hoger Maris' single-season record by nine home runs. 
On Wednesday, fans crowded against the fence to watch McGwire and his teammates go through their first full-squad workout, a mostly humdrum rou­tine. They even kept track of the 12 home runs he it in batting practice. 
"J couldn't believe the turnout from the fans," McGwire said. "That was amazing. Then all of you guys. I've never been in a first day of spring training like this evPr." 
He talked almost disbelievingly about all the attention he received in the offseason, being interrupted in restaurants by fans who told him how much his accomplishment meant to them -whcr<> they were when it hap­pened and how some had named their children after him. 
"I've never had so many people join me for dinner." he said. 
The biggest revelation during the hour-long news conference was that the most pressure he 
-felt last season came after he topped Maris and had to fend off Sammy Sosa. McGwire had insisted that he didn't care who ended up with more homers. 
"Sammy Sosa had a pretty damn good year and he was right there with me," McGwire said. "When I broke that record, I knew there was a lot of time left in the season, and I knew what he was doing. 
"All across America, the most­asked question was, 'Did he hit one?' That's sort of tough when you're playing a team sport." 
Two major milestones are up ahead for McGwire. lie needs 43 homers to become the 16th play­er to reach 500, and can become the first to hit 50 or more in four consecutive seasons. 
Can McGwire top 70? "Anything's possible," he said. Manager Tony La Russa pre­
dicted 75 for McGwire in January and new teammate Carlos 
Baerga forecasts 80. That brought another laugh from McGwire. 
"Geez, I'd definitelv retire if l did that," he said. "There's no more reason to play after that." 
But McGwire said he won't be disappointed if he falls far short of 70. 
'Tm sure that no matter what I do this year, if I don't hit 70, someone will say I had an off year," McGwire said. 
McG¼ire said he'd like to play at least live more years, but that he would "walk away" from baseball if there was another work stoppage. The current labor agreement is likely to expire after the 2001 season. 
McGwire also criticized a story last week that exaggerated his security arrangements. 
"No, I do not have body­guards," he said. "I don't need any bodyguards. I don't want any."

Irish unable to weather Storm 

By AlAN WASIELEWSK1 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame hung in as long as 
it could Wednesday night, but 
Irish turnovers and fatigue 
allow<'d seventh-ranked St. 
John's to achiev<1 a 73-53 victorv. 
In the first half, Notre Dame\ 
zonr, dr,fense forced the Red 
Storm to work for every point 
and stopped oach of the team's 
12 thren-point-shot attempts. 
Tho Irish controlled defensive 
robounding and slowrid down tho 
first-half tempo enough to stay 
with St. John's. 
"Wo did a lot of things we 
wantPd to do," head coach John 
MacLeod said, "but we started 
taking quick shots ,lnd picking 
up the tempo." 
That fell right into line with the St. John's game plan. 
Led by freshman Erick Barklny, the Rod Storm convert­ed on almost ,wery Irish turnover, but Notre Dame fresh­man Troy Murphy, in his first collegiate game at Madison Squarr, Garden. did his best tu kenp the Irish in Lhe game.

Karl Malone style-and an NBA­

shot clock kept the Irish -fitrong 
during the first half. 
Notre Dame led by nine points 
with six minutes left in the hair, 
and while a run immediately 
before halftime let St. John's 
inch back in the game, the Irish 
were still in good shape. Behind 
by just two eoints at tho buzzer, 
the slow-down game plan was 
working perfectly. 
However, just like the West 
Virginia game last Sunday, Notre 
Dame came out 11at after half­
time. 

Missing their 11rst live shots, Notre Dame allowed St. John's to push the ball up the lloor and convert some easy layups. With Martin Ingelsby out of tho game with a sprained ankle, the Irish were hurting for ballhandlers, and St. .John's head coach Mike Jarvis took advantagn by apply­ing full-court pressure for the rest of the contest. 
"We started to succumb to the pressure and taking quick shots, exactly what they wanted us to 1o," MacLeod said. "We started

Arkansas didn ·t trail the final 29 minutes although Auburn (25­

Prior to the loss. Auburn's average margin of victory was 
23.2 points per game and the Tigers had only one victory under double digits. They were allowing an average of 59 points per game.

Brandon Dean came off the bench and scored seven as the lead climbed to 73-57 with 11 :26 to play. At that point, Arkansas had converted 13 turnovers into 21 points. Auburn was averaging 11 turnovers per game. The lead reached 20 on llood's alley-oop pass to Dean with 8:27 left. 
Bradley made all four ol' his three-point shots in the first half and Walker was good on 3-of-4 as the Razorbacks built a 44-40 halftime lead. 
Arkansas scored IO straight for a 12-7 lead, but Pohlman's thrnn from the corner started a 6-0 run that put the Tigers back in front.
