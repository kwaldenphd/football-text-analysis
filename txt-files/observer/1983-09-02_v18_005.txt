Soviets shoot down jet: 
US enraged over Russian aggression 
WASHINGTON (AP) · The United States said Thursday a heat-seeking mis.')ile fired by a Soviet fighter pilot destroyed a South Korean 747 com­mercial jetliner which strayed near a Kremlin military outpost on an is­land near Japan. There was virtually no hope for the 269 people aboard, i .nduding Rep. Larry McDonald, D­Ga. 
Secretary ofState George P. Shultz declared there is "no excuse whatever for this appalling act." 
Though the jumbo jet was in Soviet airspace above Sakhalin, an is· land · whose southernmost tip is within 100 miles of Japan, "There are no circumstances that can jus­tify" the attack, a White House spokesman said. 
The missile was fired, said Pen­tagon intelligence officials, by an SU­15, a 1960s-vintage interceptor, and one _of eight fighters which tracked the airliner. The Soviets have a fighter base on Sakhalin, a moun­tainous island 20 miles from the Soviet Union's east coast. 
Shultz was ordered by President Reagan, vacationing in California, to seek an "immediate and full ac· count" from the Soviets. According to Korean Air Lines, at least 30 Americans were aboard. 
No excuse whatever for this appalling act 
II 
The KAL jumbo jet was blown from the skies at 2:26p.m. EDT Wed­nesday, U.S. officials said. The flight originated in New York, had refueled in Anchorage, Alaska, and twas about 1,000 miles from its des­tination, Seoul, when it was shot down. 
The Soviet pilot was close enough to see the airliner, and the Soviets had tracked it for 2 hours, ample op­portunity to know it was a civilian flight, officials said. At first, defense officials said the plane which fired the missile was a MiG 23, one of the Soviet Union's best and fastest fighters. Later, however, they said it 
appeared  to  have been  an  SU-15,  
code-named flagon.  
Intelligence  sources  said  the  

Soviets have about 35 SU-15s and 30 
MiG 23s based at Sakhalin. 
The Kremlin's first public com­ment was an anemic Tass story which said the South Korean plane "has been lost," and made no men­tion of a military attack. Later, Tass changed its story to say that an "unidentified aircraft" twice vi­olated Soviet airspace over Sakhalin and that Soviet fights "were sent aloft" to try to help it land. The plane ignored "signals and warnings," Tass said, then "continued its flight in the direction of the Sea ofJapan." Again, the account said nothing of the plane being shot down. 
Whatever the Soviet motive, said presidential spokesman Larry Speakes, "There are no cir­cumstances that can justify the un­precedented attack on an unarmed civilian aircraft." 
In New York, U.S. officials said the United States was "very, very active­ly considering" calling for action on the matter by the U.N. Security CounciL That could hardly prove more than a gesture of form, since the Soviet Union, like the United States, has veto power over the council. 
Some leaders of Congress called for reliation against the Soviets. Senate Democratic leader Robert C. Byrd ofWest Virginia said the United States should immediately cancel its new grain sale to Moscow in return for the "reprehensible, horrible, in­excusable and outrageous" Soviet behavior. 
Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., agreed, saying "To be feeding the pilot who shot that missile at this plane with our wheat, I find to be unacceptable morally. And I think if we refuse to do so there is a chance that we will change Soviet behavior over a long period oftime." 
Senate Republican leader Howard Baker Jr. of Tennesee said "Such a brazen attack on a commercial plane carrying civilian passengers is reprehensible, and think it demands the utmost scrutiny and at­tention." 
An aide to McDonald suggested the Soviets may have shot down the plane because they knew the congressman, a staunch anti­communist, was aboard. "We think of him as the first victim of World

Braniff reorganization plan cleared for takeoff by judge 
FOHT WORTH, Tx (AP)-A federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday approved a reorganization plan which would put the grounded BraniffInternation­al airlines back in business. 
lJ.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Flowers approved a proposal by the Chicago-based Hyatt Corp., which could put 30 of Hraniff's grounded jetliners and 2,000 of its former employees back to work. 
Oppcnents have 10 days to appeal the decision. 
The Hyatt Corp., a hotel chain, proposed invest­
ing !70 million in cash and loan guarantees in ex­
change for 80 percent ofthe new airline's stock. 
Hyatt's plan would pur 2,000 employees and 30 planes back to work this winter, ending a lengthy court battle that began when Braniff, saddled with a I 1 billion debt, halted operations May 12, 1982. 
Early the next day Braniff, which had about 9,000 employees and 60 jets, sought protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy laws. 
An earlier Braniff reorganization attempt, calling for Branift. to lease planes to Pacific Southwest Airlines, was scrapped by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals. 
On Wednesday, the Hyatt plan won the approval ofthe federal Pension Rl'nefit Guaranty Corp. 
The federal agency guarantees a certain level of pension benefits for the various Braniff employees -teamsters, machinists and management person­nel. The agency had objected to the Hyatr plan, saying it was not receiving enough money to fulfill its obligations toward Braniffemployees. 
Braniff would pay the pension concern $ t mil­lion in cash and provide it with warrants for 500,000 shares ofstock in the new company under the settlement approved Wednesday by Flowers. 
Braniff vice president Steven Turoff said the stock would be worth ! 15.21 a share -or whatever the price is at the first public offering. 
Reagan orders Naval reinforcements to back Marines in Lebanon 
WASHINGTON (AP -:-President Reagan today ordered a Naval am­phibious force to the '\1editerranean to hack up U.S. Marines in Lebanon and also directed the aircraft carrier Dwight 0. Eisenhower to remain in the region. 
Larry Speakes, the deputy White House spokesman, told reporters in Santa Barbara, Calif., that Reagan had directed "that all necessary measures he taken to assure the safety of of the Marines in Heirut. including the deployment of an ad· ditional Naval amphibious torce the the Mediterranean." 
Speakes appeared on national television from California whert· Reagan is vacationing. 
Reagan's actions appeared to rdlect concern over public rt'action to the attacks on the 1,200-memher '\1arine contingent in the Beirut area in recent days. Two \tarinl's ha\'e heen killed and 14 injured. 
There were apparently no nl'w at­tacks on the Marines today, hut Speakes said some shells fell near thl' residence ofU.S. Ambassador Rohl'rt Oillon, with at least some of them fired from territory controlled hy Syrian forces. 

Explaining the lJ.S. mtsswn in Lebanon, Speakes said, "We are in­volved in Lebanon because our et~ fort is indispensable to the sovereignty and integrity of that country and to the go\'t:rn mt:nt's ability to restore order and stability throughout its tt:rritory."

Tuition tax .credits? 
Jusl hefore its summer adjournmenl. the Supreme Court handed down an important decision which may eventually concern a great deal of us. In a 5-'* decision, tht.· justices held that parents should he allowed tax deductions for the expenses of sending their children to private schools. 
Tuition tax <:redits? The idea may not he as far in the future as we may think. Minnesota permits deductions as much as 5500 for l'lementary school children and 5700 t<>r secondary students. The Minnesota plan is cur­rently in some legislative hopper in Congress, where it may he some time het<>re it sees the light ofday. 
Tuition tax credits are not a new idea. The idea be­hind the tuition tax credit is to help those middle­income families who could not easily aft<>rd the price of sending their children to school. The tax credit would come hy lowering the parents taxable income by the amount it costs to send their children to school. Thus, a family whose taxable inc•Jme is 535,000 a year and which spends 52,000 in tui­tion would have a lowered

Inside Friday 
criticisms have been made of such a plan. One of the loudest of these is the fear that if approved, public­school systems may begin to charge t<>r books and other school supplies as a means of deferring expenses, knowing that parenls could claim the expenses as a deduction at the end of the year. The ramifications are dear: the plan could he the beginning of the end of a free public-education system. 
Another argument against the plan has been that the 
program would violate the constitutional separation of church and state. One thing that has been ignored, 

made available for govern­ment loans and grants. The laws governing the eligibility requiremnents and dis­tribution of these loans were liberalized in the late 1970s under the Carter administration. Without strict regulations, almost any person could get a loan. 
Then came the Reagan administration and the sweep­ing budget cuts. Many social programs fell prey to the budgetary ax; money available for loans and grants became more difficult to get. Not only was there less money to go around, but the eligibility requirements became stricter. The outcries began and the sugges­tions for tuition tax credit were heard again. 
President Reagan has appeared sincere in his desire to see a tuition tax credit program since his presidential campaign. As before, however, the biggest hurdle to such a plan making it through Congress is the fact that the tax credit J>lan would only help to increase the deficit, just the opposite ofwhat the Reagan administra­tion has been trying to do. 
Besides the fear of an increasing detkit, other 
course, government dollars 
should not be used to pay for an individual's choice, opponents will argue. Get the point? The argument is circular and could go on forever. One thing is clear, however. Tax credits would he a trem endous plus for private schools. The deduc­tions would make it easier for many parents to afford a private school and to give them more freedom in select­ing the best education for their children.

Prosecutors said Gray sexually abused the child, sutli>cated her by holding her head in a mud puddle and then threw her body from a bridge. 
The 5-foot-8, 140-pound Gray was on parole at the time from an Arizona conviction for killing his 16­year-old high school swet:theart. 
After learning of the Supreme Court decision, Thigpen told repor­ters at the penitentiary that it was "more than likely" Gray would die without further delay in his 7-year­old case, which has been before more than SO judges and beti>re the SuprefT'e Court t(mr times. 
One of his lawyers, Dennis Balske of Montgomery, Ala., said the attor­neys planned no further appeals or requests for clemency, saying: "We have received the final word and we take it as final ... we really have nowhere else to go." 
Gray would become the first per­son to be put to death in Mississippi since 1964 and the eighth in the na· tion since a 1976 Supreme Court ruling giving the states the go-ahead to use capital punishment. 
His fourth try at a Supreme Court stay was based on his lawyers' claim that use of a gas chamber was cruel and unusual punishment, which the Constitution ti>rbids.

Carter alters stance on Salvadoran policy 
WASHINGTON ( AP) -Former President Jimmy Cartt:r, who recently described the Salvadoran government as "one of the 010st bloodthirsty" in the world, said Thursday he believes the United States should support that govern­ment while insisting on improved protection of human rights there. 
Speaking with reporters after 
· testifYing t in private beti>re the Naional Commission on Central America headed b)' former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, Carter said he agrees with the administra­tion that it is proper for the United States to oppose Nicaraguan-based subversion and to support the Sal­vadoran govc:rnmt:nt. 
"At the same time, we should pursue aggressi\'ely the alleviation of social suffering and the enhance­ment of human rights," Carter said. 
Carter said he has no doubt that such a policy would win adequate support from tht: American public and Congress when combined with 
U.S. support for regional peacemak­ing efforts. 
Carter's remarks appeared to con­trast sharply with those he made six wet:ks ago when he said. "I don't agree: with what President Reagan is doing in Central America."

At the time, he said Reagan had revt:rst:d his policy of linking military aid to improved human rights pt·rformance in El Salvador, which ht: described as "one of tht.• most bloodthirsty regimes, perhaps in the world." 
He accused the Salvador~m government of having killed .-\0,000 to 35,000 of its own people.

Carter suggested he had no quar­rel with li.S. military activities in Honduras and oft' the: Central American <:oast. 
"I think as long as our military ac­tions there are overt in naturt·, well understood hy tht:' partil.'ipating parties, understood by the American people and the Congress, there are no adverse const:quc:nces of it," he said.

Undersecretary ofState Lawrence Eagkhurger summoned \1oscow's acting ambassador, Oleg Sokolov, to the State Department Wednesday morning to demand an explanation. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Burt said he awoke Sokolov at home with a telephone call during the night. when it became known some­thing had happened to the aircraft over Soviet territ(H-y. 
But hours later, Burt told repor­ters, "They have told us nothing so far." 
Shultz said, "We can see no ex­planation whatever for shooting down an unarmed commerdal air­lim:r, no matter whether it is in your air space or not." 
The incident came at a time when LIS-Soviet relations have heen improving slightly. Washington and \1ost·ow last V\·eek signed a five-year grain salt' agreement, and the Reagan administration recently lificd restrictions on sales of pipeline-laying equipment. 
Both nations f(mnd a face-saving way to return a Soviet diplomat's teen-age son to Moscow after he ap­parently wrote a letter to Reagan saying he wanted to remain in the lJnited States, an act that touched off a week-long diplomatic stalemate. 

appalling and wanton misdeed 
SANTA BARBARA, CA. (AP) ­President Reagan, condemning the downing of an unarmed South Korean jetliner as "a horrifying act of violence," prepared Thursday to cut short his vacation to deal with the incident and with turmoil in Lebanon. 
The White Bouse at first an­nounced that Reagan would return to Washington on Saturday, two days earlier than planned, for meetings with national security ad­visers and congressional leaders, but several hours later said he would leave California friday morning. 
Earlier Thursday, Reagan said that Moscow's explanation for the inci­dent was totally inadequate. At the same time, the president ordered flags on U.S. federal buiidings and military installations lowered to half staff. The victims of the plane attack included a congressman, Rep. Larry McDonald, D-Ga. 
Deputy White House press secn:tary Larry Speakes said Reagan would meet with his national security advisers immediately on his return to Washington, about 6 p.m. EDT friday, and hoped to confer with congressional leaders on Satur­day.

l'nder the earlier plans. a National Security Council meeting was set for Saturday followed hy a Sunday meeting with congressional leaders. 
Ex t plaining the advance in schedule, Speakes said, "We would like to review it (the downing of the South Korean plane) as quickly as we can." 
Also, Speakes said, "We found we could get the people we wanted to­gether tomorrow and it would he hest to proceed tomorrow." 
Speakes noted that a meeting of the United Nations Security Council at the request of the United States is expected Friday. He said, "I think we'll have sufficient information on hand tomorrow to review the situa­tion." 
The president, before he leaves California. will make a statement at the Point Mugu Naval Air Station, likely on the plane and the turmoil in Lebanon. It would be his second on those subjects in two days. 
·wor"ds can scarcely express our revulsion at this horrifying act of violence," the president said Thursday. "The United States joins with other members of the interna­tional community in demanding a full explanation for this appalling and wanton misdeed." 
"The Soviet statements to this mo­
ment have totally failed to explain 
how or why this tragedy has oc­
curred," Reagan said in a statement 
read by Speakes.

"Indeed, the whole incident ap­pears to be inexplicable to civilized people everyv.,here," the president said. 
Speakes registered the president's "disgust that the entire worl t d feels at the barbarity of the Soviet go\'ern­ment in shooting down an unarmed plane." 
Speakes told reporters an explana­tion provided by Soviet Foreign Min­ister Andrei Gromyko closely paralleled an account from the Soviet news agency Tass. It said the jetliner did not respond to queries and that the Soviet fighter planes tried to direct it to the nearest air­field "but the intruder plane did not react to the signal and warnings." 
Speakes said an interagency group ofnational security departments and agencies had provided a number of options and recommendations on steps tl1t United States might take. "We've taken no steps," said Speakes. 
In addition, he said the United States has not set a timetable for the Soviet Union to provide what the United States considers to be an in­
adequate explanation  of the  inci­ 
dent.  
For  the  moment,  Reagan  still  

planned to travel to Florida on Mon­day to attend a picnic at the Ken­nedy Space Center, but those plans are under review now, Speakes said.

Shuttle experiments continue 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) ­The "red-eye spedal" space shurtle astronauts were roused with the Penn State University tight song Thursday night for another day of experiments with Challenger's space crane. a 50-foot-long mechani­cal imitation of a human arm. 
"I really enjoyed that Nittany fight song," said astronaut Guion Hluford, a Philadelphian who received his bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering from Penn State in 1964. The school's teams are known as the Nittany Lions. 
Mission control started referring to the eighth shuttle flight as the "red-eye special" because the astronauts begin their sleep in after­noon and start their day late at night. 
The arm demonstrated on Thursday it can do the heavy lifting that may some day be needed to build an outpost in space. But more tests were scheduled for Friday, the ship's fourth day in space. 
"It sure is a fine piece of mac­hinery," said Richard Truly, com­mander of the space shuttle. "It worked like a champ." 
On awakening, Truly spoke of seeing"a couple ofspectacular·night passes" over Africa, the Middle East, the Nile River Valley, Israel, jordan, Saudi Arabia and "all the way to In­called for lowering the shuttle's or­hit to move it into the path of hur­tling oxygen molecules to see how they react with solid surfaces. 
dia."  He  said  the  view  of  the  
northwest  part  of  Australia  was  
"absolutely unbelievable."  
The  astronauts'  schedule  also  

The crane, whose shoulder. el­bow and wrist joints approximate movements ofa human arm, latched onto a '7,460-pound dumbbell in the shuttle's cargo hay and cdutiously 
lifted  it  up  and  away  from  the  
shuttle.  
Mission  specialist  Oale  A.  

Gardner, at the controls in Challen­ger's cabin, guided the off-halam:e weight around and above the huge cargo hay, carefully edging past other instruments there. 
"Challenger has demonstrated it can bench-press... without benefit of steroids," said mission control. 
The astronauts are to land at Ed­wards Air Force Base in California at 
12:2.3 a.m. Pacific time Monday. President Reagan won't be there to greet them, but he is flying to the Kennedy Space Center here -from his home in California -to take part in a Labor Day picnic for space cen­ter employees. 
Gardner, assisted hy mission specialist Guion Bluford, blocked our seven hours Thursday and five hours Friday tor the arm exercise, which was important for the shuttle's role as a workhorse in space.. 
Television showed the aluminum and lead hulk, nearly 20 feet from end to end and 16 feet high, gripped firmly in the "tlst'' of the Cauadian­huilt arm. The weight is con­centrated on one end. 
The four tons lifted Wednesllay doubled the weight the arm has lifted on previous tlights. It showed the mechanical device has the musde to hoist massi\'c satellites anti the beams and girders to build future space stations. 
Although weight is meaningless in space, moving an object takes force sufficient to overcome the inertia of an object's mass. And once the ob­ject is moving, it takes force equal to the inertia, plus the velocity of the movement, to bring it to rest. 
NASA engineers were interested not only in how well the arm per­formed, hut also what effect the lif­ting ofsuch mass would have on the ship. They also want to confirm the amount ofcounterforce they'll need with the ship's thrusters to balance things out. 
Truly deliberately fired the ship's jets to see how the motions affected the arm and its cargo. "We see some movement, some wiggle," said Gardner, "but it's not much." 
The arm test was a rehearsal for later flights when the device is to deploy and retrieve satellites that on Earth weigh up to 65,000 pounds.

Enrollment at Purdue suffers second decline 
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) ­Enrollment at Purdue University's , West Lafayette campus has dropped 
below ~2,000 -the second con­secutive year the school has recorded a decline, the registrar an­nounced Thursdav. 
Last year Purdue recorded ~2,455 students, its tirst enrollment decline since 1957, when enrollment dipped hy 47 students. The most sig­nificant decline was from 11,000 to 9,~00 students in 1951. 
No enrollment t1gures for the regionill campuses are available yet, hut registrar Betty \1. Suddarth sid indications are that enrollment for the entire system will he up. 
"This may retlect the economy in part,". she said, explaining that more students are living at ho.ne and going t{, school. 
Enrollment here t()r the new semester was· ~ l,H56 -a drop of 599 from last year. But, Suddarth said the 19H~·H4 figure still represents Purdue's fourth largest enrollment in historv. 
"It's not as if we fell otf the end of the earth," she said. "We were predicting a drop of ahout 200 stu­dents overlast vear." 
Purdue's highest%enrollment of ~2. 797 occurred •n 19Hl. 
~~ 
Part of the drop was b\· design, Suddarth said. She _explained that several schools and departments have capped enrollments, including engineering, computer science, computer, electrical, a\'iation and mechanical engineering tech­nologies.

Consumers planning summer bar­becues got good news in August. The price of chopped chuck decreased at the checklist store in seven cities and all-beef frankfurters went down in tlve cities. 
Prices for red meat arc expected to decline through the end of this year, then rise sharply next year. The reason for both the decrease and the increase is the same: the heat 
The hot weather has damaged the corn crop in the Midwest. That means higher prices t(>r corn and far­mers, faced with the increased feed costs, are expced to liquidate their herds. That will mean a temporary rise in supplies -and lower meat prices -but it will leave fewer animals for breeding and a long-term drop in the amount of meat. 
The heat already has affected poultry production, killing thousands ofbirds. And the AP found that egg prices went up during August in II of the cities surveyed. 
No attempt was made to weight the AP survey results in terms of what percent of a family's actual grocery outlay each item represents. 
The day of the week on which the check was made varied depending on the month. Standard brands and sizes or comparable subsLitutes were used. 
The items on the AP checklist were: chopped chuck. center cut pork chops. frozen orange juice con­centrate, coffee. paper towels, but­ter. Grade-A medium white eggs, creamy peanut butter, laundrY detergent. fahric softener. tomato sauce. milk. frankfurters and gran­ulated sugar. A 1Sth item, chocolate chip cookies, was dropped from the list when the manufacturer discon­tinued the package size used in the survey. 
The cities checked were: Albu­querque, N. \1., Atlanta. Boston. Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Los t An­geles, Miami, New York, Philadel­phia, Providence, R.I., S T alt Lake City and Seattle. 
U.S. retailers post better · August sales 
(AP)-The nation's major retailers said Thursday their August sales were up strongly from a year ago, as shoppers did their back-to-school 
buying  undaunted  by  the  
widespread heat  wave  and a hur­ 
ricane.  

Sears, Roebuck & co., the world's largest retailer, said it had its seventh consecutive monthly gain, while K­mart Corp., the No. 2 retailer, recorded its largest year-to-year in­crease since January 1982. 
Wall Street analysts said the August continuation of the buying momentum that began with the new year was a good sign for the economic recovery. 
The sales results are "another con­firmation that the consumer recovery is under way and is firmly in place," saidjeffrey Edelman, retail analyst with the investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
jeflrey Feiner, retail analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co., said the August figures "reflect a healthy level of consumer confidence buttressed by continued low levels of intlation and an improvement in general economic conditions." 
Analvsts noted that Sears reported the 1 I th nmsecutive month of sales i t ncreases for major appliances. a categ•~ry ofsp~nding seen as a test of consumer confidence in tht: economv.

Tax credits threaten public schools 
Federal bureaucracy celebrates unhappy birthday 
The tradition of providing an education for those who could not afford to pay t(>r one, dates hack to colonial New England. Even as a struggling new nation. Amt:rica maintained its commitment to educating its people. The Founding Fathers recognized the importance of a competent and intelligent clectoratt· h>r the maintenance of democracy. The role of the Ft:deral Government in this field had grown steadily until ren:nt times.

Friday analysis 

l!nder the Reagan administration, the role of tht: government in the field of education can mildly he stated as "stagnation." The President has ht:en under at­tack from many sides hecause of the cuts in the money earmarked for education, and he­cause ofhis general lack ofa coherent national policy t(,r schools. But, all of the heat put on President Reagan to do more for education has failed to halt new legislation which sets a dangerous precedent, and which may serious­ly hamper puhlicly funded schools. 
A few months ago the U.S. Congress passed a hill whi<:h was designed w give tax credits to tht· parents of children who attend privately funded high schoo~s. President Reagan signed this hill into law, ~aying that it would give parents a greater fn:edom to choose where

they educate their sons and daughters. The puhlic generally voiced approval or indif­ference to this plan. It was viewed as another attempt to get "Big Government" out of our lives. 
But a small group of educators and con­cerned citizens raised strong objections ahout the harm that this law would hring to the puhlic school systems. They pointed out that tuition tax ert:dits at the high school level only gives a freedom of choice to the wealthy. In effect, they actually serve to suhsidize the education of more affluent people at the ex· pense of the taxpayer. 
Tuition tax credits of this type will help to aggravate already serious funding prohlems for puhlic schools. By taking puhlic money and giving it hack to part·nts of private school children, the Federal Government has put a drain on the reservoir of funds which could have hcen used to promote and upgrade public education. 
Another problem soon becomes apparent at the local level. By effectively suhsidizing an alternative education for the more well-to-do, they hecome less likely to support increased hudgets for public school systems. It is highly unlikely that they would choose to pay higher property taxes for a service they are being paid not to use. 
Ifwe hope to maintain quality public educa­tion, and thus an intelligent and responsible citizenry, then laws of this nature, which give preterential treatment to the wealthy, must be stricken. In a world where costs will continue 
should we give our puhlic servants a birthday party? 
When the Civil Service system was es­tablished in I HH3, patronage hiring and firing offederal workers was replaced hy a merit sys­tem. Today, only a small numher of top offi· cials can he hired and fired for political reasons as Administrations change. 
There is certainly plenty of reason to criticize the federal bureaucracy. The job protection extended to federal workers has made it hard to get rid of incompetants. And 
to rise, how can we expect our public schools to provide an adequate service, especially when we make it more difficult for them to raise the funds which arc net:cssary? The puhlic schools are an important cog in the machinery of this nation, they must not be neglected. 
Editor's note: Randy Fahs is a senior govern­ment majorfrom Tonawanda, New York. 

the many layers of the bureaucracy compl· icate the most routine business. But, too often, our perception of the Civil Service seems to stem not from objective examination of its good and bad points, but from a stereotype reinforced by horro'r stories of government bungling and red tape. The unfair attacks come from political candidates, most recently Presidents Carter and Reagan, from businesses complaining about government overregulation, and from ordinary citizens who may know little about how the federal 
bureaucracy works. 

The government is a convenient, faceless scapegoat for our frustration over crime, infla­tion, the threat of war, and unemployment. We want government to solve most of our 
problems,  and the bureau<.~racy  cannot live  
up to those  ·expectations.  
But  a  careful  examination  of  the  

bureaucracy shows it is neither a fat, greedy monster nor a sleepy tree sloth. In the past thirty years, the federal budget grew by 800 percent. The size of the federal workforce, by contrast, grew only 9.7 percent. For the departments of the bureaucracy where measurement is possible, productivity is reported to have risen by 1.4 percent a year­a rate that would make many private com· panics jealous. And while some say federal workers are overpaid, the President's Ad· visory Committee on Federal Advisory Com­
mittee on Federal Pay found that government employees make 13.9 percent less than they would make in comparable jobs in the private sector. 
One of the most common criticisms of the civil service is that creative and hardworking people stay away. If this is true, broadsides against the bureaucracy are ore reason. As long as the public thinks bureaucrats are inef­fective paper-pushers, what talented person 
would want to become one? There are many problems in the federal bureaucracy that need our attention and should be the topic of public criticism, but blanket attacks that ignore the facts do more harm than good.

Showcase 
September song 
by Rev. Robert Griffin 
letters to a lonely god 
P
art o~ every September song is the pain from losing spectal people who have left the campus. The tem­porary absence that bothers me the most is that ofSister jean Lenz, ofFarley Hall, who is working for the year in Notre Dame's London program. For me, the presence of her absence fills the whole North Quad as well as a few places on South Quad, like the pay cafeteria. I hope it will not embarrass SisterJean ifl publish the news that she is one ofthe necessary people on whom I am very dependent. The campus has a small gallery ofus old toads: hobgoblin bachelors caught at an awkward age halfway between mid-life ambition and premature senility. We're halfdragon, halfpussy cat. and we live in caves which our ideosyncrasies have made for us. A few timorous folk are afraid ofus; most everyone else is in­different. Once in a while, a folk heroine like Sister Jean comes along, and sizes us up shrewdly. Then, because she is compassionate, she says: "You should get out of the cave." 
You ignore her as though she were a Rhine maiden, wishing whe would go away. She persists in trying to tame the beast, who was never really wild, but only shy. Eventually, because you find she really cares how lone­ly you've made yourself, you let yourself be coaxed out ofthe shadows. Finally, you find yourselfin the Rector's room at Farley, eat ting cookies and drinking hot choc­olate; pranling, and being prattled to, as though you had just made your social debut. 
For years,jean Lenz has helped me sort out decisions. Many Domers lean on her; any one ofus, dropping by early or late, gets warmly welcomed, and invited to en­joy a glass ofwine. Often, I have felt the wariness behind the welcome, becauseJean has been cheering up stu­dents and adults from after supper until after midnight. Sometimes, I was weary myself, or inarticulate with my frustration, with few words to offer her from the vast confusion in my mind. She would try to help, without embarrassing me by saying that she knew I needed help. I would thaw out a little from being in the company of this gentle nun. Finally, afraid ofwearing out her ability to communicate strength, I would leave to walk with my dog to the Grotto, continuing alone in a communion with the night. The venerable Bede writes ofthe spar­row, caught by night in a winter storm, coming into the warm hall where the king feasts with his court. After a while near the fire, the sparrow flies outside again, trying to survive the wind and ice. In the sparrow, says Bede, we have an image ofthe life ofman, surrounded 
after death and before birth by darkness. I could under­
stand how the sparrow felt on a few ofthe evenings I 
visited Jean. 
For many years, I lived in Keenan until finally, it wa~ 
clear that I had worn out my welcome with the Rector 
who was there then. By this time, Jean had been telling 
me for a long time: "Griffin, you should get out of this 
hall." I didn't want to leave Keenan with its million 
memories that made it seem like home. 
"It's too small for you," she argued. "It's too narrow 
and shabby." Waving her hands at the keepsakes 
mounted on the walls -from watchingjean, you can 
tell the ministry that hands can have -she said, " I can 
see all of your things, taken down and put up in a new 
place. Ifyou let us, some of us can at least rearrange 
them, after the walls are painted." 
Two years ago, Fr. Schlaver asked ifI would like to move into PW as chaplain. If it hadn't been forJean Lenz, I might have said no. Jean walked me over to see the place at I a.m., the two ofus approaching PW like Nicodemus approachingjesus by night, and getting baptized by the sprinklers as we tried to peek through the windows. She fired up my reluctance untill finally felt that ifl could not get permission to live in PW, I would spend the rest ofthe year in mourning. The move was one ofthe healthiest decisions I have made in years, and I have the clear memory of being led to it by jean. 
As a house-warming gift, she gave me an electric pot for makng hot chocolate of my own. I have rarely warmed that pot unless I was offering refreshment to a little prayer group that includedjean. This year, while Jean is away, I will warm it often, on occasions that will always include a celebration of my friendship withJean. Every week, I will hold a Sister jean Lenz memorial hot chocolate hour, with tea also served as a bow toward England. Whether with PW women, undergraduates, staff people, my community members, or friends in town for the game, I shall offer hospitality that will in­clude aJean Lenz story, so that her legend and fame will always be fresh. Something ofher will be active among us, until she comes back to be home here again. 
SisterJean Lenz has gone to London to see the Queen. Dick Whittington went to London to see the Queen; even Dick Whittington's cat got to see the Queen. More importantly forJean, I suspect, her hands are busy among the teacups and glasses, serving wisdom with English biscuits. At Notre Dame, one ofthe dragons she domesticated misses her very much. At night, I always looked at her windows, to see if the lights were on. Now, for the time being, I try to forget there are win­dows.. Whoever lives in that room surely doesn't keep ash trays in the corner intended to be mainly used by me?

t's that happy time ofyear again -time to start turning the cranks on rusty brains, time to break the bank accounts on mile-long lines at the bookstore, and time to figure out how to fit 650 cubic feet of clothes, furniture and loft materials into a 700 cubic foot room. But don't despair-and whatever you do, don't let the mounds ofhand­outs, used books, and homework swamp you -not yet! This weekend the Student Union and other organizations have planned enough events to keep you occupied nearly every minute through to Monday. So, besides (perhaps instead of) hitting some ofthe private parties that will be going on everywhere, be sure to check out some of these: 
•THEATRE 
Sorry, no shows yet, but in preparation for some fantastic ones later you can audition for the classic, "Fiddler on the Roof." Try-outs start at 7 p.m. tonight in the LaFortune ballroom. The play, produced by the Student Players, will open sometime this fall. So get out there and display your talent! 
•MUSIC 
You may have to employ a little imagination at this weekend event -it's the Welcome Week air band competition! For the unen­lightened, an air band is a band without instruments and without vo­cals. Nevertheless, there is music. To organize your own air band simply play prerecorded music from your favorite group and play your "instruments" in the air. Anyone can enter the competition. Come to perform or spectate on Saturday from 12 to 4 p.m. in front of Father Sorin's statue. 
Ifyou appreciate real music, try out for the Notre Dame jazz Band. Auditions will be held Sunday at 1 p.m. in the jazz loft. 
And if you're going campus stir crazy already, you c Supply at the Holiday Star Theatre in Merrillville on Sunday at 8 p.m. Tickets are S13.95. 
•DANCE 
Two great traditions are being combined Saturday night, with the Chance to Dance at the Polish Wedding. Besi_des the popular Chance to Dance, featuring Night Flight band, there will be Polish food sold, polka as well as contemporary music, performances by air band finalists, and a lot offun. It's at Stepan Center, from 9:30 to 1. Admis­sion is free. 
•ART 
At the Snite, modern drawings from the permanent collection will be displayed, starting this weekend, in the O'Shaughnessy galleries, until October 9. Also in the O'Shaughnessy galleries, the annual Faculty exhibition will color the walls until October 22. 
•MOVIES 
There are movies galore to entertain you this weekend, starting with "The Woman Next Door," a French film, at 7:30 tonight in the Annenburg Auditorium, for 12. 
Next, there are cartoons at 10:30 tonight in Stepan Center, followed by "Blazing Saddles," a hilarious Mel Brooks spoofofWes­tern movies, at 11 p.m. Admission ro these movies is s1. 
On Saturday, at 7 p.m. the Chinese Association is sponsoring "the Switch" in the Library Auditorium. 
The popular "An Officer and a Gentleman" is showing in the Engineering Auditorium at 7, 9:15, and 11 p.m. for S 1. The Student Union is sponsoring this Richard Gere flick. 
•MISCELLANEOUS 
Don't pack away your swimsuits yet, because the Student Union is planning a day at the Dunes (Lake Michigan) on Sunday. Pick up your free tickets in advance at the record store in LaFortune. Buses leave at 10 a.m. 
To usher in the new year, each ofthe upper classes is holding a Mass at the Grotto on Sunday: Sophomores at 4:30p.m.,Juniors at 8:30p.m. and Seniors at 10 p.m. 
Ofprime importance for those with friends and relatives who want ro see the Fighting Irish in action, is the Purdue game ticket lot­tery. Enter today from 1 to 5 p.m. at the Irish Gardens in Lafortune. Winners will be announced on Monday. 
The senior class is putting on a picnic to start off their last year here at the Dome. Eat all you want on Saturday from 3 to 7 p.m. at Green Field

The picnic will be held at Stepan Field, and after food, from 4 to 6 p.m., there will be field games with prizes. Par 3, a student band, will supply the tunes.

For Lloyd, victory was super sweet. Although he won the mixed douhles titles at the french Open in 1982 and at Wimhledon earlier this year, his ranking in singles has plunged in the last four years.

"You see the teams that win every 

year and they've got a good mix of 
young players with players in their 
fourth, fifth or six years and a couple 
of older veterans," said second-year 
Bears Coach Mike Ditka, whose final 
cut included eight veterans, t1ve of 
them former starters. 
"You have to gradually bring 

players in, teach them, work with · 
them, and hope they're ready to play 
when the opportunity comes," Ditka 
said. 
Ditka's gamble looks respectable 

coming off a 3-6 mark in the strike­
shortened 1982 season. Several of 
the rookies, wide receiver Willie 
Gault and offensive tackle jim 
Covert, are the kind of high-priced 
talent who should pay dividends im­
mediately.

Gann about the fear of being reinjured. "But once things got rol­ling I felt fine and regained con­fidence." 
Like \1arshall. Gann has also been 
mentioned hy some puhlications as 
a pre-season All-American. Like :\tar­
shall, he too shrugs off such lists 
without a care. 

"I think what made our line suc­
cessful last year was that there were 
really no great stars playing there," 
says Gann. "We are all given our 
roles and are asked to play within 
the team concept." 

"The structure of our defense 
doesn't lend itselfto tlashy lineman." 
says Robertson in agreement. "It 
retards individualism." 

Blache may he especially pleased that his players don't concern them­selves with All-American hvpe. 
"When you start to believe in that 
stuff, that's when you usually go out 
on the field and get your butt 
handed to you." 

Dorsey proved that last year 
when. as a freshman. he had a field 
day against all-America and first­
round draft choice Don 'vlosehar of 
l'SC. After splitting time with Autry 
at nose tackle f(:>r the most part of 
last year, Dorsey was switched over 
to flip tackle in place of the injured 
Gann for the season-ending game 
against the Trojans. 

The 6-5, 269-lb. Dorsey went on 
to record eight tackles -most by a 
lineman -while stunning the an­
nouncers and viewers with the way 
he was getting the best of Mosebar. 
"That Southern Cal game was 
beautiful," recalls Dorsey who can 
clean-and-jerk 325 pounds. "I 
remember that I hated switching to 
the position at the time since there 
were only four days to learn the sys­
tem and so much work involved in 
learning it. It was all worth it, 
though, and now I just love lt." 

The flip tackle lines up at various places in the interior line and is usually involved in most of the sack plays. Dorsey earned the starting position with a very strong spring performance while Gann was recuperating from knee surgery. An abdominal pull has heen nagging Dorsey this fall, though. He watched from the sidelines last Saturday as Gann partook in four tackles behind the line of scrimmage for over 30 yards in losses while playing flip tackle. 
The contain tackle position was 
left vacant in the spring because of 
the graduation of two-year starter 
Bob Clasby. The position involves 
lining up outside of the offensive 
tackle and being responsible for 
outside containment on that side. 

Dingens. a pre-med, emerged from the spring drills as the starter at contain tackle. Like his classmate Dorsey, the 6-5 2';'7-lh. Dingens has what Blache calls a great ability to "make things happen." 
"With Eric, strength is the big as­set," says Blache, "while with Greg it's quickness." 
In terms of field savvy, agility, and finesse, Dingens has already been compared to last year's starter at end, Kevin Griffith. 
A leader like Griffith or Clasby is one of the main things that might he missing on the unit this year, however. 
"As far as our strengths on the unit go, we have good quickness and toughness up front this year," says Blache. "Our weakness is ex­perience. They're young hut hard working." 
Others working in the interior of the defensive line include senior Steve Keane, juniors Mike Kiernan, Rock Roggeman, and Jay l'nder­wood, and freshmen Mike Griffin, Art McGlothen. and Byron Spruell. 
The freshman Griffin has greatly impressed his coaches as he has worked extc-nsivelv with the-second units in practice. 
But with this defensive intcrior unit. who knows what "first unit" or "second unit" means? 
continuedfrom page 20 
formance in last Saturday's scrimmage. "He really began to pick things up and show signs of the Tim :\larshall of old." 
:\hrshall, like Autry last year, ad­mits a little discomfort at the nose tackle spot where he lines up nose­to-nose with the center and usually has to take on two hlockers. for now, he concedes that Autry's ex­perience is an edge in their hattie. 
The versatile Gann is capahk of playing either the flip tackle or con­tain tackle position. Gann comes otf a tremendous sophomore campaign in which he was a main cog at flip tackle for the "Gold Rush" which ranked eighth in the nation against the run (giving up only 95 ; yards a game). 

A knee injury in the ninth game against Penn State sidelined him for the rest of the season as well as last spring. The rehabilitation program has made him all the more stronger, but knee surgery for a foot hall player has its drawhacks. 
"Physically, :\like is 100/," says Blache. "hut mentally he may need a hall game or two for full con­tldence." 
Gann, meanwhile, feels that he is fully prepared both physically and mentally. 
"I was a little nervous starting contact drills again this fall," admits
