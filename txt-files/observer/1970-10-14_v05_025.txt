one of the requirements for an 
honorary degree is the presence 
of the recipient at commence­
ment. 

Professor Broderick expressed an optimistic attitude on the initiation of this new policy. "To my knowledge this is the first time that the students have been able to select recipients for honorary degrees on any campus in the country. I feel that it is another instance of recognition of the responsibility of the students to select representatives of their ideas and interests." When questioned on the type of representative he felt should be selected by the students , Pro­fessor Broderick commented, "the whole purpose of this program is to give students the voice and the choice; the less the facufty has to say the better."

One aid to the area drug problem has already been estab­lished by a Notre Dame student. 
John Kwicien has formed a drug hotline in South Bend that operates on the same principle as the suicide hotline. Qualified personnel are on hand to aid any user in serious trouble. At present time, Notre Dame does not have the equipment or trained personnel for such an operation of its own.

BALTIMORE (UPI) -The charging Baltimore Orioles par­layed another sensational game by Brooks Robinson and Dave McNally's grand slam homer-the first by a pitcher in World Series competition-into a 9-3 rout Tuesday over the dazed Cin­cinnati Reds ·and a 3-0 lead in the series. 
The Orioles, who've now reeled off 17 consecutive vi·c­tories since their last loss on Sept. 19, can close out their second four game series sweep in the last five years with a victory on Wednesday. 
Baltimore's first two victories were close but this time the Reds never were in the game. The 5 I, 77 3 Oriole partisans-a crowd slightly short of capacity-roared at the play of Brooks Robinson, McNally, Frank Robinson, who snapped out of an 0-9 slump with three hits including a homer, Paul Blair, who had three hits, and Don Bufford, who hit a solo homer. 
But the standing ovations were saved for Brooks and McNally. 
After each game in which Brooks made a standout play, mrnager Earl Weaver always says, "Watch tomorrow and hell make another one" -· and sure enough, he does. 
Brooks made one sensational play with a dive to his right on Johnny Bench's l·iner in the sixth, added several merely superb ones in the first four innings and had two doubles ­driving in the Orioles :first two working with eight days off ­runs off Tony Cloninger in the didn't have his best stuff and first inning. was touched for nine hits while

Harriers seventh 
Four strong individual perfor­
mances enabled Bowling Green to capture first place in the 15th annual Notre Dame Invitational Cross Country meet Friday afternoon, October 9. Bowling Green's domination of the meet was reflected by the fact that they had runners finis.h fourth, fifth, seventh, and eighth in the meet. Notre Dame was among 28 other schools who were . unable to match the balance of Bowling Green, as the Irish 
finished seventh. 
Western Michigan, a pre-meet 
co-favorite with Bowling Green, 
finished a distant second. How­
ever, W. Michigan sported the 
individual champion of the meet 
as their man Harris covered the 
five-mile trek in the time of 23 
minutes, 59 seconds. This year's 
winning time was a full ten 
seconds off the NDICC record of 
23:49, set by Jerry Liendenberg 
of W. Michigan last year. Bob 
Bertelsen, Ohio; Sid Sink, 
Bowling Green; and Dave 
Wattle, Bowling Green; posted 
times of 24:09, 24: 18, and 
24: 19. respectively. 
Other teams finishing ahead 
of Notre Dame included Eastern 
Michigan, Illinois, Pittsburgh, 
and Ohio. The Irish were solidly entrenched in seventh place, 34 points in front of Illinois State. · Notre Dame did attain consis­tency, placing a quartet of runners in between the twenty­eighth and forty-second posi­tions. These were: Holleran, 28th, 25:22. Desch, 34th, 25:27, Bell, 41st, 25:32, Dunne, 42nd, 25:33. 

New book says Viet war 
opposed for selfish 
Americans generally oppose the war in Vietnam for selfish rather than moral reasons. 
So write the authors of 
Vietnam  and  the  Silent  
Majority:  The  Dove's  Guide,  
recently  published  by  Harper  
and Row. They are:  
Milton  J. Rosenberg,  Profes­ 

sor of Social Psychology at the University of Chicago; 
Sidney Verba, Professor of Political Science at the Univer­sity of Chicago, and 
Philip E. Converse, Professor of Political Scit;nce and Sodo­logy at the University of Michigan. 
The authors say that people oppose the war because it is intruding into their lives and hurting them in ways that are very close to home. They char­acterize this sentiment as fol­lows: "I wish the damned war would just disappear. It is really messing up our lives and messing up this cDun try." 
One major reason for opposi­lion to the war is probably based on an economic pinch. It could be said, the authors wrote, that the opposition to tht~ war among the general American public is closely related to the dtcline of the economy or the rise in the cost of living. 
An early study of attitudes toward the war revealed that many more Americans were willing to accept several hundred American casualties each week as a price of continuing the war than were willing to accept a rise ln taxes, the authors say. 

When the Gallup poll asked in 1967 about a "suggestion" that "income taxes be raised to help pay for the war in Vietnam," 70 per cent of those' answering were opposed. 
The authors contrast this to the public's general reaction to reports of the My Lai massacre. According to a Harris poll in 1 anuary, 197o, ror example, the reaction can perhaps be best described as bland, the authors

reasons 

feel. 
This does not mean that there is no opposition to the seeming­ly never-ending destruction in 
Indo-China  within  the  general  
American outlook,  the  authors  
say.  

Another source of opposition to the war, fhe three say, may oe the growing feeling among Americans that the war is affecting the "quality of life" in America. They report that in the mind of the typical American, student riots, violence at home, and the growth of a counter­culture all tend to be seen as part of a general deterioration of American life. 
Motivations are varied for opposing the war and wanting its swift end. Perhaps most Amen-cans derive their feelings from the way in which the war has intruded upon their lives 
