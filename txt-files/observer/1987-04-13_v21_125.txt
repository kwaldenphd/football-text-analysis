Shultz meets advisers, hopes for arms treaty with USSR 
Associated Press 
HELSINKI, Finland-Secre­tary of State George Shultz met with a dozen U.S. arms control advisers Sunday to ready his response to new Soviet over­tures that might bring the Reagan administration closer to its first arms control agree­ment. 
Limited by President Reagan in other nuclear areas, Shultz hopes to clear a major obstacle to a treaty to rid Europe of medium-range mis­siles in talks opening today in Moscow. 
The barrier is the presence in East Germany, Czechos­lovakia and the Soviet Union of 130 shorter-range rockets that the United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies want the right to match. 

In two speeches, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev of­fered to negotiate a solution while the two sides complete an agreement to eliminate their other medium-range missiles from Europe. 
"I think it's some degree of movement, it's somewhat dif­ferent," said a senior U.S. offi­cial, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "But we certainly haven't achieved closure. There is a lot of work to be done." 
Shultz is unlikely to give the Soviets a final answer when he sees Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, beginning today and General Secretary Gorbachev, probably on Tues­day. 
"We propose to seriously dis­cuss this, try to work out an agreement," the official said. 
But he stressed the Soviet edge in the 350 to 600-mile range missiles was a serious issue to the West European allies and they must be con­sulted on the kind of cuts the United States would demand. 
"Mter all, this a matter of great importance to our allies," the official said. 
Of all the nuclear arms con­trol issues under negotiations, an agreement to rid Europe of hundreds of missiles in the 600 to 3,000-mile range is the closest to completion. 
It would be the first treaty to put a dent in the superpowers' 
nuclear weapons buildups in 
the more than six years 
Reagan has been president. 
In lengthy negotiations, the two sides decided basically to dismantle all but 100 warheads each. But the Reagan adminis­tration first wants the right to match the 130 shorter-range So­
viet rockets. 
The West Germans have 71 comparable missiles. The United States has none in Europe, but would like to con­vert some of the 108 Pershing 2 missiles now in West Ger­many to a shorter range weapon. 
The senior official said if the Soviets recognize a U.S. right to match their total equal ceilings could be set below 130. But, he said, "it was not cer­tain, by any means" that the allies would accept a total ban. 
Shultz' talks in Moscow are bound to be clouded by U.S. al­legations that the Soviets, with the collusion of some American Marine guards, infiltrated the 
U.S. Embassy with eavesdrop­ping devices. 
Shultz said Saturday he would confront the Soviets about "the severe hostile envi­ronment they set up." He said he and Reagan were "very up­set about what has happened." 
But Shultz has also vowed to pursue agreements with the Soviets on Euromissiles and on a troop withdrawal in M­ghanistan.

What are we supposed to do? Administration should tell us 
It was another lost weekend. 
Yes, I, like many Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students, managed to do nothing so­cially constructive this weekend. Did some An Tostal work, wrote a paper, went to the movies to see Top Gun. That's about it. 
This seems to be quite common here. Ask ten people what they did over the weekend, and three will say "nothing much." Six will mention academics. One, maybe two, will mention dates. "Was it a good weekend?" 
"It was fun." 
"The usual." 
"It was all right." 
"Pretty blah." 

Afew columns back I waved flags and ranted and raved about guys on this campus not asking girls out, why they didn't, and why they should. But I have come to the stark realization that there is not all that much for a couple on a date to do on this campus. 
Yes, there are SYRs and formals. The latest rumor on campus is that the administration has taken a dislike to these forms of social activity. Something about an "unhealthy atmosphere." (As if ethanol weren't enough.) Whether the rumors are true or not, and I must say I find them hard to believe, hall dances are only twice a semester. That's if you can get a date. 
What else is there? Parties have been pretty much outlawed. The South Bend bar scene is not much to see, and if you're not twenty-one it's not worth the risk anyway. 
The library is becoming an increasingly popular spot on weekends. This is social life? Staring at some member of the opposite sex over a biology book? 
Many students sit around their dorm rooms on weekends. Wow. Miami Vice again. Maybe if you're lucky, there'll be a good movie on network television. Yeah, right. 
Speaking of movies, there's the infamous En­gineering Auditorium movie scene. But that gets old fast. 
I have been accused of picking on our school a bit much in these columns. But there is a point to all this. Really. 
The powers-that-be seem to think that the con­sumption of alcohol is not meaningful social interaction. They seem to think that the gather­ing of many students in a dorm room is not meaningful social interaction. They seem to think that dating is not meaningful social inter­action, if the rumors are true. They definitely think that sex or anything close to it is not meaningful social interaction. So what is so­cially acceptable and meaningful? Books? Movies? 
Well, we're college students. At most other schools around the country, and certainly in the media, drinking and parties and dates and yes, even sex are portrayed as the things college students do. 
Don't get me wrong. I am not saying that we should do all these things. But that is what our

culture tells us is normal. The administrations at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's have chosen to outlaw these activities. If they want to do that, that's their prerogative. 
But what are we supposed to do? 
I have no clue. 
So Father Ted, Father Malloy, Father Tyson, listen up. Goldrick, Cassidy, Lanan, please lis­ten. We don't know what you expect. We know what you don't want us to do, but that doesn't tell us what you do want done. Do you really expect us to sit in the library on Friday nights? Is that normal? Is that healthy? 
What is acceptable social activity around here? 
It seems that many of the ways that normal college students get together have been taken away here. We realize that we're not supposed to be normal college students. We're supposed to be mature, Catholic, brilliant workaholics. But we're not. We're not 45, we're 20. 
And we're confused. 
So administrators, please let us know what you expect. Spell it out. Put it in print. Write a column in The Observer or Scholastic. Write a letter to us. Treat us like the socially stunted college students we are. 
Please.

NEW YORK -Almost three out of four Americans support a judge's decision in the Baby M case to turn the child of a surrogate mother over to her father, according to a poll pub­lished Sunday. 
The New York Times-CBS News Poll reported that 74 per­cent of the 1,045 adults inter­viewed by telephone from April 5 through April 8 said the baby should go to the biological fa­ther, William Stern, whose sperm was used.

DOVER, Del. -A fire in a Wesley College dormitory was started early Sunday by a smoke bomb, which apparently was set off as a prank, and an 18-year-old student died when he was trapped in his room by smoke, police said.

Whitehead signed a sur­rogate contract with Stern and his wife Elizabeth, but changed her mind after giving birth. 
A new Jersey judge stripped Whitehead of parental rights and ruled that Stern should have custody, and Mrs. Stern was allowed to adopt the baby, who the Sterns named Melissa. 
Sixty-nine percent of those polled said surrogate mothers should have to abide by agree­ments they had signed. 
in Williams Hall at the down­town Dover campus, according to police. 
The smoke bomb was set off on the second floor of the dorm, according to the police report. The device started a small fire, and firefighters evacuated the smoke-filled buiding. 
One room had heavy damage, and the rest of the building was heavily damaged by smoke, police said. It was not known how many people were inside the building.

P.O.BoxQ 
Graduate School was judged inadequately 
Dear Editor: 
The March 31 guest column by Chris­topher Ryan raised some interesting points, but at the same time made some fallacious inferential leaps which war­rant comment. Mr. Ryan, citing 1984 ratings of Economics faculties, stated that in terms of the number of publica­tions, Notre Dame's Economics Depar­tment ranked 12lst. Based on these rankings, he then went on to discuss the poor performance of the graduate faculty as as whole. 
But does the ranking of one depart­ment reflect on graduate studies as a whole? The answer should be a defin­tive "no." Moreover, publications are not the only mark of quality faculty. If this were the only criterion of quality, graduate students would indeed suffer. 
Finally, while I do not profess to be an expert in economics and, in fact know little about the Department of Economics at Notre Dame, I am cog­nizant of the fact that in most disci­plines it is extremely difficult to be published in the top journals. 
As a final note, Father Malloy has expressed an interest in improving graduate studies at the University of Notre Dame. Perhaps Mr. Ryan should withdraw his indictment of the graduate faculty until Father Malloy 
has  an  opportunity  to  actualize  his  
plans.

Men make up for less aid in earning power 
Dear Editor: 
In response to Chris Julka's March 25 editorial concerning discrimination against women and the loss of his fin­ancial aid, I would like to inform him that women earn less than 50 cents for every dollar that men make. Whether Mr. Julka likes it or not, his vastly higher earning power does not entitle him to be as financially needy, because higher-paying jobs are available to him even now for the reason that he is male. It's terrible being so advantaged, isn't it? 
Mr. Julka has not been "robbed" of

anything. Rather, his sisters have not been forced to make a contribution to their education that would have been much more difficult for them to earn because of wage discrimination. I would also like to suggest to Mr. Julka that in the future, he try to demonstrate the abilities of a Notre Dame scholar by researching his material before writing another such poorly-informed, reactionary, and self-pitying article.

Evaluation of faculty should be qualitative 
Dear Editor: 
I was appalled to read Christopher Ryan's March 31 column concerning the quality of Notre Dame's graduate program and the quality of the Notre Dame faculty in relation to its pay scale. Although I agree with the con­tention that the graduate program re­quires a great deal of improvement if it wishes to compete with the more renowned universities, I found his arti­cle outrageous and insulting. Further­more, Ryan's proposed solution of com­pensating production rather than seniority would not only be of very lim­ited effect in improving the graduate program, but would also destroy the excellence of the undergraduate pro­gram which he so clearly illustrated with a barrage of statistics. His demand for printed matter as the pri­mary criterion for professional com­petence is indicative of an increasing prevalent bias both inside and outside of academia which avidly ascribes to this quantitative method of evaluation rather than a qualitative one because of its reassuringly tangible nature. 
I profoundly resent his use of my status as a Rhodes Scholar to prove the excellence of Notre Dame as an insti­tution while discrediting the very people who are responsible for my achievement. His implication is that Notre Dame undergraduates succeed despite a faculty which is not "worthy of its alumni, worthy of its undergradu­ates, worthy of its pay." How exactly does Ryan imagine that the two of us managed to become Rhodes Scholars? Certainly not because we were able to pick up various journals and publica­tions and discover the "new ideas" written by the prolific faculty of the more illustrious institutions. Had my professors been even more pressured to publish than they presently are, they could never have offered me the generous amounts of time, attention and support which I received from them. During my four years at Notre Dame, I incurred profound intellectual and emotional debts to the faculty which Ryan finds overpaid and mediocre. 

Why, in his statistics and publishing output, does Ryan focus only on the rating of the economics faculty rather than that of a more recognized depar­tment? The philosophy faculty, for ex­ample, has achieved a world wide reputation. The attitude of certain administrators, represented by Gor­don's remark, "We are not in the top ten and we never will be but that's not our goal," is unfortunate and a major hindrance to the development of com­petitive graduate research programs. This statement was made, however, in 1983 and Ryan's use of it contradicts the opening of his article in which he states that the administration's key ob­jective, as mandated by the alumni and trustees is to "administer a graduate program of scholarship and research the equal of (an) already excellent un­dergraduate program." 
The solution is not simply to channel the faculty's energy away from teach­ing and from the students and to redirect it into research. Notre Dame must convert scholars of wide repute if it wishes to be taken seriously as a graduate institution. A pay scale based on productions rather than seniority may inititally attract them, but would not necessarily induce them to stay, nor would it encourage them to devote their energy to their students. A factor which deters both professors and students from coming to Notre Dame is a widespread suspicion that the Catholic environment inhibits freedom of intel­lectual and artistic impression. The recent controversy of Curran at Cath­olic University and the Student Activi­ties Board's heavy-handed censoring of the Juggler and Scholastic do little to discredit this belief. 
The administration must reexamine its priorities not only in terms of the graduate program's faculty, but also in terms of its students. Intellectually ag­gressive and dedicated students are es­sential in order to challenge and stim­ulate the faculty. The professors must consider their students worthy invest­ments of time and energy for both par­ties to benefit. 
If, however, Ryan's shortsighted so­lution does win favor among the powers that be and production is instituted as the deciding factor of intellectual abil­ity and vigor in the Malloy era, let us hope that the administration will not lose sight of the goal of educating and will make the appropriate gestures. These will include increasing the budget of Notre Dame University Press in order to boost its own productivity and not discriminating against the publications of its faculty members which are issued by the less renowned, but equally respectable presses in an age of surfeit in the publishing world.

strengthens family ties 
Christine Gregory Assistant Accent Editor 
The idea was born last Thanks­
giving. After numerous written 
proposals, revisions and votes, 
there was approval in early 
March. The sophomore class had 
only a few weeks to make their 
idea a reality. They needed to 
send out letters, reserve rooms, 
order food,and obtain speakers 
because they were sponsoring 
"Little Sibs Weekend.'' 
On Friday afternoon, about 45 little brothers and sisters, ran­ging in age from 12-15, arrived on campus to spend a weekend with their sophomore siblings. This was the first time since 198.3 that such an event had occured at Notre Dame. That year, there were no set registration policies, the scheduled events were few in number, and the amount of people who showed up doubled the expected amount--that is, al­most 1500 instead of 700. The most significant aspect of Notre Dame life seen by the young visitors was the social life--and this was before the alcohol policy went into effect. Needless to say, the administration was not eager to see the event repeated. 
Until this year. The Sophomore 
Advisory Council worked hard to 
develop a proposal that would 
change the minds of those in the 
Student Affairs office. Dan Ripper 
was named chairman of the 
weekend. He, along with sopho­
more class officials and council 
members, took their first at­
tempt at a proposal to the rectors 
to get some initial feedback. 
The apprehensions revolved around the fact that the little sibs might be too young to be on a college campus. Rectors were also anxious about the fact that the fiasco of '8.3 could be repeated if certain precautions were not taken. In fact, they even questioned the need to have a Little Sibs Weekend at all. 
But the SAC persevered. Rip­per pointed out that the family spirit, indigeneous to Notre Dame, could be manifested per­fectly in such a weekend. Mem­bers of the SAC rewrote the pro­posal, using rectors' comments, input from the sophomore class, and research on past Little Sibs Weekends. Both the Student Senate and the Campus Life Council passed it unanimously. It was ready for the Office of Stu­dent Affairs. After 45 minutes of review, the proposal was passed. Sophomore Liitle Sibs Weekend was ready to go. 
Although adequate publicity was difficult because of the late approval date, 45 or 50 sop­homores signed up the week after spring break. This was fine with the SAC, who considered it "a comfortable number given the short lead time there was to or­ganize the weekend." Other com­plications included the fact that the Jazz Festival was this weekend and several dorms held SYR's--something no little sib was permitted to attend. 
There were enough activities planned, however, that no one thought twice about missing a dance. Friday night, "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" was shown at the Library Auditorium. Saturday's events lasted from morning until night. 
It's really special 
'' 

to do something 
with your little 
sibling without 
your parents 
around.'' 
-------------­Little sibs had the opportunity to meet some Notre Dame athletes 
and cheerleaders. Then it was on to Theodore's for a box lunch and performance by the Notre Dame chorale. The afternoon featured Fun and Games at the ACC including dodgeball, water balloon toss,and volleyball. 
After a couple free hours, during which sophomores took their sibs to Bookstore Basket­bali games, the Jazz Festival, the bookstore, or just back to the dorm for a relaxing visit, the group met at the South Dining Hall for a semi-formal dinner. In the evening. the featured event was Casino Night (also in the Dining Hall). Participants were supplied with play money and given the opportunity to try their luck at blackjack, craps, and poker. The winning team of sophomore and sib each received a $20 gift certificate for the bookstore. Four runner-up teams received $10 certificates. Throughout the night, the crowd was entertained by the music of Vatican Ill. 
Sunday morning dawned (rainy ofcourse),so the mass that had been scheduled at the Grotto was instead held in Lewis Hall's chapel. Father Lardner of Grace was the celebrant. The last event of the weekend was a brunch in North Dining Hall. 
Only one of the events was mandatory. That was Friday night's movie, because the gat­hering functioned, as a welcom­ing and orientation. The only other rule that had to be followed was that under no circumstances could the little sibs be at events which included alcohol. Besides this, there was a check-in time at midnight Friday and 12:.30 Sat­urday. "This is not meant to be a 'bed-check'," clarified Ripper. "We just want to insure that everyone is safe at the end of the evening." 
All in all, the weekend can be considered a success, at least in the eyes of the participants. "It's really special to do something with your little sibling without your parents around," said one sophomore. "It teaches you re­sponsibility because you have to look out for them but it also makes you closer.'' Added a member of the SAC, "It's a good excuse to invite your sib up for the weekend. There are things to do with them and you know other people are going to have their little sibs around, too." 
A sibling relationship is not the only thing enhanced during the weekend. "This is good for the class," asserted Ripper. "Juniors have JPW, seniors have Com­mencement,and freshmen are still getting settled. There are no big events for the sophomore class to really get involved ln. This strikes me as a perfect one for increasing class unity." 
Does this mean that Sopho­more Little Sibs Weekend will again become an annual event, as it is on many other college campuses? No one can say for sure yet. Ripper will seek com­ments and suggestions from all those who were involved, so as to compile a report for next year's sophomore class presi­dent. That way, if the Class of 1990 is Interested, they will have something to start with, which may make It easier to get the weekend approved. The late date this year made participation, or­ganization, and funding chal­lenging. Ifthe event is made def­inite early in the year, much of the planning and preliminary ef­forts will be easier. 
For Ripper, the chaotic pace of the last three weeks paid off. He gives a lot of credit to the SAC, saying that there is no way one person could have handled the whole event. He felt the weekend was well received by rectors, little sibs, sophomores,and parents. "It's really great to see people enjoying themselves as a result of your efforts," he said. And it seems that everyone did.

Irish blow away EMU in impressive outing 
By GEORGE TRAVERS Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's ten­nis team took to the Courtney Courts yesterday and came away with an impressive win over Eastern Michigan. 
The Irish soundly defeated their opponents in singles, 5-1, and doubles, 2-1, on their way to the win. The win raised the Irish record to 16-10. 
Both teams had to deal with a fiercely overpowering wind, something not uncommon at Notre Dame. In general this hindered the Eastern Michigan team, which relies on a precise serve-and-volley game. 
The featured match, pitting the top players of both schools, turned out to be the only singles loss for the Irish. Matt Khuman of EMU beat lefty Tim Carr in straight sets 6-2, 7-5. 
In the strangest match of the day, Notre Dame captain Dan Walsh defeated Aziz Hoosenaly 6-0, 0-6, 7-5. Walsh relied on a strong backhand to rally from being down 4-1 in the third set. 
In other matches, freshman Mike Wallace trounced Eas­tern Michigan's Jim Arvidson 6-2, 6-0, Dave Reiter beat Dean Dancer 6-5, 3-6, 6-1, and both Brian Kalbas and Paul Daggs won in straight sets 6-2, 6-2. 
In doubles action, Wallace and Sean O'Brien defeated Jim Arvidson and Frank Polito 6-3, 6-0. The team of Kolbass and Dagg topped Hoosenaly and Dancer 6-3, 6-0. In EMU's only doubles victory, Matt Khuman and Greg Kennett squeaked by the Irish tandem of Reiter and Carr 6-4, 7-5. 
The wind was aggravating players from both teams. Greg Kennett of EMU explained how it affected his game. 
"The wind took my toss and hurt my game," he said. "I'm a serve and volley player and the wind forced me to play a baseline game, which is one of Brian's (Kalbas) strengths." 
Notre Dame's Paul Daggs, who defeated Joe Wolf, agreed that the wind played a part in the match. 
"The wind was a major fac­tor," he said. "In weather like this, patience is important. I think we adjusted very well to the conditions." 
Irish head coach Tom Fallon said he feels the solid victory is a good sign for the tough up­coming matches. 
"The wind bothered Eastern Michigan but it blew on both sides of the net," Fallon said. "I think we're used to it.

Gail Sutton and Julie Ross, 7-5, 6-4. 
Other winners were the team of Sandy Hickey and Charlene Szajko over Kim Hewlett and Mary Burch, 6-4, 7-6. 
The Belles had a hard time in the match against Evansville, but Laverie said they gained a great deal of ex­perjence by playing such an ac­complished team . 
"Once again, the matches were a lot closer than the scores reveal," said Laverie. "I am very happy with the per­formance of out doubles teams. They have really improved over the season."

ND lacrosse beats Kenyon 
Special to The Observer 
The Notre Dame lacrosse team came from behind to take a 15-11 win over Kenyon Satur­day. 
The Irish held Kenyon score­less in the last 20 minutes of the contest, and scored seven goals in a row to raise their record to 3-2. 
Kenyon had held a 10-8 lead in the third quarter, before the Irish rallied to take the victory. Jim Shields and John Olmstead each tallied five goals to lead the Irish attack.

Hoops 
continuedfrom page 12 
Verkler's Construction pounded Leslie Cheswiok, 21-8, behind Irish tight ends coach George Stewart's 9-of-13 shoot­ing and Jim Dolan's 14 rebounds. Head Coach Lou Holtz struggled to an 0-of-5 shooting day, and pulled no punches in analyzing his per­formance. 
"I played terrible," said Holtz. "I set the game of bas­ketball back twenty years with my performance today. In fact, they tried to bring out a peach basket for me at halftime." 
While Holtz played a rela­tively insignificant role in his squad's victory, another campus celebrity was actually leading his team to a win. Monk Malloy shot 4-of-8, all from well beyond would-be three-point land, as All the President's Men withstood a second half rally to put away Watches, Rings ... by the score of 21-13. 
Malloy performed much bet­ter on Saturday than he did in his first outing, and attributed much of his improvement to his teammates, especially Rob Wiese, who was unable to play with the President's Men in the first round. 
"It helps to have Rob with us," said Malloy of the 6-2 senior. "It also helps when you don't have a blizzard or pouring rain or freezing winds bother­ing your outside shot. We b_eat a pretty good team, and they were a good bunch of guys. I feel pretty good about the way we played." 
Malloy feels that if his squad can continue to play the way they have, they can win at least one or two more rounds. Watches team member and quickness personified Matt "the Cat" Uhoda agrees with the President-elect. 
"I feel that, in general, we were outmanned,'' said Uhoda, a sophomore who led the Watches... with six points. "And don't let anyone tell you that Monk can't play. He's got quick hands, a solid jumper, rebounds well and plays good defense. I think his team can make some waves." 

Deathtongue picked up its third victory despite only actu­ally playing one game. The team won its second game by forfeit Saturday and should be well-rested heading into a dif­ficult third round confrontation with Ball-Headed Freak­daddies, which licked SSE and the Lollypop Kids, 21-13. 
Grand Illusion dethroned Four Little Kings, 21-8, behind Marty "We play hoops in Canada too" Strasen's 8-of-14 shooting. Also on Saturday, Carte Blanche whitewashed Team No. 531, 21-3, led by George Baldus' 10-of-12 shoot­ing, and Cubs Lose Again won and We May Not... didn't (figure that one out). At any rate, the score was 21-12. 
In two physical, yet well­played, games at Stepan Courts on Friday, G-Men tossed Spigot O'Vomit, 21-16, and Ed Smerciak's Last Hur­rah dashed the upset hopes of Willie and the Wanna Bees, winning by the score of 21-17. 
Also Friday, Four Fags and a Zahmbie grounded Papa Sumby and the Flying Eg­gmen, 21-6. The Fags did more than hold their own against Papa Sumby, and with a balanced attack continue to skip merrily down the path leading to the tourney finals. In other action, Dead Chicks Don't Say No denied I Need a Lover That Won't Drive Me Crazy, 21-10, and Scott DuPree's 9-of-21 shooting led Uncoachables III past Antonet­ti's Revenge, 21-16.

The march to the Bookstore finals continues as the tournament field steadily grows smaller. 
Mize claims Masters title with spectacular playoff shot 
Associated Press 
AUGUSTA, Ga.-Larry Mize, a native son of this old southern city, turned back two stars of international golf with a spec­tacular pitch-in birdie that won a sudden death playoff yester­day in the 51st Masters golf tournament. 
Mize won the coveted green jacket that goes to the Masters champion with a pitch from about 30-40 yards to the right of the 11th hole, the second of the sudden death playoff. 
Mize played the shot to the fringe, then stood frozen in fas­cination as the ball took off, running straight into the cup. That eliminated Greg Norman of Australia, while Seve Balles­teros of Spain bogeyed the first sudden death hole to drop out. 
"It's a dream come true," Mize said. "I've dreamed of winning the Masters, but I never dreamed of winning it like this -beating two of the greatest golfers in the world." 
The ball disappeared into the hole like the flash of a cotton­tail rabbit ducking into its bur­row. 
The quiet, soft-spoken Mize leaped high into the air, then went hopping around the green, raising both hands in elation and clasping them to his head.

Defense sparkles again in 2nd Irish scrimmage 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
Fourteen to nothing, offense. 

That was the final score. But just ask anyone who took in the Notre Dame football team's second scrimmage of the spring season and they'll tell you who won. The defense, hands down. 
Spring Football '87 
"I thought the hitting was ex­cellent as always," said Head Coach Lou Holtz, after watch­ing his defensive corps domi­nate for the second consecutive time this spring. "Our defense is getting much better at rush­
ing  the  passer,  and  I  think  
they're  really  progr essing  
well."  

And ifyou want numbers, the score would have to include five quarterback sacks, two passes broken up and a fumble recovery. Linebackers held down the top four slots in the tackle department-Ned Bolcar and Mike Stonebreaker with 10 apiece, and Wes Pritchett and Greg Hudson adding eight each. 
Junior quarterback Terry Andrysiak led the No. 1 offense past the goal line on the second possession of the day, with sophomore tailback Mark Green capping a 75-yard drive against the No. 2 defense. Green took a pitch from

Favorites hang tough in 2nd-round contests 
By PETE SKIKO and BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writers 
The third round of Bookstore Basketball XVI gets underway today as this weekend's survivors look to find a spot in the coveted round of 64. 
The cream of the crop survived a few weekend scares to put themselves among the 128 teams now remaining in the tourna­ment, while several upstarts find themselves still in the thick of things. 
Defending champions Party At Chips When We Repeat, known last year as Lee's BBQ Roundhouse, continued its quest towards that victory party by defeating Too True To Be Good, 21-8.

Leone's Stallions galloped to a decisive 21-7 win over Team No. 622, showing the same intensity that took it to a second place showing in last year's tournament. The Stallions' Gary Sass and Bill Sullivan paced their team with nine and eight points respec­tively. 
Da' Brothers of Manhood, again without the services of track and football star Tim Brown, stormed past Team No. 150, 21-9, with a balanced scoring effort and an intimidating defense that forced its opponent to shoot 9-of-40, mostly from the outside. Steve Lawrence led all scorers with nine points, while Joel Wil­liams pulled down eleven rebounds and had a monstrous blocked shot that nearly put out a window at Flanner Hall.

winning the Masters. I did," Mize said. 
It was the climax of a struggle in which six men either led or shared the lead at one time or another. 
And it beat the two dominant figures in golf today, Norman, the flamboyant "Great White Shark," and Ballesteros, the Spanish master who has won this championship twice and owns a couple of British Open titles. 
They were Mize's playoff partners after all three finished the regulation 72 holes in a tie for the top at 285, only three shots under par on the Augusta National Golf Club course. 
Mize birdied the 72nd hole from about three feet to finish a 71 and was the first in the clubhouse. 
Ballesteros was next, and he saved par from a bunker to set up the playoff. He, too had a 71. 
Then came Norman, the out­standing player in world golf last year, who moved into a tie with a 20-foot birdie putt on the 17th, then parred the 18th to complete an erratic 72 that in­cluded six birdies and as many bogeys. 
The ninth playoff in Masters history began on the lOth hole. 
Ballesteros was eliminated there. He 3-putted for bogey, missing a 5-6 foot second putt. Mize had chance to win it all. 
but he left a 10-12 foot birdie attempt hanging on the lip of the cup. He tapped in. Norman, who had missed a birdie from about 20 feet, also made par and they went to the 11th. 
Mize and Norman both drove the fairway. 
Mize pushed his approach far, far to the right and turned his back on the shot while it was in the air. 
Norman, the current British Open title-holder and perhaps the most feared competitor in the game today, also put his ap­proach to the right, on the fringe.
