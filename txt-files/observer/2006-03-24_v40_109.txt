Domers defend dorm life at Notre Dame 

S-tudents offer praise for residence hall system, but admit drawbacks to all-inclusive living 
Are Students Satisfied with ND's Residence Hall Systern? Nearly one-fifth of all undergraduate students opt to live in off-campus apartments or houses-a percentage that has risen slowly over time. Despite a 2 percent increase, numbers have remained more or less constant in recent years.

Editor's Note: This is the last of a three-part series examining the absence of fraternities and sororities at Notre Dame. 
At a Nov. 16 Student Senate meeting, Zahm Hall's representative pro­posed a resolution that would formally recognize the dorm as "Zahm House" -a move that invoked laughter before its failure to garner enough support among voters. 
Zahm senator Pat Knapp alluded to other dorms ­like Morrissey Manor and Sorin College -that have dropped the "Hall" in their names, asserting that "such names and cultures build community among the student body." 
Student body president Dave Baron supported the resolution. Praising Zahm's uniqueness on campus, he said he had no problem with the proposal because it "foster[ed] dorm 
identity." 
But Dillon senator Dan Bowen opposed the resolu­tion and said Zahm was "trying to leave the impression they're a fra­ternity." Such a claim would be "very contrary" to Notre Dame tradition and policy, he said. 
A chance for change? 
Zahm residents may or may not have intended to blur the lines of distinction between residence hall and fraternity, but their motion demonstrated the desire some students have for an officially recognized Greek system at Notre Dame. 
Keough freshman E.J. Alston expressed dissatis­faction with the current residence hall system and said he wished University policy permitted fraterni­ties and sororities. 
"I think having a Greek life would boost the social scene on campus and make it more fun," Alston said. "If there was a Greek

Beast of burden

by all tlw l'l'f'ort we put into every­
day life, be il homework, jobs, 
activities --anything really. 
So imagine it was true: nothing matters. That test you're worried about or homework you're doing­no worries. It won't matter in the long run. We all end up the same, so why care? I realized that if I start thinking that way now, all that I have done with my life up to this point will mean nothing as well. And I've spent a lot of energy throughout my life to get to where I am now, it would be a shame to think none of it was ever worth anything. It's as if I've carried a huge rock down a road so far that if I wcrn to put it down before I get to where I'm going, then why did I piek it up in the first place? All I have now when I reach my destina­tion is a sore back and no rock to show for il.. Why I wanted a rock in theJirst. place is a whole other issue ... Maybe I was going to see a geologist, who knows? 
What got me started thinking about this topic was a passage from a strange philosophy book I have, describing a fictional conver­sation God has with himself. In the passage, Cod ponders the fact that he sent a message to free humankind, yet they chose to ignore this message and continue shouldering their burdens. 
My first reaetion was to wonder what message could God be send­ing to free us from something so universal as burden? And also, how did burdens get such a bad reputa­tion in the first place? Adaptation is one of' the greatest abilities of human beings, and without hard­ship we wouldn't have anything to adapt to. 
The rocks we carry around make life interesting-without any trou­bles, thorn can be no victories. An old swim coach of mine often said, "Winners are only as great as the competitors they defeat," and the same applies to burdens. A per­son's greatness is measured by the magnitude of the burdens they overcome.

Man catches train, for­gets baby in car 
WASHINGTON-Comm­uters racing to catch the train typically forget things in the ear -keys, wallets, briefcases. But a baby daughter? 
That's what happened Thursday just north of Washington, police say. 
"Dad forgot baby was in the car, parked the car, got on the Metro," said Lucille Baur, a spokeswoman for the Montgomery County, Md., Police Department. 
"I don't know exactly when he got the memory flash, but he was in D.C. when it was the horrible defining moment, 'Oh my goodness, I think I've left my child back in my car,"' Baur said. 
At that point, she said, Jonathan Sander got off the southbound train and onto a northbound one, returning to the Shady Grove Metrorail station about 12 miles north of Washington.

"Women Honoring Women" award ceremony and dinner. Communications disord11rs pro­fessor Susan Latham and biology professor and pre-profp,ssional studies advisor Nancy Nekvasil were also nominated. 
All three nominees possess a deep passion for their work and for Saint Mary's students, stu­dent body vic11 pr11sident Susan McllduiT said. 
This year, stud11nts nominated more than 70 faculty members to be th11 next recipient of the award. From those submissions, a snlection eommittee then chose the top three nominees. The win­ner was chosen by the Student Academic Council (SAC), which ineludf~s student representatives from each academic major. 
With only one vote diiTcr11nce between each nominne, Merryman was nam11d the win­ner of this year's award. 
"Professor Merryman is truly an exam pie of what faculty should bn," SAC business and economics rPpresentative Anna (;ilsinger said. "Siw goes the extra mile to see her students sucCfH~d and takes a personal interest in each student she teaches." 
Merryman won the award for the tnmwndous care she pro­vides for her students outside of the classroom by attending their extraf:urricular events and incor­porating real life concepts into the elassroom, Gilsinger said. 
McllduiT said the nominees are just a sampling of the many fac­ulty members who contribute so much of themselves. to the bet­terment of the students. 
"The nominees here tonight inspire students, faculty and staff to expand upon their gifts in ways they never thought possi­ble," McllduiT said. 
Both Nekvasil and ·Latham have helped students accomplish their post-graduation dreams by serving as support beams within the graduate and medical school testing and application process. 
Latham, a Saint Mary's gradu­ate, has overseen the extensive growth of a communication dis­orders minor at the College, a program that has led to a 100 percent graduate school accept­ance rate of seniors who wish to pursue a career in the field, SAC communications disorders repre­sentative Dana Christiano said. 
Nekvasil has also gone above and beyond to support students, SAC biology representative Amy Oliva said. During the past two years, 100 percent of College graduates who applied to med­ic<tl school were accepted. 
Students from eaeh academic department, Board of Governanee members, College faeulty and top administrators ­including College President Carol Ann Mooney -were in atten­dance to honor the work of Merryman and the other nomi­nees. 
The annual award ceremony is an important yearly opportunity that allows the College to come together to honor a faculty mem­ber for their dedication to the Saint Mary's community, Mcllduff said.

tion of and desire for diversity is a goal of Notre Dame's A'iian American Association, Lichon said it is not the most featured aspect of the InFocus confer­ence. 
"Our title this year is 'Voices of Modern Asian America,' and we wanted to discuss ways in which Asian Americans could find their voice and being com­fortable in expressing them­selves," he said. '"'rhe key to this year's conference is pro­moting ways in which Asian Americans can make a difTer­ence in the world, starting with gaining understanding of them­selves and others, helping them to follow their drnams and pas­sions and then focusing on ways in which to express them­selves most· fully within the world." 
But while the program is hosted by the A'iian American Association and centers on issues of A'iian heritage, identi­ty and culture, it is Lichon's hope that non-Asian students elect to attend conference events as wnll. 
"The audience has been in past years, mostly Asian," he said. "We defmitely would like students who are not Asian [to] attend. I've found though that it's hard to market to all stu­dents. Even some of my own friends lind it dillicult to attend to attend the conference because it is an Asian American A'isociation event." 
With this in mind, the organ­izers of InFocus 2006 made an attempt to spread a welcoming word across eampus. 
"We made a better effort this year to spread news about the conference by word of mouth," he said. "We thought personal invitations would be the best way to get other students to attend the conference. This is actually one of the specific ways we tried to target the non-Asian American popula­tion." 
InFocus began in 2002 as a 
medium for A s i a n American awareness, said Paul Nguyen and Linh Tu, co­chairs of the organizing committee for the event. Each year, the conference invites a select group of A'iian Americans accomplished in a variety of professional 'fields to deliver 

Iecturns and participate in panel discussions on campus. 
InFocus, organized by stu­dent members of Notre Dame's Asian American Association, also provides student involve­ment opportunities through the workshops, all of which are conducted by student planning committees. The conference presents a forum for Notre Dame students to interact with and listen to these featured guests and gives the Notre Dame student community an opportunity to come together in striving for diversity, Nguyen and Tu said.

U.S. and British forces free hostages 
BAGHDAD --U.S. and British forces stormed a house and freed three Christian peace activists Thursday without firing a shot, ending a four-month hostage ordeal that saw an American in the group killed and dumped along a railroad track. 
The U.S. ambassador and the top American military spokesman held out hope the operation on the outskirts of Baghdad could lead to a break in the cap­tivity of American reporter Jill Carroll, a freelance writer for The Christian Science Monitor who was abducted Jan. 7. 
The military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch, said the 8 a.m. rescue of the Briton and two Canadians from a "kidnapping cell" was based on information divulged by a man during interrogation only three hours earlier. The man was captured by 
U.S. forces on Wednesday night. 
Chilean busfound to be unlicensed 
AHICA, Chile -The Chilean government and a Miami-based cruise line distanced themselves Thursday from the operator of a tour bus that plunged down an Andean cliff, killing 12 elderly tourists from New Jersey and Connecticut. 
Celebrity Cruises said Andino Tours, whose white bus tumbled more than 300 feet Wednesday afternoon, wasn't among the agencies it authorizes to run side trips l'or passengers during port stops. It also said the victims made their own arrange­ments to visit a national park. 
Chilean officials said Andino Tours had not yet received official approval and the bus, which had a capacity of 16 passen­gers. wasn't registered to carry tourists.

Before court-appointed defense attorneys could begill their case, Moussaoui announced loudly as he left for a recess that he would tes­tify in his own behalf. 
"I will testify. Zerkin, whether you want it or not," he said, referring to one of his lawyers, Gerald Zerkin. The 37 -year-old Frenchman, who is the only person charged in this. country in connection with the 2001 attacks, has refused to cooperate with his lawyers.

Young took part in the pep rally in his new position as a paid corporate cheerleader for Wal-Mart -a role that has perplexed some of his longtime civil rights colleagues, who have all but accused him of going over to the enemy. 
Activists for the poor have long complained that Wal-Mart skimps on wages and health ben­efits, forces employees to work ofT the clock, and kills oiTmom-and-pop businesses.

IN BRIEF 
Companies refuse to split CEO posts 
NEW YORK -Appointing someone other than the CEO to chair a board of directors is hardly a cure-all for corporate mismanagement, but it's dis­appointing to see companies' stubborn resistance to a logical improvement in checks and balances. 
The latest big name to reject a practice that's commonplace in other countries is Citigroup Inc., whose board has chosen chief executive Charles Prince to succeed the retiring Sanford I. Weill as chairman of the financial services conglomerate. 
While Prince is well-regarded for his steady stewardship the past two years, such qualities have limited relevance to the added benefit of a truly independent voice who can ask tough ques­tions of the CEO from a vantage point that's not so intertwined with day-to-day operations. 
This is particularly true for Citigroup, a vast organization that's working to move beyond a series of costly ethical fumbles during Weill's tenure a.c; CEO and chairman. These have included billions of dollars in settlements regarding Citigroup's connections to the Enron and WorldCom scandals, as well as revelations of biased stock recommendations favoring invest­ment banking clients. 
Home sales post unexpected gain 
WASIIINGTON -Sales of existing homes had fallen for five straight months before an unexpected increase in February, helped by unusually warm weather. But slack demand in some formally red-hot housing markets produced what one analyst called a "tale of two cities." 
The National Association of Realtors reported Thursday that sales of existing sin­gle-family homes rose by 5.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.91 million units. 
The biggest increase in two years took economists by surprise. They had expected a drop of about 1 percent after five months of declines. 
One of the economy's standout performers over the past five years, housing has been slowing in recent months. 
Analysts cautioned against reading too much into the February increase, saying it primarily reflected an unusually mild win­ter, which boosted buyer traffic.

Stocks slide on oil price jump 
Worries about inflation and strong economic news contribute to Wall Street fall 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Wall Street had a renewed case of interest rate anxiety Thursday, with stocks falling on strong economic news and a jump in oil prices that heightened worries about inflation. 
A 5.2 percent upswing in monthly sales of existing homes eased worries about a slowdown in the housing market but fed fears that the Federal Reserve will continue boosting interest rates to stave off price inflation. The Fed's Open Market Committee meets next week. 
Investors also fretted about a Labor Department report that 302,000 work­ers applied for jobless benefits last week, down 11,000 from the week before and marking the first decline in a inonth. The implied job growth added to Wall Street's inflation and interest rate concerns. 
The unemployment numbers "increase the probability the Fed will make its way back to 5 percent," said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist for Prudential Fixed Income.

concerns over CWIL's method of monetary distribution. To Kachurek, it seemed as though CWIL awarded grants to more students in smaller monetary amounts, rather than more com­pletely fulfilling the requests of just a few student requests. 
Meyer-Lee emphasized that no project could be funded 100 per­cent. 
"With more applicants, there is less money to go around," she said. "This year there had to be over 50 applicant.<;." 
Linda Biggins, the CWIL admin­istrative assistant, agreed with Meyer-Lee that it is better to make the money go farther. 
"I think it is better that CWIL help more students have a study abroad experience by awarding even a partial amount of the pro­gram cost, than to help fewer stu­dents by awarding larger grant amount.<;," Biggins said. 
Kachurek and Fricano opted to abort their project, despite the extensive research and hard work they contributed to it. 
"After laboring over the pro­posal, making contacts here in town and internationally, getting recommendations and setting up and independent study. I know there is no way we can do it now," Kachurek said. 
Kachurek, however, did not dis­credit CWIL as an organization. 
"I don't w.ant to sound ungrate­ful, but I would have rather seen CWIL approve a smaller amount of projects and make them possi­ble for students financially." she said. 
Other students have had much more positive experiences with 
CWIL. 

Junior Sara Otto received a CWIL Study Abroad Grant last year and was able to travel to Lourdes, France for three weeks this past summer, where she studied French in the morning and volunteered at the Lourdes Sanctuary in the afternoon to help sick grotto pilgrims. Otto was awarded roughly 65 percent of the money she needed to com­plete her project ($2,308 of $3,555) -unlike this year's applicants. 
CWIL left the logistics of hous­ing, transportation and the school system up to Otto but gave her a strong financial foundatnm for her trip. 
"This was not a school-related program, so CWIL just sent the check," Otto said. "I did the rest." 
Upon her return, Otto was responsible to educate this year's applicants on the process and her experience. 
"My trip wouldn't have been possible without CWIL," she said. "As a nursing major, I would not have had the opportunity to go abroad if it was not over the sum­mer. It was an amazing experi­ence and I envy the girls who get to go this year." 
Otto's experience, however, has not been a common trend among this year's applicants. 
Senior Katie Kelly, student rep­resentative to the Advisory. Committee for International Intercultural Learning, was also able to take advantage of the abroad program through CWIL. While Kelly said she, like other applicants, always hoped for the most money, she said sometimes CWIL cannot accommodate everyone. 
"I know how frustrating the lack of funding can be. but CWIL is just trying to ensure that every­one can have this opportunity," she said. 
Kelly was happy with her chance to go abroad, but said she only received about 25 percent of the funding needed for her trip to Honduras. 
Prepared to pay a large amount of her own money to finance the trip, Kelly took a second job to do so. 
"It takes sacrifice," she said. "It is a hard process, but the grants aren't meant to fully fund trips. They are meant to be awards." 
Kelly had been involved with CWIL prior to applying for a grant and now helps the abroad committee with approving stu­dent proposals for grants. She said the amount of money award­ed depends on the merit of the applicants and the effort they put into their proposals. 
Saint Mary's Study Abroad Advisor Sarah DeMott supervises the CWIL grants. She explained that the purpose of the CWIL organization is to acknowledge what learning and skills are nec­essary for Saint Mary's women to be leaders in today's world. 
DeMott emphasized the impor­tance of intercultural leadership skills in the everyday world. 
"Intercultural competency has been identified as a distinct and essential dimension for leader­ship," she said. 
DeMott also said she has seen unparalleled success with the grant program over the past few years. 
"I see the CWIL Student Travel Grants as fostering the mission of CWIL in two ways," she said. "First, as a basic utilitarian tool to financially encourage studying abroad and second, as a brilliant signet in students' portfolios and resumes to indicate intercultural awareness." 

Tracy Robison, Director of Intercultural Living at Saint Mary's, has been involved in the grant program for the past three years and said that each year, the quality of the grant proposals improve. 
"The student proposals are innovative and are good exam­ples of students taking the knowl­edge they have gained at Saint Mary's one step further," Robison said. 
Robison stressed that grants are based on the merit of the pro­posal as well as financial need. She also said that, despite the accusations, there is not truth behind spreading the money over more proposals. 
"The efforts of Dr. Meyer-Lee and Sarah DeMott increased the number of Saint Mary's student.<; studying abroad by increasing the knowledge and advantage of the student travel grants," she said. 
Meyer-Lee said she is very proud of the student.<; able to go abroad through CWIL. 
"The students who have taken advantage of this opportunity have found their additional investment well rewarded by life­changing learning," she said. 
Although there have been 
recent discrepancies over the amount of money given in the grants, DeMott said she hopes that CWII. will still be considered 
· a positive asset for students wanting to study abroad. 
"I would hope that all recipi­ents appreciate the recognition and prestige of being awarded grant funding for intercultural pursuit," DeMott said.

Exatnining the decline of support for President Bush 
This week marked the third anniver­sary of the Iraqi invasion and conjured the obvious question, "How is it going?" President George W. Bush claims that great progress is not reported by American reporters, thus Iraq is not as bad as the average American may believe. Yet in the same breath. he con­dudes that American soldiers will remain in Iraq beyond his term ending in Jan., 2009. But with the British drawing down their troop level to 17 per­cent of their total, the new question is, "Are the British and Americans in the same war?'' 
The Iraqi quality of life belies the president's contention. Today, fewer families have electricity in Iraq than before the invasion. Less oil is produced than three years ago. Fewer have run­ning water or sewage treatment. In fact, earlier this week ABC News aired a spontaneous poll of Iraqi police standing at roll call. Asked for a show of hands of those who believe that they are worse off now than under Sad dam's rule, near­ly two-thirds raised their hands for the camera in a less than resounding hearts and minds moment from the local front­line defenders of Iraqi democracy. 
A president generally loses support

Capital Comments 

when the public perceives distrust, deceit, disgust, disappointment or dis­grace. The president surely becomes paralyzed if the public assigns him one of the dreaded five "D" grades. With Iraq and domestic spying, Bush has firmly planted his feet in the quicksand of distrust and disappointment. 
Bush's popularity peaked after the 9/11 attacks at 90 percent approval. Patriotic Democrats like this writer set aside political affiliation to make an American statement and support our commander-in-chief. Even French news­papers caught world sentiment when headlines read, "We are all Americans." 
Bush's handling of Iraq steadily declined to 72 percent at the start of the invasion to 59 percent when he declared "mission accomplished" on the aircraft carrier. He slipped to 42 percent approval after disgusting revelations of American soldiers' treatment of prison­ers at Ahu Ghraib prison. He further suffered declines last month to 39 per­cent and now at only 31 percent approval. 
Bush disappointed many by squander­ing that moment of world unity after 9/11 through miscalculations and strong-headed denials. Americans began to distrust Bush when he attempted to appear steady and strong while never adjusting for changing con­ditions. Only now Bush hints that some changes are needed. What he views as weakness and called "flip-flopping" in his last campaign now rhetorically pro-
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Defending Greek life 
I am a transfer student who was very active in Chi Omega at my previous school. 
Leaving my sisters was extremely difficult, but we've managed to remain in contact thanks to the strong bonds we formed through our sorority. 
It's true that Greek life promotes social participation; however, it's demeaning to equate this to academic indifference. Most Greek organizations won't even allow their pledges to initiate unless they have at least a 'B' average. That's one of the only requirements of pledges. The others are more along the lines of being trustworthy and considerate than being alcoholic and promiscuous. 
Instead of portraying this truth, the media makes every incident involving a fraternity or sorority member into an attack on the entire Greek system. Because a small percentage make a bad deci­sion, the entire system must be flawed? The Greek system has become intolerant of such behavior, and any offender is subject to immediate expulsion from their organization and the school. In many cases, students affiliated with Greek life are prone to harsher punishments and held to higher standards because of their choice to go Greek. 
We also do not accept discrimination. It is my opinion that Greek life actually promotes diversity. Every ethnicity was largely repre­sented in the Greek life on my old campus. Not only were the organizations diverse in ethnicity, but every fraternity and sorority had members active in everything from athletics to theatre. We also had a variety of majors that I would have never met without Greek life. Most of the girls I became closest to where in that category. 
We weren't restricted to members of our sorority either. All the Greek life would band together for service projects and campus­wide activities. But no one hears about fraternities raising money for Make a Wish Foundation or sororities visiting nursing homes. People maintain the image of John Belushi and Jack Daniel's with­out realizing there's more to fraternities. The only hint of reality in "Animal House" was the participation of the Greeks in the home­coming parade. Sadly, ours has never involved a Death-mobile. We do not steal each other's cars or kill people's horses or paddle our pledges by candle light. In fact, my initiation did not involve alcohol, nudity or physical abuse. Every person involved in Greek life has gone through the "hazing" that everyone is so afraid of, so how bad can you believe it to be? If anything, initiation is a reflection of the type of people at the university. With that in mind, I have no doubt that here, the greatest university in the world, would likewise have the greatest Greeks in the world.

hibits him from making lifesaving adjustments. 
Even Ronald Heagan, after cutting taxes, supported eleven "revenue enhancements" (tax increases) to help control budget deficits by portraying them as adjustments. Bush would do well to use the Reagan model. 
Foremost, Bush·should recognize that the National Guard and reservists are not suitable for long-term combat. On Wednesday, 24-year-old Sergeant Michael Smith, the tenth soldier at Abu Ghraib to be convicted for dereliction of duty and maltreating prisoners, testified that, "Soldiers are not supposed to be soft and cuddly." While the court found that he conspired with another dog han­dler in a contest to make detainees soil themselves, the details of degradation is not the point of the Abu Ghraib failure. 
The virtue of the United States is that it is the beacon of freedom and shining envy of democracy. It must always exemplify those values. When the presi­dent objects to Senator John McCain's anti-torture language against the CIA, the president loses credibility. When part-time soldiers are forced to serve in a permanent war zone -beyond 2009 according to Bush -the quality of our mission suffers. 
The Notre Dame ROTC community, of which I was a member, must take note of the graduate who cannot leave the Army reserve despite completing his eight-year commitment. Even with no "stop loss" order in effect, the Army will

not release him. It seems that the unwritten rule is that unless reservists tour Iraq, they are not released despite serving a full commitment. 
Early this year, the Notre Dame gradu­ate filed suit against the Army. In what appears to be retaliation, the Army reassigned him to Iraq in April. He now has filed for an injunction. Enforcement of the unwritten tour requirement may keep boots on the ground for now. but it fosters feelings of deceit and distrust which are eroding the president's mili­tary support. 
Long ago, Democrats and most Independents abandoned this president. Bush only has himself to blame for the Republicans who are currently drifting .I I away. As a rule, if at least 80 percent of I I Republicans support Bush, his overall I approval breaks 40 percent or higher. I

While history kindly treated Harry Truman after he left office, few compare Bush to Truman. Ironically, they look at the last president to find himself in such turmoil and who left his war for his suc­cessor to remedy -fellow Texan Lyndon Johnson.

DVD REVIEW 

Disney disaster 'Chicken Little' lays an egg 
By MARY SQUILLACE 
Scene Critic 
Back in the day, Disney movies meant classic tales punctuated with catehy songs that oiTored oven college students a fun nostalgic retreat. "Chicken Little" is not one of those movies. 
While it has lured audience members in with its soemingly cute and euddly 3-D characters, Dism~y·s latf~st relea.c;;e fails to live up to the brand's legacy. 
"Chicken Little" takes plaee in a bizarre eontomporary animal world, where Chicken Little has been ostracized for claiming that thn sky is falling when a piece of tho sky appears to land on his head. Feeling rejeeted by his eommunity, dassmatns and nven his father, Chicken Little vows to prove himself by joining the baseball team. Miraeulously, after not having been allowed to play in any prior games, he manages to seore the winning run in the ehampionship. 
Although his victory on the baseball field earns Chiekcn Little the approval he older audience is with one of the charac­ters, the overweight Runt of the Litter, who frequently bursts into popular songs. Unfortunately, this character's effect is more nerve-grating than laugh-generat­ing. 


Armed with their wacky traits that we've seen embodied by a dozen other far more endearing individuals, the film's characters are equally painful to watch. Even big-name actors who sup­plied voices to the characters -Zach Braff as Chicken Little, Joan Cusack as Abby Mallard, and the talented Amy Sedaris as Chicken Little's nemesis, Foxy Loxy -fail to breathe life or humor into the film. 
Another disappointing aspect of 
"Chicken Little" is its song selection. Sitting through the overdramatic tunes is enough to make anyone pity the soccer moms and dads who will endure playing the soundtrack on repeat to entertain four-year-olds. 
The ftlm is released on DVD today and includes deleted scenes, alternate open­ings and games, as well as a variety of other bonus features. But not even a dia­mond encrusted DVD case could make it a worthwhile investment. 
Instead of wasting money on Chicken Little, the $19.99 would be better spent on a whole lot of poultry.

desires from his father, he is instantly faeed with a new challenge when aliens invade his town. Alongside his wacky friends, Chicken Little manages to muster the courage and self-confidence to save the day. 
Okay, sure it's the standard kids' fllm ­predictable and riddled with corny, feel­good messages -but when compared against the likes of "Shrek" and "Finding Nemo," "Chicken Little" only appears more pathetic. Animated films have previ­ously overcome the age barrier by appeal­ing to an adult audience through sly paro­dies and PG jokes that go over younger audience members' heads. 
"Chicken Little," on the other hand, tries for this effect but fails. It packs in too many eheesy gimmicks that are strung together and stretched over an extremely thin plot. With a story that switches gears so many times, the audience gets the feel­ing that the filmmakers were frantically trying to compensate for a story that sim­ply did not provide enough substance for an entertaining film. In fact, despite its feature-length film status at 81 minutes, 
this film feels more like an animated short. The allu­sions to pop-culture that do exist fall short in deliv­ering laughs. One espe­cially cringe-worthy attempt at parody features one of the eharacters con­structing an Empire State Building replica and imi­tating King Kong. 
Another way the film­makers try to tap into an 
PLAY REVIEW 

'A Few Good Men' clashes with contemporary issues 
By MARTY SCHROEDER Scene Critic 
GuanUinamo Bay, Cuba has become one of the most controversial topics of modern times. It is the only American military installation on the soil of a Communist country and has come to represent certain aspects of the "war on terror" that some lind absolutely neces­sary and others absolutely reprehensi­ble. 
This naval base is at the foeus of "A Fnw Good Men," a play written by Aaron Sorkin and presented by the St. Edward's Hall Players. Performed in Washington Hall and directed by Patriek Vassel, the production takes on a unique perspective due to the events surrounding the current U.S. foreign policy. 

Thn play ennters around two Marines, Lance Corporal Harold Dawson and Private First Class ( PFC) Louden Downey, who are stationed at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. The pair are chargnd with the murder of PFC William Santiago and brought to Washington, D.C. for trial. The lawyers assigned to the case are Lieutenants Daniel Kal'fee and Sam Weinberg and LifJUtenant Commander Joanne Galloway. They begin an investigation that starts with the Private First Class on trial and rises up the ranks to Lieutenant Colonel Nathan Jessep, the commanding officer of Guantanamo Bay. 
One of the issues in performing this play is that it will inevitably draw com­parisons to the well-known 1992 film directed by Hob Heiner. This particular production was based on the stage play, written by Sorkin before he penned the screenplay. However, the performance was able to stand on its own and brought its own flavor and unique char­acteristics, separating it from the film. 
Drew McElligott put on an excellent performance as the deadly serious Jessep. In a role that garnered Jack Nicholson an Oscar nomination for the film, McElligott brought his own style and feel to the character, one that is much more than a rehash of Nicholson's performance. 
Equally intimidating is the role of Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick, played by Jeff Eyerman. Eyerman effec­tively brings out the religious fervor and devotion to the Marines of this character. Matt Goodrich was also very good as Kaffee and Kathleen Ryan and Brandon McGirr provide notable sup­porting roles as Galloway and Weinberg, respectively. Overall, the cast manifests their characters memorably. 
The most noteworthy aspect of this particular production is the method of scene transition. In much the same way a tilm will have dialogue from a scene before a cut to that scene occurs, this performance ends some scenes as oth­ers are beginning. Lighting is used to notify a scene change and this provides conn~ctions to scenes that may not oth­erwise be considered connected as such. 
Also, the setting will change based on lighting and props used. A table that is in Kaffee's apartment will quickly become a table in the courtroom as the props used by the characters will change, the lighting will be altered, and characters will take positions that noti­fies the audience that the action is now in the courtroom. It is a highly effective method that provides connections not only on the artistic level, but showcases a very practical use of the space. 
This play takes on a different tone due to recent events. The prisoner scandals associated with Guantanamo Bay come to mind while watching this perform­ance. 
In a memorable line, Jessep states, "I have neither the time nor the inclina­tion to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide, and then questions the manner in which I provide it." 
This bold statement sums up the question that arises from the current situation at the Naval Base -do audi­ences assume that the government is protecting our interests and should be able to do whatever they need to make us safe, or should we know what goes on even if it means that we may be less secure? The answer to this question is not an easy one. 


"A Few Good Men" is not an anti-mili­tary play nor is it pro-military. It is a play that raises very important ques­tions about the nature of the law and what is permissible to provide national security. Vassel directs a very effective version of this play that showcases some of the best talent that Notre Dame has to offer in student-theater. 
While the film is very good, this play provides a new medium for which to enjoy this story and does a noteworthy job providing quality theater at Notre Dame.

chases audiences expect from a sum­mer blockbuster. 
The premise is simple. Crime has skyrocketed, so a new branch of the police has been formed to combat this growing menace. This new branch is referred to as the Pursuit Force. Designed to chase the criminals down using highly reckless actions, the for­mation of this branch sets the stage for the rest of the game. 
Many games feature all of the afore­mentioned Hollywood elements. But the unique part of "Pursuit Force" is the ability to 
mean much if they were not backed by solid game play. Fortunately, the controls are suffi­cient, with the driv­
ing sections reminiscent of "Burnout." The boat segments, as well as the on­foot parts, are equally easy to control, with the one dark spot being the afore­mentioned helicopter scenarios. 
Garners will find plenty of reasons to play "Pursuit Force," even after com­pleting the missions. 
Every mission is given a letter grade, with the higher grades being particu­larly difficult to obtain. The higher grades reward players with cheats, movies and new modes of pl"ay, providing added

This leads to some truly interesting scenarios, as players will find them­selves leapfrogging down a highway, jumping from car to car after the bad guys. There are also moments where the player will leap from a car to a boat, and then back again, all without interruption in the game play. 
Unfortunately, the combat helicopter moments are not as seamless or smooth when compared to their motor vehicle counterparts. Instead, a short cinematic shows the player leaping into the helicopter's cockpit. These seg­
an ordeal for the casual 
gamer. None of the mis­sions are impossible, but they can seem that way at first. Easily daunted garners might be better off looking for their action fix elsewhere. 
"Pursuit Force" is one of the defini­tive action experiences for Sony's portable system. 
Featuring a variety of modes, furious action and even a little humor, this game should provide plenty of hours of entertainment.

Associated Pres~ 

SAN FRANCISCO Barry Bonds plans to sue the authors and publisher of a book that alleges the San Francisco Giants' slug­ger used steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. 
Bonds' attorneys sent a letter Thursday to an· agent for the authors of "Game of Shadows," alerting them of plans to sue thp, writers, publisher Gotham Books, the San Francisco Chronicle and Sports Illustrated, which pub­lishnd excerpts this month. 
The letter, signed by Alison Berry Wilkinson, an associate of Bonds' lead attorney, Michael Rains, was posted on the Chronicle's Web Site. A hearing was tentatively scheduled for Friday in San Francisco Superior Court. 
The book by Chronicle reporters Mark Fainaru­Wada and Lance Williams was released Thursday. It claims Bonds used steroids, human growth hormone, insulin and other banned substances for at least five seasons beginning in 1998. 
"We certainly stand by our reporters and the rp,porting they did for us," Chroniclo executive vice president and editor Phil Bronstein said. "Nothing that's happened will change that." 
Bonds' legal team will ask a judge Friday to issue a temporary restraining order forfeiting all profits from publication and distri­bution, according to the let­ter. The lawyers plan to file the suit under California's unfair competition law. 
The Chronicle reported that the attorneys will ask a federal judgp, to initiate contempt proceedings "for the use of illegally obtained" grand jury tran­scripts the authors used in writing the book. The paper also reported that Hains said profits should be forfeited because of that. 
Williams and Fainaru­Wada said the book will stand up to a court chal­lenge. 

"I don't know what the legal action they contem­plate is," Williams said. "Gotham can speak to the legal issues but the facts in our book are true and they will stand up to scrutiny." 
"We fully stand behind our reporting of the book," Fainaru-Wada added. 
Lisa Johnson, a spokfls­woman for publisher Gotham Books, said the publisher supports both authors. "We at Gotham Books are shocked that Barry Bonds would take such a foolish step," slw said. "Any rospected First Amendment lawyer in America knows that his claim is nonsense."

Texas roundup: Squad to play Horns, Aggies 
By KATE GALES Associate Sports Editor 
Some say everything's bigger in Texas -and that includes challnngns on the tennis court. 
This weekend. the Irish trav­nl to Austin to face No. 5 Texas on Saturday and thnn to Colleg1~ Station to take on No. 22 Texas A&M. 
"I think I know them both very well." eoaeh Bobby Bayliss said. "[Texas) beat us 4-3 here last year, and they have pretty much the same toam back. They added one nnw player who's playing in the lower half of' the lineup, and they'rn vnry talented." 
In addition. Texas' Travis llnlgnson, ranked No. 20 nationally, is the older brother of Irish freshman Brett llelgnson, who stands at No. I 06 in thH country. 
Both tlw Longhorns and the Aggins beat No. :~ Illinois, which dnfnated the Irish 7-0 on Fnb. 7. 
The Irish are ranked No. 15 nationally and take a 15-4 record into Texas. They most recently played five matches over six days, which included an appmtrance in the finals of' the Bltw-Gray National Tennis Classic. 

FirsI on this week's agenda was reeovering from their gru­eling spring break. After taking-Monday off, the team focused on fundamentals and doubles. 
"Tuesday we actually focused really on just fundamentals ofT the ground -really driving the baH with our legs, hitting a lot of !'ross courts. getting baek into a groove," Bayliss said. "When you compete that much, little cracks and fissures start to show up in your game ... you need that solid time to get

the fundamentals back." 
The Irish will be forced to adjust to playing outdoors. Although spring break matches were all played outside, the team was unable to practice outdoors in South Bend. 
"Hopefully, we'll get to hit tomorrow evening in Austin when we get in and a little bit Saturday morning before the match. so it won't be a difficult adjustment outdoors," Bayliss said. "At least, I hope it won't." 
Irish players have been gain­ing recognition in singles. In addition to Helgeson, Stephen Bass is No. 14, Sheeva Parbhu is No. 34 and Ryan Keekley is No. 115. 
In doubles, Keckley is ranked with Erie Langenkamp at No. 36 and at No. 44 with Barry King. lie is now paired with Parbhu. but the duo is unranked. 
"lie and Sheeva give us a good chance to win at No. 1," said Bayliss, noting that it is unusual -but not unheard of -for one player to have multi­ple doubles rankings. 
This weekend's matches will he a good test for the Irish as they begin to dose out their season. The team has three matches remaining before the Big East Tournament begins on April 20. 
However, no one is overlook­ing the pair of Texas matches. 
"Texas is for real -they're a legit team," Bayliss said. "They beat Virginia and Duke. They're very good, and they beat Illinois, and A&M beat Illinois." 
The Irish take on the Longhorns at 1 p.m. in Austin and face the Aggies at 1:30 
p.m. in College Station.

MEN'S LACROSSE 
Irish hit road to face Pride 
Team ready to battle No. 5 Hofstra group 
By TIM DOUGHERTY Sports Writer 
The No. 11 Irish, tourna­ment hungry and standing 4­1 on the season, are always playing for more than pride. This weekend, Notre Dame will take that mentality to Hempstead, NY, where the team will face the No. 5 Hofstra Pride Saturday at 
1:30 p.m. 
Notre Dame enters the con­test carrying a three-game winning streak, including a 9-7 victory over then-No. 20 North Carolina. During that span, the Irish have lost the groundball battle in all three games, but their defense has out-cleared their opponents -a feat they have achieved in every game this year, with an .830 clear percentage compared to the .654 mark to which they have held their 
opponents.  
This  is  also  their  third  
straight game  away  from  
home.  

"It's always tough going on the road," senior eo-captain and midfielder Drew Peters said. "Going on the road to Hofstra to play a top-five team will be a challenge." 
Hofstra (4-1) enters the game on a four-game roll., most recently defeating then­No. 6 Princeton last Saturday to vault the Pride from No. 9 to their current spot in the top five. They also beat defending NCAA champions

and current No. 9 Johns Hopkins 11-6 earlier in the year. 
The Irish have narrowly missed a tournament invita­tion each of the past three years. In order to make it back to postseason play for the first time since 2001, the team realizes that a win against a top-ranked team is crucial. 
"We need to win a big game," Peters said. "If we get a big win over them, that'll get some momentum and set things up for the rest of the season. Everyone real­izes how big of a game this is." 
Last year, Notre Dame went on the road and defeated Hofstra 9-8 in double over­time. 
Senior attackman Pat Walsh was the hero of last season's game, assisting one goal and scoring six of his own, including the decisive tally with 1:55 left in the sec­ond overtime. If the Tewaaraton Trophy "Watch List" attackman is to post similar numbers Saturday, he must get past first-team All­American senior defenseman Brett Moyer, a fellow Tewaaraton nominee. 
Walsh will have help this year with the return of sen­ior attackman Brian Hubschmann, who missed all of last year due to injury but has been dominating this year. Ilubsehmann leads the Irish in scoring with 10 goals and seven assists. 
Walsh and Hubschmann are two of 11 Irish players returning for the only time this year to play in their 
home state and lacrosse 
hotbed of New York. 

After playing at Hofstra 
last year, Peters expects an 
ideal environment for 
lacrosse fans. 

"A lot of the guys have a lot of family that shows up," he said. "Hofstra is always a great place to play. They have a big stadium that draws 8,000 people for a big game. The whole place erupts when you seon~ a goal." 
Though the Irish controlled most of last year's contest. they almost let it slip away, allowing a late three-goal Pride run to send the game into its first overtime. Similar late game let-ups last week enabled North Carolina and Villanova to make 4-0 and 4­1 runs, respectively, to allow them back into those games. 
Hofstra's only common opponent with the Irish this year has been North Carolina. 
The Pride erased a 5-1 deficit against the Tarluwls to win 6-5 in the last two minutes of the game. 
The Irish entered last year's game in a similar posi­tion with Notre Dame 3-1, but following the win, they closed out the season 3-3 and barely missed a t<JUrna­ment invitation. 
"We had a good week at practice," Peters said. "Everyone is feeling confi­dent. We're goii)g to. play1 our game of lacrosse, and hope­fully, it will take care of itself."

Belles set for season opener vs. Engineers 

Observer File Photo 

Junior Laura Hellne scores a run during Saint Mary's 10-5 loss 
to Albion College last April. 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA 
Sports Writer 
The cold weather has kept the Belles inside for many practices this week, but it has not deterred them in preparing for their regular season opener Saturday at Rose-Hulman. Saint Mary's coach Elizabeth Sullivan, along with leading seniors Audrey Gajor and Bridget Grall, have kept the team working hard in the gym. 
"We have been trying to keep up with everything, continuing what we have been preparing all season," Gajor said. 
The Belles have focused on forming a strong all-around squad. 
"We are looking to build off how we did in Florida," Grall said. "A strong defense, a strong offense-both sides." 
Proving that they are a force to be reckoned with both at the plate ·and on the mound, the Belles will turn to offensive and defensive stalwarts like Laura Heline and Kristin Amram to better their odds against the Engineers. Heline went 3-3, hit­ting two home runs and driving in five runs during the Belles' 7-1 victory over Edgewood on March 13. Amram hurled a no­hitter against Defiance on March 15. 
Saint Mary's will have to turn in strong performances on both offense and defense at Rose Hulman, located in Terre Haute, Ind. 
The Engineers are 6-6 and currently No. 1 in fielding per­centage at .976 in the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference (SCAC). 
Rose-Hulman's sophomore trio of Katie Frey, Katie Yiznitsky and Katie Maggard head the Engineers on both fronts. Frey is hitting .400 with 17 RBis, Yiznitsky is batting .410 with 12 RBis and pitcher Maggard has 45 strikeouts in 
63.2 innings. 
The Belles last met the Engineers in 2004 for a double­header. They dropped both games, 4-1 and 4-3. 
However, the Belles are not concerned with their past per­formances.· 
"That was two years ago," said Gajor of the 2004 meeting. "We have a completely different team. We are prepared this time."

defenseman Meaghan Fitzpatrick said Coyrw has kept practices n~latNI t.o mistakPs from pre­vious ganws and has trim! to fix as many mental and phys­il:al Prrors as possibl1l. 
"Northwestern left us a lot of things to work on," l'itzpalrirk said. "Coach Coyrw has workPd on lark­ling all. of thosP things all over the fildd -dnfensn, rn i d f'i e I d . d i ffp r n n t k i n d s of attack -to hPip us improve from last game." 
This ll1eory of practicn has worked well so far this sea­son, loading llw Irish to a lop ranking in the Big East and a No. 17 ranking in the NCAA. Coyne's focus on her team has also helped them gain confidence. 
"Focusing on ourselves has been a very important aspect of our success this season," Fitzpatrick said. "We would mess things up that we might not have messed up other­wise if we focus too much on what the other team is going to do and not enough on what we need to do." 
But as much as Coyne and the Irish would like to stay 
focused on their own team, the Canisius game 
looms Saturday 
as the first test for Notre Dame after its only loss this season. 
"It's very important to play really well in this game after a dis­

"llopefully, we can rebound in the best possible way with a win." 
And Coyne has even bigger plans· for this season, includ­ing a trip deep into the post­SI~ason.

Manship, Thornton and Samardzija set to pitch in three-game series against Georgetown 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 
The big three in the Notre DamH pitching rotation ­J n f'f Manship, Jeff Samardzija and Tom Thornton -will hoist the rnsin hag in a throe-game serins with Georgetown this wenk1~nd in Bethesda, Md. 
The weekend series marks the opnning of' 2006 Big East conf'ernnen play for the Irish, who boast a 10-7 record on the year, all in non-eonf'nrnnce games. Georgetown holds a 10-12 reeord and will host the serins -as wnll as all of its home games -at Povich Finld. Povich Field is the home of the Bethesda Big Train, a Cal Hipken, Sr. Collegiate Baseball League team. 
Irish head eoach Paul Mainieri said he will not limit the workload of any of his three starters, other than thB 110-pitch ceiling he rarely allows any of his pitchers to exceed. 
"They're in midseason form, and their endurance is good," he said. "Within rea­son, we're going to let them go. We would watch pitch­er's counts closely, anyway."

Irish host Havvkeyes at the Eck 
By DAN TAPETILLO 
Sports Writer 

The undefeated No. 2 Irish return to the Eck Tennis Pavilion today to face the No. 39 Hawkeyes at 3 p.m. Notre Dame is heading back to the courts a week after going 4-0 over top 50 teams during spring break, including a win over then-No. 11 Texas on March 20. 
Last week, the Irish topped the Longhorns 7-0 and extended their winning streak against top-30 teams to nine. The Longhorns were runners-up in last year's NCAA Championship and the highest-ranked team ever to lose 7-0 to the Irish. 
However, despite its suc­cessful week against top com­petition and a 15-0 record to match the program's best start, Notre Dame is not look­ing past any teams. 
"We have gotten off to an incredible start this season. Everyone has been playing great tennis, especially against the top teams in the country like Duke and Texas," senior Kelly Nelson said. "But rankings don't

Laxers enter home stretch 
No. 10 Irish ready to take on Canisius after loss to No.1 Northwestern 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 
With the season half over, No. 10 Notre Dame (7-1) hopes to stay successful against Canisius (5-3) at home Saturday. 
The team played the biggest game of the season over spring break, a 21-12 loss to unanimous No. 1 Northwestern (6-0). Although the Irish lost the game by a wide margin, they still showed promise against a strong team, holding a 9-8 lead going into halftime. But poor per­formances in the second half -in which the Wildcats outscored Notre Dame 13-3 ­cost the game for the Irish.

Irish try to buck the Broncos in avvay gatne 
Team looks to recover from consecutive losses 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 

Notre Dame will take a short trip up to Kalamazoo, Mich. this weekend to take on the Broncos of Western Michigan. After consecutive one-run losses to top-1 0 teams, the Irish will look to pick up some momentum at Fran Ebert Field. 
"We really aren't too intim­idated by [Western Michigan]," freshman out­fielder Alexandra Koteheff said. "We aren't too worried about the game -we just need to play the way we can." 
The Broncos, although not quite the caliber of team Notre Dame has been play­ing during the past few weeks, will certainly force the team to play at its best if the Irish want to win. Western Michigan comes into Saturday's contests with a record of 10-5 after a pair of shutout victories over Loyola Chicago earlier this week. 
The Ramblers managed only three hits against Western Michigan in the two games, thanks to pitcher Krysten Shumaker's no-hit­ter in the second game. Shumaker (5-1) has been lights out all season on the mound, holding her oppo­nents to a batting average of .133.
