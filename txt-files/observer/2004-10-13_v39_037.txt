Students request absentee ballots 
By KATE GALES News Writer 
With today's technology, campus awareness groups and the availability of national programs such as Rock the Vote, getting an absentee ballot has never been easier -and Notre Dame students are taking advantage of the opportunity. 
The 2004 election is the first opportuni­ty that many students will have to vote for a president. With so many students coming from out of state, absentee ballots have become an issue that many are dealing with during the voter registration process. 
"I am registered to vote," junior Kevin Walsh said. "1 went through the Rock the Vote Web site back home, which is in Ohio." 
Walsh pointed out it was especially important for swing state voters to east

Campaigns recruit campus votes 
College students could play decisive role in election 
By ELIZABETH CHEFFERS 
News Writer 
With the memory of the 2000 presiden­tial election still fresh in students' minds, campaign organizers have put more effort into recruiting absentee voters this election year according to professors on campus. 
The two largest groups of absentee vot­ers are traditionally members of the mili­tary and college students. 
These two groups "can easily decide an election, especially in a swing state alone," said political science professor John Roos. 
Fellow political science professor Michael Zuckert agreed. 
"Both campaigns do seem to be paying more attention to the issue because of the Florida decision in 2000," Zuckert said. 
Political activists nationwide have been trying to find a remedy for apathy among young voters. Since 197 2, when the Constitution was amended to lower the voting age from 21 to 18, voter turnout among 18 to 24-year olds has steadily decreased. 
The amount of people voting has dropped 18 percent in the past 25 years. 
The procedures and deadlines sur­rounding absentee ballot information vary widely from state to state. 
According to Roos, different states have

Notre Dame Security/Police assistant director Chuck Hurley said five of the arrest~: were made outside the stadium in the park­ing lots before and during the game. Two students were taken into custody -one for minor in possession, false identification and resisting law enforce and the other for public intoxication, resisting law enforcement, minor in possession and possession of false identification, Hurley said.

With more and more young women being diagnosed with breast cancer, students at Saint Mary's and Notre Dame are becoming actively involved in educating others -and themselves -about breast cancer. 
According to the National Breast Cancer Awareness Month Web site (NBCAM), "2004 marks 20 years of progress for NBCAM, educat­ing women about breast can­cer detection, diagnosis and treatment." 
Saint Mary's hosted the annual Oktoberfest Oct. 7. 
This 2K walk and 5K run raised a record-high $2,400, nearly double the amount from last year. 
"One thing that kind of happened because of the event is that we now formed a partnership with a group called Young Survivors," Saint Mary's athletic director and head of Oktoberfest Lynn Kachmarik said. "This is a kind of off-shoot group. It's basically young survivors of breast cancer. I'm really excited about it." 
All the money raised from Oktoberfest now stays in South Bend or St. Joseph County, being put toward mammograms and cancer awareness education pro­
grams. 
"It's one thing when you raise millions of dollars to send nationally, but what you can donate to a local organization, like Young Survivors, it is more person­al," she said. "It just seems to be a natural partnership." 
Senior Nina Helman, who participated in the event, said she feels Sailnt Mary's is the perfect place for such an event. 
"As a women's college, breast cancer is one of the most important issues to support," said Helman. 
Kachmarik said for many students who participated in

INSIDE COLUMN 


Rape vvho? 
Hape seems to a word that many 
Notre Dame students throw around. ~· 
Haven't you heard the random student 
claimed to be "raped" by his or her lat­
est mid-term? 
Due to the fact that the University of 
Notre Dame and 
Saint Mary's Jeannine Prlvat 
College has one of 
the lowest rates of 
reported rapes on Wire Editor 
campuses in the 
nation, many stu­
dents may be able to ignore rape more 
easily than students at other campus­
es. But, this does not release students 
from having an obligation to admit that 
rape does, in fact, happen in our Notre 
Dame family, and that some women 
begin college already having been 
raped. 
In fact, after having to talked to a 
few girlfriends, AHs and rectresses 
over the year, I have discovered an 
uncommon amount of women on the 
Notrn Dame campus that have been 
raped or sexually assaulted. Our cam­
pus is not immune to the fact that one 
in four women are raped or sexually 
assaulted each year. 
While this problem mainly affects 
women, a small percentage of men are 
also taken advantage of, creating an 
uncomfortable confusing situation for 
them to be in. This is not to be under­
stood as my saying that it is more difTI­
cult for men who arc assaulted, merely 
dill'ernnt and confusing in a way that 
women, who are the majority of vic­
tims, do not have to experience. Both 
men and women have to deal with the 
exp1~riences of rape and sexual assault. 
Now. none of thP. above may be sur­prising to tlw mader. Hap1~ is not some rww phenommwn. And though I havP. always been personally disappointed in the avenues available to women raped or assaulted on campus, I had never experienced anything like I did this past Saturday. Standing in the senior student section during the football game against Stanford, I was quickly jarred from the game with a shout that came from a row or two above me. 
''I'm going to-expletive-rape your children," a senior male shouted, aft1~r a slightly disappointing play by our quarterback. I have grown accus­tomed to the genderized slurs but nothing has ever sent chills down my spine so quickly, shaking me to my core. 
I found myself standing in the middle of the senior section with silent tears streaming down my face. 
Some may say I'm overreacting to a harmless comment. -Is it harmless? I have no idea what the man that shouted it meant, but he shouted with such vehemence, that I can't discount his insult. I personally know too many women that have been raped or sexu­ally <L<>saulted not to lind this comment highly oll'ensive. 
As my class approaches graduation, I would hope that the University has help1~d us to gain a certain level of sen­sitivity to others. Be sensitive; the sur­vivors of rape and sexual assault don't walk around proclaiming what has happened to them. You can't know who has or hasn't been assaulted; so please drop the word rape from your vocabulary, unless you're talking about the physical, mental and emotional assault of forcing intercourse upon someone.

McDonald's "Golden Arches" will be absent from U.K. ads 
LONDON, England ­McDonald's is dropping the iconic "Golden Arches" logo from its advertising in Britain for the first time, the compa­ny has announced. 
The famous symbol will be replaced with a gold question mark in a poster campaign due to begin this week. 
The new advertisements are part of attempts by McDonald's to ditch its unhealthy "junk food" image and promote alter­native products. 
Posters will include close-up photographs of fresh salad, fruit pieces and a bagel smothered in cream cheese. 
Below the gold question mark. the advertisements read: "McDonald's. But not as you know it."

The impending action, first reported in Monday's edition of Television Week, is expected to be announced by the com­mission as early as this week. Fox officials declined comment, and FCC representatives could not be reached for com­ment Monday because of the Columbus Day holi­day.

The infamous Florida in 2000 debacle brought to the surface one possible complica­tion. Certain states do not open their absentee ballots until the polls are closed, which means that the results from that particular state could be delayed while they are counted by hand. 
Even more than the compli­cations of absentee ballot vot­ing, however, the close deci­sion in Florida showed stu­dents just how powerful an absentee ballot can ~e.

examine festival 
Associated Press SOUTH BEND -Officials 
are considering whether to 
continue holding an annual 
downtown festival that has 
been marred by vandalism 
and fights for two years. 
The city scaled back this June's Summer in the City from three days to one and eliminated carnival rides in hopes of curbing violence blamed on loitering teens. But the change cut deeply into festival revenues, Parks Superintendent Phil St. Clair said Monday. 
The city lost about $82,000 on the one-day event in Howard Park down­town. which cost a total of about $113,000, St. Clair said. 
Some $16,000 was used to pay police overtime to pro­vide security at closing time. he told City Council mem­bers. Installing new water lines for vendors cost anoth­er $15,000. 
"We went to a one-day venue knowing it would kill us financially, but there were some things we had to get under control," St. Clair said.

Germany extradites militant 
ISTANBUL, Turkey -An Islamic militant suspected of devising a 1998 plot to crash an explosives-laden plane into a major Turkish landmark was extradited from Germany on Tuesday. 
Muhammed Metin Kaplan will face treason charges in Turkey for allegedly trying to destroy the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. the founder of the secular Turkish state. 
Turkish authorities allege Kaplan plotted in October 1998 to smash an explosives-laden executive jet into Ataturk's mausoleum, which covers an entire hilltop in Ankara. 
The attack, officials say, was to happen when thousands of officers, students and for­eign dignitaries were visiting the site for a ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of the secular republic.

The operation lasted about an hour and Saddam was returned to his cell the same day, the sources said on condition of anonymity.

Texan executed for murder 
IIUNTSVILLE. Texas -An inmate convict­ed of abducting and killing a gay man 11 years ago was executed Tuesday, after apolo­gizing to his victim's family and his own. 
Donald Aldrich, who had admitted the kid­napping but denied taking part in the mur­der, asked forgiveness from Nicholas West's family, although no relatives were present. 
Before he was killed by injection, he also apologized to his own family and friends, saying, ''I'm sorry for the pain and hurt I have caused you." 
West, a medical clerk from Tyler, was robbed at a park known as a gay meeting place, then taken to a remote area where he was stripped, ordered to his knees and shot at least nine times. 
Aldrich, 39, was the second man executed for West's death. Henry Earl Dunn, 28, was put to death in February 2003. Each man blamed the other, but authorities contended both took part in killing West.

The quakes subsided as the new lava emerged and cooled in the open air, suggesting molten rock from deep inside the Earth had found the path of least resistance by going around the old dome, said Jon Major, a hydrol­ogist with the U.S. Geological Survey's Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash.

Ten Commandments go to court 
U. 5. Supreme Court decides to address constitutionality of biblical displays 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -The Supreme Court said Tuesday -it will consider whether the Ten Command­ments may be displayed on government property, end­ing a 25-year silence on a church-state issue that has prompted bitter legal fights around the country. 
Ten Commandments dis­plays are common in town squares and courthouses and on other government­owned land, including the Supreme Court. A wall carving of Moses holding the tablets is in the court­room where justices will hear arguments in the case. 
Courts around the coun­try have splintered over whether the exhibits violate the constitutional principle of separation of church and state. 
The disputes have led to emotional battles, such as one in Alabama by Chief Justice Roy Moore, who lost his job after defying a fed­eral order to remove a 5,300-pound monument from the state courthouse. The Supreme Court refused last week to help him get his job back. 
But the justices agreed to address the constitutionali­ty of displays in Kentucky and Texas.

United States seeks help in Afghanistan 
NATO asked to take over military mission 
Associated Press 
POIANA BRASOV, Romania 
-The United States is press­
ing NATO to take over the 
U.S.-led military mission in 
Afghanistan, possibly as early 
as 2005, the U.S. ambassador 
to the alliance said Tuesday. 
NATO currently commands the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul, the Afghan capital, and it has set up five Provincial Reconstruction Teams in northern Afghanistan. Its troops do not conduct combat missions as U.S. forces do. 
Nicholas Burns, the U.S. ambassador to the alliance, told American reporters trav­eling with Defense Secretary Donald II. Rumsfeld on Tuesday that the aim of the United States is to combine the U.S. and NATO missions under an alliance command­er. 
"There will be a lot of dis­cussion about that tomorrow, but no decisions," Burns said, referring to Wednesday's NATO defense ministers meeting. 
"It's a very complicated issue, how you put these two very different military mis­sions together." Burns said. "But there will be a number of people who will support ­we will certainly support -a direction to the military lead­ers of the alliancP. to go and look at this question and decide how we can best do that-give us a sense of how you put these two missions togethPr." 
Burns said he expects the alliance's military leaders to present answers at a planned February meeting of defense ministers in Nice, France. 

He said integration of the 
forces could happen by 2005 
or 2006. 
The ambassador also said 
the United States is pressing 
NATO's newer members who 
once were part of the Soviet 
bloc, like Romania, to donate 
older Soviet-era military 
equipment that is urgently 
needed to equip Iraqi forces. 
In the shorter term, the 
United States is pushing its 
NATO allies to accelerate the 
deployment of extra peace­
keepers to Afghanistan. 
Ahead of two days of talks beginning Wednesday, U.S. officials said they were seek­ing commitments that the alliance would expand its peacekeeping operation into western Afghanistan. which would free up U.S. troops to ·hunt Taliban and al-Qaida remnants hiding out in the 
south and east 
"NATO is behind. We should 
have been in the west by now, 
and we're not," Burns told 
reporters earlier at NATO 
headquarters in Brussels, 
Belgium. "NATO ... needs to 
move faster, with a greater 
degree of commitment and 
political will." 
After much prodding, NATO allies reinforced their peace­keeping mission from 6,500 troops to over 9,000 for the Afghan elections held at the weekend. 
Despite that temporary deployment. the alliance is slipping behind with plans to expand its longer-term peace­keeping operation into the troubled western provinces from its bases in the Afghan capital, Kabul, and five north­ern cities.

U.S. Marine Sgt. ne-w father of 5 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -As Marine Sgt. Joshua Horton lay in a hospital bed across the ocean recovering from wounds he suffered in Iraq, his wife was in a maternity ward in suburban Illinois, mak­ing him a father five times over. 
Horton knew his wife was expecting quintuplets, but decided it was his duty to go to Iraq last month with Marines he helped train -even if it meant leaving his wife and two chil­dren behind. 
"He was taking them into combat for the first time. He wanted to get them there safely and return," said Dean Fisher, the bishop of Horton's church in Oswego, a Chicago suburb. 
On Tuesday, a day after his wife Taunacy gave birth to three girls and two boys, !lorton was back in the United States, but not with his family. lie was transported from a hospital in Germany to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. 

A Marine spokesman said Horton, 28, is expected to recover but was so heavily sedated that he probably was not yet aware he is a father again.

IN BRIEF 
Medtronic ordered to pay $400M 
MEMPHIS, Tenn. -A federal jury awarded $400 million in punitive damages Tuesday to a doctor who accused a medical technology company of infringing on his patents for a surgical device to treat spinal injuries. 
The punitive damages against Medtronic Inc. are in addition to $110 million in com­pensatory damages the Fridley, Minn., com­pany was ordered last month to pay surgeon Gary Michelson. 
Medtronic called the award "unjustified and excessive" and said it will appeal. 
The jury said a company subsidiary, Medtronic Sofamor Danek Inc. of Memphis, breached agreements with Michelson to pro­duce and sell implants he invented to treat patients suffering from damaged or diseased spinal discs. 
The devices are small metal cages that are inserted between vertebrae. 
The total damages could be increased by $60 million since the verdict includes a per­centage of the income Medtronic received from selling the devices. 
Kroger resumes negotiations 
CINCINNATI -Representatives of Kroger Co. and the union representing 8,500 workers at 70 Kroger stores in three states resumed negotiations Tuesday at the request of an arbi­trator a day after the union revoked a contract extension with the company. 
Leaders of Local 1099 of the United Food & Commercial Workers had said Monday they would recommend members reject Kroger's latest contract offer in a union vote Wednesday and authorize the union to strike, if necessary. 
Cashiers, grocery baggers and clerks in meat. produce and delicatessen departments at 70 stores in the Cincinnati area, northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana are cov­ered by the contract. 
The union's move to revoke the contract extension Monday night meant that its current contract would expire about 10 p.m. Friday, union spokesman John Marrone said. 
The union and Cincinnati-based Kroger ear­lier had agreed to indefinitely extend the cur­rent contract, which was set to expire this p!J.St Saturday, at the urging of the federal mediator. 


Russian oil fight nears resolution 
Justice Ministry files to sell part of giant Yukos in an attempt to end dispute 
Associated Press 

MOSCOW -The year­long, politically charged legal campaign against oil giant Yukos appeared to move nearer to a resolu­tion Tuesday as the Justice Ministry filed to sell part of a key production sub­sidiary to pay a portion of a mounting bill for back taxes. 
Yukos, whose jailed ex­CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky irritated the Kremlin by funding opposition political parties, has been hit with tax claims exceeding $7 billion for 2001-2001 and additional bills for 2002­2003 are expected. 
The Justice Ministry moved Tuesday to sell an unspecified part of Yukos' subsidiary Yuganskne­ftegaz to meet some of the tax bill. Yukos is struggling to pay off the bills despite a claimed shortage of ready cash, but Russian officials say the payments are going too slowly. No timetable was set for the sale. 
Yukos shares, which have plummeted by some 70 percent since Khodork­ovsky's arrest last October, fell another 4.5 percent Tuesday on Moscow's RTS exchange.

NHL 
leers set to :tniss start of the regular season 
League has been shut down since CBA expired on Sept. 17 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -The Tampa Bay Lightning were supposed to raise their Stanley Cup champi­onship banner this week to kick off the new season. 
Instead, the arena that rocked during the finals in June will be dark because of a labor dispute that shows no sign of ending soon. That will be the case, too. for Ottawa, Chicago, Colorado, Phoenix, Anaheim 
.__ and San Jose, also slated to host openers Wednesday night. The NHL has been shut down for nearly a month following the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement. The league and the players associa­tion are so far apart philosophi­cally that they haven't met or even spoken since Sept. 9 -a week before the decade-old deal ran out. "I don't think anybody is happy that we're in the situa­tion we're in," said Bill Daly, the NHL's chief legal officer. "I think everybody would much rather be playing hockey." Training camps didn't open on time and then the entire preseason schedule was wiped out. Now, real games are about to be officially lost. And with 
played, they really are being called off a month in advance. The league is leaving the can­cellation of games up to clubs that have been given permis­sion to release arena dates on a 30-day rolling basis. 
"It's not something that comes as a surprise," Saskin said. "We all knew there would not be an opening night on Oct. 13." 
So there is no hope of any games being played in October, and November's schedule is quickly being lost, too. Even the most optimistic observers say that there won't be any NHL hockey before January. 
It is then that the league and the players association will face a deadline: make a deal, or try again in the fall to save the 2005-06 season. 
"I don't think it's currently our intention to reach out," Daly said: "Until they're talking about partnership, until they're willing to acknowledge our issues and address them in a meaningful way, I'm not sure what point there is in talking." 
The last lockout that inter­rupted the 1994-95 season, lasted 103 days and was settled in time to have a truncated 48­game schedule. That deal held in place ever since, having been renewed twice. 
But the NHL says it can't sur­vive under those terms any­more and is in need of "cost certainty" to stay afloat. 
The  NHLPA  agrees  that

pointed but not surprised the 2004-05 season will not start on time," NHLPA senior director Ted Saskin said Tuesday. "The league's decision to lock out the players to try to force them to accept a salary cap system had been planned for many years." 
The Lightning were supposed to enjoy one of the biggest nights in the history of the 12­year-old team that unexpected­ly won the Stanley Cup last sea­son in a thrilling seven-game series over Calgary. 
Before a rematch Wednesday with the Philadelphia Flyers, the team the Lightning van­quished in the Eastern Conference finals. the champi­onship was supposed to be cel­ebrated again. 
That won't happen now. 

"Our fans lived through some great memories with our team last season and we intend on rekindling those memories just as soon as the work stoppage is over," Lightning president Ron Campbell said Tuesday. 
Instead of being something special Wednesday night, it will just be one of seven games wiped out. 
"It is definitely emblematic of some short-term pains for the Lightning and our fans, but we know the work stoppage will bring good times for our organ­ization over the long term," Campbell said. 
Although the NHL won't offi­cially cancel games until the day they are supposed to be 
proposed a 
luxury cap 

system, a plan the NHL says won't solve the problems. 
"The league's ongoing refusal to explore any compromise solutions makes it clear they have no interest in seeing any NHL games played unless they get a cap," Saskin said. 
Thus there is a standoff that doesn't seem to offer any sort of middle ground, leaving hock­ey fans, players, coaches, and support staff in limbo. 
So far, 202 players -over a quarter of those in the NHL ­have signed to play in European leagues while the dispute rages on. Most have conditions in their new con­tracts to allow them to return to the NHL if the lockout ends during the season. 
But this week they will miss their first NHL paychecks. 
"Hockey players ... this is what guys do for a living," Saskin said. 
"It's important for many of them to stay in shape and look for an opportunity to play hock­ey somewhere." 
Daly doesn't feel that will force the league back to the bargaining table. 
"It's not a real alternative to the National Hockey League both in terms of compensation and visibility," he said. "I think everybody would rather be playing in the National Hockey League for hundreds of thou­sands of dollars more than they're making overseas,"

Cincinnati will not bring back Larkin 
Reds will replace their shortstop with several unproven youngsters 
Associated Press 
CINCINNATI -Barry Larkin's stellar 19-year career with his hometown team ended Tuesday with a one-sided phone call. 
The Cincinnati Reds informed their captain they aren't interest­ed in keeping him around for another season. Instead, the Reds will replace the 40-year-old short­stop with two unproven young­sters. 
Larkin was at his home in Orlando, Fla., when general man­ager Dan O'Brien and manager Dave Miley -a former teammate -called with the decision. 
"It wasn't pleasant," Larkin told The Associated Press in a phone interview. "But it is what it is. It's definitely disappointing. I have decisions to make." 
Larkin's 19 seasons with one team was the longest current streak in the majors. He had hoped for a 20th and was willing to discuss returning in a utility role, but the Reds ruled it out. 
"You hate to say goodbye to the great players, but the process of the game is ultimately, all great careers do eventually end," O'Brien said. 
Larkin isn't sure whether his career is over. He hasn't decided whether to try to play one more season with another team, ending his career in a different uniform. 
"I have to see what opportuni­ties present themselves, if there's anything that makes sense," he said. 
Larkin grew up in Cincinnati and spent his entire career with the Reds, developing into one of the most prominent players in their illustrious history. He helped the team win a World Series in 1990 and won the NL's Most Valuable Player award in 1995, the last time the Reds made the playoffs. 
He also was a steadying influ­ence in the clubhouse during the 1990s, when former owner Marge Schott put the franchise in the national spotlight for her inflammatory comments. 
Injuries have limited him in recent years, and he decided to make the 2004 season his last. But a good season -he hit .289 and made the All-Star team ­prompted him to reconsider and ask for one more contract. 
Larkin was willing to discuss a role as a backup infielder with the Reds in which he would work to develop the young shortstops. He then hoped to move into the front office in some capacity. 

Bonds has successful 
knee surgery Tuesday 


Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO -Barry Bonds underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee Tuesday and is expected to be at full strength when the San Francisco Giants open spring training in February. 
The slugger underwent a 20­minute arthritis cleanup proce­dure performed by San Jose Sharks team physician Dr. Art Ting at the Fremont Surgery Center. 
Bonds, 40, told the team he first felt pain Oct. 4, the day after the season ended, and he didn't want the injury to affect his offseason training. 
Giants trainer Stan Conte said it would take three to six weeks for Bonds to rehabilitate the knee and he should be able to resume working out in November. 
"It's very typical of a postsea­son cleanup procedure done in football at times," Conte said. "His cartilage inside the knee was perfect. This was simple wear and tear that was an irri­tant to him. What really precipi­tated doing this now is he rl;-' not want this to interfere ' his workout program November." 
Bonds finished his 19th major league season with 703 career homers, pulling him within 11 of Babe Ruth for second place. He could pass Ruth's mark early next season and then turn his focus on Hank Aaron's record of 755. 
Bonds had 45 homers and 101 RBis this season and also walked a major league-record 232 times. He demonstrated his durability, playing in 147 games after playing only 130 last year, when he dealt with the death of his father. The Giants were in the playoff race until the final day of the season and finished one game behind Houston in the NL wild-card standings. 
"In a perfect world, would I love to see Barry get more days off? Probably early in the season would be a good idea," Conte said. "But that probably is not necessary. He played [147] games and did pretty well from a medical standpoint." 
Conte said Bonds' knee shows much Jess wear and tear than would be expected from a 40­year-old who has played 2,716 games in his career. He said he didn't know if the knee affected Bonds' play the final week of the season when he went 1-for-13. 
"You would have to ask him," Conte said. "He told me he was feeling it a little bit but it was not a big deal. The day after the season it started bothering him a bit. He didn't indicate to me it was an issue at all during the season." 
Bonds led the National League with a .362 average and .812 slugging percentage this season. He also set a major league record with a .609 on-base per­centage. 
Last month, the Giants decided to drop their right to void the final year of Bonds' contract, keeping him with the team through 2006. 
Under the $90 million, five­year deal agreed to in January 2002, San Francisco could have voided the 2006 season if Bonds failed to reach 400 plate appear­ances next season.

Neither Clen1ens nor Osvvalt vvill start Gan1e 1 of NLCS 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS -In Roger Clemens and Roy Oswalt, the Houston Astros have one of the best pitching tandems in all of base­ball. 
Only one problem going into the NL championship series: With no time to rest, those guys have been aced out of starting the first two games against the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Instead, Houston hopes Brandon Backe can shut down the likes of Albert Pujols, Scott Rolen and Jim Edmonds in the opener Wednesday night at Busch Stadium. Then, Pete Munro gets the ball for Game 2. 
Backe, a converted outfielder from the Tampa Bay system, and Munro, cut by Minnesota in June. began the season in the minors. Together, they combined for nine wins in the majors. 
"We don't feel handicapped in any way whatsoever." Astros manager Phil Garner said Tuesday. "This is what it took for us to get here. This is what we'll go with." 
Garner leaned on his two aces to get the Astros through the first round of the playoffs. Both pitched on three days' rest, with Oswalt winning the decisive Game 5 in Atlanta on Monday night. 
Clemens and Oswalt each went 2-0 against the Cardinals this year. Now, they're pushed back to pitching over the weekend in Houston -not that St. Louis manager Tony La Russa is relax­ing. 

"We're not going to fall into the trap tomorrow, because Clemens or Oswalt)s not pitch­ing, that we've got some big advantage," he said. "They'll have a legitimate starting pitch­er, a legitimate bullpen, a legiti­mate club behind them." 
Still, St. Louis slugger Larry Walker was a little curious, especially about Munro. With batting practice wiped out by rain, the Cardinals were talking, and were certain Munro was starting the opener. 
"I just know he's pitching the first game." Walker said. "I don't even know if I ever have faced him, really." 
Walker had, going 1-for-3 with a double. 
Coming off the first playoff series victory in their 43-season history, the wild-card Astros take on the team that led the majors with 105 victories. Backe will start on three days' rest for the first time in his career, opposed by Woody Williams, who grew up in Houston. 
''I've always been an Astro fan. It's a team I always rooted for my whole life," Williams said. "Now I have an opportunity to be the one that sends them home on a sour note. It's kind of bittersweet for me." 
For his family, too. "I have left tickets for one of my family member's brother 
before. He's sitting there cheer­ing for the Astros," he said. "So next time, I put him way up at the top. That was when I was pitching." 
Chances are the matchup between NL Central opponents will not generate the kind of heat the Red Sox-Yankees rival­ry produces in the ALCS. Even though Backe contends "we've had some words exchanged every now and then," these clubs keep it pretty civil. 
"Ever since I've been in the league, we really had terrific competitions," La Russa said. "I think we're two hot clubs, two confident clubs." 
The one squabble they had came early in April 2002, when the Astros arrived at Busch Stadium and saw a sign that proclaimed the Cardinals co­champions of the Central Division. 
Both teams went 93-69 the previous year, but Houston won the season series 9-8 and the Cardinals were the wild-card team in the playoffs. 
The Astros finished 10-8 against the Cardinals this sea­son, with Houston sweeping a three-game series at home in late September. Backe got one of those key wins, part of a 5-3 season when he didn't reach the rotation until August. 
Backe won Game 3 against the Braves, throwing six effective innings. Munro finished 4-7 and has not pitched since Oct. 1.

ic countertenor Jochen Kowalski. 
Featured star Christopher O'Hiley has also enjoyed a musical career that matches the brilliance of Sillito's. He boasts a keyboard repertoire that ranges from the English Renaissance to newer works written by today's leading composers. O'Riley is also renowned for the work he has done in arranging music. In 2003 he recorded the CD "True Love Waits," which is composed of original transcriptions of songs from the English group Hadiohead. He has also released tran­scriptions on works from Stravinsky, such as selections from the famous ballet "Petrouchka," and has also released CDs consisting of piano works by Maurice Ravel and several of Beethoven's Piano Sonatas. O'Riley's touring ventures have taken him to London, Paris, Vienna, Hong Kong and Melbourne, along with many other global cultural capitals. 
The program for the concert consists of a wide variety of works. It opens with Dmitri Shostakovich's "Chamber Symphony for Strings." O'Riley will then make his first appearance of the night in Mozart's "Concerto No. 12 in A Major for Piano and Orchestra." After intermission, ()'Hiley will again be featured in Franz Liszt's "Malediction for Piano and Strings," and the evening concludes with Pyotr Tchaikovsky's "Serenade for Strings in C Major."

STORY BY 
I 
f you're looking to learn a little more about fado, you might 
want to check out the 
Browning Cinema on Thursday, when the PAC will be presenting the prominent Portuguese documentary film "The Art of Amalia." 
Director Bruno de Almeida's 2000 lilm chronicles the life of leg­endary fado singer Amalia Rodrigues. 
Fado, largely considered to be the oldest form of urban folk music in the world, is a style that origi­nated in Portugal in the early 20th century. Difficult to put into words, !'ado can be described as consisting of the central themes of destiny, betrayal in love and despair. A single person, accompa­nied by one Portuguese guitar and one classical guitar, usually sings it. A large part of the performance 

Portuguese fado singer 
ELIZABETH 
is in the gestures and facial expressions of the singer. 
Because of her immense popu­larity and her tremendous ability to evoke emotion in the audience, Amalia Hodrigues is considered to be the undisputed diva of fado music. Born in 1920, she gained popularity as a teenager, and by 1940, she ruled the style. She expanded her career into acting on stage and screen, twice winning the Portuguese Best Actress. 
"The Art of Amalia" is comprised of a series oI' interviews w-ith Hodrigues and a few of her elose friends. In one interview, Hodrigues revealed, possibly, why the fado style was so appropriate for her; she admitted to never being truly happy in her life, despite her fame and fortune. Through the film, one gets a glimpse into the fado style and this extraordinary woman's talent, as

well as her life, which seemed to personify the music she performed so beautil'ully. 
She died in 1999, one week bel'ore this film was completed. Upon hor death, the prime minis­ter ol' Portugal called for three days of national mourning. Widely inl'luential in hnr home country, Hodriques remains largely unknown to U.S. audinnees. "The Art of Amalia" provides an oppor­tunity l'or us to experience somn­thing unique and outsidn our own range of knowledge. 
The film plays Oct. 14 at 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. in the Browning Cinema of the PAC. Tickets go on sale Ocl. 11 and are $(, l'or the public, $5 for Notre Dame, St. Mary's or lloly Cross Stal'l' and $3 l'or all students.

icant that wn could not even  

gtwss-could prove to have more impact than 
tlw debate. 
But tlw potential impact of this third of three debat1~s looms large. Tho stakes are high in a race now so clost~. 
Tlw lirst d1~bate is what put Sen . .John Kerry back in the race. After the Hepublican National Convtmtion. Bush enjoyed a bounce in the polls. inr.luding in the battleground states with the d!)ctoral votes for victory. 
Kerry seenwd unable even to defend his role as a decorated hero in Vietnam. 
Bush was deemed likeable and decisive by the middle ground of voters who will decide the election in those key statns. Kerry was not com­ing across as likeable or dncisive. Even many voters who don't really want Bush for a second tnrm were concluding that Kerry perhaps was not the better choice. 
Kerry won the first debate. Almost everyone agn~ns. even all four of the panelists on one of llw Fox News programs that night. Kerry came across as thinkable. not unthinkable. as an alternative to Bush. The prnsident. strangely. abandoned the style that made him so likeable in his acceptance sp1)ech and instead was pee­vish. 
Thus. Kerry got the bounce in the polls after the debate. almost into a tic nationally and, most importantly, in the battlegrounds. 
The second debate was a tic. Yes. partisans on each side claim1~d victory, each citing some poll or focus group. After dispensing with the spin­ning. it can be concluded that it was a tic. 
A tie. however, is more of a plus for Kerry than for Bush. Expectations are higher for the !'resident of the United States than for the chal­lenger, especially one who had been portrayed rath1~r effectively by the Bush campaign as like­ly to !lip and certainly to !lop. The longer Kerry holds his own with Bush. the more he will be vit)wed as able to hold the office. 
Stakes are very high for the president in this dt~bate. If he is perceived as a loser, his chances of n~-election will diminish. Could hfl really lose two of the three debates and tie the other and still go on to win? Possibly. 
Probably not. however, unlnss one of those monumental future events comes along to save 
him. 

Stakes are just as high for Kerry. What if 
Kerry is perceived as the loser. maybe blunder­
ing into some reinforcement of a flip-flop 
image? Kerry's momentum would be lost. The 
president could be back to the lead he had 
before the first debate. 
A tie? Again, that would help Kerry, at least 
enough to send the race on toward Nov. 2 with 
the electorate as evenly split as in 2000. 
The worst mistake President Bush could make 
tonight would be to follow in the stumbling foot­
steps of AI Gore toward the debacle Gore expe­
rienced in losing the debate5 and finally the 
presidency to Bush four years ago. A different 
Gore appeared each time. In the first debate, 
there was the sighing and insufferable Gore. 
Then came the overly passive Gore of the sec­
ond debate. Third, too late, there was what 
might have been the real Gore. 
The president certainly can't go back to the scowling Bush of the first de bate. But he better not stray much from the assertive Bush of the second debate. After all, tha·; style at least brought a tic. If he becomes a third Bush, say, a bombastic Bush, he could suffer the same fate as Gore. 
The worst mistake Kerry could make would be to go back to tortured rhEtoric that plagued him earlier. Voters don't want to hear him mus­ing and sorting through alternatives. They want him to be clear about what a.lternatives he offers and why, simply stated. 
Kerry also must be careful not to get too cute with a quip or too harsh with an allegation in a way that could come across to the undecided voters as improper in reference to the President of the United States. 
For those wishing to evalu 'l.te the effect of the debate tonight, here is a reminder: 
If you, like most American:;, already have picked a choice, don't get ca-ried away with enthusiasm for red-meat lin1~s of your candi­date. Those lines may help to solidify the base, but they also could turn off the very voters who must be swayed for victory. 
Also, don't miss it. This debate could be deci­sive.

A tale of two 

VISIOnS 
When people ask me how I manage to write a column in the 
midst of midterm madness, I find myself quoting my president: 
"It's hard work." In the first presidential debate, President 
George W. Bush used the phrase "hard work" 13 times in an 
appeal to the American ethos. Yet. the effects of this debate 
"strategery" were null as Massachusetts 
Sen. John Kerry ran away with the first Peter Quaranto 
presidential vaudevillian drama. Today, 
according to most polls, Election 2004 could A Call to Action 
not be closer. As we approach tonight's final 
presidential debate, I feel a personal obliga­
tion to use this, my last pre-Nov. 2 column to weigh in one final 
time on the most important election of our lives. 
On the surface, tonight's debate can most likely be summed up 
in four words: more of the same. President Bush will persist 
with his simpleton tactics, accentuating loaded words, such as 
"freedom" and "ownership" to touch the American soul. Kerry 
will continue to look lubberly and lumpish. while maintaining 
his disparagement of Bush for every problem in the United 
States. Both candidates will throw around accusations. rhetoric 
and values knowing that the average American will not check 
FactCheck.org post-debate. However, it is 'a grave oversight to 
allow such a surface-level discourse to dictate our voting con­
sciousness in 2004. 
To make a quick digression. do you ever wonder what the can­
didates say to each other when they shake hands at the center 
of the stage during the introductions of the debate? I find this 
part to be the most amusing of the whole spectacle as the two 
men shake hands and exchange derisive sneers. I picture Kerry, 
like Ivan Drago in Hocky IV, staring down at Dubya, uttering, "I 
will break you." And then Dubya, like John Wayne in the classic 
Western Rio Bravo. retorting, "Sorry. don't get it done. dude." 
On that note, you have to admit that it would be so cool if Bush 
wore a cowboy hat in the debates. 
Heturning to the gravity of the moment, Americans, in this age 
of the 30-second television spot, are increasingly voting on can­
didates' television performances. It has become more important 
that a candidate come across as trustworthy, consistent and 
strong than that they project an agenda that is right for the 
country. Policy has taken a backseat to image. As a result of this 
modern electoral hoopla, we fail to recognize that Election 2004 
has truly become home to a tale of two visions for the future of 
America in the 21st Century. 
Bush and Kerry, though both have changed their views (a.k.a. 
flip-flopped) on certain occasions, are both actually quite clear 
on where they want to take the country. For a long time, I have 
argued that the two parties in America were essentially the 
same, propagating trivial differences. In 2004, my beliefs about 
U.S. politics have been transformed as party differences have been elucidated in times of contingency. 
Recognizing these contrasting visions, the challenge is then to 
apply them to our particular historical moment. It is here"that 
serious deficiencies in the Bush vision become !;lear. While Bush 
claims he would not change anything about the U.S. war effort 
in Iraq, the situation in Baghdad, Fallujah and Najaf continues 
to deteriorate. While Bush speaks of an economy growing 
"stronger and stronger." his presidency was the first since 
Herbert Hoover to see a decline in payroll employment. While 
Bush claims no liability for enormous tax deficits, it is clear from 
research by the Congressional Budget Office that his tax cuts are 
primarily responsible. While Bush speaks of successes in educa­
tion, healthcare and employment, his words again and again 
neglect obvious reality. 
Applying the socio-economic realities to the Kerry agenda. it is not certain that Kerry's policy platforms will solve all the cur­rent problems; however, it is apparent that the Kerry-Edwards administration is willing to face these realities. while thinking hard about leading the United States in the right direction. Throughout the campaign, the Kerry camp has shown its will­ingness to face the realities on the ground in Iraq and on the ground in American cities. Kerry and Edwards are sincerely interested in asking the right questions about why al-Qaeda ranks have swelled, why anti-Americanism is at an all-time high, why over 30 million Americans live below the poverty line and why more than 45 million Americans go without health insurance. 
Charles Dickens' words of 1859 ring true in 2004: "It was the best of times; it was the worst of times." Today, we stand in the midst of a tale of two visions of shaping such times for the United States of America in the 21st Century. We cannot settle for the hollow, paltry debates to shape our understanding of this election or even our times; rather, we must strive to evaluate the divergent visions. For on Nov. 2, you and I will hold the power to determine which of those visiuns will guide the United States of America for the next four years and beyond. It is most definitely hard work. but as Bruce Springsteen so truthfully says, "The country we carry in our hearts is waiting." We can wait no longer.

WASIIINGTON -Television advertising by President Bush and Sen. John Kerry and their political parties is focused on 14 states. n~llecting a shrunken battleground in the final month or the presidential campaign.

Crawford rallies behind Bush

CHAWFOB I>. T1~xas -Signs at the bank, tlw cafe and the Bottlinger Grain bins all declare Crawford -the proud home of the president's ranch-as "Bush Country." 
So when the Lone Star Iconoclast, a tiny weekly that bills itself as Bush's hometown paper. endorsed Democrat John Kerry, there was lwll to pay. 
Local businesses pulled their ads and banned the papr.r from their stores. 
"We felt a little betrayed," said Larry N1dson. manager of the Crawford Country Style, a downtown shop that sells "Luvya Dubya" trinkets and other Bush memorabil­ia.

SANTA FE, N.M. -President Clinton can't put his r·ecovering heart into John Kerry's election d'f'ort out on the campaign trail, but he is using his voice to help in the final weeks of the race. 
Clinton regularly phones Kerry and his aides to otTer advice, and he plans to tape a phone message that will be sent into voters' honws. Campaign officials say it's likely he'll also record radio advertisements. but his slow recovery from heart surgery is making it questionable whether he'll be able to do any physical campaigning. 
Dmnocrats who have spoken to Clinton say lw is eager to get more involved. but his doc­tors and his wife are not sure he is strong enough to travel five weeks after he under­went quadruple bypass surgery. 
Candidates prep for last debate 
Bush taunts Kerry; Cheney, Edwards forge ahead on campaign trail 

Associated Press 

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -President Bush taunted Democratic rival John Kerry and tested debate lines before friendly audiences in Colorado and Arizona on Tuesday while Kerry crammed in private for Wednesday night's final faceoff of the campaign. 
Three weeks before the election, the running mates were running hard, too. Vice President Dick Cheney defended anew the invasion of Iraq, but Sen. John Edwards said Bush and Cheney had made a mess of the war and were "out of touch with what's happening in the real world." 
Kerry prepared at a Santa Fe, N.M., hotel for his third televised confrontation with Bush, scheduled for 9 p.m. EDT in Tempe. Ariz.. but he did take time during the afternoon for a bike ride. Bush met with political advisers and his debate sparring partner, Sen. Judd Gregg,H-N.H. 
At a rally in Colorado Springs, Bush mocked Kerry's credibility and said the debates so far "have highlighted the clear differ­ences between the senator and me on issues ranging 
from jobs to taxes to health 
care to the war on terror." 
Again and again he 
repeated what has become a 
favorite refrain: Kerry "can 
run but he cannot hide" 
from his record. 
Bush won the Rocky Mountain state by more than 8 percentage points in 2000, but Colorado has shown signs it could tilt either way this year. 
While the president spoke in Colorado Springs, which went his way four years ago in the southern part of the state, Edwards campaigned in Commerce City, just northwest of Denver. 
The North Carolina Democrat contended that Bush was out of touch with important issues including health care and the econo­my, including jobs lost to other nations. 
'Til tell you what would be good for the economy, would be to outsource George Bush," he said. 
On the stump and in an interview with AP Hadio, Edwards criticized adminis­tration decisions regarding Iraq. He cited U.S. deaths that have topped 1 ,000, and he said the country had become a magnet for terror­ists. 
But Cheney, campaigning in Iowa, said that under 
Saddam Hussein the country 
probably would have served 
as a source of weapons for 
terrorists. 
"The situation we faced 
was Saddam Hussein and 
Iraq presented the most 
likely place where there 
could be a nexus between 
the terrorists on the one 
hand and weapons of mass 
destruction," Cheney said. 
The chief U.S. weapons inspector in Iraq said Oct. 6 that he had concluded that Saddam's Iraq had produced no weapons of mass destruction after 1991 and that Iraq's ability to develop such weapons had weak­ened over years of U.N. sanctions. However, Charles Duelfer, head of the Iraq Survey Group, said Saddam remained a threat and hoped to revive his weapons program if the United Nations lifted sanctions. 
Bush was introduced at a campaign rally by his daughter Jenna, who read from a prepared statement that delighted the presi­dent's audience in Colorado Springs. 
"He has brought to our family the same values he's brought to this country: strength, compassion and integrity," she said, as her father stood blinking at her side with a slight smile, his hands clasped before him. 
For Bush, Wednesday's debate is a chance to revive in public opinion polls as the clock ticks down to Election Day. His job-approval rating slumped to 47 percent in a USA Today-CNN-Gallup poll published Tuesday -one point above the lowest point in his presidency, reached in May. 
Bush's rally was invita­tion-only. About 100 demon­strators gathered outside, many carrying signs protest­ing the Iraq war. "Fear more years," read one sign. "Bush's war: how many lives per gallon?" said another. 
Later Tuesday. the presi­dent spoke at a fund-raiser near Phoenix, dubbing Kerry yet again as "the most liberal member of the United States Senate" and saying he could not run from his record. 
Some Democrats have expressed concern that Kerry was spending time preparing for the debates while Bush was out tearing him down. While it is true that Kerry has stayed out of the public eye before each of the debates, there have been several days during the past two weeks when Kerry's campaign schedule has been more ambitious than Bush's.

NEW YORK -Mariano Rivera showed up just in time to save the New York Yankees. 
Shortly after jetting back from a funeral for relatives in Panama, baseball's greatest closer stopped the surging Boston Red Sox, who had cut an eight-run deficit to one. 
Rivera got Kevin Millar to pop out to strand the tying run at third base in the eighth inning, then finished out a thrilling 10·7 win for the Yankees in Tuesday night's opener of the AL championship series.

IN BRIEF 

Thrashers owner fined 
$250,000 by NHL 
NEW YORK -The NHL fined one of the owners of the Atlanta Thrashers $250,000 on Tuesday for saying the league would use replace­ment players next year if a new col­lective bargaining agreement isn't reached, The Associated Press has learned. 
Steve Belkin, a member of Atlanta Spirit, LLC -the group that bought the Thrashers earlier this year ­was given the hefty fine for com­ments he made over the weekend to the Boston Herald, said an official within the league speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
"I deeply regret the comments I made to the Boston Herald, which were my personal, uninformed views, and not those of the Atlanta Thrashers' ownership and manage­ment -nor those of the National Hockey League," Belkin said in a statement. 
Belkin, a Weston, Mass., business-ALCS record with five RBis, four off Curt Schilling, Mike Mussina was perfect through six innings before Mark Bellhorn doubled on a drive that hit the left­field wall on a hop with one out in the seventh and Bernie Williams drove in three runs, including a two-run double in the eighth that gave Rivera some breathing room. 
For much of the night it seemed like a Iaugher, with the Yankees ahead 6-0 by the third and 8-0 in the sixth. But after Bellhorn's hit on Mussina's 86th pitch, the stubbly faced pitcher's huge curveball quickly became hittable.

future with Pacers 
INDIANAPOLIS -Randy Holcomb knows his future with the Indiana Pacers is uncertain. He also knows that making game-winning baskets won't hurt his chances to make the team. 
The free agent helped Indiana to an 85-84 victory over the Washington Wizards by tipping in a rebound as time expired Monday night in the preseason opener for both teams. 
"Those moments are precious and priceless," said the 6-9, 280-pound forward from San Diego State. "When things like that happen and people pat you on the back it feels really good." 
However, in 12 minutes against the Wizards, his only points came on the game-winner, so his roster spot is not secure. He also grabbed five 
Millar hit a two-run dou­ble with two outs and scored on a single by Trot Nixon. Tanyon Sturtze relieved and Jason Varitek hit a two-run homer on his third pitch, pulling the Red Sox to 8-5. 
David Ortiz made it 8-7 with a two-run triple in the eighth off Tom Gordon, who would have been the Yankees' closer had Rivera not been back and ready. Ortiz's drive to left-center bounced off the glove of Matsui near the top of the wall, and the crowd got up to welcome Rivera, per­haps the biggest factor in New York's six AL pen­nants and four World 
rebounds. 
The Pacers need to make at least three more cuts before the start of the regular season on Nov. 3 to get their roster down to the required 12 lllayers.
t·urcal turns himself into 
Cobb County jail 
MARIETTA, Ga. -Atlanta Braves shortstop Rafael Furcal turned him· self in to the Cobb County Jail on Tuesday to serve a 21-day sentence on a probation violation. 
Jail spokeswoman Nancy Bodiford said Furcal entered 1the jail two hours before a court deadline. 
A judge decided last week to allow Furcal to participate in the playoffs despite a probation violation on a drunken driving charge. Furcal's season ended Monday night when the Braves lost in Game 5 of their divisional series against the Houston Astros. 
The 26-year-old Furcal was arrest­ed Sept. 10 in Atlanta on a charge of driving under the influence. 
Series titles since 1996. 
He had returned to his native country Sunday after two relatives were electrocuted in the swim­ming pool of his home, and arrived back at the ball­park in the second inning after a private plane arranged by the Yankees took him to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. 
Given a huge ovation by the sellout crowd of 56,135, he fell behind 2-1 to Millar, who popped the next pitch to shortstop Derek Jeter, behind second base. 
After this t1uiller, Pedro Martinez pitches for the Red Sox on Wednesday.

Belles take care of Thunder in 5 games 
By JUSTIN STETZ Sports Writer 

It took the Belles five games to get the victory against Tri-State University Tuesday. but a win the in the left column is better than a loss in the right. 
The Thunder had yet to earn a win in the MIAA, but gave the Belles a run for their money. But in the end the Belles triumphed over the last-place Thunder. 
Coming into the match, Saint Mary's was in desperate need of a win. Tri-State came out ready to play and captured the first two games of the match, 30-25 and 30-27. 
But the Belles kept their com­posure and did something they haven't done all season. They were able to win a match after losing the first game. 
In the third game, the Belles bounced back with some impres­sive play and prevailed by a score of 30-22. Still down 2-1 in the match, they fought back and pulled out an exciting victory, winning 30-28. In the final con­test, the Belles turned the tables and secured the win by beating the Thunder 15-10 in the tiebreaker. 
A number of players rose to the occasion for the Belles to help them avoid their third straight loss. Elise Rupright had a fine game on offense as she con­tributed 13 kills. Shelly Bender added another 11 kills and team­mate Michelle Turley continued her dominance with a team-high 18 kills. 
On defense, some spectacular play from Anne Cusack and Michelle Gary helped the Belles mount the comeback. Cusack led the team with 28 digs on defense, and Gary tallied up another 25, preventing the Tri-State offense from scoring. 
The win keeps the Belles in the thick of MIAA and gives them some much-needed motivation as they prepare to finish up their conference play. 
Saint Mary's is now 5-10 over­all and improves to 5-7 in the conference. With four more con­ference games left on their schedule, the Belles are still in striking distance of Hope and Albion who are both only a cou­ple games ahead of them in the division. 
Saint Mary's will now have some time to polish up its play this week to prepare for Sunday's game against Adrian. 
From here on out, every game will be like a playoff game for the Belles.

Irish ready to return home 
Notre Dame set to take on nonconference foe Illinois State at JACC 
By MIKE GILLOON Sports Writer 
A little sun has started to shine on the Irish season, but clouds still lurk in the distance. 
After starting out its Big East schedule with three consecutive wins, including back-to-back road victories over Rutgers and Seton Hall, Notre Dame (8-5) returns to the friendly courts of the Joyce Center tonight at 7 
p.m. to take on Illinois State. 
Irish coach Debbie Brown portrayed a cautious excite­ment when asked how it feels to be on a three-game winning streak after starting off the year 5-5. 
"It feels great, we're com­petitors and everyone likes to win," she said. 
"But we're not coming away thinking we've got it made." 
The Irish will be chal­lenged by a Redbird team that is currently tied for sec­ond place in the Missouri Valley Conference with a league record of 5-2. 
They are coming off losses to conference foes Southwest Missouri State and Wichita defender-currently second State last weekend but on the team in blocks behind Brown believes they are a Emily Kabbes. hungry, dangergus team. Notre Dame seems to be

Illinois State lost only one starter from the squad that fell to Notre Dame in three games last season. 
Senior Kelly Rikli heads that group. The 5-foot-1 0 setter leads the Redbirds in assists with an average of 12 per game. 
Laura Doornbos and Kari Staehlin are the main offen­sive threats as they are first and second on the team in kills with averages of 3.61 and 3.02 respectively. Staehlin is also a good 

home match for 
the Irish since a five-game loss to Valparaiso on Sept. 7. 
After two difficult games on the road against confer­ence opponents, Brown is ready to go back to her familiar seat on the Joyce Center bench and face a nonconference team the Irish have had recent suc­cess against. 
"It's great to be back here and not have to be on the road," she said.

MEN'S INTERHALL BLUE LEAGUE 
Pair of 2-1 teams face off in Rabid Bats-Ramblers matchup tf[)night 

By RYAN KIEFER 
Sports Writer 
Playoff positioning will be on the line in the season finale when the Rabid Bats and the Ramblers clash tonight. 
Both teams are 2-1 and realize the importance of tonight's battle, with the winner being in prime position heading into the playoffs. 
The Ramblers of Siegfried expected to be in this position. 
The two-time defending champs' lone blemish is an unex­pected defeat in week two against Carroll. 
Siegfried rebounded on Sunday, however, soundly defeating St. Ed's 20-0. An explosive passing game keyed the win as the Ramblers racked up 192 passing yards. 
They will look to employ a bal­anced attack tonight using the arm of quarterback Brian Vithe and the running ability of tailback Matt Woperer. 
A strong defense has also con­tributed to the Ramblers' recent success. 
The team has only given up 17 points in three games this year. 
For the Rabid Bats, an option­oriented offense has been the cor­nerstone for the team. Quarterback Sean Wieland has seen limited passing action. He put the ball in the air only five times in the Bats' last game. 
Instead, the Bats have kept the ball on the ground, relying on their strong offensive line. 
The Bats should be well pre­pared and well rested for tonight's game since they didn't have a game on Sunday. 
The key to the game will likely be the Rabid Bats' ability to con­trol the ball and keep the potent Siegfried offense off the field.

Tuesday was a good day for the Irish contingent at the Eastern Illinois Invitational. All five Irish players, competing as individu­als, had strong days on the tour­nament's final day. 
In an event plagued with wind and bad weather, the Irish play­ers seemed to get better as the weather got worse, while other teams struggled to control their shots. 
"Weather separates average players from good players, and it takes a lot of guts and resolve [to play the way we played]." said assistant coach Chris Whitten. 
The wind played such a factor over the course of the event that the winning individual score did­n't even break par, coming in 3­strokes-over at 219. 
Leading the Irish delegation were senior co-captain K.C. Wiseman and sophomore Adam Hoyer, both of whom shot a three-round total of 223 and tied for third. Hoyer, a transfer from the University of Florida, was competing in his first event as a Notre Dame student, having just earned a roster spot in practice the week before the event. 
Sophomore Adam Gitl'ord was close behind them, breaking the top 10, finishing in ninth place. 
Senior Steve Colnitis and junior Federico Salazar both had strong final rounds to make up for somewhat disappointing Mondays. Salazar, who was in 50th at the start of the final round, shot a 74 and moved up substantially in the standings. Similarly, Colnitis, who also struggled in the first two rounds, shot a 77 to improve his position­ing. 
While Whitten is pleased with the way his pla.yers performed, he sees now as the time for the guys who competed in the Eastern Illinois Invitational, dubbed as a "JV event," as well as the rest of the team, to work on getting some good practice while the weather is still pleas­ant. 
"This is time to improve in their game, rather than just maintain where they are, and to put in some good practice time," he said. 
The Irish will have to practice hard in the next weeks. as the team heads off to Stanford University to compete in the Nelson Invitational against some very strong competition of Oct. 23-24. 
Despite the faet the players that competed this weekend did not represent the Irish, the team ros­ter has not been solidified and there is a possibility of guys working their way into it. 
"I wish we were in a position where sports were locked up, because the best teams in college golf don't have a lot of fluctuation in their lineups," Whitten said.

against conference leader Hope in a 1-1 tie, it also struggled to squeak out a 1-0 win against last-place Tri-State. 

"When you play a less-skilled team. you have to make sure to fight mentally to play your brand of soccer instead of playing to your opponent's game," MacKenzie said. "You don't want to play down to the other team's level." 
Thankfully for the Belles, that was not the case in their last game against Tri-State. The Belles played strong soccer from start to finish, allowing them to rotate in every player. 
"Against Tri-State, we knew what we needed to do, found the back of the net early, and took it to them," MacKenzie said. 
While the last two games gave the team a chance to give neces­sary momentum and confidence to the Belles, it also provided valuable experience for the remainder of the year. 
"The last two games have helped team morale a lot as well," MacKenzie said. "They were more than just two wins."

FOOTBALL 

Quinn says he will start against Navy 
By HEATHER VAN 
HOEGARDEN 
SportS Editor 
After suffering a concussion in Saturday's win over Stanford, lrish quarterback Brady Quinn is ready to play against Navy. 
"l think Brady is fine," lrish coach Tyrone Willingham said at Tuesday's press conference. "What we have to do is always go through the normal steps any time a guy has an injury. This one requires that you look at him, but I think he's fine." 
When asked if he expected Quinn to play Saturday, Willingham responded, "Absolutely." 
Quinn practiced Tuesday. and answered questions afterwards. 
"I feel tine," Quinn said. ''I'm feeling good. I was out there practicing today, so everything's tine." 
lie said he wasn't sure which particular play he was injured on, whether it have been the quarterback sneak into the end zone or a previous play. 
"It's hard to tell," he said. Quinn described his injury by saying. "I got my bell rung." 
Third-down conversions 
Saturday against Stanford, the Irish converted 10-for-19 third downs, an unusually high percentage, especially this sea­son. Willingham said a lot of it was good execution on first and second downs. 
"Ideally, those downs play a huge part of it because if there's less ground to cover, it's easier to cover it," Willingham said. 
lie also said the majority of converting on third down comes down to execution. 
"But the second part of it is, and the major portion of it is, you have to execute on third down," he said. "That's whether it's third and short, or third and long, third and medium. You've got to execute. If you're execut­ing and putting things in the right place, it happens. We were fortunate Saturday, our guys, that was a pretty high percentage. You normally don't see that." 
Before Saturday's game, the Irish were 26-for-78 on third down conversions. Purdue leads the nation in that category, con­verting 22-for-70 third downs, good for 60 percent. 
Hoyte back home, but different situation 
The last time Irish linebacker Brandon Boyte played Navy in his home state of New Jersey, 
he  was  filling in for  a  sick  
Courtney Watson.  
Hoyte played  well  in  the  

absence of the middle line­backer, registering a team-high nine tackles, including two for a loss. 
"Anytime that you have a chance to go home, it's a big deal, it's important," Willingham said. "So not only was the opportunity to step in for Courtney, when we found that out, we reacted as coaches always do. We expect the next guy to step in and [say], 'Let's go play.' Of course, he was well­prepared and ready for that. Yet at the same time you're not ready for it because it does come as somewhat of a sur­prise. He handled it very well."

"They are all really good wide receivers who can adjust to my passes well and get open," Ruffer said. 
The Pyros had no such luck through the air. as the unorthodox Pyro oflcnse relied on a numbnr of trick plays to try to catch the Cavanaugh defense off-guard. Using a number of wide receiver passes and reverses. the Pyros looked for any holes in the Cavanaugh defense, but could not lind any. as the Pasquerilla East offense never made it inside the Cavanaugh red zone. 
Freshman Jenny Blase and jun­ior Lauren Manning both provided interceptions for the Chaos defense to ensure Pasquerilla East would not move the ball through the air. 
But the story of the game was the potent passing attack of Cavanaugh, as Ruffer connected with her three wideouts for big play aftnr big play. With all three wide receivers having receptions of over 25 yards, and Powaga pulling in an amazing 60-yard reception. the Chaos' passing game looked totally prepared going into the playoffs. 
The only time Pasquerilla East was able to stop the Cavanaugh passing attack was when Ruffer and the first-team offense sat out a series. and the Pyros were able to get an interception returned for a touchdown. That long intercep­tion return provided the only scor­ing for the Pyros.

Breen-Phillips moved the ball up and down the field at will all game against Pasquerilla West. So one yard surely would not have kept the Babes from their fourth victory of the season, right? 
Well, not quite. 

In fact, with the score knotted at 6-6, the Babes failed to score the would-be winning touchd!jwn twice in the final 60 seconds of their regular-season finale against Pasquerilla West. After BP quar­terback Ally Brosnan ran eight yards to the Weasel one on first­and-goal, the Babes had three downs and 65 seconds to move the ball 36 inches for the victory. 
However, the PW defenders had other thoughts on their minds. Then. the Pasquerilla West defen­sive line to make its presence felt. 
When Brosnan saw the Weasels' tight coverage on the Babes' receivers, she tucked the ball in her arm and made a run for the goal. Unfortunately for her though, Julie Putnam was ready to make a play. 
As Brosnan ran toward the right pylon, Putnam chased her down from behind and stopped Breen­Phillips from taking the lead. 
When the defensive line pres­sured Brosnan into throwing an incomplete pass on fourth-and­goal, the Weasels took over on downs with 35 seconds remaining

quarterback Heather Van

However, with 20 seconds left, 
the Babes intercepted her pass. 
After an incomplete pass on first

The three-foot heartbreak this

"It was a good game to pre­pare," she said. "PW is very good, just like the teams we'll face in the playoffs." 
McGlinn 12, Farley 0 
With the playoffs out of reach, the McGlinn Shamrocks decided to spend time on not only their actual plays. but also on some potential celebrations. After a con­vincing 12-0 win over Farley, the Shamrocks made sure to put both to good use. 
The McGlinn offense, led by jun­ior quarterback Bridget Meacham. moved the ball down the field with relative ease all night. The offense accumulated 220 total yards on the evening, with 160 of those yards coming through the air. 
McGlinn had the Farley defense confused the entire game by throwing double reverses. quar­terback options and laterals at the Finest. 
Meacham was not the only offensive weapon on display for the McGlinn offense. as junior running back Raquel Ferrer and junior wide receiver "Downtown" Becky Brown stepped up in a big way. Ferrer accounted for 85 yards on offense, including a nifty 40-yard dash off a perfectly exe­cuted quarterback option. 
Brown used her height and leaping ability to pull down four passes for 150 yards. including two plays of 75 and 45 yards that each resulted in a touchdown. The Shamrock bench made certain to get in the mix as well by being loud and supportive throughout the game. 
The McGlinn defense also gar­nered some attention by pressur­ing the Farley quarterback-by­committee into two interceptions. As a unit, the Shamrock defense held Farley to 125 yards of total offense, quickly halting any drives that even approached the end zone. . 
Sophomore wide receiver Megan Spokes and Annie Parrett performed well nonetheless, accounting for nearly all of the Finest's yardage. 
"We had a lot of younger play­ers this year, so I think the follow­ing years will be good for Farley ... they are some of the most promising players I've seen," sen­ior quarterback and captain Angelina Zehrbach said.

Belles look for first road -win of season 
By RYAN DUFFY Sports Writer 
If the Belles want to have any shot at winning the MIAA, their first task will be figuring out how to win on the road. 
Looking for its first road win, Saint Mary's travels to Kalamazoo today in hopes of improving on its 0-2-1 record away from home. 
"It's going to be a fight against Kalamazoo," Belles coach Caryn MacKenzie said. "We need to come out with focus and determination, forget about any distractions and concen­trate on getting a win. It's just a mattnr of attitude." 
For the first time this year, Saint Mary's will play an away game in the middle of the week rather than on a Saturday. The team is confident it can make the transition smoothly. 
"We're good enough and tal­ented enough to handle the trip up to Kalamazoo," MacKenzie said. "llopefully, we can do what we need to do to bring home the win." 
After having trouble scoring goals for the majority of the first half of the season, the Belles have scored 16 in their last two games, a trend they hope to continue. 
"I feel good about the way we're finding the back of the net," MacKenzie said. "I also am happy with the number of people scoring, because it makes it difficult for opponents to focus on one particular play­er." 
Although Kalamazoo is a much better team than Tri­State or Adrian, the last two teams the Belles have faced, ~aint Mary's still hopes to flash some oll'ensive firepower. 
"We feel good about the way we've been moving the ball in the upper third of the field," MacKenzie said. 
The Belles can't even be sure what caliber of team they'll face -while Kalamazoo played well

Irish face regional rival UM 
By KATE GALES 
Sports Writer 
The Irish have come a long way since they last saw the Wolverines -ending up on the wrong side of a penalty­kick decision in the NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 last year. But in the middle of a tough Big East schedule, Notre Dame is ready to take on its regional rivals and get a little payback for last year's season-ending loss. 
"Whether or not it's Michigan . we obviously want to win every game we can," coach Bobby Clark said. "That in itself should be more than enough incentive to gnt our team ready." 
The Irish are coming off a pair of conference victories over Pittsburgh and Syracuse, extending their win streak to five -all via shutouts.

Cavanaugh finishes undeafeated

They started the season at the top, and the Chaos finished the regular season at the top. 
With Tuesday night's 18-6 victo­ry over Pasquerilla East, Cavanaugh ended the regular season with an undefeated 5-0-1 record. 
"This was a game we felt we had to win," Cavanaugh junior quarterback Lisa Ruffer said. "We came into the season first in the league and wanted to make sure that we would finish in first." 
Ruffer was the star of the game, leading the Chaos offense perfect­ly, completing pass after pass. With over 250 yards through the air, Ruffer shredded the soft Pyro defense. 
Cavanaugh junior wide receivers Nancy Powaga and Janice Flynn and senior Jenny Nokes all made significant contri­butions to the Chaos' air attack, as each was on the receiving end of a touchdown pass.
