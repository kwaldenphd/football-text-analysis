upport the Bengals; a 




great tradition 

Matt Carbone 
Brian Weiford's hands 
drop almost im-Accent Copy Editor perceptibly. Seeing an opening, his sparring-------­
partner Kevin O'Rourke quickly flicks out a left 
'ab-right hand combination. As the two boxers 
disengage and continue to circle the ring, 
O'Rourke instructs Weiford: "Keep your hands 
up, Brian. You're dropping you right." 
This scene is a sparring session between two 
members of the Notre Dame Boxing Club, in 
preparation for the 63rd Annual Bengal Bouts. 
The Bengal Bouts were created in 1931, by 
Dominic J. "Nappy" Napolitano, who was guided 
by a simple philosophy: "Strong bodies fight, 
that weak bodies may be nourished." 
These simple, poetic words still guide the 
Bouts today. All proceeds from the Bengal Bouts 
go to the Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh. In 
a country where one dollar can feed a family o 
five, the approximately $15,000 donated by the 
Bouts each year really helps to make a dif­
ference. 
Beginning the first day of this semester, almost 100 students have gone through rigorous sets of calisthenics, glove drills, running and sparring. By the time training ended, many were in the best shape of their lives. Each has been taught the punches and defenses; for many, this has been their first glimpse into the sweet science. 
The culmination of all of this hard work began on Sunday, when the quarterfinals of the Bengal Bouts were held. 62 boxers in 12 weight dasses stepped into the ring to do their small part for the Bengal Missions. 
In 1954, Father Lawrence L. Graves, C.S.C. sent a letter from the Missions to Nappy. This letter is reprinted in this year's program. 
"I wish I could conduct you and the whole student body on a complete tour of the Bengal Missions here in Pakistan. I believe your enthusiasm for the Bouts and for the Bengal missionaries of Holy Cross would have a blessed closeness and intensity never before felt." 
Although it is not probable that you will make this trip, you can still do your part in support o the Missions: come out and watch the remaining rounds of the Bengal Bouts. Cheer on someone from your hall, your hometown, or just anybody at all. The boxers have worked hard, and deserve your recognition. 
The semifinals are tonight at 7:30 p.m. in the .JACC Fieldhouse, with the finals slated for Friday, Feb. 26 at 8 p.m. in the main arena. Tickets are available at the door.

Barcelona straoped after Olympics 
 BARCELONA, Spain -Six months after the summer Olympic Games ended on a dazzling high note, the host · city suffers from a nagging hangover. , . Now it's time to pay the bills, and in a ~· period of bankruptcies, rising taxes l.\ and record unemployment, residents are grumbling. "We people of Barcelona are left behind paying for this new Olympic image for a long time. There's massive uncertainty regarding Barcelona's future," said Albert Recio, professor of economics at Barcelona's Autonomous University. The city of Barcelona and the regional government of Catalunya are scheduled to pay off their $2.1 billion of combined debt by 2010. The $4 billion in public debt, also to be paid by 2010, has been assumed by Spain's central government and other public agencies. To help pay down the debt, authorities hiked a local business tax by 30 percent several months ago.

L.A. schools debut gun control effort 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -The reality behind the lesson re­cited by 15 children in an ele­mentary school library Tuesday was as close as the headline on a newspaper on a desk: "Student Shot, Dies at Reseda High." 
Helping teach them how to prevent gun violence was James Brady, the former White House press secretary who was seriously wounded in the 1981 attempted assassination of President Reagan. 
What do you do if you see a gun? asked Christine Davis, counselor at Weemes Elemen­tary School in a neighborhood southwest of downtown. 
"Don't touch the gun. Get out of the situation. Tell a trusted adult," answered the young­sters, who wore blue sashes marked "Peacemaker." 
The demonstration of the new program in the Los Angeles Unified School District coin­cidentally came the day after the second fatal shooting on a district campus in one month. 
Correction 
In a story in yesterday's edition, The Observer incor­rectly reported the Saint Mary's College Ash Wednesday Mass as spon­sored by Board of Gover­nance. The Mass is sponsored by Campus Ministry. In a related story, Melissa Whelan was incorrectly identified as the spiritual life commissioner of Student Activities Board, rather than spiritual life commissioner of Board of Governance. The Observer regrets the error.

Dear Editor: 
As the largest employer in St. Joseph County Indiana, mem­bers of the Notre Dame and St. Mary's community should be made aware of a proposal to impose a County Option Income Tax (COlT) on all residents and/or employees within the county. This proposal would amount to six tenths of one percent (0.6 percent) of the income of virtually all ND/SMC faculty, staff, and employed students. 
As many of you may know this county is plagued with nepotism, political favors, county employees doing per­sonal work on county time, and at least two cases of apparent embezzlement. There have been no serious attempts to re­duce spending or cut costs. 
If passed this tax will cost all ND/SMC employees a significant amount at a time when other taxes are likely to be going up. If you oppose yet one more level of government reaching into your pocket you must call the local powers that be to tell

WSND seeks input about campus radio 
Dear Editor: 
In response to Mike Scrudato's Feb. 16 "Inside Col­umn" ("WSND's the Other Ra­dio Alternative") WSND has be­come intensely curious about what students think about campus radio here at NO. 
The column praised WSND's "Nocturne" program, which features alternative/progressive rock every night between midnight and 2 a.m. However, Mr. Scrudato went on to ex­press his dismay over the pro­gram's late start time and pro­posed it be rolled back to 10 
p.m.  providing an additional two hours per night of this area's only stereo alternative 
music. 
This is an important issue to the WSND staff, and we have responded by sending out a 
survey to random students
from both Notre Dame and
Saint Mary's. Your input is vi­tal! Please take the time to fill out this survey and send it back to Pete Matthews. 214 Alumni

Lent is the time to turn back to God and reflect 
Dear Editor: The season of Lent is a time when Christians are called to 
reflect on the great chasm that sin creates between humanity and God. 
It is not very difficult to rec­ognize that separation as it manifests itself in the evils of 
today's world. It is perhaps most immediately apparent in the violence, the hatred, and the tension that too often per­vade relations between individ­ual persons, racial and ethnic

power of divine peace and love might flow, thus helping the world towards a realization of the Kingdom "on earth as it is in heaven." One traditional means by which Christians­and monotheists in general­have sought reconciliation with God is prayer. With full confi­dence in the importance of prayer for the spiritual and moral well-being of human kind, and for genuine peace in a troubled world, Pax Christi 
N.D. is sponsoring three prayer vigils during this Lenten season. Each will take place at Stonehenge at 6:00 p.m., the first on February 26, the second on March 26, and the third on April 2nd. Each will last be­tween 30 and 45 minutes, weather permitting. Please do come join us in prayer.

From the Playpen 


On the road 
again: places 
to roadtrip 
N 
ow that football season is over and the weather will hopefully get better, 
students find their weekends finally 
vacant. Although South Bend is 
loaded with weekend entertainment 
options, some students may want to broaden 
their horizons beyond the scope of Corby's and 
Bridget's. Here are some fabulous roadtrip ideas 
for the adventurous and even the under-aged. 
Graceland: You have already purchased the 
stamp so now make the trip and pay a tribute to 
his shrine. Yes, go to this infamous hovel and 
look for the king himself. If you actually find this 
man, dead or alive, get your picture taken with 
him and make a cool million from "The National 
Enquirer." Elvis attire is in order for this 
road trip. 
Las Vegas: Looking for some fast spring break 
cash? With next semester's tuition money and a 
little Irish luck you could be the next millionaire. 
This town is characterized by its lavish hotels 
with huge pools, bars and casinos. One could 
probably break every rule in "DuLac " in just a 
few short hours in this haven of sin. Warning: 
go soon, before the mass tax increase. 
Rome, Wisconsin: Does this town actually 
exist? Watch the television series "Picket 
Fences" being filmed live, twins and all. This 
town bears a striking resemblance to Notre 
Dame. particularly because of the judges' 
handbook called "DuFence." 
Niagara Falls: Besides the actual falls, which 
are beautiful in themselves, this town is full of 
fabulous entertainment. Visit the wax museums, 
with lifelike figures of Elvis and Elvira, the fun 
house, or one of the several thousand bead-and­
trinket stores. One can buy everything 
from snowy domes of the falls, to Niagara falls 
underwear and seashells. Of course every item 
was made in this small tourist trap town, just 
ignore the "made in Taiwan" stickers. 
Disney World: If you have an abundance of 
cash, I highly recommend this playground. 
Second only to the Notre Dame bookstore in 
selling overpriced items with its logo on it, this 
park can be educational as well as expensive. 
However, it is a far drive, and I don't recommend 
watching the "Electric Light Parade" too long; 
the theme song from this parade will plague you 
for the rest of your life-"Da-da-da-da-da .... " 
Kansas: No Notre Dame student's life could be 
complete without visiting the site of the crash 
which took the life of Knute Rockne. Second 
semester seniors, you only have a few weeks left. 
Take advantage of your free weekends and make 
the long journey before graduation. Remember: 
the clock is ticking. 
The "Ferris Bueller's Day Off Chicago tour": 
You have watched the movie several hundred 
times. It is time to reenact your hero's every 
move. Take a sunny day off from classes and 
journey to Chicago to follow Ferris' route, 
complete with a Cubs game. Just beware-Patty 
O'Hara could be hot on your track. 
The Hesburgh Library: Believe it or not, there 
are some south quad residents who would 
equate going to the library with a road trip, 
particularly in sub-zero temperatures. Explore 
this intricate study haven. Perhaps you will rub 
elbows with Ted himself on the top floor. 
Monitor the decreasing noise levels as you make 
your way to the top floors. Play with UNLOC and 
then, when the day is done, have a snack in 'the 
pit.' This 'road trip' is a must do for all students. 
Now that you have a destination, load up the car and just go. Pick up your copy of "Dulac" and hit the open road. Just remember that a college education is more than studying, it is experiencing life with your friends and verbalizing these experiences in top ten lists in "The Observer."

Atravel through time 
'The Heidi Chronicles' explores contemporary issues 
BY ELISABETH HEARD 
Accent Writer 
What happens when eleven talented actors, a good director, and a powerful script all come together? What is created is "The Heidi Chronicles," a riveting play brilliantly directed by Reginald Bain, associate professor of communication and theater at Notre Dame. 
"The Heidi Chronicles" will be performed at Washington Hall from Wednesday, February 24, to Saturday, February 27 at 8:10p.m. and Sunday, February 28 at 3:10p.m. 
"The Heidi Chronicles" is a play reviewing the life of art historian, Heidi Holland (Jeannie Goodnow). The audience sees the different stages in Heidi's life, from 1965 to 1993 and actually grows up with her. 
The play begins in the present with Heidi teaching her college class about several female painters by showing pictures of the paintings on a slide projector. This scene is realistic because the audience feels as though they are not really watching but participating in the play. 
One of the pictures in particular, a picture of a young woman in a flowing dress holding a rose and a watch, triggers Heidi's memory and sends her back in time. 
It is a high school dance, where Heidi's best friend, Susan (Erin O'Malley) instructs Heidi on how to attract guys so that they will come and dance with her. 
It is at this point that Heidi meets Peter (Michael Scarsella) a shy, somewhat nerdy boy attracted to Heidi because she brought along a book to the dance. This is the begin­ning of a friendship that develops and blossoms to become an integral part of the plot. 
The scene moves to 1968, where Heidi, now a young woman, runs into Scoop Rosenbaum (Stan Sawicki), an arrogant, narcissistic journalist They are at a McCarthy dance where both of them claim they are waiting for someone, and in the meantime exchange conversation. Scoop comes across as being very harsh and irritating, and says things to the young Heidi that make-her blush.

Internationally published Marge Piercy will speak tonight at the Sophomore Literary Festival. Piercy is expected to read some of her poetry as well as an essay or excerpt from some of her other longer pieces. The reading, at 8 p.m. in the Hesburgh Library Auditorium, will be followed by a reception in the Library Lounge. Piercy will also hold a discussion on Feb. 25 (Wednesday) at 8:30 p.m. 
Raised in Detroit, Piercy has lived in Chicago, Boston, Paris, San Francisco, and New York. Now living in Cape Cod, Piercy spends a great deal of time travelling to give poetry readings and workshops. Piercy's has written several books of poetry, fiction, plays and essays. Her works have appeared in over 200 periodicals, and eight of her novels, and three poetry books have been translated into foreign languages, including Japanese, German, and French. 
Not only an accomplished writer, Piercy is also very involved in many social groups. It was her political activism coupled with her literary 
Through his probing, however, and his journalistic instincts, he comes to the conclusion that Heidi is a serious, good person, a thing that is hard to find. 
Time passes again and it is 1971. Susan has convinced Heidi to come with her to a consciousness raising rap group, and here she comes in contact with some very flamboyant personalities. 
Becky (Frani McLaughlin). is a teenager who is living with a verbally abusive man ever since her parents left her. Fran (Colleen Montoya), is a lesbian whose brutal "honesty" is full of hatred and vulgarity, and Jill (Keri Latherow). is a happy-go-lucky housewife and mother. It is at this point that the feminist theme becomes prevalent, and they set the tone for the rest of the play. 
Fran, the lesbian, is a strong, dynamic and outspoken character for the short amount of time she spends on stage. 
The year changes to 1974, and Heidi is participating in a protest in front of the Chicago Art Institute because of their lack of exhibits by female artists. It is at this point that Peter reveals that he is is gay, and, besides being involved with a man 
accomplishments that compelled the committee to invite Piercy to speak. 
"It was partially because of her diversity, her feminism and anti-war involvement, that we invited her. We felt she would bring an interesting perspective to the Festival," said Kerry McArdle, Chairperson of the Literary Festival. Piercy's Jewish heritage, feminism, and involvement in other political activist groups provides an interesting contrast to the student body of Notre Dame. 
One of her many talents lies in her ability to indirectly address ideas. "Summer People," one of Piercy's more recent novels does just that. Piercy indirectly rediscovers the struggles of a Jewish female in today's culture. Her most recent book of Poetry, "Mars and her Children," examines non-traditional named Stanley, he has just begun dating a waiter named Chris (Steve Susco).

interesting perspective.  
"It's  human,  not  bizarre  or  

Peter's homosexuality is a persistent theme that is very important to the development of his character. It is this fact that keeps him and Heidi from being more than very good friends. Heidi is shocked, and upset because inside she had feelings for Peter, but now she realizes that their love can never be. After these feelings are reconciled, however, she continues to have a long and lasting friendship with Peter. 
These themes are very strong, and provide the basis and backbone for the script. "I hope it will spark conversation about how men and women communicate," said Bain. 
Bain chose this play because he wanted a contemporary play with lots of roles for women. "I wanted a play for women," Bain said. "It is a real challenge, and something different for the kids." 
Tickets are available at the LaFortune Information Desk for $7. Student and senior citizen tickets are available for $5 for the Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday performances. 
disgusting. She is extremely sensitive about women and their roles in society and emphasizes it by creating unique twists," said Emily Lehrman, a member of the Literary Festival Committee. Lehrman explained that a great deal of Piercy's work deals with an examination of what it is to be a female, especially in a male dominated society. Piercy truly seems to be in touch with the thoughts of society and how individuals interact. 
Piercy claims to, "live by my writing and giving poetry readings and workshops," and her abilities reflect this. Although Piercy does do some teaching, she prefers giving workshops and readings to the classroom. 
While a great deal of her time is dedicated to social activist groups, Piercy always makes time to continue her workshops. This does however, serve to be somewhat difficult as Piercy spends about a third of the time on the road, spending a day or two a week in Boston. Piercy enjoys the workshops, activism, and her writing. When deciding how to spend her time, she said she works, "as the spirit seizes me."

Northwestern next for women's tennis 
By RIAN AKEY 
Sports Writer 
When the Notre Dame women's tennis team squares off against Northwestern today in Evanston. II., the Irish will face a squad strikingly similar to its own. 
In fact. the biggest differ­ence on paper between the two teams may be their school col­ors. 
The Wildcats and the Irish are both young teams, starting three freshmen and only one senior. Both squads are among the top teams in the Midwest region, making today's contest a must-win match for Nrthwestern and Notre Dame. 
"They're a really young team," said Irish coach Jay Louderback, "and they've been struggling because of that lack of age and experience. But they're improving and develop­ing into a solid team. We re­cruited two of their three freshmen, so that shows how similar we are." 
The Irish, while not neces­sarily struggling, have also had their share of difficulties this season. A schedule which in­cluded six matches against top­25 teams left them with a 2-5 record before beating LSU and TCU last weekend. At 4-5 now, the Irish would like to raise their record to .500 before their mid-semester break. 
"If we go into our break 5-5, I will be satisfied," said Louder­back. "With our schedule, that is a record I can be happy with." 
Junior Lisa Tholen noted 

another reason the match will be important for the Irish. 
"We need to win this match because it's within our region, and that's important as far as NCAA consideration," she said. "If we play like we did last weekend [against LSU and TCU) we should be fine." 
The team with the top record in each of the nation's six regions automatically quali­lies for the NCAA tournament. The Midwest region is com­prised of mostly Big Ten, Mid­American, and Midwest Colle­giate Conference teams. The Irish are currently 2-0 versus Midwest opponents. 
Following the match with the Wildcats, Notre Dame will be off until a March 7 visit to Kansas to take on the Jay­hawks. 
Ohio State stuns No.1 Indiana, 81-77 
COLUMBUS. Ohio (AP) ­Jamie Skelton hit 3-point shots at the end of regulation and with 40 seconds left in overtime as Ohio State ­winners of only three of its last 11 games-upset No.l-ranked Indiana 81-77 Tuesday night. 
With the score tied at 77, Skelton, who led Ohio State with 22 points, was wide open from the top of arc and hit his fourth 3-pointer of the game to put Ohio State ahead 80-77. 
Lawrence Funderburke later added a free throw as Ohio ·St.ate moved to 13-10 overall and 6-8 in the Big Ten. Indiana fell to 24·3 and 13-1. 
The victory marked the third straight time that Ohio State has beaten a No.1 team. The Buckeyes beat Iowa in 1987 and Indiana in 1983 in its last two meetings with a top­ranked team. 
Skelton hit an off-balance 3­pointer with three seconds re­maining to put Ohio State ahead 71-70. 
With two seconds remaining, Indiana threw the ball the length of the court as the buzzer sounded. But Ohio State's Derek Anderson was called for running over a pick set by Chris Reynolds. That was the fifth foul on Anderson, who had 20 points for the Buckeyes. 
Reynolds went to the line 
with two seconds on the clock and hit the first free throw to tie it. He missed the second, and Ohio State's Alex Davis missed a 50-foot heaVf~ as the buzzer sounded again. 
Ohio State hit its final six shots from the field, while Indiana missed its last seven in regulation. 
In the overtime, Ohio State scored the first six point.<> on a Davis 3-pointer and a three­point play by Funderburke, a former Indiana player who transferred to Ohio State two years ago. 
But Indiana came back to pull even on a layup by Brian Evans with 2:34 left. The teams traded possessions until Davis missed two shots but got his own rebound each time with a minute left. 
Skelton then came off a pick near the top of the key and hit the shot that put Ohio State ahead for good. 
Evans missed a 3·point shot with 11 seconds and then was tied up on the rebound attempt by Greg Simpson and Funder­burke. The possession arrow favored Ohio State and Fun­derburke was fouled with 6.8 seconds left, hitting one free throw to clinch the outcome. 
Funderburke and Simpson each had 12 points for Ohio State.

Taubenheim makes an immediate impact for Saint Mary's hoops 
By BETH REGAN Sports Writer 
Jennie Taubenheim, . a freshman from Kohler, Wis­consin, has been a major factor for the Saint Mary's basketball team this year. 
"I believe that Jennie turned our record around, " said coach Marv Wood. "We could have had a losing season without her." 
Taubenheim began playing basketball in the eighth grade for a small school in Kohler. Although her two brothers played basketball and football in high school, her parents are not sports oriented. 
"I come from very un-athletic parents," Taubenheim said. "I owe a lot to my high school 
Purdue will see a different men's volleyball team 
By KEVIN DOLAN Sports Writer 
Last month in West Lafayette, the Irish men's volleyball team played Purdue with an injury­decimated team and were upset in 4 games. Tonight, the Irish expect a much different story when they face the Boilermakers at 7:30 in the Pit at the J.A.C.C. with a full squad. 
''They were pretty cocky last time," said club president Pat Madden, who was sidelined with a heel injury in the first match. "It will be a much, much different story tonight, I think." . 
The Irish had no trouble with the Cincinnati Bearcats last Friday, beating them 15-10, 15-12, 15-11 without the services of captain Brian Ceponis, who was on campus for JPW. The Irish benefited from Bearcat hitting errors and other

coach who taught me every­thing I know.~ 
After being recruited by a few small, local colleges, Tauben­heim received information from Wood. 
"I didn't have much hope for getting her," said Wood. "I just didn't get good vibes during her visit." 
But Wood's promise for playing time influenced Taubenheim greatly. She con­sidered going to the University of Wisconsin at Madison and trying out for their team as a walk on, but in the end, she knew that Saint Mary's would be the most advantageous. 
The 5'9" forward is the Belles' leading scorer, averag­ing about 18 points per game. 
"I always look for her on a 
general ineffectiveness. 
"Even though our passing broke down again, they couldn't capitalize on our mistakes," said Madden. "We set them up for a lot of spikes that they just didn't connect." 
The Irish were aided again by a developing bench, with rookies Tim Regan, Miguel Ascencio and Matt Limtiaco filling in the back row for the Irish. 
"They all did real well," said Madden. "Those games are good because we can get the freshmen some quality minutes." 
Indiana State forfeited to the Irish earlier in the week, pushing the Irish record to 12-2. Tonight, the Irish look for a big win as well as revenge against the Boilermakers in the Pit. If you're at the Bengal Bouts, stop over and support the Irish, who are 5-0 in home sellouts.

"Taubenheim plays well both offensively and defensively. She has a lot of confidence, which is .very unique to find in a freshman," said Crowley. "She is defmitely our most consistent 
player." · 
"Jennie is a silent leader, she speaks with her actions on the court." Wood said. 
Taubenheim has great expec­tations for her remaining three years at Saint Mary's. · 
"I love the coaches and play­ers at S~int Mary's. I know I made the right choice and I feel confident that the next three years will be great," she said.

and Bennett wants to do his part to make sure that holds up. 
"Hopefully, we'll win the championship, because that's how you really get noticed," he says, and for him that is the key to another chance at the big-time. 
"The CBA is definitely the best shot at the NBA. There's more money in Europe, but it's not scouted as well." 
Bennett has some company in adjusting to life away from Notre Dame. The other half of the "Texas Express." Daimon Sweet, is also going the CBA route. 
"So far I've played Daimon about three times," Bennett says. "When he's on the court and I'm on the bench. I want my team to do well, but I also want him to do well. It's kind of weird." 

With time off due to the injury, Bennett had time last week to attend his second Notre Dame game of the season, the loss against Marquette. 
"It's a big adjustment for ev­erybody after losing four seniors like we had last season (Bennett, Sweet, Denver Nugget LaPhonso Ellis and Keith Tower, who's currently playing for Columbus of the CBA)." says Bennett. "But they're trying hard." 
The return of senior Monty Williams to the line-up this year has inspired many "what-ifs" about the past two seasons among fans and Bennett isn't immune to them himself. 
"That's what everybody says, that with Monty (last year) we would have made the NCAA's, but who knows how far we would have gone," he says. 
"It's great for him to be back," adding that Williams "definitely 
has the talent to play in the NBA." 
Talking about Williams specif­ically, but also the NBA in general, Bennett thinks it isn't based solely on talent. 
"There are probably 10 all-stars in the NBA," he says, "then the talent level drops off. If you get the right shot, it could work out." 
After coming back from his hand injury and playing the rest of the season, Bennett plans to hook up with a professional summer league team in order to keep improving. He doesn't have any definite plans as to how long he is willing to try to make the NBA before he 
changes his career.
"Probably three years, but there's never anything sure," Bennett says. "Right now. I'm concentrating on the time at hand. As for life after basketball, I'll Photo courtesy of Notre Dame Sports Information cross that bridge when I come to Bennett had the best season of his college career last year it." under first-year coach John Macleod.

Random Thoughts 
North Carolina overcame a lackluster 1------------------1 start to down cold-shooting Notre Dame 
Spring sports should build on last year's success 
Despite yesterday's frolicking in the 

snow. the spring sports season is 
rapidly approaching. Pitchers and 
catchers have reported to camp and 
Notre Dame's spring sports are ready 
to improve upon last year's success. 
The men's and women's tennis teams 

have already begun their seasons and 
are both nationally ranked. Both have 
had varied sucess against tough 
competition, but are still trying to 
overcome the early season losses of 
Andy Zurcher and Melissa Harris. 
However. the men should have a 
chance to try to return to the NCAA 
finals, and don't be surprised to see the 
women taking part in post-season 
competition as well. 
And the softball team has earned its 

first ever regional ranking. 
But, the two teams that should 

attract a lot of the attention, the 
baseball and lacrosse teams, have not 
even started their seasons. 
They have proved skeptics wrong, as the two teams have shown that they can be national powers despite playing in northern Indiana, where the baseball team plays on the road for the first month of the season and most natives have not even heard of lacrosse. 
Both squads are coming off trips to the NCAA tournament. The baseball team came up one game short of the College World Series, losing to Miami in the final game of the Atlantic Regional, and the lacrosse team bowed out to Johns Hopkins in the first round of the 
-tourney. 
However, both should have enough success to take some attention away from the spring football quarterback competition. 
The baseball team is ranked 14th in 

the nation, and the Irish are slated to 
begin their season with a trip to 
Arizona over spring break. 
I lead coach Pat Murphy, who turned down the prestigous Miami job over the summer, should keep the Irish nationally ranked throughout the season and could guide Notre Dame all the way to Omaha. 
Despite the loss of pitcher Pat Leahy to the Florida Marlins, the Irish still boast an impressive staff led by AI Walania. and the Notre Dame offense is led by captain Ed Hartwell. 
The lacrosse team begins their schedule this weekend and has a good shot at returning to the NCAAs. Ed Lamb and Handy Colley return to an Irish team that finished 10-5 last season. 
So, instead of being distracted by Kevin McDougal and Paul Failla battling for the quarterback spot, watch the Irish's spring sports make their run at the NCAAs. 
85-56 Tuesday night. 
The Tar Heels (23-3) won their sixth straight and avenged an 88-76 loss to the Fighting Irish last season at Madison Square Garden. 
Notre Dame (9-15), held scoreless for more 

than an eight-minute stretch in the sec­ond half. has lost 10 of 12 anrl is 0-7 against ranked teams.

Bennett still hoping to make the big time 
By RICH KURZ Associate Sports Editor 
The job market for college graduates is getting tougher all the time, but no one knows that as well as 1992 grad Elmer Bennett. 
Bennett, the starting point guard for last year's NIT finalist Notre Dame bas-ketball team, currently is trying to work his way to the top of the basketball world -the NBA. 
He's now with Grand Rapids of the Continental Basketball Association, but is out of action for a few weeks after breaking a bone in his hand. 
"Up until the injury I was playing back­up point guard, and I was playing pretty well," Bennett says. 
It hasn't been an easy road for the Beaumont, Tex., native. After being drafted by the Atlanta Hawks in the second round, Bennett was the last player cut at the end of training camp.

Bengal Bouts enter semi-final round tonight 
By GEORGE DOHRMANN Sports Writer 
The semifinals of the 63rd annual Bengal Bouts take place at the Joyce ACC lieldhouse tonight at 7:30. 
Quarterfinal bouts took place last Sunday, when 31 bouts were fought under the lights of the JACC Arena. The finals will be held Friday night in the Arena beginning at 8:00. 
Tonight's card is filled with 18 bouts, four lights from each weight class will be fought in the 130-pound to 175-pound divisions. The 130-pounders will light for the first time as the limited number of boxers did not allow a quarterfinal round. 
There were no surprises on Sunday's eard, all of the favorites survived. One small surprise was that all but three bouts lasted the full three rounds. Jeff Gerber (130-pounds), Lou Hall (145­pounds) and Jeff Goddard (160-pounds) were the only lighters to extinguish their opponents before the final bell rang. That trio separated themselves from the rest of the lighters, proving true the pre-bout hype that they were head and shoulders above the rest of the lighters. 
But the increase in full-length lights gives a good indication that the overall caliber of boxers is evenly matched. 
"I think that the longer bouts is a reflection of better technical boxing from all fighters," said Goddard, the 160­pound favorite. "This year there are less guys going out there and swinging wildly. There is a larger number of guys who are solid boxers."
