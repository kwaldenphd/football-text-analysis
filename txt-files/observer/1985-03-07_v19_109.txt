Saint Mary's cancels Little Sisters Weekend 
By DIANE SCHROEDER 

News Staff 
The Little Sisters Weekend at Saint 
Mary's, which was scheduled for the 
weekend of April I 2 to 14, was can­
celled because of lack of student in­
terest. 
A survey was sent out to students 
upon returning from Christmas 
break to determine the level ofinter­
est. The survey asked who was inter­
ested in having the weekend, the 
ages of the sisters, and suggestions 
for activities. 

Response was minimal, according to ·Co-chairwoman Monica Mates. "Most people took the letter and sur­vey as a request for help for the weekend, not for feedback as was in­tended," said Mates. 
Although interest in a little sisters weekend has always been low in the past, the event has never before been cancelled, said Director ofStu­dent Activities Mary Anne 
O'Donnell. O'Donnell noted that student support is the key to the suc­cess of any activity. "If the students really wanted it, the program would work out," she said. 
Not all Saint Mary's students were 
indifferent to the proposed 
weekend, however. Many 
welcomed the chance to have their 
little sisters come to visit them a.t 
school. Senior Tracey Bowman said, 
"I'm very disappointed. My sister has 
wanted to come up for a long time 
and this was the perfect opportu­
nity." Bowman, along with other stu­
dents, plans to invite her sister up 
regardless of the cancellation. 
O'Donnell added that the little 
sisters weekend will be attempted 
again in the fall of 1985.

Weak showing in rankings causes look at graduate school 
By CINDY RAUCKHORST 
StaffReporter 
A relatively weak showing in a 
recent national assessment of 
doctoral programs has caused 
Notre Dame to step back and ex­
amine the direction its graduate school program is taking. 
The national study, conducted by the Conference Board ofAsso­ciated Research Councils ( CBARC), ranked only one Notre Dame graduate doctoral pro­gram, chemical engineering, in the top 25 percent, six programs in the top 50 percent, and five programs in the top 75 percent. 
The ratings were based on the evaluation of over 6,000 Ameri­can University scholars who mea­sured the quality of sr ific departments in categories 'such as faculty quality, faculty effec­tiveness, and improvement ofde­partments over a period of five years. 
Robert Gordon, vice president for advanced studies and chair­man of the Graduate Council, feels strongly that, the results of the survey are extremely deceiv­ing, and "must be taken with a large grain ofsalt." 
"It's very hard to assess quality and scholarship. You can't com­pare departments that way," he said. 
"The survey is a popularity contest, based oo the scholarly quality of the program faculty as viewed by x number of profes­sors, who really don't know anything about the program and are given very little information, but they have the impression in their mind that a certain school is number one in a program and therefore, it must be number one in others, too," he said. 

The survey completely ne­glected certain programs, such as theology, in which Notre Dame is very strong, Gordon said. These programs are not offered by enough national universities to be included in the survey, he said.

Authorities arrested 11 people on narcotics charges in South Bend early yesterday, capping a six-month investi­gation that targeted drug dealers in St. Joseph Counfy. "We hope to make some people stand up and take notice," South Bend police Capt. Vinson Smith said. Charges included dealing in cocaine, heroin and marijuana, he said. No drugs were confiscated during the arrests, but drugs had been purchased earlier by police undercover officers, he said: The arrests may slow drug trafficking in the county for a short time, "but after a while it will pick up again," Smith said. -AP 
OwnerS Of the ethanol plant in South Bend have joined a lawsuit seeking to block the importation of cheaper ethanol from Brazil. "In the last quarter of 1984, 4 7 million gallons of Br~ilian ethanol were imported, brought in at prices that reflect dumping," said Barry Direnfeld, the president of New Energy Co. of Indiana Inc. New Energy owns an ethanol plant that began produc­tion in South Bend in 1984. 
The suit filed in federal court by a group of American ethanol companies and farm organizations claims Brazil subsidizes ethanol production and sells the alcohol product in the United States at 39 percent ofits true value. -AP

Dividends in cashier's office more than dollars and cents 
Buried in the Administration Building, two floors below University President Father Theodore Hesburgh, Executive Vice President Father Edmund joyce, and various other officers of Notre Dame, are the people with the money. 
True, the automatic teller can dispense money 24 hours of the day, but Claire and jeri are rarely out of order-and seemingly never without a friendly greeting. 
In the fall of 1981 Jeri began cashing checks for Notre . Dame students. Claire joined her inJuly 1982. Together they are literally the heart of the cashier's office and a model for University staff. 
After a weeklong string of midterms, papers, com­puter projects and other assorted disasters, another line is the last thing a student wants to see. Nevertheless, that is just what separates you from your weekend. The Friday afternoon line at the cashier's office. 
At the end of this line are a few bucks in the hand, which is worth more than a mint in the bush, but most valuable of all, two smiling faces.

money must get to a person after awhile. 
All the joking and laughable IDs aside, jeri and Claire care about the students. "We wish we could be more helpful," Claire said. "We feel sorry for them, especially the freshmen." At registration and enrollment times of the year, students eventually must find their way to the cashier's office after trips to numerous other offices: the registrar, student accounts, maybe the ACC or Stepan Center. Jeri and Claire wish they could provide more information for students about what forms and receipts 
need to go to the different 
offices. 
From their experience 
either Claire or Jeri has had in which they worked with people, but it is the people here that make the job of cashier so enjoyable for them. "We enjoy working with the students," Claire explained. 
Although she had worked at a bank before coming to Notre Dame, her rapport with people at the bank was not the same a:; it is with the students. "This is more fun," she said. "My family's grown and gone and this is fun for the worst cash lines are on Friday afternoons, especially right before break. Claire and Jeri recommend stu­dents try to visit the cas­hier's office in the mornings and during class hours, for the quickest service. 


In return, there are a few things you can do to make these ladies' jobs easier. jeri and Claire ask that students meet the requirements for cashing checks. Some stu­dents seem to think that they must endorse their

them blossom," Jeri agreed. "I see them grow over one year and four years." 
The fun is reliving their children's college days and watching them develop, from that first check from Mom and Dad to that final tuition payment. 
Interesting. Cute. Funny. These are three of-the ad­jectives jeri used to describe the Notre Dame student. Often neither Claire norJeri know what it is that starts them laughing. Claire related one day when she didn't know the reason, but before she knew it she was laugh­ing "so hard I was crying." 
Sometimes it is the students' senses of humors that keep the cashiers grinning, but often it is your IDs that keep them in stitches. "The bad one I got was when I looked up at the student (on the ID) and he really looked like the card," recalledJeri. 
Then there are the occasions when you just have to laugh at yourself. Jeri certainly knows the feeling. "I can remember one time when a boy near blind came in and I asked him for his driver's license." Handling all that

HliRGHADA. Egypt -King Hus­sein of Jordan appealed yesterday for a U.S.-Palestinian dialogue as a first step toward Mideast peace talks. 
He called on the United States to 
seize this "last chance" to settle the 
Arab-Israeli conflict. 
Hussein and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, meeting in this Red Sea resort town, made clear the dialogue would have to include members of the Palestine Liberation Organization or at least Palestinians acceptable to the guerrillas. 
ll was the first time Hussein had 

publicly endorsed Mubarak's pro­
posal for a preliminary discussion 
between the United States and a 
delegation of Jordanians and "Pales­
tinians. 
The Egyptian president's proposal 

was offered as a way to get Middle 
East peace talks started and provide 
a forum to draw the United States 
into peace talks. 
The United States has refused to negotiate with the PLO unless it recognizes the existence of Israel. The Israeli government, which also refuses to meet with the PLO, has opposed preliminary talks that ex­clude Israel. 
Appearing at a news conference 

with Muburak, Hussein said, "I share 
President Mubarak's feelings that 
the ( U.S.-Palestinian) dialogue he 
suggested is a very vital element for 
progress. 
"Once again, we are in the posi­tion of having made the first vital move. We have to wait for the reac­tion now." 
The two leaders spoke to reporters after 2% hours of talks. 
Correction 

Because of misinformation, the picture on yesterday's front page was incorrectly identified. The student pictured is Fred Don­nelly. 
Mubarak's proposal calls for the 
dialogue to be followed by talks in­
volving Israel, the United States and 
the joint delegation. Once the 
various sides have reached agree­
ment, an international conference 
including the five permanent U.N. 
Security Council members would be 
convened to ratify the settlement.

Beigel said.

He quoted Copeland as saying after the second death, "If this ever happened again, we would do every­thing possible to keep the patient going." 
The patient received a human heart in a transplant operation that began at midnight Tuesday, but did not do well following the operation and showed signs of instability. He suffered severe cardiac dysfunction about 3 a.m. yesterday which led to cardiac arrest.

Will there be nuclear war within next ten years? 
In recent weeks, I have twice come home from work and turned on the television to par­ticularly unsettling national evening news stories. Chronologically, the first concerned the unarmed Soviet cruise missile which strayed unintentionally over Norway and crashed in Finland during a naval training ex­ercise. The second, which followed the first by a mere week, concerned, as Maj. Michael 
Tom Walsh 
guest column 

Griffon ofthe 56th Field Artillery Brigade des: cribed it, the "unplanned rapid ignition of solic fuel" of a Pershing II booster rocket that had just arrived in West Germany. 
These incidents were disturbing because they confronted me in a dramatic way with the fallibility of the instruments which main­tain nuclear deterrence. They remind me of how, from out of the blue and perhaps acci­dentally, these instruments could upset the in­creasingly unstable "balance of terror" and cause unprecedented destruction. 
And they made me wonder if there might come the day when I will return home to the evening news story of a nuclear warhead detonation over some city or military installa­tion somewhere in the world -virtually every region on the globe could be attacked by the growing number of nuclear weapon states. It makes me contemplate world reaction in the wake ofsuch an event -the outrage, the cries for retaliation, the defensive "cornered animal" posture of the perpetrator, the pleas for reason and restraint and the fear that there will be none. 
I am reminded of the reaction to the downing of Korean Air lines Flight 007 and think how that tragedy would pale in compari­son. I realize that "under the wrong circum­stances and at the right time" it is possible that our United States could become, in the eyes of the rest of the world, the "evil empire" by being responsible -for whatever reason -for the first nuclear victims since 1945. I wonder how we Americans would feel about that. 
I learned, through the December 1984 issue of a publication called Nuclear Times that, in response to President Reagan's "we begin bombing in five minutes" microphone test last August, a message was transmitted from the Soviet Far East military headquarters at Vladivostock to a command station 50 miles further north saying "We now embark on mili­
tary action against U.S: forces." It was can­celled by a second message sent thirty minutes later. 
National Security Agency officials have ex­plained that a low-level Soviet officer who was not authorized to announce the alert had done so and that his order was subs;-quently countermanded by his superior. 
The NSA offcials referred to the half hour "war" as a non-event -no unusual Soviet mili­tary actions did occur. But I ttiink that it is worth recalling that low-ranking Soviet offi­cers may have been responsible for the downing ofKAL 007 in September of'83. Also, the decision to use forward-based short-and intermediate-range nuclear weapons in both East and West Europe could be made by relatively low-ranking commanders on the battlefield who, faced with imminent overrun by a surprise enemy thrust, must decide to either "use them or lose them." 
We may be fortunate that the president's joke precipitated only a "non-event." But this does not seem to me a reason to justify or ac­cept it, considering other possible conse­quences. 
I find it objectionable that the administration's proposed I986 budget would include about II00 of my federal tax dollars in its S313,700,000,000 military budget request. 
The administration has requested $2 tril­lion for the Pentagon for fiscal years I986-90. I understand that there are 6I,997,000 Ameri­can families, which translates into S32,03I from each. Our congressmen decide which weapon systems we all, ultimately, finance. I wonder if my SII00 bill for weapons such as the MX, Trident, Pershing and cruise missiles is buying security or fueling an unstable arms 
race. 

I came across a startling statistic recently which has prompted me to write all this. The Defense Monitor, which is published by the Center for Defense Information, currently 
· features proceedings from last September's first National Womens's Conference to Prevent Nuclear War. Helen Caldicott, Presi­dent Emeritus ofPhysicians for Social Respon­sibility and founder of Women's Action for Nuclear Disarmament, was quoted as follows: "Fifty per cent of the people under the age of 30 believe that nuclear war is going to occur within the next ten years." I think that is an incredible statistic. I would like to learn how it was generated. What do you think?

Emphasize the positive aspects of life and ND 
I can remember a time, in the not too dis­tant past, when I was drawing a picture of my family during second grade art. The art teacher instructed us on some techniques and allowed us to quickly complete our project for our show and tell demonstration at the end ofthe hour. My picture, ofcourse, consistedof the usual stick figures colored with the most unique colors I could find -black, brown and

guest column 

purple. At show and tell, I was first and pre­sented my "Mona Usa," explicating the ad­vanced color scheme I employed. 
This insignificant memory probably would have passed by now if it were not for my class-1 mate Iggy -Ignatius, that is. Iggy was last that day, as he most often was, and stood timidly as he presented his picture. Iggy could draw · boy, could he draw. He used pencils instead of crayons and managed to create the most real­istic drawing in the class. However, there was something aesthetically disturbing about his family portrait. Mom and Dad were centered on the page, his sisters, Jill and Suzy, on the right and Iggy far offto the left. There was also a rather large oval in the left hand corner with no apparent connection to the drawing. Upon closer examination, it was clear that the oval was part oflggy's body, his right foot. Nothing was said, and we all went out to play. 
At the time, I was unaware of the sig­nificance conveyed through that drawing. It.. was onlylater that I realized the dreadful story of Iggy's life. Iggy had a disfigurement known as a "club foot." The disability makes it diffi­cult to walk and impossible to play any sort of sport. What was worse was the name that my friends and I called Iggy-"Clubber." 
It has become shamefully clear to me that Iggy viewed himself as a deformed foot. His drawing was merely a graphical representa­tion of his observed self-image as mostly foot and not much ofa human being. This memory will remain with me always and will remind me of my ignorance and my contribution to his low sense ofself-identity. 
Just as I will never forget Iggy and his story, never again will I allow such an event to oc­cur. Yet, after one year at Notre Dame, I can see myself and the community faltering as I did II years ago. Today, it is not Ignatius who is labeled, nor any other person but, rather, our University. Today, there are many issues facing us at Notre Dame: the alcohol policy, student government, social life, administra­tion, food, Catholicism and Lent. The only ig­
nominy that has not been considered are 
those repulsive, pale yellow candles in the 
Grotto. 
Most other objections to Notre Dame have arisen, as the pages of The Observer would attest. There is certainly a need to discuss is­sues that face us, but there is also a danger to complain incessantly about them. It is the same danger that resulted in Iggy's low self­esteem. By emphasizing the negative aspects of Notre Dame, there is a tendency to per­ceive this University as a repelling place, void of justice and, more importantly, unworthy of the great qualities which make Notre Dame the finest institution in the nation. <:!' 
For myself, a lasting impression has remained with me since my arrival at Notre Dame in August of'84. Maybe it began when I was greeted on the sidewalk by a young lady I did not know -or at least I thought I didn't know her! 
My suspicion was confirmed, however, when the trend continued and people started opening doors for me. Mind you, this may be common practice in the midwest, but all this friendliness put an Arizonan like myself into shock. 
Anyhow, after I recovered, I finally con­cluded that these were genuine people, some­what interested in my well-being and not interested exclusively in my roommates for 


Presidents have really big toys 
Ronald really liked those "Star Wars" movies. After he saw the first three films, he hardly could wait for the six future episodes promised by Hollywood. The movies were such a hit that Americans everywhere were familiar with the daring Han Solo and the

guest column 

young, impulsive Luke Skywalker. 
Luke was Ronald's secret hero. In the third film, the invincible Luke, strengthened and protected by The Force, finally terminated the evil Darth Vader with his laser wand. Ronald thought that was great. It was just too bad the dying Darth Vader turned out to be Luke's fa­ther, a good man who got mixed up with the wrong crowd. 
Well, when the movies got to be very popular, "Star Wars" toys started appearing on department store shelves. Soon, American family rooms were cluttered with little plastic Yodas and R2D2s, Luke Skywalkers and Darth Vaders with tiny laser wands and model space stations complete with fighter aircraft. For lots of kids, make-believe games in backyards brought the wildly fantastic "Star Wars" world to life. 
Ronald wanted to play, too. But Ronald was really a bit too old for backyard fun with Mat­tel toys. And besides, such games are not befit­ting for the president of the United States, which was what Ronald was. Ronald was sad, for he was a good American who liked the "Star Wars" movies as much as anybody and dreamed -like the other kids -of taking laser­beam-shooting aircraft on attacks against the Evil Empire. 
Ronald had a problem. 
But, luckily for Ronald, he was the presi­dent. He could make up his own games, and he could usually get most of his friends to play along with him. Ronald and his friends would 
let the other kids play with their dinky Mattei toys. They were going for the real thing. You see, the president can usually get what he wants because he knows a lot ofsmart people and has a lot ofrich friends. 
So Ronald convinced his smart buddies to start designing and building him some big, real-live "Star Wars" stuff. They did not have to worry about the cost, for Ronald was going to go visit his rich friends' house to get S25 billion. Ifthey did not have that much money, Ronald was sure that they would go out and get it somehow -he knew they were ready to beg, borrow and steal for him. Ronald was get­ting pretty excited. At last, his dreams about battling the Evil Empire were going to come true. 
Or so he thought. 
But Ronald's smart frier.ds, no matter how hard they tried, just could not put together much more than giant toys. They figured out how to make the space stations, and they were pretty sure they could get the stations up into space. That alone would cost quite a bit; Ronald's rich friends would have to come up with some more money. But even then, the smart guys could not figure out how the movie makers had worked all those laser beams. It had looked so easy at the theater. 
But Ronald's friends decided this was no big problem. They knew Ronald would be pretty excited just to have the biggest toys of all ­even if they were just for games of make-believe. ·

an SYR date. The strong friendships I have 
developed during the past seven months fur­
ther attest to the quality and depth that can be 
found and experienced at Notre Dame. 
Depth and quality also seem to permeate much of campus life, especially in school pride, athletics, Glee Club Christmas con­certs, the World Hunger Coalition, JPW, Freshman trip to the Dunes, Logan Center, Sat­urday tutoring, Keenan Revue and countless other events and groups. 
Furthermore, Notre Dame is an institution rooted in God and directed toward the educa­tion of the whole person. Through its liberal ideals, it stresses the importance and the in­trinsic goodness ofman and prepares students to bear this message to mankind. Finally, Notre Dame distinctly prepares one to make an individual contribution to enhance the quality oflife on earth. 
As I see it, Notre Dame is a composition ofa great institution and a great family. It is this combination that makes Notre Dame a truly unique place and the finest university in America. I am glad and proud to be here be­cause I am Notre Dame, you are Notre Dame, we are Notre Dame!

Know the complicity of institutional sexism 
Early last month, while driving to Marion, Indiana, I tuned into a fundamentalist radio station where someone calling himself Pastor John was delivering a mighty sermon on Christian marriage. Some days later, 1 came across the first volume of the Ahfad Journal, published by Ahfad College for Women, Om­durman, Sudan. Its lead article was on the widespread practice in the Sudan of the most

radical form offemale circumcision called in­
fibulation. 

Then, last week, 1 read in the New York 
Times that a Reagan appointee, John D. Fed­
ders, described as the 'top cop' at the Security 
Exchange Commission, had been divorced by 
his wife. He had beaten her on a number of 
occasions, once while she was pregnant, and 
another time he broke her eardrum. In that 
same week, it came to my attention that the 
U.S. Catholic Bishops are to go into session shortly to prepare a pastoral on women. 
I have grouped these seemingly disparate stories together. because each one tells us something about male violence towards wo­men. 
I will start with PastorJohn, who had some firm things to say about marriage. He had lifted from St. Paul a primitive anthropology in which a rigid hierarchy obtained. The wife's role was to obey and serve her husband and attend to the children. Her top priority, said Pastor John, was to nurture the fragile male ego so that her man could keep competing in this dog eat dog world. It was an honest, if crude, rendering of the ideology that has cloaked the sacrament ofChristian marriage. 
In his book "Transformations," Roger Gould, a professor of psychiatry at ICLA, has given a succinct account of the land-mines buried in Pastor John's model of traditional

War heroes teach the meaning of self-giving 
DearEditor: 

The hero has lived for years in the minds of Americans as one who not only deserves respect but who also deserves admiration. Every hero possesses a characteristic which
r 
r deserves emulation. 
r However, the admiration these people receive not only rewards them but also can r teach others. By examining the ideal qualities ~ these people possess, hopefully we can irn· r prove ourselves. After all, without living ex­r amples ofcourage, dedication or loyalty, how 
r 
, 
are we to strive for-such virtues or even know 
r what they really are? 
' In this respect, John Neblo's Viewpoint column titled "War veterans deserve thanks, not admiration" disturbs me greatly. In his column, Neblo claims, "We cannot afford to give them (the veterans) our adulation" be­cause, "heroism propagates war." Neblo ap­pears to hold a pretty dim view of America's intelligence. He seems to think that the ad­miration of war heroes -the veterans -will over-glorify war itself and send us into war more readily in the future. 
marriage. It encourages malignant con­spiracies of dependency. In traditional mar­riage, says Gould, the division of labor becomes a division into two alien and mutually exclusive worlds with a superior, independent-appearing male_and an inferior, dependent-appearing female. To be sure, un­der this arrangement, the man pays a price in emotional underdevelopment. Still, he does retain control and the power ofthe purse, and he enjoys the stimuli ofthe outside world. The woman is more disabled under this dispensa­tion. 
The closed, sheltered world of the tradi­tional wife does her enormous damage ­created in the image of God, she usually knows with part of herself that she deserves more than domestic servitude. Statistics reveal that the traditional wife is the greatest gobbler of Valium in western society. Closer to home, I have some first hand knowledge of several breakdowns oftraditional wives in the Notre Dame community. 
The violence that is female circumcision would seem to be in a class ofits own. Infibula­tion ( Pharoanic circumcision) involves the removal of the entire clitoris, the labia rninoria and the labia majoria, leaving the two raw edges to adhere, which produces a length-wise scar. Circumcision deprives wo­men ofsexual pleasure and brings in its wake punishing complications. The Ahfed Journal reports that a great many Sudanese women are circumcised in this way. The cultural reasons given for the practice are to ensure virginity at the time of marriage. Sudanese men are also said to prefer circumcised wo­men. The procedure enhances woman's value as property. 
This practice shocks us because it is not our way ofdoing violence to women -our society has chosen different modes, but they are all on the same continuum. As far as I know, Sudanese men have not developed dishonest, philosophic or theological defences of the practice. When the Vatican circumcised the 
collective psyche of women in its I977 state­
ment, which stated that because women bore 
no natural resemblence to Jesus they could 
not serve the church as ordained ministers, a 
great deal of philosophical and theological 
cant, masquerading as argument, was mar­
shalled in support ofthe statement. 
Now consider the case of John Fedders, wife-beater. Again the violence was direct and physical -this time it grew out of a western devaluation ofwomen which has made the in­visible and saddled them with negative des­criptions ofthemselves. When a man· is yoked to a spouse whose humanity has been denigrated as different, inferior and less pow­erful by the dominant cultural and religious traditions, the inexorable result will be an un­easy ambivalence on the man's part. Am­bivalence, in moments ofrage or anxiety, may well be expressed as aggression or downright hostility. 

Nowadays, it is customary to scoff at those descriptions of women provided by our venerable Catholic traditon. An early church father, Tertullian, thought women were the gateway to hell. Thomas Aquinas pronounced them misbegotten males, and St. Augustine said something equally horrid which my psyche is busy repressing right now. Not surprisingly, as the patriarchy defends its ram· parts, these old caricatures are once more being trotted out. 
Last year, a prominent, reactionary Catholic intellectual, in an article on 'Woman Church' managed to accuse emancipated Catholic wo­men of depravity, sexual licentiousness, poli­tical and cultural anarchy and intellectual inadequacy. It was an astonishing litany of the age-old fears that men have harbored about women. Interestingly, this man speaks in a charming falsetto. I have often wondered if this "female" characteristic has wounded mas­culinity. Could he have upped the ante on wo­men to prove his legitimacy w1th the good old boys? 
Last, but not least, we have the case of the 

On the contrary, by seeing just what our heroes endured and the sacrifices they made, we come to a better understanding ofexactly how horrible war actually is, and we strive to avoid it at all costs. We can also learn the meanfng ofcourage, loyalty and self-sacrifice. After all, what could be more courageous and loyal than giving one's life for a cause? 
Certainly, then, our veterans deserve more than just our respect and thanks. They deserve the praise we would give to any hero who, through his or her actions, helps mold the values of our nation -a nation striving for peace.

I realize that many ofthe students out there are questioning as to why "Tank MacNamara" was replaced by "Zeto".

to explain why the strip "Zeto" deserves a fair 
chance. In 1979, a man by the name ofJack 
Zeto entered the University. As a Carroll Hall 
Vermin, he exemplified the true Notre Dame­
Vermin spirit. In his freshman year he finished 
a close second in UMOC. It was then that the 

craze started. The word "zeto" was soon writ­
ten on every frosted window, in the snow and 
all across the University. The Vermin tradition 
still carries on today. 
During the next two years Zeto declined to run for UMOC but, during his senior year, the craze began again, and a new phrase arose: "Jack is back." Although Zeto was not om-· cially on the ballot, he again finished second for UMOC, this time as a write-in. But Zeto was more than someone who just ran for UMOC, he exemplified what it meant to do just enough to pass and in the remaining time, party to the fullest extent possible. Zeto was no normal human being, his accomplishments were many, most of which cannot be men­tioned in print. Although Zeto is longgone, his presence lives on. His name is often men­tioned in such distinguished company as Rockne, Sorin and Hesburgh. In Carroll Hall. his legend is so powerful that a sophomore who has never met Zeto was moved enough to name his strip after him. In conclusion, I would like to state that because this new strip is named after another Notre Dame legend, it deserves a fair chance.

Sacred Heart is at heart of liturgical renewal 
DearEditor: 
As members of the Notre Dame Chapel 

Choir, who participate weekly in the 10:30 
liturgy at Sacred Heart, we would like to 
respond to the inappropriate accusations that 
appeared in last week's editorial column. 
The community of Sacred Heart was asked by the American Bishop's Council to broad­cast the Palm Sunday liturgy because Notre Dame is recognized as the national center of liturgical study and renewal. After much de­liberation, it was decided that it would be in 
the best interest of the American Catholic community to broadcast the Palm Sunday liturgy, despite the inconveniences to the Sa­cred Heart parish. 
misogynist bishops. The U.S. Bishops' Confer­
ence has announced that work will begin, in 
mid-March, on a pastoral on women. Ameri· can Catholic women, both religious and lay it seems, have made such a nuisance demanding equality in the church, that they have qualified as a bona fide problem, like nuclear arms, the deficit or economic mal· distribution. 
The trouble is that the bishops have it the wrong way around, or 'arse over tip' as my Chaucerian Marna would say. Let me illustrate this point by way of analogy. Whites in South Africa claim to have a 'black problem'; yet those of us who have not been gulled by racist propaganda know that it is not the blacks who have the problem but namely a minority, white racist government which defines them­in language not very different to that used by the church to define women -and controls them. 
The bishops are an impervious bunch when it comes to women, so we can expect them to balk, once again, at confession. Instead ofack· nowledging their complicity in institutional sexism -the sin which is tearing the church apart -the bishops will no doubt wind up trying to mollify women through small ameliorations, which cost nothing. 
Sometimes, 1 daydream about sending all their lordships on a long retreat, with but one text to meditate on-Mark I0:42-44: "So Jesus called them to him and said to them, and said to them, 'You know that among the pagans their so-called rulers lord it over them, and their great men make their authority felt. This is not to happen among you. No; anyone who wants to become great among you must be your servant, and anyone who wants to be first among you must be slave to all."' 
AnnPettifer is an alumna ofthe University ofNotre Dame. 
We feel that Father Dan Jenky has handled 
this situation in an outstanding manner, even 
when confronted with the difficulties in­
volved in carrying out this service. 
Father Jenky has proven his excellence in 
ministering to.,the Sacred Heart community 
and establising a progressive and meaningful 
mass, while utilizing the richness ofthe Catho­
lic tradition.

Tim Kempton will only be strong if fans let him 
DearEditor: 
Ifyou listen to the words of our fight song carefully, I am pretty sure you will not hear "Cheer, cheer for old Notre Dame till they put Kempton into the game," but some people think these words are right as shown by the chorus of boos that accompanied Tim Kempton as he entered the game against Washington last Sunday. 
The fans at the ACC have always been de­manding, which is one of the reasons we are so competitive, but there is a big difference between being demanding of our team and undermining its confidence. We definitely un­dermined Kempton's confidence last Sunday­he played tentatively and whenever he got the ball he got rid ofit as ifit were somethingfrom a dining hall theme nigbt. 
It is obvious that Kempton had less than a perfect season, but without him we would not even be close to an NCAA bid this year. For us to play well in the tournament, it is terribly important that Tim Kempton play well, and that is going to be be tough enough without ten thousand fans on his back. If fans still have a problem with the way he is playing and feel the need to voice it, maybe they should call him up and talk about it, for at least that would show their support and honesty as opposed to jeering him during the game. 
The crowd has always been an important sixth man for us in horne games, so let's use that sixth man against the opposition instead of ourselves. We have got to show the team our true support and loyalty until the end if we hope to do well. I know that sounds trite, but it is not as trite as the NIT.

Notre Dame swimmers end season at Midwest Invitational in Chicago 
ByDAVE WILSON 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame Head Swimming Coach Dennis Stark and nine of his top swimmers begin final season competition today, as the Irish par­ticipate in the Midwest Invitational Championships in Chicago. The meet, which runs through Saturday, will close out the 1984-85 season for the Irish. 
"We're looking more at the indi­vidual performances this time around," said Stark. "I think we can expect some excellent swimming, especially from our seniors." 
Stark is looking to senior co­captains Brian Casey and Timothy Bohdan to finish among the top swimmers. In the Midwestern City Conference championships three weeks ago, Casey garnered two second-place finishes in the 100­yard and 200-yard butterfly, and was fourth in the 400-yard individual medley. Bohdan contributed second-place finishes in the ZOO­yard backstroke and 400-yard med­ley relay, and anchored both of the free relays for the Irish. The team finished second to Evansville in that competition. 
Two other seniors to make the travelling squad are Paul Benz and diver Mike Kennedy. Benz turned in two strong backstroke races in the Midwestern meet, and is expected to repeat the performance in the 1 00-yard backstroke this weekend. Kennedy, likewise, is coming off an impressive victory in the three­meter diving competition, and has been a consistent participant in one­meter diving as well. 
"Our strongest swimmer besides our seniors just may be John Koselka," continued Stark. "We're a small team, but again, I think we'll be more concerned with our individual performances than with a team vic­tory. There'll be some tough compe­tition up there." 
Koselka, a freshman, specializes in the SO-yard freestyle. Rounding out the nine-member squad wil be junior John Coffey, who swims the 200-yard freestyle and breaststroke; freshman Jeff Grace, a medley and relay swimmer; junior Blaise Har­ding, a breaststroke swimmer; and sophomore Chris Green, who turned in a powerful second-place finish in the 400-yard individual relay at the Midwestern meet. 
"We finished eighth out of nine teams at last year's Midwest Invita­tional, and I hope we can improve on that," said Stark. "You just don't know who will accept the invita­tions until you arrive at the meet. I would expect to see Western Ken­tucky in the competition again." 
Western Kentucky, the meet's defending champion, should be joined by Eastern Kentucky, Nor­thern Iowa, Bradley, Southwest Mis­souri State, and a number ofschools from Illinois, including host Univer­sity ofIllinois-Chicago.

"When I said that, I meant it," Scheer said. "I thought the team would respond more favorably than it did. I thought if I could take some pressure off that maybe it would help. The team continued to show no progress. 
"I don't expect Don Chaney to work miracles," Scheer said. "He has an opportunity in 21 games to see if he can turn the team around. I won't think about (a coach for) next season until after this season." 
Chaney, who played guard, was known for his defense and play­making rather than his shooting skills. He was a member of NBA championship teams with the Bos­ton Celtics in 1969 and 1974. 
Following his retirement as an ac­tive player, he joined the Detroit Pistons as an assistant coach to Scotty Robertson. He held that post until Robertson was dismissed as head coach in the summer of 1983. 
Tose agrees to sell Eagles to auto dealer 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -After trying for months to sell a minority interest in his Philadelphia Eagles, Leonard Tose has agreed to sell out entirely to Miami auto dealer Norman Braman for S6S million, a source close to the NFL team said yesterday. 
Tose, reportedly S42 million in 
debt, has been trying to sell a share 
ofthe National Football League fran­
chise for more than a year, but in­
sisted on retaining control in 
previous negotiations with 
prospective buyers. 
He faces a deadline ofApril 1 on a 
n 2 million note from the Crocker 
Bank of California, which has 
threatened to foreclose on the 
Eagles ifTose defaults . 
Tose and his daughter, Susan Fletcher, who is the Eagles vice pres­ident and general counsel, were both in Miami Wednesday, reportedly closing the deal . 
Any deal to sell the team would need approval from 21 ofthe 28 NFL team owners, who will meet Mon­day in Phoenix. League spokesman Jim Heffernan said the approval process would start with a back­ground check of any new owner, once Tose served notice of an im­pending sale.

Women 
continuedfrom page 16 
Even with the pro6ability of a 20­win season (they have one game remaining, at Xavier this Saturday) the Irish still must be considered a long-shot selection for the 3.2-team field in the women's NCAA Tourna­ment simply because there are so many quality teams and only 14 at­large bids available. (The North Star Conference, in only its second year ofexistence, does not yet receive an automatic tournament bid.) But yes­terday's performance undoubtedly gave the tournament selection com­mittee a message it couldn't ignore. · "I think this game showed them (the committee) that this is a team that has to be looked at," said Irish coach Mary DiStanislao. "The con­ference title is a big confidence builder for this team -it proves that this program has arrived. I hope we won't be penalized too badly for our early-season losses, because this team is really playing well now. We've dominated the conference statistically, and we won the confer­ence in convincing fashion. We've established that we're the best team in the conference." 
Some might have questioned that claim in the early going of yester-

day's game, as the Irish topped the Flyers by just two points, 13-1 1, aft~:r 12 minutes of play. Dayton's 6­.2 Michele Kruty, 6-5 Theresa Yin­gling, and 6-1 Monica West were giving the Irish fits on the boards, and even Notre Dame's full-court pressure was not having much of an effect. 
But as the half wore on, Trena Keys started to heat up, and Notre Dame's leading scorer boosted her team to a nine-point halftime lead al-

most singk-handedly, scoring 1 1 of the last 1 5 Irish points in the half. At intermission Keys had 1 5 points, and looked to be in for a big day. Schueth, on the 'other hand, wasn't making many pleasant memories for herself in her last home game. In 12 first-half minutes, the senior co­captain was scoreless, as were class­mates Kaiser and Dougherty. 
"I was pretty angry with myself after the first half," said Schueth, "because I knew I wasn't playing well and Iwasn't doing much to help the team. I just concentrated on going out in the second half and playing aggressively, and crashing the boards. I just wanted to get into the flow of the game." 
Things started going more accor­ding to script in the second half, as Schueth, Kaiser, and Dougherty all began to get into the flow of the game. The Irish came out ofthe lock­erroom on track, outscoring the Flyers, 12-4, over the first seven minutes to take a 40-23 lead. Schueth scored four of those points, and Kaiser's steal and breakaway layup put the finishing touches on the streak that gave the Irish some breathing room. After Dayton cut the gap to 12 points a few minutes later, Schueth (five points) and Kaiser (four points) keyed a 9-0 spurt that put the Irish back in com­mand, 49-28. Notre Dame's lead grew as large as 29 points in the second half before Dayton put on a late scoring spree to dose the gap. 
"In the first half we seemed to be affected by the emotion ofthis being the seniors' last home game, and I think that made us a little sluggish," said DiStanislao. "But I've told our players all year long that defense is what wins games, it's what puts the bread on the table. We shut Dayton down over two critical stretches, and that's what we needed to do to win. 
"Our seniors made an important contribution. Mary Beth was in foul trouble early on, but she came on well in the second half; she's always been a player that you have to con­tend with. Laura did a good job of passing, shooting, and handling the ball. and Ruth came on to give us a needed spark -her big plays iced the game for us." 
Schueth finished with 17 points and six rebounds, while Kaiser con­ributed six points, five rebounds, three assists and four steals, and Dougherty added four points and three steals. Keys led all scorers with 19 points.

Now before you start telling me
Sophomores and Freshmen 
how hypocritical I am supporting this kind of event after lambasting the violent behavior in sport last week, let's make two things per­fectly clear. First ofall, fighting is the object ofthis sport, unlike the exam­ples given last week. Second, and most importantly, the Bengal Bouts are for a good cause, as all the money raised goes to support the Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh. 
This is a fine charity event and al­ways a popular one with the stu­dents. There have been plenty of hard-hitting bouts in the first two rounds, and the finals promises more of the same. Come on out and see the action Friday night under the geodesic dome ofStepan Center.

The 1984-85 hockey season is now history. And after the early excitement surrounding the pro­gram's return to varsity, the season itselfwas clearly marked by its share of ups and downs. 
And for Irish seniors Brent Chap­
man, Steve Ely, AI Haverkamp, Tom 
Parent, Tim Reilly and Rob Ricci -it 
was not just a season, but a career of 
ups and downs. 
It was the class of 1985 that saw 
two years of CCHA action drift into 
oblivion as the program was 
dropped to club level last season. 
They were then able to experience 
the return to varsity with the hope 
that the program is now on its way 
back to respectability. 
"It was a hard step down sopho­
more year from the CCHA," said 
Reilly. "Playing club hockey was 
definitely the worst part of my 
hockey experience. 
"This year was such a turnaround. 
It wasn't like going back to the 
CCHA, but it was such a step over 
club. We didn't win as much as we 
would have liked, but I think we 
opened a few eyes ofalumni and ad­
ministrators that we can turn this 
program around." 
"We were 11-16-1, but we knew it 
would be a rough season with the 
new level of competition," contin­
ued Ricci. "When we lost eight in a 
row (Dec. 8-Jan. 19), though, we 
never thought it would end. 
Everybody was pretty down." 
Over that stretch, Notre Dame played Lake Forest (twice), Prince­ton, Yale, Colgate, Holy Cross, Alaska-Fairbanks and Bowdoin. The losses to Yale and Colgate were in the Phoenix Mutual Hockey Classic in Hartford. The Irish lost once to Lake Forest and to Bowdoin in the Forester Classic at Lake Forest. 
At Hartford, Yale took apart a young Irish squad 10-5 in the first round. Colgate then added further misery by pounding Notre Dame, 13-4, in the consolation game. But after all was said and done, all six seniors agreed that the experience gained in Hartford was invaluable. 
"l),ven though the scores in the Phoenix didn't show it, I think it made us a better team," said Parent. "It showed us what we need to prepare for if we're ever to get Notre Dame hockey back to a regular Divi­sion I level." 
"Playing the teams that we did out 
East really helped to show people 
that Notre Dame hockey was really 
back," added Haverkamp. "Like I 
think everybody would agree, they 
weren't our best performances, but 
just being there and not giving up 
showed that we meant business." 
Varsity action returned to Notre 
Dame on a ·high note back in early 
November as the Irish skated by 
their guest Penn State by convincing 
8-2 and 10-3 scores. But it was after 
tjlat first weekend that the reality of 
varsity hockey began to hit home. 
The Irish then embarked on two 
straight weekends away from home 
where they dropped 5-4 and 6-3 
decisions to Michigan-Dearborn, fol­
lowed by 10-3 and 7-6 defeats at the 
hands of St. Thomas College in St. 
Paul, Minn. 

"Things started out rough at first," 
said Chapman. "The losses on the 
road really woke us up. But it still 
took a loss to Alaska-Anchorage and 
a split with Air Force to get us going 
again. Even through it all, everyone 
was happy to have the tougher 
schedule." 

Taking the tougher schedule into 
account, the Irish found great diffi­
culty winning away from the 
friendly confines of the ACC. In 13 
games, Notre Dame won just once 
(Marquette) and tied once 
(Alabama-Huntsville). 

Still, an encouraging factor that 
managed to shine through -road 
losses aside -was the fact that of the 
16 losses, five were by just one goal 
and five more were by three goals or 
less. 

"We have to give our freshmen 
(seven played regular roles) a lot of 
credit for the successes that we 
had," said Ely. "They came in during 
a tough transition that affected all of 
us. We as veterans were trying to get 
re-acquainted with varsity hockey, 
and this made it tough at times for us 
to try and orient them to the new 
level ofplay. 

"I know how important this type 
of guidance is from my own fresh­
man year. We had a serious crop of seniors that we looked up to like we thought we'd never be seniors. Then suddenly, we're on top and it's neat to have been able to return that same kind of help that we got." 
The season was also marked by 
significant personal achievements 
by three Irish seniors. 
It was Nov. 30, 86 games into the 
career of Rob Ricci when he finally 
scored his first collegiate goal. "I'll 
never forget that moment," he said 
with a big smile. "But then again, 
how can you forget something that 
only happens once every four 
years?" 
When Reilly picked up his 36th as­
sist of the season on Feb. 22, he 
became the leader for assists in a 
season by a right wing, overtaking 
the record set by Ian Williams 
during the 72-73 season. 
For the last game, Chapman then 
saved what was probably the 
season's most notable achievement. 
On Feb. 23, late in the third period, 
the co-captain from Agincourt, On­
tario, scored his 105th career goal 
and became the all-time leading goal 
scorer, surpassing Greg Meredith. 
Off the ice, Parent was accepted 
to medical school and Haverkamp 
was granted admission to law 
school. Reilly, Ricci and Ely are all 
engaged to be married. Chapman 
and Reilly are both hoping for admis­
sion to the Notre Dame MBA pro­
gram. 
As the season began to reach its climax, the Irish were out to end things in high style, and they did just that. Notre Dame had managed to put all of the low points aside and pull all of the season's hard work to­gether and finish with five straight wins. 
"It was great to end it like we did," said Ely. "As seniors, we just hope that this will be a positive step for years to come. 
"But just the same, as seniors, it's time for us to sit back and try to get the"full picture ofwhat hockey really meant. We have to look past this year to see where we started, where we've gone, the high and low points that seemed like life and death at the time and then try to figure out where we're at and where we're going. A lot ofthose thoughts will be personal, but many will be directed at the hope that we helped do some­thing that will bring back Irish hockey for all to enjoy.",

all the aforementioned factors, and some other assorted information, such as the relation of Venus with the north star and the colors of the mood rings of the committee mem­bers. The best thing for the Irish to do right now is just worry about defeating Dayton, and that's what Digger Phelps will be emphasizing this week. To some extent, the Irish control their own destiny, and if Notre Dame gets its win, the rest will fall into place on Sunday. 
Pick ofthe Week .. Most of the action this week has not been at the ACC, but at Stepan Center where the Bengal Bouts are being held. The finals of the 55th annual campus event will take place Friday night, with the first bout beginning at 7:30

After running the clock down to

with 2:28 gone to give the Irish a 4-0 lead, Kempton asserted himself. But a key moment came with S:3S left, when he fouled Copa after Mar­quette had come back to take a 20­19 lead on the Irish. Copa did not take kindly to the way in which the foul was delivered, and a bit of a 
scuffle followed between the two. 
It seemed to be just the spark 
Kempton needed to get going. 
"(Marquette) was a tough team, a very physical team," he said. "But we matched up well height-wise, and I was just glad they let us play. We were able to muscle them inside, and that's my kind ofgame." 
As the first half wound down, strong play by Kempton inside against sudden enemy Copa helped the Irish move out to a 33-Z6lead. 
And when the buzzer sounded· for the beginning of the second half, he did not disappoint anyone. Two jumpers from the free-throw line

score's tied and they have to take a timeout. We accomplished our ob­jective. We got a layup, but we missed it." Marquette center Wal­ter Downing fouled Royal as the ball rolled off the rim. Royal was ice, hit­ting both ends of a one-and-one making it 64-60. 
The rest was icing on the cake as 
Rivers went coast-to-coast and semi­
dunked the ball as time ran out. 
It was the number of trips to the line that made the difference. Mar­quette only found its way to the charity strip 21 times, while Phelps' Irish took 42 foul shots. 
Our offense was our foul shoot­ing," said Phelps, "and we try to do that to teams we can get inside on. At the end of the game we just missed our foul shots; that's how Marquette got back in it. That's not like Duff to miss two, and Royal was shooting so well he was due to miss." 
Whereas, Phelps was pleased with the .32 free throws made, Majerus wasn't quite so pleased with the free throw differential. He apoarentlv 
and a great deal of hustle within the first seven minutes helped Notre Dame increase its lead to I0 points. 
A strong drive to the basket with 
I I:26 left in the half led to two foul shots, both of which he converted. 
The most surprising event of the evening transpired with 4:40 left in the game, with the Irish clinging to an eight-point lead. Unable to get the ball into anyone else's hands due to the Warriors' quick press, Kempton quickly proceeded to turn himself into a 6-9 guard and bring the ball upcourt himself. 
And throughout all of it, he con­tinuously frustrated Downing and Copa inside with his strong defense. 
But perhaps the most pleasing moment of the game for Kempton came when he took a seat on the bench in favor ofJim Dolan midway through the second half, as he heard cheers from the Irish fans for the first time in recent memory. 
"It has hurt a little bit to hear the fans when they get down on me, es­pecially the home fans," said Kempton. "But I know I just have to perform :well. It's just a matter of

was disgusted at the officiating most 
of the game, but declined to talk 
about it. Instead, he alluded to some 
of the home-town calls. 
"I'm not going to comment on the officiating," said Majerus. "But they shot 42 foul shots to our 21. It's hard to believe a guy shot 18 foul shots and only took three shots." 
Majerus was referring to Royal, who went 0-3 from the t1eld, but connected on I '5 of 18 from the line. The sophomore also pulled down I'5 boards for the game.

"The stats are misleading," Phelps said. "We only got six field goals and 12 shots because we were on the foul line the whole second half. With 
1.3 minutes to go we're already in the bonus. The rebounding margin is our game (the Irish had a 34-2.3 margin). Rebound and pound it inside, if we score, we score; if not, we go to the foul line."

"I was happy with the game," he 
continued. "It gives me confidence 
as we enter the post-season. I've just 
been thinking about my game too 
much, and maybe I lost some of my 
confidence. I was glad to have a 
game like this. 
"Coach Phelps does a lot for hi~ players that most people don't realize. He and the coaching staff really were trying to pump me up when I was down. And they really helped me out a lot. I just want to play my best for them, and that's what I set out to do each game." 
"Timmy did a lot ofpositive things at both ends of the floor tonight," said Phelps. "That's why I've always believed in him. I always try to keep­him pumped up, even though he goes through some negatives sometimes as far as the fan reaction goes. 
"I just was very, very happy to fi­nally see him play the way he played tonight."

Majerus wanted to keep his squad out of foul trouble, but the early bonus situation reflected Mar­quette's inability to do that. Three Warriors fouled out, and with a thin bench and Tony Reeder injured, if another person fouled out Majerus would really have had problems. 
"We didn't have anyone else to substitute," said Majerus, "if we lost another guy on fouls." 
Kempton had a good perfor­mance, hitting all four of his shots from the field and connecting on '5 of 7 from the line for 13 points. Rivers had a typically exciting per­formance, but he also kept his ex­high school teammate Johnson running in circles much of the night. Johnson had I Z points for the War­riors, whi.le Rivers connected for 20. Barlow never really got in the groove and only took five shots for the game. That had Phelps worried. 
"Barlow has to be a threat on Sat­urday (against Dayton). He needs to get more active on the offensive boards and more active in looking for a shot. He'll get back into it before its over." 
Barlow was far from his I '5.4 points per game; the junior con­nected on only two field goals and four foul shots for eight points. 
This victory should help Notre Dame's chances for an NCAA bid. But don't ask Phelps about it -it's a touchy subject. 
'Tm not making any comments about the NCAA tournament," said Phelps. 'Til leave that up to the com­mittee. We're very happy to have 19 wins at this stage of the season and we can make it 20 Saturday. We're just thinking about Dayton." 
Thank God for free throws or it would be 18 wins.

Irish hold off Warriors for important 66-60 win 
Royal, Kempton keep hopes alive for NCAA Tournament 
ByJOE BRUNEm 

Sports Writer 
Luckily, for Digger Phelps, his players made it to the foul line -of­ten. If they hadn't, they wouldn't 'have their I9th win. The 66-60 win over Marquelte was much needed, and the Irish escaped, by the skin of their teeth, because ofrepeated trips to the line. 
The win wasn't pretty, but Phelps didn't really care. As far as he is con· cerned, a win is a win. 
"Going into tonight's game, we looked to do two things," Phelps commented after the game. "We wanted to extend our defense and pound the ball inside and get to the foul line. We did a good job with that, and we figured that that strat· egy played our strength against their weakness. 
"All you want to do is win the game. It's our 19th win and it means we swept Marquette. I would have been happy to win this game by one." 
Well, Phelps' squad almost only did win by one. The six-point margin doesn't reflect what a tight game it really was down the stretch. 
After two Donald Royal free throws opened a 62-52 Notre Dame margin with 2:52 left in the game, Marquette guard MandyJohnson hit a 12-footer from the right side to narrow the margin to eight with 2:37left. 
Dan Duff then missed the first shot 
of a one-and-one for the Irish. Mar· 
queue, gaining some steam, 
narrowed the margin to six when 

forward Kerry Trotter, who had a game-high 23 points, hit a field goal in the lane. Tim Kempton tried to in­bound the ball, but good coverage prevented that, and the Irish were called for five seconds · Marquette ball. Then things got hairy. 
After Marquelte coach Rick Majerus called time, Johnson came

Kempton silences his critics with year's best performance 

By ERIC SCHEUERMANN 
Sports Writer 
Throughout the year, Notre Dame center Tim Kempton has not had many opportunities to smile. But after a strong performance in last night's game that helped lead the Irish to victory over the scrappy Marquette Warriors, it was a differ­ent story. 
"I thought I played tonight," said 
Kempton. "I thought it was probably 
my best game of the year." 

Many Irish fans would most likely agree, fans who have suffered through a few games in which Kempton did almost nothing right. 
But last night, except for being called for traveling twice, it seemed as if Kempton did nothing wrong. He collected 13 points on 4-for-4 from the field and 5-for-7 from the free throw line. He pulled down four rebounds. And, perhaps most impor­tant, he played a key role in holding Walter Downing and Tom Copa, Marquette's big men inside, to a total of 16 points. 
"We wanted to pound the ball inside," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps after the game. "That was our objective. We thought it was a weak­ness for Marquette defensively, and a strength for us offensively. And Kempton helped us do that. 
''I'll tell you," continued Phelps, "I think he silenced a lot ofpeople with the game he played. That's what people don't understand. He is very valuable to our basketball team." 
Not many people would have agreed with Phelps before last night's game, and maybe many still do notagree. But no one can deny that Kempton's presence played a major role in the Irish victory last night. 
From the beginning, starting with a six-foot jumper from the baseline 
see KEMPTON, page 14 

Center Tim Kempton played what he called his "best game of the season" in Notre Dame's 66-60 triumph over Marquette last night, scoring 13 points and dominating the Warriors' big men inside. The victory earned the Irish a 19-8 record and kept strong their hopes for receiving an invita· lion to the NC4A post-season tournament. joe Brunetti has the game story at left. 

Women dismantle Dayton, 72-57, to wrap up North Star Conference 
By LARRY BURKE 

Sports Writer 
It's been quite a while since anyone besides a member of the maintenance crew cut down a net in the ACC, but the Notre Dame wo· men's basketball team had that plea· sure yesterday evening following its 72·57 win over Dayton. The victory clinched the North Star Conference title for the Irish, and boosted their record to 19·8 overall, 12-1 in the conference. 
Yesterday's game was another episode in Notre Dame's current torrid streak that has resulted in the dismantling of North Star oppo­nents. The Irish have now won 1 I straight NSC games, and 1 4 of their last 16 contests overall. The victory was also Notre Dame's I I th straight at the ACC, where ND has not lost since its home opener on Nov. 26. 
In addition to clinching the North Star championship, the win also pro­vided a fitting tribute to Irish seniors Mary Beth Schueth, Ruth Kaiser, and Laura Dougherty, who made their final ACC appearances yesterday. 
"Winning the conference title means a lot to this team," said Schueth. "It's been a long time since I helped cut down a net, and it's great feeling. We started this season with two goals · to win the confer· ence championship and to get into a post-season tournament. Today we accomplished one of those goals, 
and we'll see about the other one." 
see WOMEN, page 12 



Road to NCAAs is paved with complications 
Hello again, everybody! 

It has been a long and winding road for the I984-85 Notre Dame basketball team up to this point. The Irish have mixed flashes ofbrilliance with moments ofineptitude to conjure a 19-H record. However, this is the week when Notre Dame finds out whether all its hard work since that first day of practice way back in October will be rewarded with an NCAA' berth or if it will go for naught. Sunday is the day when the NCAA tournament committee will answer the.64-team question and fill the championship brackets. 
Notre Dame, along with Dayton, DePaul and Marquette, is hoping to be included in the NCAA's "Declaration of In· dependents" who make the field. It won't be an easy task for the Irish, who have rallied from an upset a week ago (the Butler did it) to give Digger Phelps his 300th and 301st career coaching wins with victories over Washington and Marquette. 
Nevertheless, the Irish tourney hopes are still a question­able entity. Notre Dame could still get 20 wins and make the NCAA with a triumph this weekend over Dayton. A victory over this top-flight independent would certainly help the Irish cause, but a loss niay be enough to knock the Irish into that group of teams classified as NIT (Not in Tournament) bound. It's a narrow path that Phelps' squad must follow and one complicated by several factors. Let's take a look at them, shall we? 
First ofall, the other independents have to be considered. DePaul has an 19-H overall mark, a 3·2 record in round-robin

play, and a 2-0 ledger vs. Notre Dame. The Blue Demons have their only remaining game (Marquette) on the road, a place where they have not been strong this year. Still, after completely dominating Marquette in Chicago last Saturday, it looks like DePaul could have 20 wins by the end of the week, and that will be enough to getJoey Meyer's club in the tournament. 
Dayton currently stands at 19·8, with Notre Dame the only opponent left on the schedule. The Flyers are 3·2 in round-robin play, but lost to Notre Dame inJanuary. Should Don Donoher's squad win on Saturday, it would virtually be assured an NCAA berth due to having the best round-robin record of the independents. However, a loss to the Irish may not keep the Flyers out, thanks to their two wins over DePaul. Thus, it would certainly appear that Dayton is in the driver's seat. 
Marquette is in the worst predicament of any of the big four independents. The Warriors are now 17-10 overall, 1-4 in round-robin play, and have lost both of their games with the Irish. The Warriors.were in a must-win situation in both their games this week, but with last night's loss it appears the only way Marquette will get in the tournament is ifthe selec­tion committee is heavily intoxicated. 
Got it so far? Well, hang on, bec;:ause adding to the com­plexity ofNotre Dame's situation are this week's post-season conference tournaments. The Irish wouldn't mind seeing teams like St.John's and North Carolina win their respective tourneys this week, because those teams are going to the NCAA tournament anyway. What the Irish don't need is for an upstart like Clemson or Connecticut to win the confer­ence tourney and claim an automatic bid. That would force the selection committee to award one ofits precious at-large spots to a more deserving team, and lessen Notre Dame's chances of making the field. 
Now add a degree of difficulty factor with Notre Dame's game at Dayton on Saturday. The Irish beat the Flyers at home earlier this year, but don't expect the Irish to get the same kind of breaks from the officials on the road that they got in that game. Plus, the Irish have to go to the UD Arena, a place where they have lost six times in eight tries, and beat a good Dayton squad for the second time this season. To say it won't be an easy task would be a gross understatement. 
Confused as to what all this means? Well, basically it means if the Irish win on Saturday, they will probably make the NCAA tournament. On the other hand, if the Irish lose, they might make the tournament depending on the result of
