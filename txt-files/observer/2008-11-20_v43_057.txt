Vizioteam 
wins Case 
StudyBowl 
By MOLLY MADDEN 
News Writer 
The final round of the Notre Dame Entrepreneurship Society's Case Study Bowl took place Wednesday evening, as students attempted to prove it is possible for a company to be successful, even in today's shaky economic cli­mate. 
The Case Study Bowl is a com­petition between three undergrad­uate teams each representing dif­ferent companies and debating each other about specific compa­nies of their own choosing, said club Marketing Officer Kevin Kray. 
The Case Study Bowl first began in 2007 and quickly became the Entrepreneurship Society's signa­ture event. It is based on Harvard Business School's own case study program. 
Thi'> year's Bowl started out with six teams representing six differ­ent companies. The preliminaries, held on Oct. 28, eliminated half of those teams leaving the remaining three to go head-to-head in the finals. 
The three companies that were featured in the finals this year was computer giant Google, holding company Berkshire Hathaway and LCD television manufacturer Vizio. 
Each !-,'Toup, composed of three­to five-man teams, had 20 minutes to discuss the history of the com­pany, their current operations, the outlook for the future, and provide an overall analysis of the company in DeBartolo IJaiL Following each

Group passes resolution 
Motion calls for dialogue about absences for interviews 
By JOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
Student Senate unanimously passed a reso­lution addressing student absences for inter­views that called for greater dialogue between students and their professors at their meeting Wednesday. 
The students who drafted the resolution, led by Academic Affairs committee chair Ryan Brellenthin, was originally told that there was an existing policy in the College of Business that excused student absences for interviews. I Iowever, Brellenthin said that he was later informed that no such policy exists.

I viewed the film la<>t night fhr the second time with tl1is issue in mind, and the lack of sensitivi­ty toward the subject is both blatant and dis­turbing. 
"I watehed a lot of retarded people, spent time with them, observed them, wat1:hnd all the rntardnd stu II' tl1ey did," says Tugg Spnedman, Ben Stiller's charactnr. "There were times when I W<L'> doing 'Jack' that I actually li~It retardnd like wally retarded.

And then thl'i gem from Hob1wt Downey Jr.'s 1:haracter: "You W<L'> farting in bath tubs and laughing your a<>s olr." 
Seriously? ThL<> doesn't "disparage or harm tim image ofindividuals wit11 di'iabilities," which Dream Works spok1~sman Chip Sullivan said the film managnd to avoid doing? 
At it<> best, tl1is nxehange drew cheap laughs from those who didn't think much oJ'it. At its worst. it broke the hnarL<> of those who low~ someone with an intellectual disability and work tirelessly to repair tl1is public insnnsitivity. 
In his Nov. 12 Viewpoint lettnr titled "Leaming to Laugh", Colin Keelnr not only states that "a little humor only serves to high­light these great challengns" liu:nd by people with intnllnctual disabilities, but he concludes, ''I'm sure [our Blessnd Mother I had a sense of humor a<; well."

It shouldn't even take these experiences, how­evor, to rnalize the daily hardships both those with int!~lleetual disabilitios and their loved ones enduro. Does a llollywood blockbuster really need to pile on with a marketing campaign ba<>1~d on the slogan "Never go full retard"? 
Suro, th1~ film's dedared goal, as the film's supporters argue, may have been to satirize the film industry, and the movie il<>elf also contained jokes about African-American stereotypes, for example. But every time one eame up, another character pointed it out and tore it down.

lnnmates sneak through ceiling to have sex 
BLOOMFIELD, Ind. ­Three male and three female inmates at a southern Indiana jail face charges that they devised a way to sneak between cell blocks to help pass their time behind bars by having sex. 
The inmates figured out how to remove metal ceiling panels in the Greene County Jail and used the passageway more than a dozen times in September and October, according to court documents. 
The men -ages 44, 38 and 17 -and the women -ages 27, 26 and 21 -crawled through the ceiling after midnight, having sexual encounters and drinking homemade alcohol that was found hidden in the male cell block, a police affidavit said. 
Undercover officers use Taser on pallbearer 
WILMINGTON, N.C. ­A North Carolina sheriffs official has apologized for plunging a funeral into chaos when under­cover agents tried to arrest the dead man's son -and used a Taser on him in the process. 
It happened as the cof­fin was being loaded into a hearse. The officers planned to quietly arrest pallbearer Gladwyn Taft Russ III, The Star-News of Wilmington reported Wednesday. 
Relatives said two deputies dressed in coats and ties grabbed Buss and kneed him in his back before Tasering him. One deputy's gun fell out of its holster.

choirs that we started 24 years ago," Menk said. "It's to promote good singing among high school travel choirs." 
The 20 choirs perform dur­ing the two-day festival in the O'Laughlin Auditorium on Saint Mary's campus. 
The event is not a competi­tion; however, there will be three commentators giving remarks about each choir's performances. The commen­tators this year are Dr. James Bass, Western Michigan University's Director of Choral Studies, Dr. Jill Burleson, Ball State University's Assistant Director of Choral Activities, and Dr. Eric Johnson, Northern Illinois University's Associate Professor of Music and Coordinator of Ensembles. 
Each choir will perform three or four different songs. After each has finished, one of the judges will instruct them on stage for 15 to 20 minutes. 
"Every choir gets to have the chance to have this sort of clinic with one of the com­mentators," Menk said. "Then the other two commentators give them written comments. The three commentators rotate all day so we're watch­ing different people on stage do the actual clinic." 
The choirs are chosen on a first come first serve basis. Each choir must fill out an application in order to be accepted into the event. 
"This year I have a waiting list of six or seven more choirs that would like to come," Menk said. 
Menk created the Festival because, "there are a lot of festivals out there for mixed choirs. But at the time I started this, they didn't have any that were just for high school girls' choirs. This seems the most logical place to have it at this women's col­lege. We are really centrally located." 
During the Festival, five choirs will perform each morning, and five in the afternoon. At noon, Saint Mary's own women's choir will perform. 
"That's supposed to be sort of a highlight of the Festival. The idea is that we are a good model of what a good women's choir can do, the kind of repertoire that we can sing and the kind of tone quality that we can produce and the kind of musicianship that we can display," Menk said. 
The Festival begins at 9:30 
a.m. Thursday and will close for the day at 4:30 p.m. It will take place at the same time on Friday. The event is free of charge.

Codes

that he has seen more concen­trated violations in neighbor­hoods 1mst of campus, includ­ing properties in a six-block area around Warrick St. Bulot said between 15 and 20 homes have been reported this year. 
"The unfortunate side of these issues is that students are going to have to move," Toppel said, or face fines and possible legal action. 
Establishing the current code and exceptions 
Lyons said the current zon­ing regulations were enacted in 2004. The new code restricted the number of unre­lated people who may live in a property zoned single family. 
People can be legally related by blood, marriage or adop­tion, Lyons said. 
"If you have two students in a single family home, that's the maximum you can have, because they're two unrelated people," Lyons said. 
There are exceptions to this code, however, Lyons said. 
When the current zoning code was enacted in 2004, homes that were occupied by more than two unrelated peo­ple at the time were "grandfa­thered in." 
"If you can prove you've con­sistently used it for that use (with more than two unrelated occupants) since 2004, without lapsing for more than a one year time period, you can con­tinue to use it" with more than two students, Lyons said. 
Lyons said that of the homes students are currently living in off campus, there is a "mix­ture" of homes that are in vio­lation and homes that are legally grandfathered. 
Many of the homes rented by well-known rental companies in South Bend are not in viola­tion, Lyons explained. 
"A lot of them in the city were existing (student homes)," Lyons said, prior to the new code. 
Local landlord Mark Kramer said he is aware of the code and all of the homes he rents to more than two students are legally grandfathered. 
"I will not rent a house if it's not zoned correctly," Kramer said. While Kramer does rent properties that are zoned sin­gle family and are not grandfa­thered, "we never put more than two students in the house," he said. 
Home purchases, new rentals Increase violations 
Still, Toppel said some land­lords rent non-grandfathered single family homes to more than two students. 
In addition, many of the new violations come from homes that are purchased by the stu­dents themselves or their fami­lies, Toppel said. 
"Housing is rather reason­able in South Bend and it's sometimes more reasonable ... to purchase a home, and have the student bring [roommates) to make the mortgage," she said. 
Toppnl said violations arise from both ignorance about regulations as well as blatant violation of the code in other eases. Thn property owner ­whether it is the resident or a landlord -is legally responsi­ble for knowing and abiding by the eode. 
"In my opinion, most of the time, students aren't aware," Toppel said. 
When parents purchase homes, some do not know

you cannot have more than two unrelated people in a residence," DeCola said. 
She said that while agents make the code known, there are often cases where "there ends up being at least two if not more students living there." 
Investigating violations, enforcing code 
Toppel and Bulot said inves­tigations about over-occupied single family homes are driven solely by complaints, most often from neighbors. 
"We investigate every com­plaint that comes in," Bulot said. "We go out physically to see if there are any overt signs of over occupancy." 
This includes multiple cars with out-of-state plates, multi­ple bikes and other visible indicators, Bulot said. 
Once there is enough evi­dence to prove the home is over-occupied and in violation, Toppel and Bulot said they send preliminary letters detail­ing the violations. Toppel said that the city allows 10 days to resolve the issue. Owners can prove they were in compliance, rezone -which she said is highly unlikely-or move stu­dents out of the home until only two occupants remain. 
For properties that remain in violation, citations are issued starting at $50 and reaching up to $1,000 per day. Legal action is the last resort, Toppel said. 
Both Toppel and Bulot said they try to be reasonable when dealing with students and in forcing any of them to move out. 
"Sometimes there are leases involved, and we don't want to put any unnecessary burden on a [resident) as long as in good faith they're making progress," Bulot said. 
Toppel said the increasing number of violations have led her to be stricter when it comes to allowing students to wait until the end of a semes­ter to move out. 
"We can't really offer that [lenience) anymore as a city, because it's become blatant," Toppel said. 
Toppel said she recognizes that it is difficult to move out of a house mid-semester. 
"The students are going to be upset. One, they're going to have to leave their friends. Two, they're going to have to find a new place to live," Toppel said. "And how do you draw straws? Who's leaving the house? 
Toppel added: "I try to see both sides of the story, to be 
ing off campus 
to a single family 
home. 
"I would suggest they look somewhere else before they put themselves in that posi­tion," she said. 
Lyons said students should investigate whether the home they are renting or purchasing is properly zoned, especially if they plan to have more than two people living in the home. 
That's especially important when leases are involved, he said. 
"For the students to protect themselves, they need to get something in writing, from that landlord, that says it is a legal property to be used that way [as a student house]," Lyons said. "They want to do their home­work and not put themselves in risk of a situation where they would need to find a new place to live in the middle of the year."

views to the faculty's attention because they "thought it would be a little presumptuous to demand that the faulty do something different," he said. 
Creating a policy on the issue is a last resort for Brellenthin. 
"If we can fix it just through dialogue without a policy, then we don't want a policy," he said. 
Sorin senator Mike Sayles said this idea that creating a policy isn't the best way to han­dle any potential issues with interviews earlier in the meet­ing. "Mostly the professors, especially in the business school, say it's fme to miss class as long as you notifY them," he said. "They know interviews are going to happen. It's OK as long as you let them know in advance." 
However, Pasquerilla West senator Megan Sennett said that she has had a problem with missing class for an inter­view. Sennett, a junior account­ing major, said that she has spent parts of three of the past four weeks in Atlanta on inter­views. She said that she had to drop a class that meets only on Fridays because she was only allowed one absence. 
"It is actually an issue," Sennett said. 
Brellenthin said that his com­mittee based the need for a pol­icy mostly on "anecdotal evi­dence." But he said that the need for some sort of resolution is not entirely dependent on students having problems miss­ing classes for interviews. 
"Even if every professor was granting absences, we just want to get the dialogue going," he said. "It's a good thing for stu­dents and professors to get together and talk." 
Sayles objected to one specific section of the resolution that he interpreted as saying the reso­lution was necessary because the job market is eurrently competitive. 
"It shouldn't matter whether the market is competitive or not competitive," Sayles said. "I don't think there's a greater need now than five years ago lor somebody to go to an inter­view. It's always been a part of the process." 
But Brellenthin defended the wording of the resolution because it "signals a change from the status quo." 
"As time passes and the mar­ket place for jobs gets more competitive, there's a reason to change the status quo," Brellenthin said. 
Sayles made a motion to remove the clause that dealt with market competitiveness, but his motion only received two votes and was defeated. 
In other Senate news: 
+Student body vice president Grant Schmidt announced at the meeting that Food Services has agreed to allow students to use the east room of South Dining Hall and two rooms in North Dining Hall for study space during exam week.

This is in addition to the Career Center's donation of the interview rooms in Flanner Hall as exam week study space.

Media leaders criticize journalist ban 
.JERUSALEM -Leaders of the world's biggest media organizations filed a protest with Israel's prime minister Wednesday criticizing the government's decision to ban journalists from entering the Gaza Strip for the last two weeks. 
The protest was the latest in a chorus of international criticism of Israel's Gaza dosure, tightened after a five-month truce began unraveling about two weeks ago in a flurry of Israeli airstrikes against militants and Palestinian rocket barrages targeting Israeli towns. 
Those signing the letter included Associated Press Chief Executive and President Tom Curley, Heuters Editor-in-Chief David Sehlesinger, New York Times Executive Editor Bill Keller, ABC News President David Westin, BBC News Director Helen Boaden and other top exeeutives from CNN, the Canadian TV net­work CTV. the German broadcaster ZDF, and the French news service Agence France Presse.

NEW DELHI -The ship, operating off the coast of Oman in the lawless waters of the Gulf of Aden. was crewed by heavily armed men, some carrying rocket-propelled grenade launch­ers.

Daschle accepts Cabinet offer 
WASIIINGTON -Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle has accepted President-elect Barack Obama's offer to be Secretary of Health and Human Services, Democratic officials said Wednesday. 
The appointment has not been announced, but these officials said the job is Daschle's, barring an unforeseen problem as Obama's team reviews the background of the South Dakota Democrat. One area of review will include the lobbying connections of his wife, Linda Hall Daschle, who has lobbied mostly on behalf of airline-related companies over the years. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the mat­ter publicly.

SOUTH AFRICA 

Experts emphasize self-help-for Africa 
Economists hope for foreign investment for profit, easy access to Western markets 
Associated Press 

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -Two weeks after Africans danced for joy to see a black man elected president of the United States, a Kenyan newspaper columnist delivered a crisp warning to this complex and troubled continent: "Obama is not the Great Black Hope." 
Africans will have to look for solutions within them­selves, not abroad, Priscah Edith Awino wrote in the Daily Nation, the leading newspaper of Barack Obama's ancestral land. 
The self-help theme has become increasingly preva­lent with the recognition that 50 years of Western aid and emergency rescues of famine, disease and war victims have failed to cure Africa's ills, and may even have held the continent back. 
So rather than expect Obama to be a cure-all, Awino wrote, his election "should inspire us to build institutions that will pro­duce leaders with Obama's greatest strengths -his dignified bearing, states­manship, brains, know-how and depth."

Unlik(~ many othPr univnrsities that arn now facing dif'ficultins eomplnting their construction Jlrl!i­nds, Al'flnck-Cravns said Notre Damn only bngins constructioh when it has rnceived all of the money rHH:essary f(>r the pn!jnct. 
"Our policy is that we cannot begin construction of buildings until wn havjl 100 pnn:nnt of tho rnonny plndgnd from donors. We have to havn 75 pnn:ent cash in hand. and tho rnmaining 25 pnr­cent rwnds to be in within live years," lw said. 
Whiln current construction proj­ects, such as Hyan flail and the addition to the Law School, will be completed, Afllm:k-Gravns said plans for a new student center, two new dorms and a soeial seienee building will probably havn to bn put on hold. 
"Tiwm's a lot of other building that wn want to do on campus but we won't do thmn until we gnt the funding fbr them," he said. "So, in a sensn. we arn slowing down just to tho nxtent that we don't get peo­pln to provide tlw funding." 
All lour of the buildings are part of the administration's plans for the development of the campus, and Aflleck-Graves said they had already planned out where the new structures would be placed. 
"We have place markers on campus for where new buildings can go. We haven't decided what those buildings will be," he said. "For instance, the social sdence building is slatnd to go just south of the llesburgh Center for International Studies. We know that the two new dorms are slated to go on old Juniper, just east of Pasquerilla East and Knott. We know the student activity center is slated to go just nast of the Stepan Center." 
AITleck-Graves said it would probably be a few years befi>re the school can raise enough funds from its donors to begin those proj­ecl'i. 
"I think everybody knows that funding L<> going to be much tighter in the next few years. The econo­my is not in good shape; the finan­cial markets are still in some disar­ray," hn said. "We're reliant on the donors to provide the funding." 
llowever, Allleek-Graves said the absence of these buildings would not have a significant impact on life at the University. 
"At the moment we are operat­ing the University without those buildings and we will continue to do so," he said. 
Aff1eck-Graves said the University would have to be more conservative in purcha<>ing, which would include cuts in travel expenses and eomputer and equip­ment upgrades. 
"I think parl-; of our operations will have to look at cost savings across the University, maybe in some of our pureha<>ing," he said. "At the moment we're pretty well positioned to handle most other things." 
Moreover, Affleck-Graves said the endowment would remain strong throughout tho reeession. lie said the endowmnnt would probably shrink over tho next cou­ple of years becausn it is heavily invested in market-rnlatnd seeuri­ties, but it is important to remem­ber the endowment had grown rapidly over the past f(mr years. 
"The endowment will always lluetuate because it is invested in a lot of market-related securities, and so certainly the endowment will go down," he said. "But it h<L'i also gone up dramatically in the la<>t four years, so it fluctuates with the market." 
However, Affieck-Graves said thn University would continue to extract the same amount of money from the endowment eaeh year as tlmy had previously. 
"We don't like to pay out a fixed percentage of the endowment eaeh year," hP said. "We like to pay out a spncilie dollar amounl so we'll always have the same amount of eash coming out or the endow­ment." 
Nlleek-Graves crnditnd his prPd­ecessors for establishing tlw University's eonsnrvative polides that will help st(wr thn school through the rneession. 
"I think the people who lnd tim University's linandal system befhn~ me -Fr. Ned Joyen and Fr. Tim Scully -did sueh a wonderful job of creating a finandal disdplinn in the University that has always allowed us to bo cautious of over­spending in good times and that is providing us now with a great reserve so we don't have to impact our operations too much," he said.

WASIIINGTON -They are old bulls both, legendary for fiercely lording over the Senate Appropriations Committee and fun­neling billions to their home states.

Senate scraps plans to vote on auto bailout 
General Motors, Chrysler, Ford Motor Co. could face financial collapse 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON A 
Democratic Congress, 
unwilling or unable to 
approve a $25 billion bailout 
for Detroit's Big Three, 
appears ready to punt the 
automakers' fate to a lame­
duck Republican president. 
Caught in the middle of a who-blinks-first standoff are legions of manufacturing firms and auto dealers ­and millions of Americans' jobs after Senate Democrats canceled a show­down vote that had been expected Thursday. President George W. Bush has "no appetite" to act on his own. 
U.S. auto companies employ nearly a quarter-mil­lion workers, and more than 730,000 other people have jobs producing the materials and parts that go into cars. About 1 million on top of that work in dealerships nationwide. If just one of the auto giants were to go belly up, some estimates put U.S. job losses next year as high as 2.5 million.

Fear of deflation affects stock market 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -A growing fear of economic deflation helped take the air out of the stock market Wednesday, and another white-knuckle final hour on Wall Street pushed the Dow Jones industrials under 8,000 to their lowest close since the financial meltdown began. 
Consumer prices in October took their biggest monthly plunge in the six decades that records have been kept ­a reprieve for shoppers but a danger sign for the economy because falling prices can make a mild recession spiral into something worse. 
The drop illustrated once again how quickly the economic danger can shift in tumultuous times like these. The infla­tion fears that grippc.d the nation just a few months ago now seem like a distant memory. 
"Consumer price inflation has sud­denly screeched into reverse," said Brian Bethune, economist at IHS Global Insight. "The inflation threat has disap­peared from the radar screen." 
Worried about the economic data, a gloomy outlook from the Federal Reserve and the fate of the Big Three automakers, investors yanked money out of the stock market. The Dow drift­ed lower for most of the day, then plum­meted in a tumultuous final hour of trading. 
It crossed under 8,000 in the last min­utes before the closing bell and closed down 427 points, or about 5 percent, at 7,997-its lowest close since March 2003. The average has dipped below 8,000 on other days since the meltdown began in mid-September but had not closed there. 
The Standard & Poor's 500, a broader snapshot of the stock market, slipped more than 6 percent. The financial cri­sis has already wiped out $6.7 trillion of value from the S&P 500 since its October 2007 high. In the same period, the Dow has lost more than 6,000 points. 
"I don't know what the catalyst is going to be where we turn the corner and people start buying stocks whole­heartedly again," said Jon Biele, head of capital markets at Cowen & Co. "People got out of the way. The financial situa­tion hasn't changed." 
The Federal Heserve sharply lowered its economic projections and signaled that further interest-rate cuts might be necessary to ease the economy's worst crisis since the Great Depression. 
Documents from the Fed's most recent closed-door deliberations on interest rate policy showed a worry about "significant weakness" in the economy and a worsening job market.

Athletic Director needs to schedule better 
I don't know if the Church looks ahead on the schedule when it assigns readings for each Sunday, but it sure blew it this past weekend. Ideally, you look to match the hardest parts of the schedule with the easier teams ­
Fr. Lou DeiFra

a San Diego State opener, for exam­ple. And you put your harder games, Faithpoint ideally, after a bye. Notre Dame didn't do a great job this year, scheduling the bye the first week of the season, then loading up on four straight tough games in November, with no bye, three of which they lost. 
The Church needs Florida's AD. The Gators play the Citadel this week with a BCS berth on the line. And they had their bye week before Tennessee. That's how you set it up. 
As students head into crunch time this semester, they need a bye week on the Gospel. Something consoling-"come to me all you who labor and I will give you rest."Or something energizing, a spiritu­al Hed Bull -"The water I give you will become like a spring of eternal life welling up within you."Or even a crank­it-up pep talk-"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. And I have given you power to trample on snakes and scorpions."(Uh, Jesus, I actually don't need those here in Indiana, but how about "acing tests without studying for them?") 
That's what we needed this past Sunday, as dark, snowy, assignment­packed November descended upon us ­
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Dear Jane(s) 
To the eleven and a balf girls and one camel (a surprisingly good kisser) that I have hooked up with this semester, 
First, l would like to thank you for your time and consideration. It is an honor to have made it through your rig­orous selection process. 
Second, I would like to make it abun­dantly clear that I do not plan on marry­ing any of you. In fact, I would like to publicly pronounce to everyone that I am not, in fact, looking for a relationship, and my random hookups are in no way my own way of coping with my deep­seated desire for a meaningful relation­ship. 
Third, I would also like to thank every­one for reading this, both on campus and on the Internet around the world. Presumably, you all now know that I have casual morals. I'm glad I could finally get that out there to everyone, especially my parents. Mom and Dad, I know you would be so proud if you could only have seen me in the heat of the moment. 
Fourth, despite my complete lack of interest in a relationship, I am wonder­ing why you don't want to be one of my very best friends. Those nights were so magical. In fact, I even remember most of your first names. Presumably, we could even get started on learning last names too at some point. If making out randomly after 30 seconds of conversa­tion isn't enough to base a friendship on, how am I supposed to make friends of the opposite sex at this school? 
Fifth, and finally, I would like to thank The Observer for running this Jetter. After all, I could have simply contacted you individually via Facebook or some other medium. Instead, I am glad that I have the chance to share my feelings and insecurities with the rest of the world as well. 
Will Guappone junior Fisher Hall Nov.l9 
a soft, peace-inducing, inspiring Gospel. Instead, the Church AD gave us the equivalent of USC on the road. The Gospel of the Talents. Death to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's perfectionists. You know the one: a master gives one servant five talents, another two, and another one. Then, when the master returns from his journey, he asks for their returns. The one with five made another five and gets a posh promotion. The same for the one with two. But the one with just one talent played "Guitar Hero" in his room all week, gets read the riot act, and loses even the one he had. Just what you needed to hear with five papers and an Orgo Final on the horizon 
Of course, this passage has its place in the Gospel messages we need to hear. Just not right now. Because one tempt­ing way to interpret this Parable of the Talents is: "If I max out with my gifts, God will be really pleased with me and throw his arms around me and Jove me."This, I submit, is not at all what Jesus is trying to convey in this Gospel. Furthermore, it's a very dangerous interpretation for our spiritualities, especially if we're perfectionists-that the love of God can be secured by per­forming perfectly (or at least highly effi­ciently) with our gifts. 
But this interpretation does not square with the God whom Jesus reveals throughout the Gospels as a whole. How can we, for example, square such an interpretation with the Parable of the Prodigal Son? In this parable the younger son not only does not "max out" his gifts, but completely squanders them on debauchery and prostitutes. And when he returns to his father (another image of God), the father, very movingly, runs out to meet his irresponsible son and embraces him in his arms. 
The concept that we earn love by our performance is often learned from the first time we bring home our report card full of /\s and everybody in our house goes nuts. This is followed by academic awards, honor societies, huge SAT scores and all the rest-each usually, and reasonably, triggering celebrations of our achievement. Though in the deep recesses of our hearts, we can also begin to think, mistakenly, that these are cele­brations of our being. That we are good, worthwhile, and lovable because we have produced these achievements. And as our spiritual lives mature, as yours are in powerful ways during these col­lege years, this dynamic of "I-am-loved­because-I'm-successful"can, quite natu­rally, get projected onto God. "God loves me more when I do well with my life."That, needless to say, places a bur­den on your tests and your life -the acceptance of God -that is a tremen­dous, and ultimately unbearable, load to carry. 
It is easy to see how last Sunday's Gospel about the talents could be read as an exhortation to please God by max­ing out with your gifts. But it is equally easy to see how incompatible such a spirituality is with the Parable of the Prodigal Son, or the Lost Sheep (who doesn't seem to have been the brightest goat in the herd), or the Beatitudes' exaltation of precisely those whom the world normally judges unsuccessful. 
The love of God is already ours. It was won for us by Jesus Christ and granted to us at our baptism and continued life in the Church. This is why St. John writes: "The love of God is this: not that we have loved God, but that God has loved us. "This is as clear a statement as possible that we do not earn the love of God, not by our achievements, not even by our virtue, nor anything else we can accomplish. The love of God, simply, is already won for us. 
If we have been given five talents, or two, or one, we are indeed called to cul­tivate them and place them at the serv­ice of our brothers and sisters. But we do so not so we can "pass the test"and earn the love of God. Rather, freed up by an ever-deepening certainty of the love of God that we already have, we become more and more filled with a prodigal happiness to develop and share what we have with others, especially the poor and sorrowful, that they too might know the happiness and the love of God with which we have been gifted.

Tw-o to tango 
Dear Melissa (who's hooked-up with six guys this semes­ter). 
It takes two to tango. If you truly "Jove to kiss boys, "then perhaps a much larger portion of the initial blame lies with you than your letter recognized. If you love to eat ice cream and despair when you find yourself opening the freezer, don't blame Ben and Jerry's. 
Your greatest problem lies with the lack of attention that you, the "victim" of the hook-ups, receive from those ex­flings. I'll confess, though, that I'm not quite sure how much of a relationship you expect to have established with a kiss. Do you even remember their full names? 
Probably not. But that's a problem which arises as a result of hooking-up without having established a relation­ship -there's no relationship. 
What disturbs me is that, though you admit equal blame, you seem to place responsibility with your hook-ees rather than yourself. Yes, they haven't talked to you since the event, although you reluctantly admit in your letter that a few have. In defense of the silent, though, you've likewise failed to initiate the desired discourse. Did you call their cell phones? Your defense was a broken phone, so you lost most of the numbers which you had obtained -but what about the ones you haven't lost, did you call them? And of the ones you did Jose, did you bother to spend three sec­onds to check a Facebook account? 
No, you just chalk-off the male gender as hopeless, write us up as another lost cause when you write, "I doubt you would answer even if I could call you" (p.s.-you can). And as a dude, I'm just sick and tired of being portrayed as a criminal every time I do something that apparently falls in with a facet of the "hook-up culture. " 
On that note, I was a kissing booth for Halloween with a warning that read "Too hot to handle. Contains nuts." I'd have written, "Warning: Won't make exceptional effort to contact you after we kiss. This is just meant to be fun for both of us," but I assumed that those were obvious assumptions for something that was clearly meant for entertainment and little else. 
I think you reached the right conclusion-if you're look­ing for friends, it's probably not a great idea to make-out with the other person within the first few hours you've met him or her. Sorry about the hobby. But I think that you need to reflect on your reasoning for the decision; don't blame those mean old boys for not initiating the conversa­tion which you too shy away from. 
v'Dennis Grabowski freshman Dillon Hall Nov. 19 
The Love Doctor 
Dear Melissa Buddie, 

I was horrified to learn, in your recent letter to the Observer, that you were actively considering swearing off what are colloquially known as "ran­dom hook-ups,"or what I prefer to think of as "fun­fun pleasure times." Your experiences with those six (no more and no Jess) boys are certainly not unique, and definitely not grounds for removing yourself from the competition for Queen of the Make-Outs. As someone who is a self-proclaimed boy-kissing hobbyist, what could possibly make you give up those stolen moments of passion because of a few small helpings of awkward turtle in the dining halls? 
As it happens, though, I can sympathize. It may shock you to learn this -but many of the strapping young fellows you've locked lips with are not inter­ested in anything serious, or even casual. The dam­age has been done to your youthful naivete, and nothing but a full-blown hook-up romance will restore it. At least, that's the diagnosis of this par­ticular Love Doctor. And his remedy is simple. 
Knowing (as I do) the true source of your reluc­tance to make yourself available, that source being the abiding awkwardness of previous hookups, and knowing (as I do) that you have not yet truly experi­enced the glory of a true 'fun-fun pleasure time,' I would like to throw my hat into the ring as a candi­date for an elected office you didn't even know existed. That office? President ... of your heart. 
I consider myself something of an amateur philematologist (philematology, n.: the art or science of kissing). But more than this, I know how to treat a woman right. 
Facebook bumper stickers have taught me that the secret is to purchase you 11 real roses and one fake one, and have them delivered to your dorm by a ser­enading Spaniard. When you call to tearfully gush about my thoughtfulness, it will be then that I make this promise to you. "I will love you until the last rose dies." 'After which, of course, we will hook-up like wild animals, 
So keep an eye out for me on Friday night. I'll be the well-dressed man with the flower in his button­hole, waiting to show you new realms of pleasure. 
PS-I live on North Quad. Things won't get weird.

Tonight and tomorrow, the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center will host one of Buenos Aires' hottest exports: the spirit­ed, passionate dancers of Tango fire. The act, whieh features five dancing couples performing alongside with the Quatrotango Orchestra, is a pulse-pounding, music-thumping night of Latin entflrtainment that should not be missed. 
"Everything may be beautiful at the ballet, but at Tango Fire, evflrything is smoldering," says a recent review in EDGE Philadelphia posted on the offi­cial Tango Fire Web site. Departing from other touring dance spectacles, such as "Hiverdance" or similar phenom­ena, Tango Fire features a vari­ety of reinterpretations of the title dance itself, the tango. Traditional moves are accented by a theatrical flair, resulting in a show that's bound to captivate and surprise. 
The troupe also takes audi­ences through a history of the dance's evolution; earlier por­tions of the performance will oftnn focus on "Milonga," a 19th century country-dance that bngan in Buenos Aires. The stage setting of this portion is a "Cafe del Tango," complete with cafe tables and lamps. More modern variations of the tango are fea­tured in the latter portions of the group's shows, incorporating impressive lifts and quickly paced moves into the rhythms of the dance. The performers dress to the nines, with glamorous and lively. gowns for the women and fedo­"I don't think I will ever get ras and suits for the men. sick of the Tango," Christian

Of course, Tango Fire would simply be a troupe of dancers without the smooth performances of their main vocalist, Javier 'Dardenal' Dominguez. Dominguez, a native of Buenos Aires, began a singing career at age 26 and has also made the rounds among the most famous tango houses in Argentina. The accompanying band also includes violinist Marcelo Rebuffi, pianist Gabriel Clenar, bass player Gerardo Scaglione and Hugo Satorre, who plays a traditional instrument called the bandoneon.

Tango Fire is appearing at the Performing Arts Center courtesy of their Visiting Artist Series. Performances begin tonight and tomorrow night at 7 p.m. Tickets cost $48 for general admission, $38 for faculty and staff, $36 for seniors and $15 for students.

Winter seemed especially devious this year. It snuck in, teasing all of us on campus with the occasional warm day, even as the temperatures slowly dropped and those dark clouds rolled in. Tuesday's snow seems to announce that it is finally here in full force. But don't let those cold winds and gray days get you down. Here are a couple of ways to fend off that winter depression over the next few months here in South Bend. 
1. Pretend you're a kid again. Surviving a Notre Dame winter is all about attitude, and the easiest way to keep your chin up is to remember when every walk through that winter wonder­land invoked images of sledding and snow days. We don't get many snow days anymore, but it is worth it to try to approach it with joy. Reopen your eyes to how beautiful -and how much fun -all that snow and ice can be. Here's a hint: the hill between Bronson and Lewis is great for sled­
. ding. 

2. 
Stay healthy. Eat well, exercise, and drink a lot of water. As the temperatures drop, we try to stay inside, eat lots of heavy foods and don't have the advantage of high temperatures to remind us when to head to the tap. Keep yourself in shape and you'll feel better through the season. Remember, if you bundle up properly, are careful with ice, and don't go out when it is too cold, you'll be perfectly fine going outside to exercise. 

3. 
Really enjoy your coffee and tea. You've probably been drinking it all semester just for the caffeine kick, but now that it's cold outside, that warm mug is especially comforting. And don't forget that it is apple cider season!


,. 


4. Invest in some fun hats, scarves, and gloves. 
are all going to ading to class at same time, so help each other out by adding some pizzazz to the trip. Pick out colorful winter accessories and don't be afraid to be a little silly. We'll appreciate you helping us put a smile on our face. 
5. 
Pull yourself out of bed. I know it's hard when it's dark and cold outside, but keeping your regular sleeping hours (well, as regular as they can be for a college student) ensures that you don't cut into an already shortened day. 

6. 
Stay social. Don't give into the temptation to avoid the cold at all costs, bundle up and get out. Winter is too cold to take on alone. 

7. 
Of course, winter really does mean staying in some days. It is the time for curling up with good movie. Take a few hours break and invite some friends over for a movie and hot chocolate with plenty of marshmallows. Try winter season classics or even your Christmas favorites as we move closer to December. Some good options are "Little Women," "Ice Age," and "Meet Me in St. Louis." 

8. 
Do some winter cleaning and revamp your room. Move some things around and introduce some new colors and decorations. Even if it is just printing out those pictures from the semester and summer and pasting them on the wall, it will refresh the room and how you feel in it. 


Don't let winter win! Put a smile on your face, a scarf around your neck, and take a romp never a trudge -through the snow.

It's getting cold outside. If we 
·. didn't need to eat, I'm sure a lot of us might pick staying inside over braving the snow­
i drifts to get to North and 
South. Alas, we must perse­~ vere. Here are two entrees that · might make the journey to i your favorite dining hall feel a t little more worth it. i This week's recipes: 
i Meatball Sub 

' The dining hall puts out 
'' meatballs for pasta quite often, k so why not put them to use in this classic, warm and gooey 1 sandwich? It is great served with a salad. Thanks to Megan Cefferillo for inspiring this 
Pick up a long roll and two slices of provolone cheese. 
If you are in South, sprinkle parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning from the spice rack onto the inside of both sides of bread. Place a slice of pro­volone cheese on top of that on each side. Lay the bread flat and run it though the toaster by the Panini presses. If you are in North, toast the bread, then sprinkle parmesan cheese onto the insides of both sides of bread and cover with pro­volone. Zap it in the microwave for the cheese to melt. 
Head to the pasta bar and add a layer of meatballs. Top with marinara sauce. 
Ranch Dressing and Chicken Pasta 
This dish is apparently a tra­
dition of the Notre Dame Hockey team before each game. Now, before you run away from the odd idea of using ranch dressing on top of pasta, give the idea a try. Of course, you may feel like you need to play a hockey game by the time you finish eating it! Serve it with a garden style salad with a light vinegar based dressing. Thanks to Chris Hall for inspiring this recipe. 
Fill a bowl with short pasta. Cut up a chicken breast and mix it into the pasta. Drizzle ranch dressing over the pasta and chicken and mix. 
Heat in the microwave for less than a minute to warm up the dressing. 
Sprinkle on some black pep­per. Want some variations? 
Before you heat the dish, try mixing in broccoli and sliced mushrooms. If you want to give it a bit of a kick, add in a little hot sauce along with the ranch dressing. 
Quick Tip 

Figure out which section of the dining hall you visit the least and head in that direc­tion. Haven't made a waffle since the novelty wore off? Have one for dinner. Skip over the offerings of the Mexican 1 bar most days? Make yourself · a good taco salad. Varying J your routine will prevent you ·.· from tiring of the dining hall I too quickly. 
Have your own dining hall recipe? We would love to fea­ture it! E-mail mfordice@nd.edu.

Associated Press 

ARLINGTON, Texas ­The NFL is giving Adam "Pacman" Jones another chance. 
Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Wednesday the suspended cornerback has been reinstated by league commissioner Roger Goodell, but he must miss two more games -this Sunday and the following game on Thanksgiving. He'll be back Dec. 7 at Pittsburgh. 
"He much appreciates the Cowboys and Jerry Jones for standing behind him and encouraging him, and he's grateful to the commission­er," said Worrick Robinson, Adam Jones' Nashville-based attorney. 
Jerry Jones would not reveal any conditions the commissioner may have imposed and the league office said it would not have any immediate comment. However, Robinson, said, "He knows what he has to do. It's very clear." 
"He's a long way, a long way from having clear sail­ing," Jerry Jones said. 
Adam Jones was suspend­ed from the entire 2007 sea­son because of multiple inci­dents while with the Tennessee Titans. Over the offseason, he was traded to Dallas and then given another chance by Goodell. The Cowboys gave him a security team to help keep him in line, but on Oct. 7, Jones got into an alcohol­related scuffie with one of the bodyguards during a private party at a Dallas hotel. 
Jones spent part of his time away undergoing alco­hol rehabilitation. 
"He has demonstrated something very important to all of us," Jerry Jones said. 
It also will be up to Pacman to police himself. The Cowboys will no longer be providing bodyguards. 
"It all starts with him and his decision-making," Robinson said. "He's com­fortable making decisions for himself." 
Robinson said the alcohol therapy was "something he needed to do." 
"The real issue was more 

IN BRIEF Graham placed on IR,
finished for the season 
TAMPA, Fla. -With leading rusher Earnest Graham out for the season, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will lean more on Warrick Dunn. 
Graham limped off the field with a right ankle sprain after his only carry during last week's victory over Minnesota and was placed on injured reserve Wednesday. That means a greater role in the offense for the 33-year-old Dunn. 
"I expect to play a lot more. But at the same time, we have other guys who can come in and make plays," Dunn said. ''I'm just going to do my part to help us move the chains, score touchdowns and win games." 
Graham entered last season as the third-string tailback, but wound up playing a major role in Tampa Bay winning the NFC South because of injuries to Carnell "Cadillac" Williams and Michael 
Pittman. Vikings' Allen fined heavi­
ly, won't be suspended 
EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. -Minnesota VIkings defensive end Jared Allen has been fined $25,000 for a recent spate of late hits, but he won't be _suspend­ed. 
He's not planning to reduce his aggressiveness, either. 
After his summons to NFL head­quarters in New York on Tuesday, Allen returned to Winter Park to con­tinue resting and rehabilitating his sprained right shoulder. He vowed his approach to pass rushing would not change, even though he's been fined a total of $80,000 this season -over three separate levies -for what the league has deemed unacceptable con­tact during games. 
"Not at all. I will play football the way I play football, and that's the way it is," Allen said after Wednesday's practice, in which he did not partici­pate due to his injury. ''I'm not a dirty than allegations of an inci­dent at a Dallas hotel," Robinson said. "There were personal issues that, until addressed, there was a like­lihood of another incident occurring." 
Jerry Jones said Adam Jones can have "limited par­ticipation" this week, but would not be part of full­squad practices or condi­tioning. He can return to practice Monday. 
Goodell suspended Adam Jones indefinitely on Oct. 14, saying he'd put a timeframe on it after the cornerback missed at least four games. This decision means it will be a six-game suspension. Jones also missed the entire 2007 season. By the time he returns, he will have been 
player. I never have been. I play hard football, and that's the bottom line." UNC's Zeller out for season 
with broken left wrist 
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -Top­ranked North Carolina's unmatched depth just got a little thinner. 
The school said freshman 7 -foot­er Tyler Zeller will likely miss the rest of the season with a broken left wrist he suffered late in Tuesday night's win against Kentucky. Zeller had surgery Wednesday to repair fractures in two places, a recovery that nor­mally would take 12 to 16 weeks. 
Zeller, who started the first two games in place of injured star Tyler Hansbrough, was injured after taking a hard foul by Ramon Harris in transition after a turnover. He fell to the ground under the basket and got up hold­ing his wrist before heading to the locker room with 1:26 left and

"Coach told the tmun that I was going to lw tlw 'Voice of tlw Irish' li1r the mm~t." Koppel joked. 
Koppel's injury will keep him out of the pool li1r six to snven months, but that surnly isn't going to stop him from staying active with the tnam, even if it is from tho side­linns. 
"I really enjoyed announcing at Um meet," he said. "I also still go to praetiee almost every day and try to help out with coaching and otlwr small things that I ntn do. Even though it's lnss than I wish I muld be doing, I'm glad I'm still able to mntribute in somn way."

meet any weakness you have is going to be exposed because the level of talent there is so high. We've been working since June all the way up to this point." 
He said that it is very tough to treat the championships like just another race. 
"There's definitely more pres­sure," he said. "Some people respond really well to it, and some people don't. It's really unique-it's 1Ok, it's over hill and dale, the weather could be good or bad, you have to be prepared for anything. I would argue it's the toughest race in the whole NCAA system, including winter track and outdoor track." 

Smyth said he hopes to get the front of the pack early in the race, and to stay there. 
''I'm going to put myself in a good spot and just hope for the best, run the smartest race that I can," he said. "Once you've put yourself in that position, anything can happen. 
"As for the team, I mean, we were the last team to get a berth, so the only way to go from here is up." 
This race is also important for Smyth's post-graduate running opportunities. 
"You're only as good as your last race when you're looking to run after college," he said. ''I'm just try­ing to make that last race as fast as possible." 
Smyth was not always a runner. The cross country coach at his Salt Lake City high school convinced him join the team as a way to get in shape for basketball, his primary sport at the time. 


"The cross country coach was always trying to steal athletes from other sports," Smyth said. "I thought it was a good idea, to get in some good workouts and get ready for basketball season. When I got down there, I realized I was pretty good. " 
Smyth was a standout runner in high school, winning the Utah state cross-country championships twice. Though he considered schools like Georgetown and Stanford, he said he found Notre Dame to be the best fit both academically and athletical­ly. 
He made an impact immediately in 2005, his freshman year, placing well in several races. None was big­ger than his 99th place finish at nationals that year. In the last 1,000 meters, Smyth put on a burst of speed to run past 15 competitors and was the fifth Irish runner to cross the finish line, assuring the team would place third overall. 
"I kind of came through in the clutch there, and that was kind of the springboard to the rest of my career," Smyth said. "A lot of people see the individual side of cross country because everyone talks about the frontrunners and what­not, butit's really a team sport. 
''I'd have to say that was my greatest accomplishment." 
The four-time all-Big East and two time All-American certainly has several accomplishments to pick from, and looks to add one more on Monday.

and four rebounds in the effort. Shannon was held to 2­of-6 shooting and had five turnovers. 
Just because this was the sisters' first official game against each other, it was by no means the first time they had squared off. There was a strong sibling rivalry between the two on their backyard hoop. 
Natalie said that her sister usually had the edge in those games because of her height advantage. 
"She used to always beat me, she was taller ... But it only made me better," the Irish guard said. 
Natalie credited those games in the backyard with helping her develop as a player. The most important trait she learned going one-on-one against her taller, older sister was persistence, she said. 
"She beat me, day in and day out, and it only made me more competitive. And I think that's why I'm so competitive now. Just maneuvering around big­ger people and shooting under them and being more crafty with the ball," she said. 
Both sisters said there was never any serious trash-talking on the court -and that there wouldn't be after their first team game against each other -but that does not mean they were not intense. 
"I would always get so mad, so angry. Throw balls at her, curse her -yeah it hap­pened," Natalie said. 
Shannon agreed, and has proof of the games' intensity. "I've got a couple scars from that," she said. 
Shannon said that she has seen marked improvement in Natalie's game during her short college career, and that she will develop into a solid player for the Irish. 
"I think she's gotten huge leaps with every game that she's played. She had a couple of nice offensive moves in there. I even got a hand on one of her shots and it still went in. I'm just really looking forward to watching her over the next three years," she said. 
As Natalie's career is just beginning, Shannon's is start­ing to come to a close -but will likely end as one of the best ever at Evansville. 
After the Notre Dame game, Shannon is 307 points from cracking 1,000 -a reachable feat since she had over 350 points last season. She is also within striking distance of the school's top 10 list in free throws made, rebounds and steals, and is also third all time in blocks with 82 after Wednesday's game. 
Since it is Shannon's senior 
season, the large Novosel con­
tingent sat in the Evansville 
cheering section in the Joyce 
Center. The sisters estimated 
that about 20 family and 
friends drove to South Bend to 
watch the game. 
"I think they were wearing a 
little bit of both. They were sit­
ting in my section because I 
am a senior and they've got 
more opportunities to come 
see [Natalie]," Shannon said. 
Even though the fans were 
all in Shannon's corner, their 
mother remained neutral. 
"I think my mom has a com­
bination of all of our colors on 
her shirt. She said she was 
going to try to do that," 
Shannon said.

would mean increased touches for players like David Grimes, sopho­more Duval Kamara and junior Robby Parris. Parris had one catch for nine yards after Floyd was side­lined against the Midshipmen. 
"I thought Robby Parris stepped up really nicely on Saturday," Ianello said. 'We've played a lot ofguys at a lot of different spots in practice to build ourselves in ease someone broke a shoelace during the game and we had to put someone else in." 
Ianello also said that at 6-foot-4, 210 pounds, Parris's size helps give Oausen a big target to look for in Floyd's absence. 
Weis said that the receiving eorps had suffered injuries earlier in th1~ season and he was not concerned with how they would react. 
"Remember when Michael really started playing was at the expense ofDavid Grimes early in the year. So now that we have a healthy David Grimes back, David and Michael are not the same body type and not the same player but certainly lessons the loss," he said. 
Grimes was hampered for most of the first half of the season with a back injury. The senior captain appeared to be back at full strength last week when he had three catch­es for 22 yards. 
Both Ianello and Weis said that no new players will be thrown into the mix, eliminating the possibility of other promising true freshmen like Deion Walker or John Goodman seeing some action. 
"We would do everything we eould not to have that happen at thi<> time," Wei:; said. 
Goodman and Walker have yet to play this sea'iOn and would txl eligi­ble for a fifth year in the future. 
Floyd, in the meantime, is dealing well with his first real serious injury. 
"He's been fine. lie's been doing -everything the trainer has asked him to do. He's in meetings, he's attentive," lanello said. 
He is expected to be back in prac­tice by mid-December which the coaching staff is confident will be enough to rebuild his stamina for a potential bowl game.

CELEBRITIES BORN ON TIDS DAY: Kerri Strug, 31; Jodie Foster. 46; Meg Ryan.  47; Allison Janney, 49 
Happy Birthday: Weakness will work against you this year, so stand tall and make your point clear as you proceed forward. Keep your mind on work and getting ahead. Promptly take care of any personal financial problems or expenses that arise and you will win. Your numbers are 2, 8, 23,27, 32, 34,44 
ARIES (March 21-April19): Step into the spotlight and do something that surprises ev­eryone. A powerful from-the-heart presentation will generate attention.***** 
TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Don't get railroaded into giving your valuable time to a cause or someone you don't believe in. Don't be swayed by someone playing on your emotions. Keep spending to a minimum. ** 
GEMINI (May 21-June 20): You can make residential moves, investments and some agreements that will help you out financially. Consolidation and a strict budget will help get you moving on the right track before the year comes to an end. Offer a service and make extra cash.**** 
CANCER (June 21-July 22): You have to keep an eye on both household matters and the changes occurring in the workplace. Now is not the time to instigate something new but it is a good time to stabilize your position by strengthening what you already have. 
*** 

LEO (Jnly 23-Aug. 22): Take a good look at what you need to do to make your life better. It will take your mind off what others are trying to get you to do. *** 
VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Focus on yourself and the ones you love. Love is looking positive and a little get-together late in the day will resolve some questions.*** 
LffiRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): Be careful what you say in the heat of a discussion. Concen­trate on what you can do outside the home with people who agree with your position and your solutions. Your creative input to a discussion will get you more involved if you want 
to be.**** 

SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): It won't be worth getting upset with someone who doesn't see things the same way you do. An odd occurrence will leave you questioning what actu­ally happened. You will be able to take care of everything without missing out on what 
you want to do, as well.** 

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Someone from your past will still feel a strong con­nection to you. If you refrained from taking action in the past, do so now before it's too 
late. A challenge will get you all pumped up and ready to go. ***** 
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Don't pay for someone else's mistake. Getting in­
volved in something because someone makes you feel guilty will be costly. Someone trying to get you to do something will give you a false impression regarding your respon­
sibilities or duties. *** 

AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Keep things upfront and honest, especially with rela­
tionship issues. Someone you are close to will question your plans for a bigger and better 
lifestyle. Explain your position but don't pass on an opportunity because of jealousy or 
fear.*** 

PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Your persistent nature will pay off and bring about a change of attitude among your peers. Talks, travel and financing should all be scheduled 
into your plans. Keep talking until the right partner comes along. You are in the driver's 
seat.*** 

Birthday Baby: You have strength of character, determination and the desire to follow through with your plans. You are strong, dedicated, emotional and caring.

Floyd, B. Smith to miss rest of regular season 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Editor 

Thl<> Saturday when Notre Dame takes on Syracuse in the final home game of the season, it will be with­out the services of freshman wide receiver Michael Floyd. 
"You try to build your depth as you go through the whole sea<>on," Irish receivers coach Rob Ianello said. 
Floyd lett the field on the third play from serimmage last Saturday against Navy and did not return. In a press conference Sunday alter­noon, Irish eoaeh Charlin Wei<> said that he, along with sophomore line­backer Brian Smith, had sprained his knee and would be out for approximately four weeks. 
"It would really, really be unrea­sonable to see either one of them playing the next couple of week.r.;," Weis said. "So, you know, the bad and the good. The bad: they miss the next two games, but th1~ good is there will in all likelihood be another game left aller that." 
The win in Baltimore made Notre Dame ollicially bowl eligible. 
In the meantime, l<mello and Wei<> said that they li1el comfilrtable dele­gating Floyd's normal workload to the other regular receivers. This
