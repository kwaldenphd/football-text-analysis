13ritish employ torture 
BELFAST [PNS] -High British officials "knew and approved" the use of torture methods on eleven internees in Northern Ireland, a former Northern Irish official has charged. 
The charges come from John Taylor, who as Ulster's former junior minister for home affairs cooperated with the British in their efforts against the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Taylor says both Edward Heath, then British prime minister, and Lord Carrington, then defense Minister, condoned the interrogation techniques when they "'occupy>-. used in 1971. 
Taylor's charges came after the British government decided earlier this month not to contest a report issued by the European Commis­sion of Human Rights. The report upheld charges by the Irish govern­ment that suspected members of the outlawed IRA interned without 
trial  had  been  subjected  to  the  
so-called  "five  techniques"  of  
torture.  
British  refusal  to  contest  the  

commission report has been inter­preted as a tacit admission that its security forces used the techniques -hooding, . subjection to intense lights and cntinuous noise, forced spread-eagled wall standing and deprivation of food, water and sleep. 
In announcing the decision not to contest the report, British Attor­ney-General Sam ,Silkin promised the techniques would "not under any circumstances be reintroduced as an aid to interrogation." Consequently, he asked the Dublin authorities to drop the case pend­ing before the European Court of Human Rights and cooperate in bringing peace to Northern Ireland. 
But Irish Attorney-General Declan Costello rejected the re­quest and announced that Dublin would continue to press the case to insure that the five techniques not be used in the future. 
Meanwhile, there have been widespread calls for complete dis­closure of the names of all those responsible for the torture before the case can be fully closed. Amnesty International has urged the government in London to name all individuals who knew the tech­niques were bei~g used, and to say

Bishop speaks out against Rhodesian regime 
SAUSBURY, Rhodesia [PNS] • Outspoken Roman Catholic Bishop Donal Lamont, whose pending ex­pulsion -from Rhodesia for his opposition to tile white-suprema­cist government has made interna­tion8I headlines, has become one of the few white heroes for this country's six million blacks. 
"Bishop Lamont is a freedo.m fighter in his own way," says one black Rhodesian from the Umtali region near the Mozambique bor­der, where the Right Reverend Lamont is first bishop. 
"Many blacks who were never Catholics come to Bishop La~ont's church because they see him as a symbol of h~ for the future," says Stanford Mukasa, a journa­lism student from Umtali who works part-time for 'the All Africa Confer~nce of Churches in nairobi. 
Bishop Lamont, sentenced to ten years at labor after admitting he had failed to report the presence of guerrillas on Rhodesia's Mozam-. bique border, recently had his term reduced on appeal to four years, with three suspended. 
The Rhodesian government then announced it planned to expel Lamont rather than let him "pose as a martyr" in iail. 
·The 65-year-old Lamont, who has been the only militantly outspoken critic of the government's racial policies among the Catholic hier­archy here, said he would fight expulsion. 
As he had explained earlier, "I regard it as essential in a leader of the church that I should be an active agent in the peaceful dis­mantling of unjust social structures." 
In pleading guilty to the charges last fall, Lamont said he had been informed by mission ·workers the previous April that guerrillas had approached them for medical sup­plies. He said he did not report

O'Reilly requested that every­one who bought an lELOticket from the Student Union and used a check should stop payment on the check immediately and to come to the Student Union offices to pay for their tickets again. Student Union has a record of names of those students whose checks were stolen. 
The 62 tickets are to be re-issued with the initials of Mike Busick, on them. Student Union has released a list of stolen tickets and anyone using a ticket for those seats that does not have Busick's initials on it will be questioned by the ACC security.

their presence because it would expose villagers to government harassment and undermine his work as a missionary. 
"I hope to please God in my work, not men," he told the court. 
'The real terrorists' 
The Irish-born Lamont, who has been a priest in Rhodesia for 36 years and a bishop since 1957, was first catapulted into the political arena here seven years ago. Ian Smith's Rhodesian Front party had rebelled from Britain's rule and · unveiled a new Republican consti­tution that institutionalized white supremacy. 
''The real terrorists of Rhode­sia," Lamont said then, "are the people who drafted the constitu­tion." 
While Catholics in the scenic Rhodesian town of Umtali immed­iately began to boycott Lamont's church. In recent years, as he stood at the pulpit on Sunday mornings and continued to de­nounce the government's racial policies, hardly a white face could be seen. 
But as Lamont's church became virtually isolated from the prosper­ous white community, Umtali's blacks filled the pews instead. Lamont also preached before Afri­can Prostestant congregations in the region. 
The sturdily built, bespectacled priest set up programs for teaching agriculture, reading and writing to the area's impoverished Shona tribesmen, who labor in huge white-owned farms on fertile lands once freely worked by their ancestors. 
"He is one of the few whites to find full accommodation among my people," said Stanford Mukasa, who has known Lamont for many years. 
Among Lamont's confidantes is Robert Mugabe, the political spokesman for the black guerrilla Zimbabwe People's Army and a leading figure at the Geneva talks on Rhodesia's future. 
After his release from detention in Rhodesia in December 1974,

Mugabe met often with Lamont in Umtali and Salisbury until the black leader escaped to Mozam­bique in early 1975. 
Last year Lamont blunt,!yattacked Rhodesia's press ·for failing to publish a dossier of atrocities committed by the country's secur ity forces on African civilians. 
· Lamontsent the report, prepared by the Catholic Justice and Peace Commission, of which he is presi­dent, to every Rhodesian member of parliament. "Rhodesia is a state without a nation because the administration does not have the support of the masses of African people," he told them.

Then, in mid-August 1976, Lamont issued an open letter to the Smith government blaming the escalation of Rhodesia's guerrilla war on its "racist and oppressive policies."

questioned him and warneahim he 
could face charges. The bishop 
was apprehended Aug. 26 and 
b!'ought to trial in September. 
In a break with the past, Rhode­sia's five other Roman Catholic bishops pledged their support for Lamont and said they agreed that the "precarious situation in Rhode­sia is largely due to the racially discriminatory laws of the country." 
That was the first time the other bishops -who serve a Rhodesian Catholic population of about 
600,000, both black and white • had publicly supported Lamont. Four of the five bishops then attended his trial. 
"I could not reconcile my Christ­ian conscience with Rhodesia's racist government,'' Lamont told the court. 
"The civil administration seems to have lost all capacity for self­examination, self-discipline or self­regulation and to my mind is heading for chaos. Neither time nor numbers are on the side of those who are ruling today."

nis unusual, and indeed fortun­. ate, to have two such qualifiedf'Vl tickets in the runoff as Dave ~~ Bender-Tom Soma and J.J;». Rus­sell-John Geppert. While both tickets have commendable fea­tures, The Observer believes the · ·Bender ticket to be, on the whole, 
the stronger.fVl. Bender has taken an innovative ~ approach to solving problems that 
are within the scope of studentfV1 government. He bas demonstrated ~~a responsiveness in pragmatic 
terms to the acute problems of ball 
life. By increasing the fundsrvl; allot~ed to ~e. halls, he ·plans to ~· reaffirm therr roles as the centers 
of campus social activities. fVl, Everybody promises an open ~' government and people are un­
~ 
~ 
derstandably skeptical when they bear the term. But Bender's weekly forum, which he promises to hold regardless of turnout, to hear student's complaints and suggestions, would be an effective ~ way of gathering input, as well as providing a check on student govenJ.ment. Russell, on the other hand, offers "visibility," propos­ing a "State of the Campus Address,'' an ambitious plan but one that lacks the two-way contact ~ 
necessary for effective govern­ment. Bender, iii addition, has propos­ed the most manageable program
.~ 
for Student Union accountablity offered by the candidates. Rus­sell's zero base budgeting (perhaps ~ borrowed form J"unmy Carter) closely resembles what Student Union is already using, as much as
'~ 
the plan can be used feasibly in a student-run organization. Ben­der's call for more frequent Board of Directors meetings would pro­
[8] 
vide much~needed supervision for the organization. as well as resolve the Student Union-Student Gov­ernment feud, which weakened both their working relationship and their credibility. 
Bender also appreciates the power of the alumni as an influence upon the administration, to consider recurring problems such as limited social space and campus lighting. Russell has not stressed similar cooperation with the alumni. 
It is almost universally agreed that the Student life Council badly needs revitalization. Russell's scheme to use the Hall Presidents' Council ''to aid the SI.C in their IX}


position as a legislative council and consultative body'' is vague and differs little from what is done at ~ present. Bender's plan to re-X structure the SI.C entirely focuses on more student-rector interaction, a novel idea that reflects Bender's IXI 
williness to innovate.· Although it is questionable whether this rector­student group should replace the IX)
SI.C, such communication is des­perately needed. 
J.P. Russell and John Geppert 

have largely based their campaign IXJ on their experience in student government. Russell has extensive experience in hall government and IXI 
the HPC, while Geppert has work­ed within the framework of Dillon Hall government. Dave Bender has ~ been a successful president of X Sorin Hall, and his runningmate, Tom Soma, has made a significant contribution to the work of this IXI 
year's Student Government. But Bender has also provided forward­looking ideas as a basis for his ~ candidacy. Perhaps not all his X programs will be realized, but their progressive, yet realistic, nature earns our endorsement. We urge IXJ 
you to vote for Dave Bender and Tom Soma in tomoiTOw' s election.

P.O. Box Q 
Blackmun and abortion 
Dear Editor: 
This is in response to the letter 

printed in Friday's Observer spe­
cifically and to the small group of 
dissatisfied ''christians'' generally 
who have voiced some vague I 
objections to the law school's 
invitation to Justice Harry A. 
Blackmun to preside at our Moot 
Court arguments. 
I don't wish to involve myself in 

the convoluted discussion which 
emenates from the whole abortion 
issue. My position is that since 
Marbury v. Madison almost at the 
beginning of this country, the 
Supreme Court has managed to 
stimulate an incredible amount of 
controversy; incredible until one 
employs any degree of thought and 
realizes that this is the way it 
should be in our societv. 
However what ha~ always remain­ed pre-eminent is the fact this court, comprised of nine of the greatest legal minds in our country, is the most respected judicial unit in the modern world. 
It must also be pointed,out that no one judge is solely responsible for any decision on that court as Justice Blackmun indicated Tues­day in the law school but rather an opinion is the result of compromise and editing involving all who ~are in the majority disposition. }'_here 
were six other justices who were in· the majority in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton. On the Supreme Court this represents an unusually sizeable majority · 
Should then Notre Dame, which since its inception has been at­tempting to liberate itself from a label of small-minded and pruely catholic, refuse to extend invita­tions to any of those justices? Is this an institution of "papists" as many of our critics, in their supreme ignorance believe? I have been here for seven years and never until now would I have believed any couse for such a label existed. 
1t was a great honor to have a Justice of the highest and most esteemed court in our land consent to share his knowledge and exper­tise with those of us at the Jaw school. lt is an honor most law s::hools can never say is theirs. 
Justice Blackmun's co-judges on Tuesday night's panel had nothing but praise or him and expressed their gratitude to the Moot Court for having given them the oppor­tunity to serve with him. All those who met him found him to be a genuinely warm and sincere man whose family plays a dominant role in his life. His is perhaps the most singularly difficult job in the United States. 
Many other christians and cath­olics, specifically, do not share in the opinion expressed last Friday. It is truly a shame when some people, calling themselves christ­ians, conduct a personal attack on a man of great stature and worthy of more respect than he has been shown in certain quarters. I am even more sorry when I see it occur at this university. 
John P. Mazza 
Executive Director 
Notre Dame Moot Court 

Food for thought 
Dear Editor: 

As I was having my Saturday night dinner, I happened to notice, what seemed a small black twig sticking ,out of the bread stuffing that was served,with the turkey. After moving around the bread stuffing to my dismay I discovered an entire small cockroach on mv 
p~~-• I took it immediately to one of the managers who looked over it and then asked me if I put it there as a joke. I told her that of course not, that I wouldn't do such a thing. I told her which line I got the food from, and then she took the plate to the kitchen in back. I'm to say the least, shocked that I would find a cockroach, an entire cockroach in the bread stuffing. Some how the cockroach got there, and I'm sure all the students wouid like to know how it got there in the first place. Let us hope that this kind of thing never happens again. Cock­roach casserole, or cockroach any­thing is not a favorite dish to many people.

Carter favors long range federal loans for New York 
NEW YORK [AP] • President Carter said yesterday he favors long-ranged federal loans to New York City for five or six years, but he balked at promising an imme­diate loan to save the city from imminent bankruptcy. 
The city, faced with the biggest threat of collapse. since it almost went bankrupt 15 months ago, last week applied for a $255 million federal loan to see it through March. Its first default deadline falls next Monday, and it could face a shortage of almost $200 million by the middle of the month. · 
Commenting on the loan re­quest, Carter told reporters in Washington, "My own inclination is New York City, state and banks will have to deal with the long­range financial picture first and without federal participation. We will make available a continuation 
of a temporary loan. I would be in · unless it gets outside help. Th~ favor of extending the period of shortage will grow to $68 million in temporary loans over five or six March 11, $151 millon on March years," Carter said. 14,. and $198 million on March 15. 
The federal loan program ex­tending up to $2.3 billion a year to the city was set up 15 months ago by President Ford and is due to expire in 1978. 
White House officials later said that Carter's statement "was not 
referringto the current loan request'' for a $255 million loan the city says it needs to avoid going broke in less than a week. Carter's remarks followed a statement Monday night by Trea­sury Secretary Michael Blumenthal that current negotiations between banks, unions and city officials on how to pay off $1 billion in city notes must reach "a status that would permit me to approve this loan." 
City bookkeepers calculated Tuesday that New York will run $21 million short of cash next Mondav

Bain observed how the document 
notes that all four gospels show 
Jesus freely and positively associa­
ted with women,displaying remark­
able attitudes toward them quite 
contrary to the prevailing Jewish 
milieu. 
"The document acknowledges that 'certain women worked for the Gospel,"' Bain stated, "and the Biblical Commission Report attests to this." 
"Of the 27 persons thanked or greated by Paul in the last chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, nine or perhaps ten, are women," Bain continued. "In several cases, Paul insists on specifying that they have tired themselves for the commu­nity. 
"Examples such as these seem to attest to the fact that women indeed were active proclaimers of the message and deserve a loftier title than 'Paul's helpers'," she conclutied. 
Proctor-Smith took issue with the 
sacramental dimension of the docu­
ment as she examined its anthro­
poligical and christological found­
ations. 
''Based upon part ofGenesis1:27, the document agrues that equality is not identity and that sexual 
diff!;!rences are profound and carry 
with them certain roles and func­
tions ordained by God."

Dump the Dons 

The team's goal at the beginning of the season was to attain an NCAA tournament bid. A win against San Francisco this Saturday would not just insure that bid, but give the team extra momentum as they head for tournament play. In addition, the seniors will be able to end their playing career at Notre Dame as as winner. 
Is a team truly ten percent physical ability and 90 percent mental preparedness? The Irish cagers have proven throughout their 1976-77 campaign that the ability is present. With the traditional student support, the mental confidence may even exceed 90 percent. 
This is the last chance you will have to see four seniors perform at the ACC. For these seniors, they have the opportunity to end their Notre Dame career the way they started it--a winner. 
In addition, you can help prove the theory that raw talent alone does not make a team, but also the confidence in yourself.

Football and a Trojan war in Los Angeles were still on the minds of Notre Dame fans when the Irish basketball team tipped off their 1976-77 season in College Park, Maryland. When the Notre Dame cagers defeated the Terrapins 80-79 in overtime, Irish followers decided to give a team that lost their 30 p.p.g. man a chance. 
The Irish had no trouble winning their next three outings, but their fifth game of the year would be the supreme test. Notre Dame travelled to Los Angeles and returned victorious, becoming the first non-conference team to defeat UCLA in Pauley Pavilion. 
When the Notre Dame cagers returned to their home campus, they were greeted by more than 2000 students at the main circle who now believed their team was for real. 
The Irish basketball team then beat Indiana and Vermont to extend their record to 7-0 and give them a number two ranking in the national polls. 
However, the Yuletide season found the Irish on the road and dropping four consecutive battles as well as falling from the national rankings. Although the weather would remain cold, the Irish would not. 
After crushing Stonehill, the Irish had a rematch with the Bruins. The Notre Dame cagers played well, but UCLA would not be denied victory. The Bruins won by five and captured a split in the annual two game series for the fourth consecutive year. 
Although the Irish were beaten, they proved to themselves and their followers that they were capable of playing with anyone in the ocuntry. This proof rebuilt the confidence that was lacking over the Christmas holidays. 
Notre Dame has now won 11 out of their last 12 clashes, the only defeat coming from the hands of the Mountaineers in Morgantown, West Virginia. 
This Saturday, the dream that began at the beginning of the season becomes a reality. The University of San Francisco travels to South Bend with the number one ranking in the country sporting a 29-0 ledger. This will be the season finale for the Dons, who would no doubt like to terminate their regular season play at 30-0. 
No one really expected the Irish cagers to be a national contender as they entered the 1976-77 season. The basketball team is now 19-6, which Head Coach Digger Phelps feels is good enough to secure them an NCAA bid. 
However, invitations are offered the day after the San Francisco clash. With a victory over the Dons, the Irish could not be denied their season quest--an NCAA bid. 
This will be the last home appearance for Toby Knight, Bill Paterno, Dave Kuzmicz and the injured Ray Martin. When they came to dulac four years ago, Notre Dame was in the national limelight. In that year, the Irish snapped UCLA's 88 game winning streak to rocket them to a number one ranking in the wire service polls. 
In 1973-74, Michigan, as they did once again last year, put to rest any ideas the Irish had ofreaching the NCAA tournament's final four. Every year since these seniors have played here at Notre Dame, the Irish have received an invitation to the NCAA tournament. IC t' d
