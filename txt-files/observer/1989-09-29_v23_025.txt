THE INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER SERVING NOTRE DAME AND SAINT MARY'S 
Report stresses need for greater faculty input at ND 

By GREG LUCAS 
Assistant News Editor 
"Significant expansion of the collec­tive faculty role in decision making at Notre Dame is both critical and neces­sary, if Notre Dame is to become the major university it proposes to be," is the charge made by the Faculty Senate Ad-hoc Committee on University Governance in a preliminary report sent to all faculty members. 
The preliminary report does not pur­port to represent conclusions or major­ity opinion among the faculty, but aims to "generate discussion, deliberation, and participation in both the Commmittee's and the Senate's subse­quent activities." 
According to Mohammed Gad-el-Hak, chair of the Ad-hoc Committee and pro­fessor of aerospace and mechanical engineering. the report is prirparily de­signed to rally attention for a compre­hensive faculty survey which will at­tempt to determine the sentiments of the faculty as a whole regarding both it's perceived and ideal role in University governance. 
Gad-el-llak said that the survey will be sent out in a matter of weeks. 
"Faculty involvement in too University does entail institutionalization of structures needed to insure adequate, comprehensive, representative, and genuine faculty participation in admin­istrative deliberations and decisions which affect the faculty's professional interests and the University's funda­mental academic mission," according to the report. 
"The faculty should have a definite role and the administration should con­sult with the faculty in a predictable way," said Gad-el-Hak, adding that the faculty is not "trying to take the authority to make decisions away from anybody." 
"The result so far (of interaction with the administration) has been denial of the presence of a problem. If you don't admit there is a problem, you don't seek a solution," Gad-el-Hak said. 
"I think the faculty plays a very significant role," said Timothy O'Meara, University provost and professor of mathematics, in response to the committee's report. "I think that all of the layers (in the administrative decision-making hierarchy) work pretty harmoniously together," he said. 
O'Meara said that this does not mean that problems do not exist or that mod­ifications are not called for, but rather that the "mechanisms (for faculty in­put) are in place." 
O'Meara agreed with the report's claim that the nature of Notre Dame's faculty has changed in the past several decades and said that it may "very well be appropriate to reconsider the way we (the University) do business." 
The report, which refers at one point to the Faculty Senate as a "neutered debating club," says that a representa­tion problem exists in two dimensions. 
First, the faculty is inadequately represented in the determination of its own corporate and economic interests. The report cites the administration's recent restructuring of faculty health benefits as a telling symptom of the dis­ease. 
According to the report, "A senate survey concerning the question (of health benefits) was ignored by the

'Last Temptation of Christ' at Snite amid controversy 

By SARA MARLEY 
News Editor 
Film sponsors expect no problems at the showings of "The Last Temptation of Christ" in the Snite Museum of Art tonight and Saturday despite the controversy sur­rounding the film. 
"I've been told by the head of security at the Snite that there will be increased pre­cautions," said Theodore Mandell, assistant profes­sional specialist in the de­partment of communica­tions and theater. 
Communications and the­ater is sponsoring the film in conjunction with courses in 
the department, Mandell said. 
According to Phil Johnson, assistant director of Notre Dame Security, a monitor is always on duty during films at the Snite because Security is responsible for the build­ing and its contents. 
"If problems occur, we will staff accordingly," Johnson said. 
"We are not expecting any­thing to go wrong, but we are expecting a large crowd," said Mandell. 
With the possibility of demonstrators outside the Snite, officials want to avoid confrontation between them

educational problems are viewed. 
"It's a change from measuring education by 1ow much we spend to what we're getting for how much we've invested," said Martinez, a Republican. 
"Everyone felt that the president's message was well­crafted and well-delivered and it set the right tone," said Deukmejian. 
He predicted there would be no difficulty in drafting concrete national education goals by the February meeting of the National Governors' Association. 
"The difficulty," he said, "is that many people in the education community resist change. They like the status quo. The difficulty is going to be that there is going to have to be some restructuring, some accountability, some redirecting of funds, to meet the primary objectives." 
Even with cooperation from educators, he predicted it would take 10 years to achieve the.reform aims outlined at the summit. 
"They were saying, 'Look, Mr. President, if this is so important, if education is such a national policy, at least don't reduce what the federal

Marcos dies of cardiac arrest in Honolulu 
Associated Press 
HONOLULU -Ferdinand Marcos succumbed to cardiac arrest Thursday·, but even in death he remained an unwanted exile, his remains barred from 
U.S. air lanes, his political le­gacy still stirring passions in his Philippine homeland. 
Marcos, who ruled the Philip­pines for more than 20 years before being ousted in February 1986, died at 12:40 a.m. Thursday at St. Francis Medical Center. He was 72. 
Doctors said kidney and lung failure and a widespread infec­tion contributed to the cardiac arrest listed as the cause of death. 
The canny, combative politi­cian, who governed at times as a democrat, at times as a dicta­tor, died without facing trial on

U.S. criminal charges he plun­dered the Philippine treasury. 
While Marcos spent nearly 10 months in the hospital, his family begged Philippine Presi­dent Corazon Aquino to let him come home to die, but she re­fused. 
Aquino took office as a result of the popular revolt that drove Marcos into exile, and her gov­ernment has survived six armed attempts to overthrow it. She said she refused again after his death to allow his burial in the Philippines for the sake of "the tranquillity of the state and the order of society." 
Philippine opposition leaders urged her to reconsider. 
"It is just so wrong. It is his birthright. He is a Filipino, the greatest Filipi!fo." said Joe Lazo, president 4lf the Honolulu group Friends of Marcos. 
Later Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration in Washington prohibited any air­craft from flying Marcos' re­mains out of the United States for the Philippines, saying it

WORLD BRIEFS 
The conservative chief of the Ukrainian Communist Party lost his position as boss of the Soviet Union's strongest political machine Thursday to a progressive protege of President Mikhail Gorbachev. Gorbachev sharply criticized the dictatorial style of the ousted official, Vladimir Shcherbitsky, who ran the Ukraine and its 50 million people with an iron hand for 17 years.The new Ukrainian party boss is Vladimir Ivashko, who was Shcherbitsky's second-in-command. 
NATIONAL BRIEFS 
The Senate, caught up in an agonizing debate about the future of President Bush's Star Wars program, reversed field Thursday and restored $600 million to the missile-defense shield. Only two days earlier, the Senate had overwhelmingly agreed to a $900 million reduction in Bush's request for the space-based de­fense initiative in the fiscal year beginning Sunday. 
Heeding President Bush's warning that the nation is imperiled when children "emerge into adulthood ignorant and un­skilled," the nation's governors joined him Thursday in framing national goals for improving America's public schools.The objec­tives, product of a two-day education summit in Charlottesville, Va., range from reversing a dropout rate that sends nearly one youth in three into the job market without a diploma to making educators more accountable for their pupils' classroom perfor­mance. 
Thomas De Barge, a former member of the pop music group Switch and part of the singing DeBarge family, has been jailed on cocaine charges. DeBarge was arraigned Wednesday in Grand Rapids and Wyoming district courts in Michigan on sepa­rate charges of delivery of cocaine and delivery of imitation co­caine stemming from two alleged sales to undercover police in 1988. 
The Charleston airport in South Carolina opened Thursday for the first time since Hurricane Hugo hit as Congress approved its largest disaster-relief measure ever and President Bush an­nounced he would tour storm-damaged areas.Hundreds of resi­dents queued up to apply for federal disaster relief at five Federal Emergency Management Agency centers, a week after the storm smashed into South Carolina with 135 mph winds.Congress Thursday unanimously approved $1.1 billion in emergency aid for victims of Hugo. 
Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards said he kicked his heroin addiction because his children were exposed to repeated police raids. "My kids were growing up getting used to letting in hoards of policemen. There was a knock at the door: Is it room service or is it the cops?" he told British Broadcasting Corp. radio in a New York interview to be broadcast here next month. Richards, 45, known as "the wildest Rolling Stone," also admitted he feared being sent to prison. 
They no longer wear white uniforms with roses in their lapels, but every litter bit still counts to Baltimore's pushcart street sweepers, who pick up where mechanical street sweepers leave off. So popular are the 110 men and women who sweep, shovel and spiff up Baltimore's sidewalks and gutters that when one of them takes a vacation or sick leave, it's not unusual for residents to call the city and ask where they are. 
A promising new anti-AIDS drug still in the early stages of testing will be made widely available while safety and effective­ness trials continue, the government announced Thursday.The plan for expanded distribution of dideoxyinosine, or ddl, marks the first time an unapproved, experimental AIDS drug will become so widely available so early in testing.

Campus safety demands a realistic attitude 
I went down in the elevator to the basement of LaFortune. It was about 2:15 a.m. There wasn't another soul in sight. I was working late be­cause it was my night as news editor, and I was exhausted. I could think of nothing else but slipping into my warm, safe bed. 
I stepped out of the elevator and walked down the dark corridor, past the closed computer lab (it had not begun to operate 24 hours), up the steps and through the double doors. 
Then it happened ... upon opening the second of the double doors, I heard an ear-splitting scream, seemingly right next to me. My immedi­ate instinct was to jump back into the building and pull the door tightly closed. I was terrified. 
I immediately went to call Security to have someone escort me home, but I could not find a phone. The doors leading to the 'God Quad' exit were locked, as were those to the stairs. I tried to go back up to The Observer office, but at that time of night, the elevators only travel one way: down. 
I know I should never have thought to walk home by myself so late, but I was tired, and didn't think to call Security or ask a friend to walk with me when I left the office. Instead, I was stuck in the basement of LaFortune, at least until someone else on staff went home. Not wanting to wait any longer, I peered out the door again. No one was there,so I bolted for my dorm. 
I heard the scream again. Apparently, it was nothing more than a bunch of students near the Peace Memorial. They were just yelling and screaming, having a good time. I felt like an id­iot, but I learned a lesson. 
The scream that I heard could very well have been from an encounter with 'the blue-suited jogger' or a rapist. I read letters to the editor every day about how women on campus should take precautions to protect themselves from at­tack. I read and affirmed the truth of that good advice. Unfortunately, I let it go in one ear and out the other. 
Like many women on this campus, I have al­ways clung to the idea that "it can't happen to me." Well, it almost did-and not just once. I was also on the quad the night that two cyclists started randomly accosting women. I was there when the second incident happened. I was the one who told the woman to report it to Security. If I had left Sorin two minutes earlier (and it was only 8:30 p.m.), it could have been me re­porting the incident to Security instead of her. 
But, I have a guardian angel. and of course, "It can't happen to me." My roommate came home at about 10 p.m. a few njghts ago. She was working late at NVA in

the Joyce ACC. She looked tired and worn. She told me that she had seen 'the jogger' near the JACC, but was able to get back inside without drawing attention to herself. She headed home when she thought the coast was clear. Fortu­nately, nothing came out of it other than a good scare. 
No, I have not been one of the many victims of this recent crime wave, but I have been lucky. We have to take precautions. No, this isn't downtown New York after dark, but there is a definite threat out there. Each one of us has to take our own precautions, but the University can help our situation as well. 
We need to get better lighting on at least the main quads, no matter what the cost. It is often difficult at night to see someone approaching until that person is an arm's length away. The basement of LaFortune should be well-lit, espe­cially now that the computer lab is open 24 hours. Earlier in the year, there were times when the basement the outside stairway were hardly lit at all. We need to institute some sort of escort service other than Notre Dame Secu­rity, so that women will not feel embarrassed to call, and won't have to feel that they must im­pose on a male friend to walk them home. Women even have been approached by as­sailants when in pairs. 
I used to feel safe walking around campus at any hour on any day. I no longer feel this way. I have not been attacked, but I feel like my pri­vacy has been violated and I am helpless. It is as if my liberty were suddenly ripped away from me, as if I weren't safe in my own backyard. 
I may have been wrong to assume my safety in the past, but we can't afford to do so anymore. We must take it upon ourselves to ensure our own safety, because it can happen to us.

administration. Two responsi­
ble administrators acknowl­
edged before the Senate that no 
real effort was made to incor­
porate representative faculty 
opinion in the process. And 
many faculty found the admin­
istration's sundry mailings an­
nouncing aspects of the new 
benefits program both patron­
izing and inept." 
O'Meara declined to respond 
to the claim as it was worded 
in the report, but said that 
"greater faculty input into the 
decision making process" of 
the Administration's Budget 
Priority Committee is 
implieated in the future. 
lie added that in the last 
week he had worked with rep­
resnntative from the Faculty 
Senatn on plans to place a Sen­
ate representative on the Bud­
get Committee. 
The second area of concern 
mentioned in the report re­
gards faculty input regarding 
aeadernic affairs. "If the 
administration is to make wise 
decisions regarding aeademie 
development, it seems not 
unrBasonable to expect the 
administration to eagerly 
solicit the widest and most 
mpresentative Bxpert opinion 
available," the report stated. 
O'Meara said that the faculty 
is and has been ostensibly rep­
resented on a number of 

important decision-making 
bodies. 
Specifically, O'Meara pointed 

to the 1980-82 PACE commit­
tee, which consisted of a eross­
section of faculty. administra­
tors, and students. 
The eommittee produeed ree­ommendations, such as, addi­tional classroom facilities, more social space for students, higher salaries for faculty, im­proved eomputer eapabilities, and currieulum revisions. 
Almost all of these recom­mendations have been or arc in the proeess of being realized, O'Meara said. As an example, O'Meara said that Notre Dame salaries for assistant profes­sors in 1978 ranked only 90th in the nation. 
As a result of the PACE Committee's reeommendations, these salaries were boosted until they were found to rank 17th in the nation in 1987. 
O'Meara further stated that the Aeademic Council. which is the body solely responsible for revising and amending the Fac­ulty Articles. is well represented by faculty. 
The Council eonsists of 15 ex­officio administrators, who serve by virtue of their posi­tions and 18 elected faculty members, according to O'Meara. 
The Ad-hoc Committee's re­port, charges that faculty members can only be elected into the Academic Council after they have been chosen by a committee which itself consists 
of members who are appointed 
by the Dean of the College of 
Arts & Letters. 
"Even allowing that everyone involved does his or her level 'best' to pick the 'best' people to run, faculty do wonder why Notre Dame's Academic Arti­cles do not permit faculty vot­ers to nominate and choose their own 'representatives' in a democratic, uncontrolled, and open poll." 
O'Meara responded that the codified election procedures to the Academic Council was orig­inally formulated by the Aca­demic Council itself, which was adequately represented by fac­ulty, to remedy problems at the time. The Council is still fully empowered to change the Aca­demic Articles, in light of con­cerns that have now arisen, said O'Meara. 
The Ad-hoc committee's re­port outlines four options that are available to the Faculty Se­nate regarding possible courses of aetion in this matter: 
1.'"The situation may be left substantially as it is." 
2. 
The Faculty Senate can adjourn and "quit bothering about governance." 

3. 
The Faculty Senate can unionize. 

4. 
The Faculty Senate can work with the administration "to restructure or modify exist­ing mechanisms for faculty participation in governance." 


Paul Conway, chair of the Faculty Senate and assoc. pro­fessor of finance and business economics, said the the decision to unionize would be the most extreme and the least favorable because of the connotation that unions carry with them. People most often think of a strike when they hear about unionization. "I could not even visualize this (a strike) happening, " he said. 
A unionized faculty would most likely employ other forms of collective bargaining in order to pursue its goals, Con­way said. 
The Senate's most beneficial option, according to Conway, is the one of working with the administration to legislate changes. Conway specifically mentioned giving the faculty as a whole more control in elect­ing members to administrative committees.

"The president would have been better served if somebody had said, 'Look Mr. President, we can do without these three stealth bombers. and we put them in your poeket. and you come in and at an appropriate moment you identify where you think in 1990 a new federal investment can galvanize this reform agenda." 
Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas said, "I want to thank President Bush for giving us the chance for the governors after seven hard years of work on education reform, to have a

Apparitions in Medjugorje­
a talk by newspaper publisher Wayne Weible 
University of Notre Dame, Hesburgh Library Auditorium Saturday, September 30 at 7:00 PM 
The reported apparitions of the Virgin Mary in the village of Medjugorje, Yugoslavia will be the topic of a la.lk by Wayne Weible, newspaper publisher from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. A Lutheran, Weible has authored a book on his experiences with the apparitions and on the impact which the Mother of Jesus has had on his life.

Bakker to take the stand today 
Associated Press 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -Jim Bakker will take the stand to­day to defend himself against fraud and conspiracy charges, his lawyers said Thursday after presenting about 50 character witnesses on behalf of the PTL founder. 
"When it's over I'll talk," Bakker said as he got into his car at the end of Thursday's testimony. 
Bakker is expected to be the last defense witness. 
"It could have been today, we're going tomorrow," de­fense attorney George Davis said when asked by reporters if Bakker would take the stand Friday. 
A federal judge refused Thursday to allow the jury to tour the Heritage USA retreat built by the disgraced television evangelist. 
"It would be a waste of time and serve no purpose for the 18 people on the jury to go see it," 
U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter said. 
Another Bakker lawyer, Harold Bender, contended that the jury and six alternates would benefit from seeing the Heritage park in nearby Fort Mill, S.C. It was closed this week by a bankruptcy trustee. 
The judge clashed the day be­fore with defense lawyers over the number of witnesses for Bakker. Potter said he generally allows only five character witnesses per side. Bender in­sisted his were not character witnesses, but satisfied Bakker backers important to his case. 
The defense has presented at least 72 witnesses since it be­gan its case Sept. 21. More than 50 of the witnesses testi­fied to Bakker's character. 
Jurors heard Thursday as they have on previous days from witnesses who were sat­isfied with their $1,000 "Lifetime Partnership" mem­berships that allowed them three nights a year at the hotel at Heritage USA. 
Prosecutors contend the partnerships were oversold and that Bakker used more than $3.7 million of the proceeds to fund his lavish lifestyle. 
Lola Penny testified she re­cently changed her will to leave her entire estate to the Bakkers without consulting her only child. Julie Wright, a real estate agent from Woodgreen Village, Mich., testified she and her husband bought 30 lifetime partnerships and were "very satisfied" with her $30,000 in­vestment. 
Sharon Creech, a school teacher from Rock Hill, S.C., described her stay at Heritage Grand Hotel as "the next best thing to being ... close to Je­sus." 
Bakker resigned in March 198 7 after it was revealed that ministry funds were used to buy the silence of Jessica Hahn, with whom Bakker had a sexual tryst in 1980. 
Bakker faces up to 120 years in prison and more than $5 million in fines if convicted on all 24 counts of fraud and con­spiracy. 
A group women wearing red ribbons saying "Enough is enough" and representing the International Christian Women Fellowship handed out petitions at the courthouse seeking mercy for Bakker. The petitions were addressed to the U.S. At­torney General. 

Train hits firetruck at railroad crossing, 150 injured; two firefighters killed in truck 
Associated Press 
CALVERTON, Va. -An Am­trak train smashed into a firetruck at a railroad crossing Thursday night, derailing both engines and 11 cars and injur­ing more than 150 passengers. Two firefighters in the truck were killed. 
The southbound Crescent, bound from New York to At­lanta and New Orleans, struck the truck about 7:40 p.m. near this northern Virginia town, said Amtrak spokesman John Jacobsen in Washington. It was carrying 379 passengers and a crew of 20, he said. 
Five cars of the 16-car train remained on the track, said Pat Jeffrey, another Amtrak spokesman. 
Fauquier County Sheriff's Deputy R.R. Crawford said 150 or more people on the train were injured. The injured were transported to nearby Prince

William Hospital in Prince William County and Fauquier Hospital in Warrenton. 
Steve Givens, a spokesman for Prince William Hospital, said the hospital had received 14 injured passengers, three in serious condition and four with minor injuries. Givens said he did not know the condition of the other seven. 
One passenger, in critical condition with head injuries, was flown by helicopter to Fairfax Hospital, said spokeswoman Mary Stuart­Rizk. 
Roger Baker, Fauquier Hos­pital administrator, said 12 pa­tients were being treated in the emergency room for what ap­peared to be minor injuries. 
Asked if he expected more in­jured, he said, "I believe we will receive some." But he also said, "I understand there are a great many people who are not in­jured."

The fire truck was from the 
nearby town of Catlett and was responding to an emergency call when the accident occurred, said Sgt. Butler Grant of the Fauquier Sheriffs Department. He said the two people killed were on the truck. 
Don Ellison, a reporter for WTTG-TV in Washington who was about a half mile from the derailment, said he saw about two dozen buses lined up to carry uninjured passengers. 
Three "huge cranes" went by his post. he said, apparently bound to unscramble the wreck. 
The last reported derailment of an Amtrak train was April 6, when both engines and the first eight cars of an 18-car train jumped the tracks near Empo­ria, Va., 50 miles south of Richmond. 
Thirty-four passengers aboard the northbound Silver Star suffered minor injuries in that accident, which took place when the train hit a switch at its normal cruising speed of 59 mph instead of the 15 mph normally maintained when switching tracks. That accident did $1.8 million damage. 
The worst wreck in Amtrak history occurred on Jan. 4, 1987, when three linked-Conrail locomotives slid through a stop sign and into the path of a 12­car Amtrak passenger train at Chase. Md., killing 16 and injur­ing 174. 
The Conrail engineer and brakeman were later found to have been using marijuana. 
Engineer Rick Gates pleaded guilty to one state charge of manslaughter by locomotive and was sentenced to five years in prison in March 1988. He was sentenced to three years in prison in July 1988 on a federal charge of conspiring to ob­struct a federal investigation of the accident for initially lying to National Transportation Safety Board investigators. 
The brakeman, Edward Cromwell, was granted immu­nity from federal and state prosecution for his cooperation in the case.

Lazo said family and friends would pay respects at Marcos' hilltop home overlooking down­town llonolulu and the Pacific Ocean. Marcos' remains, in a polished wooden casket, were taken by hearse to the mansion Thursday morning. 
The house will be open to mourners 24 hours a day until Sunday, then his body will be taken to a local mortuary for viewing through Thursday, Lazo said.

"We will have adequate secu­rity to ensure that everyone gets to see the film," said John­son. 
According to Mandell, the de­partment has received approx­imately 100 calls in the last two or three days regarding the film. 
Mandell said the Dean of the College of Arts and Letters and the Public Relations and Infor­mation have also received calls and he believes University Pres­ident Father Edward Malloy has as well. 
"A lot of people are calling from out of town and. a lot of them are Notre Dame alumni,"
said Mandell. 
He said articles in The South Bend Tribune, The Observer and The Wanderer, a conserva­tive Catholic newspaper, have called attention to the screen­ing. 
"I am glad that people have such strong opinions about the film that they call us. One of the reasons we show the film is so people will discuss it," said Mandell. 
"We do not require students to see the films if they object to them," Mandell said. 
The department is sponsoring an open discussion of the film with several members of the Theology department on Wednesday Oct. 4 at 7 p.m. in the O'Shaughnessy Loft.

several times and lies unburied because Marcos was not al­lowed into the Philippines for the funeral. 
Tomas "Buddy" Gomez, Philippine consul general in Honolulu and an outspoken Marcos critic, said he would not attend the memorial service and urged Mrs. Marcos not to "exploit her husband's death." 
Mar<~os' death was confirmed at about 1:15 a.m., when his son, Ferdinand Jr., emerged from the intensive care unit and said his father had been taken to "a higher place." 
"Hopefully friends and de­tractors alike will look beyond the man to see what he stood for -his vision, his compas­sion and his total love of coun­try," said the composed younger Marcos. 
"Father's not here anymore. He's gone," Marcos' widow, Imelda, told about two dozen supporters outside the hospital room, said family spokesman Roger Peyuan. Somber but dry­eyed as she left the hospital 
dressed in black, Mrs. Marcos did not talk to reporters. 
Marcos' family had told doc­tors to do everything they could to save his life, and life-support equipment was not turned off until after Marcos died, Peyuan said.

EDITORIAL 

Censorship wrong for controversial film 
The planned showing of "The Last Temptation of Christ" at Notre Dame has become a rallying cry for Christian conservatives on campus. These people find the film offensive and blasphemous, and they believe Notre Dame is wrong for showing it. Their protests seem to be organized to make a media event of its showing and this is unfortunate. Obviously these people did not think it was such a big deal a year ago when student groups sponsored a viewing of the film or when the book on which the film is based was purchased by our library. 
Just because Notre Dame shows the film does not in any way mean that it endorses or agrees with it; the llesburgh Library owns books by Lenin and Hitler yet the University is not being accused of Communism or Nazism. All of these works are made available to students so that they may be exposed to varying and diverse perspectives; students' accessibility to them embodies the essence of a liberal university education. The showing of "Last Temptation" does not mean the University or anyone associated with it espouses the views contained in the film but rather that they believe in the exchange of' ideas and freedom of expression. 
Many students and professors feel that the movie should not be shown at Notre Dame, and this is disturbing. One professor stated that it would be acceptable to show the film in a classroom setting, but this idea seemingly forgets that learning does not just happen in the classroom but outside of it as well. In a community where education is the primary objective different views on issues should be respected and tolerated in order for everyone to grow intellectually. It is one thing for evangelists and demagogues to oppose the film's showing, but when people committed to higher learning and the quest for knowledge call for censorship it is cause for concern. 
The sponsors of the film are not asking each member of the Notre Dame community to agree with the film's interpretation of the life of Christ. Indeed, people who disagree with the film are free simply not to watch it. 
But those who would like to see "The Last Temptation of Christ" should also be free to view it. 
DOONESBURY 
By Joe Moody 

"Two minutes to midnight." "Woe to you, oh earth and sea... " "The Antichrist is alive and well." These are not the primary messages that The Queen of Peace in Medjugorje has come to deliver. Her mes­sages center on Prayer, Fasting, Penance, Holy Mass, Confessions, Peace and Conversion. Sound familiar'? They should. 
This last August I was fortu­nate enough to make a pilgrim­age to Medjugorge, Yugoslavia for the International Youth Conference where the Blessed Virgin Mary has been appearing since 1981 to six young vi­sionaries in that remote com­munist village. 
Many, of course, doubt and claim that this eight-year span of apparitions and miracles oc­curring there and spreading throughout the world is simply "the imagination of children." Such claims leave me feeling somewhat dismayed. Many times my initial impulse is to argue and debate the various points. But I've come to realize that it is not necessary. This isn't about theological con­tention; it's about reality, about a simple return to God. 
I Icr messages arc basic ones, sometimes so basic that we deem them out-dated or old­fashioned: the reality of Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory, the necessity of prayer and faith that is mandatory to begin conversion. The strength of Satan in a modern technologi­cal world. She has come as an echo of the past, the early church, reminding us of the fundamentals of reaching God. 
But this is not the past. She is active now around the world as well as in Medjugorje, appear­ing many places. Yes, there are miracles happening in the heav­ens. Yes, millions arc respond­ing to her urgent call and re­ceiving the grace of Salvation. And yes, she has been revealing ten secrets to the visionaries concerning coming chastise­ments (or disasters) to the earth. In tears, she has ex­plained to the children that the world has reached a point where it cannot turn itself around anymore. Because of this, many are dismissing the messages, altogether declaring that the visionaries are bring­ing us messages of gloom and doom that contradict the hope offered in the Gospels. 
But is that elaim accurate'? What do we foresee happening from On High in the Book of Hevelation'? Or in the Gospel of Mark when Jesus points out, "For in those days there will be such distress as, until now, has not been equalled since the be­ginning." God's judgment, as some would like to believe, is not out-dated. In Lourdes and Fatima, Our Lady also gave similar prophesies to children that the Church itself has de­clared authentic. No, this is nothing new or obscure. 
I remember one evening when Jakov, the youngest visionary (now 18, the same age as my­self), came to our house to talk exclusively to our group. lie is a shy and soft-spoken person yet radiant with an inner joy as arc the rest of the visionaries. Someone asked him, "flow ean you be so full of peace knowing the secrets coming to the earth'?" He answered though the translator, "Anyone who knows the Lord has peace." 
Here is a normal 18 year old (he has been psychoanalyzed as have all the visionaries and proven to be of "very sound mind"). lie has spent his entire teenage life praying hours a day, fasting and attending Church seven days a week. Jakov has received daily ap­paritions of Mary sincn lw was ten. That would be quito an imagination. 
The one thing that struck me deepest about tlw visionari1~s was that whnnever sonwone would pose a complieatl~d or overly-elever question they would smile and simply state. "It doesn't matter." or "I don't know." That's whon it oeeurn~d to me that this isn't about fur­thering the purposes of institu­tions, q unstion i ng tlwologiral doetrinns, or rnligious rivalries. It's about the simple salvation of God that Mary, in thes1~ most urgent times, is helping us to rneeive. It transcends all argu­ment. 
Mary is not here t.o over­shadow God or to take the place of Jesus. She is lwre holding a mirror toward God, rellneting Ilis Grace, in a time when most have forgott1~n what llis n~nection looks lik1~. 
I don't eonsider myself a holy-rolling rnligious l'anatic. Those who know me know I'm l'ar l'rom it. I just b1~lieve in this simple reality: in God, that's all. And much more than I ever did before this. 
As l'or all those who bitterly doubt and attack or just ignore Mary's presence in Medjugorje, Jesus already addressed that issue in Matthew 11 :25 whnn he exclaimnd, "I bless you, Father. Lord of heaven and earth, for hiding these things from the learned and the dever and re­vealing them to mnre children."

The Michigan game has come and gone. The next stop on the roadtripper agenda is Purdue, home of the Boilermakers, golden girls, silver twins, and the World's Largest Drum. 
Purdue University is in West Lafayette, IN, approximately a two and a half hour drive from South Bend. Hoadtrippers can take US 31 south to State Hoad 25 and travel south until you sec the signs for Purdue. Be sure to 1:ross the Wabash Hiver from Lafayette into West Lafayette. 
West Lafayette is a big col­lege town, and the campus is combined with the city. The combined population of Lafayette and West Lafayette exceeds 65,000. The student population is also large-ap­proximately 35,000 students are enrolled at the West Lafayette campus. There is a considerably large Greek popu­lation at Purdue, with 20 soror­ity houses and 45 fraternity houses. 
The residence halls are rela­tively spread out on campus, but they should be easily recog­nizable; most of the dorms are set up in quad formation. Cary quad, one of the largest com­plexes of dorms, is directly across from the stadium. 
For those roadtrippers head­ing down to Purdue today, there will be a performance of the Black Watch and the Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders, in­ternationally known Scottish dancers, bagpipe and drum 
musicians, at the Elliot llall of 
Music at 8 p.m. Tickets range
from $8-$14. 

Saturday afternoon, the place 
to be is Hoss-Ade stadium, 
which seats 67,861 fans. The 
stadium is on the north end 'of 
campus, and most tailgaters 
are held in the parking lot di­

rectly adjacent to the stadium. Winnebagos with the ND !lag can be found outside of Hoss­Ade stadium, just as if it were a home football game. 
Be sure to look for th11 Alumni Association van with a large awning and an ND ban­ner. The van will be in the Me­dia lot directly north of the stadium two and a half hours before the game and will m­main there for about an hour after the game. 

For people spending the night who don't happen to have a friend to stay with on campus, there art1 several hotels in the area. In West Lafayette: Family Inns, 1920 Northwestern Ave. 
(800) 251-9752; Holiday Inn, Interstate 65 North and State road 43 North, (800)238-8000; Sheraton University Inn, US Highway 52 at Cumberland Ave. (800)325-3535; Travelodge, North River Hoad, (800)255­3050. 
The Purdue game is probably the last chance this season that roadtrippers will be able to journey a relatively short dis­tance. Don't miss this opportu­nity to back the Irish and see the Purdue band's proudest possession-the World's Largest Drum.

LAST GAME , 
The top-ranked Notre Dame football team won Saturday's game against Michigan State. 
The unfamiliar, mistake-prone, pressured Irish made the game close, as it took a fourth­quarter drive to settle the game at 21-13. 
"I think our guys will grow from this week," Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz said. "They faced adversity when things weren't going well. 
We played badly and kind of got frustrated and tried to do things that aren't built into the system. There were a lot of mistakes made dur­ing the course of the football game. We have an awful lot for work to do, we're just going to have to go forward."

Tim Grunhard (75) chases down the Michigan defender. Grunhard made the block, allowing Ricky Watters (12) a big gain. 
Grunhard learned from top of the line 
BY KEN TYSIAC 
Sports Writer 

The most important weapon in Lou Holtz's Notre Dame arsenal is a strong running game. Irish offensive guard Tim Grunhard realizes this all too well, since it is his responsibility to knock mammoth defensive tackles away from Notre Dame ballcarriers all game long. 
"I realized when I came here that Notre Dame has al­ways been a running team," says Grunhard, "In every game we must establish the run right off the bat." 
Of course, the performance of the offensive line is crucial to the success of the running game. Without good holes to run through, even quality running backs like Anthony Johnson and Ricky Watters can be shut down. 
Since opponents come into games knowing that Notre Dame's primary objective is to run the ball, they are usually well prepared to dig in and battle the Irish in the trenches. This puts an added burden on the offensive line. 
"There definitely is a lot of pressure on us, but the coaches do a very good job preparing us for it, as we work on the fundamentals of run-blocking every day in practice," says Grunhard, who hails from Chicago. 
Since he weighs in at 290 pounds, Grunhard is ex­pected to block for the running backs as well anybody on the Notre Dame line. As a senior, he expects himself to do something more in terms of leadership on the field. 
"I can try to be a leader on the field by example," Grunhard explains, "But it's really hard to be a leader here at Notre Dame because we have so many great athletes here. But if you show that you're intense and you want to win very badly, your teammates will respect you." 
Two years ago as a sophomore, Tim saw extensive ac­tion on an offensive line which at the time featured co­captains Byron Spruell and Chuck Lanza, two of the best blockers in the country. Grunhard credits Spruell and Lanza, who were both seniors at the time, with teaching him the ins and outs of Notre Dame football. 
"As seniors, Spruell and Lanza exemplified the Notre Dame spirit. They showed me that it is the obligation of a senior to set the tone for the next four years. After playing under Gerry Faust when the team wasn't so suc­cessful, they kept their spirit up into the Holtz years and left as winners," Grunhard praises. 
As the senior member of the offensive line, Grunhard Spruell and Lanza left behind. His desire for perfection helps him advise younger players. 
"If we don't do the little things right, Tim points it out to us right away," says sophomore running bdck Rodney Culver, "He is always trying to help us improve." 
But one good player cannot make an offensive line successful all by himself. On any play, four players can make great blocks, but if the fifth screws up, an oppos­ing linebacker can bust into the backfield and cut down a running back for a loss. Grunhard feels it is most im­portant for the offensive linemen to improve in their performance as a team rather than playing as individ­uals. 
"We must develop a continuity and be able to become a family inside. We must become so tight that we think to ourselves, 'If I don't perform my block, I will let the guy next to me down.'" 
Culver stresses that the concept of the team is very dear to Grunhard. "Tim is not a 'me' oriented person," says Culver, "He is concerned first and foremost with helping the team, and that makes us all perform better." 
Grunhard tries to give a little bit extra to his team­mates on the special teams, where he performs all of the long-snapping chores. He is noted especially for being the first one down the field to pressure the opposition on punt returns, and takes tremendous pride in this aspect of his game. 
"If you can make the perfect snap and get down the field quickly, it gives you a great feeling," he gushes, "I mean, I weigh 290 pounds, so I'm not hard to elude, but I may cause a fair catch, or cause the returner to cut back against the grain. If can do that, I feel I've done a good job." 
Grunhard thinks he and his teammates can do a good job against Purdue tomorrow. He says that Purdue has a typical Big Ten defense with regard to the fact that they line up head to head and drive straight at an of­fense, but he believes the Irish will be able to move the ball against them. 
"If we perform up to our capabilities we should be able to handle Purdue's defense. We'll have to establish the run as well as a more effective passing game, but I firmly believe people will be surprised with our passing game," says Grunhard, adding that he thinks quarter­back Tony Rice will soon show the world that he is one of the best passers in the country. 
Rodney Culver agrees that the Irish should be success­ful against the Purdue defense. "If the line continues to play well and open up holes, we should be successful," he says.

Boilers top Notre Dame in Indianapolis 
By VIC LOMBARDI 
Sports Writer 
Both Notre Dame and Purdue were out to prove something in the 1984 season opener: The Irish hoped to restore a domi­nant football reputation that had so ruefully abandoned them in the first three seasons under Gerry Faust. 
The Boilermakers saw the game as a bit of a grudge matrh. seeking to avenge a 52­6 shellacking by Notre Dame the previous year. 
H1wenge proved more potent than pride. The Boilermakers upset the seV!mth-ranked Irish 23-21 be­
hind the arm of an unexperi­enced junior quarterback named Jim Everett. The loss proved especially costly for Faust, who was later bom­barded by his critics. 
"Anybody who loses with those guys has got to be nuts," said a Purdue assistant coach to an elevator full of reporters aftpr the game. 
"Those guys" (epresented the seventeen starters that re­turned from the 1983 squad, including 10 offensive re­turnees. The Irish had more size, more speed, more depth. 
Yet, mental mistakes-two fumbles, three interceptions and six penalties-virtually gave the game to Purdue, a 
team which was picked to finish in the Big Ten basement. 
The Boilermakers took a 3-0 lead after a jittery freshman split end named Tim Brown fumbled the opening kickoff, allowing Purdue's Mike Rendina to convert his first of three field goals, The future Heisman award winner was pulled from the kickoff return team for the rest of the game. 
But at the end of the first quarter, the Irish went up 14-3 and seemed in total control of the game. Quarterback Steve Buerlein and tailback Allen Pinkett helped Notre Dame drive 77 and 70 yards for touchdowns on its first twQ_ possessions. Then the bottom fell out. 
Purdue scored the next 20 points and forced the Irish to play catch-up. 
Leon Burtnett's new Ace for­mation offense-an early rendi­tion of the run-n-shoot-was very successful against the physical Irish defense. The Ace, which features three wide re­ceivers, a tight end and a single running back, opened up Ev­erett's aerial attack. Everett's final stats: 20 of 28 for 255 yards and two touchdowns. 
Everett, who was battling a freshman redshirt for the starting spot up until game time, hit Jeff Price with a seven-yard touchdown pass early in the second period to cut the deficit to four. After a Buerlein interception, Rendina booted an 18-yard field goal as the first half expired to make it 14-13, Notre Dame. 
In the third period. Notre Dame looked to increase its lead with a second-and-goal from the six-yard line, but an­other costly turnover nixed the drive. Fullback Mark Brooks lost the ball on his way to the goal line and the opportunistic Purdue defense recovered. 
Everett turned this Irish turnover into another Rendina field goal, as the Boilermakers enjoyed their first lead, 16-14.

om the road 

Friday evening, 5 p.m. With two people in the cab and eight of us in the back (equipped with mattresses, a boom box, plenty of tapes and beverages) the U­llaul rolled out of South Bend for what was supposed to be a two and a half hour drive. A small bulb on the ceiling of the van was our only source of light. Those of us in the back had no idea where we were, ex­cept when the van stopped for pit stops. 
Then we reached Logansport, IN. The van suddenly stopped, and the two guys who were up front informed us that our U­llaul had broken down. We tried to push the U-IIaul to a service station. but we gave that up quickly. Finally we de­up to the van, and the familiar crackle of voices over a police radio. We knew we were in for it now-the cops had stopped to see if our friends were in need of help, and it was only a matter of time before they dis­covered the hidden cargo. 
Surprisingly, the next sound we heard was that of the cops driving away. Our friends had informed the officers that help was already on the way. A few minutes later, a wrecker and his wife stopped by and fixed the U-Haul. We were home free. 
That is until one of the more inebriated passengers in the back of the van started pound­ing on the walls. "Hey! I think they're tryin' to signal us out there!" he hollered. The only two of them-let's take 'em on!" 
The cops arrived shortly and made all of us get out of the back of the van. Their next question was "How many of you are minors?" Timidly, we raised our hands. Then thev told us to take out any alcohol that was in the van. 
Two cops, ten kids, several cases of beer, and aU-Haul van stopped at the curb. This was a bit out of the ordinary for the sleepy town of Logansport, IN. The cops told us they would keep the beer until we returned with someone who was 21, and then it would be returned to us. They let us off with a warning (and told us they hoped Notre Dame would kick Purdue's­Luckily, there was a house next to the highway. The owner was kind enough to fix our van and asked us where we were from. When we told him we were from South Bend, he replied, "Oh yeah! I did time with some­one from South Bend." 
After the van was fixed, we continued for a few more miles, and then I started to smell fumes in the back of the van. The engine made a series of loud banging noises, then the van came to a halt on the bridge over the Wabash river. 
Enough was enough. One of my friends and I decided to hitchhike the rest of the way to Purdue. I had the address of a friend from high school who lived there and I figured that he would be able to pu.t us up for the night. The two of us walked along the highway until we reached a Taco Bell. 
Luckily we came across a fel­low Domer in the parking lot who offered to drive us to my friend's dorm. Almost six hours after we left South Bend, we fi­nally reached Purdue. I had hoped to find a women's dorm to stay in, but I settled for the floor of my friend's room. 
So ended the saga or our Purdue roadtrip. incidentally, I was the only person who didn't take the U-Haul back to South Bend. After the game, I walked amongst the tailgaters and was offered a ride home by a very nice family with a Winnebago. 
cided to keep three people by the van in order to flag down help, while the rest of us would hide in the alleyways of Lo­gansport. Forty-five minutes later, our friends signaled us from half a block away that the U-llaul was fixed and we were ready to go. 
It was night, and in order to divert suspicion we turned off the only light inside the van. In the darkness, we felt the van turn the corner, then lurch to a halt. We had broken down twice within ten yards. 
We waited inside of the van in silence, while the two members of our group who were up front tried to fix the van. We could hear the sound of a car pulling wrecker heard the pounding from inside of the van and de­manded that our two lookouts open the door. The eight of us froze as the light from the streetlights flooded the dark­ness of the van's interior. 
The wrecker looked at our terror stricken faces. ''I'm call· ing the cops." he said. 
As the wrecker went off to phone the police, panic set in. We all had different sugges­tions: 
"Let's pay him off so he won't call the cops!" (This was my suggestion.) 
"Let's pretend we're townies and call a cab." 
"Let's book outta here!" 
"Hey, there's ten of us and you know what) and made us leave the back door partially open so we wouldn't suffocate. 
The opening allowed us some light as we drove out of Lo­gansport and closer to Purdue. We rested peacefully in the back of the van for a few miles until the door flew open all the way on the highway. The driver of the pickup directly behind us must have gotten the shock of his life when he saw eight peo­ple in the back of the van. 
We pulled of and decided to keep the door shut tight-we decided it might be better to risk suffocation than to fall out of the U-Haul. As we ap­proached Tippecanoe county, the van broke down again.

Have no fear, Griffin and O'Gill are here 
My cocker spaniel, Darby 0' Gill II, and I have been walking around this campus for years, often in the hours after mid­night. Last week, at 1:30 a.m., I saw a lone woman running across the grass to B.P. I don't  years. I served as the Toots Shor of Darby's Place, in the basement of LaFortune, from midnight to 5 a.m., Sunday through Thursday. The idea behind Darby's Place was to provide a haven for the night- I'm offering my body, and that of my beastie, as hostages to the dark, simply as a way of shaming the younger men into serving as good Samaritans, or if you think I'm trying to be­eome the brains of an escort operation, running like a dating  just phone; we're in the direc­tory.

Later, when the danger had passed, I could offer a little drink of something authorita­tive to the intended victim, to settle her nerves.

The University Min­istry offers a great number of specialized services to the stu­dents. As a generalist in min­istry, I'm always looking for ways to minister to the periph­ery. That is, to make myself available. in helpful ways that no one else has thought of, to people with special needs, who might otherwise get left out in the cold. Keeping the night wateh regularly as a peri­patetic, instead if as a couch­potato hidden in the bowels of the student center, strikes Darby and me as an interest­ing, though chilly, new aposto­late. Maybe, when the snow gets deep, some of the Stan­fordites from the dorm where I live will volunteer to help us when the traffic is heavy. If you think, however, that  danger. Darby's too innocent to be afraid, though he sometimes barks at shadows, or at strangers who ride by in golf­carts. On an October night, when there's a bombers' moon in the sky, I think you'll enjoy having us as bodyguards who can chat wittily on literature and theology, hum tunes from the Big Band era . and tell jokes using the Irish brogue. Or we could pray together, " Yea though I walk through the val­ley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil because Griff is with me ...

Jayhawks will retire jersey in honor of alum Gale Sayers 
Associated Press 
After only three games, Kansas is retiring the number 
of freshman  linebacker  Wes  
Swinford.  
Swinford,  a  walk-on  who  

played eight-man high school football in Morrison, Okla., is the team's second leading tack­ler. Hut that's not the reason his No. 48 will be retired during halftime of Saturday's home game against Oklahoma. 
The ceremony will honor Gale Sayers. who wore the number as an All-American running back at Kansas in the early 1960s. Sayers, who went on to star for the Chicago Hears, is a member of the college and pro football Halls of Fame.

1984. The real reason why the Cub fans are enjoying the time at the top and warily eye­ing the San Francisco Giants. Branded in every die-hard's memory, and emphasized every time NBC opens its Game of the Week, Steve Garvey rounding the bases as he leads the San Diego Padres (an apt nickname for Garvey) in their come-from­behind, three-games-to-two, pennant-dinching win over the Cubs in San Diego. 
It would have gone down in the Chicago history books as the blackest day in North Side history, had not Walter Payton broken Jim Brown's rushing record the very same day. 
Cub fans are ready for an­

other crash. Used to expecting the worst, die-hards didn't gnt mad whnn the Cubs didn't win this season, because they were expecting the collapse at any time, and actually joined bet­ting pools to predict when it would be. It wasn't if. but when. 
But the Cubs fooled them all. These guys, most of whom probably don't even have their pkturns on baseball cards yet, kept winning and kept it excit­ing. The original Wild Thing, Mitch Williams, keTJt the fans in their seats time and time again. 
Join The Observer 

Swinford wore No. 48 for three games before switching to No. 58 last week at Baylor. 
"Gee, I only wore it three weeks and they're going to re­tire it?" Swinford said. "I must be doing something right. 
"Heally, it's a privilege. It will probably mean a lot more to me later in life because I was the last one to wear it." 
Auburn coach Pat Dye has long referred to his team's an­nual late-season stretch against Florida, Georgia and Alabama as "Amen Corner" be­cause, like the famous holes at the Masters, championships are often won or lost there. 
But this year Dye says the fourth-ranked Tigers must 
A two-run lead he could hold, but only after he walked two batters and nearly beaned an­other. As if Cub fans hadn't suffered enough heartache, here was Williams adding heart attacks. 
The Cubs deserved to win the division. Not because they have the best players -no one could make a case for that -but be­cause they had the best team. 
And the Cub fans deserve the cross "Burma Road" before they get to "Amen Corner." 

The Army built the road dur­ing World War II to reopen supply lines cut by the Japanese. Dye has applied the term to Auburn's next five games, a rugged stretch that includes Tennessee, Kentucky, LSU, Florida State and Missis­sippi State. 
"Normally, I would say if we survive Amen Corner, we would be a Top Five team," Dye said. "But I can't say that this year because we've got to travel the Burma Hoad before we get to Amen Corner." 
Saturday marks the 50th an­niversary of the first football telecast. 
chance to celebrate as well. No one has suffered as long or as hard as Chicago baseball fans, where even the good years have bitter endings. 
The Mets are in third place; the Cards can't catch up. Maddux is starting the first game against the Giants Tuesday night in Wrigley Field.

On Sept. 30, 1939, a local sta­tion televised the Waynesburg­Fordham game to several thou­sand viewers in New York City. 
"We were trying not to fall over the cables and look bad," said Michael "Mo" Scarry, a Waynesburg player who later coached with the Washington Redskins and Miami Dolphins. "In those days, we figured, 'What's TV?'" 
Hadio legend Bill Stern did the play-by-play and a young broadcaster named Mel Allen did pregame interviews. Ford­ham, which was then a national power, beat Waynesburg 34-7. But Scarry still has fond mem­ories of the game.

an exhibition game earlier this season, losing 3-1 in Indianapolis on Aug. 24. Grace says that his young team was concerned with finding its own identity in the exhibition. so he made some moves he would not have made in an actual game, which probably hurt his team's chances of winning. 
"It will take a tremendous team effort for us to come away with a victory and keep our home winning streak alive," said Grace, "But if we could play an outstanding game, and if Indiana only has an average game, we will still be unde­feated at home." 
After all the excitement of the game against the Hoosiers dies lege and pro football, it's sort of nice to say we were part of the first TV game," he said. ''I've been in five Super Bowls, but it's one of the thrills of my career." 
Southern California used to be known as "Tailback U." Now Oklahoma State can make the same claim. 
It started with Terry Miller in the late 1970s and continued with Ernest Anderson, Thur­man Thomas and Harry Sanders. Now, Gerald Hudson is carrying on the tradition in Stillwater.

down, the Irish will have to fo­cus their sights on a Wisconsin team which also is laden with talent. Tlw Badgnrs are rur­rently 5-1-2 following a recent loss to Akron. 
The Badgers are led in seor­ing by Jeff Sehiedemynr, Josh f'lyr, and Bret LaFerrera, who Pach have thn~e goals on tlw season. Last year, Wiseonsin played the Irish to a 0-0 dead­lock. which brought their series record against Notre Dame to 3-1-2. 
Grace says that Wisconsin also will be gunning for the Irish, primarily because the Badgers felt they should have won last year's contest. In that game, Grace was foreed to hold out some of his starters be­cause of injury and illness.

Stewart records 21st win asOakland lassoes Rangers 5-3 

Associated Press 
OAKLAND. Calif. -Dave Stewart, making his final start before the playoffs, pitched five shutout innings for his 21st victory as the Oakland Athletics beat the Texas Rangers 5-3 Thursday. 
Stewart, 21-9, matched his career high for victories set last season. The right-hander, who is scheduled to start the first game of the playoffs next Tuesday, gave up four hits. 
Todd Burns pitched two scoreless and Matt Young was charged with all the Texas runs in the ninth, including Ruben Sierra's 29th homer and club record 119th RBI. Dennis Eckersley got the last three outs for his 33rd save. 
Dave Parker hit his 22nd homer and singled home a run for the A's, giving him 97 HBis this season. The second-inning horner came off Brad Arnsberg, 2-1. Parker added an HBI single in Oakland's four-run third. 
Red Sox 12, Brewers 6 

Nick Esasky extended a ca­reer high with his 30th homer and Rick Cerone hit a two-run shot as Boston took a one­game lead over Milwaukee in the opener of a battle for third place in the AL East. 
Boston's Mike Boddicker, 15­11, allowed nine hits, including a two-run homer by Hobin Yount. and four runs in five in­nings. The 15 victories are the most since he won 20 games for Baltimore in 1983. 
The Red Sox pounded Mil­waukee starter Don August for seven runs on five hits and four walks in less than three in­nings. Boston took a 4-0 lead in the second on a two-run single by Kevin Homine and Cerone's fourth homer. Esasky lined a three-run homer into the screen in left with none out in the third.

"At the beginning of the sea­son I said that freshman would play a large role on this team," said Irish coach Bob Bayliss. "I'm pleased with their perfor­mance considering the in­clement weather and the fact that they played some matches indoors and some outdoors." 
Unfavorable weather or not, the Irish will face some of the best competition in collegiate ll~nnis, including representa­tives from Army, Ball State, Colorado, Harvard, Illinois, Miami (Ohio). Michigan, Minnesota. Temple, Vanderbilt, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. 
"Many of the players will be ranked in the top 100 this year, and most were ranked last year," said Bayliss. "The Invitational gives us a chance to show our facilities to other teams, and it's an opportunity to see some of the best players and coaches in the college game today." 
First-round draws could play a key role, as last year's singles runner-up from Harvard re­turns, as well as the doubles champions from \'\'isconsin. 
The Irish boast the defending singles champion in sophomore Dave Dil.ucia, who will play in tlw A Flight , along with Walter Dolhare and Coleman. The all­frnshrnan B Flight consists of

Pinch hitter Alvin Davis greeted Cleveland reliever Jesse Orosco with a tie-breaking two­run double in the eighth inning and Dave Valle also doubled home two runs. 
With the score tied 2-2, Henry Cotto drew a one-out walk off reliever Steve Olin and stole second. Olin walked Darnell Coles and Davis batted for Jim Presley. Orosco relieved but Davis' double spoiled the strat­egy. Rudy Seanez replaced Orosco and struck out Jay Buhner. After an intentional walk to Ken Griffey Jr., Valle doubled horne the final two runs. 
Olin came on to start the eighth after Bud Black held Seattle to two runs and five hits.Seattle starter Brian Hol­man pitched a six-hitter for his sixth complete game, yielding home runs to Joe Carter, his 35th, and Joel Skinner, his first. 
Angels 2, Royals 0 
Bert Blyleven capped a fabu­lous comeback season with a seven-hitter for his league­leading fifth shutout as Cali­fornia ended a six-game losing streak. 

Blyleven, 17-5 after going 10­17 with Minnesota a year ago, walked one and struck out six in pitching his eighth complete game. It was the 60th shutout of his career, one behind Tom Seaver, who is eighth on the all­time list. 
Blyleven's winning percentage of .773 set an Angels single­season record and his 2.73 ERA marked the first time he fin­ished a season below 3.00 since 1984 when he pitched for Cleveland. 
The Angels got a run off Larry McWilliams in the first inning. Devon White led off with a single, was sacrificed to 
Zurcher, Schmidt, and Hosas. 
"Walter and Dave have done a great job as far as getting us to come together as a team," said Coleman. 
By facing such strong compe­tition in his flight so early in his college career, Coleman has recognized that it will only im­prove his game. 
''I'm just trying to get some experience and get a feel for college tennis," said Coleman. "I can only go out and play my hardest and let the chips fall where they may." 
With such an optimistic out­look, don't be surprised if Coleman and the rest of the youthful Irish squad come away with a few upsets this weekend. 
second and scored on Chili Davis' single. Brian Downing hit his 14th home run in the eighth. 
It was Blyleven's ninth victory following a California loss and left the Angels one game behind the Royals in the race for sec­ond place in the American League West with three games remaining.

Irish women's golf at MSU Invite 
NO fresh off championship at Indianapolis tournament 

By BARBARA MORAN Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's cross country team will be in action this afternoon when it hosts the National Catholic Invitational at 3 p.m. on the Burke Memorial Golf Course. 
The Irish will host a strong field of 21 teams and hope to improve on their sixth-place finish from last year. 
"Our goal is to place in the top five," said senior captain Wendy Murray. "We really want to do well. since it's our first home meet and such a big one." 
Notre Dame will host teams from all over the country, with thn fight for first place ex­pncted to be between Boston Collnge and Providence College. 
"Providence should be awe­some," said Irish coach Tim Connelly. "They could be one of the top five teams in the coun­try. Boston College also has a very good team and I think DnPaul could surprise some p!Hlple and be right near the front." 
In addition to these national powers, Notre Dame will also

have the opportunity to run against Midwestern Collegiate Conference rivals Dayton and Detroit. 
Murray said that the team's tough 1 7-46 loss at the hands of Georgetown two weeks ago had no effect on team morale, and that the team is ready for and optimistic about the National Catholics. 
"The Georgetown meet was a starting point," said Murray. "We went in there based on re­ality and just wanted to see how well we would run to-
Gretzky or Lemieux: Which of the'Great Ones' is greater? 
Associated Press 
PITTSBUHGII-Gretzky is 
99. Lemieux is 66. Just like thnir numbers, Gretzky and Lemieux have turned hockey upside down. 
Waynn Gretzky of the Los An­gnlns Kings is 28 years old and has been the best player in hoekey for a decade. He is only 14 points behind Gordie Howe on the National Hockey League's all-time scoring list, which means he will break Howe's record almost immedi­atnly. 
Gn~tzky has played 10 NHL seasons. Gordie Howe played 26 seasons. or until he was al­most 50. Imagine somebody breaking !lank Aaron's home run record -at age 25. 
Imagine. 
Now, imagine somebody who 
might be better. 
Mario Lemieux of the Pitts­burgh Penguins, who will be 24 on Oet. 5, might have been the best player in hockey for the last two years. Just a few years after Gretzky set single-season records for goals (92) and points (215) that were almost beyond imagination, Lemieux is threatening to break them. 
Compare the salaries. 
Gretzky is getting $20 million over eight years, Lemieux is getting $12 million-plus over five years in a sport where journeymen players earn less than some journeyman plumbers. 
Compare the statistics. 
Gretzky owns 50 NHL records and has scored 637 goals and 1,837 points in 10 NHL sea­sons, four of them on Stanley Cup champions. Lemieux has scored 300 goals and 715 points in five NHL seasons, four of them while surrounded by questionable talent on non­playoff teams. 
"There is hockey," said Paul Coffey, who's been a teammate of both, "and then there's su­perstar hockey." 
Compare the situations.

Lunch and dinner provided Frisbee, volleyball, and more

"Good communication and 
running in a pack isn't only good· psychologically," Murray continued, "but it's also neces­sary to win." 
Connelly also stressed the need for his team to work to­gether and praised the strong running of Irish sophomore Lucy Nusrala. Notre Dame's top seeded runner, Nusrala is the only returning member of the Irish squad who placed in the top five overall at last year's National Catholics. 
"Lucy ran very well against the Hoyas," said the coach. "She ran aggressively among the leaders. She needs to do that every week. The rest of the girls need to run together as a group. They didn't do that against Georgetown, so hope­fully they learned their lesson and will run as a team in the National Catholics."

Lemieux has literally saved hockey in Pittsburgh. The Pen­guins sold only 3,000 season tickets in 1983, the year before he arrived; this year, they've sold 11 ,000-plus and could have sold a few thousand more. 
And -shades of the Super Bowl Pittsburgh Steelers -the Penguins even attracted stand­ing room only crowds at their preseason practices. 
Gretzky has made hockey nearly as popular as Lakers' basketball in trend-conscious Los Angeles, where the only thing fashionable on ice before his arrival was Wild Turkey. 
Compare the superlatives. 
Many think Gretzky is the greatest athlete in any team sport during the 1980s. "Gretzky tries to do the impos­sible on every shift," Lemieux said. 
Lemieux's teammates have seen him do the impossible. 
"When Gretzky set his record (of 215 points), every player in hockey thought it was un­breakable. It seems unbeliev­able, but it just a matter of time until Mario breaks the record," teammate Rob Brown said. 
No matter how you compare them, Gretzky and Lemieux are beyond compare -except with each other. 
Gretzky the Great. Lemieux Le Magnifique. 
Five years ago, after scoring 282 points in a single junior season, Lemieux was called the second coming of Gretzky. Now, he may be the No. 1 player in the world. 
No longer is he the next Gret­zky. Now the question is: Who's the next Lemieux? 
"Mario is amazing, unbeliev­able, awesome," Penguins coach Gene Ubriaco said. "I once asked myself, 'Could Gret­zky follow Gretzky?' Mario has come in and done what no one but Gretzky has done."' 
"If you asked me three or four years ago who is the best player, there is no question I

would have said Wayne Gret­
zky," Detroit coach Jacques 
Demers said. "But, right now, 
the best hockey player in the 
world is Mario Lemieux. He's 
taken over. He's the most tal­
ented." 
Others disagree, such as Philadelphia Flyers general manager Bobby Clarke, who still favors Gretzky over Lemieux. But, for the first time, Gretzky and Lemieux are play­ing on level ice. 
Lemieux has been the NHL's 
scoring champion the last two 
season and the league's MVP in 
1987-88. Gretzky, no longer 
surrounded by the superstars 
who helped him win four Stan­
ley Cups in five years in Edmon­
ton, was the MVP last year for 
the ninth time, but the Kings 
were eliminated in the second 
round of the playoffs. 
Brown, who scored 115 points on Lemieux's line last season, recalls reading a news­paper story that argued the Oilers could never win a Stanley Cup with Gretzky because he dominated the puck so much. 
"Now you hear the same knocks against Mario," Brown said. "And I think Mario's go­ing to go out and prove them wrong." 
Last season, with Gretzky's Kings already eliminated, Lemieux tied NHL playoff records with four first-period goals, five overall and eight points in a 10-7 playoff victory over Philadelphia. The Penguins lost the second-round series in seven games, but Lemieux had 12 goals and 19 points in 11 playoff games. 
"Mario Lemieux showed why he is the best hockey player in the world," Penguins goal­tender Tom Barrasso said. 
"He can take control a game like nobody else can," team­mate Bob Errey said. "Someday, he may score 10 (points) in a game." 
That someday may be soon. 
Last New Year's Eve against New Jersey, Lemieux recorded one type of each goal possible: even-strength, short-handed, power play, penalty shot and e~pty net in a five-goal, eight­pomt game.

A's have just enough bash, pitching to defend division title 
Associated Press 
OAKLAND, Calif.-The once­feeble American League West likely will boast three teams with 90 wins by week's end. But it still takes about 100 to con­tend with the repeat champion Athletics. 
Just like last year, Oakland gets to spend the final weekend padding its stats and mapping out its approach to the playoffs while the AL East leaders ex­haust all resources just to sur­vive. 
"The loss we had in LA (in the 1988 World Series), we don't forget," relief ace Dennis Eck­ersley said as the A's savored their second straight divisional crown, clinched Wednesday night. "But we can enjoy this one for about four or five days." 
In the meantime, there are goals, lots of them. 
Going the rest of the way without a defeat would produce a second consecutive 1 00-win season, last achieved by the Baltimore Orioles a decade ago. Dave Parker, who homered Thursday, needs just four runs batted in for his first 100-RBI in the American League and fifth overall. 
Mike Moore, 19-11 after pitching a one-hitter for seven innings in the 5-0 clincher over Texas, goes for the 20-victory plateau Sunday against Kansas City. And Carney Lansford, whose .336 batting average trails Minnesota's Kirby Puck­ett by four percentage points, seeks his second AL batting crown. 
"That hasn't been on my mind at all," Lansford said, ending a month-long silence with the Bay area media. "I wouldn't trade this (title) for t~at. I wouldn't mind seeing Kirby Puckett do it so a right­handed hitter finally wins it again." 

Lansford, who also has qui­etly stolen 37 bases, is proudest of the way he and his team­mates held up through their ailments this year -and not just the well-publicized injuries that sidelined Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire, Walt Weiss and Eckersley. 
"This is more gratifying than last year," he said. "There have been a Jot of days when guys like Dave Henderson, Dave Parker and myself went out there and played even though we were dog-tired and banged up, because we had to play ... I think everybody realizes what we had to go through this year." 
Mark McGwire, disabled early in the year by a back injury, heard rumblings all season long about his low batting av­erage, now .226. But he still managed to lead the club with 31 homers to become the sec­ond player in history to hit 30 in each of his first three full seasons; Canseco was the first. 
"This year's a lot more meaningful," McGwire said. "I can't remember but a handful of blowout games this year. Last year, it seemed like we had a lot more. 
"This year, there's going to be three teams in our division with 90 or more wins, and only one team gets to go. That's tough to take. If they were in the East, they'd be running away with it." 

Canseco isn't leading any cat­egory this year following his MVP season. But he has hit 17 homers in less than half a sea­son, and considers it an im­pressive achievement in light of his wrist injury and bad public­ity that has dogged him since last winter. In the clincher, he gave the A's the lead for good with a homer that he described on his 900 number as going "a mile high and a mile far" -ac­tually an estimated 456 feet. 
"I've been at the bottom and I've been at the top," Canseco said. I've been from riches to rags and back to riches. I've been everywhere this year." 
Rickey Henderson, who ar­
rived in a trade from the Yan­kees at midseason, is savoring his first true division title. lie was in on a strike-year division crown with Oakland in 1981. 
"I got the first real one," he said. "This is a great feeling, much better than the half-year. In the playoffs last year I sat in the stands and wished I could play for the A's. This is like a dream come true." 
General Manager Sandy Alderson was on hand for the celebration before heading to Arizona to scout Instructional League players. He said the A's have carried the burden of high expectations for nearly two years. 
"Let's face it, since back in May of '88, all we've done is put ourselves in a position to blow an opportunity," Alderson said.

Irish soccer faces stern home tests in Wisconsin, Indiana 
By KEN TYSIAC Sports Writer 
A couple of very tough oppo­nents invade Krause Stadium this weekend to face a Notre Dame soccer team bent on proving it can play with the best teams in the country. 
Notre Dame battles its in­trastate rivals from Indiana University on Friday at 7:30, and then faces the Badgers from Wisconsin at 2 p.m. on Sunday. Judging from the repu­tations these teams bring into this weekend, the Irish have their work cut out for them. 
The women's soccer team will host Indiana before the men's match Friday, then plays Michigan at 10 a.m. Sunday.

NO tennis set to host Fallon Invite 
By DAVE McMAHON Sports Writer 
Some of the top men's tennis players in the nation begin ac­tion today in the Tom Fallon Invitational, one of the premier tournaments in the Midwest. 
Starting times at the Courtney Courts are 8:30 a.m. on Friday and 9 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday.

of the season. The game also holds special significance for Irish coach Dennis Grace, since he served under Indiana coach Jerry Yeagley both as a player and an assistant coach. 
"He (Yeagley) and I are very close," said Grace, "but right now he is very intent on putting Dennis Grace back in his place. As far as I know, Notre Dame is the only team that has played Indiana in each of the past two years and not lost to them, so he (Yeagley) is out to even the score." 
Indeed, a 4-3 loss two years ago at Notre Dame and a 1-1 tie last year in Bloomington against his former assistant's team must be eating at Yeagley. In fact, the Indiana coach went so far as to predict a Hoosier victory on local television. 
The Hoosiers boast a 6-1-1 goals-against-average of 0.71. 


"Kenny Snow is a brilliant player," said Grace, "He's very dangerous, probably one of the most dangerous players I've ever seen. But he has not done much damage in the past to Notre Dame because of a de­fender named Paul LaVigne. I expect Paul to have a sensa­tional game again and hope he will be able to neutralize Kenny Snow."

Providence, with four team members who can run the mile in four minutes or less, pre­sents Notre Dame with its stiffest challenge. 
The Friars, whose runners are mostly from Ireland and England, are ranked second in the nation in the latest cross country polls. Notre Dame is 15th. 
"Providence is obviously the favorite, and we are certainly the underdog," Irish head coach Joe Piane stated. "If we run well, I know that we can run with Providence." 
Providence came in as a heavy favorite last year, but the Irish the home-field advantage should be a big factor. 
"If this game were at IU, we would have to play in front of thousands of hostile fans," said Kern. "But we know how to play well here at Krause, and if we hold them in check on de­fense, we know we have a chance against them."

"The whole season rests on the District Meet," Piane said. "If we can continue to improve until then, I'll be happy."
