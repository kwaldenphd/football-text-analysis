President emeritus adjusts to new role 

Father Edward Malloy spends time traveling, reading during sabbatical year 
By KATE ANTONACCI Associate News Editor 
Since moving out of his Main Building office in late June, University President Emeritus Father Edward Malloy has been doing just what h~ said he would before he ?tepped down last spring -enjoying his sabbatical. 
"I've always been some­body that actually, by instinct, always looked for­ward to the next thing that I did," Malloy said. "It's a sab­batical year ... I just come over [to the new office] every day, basically work from nine to four, then I take off and I go and I walk around the lakes at a fast pace and do whatever else is on the hori­zon for the day." 
Malloy, whose new office is located on the third floor of DeBartolo Hall, has adapted well to his new role. His new office is located in an area that students frequent, which gives him the chance to interact more with the Notre Dame community than when he was President. 
"I really like this new set­up," he said. "It's a nice part of the campus, a busy part of the campus." 
While other locations on campus were discussed for possible office locations ­such as Hesburgh Library or Malloy Hall -Malloy said his space in DeBartolo was free and proved an ideal location. 
"I like that students stop by and say hello," Malloy said.

Students excited for ceremony 

Campus prepares for inauguration of new University president 
By ADRIENNE RUFFNER News Writer 
Notre Dame students must 
choose between attending a 
historic University event or 
reveling in two extra after­
noons of free time Thursday 
and Friday. 
Classes are cancelled after 
1:45 p.m. Thursday and after 
11:30 a.m. Friday in celebra­tion of the inauguration of Father John Jenkins as Notre Dame's 17th president. Though all students are encouraged to attend the events, and received· a formal invitation to events such as the academic convocation Thursday and school-wide Mass Friday, the events are not mandatory. 
"I would very much encour­age students to participate because it is a special moment. It's one of the ways of showing solidarity with the new president," said University President Emeritus Father Edward Malloy, who had his own inauguration in 1987. "And the same way stu­dents were very good to me ... I think they ought to show the same kind of respect for Father Jenkins as he begins his term of service as presi­dent." 
Many students acknowledge thf.l immense importance of the activities and plan on attending at least some parts

New. SMC program draws more to games 
By MARY CONROY News Writer 
Sophomore Alii Grimmer has not missed a volleyball game this year. Each time the team plays at Saint Mary's, she brings her small blue business-size card with her to get stamped on the way into the game. As part of this new "Get Stamped" pro­gram, students like Grimmer have been showing increased support for the College's sports teams. while hoping to get a free T-shirt at the same tinw. 
The Saint Mary's Athletic Department developed the new program this year to promote student and faculty attendance at varsity games, tournaments and events. "Get Stamped," which began in August, gives students the cards the first time they attend an athletic event, Athletic Director Lynn Kachmirak said. 

At each additional visit, the student gets her card stamped, and after the 1Oth stamp, the student receives a free T-shirt. The card is valid for all varsity , events throughout the entire school year. 
"!The program) is definitely an incentive, and way to show SMC pride," Grimmer said. "It is

Freshman to star in reality show 
By MADDIE HANNA Associare News Ediror 

He walks the Notre Dame campus just like any other student, proudly sports his Notre Oame apparel and plays interhall soccer for Morrissey. But, unlike other students, he car­ries around a video camera and is soon to be a small-screen star. 
Conor Kelly is one of six college freshmen participating in a new online reality show for AOL's RED service for teenagers. Project Freshman features short episodes filmed by each freshman documenting college life, including Real World-style film confessionals.

University announces updated Hurricane Katrina collection total

INSIDE COLUMN 
Words from 


a convert 

No, Notre Dame did not motivate me to convert to Catholicism -since I was born and raised one -but it did make me change my stance on , football. Coming from Latin America, 
soccer has always  
been "the king sport" in my  Sofia Bailon  
mind. I grew up  
watching games on TV, going to  Photographer  
matches, playing  
and talking about  
it with friends.  

Coming to Notre Dame I soon learned everything here was about American football, which I knew nothing about. I remember, at my first game, looking at the timer show­ing 15:00 and thinking the game would be pretty fast compared to soc­cer's 45 minute halves. Was I in for a surprise! When those supposed 15 minutes had taken an hour to pass by, I realized this was an entire day's event. You can imagine I didn't understand much of what was hap­pening on the field either, so through­out the game I kept imitating stu­dents around me; cheering when they cheered, booing when they booed. 
Now, as a senior, football is totally different for me. I finally understand what's going on, but most important­ly I share with the Notre Dame family the emotions that are brought about with every game. 
I've had the opportunity to watch games from the sidelines, taking pic­tures for The Observer. I was at Ann Arbor less than two weeks ago and as I was putting the camera and lenses away when the· game was over, the entire football team began running in my direction because there was a large crowd of Irish fans in the stands right above me. I admit part of me feared for my life and the equip­ment as the players ran and jumped around me, but it was amazing to see up close the happiness in the team's faces, the pride in their achievement -since we hadn't beat Michigan at the Big House since the early 90s­and most importantly their eagerness to show the fans this victory was for them. 
Being in the student section is quite an experience as well. Beginning by tailgating as early as breakfast, con­tinuing to make one's way into the stadium, rooting for the Irish at the top of your lungs, being carried in the air celebrating a touchdown with push-ups, enjoying the band's fantas­tic performance during half-time, and finally -regardless of the out­come -joining with those around you to sing the Alma Mater, proves that at the end of the day's event we acknowledge the importance of being here and being part of this family. 
I do hope for more moments com­parable to the win at Michigan for this season, but the Notre Dame spir­it helps me bear with the losses. 
In regards to my conversion, I am still a soccer fanatic, but my time here has gotten me to love football as well.

Chinese pollee bust bogus booze bootlegger 
SHANGHAI, China-What happens to old liquor bot­tles? If it's China, they might end up baek on the bar shelf, filled with bogus booze. 
At least 10 people have been arrr.sted and more than 7,000 bottles of phony whiskey, eognac and other spirits seized following a monthslong investigation into a nationwide bootleg­ging operation, the official China Daily newspaper reported Tuesday. 
The gang, headed by a 45­year-old man identified only by his surname, Lai, collect­ed empty, discarded bottles of name brand liquors such as Chivas Regal and Remy Martin, and then filled them with generic drinking alcohol blended to taste, look and smell like the real thing, the report said. 
"Wine samplers said the fake alcohol Lai mixed ... would easily have fooled ordinary consumers," the newspaper said. 
Angry gator wranglers quit reptile hunt 
LOS ANGELES -Gator wranglers from Florida have abruptly quit their search for the city's elusive 7-foot alli­gator, livid that they were publicly ridiculed by a brash Hurricane Katrina evacuee that a councilwoman brought in to help nab the reptile. 
Thomas "T-Bone" Quinn described as "retarded" the tactics employed by the wranglers from Orlando­based Gatorland. He made his comments on Saturday after being escorted by Councilwoman Janice Hahn to Ken Molloy Harbor Regional Park in South Los Angeles, where the gator dubbed Reggie has inhabited a lake for at least two months.

Saint Mary's freshman presidential elections reach runoff 
189 students votefor first year class representatives in preliminary round; results will be announced Thursday 
By MEGAN O'NEIL Sainr Mary's Editor 
After topping a field of five tickets in Monday's election, Saint Mary's first year presi­dential and vice presidential running mates Francesca Johnsori and Pauline Kistka will face Mary Conroy and Katie Connolly in a runoff election today. 
Johnson and Kistka finished first in Monday's vote with 
49.73 percent and were fol­lowed by Conroy and Connolly, who earned 25.67 percent, elections commis­sioner Danielle Lerner said.

something to do, and you get a free T-shirt." 
Before each game, the athletic department sends out an e-mail to all students reminding them to attend the games the follow­ing day and to bring their cards. 
The program was started due to a lack of home support for the Belles, Kachmirak said. 
Many brainstormed for an idea, but it was athletic trainer Stacy Schlumeohm who actually came up with the "Get Stamped" program. Kachmirak said. 
"The program was created basically to build up more spirit and enthusiasm for varsity pro­grams. So far it has been a suc­cess," said Kachmirak. "It's a great way for students to sup­port their classmates and room­mates. Students are excited at the events, and slowly but surely more students are coming up asking me for a card." 
Many students have found the frequent e-mails to be helpful and a good way to get students to support teams. 
"I hear about [the program] a lot and get a ton of e-mails [about it]. It's definitely an 
incentive to go to games this school year," said senior Alice Holohan, who said she has not had the chance to attend a game yet this year. 
Despite the publicity received by the program, some students were not aware of its existence. Other students have been extremely active in the program, and are well on their way to receiving their free T-shirt, Kachmirak said. 
The "Get Stamped" program is just one of the tactics that the Saint Mary's Athletic Department is using to increase fan support. Through the coor­dination of Kachmirak, royal blue game day T-shirts are worn by librarians, cooks, dining hall staff, custodians, maintenance crew members and the staff of the Jlealth and Wellness center on every home game day. Even though it is only late September, the fan support has increased, Kachmirak said. 
If the Get Stamped program works year-round for the Belles, other non-athletic departments and committees of Saint Mary's may adopt the program as well to increase .support that they need, Kachmirak said.

Bookstore. Some student groups are still collecting, and the University will keep accepting donations through­out the semester. 
A collection during the Michigan State football game Saturday raised $197,871, the release said. 
Student government was responsible for coordinating student volunteers for the collection, student body president Dave Baron said. 
"With a collection taken three weeks after the event, the Notre Dame family was able to come together to dis­play what we're capable of in terms Qf helping those in need," Baron said. 
Student government also coordinated all student groups, clubs, and residence halls and worked to help the d iffe rent groups find resources to facilitate their own aid efforts, Baron said. 
Sister Susan Dunn, rector of Lyons Hall, said sopho­more Veronica Owens approached her after the hurricane hit about wanting to do something to help vic­tims. Dunn said that the Hall Presidents Council had expressed interest in organ­izing fundraising events, aside from collections at dorm Masses. In response, Owens coordinated seven women of Lyons Hall to col­lect donations in all of the residence halls. 
Sophomore Erin James was enthusiastic about helping the relief effort when Owens approached her about going door-to-door on Sept. 2. 
"I wanted to go door to door because it's the least I can do for people who need help so far away," James said, who requested dona­tions from every room in Welsh Family and Keough Halls. 
The money collected from the door-to-door campaign totaled $4,391.02, all of which went into the general fund collected by the University. 
"I think everybody at Notre Dame wants to do the right thing, but it's the hard with these kinds of cataclysmic events," University President Emeritus Father Edward Malloy said. "It's easy to throw money at it. but if 
you're going to be generous, which we ought to be, you have to figure out the shrewdest way." 
Funds raised by the University are being distrib­uted among Catholic Charities USA. The charities include Holy Cross parishes in the Gulf region and regional parochial schools participating in Notre Dame's Alliance for Catholic Education volunteer teaching program. 
"There are a lot of charla­tans out there and there's ways the money can be focused in the right direc­tion," Malloy said. "[Distributing the money among several groups] seems like a very good thing to do." 
Malloy, who was University president during the Sept. 11 tragedy, recognized the char­itable nature of the student body and expects the fundraising efforts to contin­ue. 
"I think the University's always been a very generous place when it comes to doing our part, so I know that will continue.," he said.

"It's a very special and meaningful event for the University, and I would like to be a part of it," said junior John Coyle. 
Coyle signed up to volunteer at the inauguration and also plans on attending both the academic forum and the inau­gural ball. 
"It's such a rare event that I want to go see it," said junior Vanessa Valenzuela. "Think about how many students go through here and never get to see anything like this." 
However. with classes can­celled Thursday and Friday afternoons, some students plan to go out of' town or relax instead of going to the events.

Although he said it's never been his "lifelong dream" to be in a reality show, Kelly was very interested in the opportu­nity and sent in the required online application and video. 
"It's a different type of reality show," Kelly said. "It's not TV, where they make up situations for you. I was really thrilled about the opportunity. Basically, I get paid to do everything I was going to do here." 
Kelly receives $200 a week for 16 weeks to shoot about an hour and a half of footage based on a list of topics given to him by his producer. 
"I talk to my producer about what's going on here for me, and then whatever we've talked about, he types up a list," said Kelly, who was asked last weekend to get footage of himself getting ready for the football game, then cheering and doing pushups. He said he is often asked for sound bytes and study footage. 
"What it really entails is for me to talk to the camera," Kelly said. "That's the crux of it for us." 
Although the program's press release describes Project Freshman as "the Heal World meets Laguna Beach," Kelly isn't given the carte blanche that members of those shows seem to enjoy. He had to sign a contract with AOL RED before he was accepted for the proj­ect. 
The contract's restrictions are extensive and designed to make sure content is appropri­ate for AOL RED's five million teen members. Kelly is not allowed to tape illegal activity, sexual situations or strong expletives, for example. Any references to entertainment must be suitable for teens ages 13 to 15, the contract read, which means no R-rated movies or music with a Parental Advisory Warning. 

When it comes to profanity, Kelly has a little leeway. The contract distinguishes between usages of expletives and gives specific examples. Acceptable usages of moderate expletives are "My school has a kick-ass hockey team" and "That test was a bitch." Unacceptable usages are "She has a great ass" and "Get over here, bitch." 
The University has general media guidelines Kelly must follow, such as asking rectors permission before filming inside their respective dorms and not filming in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart without prior consent. 
Kelly said he found it some­what difficult at first to find students willing to be part of his filming. 
"The first time, I made a sign that said, 'Freshmen, if you want to be a star, come talk to me,"' Kelly said. "People were like, 'Here's this creepy guy with a camera. That's super."' 
But he refined his techniques to something a little less "sketchtastic." His second sign read, ''I'm working for AOL doing a documentary and I need to interview freshmen. Please help me." 
He still gets a lot of questions about the project. Usually, Kelly said, "the response is divided 50-50." 
"People either think it's the coolest thing in the world and want to be a part of it ... Others say, 'Why would you ever do that? Don't put me on this thing,"' he said. 
The freshman most affected 
by Kelly's filming is probably his roommate in Morrissey, Phil Kirchner. But he doesn't mind. 
"He told me about it before [school started]," Kirchner said. "It didn't seem like I had to do much ... He's not over­bearing with it or anything. It's not him sneaking up on me with a camera." 
Kirchner said his parents were more "hesitant" about Project Freshman than he was. 
"But it's really not that big a deal to me, honestly," he said. 
Assistant director for News and Information Shannon Chapla said getting Notre Dame's involvement was a high priority for production compa­ny 2C Media, which pitched the project to the University early last summer. 
"They really wanted Notre Dame in the mix," Chapla said. 
So much that Notre Dame was allowed to give 2C Media input on choosing the other schools involved in the show, to help the University feel "com­fortable" with the project, Chapla said. 
"We didn't make recommen­dations," Chapla said. "There was a pool, a large group Of colleges ... We said, 'Here are some of the ones we wanted to be in the mix.'" 
The other five participating schools are Dallas Baptist University, the University of Wisconsin, the University of Missouri-Columbia, Marshall University and the University of Florida-Gainesville. 
Chapla said the University saw the project "as something nobody had ever dune before." 
"This is a brand new ven­ture," she said. "We kind of looked at it like we were taking a chance ... but a good oppor­tunity, because in the coming years, you're probably going to see a lot more of this." 
Notre Dame's involvement in Project Freshman was approved by the Office of News and Information and vice presi­dent of Public Affairs Hilary Crkovich "[University President Father John] Jenkins personally signed off on it," Chapla said -then went to the University General Counsel, which drafted a contract with AOL and 2C Media. 
"I think it will look very good for the University, because Conor's a good kid. He lives and breathes Notre Dame," Chapla said. "But we're not doing this for publicity at all." 
Mundy said he thought the show would "have a positive impact" on admissions. 
"The First Year experience at Notre Dame is almost always exceptionally positive for rea­sons that resonate with our prospective students and their families," Mundy said. "We think that this could be a won­derful way to share the 'initia­tion' into the ND family." 
Chapla said the first install­ment of Project Freshman will be available to AOL subscribers Friday.

INTERNATIONAL NEWS 
German elections cause uncertainty 
BERLIN -Conservative challenger 
Angela Merkel won overwhelming backing 
from her party Tuesday ahead of talks with 
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social 
Democrats about a coalition government. 
Schroeder, apparently showing new flexi­
bility, said all sides should drop "precondi­
tions." 
German voters ousted Schroeder's gov­
ernment Sunday but didn't give Merkel a 
parliamentary majority, leaving Europe's 
largest economy -beset by high unem­
ployment, sluggish growth and budget 
deficits-rudderless. 
Both Schroeder and Merkel claim a man­
date to be the next chancellor, a dispute to 
be settled in coalition talks beginning 
Thursday among Germany's political par­
ties. But the outcome is far from clear: one 
could win, or both could conceivably be 
overlooked by their own parties. 
Gaza withdrawal reduces tension 
UNITED NATIONS -Mideast peace bro­
kers said Tuesday that Israeli Prime Minister 
Ariel Sharon demonstrated political courage 
in ending the Israeli occupation of the Gaza 
Strip and eased pressure on both sides as 
Israel and the Palestinians adjust to changed 
political circumstances. 
The peacemaking group known as the 
quartet made no specific new demands on 
Israel to capitalize on momentum from the 
Gaza withdrawal, and avoided harsh public 
assessments of Palestinian security measures 
in the volatile territory they now control. 
NATIONAL NEWS 
Bush denies North Korea demand 
WASHINGTON -The Bush administration 
on Tuesday dismissed North Korea's demand 
for civilian nuclear reactors and appeared 
confident about a final agreement to end that 
nation's nuclear weapons program. 
Still, the United States and South Korea fore­see difficulties. 
The next round of negotiations is planned for early November. In the interim, informal discussions among the six negotiating nations -the United States, North Korea, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia-are expect­ed. 
"We are going to get this done," U.S. nego­tiator Christopher Hill told The Associated Press in an interview. 
Reid: I will vote to reject Roberts 
WASHINGTON -· Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said Tuesday he would oppose con­firmation of Chief Justice-nominee John Roberts, questioning Hoberts' commitment to civil rights and accusing the Bush administra­tion· of stonewalling requests for documents that might shed light on his views. 
At the same time, Reid readily predicted Roberts will win Senate confirmation, coupling ' the forecast with a warning of sorts to President Bush as he considers candidates for a second vacancy on the Supreme Court. "No one should think that just automatically they're all going to be easy like this one," he said. 
Reid is one of four senators invited to a White House meeting with Bush on Wednesday to discuss the vacancy created by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's decision to retire. 
LOCAL NEWS West Nile virus affects nine Hoosiers 
CROWN POINT-Nine Indiana residents have tested positive lor the West Nile virus so far this year in a recent surge health officials say demonstrates that Hoosiers need to remain vigi­lant in avoiding mosquitoes even as cooler fall weather arrives. 
State officials announced Monday that five human cases of West Nile have been diagnosed in Lake County and two in Porter County, boost­ing the state's total to nine. 
Although colder weather is approaching, the mosquitoes that spread the disease will be around until the first hard frost, health officials said. 
IRAN 





Nation gives U.N. ultimatum 
Country warns ofresuming uranium enrichment ifbrought before Security Council 
Associated Press 
TEIIHAN -Iran on 
Tuesday threatened to 
resume uranium enrichment 

and bar open inspections of 
its nuclear facilities if an 
ongoing meeting of the U.N. 
nuclear watchdog decides to 
refer it to the Security 
Council for possible sanc­
tions. 
However, Iran's top 
nuclear negotiator, Ali 
Larijani, offered Europe a 
new round of talks, saying 
the world should give 
Tehran's new government a 
chance to reach a political 
understanding. 
At the International 
Atomic Energy Agency 
board meeting in Vienna, 
European negotiators pre­
pared a draft resolution that 
would refer Iran to the 
Security Council for alleged 
"failures and breaches of its 
obligations to comply" with 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. 
But Russia's opposition could delay the vote until a later meeting of the 35­member board, diplomats in Vienna said. 
Larijani criticized the dis­cussion in Vienna, saying nuclear technology has become a matter of national pride and that the Iranian government would not com­promise over its right to enrich uranium. 
"If they want to speak with Iran with the language of force, Iran will have no choice, in order to preserve its technological achieve­ments, to get out of the framework of the NPT and the additional protocol and resume (uranium I enrich­ment," Larijani told a news conference. 
I .arijani did not appear to be calling for Iran to pull out of the treaty completely but rather to suspend the proto­col that allows unfettered, short-notice inspections of nuclear facilities. 
He warned that Iran's response w(mld be the same if the IAEA tried to impose deadlines. 


..If they set a deadline, it will, from Iran's point of view, make no difference from being referred to the 
U.N. Security Council and Iran will react in the same manner," Larijani said. 
Britain, Germany and France, negotiating on behalf of the European Union, have drafted a reso­lution demanding Iran be referred to the couneil. But Europeans face opposition from other members of the IAEA board of governors, which started meeting Monday to discuss Iran's nuclear program. 
The IAEA has been trying to determine if gaps in Iranian reporting on more than 18 years of clandestine nuclear activity are attempL'> to hide military involvement in what Iran insists is a purely civilian program to generate electricity. Establishing such involve­ment would bolster argu­ments by Washington and iL'> allies that Iran's program is a cover for making nuclear arms. 
Board members China and Russia -both Security Cnundl members with veto power -oppose hauling Iran before the U.N.'s top decision-making body. But diplomats say the Russians could change their mind, which is the rationu.le for possibly delaying a vote. 
Secretary of State Condoleezza Hice also hinted that, while referral was a near certainty, when that might happen was undecid­ed. 
''I'm quite certain that at some point in time Iran is going to be referred to the Security Council, particularly if Iran continues to demon­strate that it is not prepared to give the international community assurances that it is not going to try to build a nuclear weapons program under cover of civil nuclear power," she told reporters Monday at the United Nations. 
Larijani urged the European troika to get back to the negotiating table. 
"We are telling the three European countries that we are ready for talks but with­in the framework of the NPT," he said. 

Rita hits Florida, heads for Mexico 
Alisociated Press 

KEY WEST -Rapidly strengthen­ing Hurricane Hita lashed the Florida Keys on Tuesday and headed into the Gulf of Mexico, where fore­casters feared it could develop into another blockbuster storm targeting Texas or Louisiana. 
Thousands of people were evacu­ated from the Keys and low-lying areas of northern Cuba. On the far side of the Gulf of Mexico in Texas, Galveston started evacuations and officials made plans to move refugees from Ilurrieane Katrina who had been housed in the Houston area to Arkansas. 
Forecasters said Rita could inten­sify in the Gulf of Mexico into a Category 4 storm with winds of at least 131 mph. The most likely desti­nation by week's end was Texas, although Louisiana and northern Mexico were possibilities, according to the hurricane center. 
Acting FEMA Director R. David Paulison told reporters that the agency has aircraft and buses avail­able to evacuate residents of areas the hurricane might hit. Rescue teams and truckloads of ice, water and prepared meals were being sent to Texas and Florida. "I strongly urge Gulf coast residents to pay attention" to the storm. he said. 
Stung by criticism of the govern­ment's slow initial response to Hurricane Katrina, President Bush signed an emergency declaration for Florida and spoke with Texas Gov. Hick Perry about planning for the storm's landfall. 
"All up and down the coastline people are now preparing for what is anticipated to be another signifi­cant storm," Bush said. 
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said more than 2,000 Florida National Guard troops and dozens of law enforce­ment officers were ready to deal with the storm's aftermath, although it appeared the Keys were spared the storm's full fury.

IN BRIEF 
U.S. Steel to miss earnings estimates 
PITTSBUHGII -U.S. Steel's third-quarter earnings won't meet analysts' expectations because of rising natural gas and scrap prices, the company said Tuesday. 
"Significant declines in income for the flat­rolled and U.S. Steel Europe segments, com­pared to second quarter results, will be reported in late October," the company said in a release Tuesday. 
Analysts polled by Thomson Finandal were forecasting third-quarter earnings of $1.44 per share. 
The company had earnings of $245 million in the second quarter, or $1.88 per share, and reported earnings of $354 million, or $2.72 per share, in the third quarter of 2004. 
U.S. Steel shares were trading at $43.69, down $1.56, Tuesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading of U.S. Steel shares were delayed until the earnings out­look was announced. 
The company also announced Tuesday that a blast furnace in Gary, Ind., which was idled in May, will start up again in December -a month behind schedule -and won't reach its capacity of 9,200 tons per days until January. The furnace is being rebuilt, but that process was delayed by an accident at the mill earlier this month. 
Publisher pleads guilty to mail fraud 
CHICAGO-Former Chicago Sun-Times pub­lisher David Radler pleaded guilty Tuesday to taking part in a scheme to siphon away $32 mil­lion from Hollinger International Inc., the news­paper's parent company, for himself and others. 
Radler, who resigned in 2003, entered his guilty plea to one count of mail fraud in federal court in Chicago. He is cooperating with prosecutors who have said the investigation is ongoing. Radler remains free on bond. 
··This is the first step in making amends for what has taken place," Radler's attorney Anton Valukas said after court. 
Radler was indicted Aug. 18 along with a for­mer executive of the company that owns the Sun-Times and Toronto-based RaveL'iton Corp., a private company owned until this spring by Conrad Black, on five counts each of mail fraud and two counts of wire fraud.

U.S. Senate maintains beef ban 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON -Angry with Japan for refusing to lift a mad cow-related ban on U.S. beef, senators retaliated Tuesday by voting to retain a ban on Japanese beef. 
Once the biggest customer of American beef, importing more than $1.5 billion's worth in 2003, Japan has refused to allow the purchase of U.S. beef since the nation's first case of mad cow disease was confirmed in Washington state almost two years ago. Last fall, Japan agreed to lift the ban but still hasn't done so. 
In June, U.S. authorities con­firmed a second domestic case in a Texas-born cow. Japan, in contrast, has found 20 cases of mad cow disease. U.S. regula­tors proposed last month to 
partially  lift  the  ban  on  
Japanese beef.  
Japan's  stalling  is  "just  

unfair," said Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb. 
"There have been two cases of mad cow disease in the United States, one from Canada," Nelson said in a Senate speech. "Statistically, it's nonexistent, in terms of the mil­lions of head of cattle that are sent to slaughter every year." 
Senators adopted, on a 72-26 vote, an amendment by Nelson prohibiting importation of Japanese beef until Japan lifts its ban. They adopted a similar, nonbinding measure by Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., on a voice vote. 
Opponents of the amendment said trade decisions about food safety should be based on sci­ence, not on restrictions in Japan or other countries. 
"And when we expect trading partners to respect science, we should be willing to do the same," said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. "So I don't support depriving the Department of Agriculture with the funding it needs to make decisions based on sound sci­ence even while we need to send a loud and clear message to Japan." 
Japan's food safety panel issued a draft. report last week saying U.S. cows faced higher risk of exposure to mad cow disease than Japanese cows because of insufficient feed con­trols in the 1980s and 1990s, according to Kyodo News agency. 
Ground-up cattle remains ­leftovers from slaughtering operations -were used as pro­tein in cattle feed until 1997, when a mad cow outbreak in Britain prompted the U.S. to ban the feed industry from using cattle remains in cattle feed. 
The U.S. bans beef from all countries with confirmed cases of mad cow disease, including Japan. The exception is Canada, which resumed limited beef shipments in 2003 and live cattle shipments earlier this year. , 
Mad cow disease is also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE. Eating infected beef is believed to cause variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a fatal brain disorder that has killed more than 150 people, mostly in Britain in the 1990s. 

Rodriguez to appear at inauguration 
Priest abuse survivors group opposed to Honduras priest's in-volvement in Notre Da1ne forum

Cardinal Oscar Andres Rodriguez Maradiaga, the arch­bishop of Tegucigalpa, Honduras, will speak at the Notre Dame Forum, which has been started by University President Father John Jenkins as part of his inauguration as the university's 17th president.

"He's made such hurtful and misguided comments about the crisis," Clohessy said. "He's had ample opportunity to correct them, and hasn't." 
Clohessy and Appleby were two of the four speakers invited to address the U.S. bishops on the scandal during a historic 2002 meeting in Dallas.

Three political ;no-brainers 
Although it is not a flaw unique to the U.S. political system, if you hap­pen to turn on C-SPAN for any length of time it is difficult to shake the feel­ing that replacing the House and Senate with a group of randomly select­ed junior high teachers, armed only with the man­date to govern by common sense, is anything but a good idea. They, at least, would understand the principle of compromise and have a grasp of our nation's priorities, rather than govern­ing by calculated dogma as both parties do today. 
In this spirit, I have outlined three "no-brainer" solutions to a set of con­temporary political problems that exemplify the degree to which com­mon sense is absent from politics. Sadly, you are nut likely to see any of these actions taken in the near future, possibly for no other reason than that they make too much sense. 
Strip state legislatures of the power to draw electoral districts. 
State legislatures, because they receive little media scrutiny and also because, frankly, voters rarely care what their states are doing, are sig­nificantly more partisan than Congress, and the parties exploit this lack of oversight to their political advantage. The usc of statistical com­puter analysis on Census data and voting records has modf~rnized the art of gerrymandering (originally con­ceived to disenfranchise black voters), allowing a party in control to draw electoral districts with a preeision that almost ensures that party's suc­cess. The effects of this cheating on the incumbency rate of the current Congress have already been dramatic. 
In retrospect, the idea of permitting partisan state legislatures -with a vested interest in the outcome of elec­tions -to draw districts is critically

Divide up NASA. 
I do not pretend to be one of those shortsighted people who claim that all space exploration is a waste of time and money. However, it is quite plain that NASA, in its present form, has reached the end of its useful life, and needs to be radically re-envisioned. 
Government funded space explo­ration exists, ostensibly, because it is beyond the economic reach of any other group, and because of legiti­mate defense interests. However, in the past decade, development of pri­vate, commercial low-earth space flight has flourished, with several major players and private investors willing to gamble on space travel. At the same time, mismanagement of the Shuttle, and the high-cost low-gain International Space Station (ISS) have shown that NASA's current approach to space is broken. 
The scientific and defense commu­nities, as well as taxpayers, would be better served if NASA were split into several focused organizations, placing deep space exploration and smaller projects under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Aministration, the Defense Department or in universitins through the National SciBnce F<wndation; creating a funding pro­gram to promote commercial space flight; and using money now given to the Shuttle program and the ISS to fund a leaner organization focused exclusively on long-term lunar or Martian exploration.

Given the disproportionate concen­tration of executions in a handful of states, it is plain that standards of prosecution and warrant for capital crimes arc not uniform, nor do all states give equal financial resources and legal oversight to capital cases. Different states have different mind­sets, standards and goals in their management and implementation of the death penalty. 
It is patently ridiculous, and mocks any reasonable definition of equal protection, that the local biases of a particular community should be of significance in determining whether a person lives or dies. Likewise it is unjust that vastly different resources and legal protections are allocated to equivalent cases in accordance with local whim. Reserving the death penalty exclusively to the federal gov­ernment would ensure uniform stan­dards, make available the highest level of judicial oversight, raise all death penalty cases to national scruti­ny and ensure that adequate financial resources are available for each case. 
This only scratches the surface as far as political "no-brainers" are con­cerned. Space does not permit me to discuss creating uniform national pri­vacy legislation, granting Hawaiian natives the same legal status as American Indians, banning prescrip­tion drug advertisements, renaming Columbus day, reforming the patent system, standards for electronic vot­ing machines or any of the other obvi­ous and necessar~:csolutionsj.o con­temporary issues that are currently sitting in limbo. 
All I can say is that it is a pity that our leaders lack the common sense to see them.

Education vs. politics 
It's nice to see Democrats finally quieting down now that they've been forced to accept the fact that nothing in the country will improve for at least three more years. 
Sure they've got the Katrina debacle to moan about with the sane and helpful Jesse Jackson shouting about Eric racist hurricanes and one more Strand chance to gripe about the

The Daily 
been pretty obvious that no one is

paying much attention. Instead the focus is on the GOP. 
It should be no secret that the Republicans seek a monopoly. They are very open about it, now in con­trol of all three branches of the federal government and representing a majority of state governments. They also dominatf1 mainstream news outlets and are now dead set on taking down public radio, which has been accused of becoming a left-wing institution aligned with the liberal agenda. You'd think this would be good enough, but we all know that when it comes to Republicans enough is never enough. 
So it should br a surprise to no one that the GOP is now poising itself to take on the last major insti­tution in the country still explicitly swinging to the left: The university. 
Whether you're willing to admit it or not, the realm of academics does seem to invite a liberal agenda. 
In some conservative eyes this is seen as a major problem. According to Harper's Magazine, "National conservative groups now spend 35,-mil­lion dollars each year on student groups dedicated 
to fighting their campuses' leftward tilt." 
(I'd like to pause here before launching into the issues and say that I am of the opinion that claim­ing to be solely a Republican or a Democrat is truly a confused way to go through life. I understand possessing tendencies, but know that at any moment a sudden complication in your life could force you to act or think in ways that contradict everything you thought you believed in.) The debate between education and politics begins rightfully in a place of duty. asking the question: What is the main function of the university? 
Easy answer: education. 
But this is perhaps too easy because in the age we are surviving in, texts and materials exist in an overwhelming abundance, leading to the question: Well, what should education consist or? In a politi­cal science class of 250 students, should the con­centration be affirmative action policies or border regulations? Foreign p()Jicy in the Third World or the economy as a reflp,ction of tax relief'? Most of the time these derisions are left up to the professor. 
This bothers some Republicans who know better than anyone that the general public is an easy bunch to persuade. They argue that allowing a biased, subjective professor to control Classroom material and in many circumstances, ideology, is a mistake. Instead, opponents say that a university supported by public tax dollars should speak for the public as a rule, meaning that the educational research produced by a particular institution should reflect the ideas and opinions of the popula­tion as a whole. 
Aside from being impossible, this is also politiciz­ing education. Once the main objective of the uni­versity becomes political correctness, the focus can 
no longer be truly on education -the analytical and responsible seeking of truth and knowledge from textual materials, both academic and social. This should be the objective. And as long as this is the objective, subjective bias should never be the reason one view prevails over another. 
But a problem emerges when professors usc their classroom as a platform for their political opinions. This is not to say that individual thought is damag­ing to students (indeed. we are half the problem), but students are often very quick to accept a pro­fessor's ideas as their own. Too often students look to professors for "correct answers" to questions which have no correct answers. What usually ensues then is a pathetic regurgitation of the pro­fessor's ideas. 
This is exactly what the GOP is worried about. If our universities keep churning out liberal conspira­cy theorists lapping at their hardened, Democratic professors' ideologies. who'll ensure the Republican stronghold on the country? What should be done? 
Affirmative action is not the answer. It never was the answer. Instead. students, the most vital demo­graphic in this debate who were curiously left out, must take on the responsibility. Liberal or conser­vative, Democrat or Republican, students must learn to be able to hear all sides and decide for themselves what they think, even if it means choos­ing neither. This is education.

Thanks for Katrina help 
On behalf of the Alliance for Catholic Education, especially those ACE teachers who serve in the Gulf Coast area. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the entire Notre Dame community for your gtmerous outpouring of donations and prayers over the past few weeks. Hurricane Katrina devastated the Mississippi coastline where seven ACE teachers work. and daunting challenges face their schools as they clean up and. in some cases, rebuild. Neighboring dio­ceses have taken into their schools thousands of displaced students, as the entire region seeks to respond to this crisis. Your generous contributions and solidarity mean more than you may know to all of us associated with ACE. 
Special thanks to Student Activities and to all the volunteers who helped to collect and count money during Saturday's game. Your efforts helped to raise almost $200,000 for hurricane relief, one quarter of which has been directed to ACE to distribute to desperately needy Catholic schools in the Biloxi area. Many thanks also to Father Warner and Campus Ministry, who allocated one-half of the campus offertory collection two weeks ago for ACE to distribute to the schools it serves. These funds are being augmented daily by contributions from 
ACE graduates and others to our hurricane relief effort, donations that already total over $30,000. 
We pledge to work dosely with local leaders to dired these gifts to the schools with greatest need. Above all, parents along the Gulf Coast want their schools to reopen as soon as possible to bring comfort and stability to their children's lives, and your gifts and efforts will help many achieve this goal. The entire Notre Dame community can take pride in our ACE teachers-their dedication to their students and schools brings hope to a community that has. from the program's inception 12 years ago, welcomed and supported our teachers with incredible hospitality. Our love and prayers are with them in the difficult times ahead.

coss.,..,,_ . ..... 
The answer is really quite simple: "Lost" is the modern master of suspense. Creators have found a way to generate sus­pense that rivals or at least emulates the style of Alfred Hitchcock and leaves viewers craving more and more. 
"Lost" began as a show entitled "Castaway: The Series" and was sup­posed to be about the survivors of a plane crash on a deserted island. 
This eopy of the almost dead "Survivor" series was modified when 
J.J. Abrams ("Alias," the upcoming "Mission Impossible 3") and Damon Lindelof ("Crossing Jordan") were brought in to fix the story and script. 
These two came up with the idea of a mysterious island and subplots for each character that are related to the 
·story of the island. Abrams and 
Lindelof chose to combine theatrical production values with top notch tele­vision writing in their show, and this decision paid off. 
Each episode of "Lost" focuses on one character using flashbacks. Viewers find out that every character had a very specific reason for being on the exact flight that crashed in the Pacific. 
Often, the characters' paths crossed in the real world without their knowl­edge. Details like this keep the audi­ence intrigued to learn more about each character. 
Usually, when a momentous event is about to occur for one character, the scene will change and focus on the 
problem of some 
other character.
Lost 
The suspense 
utes to a few 
episodes, creat­
ing real nail-biters for avid fans. 
The team working on "Lost" treads a fine line between too little and too much suspense. 
If there were not enough suspense in any given episode, it could feel like "Castaway: The Series" would have been. Too much suspense without any resolution would turn viewers away because the show would seem like one giant tease. 
One factor that helps the show tread this line is the large number of writ­ers involved. Every one of the writers, each with his own distinct flair, turns out exceptional work. 
The crew of "Lost" combines this writing with strong performances from the talented and attractive cast to create engaging, thrilling episodes

week in and week out. 
It is the characters that keep the show original and sustain it through an entire season. 
Most viewers find themselves emo­tionally attached to one character or another and are thus anxious to find out what will happen to him or her in each episode. 
All of the characters have flaws and sins no different from normal people, which viewers discover through the flashbacks. 
Knowing that these imperfections will not be fixed in the real world pro­vides a desire to discover how each character deals with their problems in the new society on this island. 
Close viewing will reveal that the camera never moves in flashbacks, whereas it moves freely on the island. This is meant to show a greater sense of freedom from past wrongdoings in the real world. 
Some critics have suggested that the mystery of the island is perhaps a manifestation of the sins and prob­lems of each character, and that when every character conquers these per­sonal obstacles, the mysteries will be solve(! and the show will end. 
Hegardless of the true purpose behind all the mystery and suspense on the show, one thing is certain: peo­ple are going to continue watching "Lost." 
The entire team from the first sea­son, which recently won the Emmy for Best Drama, returned to film the second season. Fans can rest assured that the writing, acting and produc­tion values of the show in general will continue along the same themes as last year. 
Those with tender nerves beware: several more months of spine-tingling suspense await.

Fall fillll lllagic 
From a new world to a different universe, four films to watch for this year 


Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (Tim Burton, Sept. 23) 
Its wide-release just around the cor­ner. Tim Burton's second film of the year is also his second collaboration of the year with Johnny Depp and his second foray into stop-motion animation. 
"The Nightmare Before Christmas" (1993) was directed by Henry Selick, but the fingerprints of writer/producer Burton are all over the final product. Burton. along with Mike Johnson, helms this film, which is probably a good thing. 
Longtime musical collaborator Danny Elfman is once again onboard -defi­nitely a plus, as Elfman's songs were one of the best aspects of "The Nightmare Before Christmas" and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." 
Early buzz on "The Corpse Bride" is positive, as it looks to replicate the suc­cess of "The Nightmare Before Christmas." Unlike "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," which was average at best, "Tim Burton's The Corpse Bride" looks to have more personality, though it should be equally stylized. 
Hopefully, it has the elements of the best of Burton's films: a little bit charm­ing, a little bit creepy, a little bit brilliant. 
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Mike Newell, Nov. 18) 
Another Harry Potter film, another director. The hiring of Mike Newell as director seems like a retreat on the part
,· of Warner Bros. after the mixed reaction to the artsier, more cinematic tendencies of Alfonso Cuaron. Newell is a questionable fit for the lat­est entry in the series. as "Harry Potter 
S T 0 R Y B y B R 
and the Goblet of Fire" is darker and more sinister than its predecessors, and the director's previous credits include "Enchanted April," "Four Weddings and a Funeral" and "Mona Lisa Smile." 
Nearly all of the key actors are return­ing, including Danielle Radcliff as Harry Potter himself. Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort should be brilliant, as the mere mention of the name and the role evoke shuddering memories of the Nazi Goeth from "Schindler's List." 
The film follows Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts (the school for wizards) and his participation in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. The book marks the turn­ing point in the series, so the film should follow suit and serve the same function. 
Steve Kloves once again returns as screenwriter, though this is allegedly his last Harry Potter film. By now, Kloves should have a good feel for how to write a Harry Potter film, and since the previ­ous three got steadily better, it is likely "The Goblet of Fire" will be a greater improvement still. 
Yet Kloves and Newell definitely had their work cut out for them, compressing 734 pages into a mere 150 minutes. 
It remains to be seen whether or not "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" will be a great film, but Howling's book series is so well-written and popular that it's impossible to think the film transla­tion will be a complete failure. 
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe (Andrew Adamson, Dec. 9) 
"The Chronicles of Narnia" is setting itself up to be "The Lord of the Rings" 
I A N DOXTADER 
for families. Based on C.S. Lewis' peren­nial book series, Andrew Adamson ("Shrek") looks to bring a strong directo­rial sense to his first live-action film. 
The former visual effects supervisor balances a young, inexperienced cast with seasoned support (Liam Neeson and Tilda Swinton), which should keep the film afloat. 
The film follows a group of children who crawl through a wardrobe into an alternate world, which pits the evil White Witch (Swinton} against the hero­ically mythical lion Asian (voice of Liam Neeson). As it is the first in the series, it sets up much of the action that occurs in later episodes. 
The big-budget fantasy film kick-starts the "Chronicles of Narnia" franchise, which means several more films in the same vein should be forthcoming. 
Like "The Lord of the Rings," "The Chronicles of Narnia" was shot mostly in New Zealand, but whether or not it can replicate that series' staggering world­wide success is another question. 
Will "The Chronicles of Narnia" res­onate as mythically as "The Lord of the Rings" or "Star Wars?" It's difficult to say for certain, but opening against "Harry Potter" should be a good litmus test for the success of the series. While the film will undoubtedly look good, its ability to make the story seem grand rather than silly remains to be seen. 
The New World (Terrence Mallek, Dec. 25) 
Any new material from reclusive auteur Terrence Malick is a cause for celebration. as "The New World," his first film in seven years, marks only the writer/director's fourth film since 1973. For those counting, that's less than a film a decade over the course of 32 years. Alfred Hitchcock, by comparison, made 48 films in the same span of time (between 1927 and 1959). 
While Malick's reputation rests largely on the strength of his first two films, 1973's "Badlands" and 1978's "Days of Heaven" (perhaps the most beautiful film ever shot);his skills as a visual poet remain peerless. He looks to bring that vision to "The New World." 
Even "The Thin Red Line," which was inconsistent and unfocused, had moments of genius scattered throughout. 
"The New World" follows John Smith (Colin Farrell) and his settlers as they land in America. Similarities to Disney's "Pocahontas" abound, but Malick seems to approach his material with serious­ness and reverence -a good decision, as the film avoids the treacly pitfalls of its animated predecessor. 
Apprehension about Colin Farrell in the lead role may prove unfounded. though the actor's previous foray into the winter season (Oliver Stone's abysmal "Alexander") demonstrated that he has difficulty carrying a film. 
Hopefully, Malick's skills as a writer and director will overcome any short­comings. 
At the very least, audiences can expect more visual beauty from one of the most aesthetically competent directors of all time.

Woods searches for a President's Cup partner 
World's No. 1 player hopes to finally find a compatible teammate 
Associated Press 
GAINESVILLE, Va. -Tiger Woods has been paired with some of his best friends. 
He also has been paired with Phil Mickelson. 
In the seven Hyder Cup and Presidents Cup matches Woods has played since 1997, the U.S. captains have had no trouble finding him a partner for better­ball and alternate-shot matches. 
Finding one who fits is anoth­er matter. 
"Everybody wants to play with him," Davis Love III said Tuesday, searching for a reason why Woods already has had 14 partners in 2 8 matches. "Everybody gets their turn." 
Fn;d Couples likely will get another turn at the Presidents Cup, which starts Thursday at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club. Woods and Couples played twice at Royal Melbourne in 1998 and were 1-1 as a team. The loss came on the 18th hole when Craig Parry chipped in from 50 feet. 
What makes for a good part­ner? 
"Being comfortable is the best thing about it," Couples said. "Everyone thinks they can play with everybody, and they all get along great. But when you're on the course, you have to know the guy pretty well because you're not going to win every single time you play, and you have to be able to say the right things and have some fun." 
Woods is supremely eomfort­able with Mark O'Meara, his best friend on tour. That didn't help them in 1997 at Valderrama -Woods' first Ryder Cup -when they went 1­2. 
Two other close friends are Notah Begay and Charles Howell III. Those are the only players with whom Woods was paired for all four team matches at the Presidents Cup -Begay in 2000 at RTJ, Howell in South Africa in 2003. Both times, their record was 2-2. 
The uncomfort­able side is 
times in the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup; Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson, who never lost a match. 
The search for a stable part­ner for Woods continues, and the record reflects futility. Woods has lost only one singles match in seven cups, yet his team record is a paltry 10-17-1. He has a winning record with only two players-Love (2-1) and Chris Riley, who won his only match with Woods last year at 
the Hyder Cup. 
"/ think it would be

Tiger Woods 
at Oakland Hills. Woods guessed it "I felt like histo­golfer was 16. 
ry needed it. I felt like the fans need­ed it. And most of all, I felt like Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods needed it," Sutton said. 
It proved to be a disaster. The best two Americans rarely spoke to each other in losing both matches. The lasting image was Woods trying to keep a straight face when Mickelson nearly hit 3-wood out-of-bounds on the final hole of alternate shot with their match all square against Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood. 
Woods also played with David Duval in 1999 when they were Nos. 1 and 2 in the world, an act of desperation by Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw. They lost on the 18th hole to Clarke and Westwood. 
There have been partnerships over the years that have been tough to beat -Steve Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal; Love and Couples, who have played together 10 

MSPS 
Asked for a rea­son why so many, he went blank. 
"I have no idea," he said. "''ve had some great times with my partners, trying to out there and win points. Unfortunately, I haven't \\On as many points as I'd like." 
His ideal partner? 
"A guy that makes a lot of birdies," Woods said. "If my partner makes a bunch of 
birdies, we're going to have  a  
great time."  
Even that might not make  a  

difference. Woods still recalls the time he and Paul Azinger shot 9-under 63 in a better-ball match at The Belfry and still lost to Clarke and Thomas

Even more staggering is his 0­6 record in better-ball matches at the Presidents Cup. 
"In better ball?" Couples said. "That's best ball? That's when you use his seven or eight birdies every round? That's pretty surprising. But again, I've watched a lot of it, and I think he's ready to change all that." 
To get an idea how many part­ners Woods has gone through, consider two other perennial cup players. · 
Love has played in every Hyder Cup and Presidents Cup since 1993 -11 events -and has had 13 partners. Mickelson has played in 10 cups dating to 1994, and he's had only 11 part­ners. 
Love played the majority of his matches with Couples. Mickelson has played at least five times with three players ­Tom Lehman, David Toms and Duval. 
"I think it would be cool to play with the same guy," Woods said. 

Maybe that would have hap­pened if a partnership paid off earlier in his cup career. After going 1-2 in the '97 Ryder Cup, Woods and O'Meara never played together in the next two cups. 
Woods and Love went 2-0 at The Belfry, but their latest part­nership ended in a 4-and-3 loss at Oakland I fills. 
Make yourself U.S. captain for the day. Who does Woods get as a partner? 
"Phil. They did good together," said Adam Scott of the International team, as the room broke into laughter. 
Stuart Appleby had another solution to finding Woods a partner. 
He was told only four Americans on this Presidents Cup team have ever played with Woods in cup competition ­Love, Couples, Mickelson and Leonard. 
"All the rest of them, I guess," Appleby said.

The Sugar Bowl will be played in either Baton Rouge, La., or Atlanta after being forced out of the Superdome in New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina. 
Sugar Bowl officials said Tuesday they will know in about three weeks whether Louisiana has recovered sufficiently to keep the game in the state where it has been played every year since it was established in 1935. 
Tiger Stadium on the LSU campus holds almost 92,000 and would make an adequate game site, but the city of Baton Rouge has insufficient hotel rooms and infrastructure to host an event that would attract thousands on Jan. 2. 
That means New Orleans would need to be ready to house most of the fans. participants and media going to the game. 
"We are going to contin­ue to talk with city and state officials, everybody who will need to be involved in this process," Sugar Bowl executive director Paul Hoolahan said in a teleconference from Chicago with BCS officials. 
"This is totally about 
New Orleans.~· 
Atlanta already has given Sugar Bowl officials the OK to use the Georgia Dome, which hosts the Southeastern Conference championship game in December. 
That made Atlanta an obvious and convenient choice as a temporary home for one of college football's longest-running and most recognizable events. 
The SEC has a long rela­tionship with the Sugar 
Bowl,  having  sent  its  
champion  there  for  
decades.  
The  Peach  Bowl  is  

scheduled to be played in 
the Georgia Dome on Dec. 30, and the Falcons have an NFL game scheduled there on Sunday, Jan. 1, but Atlanta officials have assured the Sugar Bowl that those games wouldn't interfere. 
Ideally, though, bowl and BCS officials would like the Sugar Bowl to remain in Louisiana. 
"We want to be part of the recovery story for the state and the Gulf region," Bowl Championship Series commissioner Kevin Weiberg said. 
The game brings $150 million-$200 million in revenue to the state and city, Hoolahan said. 
IN BRIEF 

JaS!Ui\rS' Darius out for sea­
son after ACL tear 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -. Jaguars safety Donovin Darius will miss the rest of the season after tearing a knee ligament against Indianapolis. 
Darius tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee Sunday dur­ing a punt return, and the team said Tuesday he will have season-ending surgery. 
Losing the hard-hitting safety could be a big setback for Jacksonville's vaunted defense, which has allowed 24 points in two games this season. Four-year veteran Deke Cooper, who started 10 games for the Jags in 2003, will replace Darius.

Belles win in five matches 

Dalby 
continued from page 24 
between playing midfield and defense throughout the year. 
"Greg has the ability to both defend well and also to be cre­ative in the midfield," Clark said. "So it gives him and it gives us that luxury of having someone that can pi ay two positions." 
In the team's opening exhibi­tion game against New Mexico, Dalby started at center mid­field, but went down with an injury at the end of the first half. In Notre Dame's next game against Michigan, Clark, concerned with the play of his back line against New Mexico, shifted Dalby to center back. 
Dalby stayed with the back four for the next five games, helping the Irish go 4-1 over that stretch. After moving back to center midfield during the St. John's game, Dalby remained there for Sunday's 1­0 win over Syracuse. 
Dalby, who was unanimously voted to the 2005 pre-season All Big East team, is one of tho rare in.dividuals who can play two different positions at a very high level. 
"No matter where you put him he is going to be effec­tive," junior midfielder Nate .Norman said of his classmate. "He's probably one of the few guys in the country that can be very successful at both posi­tions." 
When playing center mid­field, Dalby is mainly relied upon as the last line of defense before the back four. His team­mates insist, however, that he adds much more to the posi­tion. 
"Dalby brings more stability to the midfield," Norman said. "It gets Dalby around the ball a lot more, and he has good vision so he can find the open passes. He's able to challenge for a lot more ba~lls." 
Senior defender Dale Rellas, one of the team's other cap­tains, likes having Dalby play­ing in front of him in the mid­field. 
"When we're playing defense and we have trouble, we can always find him in the middle," Hellas said. "He's a great out­let to get our offense started." 
Rellas equally appreciates Dalby's value as a defender. 
"It's great to have him in the back because he's so solid," Rellas said. "You know he's always going to be there when you need him. And he's very vocal which is very important for us to in the back." 
Clark said Dalby's superior ball skills and creativity make him a significant improvement over the traditional "basher" style of defender. 
Dalby said he does not find switching between the two positions difficult because he has played in both spots throughout his life. Dalby played center midfield in high school and on his club teams. He has played center back, though, for the majority of his games with the under-18 and under-20 U.S. national teams. 
Dalby entered Notre Dame in the fall of 2003 as one of the most heralded recruits in pro­gram history. He was selected as the 2002 Gatorade National Player of the Year and was twice named the California high school player of the year. But Dalby never expected to be playing tw-o positions in col­lege. 
"I had no expectations to play midfield at all," Dalby said. "I came in as a cente-r back recruit, and I played cen­ter back for thf~ first half of the season." 
Dalby played center midfield for the second half of 2003, and for the entirety of his sophomore year. Dalby played mainly midfield this summer while representing the U.S. at the 2005 World Youth Championships with the under-20 national team. 
His teammates and coaches say that Dalby's willingness to change positions during games and the season is a reflection of his unselfish attitude and leadership capabilities. In addition to captaining the Irish in just his junior year, Dalby has also served as the captain of the under-18 national team and the under-20 national team this summer. Clark thinks that Dalby is continually called upon to lead his teams because of his great maturity. 
Norman, who also played with Dalby on the under-18 national team, said that Dalby is always held in high regard by his teammates. 
"I think people just tend to respect Dalby because he treats everybody on the field well," Norman said. "He never loses his composure. He's not making mistakes or getting flustered." 
Clark is unsure which posi­tion Dalby will play for the rest of the season. Dalby would like to settle in at center midfield, but mostly just wants to do whatever he can to help the team win. 
"I'd prefer to play midfield to be honest -just because you are kind of in the midst of things and you can be involved in the attack," Dalby said. ''I'm more than happy to play either one, though." 
Dalby's team-first attitude is what most impresses Clark. 
"He's such a team person that he'll do what is best for the team, and that's a big plus just on him as a person," Clark said. "He puts the team first rather than himself first. That's just Greg."

In a match that featured everything, Saint Mary's got the only thing that mattered­the win. 
The Belles prevailed over Kalamazoo College Tuesday in a five-game nail-biter, 30-21, 30-25, 32-34, 16-30, 15-13. 
It was Saint Mary's sixth win of the season, matching last season's win total. It was also the Belles' first conference win of the year in three tries. 
Saint Mary's (6-7, 1-2 MIAA) dictated the play in each of the first two games, jumping out to a 2-0 lead. 
"We were very much in con­trol early," Belles coach Julie Schroeder-Hick said. "We weren't the most energetic team, and it wasn't as crisp as I'd like to see, but it was suffi­cient to win." 
The Belles appeared to be cruising to a victory after put­ting together a quick 5-.1 run to tic the third game at 24. But on the final point of the run, setter Amanda David fell

Still they are all teammates and have been playing together since August. I would have liked to see us adapt quicker."

marked the sec­

Saint Mary's will have little

The Belles have three more 
home contests this week, the

College on Thursday. 
Schroeder-Biek spoke of the 
importance of using the

McKnight's status is day-to-day 
Weis discusses ratio of passing and rush, Crum's development 
By HEATHER 
VAN HOEGARDEN 
Sports Writer . 
Wide receiver Hhema 
McKnight, injured in Notre 
Dame's 17-10 win over 
Michigan on Sept. 10, could 
play on Saturday against 
Washington, Irish coach 
Charlie Weis said Tuesday. 
"He's gone from not playing 
to day-to-day," Weis said. "So 
he's day-to-day." 
Fellow wide receiver Jeff 
Samardzija said that he can't 
wait for his fellow receiver to 
get back on the field after 
missing Saturday's game 
against Michigan State due to 
the knee injury. 
"Anytime you've got a guy 
like Rhema on the team, you 
want him playing out on the 
field," he said. 
Airing it out 
Irish quarterback Brady Quinn threw for 487 yards on Saturday against Michigan State on 33-for-60 passing. Quinn also threw for five touchdowns, a school record, three of which went to Samardzija. Weis said he doesn't always want to throw 60 passes per game. But at the same time, he wants to do what is going to be the most successful in a given game. 

"I think you're always look­ing in the ideal world for a balance," he said. "You're looking for a balance. Now, I don't know whether the bal­ance is 50-50, 60-40. You usually don't want to be too tainted. But I can tell you right now, if you're winning a game running it on every play, there are less .bad things that can happen when you're running it than when you're throwing it." 
Back to the fundamentals 
Each week Weis says he wants the Irish to focus on going back to the fundamen­tals to improve from week to week. After Saturday's loss, this week is no different. 
"Any time you lose a game you have to identify what you feel are the things to get your mistakes corrected the fastest," Weis said. "It almost always falls back to the same thing that .if you're funda­mentally sound, you're tech­nically sound, you usually have a lot better chance for success. So, therefore, yn.u have to put the time into that rather than just doing prac­tice reps." 
Weis explained as an exam­ple that on offense, the Irish would be working on perfect­ing the three depths that a quarterback drops back, and timing that with a receiver's route. 
On defense, he used form tackling as an example of a fundamental that the team 
would focus on. 
"When you're tackling an elusive guy that's very nifty, one thing you can't do is just try to run right through the guy, because he'll make you miss," Weis said. "So you have to really wor~ on how to settle your feet and keep your hips even, to keep your balance low so when he goes to make that little juke move to make you miss, it's going to be a non-factor." 
Crum showing his talent 
Maurice Crum, Jr. has recorded 17 tackles and forced a fumble in the first three games, also his first career games after redshirt­ing as a freshman last year. Crum has filled the role of Apache linebacker nicely for Weis. 
"He's got good athletic abil­ity," Weis said. "It's a good thing that he's come along because that was one of the uncertainties we had coming into the season. With Corey [Mays) waiting in the wings at ·middle linebacker, Brandon [lloyte] being a known quality already, the one thing we really didn't know for sure was who was going to 9e that guy that you kind of put in space a lot. With his athletic ability, it's kind of put us in a position where right now he's no longer our biggest area of concern."

Today marks the beginning of the end of the fall golf season for the women of Saint Mary's, as the Belles will travel to Olivet this afternoon to compete in the first of two conference jamborees before the MIAA Championships in two weeks. 
These three competitions, the only three left on the Saint Mary's fall schedule, will determine the outcome of the MIAA conference for the 2005 season -and right now, the Belles are right where they want to be. 
After a distinctive victory at Calvin just a week ago, Saint Mary's is sitting on top of the rankings, a place the team has grown accustomed to since begin­ning its conference winning streak in 2002. The only MIAA team that has finished ahead of Saint Mary's in any competition this year is the host team of today's event. Olivet beat the Belles at Ferris State dur­ing the first event of the season, but the scoring did not affect con­ference standings. 
A lot of emphasis has been placed on Saint Mary's perform­ance in the NCAA tournament in recent years, but head coach Mark Hamilton made it certain from the beginning of the year that the team is not getting ahead of itself. 
"We don't talk a lot about NCAA in the fall," he said. "We concen­trate on winning conference, on

only familiar face on the Washington sidelines Saturday. Defensive coordinator Kent Baer, special teams coach Bob Simmons, offensive line coach Mike Denbrock, running backs coach Trent Miles and secondary coach Steven Wilks were all on Willingham's staff at Notre Dame, as well. Also on the Washington staff is former Irish punter and 2003 graduate Joey Hilbold, who is a defensive graduate assistant with the Huskies. 
"It definitely is strange to play against a couple coaches who recruited me, so it should be inter­esting," sophomore running back Darius Walker said. "The main thing I'm focused on is Washington, which is the most important game that we have. And the main thing for us this week is we need to work on what we need to do to get better and try to improve our overall game." 
One thing the Irish do have is the playbooks from last year's defense, run by Baer. Weis said he has used that to his advantage in preparing for Washington this week. 
"It helps when you have the playbook," Weis said. "You know, the playbook that Kent IBaer] hac;;, we have, so when they walk out the door, they can take everything else with them. When you have a copy of it, you have a copy of it. Kind of helps a little bit when you know the foundation of the play­book." 
Meanwhile, senior wide receiver Maurice Stovall said he remem­bers his old coac.h fondly. 
"He's a great person, a great guy, a great leader also," said Stovall, who played for making adjustments and getting 

better." 
The team has definitely had to 
make some adjustments this fall. 
After graduating three seniors last 
spring, the Belles needed players 
to step up and fill the gaps. 
Hamilton has been confident in 
this year's seniors to lead the way 
for the team. 
"[We have] two honorable men­
tion MIAA players in Megan 
Mattia and Nicole Bellino ... 
they've both had a lot of success 
and a lot of experience." Hamilton 
said. 
Mattia has had an especially successful season this year, finish­ing first for Saint Mary's in all of the team's events so far. At Calvin ·College last week, Mattia has post­
ed scores of 79 and 77 in the last -two weeks. 
Senior and co-captain Kirsten 
Fantom has· also made a big 
impact for the Belles this season. 
In addition, sophomore Katie 
O'Brien has finished in the top 
three for Saint Mary's in every 
competition so far. 
Today should not prove to be much of a surprise. The course is familiar, as are the opponents. The Belles have overcome tough competition against Division-[ schools and have made adjust­ments to get ready for the confer­ence championship. The Belles will tee-off today against all con­ference opponents for the first 18­hole round.

Willingham for three years. "Meeting with him in his office, he's helped me with things. We missed him early in the year when we were having those problems and issues with the coaching change, but we're past that now and focused on our season." 
Walker spoke of how .Willingham taught him things not only on the field but also off the field. 
"Coach Willingham was a very personable coach," Walker said. "He wac;; real personable with his players, which is what I liked about him. He taught you things off the field. I learned how to grow up and be a man. He was a very intellectual man. He always had wisdom every day." 
But each player, although hav­ing thoughts on Willingham, maintains it is still an important football game to be played. 
''I'm sure there will be some feelings-l mean, he was my head coach last year," Stovall said. "But at the same time, I don't see myself or any of the players or coaches thinking about this during the game." 
And fellow wide receiver Jeff Samardzija said he is ready for the football game. 
"We have the utmost respect for Coach Willingham and the staff he has at Washington, but I think looking at what we did last game, we're just concentrating on our­selves right now and what we can do to improve our team to get a win out in Washington," he said. 
"Hight now I think the team's real set on Notre Dame football versus Wa'ihington football." 
And Weis has no doubt his play­ers will be focused on the task at hand and not the familiar faces dotting the opposite sideline.

own half of the field. Cavanaugh quarterback Katie Dunn ran the option consistently and scored the final touchdown of the game, making the final score 24-0. 
Jloward coach Evan Walsh was still impressed with his team after the loss. 
"I am immensely proud of my team, especially the younger players," Walsh said. "If we can improve, we still have room for a very successful season." 
Next week Cavanaugh will play Badin and Howard will square ofT against Lewis. 
Walsh 12, Lewis . 7 
Julie Campbell's interception with less than two minutes remaining secured victory for Walsh Hall in the Wild Women's season-opening victory over Lewis Hall Tuesday. 
Campbell's pick came as Lewis was driving inside Walsh territo­ry, threatening to take the lead. Walsh quarterback Mary Sullivan then ran out the clock on the next three plays, sealing the vic­tory. 
The pick was the third time Walsh intercepted Lewis quarter­back Elisa Valdez, with Campbell claiming two. The other intercep­tion by Kristen Keve set up a 3­play, 15-yard go-ahead drive midway through the second half that ended in a one-yard touch­down run by Sullivan. 
At the half, Walsh led 6-0, but on the first play of the second half, Lewis struck pay dirt on a perfectly executed 65-yard hook and ladder play. 
Valdez dropped back and threw an 8-yard pass to Kara Bailey, who pitched it to tight end Jocelyn Moya. Moya avoided two tacklers and out ran the rest of the Walsh defense on her way to the end zone. Lewis then con­verted the PAT and led 7-6. 
On Walsh's ensuing possession, Sullivan found receiver Laurie Wasikowski twice for a total of 45 yards and Walsh seemed poised to recapture the lead. But on third and goal from the 10, Sullivan's pass was tipped and intercepted by Lewis safety Lauren Mullins. Three plays later, however, Valdez was inter­cepted by Keve on the Lewis 18, which led to Sullivan's score. 
"The interceptions killed us," said Lewis co-captain Kara Bailey. "We won the game for them." 

The teams traded possessions once until Campbell's second interception. 
On the second play of the game, Valdez was picked off by Campbell, who returned the ball to the 3. Walsh scored two plays later on an option run Molly Brenner. The PAT failed and Walsh led 6-0. 
· Both teams played good defense. Lewis contained the speedy Sullivan for most of the game, and Walsh held Lewis to two rrrst downs. 
"She's a great cornerback," Walsh head coach Brian Burkavage said of Campbell's performance. "She reads the ball well and breaks on it very well." 
"When we'd score the defense would feed off of us," Sullivan said. "When Julie made those interceptions we fed ofT of them. It was a team effort." 
Walsh faces Badin on Sunday while Lewis takes on Lyons, also on Sunday. 
Badin 12, Lyons 0 
The Badin Bullfrogs defeated Lyons to win their first game Tuesday night, as the second half was purely a defensive struggle and two early touchdowns proved to be the difl'erence in the game. 
Freshman quarterback Katie Hose llackney looked very confi­dent early, throwing a pair of touchdown passes in the first half. But in the end, it was the defense that solidified the victory for Bad in. It kept the Lyons offense on their heels throughout 
The Observer  SPORTS 

the contest, especially late in the game. 
"Our defense's experience real­ly showed through at the end," Badin captain Meg Charlebois said. 
Lyons, meanwhile, looked flat after a rousing 20-0 victory in its first contest.· 
"We definitely have to work out some offensive issues in practice before we play again," captain Katie Mackin said. The Lions are, however, still optimistic about their game on Sunday. 
"We have to move on and con­centrate on beating Lewis," Mackin said. 
Badin will face Walsh next, also on Sunday. 
"We're really psyched to play them," said Charlebois. "They should be pretty good but we're ready to take it to them." 
She hopes that the squad regains the form it displayed in the first half of tonight's game, when many different players contributed on offense. The Bullfrog touchdowns were scored by receivers Lizzie Shappell and Courtney Rains.

Dubree controlled the ball in the right corner of Olivet's end and launched a pass over the heads of several Comets defenders to an open Courtney on the far post. Courtney timed her jump to perfection and headed the ball past the Comet goal­keeper for the 1-1 tie in the 54th minute. 
Then, to gain the lead, all they had to do was reload and repeat. The second well­timed cross pass .to header came in the 61st minute, and it was all Saint Mary's need­ed to take its third straight MIAA win. · DuBree said she was prac­tically willing the ball to find the back of the net as she sent it over the goalkeeper's box. 
"I didn't want to lose ­one of our team goals this year is not to lose on our home field," she said. "So, I didn't want to jeopardize that early. I just tried to get it in the back of the net." 
Olivet got on the board first when freshman Kelli O'Dowd brushed the ball against the back post past Belles' keeper Laura Heline on a header from a corner kick in the 24th minute to take the 1-0 lead. 
The Belles allowed five corner kicks in the first half, one which the Comets con­verted for the goal during a letup of the Helles' defense. 
Wednesday, September 217 2005 
The first part of the opening half showed the Comets _ dominating every aspect of the game, leaving the Belles to scramble to keep up. 
"We just didn't move well 
. -we looked a little slug­gish," Belles coach Caryn Mackenzie said of the open­ing of the first half. "I think when we threw Lauren Hinton on the field, the ener­gy picked up. The swing sort of occurred as a result of [Hinton'sl hard work up front, and we just kept building on that." 
Saint Mary's quickly turned it around, and the Comets were able to push the ball out of their defen­sive end only briefly for the remainder of the game. The Belles outshot Olivet 23-10 with their rejuvenated offense. 
The Belles were on the offensive throughout the entire second half, resulting in the two comeback goals. They showed great ball con­trol and zipped the ball around Olivet's defensive half with little Comet inter­ference. 
With the victory, Saint Mary's moves into third place in the MIAA standings, passing Alma College and Olivet. After a slow start to the seas·on, the Belles are on ' a roll and have no intention of stopping. 
"This is the second time I've seen us [come from behind to win]," Mackenzie said. "This team has the ability to do that. We don't tend to get really down on ourselves when we are behind. 
"In fact, they sort of dig their heels in and figure out a way to make it happen. It's just a quality, quality team. I'm really impressed."

Now and then 

Tyrone Willingham watches the Huskies before a loss to Air Force on Sept. 3. 
Months a_fter the controversial Willingham firing, Irish focus on more than former leader 
By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN Sports Writer 
One week after Irish coach Charlie Weis prepared his team for the distractions of its first home game, the focu..'> has turned to the distraction of playing its 
former head coach. 
Saturday's matchup with Washington marks the first match up between Huskies head coach Tyrone

Willingham, fired by Notre Dame in November, and the Irish. 
"I think the emotions for those games are extremely high and will be extremely high for this one," Willingham said at his weekly press conference Monday. "The fact that you have players that I recruited, that I spent time in their homes, that does make it just a little bit different the rela­tionship, but no. When you get to the game, it's a football game." 

Weis is focused on Notre Dame versus Washington (1-2) and nothing else. He wants his play­ers to adapt that attitude, as well. 
"Our coaching staff and our team has the utmost respect for Coach Willingham, his staff, and in addition, his team and their university," Weis said. "What this week is really going to be about is us getting back to us fixing our own problems fundamentally and technically, and that's going to be our points of emphasis." 
But Willingham will not be the Observer File Photo

WOMEN'S INTERHALL FOOTBALL -BLUE LEAGUE 
Cavanaugh defeats Howard in lopsided 24-0 statement 
By JAY FITZGERALD, CHRIS HINE and FRANCIS TOlAN Sports Writers 
Midway through the first half, Cavanaugh quarterback Lisa Ruffer threw a touchdown pass to wideout Janice Flynn for the Chaos' second score on the day, and the team never looked back. 
After forcing a punt after an

initially promising Howard pos­session, Cavanaugh took the ball in its own half and drove down the field to make the score 12-0. 
An interception by Lizzy Brown on Howard's first possession gave the Chaos field position inside the Ducks' territory. Cavanaugh then scored its first touchdown on an option run when running back Tara Brown received the pitch near the goal line from Ruffer for 
Versatile Dalby helps Irish in back, midfield 
By KEVIN BRENNAN Sports Writer 
Bobby Clark needed to make a change. With the Irish trail­ing 2-0 midway through Friday's match with St. John's, the Notre Dame head coach had to get something going offensively. 
Clark quickly turned to his most versatile and perhaps most valuable player -junior tri-captain Greg Dalby. Clark moved Dalby up from the cen­ter back position to play as a

defensive midfielder. The change allowed outside defenders Jack Traynor and Ryan Miller to move up the field and help the Irish offen­sive attack. 
"When you let your fullbacks get going forward, we felt we needed somebody that could anchor the midfield," Clark said. "And nobody does that better than Greg." 
Notre Dame has relied on Dalby's flexibility all season. The junior has flip-flopped

the touchdown. 

Chaos defensive back Kerri Bergen caught the second inter­ception of the day, giving Cavanaugh good field position again. Ruffer found receiver Elisa Suarez in the end zone for the third touchdown before halftime, making the halftime score 18-0. 
For the Chaos, everything was seemingly working in the first half. With the defense forcing

two turnovers and the offense putting up three scores, Cavanaugh was a daunting pres­ence on the field. 
"They made us look good as coaches," said Chaos offensive coordinator Hunter Land. 
The Ducks defense buckled down in the second half, forcing two punts on the Chaos' ftrst two possessions. Laura Pils also recorded the only sack of the day when she brought down Huffer for a loss of about seven yards. Also, the Ducks secondary held Chaos quarterbacks to a 3-for-11 completion rating, forcing Cavanaugh to stick to the run. 

The Ducks were hurt by field position in the second half, how­ever, and could not get the offense to get them out of their
