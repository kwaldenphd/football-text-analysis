Hesburgh n~~ed to draft comm1ss1on 

by Bob Schueler Yesterday, Father Theodore 
M. llesburgh was appointed by President Nixon to a commission charged with the development of a plan for eliminating the draft in favor of an all-volunteer armed force. 
The Chief Executive set up an 
advisury commission under the 
chairmanship of Thomas S. 
Gates Jr., former secretary of 
defense in the Eisenhower 
Administration, who is now a 
New York banker. 
In naming the commission, 
President Nixon said, "To 
achieve the goal of an 
all-volunteer force we will 
require the best efforts of our 
military establishment and the 
best advice we can obtain from 
eminent citizens and experts in 
many related fields of national 
endeavor." 
Elaborating on the task of the 

Mayor Allen stays adamant In having annexation proceed 
Mayor Lloyd M. Allen, in a 
news conference yesterday, re­
stated his determination to an­
nex the Notre Dame and Saint 
Mary's properties. 
The principal purpose of the 
conference was to clear up the 
confusion surrounding annexa­
tion proposals. 
City Council President Robert 
0. Laven, also at the news con­ference, announced a proposal to annex St. Joseph County Air­port, which will be introduced within a month. 
Both Father Theodore M. 
Hesburgh and the Notre Dame 
trustees are negative to the idea. 
Father llesburgh is.~ued a state­
ment on March 20 concerning 
the annexation. 
"It was disappointing to be 
faced with unilateral action on 
the part of the city before the 
advantages and disadvantages, 
both to the city and to the 
University, could be thoroughly 
discussed by both parties." 
The mayor listed seven points in the clarification of the an­nexation. 
I) Many urban problems arc caused by lack of orderly an­nexation. This annexation is es­sential to local government. 
2) Northward expansion is necessary in order to protect the South Bend community. This is part of an overall plan developed after thorough examination. 
3) Discussion concerning an­nexation has been under way with Notre Dame for about four years. 
4) South Bend has been pro­viding police and fire protection for Saint Mary's and Notre Dame without pay. He men­tioned that two hundred fire alarms have been answered be­tween 1964 and 1968. 
5) South Bend needs revenue. Furthermore it is not fair for South Bend taxpayers to supply services outside of the city. 
6) State motor vehicle refunds would be increased by the an­nexation (refunds are pro­portional to city population). 
7) Private character of insti­tutions would not change. 
The Mayor said that he has been consulting with Notre Dame concerning the annexa­tion, but that now a more direct system of negotiations is needed. Laven then emphasized the need for a systematic approach to the annexation in order for success to be realized. 
Father Hesburgh 

·co mmJssJon, President Nixon stated, "The commission will study a broad range of possibilities for increasing the supply of volunteers for service, including increased pay, benefits, recruitment, incentives, and other practicable measures to make military careers more attractive to young men. It will consider possible changes in selection of standards and in utilization policies which may assist in eliminating the needs for induction. It will study the c st imated costs and savings resulting from an all-volunteer force, as well as the broader social and economic implications of this program." 
However, the President cautioned that, "The transition to an all-volunteer armed force must, of course, be handled cautiously and responsibly so that our national security is fully maintained." 
President Nixon closed on a note of encouragement, however, saying, "I have instructed the Department of Defense and other agancies of the Executive Branch to support 
this study and provide needed information and assistance as a matter of high priority. The comnliSSJOn will submit its report to me in carl:/ November, 1969." 
When contacted last night, Father Hesburgh had this to say about his appointment, "It is another job. If it weren't so important to the younger generation and to the students at Notre Dame, I don't think I would have accepted it." 
When asked why he thought President Nixon appointed him, Father Hesburgh replied, "I brought it (the idea of a commission) up very seriously with him and talked with him for a long time about it. So I guess when you open your mouth about something, you get asked to work on it. This is what happened when President Nixon called me last week and asked me to be on the commission. I've turned down appointments to some very exciting things recently, but I couldn't in good conscience turn this down since it is so important to young people today." 
Besides Father Hesburgh and Thomas Gates, the chairman, the commission consists of thirteen other me:nbers prominent in the fields of economics, business, education, military affairs, politics, and civil rights. 
Among this distinguished group arc three people besides Father Hcsburgh who have been associated with Notre Dame. These three are Crawford Greenwalt, an executive of E. I. DuPont & Co. and Roy Wilkins, Ex ecu t i vc Director of the NAACP, who received degrees from Notre Dame; and Alfred

For at least six halls 


Parietals this weekend! 
by Ted Price 

Parietal rules may go into effect in as many as twelve halls this weekend as the Tripartite Ha II Life Board continues approving their constitutions and legislative and judicial structures. In a statement released last night, Ron Mastriana, a Board member and student spokesman for the group said: 
"By decision of the Student Life Council last Monday, the resolutions on parietal rules, approved by the Board of Trustees earlier this month, will go into effect upon the approval of hall constitutions, and operating hall councils and judicial boards by the Tripartite Hall Life Board when certified to the Vice President of Student Affairs, Rev. Charles I. McCarraghcr. Fr. McCarraghcr has been notified that the following six halls have been so approved and may enact visitation hours Friday evening: Badin, Carroll, Keenan, Lyons, Pangborn and Zahm. Six other halls will be immediately pending minor changes in their constitutions." 
Mastriana refused to name the other six halls but said that the necessary changes arc "so minor that prompt action by the hall councils in question could bring 
about their approval so that 
they, too, can begin parietals at 
five Friday." 

"I don't want to publicly 
criticize any individual halls or 
hall councils," he continued, "so 
I won't release the names of the 
halls that still have to meet our 
requirements. But I will be in 
touch with their Presidents later 
this evening (Thursday), so that 
they can clear these changes up 
right away." 

Mastriana said that some halls had to clarify voting procedures, others had to demonstrate that the Rector and one or more Assistant Rector or prefects were voting and speaking members of the hall councils. Still other halls merely had to submit rosters of hall council members. 
Badin Rector Edgar Whelan, who is also Director of Student Housing, a post recently created by the Student Life Council, has been appointed to deal with these charges and will notify McCarragher as they become effective. As soon as this occurs, these halls will also be permitted to enact visitation hours within the limits set down by the recent bill. 
The legislation passed by the SLC and approved by the trustees permits women visitation hours in the residence halls for a total of no more than twenty-four hours from five 

p.m. Friday through eleven p.m. Sunday. However, no hall's hours may extend beyond one 
a.m. any day nor begin earlier than one p.m. any day but Friday. The formulation of the exact hours in each hall is left to the discretion of the individual 
hall  councils,  within  the  
restrictions  set down  by  the  
policy.  

Earlier this week, a member of the Hail Life Board said that it would be impossible for the Board to authorize any halls to enact visitation hours this weekend. However, since that time, accroding to Fr. Whelan, the Board decided to review as many halls applications as possible. 
"Students should realize that just these approvals represent about 4lh or five hours work," said Whelan. "Each Board member took copies of these constitution home and read them, noted them, and so forth. Then the members met together and made their decisions." 
Whelan added that there has 
been a misconception of the experimental basis of the rules and the actual feelings of the Board of Trustees on the subject. 
''This experimental period extends to January, not to June.

DeVries expresses his technique

"De Vries' technique involves combining a comic surface with a serious substance. He will get the reader laughing at something and then hit him with the tragic and horrifying aspect of the 
material."

De Vries continued with the idea of the innerself by stating, "Fiction is autobiographical. Before an author can write on the inner self of his characters, he must know his own inner self. The purpose of fiction is to make the reader sec." De Vries 
stated that the reader should see not only the physical makeup of the character, but also the internal makeup. Since TV only lets us sec the physical makeup

Turnbull 
The next Saint Mary's student body president must solve the little problems that make life at Saint Mary's less than tolerable, and begin to consider the more important question of college goals as well. Through experience on the Campus Judicial Board and the Aims and Purposes Committee, Susan Turnbull is aware of both kinds of problem. But Susan Turnbull's primary qualification for office overshadows her experience and awareness. She offers the Saint Mary's student body an approach to solutions that will work. 
For too long the nebulous term "community" has been used to stifle individuality at Saint Mary's. When a student attempts to do something different, she is told that it will hurt the "community" and damage its "image", whatever that is. Susan Turnbull feels that Saint Mary's student government in the past has represented "the average Saint Mary's student" rather than a group of individuals, further homogenizing the student body. Susan Turnbull feels that there are certain individual rights that belong to the student body and do not need to be asked for. These rights should be acted upon. In addition she hopes to diversify the student body for the future by changing the admissions policy, and improving the scholarship program. 
Susan Turnbull believes that at the present time community government is actually a government composed of three communities, administration, faculty, and students, in that order. She feels that student opinion will only be heard if it is considered one-third of a three-part democratic government, rather than bottom-voice on a three-voice totem pole. She will make sure that student opinion is 
heard. THE OBSERVER believes that Susan Turnbull can make student 
opinion heard. She is not a hard-core realist, but neither is she overly-naive. She is not over-bearing, but neither is she easily intimidated. And the next Student Body President at Saint Mary's 
College will have to have nerve. THE OESER VER overwhelmingly endorses Susan Turbull for Student Body President. 
Student Housing 
Father Riehle's office issued a directive on student housing yesterday. It talks about housing for next year-both off-campus housing and about living on campus. Probably what it doesn't say is more important than what it says. 
First of all its states that all present Freshmen will be forced to live on campus next year. Unless, of course, they are married or have parents in the vicinity. All of next year's incoming Freshmen class will be forced to live on campus. 
Secondly it states that present Juniors who are now living on campus and want to move off next year may do so by notifying their rector. Present Juniors who are living off campus may stay there if they wish or can move back on campus. 
Present Sophomores, however, are left in a very nebulous position. Those who are living off campus now can remain off only with the formal written consent of their parents. Sophomores living on campus now, however, can not, according to the directive, be given ''any information at this time about the possibility of living off campus next year. This will depend on the room selection by Seniors." 
Besides being very unclear about a number of things, especially about whether or not Sophomores can live off campus next year, the directive has a number of other faults. 
It deals very ineffectively with a very important question. Is the ultimate goal of the Notre Dame administration an entirely residential university? From the sense of the directive one could draw the conclusion that is the plan. 
We are absolutely opposed to the concept of a residential University here at Notre Dame. We feel that if a student wants to live off campus he should be allowed to. "Allowed to" is not the right phrase. The University has no right to demand that a student attending here live on campus. 
For too long the administration has forced students who didn't maintain a certain academic average to live off-campus when they didn't want to. The rule was stupid. The very people who needed and wanted a residential environment for their academic development were deprived of it. 
Father Riehle's office attempted to treat in a directive a problem that should be discussed and decided in the Student Life Council. The whole idea of a residential university should be aired and discussed.

Present Freshmen will be required to live on campus unless married or living with their parents in this vicinity.---­
Directive from the Dean of Students When the new dorms started ascending out of the tundra north of the-library, the general impression was that these new edifices would reduce the abominable overcrowding and lack of social facilities in the present halls on campus. There were a few prophets of doom who wisely predicted that the Flanner complex or Kennedy-King Halls (pending final choice of names) merely become the first in a series of devices to be used to fetter the student body to the campus. There prognosticators got the typical prophet treatment: disbelief, scorn, and laughter. Unfortunately their visions were accurate. Refurnishing, three man suites and four man suites and lounges and carpets and those naked curtain rods recently installed are going to be quite nice in every hall, and the accomodations are .indeed Slll!lptuous in the new halls. With parietals approved campus life most certainly becomes more appealing than during the days of nine by eleven "forced doubles" and prohibitions by rectors against sofas and easy chairs and rugs. If there is any one thing that has changed the character of this 
campus since the present senior class arrived here in September of 1965 it is the mass exodus to the land of the "day dog." Campus social and intellectual life have been more affected by this trend 
than any other current of change. 
The idea of a community would seem to imply a sense of openness and free association. It's hard to see how demanding campus residence will ever result in a community unless everybody finally admits what most of us have know for years: Community means whatever Father Hesburgh wants it to mean at a particular point in time. 
A community need not imply residence for all of its members within the shrubbed perimeters of Du Lac. We're led to believe that faculty and administrators and students make up the community. Three of the six university vice presidents including Rev. Charles I. McCarragher live off campus; and it's rather interesting to note that although there arc going to always be a few professors residing on campus-the vast, vast majority of the faculty can be full and most essential participants in the community without living on campus. 
People contribute to the community and take from it in different ways and in different degrees. To demand that someone live on any campus or more specifically on Notre Dame's campus when he doesn't want to is anthetical to the concept of the community itself. 
It would seem that the realization must be made that there will 
always be people who want to live on campus, but it is absurd to think that everyone wants to or should live in a residence hall on the campus of the University of Notre Dame. 
In one respect the University is getting what it deserves. Notre Dame has been negligent in attending to the quality of those of a mediocre state penal system. Father Hesburgh's answer to parietals was always some reply using the expression "men's bedrooms," yet there was never more than eloquent promises of lounges. The administration positions have resembled the deaf stockbroker's before the impending crash. All the signs of coming doom were there, but only after the bottom fell out of the market was the order placed to sell. 
Now people live off campus and even more want to move off. 
Maybe that directive means only what it says: that sophomores won't be able to live off campus next year. Or then again, maybe it's only the beginning, and we're going to see more towers, or traps if you will, popping up between the Library and Stepan Center. 
In either case, the administration is showing the true colors of community. 
In either case, it's obvious that the Administration, Father Hesburgh, and the me too Board of Trustees intends to attempt to rerpetuatc the paternalism of the 1950's and '60's into the '70's.

!: Complete co-education is the only answer 
::l 

This is the last in a [ive part series by Barry /Ireen and Jim Pe/ligrin. 
Last night as I sat here wondering how to finish this series, a student who had been following the articles came to my room. lie was concerned and very much upset because eight Notre Dame men in his section had just taken turns screwing a woman one of them had brought in for the occasion. Think of it guys-a gang bang. Think of the line of Notre Dame men in the corridor dad only in jockey shorts, each with a number provided him by a social commissioner they had appointed, waiting, giggling. And think of those embarrassed, disgusted men, each one chuckling some comment to himself to keep away the shame as he emerged alone from the room where he had just spent himself into a receptacle that couldn't have cared less. 
Of course, many well-intentioned people will usc incidents such as the "gang bang" described above as "evidence" in support of tightening the present restrictions on man-woman contact at Notre Dame. The argument for increased or more tightly enforced restrictions runs roughly as follows: "If that's what happens when we let women into the Notre Dame Community, we'd better damn well keep them out." We can only suggest that the advocates of such a "damp down" policy consider the following psycho­logical study conducted by Guetzleow and Bowman~ During the Second World War, the army took a group of conscientious objectors and substantially limited the amount of food each was to receive. Strange behavior patterns resulted. Guys began to fight over food, hang pictures of steaks on the wall and dream about carrots and string beans. Their conversation was entirely preoccupied with the food they lusted for and needed. It doesn't take an overly active imagination to draw a parallel between food depriva­tion and a genume hunger, felt in all parts of the' anatomy from the brain on down, for the special companionship that only a person of the opposite sex can provide -a hunger that can grow all out of proportions to become an obsession that is psycho­logically damaging. 
Perhaps I am simply naive in assuming that if any of those persons involved had been given sufficient opportunities to he with women on a more natural basis, to laugh, talk and yes, even to make love with a woman with whom he could share love, trust and respect instead of just a bed, not one would have found it necessary to take part in such an unsatisfying and completely degrading action as a gang bang. I might be wrong, but to me the incident is an extreme example of the sickness that you and I both share. 
During the course of writing these articles, it has occurred to us to ask what reasons could possibly be postulated for the sexual segregation that exists here. 

We have blundered upon these words from the encyclical of Pius XI entitled, On the Christian Hducation o[ Youth. 
False also and harmful to Christian education is the so-called method of "co-education." This too, by many of its supporters, is founded upon naturalism and the denial of original sin; but by all, upon a deplorable confusion of ideas that mistake a levelling promiscuity and equality for the legitimate associa­tion of the sexes .... There is not in nature itself, which fashions the two (sexes) quite different in organism, in temperament, in abilities, anything to suggest that there can be or ought to be promiscuity, and much less equality in the training of the two sexes. 
To say that Pius's views on sexual inequality are ill founded would be to say too little. And to say that his vision of segregation in education is antiquated would merely mean a regurgitation of this entire series. We can find nothing unpromiscuous about a gang hang, nothing moral about masturbation or joy rides, nothing commendatory about an imposed prolongation of adolescent behavior or the vacuity that an all-male environment leaves in the classroom. And yet, all are products of that system of segrega­tion Pius so strongly advocated. 
Even Fr. llesburgh will say that he recognizes the need for women at Notre Dame. He will talk of all he has tried to do-of cluster college, of expansion of the co-ex program and might even suggest tentative plans to increase enrollment at St. Mary's. In the May 2 issue of The Scholastic, we will attempt to demon­strate that any answer short of complete internal co-education here will be no real answer to the existing problem at all. We will try to prove that co-education is not only the most adequate and speedy, but also the most fiscally feasible solution imaginable. 
It is our belief that Notre Dame could begin to admit women to the undergraduate level in one y'ear. Granted, much close study must he done by those more competent than ourselves. There are undoubt­edly questions and difficulties that will arise we neither have the wisdom nor the information to anticipate or alleviate. 
But at present, such a study has not even been begun. And there is no reason to suppose it will be as long as the student body here remains apathetic. Apparently, the mother of us all, the Blessed Virgin atop the golden dome, does not realize yet that her children are in pain will refuse to know until those children cry out and make their illness known. No one likes a screaming child, but it is the price a mother must pay for her lack of perception. 
The pain and the thirst we all feel must be assuaged. Freshmen and Sophomores, you involun­tary participants in Fr. Hesburgh's ancient and nebulous concept of community who are being forced to live on campus next year in a family without mother or sisters, you of course, would benefit most immediately from any move to co-edu­cation. Juniors, you will be the leaders of next year's student body. As such, you will find, strangely enough, a curious responsibility to underclassmen for any beneficial change that might be made at this University. And Seniors, you and I, straddled with an ever increasing feeling of impotence, know better than anyone the frustrations, the inadequacies, and the sterility of our present all-male environment. Don't permit others to suffer as you have suffered. 
We are all men here, not eunuchs-not yet anyway. Castration must not be allowed. Don't permit the issue of co-education to die without giving it the opportunity to breathe and to live. 
Contemporary Arts Festival encompasses ''funk'' art 
by Bruce Bowles 
The Contemporary Arts Festival, which will last for a month-March 30-April 30-is sponsored by the Contemporary Arts Committee. The f<estival will include all forms of contemporary art from "funk" art to contemporary music and dance. 
The Festival will open at 3:00 I'M this Sunday in the main art gallery in O'Shaughnessy with a program entitled "Contemporary Art in the Midwest". Ronald Pcnkoff from the University of Wisconsin will deliver the opening lecture. 
The lecture will concern Penkoff's works-a group of graphics-on display in the exhibit. After the lecture, refreshments will be served, and the gallery will remain open until 6:00. This will he one of the first experiments in mixed media ever to take place in the gallery. The exhibit will be composed of works by some of the most prominent young midwestern artists. 
The works cover a wide range of technique, medium, and style. Included in the exhibit will he massive hard-edged canvasses, panelled structures, "funk" art, weaving, large metal sculpture, 
and other various constructions. 
Some ot the works are very 
subjective, with political 
overtones, such as "The L.B .J. 
Machine". Many of these artists 
particip"aied in the "Violence in 
Contemporary Arts Show" held 
in Chicago last fall. 
On the other hand , some of 
the remaining works are more 
abstract and objective. 
Konstantin Melonadis, from 
the Notre Dame Art 
Department, and highly noted 
for his kinetic sculpture, has a 
couple of works entered in the 
show. 

The festival will continue on 
April 16 with a play, "Faust", 
pre sen ted by the Firehouse 
Theater, one of the leading experimental theaters in the country. The subtitle of the play, "A Mass for Actors and Audience on the Passion and Birth of John Faust According to the Spirit of our Tirues", gives us a summary of the "throbbing drama of sin and remorse", as it is described by th'e Contemporary Arts Committee. 
The quality of the play is indicated by the contributing authors: Bob Dylan, Allen Ginsberg, John Lennon, T.S. Elliot, and William Shakespeare. 
Mixed media will be 

incorporated in the appearance James Dickey, a former of the Reddich Dance Company. football player and Air Force Mr. Redich, who was included in pilot, will also participate in the the Hunter College Dance Series, Festival. He turned to poetry has received critical acclaim for seven years ago and has his work in modern published six volumes since. He choreography. is also a poetry consultant to !he 
Library of Congress. 
Paul Carroll, who published the "Young Poets of America" last year, which was highly 
praised,  will  also  participate  in  
the Festival.  
The  Creative  Associates,  a  

group of top young musicians and composers from the Univeristy of Buffalo, will present a concert of new music. They arc under the leadership of Luca Foss, a noted avant garde composer and conductor. This will he one of the first appearances of the Associates in 
the Midwest. 
Emma Kounty, who has made guest appearances with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, will appear in the Festival to give a piano concert. 
Also included in the Festival will be a concert of songs by Patrick Maloney, a group of films, a blues concert, and a light show. Most of these events will be accompanied by explanatory and complementary lectures. 
Patrick Dowdall, spokesman for the Contemporary Arts Committee, expressed his optimism concerning the Festival: "This promises to be one of the best f<estivals in the history of the Notre Dame art gallery."

Pseudo pscudos 
Editor: 
Such reasoning as presented in the Observer concerning the seating at Lc Roi Jones' lecture accentuates the phoniness and ignorance of whites who know nothing of true integration. If those pscudo-pseudos realized what integration is, there would be no confusion between physi­cal intermingling and integra­tion. A white seated next to me is still culturally, and therefore actually as far away from me as the moon is from the earth. It is obvious that the Civil Rights Bill of 1964 is passe, and phony. The question here is human rights not civil rights; and, if they arc denied from blacks they arc to be taken not asked for. 
llow can whites and blacks come together when black his­tory has been denied by whites by its omission and white his­tory has been forced on us by its insertion in the curriculum? Furthermore if Notre Dame was truly committed to integration, we would have more than a I% black student body and a Black Studies Program to meet our needs when we get here. The home of the Chairman of the Civil Rights Commission is itself a machine perpetuating racism. 
Whereas, the lives of all blacks and our black history has been denied us, and whereas we are the oppressed-it is incumbent upon blacks to initiate our own salvation and awareness. It is 
terre for blacks to receive aid from whites, and as a result there is no meaning in their physical intermingling. If we as blacks feel that our survival is aided by our sitting together and being together, whites can have no say in the matter-for they will not supply us with a true solution since the destruction of their system is necessary to our salvation. This situation is irrevo­cable, and who-is-to-blame? Whitey! 
R,.ick Ames Right to vote 
Editor: 
Before all the Saint Mary's women trudge off to the polls on Friday, I'd like to comment on our participation in the SMC "community". 
In regard to the requirements for voting, it is apparent that to be a member of the Saint Mary's community is not enough to earn the right to go to the polls. Instead we must attend an Open Forum to hear the issues. Then if we arc not lulled to sleep, we may vote. 
What makes this prerequisite even more ridiculous is that only one position is contested. This indicates to me that either Student Government is considered irrelevent or that no one really cares. The extra requirement for voting can act as no more than a guarentee that e vcn fewer than usual will bother to vote. This will hardly directly the result of my absence from the Open Forum, because I am choosing not to attend with the same reasoning that I am choosing not to vote. Instead it will be a protest against the ideas that have plagued campaign rhetoric (the yearly attempt to define the real role of the Saint Mary's woman and other high and noble intellectual pursuits), the lack of enthusiasm about Student Government and what it is really here for and how we can usc it. 
Midst claims of what Student Government has done this year, I ask if smoking in rooms and dining halls; abolishment of curfews and other such achievcmnets are really what know what Cavanaugh llall was like three years ago: the locked doors, the sign-in by twelve-thirty ritual, the "priests" always in and out of your room. 

But that has ended, mostly. We demanded that certain rights be recognized and they were recognized. 
Now we have demanded that our right to entertain women be recognized, and this has not come about. Instead, parietal hours have been "granted to the. students on an experimental basis." Instead of the halls determining their own procedures and hours, the mart i a I "sign-in" has been dictated. 
And we have been warned, "One false move, kiddies, and 
it's all over." 
This is real progress. 
We must want parietal hours awfully much to accept them on these terms, as a permission from parent to child, as a gift for good behavior. 
I'm waiting for the day after they throw some students out for neglecting to sign, sign, sign, when we have to march over to the administration building and demand some kind of justice. They'll have the perfect answer: 
"Get back to your rooms or we'll take your parietal hours away. You've got fifteen minutes." 
Respectfully, 
Richard F. Gaeke, '70 
Student Government is for. r------------------------------------------------------. 
There must be more. 
The stereotyped platforms have all been read, heard, or discussed at lunch by now. They were last year and if there is no change, the same ones will be tossed around again next year. I'm not voting this year because it did no good in three years past. The script reads the same this year, the forecast is the same. Names and faces change but old mountains never die. It's nice to live where there is not the discomfort of activity and progress. Or is it?

Academy in Massachusetts;' 
Jeanne L. Nobel, professor of 
education at New York 
University; Lauris Norstad, 
former Supreme Allied 
Commander of Europe and 
NATO head,; and W. Allen 
Wallis, president of the 
University of Rochester in New 
York. 
Commenting on the other 
members of the commission, 
Father Hesburgh said, "I've 
known Tom Gates (the 
chairman) for years and he is a 
very good friend of mine. I 
know he is an extremely capable 
person. I know most of the 
other people on the commission 
and they are all very capable 
people. Alfred Gruenther and 
Lauris Norstad are two of the 
brightest people in the military. 
The commission consists of a 
spread of people whose opinions 
would be very receptive to the 
American people." 
Father Hesburgh concluded, 
"I think it is possible that this 
concept will be economically 
and socially feasible. I would 
think we might have to get rid of 
the Vietnam situation before we 
could implement this plan. Our 
number one problem is getting 
rid of Vietnam, but I would 
seriously hope that the concept 
of a volunteer army to replace 
the draft will someday become a 
reality."
