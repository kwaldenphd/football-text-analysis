Through Alumni Club 
Summer placement plans underway
by Barbara Breitenstein 
~~ 
Tentative plans for a summer placement program through the Notre Dame Alumni Club presidents were made during the national board of the University's Alumni Association's annual winter meeting last week. 
By coordinating the effort with club presidents and students here, the program hopes to relieve some of the work now left to the University placement office, according to Ed Byrne, student body president. 
"The alumni club presidents don't have any idea where to start," Byrne stated. "With student effort here, we could get much better results. It wouldn't be such a burden on the presidents." 
Byrne discussed the program with two members of the board 01 directors, Joe White and Jim Hunt, who began work on the project last year. 
"They checked things out before," Byrne reported, "and said last week that things had almost reached the point where we can start work on this end.'' 
The program will consist of sending a list of students' resumes to alumni club presidents who will contact ND graduates in their cities in order to tinct available jobs for students. Students here will keep in weekly contact with club presidents and will gather and send resumes. 
"We hope to start a pilot program in Washington, D.C.," Byrne continued, "but we probably won't place too many students this summer. It's all very tentative now." 
A Senior Alumni Night at the Senior Bar is also tentatively scheduled for Senior Week. according to Byrne. This will afford seniors the l.'hance to meet the Alumni Club presidents from the cities where they will be working after graduation. 
The selection of 12 nominees for six board positions to be chosen at the Alumni Senate meeting in April and the selection of this year's recipient of the Association's Sorin Award for distinguished service as an alumnus were discussed in last week's meeting. 
The board, chaired by Association President John O'Brien of Birmingham, Ala., also made plans for the Senate meeting, the Universal Notre Dame Night, a meeting of one hundred Alumni Clubs, by Jayne Rfzzo and for the June reunion. A five-year plan of future Alumni Board Staff Reporter meetings to be held on campus was also approved.

The .first story examined the admissions policies for women at Notre Dame and the second explored the admis­sion of minorities to the Unlvenlty. 
by Patrick Cole 
Staff Reporter 

Those predominantly white and formerly all-male colleges that switched to a coed student body generally have a common goal in their admissions policies: to in­crease the number of women and minorities. 
We have seen how the policies of Notre Dame's admission offic~ have been used to attract and increase members of these two groups to the University. What is the nature of the admissions poli­cies at colleges similar to Notre Dame? 
Sex-blind admissions 

Unlike Notre Dame, other col­leges formerly all-male and now coed have a sex-blind admissions policy for women. In selecting applicants for a given incoming freshman class, there exists no quota for women. "Women are admitted without any differentiat­ion at our school," said James Schweikhardt, director of admiss­ions at the University of Santa Clara in California, operated by the Society of Jesuits. 
Santa Oara University, which went coeducational in 1961, has 3,200 students, of which 41 per cent are women. 

Most Ivy League institutions such as Yale, l:larvard and Prince­ton, adhere to the same policy for women. 
Harvard College, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is experiencing its first year of a unified admissions· office. "Harvard is coeducational through Harvard College and Rad­cliffe College," revealed Bill Fitz­simmons, co-director of under­graduate admissions at Harvard. "Nevertheless, all students receive a degree under the name of Harvard College and there exist no quotas for women." 
Yale and Princeton Universities introduced coeducation to their student body in the late 1960's. In 1972, Yale abandoned a quota for women; last year, Princeton swit­ched to the sex-blind admir.sions policy. 
Ohio Dominican College in Col­umbus, a formerly all-female col­lege which went coed in 1964, has abandoned the quota policy for men. Of the 1,100 students, women compose 55 per cent of the student body. "Once scholarships were offered to encourage men to come 
here," stated Bob Anderson, assis· 
tant director of admissions at Ohio 
Dominican. Said Susan McGough, 
director of admissions at Ohio 
Dominican, "I am very opposed to 
having quotas--especially for wo­
men." 
Notre Dame, having limited fe­
male accommodations, must limit 
the number of women admitted. 
Since these other colleges have coeductttional housing facilities, a blind-sex policy for admissions does not call for drastic changes to be made in facilities. Ai!cording to Timothy C. Callard, director of admissions at Princeton, if more women enroll in the University, "it would not affect the campus." 
'''The facilities can be used by either men or women," he said. "Some dormitories are single-sex and some are coed. In the event that many women enrolled--more than anticipated--only the bath­room facilities would be of concern; they would have to be converted." 
Princeton has 4,400 undergrad­uates of which 1,400 are women. 
Minority enroUment poUcles 
At other admissions offices of predominantly white colleges, one finds the emphasis on increasing the number of minority students. "As for minorities," continued Schweikhardt of Santa Clara Uni­versity, "we admit the student who is qualified. Yet we make every effort to encourage minorities to come.'' 
"We recruit for minorities," he continued. "But this is a popular misconception. This may be be­lieved to pertain to students who are not prepared. We admit those minority students who are able to succeed." 
At Harvard, all students are evaluated by the same criteria according to Fitzsimmons. Like Notre Dame, efforts are made to encourage minority applicants in the applicant pool. 
(continued on page 3) ous areas of the Student Union makes it a much smoother running organization than it has been in the past. 


The facet of the Student Union which met with the most criticism last year was its finances. Changes implemented in the budget policy have shrunk last year's $91,000 deficit figure considerably. ''The emphasis has been on foresight and budgeting," stated Birsic, "and we're pretty pleased with the results so far." 
With a cash flow of approximate­ly $750,00 per year, management of finances is critical. This year, the money power has been centralized, whereas in the past, each commis­sion had its own business mana­gers, and no one co-ordinator was aware of the organization's overall financial state. Comptroller Jim Hummer says the commissions have all stayed in their budgets except one. 
The Services Commission was one of those that made money last semester. They started an Off ­Campus Newsletter containing events on and off campus, but it will not be kept up this semester due to the cost. Last year's controversial summer storage pol­icy will be reviewed in the next few days, and Services Commissioner Casey Nolan stated they were open for suggestions. The campus re­frigerator sales went well this year, but hopes for next year include the elimination of a middle man to increase the profits for the Student Union without over-charging the student purchasers. The movie policy on campus was revamped to reduce the number of conflicting show times. Also the number of clubs participating was limited. This year, every club sponsoring a movie made money, while last year many clubs lost money due to audience over-saturation. 
The Services Commission is re­sponsible for putting together the Freshman Register, distributing telephone books, and running the book exchange. Between semes­ters, over $4,000 changed hands in this operation. "There is always a need for more people to help on special projects," said Nolan. "We want to be of the greatest service to the greatest number of students." 
Last semester's concert lineup was one of the best in years, according to Birsic. There is a new 
~ 
chairman of concerts who contacts the groups directly, rather than dealing with a mediating agent in New York, which was much more expensive. The concert schedule is expected to be just as appealing this semester. 
The Academic Commission 
sponsored many diversified speak­
ers last semester. Many well ­
known figures spoke about their 
special areas of concern. Toward 
the end of the semester, the rather 
sparse attendance began to pick 
up. This semester, the commission 
is planning to bring in a few 
speakers in conjunction with other 
groups. 
Senator Sam Irvin may be able to speak, and a lecture series in conjunction with the economics department is featured. Academic Commissioner Dennis Pijor stated, "We're bringing in the larger names so the whole University will want to come." 
The major accomplishment for the Social Commission according to Charlie Moran, was the re-estab­lished confidence at the South Bend Armory after a year and a half of distrust. 
There are three armory parties slated for this semester and the first, on Friday night, was deemed most successful by Moran. Two other dances are scheduled also: one for the Mock Convention and a dance marathon for Logan Center. 
Headlining for coming attract­ions are The Amazing Kreskin, and the National Lampoon Comedy team. The Wackie Winter Week­end promises fun in the snow. The Quickie was a much-utilized and much-appreciated asset which is continuing during this semester. Both the Nazz and Darby's Place featured a variety of special talent. Homecoming was a financial suc­cess as well as being "definitely one of the best dances at Stepan in quite some time," according to Social Commissioner Kathy Smouse. 
Annual events comprise many of the activities sponsored by the Student Union. These include the Sophomore Literary Festival, the Midwest Blues Festival, Mardi Gras, An Tostal and the Collegiate Jazz Festival. New activities com­ing up include the Mock Political Convention, the Black Cultural Arts Festival and the Bicentennial

BEIRUT, Lebanon--Cease-fire "enforcer teams" toured Beirut yesterday using bullhorns to urge rival gunmen to clear the streets. . Despite the aura of impending peace, Christian concern mounted 
over the growing Palestinian role in Lebanon. 
The general feeling in Beirut was that the worst of civil war is over. However, the country remained virtually partitioned between heavily armed Moslem and Christian camps with a political settlement on paper only.

UMTED NATIONS, N.Y.-:The United States vetoed a resolution last night that would have put the Security Council on record in favor of Palestinian statehood. 
It was the 13th Security Council veto cast by the United States and the fourth dealing with a Middle East issue.

ND World Hunger Coalition sets goal of 1000 volunteer tasters 
by Mary Mungovan Staff Reporter 
The Notre Dame World Hunger Coalition will launch a pledge drive today and tomorrow in the dining halls to recruit volunteers for the Wednesday Night Fast Program, Co-chairman Doug Allen announ­ced yesterday. 
"Each student who signs a pledge agrees to fast on Wednes­day evenings from Feb. 4 until May 5, excluding finals week," Allen stated. "For each participant, the Coalition receives 75 cents per night from the Dining Hall." 
Approximately 500 students par­ticipated in last semester's pro­gram for which the Coalition re­ceived over $4,000, according to Ceyl Prinster, communications dir­ector. When the fast program first began in the spring of 1975, the Coalition raised only $1100. 
"We've intensified this semes­ter's campaign in the hopes of reaching our new goal of 1,000 

volunteers,'' Allen related. 
"Money is not our only goal," he continued. "By fasting, we hope people can come to realize how it feels to be hungry, even if it's only for one night a week." 
According to Greg Gramelspach­er, Coalition research director, three-fourths of the money goes to overseas agencies such as CORR, CARE, and UNICEF and one ­fourth to the poor of South Bend. 
"Each of the agencies has been thoroughly researched by the Coal­ition's Research Committee," Prinster explained. "All overseas charities have to be international in scope and operate with maximum efficiency and minimum overhead to be selected," she added. 
The World Hunger Coalition was begun in November, 1974, to "educate the Notre Dame and South Bend community about glo­bal hunger" and to raise money for the hungry, according to Allen. Last semester, in addition to the fast program, the Coalition spon-
Busing for Mardi Gras ends; defeated by vote of HPC 
by James Flahaven Staff Reporter 
This year marks the first time that Notre Dame will not invite women in from outside schools for Mardi Gras. 
It had become a tradition, before Notre Dame went co-educational, to invite women from various mid-west colleges here for the Mardi Gras weekend. But with the growing enrollment of women at Notre Dame, tiJere came to be a strong resentment of bringing in outsiders. So this year there will be no invitations sent to women of other colleges. 
Stanford Hall President Bob Ryan said, "It was brought up before the Hall President's Council and was voted down because there 

But Keenan Hall President Bill Fallon stated, ''It was a good idea in previous years, but it has phased itself out." Donna Crowley, Farley Hall President, said, "I think most of the women at Notre Dame are glad it is not going to be held." 
Even though there will be no women guests brought in this year, there will still be a party on the North Quad, as in past years. Again this year the party will be held in the North Dining Hall. The 
North Quad halls, including St. Edwards, Cavanaugh and Lewis are sponsoring the party. Mem­bers of those halls will be admitted free, all others can pay a one dollar admission fee at the door. Music will be by "Flight." 
sored an Offering of Letters Drive to support a Right-to-Food Resolut­ion in Congress and sent four delegates to the National Univers­ity Conference on Hunger in Aus­tin, Texas. 
"Activities for this semester 
include a community education 
program to inform campus and 
South Bend communities about the 
problems of global injustice, a 
monthly newsletter and a monthly 
vegetarian meal," Prinster said. 
"The World Hunger Coalition is 
concerned not just with hunger, but 
with the problems of global poverty 
and injustices which cause hun­
ger," Prinster stated. 
Gardner guest 

artist for festival 
John Gardner, fiction-writer and medieval scholar, will complete the list of guest artists to appear at the Sophomore Literary Festival, SLF Chair Michelle Quinn announced yesterday. 
Gardner is the author of six novels as well as several textbooks and articles on medieval history. His critically acclaimed book Gren­del relates the story of Beowulf from the viewpoint of the hero's monster-antagonist. His novel The Sunlight Dialogues appeared for 14 weeks on the New York Times Best-Seller list. 
While still in graduate school, Gardner was awarded fellowships by the Woodrow Wilson and Dan­forth foundations. He held a Guggenheim Fellowship from 1970 to 1973 and has been honored by the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Gardner, who is currently teach­ing medieval English literature at Southern Illinois University-Car­bondale, will appear at the Festival Mon., February 16.

much the resentment by the wo­men at Notre Dame that brought l
the "Cattle Drive" to an end. "The event itself was a let-down. After a big build-up, the weekends were kind of anti-climatic.'' 
Before Notre Dame went co-edu­cational, as many as 900 women came for the Mardi Gras and the annual party each year. Originally the Office of Student Affairs ex­tended the invitations, but because of the controversy, it ended the practice two years ago. When Student Affairs ended its involve­ment, the extending of invitations became the prerogative of the halls. Last year only 350 women were asked to come, with the invitations being extended by Grace, Keenan, Stanford and Zahm residence halls.

Laissez Faire 
....iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiierrico ang i u oni 
In reply to Mr. Buchwald's article on the "Machiavelli Plan," I 
would like to elaborate on several key points. Despite the author's profound knowledge of international politics, in ridiculing the role of the CIA in Italian politics, he does present a distorted picture to most Americans, who know little about the present political situation. Therefore, in this article, I will present a realistic Italian perspective to clear some of the distortions. 
Obviously, the article's purpose is to ridicule politics and the CIA; however, it overlooks three important factors: the complex structure of the Italian political system, the Italian economy, and recent electoral behavior. When these factors are considered, one can see the impossibility of blocking the inevitable--a "historic compromise" between Communists and Christian Democrats. This compromise would give the Communists a role in the actual government, which they have not held in thirty years. Consequently, it is irrational to pour American tax payer's money towards a futile cause. 
Perhaps, the U.S. does not realize that the money given to the center parties, and to non-communist parties is never used for the urgent needs of social projects. The scandals in the government, as the Italians say, "disappear in the sand." This situation is worsened when the scandals coincide with hyperinflation, increasing unemployment and a nebulous economic future. These deficiencies have been caused by a lack of authority-authority that the Christian Democrats, because of their complex structure of dissenting factions, have not been able to provide. The leaders of the party have been around too long, and have been corrupted by power. Instead of pursuing the interests of the majority, they have pursued their own. If the Christian Democrats had done to themselves what they have done for the Italian people, they would realize the scoundrels they have been. The party is corrupt, and the Italian electorate is too intelligent, and too proud to resign themselves to a dishonest system. 
Since the mid-60's the Italian electorate has been moving toward the left. The need of change is imperative to solve Italy's economic, political and moral crisis. Once in the government, the Communists, with respected and responsible leaders, will provide a new and better leadership. Its disciplined and organized structure will bring the reforms needed. Therefore, a "historic compromise" is inevitable despite the no's of the U.S., the Church, and of industrial pressure groups.

i he plentiful nature in which the Indians lived not only provided their food, clothing and shelter, but also a god to worship. The Potawatomis, like many other Indian tribes were sun worshippers. They offered sacrifices to the sun, whom they believed to be the ruler of the world, and pleaded for protection, cures from sickness and safety from their enemies. One of their major feasts, the Feast of Dreams, consisted of the roasting and consumption of dog meat and the carrying out of various actions directed by their dreams. The Potawato­mis also practiced polygamy. 
In contrast to the easy going Potawato­mis, the Miamis were a sober and serious people, though friendly and polite. They lived in log houses roofed with rush mats, and the Miami social and political systems were quite strong. They were also known as tough adversaries in battle. 
The Miamis were very industrious and enterprising, traits not possessed by the Potawatomis. The Miamis were described as shrewd traders as well as fine trappers, and their Indian corn, maize, was consi­dered to be the most delectable among any of the tribes. 
The religion of the Miamis was orderly and simple, much the same as their daily lives. They worshipped the sun and the 
thunder, and their dead were interred in carved out log coffins or buried in the ground in tightly sealed log cabins built for that purpose. 
A brief lrlstory 
The history of the native American inhabitants of this area began thousands of years ago during the late prehistoric period, when Miamis began to wander down from their Wisconsin homes. These migrating Indians settled around the southern Mich and 


EDITOR'S NOTE: This Is a series of articles about the growth of Notre Dame and the American nadon. 
The early inhabitants of the present 
Michiana area were Indians and mission­
aries. The St. Joseph River comes down 
from the northeast, makes a sharp bend, 
and continues northwesterly for 30 miles, 
emptying into Lake Michigan. The "south 
bend" of the river provided a convenient 
stopping place for the Miami Indians. 
After Indiana was admitted to the Union 
in 1816, a series of treaties opened the 
teritory to American settlers eager to 
expand the western boundary of the United 
States. The Indians were being pushed farther away from their reservations. 
In 1823, Alexis Coquillard, a young Canadian, established a trading post in the area and called it South Bend. This new settlement attracted even more pioneers to South Bend. Indian Chief Pokagon appealed to his missionary friend Father Gabriel Richard of Detroit to send a priest to the village of South Bend in order to serve the religious needs of the Indians and to hopefully settle the disputes between the Indians and settlers. 
Stephen Theodore Badin was born in Orleans, France in 1768. In 1792, because of the French Revolution, he left the Sulpician seminary in France for America and became one of the first students at St. Mary's Seminarv in Baltimore, Maryland. 
tctc==;,Nnc:=:::Mw:l"l"==~wl" ,..,. 
He was ordained by aishop John Carroll on May 25, 1793, the first priest to be ordained in the United States. 
Father Badin had been described as small in stature. But what he lacked in physical size he made up in zeal, even in his later years. He was at Detroit at the time Chief Pokagon's request arrived, and Father Richard asked Badin to go. Badin accepted the challenge. At the age of 60, 


northern Indiana, thus by the time white men found them, they were firmly rooted in this area. 
Though there is certainly dispute, many historians believe that the famed Jesuit missionary Jacques Marquette was the first white man to view the Indian land around South Bend. In 1673 he passed up the Kankakee River and crossed the portage to the St. Joseph River on his way north after a journey among the Indians. Also, soon after Marquette in 1679, LaSalle discovered the mouth of the St. Joseph River on Lake Michigan and eventually established a fort there. 
In approximately 1680, the Jesuit mis­sionaries Frs. Allouez and Dablon estab­lished a mission on the banks of the St. Joseph River, about sixty miles up river from the mouth. This site is located about one mile north of the present city of Niles. Some time after the establishment of the mission, a fort, Ft. St. Joseph, was built by the French on the same high bluff overlookilng the river. Together, the fort and the mission became the center for commerce, French power and conversion of the Indians in the area. 
The next major event in the area was the departure of the Miamis in the early 1700's. They were driven southward into southwestern Indiana and southern Ohio by an alliance of several tribes, including the Potawatomis who had lived with them peacefully for nearly fifty years. The few Miamis presently living in the area did not return until the 1930's. 

In 17oJ, however, au abrupt ana permanent change occurred. The French and Indian war had broken out in 1756 and in 1760, Montreal was taken by the British, who in the articles of capitulation gained control of much of St. Joseph County. Thus the Indians lost their priests and were not to re_gain them until sixtv years later. 
After more than 100 years· of gradual scattering of the Indians remaining in the South Bend area, there remain today less than 1000 Miamis and Potawatomis com­
""' 
The original Mission of St. Joseph, as the South Bend area was called, was found approximately 150 years earlier by Jesuit 
missionaries and explorers. The famous 
French explorer, LaSalle, had also passed 
through the area about the same time. The 
new pastor ,Badin had to build upon this 
groundwork. 
Although Badin labored among the Indians and settlers, he had a strong desire to start a home for orphans scattered in the area between Fort Wayne and Chicago. He decided to purchase an enclave of 524 acres of land situated next to two lakes in the South Bend mission. He named this settlement St. Marie des Lacs 
At the time Father Badin made his purchase of land, he began to clear the forests and cultivate the land. He built his home on the southern shore of St. Mary's Lake, near the side of the present log cabin. His meager cabin was approximate­ly 35 feet long and 20 feet wide. He also built an all-purpose chapel nearby in order to meet the needs of the community. 
The strains of such labors were now affecting his health. In 1835, three years after he arrived at St. Joseph Mission, he transferred the title of the land he purchase, St. Marie des Lacs to the Bishop of Vincennes. He stipulated that an orphan asylum or some other charitable or religious institution be established upon the grounds. Badin then left for Cincinnati to rest. 

bined. There are approximately lOU Miamis living in the Darden and Hastings Roads vicinity and nearly 800 Potawatomis throughout southern Michigan and nor­thern Indiana. Because many of them are intermarried and there is no formal reservation, the tribal structure is practi­cally nonexistent. 
The culture once so rich and colorful is now disintegrated and lost to the point where most of the Indians can no longer speak their native language. 
Joseph Winchester, who is the president of the Potawatomi Indians of Michigan and Indiana, commented on the present danger of losing the language completely: ''There are not too many people left that ~eak fluently," he said. "We eventually hopt!'to bring in some older people to teach the youngsters." 
Among the Miamis the loss of culture is "spectacular", according to Dave Albert, a South Bend attorney who has been involved with the Indian community for several years. "Many of them could not even be recognized as Indians anymore," he remarked. 
Albert, who now advises and helps the Miamis run their small neighborhood center, noted that the Indians are trying to recover some of their tribal culture, but they have not been too organized in their c.:fforts. A 24ft. by 24ft. renovated garage, which serves as the community center, is the central focus of the effort to revive culture. Headwork classes are presently offered at the center, along wtth adult education and other crafts. 
Besides the loss of culture, other prob­lems also confront the area Indians. Alc!>holism and social disintegration beset the ancestors of the once strong Miamis. 
Social disintegration has resulted from tremendous outside pressure, according to Albert. The old morals were shattered and no new ones were formed to replace them because the tribe was scattered. Tradi­tional Indian society can be extremely disciplined. Older people, however, must be able to control the young, according to Albert, and the tight tribal unity needed for this is not present anymore. 
In the old society everyone grew up together and thus knew what was expected of them, Albert explained. Today, however, with the great transfer to the 
suburb!>, this element is gone. 
The cultural loss and social problems besetting the Miami and Potawatomi Indians today are merely the end product of an inevitable process--the advance of civifization. The Indians, natu;·aJ inhabi­tants of the 'forests which once stood in place of South Bend, are no longer in an environment' conductive to many of their cultural traits. Whether rightly or wrongfy, they have. lost much of their heritage and land and are now part of a society alien to 
much of their past.

The St. Joseph Mission seemed to flounder after Father Badin's departure. Father De Seille, the immediate successor, died only 2 years later in 1837. In 1838, the United States government decided to remove the last Indians from their homes in Indiana to new reservations in Kansas. Father Petit, the second successor to Father Badin, decided to leave St. Joseph Mission and accompany his beloved Ind­ians on their journey to their new homes many miles away. He died shortly thereaf­ter in St. Louis. The remains of the two successors to Father Badin are in the crypt of Sacred Heart Church. A void now seemed present in this once promising mission. 
It was at this time that the Bishop of Vincennes, Bishop Brute, sent Father Heillandiere, an assistant, to Europe to gQt additional clergymen for the diocese. In France Hartlandiere secured the good will of the newly organized Society of Holy Cross at Le Mains. Father Edward Sorin was chosen to lead a small group of missionaries to serve in the Vincennes Diocese. They would continue the work of Father Badin. They would build Notre Dame.

Grounds explained the GSU's fiscal conservatism in terms of the organization's plans for the future, particularly in regard to the Advanced Students' Commons to be opened in the Aquinas Book Store in the fall.

The Thursday meeting also includ­ed a report from Don Roy, GSU vice-president and representative to the Academic Council, on the ·recent calendar decision, which he characterized as "a victory for the students and for good sense.''

Roy went on to note that, "It would be an unfortunate as well as a questionable tactic to use the calendar to enforce attendance during Thanb.giving week." 
The meeting also included dis­cussion of plans for the new Advanced Students' Commons and of the possibility of sponsoring a film on assertiveness for women. A final decision on the film was deferred to a later m

Student Government elections are scheduled for Feb. 23 and 25, announced Pete Gottsacker, chair­man of the Election Committee. 
Officers to be elected are the Student Body president, vice pres­ident, and the three representa­tives for the Student Life Council from the North and South Quads and off-campus. The president and vice president will be elected together on one ticket.

The Ombudsman service will be running the balloting procedure. 
Because the existence of the SLC was in doubt last spring, elections were not held then. Since that time, the SLC has been revised and elections were then held last Oct­ober, explained Gottsacher. SLC elections will now be held at the regular election period. 
The Election Committee plans to organize a series of caucuses and debates in the residence halls. If any hall is interested in sponsoring debates during either the primary or run-off periods they should contact Gottsacker or committee members Jim Cawley and Jim O'Connell. 
Student Body President Ed Byrne said that his office will be open at any time for candidates to inquire about the duties of the office. Any questions about the election should be referred to Pete Gottsacker. Any candidates for the SLC can take their questions to present SLC members Ed van Tassel of the North Quad, John Salveson of the South Quad, and John Lynch of off-campus. Further information concerning elections will be forthcoming from the Elec­tion Committee. 
Gottsacker pointed out that act­ion by the committee has been hampered by the fact that the proposals of the COUL Report are still undecided.
