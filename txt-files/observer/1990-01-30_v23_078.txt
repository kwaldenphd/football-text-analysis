cumstances. 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi­dent Bush on Monday sent Congress a $1.23 trillion budget for fiscal 1991 that keeps new spending below inflation and recognizes "remarkable changes" in the world by scal­ing back defense and rewarding emerging democracies. 
Bush called the spending plan an "investment in the future," but Democrats in Congress pounced on it as not bold enough on defense cuts and too harsh on social programs. They also disputed the presi­dent's contention that his bud­get would halve the deficit, to $63.1 billion, saying its eco­nomic assumptions were too optimistic. 
"This is a take-two-aspirin and call-me-in-the-morning budget," said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.. chairman of the House Budget Committee, which opens hearings on the new budget on Tuesday. 
Fights loomed with the Democratic-controlled Congress on a range of fronts: Bush's desire to cut Medicare and capital gains taxes, to close military bases he consid­
and those vying for the same tenure, in cases where sexual or racial discrimination has been charged, according to Jus­tice Harry Blackmun's majority opinion in the case University of Pennsylvania v. Equal Em­ployment Opportunity Commis­sion (Jan. 9, 1990). 
The University of Pennsylva­nia, in denying the release of confidential peer review mate­rials, sought to require the Commission to prove a particu­lar necessity of access, beyond relevance, before the materials would be disclosed. 
sive weapons. 
Bush would increase spending on space, education, the envi­ronment and the war on drugs. Losers, this year, are Medicare, college student loans, farm subsidies, energy conservation and mass transit. 
The president's budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 calls for $36.5 billion in spending cuts and other deficit­reduction measures. 
It projects a 7 percent in­crease in revenues, to $1.17 trillion, without a general tax increase and just a 3 percent boost in overall spending ­more than a percentage point below the current rate of infla­tion. 
Bush proposed defense spending of $292.1 billion, a cut of 2 percent measured against inflation; while boost­ing foreign aid to Eastern Eu-­rope, the Philippines and Latin America. 
On the domestic front, his 
budget would leave in place the

An important part of the fi­
nancial aid process is the deliv­
ery system, according to Direc­
tor of Financial Aid Joe Russo. 
The delivery system is the 
process of "students applying 
for aid, being reviewed for it, 
and eventually getting the funds 
for which he or she applied," 
Russo said. 
"Such a process typically could take months, and for 1Notre Dame students it begins 
now," he said. 
Notre Dame's process, unlike 
many colleges', does not require 
a separate institutional 
application. The financial aid 
office, however, does reserve 
the right to request additional

The process begins by first filling out and turning in the application. "An analysis with a figure at the bottom, which is a preliminary estimate of sup­posedly what a family can af­ford, is sent to the financial aid office from the College Scholar­ship Service (CSS). 
"The government receives data from the agency (CSS) and · sends it back to that initial agency with an okay. The CSS then sends a Student Aid Report (SAR) to the student," Russo said. 
Then a decision is made and the student told of it. The deci­sion often requires completing

Beware perils of doing laundry off campus 
SincP. the UnivP.rsity so gmwrously hiked --------­
up the price of doing laundry on campus, my roommates and I have been postponing doing thP. mammoth job. 
Noticing that my 
dirty laundry had 
been growing like the Janice O'Leary 
federal budget delieit, Assistant News Editor 
I became determined 
to do it this weekP.nd. --------­
Being thP. cheapskates that we are, my 
roommate Betsy and I decided to go into 
South Bend and save 15 cents per load. 
Our excursion to the laundromat became 
quite an adventure. 
There we stood, amongst several people 
who looked as if they hadn't yet heard of 
the comb, in our last pairs of clean 
undt~rwear, at a total loss. 
We had finished putting all of our darks 
into one of those huge industrial washers 
(the kind big enough to put your bratty little 
cousin in) and we couldn't figure out how to 
put the detergent in. 
After observing one person of indetermi­
nate gender, we found the little hatch you 
pour the stuff through on the top. Pretty 
neat. 
Well, after awhile we began to think we 
were quite the laundromat experts, and we 
were saving money. Until the dryer incident. 
that is. 
We finished loading every article of 
clothing into the big industrial dryer 
(probably large enough for two bratty 
cousins), shut the round glass door, put the 
quarter in and realized we had committed 
the cardinal sin of dryer sins: we forgot the 
fabric softener. 
Now there was no stop button and this 
thing was filled with clothes, and I do mean 
lilted. 
I low were we supposed to put the stupid 
sheet inside without all our elothes Oying 
out? With my luck, it would probably be my 
sexiest underwear that would take to the 
air. 
Well, we had to risk it. Sure enough, half 
the contents new right out. Feeling like the 
complete idiots we look11d like we did what 
anyone else in our situation would do. 
We laughed our heads off. 
Meanwhile, little did we know that a small tornado had been brewing while we were inside. 
As soon as we took all of our clean dothes out to the car, pants and shirts and socks began to whirl around the parking lot. 
Hepeating our past performance, we began to laugh hysterically. 
As Betsy said, we felt like "Laverne and Shirley." Better that than Lenny and Squiggy, I guess. 
Our adventure finally came to an end. I am proud to say that we gained much in the way of laundromat wisdom. And we saved five bucks!

Foreign study students may vote in future elections 
By SANDRA WIEGAND 
News Writer 
Overseas elections of Presi­dentiaVYice Presidential and Senatorial officers for Notre Dame are feasible according to the Student Senate, and at­tempts will be made to allow students participating in over­seas programs to vote in the future. 
Such elections were conducted twice in the past. and a number of problems came up which caused some senators to doubt their practicality. Lack of ac­cess to information regarding candidates has been prominent in the past, according to senate members, since the students could not meet the candidates or attend their debates. 
The cost of providing stu­dents in foreign countries with information is also high, espe­cially since some locations did not have access to facsimile machines in the past and had to be reached through Federal Express. 
Time constraints, especially in the event of a run-off, could also be a problem, since the amount of time between the two elections is generally very short. 
The majority of senate mem­
bers felt that these problems 
could be overcome. or that an 
attempt should at least be 
made to allow all Notre Dame 
students to vote. Also, some 
members felt that past elections 
had been conducted poorly or 
were not well prepared for be­
fore they were r.arried out.

The election for student body president and vice-president will be held on Monday, Feb. 
12. The guidelines for running for these positions are as fol­lows: 
Candidates representing five tickets are required to submit petitions containing signatures of at least 150 students to the Election Committee office by 5 
p.m.. Wednesday, Jan. 31. Campaigning will begin on Monday, Feb.S, at midnight and end on Monday, Feb. 12, at midnight. No campaigning is allowed before or after this period. 
If no candidate receives 50% of the total vote in the first election, then there will be a run-off election on Wednesday, Feb. 14, between the top two vote-getters. 
There 
is a $125 campaign spending limit for all tickets. Fines will be imposed for any campaign rule violations. 

Campaign 
rules specify proper locations of campaign­ing, placement and size of cam­paign posters, methods of ob­taining endorsements, and gen­eral standards of ethical behavior expected of the candidates. They also cover the permissability of using some extraordinary methods of campaigning. 


According to the official con­stitution of the undergraduate student body, "no skywriting, airplane banners, or moving sound trucks are allowed" in the campaign. These are all methods which have been used in the past, according to Tom Rask, chairman of the Election Committee. 
ND civil engineer looks into the cost of highway safety 
By JOHANNA KELL V News Writer 
James Taylor. associate dean of the college of engineering and a civil engineer, is currently investigating the trade-off highway engineers often face between allocation of public funds and reductions in high­way fatalities, injuries, and property damage. 
"This is an area I've been in­terested in for some time," he said. 
Taylor explained that there are at least forty to fifty thou­sand highway fatalities each year, and it is the duty of high­way engineers to reduce these figures. 
Engineers often overlook the projected number of lives that could be saved when consider­ing a project because of the funds involved, Taylor said. Sometimes individual highway deaths or injuries take priority over the general population. 
"We know that people will be killed yet we are not willing to spend the money," he said. 
Taylor has written several ar­ticles on his theories concerning highway safety and hopes to someday be able to advise highway departments. 

"I hope to try and see how people make these decisions and try to explain the inconsis­tencies in the way we approach them as a society, as individu­als, and as we approach the victim," he said. 
Taylor has had an ongoing interest in studying the contra­dictions in his profession and had the opportunity to attend a two week course on philosophy and ethics in engineering. 
"Engineers are not well­trained in philosophy," Taylor said, "so this is a special inter­est of mine." 
Taylor joined the Notre Dame 
faculty in 1976 as chairman of 
the Department of Civil Engi­
neering. 
Taylor has had extensive background in engineering and transportation. Before coming to Notre Dame, Taylor taught and researched highway safety as the Director of Highway 
Traffic at the Pennsylvania 
State University. He also 
served as head of the Traffic 
Operations and Design Division 
of the Pennsylvania "Trans­
portation Institute.

As we enter a new decade, the Office of Campus Ministry is happy to offer two programs which celebrate marriage and family life. 
First, for married couples seeking to grow in love and understanding of their relationship, we are offering again this semester our program entitled ENRICH. This is a two part workshop which uses a marriage inventory of 125 statements to help couples understand their particular strengths and work areas. The first session will take place on February 11th at 2pm when the inventory will be explained in detail and couples will fill it out individually. The second session will take place on several dates in the following months when the couples will receive the results of their inventory, a written explanation and some private time to discuss their results together. Pre-registration is required and can be accomplished by calling the Badin Office at 239-5242. 
The second program, LIVING FAITH IN THE FAMILY, takes place on three Sundays this semester at the Center for Continuing Education and is designed to explore issues of faith which affect families of all kinds. 
The first presenters on February 4th will by Jim and Kathy .McGinnis, from the international organization Parenting for Peace and Justice. Their topic is "Nurturing Children in a World of Conflict"."' As pa~ts and teachers, we are all concerned to help children develop to their fullest potential, which is not an easy task in our world fraught with conflict. This program will increase our understanding of how forces like violence, discrimination and materialism affect children and will explore ways as families to resist these forces. -This program is co-sponsored with the Center for Sodal Co~~eem. and the Institute for lntemational Peace Stu..n. 
Part two of this Sunday series will be held on March 4th when Dr. Keith Egan from St. Mary's Center for Spirituality will speak on the topic of Spirituality of the Home. Dr. Egan believes that to live fully we need sacred places--lakes, mountains, woods and at other times, a church, a synagogue, a mosque. But too often our homes are divorced form our sacred spaces. This program will explore the capacity of the home to nurture a deeply spiritual life for the traditional family, for those who share a home, and for those who live alone. 
The final presentation in this series takes place on March 25th, when Dr. Elaine Ramshaw will speak on Family Rituals. This program will first look at rituals from our families of origin to see the relationship between rituals and the family system. It will also look at our present households to discover the rituals and celebrations which already exist and then discuss ways to enrich family life by adapting and creating ritual patterns tailored to each family's unique life. 
Childcare will be available for all of the above programs and will include activities appropriate for different age groups. Childcare must be registered for one week in advance of the program you wish to attend. 
To register for ENR.ICH or for childcare for any of the programs please call the Campus Ministry Office: 239-5242. If you have any questions about the programs, please ask for Tracey Sandman or Carol Guenther.

Battle rages over how to spend peace dividend 


WASIIINGTON (AP) -The 
battle between Congress and 
the Bush administration over 
how to divvy up the "peace div­
idend" could make the Cold 
War look like a Sunday school 
picnic. 
The sniping began in earnest Monday with delivery of Presi­dent Bush's 1991 budget re­quest to Congress and will likely continue for several years as U.S. policy makers try to adjust to a new world symbol­ized by the crumbling of the Berlin Wall. 
The central questions revolve around the magnitude of de­fense savings made possible from lessened East-West ten­sions -and which programs will receive additional funds as a result. 
At present, there is nothing approaching a consensus on the answers to either of those questions. 
The administration says there won't be much of a peace divi­dend at all. particularly given the huge budget deficit. Many Democrats will respond tiy try­ing to reduce Bush's Pentagon blueprint, freeing additional dollars for social programs. 
Budget Director Richard Darman, in an essay accompa­nying the budget, accused Democrats of trivializing the issue and turning the entire de­bate into a game in which each player wildly overestimates the dividend and then comes up with different ways to spend it. 
"Thus, Washington entertains the notion of spending fifty times a dividend that has not yet definitively materialized -a true Wonderland phenomenon," Darman wrote. 
But House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri immediately countered that lawmakers would seek "greater cuts in defense, not having to cut so deeply on th~_domestic" side of the budget. 
What Darman doesn't say is that the administration is largely to blame for raising ex­pectations about the peace div­idend in the first place. 
Defense Secretary Richard Cheney announced last Novem­ber that he was searching for Pentagon cuts totaling $180 billion over the next six years. However, Cheney was calculat­ing his savings against an ad­ministration plan projecting a buildup in defense forces that Congress had already rejected. 
Thus. the actual savings will be far less. 
No one disputes that there will savings, but the scale of the windfall will be much more few years. 
In 1991, for example, the administration's new budget puts the "peace dividend" at $3.2 billion. That figure is ar­rived at by comparing what the administration is seeking in to­tal military outlays, $303.3 bil­lion, compared to the $306.4 billion that would be required to let the Pentagon keep pace with inflation. 
The $3.2 billion figure left Democrats definitely unim­pressed, with many accusing Darman of playing his own political game by proposing steep cuts in military personnel, t:oupled with a whole new round of base closings, while protecting the administration's pet multibillion-dollar weapons programs. 
Democratic leaders left no doubt that they would be look­ing for deeper cuts in some of the weapons programs favored money for everything from cleaning up the environment to taking care of the disadvan­taged and rebuilding America's crumbling road and bridge sys­tem.

Democrats attack Bush budget

FRESHMEN SOPHOMORE YEAR AN INFORMATIONAL PROGRAM 
by 
EMIL T. HOFMAN DEAN OF THE FRESHMAN YEAR OF STUDIES in the ENGINEERING (CUSHING) AUDITORIUM TUESDAY, JANUARY 30,1990 7 P.M. and WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 31, 1990 7.P.M. (Both programs will be the same. Every freshman should plao to attend one.) FRESHMEN FRESHMEN FRESHMEN 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Con­gressional Democrats attacked President Bush's 1991 budget on all fronts Monday, calling the $1.23 trillion spending plan too soft on the Pentagon, too harsh on domestic programs and too reliant on rosy eco­nomic projections. 
Republicans leaped to Bush's defense, even though many of them had to concede that parts of the president's proposal would never be enacted and that the budget year likely would be a tough one. 
"I wouldn't be surprised if we were unable to reach agreement up here this year," Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the Senate Budget Committee's ranking Republican, conceded to reporters. 
In a preview of a theme likely to dominate the year's Capitol Hill fiscal wars, majority Democrats pounced on Bush's call to spend $303.3 billion for overall defense spending. 
Budget

pose no general tax increase. 
Still, the budget recommends $15.6 billion in lesser tax in­creases and a $5.6 billion in­crease in user and service fees 

That figure -a 2 percent cut from this year's $296.3 billion when compared to the costs of inflation -was derided by many Democrats as being too generous to the military at a time of easing tensions with the Soviet bloc. 
"It is becoming apparent that if there is to be a peace dividend that amounts to anything, this Congress is going to have to carve it out," complained Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D­Tenn. "You'd think Joe Stalin had come back and entrenched himself in the Kremlin." 
"It is a Rip Van Winkle bud­get that has not yet awakened to the changes in the world or the major challenges at homes," said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. 
Yet noticeably lacking was the phrase that became the re­flexive reaction among Democrats to many of the bud­gets that President Reagan sent 
-most of them recycled from Reagan budgets and previously defeated in Congress. 
The budget calls for "family savings" accounts under which families could bank up to $5,000 a year and pay no tax on interest on deposits held for seven or more years. 
the lawmakers: "Dead on ar­rival." 
"I think we'll take it very se­riously," said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D­Mo. 
But like other members of his party, Gephardt called the spending blueprint a "stand­pat budget" that fails to seri­ously address many of the na­tion's problems. 
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., lauded Bush's proposals to boost spending on the Head Start preschool pro­gram for low-income children by $500 million to $1.9 billion. But he chided the president for offering overall education in­creases -to $24.6 billion ­that fail to keep abreast of in­flation, and for cutting heating bill subsidies to the poor. 
"A budget should make a statement about a nation's pri­orities and aspirations," Byrd said. 
"With an eye toward future growth, and expansion of the human frontier, the budget's chief emphasis is on investment in the future," Bush said in a brief message to Congress ac­companying the 1,569-page document. 
But Sen. James Sasser, D­Tenn., called it a document of "low aspirations.... It predicts huge fiscal problems ahead and then goes on to propose no change in course." 
And House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said, "I think it's a standpat budget" but he said lawmakers would "take it very seriously" rather than pronouncing it "dead on arrival" as Democrats had done with several Reagan bud­gets. 
Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, opened the annual budget battle by proposing a truce. "We fully expect to negotiate with Congress over priorities," he told a briefing. 
But Sen. Pete Domenici, R­Ariz., senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said that getting a budget agree­ment this year would be tough. "It's not child's play," he said. 
And House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said "obviously the (Democratic) majority has a little bit differ­ent idea of where the priorities 
ought· to be ... Hopefully, we'll 
just get it done on time." 
Bush's budget asserted it was 
meeting the $64 billion deficit 
target for fiscal 1991, under 
the Gramm-Rudman budget 
balancing law, "with specific 
and defensible measures -and 
without gimmicks." 
However, critics claimed the 
administration's prescription 
for getting the budget deficit 
down to $63.1 billion-from a 
projected $123. 8 billion this 
year -does rely on accounting 
gimmicks. 
"They continue to jimmy the 
figures," said Sen. Ernest 
Hollings, D-S.C. "It's another 
fraud." 
For one thing, Bush's budget uses an optimistic, set of eco­nomic projectioru; that assume both declining interest rates and falling inflation. The bud­get also calls for overall growth this year of 2.4 percent this year -compared to the 
1.7 percent forecast by private forecasters and the Congres­sional Budget Office. 
Tpe government's most re-· cent figures showed economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 0.5 percent during the last three months of 1989.

E. Germany arrests former leader Honecker for treason 
EAST BERLIN (AP) -Erich Honecker, who ruled East Ger­many for 18 years until his downfall in October, was ar­rested immediately after his re­lease from a hospital Monday and will be tried for treason, the national prosecutor said. 
Plans to put the former Communist Party chief and three members of his Politburo on trial in March were an­nounced by Prosecutor Hans-

a student loan application. Lenders for loans are "selected very carefully at Notre Dame. The loans are provided through these lenders, and then various credits are put on a students account or a job is assigned, or both," said Russo. 
One of the major problems facing financial assistan.ce ap­plicants is the complexity of the Financial Aid Form (FAF). 
As many students may have Juergen Joseph at a session of Parliament, where Premier Hans Modrow offered a grim account of the state of the na­tion. 
The swift action against Ho­necker, 77, indicates the strength of a nationwide back­lash against corruption in his Stalinist regime. 
Economic problems and widespread unrest have forced Modrow, the embattled Com-
already noticed, Congress tried to remedy this problem by changing the 1990-91 FAF. Some families are now only re­quired to. complete the first half of the document. The reason for this is that families on pub­lic assistance have no need to respond to additional ques­tions. 
The financial aid office ad­vises that students complete the entire FAF, and not stop halfway. 
"This truncated application would serve such families very well," Russo said, "However, munist premier, to move the country's first free elections up from May to March 18 and bring the opposition into a coalition that will govern until then. 
In Washington, State De­partment Richard Boucher said: "They seem to have accel­erated the schedule in order to move quickly to a more stable, more long-term regime that's based on the popular will. 
the form has to serve a multiple purpose-for all levels of finan­cial circumstances." 
This is one of the reasons Notre Dame chooses to use the FAF over other forms of finan­cial aid applications. Many stu­dents' circumstances are very complex and that is not always evident on some applications. 
There are a number of finan­
cial aid forms available 
throughout the country, some 
more widely used than others. 
The most frequently used appli­

The CSS was created in the 1950s as an arm of the College Board. There is an $8.7 5 fee to send the FAF to a college. 
In the late 1960s the Ameri­can College Testing board de­veloped the Family Financial Statement (FFS), a different version of the FAF which Notre Dame does not use. 
According to Russo, this ap­plication is "overly simplistic and doesn't fulfill the needs of Notre Dame students."

"If you live in Indiana," Russo added, " there is a different fi­nancial aid application." 
Students are asked to please remember to file the Indiana version only if they are an Indi­ana resident. 
The Notre Dame financial aid office has mailed either the FAF or the Indiana version to all students on campus who will be applying for aid.

The EEOC argued that those documents were essential in de­termining whether or not Tung's charges were valid. 
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit became involved when Pennsylvania further de­clined the EEOC's initial re­quests and subpoena. The court decided the University could not force the Commission to prove need, beyond relevance, to ob­tain the files. 
"Clearly, an alleged perpetra­tor of discrimination cannot be allowed to pick and choose the evidence which may be neces­sary for an agency investiga­tion," the Third Circuit Court said in EEOC v. Franklin and

Marshall College, a similar case. 
"Likewise, confidential mate­rial pertaining to other candi­dates for tenure in a similar time frame may demonstrate that persons with lesser qualifi­cations were granted tenure or that sof!le pattern of discrimi­nation occurs." 
The case reached the Supreme Court because of what could have been determined as a "conflict in approach" with a previous Seventh Circuit deci­sion. That 1983 decision al­lowed the University of Notre Dame to edit out identifying features, such as names and professional honors. before producing personal Iiles sought by the EEOC for a similar case (EEOC v University of Notre Dame du Lac 1983) 
The University of Pennsylva­nia's claim of academic free­dom was denied by the Court, who noted that Congress' Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 extended Title VII, pro­viding the EEOC with subpoena power, and did not create a privilege for peer review docu­ments. 
The result made educational institutions subject to the same procedures as other employ­ment decisions. 
"We stand behind the break­water Congress has established: unless specifically provided otherwise in the statute, the EEOC may obtain 'relevant' evi­dence," said Blackmun in the Court's decision.

Monty Williams (8.4 ppg1 and Tim Singleton (5.3 ppg and 76 total assists) round out the starting five for Notre Dame. 
The Irish looked impressive in big wins over Wichita State and Miami (Fla.) last week. Everything finally clicked in those games for Notre Dame, and Phelps hopes that carries over into the three-game road stretch that begins Sunday at Duke and includes meetings with Southern Methodist and Houston. 
"I think the most important 

thing for them is to stay in a positive frame of mind," Phelps said. "The students can get us every win at home. They have to keep this place like a zoo. We'll see it at Duke, and that's what we need here."

ENCINO, Calif. (AP) -New York Mets star Darryl Strawberry was arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon last week after allegedly threatening his wife with a pistol, police said Monday. 
Strawberry was arrested at his home in Encino and spent a "very short time" in jail at the West Valley station early Friday morning, Sgt. Woody Baca said. 
Los Angeles Police Cmdr. William Booth said Strawberry posted $12,000 bail "and is back with his wife." 
"It was very basic type stuff, a family dispute," Booth said. 
Baca read a police statement that said West Valley officers were called to the Strawberry home at 3:45 a.m. after a re­port of "domestic violence." Lisa Strawberry, 25, said she and her husband had argued and that Darryl, 27, hit her in the face with an open hand, the statement said. 
According to the report, Lisa grabbed a metal rod and hit Strawberry in the ribs and wrist. Lisa alleged Strawberry got a handgun and threatened her, the report said. 
A .25-caliber semi-automatic pistol registered to Lisa was found in the house, police said. The statement said Lisa showed "no visible injury" and that Strawberry had bruises on ribcage and wrist. 
"There was a pistol in the house. I don't remember all of the circumstances," Booth said. 
"He was taken into custody because there was a dispute. We have prima facie evidence that he had violated the law," Booth said. 
Booth said he did not know whether a court date had been set on the assault charge. An investigation by West Valley officers is continuing, police said. 
Strawberry and his wife were separated in 1987. She has al­leged in the past that he has hit her. 
Last Wednesday, blood tests established that Strawberry was the father of a child born in 1988 to a woman in St. Louis. Strawberry did not con­test the finding and a judge in St. Louis County Circuit Court took under study the amount of child support the All-Star out­fielder is to pay. 
Strawberry lives in an afnu­ent suburb of the San Fernando Valley where celebrities such as Michael Jackson and Steve Allen reside, lies about 20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

Siegfried boasts unbeaten teams I

By THERESA KELLY Sports Editor 
Siegfried Hall is undefeated in women's interhall action, with the A-team leading the A1 League with a 4-0 record, and the B-team holding the same spot and the same record in the B-league. 
In the A2 League, Lewis re­mains undefeated with a 3-0 record, but faces its toughest challenge of the season in the upcoming grudge match with Pasquerilla East, especially if the Pasquerilla team can get its running game in gear. 
In action before break, the 
Chickens slowed the game down 
with a press and Lewis and P.E. 
played through a vicious defen­
sive struggle. Lewis emerged 
with the hard-fought victory 
19-10 after four 8-minute-run­
ning quarters. 
"It was really tough," said 
Lewis captain Jill Beth Hayes. 
"We were excited to win, be­
cause they have a lot of very 
good athletes. We just had to 
get on them defensively, and the 
game was very, very physical."

"Lewis is the most intense ri­valry we have now," said P.E. standout Molly Mahoney. "Their press was our demise. We just couldn't handle it. The press killed us last year, and it's the albatross around our necks this year." 
Lewis is getting help from talented freshmen, including Kim Thonton and Kelly McDonough, but Hayes says the entire league is benefitting from new faces. 
"The competition we've seen is a lot tougher this year," Hayes said, "because there are many good freshmen coming in. They are helping us out a lot. Some other teams have some former basketball walkons, and some of the volleyball players are in it now, too, and that makes the competition even better." 
P.E. is second in the A2 League at 3-1, followed by Knott and Howard at 1-2 and Walsh at 0-3. 
"So far, I've seen a lot of physical teams," Mahoney said. "We're physical, but what sets us apart is quickness. We're

Syracuse holds off St. John's; Hawkeyes down Illinois 
NEW YORK (AP) -Billy Owens and Stephen Thompson each scored 22 points and had Syracuse's final field goals of the game as the seventh-ranked Orangemen held off No. 18 St. John's 70-65 on Monday night. 
Syracuse (15-3, 6-3) never trailed in the game but couldn't put the Redmen away. The Or­angemen did knock St. John's (17 -5, 6-3) from a first-place tie with Connecticut in the Big East. 
St. John's got within 61-59 with 4:05 to play when Mailk Sealy made one of two free throws. 
Syracuse's Derrick Coleman, who finished with seven points, 11 below his average, then made one free throw -his only point of a foul-plagued second half-with 3:24 to play. 
Fifty-eight seconds later, Owens hit a driving bank shot with 12 seconds left on the 45­second shot clock for a 64-59 lead. Sealy, who finished with 16 points, made two free throws with 2:01 to get St. John's within 64-61.

Thompson then made a three­point play as he went low and nailed a layup as he was fouled by Billy Singleton. That was Syracuse's last field goal of the game and just its third in the 
. final 8:56 of the game.

tributes for granted," says Paddock. 
Paddock's main physical at­tribute is his size, and he uses it to his advantage on the basket­ball court. At 6 feet, 9 inches and 245 pounds, Paddock is hard for opposing centers to move once he establishes posi­tion inside. Consequently he is an excellent rebounder. 
"Scott's size and strength, when he uses it the right way, help him muscle inside and make things happen. He's very limited offensively, and I think he knows that and everybody knows that, but when he plays like he did the other night (against Wichita-State this past Wednesday), he gets 13 points and 12 rebounds," says Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps. 
Indeed, Paddock had perhaps the best game of his career against the Shockers when Keith Robinson got himself into early foul trouble. Paddock came off the bench to spark the Irish with two shattering dunks and a blocked shot en route to tying his career highs in both points and rebounds. 
And the fans, particularly a girl named Tess Fahey, cheered him on wholeheartedly.

over No. 11 Illinois Monday night. 
Iowa, which had lost seven of its last eight games, improved to 10-8 overall and 2-6 in the Big Ten. Illinois, which has dropped 21 of the last 24 games at Carver-Hawkeye Arena, fell to 15-4, 5-4. 
Jepsen's layup down the right side capped a rally that saw Iowa erase a 46-37 Illinois lead with a 12-2 run and grab a 49­48 lead with 12:14 remaining. 
Illinois' Marcus Liberty scored eight straight points as 

the Illini opened a 56-52 edge· with 7:45 left. James Moses' basket brought Iowa back to within 58-56, but a basket by Irvin Small and a 3-point shot by Steve Bardo put Illinois back on top 65-58 with 3:21 remain­ing. 
Liberty scored the last Illinois basket of the game with 1:44 left and Iowa chipped away at the lead, with Jepsen and Matt Bullard scoring from close range, followed by four straight points by James Moses. 
"Tess hasn't missed a Notre Dame basketball game in 8 years, and she always adopts a player who comes in the pro­gram. I was fortunate enough to be the one that she picked, and we've come to grow close to each other," says Paddock. 
Paddock realizes that he is not a tremendous scoring threat on the court. Because of this, he is very conscious of finding the open man when he gets the ball. This often results in an easy basket for his team­mates, such as the dunk Paddock fed sophomore Keith Tower for this past Saturday against Miami. 
Paddock has been making plans for after graduation, and he credits Phelps for helping take advantage of every oppor­tunity. He realizes his chances of playing basketball profes­sionally are limited, so he is ex­ploring his alternatives. 

"Coach Phelps emphasizes being prepared for when your basketball career is over," says Paddock, "He requires us (the 
seniors) to have two job inter­views before we are allowed to start practice. As a result of that, I've been interviewing a lot this semester, and I had a chance Thursday, when he let .ae miss practice, to go to Chicago to meet with some rep­resentatives from a firm there called McMaster/Carr, and I was offered the job." 
Says Phelps, "I think there's something after basketball (for my players), and I don't want basketball to dominate their lives while they're here. I think Scott typifies what we try to do with our student-athletes." 
And as a person who has spent a lot of time helping others, Paddock feels Notre Dame is a place with a very special feeling. 
"Many people say that there is a feeling about Notre Dame that you can't describe," says Paddock, "Well I think you can. Over the years I've come to know a lot of tremendous peo­ple associated with the University, and it's just the people around the University and the South Bend community who make it what it is."

Arkansas continues to gain ground in college hoops' poll 
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP)­Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson told his Razorbacks last week that if they won their next five games, they'd be ranked in the top five. 
This week, he has a new mes­sage. 
Arkansas beat Houston and Texas in Fayetteville last week, then went on the road and knocked off Alabama­Birmingham. On Monday, the Razorbaeks climbed from sixth to third, their highest ranking since they were No. 1 for one week in 1978. 
"Now, I'm telling them that if we win our next four games, we could be No. 1," Richardson said. 
lnterhall basketball action heats up 
By RICHARD MATHURIN 
Sports Writer 
The men's lnterhall basket­

ball season is in full swing 
again. 
The A division. has been split 

up into three conferences, all 
with strong teams to contend 
for the title. 
The program is run by Tim Sullivan of Non-Varsity Athletics, who sides as a player for the Flanner A-2 team. He says that every team will play each team in its conference once, but there will be no inter­conference play until the play­offs. The two top teams in each conference will qualify for the playoffs making a total of six playoff teams. 
The strongest conference appears to be the ACC which features defending champion Morrisey A-1 (3-0). They will be tested by Sorin (3-0) and Dillon (2-0). Morrisey A-I seems to be the general favorite of the cap­tains of the other squads. They are led by slam dunk contest champion Dorsey Levins, who is also known for his talents on the football field. Their team from last year was split up to form another Morrsey team, but Morrisey A-1 retained the starting players. 
"We need to play good hard defense to compete with them," says Sorin captain Tom Zidar, referring to his teams upcoming game with Morrisey A-1 on Feb. 7. His team is led by freshman Eric Jones, who also plays football. 
Dillon also has an impor­tant matchup with Morrisey A­1 on Jan. 31. Captain Mark Granger feels that his team will have to "keep the score low and rebound with them because we have a young team with four freshmen and three sopho­mores." He'll look to junior Jim Ellis and freshman Mike Livingston for big games if they hope to defeat the champions. 
In the Big 10 Conference, the other half of the Morrisey split squad, Morrisey A-2 (4-0) leads the division. Despite los­ing starter Jim Toohey to transfer, Morrsey A-2 remains the onl}" undefeated team in the Big 10. They have two games against top contenders Holy Cross (2-1) on Feb. 1 and Pangborn (2-1) on Feb. 12. 
"Pangborn is very big in­side and I don't really know about Holy Cross, but our team

MCC Thursday night against St. 
Louis at 7:30p.m. in the JACC. 

Top-ranked Missouri and No. 2 Kansas meet on Feb. 13, and both teams must still play No. 9 Oklahoma twice. 
Arkansas (17 -2 overall and 8­0 in the Southwest Conference) plays at Rice on Wednesday and at Texas on Sunday. Next week, the Razorbacks play Texas Tech at home and Baylor on the road. 
Richardson insists the Razorbacks aren't looking ahead, but adds, "If it happens that sometime in the future that we're ranked No. 1, we'll be glad to get there." 
"Being ranked this high is good for recruiting and for our fans but I also think it reflects well on om players and the

things they've done," he said. "I hope we can play up to that level because if we are the third best team in the country. it means we must have a chance to make the Final Four." 
The No. 3 ranking is the highest for a Richardson­coached team. His Tulsa squad reached No. 6 when Paul Pressey was a senior in 1982. 
Missouri (19-1) held the top spot for the second straight week with 59 first-place votes and 1,569 points from the na­tionwide panel of sportswriters and broadcasters. The Tigers struggled to beat Rutgers 89­84 last week, then easily de­feated Colorado. 
Kansas (20-1 ). which was No. 
1 for two weeks before losing to Missouri on Jan. 20, received the other four first-place votes and 1,510 points. 
Michigan and Duke each moved up three spots, with the Wolverines climbing to No. 4 and the Blue Devils to No. 5. Michigan downed Big Ten rivals Northwestern and Michigan State last week, while Duke beat North Carolina State and Georgia Tech in the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
Georgetown fell from third to sixth after losing to Syracuse, which rose four spots to No. 7. Louisville dropped from fourth to 1Oth after losing to DePaul and UNLV plunged from fifth to 12th after losing to LSU. 
Purdue, the surprising Big Ten leader, rose from No. 13 to No.8. 
Illinois is 11th, followPd by UNLV, Connecticut, LSU, La Salle, UCLA, Georgia Tech, St. John's, Minnesota and Loyola Marymount.

is small and quick," said cap­tain Ed Larkin comparing the teams. The team is led by Jim Cox, Tom Hester and Larkin. 
 The final conference is the Big Sky, which appears to be the most balanced. Stanford leads the division at 4-0, but Grace (3-0), Zahm (2-1) and Cavanaugh (2-1) are all right at their heels. 
"We feel very fortunate to be 4-0, some of those games could have gone either way," said Stanford captain Ray Flannery. His team displays a very unselfish attitude and passes very well. Forward Rob Vazquez averages 20 points per game, but is complemented by forwards Tom O'Connell and Greg O'Leary.
