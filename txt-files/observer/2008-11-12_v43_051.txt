Holocaust intervievv rescheduled 
White Rose Society commemorates victims 
By LIZ HARTER Saint Mary's Editor 
Saint Mary's students, fac­ulty and administrators who tried to attend yesterday's lunchtime showing of senior Sarah Testa's personal inter­view with Holocaust survivor Jacob Hennenberg may have been disappointed that the event was cancelled without any prior warning. 
The event was supposed to be part of Saint Mary's chap­ter of the White Rose Society's commemoration of the 70th anniversary of Kristallnacht, when over 20,000 men were sent to concentration camps. Kristallnacht, or the Night of the Broken Glass, is known as the event that marked the beginning of the Holocaust. 
Testa, the founder and president of the Saint Mary's chapter, first met Hennenberg when she was 13 and this past summer he agreed to preserve his per­sonal story on tape for the White Rose Society. 
The video of the interview was supposed to have been shown in the Student Center lounge Monday and Tuesday; however, Testa said she

On a rainy Veterans Day at Notre Dame, University President Emeritus Fr. Theodore Hesburgh told a standing room only crowd in the auditorium of the library that bears his name that he stands "in awe, respect and gratitude to our armed forces." 
"Because if we stand high in the councils of the world today," he said, "it's because we've had the kind of people who could stand behind our flag and out in front of our

Even though it may be per­ceived to be the opposite, Catholic's have a responsibility to respect and be stewards of the environment, Father John Pearson said during a Conversation on Catholicism event at Saint Mary's Tuesday. 
"It is a common statement that Christians are the enemy of the environment," Pearson said. 
In some ways that is true, he said. but Christians should not be singled out because they were as unconcerned with the environment as everyone else was in the past. 
"It's a recent phenomenon, a burgeoning movement of envi­ronmentalism," Pearson said. "Christians made up the majority of people in Europe so they get a lot of the blame ffor things that occurred in the pastl. But that statement stretches things a lot." 
Pearson said people who say Christians are not friends of the environment oftentimes claim that the book of Genesis and the Creation story found within teaches Christians to dominate society because it states "Be fruitful and multi­ply, and fill the earth and sub­due it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth." 
This passage, though, has been further interpreted to mean that humans are called to "cultivate and care" for the Earth, Pearson said. 
Pearson laid out six different thought processes that people may have to explain why they consider themselves and envi­ronmentalist. He said the list he was presenting was not exhaustive, but it contained the reasons he could think of to be an environmentalist off the top of his head and expressed them in simplified way. 
The first idea on his list was that "a nematode, a mosquito or a rat has as much of a right to live as a Saint Mary's stu­dent." He said people with this attitude have the idea that all things are equal and all have the same right. 

The second attitude he pre­sented was that humans "are on a spaceship called Earth with no help in sight." 
Pearson said people with this attitude think that the Earth is a limited, closed sys­tem and if humans mess up that system they cannot fix it so environmentalism is a type of self-defense. 
The third viewpoint he brought up is that humans "owe it to [their] children, but maybe [they] shouldn't have children."

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Group considers new off-campus Web site 
By JOSEPH McMAHON News Writer 

The Council of Representatives discussed the creation of a Web site centered on life off-campus at their meeting Tuesday. 
The Web site, which would be based off models used by Boston College and Georgetown, would include a number of resources, possi­bly including a guide to stu­dent safety and a list of restaurants in South Bend. The Web site is scheduled to launch sometime in March and is being funded by the Student Activities Office. 
"[The site will contain] anything pertaining to off-
campus so that it will all be in a centralized location," said Nicole O'Connor, the student government Parliamentarian and chair of the Task Force on Student Safety. "It will help students be aware of everything that is going on." 
Student body president Bob Reish said it is important to include elements on the site that will encourage students to visit it. 
"I would hate to spin our wheels if this is something students aren't going to use," he said. 
Off-campus president Billy Lyman said the inclusion of the University's policies

Man allegedly steals communion wafers from priest 
JENSEN BEACH, Fla. -Police in said they arrested a Connecticut man after he tried to steal communion wafers during a church service. The Martin County Sheriff's Office said 33-year-old John Samuel Ricci, of Canton, was cornered by fellow churchgoers when he grabbed a handful of wafers from the priest during communion services Saturday. 
The Stuart News reported that Ricci was being held down by six or seven offended parishioners when deputies arrived at St. Martin de Porres Catholic Church in Jensen Beach. Police say two parishioners, ages 82 and 61, received minor injuries in the scuffle.

Islan1ic architect receives award 
Architecture school gives Driehaus prize to Abdel-Wahed El-Wakil 
Special to The Observer 
Abdel-Wahed El-Wakil, one of the leading voices in contempo­rary Islamic architecture and a practitioner known worldwide for his use of traditional form and technique, has been named the 2009 Richard H. Driehaus Prize laureate. 
The Driehaus Prize, which is administered by the University of Notre Dame School of Architecture, is awarded annual­ly to an outstanding architect whose work applies the princi­ples of classicism, including sen­sitivity to the historic continuum, the fostering of community, and consideration of the impact to the built and natural environment. 
Over the past four decades, El­Wakil has built mosques, public buildings and private residences throughout the Middle East maintaining balance between continuance and change. His work -which includes the Halawa house in Agamy, Egypt, for which he won his first Aga Khan Award for Architecture; the residence of Ahmed Sulaiman in Jeddah; and the Quba Mosque in Medina -celebrates the overall principles of Islamic architecture and culture while reflecting the regional character and locality in which each structure resides. He works with traditional design principles that use indigenous materials and processes, and integrates them with contempo­rary technology to create famil­iar, functional and environmen­tally sustainable structures that are both timeless and for our time. 
El-Wakil's craftsmanship res­onates throughout the King Saud Mosque in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with its magnificent indigenous brick dome, constructed without concrete. His vision shines through in the Oxford University Centre for Islamic Studies in its sensitive blending of two diverse architectural traditions, integrat­ing Islamic design concepts seamlessly into Oxford's existing vernacular. Much of El-Wakil's work grapples with that duality of permanence and change, in individual projects and across cultures. 
El-Wakil currently is working on three projects in Beirut, Lebanon, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as a master planning project in Qatar that integrates best contempo­rary low-energy planning with climate-tempered Islamic built forms. 
The School of Architecture also has announced that Fabio Grementieri, Argentine scholar and preservationist, is being hon­ored with the 2009 Henry Hope Reed Award. The Henry Hope Reed Award is given to an influ­ential supporter of the classical architecture movement. 
Over the past 10 years, Grementieri has served as the project manager for some of Buenos Aires' most delicate and culturally significant architectur­al preservation projects includ­ing: the Palacio Bosch (United States Embassy), the Ernizuriz Palace (National Museum of Decorative Arts), the Pereda Palace (Brazilian Embassy), and Villa Ocampo (property of UNESCO). 
Grementieri leads a strong campaign to preserve the archi­tectural heritage and treasures of Buenos Aires. One of the sites this campaign aims to preserve is the world famous opera house, Teatro Colon. This week, Grementieri will release a new book co-authored with Pablo Zunino titled "Argentina's Cultural and Natural Heritage ­The Bicentennial's Album." 
Last year, the annual Driehaus Prize was doubled to a $200,000 unrestricted cash award and the Reed Award was doubled to $50,000. Together the two prizes represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment. 
Recipients were selected by a jury comprised of Richard H. Driehaus, founder and chairman of Driehaus Capital Management; Michael Lykoudis, Francis and Kathleen Rooney Dean of the Notre Dame School of Architecture; Paul Goldberger, architecture critic for The New Yorker; David M. Schwarz, presi­dent and CEO of David M. Schwarz Architects; Adele Chatfield-Taylor, president of the American Academy in Rome; Robert Davis, principal at Arcadia Land Company and Founder of Seaside, Fla.; and Leon Krier, architect, scholar and the inaugural Driehaus Prize recipient.

"Between 1970 and 2005, there were sixty-seven transitions from authoritarian governments to democratic governments. Out of those sixty-seven, fifty of the transitions were achieved using non-violent methods," DuVall said.

British man charged with terrorism 
SAQQABA, Egypt -Archaeologists have dis­covered a new pyramid under the sands of Saqqara, an ancient burial site that has yielded a string of unearthed pyramids in recent years but remains largely unexplored. 
The 4.300-year-old monument most likely belonged to the queen mother of the founder of Egypt's 6th Dynasty, and was built several hundrnd years after the famed Great Pyramids of Giza, antiquities chief Zahi Hawass told reporters in announcing the find Tuesday. 
The discovery is part of the sprawling necropolis and burial site of the rulers of ancient Memphis, the capital of Egypt's Old Kingdom. about 12 miles south of Giza. 
All that remains of the pyramid is a 16-foot­tall structure that had been buried under 65 feet of sand. 
"There was so much sand dumped here that no one had any idea there was something buried underneath," said Hawass. 
Chemical tanker hijacked by pirates 
KUALA LUMPUH. Malaysia -Pirates hijacked a Philippines chemical tanker with 23 crew ncar Somalia, bringing the total number of attacks in waters off the impover­ished African nation this year to 83, a mar­itime ollicial said Tuesday. 
The tanker was heading to Asia when it was seized Monday in the Gulf of Aden by pirates armed with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades, said Noel Choong, who heads the International Maritime Bureau's piracy reporting center in Kuala Lumpur. 
In Manila, Foreign Ministry spokesman Claro Cristobal said the Philippine Embassy in Nairobi and the ship's operator identified the chemical tanker as the MT Stolt Strength.

Obese children at risk, study finds 
NEW OHLEANS -Obese children as young as 10 had the arteries of 45-year-olds and other heart abnormalities that greatly raise their risk of heart disease, say doctors who used ultrasound tests to take a peek inside. 
"As the old saying goes, you're as old as your arteries are," said Dr. Geetha Haghuveer of Childn~n·s Hospital in Kansas City, who led one of the studies. "This is a wake-up call." 
The studies were reported Tuesday at an American Heart Association conference. 
About a third of American children are over­weight and one-fifth are obese. Many parents think that "baby fat" will melt away as kids get older. But research increasingly shows that fat kids become fat adults, with higher risks for many health problems. 
Woman killed at Ku Klux Klan ritual 
COVINGTON, La. -An Oklahoma woman invited to a rural Louisiana campsite for a Ku Klux Klan initiation ritual was shot and killed after she asked to be taken back to town, the sheriff of a New Orleans suburb said Tuesday. 
Eight people were arrested after authorities found the woman's body hidden under some brush, on the side of a road several miles from the remote campsite where the initiation was planned. 
Investigators found weapons, several flags and six Klan robes at the campsite, St. Tammany Parish Sheriff Jack Strain said in a news release.

Obama not attending world summit 
Global leaders to meet in Washington on economy, Obama staying in Chicago 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Leaders around the world flooded Barack Obama with con­gratulatory calls when he won the presidency last week. But they'll have to wait a while for personal visits. 
The president-elect has no plans to meet with any foreign dignitaries when they travel to Washington this weekend for an eco­nomic summit hosted by President Bush. 
Obama plans to stay in Chicago to prepare for January's transfer of power, even though Washington is a quick flight away and world leaders are clearly interested in his economic views. No meet­ings are scheduled in either city. Obama's aides plan to keep tabs on -and possi­bly participate in -the summit where world pow­ers hope to craft remedies to the global financial cri­sis. 
"We have one president at a time, and it's important that the president can speak for the United States at the summit," John Podesta, Obama's transition chief, told reporters Tuesday. Podesta, however, noted that Obama had urged such a summit dur­ing the presidential cam­paign. 
Before the election, Bush announced that the world's 20 largest industrialized nations and emerging economies would meet in Washington this Saturday; Obama has consistently said not to expect his pres­ence. 
Advisers repeatedly stress that Obama won't be president until inaugurated on Jan. 20. Left unsaid are other possible motivations for him to stay in Chicago this weekend. 
"He wants a clean, clear demarkation between the Bush administration and the Obama administration," said Thomas Mann, a scholar at the Brookings 
ISRAEL 


Institution public policy center. 
Obama assailed Bush throughout his campaign for pushing "failed policies" and the Democrat pledged that he would bring a new direction after eight years of GOP rule. Obama will inherit the worst economic conditions in the United States since the Great Depression, and keeping some distance from Bush will allow him to chart his own economic course. 
"The last thing he wants to do is get pulled into that summit and, more general­ly, be pulled into a situation where he's called upon to make early commitments and express opinions on matters before he's got his economic team fully togeth­er and before he has the authority of the office," Mann said. 

Obama backs coordina­tion between major eco­nomic powers to address the troubles. Campaigning in Richmond, Va., he said, "Our financial markets are so interwoven at this point, that we can't operate in isolation." 
"I don't think it's going to be resolved in one meet­ing," he said of the global crisis. 
Leaders attending the G­20 meeting are certainly interested in Obama's eco­nomic stance. 
In phone calls last week, Obama accepted congratu­lations froni leaders of countries including Canada, France, Italy, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Spain. The global financial crisis was among the topics he discussed with key U.S. allies. 
The president-elect held his first news conference Friday after he and Vice President-elect Joe Biden met privately with econom­ic advisers. Obama's mes­sage: "We are facing the greatest economic chal­lenge of our lifetime, and we're going to have to act swiftly to resolve it." 

Mayoral race shows religious divide 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM -A voter survey released after polls closed predicted victory for a secular businessman against a powerful ultra-Orthodox Jewish leader in Jerusalem's may­oral race Tuesday, a contest that 
again exposed  the  deep  divide  
between  religious  and  secular  
Israelis.  

Israelis voted around the country, picking mayors and city councils, but local issues and strong independent candidates overshadowed clashes between the major parties three months before national elections. In Jerusalem, the three largest parties failed to field candidates for mayor for the first time, leaving the race to representatives of two of the city's three distinctive and often squab­bling groupings. 

The telephone survey of people who voted conducted by Israel TV, released just after balloting ended at 10 p.m., showed that secular candi­date Nir Barkat defeated Meir Porush, 50 to 42 percent. The mar­gin of error and other details of the poll were not released. Such surveys have generally reflected outcomes but have occasionally been inaccu­rate. 
Porush, 53, an imposing figure on the ultra-Orthodox national political scene for years, his trademark bushy red beard going gray now, faced Nir Barkat, a venture capitalist in his second try for the mayor's job. 
Official results were expected early Wednesday. Leading candidates needed to win 40 percent of the vote to avoid a runoff in two weeks.

PAKISTAN 
Taliban fighters attack U.S. trucks 
Associated Press 
PESIIAWAH -Suspected Taliban fighters hijacked trucks carrying llumvees and other supplies for U.S.-Ied troops in Afghanistan, authorities said Tuesday after a brazen attack near the Khyber Pass that underscored the militants' grip across key mountain strong­holds. 
The assault highlighted the vulnerability of a vital supply route for the 65,000 U.S. and NATO forces battling a resur­gent Taliban in landlocked Afghanistan. A significant amount of supplies for the Western forces go through Pakistan. 
Attacks on convoys carrying food, fuel and other supplies are common on the road. But Monday's raid was especially large and well-organized. It also could further strain U.S.­Pakistani relations over rooting out Taliban and al-Qaida mili­tants along the border, which remain entrenched despite mili­tary offensives and U.S. missile strikes. 
Some 60 masked militants blocked tbe route at several points before overpowering the eonvoy, said Fazal Mahmood, a government official in Khyber tribal region. lie identified the attackers as members of Pakistan's Taliban movement. 
Security forces traded fire with the gunmen, but were forced to retreat, he said. The militants took about 13 trucks along with the drivers, who were believed to be Pakistani. 
A U.S. military spokesman in Afghanistan confirmed the thefts lat!~ Tuesday. 
"There were some U.S. mili­tary materials that were taken -llumvees and water tank 
trailers,"  said  Maj.  John  
Hedlield.  
Later Monday,  a  separate  

group of insurgents halted a truck carrying what appeared to be a NATO jeep, setting the mili­tary vehiele on lim, Mahmood said. NATO oflkials could not immediately be reached for comment on that incident. 
In the past, U.S. and NATO ollir.ials have played down tlu~ir h1sses along the pass. 
But earlier this year, NATO said it was trying to reduce its dependence on the route by negotiating with Hussia and other nations to let it truck "non-lethal" supplies to Afghanistan through Central Asia. 
Security forces, backed by hel­icopter gunships, hunted for the missing trueks and drivers. The military said late Tuesday it had recovered some of the stolen materials but would not specify what. 
"We are using all resources to traee and reeover the hijacked trueks, some of which wern ear­rying vehicles for the allied 
forces in Afghanistan," 
Mahmood said. 
Most of the supplies for U.S. 
and other foreign troops in 
Afghanistan arrive by ship at 
Pakistan's port of Karachi in 
unmarked containers. They are 
then taken by colorfully decorat­
ed trucks to places like Bagram 
Air Base, north of Kabul, the 
Afghan capital. 
NATO and U.S. officials have 
declined to say if the trucks 
carry weapons and ammunition. 
They have in the past suggested 
that ordinary criminals -not 
an orchestrated campaign by 
militants -are the main prob­
lem. 
The Khyber Pass, a stretch of about 30 miles, has long been an important trade route and militarily strategic area tra­versed for centuries by armies, from Moghul warriors to British colonial forces. It abuts the main northwestern Pakistan city of Peshawar. 
In a bid to eliminate militancy in the border region, the U.S. has stepped up unilateral mis­sile strikes there, a move con­demned by Pakistani leaders who say it only deepens anti­American feelings among civil­ians. 
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari was headed to the United States Tuesday for a U.N. conference on interfaith rela­tions. He was expected to broach the subject of the missile strikes with U.S. officials. 
Pakistan's prime minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani, issued a statement after a meeting Tuesday with a U.S. congres­sional delegation saying there was a "need for restoration of trust between" the two nations and that there must be "com­plete respect for Pakistan's ter­ritorial integrity." 
Pakistan has pursued its own military offensives against insur­gents, including ones in the Swat Valley and the Bajur tribal mgion. The U.S. has praised the operations, but the militants have staged a wave of suicide attaeks, apparently in retalia­tion. 
A suieidc bomber blew himself' up Tuesday outside a stadium hosting athletes from around the country, killing at least three p!Hlplc and wounding 17 while narrowly missing some top gov­ernment leaders, ol1ieials said. 
The bomber struck outside the main gate of the Peshawar Sports Complex, which was decked with lights for the clos­ing ceremony of the Inter­Provincial Games. Officials had promoted the games as a way to improve the northwest's violent image. 
The province's information minister, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, said he was just a few feet away from the site of the explosion when it happened, and that the province's governor had left the scene only 15 minutes before.

Proposition 8 dravvs criticis111 
Gay-rights activists are angry after same-sex marriage ban passes 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO 
California's gay-rights move­
ment has been beset by 
infighting and finger-pointing 
since the defeat of gay mar­
riage at the ballot box, with 
some activists questioning 
the campaign's mild tactics, 
including the decision not to 
show same-sex couples in 
ads. 
The movement's leaders "were very timid. They were too soft," said Robin Tyler, a lesbian comic who created a series of celebrity public service announcements with the slogan "Stop the Hate, No on 8" that were rejected because they were deemed too negative. "We were light­weights on our side." 
Proposition 8, a measure to stop gay marriage in California, passed with 52 percent of the vote last week in a painful defeat for gay rights activists. The ban overrode a California Supreme Court ruling last spring that allowed 18,000 same-sex couples to tie the knot over the past four months. 
Some gays are complaining that their leaders failed to organize a visible and vigor­ous defense of same-sex mar­riage. In particular, they say the movement failed to counter a series of hard-hit­ting ads warning that the ban on gay marriage was needed to prevent children from learning about gay relation­ships in school. 
Leaders of the campaign in favor of gay marriage say they made a strategic deci­sion not to highlight gay new­lyweds or same-sex couples with children in their ads for fear of alienating undecided heterosexual voters. 

T-he movement's first com­mercial, aired in late September, starred a couple with an adult lesbian daugh­ter. Later ads included a fic­tional woman with a lesbian niece, California's public schools chief, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein saying, "No matter how you feel about marriage, vote against dis­crimination." 
Geoff Kors, executive direc­tor of the gay rights group Equality California, defended the choice of advertisements. 
"Lesbian and gay people were everywhere in this cam­paign -as spokespeople, on YouTube, our Web site. For the television advertising, the best messengers were the messengers that were used," he said. 
But Michael Petrelis, a vet­eran AIDS activist in San Francisco, said the absence of gay couples in the media campaign was a fatal error. 
"We were seen more as a liability," Petrelis said. "When you have that kind of attitude, it's no wonder there was little community buy-in." 
The criticisms extend to beyond how the campaign was run to how people are responding to the ban's pas­sage. 
In the past few days, demonstrators have hit the streets in California, some­times clashing with police and snarling traffic. They have rallied outside Mormon temples to protest the church's major role in ban­ning gay marriage. 
Plans have been made for a 
demonstration outside a 
Mormon church in New York 
City on Wednesday, and out­
side city halls in every state 
on Saturday. 
Some gay rights leaders have encouraged the heated gatherings, while others worry they could backfire and offend churchgoers and others. 

Evan Wolfson, executive director of New York-based Freedom to Marry, raised no objection to the protests but said it is important that they be carried out peacefully. 
"Peaceful protest is impor­tant, time-honored way of mobilizing people to action for justice," he said. "It's completely understandable that people would be expressing their sadness and determination." 
Gay marriage is now legal in Massachusetts and Connecticut only, with Connecticut holding its first same-sex weddings on Wednesday. 
Exit polls in California showed that the gay mar­riage ban received a majority from black voters, which has prompted some gay leaders to complain that they were abandoned by a minority group that should understand discrimination. 
Kathryn Kolbert, a black lesbian who is president of People for the American Way, a Washington-based group that monitors the religious right, was so worried about a backlash that she wrote a memo to colleagues, warning it is wrong and self-defeating to blame black voters for the outcome. 
Bishops to oppose abortion 
Catholic leaders condemn the Obarna administration's pro-choice position 
Associated Press 
BAlTIMORE -The nation's Roman Catholic bishops vowed Tuesday to forcefully confront the Obarna administration over its support for abortion rights, saying the church and religious freedom could be under attack in the new pmsidential administration. 
In an in1passioned discussion on Catholics in public life, several bi-;hops said they would accept no compromise on abortion policy. Many condemned Catholics who had argued it was morally accept­able to back President-elect Obama because he pledged to reduce abortion rates. 
And several prelates promised to call out Catholic policy makers on their failures to follow church teaching. Bishop Joseph Martino of Scranton, Pa., singled out Vice President-elect Biden, a Catholic, Scranton native who supports abortion rights. 
"I cannot have a vice president­elect eoming to Scranton to say he's learned his values there when those values arc utterly against the teachings of the Catholic Church," Martino said. The Obama-Biden press oflicc did not immndiately respond to a request for eomment. 
Archbishop Joseph Naumann of tho Dioeese of Kansas City in Kansas said politicians "ean't cheek your principles at tlw door of the lPgislature." 

Naumann has said repeatedly that Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, a Catholic Demoerat who supports abortion right'l, should stop taking Holy Communion until she ehanges her stance. 
"They cannot call themselves Catholic when they violate such a core belief as the dignity of the unborn," Naumann said Tuesday. 
The discussion occurred on the same day the bishops approved a new "Blessing of a Child in the Womb." The prayer seeks a healthy pregnancy for the mother and makes a plea that "our civic rulers" perform their duties "while respecting the gift of human life." 
Chicago Cardinal Francis George, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, is preparing a statement during the bishops' fall meeting that will press Obama on abortion. 
The bishops suggested that the fmal document include the mes­sage that "aggressively pro-abor­tion policies" would be viewed "a<; an attack on the chureh." 
Along with their theological opposition to the procedure, church leaders say they worry that any expansion in abortion righL'l eould require Catholic hos­pital-; to pnrform abortions or losn federal funding. Auxiliary Bishop Thoma-; Paprocki of Chkago said tho hospitals would dose rather than eomply. 
During the campaign, many prnlatns had spoken out on abor~ 
tion more boldly than they had in 2004, telling Catholic politicians · and voters that the issue should bn the most important eonsidet"dtion in setting policy and deciding 
which eandidato to baek. 
Yet, aemrding to exit polls, 54 

percent of Catholics ehose Obama, 
who is Protnstant. The new bish­
ops' statement is meant to drive 
home tho point in a way that ean­
not be misconstrued. 
"We have a very important thing 

to say. I think we should say it 
clearly and with a punch," said 
New York Cardinal Edward Egan. 
But some bishops said ehureh 

leaders should take care with the 
tone of the statement. 
Bishops differ on whether 

Catholic lawmakers should refrain 
from receiving Communion if they 
diverge from central church 
beliefS. Each bishop sets policy in 
his own diocese. 
"We must act and be perceived 

as acting as caring pastors and 
faithful teachers," said Bishop 
Blase Cupich of Hapid City, S.D. 
Dr. Patrick Whelan, a pediatri­

cian and president of Catholic 
Democrats, said angry statnmenL-; 
from church leaders were eoun­
terproduetivn and would only 
alienate Catholics. 
"We're calling on the bishops to move away from the morn vidous language," Whelan said. lin said the church nnnds to aet "in a morn ernativn, constru<tive way," to Plld abortion.

IN BRIEF 
Pelosi urges auto industry bailout 
WASHINGTON -House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for "emergency and limited finan­cial assistance" for the battered auto industry on Tuesday and urged the outgoing Bush administration to join lawmakers in reaching a quick compromise. 
Four days after dismal financial reports from General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., Pelosi backed legislation to make the automak­ers eligible for help under the $700 billion bailout measure that cleared Congress in October. 
In a written statement, the California Democrat said the aid was needed "in order to prevent the failure of one or more of the major American automobile manufacturers, which would have a devastating impact on our econo­my, particularly on the men and women who work in that industry." 
"Congress and the Bush administration must take immediate action," she added. Administration officials have concluded that the bailout bill that passed earlier does not permit loans to the auto industry, but lawmakers are expected to return to the Capitol for a brief postelection session beginning next week. 
Costa Rica ready to join CAFTA 
SAN JOSE. Costa Rica-Costa Rica is finally ready to join the Central American Free Trade Agreement. 
The country signed the accord in 2004 along with the rest of Central America, the United States and the Dominican Republic. 
But its implementation has been stalled for four years by opposition lawmakers who didn't want to open Costa Rica's powerful state-run telecommu­nications and insurance industries to competition. Others felt the required intellectual-property laws dictating jail time for violators were too strict. 
Costa Ricans voted for the trade deal in a national referendum a year ago, moving it for­ward. But then it became stalled again as con­gress squabbled over the enabling legislation dealing with 13 different aspects of the deal. 
On Tuesday, lawmakers overcame the final intellectual-property hurdle by allowing schools and universities to copy some materials and by reducing prison time for those guilty of selling pirated goods.

Officials offer new mortgage plan 
Borrowers to get reduced rates or longer terms, critics say it's not enough 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Once again, the government has offered another plan to help troubled homeown­ers. Once again, critics say it doesn't go far enough. 
The plan announced Tuesday by federal offi­cials and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac sounds sweeping in its approach: Borrowers would get reduced interest rates or longer loan terms to make their payments more affordable. 
But there's a catch. The plan focuses on loans Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee. They are the dominant players in the U.S. mortgage market but represent only 20 per­cent of delinquent loans. 
Sheila Bair, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said the plan "falls short of what is needed to achieve wide­scale modifications of dis­tressed mortgages." 
With the government spending billions to aid distressed banks, "we must also devote some of that money to fixing the front-end problem: too many unaffordable home loans," Bair said in a statement. 
Democrats on Capitol Hill aren't satisfied, either. "When the loan is chopped up into a million pieces and any investor can block a modification from hap­pening, a program like this will only scratch the surface of the mortgage crisis," said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. 
The economic crisis is still unnerving Wall Street. Stocks fell again as investors found few indus­tries safe from the con­sumer spending slump. With Starbucks Corp. and luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers Inc. both posting disappointing quarterly results. the Dow Jones industrial average closed down nearly 180 points. 
The financial crisis took on a new dimension on Capitol Hill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for "emergency and limited financial assis­tance" for the battered auto industry and urged the outgoing Bush admin­istration to join lawmak­ers in reaching a quick compromise during a postelection session of Congress. 


The new mortgage assis­tance plan was announced by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which seized control of Fannie and Freddie in September, and other government and industry officials. 
Officials say they hope the new approach, which takes effect Dec. 15, will become a model for loan servicing companies that collect mortgage payments and distribute them to investors. These compa­nies have been roundly criticized for being slow to respond to a surge in defaults. 

James Lockhart, direc­tor of the housing finance agency, urged investors to "rapidly adopt this pro­gram as the industry stan­dard." 
Still, government offi­cials had no estimate of how many homeowners would be able to qualify. Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee nearly 31 million U.S. mortgages, or nearly six of every 10 out­standing. But they have far lower overall delin­quency rates -under 2 percent. 
To qualify, borrowers would have to be at least three months behind on their home loans and would have to owe 90 per­cent or more than the home is worth. Investors who do not occupy their homes would be excluded, as would borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy. 
Qualified borrowers would get help in several ways: The interest rate would be reduced so that 

Spending worries send stocks lower 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Wall Street got another dose of painful reality Tuesday and sent stocks diving as investors recognized that few indus­tries are safe from the consumer spending slump -whether they're building homes, making cars or sell­ing coffee. The Dow Jones industrial average lifted off its lows of the day, but still closed down nearly 180 points. 
It became clear to investors that it's going to be hard to rely on the aver­age consumer to pull the economy out of its downturn. Late Monday, Starbucks Corp. reported lower sales across the coffee chain, and early Tuesday, Toll Brothers Inc. posted a sharp drop in revenue and said it was too difficult to predict what the luxury homebuilder's profit would be next year. 

Wall Street was also jittery as the nation's feeble automakers hope for a bailout from the federal government similar to the one given ailing insurer American International Group Inc. General Motors Corp., whose shares have plunged to 60-year lows, said late Monday it would cut 1,900 facto­ry jobs on top of the 3,600 cuts it announced Friday. 
Stocks did recover from deeper losses after a media report that quot­ed a BlackRock executive as saying a $30 billion Bear Stearns mortgage portfolio could be worth more than its market value suggests. And in anoth­er promising sign for mortgages, the government announced the largest moves yet to help homeowners rene­gotiate hundreds of thousands of delinquent loans held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
But the market ultimately ended lower, acknowledging that although the mortgage crisis that spawned the current economic deterioration is being addressed, the economy remains extremely troubled. 
There were no economic reports released Tuesday, since the govern­ment and bond markets were closed for Veterans Day. Investors didn't need government data to see that the economy's slide isn't over, though ­the litany of troubling corporate news was enough. Wall Street has been anticipating grim results from corpo­rate America, but it cannot gauge yet how bad they could get.

I returned home on Saturday night, after our crushing defeat at the hands of Boston College, and realized I had to soothe my ruffied feathers. Normally when I'm in such a mood I decide to watch a movie, a movie that will either make me laugh or make me cry depending on just how bad of a mood I'm in. And this past Saturday was no difrerent from any of those other days. 
As lllippPd through my DVD binder trying to decide which movie would help me through the troubled time, I came across many titles that would have been extn~mely helpful in this situation. "Hudy"-a Notre Dame classic that always brings a tear to my eye. But how eould I watch Rudy when the last thing 1 wanted to think about was Notre Dame Football'? "Heavyweights," the earliest and arguably best of all of Judd Apatow's movies, always lightens my day. But a petty argument with a friend who also likes the movie has soured "Heavyweights" for me for the time b11ing. 
I was running out of options and then I saw it. The perfect movie for my current mood. Not only could I watch it but I could sing along to it and even get up and dance if I felt the need. "West Side Story." The timeless tale of Homeo and Juliet writ large on the landscape of 1950s New York City. Yes, "West Side Story." 
But I became troubled about midway through the movie. As Tony and Maria begin serenading each other during 'Tonight" I realized that if I hadn't been by myself I probably would not have been able to watch or even suggest "West Side Story." Why? Because I'm a 

man and men don't like musicals. 

At least that's what our culture would have you believe. It's not cool to be a man who likes musicals. Musicals have singing and dancing. Men don't sing and dance. We grunt and drink beer. Musicals have whimsical plotlines. Men don't like whimsical plotlines. We like John Wayne and Burt Reynolds. Liking musicals is akin to liking the ballet or the opera. 
Now, a typical male response to the suggestion of watching a musical would be: "What?! You want to watch a musi­cal?! That's so lame. Why can't we wateh 'Eseape from New York' or 'Demolition Man?"' With all due respect for the work of Kurt Hussell and Sylvester Stallone, I argue that there is a time and a place for watching musicals: all the time and everywhere. Think about it, all you males out there, all you manly men who disown musicals: I have heard you sing along to Disney tunes at parties. I have seen you dress up as Aladdin and Magic Carpet for llalloween. I have watched you watch Family Guy and The Simpsons and appreeiate every time they break into a big, Broadway number. So don't tell me that you don't like musicals. 
The counter to this -"We only like thosn things in an ironic way. When we sing along to 'A Whole New World' we're doing it because it's not cool to do it, and wn know it's not cool to do it, but by us knowing that it's not cool and doing it anyway we're making it cool. It's ironic." Nay, I say to you. A thousand times nay. If you really wanted to treat musicals in an ironic fashion you would choose a song that nobody's ever heard of from an obseure musical, probably something approximating Philip Glass, and you would make it your ring tone. You wouldn't thrash around a party as soon as "Circle of Life" comes on or belt out "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" at the top of your lungs. 
I want all the men at this University to be able to say, "I am a fan of musicals." It's unfair that such a gender bias exists: we can't openly and happily admit our love of a toe-tappingly delightful show­tune. Women arn privileged. Sure, in recent years men have bonn able to overcome the romantic conwdy barrier, but the Groat Wall of Muskals cannot be conquered by our small and insignificant pro-musical front. 
There is some hope for us musical-lov­ing men. Trey Parker and Matt Stone understand the power and beauty of a musical and how it ean make a truly great cinematic experienee. It can in fad be solidly argued that these two South Park creators heralded in the new age of movie musicals with "South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uneut." Without that movie, maybe we wouldn't even have "Ilairspray" or "Mamma Mia!" on the big screen. 
But evnn though musicals an~ now more prevalent in theaters, men still cannot go in alone. I had to see "Hairspray" with my sister and "Mamma Mia!" with a female eoworker because of a latent fear my friends would laugh at me for doing so. And that's not right. 
We need to reliJeus the discussion of gender on this campus. Sure, there are latent gender issues that plague our community. But one that never gots mentioned is the inability for men to like musicals publidy. 
A<> a step in the right dirnction, I invite all my friends to an opnn viewing of "My Fair Lady" in my room this coming Friday afternoon. If nobody shows up, it won't matter. With the door open I'll be singing, "I Could've Daneed All Night" with pride.

lETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Learning to laugh 

ND football disappoints 
premise of the movie's humor relies heavily on the characterization of blondes as air-headed. Shouldn't we be equally outraged at the "degrading" image of blonde haired individual the movie portrays? Best yet, consider 2006's "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan." Doesn't this movie both mispresent the American people and degrade our idea of the Kazakhstanian people to that of a backwards country? 
My point, then, is this. Nearly every comedy can seem "degrading" or offen­sive if viewed in some manner. The key is to understand the difference between poking fun and making fun. "Tropic Thunder" is not a movie intent on the degradation of those with mental hand­icaps, but offers jokes of all varieties, whether based on culture (Alpo Chino's Booty Sweat ad), ethnicity (the back­wards nature of the Asian drug lords), race (Kirk Lazarus's skin pigmentation) or mental capacity. By all means, I do not mean to put down the trials and challenges that those with mental dis­abilities encounter and incredibly sur­pass. On the contrary, I think a little humor only serves to highlight these great challenges. All it takes is the right perspective. As Forr mentions, Notre Dame is named after our Blessed Mother ... and I'm sure she had a sense of humor as well. 
Colin Keeler freshman Stanford Hall Nov. 11 

"Tropic Thunder" was far and away the funniest movie of this summer, sur­passing the likes of "Pineapple Express," "Step Brothers" and more. From its opening sequence of psuedo­advertisements to its uproarious finish, the movie was as enjoyable as any I've seen in recent times. I was elated at learning the movie would be showing with SUB movies, as I knew very many of my friends had missed the opportu­nity to experience the hilarity of this movie. 
Thus, I cannot disagree more with Mary Forr's opinion in "Tropic Thunder: not so funny" (Nov. 11). I cer­tainly do not mean to downgrade any of the great challenges those with dis­abilities encounter. However, I do debate her Letter's repeated claim that the film "degrades" those with disabili­ty. Again and again, Forr makes this statement, but only once does she offer any backing to it, likening the disabled­related humor to making fun of Jewish or black people. I hate to break the news, but many comical movies do have jokes concerning race and reli­gion, where most people generally understand the difference between making a joke and "degrading" a spe­cific people. 
Consider, for instance, the 2002 movie, "Van Wilder." The main humor in the character, Taj, draws from the fun poked at his Indian heritage and the resultant culture clash. By Forr's standards of humor, isn't this an unfair and "degrading" portrayal of the Indian culture? Likewise, in the 2001 movie, "Legally Blonde," the entire 
Monday, Neil Hayes of the Chicago Sun Times wrote an article entitled "'Weis Watch' has begun at ND". The article doesn't need to be read for the gist of it to be understood: Coach Charlie Weis is on borrowed time. It was all over ESPN at around 3 pm Monday, discussed on "College Football Live," "Around The Horn" and "Pardon The Interruption." Weis' winning percentage, winning record against winning teams and all the negative statistics are thrown around. 
One ESPN reporter (Joe Schad) said that the biggest reason Weis won't be fired is the buyout on his contract. Campus is groaning with discontent and frustration. And it's all under­standable. Why write a letter to point this all out? 
Because it needs to stop. Being a fan doesn't mean unabashed green Kool-Aid drinking. It does mean sup­porting your team and every part of it, but is not mutually exclusive from being critical. I'm tired of hearing the groans even though I agree with a fair chunk of them. 
I, too, want the nasty team we were promised. It's hard to watch our run­ning game flounder while a team in East Lansing -the now proud little brother in that state -runs smash mouth football behind a 3-star run­ning back from Dayton, Ohio that the previous regime didn't even take a crack at recruiting. I thought this team grew up faster than we all expected. 
Ah, yes. Expectations. Remember at the start of the year, when everyone, including people here on campus, expected us to go 7-5 or 8-4? Why is it that this is now unacceptable to people? What did everyone expect our young team's growing pains to look like? What did everyone expect our losses to look like? Close losses are now unacceptable, as is being shut-
Too soon for 'Weis w-atch' 
We have all been here before. We were here in 1985 when Miami beat Notre Dame 56-irrelevant, in 2000 when Oregon State took Notre Dame to the woodshed and in 2004 when BYU embar­rassed ND in the opener. And yet again, we find ourselves at that same familiar place after the recent ND football no­show in Boston. 
We are at that familiar point in time when we know, beyond any reasonable doubt, the fate of the Notre Dame football coach. The performance in Boston was such a gross distortion of Notre Dame football, that there can be no other way forward, other than a complete purge of those who produced this version of the Irish. Some within the University will wave their hands for awhile and show you statistics to indicate that there has been improvement in passing yards per game and sacks allowed per game, etc., but those are ruses to distract you from reality. The reality is that those of us who were blessed to witness Notre Dame foot­ball under Ara Parseghian, Dan Devine and Lou Holtz can attest that this Notre Dame team is light years away from the historical standard. I cannot even imagine what those who witnessed Leahy's teams must be thinking. 
So, once again, we will all go through the usual drill: Thousands of alumni are writing their letters to Fr. Jenkins, Mr. Swarbrick and Mr. Notebaert, withhold­ing their annual donations to the University, stadium attendance will begin to look like a men's basketball game, bookstore sales will go down and the NBC ratings will reach the lower limit of detec­tion, as alumni like myself decide to take my kids to the park rather than do penance for five hours every Saturday. And we will all wait and watch to see what Charlie, Jack and Fr. Jenkins are going to do in the next Act. 
At some point, perhaps at the end of this season, or the end of the next, a change will be made in the Notre Dame football head coaching position and we will cast our lots with yet another hopeful out by a team with a Top 10 defense, and games that we admittedly gave away. Did we, as fans, expect too much after some glimmers of what will be against teams who aren't very good? 
The losses are met with calls for the coach's head and that the players don't have the heart or will to win. You, the reader of this letter, probably know a player. Ask him how much he enjoys losing. I'd be willing to bet that he'd rather win. A lot more. As for the coach, who inherited a myriad of recruiting problems, has hauled in three great-to-stellar recruiting class­es, with a fourth on the way. 
People expect all of our freshmen to be Michael Floyd, and they all can't be that. He's a freak. But how about the most underrated player on our team, Mike Turkovich, a senior who is just now making serious contributions on the field and has been a rock a left tackle. I didn't expect it when I, at all of 5'10", attempted to post him up in bookstore basketball last year. Some people take time to mature. Most do, in fact. 
Meanwhile Coach Weis is holed up in his "bunker" trying to get ready for Navy and secure another top recruit­ing class. Let next year be the one in which judgment is passed. Next year, it will be his players and the team will no longer be "young," with a junior quarterback leading the way. Realize these are the growing pains you knew were coming at the beginning of the year, but somehow forgot about along the way. Because sophomores and freshmen can't lead a team. Not yet. 
Keep the faith. After all, patience is a virtue.

Offensive co111ics are back 
saviour for America's once-finest sporting team. It should be noted that I admire Charlie Weis and what he has accom­plished in his life personally and profes­sionally and for his unyielding public devotion and defense of Notre Dame. Since he is a fellow alumnus and loves Notre Dame as much as any of us, I sus­pect he will put Notre Dame above any personal life-illusions and will yield the chair ifhe thinks it is for the betterment of his alma mater. 
I also trust that Mr. Swarbrick and Fr. Jenkins appreciate that, as we enter into our 16th year of non-competitiveness, it is more than possible for Notre Dame foot­ball to become permanently irrelevant, save a radical change in course. Don't let the NBC contract fool you. That contract has wrought the worst possible malady upon Notre Dame and its leadership: complacency, the misguided sense that all is well with the Notre Dame "brand" when, in fact, the "brand" has been criti­cally ill for 15 years. 
And what of the rest of us? We continue to grasp more and more tightly onto the illusion that Notre Dame football will someday be great once again. Much like the protagonist in "The Great Gatsby," many of us came so far to Notre Dame and have felt such exhilaration at how Notre Dame football proudly represented us in the past, it seems nearly impossible to believe we cannot grasp the same greatness now. 
Notre Dame football is our "green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us." Notre Dame football, as we once knew it, has eluded us for two decades. But just like Gatsby, "that's no matter -tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther ... And one fine morning-So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back cease­lessly into the past."

A Fresh Take on The Ancient Battle of the Sexes 
ANALISE LIPARI 
Scene Editor Imagine a world where you have no idea that anyone else 
exists, other than your two mysterious caretakers. Then, suddtmly, you're plunged into the outside world, seeing yourself and others for the very first time. What would you do'? I low would you aet? And, as "The Dispute" asks its dmraeters and its audience, which snx might deceive the otlwr first? Who is morn prone to adultery? 
The latest Main Stage show from the Film, Television and Theater department at Notre Dame, Pierre Marivaux's "The Dispute" is an exerdse in experimenta­tion. A wealthy young royal (Kevin Stein) proposes a sce­nario to a group of friends: Eighteen years before, the same discussion breaks out at his father's court. The King dm~idns to test the question by raising two babies of each sex in complnte isolation, and "The Dispute" details what ensues when those four "experiments" finally meet. 
Director Siiri Scott and her able-bodied cast do very wnll with what could fen! like datnd material. The battle of the snxes is, no doubt, an eternal discussion between women and men. But with a play whose lifetime is more than ten times that of the actors? FTT deserves praise for keeping the matnrial feeling fresh and relevant. 

Thn production team for "Thn Dispute" has transplant­ed Marivaux's 1744 french play to a set that feels like it's straight out of AMC's "Mad Men," or maybe a Hock Hudson-Doris Day comedy. "Pillow Talk" could have easi­jumpnd to this stylized, seemingly desert-set building, th angularly constructed stone and steel. The music aying before and aftnr the performance, and at occa­. mal moments during the production, reinforces the see­.nario. with strains of "Come On-a My House" and · .i"Volare" coming through. It's an interesting effect.

Occasionally the language and the set feel a bit too far apart, but those moments are rare. .·· 
The actors are clearly well-prepared for what might have been a daunting task. Matt Goodrich and John Maltese arc the two male innocents in the king's experi­ment, and each succeeds at capturing a blend of physical comedy and eager, goofy masculinity. At one point, Goodrich's Azor slams into the ground, and you can't help admiring their commitment to the physicality of their roles. Their exchange when they first meet is a priceless moment. "Do you eat food'?" Goodrich asks, hesitant; "Every day," Maltese emphatically replies. "Awesome!" Agrend. 
Their female counterparts are both good, as well, and all four succeed with adapting themselves to Marivaux's adaptation of the commedia dell'arte style. The girls' obsessions with their own reflections play well for laughs -watch for the scene with a pair of compact mirrors. 
The play's play on social and gender dynamics are intriguing for the innocents, their wealthy spectators, and the audience watching "The Dispute" alike. It raises questions about which sex is more guilty for the indiscre­tions of love, commitment and adultery. At one point, Stephanie Newsome's Carise, one of the two caretakers of the four innocents, tries to persuade an innocent not to cheat: "Consult your heart! You'll loathe your infidelity." Newsom and Edward Velazquez, her male counterpart, are both amusing as the exasperated pair who carry out this great social experiment. The final fate of the quad is interestingly staged, as well. 
"The Dispute" is surprisingly short, but very well done.

It's a precarious situation. What 
uld you do if you are infinitely 

ehind on your bills, stuck in a dead-end job, and need to turn things around in any way that you can? 
Well, if you are a resourceful slacker like Zack (Seth Rogen of "Knocked Up") or his roommate Miri (Elizabeth Banks of "W."), you set out to make an amateur adult film (with a less-than-printable title) with a rag-tag group of locals in hopes of breaking the bank. While 

might sound like an abhorrent 

idea to some, it is (in light of the 
nt economic situation) a hilari­ous look at the lengths to which people are willing to go to in the hope of living the American dream. 
Admittedly, "Zack and Miri" is not a film for everyone. Writer/director Kevin Smith of "Clerks" and "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" fame does not disappoint in his bold style, in which nudity, foul language and indecent situations abound (you will never think about frosting a cake without feeling dirty ever again). 
Like many of Smith's films, though, it is a romantic (or "bra­mantic") comedy of sorts, and, while the film does not apologize for its sex-charged subject matter, one does walk out of the film with a deep connection to the characters and a sense of real life even if it is a life you would not want to find your­self in. 
Zack and Miri are life-long friends who live in a dingy apartment in Pittsburgh struggling to get by. Then, one snowy Thanksgiving, one bill too many has gone past due, and they end up without any utili­ties and on the verge of eviction. Zack, after having a conversation

The movie ends up being a time­tested tale of long-time friends find­ing love in the most unlikely of situ­ations, no matter how uncouth situation might be.

The food, while simple, is also delicious. The different types of chicken-all dark meat (legs and thighs) ­were cooked to perfection and were very tender.

The decor, while sparse, fits the restaurant. The walls are decorated with only a few pieces, and the theme of the art -if there is one -is ele­phants. There are some tradi­tiona! pieces of decor in the room, such as a bamboo screen just inside the door, but otherwise the dining room is Spartan, with just a few tables and chairs. 
One of the things that makes Thai Lao Food a per­feet college hangout, however, was what was on the two tel­evisions -one in each in opposite corners. At first, Adam Sandler's movie "The Waterboy" was playing, fol­lowed by "Project A," a 1987 Jackie Chan movie from his Hong Kong days. 
Overall, the food combined with a relaxed atmosphere and affordable price to make Thai Lao Food a great off-campus choice.

"I didn't know what was going to happen." Utah eoaeh Jerry Sloan said. "It was the first time he's played in six gamns. We thought he'd play five minutes or so but he played longer. It kind of depends .~m him how much he ean play. 
Williams played 31 minutes and shot 1-of-8 from the field. 
"Evnry day, I've gotten a lot stronger," Williams said of being able to return. 
Carlos Boozer led Utah with 19 points and 16 rebounds. Andrei Kirilenko and Bonnie Brewer added 16 points apieen for the Jazz, who 
improved to 6-1 and lead the Northwest Division. Brewer seored all of his point in the fourth quarter after missing his first nine shots. 
"At halftime, I was really down on myself," Brewer said. "My teammates told me to hang tough and keep my head up." 
Andre Miller scored 25 points, Andre Iguodala had 15 points and 10 rebounds and Elton Brand added 13 for the reeling Sixers, who lost their third in a row and fell to 2-5. 
"It's a disappointing start," Brand said. "We have to fight through it." 
Samuel Dalembert and Thaddeus Young each added 11 rebounds for the 76ers, who shot just 38 pereent from the field. 
"We've just got to find ways to keep working hard and turn this around," lguodala said. 
The Jazz scored 13 of the first 15 points in the fourth quarter -nine by Brewer ­to take a 76-69 lead. His 3­pointer with 4:11 remaining extended Utah's lead to 83-73 and sealed the win. 
Philadelphia never got clos­er than five the rest of the way. 
"I just think our offense is out of sync," Sixers coach Maurice Cheeks said. 
The Sixers trailed by as many as 13 points in the third quarter. Facing a 57-45 deficit, Philadelphia went on a 16-2 run to take a 61-59 advantage on a layup by 0 since he replaced Allen Miller, who scored 10 points Iverson at point guard. during that stretch.

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Tim lincccum was a big winner on a woeful team, which fit him perfectly. 
Firing 97 mph fastballs from his miniature frame, the National League Cy Young Award recipient is an anomaly in almost every way. 
Lincecum joined Mike McCormick (196 7) as the only San Francisco Giants to win the Cy Young, taking home pitching's highest honor by a comfortable margin Tuesday following his second major league season. 
"I was definitely surprised. I thought it was going to be a lot closer," lincecum said. 
The slender kid with the whirling windup received 23 of 32 first-place votes and 137 points in balloting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Brandon Webb of the Arizona Diamondbacks got four first-place votes and fin­ished second with 73 points. 
Listed at 5-foot-11 and 160 pounds, tiny by today's standards for a big league pitcher, Lincecum defied detractors -and the laws of physics -by overpowering one hulking slugger after another. 
"I don't remember any­body in my time who had that style of pitching, who put that kind of torque on his body," McCormick said on a Giants conference call. "I think that article in Sports Illustrated that called him a freak probably sums it up." 

lincecum was 18-5 with a 
2.62 ERA and a major league-best 265 strikeouts, remarkable numbers for a fourth-place club that fm­ished 72-90. 
In fact, Steve Carlton was the lone Cy Young winner to pitch for a team that was worse. The Hall of Farner was an incredible 27-10 with a 1.97 ERA for the 1972 Philadelphia Phillies, who went 59-97. 
Lincecum led the NL in winning percentage (. 783), ranked second in ERA and was third with 227 innings. 
The 24-year-old right-han­der made his first All-Star squad, but an illness pre­vented him from appearing in the July 15 game at Yankee Stadium. 
New York Mets ace Johan Santana, who led the league in ERA (2.53) and innings (234 1-3), also garnered four first-place votes and came in third. 
The other first-place vote went to Milwaukee lefty CC Sabathia, last year's ALwin­ner who was traded by Cleveland into the National League on July 7. He went 11-2 with a 1.65 ERA and seven complete games in 17 starts for the Brewers, pitch­ing them to their first playoff berth since 1982. 
IN BRIEF Nationals Ret Olsen,
Willingham from Marlins 
WASHINGTON -Starting pitcher Scott Olsen and outfielder Josh Willingham were traded by the Florida Marlins to the Nationals on Tuesday in a five-player deal that signals the start of Washington's efforts to revamp its roster after a major league-worst 59­102 season. 
The Marlins received second base­man Emilio Bonifacio and two minor leaguers: second baseman Jake Smolinski and right-hander P.J. Dean. 
Each player the Nationals got is entering his first year of salary arbitra­tion. 
Olsen went 8-11 with a 4.20 ERA in 2008, his third consecutive season with at least 31 starts-he has never been on the disabled list. The lcft-hander is 31-37 with a 4.63 ERA in the majors. 
Willingham, who will be 30 on open­ing day, hit .254 with 15 homers and 51 RBis this year, when he missed 50 games with a herniated disk in his back. 

Brady back at work in 
Patriots training room 
FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -Tom Brady is back with his Patriots teammates, laughing and talking with them ­and, more importantly, rehabilitating the injured left knee that ended his season in the very frrst quarter. 
Brady underwent surgery on Oct. 6 and said on his Web site on Oct. 18 that he had another operation on the knee after it became infected. The Boston Herald reported that he had two more procedures since then to fight an infection and that he was on a six-week course of intravenous antibi­otics. The team has not commented on those details. 
The star quarterback was back in Foxborough on Nov. 4 and has been working in the Gillette Stadium train­ing room beside teammates who are busy preparing for games. He has not been seen in the locker room during the period when it is open to the media. A black knee brace was on the chair at his locker Tuesday. 
Contract dispute likelY. ends 
Hoffman's run in San Diego 
SAN DIEGO-Trevor Hoffman's record-setting run as San Diego Padres closer is almost certainly over after the team withdrew its contract offer for 2009. 
Hoffman, baseball's career saves leader and the face of the franchise since Tony Gwynn retired following the 2001 season, was upset with the abrupt, impersonal way the club ended contract talks, agent Rick Thurman said Tuesday. 
Thurman doubts negotiations can be rekindled. 
Hoffman's appearances out of the bullpen were announced by the omi­nous gongs from ACIDC's "Hells Bells." The Padres apparently rang out the Hoffman era when they pulled their offer of $4 million for 2009 and a $4 million club option for 2010. Thurman said the club also refused the closer's request for a meeting with top execu­tives, who appear to be slashing salary because of owner John Moores' difficult divorce.

USC w-ants revenge for 2007 loss 
Spurrier dismisses 
Associa1ed Press 
Florida storyline 
LOS ANGELES -It's 13 
Associa1ed Press 
COLUMBIA, S.C. -The last time Steve Spurrier brought South Carolina to The Swamp to face his old sehool, Florida's national championship run was near­ly derailed by their beloved former coach's team. 
Much was made of Spurrier's return to Gainesville, Fla., for that game in 2006. It was the first time the ol' ball eoach, who won a lleisman Trophy as a player and a national championship as a coach for the Gators, had faced his alma mater at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. 
The game ended up being ranked first in the SEC and third in the country, faces its toughest challenge this year. Since losing to Mississippi, the Gators have averaged nearly 49 points a game during a five-game winning streak. 
"I would say Florida has a better team this year than they had two years ago that won the national champi­onship," said Spurrier, who led the Gators to six of their seven SEC titles. 
Meyer likes to remind his players of Florida's football history at the beginning of the year, pointing out the list in the south end zone of the Gators' SEC and national 
champi­
onships.

Spurrier brings the (;anwcocks back to Florida on Saturday, again with a ehanen to dash the Gators' national title hopes. Another Spurrier homecoming isn't mueh of a story line this time. 
"I don't think it'll be a big deal," Spurrier said about the trip. "It'll just be the Gamecocks against the Gators." 
But there's no question Spurrier's presence on the sideline opposite the Gators has made a series dominat­ed by Florida more intrigu­ing. 
In 2005, Spurrier's first game against Florida, the Gamecocks beat the Gators for the first time since 

USC dominated Stanford statis­
tically, rolling up 459 yards of 
total offense to 235, but commit­
ted five turnovers while forcing 
only one. 

The game turned late in the third quarter, after the Trojans had taken a 16-7lead. Not count­ing their final possession, when they took a knee with the game in hand, the Cardinal gained 186 yards and scored 17 points the last three times they had the ball. 
Pritchard threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Mark Bradford on fourth-and-goal with 49 seconds left and Derek Belch's PAT provided the winning points. 
"We're not supposed to lose at the Coliseum, that hurt the most," Moore recalled with a sigh. "It was a horrible feeling, being booed by the home fans, very depressing. We have to get that win back, feel like we got something back from last year, get some emotion out at their place." 
Carroll said the Cardinal is improved from last year, adding: "We had all we could handle last time around. So we're going to try to get right and put together a great game here." 
Asked which team might bene­fit from what happened in last year's game, Carroll replied: "I don't know, you'd have to ask them how they feel about it. But anytime that we get beaten, par­ticularly in the conference, it's just a reminder of how critical every game is and how you have to get ready and right every sin­gle time you go, and you have to play well and do things right, and not do the kinds of things that can beat you." 
Carroll specifically mentioned the five turnovers. Four came after halftime on interceptions thrown by John David Booty, who played the whole game despite breaking a bone in the middle finger of his throwing hand in the second quarter. Carroll ha'i since acknowledged on several occa­sions that he made a mistake by not replacing Booty, who sat out the next three games. 
"They came through, made the plays they had to make, and it was a great finish for them," Carroll said. "It wa'in't for us." 
Tight end Anthony McCoy said he believes the Trojans simply weren't ready to play on that October night. lle promised it will be a diflerent story Saturday. 
'The press is going to blow it up, that we're going to try and look for revenge. It will be a little bit of that, but it's just another game, that's what they teach us. We're going to go into Stanfbrd, see signs, 'Hnmember Last Year.' We've just got to focus on the game," he said. "Nothing's ea'>y." 
USC's only other loss la.'it year was a 24-17 setback at Oregon in the final game Booty missed. I lad that been their only setback, the Trojans probably would have played in the national champi­onship game. 
The Trojans have won six straight, outseoring the opposi­tion 231-23 sinee losing 27-21 at Oregon State on Sept. 25. USC leads the country in scoring defense (6.4 points) and total defense (206.4 yards}, and is 25-0 in Novembnr games since Carroll became eoaeh in 2001. 
"The fact that we're coming down to the end of the Pac-1 0 challenge, this is right where we'd like to be," Carroll said. "We're playing for champi­onships each week, and we're going to take it as such and put together a fantastic week." 
months later, and Southern California defensive end Kyle Moore still feels the pain. 
No doubt Pete Carroll does as well, although the Trojans' coach wasn't eager to discuss one of the biggest upsets in college football history Tuesday at his weekly meeting with reporters. 
That's understandable, consid­ering his team wa'i the victim. 
Somehow, 41-point underdog Stanford rallied to beat then-No. 2 USC 24-23 last season, snap­ping the Trojans' 35-game win­ning streak at the Los Angeles Coliseum and ultimately knock­ing them out of contention for the BCS championship game. 
The teams meet Saturday at Stanlord, and the Cardinal (5-5, 4-3 Pac-1 0) has another chance to spoil USC's hopes for a national title. The sixth-ranked Trojans (8­1, 6-1) are favored by 23 points 
a big deal to our guys at all," Meyer said. 
Tebow threw for 304 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 120 yards and five more scores in last season's meet­ing, on the way to winning the lleisman Trophy. 
"I had the opportunity to stand on the sideline and watch him just rip us to pieces," said linebacker Jasper Brinkley, who was injured for last year's 
ing game for all of us. They beat us by 1 point last year, it was pretty much a !luke loss. There are a lot of emotions going into this game." 
Stanford was coming off three one-sided losses entering last year's game, including a 41-3 set­back to visiting Arizona State the previous week. Tavita Pritchard made his first collegiate start against USC as a fill-in for T.C. Ostrander, who had a seizure six days before the game.

These fourth-ranked Gators have already clinched a spot in the SEC title game against No. 1 Alabama, but need to get there without another stum­ble to have a chance at play­ing for the national title. 
No. 24 South Carolina is a 21-point underdog and has never won at Florida. 
"We eertainly go down there with the attitude that we really don't have any­thing to lose," Spurrier said. "We're pretty huge under­dogs, which is OK. but we're going to go down there and pitch it around and line up and see how our defense, our No. 1 defense, ranks against thn No. 1 offense."

Other than that, it will be just another SEC road game. 
"When you're coaching one team, that's where your mind is. Trying to get some plays ready, trying to get your quarterbacks, offense, team, decisions -just coaching a ball game," Spurrier said. "Sometimes when you're coaching a game, you don't even know who the opponent is."

Associated Press 
METAIRIE, La. -Drew Brees could very well set the NFLs all­time record for yards passing in a single season -while playing for a losing team. 
History shows that's a hard thing to do. Then again, the New Orleans Saints have found cre­ative ways to disappoint their long-suffering fans before. 
Brees threw for 422 yards in New Orleans' 34-20 loss to Atlanta on Sunday, which dropped the Saints to 4-5 and marked the sec­ond time this season Brees has

They'll likely have to string together five or six victo­ries in their last seven games to have any hope of a postseason berth. 
At this point, New Orleans has yet to win two in a row, which has Brees feeling a little hollow about his gaudy passing num­bers. 
"I really don't care" about lead­ing the league in passing, Brees said Monday. "The fact that we haven't been able to put two good consistent games together 
in a row is frus­
trating." 
Brees' passing 

Brees has a league-leading 2,985 yards, put­ting him on pace for a record-set­ting 5,309. 
Dan Marino set the record with 5,084 yards back in 1984 with the Miami Dolphins. Second place belongs to Kurt Warner, who threw for 4,830 with the St. Louis Rams in 2001. In third is Tom Brady, who threw for 4,806 yards last season with the New England Patriol'>. 
Surely, everyone remembers where those teams ended up ­playing in a Super Bowl. 
True, all three teams lost in the Super Bowl, but there's a big dif­ference between losing a cham­pionship game and failing to make the playoffs at all.

"As the head coach, I have to be mindful of how we do things and be just as critical of myself as we ask our players to be critical of themselves," Payton said. "We're always evaluating, trying to internalize. We know we need to be able to run the football more, for instance." 
Payton said he intended to unleash a slew of running plays against the Falcons, but was forced to change plans after the Saints had to settle for field goals on early drives and fell behind by double digits. 
Brees ended up with three interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown. The woeful play of the Saints' injury­depleted defense only made mat­ters worse, but Payton was not ready to blame one unit over another. 
"We're going to have to play better defense down the stretch to do some of the things we're talking about doing, but that also starts with us on offense in pos­sessing the ball," Payton said.

FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -Brett Favre gripped the sides of the podium as he spoke, his camou­flage cap and shorts making him look as though he were preparing for his latest hunting expedition. 
Well, truth is, he is. 

This week is the reason the New York Jets brought him in to be their quarterback on that shocking summer night in August, and he knows it. 
The New England Patriots have been the hunted in the AFC East -heck, the entire AFC for that matter -for a long time. Favre gets another shot at chasing down the Patriots in a big spot, with first place on the line Thursday night. 
"I know exactly what this game means, the weight it carries," Favre said. ''I'm well aware of what New England has done over the past decade or so. It just comes down to football." 
He makes it sound so simple, and maybe it is. After all, Favre spent the previous 17 seasons in the NFC, so he wasn't here when Bill Parcells bolted the Patriots for the Jets, and took Curtis Martin along with him. 
son because diet pills they took 
He wasn't around included a substance banned by 
when Eric the NFL. 

Mangini left Belichick to become the coach of red, white and blue demons that have haunted them for so long. 
And with Favre leading the way, New York believes the time is now. 
"To get this win this week," cor­nerback Darrelle Revis said, "would be huge for us." 
Favre has been far from fantas­tic this season, but the Jets knew what they were getting when they traded for him and jettisoned the efficient Chad Pennington. One of the game's greatest gunslingers has been incredible at times ­his six-touchdown performance against Arizona -and incredibly shaky at others -his three-inter­ception game against Kansas Oty. But his presence alone has given the Jets a mental edge they haven't had in years, especially in a game of these proportions. 
"I haven't really thought about it," he said with that big, familiar grin. "That may be true. Then again, it may not be. That may have been why we brought Kris Jenkins in. Let's put it off on Kris." He might be right, based on the dominant performance by the defense so far. But, to a man, the Jets have acknowledged that they never feel they're out of any game as long as Favre 
field, has been his 
most valuable 
addition. 

Let's face it, since Joe Namath led the Jets to the Super Bowl in 1969, this is a franchise that has put its hopes for a return trip on the arms of guys like Richard Todd, Ken O'Brien, Boomer Esiason, Neil O'Donnell, Vinny Testaverde and Pennington. They were all pretty good quarterbacks at times, but none brought the intangibles Favre does. 
Sit in on a press conference with Favre, and you can feel the intensity. He'll look directly into the eyes of his questioner and come back with a 5-minute answer that's usually so good and detailed, it's hard to believe it wasn't rehearsed. 
The players say he's the same in team meetings and even more so in the huddle. Sure, he's 39 now and doesn't have the rocket arm he had when he helped Green Bay to consecutive Super Bowl appearances 10 years ago. He still has every bit of the pas­sion, though, and that has been good enough so far for the Jets. 
Think some of the Packers don't wish Favre was still their quarter­back now? He led them within a win of the Super Bowl last season, and Aaron Rodgers looked good early but he and Green Bay have slumped to 4-5. 
Meanwhile, the Jets are playing their biggest game since their playoff loss at New England in 2006, with a chance to put past failures far behind them. 
"Having Brett speaks for itself," Hevis said. "He runs the offense well, he's a leader. We just let Brett handle what he handles because we know he does a great job. I'm just happy to have him on my team." 
And for the Jets, that might just be enough to help the hunters finally come out on top. 

the Jets, creating a rift between the student and teacher that came to a head with the Spygate scandal oflast season. 
Still, Favre knows of New England's dominance in this decade, with the Patriots 13-3 in the series since the Jets won both meetings in 2000. 
"Until we beat these guys or until anyone beats these guys and knocks them off from the top, then they're always going to be the team to beat," Favre said. "We know that." 
The Jets came close in Week 2, falling 19-10 at home, but Favre was still trying to figure out the ofiense and learn his receivers' names. The revamped offensive line with Alan Faneca and Damien Woody was still jelling, and the defense still developing. 
Nine weeks later, New York is a much different team than the one Matt Cassel beat in his first start at any level since high school. 
"I don't want to say we didn't feel good about our team the sec­ond week," Favre said. "With each week, I feel like we're get­ting better and better." 
The Jets have played like jug­gernauts the last two weeks, blowing away the Bills and rout­ing the Rams by a combined 73­
20. They're off to their first 6-3 start since 2004, lead the AFC in scoring, have one of the league's toughest run defenses and rou­tinely introduce opposing quarter­backs to the turf. 
Now comes the big test for the Jets, and it still comes down to this: They've got to beat the Patriots. 
Forget the matchup with the undefeated Tennessee Titans in two weeks. In order to move for­ward. the Jets must exorcise the

As if' missing Haywood and loading scorer Arenas -no one seems to be sure when he'll be back from his third knee operation in 1'? years ­weren't enough, the Wizards also could be without Arenas' primary backup, Antonio Daniels, against Utah. 
Daniels missed Saturday's rout at Orlando because of a sore right knee, and he skipped practice Tuesday, instead riding a stationary bike and doing stretching exercises. 
Meanwhile, Butler tested some goggles Tuesday to pro­teet the nasty gash that was glued together right above his left eyelid. He was hurt when hn bumped heads with Orlando's Mickael Pietrus. 
"We're going through our pain and agony right now," Butler said. "This is a low. We're going to have many highs this season." 
Perhaps. 
A year ago, after all, five consecutive losses to begin the season were followed by six consecutive victories. 
"I hate to say it, but five games in. we still haven't played with that !'ire and that energy we normally play night in and night out with. That's something that defi­nitely needs to change, and we need to do it as soon as possible," Jamison said.

"Playing with those guys is great because I feel we each bring something different," said White, who is known for his ability to control the puck. "Garrett's got a lot of speed and really pushes the defense back, and Guentzel's got real­ly good vision." 
While scoring outbursts like last weekend's might be rare, Regan said he and his line­mates have come to under­stand and appreciate their roles on the ice. 
"The fourth line is always looked on to be an energy line," Regan said. "We're going to be looked on to get out there and hit and get down and cycle. That's the biggest thing -if you can grind out their 'D' and get a couple chances here and there, you're doing your job as the fourth line." 
The line's emergence will afford Notre Dame's top play­ers additional rest and pro­vide different looks for oppo­nents to try to handle, Jackson said. 
"Our lines are all a little bit different, and that's not a bad thing," he said. "It's good to have different styles of lines -maybe a grind line, a tran­sition or speed line, and a lit­tle bit of a cycle line that can protect the puck and play really good down low offen­sively ... It allows us to be a four-line team, which is our strength." 
Not all teams are as deep as the Irish, though, and many squads use their fourth lines sparingly, if at all. The fact that the threesome has had to compete for playing time has played a part in their devel­opment and improvement as a line, Guentzel said. 
"When we get out there, we've just got to do the best we can," he said. "I know sometimes our shifts might be limited, but if we're given the opportunity to play, we've got to take advantage of it." 
And they did just that over the weekend, Jackson said. 
"There's no question, when they're playing the way they were playing, I have the con­fidence to use them against a team's first or second or third line," he said. "And I thought they did a great job ... They created a lot of energy for us and changed the momentum of the game twice on the weekend."

Then in February, Peters tore her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), an injury that kept her from playing for the rest of the season. Now, Peters said her knee is elose to full strength, thanks to her rehab over the summer. 
"It was rough. It was a tough road doing rehab, it sucks," she said. "If you really are passion­ate about basketball you just gotta get through and keep pushing because you want to still play." 
Peters said the rehab consist­ed of basic exercises to rebuild the strength in her quad as well as stability exercises. She said she would jump off of a chair and practice landing correctly, or jump to touch a backboard and focus on coming down straight on her knee. 
Watching the team finish the remainder of the season while powerless to help, Peters said, bothered her. 
"It was tough at the end when you know you couldn't help your team, and you want­ed them to get all the way and you know you couldn't help them besides cheering," she said. "I knew if I did what I'm supposed to do in the offseason I'd be able to help them next year." 
The toughest part of the ordeal, Peters said, was know­ing her knee was healing but remaining unable to aid the team. 
"Even though [I feltl a lot bet­ter and I'm able to walk and stuff like that, but still not being able to play," she said.

in Haywood's absence 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Editor 
Irish coach Charlie Weis announced in his regular Tuesday press conference that he would be taking over the play-calling responsibilities for at least this week against Navy in Baltimore.

By BILL BRINK Sports Editor 
Notre Dame got a taste last season of what Devereaux Peters eould do, but injury ended her eontributions before shn eould display her full poten­tial.

She struggled with foul trouble. but still averaged nine points and 5.3 rebounds in 20 minutes a game and led the tnam with 45 bloeks.

Fourth liners pulling their weight on the ice 
By MATT GAMBER Associate Sports Editor 

The trio of Garrett Regan, Justin White and Ryan Guentzel may be listed as Notre Dame's fourth line, but Irish eoach Jeff Jaekson is siek of hearing about it -especial­ly after Hegan earned CCHA Player of the Week honors after seoring three goals in two 4-1 wins over the week­end while his linemates com­bined for five assists. 
"Everybody keeps on saying it, but I don't look at them as being our fourth line," Jaekson said. "You've got two seniors IRegan and White I that have both been pretty effeetive players for us over the first three years and a real good sophomore IGuentzel] on that line. I think our lines are fairly balanced -if you look at our seoring right now, it's hard to really say we have a fourth line." 
The line got off to a hot start Friday at No. 2 Boston College, as White and Guentzel assist­ed on Regan's first goal just four minutes into the game. 
Hegan put the now-No. 9 Irish (6-3-0, 2-2-0-0 CCJIA) ahead 1-0 late in the first the
