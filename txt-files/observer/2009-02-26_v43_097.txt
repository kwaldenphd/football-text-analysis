Donating cents makes sense, according to Jeanie Martz, Program Manager in Employer Helations at the Career Center. 
The Career Center has decid­ed to take part in local country radio station B100's "Quest for a Million Pennies," in conjunction with the nation-wide "Country Cares for St. Jude Kids" Radiothon, Martz said. 
"We're all blessed with healthy kids, but there are sick children," Martz said. 
The "Quest for a Million Pennies" is meant to help these sick children at St. Jude's Hospital, Martz said. Members of the community outreach team at the Career Center heard about the program and decided to get involved. 
The "Quest for a Million Pennies" began in January, according to Martz, but the Career Center didn't get involved until Feb. 4. The last day to donate is March 6. 
"We have collection jugs on the first floor outside of the Interview Center and in the lobby of the Career Center on the second floor of Flanner Hall," Martz said. 
Cafe de Grasta, on the first floor of Grace Hall, has also partnered with the Career Center with collection jugs, according to Anita Hees, Associate Director of the College of Arts and Letters department at the Career Center.

STUDENT SENATE 

Affleck-Graves addresses ND finances 
By MADELINE BUCKLEY 
News Writer 
In light of the struggling econ­omy, Student Senate hosted Executive Vice President John Aflleck-Graves to address ques­tions about the University's financial situation at Wednesday's meeting. 
"It is a very tough time for our country and our world," Aflleck­Graves said. "We rely a lot on our benefactors, but our bene­factors fi'ave lost a lot." · 
Affleck-Graves said the University is down 90 million dollars in gifts and pledges from last year's number. 
"This is a very significant fac­networking site, to reverse a change made to the site's terms of use. 
The blog post at consumerist.com point­ed out that Facebook had changed some important language in its terms, which could affect the privacy of Facebook mem­bers. 
When a person signs up to join Facebook, he agrees to the terms of use. In doing so, he grants Facebook a license to his user content. Early in February, Facebook removed the following lines from its terms of use, The Consumerist blog reported: 
"You may remove your User Content from the Site at any time. If you choose to remove your User Content, the license granted above will automatically expire,

tor for us, and we don't see it picking up," he said. 
The University also relies on government grants for research funding and money brought in from auxiliary operations such as the Hammes Bookstore and the Morris Inn, both of which are down this year, he said. 
Affleck-Graves said the University's most critical goal is to continue to meet the demon­strated financial aid need of every student, but he predicted students will require more financial aid next year. 
The University's budget allot­ted $83 million for financial aid next year, but Affleck-Graves

INSIDE COLUMN 
Hello friends=> 
As I approach the last two months of college, my friends and I have been rem­iniscing about things we've done, things we haven't done, and things we didn't even know existed. This will be a very informative col­umn, as, for people who know me, I tend to stay rela­tively active (in between bouts of sloth). So take note: 
Go to Quarter Dogs at least once. And by once, I mean thirty or forty times. A quarter. For a hot dog. Even as a sen­ior I've gone more than once this year. Not the healthiest midnight snack, but delicious nonetheless. 
Buy men's basketball season tickets. This is the first year I've done it and I'm really happy I did. And at the very least, you get a free T-shirt. 
Run the Holy Half. I tried to last year, trained, and then gave up. Because, come on, 13 miles is really, really far. But I commend those who do it and I will cheer for you again this year. 
Do trivia at Between the Buns. For those of age, it is a very enjoyable way to spend your Tuesday evenings; second only to Corby's. 
Go tubing at Saint Patrick's Park. It's only 10 minutes away and the price is right at $3. Since it snows October through March, it's a good way to spend a Saturday afternoon. 
Go to Studabagels. If you've never had it, you haven't lived. 
Paint your body for a football game. While my parents didn't exactly approve of me strutting around in a sports bra and green paint, it was definitely a crowd pleaser and my roommates and I even made it on a banner or two. Note: do NOT use poster paint or acrylic paint. Poster cracks. Acrylic stains. I was blue for three days. Go team. 
Go to Bengal Bouts. This is the first year I've gone, and it's awesome. You can see your friends shirtless, relive your greatest Rocky fantasies, or just watch complete strangers hit each other. And it's for charity. 
Run the Finish on the 50. It will proba­bly be the only time you will ever run out of the tunnel in the stadium. Also, free T­shirt. 
Take advantage of the lakes. Feed the ducks. Run around them. Sit on a bench. Glare on the Dome; drink it in. 
Go to mass at the basilica. Even if you're not Catholic, it's a magnificent piece of architecture and very entertain­ing to look at the ceiling. 
Use a fake ID at CJ's. And don't pre­tend you haven't done it. Because I know you have. And I may or may not have too. Jury's out. 
Go to a pep rally. Not several pep ral­lies, just a few. 
Domerfest. Even as a senior, I still rem­inisce exchanging awkward introduc­tions under the romantic glow of strobe lights. Magic. 
So basically, I guess this is a senior year bucket list. For what it's worth, these past four years have been unbe­lievable and there are things I haven't had the chance to do, but not a lot. Enjoy.

Market warns theif, 'we will get you' 
BEND, Ore. -A sign 
hangs amid the bottles of vinegar at Newport Avenue Market. It's sim­ple, to the point: "Thanks to the Balsamic Vinegar Thief this area is now under surveillance. We will get you." The last sentence, it should be noted, is underlined. For . about a year, a thief pinched bottle after bottle of balsamic vinegar from the store -and not the 
low-end stuff. 
No, this thief was after 
bottl~s that go for $30 or 
$40 a pop. "Thieves with good taste." That's how owner Rudy Dory explains them. 

The store figured out what was going on when the order writer noticed he was buying a lot more balsamic vinegar than what the store was actual­ly selling. The market has quite a large balsamic col­lection, but the thefts were noticeable. 
So the sign went up. 
Passenger douses bus driver with coffee 
LOWELL, Mass. -Police said a bus passenger angry about a possible strike that would disrupt his commute threw a cup of hot coffee on the driver, then ran away with the driver in pursuit. The Sun of Lowell reported that Debra Kemp, a driver for the Lowell Regional Transit Authority, told police the passenger was upset by a newspaper story about a possible drivers' strike. 
Police Deputy Superintendent Deborah Friedl said the man then doused the driv~r with his coffee at about 8 a.m. on Tuesday and took off.

Panel discusses ferrrinist stereotypes 
Professors address gender equality during Women's Appreciation Week 
By MEGAN LONEY 
News Writer 
A panel of four Saint Mary's professors addressed feminist stereotypes Wednesday evening in the Student Center as part of Women's Appreciation Week. 
The panel was made up of psychology professor Bettina Spencer, communications professor Terri Russ, history and women's studies profes­sor Amanda Littauer, and religious studies professor Stacy Davis. 
The panel talked about dif­ferent stereotypes against feminists including that they are all white, pro-choice, ugly and lesbians. Also, that feminism is outdated and no longer necessary. 
Spencer opened the panel discussion with an overview of two types of sexism: benevolent and hostile. Hostile sexism is a term used to refer to the negative opin­ions associated with women. Benevolent sexism is a term used to describe how "posi­tive" associations with women are used to reinforce women's gender roles, Spencer said. 
"I always think of a hot dog commercial when I think of benevolent sexism," Spencer said. "In the hot dog com­mercial, a guy fumbles while trying to cook a hot dog -as though he is such a guy that

Russ followed Spencer's topic with an argument about equal rights.

also argued against the ideas that feminism is an outdated movement and the stereotype that all femi­nists are pro­choice. Davis spoke against the stereotype that all femi­nists are white. Although white women started the feminist 
movement, the things they were fighting for did not apply to African-American women, Davis said. Alice Walker coined the term "womanist" which encom­passes equality on all levels, in terms of gender, race and class. 
"The movement needs to be more than gender," Davis said.

Funds created for pro-life activities 
Special to The Observer 
· A fund has been established in the Notre Dame's Center for Ethics and Culture to support pro-life activities within the University and beyond its campus. 
The efforts supported by the Notre Dame Fund to Protect Human Life will particularly con­cern issues arising from the plight of human life in its earliest stages, from conception to the early days ofinfancy. 
According to David Solomon, WP. and H.B. White Director of the center, "There are currently a number of different forces in the academy, as well as in the broader culture, that make it difficult to focus..on the many threats to inno-· cent human life in the womb and in its earliest stages. 
"Christians thought at one time that they had defeated infanticide and its advocates, and driven it back into the darkness from which it had come, but infanticide now has influential and respectable defenders at the heart of many of our greatest universities. The bioethics establishment in this country and in Europe is largely committed to pro-choice positions and many of the countries that have traditionally staunchly opposed liberalization of abortion laws have changed their position under the pressure of modernizing influences. The current focus in the public sphere on narrowly eco­nomic matters has destroyed the

Charityeventraisesfunds for Riley's 
Dance Marathon committee holds third annual designer jean sale 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's Dance Marathon committee held its third Charity Denim event in the lower level of the Student Center, giving students the opportunity to shop and donate to Riley's Children's Hospital at the same 
time. 
Event Fundraising Co-Chair and sophomore Kelli Minor, was in charge of planning the event. 
"Every time we have it, we raise more money," Minor said. "It's always been successful and really easy to organize." 
For a $1 donation at the door, close to 100 students were able to sift through shirts and the over 500 pairs of designer jeans. Ten percent of each sale is donated to Riley Children's Hospital. 
Since the designs are from last season, jeans that are nor­mally sold startii)g at $200 and up can be purchased at much lower prices. The prices range from $65-$100 depending on the brand. 
Brands included William Rast, -Justin Timberlake's new line -as well as Seven For All Mankind, Red Engine, J Brand and many others, Minor said. 
The idea for Charity Denim came when Maura Clougherty, senior and organizer of the event, found a version of it online last year. 
Charity Denim events are organized all over the country, Minor said. The committee con­tacted Steve Price, founder of Charity Denim, who brought the jeans and other clothes to earn­pus. 
Applications for Dance Marathon were al'io available at the event. So far, the group has collected over 50 names for dance, which will be April 3-4. 
If applicants are able to pro­vide 15 addresses, they will then be given a T-shirt with the Riley Children's Hospital emblem on it. The addresses will be used to send letters ask­ing for donations to the Hospital, senior and Campus Marketing Chair Meg Varty said. 
Varty got involved in the 
group last year after participat-' ing in the event both her fresh­man and sophomore years. 
"I wanted to get involved because it was for a good cause, it wa~ year long, and it is fun," she said. 
Dance Marathon also has activities planned throughout March ·to help raise money for the event. Organizers will be holding Salon Night in the base­ment of the Student Center March 3, senior Sarah Voss said. Also, they will be holding events at Steak '.n Shake and Max and Erma's. Portions of the sales will be donated to Hiley's, Minor said. 
This year, the committee is continuing to raise the bar. "Our goal is to stay above Purdue and raise over $100,000," Minor said. 
The committee also launched a new Web site, www.smcdm.org, where any­one interested in donating will soon be given the opportunity, Minor said.

Group therapy popularity growing 
Six groups are still available for students to join, discuss .issues 
By LIZ LEFEBVRE 
News Writer 
This semester, the University Counseling Center is offering 10 different coun­seling groups which cover a range of topics from eating disorders to alcohol and sub­stance abuse to relieving stress. 
The counseling groups are made up of six to 10 students who usually meet once a week during the semester to discuss common issues and struggles. This setting pro­vides a plaee to evaluate per­sonal relationships and learn new ways of responding to people or situations that may be problematic for students. 
Groups are chosen for the semester based on "student interest and staff expertise," as well as the types of issues that lend themselves to group participation, said Dr. Rita Donley, the Associate Director of the University Counseling Center. 
According to the Counseling Center's Web site, ucc.nd.edu, "The great advantage of group therapy is that you not only can count on the expert­ise of the counselors who facilitate the group but-you also can get to know oth~r students who are going through similar issues as you." 
Although four of the groups have already been filled for this semester, six are still available for students to join, Donley said. Beyond Facebook, Sober 4 Good, Caught In The Loop, Graduate Student Therapy Group, Success Without Excess and Feel Better Fast all currently have openings, she said. 
These six groups are designed for students who wish to: relate to each other through group interaction, achieve sobriety, reduce com­pulsions and obsessions, gain greater confidence and self­understanding in light of adjusting to graduate school, experience legal social drink­ing without risking negative consequences, and improve their moods by reducing stress and attaining better sleep, according to the Web site 
Students interested in join­ing group counseling should contact the University Counseling Center. 
Donley cited the importance of therapy and .counseling within a group setting. 
"I think that by far the biggest advantage of group counseling is learning from oth'ers and being assured that you aren't alone." Donley said. "In group counseling, it's a bit like a learning lab. You are learning how to express yourself and deal with feel­ings as they eome up while learning how to relate with others." 
Donley noted that in her over 20 years of work at the Counseling Center, rarely has there been a breaeh of confi­dentiality from a group ses­sion. 
"Because most students want their own privacy pro­tected, they feel it is impor­tant to protect the privacy of others in the group so that the group can function best and they have done a great job protecting each other," Donley said 
Overall, Donley has found that students have appreciat­ed and grown from their experiences in group counsel­ing. 
"Life is full of risks. You have to decide what risks you are willing to take. The majority of students who have taken this risk have reported to us they are glad they did," she said. 
After fall registration is complete, the Counseling Center will begin working with interested students to 
coordinate schedules for group counseling. Visit the Counseling Center on the third floor of Saint Liam Hall or call574-631-7336.

said he believes this number will not cover the costs. 
"It is definitely a time when the University budget is feeling some pressure," he said. 
Affieek-Graves said there is good reason to be optimistic because the University has managed its money wisely thus far. 
"We have a hi'itory of being very fiscally conservative," he said. "Our operations are reasonably effi­cient." 
The University has four main sources of revenue: 29 percent tuition accounts, 27 percent endowment, 21 percent auxiliary operations, 14 percent research contracts and 9 percent annual giv­ing. 
The University's budget is always balanced, and there is a low level of debt, Affieck-Graves said. 
Also, while most colleges and uni­versities pay out about five percent of the endowment, Notre Dame only pays out about 3.6 percent ­a practice that has been heavily criticized in the past, he said. 
But Affieck-Graves said this con­servative spending approach has allowed the endowment to remain more stable than the endowments at some other schools. 
Another policy that has helped the University remain strong in the economic recession concerns the construction projects on eampus. 
Currently, Hyan Hall, a female dorm, Geddes Hall, the new build­ing for the Center for Social Concerns, Stinson-Remick Hall, an engineering building and the new Law School are being built on cam­pus. 
Affleek-Graves said he is not allowed to approve any construc­tion project that is not 75 percent funded from the start, and the remaining 25 percent must follow within five years or less. 
"We cannot put a spade in 
Student Affairs 
ground until 75 percent of the cash 
is in hand," he said. 
Because of this, all of the current 
construction projects are financially 
stable and will continue on the pro­
posed schedule. 
Several senators asked why 
tuition rates are so high when the 
endowment is stable and producing 
returns. 
Affieck-Graves said the money 
that makes up the endowment is 
given by a donor with the promise 
that it will be used in a certain way, 
and the money is an investment, 
meant to grow, so the University 
cannot touch it, sometimes for as 
long as 25 years. 
"It's restricted money," he said. 
Affieck-Graves said another goal 
of the University's is to bring more 
faculty to campus in order to 
decrease the student-faculty ratio, 
but faculty salaries present a big 
expense. 
"People with specialized skills that are hard to replace are demanding more money," he said. . "People are loyal to their profes­
sion." 
In order to maintain a qualified 
staff to teach the students, as well 
as meet financial aid needs, 
Affieck-Graves said tuition has to 
remain high. 
He said the issue for students to 
consider is what kind of school they 
want to attend. The tuition is high 
in order to bring in top-noteh pro­
fessors to teach at Notre Dame. 
Affleck -Graves also discussed the­current status of the construction of Eddy Street Commons, a center of .commercE) just south of the University. 
While the University bought the 
land, the project is owned and 
funded by a private developer, Kite 
Realty. 
Affleck-Graves said there are 
many leases pending for shops and 
restaurants in the Commons. 
"Chipotle might come here," he 
said. "We are trying to get that let­
ter of intent."·

Both gov'ts seeking aid for rebuilding 
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip -The rival Palestinian governments -U.S.-backed moder­ates in the West Bank and the Islamic militants Qf Hamas in Gaza -presented competing plans Wednesday for rebuilding war-ravaged Gaza, each seeking roughly $2.8 billion in foreign aid. 
The moderates, led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, believe they can raise the full amow1t at an international donors conference for Gaza neXt week in Egypt. The U.S. is expect­ed to contribute about $900 million, and Saudi Arabia has promised $1 billion. 
However, Gaza would need open borders and an internationally accepted government for reconstruction to move forward smoothly. At the moment, it has neither. 
Hamas is widely shwmed as a terrorist group, and Israel and Egypt have kept Gaza cut off from the world since the militants violently seized the territory in June 2007, leaving Abbas only in control of the West Bank. 
Turkish plane crashes, few deaths 
HAARLEMMERLIEDE, Netherlands -A Turkish Airlines jetlinf)r plummeted out of the mist and plowed into a muddy field Wednesday near Amsterdam's main airport, but nearly everyone on board -125 people -survived. The nine dead included both pilots. 
The Boeing 737-800 was en route from Istanbul to Amsterdam carrying 134 people when it suddenly lost speed and fell out of the sky about two miles short of the runway at Schiphol Airport, investigators said. 
The jetliner broke into three pieces upon impact: the fuselage tore in two near the cock­pit and the tail was ripped off. Despite the cat­astrophic impact, the wreckage did not burn and scores of people walked away.

The new manual, produced at Fort Leavenworth and set for release Thursday, also is ainled at protecting soldiers against remote-con­trolled roadside bombs and other nontraditional warfare used by increasingly sophisticated insur­gents. 
"The war in Iraq began to make us understand that there are a lot of targets that we should be going after in the offensive or defensive mode to protect ourselves," said Col. Laurie Buckbout, chief of the Army's electroni<; warfare division in Washington, D.C.

The testimony of Minneapolis election judge Pamela Howell was thrown out because she had supplied materials to Coleman's legal team that weren't given to Franken's lawyers. The judges deemed that a Violation of civil trial procedures.

Demolition ordered for sinking hotel 
FORT WAYNE, Ind. -An Allen County official has ordered the developers of a half-built hotel to begin demolishing the sinking seven-story structure in about a month or the county will do it for them. 
Building Commissioner Dave Fuller said SAMS Hotel Group must provide a signed contract with a demolition company by Tuesday and begin tearing down the structure by March 27. 
If that doesn't happen, Fuller plans to take bids and ask the County Council to pay for the demolition so the demolition can start by March 28, Fuller said Tuesday.

Obama demands stronger regulation 
Possible system would keep risk-taking in check to avoid market meltdowns 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -After devoting money and time in search of a rescue for the ailing banking sector, President Barack Obama on Wednesday demanded tough new regulations to keep financial institutions in check and avoid future Wall Street meltdowns. 
Obama pressed key law­makers to overhaul the nation's financial regulatory scheme to restore "account­ability, transparency and trust in our financial mar­kets." He specifically called for a system that would monitor the risks that insti­tutions can take. 
"We can no longer sustain 21st century markets with 20th century regulation," Obama said after meeting with Treasury Secretary Tim_othy Geithner and the chairmen and top Republicans of the two House and Senate commit­tees charged with writing new regulatory legislation. 
Obama leveled a broad indictment of the industry, saying the current financial crisis occurred when ''Wall Street wrongly presumed the markets would continu­ously rise and traded in complex fmancial products without fully evaluating night, Obama warned that tions, but to protect con­the consumer." their risks."

One of Notre Dame's residence halls has gotten involved as well, Martz said. 
"Cavanaugh Hall is participat­ing by holding a section compe­tition to see which section will raise the most pen11ies," Martz said. 
Caitlyn Dix is running the competition, Martz said. 
The five-gallon jugs were donated by Hawkins Water Tech, Inc., a water treatment facility in Middlebury, Ind., and hold roughly 70,000 coins, or $700 in pennies, Martz said. 
According to BlOO's Web site, anyone can participate, and get a collection jug from the sta­tion's studio. The last chance to turn in jugs is March 7. 
The beauty of this fundraiser is that it doesn't require much effort, Martz said. 
"Just tossing a few coins into a jug is giving back," Rees said. 
However, any amount, and any denomination, can be donated. 
"Pennies are the foundation of this fundraiser, however I heard a rumor that silver is the new copper and we will definitely take any loose change," Martz said. "Oh, and any other cash ... We will turn no coin or bill away.'·' 
This is an easy project to get involved with, Martz said. 
"The simple act of tossing a few cents into one of the collec­tion jugs will help reach the g(}al of a million pennies," said Martz. "We want to see BlOO successfully raise one million pennies for the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee." 

Danny Thomas founded St. Jude Children's Hospital in 1962, Martz said. 
"Danny Thomas' dream was for the cure for cancer to be found in his lifetime. Now, that didn't happen, but wouldn't it be great if it happened in ours?" said Martz.

IN BRIEF 
Florida hedge fund manager caught 
NEW YORK -A Florida hedge fund manag­er who disappeared for two weeks as investi­gators closed in on him can be freed on $5 million bail after being accused of ripping off investors of as much as $350 million, a judge said Wednesday. 
U.S. District Court Judge Denise Cote reject­ed a prosecutor's arguments that no release conditions could ensure that Arthur Nadel would. not flee. 
Defense lawyer Todd Foster, however, said Nadel does not have the $1 million in cash that Cote requires, so Nadel likely will remain behind bars unless the bail requirements are reduced. 
The judge also said four financially secure people must sign Nadel's bond before he can go home, where he would be subject to elec­tronic monitoring. 
Foster said Nadel's friends are "very, very afraid to come and assist Mr. Nadel" because of bad publicity and inaccuracies they have heard about the case. 
Stock market shows improvement 
NEW YORK -Wall Street showed a little resilience as investors got answers to some of their questions about banks. · 
The major indexes closed down about 1 per­cent Wednesday but recovered from much steep­er losses early in the day, continuing the volatile trading that has buffeted the market this week. 
Stocks initially fell on growin!J pessimism about the banking industry and a home sales report that came in weaker than the market expected. But as the day wore on, some of the uncertainty about the troubled banking system lifted when the Treasury Department said it's beginning to "stress test" the banks. The test will use two economic scenarios to measure banks' health, and the process is expected to be done by the end of April. 
The government also gave the market some reassurance by confirming that it will buy pre­ferred shares from banks that can be converted into common shares. And investors found solace when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke rejected for the second straight day the notion that banks could be nationalized.

Dem. Congress approves legislation 
$410 billion set aside for programs, while Bush admin. policies are criticized 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Democratic "control led House pushed through $410 billion legislation Wednesday that boosted domestic programs, bristled with earmarks and chipped away at policies left behind by the Bush administration. 
The vote was 245-178, largely along party lines. 
Republicans assailed the measure as too costly ­particularly on the heels of a $787 billion stimulus bill that President Barack Obama signed last week. But Democrats jabbed back. 
"The same people who drove the economy into the ditch are now complaining about the size of the tow truck," said Rep. James McGovern, D-Mass., point­ing out the large increase in deficits that_ President George W. Bush and GOP­controlled Congresses amassed. 
From the GOP side, Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas said the legislation was "going to grow the govern­ment 8.3 percent ... but the family budget which has to pay for the federal budget only grew at 1.3 percent last year."

normal use of the service, who actually owns the content and what rights does the company providing the service have to the content? That's exactly what's come up in the case of Facebook." 
The Consumerist's Feb. 15 blog post, with the alarmist headline "Facebook's New Terms of Service: 'We Can Do Anything We Want With Your Content. Forever,'" had more than half a million views and propelled coverage of the story by other news media. 
The concern raised through­out the Internet did not go unnoticed by Zuckerberg. The Facebook founder posted an item on his site titled "On Facebook, People Own and Control Their Information" in the late afternoon on Feb. 16. He said the site had updated its terms of use on Feb. 4 to clarify points about information owner­ship. He wrote several para­graphs outlining Facebook's phi­losophy on privacy and why the terms were edited. 
"Our philosophy is that people own their own information and control who they share it with," Zuckerberg wrote. "When a per­son shares information on Facebook, they first need to grant Facebook a license to use that information so that we can show it to the other people

Facebook acknowledged it needed to take different steps to ensure user confidentiality. 
Zuckerberg invited users to join the conversation about the governing documents in the "Facebook Bill of Rights and Responsibilities" group. The new Terms will be unveiled in "the next few weeks," Zuckerberg wrote Feb. 18. 
Wishon said he was surprised by the initial changes to the terms of use on Facebook. 
"It was surprising to find that at least there was an interpreta­tion of the new terms of service that suggested that Facebook was reducing the level of protec­tion, or making claims that they hadn't previously made to con­tent," Wishon said. "I was happy to see, of course, the company reverse that position and change the language so it was more clear what their intent was." 
Wishon said his impression of Facebook and of Zuckerberg is that they are concerned about the privacy rights of users. 
"I think that their prior history has shown that they do have a concern," he said. "There are others that simply don't have that same level of concern, and the challenge of course is for the end user really 'to know, and in fact the end user never knows, 
to ask the right questions, to look for the right language in the end user licens­ing agreement or terms of serv­

In his post, Zuckerberg spoke of the complexity of the terms language and of the manage­ment of the site content itself.

"Being on the waitlist means you're eligible to go, and we have to see how many spaces become available," Opel said. 
The number of openings for students depends on the host university, budgetary constraints and living accom­modation spaces, she said. 
"We want to give as many as possible the opportunity to go to a study abroad site that is appropriate for them," she said. 
For each site, a committee of three people reviews applications and makes deci­sions, Opel said. 
In evaluating applicants, the OIS must first consider the guidelines and require­entirety," she 
said. "No one part is the deciding factor." 
The selection committee then decides which students are qualified, and then, depending on availability, the most qualified students are invited to study at the site, according to Opel. 
Once OIS determines which students to select and where to send them, a list is sent to the Office of Residence Life and Housing for review, she said. 
"They'll tell us which stu­dents they might have reser­vations about or [which stu­dents] might not be appro­priately placed."

TODAY'S STAFF 

Tuesday night, President Obama addressed a joint session of Congress to 
__ put forth his agenda for the coming months and years. The plan was incredi­bly ambitious, outlining not only a plan for a revival of the short-term economy, but also imagining future reforms for education, energy and healthcare and greatly reducing the Federal deficit. 
The first half of the speech was large­ly focused on the short-term eco­nomic woes facing the administration. He explained some of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and lauded the speed with which it was passed. He attempted to explain the government's actions in "bailing out" banks and financial institu­tions, and why these actions were neces­sary for the average American. And he, in his first bold proclamation of the address, urged congress to quickly begin work on a new legislative regulatory framework for the financial system. Even this widely supported endeavor (in this economics climate, at least) will be very difficult to pass quickly or easily. 
Obama continued explaining that the best gifts one generation can give to the next are the investments in the future. With this in mind, he outlined health care, education and energy as the most important investments. 
He began with energy. He noted that in three decades of talking, there has been little progress in energy independ­ence. The stimulus package contains a considerable amount of money for renewable energy programs. Not set­tling, Obama exhorted congress to find him a market-based cap and trade sys­tem that would help make alternative energy a profitable industry. 

In the education department, Obama noted, correctly, that our educational edge has dulled over the last decades and that a retooling of the system is nec­essary. The United States rate of high school graduates has dropped to ninth among industrial countries, and the rate of college graduates has fallen to lOth. In an economy that is largely based on educated and trained professionals, in order to grow there has to be more, bet­ter educated people. 
And finally, Obama acknowledged the elephant in the room in terms of budget problems: health care. Federal health care, namely Medicare and Medicaid, accounts for 4 percent of the US GDP, and is expected to more than double in the next 20 years. Not only did he pledge to lower costs through pushing for emergency medical records, but also in one of the few poorly worded phrases of the night, seemed to have promised a cure for cancer. 
As the speech progressed and grew ever more ambitious, I began to think back to the game everyone played at least once growing up. Jenga was a game of skill, focus and daring. As the game progresses, it becomes much harder to play. Each block that is pulled out is stacked on top, and the tower's integrity is even further compromised: 
Obama built himself a Jenga tower with this speech. He started at the bot­tom: layering bank refinancing and loan help for homeowners with new regulato­ry .standards and job creation. Talk of education reform added a few more blocks, as did that cap and trade energy reform. Health care, an issue that has derailed the two previous administra­
. tions agendas, added an entire midsec­tion to the tower. Each policy goal and specific idea added blocks and rows to the agenda, and as if a very lofty tower were not suf­ficient, Obama added that the deficit 
would be thoroughly examined and trimmed in his first term. This did not add bricks to the tower as much as it limited which blocks could even be pulled. It is as if Obama is allowing him­self only to pull the middle blocks out of the tower. Although this would not be an issue for the first couple of efforts, as the final reforms, laws and ideas are attempted, the tower will begin to sway, and perhaps even collapse under its own weight. So is the case with the Obama agenda. 
It is certainly my hope that Obama succeeds in all of these efforts. Each one is more than necessary to grow as a nation in an increasingly more competi­tive world. But with issues as complicat­ed and often controversial as health care, social security, financial regulation and education, I can't help but imagine that an agenda built on all of these issues is prone to fail at some point in time. 
However, Obama, reminiscent of his own Inauguration speech, recalled moments in our history where great 
,progress followed great hardship. He spoke of the transcontinental railroad built in the throes of the Civil war, and talked about the growth of the public school system following the industrial revolution. He called to mind the G.L Bill and the growth of university level educa­tion following the Second World War. As always, Obama eloquently provided a history of our country and attempted to let us imagine where we could fit in the story. He provides examples where American has risen to the occasisons, and for our own sakes, I hope, in this sense, that history repeats itself.

This Lent I'm giving up Lent 
A few years ago, I asked a friend, who had just finished his dissertation, "What are you giving up for Lent this year?" Still dazed from the research and writing hell he had just endured, 
he looked, slightly  
befuddled, slight­ly angry, at me  Fr. LOL! DeiFra  
and said, "I justfinished Lent.  Faithpoint  
This year for Lent  

I'm giving up Lent!" Seemed fair enough.... 
For Notre Dame and Saint Mary's Catholics, Lent does arrive at a time that pretty much is Lent already ­February, with Canadian winds air con­ditioning themselves over the Great Lakes before barreling into our little Shire. One student coming out of her dorm some frigid morning last week turned and said to her friend (in a great Southern drawl that absorbed and expelled her frustration with a wonderful, comic class) -"Sometimes I walk out here in the morning and want to say a prayer to start the day, but I feel that wind and the only thing going through my mind is, "Girl, what were you thinking coming here?!!" Throw in midterms, no football, no Wrigley, now an economic recession ­and the Church wants to throw Lent into the mix?!! Just what we ·needed! Or is it? 
I suppose if one understood Lent pri­marily as a season of suffering, we might reasonably find that there is already plenty happening in our lives and world to make the season rather redundant. Rubbing in the bad news, so to speak-a bad pun, I realize, after Ash Wednesday. 
But what if the purpose of Lent is not understood to be the rubbing in of bad news, as much as it is a preparation for the reception of good news? What if the end result of Lent is not a height­ened awareness of how grey and cold the Midwest winters, or our souls, are, but the stirring up of-right in the midst of winter -the hope for the bare-foot, Frisbee tossing warmth of the Spring? 
As humans, we find it easier to rec­ognize and ritualize our present limita­tions, more than our future glory. And this for an obvious reason -we live squarely in the former, while the latter exists beyond "what eye has seen or ear has heard." So it is perhaps not surprisingly that we celebrate the 40 days of Lent exceedingly more effec­tively than the 50 ensuing days of Easter. Ask most Catholics three weeks after Easter, "What day of Easter is it?" 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Why everyone alw-ays needs guns 
The other day, a student attempted to enter the home of a 28 year old man. After showing deliberate malice by knocking threateningly at the door, the man reacted the only way he could. He didn't try to see who the person was, which is good, because if you can see them, then they can see you, and, by extension, KILL YOU. Instead, he enveloped himself in complete and utter terror -like he should -and fired his gun wildly through the door. I do have to denounce his'"'aim, however. He only hit the victim, a 23 year old ND student, in the arm, while everyone knows that that won't stop your common hooligan, all hopped up on "mary-jane" and the . "hook-up culture." Instead, it only makes them angrier, which is why you have to aim for the head. Like zombies. George Washington didn't make up the second amendment just be~ause God told him to. He also knew that you can TRUST NO ONE, and must be prepared at all times to unleash a panicked volley of bullets. This is why, whenever any­one tries to pass me on the highway, I brandish my uzi, because I never know when someone is going to swerve in front of me, block the road, bludgeon me with a shovel, and sell my uncon­scious body to Eckerd's Pharmacy for medical testing. This happens EVERY DAY. So, anonymous 28 year old gun­man, I salute you. Keep fighting the good fight, against anyone and every­one, everywhere.

Apologizing in March 
Thanksgiving in February is a wonder­ful event that gives the Notre Dame stu­dent body an opportunity to express their gratitude for the monetary support alumni and other donors offer to the school to make its academic mission pos­sible. 
Nevertheless, I think there is an addi­tional, more important message we need to relate to alumni. It is my opinion that the student body should-on behalf of the University -apologize for the treat­ment to which the alumni have been made subject at football games in recent years. For this reason, I propose a corol­lary to Thanksgiving in February: Apologizing in March. 
We're sorry that you are constantly harassed by ushers and police on game­day. We're sorry thatyou have to watch your step inside the Stadium, not because you're worried about falling and hurting yourself, but because the slight­est slip or stumble seems to have turned into a clear sign that you are intoxicated. 
We're sorry that showing your support for the team outside the student section has become reason to be ejected from the stadium. We're sorry that Cappy and many of the ushers are more concerned with hunting down and turning as many people as possible over to the police for arrest than with creating a safe and enjoyable environment for football fans. We're sorry the essential characteristic for a "good" game no longer involves the outcome on the field but whether or not you end up in jail that day. Finally, we're sorry that some of you had to voice your complaints and concerns on the Internet because many higher-ups here at the University would not listen. 
This list of apologies can go on much longer than this, but I think everyone gets the idea. 
James McCaughan juniot ­Siegfried Hall Fep. 23 

and, especially on the East Coast, they will call you an insulting name. But ask any Catholic how many days of Lent left, and they will blurt out "18!" with images of cheeseburgers and chocolate dancing in their heads. It's just easier, this side of heaven, to sacramentalize our present incompleteness than our future wholeness. 
In my favorite Mardi Gras Gospel­the one that prepares me for Lent bet­ter than any other -Jesus is asked, "Why do John the Baptist's and the Pharisees' disciples fast, but your disci­ples do not fast?" Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, then they will fast." 
I love these words, for two reasons. First, they justify the Lenten fast from Jesus' own lips, which always helps when I am ready to succumb to that Bruno's sausage and pepperoni combo (have you had Bruno's homemade sausage yet-giving up Bruno's home­made sausage for Lent is the stuff of saints). Second, what I like most about this Gospel is that its focus -from beginning to end, from non-fasting to fasting -is the presence of Christ. 
Fasting, this Gospel suggests, is not primarily ritualizing the curse of being ­human, or the extinguishing of our hope. Or, more properly, fasting ritual­izes the temporary absence of Christ ­precisely to ones who have already deeply experienced His presence. And who have been promised eternal life with and through Him in the Resurrection, as inconceivable and dif­ficult-to-ritualize that may be. 
Lent, like everything we do as Catholics, must ultimately be about increasing our awareness of and responsive to the living presence of Christ. In our minds and hearts. In the lives of others, particularly the suffer­ing. In our Church and worship. In our world. In every aspect of our lives. Perhaps we might choose a fasting that will heighten our longing in all these places for the joy and wholeness that is promised us through the presence of Christ. Though I do not recommend giving up Bruno's sausage to the feint of heart....

Health care purpose 
By lumping Grandma's health care treatment together with patients who are in a persistent vegetative state (PVS), Professor Rice misses the point of what's at stake in providing health care treatment to the elderly ("Catholics and euthanasia", Feb. 24). 
Patients who are in a PVS, such as Terry Schiavo, are usually stable and able to stay alive almost indefinitely if they receive food and water. It is only as to these PVS patients that the Vatican has stated that the denial of food and water, even through a feed­ing tube, would be a form of euthanasia. 
By contrast, very few elderly patients wind up in a PVS. Rather, they suffer from one or more PfO· gressive and irreversible illnesses, such as Alzheimer's ,disease, Parkinson's disease or cancer. In .many such cases, a terminal stage is reached where treatment can no longer prolong life or alleviate suffer­ing. 
Nothing in Church teaching, and specifically in the 2007 CDF state­ment, compels physicians or families to continue with a feeding tube or other forms of artificial nutrition and hydration in those circumstances.

Hopefully Dining Hall Dish is doing a good job diversifying your dining hall meals, but if not, don't hesitate to come up with your own ideas. The last thing you want to do is get bored with what you eat; it's a long semester. 
A good way to start is to pick one ingredient you haven't used in awhile and see what you can build around it. And when you're finished? Share it with the rest of us! 
This week's recipes: 

Grilled Chicken and Mushroom 
This recipe requires you to wait for the next time the dining hall does grilled vegetables, but it is a good way to put a twist on some­thing already good. Make sure to use good bread to give it the best start. 
1. 
Pick up two good slices of bread and spread a thin layer of olive oil on one side. Grill in the Panini press until they are toasty. 

2. 
Place a grilled chicken breast on the toast. Top with a slice of provolone or Swiss cheese. 

3. 
Top with grilled mush­


rooms. (If you aren't a fan of mushrooms, try out the other grilled options like zucchini.) 
4. 
Sprinkle some balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper on top of some spinach. Add to sandwich. 

5. 
Close up the sandwich and enjoy. 


Leprechaun Poo Shake 
This is a very tasty-and creatively named-milk­shake thought up by Charlie Vogelheim. Mint mixed with chocolate is hard to beat! 
1. Fill three-quarters of a cup with mint soft serve. 
2. Add  some  crushed  
Oreos and  a  little bit of  
chocolate syrup.  
3. Fill the rest of the cup  
with milk and mix with  a  
spoon.

MARANA, Ariz. Eight months later, Tiger Woods looked as though he had never been away. 
Woods made a tri­umphant return to golf Wednesday in the Accenture Match Play Championship with a start that showed golf what it had been missing in the 253 days since he limped his way to an epic U.S. Open title. 
Just past high noon in the desert, Woods fired an 8-iron into 5 feet for birdie. Then came a gen­tle fist pump when his approach to the par-5 second settled 4 feet 
page 15 

Woods walked onto the tee could be heard all the way down the fair· way. 
Woods hacked off his tee shot, and without much expression, belted a fairway metal down the right side of the fair· way. 
"You are. back!" one spectator shouted. 
Was he ever. 
He won the first two holes before some rust settled in. Woods made three bogeys over his next five holes and was leading, 1 up, until he birdied the par-5 eighth with a 6-foot putt. 
Jones never got .any closer. 

from the cup for eagle. 
He closed out Brendan Jones of Australia with a 3-foot par on the 16th hole for a 3-and-2 victo· ry. 
"I told Stevie I felt like we haven't been away," Woods said, referring to caddie Steve Williams. "It' was business as usual." 
But this was no ordi~ nary day. 
Before thousands of fans who scurried through the high desert, eager to· see every shot from the world's No. 1 player, Woods never showed any indication that he had reconstruc­tive surgery on his left 
knee a week after win­ning the U.S. Open. "It held up," he said. "It felt good." 
Woods said he had looked forward to the nerves of standing on the first tee and the rush of competing. It was as if all that time away from golf had been bottled up inside of him. And then it came gushfng out on a scorching day north of Tucson, where tempera­tures approached 90 degrees. 
Fans packed into the bleachers around the first tee, with more lined up behind the ropes all the way to the green, and the cheer when 

IN BRIEF Brooks Dunn, others 
released by Buccaneers 
TAMPA, Fla. -Derrick Brooks, one of the top players in Tampa Bay histo­ry, was cut by the Buccaneers on Wednesday in a purge of the team's older players. 
Brooks, the NFL's defensive player of the year when Tampa Bay won the Super Bowl after the 2002 season, was among five players cut, four of them older than 32-year-old Raheem Morris, the team's new head coach. 
The others were wide receivers Joey Galloway and Ike Hilliard, run­ning back Warrick Dunn and line­backer Cato June. The 29-year-old June is the only player under 30 and the only one younger than Morris. 
The releases save more than $10 million in salary cap space for a team that already is close to $50 million under the projected cap of $123 mil· lion. General manager Mark Dominik said the o~ject of the cuts-was less to save money than to get the team younger.. 
Rodriguez hits home run 
in spnng training debut 
DUNEDIN, Fla. -Back on the field, Alex Rodriguez was able to put aside the steroids scan­dal. 
At least for a little while. 
Booed and taunted by oppos· ing fans in the Yankees' spring training opener, Rodriguez homered and drew two walks Wednesday in a 6-1 exhibition victory over Toronto that was anything but routine. 
It was his first game since admitting he took performance­enhancing drugs from 2001-03 with Texas. He left after draw­ing a walk in the fifth inning, then signed autographs for five minutes before calling it a day. 
"This is what I do. I know how to play baseball," Rodriguez said. "I just hope that's the start of something really special for this year. I feel really good about our team." 
Running back Jacobs signs
four-year deal with Giants 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.­Less than two weeks after putting a franchise tag on him, the New York Giants signed bruising half­back Brandon Jacobs to a four· year, $25 million contract on Wednesday. 
The signing came less than two days before the start of the NFL free agency period. 
"I was confident all along that this was going to get done I didn't panic one bit," Jacobs said in a statement released by the team. "I know the reason we did it the way we did; I knew I was going to be here. I was super-confident and I am here. I'm happy about it." 
The deal includes $13 million in guarantees. Jacobs will earn $15 over the firsttwo years. 
Putting a franchis·e tag on Jacobs earlier this month guaran­teed him a $6.6 million salary next season.

NFL 
Jets release receiver Coles 

Associated Press NEW YORK -The New York Jets restructured Laveranues Coles' contract Wednesday, allowing the veteran wide receiver to become an unre­stricted free agent when the signing period begins Friday. Coles, 31, was heading into the final year of his contract, but was looking for a long-term deal. Because of the compro­mise between the sides, the Jets are off the hook for the guaran­teed $6 million Coles was due this upcoming season. "I spoke with him today and expressed my appreciation for his contributions both on and ­off the field," general manager Mike Tannenbaum said. "This move will allow Laveranues to explore his options, and we both agreed to keep the lines of communication open." The move comes after a series of salary dumps by the Jets, who have also cut tight end Chris Baker, defensive back David Barrett, and linebackers David Bowens and Brad Kassel!. Coles will immediately become one of the top available f free agents at wide receiver, joining a group led by T.J. Houshmandzadeh. Teams are allowed to begin signing free agents on Friday aC12:01 a.m. EST. Coles caught 70 passes for 850 yards and seven touch­

downs from Brett Favre last 
season. He was a third-round pick by New York in 2000 and played two seasons before sign­ing as a free agent with Washington. After two years with the Redskins, Coles was traded back to the Jets before the 2005 season. "I have had the· pleasure of getting to know Laveranues since he entered the league in 2000," Tannenbaum said. "He is a fierce competitor, a great teammate and a good friend who has always given his best to the New York Jets." Before last season, Coles threatened to sit out during the offseason program because he wanted a long-term deal, but coach Eric Mangini -during a trip to the receiver's home ­convinced him to back off his demands after expressing that he was an invaluable part of the team. The Jets then had the final two years of Coles' con­tract-about $11 million ­guaranteed in a good-faith move. That would've put the Jets on the hook for his salary this sea­son if not for the compromise. Coles told The Star-Ledger of Newark that he could still end up re-signing with the Jets. "We didn't leave on bad terms," Coles told the newspa­per. "It's not out of the question that I could come back." A team captain in 2007, Coles also became a fan favorite dur­
ing his second stint with the Jets while playing through numerous injuries in recent seasons, including at least two concussions. He had his streak of playing in 107 straight games end in November 2007 bl;lcause of a concussion, and was briefly knocked unconscious wh(ln he was leveled by a hit by Miami's Zach Thomas in December 2006. He also suffered a con­cussion early last season. 
·Coles, who had a career-high 91 catches in 2006, has 631 career receptions for 8,095 yards and 44 touchdowns. He struggled to click with Favre early last season when the Jets cut his good friend Chad Pennington. A few days later, Pennington was signed by Miami and led the Dolphins to the playoffs while being voted NFL Comeback Player of the Year for the second time in three seasons. 
Coles, from Jacksonville, could possibly seek a reunion with Pennington and try to sign with the Dolphins. Also, Bill Parcells, the man who drafted Coles when he was with the Jets as general manager, is current­ly the Dolphins' executive vice presichmt of football operations. 
If Coles doesn't return, it would leave New York extreme­ly thin at receiver, with only Jerricho Cotchery, Brad Smith and Chansi Stuckey having played a significant number of games.

the competitiveness side of it. I don't mean on the basketball floor, but from a financial situa­tion," Walsh said Wednesday. "So we're willing to say, 'OK, we'll do it and vou can find your team."' · 
The sides had first tried to negotiate a buyout nearly three months ago, but that meeting lasted just 20 minutes before Marbury walked out, frustrated with the terms Walsh sought. 
Marbury originally vowed he wouldn't give up any of the $20.8 million he was scheduled to earn this season, then even-· tually said he would surrender $1 million. Walsh likely sought double that to let Marbury leave. 
They were face-to-face again Tuesday when an arbitrator heard Marbury's grievance of the nearly $400,000 in salary the Knicks docked him after alleging he refused to play in a November game. That was quickly scrapped as buyout talks began after lunch. 
Walsh could have held on to Marbury through this weekend, making him ineligible to play for another team in the post­season, but preferred to avoid that -if Marbury cooperated. 
"Not if I saw he was making a legitimate effort to put us in the right position, acknowledging our position," Walsh said. 
Walsh, in his first year in New York, acknowledged the situa­tion being a distraction for him, and said he wasn't comfortable being at odds with a player. 
The players didn't have the same difficulties. To them, Marbury was long ago gone and forgotten. 
"He hasn't really been seen in a little while," forward David Lee said after the Knicks' morn­ing shootaround. "Almost some­what of a dead issue for us because we knew at some point it would probably happen." 
Marbury's exit may have taken longer than expected ­there was some surprise he was even with the team when train­ing camp opened -but the Knicks haven't been spending much time thinking about their former captain. 
"It's not like, 'Oh now we can really play basketball, we're not distracted,"' coach Mike D'Antoni said. "We weren't dis­tracted before." 
Nor does D'Antoni have any regrets about the way he han­dled his time with Marbury, starting with his decision to bench him on opening night that surprised both the point guard and Walsh. 
"We said all along, tough situ­ation," D'Antoni said. "We weren't on the same page." 
Marbury is now free to join a playoff contender once he clears waivers, and he's already been linked to the Boston Celtics. Nobody knows how much he'll help though, since he hasn't played a regular-sea­son game in more than a year. 
"We'll see. I don't know," Knicks forward Quentin Hichardson said. "I don't know what he's been doing. I assume he's been working out or what­ever. I mean, only thing I can say is time will tell. Good luck to him." 
Though Marbury had still been a Knick, he wasn't a part of the team much toward the end of his turbulent time in New York.

It was a Jackson jumper that gave Notre Dame a 38-37 lead with 17:16 left in the first half, Notre Dame's first lead since the score was 4-2. And it was Jackson who hit a key 3-pointer and assisted other pivotal baskets that helped Notre Dame build a 65-53 lead with 

and my thing is, I try not to put too much pressure on myself offensively and try to defend well, but today, what helped me out was, I didn't focus on any of that, I just went out and played my game." 
But Notre Dame nearly relinquished that lead. 
Rutgers guard Mike Rosario, who finished with 20 points, hit a 3-pointer to spark a 9-0 Rutgers run that cut Notre Dame's lead to 65-62 with 
2:13 to play. But Harangody and Jackson hit their free throws !,ate to prevent the comeback. 
Senior guard Kyle McAlarney finished with 13 points. Harangody bounced back in the second half to end the game with 20 points and 15 rebounds on 7-for-25 shooting. 
"My shot felt as good as it always is and every time it went up it felt like it was going in," Harangody said. "I just couldn't catch a break tonight." 
Few games are easy in the Big East and Rutgers let Notre Dame know early that -even though it only has one win in conference play -the Irish wouldn't be able to take the night off. In the first half, the Scarlet Knights were able to get open shots against Notre .Qame's defense, which, in the first half, didn't look like the defense that held Louisville and South Florida to 57 points two weeks ago. Rutgers opened a 21-10 lead. 
Sophomore forward Tyrone Nash helped to temporarily chip away at the lead by scor~ ing four points off the bench, but Rutgers was able to pre­vent any Notre Dame run from forming, thanks to a 15­for-2 8 (54 percent) perform­ance from the field in the half. Meanwhile, Notre Dame didn't help itself offensively with seven turnovers, but 
road. 
"We're play­ing for something," Brey said. "There's no question about it and it's a fine line of 'Hey fel­las, this is a really big game' and not getting too tight and tying yourself in knots. At times we did that in the first half." 
Notes: 

uin his postgame press con­ference, Brey said he was a little more animated on the sideline than usual in order to try to motivate the crowd. 
"I was worried about this game ... but once the crowd got going, man, that helped us defensively," Brey said. "Our crowd is loud when we're in half-court defense, especially down there in front of the stu­dents. That made all the dif­ference in the world. I was just trying to get them going and get them up and get them rolling." 
uSenior forward Zach Hillesland exited the game because of an injury early in the second half and didn't return. Brey said Hillesland was healthy enough to come back in the game, but did not want to mess with the rota­tion that was playing well at the time.

Alaska. The Nanooks finished their conference schedule last week, so the Buckeyes can jump them with a sweep. 
That should be easier said than done, though, as they take on No. 7 Miami, who currently sits in second place behind the Irish. The Buckeyes won a huge game last weekend over No. 3 Michigan to keep their hopes for a bye alive. 
Miami, however, won't be rolling over as they have plenty to play for as well. With the Wolverines nipping at their heels, Miami will need at least one win to hang on to the No. 2 spot in the postseason. If Ohio State sweeps Miami and Michigan sweeps Ferris State, the Wolverines will take that spot and be able to avoid Notre Dame until the finals. 
Expect Ferris State to put up a fight as well. They currently sit in the middle of the pack with Northern Michigan and Nebraska-Omaha. All three of those teams are within one point in the standings.

In Tuesday's opening round play, the Belles disposed of No. 7 Adrian (14-11, 7-9 MIAA) 74-60 in a snoozer at the Angela Athletic Facility. After building a 12-point lead only five minutes into the first half, Saint Mary's supe­rior shooting (41 percent from field goal ran~e) and defense never allowed the Bulldogs to sniff the lead. Freshman forward Kelley Murphy led all players with 17 points, while senior for­ward Erin Newsom picked up her seventh double-double of the season with 13 points and 10 boards for the Belles. 
"I think [Adrian] was a huge win for us," Hen le_y said. "It is hard to see a team three times in a season. We did a great job of scoring in transition and out rebound­ing them." 
Saint Mary's will also face the Knights (16-9, 9-7 MIAA) for the third team this sea­son, having handed Calvin close losses in December and

in a loss to Miami Sunday. Junior pitcher Kyle Bradley pitched 3.1 innings and That effort gives Ferris State the opportunity to jump them with a win or a tie against Michigan. Northern Michigan is also in control of its own des­tiny at this point. They need to keep pace with whatever the Bulldogs do in order to main­tain their own point lead and ensure a matchup against one of this season's bottom­dwellers, most likely Michigan State. 

Sitting at the nine and 10 spots, respectively, Western Michigan and Lake Superior State aren't quite out of the mix yet either. Both teams play winnable series this weekend and are oiliy three or four points away from taking over a home ice spot. They will need some help from the team's above them in order to make any serious moves. 
However that middle section shakes out, the 7 -vs.-1 0 and 8­vs.-9 matchups in the first round will be very evenly played. It would make sense for most of those teams to try to maneuver themselves into a game with Nebraska-Omaha, but right now there are too many question marks to figure out where any of them might end up.

January. The Knights dis­patched No. 6 Alma with a 69-41 blowout victory in the first round to advance to the semifinals. 
Tuesday night's victory fea­tured the return of senior forward Marcia Harris, who scored 10 points in only 14 minutes in .her first action since suffering an injury ear­lier this season. Harris is noted for her dominant post play on both sides of the court. 
"Calvin is a very good team," Henley said. "They are playing very well right now with the return of [Harris]. We need to focus on keeping their points out of the paint. They also play aggressive and solid defense. We need to take care of the ball and continue to attack them."

Silent Knights 
Jackson's 18 points push Irish past Knights 
By CHRIS HINE Editor-in-Chief 
On Saturday, Notre Dame was able to beat Providence without much help from jun­ior point guard Tory Jackson. But on Wednesday, after Notre Dame trailed by eight 
·-at halftime to lowly Rutgers and forward Luke Harangody hit just 2-of-12 first half shots, Jackson knew his team needed him. He answered the challenge and scored 18 points to pro­pel Notre Darpe to a 70-65 win over the Scarlet Knights in the Joyce Center. "When we played Providence, it was a reality check for me " said Jackson, who had just two points in 12 minutes against the Friars. "I can't play tight. My team needs me." Jackson, however, had some assistance in inspiring the Irish in the second half. 
Senior forward Ryan Ayers has sparked Notre Dame with a key offensive play many times in his career at Notre Dame, but against Hutgers, it was a defensive play from Ayers that ignited his team. 
With 18:04 left in the sec­ond half, 6-foot-11 Scarlet Knights junior Hamady Ndiaye went up for a shot in the lane. Waiting there was the 6-foot-8 Ayers, who put up his long right arm and plucked the shot out of the air, grabbed the ball and began a Notre Dame fast break that ended with a Luke Harangody 3-point play, assisted by Jackson. The sequence brought Notre Dame within one point of Rutgers. 
"That put us in another gear, picked us up and got us pumped up a little bit," Jackson said. "He had a few blocks today like Dikembe [Mutombo]. He was Dikembe Ayers." 
Ayers' block helped awaken the languid Irish, who wasted little time after that reclaim-

Belles face Calvin in semis 
By MICHAEL BLASCO 
Sports Writer 
Tonight, the Belles could make history. 
A victory this evening against No. 3 seed Calvin in the second round of the MIAA Tournament will give No. 2 Saint Mary's (16-9, 13­3 MIAA) a team-record 17th victory and vault the Belles into the finals. 
While an opportunity to play for Saint Mary's first MIAA title weighs heavily on each player, head coach Jennifer Henley is certainly not overlooking Calvin.

Battle for first-round byes, home ice heats up 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Editor 
Coming into the final week­end of conference play, No. 2 Notre Dame has the top seed in the CCHA playoff's locked up, but the rest of the conference still has some sorting out to do. 
The Irish current conference record is 19-4-3, but the team has won all three of those ties in shootouts giving them a total ol' 44 points thus far. That gives Notre Dame a first-round bye and home ice advantage in the second round. 
The CCI·IA playoffs basically divide the 12 teams into three tiers. The top four teams receive byes, the middle four have home ice in the first round and the bottom four have to fight against all odds to make it to Detroit's Joe Louis Arena for the semifinals and champi­onship in late March. 

The interesting battles to watch this weekend will be with teams on the verge of moving up or down a level in that three-tier system. 
No. 15 Ohio State currently sits in fifth place, but the Buckeyes control their own des­tiny as far earning a free pass to the second round. With 31 points, Ohio State is currently three behind fourth-place
