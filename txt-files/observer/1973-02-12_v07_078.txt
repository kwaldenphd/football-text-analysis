proposed changes. The Univer­sitv's Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships is unable to give incoming freshmen accurate information as to how much money is available. simply because the University itself knows very little until Congress acts on the budget. 
"I feel sorry for the poor kids who are applying to Notre Dame, because we really can't tell them anything yet as to how much money we can give them," said l\1rs. McCauslin. In many cases, the decision of whether or not to attend Notre Dame hinges upon the amount of financial aid offered, so many high school seniors with aspirations of attending Notre Dame are in a quandary. Low­income minority students will also have to look elsewhere for money. 
In the event that the new proposals are enacted, Mrs. McCauslin suggests that students seek loans from their local banks, through the State Guaranteed and Federally Insured Loan Programs, which are funded in the new budget. According to Mrs. 1\lcCauslin, "This program will be the workhorse if the new budget is passed." 
The President's new plan hurts private schools. such as Notre Dame and Purdue, more than public schools because of higher costs, but it is expected to increase enrollment at junior and com­munity colleges. The amount of

by Tom Bornholdt Day Editor 
The Midwest Intercollegiate l'ht>ss Tournament was held in La Fortune Student Center this wt>ekend. Fifteen teams from twelve area colleges competed in the tourney. 
Notre Dame sent two teams to the match. as did Indiana llniversity and Bowling Green. Notre Dame's A team finished in fifth place according to Frank Pilotte. president of the Notre Dame Chess Club. One Notre Dame player, Frank Antolino, won a trophy for achieving the third best board record. 
Indiana University placed first in the tournament with a 4-1 record. followed by Case Western, Northwestern. Bowling Green, and Notre Dame. 
The match started on Saturday morning with the first of five rounds. The last round of the tournament was completed Sun­day Pvening. The complex Swiss System was used for pairing the players. Each player was given ninety minutes to make his first forty~five moves. and then thirty minutes for each succeeding set of fifteen moves. 

Pilotte described the tournament as "part of our personal plans for a bigger tournament." However he declined to specify any details about this future event.

For example, a stop might be located at the library or computer building. Persons wishing to go to the Huddle. Lewis or Brownson Halls. or the infirmary would gather there and wait for their l'scort. The escort would then accompany the entire group to l'ach destination. 
The signers sympathize and understand the rationale for the present system. they feel a "more equitableand efficient way" can be round. 

They questioned "the prac­ticality of such a policy" as now exists. because they feel a woman who had to walk alone, because she could not find two other persons going to the same place, would be an easy victim for one or more would-be attackers. 
The mechanics of the alter· natives are not detailed in the letter. although it was suggested that students might operate the shuttle §ervice. The letter leaves it to the University to determine the feasibility of the suggestions. 
The residents wondered if Securitv has considered alter­natives· to the present system, which is a year old. "Nonetheless," they wrote, "we earnestly hope that the Security pr~sent policy of campus escort, which does not provide equitable protection to the students."

Dpinian A Last Hope 
fred antczak 
When you lose something you love, you find it brutally unjust for it 
not to live on in some way. So this started out as a wistful retelling of 
the Farll~v experience, a strange object indeed for sentimentality. 
Urged on. too, by the Arts and Letters Advisory Board and others to 
make public the story, I hope that Farley's memory and lessons won't 
be capriciously lost. But out of context, the story would sound like 
maudlin archaeology. I feel I should also spend some time musing 
aboJt what a university is for, and measuring that against what's 
happening here beneath the Dome. 
The contemporary ideal of a university is a place whose service is 
to teach us techniques to satisfy our desires. Whether it be a more 
l'fficient way of plundering nature, or a more reliable method of 
modifying human behavior, the university remains a trade schooL 
The dorm is a barracks where the apprentices board, unusually 
conducive to a surprisingly tolerated, perpetual immaturity. The 
unique mark of Notre Dame has bene that what rage in us rose against

opulent of jockshops. With the advent of the services of women ontCJ

we are given another alternative, a distractingly noisy social (sic) life. 
This achieved, we'll be able to choose whether to bury our human 
frustration in either sweat, or in sound-and, when lucky, flesh. Which 
is not an unfair characterization of the liberal bourgeois perception of 
what living is for. 
As dissonant as the cry of a prophet amid the fleshpots come the 
voices of men among us, suggesting that an education of methods and 
techniques doesn't address the fundamental, germane problems of 
living. These problems, they insist, can't be solved by a quantitative 
equation. for men aren't behaviorist slaves, in quivering and 
inescapable submission to their passions. Frank O'Malley and Ed­
ward Goernereach have submitted experimental college proposals 
based on the simple idea that people in college ought to reflect o'n their 
ultimate significance and ends, and that since people are fallible and 
needful, this reflection ought to be done together-t.directed if possible 
by those who've reflected on such problems longer and deeper. To talk 
to another person who is in some way agonizing over the same 
problems that you are, results in a bond between you, just as among 
any group engaged in a common purpose. 
Concretely in Farley, these directed discussions have only begun 
and on a modest scale. Collegiate Seminar was led in closed Farley 
sections by an instructor who also lived in the hall as an RA. This 
arrangement could be done in every hall, to hire a staff of RA's and 
rectors who can teach. Anyway, four sections of Freshman 
Colloquium are constituted in the same way, taught by older members 
of the hall; this forces the issues between the people of the hall into 
conversation, where the arid "common sense" of self-interest always 
seems less convincing and legitimate than when covert and unspoken. 
l<'inally, generous hall fellows led directed reading in the hall. The goal 
was simply a matured ability to talk without embarrassment about 
the more seriou~ problems of one's life, as if one man's experience and 
learning was in some basic way important and related to another 
man's needs. 
There are two difficulties in this increased closeness. First, it's hard 
to be known so well by the people you talk to; you can't bullshit quite so 
easily. so the tendency is to keep out of the conversation, and ner­
vously mock it as a substanceless search for "significance." The more 
matured and complex difficulty is that all the conversers must admit 
their fallibility, and particpate as no more than an equal in the 
reasoning (and justice) going on. Take a larger example: the main 
dissatisfaction with the administration's loco parentis is not that we 
categoricaly prefer the satiation of our whims to being a com­
passionate and contributing human being; rather, what hurts and 
worries us is our leaders' unwillingness to confess their own human 
indigence (a traditional Catholic teaching, remember? Original sin), 
as if they had solved all the radically human questions that, if we are 
to escape an indefinite childhood, we MUST wrestle with. Self ap­
pointed prophets, who rule by force instead of leading by the un­
coercive gravity of what they should merely suggest, really never 
teach (which is a way of saying that Notre Dame, in the measure this 
is true of her, is failing). They merely form habits in the more sub­
missive and slavish, and only make resistant the very people whom 
they most desire to convert. 
Notre Dame has a chance in the coming months to genuinely open some conversations, e.g., the sort of effort that Professor Kerby's letters, which sometimes grace this publication, seem engaged in. For example, read the faculty debate over unionizing when it comes up; excluding the selfishness that sells its loyalty to the highest bidder, perhaps we'll see some real self-examination on the nature of teaching and learning. And thanks to the reasonable questions raised by the latest Scholastic, perhaps Father Burtchaell will enter a dialogue with us about the nature of leadership, and of the role of the moral citizen. Indeed, we might learn as much about Notre Dame as a community if he maintains his majestically intransigent silence. 
But at last it's my hope that such conversations don't need to start on a grand level, that the end of Farley lead not to an interminable condemnation of hall life here to zooish banality, but rather to rebirths everywhere of the idea of a hall as a community-a community of speech. But then, the hope of rebirth has always been the final com­mon hope of every Diaspora, of every human parting.

good playing was not enough 
the ten commandments! 
Santana last Friday night certainly showed how much a band can change when its leader goes through a personal crisis. And in this case. the change was un­fortunately for the worst. 
The concert started out with a big enough bang. that much is for sure. Afterwarming up on some percussion-oriented piece for about five or six minutes, the band went into a barely recognizable version of "Every Step of the Way" from their latest album, Caravanserai. The explosion came atthe climax, of the song and Santana took off. Incorporating a great wealth of new material. a surprising move since the album is still fairly new and the band really hasn't had that much time to ievelop different versions of it. Santana began a jam that was nothing short of excellent. 
Playing to a picture of Jesus Christ set up on a small speaker, Carlos himself made his lily-white guitar cry out loudly. He would throw his head back and hold a seemingly impossible note for minutes, the pained t'xpression on his face giving the impression that not only was the note to go out to Jesus, but his soul also. 
But one wondered after a while. As the 
concert went on, Santana would alternately 
lead his band with an iron hand, stand by 
himself and play to himself or go and play to 
the picture. Eventually, he only went to the 
picture when a spotlight picked him out for a 
solo. Sincerity or showmanship? 
At the same time, the concert itself began to degenerate. The fact that the band members to Santana only and Santana to himself or the picture had

The Ten Commandments, the monumental 1956 blockbuster which only received one Oscar for special effects, makes its television premiere on "The ABC Sunday Night Movie" this weekend. Beginning at eight, this four hour fifteen minute spectacular will be shown in one part. Charleton Heston plays Moses against Yul Brynner <with hair) as the Egyptian pharoah and a huge cast in lesser roles. The parting of the Red Sea looks like dining hall jello but the characterizations and cinematographymake the picture first-run watching. 
Tonight. two pilots will be previewed on NBC in place of their movie. Tenafly is a black cop turned detective. Played by . James McEachin, Harry Tenafly is no Shaft being married and still trying to get out and be a sleuth. At ten-thirty, Valerie Perrine. who played Montana Wildhack in Slaughter-House Five in all of nature's glory. plays "Lady Luck" who happens to bounce on the scene whenever somebody needs help. Of course, if you watched part one of The Longest Day lasLnight, you should watch part two tonight on 28 at nine. 
Another NBC pilot stars Sammy Davis, .Jr., as "Poor Devil" who tries to recruit souls for the domain of Lucifer played by British horror star Christopher Lee. Gino Conforti. who played the barber in Man of taMancha. is cast as Lucifer's bumbling left-hand man. In this ninety minute comedy, Davis gets 'Jne last chance to recruit a San Franciscan salesman (Jack Klugman of "The Odd Couple"). This airs Wednesday at 8:30 pre-empting "The Wednesday Mystery Movie" on 16. 
Wild in the Steets. with Christopher Jones 
("The Legend of Jesse James") and Shelley 
Winters. airs on the CBS late movie Tuesday 
at 11 :ao Why they did not air this on 
primetime hours is a mystery since this first 
run flick is a good film. .Jones runs for become painfully obvious. It was as if the band was practicing and didn't really care that there was a packed house out there watching them. For the audience, the same effect would have been achieved if a movie had been shown. There was almost a total lack of rapport with the crowd, something people come to a concert to get. 
Jn addition, the music, after forty-five minutes straight, just became dull and tended to blur into a vague image of tim­bals. congas. and keybords. Music that was quite refreshing in the ACC after the harder rock sounds of Chicago, The Guess Who and Yes simply becameto much. Nothing was outstanding and very little was different from the rest. 
There were some high spots, however. In addition to the stunning "Every Step of the Wav." the version of "Samba Pa Ti" from Ab;axas was particularly good. The slow build-up to a masterful electric piano solo and back into the gentle original motif was excellently done. Other high points were the finalf', ''Se A Cabo" and the encore, "Toussaint L'Overture." 
The playing itself could not be faulted. Besides Santana himself, drummer Mike Shrieve and percussionist Jose Areas shone. Keyboard men Rich Kermonde and Tom Koster went up and down in quality while they went back and forth, switching keyboards again and again. Everyone seemed exuberant except bassist Doug Hauch. who looked as if he had nothing on his mind except to leave as soon as possible. All the musicians amazed the crowd with th_eir endurance, especially Areas and 
president on a youth vote, gets elected, and decides to put anyone over thirty into concentration camps. . It may sound humorous, but the plot twists into a horror story of politics and power. 
Friday, CBS at nine will rerun They Call Me MISTER Tibbs. the second of the three Virgil Tibbs <Sidney Poitier) films. This time we are introduced to Barbara McNair as his wife, a new locale <San Francisco instead of Philadelphia which was the city he was said to have come from in In the Heat of the Night). and a new murder mystery. It is a good. not\great suspense film. Speaking of suspense, this is "Suspense Week" on "ABC's Wide World of Entertainment" at 
II:30 tonight through Thursday. I shall just list the titles since they are all made-for-TV . 
Tonight, Someone at the Top of the Stairs; Tuesday, The Suicide Club; Wednesday, The Screaming Skull; and .Thursday, And the Bones Came Together. Friday is "In Concert". 
Thursday features the garbage entitled Valley of the Dolls, a CBS repeat from earlier this season which scored high on the ratings. This trash from the Susann novel stars (???) Sharon Tate, Barbara Parkins, and Patty Duke who jumped from bed to pills to bed to make it in Hollywood. Skip it. 
The rest of the films are made-for-TV quickies. Tomorrow at 8:00 on NBC Dennis Weaver stars as Abe Lincoln (to com­memorate his birthday today in case you have forgotten) in The Great' Man's Whiskers--supposedly true--on why he grew his beard. Cute. At 8:30 on ABC tomorrow, The Great American Beauty Contest will air. With Bob Cummings, Eleanor Parker, Louis Jordan and a host of sweet young things, this drama spoofs the flt~sh-tests. And also tomorrow, The Horror at 37,000 Feet at 8:30 on CBS has William Shatner, Roy Thinnes, Chuck Connors, Buddy Ebsen, Lyn Loring (Mrs. Roy Thinnes), Tammy conga player Armando Peraza, who worked frantically for almost an hour and a half, and with the sheer quantity of music produced. 
But good playing was not enough to save the evening for Santana. Though the group played snatches of :nearly everything they recorded <avoiding that disasterous third album very carefully until the encore), in 

Grimes, France Nuyen, Will Hutchins < "Sugarfoot" among other), and Brenda Benet <Mrs. Bill Bixby) trapped in a 747 by an unearthly force. I hope Shatner remembers his stuff as Captain Kirk in his "Star Trek" days, or maybe Thinnes is still battling "The Invaders." Tune in and find out. Playing against that at 10:00 on NBC is "America", its theme this week being "Domesticating the West". Shirley Jones sheds her Marian the Librarian and Mrs. Partridge roles on Wednesday to star in The Girls of Huntington House, the last made­for-TV film about'a girl's boarding school. This airs at 8:30 on ABC.

addition to an unusually large amount of unreleased material, the boredom and lack of rapport, vocals and favorite songs finally got to the crowd, many of whom left before the end. Sad. 
Almost in contrast, Bobby Womack established an incredibly good rapport almost immediately. With a very explosive opening, Womack and his band, F1eace. definitly a band to watch, had the ACC audience wrapped around its collective finger. Womack was a very dynamic person and singer, something that became most ppparaent when another band member tried to sing. Womack showed his skill on guitar also when he alternated singing and playing. 
Peace was phenominal. A special highlight of their show was the second song, a long jamming song with a solo from nearly every part of the band. Sporting a highly infectuous beat. the jazzy number perked up the ACC more than Santana ever would Ia ter in the night. Lead guitarist Mike Something or jOther particularly shone through out the show. 
Other outstanding numbers were a curious version of "Sweet Caroline" and the finale, "Understanding." The only fault of the show was the tendency of Womack to degenerate into screaming lyrics, a trick he doesn't really need. That horn section could also have been put to better use. 
In short, a disappointing concert Santana has quite a ways to go before he gets his band up to the peaks he was reportedly reaching ·before the changeover. He'd best start now. 
Sciences.) Hackman plays a liberal preacher who takes charge of the situation and leads the survivors to safety. 
Ernest Borgnine plays a New York cop married to Stella Stevens, a one-time prostitute. Borgnine is at times a bit over­bearing but he makes a good counterpoint to Hackman. Of course, Miss Stevens is still the fantasticsex-symbol shewas a few years ago before she took a break from films. And, unlike a certain raven-haired sex bomb who just started up a night-club routine in Las Vegas, Miss Stevens can and does act superbly. Shelley Winters turns another great performance as the loving .Jewish wife to Jack Albertson, a complete opposite to her real personality. Red Buttons and Carol Lynley play two lonely people who fall in love and help each other through this ordeal. Pamela Sue Martin, Roddy McDowell, Arthur O'Connell, and Leslie Nielson also add to the excitement. 
And there is plenty of excitement. The Godfather, while excellent, does not maintain the suspense that 'this film generates. There has been only one other film that has kept me on the edge of my seat as Poseidon did and I had read the book to that one before--The Andromeda Strain. Irwin Allen, who produced this film for 20th Century Fox, scored with its special effects, especially when the tidal wave hit and people crashed to the ceiling. I admit I love it. The stars did all their own stunt work, which added to the movie's ;plausibility. One final note to whet your appetites, not all of the stars make it. So, before Thursday or over the breaks at home, catch The Posiedon Adventure.

Pandora's opening today at new location 
by'Mary Janca Staff Reporter 

Due to a shortage of space at its former address at South Bend and Notre Dame avenues, Pandora's Bookstore has moved to larger quarters at South Bend and St. Louis Avenues this weekend and will open for business at its new location today.

ND feels effects of NSF cutbacks 
by Tom Drape Staff Reporter 

Two Notre Dame research institutes will be terminated August 1 due to shifting Federal emphasis in Research and Development and subsequent federal budgetary cutbacks and restrictions for riscal vear 1974. 
According to Dr. Robert Gordon, Notre Dame Vice-President of Advance Studies, the national reductions will have widespread effect at the national, regional. and local levels, especially at colleges and universities. 
The two institutes to be terminated are the Geology Department's Earth Sciences Institute and the Mathematics Depart­ment's Comprehensive Mathematics Institute. Both are under grants from the National Science Foundation. <NSFl. 
The primary impact will be loss of funds for graduate work and research. This will force students to pay their way or seek financial assistance through the Office of Education's general student assistance programs. "The only bright spot in any of this is that only the dedicated student will trv to continue, Gordon commented. 
·The college housing program was also terminated on January 5, 1973 because of the budget. According to Gordon's office, the Department of Housing and Urban Dtvelopment placed what is described as a ·temporary hold" on college housing applications. · 
The budget document said existing 
\. 
commitments under the program will continue to be honored. 
The Budget 
Washington's budgetary cutbacks in Hesearch and Development follow policy directions established last year. Special attention is directed towards research involving immediate returns such as tnergy and cancer and the phasing out of basic. long-term research. 

As Gordon pointed out, the priorities are 
defense and quick-payoff research. The 
rise in Defense and military-related fields 
guch as the Atomic Energy Commission 
will be from 8.9 billion this year to 9.4 
billion next year. The main recipients in 
the applied shor.-term fields are health 
related areas, non-nuclear energy 
research. and transportation. 
The basic research budget is going to 
remain at a stand-still. According to NSF 
figures. it will rise only 14 million dollars. 
Overgeneralizations 
The Nixon Administration argues that, "the general need for a greater number of biomedical research scientists has passed." According to Gordon, this is an "overgeneralization." He feels Washington's stand to be a "matter of judgment." 
The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's budget summary also noted that the scientists are such as to call for them to bear the costs of training them­selves. 

"Again overgeneralization," said Dr. Gordon. "they are confusing the incomes of Ph.D.'s with those of M.D.'s." 
The V .P. of Advanced Studies noted the government's overgeneralization in nursing as an example' of this. Over the last three fiscal years, 1972, '73, and the upcoming '74, budgetary allotments have been cut in half each year, according to National· Science Foundation statistics. The 1974 budget in nursing in terms of institutional assistance is down to 17 million dollars. 
Regionally 
Effects on a regional level are being felt as well. according to Gordon's office. The Indiana Regional Medical Program <RMPl and the entire RMP structure throughout the country will be starting "phasing out" plans for their programs. 
The President's budget included no funding beyond June 30, 1973 for grants and contracts to Regional Medical Programs. Some grant extensions might possibly be permitted after the ter­mination date but only under "special conditions." 
A budgetary reduction from 125 million in fiscal year 1973 down to approximately 55 million for fiscal year '74 is forcing the phase-out. 
Impoundment 
"What has happened," said Gordon, "is that in fiscal year 1972 the R & D funds were impounded, in 1973 they· were budgeted. and now in fiscal '74 they are going to be impounded again." 
Gordon continued by citing NSF figures for budget allocations for National and Special Research Programs, which for fiscal year '72 were 85.9 million, for 1973 they wre 114.8 million, and for fiscal year 1974 it will be 99.6 million. 
"In effect, it's been over 2 years since budgeted funds have gone to Research and Development," he said. 
Impoundment is carried out through the President's Office of Management and Budget headed by Caspar Weinberger. A recent bill introduced by Senator Sam Ervin requires the President to notify Congress when he impounds funds or authorizes the impounding of funds. 
The bill's provisions would further call for approval of funds impounded by the House and Senate and a call for the President to halt it. 
Unexpected 
Gordon and Dr. Frank Kobayashi, Vice President of Research and Sponsored Pro~rams, both agree that they were leary of the new budget before its announcement but shocked afterwards. 
"We had a feeling that he (the President) might do what has happened but never seriously imagined he would go this far," said Gordon. "The national, regional and University impact are still 1to be felt."
