Chile program offers unique perspective 
By SARAH DORAN 
News Editor 
When students participate in a study abroad program, typi­cally the focus falls more on the foreign atmosphere and environment than it does on school work. So while a third­world country may not be the typical place to study abroad, the Chile program's focus on its surroundings makes the experi­ence ideally unique. 
Designed to give students a full view of their six month home, a 5 credit course entitled "Poverty and Development" is offered during the spring semester of study in Chile. The interdisciplinary course com­bines classroom and field learn­ing, taking advantage of the country's particular charac­teristics. 
"Students in the class learn the reality of the country, in­cluding the reality of the poor," said Father Don McNeill, direc­tor of the Center for Social Con­cerns, who, along with Associ­ate Provost Father Timothy Scully, developed the idea for the class. 
Meeting twice a week, stu­dents in the class spend one session doing service in an area of poverty and the other in a seminar discussing their work in perspective of the country's history, theology and anthro­pology. 
In many ways. the class was a microcosm of the Chilean semester. 
For senior Katie Glynn, who worked with a diocesan support group for adolescent mothers and fathers, the experience gained through the class' ser­vice perspective was a central part of her semester experi­ence. 

"It turned into a friendship, as I got to know the women really well," she said. 
But a six month stint in Chile 
.. carinot be reduced to one class, as the program has many other unique characteristics that set it apart from the University's eleven other study programs around the world. Much of this uniqueness stems from Chile's cultural environment. "The culture and openness to others taught me-an incredible amount about the way you should live and interact with other people," said Glynn. "There is so much community 
and family outreach." 

A main ingredient in the country's cultural makeup is the strong influence of the Catholic Church, said Glynn. 
"These values are integrated into the way people live," she said. "The Church itself has such a strong hold on the poli­tics of the country." 
Students in the program, which is in its fourth semester, live with faTJiilies in the Santi­ago community and take class­es at La Catolica, the largest and most elite University in Chile. By living with families of different social backgrounds,

studying at an elite University. and doing service in the coun­try's underprivileged areas, stu­dents are exposed to Chile's diverse society. 
"You see a stark distinction in lifestyle. a lot of struggle," said Glynn. 
Another distinctive character­istic of the program is its cross­cultural immersion program. To participate in the program, stu­dents go to Chile in late Jan­uary, about a month before classes begin in March, and

Akai named Graduate School assistant dean 
ByTOMMORAN News Writer 

Terrence Akai, formerly the assistant dean of the College of Engineering, has been named assistant dean of the Graduate School, according to Nathan Hatch, vice president for grad­uate studies and research. 
Akai had previously held con­current appointments as asso­ciate professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering and associate professor of com­puter science and engineering. 
Akai said that as an assistant dean, he will play an important part of enforcing the Graduate School's academic rules and regulations. He also will help institute a new program de­signed to heighten the teaching skills of graduate students that act as teaching assistants. In the past, some of these students have had difficulties teaching classes due to their lack of training in the field. 
Akai will become one of six assistant and associate deans that work together to run the Graduate School. Together, they work on programs to in­crease the level of university support for the Graduate School, better evaluate the English abilities of foreign stu­dents applying to the School, and help improve the Universi­ty's placement programs for graduate students. 
Akai earned his bachelor of arts degree and his bachelor of science degree in aeronautics and astronautics from the Uni­versity of Washington, and re­ceived his master's degree and doctorate in aeronautical and astronautical engineering at the University of Illinois. 
Akai joined the Notre Dame faculty in 1976 as a research associate in aerospace and me­chanical engineering. He was named assistant professor in that department in 1979 and was promoted to associate pro­fessor and assistant dean for computing in 1985. He then became associate chair of com­puter science and engineering in 1992. Akai doesn't think his latest promotion will be a diffi­cult adjustment. While he says he will need to interact with the various academic departments a lot more, it won't be a big change because "It's still deal­ing with people." 

Scully attends conference 
By SARAH DORAN 
News Editor 

One of the formost authori­ties on Chilean politics, Father Timothy Scully, vice president and associate provost, recently returned from a meeting of Chilean party leaders, political scientists, and government of­ficials. 
Sponsored by the United Na­tions Development Program and the Chilean presidency, the meeting was held in Santiago in an effort to influ­ence incipient legislation on the regulation and function of political parties in Chile. 
What characteristically was the oldest and strongest democracy in Latin America, said Scully, the 1973 coup and subsequent 17 year reign of Gen. Augusto Pinochet left the country in a authoritarian spin that only recently came to an end with the 1989 return to democracy. 
As the democracy strives to regain full power, it is ham­pered by electoral legislation written during the Pinochet era that creates a binomial electoral system favoring a second majority; namely, it favors Pinochet supporters. Chile has a multi-party system. 
"Pinochet wrote the legisla­tion so he could be a part of the new democratic leader­ship," said Scully. "It is a set of legislative underpinnings that make it difficult to return to a full democracy."

Let's get a few things straight 

"Where did you end up,_______ going to college?" A male classmate of mine asked me when I returned home for the summer. "Saint Mary's," I answered. "Oh, Saint Mary's of Winnona is supposed to have a great campus," he stated. "No, I'm sorry. I go to Saint Mary's at Notre Dame," I replied. "But," he hesitated, "Isn't that an all girls school?" He gathered up sympathy for me as if I had 'ust told him I contracted herpes. I wondered · he planned to give me a hug and tell me every­thing was going to be okay. Before I could answer, he cut me off and said, "It's not really an all girls school. Notre Dame is right across the street." This perception is completely false. Regardless of our location to Holy Cross and Notre Dame, Saint Mary's is an all women's col­lege. To settle some confusion, Saint Mary's is not directly affiliated with Notre Dame but is an independent institution. Saint Mary's students qualify for season football tickets, are invited to 'oin Notre Dame clubs and organizations, and are permitted to take classes at Notre Dame. It's difficult to imagine someone choosing a single-sex college, especially after attending a coed high school. I honestly cannot explain the exact reason why I enrolled at Saint Mary's. But I do remember the rainy night I visited as a high school senior. I joked with my friend in the bathroom stall about coming here. "Like we would actually want to go to school here" were our exact pessimistic words. However, the next day when the sun came out I experienced a feeling I could not explain. A sense of belonging. My roommate and I still joke about that evening. Don't get me wrong, nothing could have pre­pared me for the drastic absence of men. I sin­cerely felt like I entered a bad episode of the Twilight Zone. There is nothing I can say to prepare anyone (especially freshman) for the change of atmosphere. Believe me, it even gets scarier when the lack of men becomes com­pletely normal. Freshman, if you are asking yourself the familiar "Why am I here?" question, do not feel alone. It is time to start appreciating some o the light hearted bonus' of going to an all women's college. I hope female Notre Dame students can relate to a few of these: All the bathrooms are pink. Never running out of Jolene. Having a larger clothes selections than Nordstroms. Never running into your ex-boyfriend on cam­pus. You can lay on the front lawn in your bikini. (Well, I don't. But some people actually do.) Everyone else is on a diet, too. You are looked at as a Goddess when you 
~~am~ooc~~.~~~ws~mfu~r. 
You won't have any problem finding a boyfriend, because any male looks remotely attractive to you. 
So, the next time someone asks you, "Isn't that an all girls school you go to?" You can reply, "No, I go to an all women's college."

Man, teenager arrested in multi-state violent crime spree 

S. Africa equalizes social services 
CAPE TOWN 
The government announced new spending plans Tuesday in its cornerstone program to help bridge the economic gap between South Africa's blacks and minority whites. A range of projects, including free school lunches for needy children and installing run­ning water in rural black communities, were unveiled at a news conference by Jay Naidoo, the Cabinet minis­ter charged with implementing the program. President Nelson Mandela, the country's rrrst black president, has pledged to spend $714 million this fiscal year on health, housing and education. Spending will increase each of the next five years, and is expected to reach at least $10 billion. Private and foreign contributions also are being sought. Pregnant women and children under 6 years old are already eligible for free medical care under a program decreed by Mandela after taking office in May. 
Men score higher on MCATS 
CHICAGO 
White men score higher than women of all races on the science exam medical students must take to become licensed doctors, and a researcher said cultural obsta­cles faced by women may help explain why. In a study of more than 10,000 medical students, white men gen­erally did better on the test than all women, even after discounting for differences in their undergraduate edu­cation and in scores on medical entrance exams. White men also did better than men from other racial groups. with Asian-Pacific Islanders being the only group where the difference was not explained by differences in prior education, researchers reported in Wednesday's issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association. The findings suggest three possibilities: the test is flawed in some way; the students had some prior edu­cational differences that researchers couldn't detect; or the lower-scoring groups were in fact deficient in the subjects on which they were tested, said an editorial accompanying the study. 
GAO justifies more milita~ cuts 
ASHINGTON 
The Pentagon's operating budget could be cut by $4.5 billion next year without harming overall military readiness, a congressional report concluded Tuesday. In a broad array of military activities from pilot training to commissaries to the management of spare parts, the military could get along with less than President Clinton requested, said the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. Clinton requested $82 billion for military operations and maintenance in his fiscal 1995 budget, an increase over this year of $5.3 billion. The House defense appropriations bill cuts that increase by $1.9 billion while the Senate comes in $566 million below the administration request. In any case, the GAO study indicates that both Congress and the Clinton administration are requesting too much. More than half the cuts could be achieved by reducing Army operations accounts by $2.4 billion, the GAO said. The Air Force request is too high by $1.16 billion and civil­ian Defense Department accounts could be cut by $690 million, it said. Navy budget requests are a compara­tively small contributor to the problem, accounting for $274 million in excess, it said. 
Box offices earn record amounts 
_ LOS ANGELES 
In a record-breaking summer, two Hollywood studios outguessed the rest in the yearly big-money box office gamble. Disney and Paramount dominated by grabbing 
42.6 percent of the $2.2 billion spent on 1994 summer movies, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Their two blockbusters, "The Lion King" and ''Forrest Gump," brought in more than half of their whopping $937.2 million combined take. Disney's summer totals: $444 million, a smashing 13 percent above the previous studio record, $393 million earned by Warner Bros. in 1989. Paramount's other successes include "Clear and Present Danger," which was No. 3 over the weekend with $9.3 million and had an $86 million total. The summer's $2.2 ·billion total broke the previous record of $2.1 billion set just last year. Much of the summer's success came because popular films dribbled out week by week, always offering something fresh for cinema­hungry audiences.

Abortion compromise expected 
By RITA BEAMISH Associated Press CAIRO 
Delegates at the l(.N. popula­tion conference made a break­through Tuesday night on the heated issue of abortion, but the Vatican refused to go along with the compromise. 
The abortion debate has en­tangled efforts to draft a 20­
Un1vers1ty of Notre Dame International Study Program at 

year plan to slow the world's population growth. The hard­fought negotiations Tuesday dealt with a single paragraph in the 113-page draft report.

The United States supports the compromise, while the Eu­ropean Union, Norway and Sweden said it was the "rock bottom" of what they would ac­cept, Harwood said. Iran, Pak­istan and Benin, which previ­ously sided with the Vatican, accepted the language. 
The compromise paragraph would urge all governments to deal with the health impact of unsafe abortion as a major pub­lic health concern.

IRA truce discussed . 
By ROBERT BARR 
Associated Press 

DUBLIN After their first face­to-face meeting, Ireland's prime minister and the leader of the IRA's political partner made a joint commitment Tuesday to "peaceful methods of resolving our political prob­lems." 
The talks angered Protestants and got a cool response from Britain, where Prime Minister John Major also had a run-in with hard-line Protestant leader Ian Paisley. Paisley 
accused Major of .. shouting and 
interrupting" him during the 
10-minute meeting. 
The two sessions mirrored 
divisions over bringing peace to 
Northern Ireland despite a 
cease-fire declared by the Irish 
Republican Army, which has 
been fighting to end British rule 
of the province. 
In Dublin, Prime Minister Al­bert Reynolds and Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said they were ..totally and abso­lutely committed to democratic and peaceful methods of resolv­ing our political problems." They stopped short of stipulat­ing a permanent cease-fire, as demanded by Major. 
The British prime miP.ister abruptly left a meeting in Lon­don with Paisley after the Northern Ireland politician re­fused to say he believed Major's pledge that there had been no secret deals with the IRA. 
Paisley, leader of the small Democratic Unionist Party, said Major shouted at him, .. 'Get out of this room. Never come back until you're prepared to say I speak the truth.' 
··1 wonder how many mem­bers of Parliament could stand up and say they believe every word that John Major speaks," Paisley told reporters.

spend a few weeks in rural Southern Chile in a number of activities, including a 10 day experience with the Mapuche Indians. 
After a pilot experiment with the immersion last spring, this spring the program will be led by two missionaries, who are Notre Dame alumni, in con­junction with the Maryknoll Missionaries of Chile. 
" It's an opportunity to learn about a whole other dimension of Chile," said Father McNeill. "Students are free to explore the beauty of Southern Chile before beginning their aca­demic year." 
The immersion will be run much like the Washington and Appalachia Seminars of the Center for Social Concerns, as the students will receive one credit for participating and completing a reflection paper on the experience. 
An information session will held about the Chile program tonight at 7 p.m. in room 116 O'Shaugnessy Hall. The pro­gram is run in conjunction with the Universities of Wisconsin and Michigan. For more infor­mation, contact Isabel Charles, director of International Study abroad programs or Professor Ivan Jaksic, who helped orga­nize the program at the University of Wisconsin.

So as the electoral legislation 
continues to hamper a return 
to full democracy, Scully's 
recent meeting was a forum to 
explore viable options for leg­
islative change. The meeting 
was called by Eduardo Frei, 
the President of Chile whose 
centrist Christian Democratic 
Party is most avidly attempting 
to change the legislation. 
Adressing participants dur­
ing the meeting's concluding 
session, Scully warned that any 
change to electoral law be 
made coherently, citing recent 
piecemeal changes in term lim­
its that have created non-con­
current party elections. 
"Any changes must be made as affecting the whole system," he said. 
Also as changes are made, the political parties must be careful in advance of the coun­try's political sentiment, Scully said. 
"Pincohet is slowly disappearing from the political system -he no longer has the gravity of before," he said. "Chile needs a new agenda to change its identity." 
As part of the parties' oppor­tunity to create this new iden­tity, Scully warned that the centerist Christian Democrats must take advantage of this time to construct an identity, lest they risk becoming irrele­vant. While a return to authoritarianism is very unlikely, the party must take up issues that are of concern to Chilean voters today, he said. These issues include morality, poverty, environment, and the rights of indigenous people. 
In addition to his duties as associate provost, Scully is an associate professor of govern­ment and international studies ~ and a fellow in the Kellogg In­stitute. A specialist in Latin American politics and institu­tions, he was associate pastor of Cristo Nuestro Redentor, a parish in Santiago, from 1980­83 and was vice rector of St. George's College there from 1981-83. He has been director of Latin American studies at Notre Dame since 1991 and has written on the role of polit­ical parties in transitions to democracy, the Catholic Church in Latin America, and the development of political party systems.

The Irish beat the Wildcats in the preseason last year and are putting a lot of weight on this game. 
"It's important that ·we win this game," added Berticelli. "We have to bounce back and play well. It's important that we open the home season with a win."

This is the first ever time the two teams have met, adding a shred of uncertainty to tonight's match. However, that is not to say that the Irish will be unprepared when they take the floor. Coach Debbie Brown has made sure of that. 
"They are a very versatile, well-coached team," said Coach Brown. "They play smart and really understand and execute the concepts of

With five straight victories and ranked 13th in the coun­try, complacency could easily set in. 
However, with Georgia Tech up next, the Irish have no time to bask in the glory of their early season success. This game is just what is needed, a tough opponent who should provide a test of the team's ability. 
"It will definitely be more of a match than we've had in the first five," said Coach Brown. "Georgia Tech will not fold if they get down early. It should be very com­petitive."

Dusty Zeigler. Both were counted on heavily in the pre­season and showed they were capable of performing. 
"Brian Magee being a free safety has got to be the focal point of your defense," noted Holtz. "He has got to make all the adjustments, the calls and be able to play the run, the pass, and play centerfield. I think he has done very well. He really played well last week. I just thought he has come of age." 
Praise of Zeigler wasn't as extensive, but just as strong. 
"Dusty Zeigler played an out­standing footabll game. I think that guy is going to be an excellent offensive lineman." 
Holtz still offered plenty of his usual worries. Here's two of his major concerns. ,... 
"We had 13 penalties and many of them were foolish." 
"I was diappointed with the way we did some things on de­fense. Northwestrern con­trolled the ball against us." 
But one thing to keep his mind. Holtz is best in big games, and Saturday undoubt­edly qualifies. And he knows it. 
"Playing Michigan has always been very, very special. It is a great rivalry. I remember ev­ery game I have coached in against him." 
What will be memorable about this Saturday?
