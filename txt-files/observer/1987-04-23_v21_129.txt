A student's guide to better campus housing 
As the semester draws to a close, it's time for An Tostal and approaching finals. But there is another rite of spring that does not get nearly as much attention: room picks. 
In every dorm, the process of room selection is looming large on the horizon. But did you ever wonder how you got in the dorm you are living in now? 
For most people, the dorm in which they pres­ently reside is the same dorm they received from the Office of Student Residences as a freshman. 
According to that office, the confirmation cards from admissions are sent up in June. Going by confirmation date, students receive their first choice. If the first choice cannot be met, the office then goes to the second choice. 
Mter that, the process becomes much more subjective. Looking for patterns in the first and second choice, Student Residence tries to fit the student in an appropriate dorm. 
Eventually, however, it becomes a matter of just trying to find a space for the incoming freshman. 
Mter I decided to come to Notre Dame, I looked at the nice little pamphlet provided by admission. Unfortunaely, "A Student Guide to Campus Housing," wasn't very helpful in se­lecting a dorm. Discouraged, I just left the space blank, trusting in Divine Providence to pick the right dorm for me. 
Well, I wouldn't trade my experiences for the world, but I really do think there is a better way. 
First, let's cut the nonsense and stop pretend­ing prospective freshman have any idea where they want to live and the "Student Guide" is any help. 
That's what campus visits are for right? 
Wrong. 
I had the oppportunity to host a prospective freshman a couple of weekends ago. He enjoyed his stay here and wants very much to return to Notre Dame next August. 
When it came to which dorm he was going to put down, he said he would probably put down my dorm. When I asked him why, he said it was mostly because it was the dorm he had stayed in. 
It has been my experience that most of the people who visit campus have much the same story. They put down the dorms in which they have stayed. 
A better solution would be something similar to what Harvard does. 
Let's put all of the freshman together in one place. The Mod Quad with Grace, Flanner, the Pasquerillas and the new women's dorms could be used for that purpose. 
Mter the end of the freshman year, Harvard has a lottery for halls, with each person receiv­ing his dorm by chance. 

Some people might disagree with that sys­tem. A better idea, at least to me, would be for students spend their freshman year checking out the dorms and then putting in requests for a dorm. For the more popular halls, a lotterycould then be used. 
Sounds unfair? 
How fair is the system we are using now? Besides, most dorms use a lottery for room picks indicating some credibility exists to a pure chance system. 
What about the "fraternity" atmosphere of the dorms, won't that be ruined? No, if anything it will be improved because now students could make an informed choice about where they want to live. 
An added advantage is the fostering of class unity, since all freshman would be together. 
Not everyone will be pleased by my proposal, but not everyone is pleased now. Look at the number of women desiring to transfer into Howard. 
The system as it exists presently is just not adequate. At a university where residentiality is as important as it is here at Notre Dame, it just does not make sense to ask some beleaguered high school senior to choose where he wants to live for the next four years on the basis of some 75 word blips in a pamphlet.

Farley rector nteets challenge 
By REGIS COCCIA Assistant News Editor 
Sister Mary Jane Griffin, Farley Hall rector, was recently named the first female rector of Howard Hall. She will assume her role as Howard Hall rector in the fall. 
Griffin, who will be succeeded as Farley Hall rec­tor by Breen-Phillips Hall As­sistant Rector Sister Mary Louise Gude, looks forward to her new position after serving in Farley for three years. 
"I'm happy about going to Howard and looking forward to creating a new spirit in the dorm," Griffin said. Although she is excited about the new challenge of being a rector at Howard, Griffin said she will miss Farley. 
"I love Farley. I love the wo­men here," Griffin said. "I told them part of the reason I was open to going to Howard was because the relationship I've had with them was a positive one," she said. 
Griffin said she hopes to build unity in Howard Hall through her involvement with the resi­dents. "Your first job as rector 
wow 

. 
is to help others gel involved in each other's lives and form relationships," said Griffin. 
"We're starting with a whole new group of people," Griffin said. "There's a lot of people to draw upon their gifts," she said. 
Griffin said she did not apply for the job as Howard Hall rec­tor but was appointed to that position by the Office of Student Affairs. "I was asked to do it," she said. "It was an invitation to take it." 
Plans for residence life in Howard are still being dis­cussed, Griffin said. "I've just begun to meet with my RAs for next year. We're beginning to plan together." 
Lisa Buonaccorsi, a Lewis Hall junior, will be working closely with Griffin as a resi­dent assistant in Howard next year. "It's going to be a diffi­cult task for us RAs because we're going to be doing every­thing," Buonaccorsi said. 
"We're starting from ground zero, really," Buonaccorsi said. "It's a real positive op­portunity to build dorm spirit and everything," she said. "It's going to depend a lot on the girls living there next year." 

Living in a former men's dorm will present a challenge to Howard residents next year, Buonaccorsi said. "It's definitely more of a chal­lenge," said Buonaccorsi. "There's nothing to go on. Our input is essential. Everything girls in the dorm do is going to mean a lot. Everything's going to count," she said. 
Farley Hall Co-President Susan Coene said Griffin will be challenged to continue the traditions in Howard that she helped found in Farley. "(Sister Mary Jane) has a lot 
of work to do to establish tradi­tions and turn the dorm around," Coene said. "At Far­ley she's had Pop Farley and the unity and spirit and close­ness of the girls," she said. 
"(Sister Mary Jane) really cared about Farley. I can tell she's really excited about leaving. One of her duties as a Franciscan sister was to be available to need," Coene said. "Howard was in need of a rectress so she felt it was her duty to go," she said.

Congress accused of 'nteddling' in talks 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-U.S. arms control director Kenneth Adel­man accused Congress on Wed­nesday of meddling in missile­reduction talks with the Soviet Union and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev of back­tracking on removing Soviet rockets from Asia. 
"I think one of the big threats hanging over the horizon of arms control is the action of the Congress on arms control," Adelman said at a news confer­ence. "If the Congress is going to proceed to tie the president's hand instead of strengthening his hand it's going to hurt us in negotiations." 
Turning to Gorbachev, the U.S. official said the Soviet leader's proposal Tuesday for a separate treaty to curb shorter-range missiles was un­acceptable. 
Adelman said Gorbachev had agreed with Secretary of State George Shultz last week in Moscow that limits be placed simultaneously on missiles both in Europe and in Asia. 
"It made no sense to have separate limitations," Adel­man said. "The Soviets and Mr. Gorbachev himself agreed with Secretary Shultz that there had to be global limits." 
Adelman said Congress should get behind U.S. policy, which seeks deep reductions in American and Soviet missiles, "and not try to subvert it." 

Poland protests spying 
Asociated Press 
WARSAW, Poland -Poland on Wednesday accused a U.S. diplomat of spying and said he left the country after police caught him trying to pass a briefcase filled with money, se­cret codes and maps to a Polish contact. 
Government spokesman Jerzy Urban, in announcing the accusation at a news confer­ence, played a videotape of the diplomat's rendezvous and subsequent detention and showed espionage-related ma­terials allegedly found in his possession. 
Urban said a "sharp protest" was lodged with U.S. embassy officials Tuesday. 
He identified the diplomat as Albert Mueller, a second sec­retary in the political section, and said he had gathered infor­mation on Soviet and Polish military planning and con­sulted members of the political opposition.

Violence resu~nes in South Africa 
Associated Press 

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -Police shot six blacks to death Wednesday during street battles that began after the government-owned rail­road fired 16,000 striking black workers, officials reported. 
They said the violence oc­curred at a Johannesburg rail­road station and union build­ings in Johannesburg and Germiston, a suburb 22 miles southeast of the city. 
The government Bureau for Information said three people were killed and five wounded in downtown Johannesburg when police opened fire when four officers were attacked by 
a  crowd.  It  said  three  
policemen were  seriously in­ 
jured.  

The fighting was the worst in Johannesburg since the white government imposed a nation­wide state of emergency-June

Photographer Juhan Kuus said he saw 50 black men car­rying axes and clubs march a half-mile to the Doornfontein railroad station from the headquarters building of the 600,000-member Congress of South African Trade Unions. The federation's affiliate in­clude the South African Rail­way and Harbor Workers Union, which has led the 6­week-old strike. 
Kuus said that officers blocked the marchers and that a white police major who tossed a tear gas canister was thrown up against a wall, beaten and stabbed. Police responded with gunfire, he said, and he later saw at least three dead strikers and four

Many blacks serve as police officers in South Africa, but most of those involved in Wed­nesday's violence were white. 
Witnesses said some injured strikers headed back to the union building after the shoot­ing at the railroad station, fighting police as they went. A 
white  policeman  with  a  
bloodied  head  ran  from  the  
gang,  dodging  between  ar­

ND professor heads excavation in Italy 
By JIM RILEY News Editor 
A Notre Dame professor will lead an archeological excava­tion in southern Italy this sum­mer. 
Paolo Visona, assistant pro­fessor of classics, said he will run the project as a field school, allowing Notre Dame students the opportunity to receive some training in ar­cheological techniques and possibly earn course credit. 
The excavation will involve a Greek City which dates to the second or third century B.C. 
The project will begin on May 25 and will last "a good six weeks," said Visona. 
This is the first time Notre Dame has been involved in an archeological expedition in southern Italy, he said. The lo­cation of the site is Oppido­Mamertina, which is located 50 miles north of Peggio Calabria, a town near the southern tip of Italy. 
He said he is planning to in­vestigate the site dur:i!'!t;:.: !~=-~~ year period. The excavators know they will be excavating a portion of a city block the first year. "This year promises to be one of the most interesting because we will be dealing with a residential area," Visona said. 
"It seems the site was aban­doned for unknown reasons in the second century B.C.," he said. He did note that the site 
is in an area of high seismic 
activity. 
He said the goal is to 

reconstruct the internal or­
ganization of the site to find out 
if it followed a city plan. 
Next year, the group plans to 

explore a citadel on top of the 
hill which overlooks the 
modern-day city built near the 
site. The citadel was built on 
top of the hill for defense pur­
poses. On the other side of the 
hill is a medieval ghost town. 
In the last season of the ex­

cavation, the excavators will 
investigate the defensive 
perimeter of the city, accor­
ding to Visona. 
Visona said he has has ex­

cavated previously in Italy, Is­
rael and Carthage. 
He said about 12 students have signed up so far, but there are still openings in the pro­grams for interested Notre Dame students. Students from Cornell, the University of Vir­ginia and other schools have already joined the group. 
y 1~ona said there will be three excavation sessions, each lasting two weeks. He said that because he is running the excavation as a field school, students may be able to earn three credit hours for each ses­sion in which they participate. 
Visona said he was "more or less shopping around for a site" in the area because he is inter­ested in the Second Punic War and particularly in Hannibal.

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka-Gov­ernment planes bombed Tamil rebels and the guerrillas at­tacked soldiers Wednesday, adding more than 100 dead to a toll that has reached nearly 400 in six days of civil war. 
The attacks by both sides came a day after a car bomb tore Colombo's main bus sta­tion apart, killing at least 106 people and woundiniJ 1195. 
The government said 80 Tamil rebels were killed in an air raid. A military source re­ported at least 36 soldiers and police slain in guerrilla raids and said eight rebels were killed. 
Government and military figures put the death toll since Friday at 374 on this island off India's tip, where Tamil ex­tremists have fought the Sin­halese majority for a separate nation since 1983.

LaRouche accused of siphoning ntillions 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Jus­tice Department has charged in court papers that fringe presidential can­didate Lyndon LaRouche, who claims he is penniless, has siphoned millions of dol­lars from three corporations forced by the government into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings. 
Interim trustees ap­pointed by federal bank­ruptcy court assumed con­trol and assessed their inventory Wednesday, as lawyers for the LaRouche organization searched for ways to escape forced bank­ruptcy. Followers generally stayed away from their Leesburg, Va., headquarters which federal agents have seized. 
LaRouche, who left the United States for Europe last December, has ac­knowledged filing no per­sonal income tax returns in more than 10 years and con­tends he has no income. 
The fresh allegations about his use of corporate money emerged in the gov­ernment's court pleadings unsealed by a federal bank-
search and advanced study into the academic endeavor of Notre Dame. O'Meara has held the Kenna chair since 1976. 
David Rockefeller, chairman of the Rockefeller Group in NewYork, willalsobeawarded a doctor of laws degree. He and his brothers formed the grant­giving group Rockefeller Brot­hers Group. Mr. Rockefeller has worked to improve youth employment, education, eco­nomic development, and public safety in urban areas. He retired from Chase Bank in 1981 after 31 years there. He is a life trustee at the University of Chicago. 
A doctor of laws degree will be presented to Sen. Alan Simpson, the Republican party whip. He co-authored the first major immigration reform legislation to pass Congress in 30 years. Simpson is a senator from Wyoming.

"Millions of dollars have passed through the books (of the companies) with no cor­porate purpose, on the whim of Lyndon LaRouche," the court papers said. 
"Assets continue to be sip­honed off for the personal use of Lyndon LaRouche and his cronies," they said. 
"The assets are used not only to pay ordinary living expenses of members of the LaRouche organization, and to satisfy the extraordinary security fetish of Lyndon LaRouche, but also to pro­vide Lyndon LaRouche with a mansion and estate," the papers said.

Reformational theology found in Catholicism 
I am nearing the end of three very happy (with a brief interlude) years as a graduate student in the philosophy department at Notre Dame. The philos­ophy department is quite lively and stimulating and I have learned a great deal about my discipline. 
Jerry Walls 
guest column 
Along the way, I have also acquired an education of anoter sort -namely in the ways of the Roman Catholic Church. My education in this regard has been informal and piecemeal, to be sure. My insights have been gathered from diverse sources: from lectures, from letters to the Observer, from ar­ticles in the conservative magazine Fidelity, from interaction with under­graduates I have taught. But most of all, I have learned from numerous con­versations with students and faculty in the philosophy and theology depart­ments, many of which have involved a friend who is a former Roman Catholic seminarian. While my informal educa­tion on these matters hardly qualifies me to speak as an authority, Roman Catholics may find interesting how one protestant in their midst has come to perceive them. I can communicate my perceptions most clearly, I think, by briefly describing three types of Cat­holics which I have encountered. 
First, I have met a fair number of conservative Catholics. Those who belong to this group like to characterize themselves as thoroughly Catholic. They stress the teaching authority of the Church and are quick to defend the official Catholic position on all points. For such persons, papal encyclicals are not to be debated; they are to be ac­cepted and obeyed. Many conservative Catholics, I suspect hold their views out of a sense of sheer loyalty to their upbringing. Others, however, defend their views with learning, intelligence, and at times, intensity. 

At the other end of the spectrum of course, are the liberal Catholics. These persons are openly sceptical not only about distinctively Roman doctines such as papal infallibility, but also about basic Christian doctrine as em­bodied in the ecumenical creeds. It is not clear in what sense such persons should even be called Christians. Nevertheless, if asked their religious preference, on a college application say, they would identify themselves as Catholics. I have no idea how many Cat­holics are liberals of this stripe, but I have met only a few here at Notre Dame. 
It is the third type of Catholic, I am inclined to think, which represents the majority. Certainly most of the Cat­holics I have met are of this type. I call this third group "functional protes­tants." 
Many Catholics, no doubt, will find this designation offensive, so let me hasten to explain what I mean by it. One of the fundamental lines of differ­ence between Catholics and Protes­tants, going back to the Reformation, concerns the issue of doctrinal author­ity. The traditional Roman Catholic view, as I understand it, is that its of­ficial teachings are guaranteed to be infallible, particularly when the pope or an ecumenical council exercises "extraordinary magesterium" when making doctrinal or moral pronounce­ments. Protestants have traditionally rejected this claim in favor of the view that Scripture alone is infallible in mat­ters doctrinal and moral. This was the conviction Martin Luther came to hold after he arrived at the conclusion that both popes and church councils have erred. After this, his excommunication was all but inevitable. 
When I say most Catholics are func­tional protestants I simply mean that 
P.O.BoxQ 
Rector's appointment prematurely publicized 
Dear Editor: 
This letter is iii regard to the "In Brief" notice in the Observer of April 13 concerning the appointment of Sister 
M.J. Griffin as rectress of Howard Hall. As Farley residents, we are upset at the poor judgement used in mentioning her appointment in order to get "the scoop." Sr. Griffin notified residents in a personal manner that she felt was deserved. The Observer decided to ex­ploit her decision. Our co-president per­sonally asked Mark Pankowski not to run the article until at least April 14, when the official notice was to be released. We personally feel that she was justified in her request because not 
Doonesbury 

even the other rectors were to be in­formed until the evening of April 13 as well as the incoming residents of Howard Hall. 
This early leak of information gave Sr. M.J. the appearance that her resi­dents were excited by the news and eager to let it be known. This is not the case, for Sr. M.J. has shared herself with Farley for the last three years as our rectress and her absence will be noticed. We support her in her decision and wish her only the best in her new position as Howard's rectress. We realize that your decision cannot be changed, but we hope that in future ar­ticles, you take into account the feelings of Sr. M.J. and show her the respect Farley has for her as well as the con­sideration she deserves.

most Catholics do not accept the au­thority claims of their Church. In actual belief and practice, they are much closer to the protestant view. 
This is apparent from the fact that many Catholics do not accept explicitly defined dogmas of their Church. For example, I have talked with several Catholics who are doubtful, at best, about the Marian dogmas, even though these have the status of infallible doctrine in their Church. Such Catholics have often made it clear to me that they believe the basic Christian doctrine as defined in the creeds. But they frankly admit that they think their Church has taken some wrong turns in her recent history. Where this is the case, they do not feel compelled to follow. As one of my functional protestant friends put it: "I am a Roman Catholic, but I am more concerned about being Catholic than about being Roman." 
That many Catholics are functionally protestant is also evident in their atti­tude toward the distinctive moral teachings of their Church The obvious example here is the Roman Catholic teaching that all forms of "artificial" birth control are immoral. The official view was re-affirmed explicitly by Pope Paul Vl in his encyclical Humanae Vitae, and has been reiterated again and again by Pope John Paul II. Nevertheless, as the arti­cle on Humanae Vitae in the En­cyclopedic Dictionary of Religion noted, "the papal ban is simply being ignored," and "a concrete authority crisis has thus emerged." 
I attended the recent debate on abor­tion between Fr. James Burtchaell and Daniel Maguire. It is interesting to me that Fr. Burtchaell, who eloquently defended the conservative view on abortion, admitted to a questioner that he rejects his Church's teaching on birth control. I could not help but wonder: is Fr. Burtchaell, Catholic statesman though he is, also among the

functional protestants? 
This raises, of course, the deeper issue here: to what extent can a mem­ber of the Roman Catholic Church dis­agree with the official teachings of his Church and still be a faithful Catholic? Can one reject the teaching of a papal encyclical while remaining a faithful Catholic? If so, can he also reject a doctine which the pope has declared in­fallible. 
I have put these questions to several Catholics. Conservatives have assured me that the answer to both of the latter questions is no. Others insist the answer is yes. 
This brings me to a final point con­cerning functional protestants: they do consider themselves faithful Catholics. I have often pointed out in conversa­tions with such Catholics that their views differ little from mine. Why then remain Catholic I ask. In response, these Catholics make it clear to me that they love their Church and intend to remain loyal to it. More than one has compared the Church to his family. One's family makes mistakes, but one does not therefore choose to join an­other family. 
I am not sure what to make of this response. It is not clear to me that one can line up behind Luther in holding that Popes and councils have erred in 
their doctrinal and moral pronounce­ments, and still be a faithful Catholic. But on the other hand, things have changed since the 16th Century. It is no longer the case that a Catholic will be excommunicated for holding what Lut­her held. Perhaps this is just another sign that the Reformation is -despite the pope's best efforts -finally taking hold within the Roman Church.

Educational body seen as communistic threat 
The 1976 presidential election brought the United States its biggest political payoff in history. Many people thought that candidates Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale had sold out to the special interests, but nobody could have predicted that a cabinet level voice for communism would result from their wheeling and dealing. Shortly after gaining office, Carter undertook the task of creating the Department of Edu­cation (DOE). One might ask, "What is wrong with trying to improve our na­tion's schools, but Carter created the DOE to pay a political debt to a group of Communists. In return for the en­dorsement of the National Education Association (NEA), the nation's largest teacher's union, Carter gave them a seat in his cabinet in the form of the DOE. The NEA had gained a major vic­tory in their quest to totally take control of our educational system and turn it into a tool of communism. 
Eric Murray 
from the right 

Since the creation of our great nation, education lay in the jurisdiction of the state and local governments. Parents had a voice in what subject their children learned. The NEA has long sought to stop this local control of edu­cation. They wish to centralize, nation­alize our educational system. They wish to take away the parents' voice in their children's education. A nationalization of our school system is important to their objective of turning a public education into a communist indoctrination. The NEA could not achieve their objective if it did not have total control of the nation's school sys­tems. 
Of course, the NEA denies any com­munist ties. The evidence points to the contrary. If NEA actions, advocates, and policies receive close scrutiny, they reveal an organization with deep­rooted communist ties and sympathies. 
Before the election of 1976, American communist William Foster wrote in "Toward a Soviet America" that he considered a Department of Education essential to the communist "cultural revoluiton." It is certainly quite a coin­cidence that the NEA would lobby Pres­ident Carter for just such a department. 
Several times over the past couple of years, the NEA has sponsored delegate exchanges with ''teacher unions'' in the Soviet Union. The NEA had the nerve to publicly praise these communist "union" representatives. Soviet com­munists are not the only ones who receive NEA praise and support. At its 1978 convention, the NEA passed a resolution calling for the United States to grant Hector Marroquin a visa to remain in this country. Marroquin was a communist terrorist wanted in 
Mexico at the time. 
The NEA's pro-Soviet views also find an outlet in the numerous brochures that they put out. For instance, one bro­chure, called "Racism, Sexism, and Militarism: the Links," has a section of "questions frequently asked about the arms race." An excerpt: 
Q: But aren't we risking our way of life if we allow the Russians to get ahead? 
A: The $1 trillion defense budget... will do more to undermine our democratic values and standard of living than anything the Russians can do. 
Q: But how can we trust the Rus­sians? How can we be sure they won't cheat? 
A: We can trust them as much as they can trust us. This thinly veiled argument for unilateral disarmament has not gone unnoticed. 
They published another brochure en­titled "Choices: A Unit in Conflict and Nuclear War." In addition to the usual pro-Soviet, anti-nuke rhetoric, they had the audacity to blame the Soviet inva­sion of Afghanistan on "some un-. friendly countries." This brochure has such a strong bias that even the ultra­liberal''Washington Post'' criticized it, saying, "This is not teaching in any ac­cepted, or for that matter acceptable, sense. It is political indoctrination." In the NEA's 15th yearbook, they lashed out at the United States, saying, "We are all brainwashed from childhood to pretend that the United States has no classes or masses. We are all supposed to be Americans, believing that cap­titalism and free enterprise came down to us on stone tablets from the moun­tains." They also praised the Russian school system: "The present capitalis­tic and nationalistic school system has been supplanted in but one place­Russia-and that change was a revolu­tion for social change of an important and far reaching character." They ac­tually advocate a revolution in the United States of America. 
In 1981, the communist newspaper "Daily World" reported: "Nowhere in the basic documents of NEA, in their resolutions or new busniess items, are there any anti-Soviet or anti-socialist positions." That startling statement means that our children's education 
receives  its  direction  from  a  pro­ 
communist organization.  
Decent Americans  should  be  hor­ 
rified at these developments.  For­ 

tunately, all is not lost. Congress and the President, properly lobbied by we the people, can return control of our children's educatioh to where it belongs, in the hands of the people.

Undergrads could make better use of resources 
I wish to thank Mr. Brauer for his comments in your April 6th issue. Al­though he has mentioned some good points, I am not as convinced as he that Notre Dame's Economics department is worthy of increased funding. First, a clarification of some issues. 

Christopher Ryan 
guest column 

Mr. Brauer is correct that the study I cited did include 24, not just 4 journals. However, he is incorrect if he believes that articles earlier than 1978 were in­cluded. The earlier rankings were pub­lished as a comparison, not as an original part of the study period and considering that the endowment has more than doubled since 1974, this only highlights my point that we are not doing as well as we should. Shoud we really be proud of moving from ex­tremely poor to very poor? Is it really "quite alright for the department to be ranked as no. 121"? Mr. Brauer makes Robert Gordon ("We are not in the top ten and we never will be but that's not our goal.") look ambitious. 
Second, Mr. Brauer mentions that Notre Dame's faculty is small though not so small as he may think. In Decem­ber, 1981 the American Economic As­sociation published a special issue of the A.E.R. which listed the names of every member of the Association at each campus. Using these lists we can control for the effect of faculty mem­bers who publish in Economics but are not formally in an Economics depart­ment. In this list, Notre Dame had 32 
A.E.A. members. For comparison, Southern Cal which has a smaller en­dowment than Notre Dame had 35 
A.E.A. members. Yet Southern Cal's publishing, in the 1984 A.E.R. ranking ( Page 823), was far greater than Notre Dame's: 518.9 pages vs. 58.2 pages for Notre Dame. Faculty size explains only a small part of the difference. 
As to graduate studentfaculty ratios, "An Assessment of Research-Doc­torate Programs in the United States" (Social and Behavioral Sciences, pg 5, 1982) reports that Notre Dame has 60 graduate students. Combining this with Mr. Brauer's 20 faculty members Notre Dame's ratio is 3.0. By comparison, Berkeley's was 5.2, Chicago's was 4.4, Columbia's was 7.6, Harvard's was 3.8, MIT's was 3.5 and Johns Hopkins' was 
5.8. As to specialization, 2 points. First, Notre Dame's department is not sub­stantially smaller than some so-called big departments. Compare Notre Dame to Berkeley's 26, MIT's 25, Chicago's 27, Johns Hopkins' 7, and Rochester's 15. Second, specialization of subject matter. The 24 journals in­luded in the ranking are listed (A.E.R., 
72:5 pg 1132). The journals include Eco­nomic Development and Cultural Change, Industrial and Labor Relations Review, Journal of Human Resources, Journal of Law and Economics, and the National Tax Journal. In addition, the general journals publish articles in those fields, though only "above average" one's, as Mr. Brauer com­plains. 
As to faculty resources: in my previ­ous letter I was far too kind on the issue of faculty pay. The full professors were 31st in the country, but the other aca­demic ranks were even higher. Accor­ding to the July 26, 1985 Notre -Dame Report (pg 645) associate professors were 11th, assistant professors were ulty office building. Is this a lack of resources? 
Mr. Brauer believes that ranking of Economics departments by their publishing output makes little sense. Well, the national "An Assessment of..." (pg. 59), ranks programs on several points. Let's see how it ranks Notre Dame. There were four areas which bore on the quality of graduate education most directly. On a 5 point scale (5-distinguished, 4-strong, 3-good, 2-adequate, 1-marginal, 0-not sufficient for doctoral education), Notre Dame ranked 0.9 for scholarly quality of fac­ulty. It ranked 0.6 for effectiveness in educating research scholars. It ranked 
0.9 for improvement in program quality 1977-82. It ranked 0.4 in evalulators' familiarity with the work of the faculty, an indicator of the lack of influence of Notre Dame's faculty. 
In other words, the faculty is sub­marginal, the education is sub­marginal, the improvement is sub­marginal, and what little is published is soon forgotten. Is this a graduate pro­gram that merits more resources? No. This is a graduate program that should be abolished, not enriched. 
Mr. Brauer claims that he did not come to Notre Dame for the stipend, which is lower than that of other schools. For his information other schools do not automatically subsidize their graduate students with stipends and tuition waivers. Should under­graduates be forced to subsidize sub­marginal graduate students? At the University of Chicago (no. 1 of the dreaded top ten), few graduate stu­dents get any support besides loans. Yet Chicago's graduate students finish their programs three years sooner than Notre Dame's, according to "An As­sessment of...". I wish it were true that the quality of graduate students was as high as Mr. Brauer claims. How remarkable to be accepted for graduate study at Amherst, which does not have a graduate program. Personally, I have always seen the undergraduates as far abler than Notre Dame's graduate stu­dents. As an undergraduate college Notre Dame was ranked "Most Com­petitive" the highest rating by Barron's Guide to the Most Prestigious Colleges <New York, 1984). The comment I made in the previous letter was that the graduate students do not go on to teach at the best universities. For proof of this see the alumni notes at the back of the Notre Dame Magazine. Or you can write to the current author of the eco­nomics alumni notes. He can be reached at the University of Wyoming. 
Mr. Brauer notes that Notre Dame's emphasis on social justice sets it apart. Maybe so. But the test of success is whether your peers are following your lead. After twelve years I don't see much impact. Perhaps that is why it is set apart -nobody copies a failure. 
Finally, let's not forget the other graduate departments. They aren't doing much better. The real questions is, are our graduate programs an asset or a liability? I see little evidence that they are an asset, with the exception of Chemical Engineering. If they are a liability, they should be scaled back or abolished, and the money should be diverted to the undergraduates.

1a)t can't change the

it." This famous line from 
MASH can be applied to the 
efforts of Notre Dame sop­
homores Chris Ballas and 
Wayne Warnken. 
Ballas and Warnken will set forth on a biking expedi­tion across America on June 17 in an effort to change many little corners of the world as well as to educate our little corner about world hunger and poverty. 
"We're Interested in the problem of poverty. We can't stop poverty. but we can be­come aware of it--especially at Notre Dame," said Ballas, expressing his concern about many people's ignor­ance of world hunger. 
Sponsored by the Over­seas Development Network (ODN), a coalition of student groups on college campuses nationwide, Bike-Aid '87: Peddling for Progress hopes to raise at least $100,000 to support self-help efforts around the world. Demand­

Ing perseverance and Indi­vidual effort, Bike-Aid is in­tended to symbolize that both cycling and develop­ment progress gradually. 
Ballas and Warnken will be peddling 3,600 miles, averaging 72 miles each day. Their Individual goal is to raise $3,600 or $1 for each mile they travel. 
"It's grueling. but it's worth the experience," said Ballas, "People have been very helpful so far. VeiTee Boyer Sports is providing us with riding equipment." 
The organizers say the 
proceeds from the eight­
week biking marathon will 
fund projects both at home 
and in Third World commun­
iti~s. 50% of the proceeds 
raised will go to self-help 
projects sponsored by ODN 
In Africa, Asia, and Latin 
America. 25% will go to 
Oxfam-America and other

college students to volunteer with development projects overseas. 
There are five routes leaving from Western and Southern cities, and Ballas and Warken will be travelling the San Francisco route through Sacramento, Reno, Salt Lake City, Denver, and Saint Louis. 
"We will be volunteering for community service along the way. Our accomodations may be at churches, gyms, or campgrounds at the host communities," said Warnken, who witnessed Tim McLelan of the Class of '86 
successfully complete the 
project last year. 
Currently working for the 
Peace Corps in Niger, 
McLelan was one of the 4 2 
college students to partici­
pate in Bike-Aid '86. The 
bikers ranged in age from 
15 to 55, the median age 

being 22. Although many of 
the riders last year were col­

The ODN information 
booklet emphasizes the 

symbolic value of the several 
routes that various riders 

will follow: "By starting from

British cheer on tap 
T 
here isn't a Senior Bar In London--no Brldglt's, no Commons, no Chips. Tuesday night is not Margaritaville here, and dime beers don't exist (mostly because dimes don't exist). But there is extremely interesting alternative: The English Pub. 
Pubs are, and have been, very popular throughout England's history. Most of them are hundreds of years old. Today there are two or three on every street corner, and most are painfully crowded on weekend 
Lisa Young 
The London Bridge 

With names ranging from The Clarence, Rose and 
Crown, and 
Prince Alfred's to the Redan and the Royal Oak, fondly referred 
as the Royal Smoke, the Interior motifs are all slightly different. 
One thing they all have in common, though, is a sharp contrast 
to the U.S. collegiate crowd bars. They are a step above in decor 
history, and clientele behavior. 
Price Edward's Is a typical pub, and being just down the street 
from our residences, it Is frequented by Notre Dame students. 
The walls are lined with green velvet benches, fronted by small 
mahoghany tables and velvet stools. The pub is carpeted, 
moderately lit, and seats about 80. The walls are dotted with 
prints and cartoons and mahoghany paneling. 
A massive bar stands in the middle of the pub. A small display 
houses English pub delicacies such as steak and kidney pie or 
Shepherd's Pie. The middle wall holds liquors In convenient 
dispensable bottles, although the predominant beverage here is, 
of course, beer. 
Most pubs are owned by the brewing companies of England, 
as Courage, Younger's or Samuel Smith's. Each pub, therefore, has different brands of beer, but the options are the same--lager, ale, bitter, elder, or shandy. Lager Is the closestl to American beer; It is a gold-colored, fairly light-tasting beer. 
and bitter come from the same brewing family, ale having less of a bite than the dark brown frothy bitter. Cider is a tasty 
potent fruity drink derived from the familiar sweet elders. finally, the shandy. It tastes much better than It sounds: It Is usually lager mixed with carbonated lemonade. In addition to these British brews, some pubs have Lite or Budweiser on tap those feeling homesick. 
The beer here Isn't quite as warm as we expected, although It far from Ice-cold. In pubs It Is served by the pint and half-pint, but the measure Is an imperial pint of 20 ounces rather than 16. When ordering your beer, keep in mind the unwritten rule of British manners: ladles should only order half-pints. ( A rule we aggressive American women often Ignore.) It Is not unmanly, though, for men to order half-pints. There are no drink specials In pubs, but cover Is never charged. 
The word "pub" comes from the original reference to these drinking establishments. They were known as public houses, because they were not private clubs. History has determined one of the most unusual aspects of the pubs--serving hours. They vary from pub to pub, but in London pubs must not serve between 3:00·5:30 p.m. and after 11:00 p.m. Reliable sources that Ute afternoon hours law began during World War I to stop drunkenness among munitions workers and soldiers on leave. The 11:00 p.m. closing law Is most likely due to the fact that the Tube (subway system) closes about midnight. Only restaurants and clubs are allowed to serve after 11.00 p.m. 
Most often pubs are important for the Infamous "pub crawl." This usually entails having a pint at each of a number of pubs. ultimately ending in a "crawl" home. We undertook a literary crawl last week, visiting old stomping grounds of English urriTPlr...  We began at "The Cheshire Cheese." just down the street from Dr. Johnson's home and one of his favorite pubs. Another stop was at "Ye aide CockTavern," frequented by Samuel Pepus and Tennyson, where Dickens ellioyed his last meal In public. 
Here in England, then, a pint of bitter. a dart board, and a slightly outdated jukebox at the pub make up for the bottles of Mi5heiob, the pool tables, and the video screens we left In the South Bend bars. Until next fail, then, as they say in London, "Cheers."

Student entrepreneur beats summertime blues 
By RENEE GAU 
Business Writer 
After An Tostal and the in­tensity of exam week, the ap­peal of working at Leo's Grill, Verna's Retail, or Le Chateaux may have dwindled. Those long, hard hours of play and study demand an equally chal­lenging and exciting summer. There must be a self fulfilling way to use what you have learned at Notre Dame which not only rakes in the money, but also gives you experience. One option is starting a small business. 
Joe Pupel, a senior account­ing major, did just that the summer after his junior year. His brother and brother-in-law had started Woodlawn Yard Structures, a children's playset construction company. Even though he had no experience, Joe entered as a 20 percent shareholder and offered his skills to help manage the com­pany. 
Pupel explains that his job is

According to Fortune Magazine, Saghanalian arrived in the United States with only $46 in his pocket after almost being killed during a shady arms deal. Living a ruthless story of pure capitalism, he has built his company into a premier private seller of arms with $100 million in profits per year. 
Saghanalian will sell to anybody, including the black market. He has dealt with South Africa,

Afghanistan, rebels in Central America and An­gola, Iran and Iraq. Saghanalian will stop at noth­ing to make a sale, and is willing to demonstrate his products. He once captured an Iranian military unit while showing arms to Iraq. Saghanalian has no problem deliverying arms to even the hottest fronts, and if the country is too war torn to afford guns, he will arrange a loan. 
Governments, including our own, will not touch him. Many times he is called upon to provide arms to one country when another does not want its name mentioned. He is rumored to have sold arms to Iran for the United States in the recent Iran debacle. 
With all of the liberal interests vowing to end

on the New York Stock Exchange came to 185.93 million shares, against 191.34 million in the previous session. 
Analysts said investors were not much impressed by the strong showing Tuesday of the blue chips in the Dow Jones in­dustrial average. They noted that gains in many smaller, secondary issues were less dra­matic. 
Many market-watchers remained uneasy about the out­look for interest rates, which have climbed significantly in recent weeks.

This in­cludes the formulation of a business p' an which outlines their objecl1ves, processes and strategies. He has also im­proved their marketing and in­ventory techniques by drawing up questiotulaires and check­lists. 
Pupel says that before he had joined the company "I didn't know if I had what it took to do the job," but, because he was tired of his old job as an assis­tant golf pro, he accepted the offer of what he calls "an in­valuable experience." Al­though he is now earning less money, Joe believes that he is sacrificing nothing. He is gaining hands-on education which will greatly help him in the future. 
"There is nothing more educational ... than having a hand in a small corporation," says Pupel, "seeing how every­thing interrelates, how man­agement works with market­ing ...(and) how it really fits

Dallas, believe it or not, is still growing. The commerce of Dallas was not built only on oil. Though it was hurt by the fall of OPEC, the city has bounced back. 
Boston, the hotbed of entrepreneurs and intel­lectuals, is booming. A culturally active city, Bos­ton offers a mix of the old world and the new, as many new Bostonians have discovered.

Los Angeles is quickly becoming the number one city. Some predict its population will surpass New York. According to one knowledgable resi­dent, the employers in Los Angeles are desperate for young talent to serve its professional business sector, and will pay heavily for it. 
New York is seeing a reversal in its dismal growth trend, and the experts are now predicting that it will once again lead the country. If you are 
planning a career in advertising, the arts or finance, New York is the place to be. Be prepared for a high pressured mix of everything this city has to offer and finding a good suburb in which to live, preferrably in Conneticut or New Jersey.

Obviously, there is risk in­volved in starting a small busi­ness. It requires money, effi­cient management and a good product. With these, however, anyone should be well on their way to success, right? Well, yes, but Joe Pupel states, "You can have the most efficient pro­duction process in the world and if you can't sell an item you're not going to make it." He says it requires optimism, determination and a person­able personality at all times, especially when the going gets tough. 
But what about the four years of time and effort students devote to their education. Doesn't that help? 
Joe Pupel maintains that his Notre Dame academic educa­tion will help him achieve his goals of being a CPA and aquir­ing a secure job. In the day-to­
day operations of a small busi­ness, however, Pupel says that instincts and ambition are more important than educa­

"After two weeks (in the business) I had applied just about everything I had learned in school," Pupel explains. Furthermore, he says that somethings which he had studied, such as the economic order theory, are not applica­ble to his business. Pupel's con­cern is "making ends meet." "You do what you have to do to get by." 
Joe Pupel credits Notre Dame for giving him the drive to achieve, and the ability to accept and resolve the chal­lenges he faces in business. He fervently believes that Notre Dame sports, more so than the academics, have instilled in him the · enthusiasm, "the guts," and the optimistic atti­tude which he needs.

Lawrence B. gibbs says in "The question before us ­drawing a contrast between here today is what can we do civil tax law, which places the to protect the rights of our burden of proof on the tax-citizens without handicapping payer, and criminal law, the tax-collection system," which requires the govern-said Sen.

Since the taxpayer has access to all the information to show whether a return is correct, Gibbs said, "the bur­den is on the taxpayer to show he's reported all income and is entitled to deductions and credits claimed."

Therefore, if you are thinking of starting your own business, but you are afraid of the risks, ''Go for it,'' says Pupel. ''Ifyou ever get the chance to be a part of a business, do it. Even if you 
have to take a cut in pay, it's

Pupel's final advice, "It really doesn't matter what your GPA is. It really doesn't matter what your major is. It's guts and enthusiasm and maybe a little bit of morals that will win in the end in any busi­ness."

OSU's Scarlet course leaves golfers bloody 
By ORLANDO RUBIANO Sports Writer 
The Scarlet course of Ohio State turned bloody red for the Irish golf team as they posted a disappointing finish at the Kepler Invitational over the Easter weekend. 
Head Coach Noel O'Sullivan, whose squad was looking forward to this grand tournament, did not expect the team to finish 20th out of 23 entrants. 
"We had an excellent atti­tude coming to the Kepler. However, the Scarlet was not at all kind to us." 
The club stroked a team total 957 for the three-round event, and were well off defending champion and host Ohio State's winning number of 894. 
Big Ten power Illinois was a distant second with a 913, and Kentucky took third with a 915. 
While acknowledging that 20th was disappointing, O'Sullivan added that the difference between his team and 14th-place Purdue was just seven strokes. 
Part of the reason the Irish struggled may be attributed to something we can all relate to, inexperience. Three of the five golfers found themselves in the Kepler for the first time, and the Scarlet course is re­garded as intimidating to newcomers. 
Pat Mohan, in particular, could not find his game and failed to post a sub 80 in any of the three rounds. Mohan shot a 252 (84-83-85) total for the 54-hole event. 
The other two first-timers, Doug Giorgio and John Con­nelly, fa ired a bit better.

Connelly fired a 246 (78-80­88), while Giorgio contributed with a 241 (82-78­81). Senior captain Chris Bona was also unable to break 80 for any of the three rounds, thus accounting for a higher than normal244 (80­81-83) sum. 
Despite the rough going, there was a bright spot worth mentioning. Dick Con­nelly, who led the Irish with a 229 (83-74-72), shot the low number of the day on the final round among 120 gol­fers. He finished seven strokes behind Scott Chipokas of Michigan for the medalist honor. 
By virtue of his strong per­formance at the Kepler (76 average), Chipokas is eligi­ble for the nomination of Academic All-American status. 
"Richard's academic achievements as well as his golf play certainly is some­thing that can make a coach feel proud of his players, even when the team did not have a good outing," said O'Sullivan. 
The golf team will now have a week off to prepare in defense of its Spartan In­vitational championship which it captured last year at Michigan State. O'Sullivan said that junior Norm Campbell has been upgraded to the travelling squad that will go to this year's Spartan Invitational. 
"Norm has worked hard in practice and his showing at the Ball State Invitational a few weeks ago convinced me that he deserves this chance," said O'Sullivan. "He has all the deserving qualities to make the trip, and his monogram will also be deservedly earned."

Cubs irked at prison's false plates 
Associated Press 
MICHIGAN CITY, Ind. -A spokesman for the Indiana State Prison says the prison didn't profit from manufactur­ing facsimile license plates stamped "Cubs" -a practice the Chicago baseball team may file suit over, a newspaper re­ported Wednesday. 
Herbert Newkirk, superin­tendent of industries at the prison, told The Gary Post­Tribune that the practice of producing such plates was an opportunity for the prison to recoup its costs in making license plates. He said the

N.D.-S.M.C. Students 
niversity Park Mall and Concord & Pierre Moran Malls -Elkhart 
prison didn't profit from the sale of "Cubs" plates. 
The plates were made and sold at least in 1985, although there are conflicting accounts on when and how many were made, the Post-Tribune said. 
Cubs spokesman Scott Nickle said if the prison is making plates marked "Cubs," it is in violation of the team's copyright. Depending on the amount made and sold, said Nickle, the baseball team may file suit for damages. 
"That's our corporate trade name and that's a copyright in­fringement," Nickle told the Post-Tribune. 
Vaughn Overstreet, a spokesman for the state Cor­rection Department, said Wed­nesday, "If we're found to be responsible, we'll have to deal with that as it happens. It was inadvertent. It wasn't an at­tempt to make any money off the Cubs' name. 
''At the time these were made, (former commissioner) Gordon Faulkner was trying to encourage prison industries to be more creative and innovate, and to use up waste materials." 
the outside to break the pres­
sure they put on you as far as 
you retreat." 
"They killed us in the first few minutes last year," said ·Milone, "and we can't let that 
happen. 
"Middies are the key to this 

game. They have five middies 
just as good as O'Neill who are 
all 6-3. If we stop fast breaks 
and move the ball by passing 
instead of running, we can take 
away their quickness." 
"If can score three or four 

goals first," said Lanahan, "we 
will play with them. We must 
get in control. We have lost a 
lot of tough games, but We see 
ourselves beating these teams 
because we don't play tenta­
tively." 
The tallest test will be Wes­leyan, but the Irish cannot af­ford a let-down against Witten­berg. "The first game will be very physical and demand­ing," said McNicholas, "we will have to use more players Sunday." 
"That's going to be a tough assignment, especially consid­ering we will have played Wes­leyan less than 24 hours ear­lier," said O'Leary. "Wittenberg had gotten progressively better in each of their six seasons. They're a scrappy, aggressive team that could very well present us with problems." 
The NCAA tournament bid for the West will go to Air Force, Michigan State, Ohio State, or Notre Dame. MSU and OSU are ahead for the Irish. If Notre Dame can defeat those two teams, along with a win over Wesleyan, it could get the bid over Air Force, whose record is bolstered by shoddy competition.

minutes. Nothing less will do." 
Ohio Wesleyan is reknown for an aggressive zone defense which shifts quickly and over­powers its opponent. Notre Dame will have to be patient passing the ball to avoid mis­takes to win, according to O'Leary. 
"We will have to create things and force mistakes on defense. Our seniors (Wally Stack, Jim Fallon, and Dick Milone) have done well as of late, while the middies (John McNicholas, Tom Lanahan, and Dave O'Neill) have con­tributed to offense more. Olmstead has been a pleasent suprise as a scoring threat along with McLachlan." 

"This is our most important game and we must play our best lacrosse," said McNic­holas. "On offense, we must dominate all ground balls, be mentally prepared to be in po­sition, and attack because we have nothing to lose. On defense, we need scoring from

Wednesday night, in Montreal, Michel Goulet and Basil McRae scored 17 seconds apart early in the third period to end a scoreless duel as the Quebec Nordiques held off a Montreal rally to beat the Canadiens 2-1. That gives Quebec a 2-0 lead in that NHL playoff series. 
Wednesday night's game was in marked contrast to the opener of the best-of -seven Adams Division final, which produced 12 goals. This one belonged to the goaltenders mario Gosselin of Quebec, and especially Brian Hayward of the Canadiens, who was selec­ted to start over Patrick Roy.

Members of the Irish track squad may be doing their best ever, but thanks to the opposi­tion, the results aren't showing up in the team scores. 
Four Irish runners recorded personal bests over the weekend at the Indiana Inter­collegiate championships, but none of them placed first in their events. 
"The meet was just in­credible," said Head Coach Joe Piane. "David Warth and Tom Mick, for example, both broke the meet records in the half (800-meter run) and the ham­mer throw, but they finished fifth and fourth (respectively)." 
Warth recorded a time of 
1:50.2 in the 800, finishing be­hind four runners from In­diana, and Mick recorded a toss.of 50.18 meters, which was just one meter short of the win­ning toss. 
Mike O'Connor finished'sixth in the 1500-meter run with a

Clue Set #2 
time of 3:49.6. This time is equivalent to a mile clocking of 4:06, which would be the best for O'Connor. 
Yan Searcy chopped a second off his best time in the 400-meter run, placing sixth with a time of 48.5. 
These placings showed in the team scoring column, as In­diana won the meet with 161 points, followed by Purdue with 141, Indiana State with 102.5 and the Irish with 85. And Ball State, which according to Piane ran its best meet in eight years, finished right behind Notre Dame with 70 points. 
The Irish did manage to win two events. Ron Markezich took the 10,000-meter run with a time of 31:04.8, and the 1600­meter relay team of Robert Nobles, David Warth, Yan Searcy and Tim Brown won with a time of 3:11.0. 
Nobles finished behind Warth in the 800 with a time of 1:51.1, and Brown added third­place finishes in both the 100 and 200-meter dashes. Brown 
was edged by

Bookstore tourneys head towards stretch 
Party at Chips, Leone's advance 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 

The Sweet 16 looked more like the Soggy 16 on Wednesday, as eight teams survived scrappy foes and constant rains to reach Friday's quarterfinals.
As the field narrows, the plot thickens in anticipation of the crowning of the 1987 Bookstore Basketball champion.Last year's finalists, Party at ChipsWhen We Repeat (then Lee's BBQ Roundhouse) and Leone's Stallions,
 
both had little trouble advancing to the next round. 
Party at Chips grounded the Flying Dingleberries, 21-12, behind a 21-of-38 team shooting performance. Point guard Bubba Cunningham and Steve Beuerlein led the defending champions with five points each. Each Party at Chips player chipped in three or more points in a characteristic team effort. 
Leone's Stallions 21-8 win was the largest margin of victory of the day. Bill Sullivan poured in nine points for the victors, while teammate Mike O'Grady pulled down 11 rebounds. 
The other six remaining teams will all have a shot at knocking off the defending champion and runner-up en route to Sunday's final. Friday's games will feature some excellent matchups and exciting play, given the quality of the final eight teams. 
Scott Hicks asserted himself with 11 points and 16 rebounds to lead 4 Slamma Jamma over SOMFAW, 24-22. Teammate Chris Perozek chipped in five points and seven rebounds. Hicks

Double Decker makes the 16 
By THERESA KELLY 
Sports Writer 
As Women's Bookstore Basketball action continues, Double Decker Oreo Cookie looks to have a great chance of repeating as champions. Breezing through the tournament by giving uponly two points per game, Cookie, led by Lavetta Willis, made it to the Sweet Sixteen yesterday by easily defeating Hickey: Not Just a Blemish Anymore, 
21-2~ 
We're working really hard," said a Cookie spokeswoman. "We want to keep playing well and get back to the championship game." 
Another strong performance was turned in yesterday by We'll Do Anyth­ing for a Quarter, who defeated We Should Have Won, 21-14, in a vicious catfight on Stepan 3. The outside shoot­ing of Anne Reilly gave We Should Have Won a chance, but the inside play of We'll Do Anything was too much. With the score 11-6 at the half, spectators began suggesting war tactics and lethal weapons to the competitors, who were definitely displaying the killer instinct. 
On the Angela Courts at Saint Mary's, Still Having Fun soundly defeated the Underpaid SMU Sorority Girls, 15-3, thanks in part to the play of MaryBorkowski. 
She's a great all-around player and really a good sport," said Bookstore Commissioner Barbara Tull. "She makes wicked passes, but always plays with a smile on her face."

Irish baseball tea01 struggling as season co01es to close 
By KEVIN McCORMACK Sports Writer 
Currently holding a "disap­pointing" 12-20 record two­thirds into the 1987 season, the Notre Dame baseball team might have received a blessing in disguise with yesterday's rainout at Jake Kline Field that had Western Michigan sched­uled for an afternoon doubleheader. The Irish just might need the rest in prepa­ration for a six-game swing in the next six days. 
Coming off three consecutive victories, two over St. Joseph's and a 10-1 thrashing at the dis­pense of the Bethel Pilots, all at Jake Kline, the Irish now have something to build upon what so far has been a trying season. 

"Like I've said before, if you would have told me that we would be 12-20 at this point in the season, I would say that you were crazy, particularly after we won six of our first ten games in the Texas trip," said Head Coach Larry Gallo. 
"What has made the season so difficult is that we have beaten ourselves with mistakes all year long. Consistency is the ingredient needed to win and it hasn't been there for us." 
Recently, Gallo has noticed substantial improvement in the hitting department, an area which has plagued the Irish all season. 
"Our hitting has become more timely and we've been getting help from those players that haven't been as consistent all year long," said Gallo. 
Against Bethel, the Irish racked up an impressive six­

teen hits as Dan Peltier, Mike Moshier, Scott Rogers, Tim Hutson, and Chris Flynn each came up with two. 
The Western Michigan game has been rescheduled for Mon­day, but the twin bill has been sctratched in favor of just one contest. It might be helpful for the Irish hurlers, who will have a long haul with games sched­uled against Butler, St. Louis (three), and Purdue, along with Western Michigan coming up within the next couple of days. 
"We've still got about four­teen or fifteen games left, so the season is still long from over, and we have a lot to gain for next season, considering we're only losing three players of this year's ball club," said Gallo. 
"The competition has been tough, which makes things frustrating for us. I don't have any excuses, though. The fact stares you right in the face. We're just going to have to play good enough to win for the rest of the season. We just haven't done that this year." 

Tourney bid at stake for lacrosse tea01 
By MIKE SZYMANSKI Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame lacrosse team will reach an important crossroads this weekend as it faces Ohio Wesleyan at 12:30 
p.m. Saturday and Wittenburg on Sunday at Alumni Field. 
Notre Dame coach Rich O'Leary and his players know that a successful weekend could lead to an NCAA bid. 
"This is a crucial point in the season," said O'Leary. "We have never beaten Wesleyan (ranked second in Division III and first overall in the Mid­west) and a win could do a lot for lacrosse at Notre Dame. 
"We could use this contest as a springboard to our final three conference games." 
The Irish, now at 4-3, revealed their potential in last weekend's loss to Denison as they fell behind 10-1 in the second period but put together an impressive 7-1 rally to close to 11-8 at one point. John McLachlan (team leader in points with 31) and John Olmstead (27 points) keyed the comeback with two goals each. 
"It was a combination of their letdown and our aggres­siveness that made the rally," said O'Leary. "We learned a lot there, but you could an­ticipate their final three goals after we had outplayed them so intensely for as long as we did. 
"I think Ohio Wesleyan is far and away the best team in the Midwest. Not only do they win, but they win convincingly. They've already beaten Hobart, who is the perennial Division III national champ, so they obviously have great tal­ent. 
"If we're going to have any chance to win, we've got to play near perfect lacrosse for 60
