ND in talks to hire ex-governor 
By MARY KATE MALONE News Writer 
Th11 Notre Dame department of political sci'ence is currently in talks to add former gover­nor of Indiana .I o s n p h Knrnan to its faculty. 
Kernan, a 11H1S gradu­atn of Notre Damn. has nxpressed int11r11st in teaching a singl11-eredit gulwrnatorial l11adorship elass at thr. 

University, political science professor John Hoos said Wednesday. 
"Ex-governor Kernan loves his alma mater and has an extraordinary knowledge in politics and government," Roos said. "He's dealt with billion dollar budgets, capital punish­ment crime cases [and) prop­erty taxes. He has a range of experience about politics that would be of use to students." 
Kernan served as mayor of South Bend from 1987 to 1996. lie was South Bend's longest-serving mayor when he resigned to become lieu­tenant governor under Frank ()'Bannon in 1996. When ()'Bannon suffered a massive 
stroke in 2003, Kernan assumed command as Indiana's 48th governor. 
Kernan -who resides in South Bend -left his post as governor on Jan. 10 after Republican Mitch Daniels defeated him in the 2004 gubernatorial election. 
Roos said Kernan's class could be available as soon as spring 2006. The course would likely be small and focus on different dimensions of state politics, Roos said. Kernan would use his experience in politics to shape parts of the class around major issues he faced while serving in the pub­lic sector. 
"llealthcare, budgets, wel­
fare, transportation, capital punishment," Roos said. "He would draw upon his experi­ences in the statehouse and take students through the actual Indiana budget, for example, to show the politics of putting a budget together." 
In addition to teaching the course, Kernan would give talks periodically and serve as an advisor for students inter­ested in public affairs. 
"l-Ie loves South Bend, he loves Notre Dame," Roos said. "He loves to work with young people and he would be a ter­rific asset if we could get him."

Basketball promotion criticized 
By KATE ANTONACCI Associate News Editor 
In years past, students awoke in the wee hours of a cold October morning to lin!~ up outside the Joyce ((mter with one goal in mind -to leave with basketball season ticket booklets in hand just as the sun was coming up. 
But this year, due largely to complaints about the system and low student attendance at games, organizers decided to alter their method of ticket distribution. 
"I think they had a great idea with the whole 'get everyone out and pumped for the basketball season' thing, but I think maybe if they had advertised it a little bit earli­er or made it a little more exciting it would have gone better," junior Brigid Bulfin said. 
Bulf'in was referring to "Late Night with the Legion," the event held Wednnsday at the .Joyce Centnr from 10 
p.m. to 12 a.m. where stu­dents obtained a redeemable ticket voucher to bn exchanged for a ticket book­let -but only after pieking up a bracelet upon entering the JACC and waiting for two hours to receive the voucher. 
"It seemed somewhat unor­ganized as we tried to get into the .JACC to get the b r a c e Ie t s , " j u n i o r H .. 1 . Kornhaas said. "Then there was a mad rush when pnople realizr.d they could leave to get the vouchers at the end."

Religious leadership weighs modem faith 
By JANICE FLYNN News Writer 
American Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders empha­sized that both understanding the narrative that originates "the other" and rejecting unilat­eral action are crucial to suc­cess in the Middle East, in a panel discussion on interreli­gious leadership in the Holy Land Wednesday. 
"When Faiths Unite" kept with the spirit of the academic forum of faith in the modern world and featured three lead­ers from the National Interreligious Leadership Initiative for Peace in the Middle East. 
The initiative -formed in 2003 -includes 38 American religious leaders who endorse the current "road map" solution to the Middle East conflict and encourage the current U.S. administration to engage in crn­ative, consistent leadership. 
Gerard Powers, director of policy studies at the Kroc Institute !'or International Peace Studies, served as discussion moderator and praised the spr.akers for their "real courage" in eollaborating over the divisive conflict. lie urgnd speakers to explain the con­tlict's relevance from their par-

die while eating popcorn. Production 
I've sat through Editor countless hours of horror movies, and since this is almost the season to be jolly and give presents, I've decided to lend my professional advice about what to watch on this candy-filled day ofjoy. 
The modern classics: "The Exorcist" (still the best), "Alien" (makes me not want to go into outer space), "Hellraiser" (this one's gory), "The Shining" (Jack Nicholson's per­formance still outshines the compe­tition), "A Nightmare on Elm Street" (Johnny Depp's first film role), "Friday the 13th" (there are now ten sequels), "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (this has three unpubli­cized sequels, not including the recent remake), "Poltergeist", "Halloween", "The Evil Dead" ("Spiderman" director Sam Raimi's first feature), "Child's Play" (the first few films in this series make "Seed of Chucky" look even worse than it is), "Silence of the Lambs" (winner of five Academy Awards), "Misery' (based off Stephen King's novel), "The Thing" (starring Kurt Russell) and "Se7en." 
The best horror movies you proba­bly haven't seen: "Session 9" (as creepy as it is complicated), "The Exorcist III" (the little-known sequel thai deserves more attention than it bas ever received), "Apt Pupil" (based off a Stephen King short story), "The l:litcher" (the movie that helped end hitchhiking), "The Ugly" (made in England), "Ginger Snaps" (a Canadian werewolf film), "The Serpent and the Rainbow" (from famous horror director Wes Craven) and "Event Horizon." 
Worth seeing if you haven't yet: "American Psycho" (amazingly, the book is even more disturbing than the movie), "They Live" (more of an action movie really), "Children of the Corn" (I always knew that little kids were up to something), "From Dusk Till Dawn" (Harvey Keitel, Quentin Tarantino, George Clooney and lots of vampires), "Cronos" (a Mexican vampire film), "Donnie Darko," "Candyman," "Joy Ride" and "Red Dragon." 
The most bizarre movies you'll ever see: "Rabid Grannies" (yes, this is an actual movie -but good luck finding it somewhere), "The Last House on the Left" Gust disturbing), "Battle Royale" (literally a massive battle to the death), "Luther the Geek", "Ghoulies," "Motel Hell" and "Bubba Ho-Tep" (Elvis Presley in a retirement home fighting a mummy). 
Well, that should be enough for quite a few Halloweens. Some are good, some are bad and some are ugly, but hey -that's what Halloween is all about.

Man posing as cop shows woman his tattoos 
BATESVILLE, Ark. ­According to Independence County deputies, Steven Terrell's first mistake was telling Christine Gray that he was an undercover officer for the sheriff's department. Then he showed her his dri­ver's license. Then he asked her for a date. Then he was arrested. 
Deputies arrested Terrell on Wednesday night after Gray called dispatchers to ask whether police agencies had a Steven Terrell working for them. Gray said Terrell wore a jacket With a sheriff's badge on it and repeatedly showed her his tattoos. He said he had left his badge at home, but showed the woman his license. 

Genuine deputies traced Terrell to a Batesville home and found a jacket that matched the one Gray de"scribed. Terrell said he was trying to impress the woman. 
Survey: Quarter of dogs are stressed out 
LONDON -Man's best friend has certainly not been treated that way. 
More than a quarter of all dogs in Britain are as stressed out as their over­worked owners, and a third are prone to vomit or have diarrhoea as a result of neg­lect, a survey said on Thursday. 
"Dogs are very sensitive to their owners' moods and pick up on when they are unhappy, unwell or under pressure," said Chris Price, business manager with Direct Line Pet Insurance. 
The survey found 26 per­cent of more than 1,100 dog owners who were polled believed their furry friends are suffering from stress and 53 percent described their own lives as being stressful.

"They do a great job of making it convenient for stu­dents," he said. "It takes such little time out of your clay. For someone who is healthy· like me, it is something easy to do, and I would hope that if ever I needed blood, there would be others willing to give it."

Deep Throat revealer, alum to give lecture 
Special to the Observer 

Attorney and author John D. O'Connor, the Notre Dame alum­nus who revealed the identity of Watergate source "Deep Throat" earlier this year, will present a lecture titled "The Deeper Significance of Deep Throat" at 2 
p.m. Nov. 4 in the Carey Auditorium of the University's Hesburgh Library. 
Co-sponsored by the University's John W. Gallivan Program in Journalism, Ethics and Democracy and the Notre Dame Alumni A'>sociation under the auspices of its Distinguished Alumni Lecture Series, the pres­entation is free and open to the public. 
In an article for the July edi­tion of Vanity Fair. O'Connor, a 1968 Notre Dame graduate, broke the news that former FBI official W. Mark Felt secretly helped Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein investigate the misdeeds of President Nixon and his administration in the early 1970s. 
O'Connor currently is working with the Felt family on a book with the tentative title "A G­Man's Life: The FBI. Being 'Deep Throat' and the Struggle for Honor in Washington," which will explain Felt's governmental service and involvement in the Watergate all'air. The book, to be published by PublicAfTairs Books, is scheduled for release next spring. 



Physicist studies letters 
from Darvvin, Einstein 
Special to the Observer 

A new paper in today's edi­tion of the scientific journal "Nature" by Notre Dame physi­cist Albert-Laszlo Barabasi offers a fascinating glimpse into the communication pat­terns of scientific giants Albert Einstein and Charles Darwin. 
Barabasi is a pioneer in net­working as a unified scientific theory and the author of "Linked: The New Science of NetwoTks." His earlier research led to significant find­ings on how networks are structured and how they oper­ate. Of late·, he has begun examining how people behave in networks. 
In a paper published last May in Nature, Barabasi revealed the results of his studies of e­mail usage. He found that e­mail usage is not uniform, but, rather, is marked by bursts of activity. This occurrence of very long periods of inactivity separated by bursts of intense activity follows a scaling law termed a "heavy tailed process" by physicists. 
In the eras of Darwin and Einstein, letters were the main communication and Barabasi sought to determine if their patterns of communication fol­low a different scaling law than that associated with today's instant-access e-mail. He chose to study the correspondence of Darwin and Einstein because the Einstein Archives in 
Jerusalem and the Darwin Correspondence Project in Cambridge offer a detailed record of their respective cor­respondence, containing the sender, recipient and date of each letter.

UNITED NATIONS 

2,200 illicit payments made to Iraq 
Associated Press 
UNITED NATIONS -A former French U.N. ambassador. A fire­brand British politician. The presi­dent of Italy's Lombardi region. Name-brand eompanies like DaimlerChrysler and Siemens AG. 
Prominent politicians and more than 2,200 U.S. and foreign compa­nies stand accused of colluding with Saddam Hussein's regime to bilk the U.N. oil-for-food program of $1.8 billion. 
In a scathing indictment of the program, investigators issued a 623-page final report Thursday 

that meticulously detailed how the $64 billion operation became a cash cow for Saddam and more than half the participating compa­nies. The corruption came at the expense of regular Iraqis suffering under tough U.N. sanctions. 
The report blamed shoddy U.N. management and the world's most powerful nations for allowing the seam to go on for years. 
"The eorruption of the program by Saddam would not nearly have been so pervasive if there had been diligent management by the United Nations and its agencies," said Paul Volcker, a former Federal Heserve 
chairman who led the investiga­tion. 
Volcker and many nations said thn report underscored the urgent need to reform the United Nations. Earlier reports in his investigation have already led to eriminal inquiries and indictments in the United States, France, and Switzerland. 
The investigators found that com­panies and individuals from 66 eountries paid illegal kickbacks using a variety of methods, and those paying illegal oil surcharges came from, or were n~gistered in, 40 countries.

Roche suspends Tamiflu shipments

Associated Press 
GENEVA -Pharmaceutical com­pany Hoehe Holding AG said Thursday it temporarily suspended shipments of Tamiflu to private sector recipients in the United Stat11s to ensure that enough of the antiviral drug that experts believe is most eiTective in treating bird flu will be available for the influenza season. 
U.S. companies and large organi­zations apparently have heen hoarding the drug amid tht-·ead of bird flu and rears that the virus could mutate into a strain trans­mittable among people. On Thursday, Russia announced a n11w outbreak of the deadly 115N1 virus among poultry. 

"We've seen recently som11 very large purchases at the wholesale level, companies or large entities who are possibly hoarding Tamil'lu right now," said Darien Wilson, spokeswoman at Roche's U.S. onices in Nutley, N.J. 
The Swiss drug giant emphasized that the temporary suspension will not affect Washington's orders to build up a national stockpile of Tamiflu, the drug experts believe to be the best defense against a possible flu pandemic. 
"We have agr11ed orders with governments and w11 will fulf'ill them," said Al11xand11r Klauser, a Swiss-based Hoehn spokesman. "It is important that this is se11n sepa­rately from tho pandemic oiTers." 
lie said Hoehn's U.S. manage­ment proceeded with the suspen­sion because of the increasnd glob­al demand for Tarniflu.

operations standpoint it was efficient and expedi­tious." 
Ticket vouchers could be redeemed beginning Thursday from 7· a.m. to 4 
p.m. All vouchers can be redeemed for ticket booklets until 4 p.m. today. 
"Lines were extremely short [Thursday], a five-minute wait at most," said Berlo. 
"If you have the voucher you're going to be able to buy tickets so there isn't a rush to get over there," Kornhaas said. "I have all day tomor­row to go." 
A total of 2, 700 bracelets were initially available and "well over 1,000 booklets were picked up [Thursday]," said Berlo. 
Though many students waited in the JACC for the full two hours Wednesday, the Notre Dame ticket office noti­fied students by e-mail that there were still a "limited number of ticket vouchers" available. Tickets will be issued to Notre Dame stu­dents only beginning at 7 
a.m. today at Gate 10 of the Joyce Center.

The free event was meant to excite fans about the upcoming basketball season while also giving students a chance to guarantee tickets. 
"Without tying it to ticket distribution, it would have been a fun event to get pumped about the basketball season," Bulfin said. 
Still, some students were frustrated with having to wait hours in order to obtain vouchers. 
"For a campus that is so dependent on sports, I could­n't believe students were forced to choose between watching the World Series 
and getting tickets," sopho­more Eamonn Bahnson said. "Rather than improve the basketball arena or put a winning team on the court, the University and the bas­ketball program decided the best way to increase student excitement was to make them stand in the cold and watch the team take lay-ups for tw..o hours." 
The timing of the event proved to be a problem for. many students, who thought Wednesday night was not the best time as it conflicted with studying and other obliga­tions.

subsequently will not hold season basket­ball tickets as he has the past three years. 
"I think that they had a good idea going to sort of cel­ebrate the beginning of the basketball season," McCarthy said. "For me personally, it didn't work out with my plans. I had a football game at 10:30 p.m." 
Though McCarthy did not attend the event, he said he was not excited about the whole process when he heard about it. 
"Most people don't have anything to do in the early morning ... but a Wednesday night, I just thought it was sort of overkill," he said. 
But McCarthy was impressed with the speed at which ticket booklets could be purchased after a student obtained a voucher. 
"It was actually a pretty smooth process this morning. I didn't get tickets, but I went with one of my friends and it was pretty quick," he said. 
Student government is working on a ticket share program that will allow stu­dents to sell individual game tickets and alleviate the prob­lem of season ticket holders only attending 
to give your 
tickets to 

someone else if you're not going to be at the game. They want to fill the student section for every game," said Kornhaas, who will be selling his tickets to a friend before he leaves to study in London for the spring semester. 
"I know they're in a tough situation because the demand is higher than the number of tickets," said McCarthy, who plans on buying tickets to a few individual games now that he does not have season tickets. "I felt like they were trying to get people hyped up, but most people were just there to get tickets."

Philip Bess, a professor and the Director of Graduate Studies at the School of' Architecture, emphasized the cultural and practical needs for New Orleans to rebuild ­despite its hazardous geograph­ical location. 
"The deeper reason why New Orleans will be rebuilt has to do with its strategic location," he said. "The port at New Orleans is as important as at any point in the United States because of its location on the Mississippi River. The U.S. needs a city right there. It's a terrible place for a city to be located but a place where a city needs to exist." 
New Orleans must consider its natural environment as it moves ahead with rebuilding, Dean Michael Lykoudis of the School of Architecture said.

Imam Feisal Abdul Haul', presi­dent of' the American Sufi Muslim Association, said that because nothing has been more divisive between the three n~ligions, nothing pleads for more attention than an Arab-Israeli solution.

Ticket event poorly executed 
Students waited outside the Joyce Center for hours in the cold Wednesday for "Late Night with the Legion" in hopes of getting men's basketball tickets -fully prepared one year after tickets sold out at a torrid pace. But once inside, the eager students' excitement turned to disappointment as the first-ever "Late Night with the Legion" session unfolded. Energy waned quickly and the event did nothing to spike it. 
"Late Night with the Legion" was an event that meant well ­hyping up the men's basketball season is a perfectly good idea, but in this case it was poorly executed. O Jhe 
Thursday and today. 

And why did they sit? Only to watch the men's basketball team run mundane practice drills, among other activi­ties. Sure, there were vaguely entertaining contests, including a hamster ball race and a shootout between a student and Irish head coach Mike Brey, but nothing extraordinary. Nothing to make Irish fans truly enthusiastic about this year's basketball season. 
And so there were students watching the World Series on pocket televisions in the Joyce Center. Others weren't even paying atten­tion to the walk-on tryouts that took place because they were talk­ing with their friends, totally disinterested. Then there were the students who couldn't afford to spend more than two hours on a Wednesday night trying to get basketball tickets because of tests, projects, group meetings and other academic obligations. 
While the event itself was poorly executed, the overall process to get tickets was worse. So bad that two e-mails had to be sent to the student body so it could understand the process. A wristband to get a voucher to get a ticket book. That's just one too many steps. 
There has to be a better way to distribute tickets and generate enthusiasm for the basketball program. True, Notre Dame is a pri­marily football school. But that doesn't mean it can't have a suc­cessful ticket distribution system and at the same time generate enthusiasm for basketball. Since coming to Notre Dame, Brey has done a good job increasing student interest in the basketball pro­gram, but Wednesday night's event was a step back. If an event like "Late Night with the Legion" 
as Duke, Kansas and North Carolina do at "mid­
night madness"-type events as an example. Notre Dame is not any of those schools, but can make use of their modeL<> to help generate excitement for its program. 
As for tickets -although there were extra vouchers left from Wednesday -some sort of ticket exchange, whether it be on NDBay or through the selling of partial season tickets to students, needs to be implemented soon. This will be key in generating a loud, enthusiastic student section, as the more students that go to games, the more excited they will be. 
The reality of the situation is that Notre Dame is, and probably always will be, a football school first. But that doesn't mean bas­ketball doesn't play an important role here, and it doesn't mean it can't play the role it did in the 1970s when the Irish broke UCLA's legendary 88-game win streak. But the first step to generating the excitement that was once present is implementing a ticket process that truly serves the student fans. 
Americans have a morbid fascination of noting milestones each time an increment of measurement, regardless of size, is reached. As the year 2000 approached, some fought off computer meltdowns while others prepared for the second coming. 
This week was no exception in milestone calculations when the nwnberofAmerican soldiers killed in Iraq surpassed 2,000 while the nwnber of injured continued to climb beyond 17,000. 
Anyone attending the next Notre Dame foot­ball game can easily visualize how much carnage those numbers represent. The American death toll of more than 2,000 in Iraq is the equivalent of five Notre Dame bands. Focus on the band's presence in the stadiwn corner and then imagine seating four more bands in the sections above. 
The number of wounded American sol­diers represents one-fifth of a capacity crowd at Notre Dame Stadium. To visualize the injured Americans recovering from attacks, simply look at the Notre Dame stu­dent section extending from midfield to the comer of the end zone. Extend that seating arrangement to the stadium tunnel, but be prepared to add two rows of seating per week to keep pace with mounting causali­ties. 
An even more astounding visualization of the horrors of war is the image oflraqi deaths since the invasion in 2003. With estimates of civilian deaths nearing 110,000 in Iraq, in1agine Notre Dame sta­dium bulging in attendance for the University of Southern California game.

years ago. The total of those within this expanded stadiwn represents lives no longer walking this earth. 
Our fascination with nwnbers does not necessarily begin with increments ofthou­sands, hundreds or even tens. In early October, this writer's native state of Pennsylvania marked the second time in two months that it lost five National Guard soldiers in a single attack in Iraq. That most recent milestone happened to coincide with another, namely that Pennsylvania also sur­passed a total of 100 deaths. 
According to military officials, the five were killed near Ramadi while on a rou­tine patrol providing security for the con­struction of a railroad bridge. An explosive device struck their Bradley Fighting Vehicle, which was then attacked by small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades, setting it ablaze. The description of the incident's detailed, coordinated effort gives every indication that American troops will continue to suffer losses in the foreseeable future. 
The latest deaths increased to 104 the nwnber ofsoldiers with ties to Pennsylvania who have died in support of the U.S. war in Iraq. More than 3,200 Pennsylvania guardsmen are deployed in Iraq, the highest per capita in the nation. Only California and Texas have suffered more casualties in the war in Iraq. All but five of the 104 Pennsylvania soldiers died after May 1, 2003, when President Bush announced the end of major combat in Iraq. 
Our fascination with nwnbers does not necessarily limit itself to geographical regions. One of the first U.S. soldiers to die in Iraq, Jose Gutierrez, was an orphaned Guatemalan who at the time of his death was not even an American citizen. While some further set milestone measurements on ethnicity, others attempt to caleulate the nwnber of non-citizens currently in the active Armed Forces. 
According to the Pew Hispanic Center, while Latinos are nearly 10 percent of actively enlisted forces, they are over-rep­resented in the most dangerous assign­ments-infantry, gun crews and seaman­ship -and make up more than 17 percent of the front line forces. As ofAugust, Defense Department statistics show a casualty rate of more than 13 percent for people of llispanic background serving in Iraq. Ironically, more than 50 percent of the Hispanic population, neatly 18 million, live in the two states ITexas and California) with the highest overall number of deaths in Iraq. These states are historically large recruitment centers for the Armed Forces. 
Hispanics have been attracted in part to military service in response to a July 2002 executive order signed by President Bush. It expedites naturalization for aliens and non­citizen nationals who serve in active-duty status during the administration's "war on terrorism." Rather than waiting for as much as four years, the order allows non­citizens to apply for citizenship immediately upon arrival at their first military base. 
Defense numbers indicate that 35,000 non-citizens currently serve in the active Armed Forces, 15,000 of whom became eligible for expedited naturalization under the executive order. It is sobering to think that non-citizens in Iraq outnumber the total of all coalition forces other than Britain and represent about a quarter of the U.S. effort. Trying to visualize this dis­tinction demands yet another upper expansion to the stadium.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
The pre-eminence of life; a rejoinder 
Letters Oct. 13, 14, and 25 by Professors Donald Kommnrs, Alexander Hahn and James McKenna defending Dean Mark Roche's encouragement to vote for pro-abor­tion prt~sidential candidate Kerry are disappointing. They do makfl valuable points. a..<; did Roche in la..<;t year's New York 'limes op-ed; the need to ease the fmancial pressure which makes pregnancy especially challenging for women who are poor is an example. (Indeed, much wonderful work aimed at relieving this problem is done by pro-life cri­sis pmgnancy centers which provide support for pregnant womnn in need.) But there is too great a tendency by these limr faculty mnmbers to rationalize Kerry's pro-abortion position and to fail to acknowledge the gravity of the harm which his abortion advocacy causes. 
A-; Hoche correctly pointed out, abortion is like slavery 150 years ago: it is the moral L<;sue of our age. But would the dean have written of a candidate in 1850, "He's wrong about slavery, but good on other issues"? By what logic can we nxpnet a candidate, unable to recognize the inherent evil of intentionally killing innocent unborn children, to rnako sound moraljud!,rmenl<; about other issues? The dnan eorrectly identified the evil of abortion, but then drew the wrong condusion: That the best way to reduce the prnvalence of abortion was to vote lor the most strongly pro-abortion pmsidential candidate in our history. 
Hoche's op-nd wa..<; basnd on a fallacy: Erroneous statis­tics promotnd by Democratic National Committee Chairman lloward Dean and others implying that electing a Republican president would likely lead to a higher abor­tion raltl, and the election of Knrry to a lower one. '1\vo rncnnt reports disprove this. The Alan Guttmacher Institute reporl-; that abortion totals, rates and ratios have all dndined since George W. Bush took office in January of 2001. Thn U.S. Centers for Disea ..<;e Control also mports a decrna.-;n in abortions following President Bush's 2001 inauguration. And the abortion dndine in the '90s was not dun to pro-abortion Prnsident Bill Clinton; it occurred becuuse of advancns in ultra..-;ound and the national debatt~ ovnr partial-birth abortion (both of which raised awareness about the victim of abortion), and because of elforl<; by pro­life voluntners at crisis pregnancy centers providing help to pregnant women. 
What dons the Democratic Party platform say about abortion'? "Wn stand proudly for a woman's right to choose, consistent with Hoe v. Wade" -proud support for abortion on dmnand. And Kerry may have changed his position on a lot of issues, but never on abortion. A<; evidenced by his Senatn voting record and his relentlessly unequivocal posi­tion during the campaign, he wa..<; the most pro-abortion prnsidential candidate ever. Hoehn excused his Party's and his eandidate's support for legal abortion on demand: "The moral eondenmation of abortion, however, need not lead to the conclusion that criminal prosecution is the best way to 
limit the number of abortions." 

The pro-life movement is not about pointing the finger of blame at those who have had abortions. It's about prevent­ing deaths in the future. It's about clarity of teaching, and eschewing moral relativism and situation ethics when it comes to matters of life and death. 
Biology shows that a unique, separate human life begins at conception, when sperm and egg unite. This first cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 from the mother, 23 from the father. From conception onward, the unborn child develops continuously: Within three weeks, the baby's heart is beat­ing; by six weeks, the baby's brain waves can be measured. The blood coursing through the baby's body is not the mother's, but the baby's, and can be a different blood type than the mother's. By 11 weeks the baby has fingerprint.<;, all organs are present and all body systems are active. 
"Criminal prosecution" of the mother is not the pro-life movement's goal. The woman is the second victim of abor­tion. Women and girls are often pressured into getting abortions-by circumstances, by the culture. Were it not for the societal stamp of approval which results from abor­tion's legality-and the social pressures and expectations which that brings-most women would not feel pressed to consider such a destructive act. For women who do resort to abortion, the emotional scars (not to mention the physi­cal ones) sometimes last a lifetime. A much more positive, humane, compassionate solution for an unwanted child than abortion is adoption. 
Would there be illegal abortions if the unborn child were protected by law? Some, no doubt, but many fewer abor­tions than now. There are approximately twice as many abortions in the U.S. today as there were prior to Roe v. Wade. 
Prof!Jssor Kommers says Roche was advocating the "art of the possible" regarding abortion. But his op-ed advocat­ed an outcome that would have made it impossible to pro­tect the child in the womb. Kerry famously promised dur­ing last year's campaign, "I will support only pro-choice judges to the Supreme Court. Some may call this a litmus test." I Ie repeatedly pledged he would nominate only jus­tices who support Roe v. Wade. His election would have made legal protection for unborn children impossible for a generation or more. Why? Until Roe v. Wade is reversed by the Court, those state legislatures to which Kommers referred are powerless to defend the child in the womb. State lawmakers, bound by Supreme Court rulings, cannot protect the 3,500 babies who are killed every day by elec­tive abortion. 
Professor McKenna, a favorite of some of my children ­including a daughter currently in his class-emphasizes "the centrality of conscience rather than mere obedience to public authority," whieh, he says, was also Dean Roche's point. But corresponding with our duty to follow our con­science is our obligation to educate it. That's where some of our institutions are falling short. 
I did not describe Roche as a "proponent of abortion," or misrepresent hL<; "values, beliefs and purpose," as McKenna said. I wrote not about the dean's motives, but about the consequences of his readiness to embrace a can­didate who is, indeed, a "proponent of abortion." Hoche himself wrote about the evil of abortion, but our principles must inform our actions. Our endorsement.<; of candidates should reflect our priorities. 
As for McKenna's a..<;king why single out Hoche, it's because we properly expect more from those in leadership; we look for a higher standard, especially when they act in the name ofNotre Pame. As I said Oct. 12, my intent is not to be personally critical of Roche, about whom everything I hear is exemplary. This difference of perspective about emphasis and priority concerning a very serious issue is but a learning opportunity for us all.  
My use Oct. 12 of words such as "mi<;ta.ken" and "damag­ing" refer to Roche's understanding of the pro-life effort, and the effect of his op-ed on the pro-life cause, respectivn­ly. I did not say that what he wrote wa..<; "advocacy of abor­tion," as McKenna said. Rather, what he wrote showed a tolerance for abortion that L<; disturbing. Why cede tho Democratic Party to those who promote abortion, rather than fighting for the soul of tho Party and returning it to il-; 1ifi~-affirming traditions of the recent pa..-;t, a hnritago of defending tho "littln guy" and protecting those at the mar­gins oflife? 
Notre Dame is a Catholic university, but nvnn if it worn not, we here could clearly recognize abortion <L'> tho ulti­mate violation of the most fundamental human and civil right of a living human being-the right not to bn killnd. No reference to religion is necessary to understand that. 
The key point which the dean's op-nd misses is that tho law is a teacher. And in a systnm of govnrnment sueh a..<; ours. it is each citizen's responsibility to work for just laws that protect the weak from those who would do them harm. We must have the willingness and eourago to teach the college generation the truth about abortion; they need and deserve that from us. and their childrnn's lives will depend on it. This is our duty as professors and parent-; ­especially in a nation with government "by the people." We all are accountable.

Thn film is basnd on the book by llashinll llammitt, who is well-known as onP of thn piorwers of the hard­boiled style of crinw writing. The movie manages llammilt's complex plot, with all its double-and triple-crosses, with a ddt hand and has a cast that does such It good job with their charaetnrs that tlwir pnrformarH~ns are imitated to this day. 
As orw of the first and most famous of' Llw hard-boiled dP.tective films, it sets up tropns that have be<m snnn in elassie movies likP "Chinatown" and "Blade Bunner" and continues to be seen in eurrnnt films like "Thn Man Who Wasn't Tlwre."

The Maltese Falcon, thought to be incredibly valuable, is found to be utterly worthless. In spite of' the revela­tion about the falcon's true nature, those who have been seeking it refuse to give up because they refuse to accept the truth. 
The final resolution of the play reveals that Spade, while appearing to be a pawn for various unseemly char­acters to manipulate, has actually been controlling the action from the begin­ning. 
The final lines of the film reveal a great deal about the plot and the nature of treasures that people are willing to do anything to get. A police sergeant says of the statue, "It's heavy.

"The Maltose Falcon" is the stuff' that dreams arc made of. at least in the minds of most current and aspiring directors. The multiple lines of the plot are well-balanced by a great cast, great direction and fantastic cinematography.

SAN ANTONIO New Orleans Saints linebacker Courtney Watson was charged with drunken driving. 
Police said the 25-year-old Watson was driving on Interstate 10 when he was pulled over early Wednesday for erratic driving. They said an open bottle of beer was found in the front cup holder of the car. 
He was "combative" and failed a field sobriety test but refused a breathalyzer sample, their report said. Watson was released on $1,000 bond pend­ing arraignment Dec. 5. 
Watson, the starting middle linebacker, was a second-round pick out of Notre Dame in 2004. He was among 11 players cho­sen for the American Football Coaches Association's "Good Works Team" in 2003 for out­standing community service. 
Saints spokesman Greg Bensel said the team's security department was investigating. The Saints relocated to San Antonio after Hurricane Katrina.

Senior and junior duo set personal records in team's last meet 
By KEN FOWLER 
Sports Writer 
Two weeks after several Belles set personal records in the Manchester College Invitational, Saint Mary's returns to action Saturday at 11 a.m. in Kalamazoo, Mich. in the MIAA Championships. 
Senior Becky Feauto and jun­ior Sara Otto hope to lead the Belles in the race, which accounts for two-thirds of the conference title. 
Feauto said the team is hit­ting its stride at the right time. 
"The three seniors -myself, Megan O'Neil and Jess Eaton ­we all had [at least our] season [personal bests] at Manchester," she said. "We're right in line to peak as far as I can see." 

Feauto broke the 20-minute mark in her final collegiate five-kilometer race at Manchester, and she hopes to further her success in the six­kilometer MIAA race. 
"A 6-K, it is a different race, but I think you have to run it like it's a 5-K," she said. "You can't let it get to your head." 
Belles Head coach Jackie Bauters said she expects the momentum from Manchester to translate into good results, even though the race is 1,000 meters longer. 
''I'm really excited. It's going to be really com~titive within our packs," Bauters said. "I don't think it's so substantial a longer race endurance wise that it will affect [them] in a negative way." 
Bauters said she expects Fauto and Otto, who have fin­ished 1-2 for the Belles in all six 5-K races this year, to lead the Belles in the longer race this weekend. 
"I think they probably will finish one-two," Bauters said. 
"But I don't think the 3-4's will be too far behind." 
Bauters said Feauto should have a mental edge this week as opposed to the past, as well. 
"That 20-minute barrier, I know for me, was huge," she said. "Because once you break it, you're usually good to go. It's just doing it once [that is important]. 
"Mentally, it makes them so much more confident in their abilities." 
Otto also has a reason to be optimistic. She set a personal best at Manchester with a time of 20:03, good for No. 11 over­all in the race. 
Feauto said she expected Otto's momentum to carry over into this weekend. 
The Belles enter the race in fifth place in the conference standings, and Feauto said that among their goals is to catch Kalamazoo, which enters the race in third.

Teatn looks to snap Purdue losing streak 
By KEVIN BRENNAN Sports Writer 

Notre Dame has gotten off to a hot start in 2005, but the Irish have not yet encountered a team like Purdue -or a swimmer like Giordan Pogioli. 
The squad will face its biggest challenge of the season Saturday when it travels to West Lafayette to take on the Boilermakers, as Pogioli has dominated breast stroke races in collegiate swim­ming for the past three years. The Purdue senior swam in the prestigious World University Games this summer. Notre Dame head coach Tim Welsh could not find enough good things to say about the Purdue superstar. 
"He is on the USA swimming national B team, which means he is top 15 in the world," Welsh said. "He is straight up very good." 
But Purdue's talent extends 
beyond Pogioli. A national power year in and year out, the Boilermakers are No. 15 in the country heading into Saturday's match. 
"Purdue is a very good team," Welsh said. "In my time here [20 years], we have not beaten them. We know that we have a chal­lenge ahead of us going down there on Saturday." 
Notre Dame opened the 2005 season with two consecutive vic­tories. On Oct. 7, the Irish hosted and finished first in the Dennis Starks Relays. And Oct. 21, the team defeated Texas A&M in its first head-to-head matchup of the season. 
The early success gives the Irish a confidence boost heading into Saturday. "We're building on the direction that we've estab­lished and we are eager to keep it going," Welsh said.

As the season is dying down, onn of' the biggest rivalries in thn womnn's dorms still has yet to bo played, but the best Pasqucrilla will be dm:ided Sunday at 2 p.m. at Hiehle Fields.

Purple Weasels arc fired up to play this game. 
If Pasquerilla East wants to have a chance at beating the Purple Weasels, it will have to be able to move the ball against their defense, since Pasquerilla West's offense has shown to be suspect at times. 
The Purple Weasels also have to remember this game is impor­tant for their postseason rank­ing. 
"We have had a good season, and we really want to end on a good note going into the play­offs," Pasquerilla West junior Annie Brusky said. "This is a big rivalry and we feel we are going to dominate ... Even though we are already in, we are telling ourselves that we need to win this game." 
Welsh Fam vs. McGlinn 
Win and they're in. It's as sim­ple as that for the Welsh Family Whirlwinds as they square off with the unbeaten McGlinn Shamrocks Sunday at 1 p.m. at Riehle Fields. 
Tho Whirlwinds are seeking to rebound from a loss before fall brnak to Farley. 
"We understand what we have to do, and we'rn making the nec­essary changns to beat McGlinn," Welsh Fam wide receiver Kelley Buslwlle said. 
The Whirlwinds will have a sizeable task ahead of them as they take on a Shamrock team that has yet to allow any oll'en­sive points all season. McGlinn quarterback Becky Brown was quick to boast of her defense's accomplishment. 
"Our defense has been strong all year," Brown said. "We haven't been scored upon all season and that stat says it all." 
The Shamrocks bring a 4-0-1 record to the game that, with a win, will give them the second seed in the playoffs. McGlinn has already clinched a playoff berth and does not have a pressing need or sense of urgency to win this game. However, Brown believes her team -after a sea­son of quality performances -is ready to take on the Whirlwinds in its finale. 
"Our offense has really pulled together over the course of the year and our defense has been consistently strong," Brown said. "We're pretty excited and a ready to have a good showing at the game." 
But defeating the Whirlwinds, who are playing for their playoff lives, will be no easy task. 
"They're a good team, and they always play really well," Brown said. "It's going to be a rnally good game." 
Despite the challenge ahead, the Whirlwinds are looking to step up against the Shamrocks and overcome any obstaele on their way to the playoffs. They know their path to the Stadium runs through McGlinn.

feel they have the right stuff to accomplish the task. 

"I think we understand what is expected, in terms of finishing out our last few games," Saint Mary's coach Caryn Mackenzie said. "It is just a matter of us mentally locking in on that." 
The first of the remaining games begins at noon Saturday when the Belles travel to take on the Tri-State Thunder. The Thunder have struggled thus far, earning no wins in conference play and three wins overall. They have only managed to find the back of the net on eight occasions, while surrendering 72 goals. 
But Tri-State has experi­enced a resurgence of sorts in their last few contests. The Thunder defeated non-confer­ence opponent Anderson 3-0 and followed it up with a near win against Kalamazoo, falling 3-2. 
Kalamazoo quickly got up 3­0, but Tri-State fought back with two unanswered goals. However, time ran out before the Thunder could complete the comeback. 
But Kalamazoo is no pushover. The Belles lost to Kalamazoo 1-0 in an early season contest; a result that the Saint Mary's players felt should have turned out differ­ently. 
That game was not the only one that the Belles felt should have finished with a more favorable outcome. 
In their last game the Belles avoided defeat with a narrow 1-0 margin of victory over a weak Adrian team. Mackenzie attributed the close final score to the fact that her team played down to its opponent's level.

Seton Hall is 11-2-2 (5-2-2 Big East), with the third-best scoring offense in the country, averaging 


3.08 goals per game. 

The Pirates knocked Notre Dame out of the Big East tourna­ment last year, advancing 8-7 on penalty kicks. Notre Dame won the regular-season matchup 1-0 in 2004. 
Clark said the Irish have moved on from their loss on Wednesday. 
"We were at practice today and everybody's great," Clark said. "I think it's one of these things that you have no choice ... you've got to move on whether it's success or failure." 
Aside from the importance of the game, it's a ehance for the team to honor its seniors. 
"We always present flowers to the seniors on the last home game," Clark said. "We get a pic­ture, we take a picture of all of them together with Mary Ann [Spence, the team's academic advisor] that they get at the ban­quet." 
The seniors have filled impor­tant leadership roles in a difficult rebuilding year for Notre Dame. 
"The seniors have been superb," Clark said. "Some of them, like Benny Crouse, have played pretty mueh every minute ... then Ikeeper Justin Michaud] has been an absolute superb backup in every regard. 
"Of course the ones who have played -Tony Megna, John Stephens -have been excellent." 
For one senior, it was a disap­pointing season due to injury. 
"The one I feel sorry for is Dale Rellas," Clark said. "Dale obvious­ly was playing and then he kept picking up injuries, but he still stays very much involved and has been a very good captain."

Despite a strong effort, the Bdlns fell to i\lbion in three grunl­ing games 30-27, 33-31 and 36­
:~4. 
Belles coach Julie Schroeder­Bink eomplimnnted Albion on the loam's ability to play at the top of iL<> game at a erueial point in the season. 
"That was the best I've seen Albion play," Schroeder-Biek said. 
Albion eame out strong and dic­l.atnd play throughout mueh of the first two games. Sehroeder-Biek thought her team played well enough to eompete, but couldn't reach to the next levnl to get the win. 
"We were definitely chasing them much of those first two games," she said. "We know we could play better." 
Service errors and difficulty with serve reception also added to the Belles' woes narly in the match. 
Albion carried the momentum into the third game and jumped out to a 13-2 lead. The Belles seemed destined for quick defeat in the third until Marisa Gross provided a much-needed spark ofl' the bench. The sophomore entered and served the Belles to 10 straight points following the side out to knot the third game at 13 apiece. 
"Marisa really sparked us again tonight. She really brought our team together out there," Schroeder-Biek said. 
The teams battled point for point the rest of the way before i\lbion won the final two points to daim the marathon game. 
Schroeder-Hick put the loss in pnrspective. 
"It was just two teams lighting for lifth place," she said. "It took a lot ofstamina and we played hard, we just didn't get the result we wanted." 
The loss snapped a five-game conference-losing streak for Albion and marked the second time this year that the Belles fbll at ' the hands of the Britons. Saint Mary's lost a live-game decision to Albion on Oct. 8. 
Kristen Playko led the Belles' offense with 16 kills and also added 15 digs. Shelly Bender had 1 0 kills and 11 digs. Anne Cusack led the defense with 21 digs and Michelle Turley led Saint Mary's in assists with 33. 
The loss dropped Saint Mary's to No. 6 in the MIM behind Albion. The Belles' 5-11 conference record matches their mark from last season when they finished No. 7. 
The Belles will turn their atten­tion to the MIAA tournament next week where they will most likely face Alma in a first-round match Tuesday.

Irish will match· wits with Tigers 

By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 
The CCHA season slate is a grueling and cutthroat marathon with the likes of perennial pow­erhouses Michigan, Michigan State and Ohio State eontending for a title every year. But before the Irish must face these rivals, they have one more tune-up to get a feel for each other. 
The Irish will host a two-game non-conference regular season series with the Princeton Tigers today and Saturday at the Joyce Center. The puck will drop at 7:35p.m. and 7:05p.m., respec­tively. 
Notre Dame (0-2-0) last played Princeton in 2001 in New Jersey and came home with two wins, by margins of 2-1 and 4-2. The lifetime series between the two schools stands at a 9-2 Princeton edge. 
The Irish are coming off a tough western expedition last weekend, where the icers f'aeed No. 4 Colorado College and No. 9 Denver, losing 3-1 and 6-3. 
Notre Dame coach Jeff Jackson wants to see his team focus this weekend on its spr~dal teams game. The team gave up two shorthanded goals to defending national champion Denver, but went 2-for-8 on the power play, an excellent 25-per­ccnt conversion rate. 
Jackson felt Denver picked apart the Irish penalty kill and has worked to fix the unit in practice. He hopes to see his team create a more successful flow on these man-down and man-advantage situations. Puck control and protection remains a key tenant in Jackson's mind fi:lf dealing with the Tigr~rs. 
"Princeton is a real feisty tnam that is going to play really hard," he said. "They're a bit of a tran­sition team, where they will force you into making turnovnrs. They'll trap you in the turnovers and then they'll be explosive coming baek at you." 
Luckily for Jackson, his team is starting to form to his prcsna­son expectations. 
The lirst-year coach has fimnd a role model for the rest of the team in the line of freshman Erik Condra, sophomore Evan Rankin and junior Josh Sciba. Condra had three assists and Sciba scornd in the 6-3 loss to Denver. The trifecta has run Jackson's system to perfection, and in his opinion has fared the best for it. 
"The Sciba line has an identity to it," he said. "They skate, they pass, they're very tenacious, they read oil' of each othnr very well, and they execute the sys­tem real well." 
Notes: 

+The Irish took to the iee la<>t weekend in Colorado wearing gold helmets for the first time since the 1975-7 6 season. The helmets arc painted with the same gold metallic paint found on the helmeL<> worn by the liJOt­ball team. Irish equipment man­ager Dave Gilbert worked out a deal with Bauer to produce the Golden Dome-tinted hardware. They will feature a white eagc and an American flag on the back portion.

·Irish have back-to-back llleets against stiff colllpetition 
Notre Dame faces No. 10 California Bears at Rolfs today and Purdue Boilermakers in West Lafayette Saturday 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 
Following their season-open­ing victory in the Dennis Starks Relays, the Irish will be back in action this weekend with back­to-hack meets. 
The first begins tonight at 5 
p.m. against California Berkeley in the Holf's Aquatic Center. After having three weeks to reflect on the Stark Relays, the Irish will only have one night between their second and third meets as they leave immediately for Purdue for a Saturday meet with the Boilermakers. 
But Notre Dame coach Carrie Nixon doesn't seem concerned with the close proximity of this weekend's meets.

Nixon, who is the first female Notre Dame graduate to come back as a coach, com­peted on four Big East Championship teams (and had a medical redshirt during a fifth) while earning All­American honors twice. Nixon joins Knute Rockne, track leg­end Alex Wilson and Elmer Layden, a member of the Four Horseman, as the only multi­ple-time All-Americans to coach at Notre Dame. 
Nixon said she tries to avoid focusing on the company her All-American-turned-coach status gives her. 
"I try not to think about it too much because it freaks me out a little bit," she said. "I mean, it puts me in the same category as Knute Rockne and that's kind of crazy, but I'm doing my best to live up to it."

"We're looking forward to racing them," Nixon said. "One of our team goals is to be a top-1 0 team, in order to do that you have to know what top ten teams are like. I think we have a good shot at winning if we can take advantage of some opportunities and swim our best." 
Nixon's love of coaching began during her years at Notre Dame. 
"Nixon missed the 2000-01 season with a shoulder injury. She credits that year as the time she first learned how to coach at the collegiate level. 
"The year I was out, my sen­ior year, while I had a shoulder injury, I was basically a coach," she said. 
At 27 years of age, Nixon is only three seasons removed from her last year on the Irish roster. 
After graduating and com­pleting her fifth year on the swim team, she took a job as an assistant coach at Clemson. There she helped the Tiger men to their best season since 1952 and the women to their highest win total in 15 years. 
After only one season, Weathers hired her as an assis­tant at Notre Dame. Working with some of her former team­mates, Nixon saw the Irish win yet another Big East title. 
In April, Weathers retired and, after an extensive search, Nixon said Athletic Director Kevin White decided to pro-

"There were a lot of inter­views, but at the end of all of it the athletic department and I sat down and the conclusion we came to was that we need­ed to build it from the inside out," Nixon said. 
Nixon said she's excited for the opportunity to continue the recent Irish success.

Chase Anastasio and even start­ing cornerback Ambrose Wooden, I lord joined the multi­tude of contributors Saturday on a special teams unit that wel­comes the second bye week. 
"It's a great opportunity to get back to techniques and funda­mentals, work on skills and less scheming and less 'this is the looks we're going to see this week," Polian said Thursday.· "Let's go back to correcting foot­work and working on blocking and running and tackling tech­nique. Let's get back to basics." 
As Weis mentioned Monday, Thursday's practice was dedicat­ed as a "special teams day" to teach fundamentals to "both the first and second guys." 
Twenty-five players on Notre Dame's roster have seen their first Division-! football action this season, and special teams has been their primary outlet as coaches take looks at younger talent. 
Defensive lineman Casey Cullen and defensive backs Tcrrail Lambert and Ray Herring, to name a few, have seen significant action on special teams. And Hord, with the announcement that wide receiv­er Rhema McKnight will sit out the remainder of the season, could even crack the receiver rotation if it fits in the game plan, Weis said. 
"D.J. has given us a reason to be out there," Weis said. "Offensively, he played a little bit

up for Louisville and forget about Sunday's match, Brown knows her team can't and won't do that. The Bearcats are a solid volleyball team. They lost to Louisville 30-26, 17-30, 26-30, 28-30 earlier this season. 
With such a huge weekend ahead considering the Big East regular season race, Brown says her team will be more than ready. 
"The team will be motivated in that game. You might not even have noticed, but he was in there at the end of the game. But in that game plan, [Hord] got plenty of reps in practice last week with the possibility of him playing." 

Landri resting, healthy 
Defensive tackle Derek Landri hobbled into the locker room after injuring himself in the sec­ond half last Saturday. But he returned to the sidelines. 
"He was ready to go," Weis said. "For a time I thought that he was done. Next thing you know, I turned around, he was out there, sitting there ready to go. We fortunately came out of this game with very few things, nothing that was really signifi­cant and that's a good thing. No surprises." 
Hoyte is Lott quarter-finalist 
Irish linebacker Brandon Hoyte was named a quarter-finalist for the second annual Lott Trophy on Thursday. 
The award, which honors the Defensive IMPACT Player of the Year, is presented to a student­athlete by the IMPACT Foundation of The Pacific Club in Newport Beach, Ca. 
The Lott Trophy, named after legendary defensive back Ronnie Lott, honors a football player's on-and off-field performance. Georgia All-American defensive end David Pollack won the tro­phy last season in its first year. 
Hoyte (5-foot-11, 231 pounds) is Notre Dame's defensive cap­tain, leads the team with 56 tack­les (33 solo) and has a 3.35 GPA.

for sure," she said. "I don't think there's anything we need to do. There's going to be plenty of motivation. We know what's at stake. It's going to be great." 
Sophomore outside hitter and CVU.com National Player of the Week Adrianna Stasiuk agrees with her coach. 
"I think everyone's really excited," she said. "Everyone on 
the team is really into it. 
Everyone's giving 
100 percent." 
"The energy level 
is  really  high.  
We're  all  really  
pumped."  

This weekend the Irish will get the ultimate test. 
"Oh yeah, for 

sure," Stasiuk said when asked if the Irish, despite sitting at 18­1 and 8-0 in the Big East, still have something to prove to the country and to the coaches who vote in the polls. "We definitely have something to prove. We always have something to prove no matter what."

Quarters 
continued from page 24 
Morrissey's defense has han­dled that pressure better than a Kohler shower faucet, holding the opposition to 26 points and creating crucial turnovers that led to victories against O'Neill and Stanford. 
Siegfried's defense, on the other hand, has been nothing short of dominant. The Ramblers allowed only one touchdown-an 18-yard pass in a week two loss to Carroll ­in the regular season and in their last game pushed St. Ed's around for negative-1 0 yards of total offense. 
"The strong point of our team has been our defense. We've only given up six points, so we've been pretty solid all year -it's a solid group of guys there," Siegfried co-captain Kyle Reis said. "I guess the only thing we've been working on is the timing of our offense." 
Like Morrissey, the Hamblers favor a run-heavy offense that eats up clock, but touchdown dances have been few and far between for a team that scored only 29 points in four games. In fact, most of Siegfried's points have come courtesy of the long leg of kicker Pablo Nava. 
"Having him is huge, especial­ly with our offense not doing as well as hoped," said Martin of Nava, who kicked a 47-yard field goal against Stanford. "It's nice knowing that instead of just having to go for it on fourth­and-long from the 30, we can take three points." 
Still, the outcome will likely come down to who wants it more. 
"Obviously we want our sea­son to not end at this point," Klein said. 
Siegfried, however, has found some motivation in the death of a friend. 
"Just this season our name­sake Hay Siegfried passed away, and last game we dedicated the game to him," Rambler Ryan Reis said. "But really this whole season is dedicated to him and we'd like to win for him and the whole Siegfried family." 
O'Neill vs. Zahm 
The No. 8 seed Angry Mob of O'Neill (2-2) will try to become the first team to knock off unde­feated, No. 1 seed Zahm (4-0) Sunday at Riehle Field in the first round of Men's Interhall playoffs. 
Zahm running back Theo Ossei-Anto believes his team's unblemished record doesn't mean anything anymore. 
"At practice on Monday, we said, 'OK, we finished 4-0, but that's the last time we're going to mention it," he said. "This is the playoffs and it's win or go home. Our record doesn't mat­ter now." 
"This week at practice we've gone back to the basics and went over what we've done all year," he said. 
Captain Pat Gourdy seconded Anto's remarks but was disap­pointed in his team's turnout. 
"We've had a lot of trouble getting people to practice," he said. 
Anto is the main running baek and is always a threat to gain a lot of yardage. Against St. Ed's, he rushed for 175 yards. Quarterbaek Stan Wieland and receiver Jake Richardville lead the air assault. 
"We are very versatile and can pass and run well," Anto said. 
Both Gourdy and Anto said that the main ingredient to Zahm's success has been the defensive line, anchored by Bob McQuiston. 
"If they're doing well, every­one does well," Anto said. "I play safety and it's always nice on a pass play to turn around and see that the quarterback has been sacked." 
The victor will go on to play the winner of Siegfried and Morrissey. 
Sorin vs. Keenan 
Sorin captain Pete Lavorini is confident in his team's ability to upset Keenan this Sunday at 2 
p.m. in the opening round of the Men's Interhall playoffs. So con­fident he stole a page out of leg­endary NFL quarterback Joe Namath's playbook by guaran­teeing the upset of the defending champion Knights. 
When asked if he could guar­antee a victory, Lavorini responded affirmatively. 
"Yeah, I think I will," he said. 'Til guarantee a win this week­end." 
The Otters come into the post­season with a 2-2 record in the Blue league. The 'team's two losses came in a 10-0 defensive battle with Siegfried and a showdown with undefeated and top-ranked Zahm. The team started off the season with a close victory over St. Ed's, sneaking away with a 6-0 win on· a 40-yard touchdown pass in the second half from quarter­back Stu Mora. Mora's two favorite targets, Kevin Tooke and Chris Paley, will be expect­ed to step up big for Sorin against the Knights. 
The team's second win of the season was another shutout, as they defeated Fisher by a score of 7-0. With two shutouts and a total of 22 points given up all season, it is clear that Sorin builds it success from defense. 
"Defense is our forte, we have brought the pain all year and we are ready for whatever Keenan throws at us." Lavorini said. The team will need that nasty defensive attitude if they hope to defeat Keenan as its offense has only been able to produce two touchdowns all season. 
Keenan has also played solid defense throughout the year en route to their 3-1 record, which earned them the No. 2 seed. The team's only loss came against the Big Red of Dillon in the sea­son's second week. 
Sorin will need to come out and play its best football this Sunday to upset the Knights and end their hopes of a repeat championship. As far as the Lavorini guarantee, Lyzinski spoke for his team by saying, "We'll see who guarantees what on Sunday afternoon." 
Carroll vs. Dillon 
Dillon will try to upnnd No. 3 Carroll at 2 p.m. Sunday at Riehle Fields, with Carroll play­ing as the home team due to il'i superior seeding over the No. 6 Big Red. 
The Vermin went 3-1 in the regular season, losing their ftrst game by two points to Zahm and winning the rest. 
"We wanted to go 4-0, but we shook the loss to Zahm off and we're ready for a tough run to the championship," Carroll receiver Paul Tassari said. "Anytime you need to beat two big dorms from the Gold division it's going to be hard, but we think we can do it. We have a lot of momentum and have been praeticing all week." 
Tassari is integral to the team's air attack, with six touch­down catches on the season. Dillon's Gold League play means its record of 2-2, with wins against Keenan and Morissey and losses to Alumni and Stanford, does not necessarily indicate it is a weaker team than Carroll, which plays in the Blue League of smaller dorms. 
The Big Red earned their wins with a relentless clock-consum­ing rushing game 
"It's going to be a tough task to stop," Carroll coach John Tira said. "They're going to score their points and we'll score ours. Compliments to them and their season, but we think we can hold our own. We'll be more creative with our defensive schemes, running everything from a 3-5 to a 6-2." 
The Vermin plan to keep Dillon's defense on its heels with a passing game that was suc­cessful in the regular season. 
"We've had a: few intercep­tions, but some bad tip plays also," Dillon captain and offen­sive guard Romeo Acosta said. "Overall, our secondary is as strong as any dorm's. We're going to focus on getting pres­sure on the quarterback and forcing bad throws." The target of that pressure will be quarter­back and captain Kory Wilmot, who tossed touchdowns to six different receivers this season.

help their seeding in the NCAA Tournament. 
After Notre Dame's victory over Georgetown Sunday, Waldrum said his team is hoping to win the Big East tournament this year but only so much as it helps its chances to reach the College Cup. 
"Our focus [isl on the NCAA Tournament," he said. 
Waldrum's team lost the 2004 Big East linal to Connecticut, 2­1, but went on to win its six NCAA tournament games with solid defensive performances, giving up just 2 goals in those contests. 
The Irish enter the conference tournament this year with more offensive firepower and a more diversified attack than last year. 
Because of the addition of freshman forwards Kerri Hanks and Brittany Bock to the efficient tandem of Katie Thorlakson and Amanda Cinalli, Waldrum said he thinks his team will be tougher to stop in this year's conference tournament. 
"I think they're all going to have huge impact offensively," he said about his four top-scor­ing forwards. "Different teams are going to have different gameplans to play against not only Katie but also Hanks and Cinalli and Brittany." 
Thorlakson and Hanks became the first 50-point scoring duo since 2000 during Notre Dame's win over Georgetown Sunday. 
In the 2004 postseason, Thorlakson scored or assisted on 18 of Notre Dame's 22 goals en route to its second national championship. 
Waldrum said he doesn't expect that kind of dominating performance from any of his players, only because the Irish have too many offensive weapons to keep the others from finding the net. 

"I don't know if any one of our weapons will have [a perform­ance like Thorlakson's in 20041," he said. 
But he added a caveat. 

"If Katie wants to score 18 of our next 22, I'm more than OK with that." 
Though the diversified Irish offense and extra attention from opposing defenses may prevent her from putting up numbers like she did last year, Thorlakson said she is ready for another playofl' run. 
"I think I am Iin as good shape I this year [as last year]," she said after Sunday's 6-1 victory. 
Waldrum said that Thorlakson 

and the Irish have practiced well 
leading up to the quarterfinal 
match. 
"The intensity level of training 

has been very good," he said. 
"The focus of it has been very 
good." 
He said that bodes well for 

Sunday's game against 
Georgetown. 
"As long as we're focused ... 

we're going to be in good shape," 
Waldrum said. "It's just a matter · of executing the game plan."

The great eight 
Ramblers and Manorites will kick off playoff action 
By JACK THORNTON, CHRIS HINE, DAN MURPHY and BEN VINCENT Sports Writers 
When Morrissey and Siegfried collide this Sunday in first round playoff action at Riehle South Field, spectators can anticipate a hard-nosed battle between two defensive powerhouses. 
Both the Ramblers (3-1) and the Manorites (3-1) rode into the playoffs on their defenses, which made up for low-scoring offensive units. 
"It takes us a while to score points because of the 'style we run, so after we score we put a lot of pressure on our defense to stop our opponents," said Manor captain Nick Klein, who leads the team in touchdowns.

Brian Polian are rotating through special teams, it's no wonder the two players collided going for the ball. 
"There were about three or four issues that happened during that game on special teams that I wasn't very happy with, but I thought it was a very average day by our special teams unit," Weis said. 
Hord, on his first college kick­off return, scooped up the ball and ran three yards before being tackled. Along with Grimes, Justin Hoskins, Brandon Harris,

Irish enter tournament streaking 
Four forwards provide for a balanced attack against Georgetown 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Writer 

The Irish think they are peak­ing at the right time. 
Since losing badly to Marquette on Sept. 30, Notre Dame has turned a corner and become one of the hottest teams in the country in time for the Big East Tournament. 
"We've gotten in that groove -into that second gear -for the end of the season," Irish head coach Randy Waldrum said. "[The team is] playing with a lot of confidence and they're playing with focus." 
With a 6-1 victory over Georgetown Sunday, the Irish extended their winning streak to seven. During the four-week tear, Notre Dame has outscored its opponents 32-1, posting six shutouts along the way. 
The Irish hope to keep that winning streak alive in a quar­terfinal matchup Sunday at 1 
p.m. -again against the Hoyas on Alumni Field. 
Waldrum said he is confident his team will continue its good play but knows there are dan­gers in facing a team twice in a week. 
"You worry about overconfi­dence," he said. 
Notre Dame only found out it would play Georgetown late Thursday night when the Hoyas defeated Syracuse, 1-0, in a tournament play-in game. 
Before that game, Waldrum said he was not sure which team he would rather face. 
"That's a question we've been kicking around all week," he said. "In some ways we would like [to face] Georgetown, ... but there are advantages in fac­ing Syracuse." 
The Irish think they can get past the Hoyas to advance in the conference tournament and
