Jenkins calls pilgrimage part of ND mission 
CLAIREKELLEYfTheObserver University President Father John Jenkins stands outside Santa Susanna, a church In Rome, Tuesday. 
By MADDIE HANNA Associate News Editor 
HOME -For University President Father John Jenkins, his trip to Rome this week is about much more than attending ollicial meetings or even cement­ing relationships with Vatican ollicials -it's a connection to the Catholic Church so profound it can hardly be described in words. 
"You can't walk around Home without being struck by the lay­ers of history," Jenkins said Tuesday. "To be Catholic, as someone said, is to be Catholic in space -that means you're con­nected with people throughout the world -but also in time, a tradition that runs through cen­turies. I think at a personal and spiritual level, to become more deeplr, aware of that, is beneficial to us. 

Jenkins, the University Ollicers and the Board of Trustees arrived in Rome Sunday night and will leave Friday morning. Otlicial Board of Trustees confer­ences began Tuesday and will culminate today in an academic conference, where Provost Thomas Burish will award two honorary degrees.

Saint Mary's students don't need to travel far for an intercultural experience. In faet, they don't even need to leave campus. 
The Intercultural Living Community (JLC) on the fourth lloor in North Hegina Hall gives students the opportunity to experience ethnic and cultural diversity in their everyday lives. 
The Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership (CWIL) began the program three years ago in an efTort to promote awareness of cui­

Exhibit unites Latino poets, artists 
By NICOLE ZOOK Assistant News Editor 
Two art forms merged into one as "Poetas y Pintores: Artists Conversing with Verse" opened in the Moreau Art Galleries at Saint Mary's Jan. 27. 
Twelve Latino visual artists chose works by 12 Latino poets and used them as inspiration for brand new artworks ranging in style from abstract to digital representation. The poems were displayed next to each piece of artwork exhibited, cre­ating a truly multi-genre expe­rience for the over 7 5 patrons who visited the gallery on open­ing night.

Experts discuss future of lVar-ravaged Iraq 
By MARCELLA BERRIOS 
News Writer 

Almost three years after the United States overthrew Saddam Hussein's dictator­ship in Iraq, three Notre Dame scholars with opposing viewpoints met again in the auditorium of the Hesburgh Center for International Studies Tuesday to address the question "Iraq: What Now? Should the U.S. with­draw, stay the course, or engage more deeply?" 
The panel of experts includ­ed the commanding officer of Notre Dame's Army HOTC program, Lt. Col. Kelly Jordan. Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies faeulty assoeiatn and assistan t political science pro­fessor Daniel Lindley and sen­ior fellow for the Kroe Institute and political seienee professor George Lopez.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Life after lifeguarding 
It wasn't that long ago that lifeguarding was the most glamorous job around. Something about being a lif11guard was just so appealing. Maybe it dated back to "The Sandlot" and that magic moment between Squints and Wendy Peppercorn. It could have 
Kate Gales

been the fact that mothers banned their children 
Associate

from watching "Baywatch" until the Sports Editor seventh grade. It could have just been the power wielded by the whistle. Whatever it was, being a lifeguard wa<> considered "hottest summer job ever." 
It could have been the power trip-the lifeguards ruled the pool. They perched above the rest of us at local pools, observing the sunbathing teenagers and spla<>hing teenagers from behind mirrored wrap­around sunglasses and smears of zinc oxide. Lifeguards got to go behind the front desk. The girls at the snack bar always served them free food. All I know is that at 15, it didn't get any cooler than lifeguarding. 
Now, though, the magic word is "intern­ship." I know people who have been prepar­ing for today's career fair since 2004. Actually, I could probably rattle off the names of half a dozen people who have been preparing for this day since approximately the second grade. But for those of us who didn't have our career plans mapped out before we mastered the multiplication tables, it's been a little harder to figure out which direction we're going to pick. 
Nowadays, lifeguarding, waitressing and babysitting just aren't good enough. Bartending was glamorous at 18, but doesn't cut it the summer before you graduate. . Folding shirts at Ralph Lauren doesn't impress anyone, except your sister who loves the employee discount. Nowadays, it's investment banking and Big Four accounting firms who rule the world of the business school juniors. You can rattle ofl'the top marketing firms, management programs and IT salaries for summer internships, and "leadership programs" are a cutthroat busi­ness. One day, your friend's sleeping through class-the next day he's flying to New York for job interviews. 
It's been hard to condense 20 years of my life into a resume. I had to leave out my sixth-grade Geography Bee win, clippings of my best columris, my nearly flawless driving record and 13 years of piano lessons. But today, I'll put on my suit (which already makes me feel like a high-powered execu­tive, not a lowly intern) and hand out copies ofmy resume to recruiters at the JACC. The recruiters probably won't know that I already have a job here at The Observer where I work until 5 a.m. without batting an eye. They probably don't care that in the work cafeteria, I would always be willing to share the good parts of my lunch. It might be irrelevant that I make amazing chocolate chip cookies and that I have a weakness for romantic comedies. 
It's hard to really stand ~mt at a career fair, after all. Maybe that was the real appeal of the life­guard's stand.

The Saint Mary's eommunity is looking a little more lit these days -due to students and faculty getting motivated and dumping some "plump" in a new fitness program at the Angola Athletie Center. 
The "Dump your Plump" pro­gram was recently renamed "Bolles for Fitness" due to the number of women who signed up and in order to promote the more positive aspects of exer­eise and fitnnss. 
Director of Athletics and Hecreation Lynn Kaehmarik said she is impressed with tho largo turnout for the program and expects it to go well. 
"I expect the program to run very eiTeetivnly and with lots of fun· and motivation," she said. "I am very exeited to sec Angela even more crowded than it already is with inereased fitness aetivity." 
While this is the first time Saint Mary's has attempted to launch a group f'itness pro­gram, "Belles for Fitness" is alrPady so successful that stu­dPnts are not the only ones tak­ing advantage of the program -it has attracted many faculty and staff members as well. 
Ono strong aspect of "Belles for Fitness" is the focus on group effort, which eneourages motivation and persistence within each team as wp,ll as with all of the women partici­pating in the program. The competition aspect helps as well, with teams of' two to 10 participants competing against each other for prizes and recognition. 
Several teams have ehosen a fun and creative team name. Team names range from "Making Spandex Look Good" and 'Til Take Fries with that" to "Why have a Six Pack when you can have a Keg." 
Each team member is required to work out for a min­imum of 200 minutes per week (an average of about at least 30 minutes per day). If a partici­pant does not make the 200 minutes, the entire team loses points. Each week there is a "huddle" where teams gather to help encourage each other and are can do a weigh-in, an optional part of the program. Contestants may have a goal to lose anywhere from zero to 10 pounds on an individual basis. 
Bridgotte Van Schoyck, a physieal education instructor, began the program at tho College after running tho same program at a Gold's Cym Athletic & Medical Center in Bull'alo, Mich. Van Sehoy1~k said she found it to be vory success­ful at Gold's and hopes to aehieve the same success at Saint Mary's. 
"The women really seem to be excited about it. We are try­ing to make exereise fun," she said. "The contest runs right up to the week before spring break so I think it will bn suc­

~~essful." 
"Belles for Filrwss" began Monday and nnds right bnf'orn spring break. In order to address other issues assodatnd with exereisn and dieting, tlwre will be weekly lectures during the program. 
Talks will range from topics sueh as leaming to monitor heart. rates to nutritional facts and in formation. The Jnetures are meant to inform partiei­pants about problems with nat­ing disorders and over-exerdsn that many women face. 
Van Schoyek said she could not give an exaet number at this point, but handnd out dosn to 300 rngistration f'orms. 
Many students said they are flxcited to bn participating in tlu1 program. 
Freshman Brittany Fitzpatrick said she likes the eompetition aspect. 
"It's better to have a eompllli­tion bneause people arn natu­rally competitive," Fitzpatriek said. "Thn prizes and timing of' it ending right bnf'ore spring brnak help a lot as wnll." 
Krist1m Briekley -a fresh­man nwrnbllf of the learn "Will Work for Food" -said .she is exeited about the tnam aspect of' the program. 
"We exercise al'ter elass together," she said. "It makes it morn l'un and thorn is more motivation to go and work out."

Archbishop William Levada, Pontifical Council for Justice and the Peace president Cardinal Renato Raffaele Martino and Congregation for Divine Worship prefect Cardinal Francis Arinze -are dispersed throughout the week. 
Those meetings, Jenkins said, are one of Notre Dame's main reasons for the trip. 
"To build relationships [with the Vatican] as we would with people in the government in the U.S., or any organization we interact with -that's one dimension," Jenkins said. 
But not the only dimension. Jenkins said he views the trip as a spiritual encounter for 
himself,  the  Officers  and  
Trustees.  
"It is a  pilgrimage for us,  

which means that it's a journey to a place that has importance for Catholics because it was the plaee _to which St. Peter came to preach the Gospel, and his

with the mission of the universal Church ... [and] we have become conseious of that, we understand our role in the uni­versal Church." 
But Jenkins will not meet pri­vately with the pope during the trip. The reason, both Senior Executive Assistant Father James McDonald and Vice President for Publie Affairs and Communication Hilary Crnkovieh said, is that Pope Benedict XVI does not feel "comfortable" with addressing private audiences. 
Jenkins said while the Pope "understands English very well," he is "not as comfortable in speaking it" and often uses a translator. 
Jenkins met the former Cardinal Hatzsinger during a 2001 trip with then-University President Father Edward Malloy. 
"It was interesting," Jenkins said. "He is a somewhat quiet person. He doesn't come on strong. He is very thoughtful in his responses ... He's very interested in universities and very interested in Notre Dame and its work." 
Jenkins said he hoped Notre Dame would work together

sion." 
There's a "sense of mutual understanding," he said, that allows collaboration on com­plex, challenging issues. 
"And a university, [with] its intellectual resources, its inquiry, its research -it has to be at the center of confronting those questions and giving good answers to them," Jenkins said. "So I think those in the curia see that we need to work together so the Church can be enriched by Notre Dame's work and Notre Dame can be enriched by its connection to the universal Church." 
That connection, Jenkins said, is rooted in the Church's physical history -history that can be discovered in Rome. 
"The Catholic Church has its origins in the life and death and resurrection of Jesus Christ and what that meant. To be Catholic is to be connected with that," Jenkins said. "In the Catholic Church, that connection is made in particular ... through -what's called the visible Church, that succession of bish­ops that 'trace their origin back 
aspect of 
Catholicism, "because what really unites us is the faith each of us have, and have together." 
The title of today's academic conference, "Contribution of Catholic Universities to the Church and Culture," seems to resemble the topic of Jenkins' series of addresses last week ­academic freedom and Notre Dame's Catholic character. 
But Jenkins said the trip to Rome was planned more than a year ago and called. any corre­lation between his addresses last week and today's discus­sion purely coincidental. 
"The reason I gave that address at that time was simply because eertain performances were coming up, we had dis­eussions behind the scenes, and I felt it was an appropriate time to bring those discussions into the open and in fact [into] the whole community to partici­pate," Jenkins said. "It made sense to do that at the start of the semester, but there was no calculation [related to RomeJ." 
Jenkins said while he would discuss academic freedom broadly with the Vatican ofTi­cials he meets, he would not focus on the details of Notre Dame's situation or the campus controversy surrounding the Queer Film Festival and "The

Vagina Monologues." 
"I don't expect those [specific issuesJ to come up, but certain­ly to talk about our mission," he said. "We see our mission con­nected to the Church, and so obviously it makes sense to dis­cuss that and to help them understand what we're doing, help us connect with that broader mission." 
Jenkins has studied Pope 
John Paul II's writings on issues of academic freedom, specifi­cally the 1998 Ex Corde Ecclesiae document on Catholic universities. 
"I think that has to be a part of reflection on who we are," Jenkins said. "It's a constant item of reflection for us. What does it mean to be a Catholic university in the 21st century? All of our reflection on that must be informed by all rich­nesses of this tradition that goes baek two millennia, part of which is what John Paul wrote, but also what other people said. I think [from I the extent of this whole tradition, our reflection will be better, and we'll be a better University."

European markets may consolidate 
Associated Press 

LONDON -The New York Stoek Exchange wants "a leadership role," Euronext is "keeping all its options open," and Australia's Maequarie Bank Ltd. sees clear potential in get­ting a slice of the market ­European stock markets are hot properties again. 
Macquarie and its $2.65 billion bid for the London Stock Exchange is the wild card in the paek as the players and analysts alike weigh the options or who might tnam with whom. 
"Tiwy all consider themselves to be on the global playing field and, as such. it's across the board eonsolida­tion bncausn the big guy wins," said Clem Chambnrs, ehiel' exeeutive of stock Web site /\DVFN. "In thn nxchange business. big is beautiful ­thorn's no sneond place."

But the potential deals don't stop there. Euronext -which already owns the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon stock exchanges -said carlinr this month that it is still con­sidering "all options" after major stakeholder New York hedge Fund /\tticus Capital urged it to revive stalled merger talks with Deutsehn Boorse.

Gulf Coast. 
Pre-Katrina, the Teach for America program had 150 corps members in and around New Orleans. Floods from the disaster damaged the school where Hentges taught beyond repair, and she was forced fmd another way to serve. 
Some corps members returned to an outlying parish school in New Orleans that Katrina left unscathed; others worked for disaster recovery centers. Hentges, however, chose to work in Houston. She and 35 corps members chartered a school for New Orleans students who would remain -at least temporarily ­in the city to which they had been evacuated. 
The volunteers acquired a school building that had recently been closed due to low enroll­ment, a surprisingly nice facility, Hentges said. The quickly obtained one-year charter allowed classes to begin Oct. 3, a date that could have been earlier if not for Hurricane Rita. 
Although none of her former students would follow her to the charter school, Hentges said she does recall seeing four or five of them in the Astrodome in Houston. While Hentges remains unaware of the location of many, she said she has located a few more former students in Atlanta and Dallas. 
As for her current students in Houston, Hentges said many of 
· their families are not yet stable in their new envrron­ment. Some fami­lies still remain in hotels. Housing is not yet stable in New Orleans, so returning in the immediate future is not an option, although Hentges said the vast majority wish to return to their home. "A lot of kids are 
very homesick," Hentges said. "It's only natural, coming from an area where the people have so much pride in their culture and their city." 
During the first few weeks of classes, teachers placed more emphasis on the needs of stu­dents than on covering new material. As a kindergarten teacher, Hentges said she allowed her students to nap if needed, or talk to the in-house psychologist about issues result­ing from the hurricane. 

The school received a number of grants for group therapy, and Hentges said she hopes this will

make a real impact on the children. Since Teach for America focuses on those areas most in need, Hentges said she feels the stu­dents have been placed in a tremen­dously tough situa­tion, realizing many already had issues to deal with before Katrin<J. 
Hentges made a few trips back to New Orleans since 

the devastation of the hurricane. She said while the breadth of the destruction was difficult to wit­ness, the city has been making a slow but steady comeback. 

"One month after, the city was hard for me to see,". Hentges said. "There are definitely still areas that need to be cleaned up, but the city is beginning to show signs of vibrancy." 
Despite the challenges, Hentges said she still feels lucky in her opportunity to serve. 

"Teach for America is a great experience," she said. "If you are interested in any aspects of edu­cation, I would definitely recom­mend it. Once you walk into the classroom, you realize that it is not only about education, you are dealing with so many social issues."

Events usu-Afanasjeva said she values having people from different cultures as her neighbors. Native to Latvia, Afanasjeva is a junior at the College and has spent two yoars as a rnsidnnt in tho Intercultural Living Community. Afanasjeva said shn enjoys living on the floor so she can not only loarn about other pnople's cultures. but share her own nxperienees. 


"My favoritn thing is just hav­ing difl'nnmt people around me from different backgrounds," she said. "Last year, I just made a lot of frionds, and somn of us still live together." 
Both Hodges and Aranasjova said thny recommend living in the Intercultural Living Community to all Saint Mary's students. Hodges said while you can't force people to live on the 11oor, she thinks all stu­dents eould benefit from the experience. Afanasjeva said she recommends the program bneause it allows students who have never been exposed to diverse backgrounds to learn how to live with people who may be difl'erent from them. 
"A lot of people arn interest­ed now going into something to do with other countries, like international business, and I think it would rnatly benefit them," Afanasjeva said. "Mooting other peoplo and doing those aetivities also helps you get to know yourself and who you are." 
Despite positive word of mouth advertisement from the students who live in the ILC, Hobison said the most dillieult aspect of her job is raising awareness and intorest about the program. Advertising the living community in a way that will grab students' attention is hard, she said. 
"One of the most difficult things is getting the word out," Hobison said. "I know thorn arc still several students who don't know about it, and I am trying to learn how to advertise in a way that thnse students will pay attention." 
Afanasjeva also said she thinks the program niH1ds an inernase in advnrtismnent and awareness about the benefits to living on the floor. 
"I think we need to improve the marketing of this program beeause I don't think that most people know it exists," Afanasjova said. "It is a good opportunity for people to learn a lot of things about culturn. It is ono thing to have a class. but it is another to actually meet pnople who come from a difl'nr­ent background." 
Hobison said it is also dillieult to dispel the misconception that !loor is only for studnnts of eolor. In the past, Hobison said, the majority of program partie­ipants have actually been Caueasian. 
"The program is open to all studonts who are curious and want to know more about other cultures and about their own culturo, because everyone has a culture," she said. 
As for the future of tho pro­gram, both residents and Hobison said with strongnr advertising and promotion, thoy hope more students will capitalize on the opportunity. Hobison hopes to eventually nxpand the program to several floors in Hegina I !all. 
"At most other schools and universities, international stu­dents and American students don't even livo in the same building," Hobison said. "llnro at Saint Mary's, international students and American stu­dents can live togethor. And that is a unique opportunity."

Unarn1ed Airman shot by deputy after chase 
Associated Press 
CHINO, Calif. -A videotape rnlnasod Tunsday shows a slwr­ifl"s deputy shooting an unarmnd Air Foree policeman who recent­ly returned from Iraq as he appnared to obey an order to get up olr the ground. 
KTLA-TV broadcast a 40-sec­ond clip it .said eame from a Chino resident who videotaped Sunday night's shooting, which followed a I 00 mph ear chase. 
Snnror Airman Elio Carrion, 21, was listnd in good condition at Arrowhnad ltegional Medieal Center in Colton. lie was shot thrnn times in the chest. ribs and leg, his father-in-law, Ernesto Paz, told KTIA-TV. 
State and fednral investigators arn reviewing the case, ollicials said. 
Carrion was a passenger in a Corvette that. eraslwd following a brinf chasn, authorities said. 
Amateur photographer Jose l.uis Valdnz told The Assodatnd Pross that hn made the video aftl~r the car erashed into the wall in front of his home. KTIA aired the vidnotapn early Ttwsday, then distributnd it later in the day. 
The dark, grainy picture shows Carrion lying on the ground next to the car. talking to a silhouet­tml oflienr who is pointing a gun at him. Carrion supports himsnlf on one arm and his face is brightly lit by the oflknr's nash­light. 
Carrion is hoard tolling the 
ollicer he is unarmed and is in the military. At one point, a voiee is heard saying several times: "Get up." 
Carrion says: ''I'm gonna get up." As he rises, at least four shots are fired and Carrion col­lapses, crying out in pain. 
"Shots fired! Shots fired!" someone shouts. 
In a telephone interview con­ducted in Spanish. Valdez said aftor the shooting, Carrion asks the deputy. "Why did you shoot me if you told me to stand up?" That alleged exchange cannot be heard on the video. 
The deputy, whose name was not released, was placed on paid administrative leave, a routine procedure in officer-involved shootings. 
Carrion was not charged with a crime, although the incident romained under investigation, according to sheriff"s spokes­woman Hobin I Iaynal. 
The driver of the Corvette. idontified by authorities as Luis Fernando Escobedo, 21, was arrested for investigation of felony evading. 
Carrion and Eseobndo had left a party at the homo of Carrion's parnnts to drive to a store, said the airman's wife, Mariela. 
An Air Foree spokesman, Lt. Frank I lartnett. said Carrion is a soeurity ollieer at Barksdale Air Force Base in Shreveport, La. Carrion joined the Air Force in January 2003 and recently returned from a six-month tour in Iraq, Hartnett said. 

Courts issue abortion rulings 
Partial birth ban act declared unconstitutional at federal level 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -Two federal appeals eourts on opposite sides of the country deelared the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act unconstitutional Tuesday, saying the measure lacks an exception for cases in which a woman's health is at stake. 
The first ruling came from a unanimous three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Hours later, a three­judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan issued a similar decision in a 2-1 ruling. 
The New York decision affirmed a 2004 ruling by a judge who upheld the right to perform the procedure even as he described. it as "gruesome, brutal, barbaric and uncivi­lized." 
Chief Judge John M. Walker, a relative of former President George Herbert Walker Bush, said the court was "compelled by a precedent to invalidate a statute that bans a morally repugnant practice, not because it poses a significant health risk, but because its application might deny some unproven number of women a marginal health b<~nelit." 
He called on the Supreme Court to require a law's chal­lenger to prove how women will be harmed by the law. 
"Is it too much to hope for a better approach to the law of abortion -one that accommo­dates the reasonable policy

judgments of Congress and the state legislatures without departing from established, gen­erally applicable, tenets of con­stitutional law?" Walker wrote. 
Tuesday's ruling was marked by an unusually sharp dissnnt by Judge Chester .J. Straub, who said he believed Congress' determination that the proce­dure was never medically nec­essary to protect a woman's health was well founded and supported by a lower court rul­ing. 
"Allowing a physician to destroy a child as long as one tm1 remains within the mother would place soeiety on the path towards condoning infanticide," he said. · 
He added: "I lind the current expansion of the right to termi­nate a pregnaney to cover a child in the process of being born morally. ethically and legally unacceptable." 
The Calili1rnia court said the law was vague and so broad that no other remedy wa.<.; possi­ble except to throw it out. 
"We aro reluctant to invali­date an entire statute," Circuit Judge Stephnn Hninhardt wrote. "I lowever, after eonsidering all of thn obstaeles to our devising a narrownr remedy, we con­elude that sueh is our obliga­tion." 
The panel also rejeeted argu­ments made by the Justice Department that there was gen­eral agremnent among doetors that such late-tnrm abortions were never necessary to pre­servo the lwalth of a woman.

There are times when the privilege that I have as a columnist in this paper is brought to the forefront of my attention. Today, as many other valid and lucid voices are contending for the limited space of this venue, while I am granted automatic entry, is one of those times. It is in light of my responsibility to those other voices (whom I wish other columnist<; were more concerned about) that I addrnss my reilec­tions to University President John Jenkins and to the Notre Dame community across the world. 
I firmly believe this discussion must begin with a thorough grounding in history, for if it fails to do so, then it may well fail at its purpose. 
Academic freedom and il'i intellectual and spiritual brother, religious freedom ­although embraced and aceordnd great value for many centuries throughout the world -have only recently made an impact on the core of the Catholic Church, and to this day are not always accorded respect by those in power. Any who are skeptical of this point should read a collec­tion of papal encyclicals, published prior to Vatican II, which outline the "ideal" Catholic state -a state in which religious freedom is nonexistent and adherence to doctrine is a matter of law. 
It may be that all human organizations, no matter how noble, tend to tyranny and stasis unless there is constant vigilance on the part of those who love them. This includes the Church, and this includes the University. 
To its credit, the Church reversed its

position on religious freedom during Vatican II, largely under the guidance of a notable academic it had previously cen­sored. I Iowever, today that culture of free­dom is still both young and fragile. 
When Father Theodore Hesburgh was president of the University, the Church still maintained and enforced a deplorable tool called the Index of Banned Books. This list included most of the great works of Western social, politieal and philosophical literature. By Canon Law, no student or faculty member could access tl1ese banned books through the University library with­out a signed excflption from Hesburgh. It is to his great credit that Hesburgh chose to issue tlHlse exceptions carte blanche, in a minor but critical rebuke of a central authority that did not yet understand the core values of his University. 
At length, the Index wa'> mpealed, and it is now mostly forgotten. In such a way are ancient mountains worn down with rain­drops. Yet I believe that the lesson of the Index points to the most crucial point in this discussion. 
Full academic freedom in the Church is a check on the power of the central authori­ty. It was not conceived as such, and its defenders rarely apologize it this way, but this is the practical reality. Church leaders, divinely guided or not, are still men ­many ill-prepared for power-and free discussion in the Church of all issues, no matter what the oflicial attitudes of the day, keeps the leaders honest and mindfill of the concerns of their people and of truths that would otherwise be lost under the weight of their office. 
The truth is that if the Church has a duty to Notre Dame to teach and protect the faith, then even more so Notre Dame ha'i a duty to the Church to challenge and refme that faith. It is a hidden duty that may never be acknowledge by the hierarchy and which will be fimght and criticized again and again, but without which the Church would be lost in the modern world. The umbrella orthe Church has a tendency to narrow, and the hnarts of old truths pass away under the strain of politics. Notre Dame must keep the Church broad, and keep it constantly re-examining itself and rediscovering those truths. 
This is why we embrace dissent at the University, not as something to bn fearnd or rebuked or closeted in a darkened class­room, but as an equal partner in all ways in the beauty and splendor of teaehing, beeause today's dissents sometimes become the seeds to tomorrow's truths and bncause the lens of an oul'iider examining our hearts is also the mirror we usn to examine oursnlves. There can be no bur­den placed upon dissent, no hurdlPs that it must pa'is to bn heard by our community, beeausP we need dissent so very much that we can risk no harm to it. 
lt is part of the price that we all pay as seekers of truth, as we must walk edges and push boundaries, that we arn often misunderstood and hated and feared in our time. We continue to push, not because we hate or fear the Church or the truth, but because we must love and serve them in our way. For we -you and I and this University -ru:e more than trophies that the Church uses to brag about il'i intellec­tual strength. If the Church is the mirror of the face of God then we arfl the servants who keep that mirror bright and shining.

lETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

'Monologues' or dialogue: another perspective 
I would like to ponder a number of' issues relevant to tho rncent presidential address, "Academic Freedom and Catholic Charactnr." These are the topics of (1) doetrinal pluralism at a Catholic university, (2) the special status of various pnrforming and visual arts (staged plays, film, art shows and the like). Tho president of tho llnivnrsity also discussed (3) the Ed anulnmic frnedorn of students, but I Manier formulate a roasonable alternative to eurrnnt and prospnctivn policy in that Guest aroa. As a university community we Columnist must also give morn attention to (4) criteria for fair procmluros of dispute resolution and adjudication, as well as the accountability required if 1~xeeutivn power is not to be absolute. 
These issues will be split up into two parts. Today I will diseuss doctrinal pluralism and speda] status of various pnrforming and visual arts while continuing on Thursday with acadnmie frnedom of' students and criteria for fair procedurns of dispute resolution and adjudication. 
( 1) Pluralism. Notrn Dame has dearly become a place whnrn a full range of options on the most controversial topics can bn fully and fairly discussed. These topics rangn from athnism or "naturalism" to various creationist altnrnativns to evolution. as well as challenges to ortho­dox vinws of the place of women in the Church, the morality of war or the death penalty, and the morality of abortion, contraception, and homosexuality, to name just a few. At Notre Dame, the tinest scholars of Sacred Scripture can and have contested the views of leading philosoplwrs of rnligion. Neither doctrinal authority nor prnsidential wisdom and prudence has imposed litmus tests of orthodoxy as requirements limiting the range of inquiry or the array of viable conelusions presented for public debate. 
Although this circumstance is not fully understood or even recognized by many friends of Notre Dame, on or ofl" campus, it has been a: mainstay of the status quo here for nearly 40 years. 

The practices of an irreducible plurality of approaches to research, pedagogy and publication which have pre­vailed here for so long they are part of the air we breathe, are fully compatible with an array of student, faculty and administrative initiatives intended to "enhance the religious identity" of Notrn Dame in areas of scholarship as well as broad sections of student life. 
Everyone at Notre Dame should be aware of the essen­tial role played by Catholicism and Catholics at the core -the heart, blood and brain -ofthis University. Executive functions are reserved for priests of the order of the Holy Cross by our statutes. With this status comes the privilege of assigning very high priority to a full range of initiatives which deepen and broaden the influence of Catholicism on campus and in the world at large. This is surely a huge part of what it means for a university to be both Catholic and pluralistic. 
(2) Performing and visual arts. It should surprise no one that performing and visual arts are at the center of the current controversy on campus. Presentation of such work to a wide and public audience is as essential to the role of our departments of English and film, television and theatre as it is to our department of athletics. As we have seen over the last 10 years, the public performances of the University's most prominent athletic team are capable of stirring a perfect-and image-shattering ­storm of controversy. No one expects Notre Dame football to be played on Cartier field for the instruction of small groups of students of the game. 
Shakespeare's audiences included a broad spectrum of the citizens of London. The theatre did not thrive in the United Kingdom during and for a few years after the Puritan Revolution. Plays, films and the visual arts gener-
Uniting under common ground 
As we continue discussion about academic freedom and Notrn DamB's Catholic character, I urge people tore­read University President John Jenkins' speech. It dis­turbs mn that a ti~w pnople have oversimplified his stancn, purporting some breach of free speech. Jenkins dnlihnratPiy spnlled out how vital academic freedom is to our Catholic university. lin assured us that "faculty have t.hn ability to rnsnarch, create, teach and express them­snlvns in accord with their own best judgment, and that students have the oppotiunity to inquirn, express opin­ions, explon~ idnas and engage in discussion ... " lie went on f'urthnr to state that. "the University certainly can host individual spnakors who defimd atheism, or infitntidde, or nuthanasia or a first-strikn nudear attack. It is essen­tial to a univnrsity that there be a variety of views nxprnssnd vigorously, oven those contrary to deep values of Catholirism. We are richer, and the Catholic intellectual tradition is strnngthennd, if' a variety of views are nxpn~ssnd and discussed." This does not sound to me like a rostraint on frno speech, but a reasonable and nuanced und1~rstanding of the intelleetual playing field of' a ( :atholic university. 
llowever, any right or frnedom comes with a responsi­bility. Jenkins reeognizes that each fiteulty member has the right to fme spnech. Along with this right comes the obligation mentioned in the Academic Articles as the "avoidanen of using the University's name to advance one's personal opinion or interests." Studenlc;; also have th~n spom:h . .Jenkins poinl'i out that students "are free to hold their own opinions on issues trcat1~d in the class ... Oul<>ido the dassroom, studcnl<> are free to express their own views. while respecting the rules and procedures of the university." llowcver, freedom of speech docs not nwan complete reihrn over one's own education. 
Jenkins also has rights and responsibilities that come with his presidency. lie has a right to make all final deci­sions acmrding to his most informed judgment. He was not obligated to ind11de us in the discernment, but he gmwrously ollf1rnd us the fi1rum in whieh to do so. Ac;; a prof(~ssnd servant of the Church entrusted with the oper­ation of a Catholie university, he is also responsible for pmsnrving Notre Dame's Catholic integrity. 
Whiln individuals are free to pmscnt their own views on any issue, the University as an entity cannot be associat­ed, implidtly or explicitly, with any event that runs con­trary to the tnachings of the Church. 
Notre Dame is known and loved for her standards as an academic institution that also cultivates morality in Her students. Allowing the lewd "Vagina Monologues" and Queer Film Festival to continue under the shadow of Our Lady would mean forsaking that for which She stands. How much more vulgarity must She suffer before She loses all semblance of a Catholic institution? Pope Paul VI writes in llumanae Vitae as ifin direct response to "The Vagina Monologues," "Everything therefore in the modern means of socialeommunication which arouses men's baser passions and encourages low moral stan­dards, as well as every obscenity in the written word and every form of indecency on the stage and screen, should be condnmned publicly and unanimously by all those who have at heart the advance of civilization and the safe­guarding of the outstanding values of the human spirit." 
I would venture to say that just about everyone on earn­pus wants to end the violence against women. The issue is not whetl1er we should, but by what means we should. Jenkins suggests that "The Vagina Monologues" are an inappropriate means to achieve this goal due to its "graphic descriptions of homosexual, extra-marital het­erosexual and auto-erotic experiences" which run con­trary to Catholic sexual teaching. How does one mini­mize sexual violence by maximizing sexual lasciviousness in a play? 
What surprises me about the developments of the past week is that vocal parties have not united in an effort to find alternate fundraising routes for an end to violence against women, but have instead united to protect an abstract freedom ofspeech based on unfounded tangents. Let's refocus. I offer my time and help to mobilize, along­side peers of all dispositions, a campus-wide fundraising effort for an end to violence against women. There is no reason why we shouldn't work together as a university in this common goal in a way that truly reflects Her Catholic character. 
A blog has been created as a medium for online discus­sion that is readily available for the Notre Dame family at large: www.freedomnd.blogspot.com. Let's keep the con­versation going. 
Arina Grossu senior president ofNotre Dame Right to Life Jan. 30 
ally engage the full range of articulate human passion in a way that monographs of Galileo or Descartes, or evm1 those of Darwin and Frnud, do not. Both artistic and ath­letic presentations at academic institutions may, and often do, both instruct and ollcnd a mueh broader range of spectators than do conferences on academic freedom or abortion and public policy. 
As a result, the politically liberal prineiples of' the American Assoeiation of University Professors' statenwnt on academic freedom and artistic oxprnssion insist that "academic institutions arc obligml to ensurn that rngula­tions and procedures do not impair the freedom of' expression or discourage creativity by subjecting artistic work to tests of' propriety or ideology," and that "since faculty and student artistic presentations to the public are integral to their teaching, learning and scholarship, these presentations merit no less protection." 
At the root of these propositions is the eore insight that "essential as freedom is for the ... judgment of facts, it is even more indispensable to the imagination." 
Thn threat posed by artistic performance, whether on the stage or in tilm, is its unparalleled ability to stimulate empathic or abhorrent passion. 
A basic question we must continue to pose and try to answer is "Does our Catholic identity require doparturn from politically liberal principles, including those articu­lated by the AAUP? Should excGutive privilege on this campus include the authority to withhold, unilaterally, "sponsorship" of artistic presentations to the general public on the grounds that they arc oll'ensive to Catholic moral principles?"

Censorship hurts 
Ac;; part of an open dialogue, I wish to take issue with the recent repositioning and renaming of partieular evnnl<> on campus. Inevitably, these actions bring into question the cost of censorship. The University rolins on the generous donations of its alumni and f(~Jt pressure to appnasn them on certain ic;;suns, specifically past perf(mnanees of "Thn Vagina Monologues" and Queer Film Fnstival. Yet, I eannot help but wonder whether the University is eompromising it<> mission as an educational institution with it<> monetary goals. Although significant contributions may have bmm lost in the past due to the eontinund presence of tlwse events on campus, is that loss justified by ennsorship of academic and eampus culturalnvent<>? 
First, let us address the term censorship. Many havn mistaken the definition of censorship to simply nwan an erasure of material that is doemnd harmful, or in this easn contrary to Catholic values. Censorship, by dnlinition, is also characterized by the act of supervising eon duet and morals and persons of authority examining matnrials fin· objectionable matter. In a university setting, encouraging dialogue and questioning is indeed nssential, but we should meet the unguardnd alteration of material with eoncern~So far, the name of one event and the venue and purpose of another have been changed. The n~ality is that censorship has already occurred, making this dialogue not wholly preemptive, but after the fact. 
In addition, censorship poses a potential thrnat to the quality of proli1ssors from whom we learn. After reading a faeulty member's disconcerted remark at University President Father John Jenkins' "finely discriminated judg­ment of what is acceptable and what is not," it bneame my fear that perhaps Notre Dame would not be able to acquire or retain di<>tingui'ihed faeulty in thn futum, fur­ther jeopardizing the whole of our ndueation. A<> part of the dialogue, then, I would encourage others to think about the "priec" of our education. Arn thesn ehangns and censorship worth, say, one million dollars'? Five million'? Are they worth the possible long-tPrm penalties of driving away renowned faculty'! That is filr us, the student<> of Notre Dame, and future alumni and benefaetors, to decide.

MOVIE REVIEW 

Inaccurate portrayal sinks 'Annapolis' 
By SARAH VABULAS Scene Wrirer 

. When a person thinks of Annapolis, Md., he or she thinks of a beautiful harbor city that boasts the home of the United States Naval Academy, one of the toughest and most rigorous institutes of higher learning in this country. On any Friday or Saturday night, downtown Annapolis is filled with midshipmen enjoying liberty -free time away from "the yard." 
But in the newly released film "Annapolis," the Hollywood version of the city is not much like reality. The streets are tough and full of blue-collar workers who envy the midship­
Founder's Hall at Girard College, which substitutes for the Academy in the film, offers majesty with its Greek columns, it bears little resemblance to the grand structures occupied by generations of mid­shipmen. 
There are also many discrepancies of reality versus fiction in the daily life of a midshipman. The film is not an accurate portrayal of life at the Naval Academy. The trailer claims 50,000 people apply to the Academy each year -a fact that is grossly over exaggerated. 
Despite grossing $7.68 million dollars on its opening weekend, the movie falls well short of expectations. Starring Midshipman 4th Class Jake Huard {James

The State House -the oldest in the United States -never makes an appearance, nor does the chapel dome, which attracts more than one million visi­tors per year. Not to mention the chief industries in the real Annapolis are politics and tourism, not shipbuilding. And though as midshipmen. 
Huard quickly learns the life of a plebe is one of discipline and hard work. The movie includes scenes of hazing and racism -something which is not tolerated at the real Naval Academy. His command­ing officer, Midshipman Lieutenant Cole {Tyrese Gibson), sets out on a quest to ride Huard and push him to his limit -so much so that Huard contemplates quitting on numerous occasions.

He finds Cole's tests frustrating, but figures that if he does well enough in the Brigades, he can fight Colein the champi­onship-the climax of the movie. 
As a subplot, Huard falls for an upper­classman, Ali (Jordana Brewster), who also happens to be one of his superior offi­cers -something forbidden at the real and Hollywood Academy. Brewster's char­acter never fully develops throughout the movie and leaves the audience wondering how and why she knows enough about boxing to help Huard. 
The film is full of cliches and lacks depth in the overall plot. There are moments when the viewer is drawn into the movie, but it can be largely attributed to the soundtrack, which features strong instru­mentals by Brian Tyler. 
Other than offering a new, and not by any means better, version of the 1982 film "An Officer and a Gentleman" (starring Richard Gere), the film is missing sub­stance. The viewers keep waiting for the characters to develop and the plot to tie together, but this never happens.

SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL RECAP 
Sundance highlights independent films

The streets of Park City, Utah are slightly less crowded now that the Sundance Film Festival is over. Celebrities have headed home to Hollywood with Oscar on their minds and left behind a slew of award win­ners and box office potential.

The film prompted a Texas woman to donate $25,000 for one of the men to build a medical clinic in his town in Sudan. 
Directing awards went to James Longley for "Iraq in Fragments" and Dito Montiel for "A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints." "Iraq in Fragments," tells the stories of Iraqis strug­
Festival first began, paying a sum so large for a film was unprecedented. Robert Redford founded the Sundance Institute in 1981 to support the development of inde­pendent artists and movies. The festi­val soon followed to showcase the achievements of these artists and films and to promote creativity and risk tak­ing. Since 1981, independent films have gained popularity and commer­cial success, with bidding wars reach­ing higher and higher plateaus. 
While purists complain that the festi­val itself has become too commercial with its multiple sponsors and crazed celebrity fans, the focus remains on the films themselves. "Quinceafi.era" is about 14-year-old Magdelena {Emily Rios). who becomes pregnant and is kicked out of her house. She then makes a new family with her great-

Films premiering at Sundance includ­ed "Little Miss Sunshine," a movie star­ring Steve Carell and Greg Kinnear, which follows a family in a cross-coun­try road trip as they try to get their daughter in the finals of a beauty pag­eant, and "Wordplay," a documentary about crossword puzzle lovers. The New York Times puzzle editor Will Shortz. paid $1 million for "Wordplay," hoping it would become the "Mad Hot Ballroom" of 2006. 
Sundance is never without its myster-ies and scandals, like when Harvey Weinstein made a public scene when he lost the rights to "Shine" in 1996. This year, it was "Thank you for Smoking" that had festival-goers scratching their heads. A 12-second sex scene featuring Katie Holmes was mysteriously missing from the screen­ing. While some speculated that the culprit was a protective Tom Cruise, the real reason was due to a splicing error in Los Angeles. 


Most of the films showcased at Sundance will not be released until 
later in the year, but potential Oscar nominees are already among them. Last year's award winners included "Hustle & Flow," "The Squid and the Whale" and "Junebug." All three films have garnered Oscar nominations in acting or screenplay categories for the ceremony in March. It proves that independent film~ are gaining recogni­tion and box office results, and the Sundance Film Festival is just one step in making that possible for these films.

SCENE FEATURE 
Finding Hollywood's most elusive director 
By BRIAN DOXTADER A«isram Scene Editor 
Thoro aro those filmmakers who follow the ()uontin Tarantino track -little formal odtu:alion, minimal film school education and a filmmaking approeiation developed from drwphilia. On Uw opposite oxtrmnn of tlw spodrum is Terrence Malick -a guy who got his philosophy degreo from llarvard. hneamn a Hhodes Scholar, taught philosophy at MIT, wrote for Lifil, The New Yorkm· and Newsweek and then graduated from the American Film Institute's Center lilr Advanced Studios. 
Mali1:k's filmography is equally impres­sive, though oflnn puzzling. In a earner that spans fin1r decades, the writer/director has made only four films (loss than one film every ton years): "Badlands" (1973), "Days of llmtvon" (197Hl. 'The Thin Hod Line" (IIJIJH) and "The Now World" (2005). In partieular, Malick's first two films were such a potent one-two punch that it seemnd impossible that his subsequent pic­turns would farn as well. 
llo is also one of Hollywood's groat enig­mas, a dirnetor who rarely discusses his work and who disappoared from the public nyo at tho ap11x of his success. lie retrnated to Franco after JIJ7H's "Days of Heaven" and did not make a film for two decades. 
Malick is one of the few directors who can mnsidnr hirnsnlf an artist with a capital "A." lie writes and directs his own films, and his pnrsonality is stamped into every franw. In his review of "The Thin Hed Linn," critic Hoger Ebert points out that, "tho enntral intellignnce in tho lilrn doesn't belong to any of the characters, or even to their voice-over philosophies. It belongs to Mallek." Sueh is true of all his pictures, in which the narration seems more suited to the director's philosophieal wonderings than the characters who speak it. 
Budgetnd at less than half a million dol­lars, "Badlands" was an auspicious inaugu­ml picturn for Malick, ran king as one of the best writer/director debuts. Based loosely on the real-life Starkweather-Fugate mur­ders, it follows Kit (Martin Sheen) and Holly (Sissy Spacek), two young lovers on the run after Kit kills I lolly's father. A critical hit, "Badlands" established Malick's distinct style: voice-over narration, minimal plot­ting, sparse dialogue, breathtaking land­scapes and a self-conscious artiness. Some still consider "Badlands" to be Malick's finest film, though its reputation has been overshadowed by 1978's "Days of Heaven." 
Like its predecessor, "Days of Heaven" employs an elliptical narrative and voice­over narration, but it outstrips "Badlands" in cinematographic beauty and artsy poeti­cism. Less a movie than a visual elegy to a by-gone era, the film follows Bill (Hichard Gere), a factory worker who escapes to the farm fields of Texas after accidentally killing his boss. With his girlfriend Abby (Brooke Adams) and his sister linda (Linda Manz) in tow, he begins working on a plan­tation. When he discovers that the farmer who owns the fields (Sam Shepard) is ter­minally ill, Bill convinces Abby to marry him for the inheritance. 
If nothing else, "Days of Heaven" is mas­terpiece for the way in which it was filmed -mostly shot during "magic hour" in nat­ural lighting, the picture is absolutely gor-geous, easily one of the most beautiful films ever made. Though it forsook narrative convention and easy interpretation, its sta­tus as an artistically challenging illm has never been questioned. 

For many, "The Thin Hed Line" came dangerously close to dismantling the direc­tor's legacy. The near-perfection of his first two films and the ensuing long layover built expectations to unrealistic levels. Still, the film is remarkably unfocused, sprawl­ing over 170 minutes with little regard for plot cohesion. An ethereal meditation on the meaning of war, "The Thin Red Line" is interesting and challenging, but still some­thing of a letdown for casual fans. 
... 
The argument could be made that Malick's films are cold, indireet and detached. Nature seems more important to the director than charaders, whieh might be off-putting for some. His lilms are by no means popcorn entertainment, and their philosophical yearnings are more suited to art houses than cinemaplexes. Still, for those who haven never seen a Terrence Malick film, the maverick director's few pictures are well worth the time and nlli>rt. Few pictures are as meticulous and visually stunning as the liJUr films in his oeuvre.

Malick's latest a new world, familiar style 
By BRIAN DOXTADER A,sistanr Scene Editor 
Onen upon a time, Terrence Malick made "Badlands" (1973) and "Days of Heaven" (197H), setting an impossibly high bar for tho his subsnqunnt works. 
Perhaps rnalizing that following his pair of dnbut lihns would be a diflicult task, the mavnriek dimdor took a 20-year sabbati­cal, which he finally broke with 199H's "The Thin Hed Line," a sometimes brilliant, more ol'len frustrating, treatise on the meaning of war. lie returns seven years later, with "The New World," a lilm that continues his penehant for excess but also reminds viewers

The film is a reconstruction of the decon­structed Pocahontas legend, providing a slick new gloss of mythos to the classic story. Obviously not as saccharinely senti­mental as other translations (Disney's 1995 film version being foremost), "The New World" still brings a gracefully storied edge to the proceedings, mostly thanks to the vision of its director.

against "The New World" is that, at 135 minutes, it is too long. The film is a 20-minute story stretehnd out over two hours. Malick's ftrst two films each ran 95 minutes, an appro­priate length for his artsy mixture of ellipti­cal narrative and naturalistic tableaux.

"The New World" has the surest narra­tive footing of any Malick film since 1973' "Badlands," but that really isn't saying much.

Malick has always been a visionary who finds a detached beauty in strange things, whether it be the mundane lives of poor farmers, the inanity of young lovers on the run or the brutality of war. Here, he fmds a sweeping grace not only in the photogenic landscape of America, but also in a won­derfully recreated London.

Like that 1978 master­piece, it combines breathtaking visuals and an un-cloying naivete that often transcends criticism. Still, the illm is overlong and suf­fers through passages that wear even the most tested of cinematic patience thin.

nature, and "The New World" is no excep­tion. Neither the colonists nor the Native Americans are presented as wholly good or wholly bad, which complicates the direc­tor's moral stance. Smith and Rolfe are good men, and Captain Newport and Chief Powhatan are competent leaders. 
It's easy to get the impression that Malick has made the exact film he wanted to make, but that doesn't necessarily bode well for the viewer. Self-indulgent to a fault, "The New World" is saved from collapsing under its own weight -like "The Thin Red

Unrecognized 1958 classic finally gets its due 
'Squid' brings new twists to old story 
Photo courtesy of movieweb.com A complex story of divorce and its effects on a family, Noah Baumbach's "The Squid and the Whale" was one of the most impressive new films of 2005. 
By LIZ BYRUM Assistant Scene Editor 

Tales of divorce and its effects on a family have been told and retold in Hollywood. However, in "The Squid and the Whale," writer-director Noah Baumbach uses a model of his own childhood to put a new spin on an old story. 
Baumbach, who has worked on films including "Kicking and Screaming" and "Mr. Jealousy," sets the film in Brooklyn's Park Slope, where he lived for a large part of the '80s. At that time, his own parents, film critic Georgia Brown and novelist Jonathan Baumbach, went through a messy divorce. 
Using his history as a starting point, Baumbach creates a story about the marriage and divorce of writer and Professor Bernard (Jeff Daniels) and 
aspiring writer The Squid and the Whale Joan begins to

more about him­self and his writ­ing than he does about his wife or fam­ily. Even larger issues erupt when he finds out that Joan has had an excerpt from her new novel published in The New Yorker. 
Daniels shines in this picture and becomes the character for which audi­ence members might feel sorry, or by which they might just be disgusted. Linney's character, on the other hand, breaks past the fact that she has been having affairs through the last four years of her marriage and appears to have a calm and innocence about her that her sons finally begin to recognize toward the end of the film. 
Despite the talent of these actors and the complexity behind their roles, the focus of "The Squid and the Whale" revolves around the characters' two children, Walt (Jesse Eisenberg) and his younger brother Frank (Owen Kline, son of actor Kevin Kline). 
The film is a portrait of the effects parents have on their children, and the way children begin to realize how they can take the information their parents feed them -through conversations ranging from Dickens to desire -and decide for themselves what parts will benefit them in the future.

Best described as a classic psychologi­cal thriller, "Cairo Station" examines the lives of the poverty-stricken workers in Cairo's main railroad station in 1958. Although underappreciated upon its release, also in 1958, "Cairo Station" has proven to be the beautiful preeminent classic of the Egyptian screen, receiving much international attention and esteem. 
This film brilliantly and concisely encompasses all of Egyptian society in the world of this railway station. The entire nation is pulled together through the dis­carded timetables and black-and-white newspaper print littering the station's floor, while time is told only through the station's central clock. "Cairo Station" highlights Egypt's

Kinawi is the most marginalized char­acter of the movie, forced to deal with his poverty and his physical handicap, but he proves to be physiologically inept at deal­ing with his disadvantages.

Hanuma's best friend mistakenly walks into Kinawi's trap and is stabbed. Although shocked by his actions, he continues the pursuit of Hanuma. In a passionate and violent fmal scene, Hanuma is saved by Abu Sir' and the head newspaper salesman and Kinawi is taken to an asylum. 
The film's greatest strength is the stark contrast between the impermanency of Kinawi's world with his universal feelings of sexual desire, repression, passion and madness. Chahine embraces the black­and-white world, using light, shadows and sunlight to unite faces and the bleak scenery, while grease and diesel steam mark out the film's backgrounds, remind­ing viewers of film noir.

romantic love and the realization that although his father may be an intellec­tual, not all the advice he gives Walt is worth taking. Although the objects of distraction may vary, Baumbach's story of Walt's discoveries and realizations still take on a relatable feel. 
One of the comical parts of the film occurs when Walt attempts to have an intelligent conversation about Franz Kafka with his new girlfriend (Halley Peiffer). Trying to emulate his father's knowledge of literature, he describes Kafka's "The Metamorphosis" as being "Kafkaesque," to which the teenage girl replies, "It's written by Franz Kafka. It has to be." 
Although it's hard to put a finger on exactly what makes this movie a good one, it's worth trying to figure out. 
A successful cast, interesting setting and a complex storyline are just a few of the possibilities of what makes "The Squid and the Whale" a winner.

Coaches present contrast in style, philosophy 
Holmgren, Cowher ready to lead teams to Super Bowl win 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -It's an 8-year-old snapshot of Bill Cowher that endures: the Pittsburgh coach brandishing a fist at Jacksonville's Chris Hudson as he races past the Steelers bench en route to a game-clinching touch­down. 
"Intense" is the word it con­jures -a word most often used to describe Cowher. It might have been more: as he clenched that fist, Cowher looked like he might jump on the field and tackle Hudson. 
It's easy to depict Seattle coach Mike Hohngren as just the oppo­site: a laid-back Californian who has been fashioning precision offenses for more than two decades. 
Not really. Holmgren just shows his intensity a little farther from the cameras. 
"He says to me, 'I don't want you to turn over the ball," Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck said. "Then I'll throw an interception -it happens, doesn't it? -and come off the field and he'll say, 'I don't want you to turn over the ball."'

They are the longest-tenured coaches in the NFL -14th sea­sons without a break. The 48­year-old Cowher was hired in by the Steelers in 1992, the same year Holmgren signed on in Green Bay. 
After winning a Super Bowl with the Packers after the 1996 season and losing one the next year, Holmgren moved on to Seattle as coach and general manager.

Touted recruit Mustain to sign with Arkansas 
QB's signing ends months ofstress after earlier decommitment 
Associated Press 

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -The hoopla has died down a bit. The state can breathe easy. Mitch Mustain decided to stay home for school. 
Mustain, one of the nation's top high school quarterbacks, plans to attend Arkansas. Now, of course, comes the August, then said in early December he was considering other schools. 
Finally, two weeks ago, Mustain announced he would play for Houston Nutt at Arkansas, choosing the Razorbacks over Notre Dame, Tennessee and Alabama. 
Mustain's decision could hardly have come at a better time for Nutt. Arkansas went 4­7 in 2005, missing the postsea­son for the second straight year after going to a bowl each of 
Nutt's first six 
seasons.

Arkansas recruit
"They're going to expect a lot out of me," Mustain said this week. "At the same time, they've got to realize, it's a new game for me too." 
Mustain is expected to sign with Arkansas on Wednesday, the first day -and by far the busiest -of the national sign­ing period. 
When Mustain makes it offi­cial, it will formally end a recruiting saga that has capti­vated the region for months. Mustain played high school football at Springdale, about 20 minutes from Arkansas' cam­pus in Fayetteville. He initially committed to the Razorbacks in intent. But there's 
no denying the 
Arkansas coach is excited about his class. 
"To have the No. 1 player come out of your own state, you really need him," Nutt said. "You really need him to go to your school -and so that was huge." 
Mustain is actually ranked No. 3 among overall recruits by College Sports Television recruiting expert Tom Lemming and No. 10 by Rivals.com. But that's of little consequence to Arkansas fans, many of whom have seen first hand what Mustain can do. 
Springdale had one of the 
most dominant seasons in state history in 2005, going 14-0 and outscoring its opponents 664­118. 
Mustain, who was already earning national attention before the season began, lived up to the hype. He completed a state-record 70.4 percent of his passes in 2005, throwing for 3,817 yards and 47 touch­downs. Mustain won the Gatorade national player of the year award and Parade Magazine player of the year. 
Less than a week after Springdale won the state title, reports surfaced that Mustain might be reconsidering his commitment -and the pres­sure on Nutt and the Razorbacks increased again. 
Rick Schaeffer was Arkansas' sports information director for more than two decades and now is a color analyst on bas­ketball broadcasts. He also co­hosts a sports talk radio show. 
Schaeffer defended Nutt's performance in recent years, but he understands fans have been growing impatient. 
"Houston's a good recruiter, but the question comes up: 'Well if he can't sign the quar­terback from 15 minutes from his school, who can he sign?'" said Schaeffer, who has also announced Springdale games. 
Mustain's recruitment was even more important because Arkansas averaged only 143.7 yards passing per game last season, never finding a clear cut No. 1 quarterback to go with dynamic freshman run­ning back Darren McFadden. 

Around the time Mustain reopened his recruitment, Nutt was making staff changes. For the first time, he hired an offensive coordinator. The choice: Gus Malzahn, Mustain's coach at Springdale. 
Malzahn had made no secret of his desire to move to the col­lege level -and Arkansas seemed a natural fit well before Mustain reconsidered his com­mitment. Malzahn's hiring did­n't immediately secure Mustain. 
In mid-January, Mustain finally recommitted to Arkansas.

Associated Press 

OKLAHOMA CITY ­The Hornets will play most of their home games in Oklahoma City next season with New Orleans still recovering from Hurricane Katrina. 
The NBA announced Tuesday that the llornets will play 35 games in Oklahoma City and six in New Orleans in 200(>-07. 
NBA commissioner David Stern said in a statement the league remains committed to returning to New Orleans, but "for.now, our collec­tive interests are best served by having the tP.am play the bulk of its 2006­07 schedule in Oklahoma City. 
"However, we are hope­ful that the team will be in a position to return to New Orleans full time beginning in the 2007-08 season." 
The agreement reached between the state of Louisiana and the Hornets allows the team to amend its lease agreement with the New Orleans Arena. 
"The agreemP.nt reached today will ensure the llornets stability while thP. New Orleans market fully recovers and, at the 
same time, maintains our presence in the NBA," Louisiana Gov. Kath teen Blanco said. 
Stern also said the NBA will enter exelusive nego­tiations to bring the 2008 All-Star Game to New Orleans. 
"From everything we have seen and heard, we have little doubt that New Orleans will soon regain its place among the world's premiere dties for hosting major sporting events," Stern said. 
The NBA has also agreed to hold its annual marketing moetjngs in New Orleans in October, 
IN BRIEF 

Pimlico quarantine will not 
effect Preakness 
BAJ:riMOHE -The home of the l'rnakness is enrily quiet this week, the result of a quarantine that has raisP.d questions whether troubled Pimlieo Hace Course can regroup in time to host the middle jnwP.I of the Triple Crown. 
An outbreak of equine herpesvirus at the 136-year-o~d track forced three horses to be nuthanized and led sP.veral states to ban the ship­ment of horses into or from Maryland. Although a horse was linknd to tlw virus Tuesday at near­by Laurel Park, there have been no new cases at Pimlico since Jan. liJ and thn track intends to lif't the snlf­imposed quarantine next Wednesday. 
But can Pimlico ultimately replace the cautionary ynllow tape currently surrounding several barns with the bright yellow Black-nyed Susans that symbolize the Preakness? 
"I have no concern about that 
whatsoever," Lou Haffetto, ehief operating ofl'icer of the Maryland .Jockey Club, said Tuesday. "Given the nature of this virus, I don't think this will bP. an issue by the time we start the spring meet in A!:!ril."

Carter 
continued from page 28 

Villanova in the unfortunate position of either having to foul him or simply watch the junior work down the stretch. 
"That's always bnen a big part of my game, going to the bas­ket," Carter said following the game. 
The Irish average nearly 24 3­point attempts per outing. But when Carter is on, opponents almost have to tear up the scout­ing report to deal with the new _scoring option. 
"I want him to keep doing what he's doing, because he gives us that slashing guy to the basket that's different than the other perimeter guys we have," Notre Dame coach Mike Brey said Monday. 
The problem has been Carter's consistency, or the lack of it. 
Though he's averaging 9.2 points and 4.4 n~bounds pnr game as the Irish head into Morgantown, W. Va. tonight, Carter has battled to earn his coach os' trust. 
On Saturday, during a second­half stretch in which the Irish had momentum, the junior guard caught the first pass of the possession from point guard Chris Quinn and fired a deep 3­pointor that rimmed out. 
The Irish walked to the bench as a timeout was called, and Brey could be se<m telling Carter, "Not so early," suggesting the shot selection was unwise. 
"We certainly want him to drive, but he doesn't have to drive on the first pass," Brey said. "Uon 't force plays. Just let plays come to you." 
Carter did, for the most part, against Villanova. He finished with 14 points, grabbed six rebounds and -perhaps most importantly-made 8-of-11 free throws. It was the most free throws attempted by a Notre Dame guard in a single game this season, second only to Torin Francis (12 attempts against Providence, Jan. 14) on the entire team. 
"He went through a tough week ]during] the Providence/Marquette week," Brey said, referring to Carter's five total minutes in the 1-1 stretch. "I thought he was proba­bly forcing some plays and maybe not focusing on the things that he does well for us. [The key is I staying to his strengths and away from his weaknesses." 
Carter also understands that oppommts sometimes dictate the lineup Notre Dame shows. Against an athletic, guard-heavy team like Villanova, for example, Carter would most likely see increased playing time. The jun­ior started. however-and Brey also left him in the game ­because he had shown 11ash!~s of offnnsive foren in tho previous 85-82, double-overtime loss to Villanova. 
"In certain games, you may need certain players," Carter said. "Everyone on the team understands that." 
But if he continues to get to the free throw line and remains patient on offense, Carter may also force the issue on the per­manent makeup of Notre Dame's starting lineup.

Kessler wins MIAA honor 
Guard is first Belle to be named Player of the Week in 05-06 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 
Allison Kessler's hard work for the Belles has paid off as the sophomore shooting guard was named the MIAA Player of the Week Monday. 
"I was happy and excited when I found out I had won t h i s  " Kessler said. "But I'm !more glad I that someone from our school finally won it." 
Kessler played a crucial role in Saint Mary's victories last week over Alma (57-55) and Tri-State (58-57}. She took control or both games, playing 77 minutes out or a possible 80 and shooting 11­for-24 for 32 points. 
Kessler showed the ability to make clutch shots toward the end or games last week. With less than a minute to go in the home win over Alma, Kessler nailed an off-balance 

shot to give the Belles a three-point lead, and cement the 57-55 win. Likewise, against Tri-State Kessler scored the Belles' final six points, denying a 13-point second-half comeback by the Thunder. 
Despite receiving the con­ference award this week, Kessler believes hnr and the Belles' best el'l'ort eame against Kalamazoo on Jan. 14.

In the past four games, the Belles' defense has allowed only 53.8 points per game, an improvement from early this season when the Belles gave up 65 points or more six times in their first 11 games. 
The results on the defen­sive end coincide with head coach Steve Bender's theme for this season -mental toughness. And Knssler has taken the motto to heart. 
Over the past five games, she has averaged 17.2 points and 36 minutes. Kessler has also spearhead­ed the Belles'

the past week, Notre Dame rebounded behind the strong play of a veteran and a rookie. 
Senior forward Courtney LaVere started for the Irish and scored 14 points on 7-of-10 shooting. 
Freshman guard Lindsay Schrader was even more prolif­ic, hitting 9-of-19 from the floor and 6-of-10 from the free throw line for 24 points. 
"She was really aggressive offensively," McGraw said of Schrader. "I thought she did a really good job just looking for her shot and being able to score." 
Schrader added eight rebounds and two steals in the winning effort. 
The Irish outscored the Orange 19-7 in the game's tina! 
9:30 to make an otherwise close contest look like a blowout. Schrader scored eight of Notre Dame's final 19 points during the run, and she helped Notre Dame control the ball with a bevy of offensive and defensive rebounds during that time. 
·The teams battled on the perimeter and in the paint all game, and Syracuse outre­bounded Notre Dame, 40-35. 
"I was a little disappointed in our rebounding," McGraw said. "[Junior forward) Crystal [Erwin]_ had eight rebounds but she could have had a little more. Overall that whole back line could have played better on the rebounding end." 
Notre Dame was successful enough, however, to pull away at the end. 
Associate head coach Coquese Washington said the Irish defense, especially in the sec­ond half, was the key to the vic­tory. 
"We tried to mix up our defenses" to neutralize Syracuse guard Jenny Eckhart, Washington said in a radio interview. "We were able to keep her oil' balance." 
Lavere was a large part of that strong defensive perform­ance. On the heels of a six-point performance against South Florida Saturday, she had !'our rebounds to go along with her 14 points, and she added three blocks in 27 minutes of action. 
In a radio interview after the game, LaVere called the game one of her best of the season. 
''I'd do anything to make the team win," she said. "Right now, I just want to end the Big East [season) on a high note." 
McGraw said it was crucial for LaVere to play well to prove to other teams that the Irish can score, even when standout point guard Megan Duffy is held in check. 
"It's really important [for other players to score I because every team is focusing on Megan," McGraw said. "Courtney finally stepped up to give us more confidence that we don't need Megan to score to win." 
Both teams had trouble from the floor early in the game, and neither Syracuse nor Notre Dame was able to capitalize on the other's mistakes. Each squad led by four at one point in the first half, but neither could extend the lead any fur­ther than that. 
In all, there were eight ties in the first 20 minutes, and only two free throws by Tracy llarbut with nine seconds left in the period gave Syracuse a 27­25 lead at tho half.
