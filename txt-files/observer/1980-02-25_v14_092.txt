Massive bar raid ruts patrons' evening short 
by john M. McGrath 
Senior StaffReporter 

Goose's Nest bar, 1003 Notre Dame Ave., was the target of a massive police raid at approximately 11:45 p.m. Saturday night. South Bend Police, including plainclothes vice squad members and In­diana State Excise officers were involved in_ the raid, termed by some observers at the scene as the largest in recent years. 
South Bend Police confirmed yesterday that nobody was ar­rested in the incident, however. 
!'he "word" had been out anoss the Notre Dame--St. Mary's campuses late last week that local bars would be "safe" Friday and Saturday nights because of the presence of visitors for .J un10r Parents' Weekend. Liquor Control Au­thorities had other ideas, how­ever, and the timing of the raid fuund a standing room only crowd of underage patrons i11s1de the Goose's Nest. 
A vice squad officer at the scene who refused to be identi­tied, said at least 189 people under the age of 21 were .. rrapped" in the establishment at the time of the lightning qu1ck raid. 
PDiice worked by a process of elimination, allowing only those with 21 identification to leave the establishment through heavily guarded exits. Finally, only the minors remained in­side. 
Fm a tense half hour, it was unclear whether there would be mass arrests, especially after the arrival of a police van at the scene. Apparently the sheer weigh' of numbers fmally forced police to abandon that idea, however. 
··It would be unfeasible and probably even unfair to try to arrest this many people," orie vice squad member said. "So we've decided not to take 
anyone." 
The same vice squad officer 
indicated at the scene, how­
ever, that 30-35 minors had 
been identified and cited for 
violation of underage drinking 
laws and would face court 
appearances. 
No names· were released. He 
also indicated that the Goose's 
Nest would be cited for selling 
alcoholic beverages to minors. 
It was an eerie scene outside 
the bar as a large crowd 
gathered. Many worried stu­
dents who had been released 
after showing proof of age or 
who had escaped being trapped 
swod outside wondering about 
the fate of friends still inside. 
·'I have a roommate and a 
couple of good friends in 
there," one worried Notre 
Dame student said as he stood 
in the cold evening air. 
·'I had just gone out for a 
breath of'air,'' another student 
said. "and when I got back, the 
(police) had the doors blocked. 
A couple of my friends are still 
in there." 
The crowd outside, at one point estimated at between 150-200 people, at times be­came restless, shouting catcalls at police, then chanting: "We don't need no regulation/ No more raids at Corby's "or Goose's--Hey coppers leave us kids alone'' to the rhythm of the title cut of Pink Floyd's album, 
The Wall. 
At one point, there was some talk among members of the mob, suggesting that the crowd rush police lines if students 
were taken away in an attempt to free them. 
It was perhaps because of this that authorities amassed a large array of equipment at the scene. Groups offolice blocked the doorways o the bar as

Registrar proposes n.oon_ hour classes 
by Clare Padgett 

Noon hour classes may be the answer to overcrowded dining halls at lunchtime, according to Registrar Richard Sullivan. "We already have a noontime slot in the schedule, which has been primarily for TA's seminar classes,'' Sullivan said. By scheduling classes at this time beginning in Fall 1980, "we can utilize this time slot to its fullest,'' he added. 
The only possible alternative to this proposal would be an extension of dining hall hours. The value of such a proposal, which would have the dining halls remain open from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m., is questionable, according to Fr. ;ohn VanWolvear. "Even i the hours were 10 to 3, the dining hall would still be crowded at noon, when classes let out," he said.

Fire ravages local Ramada Inn 
by Toni J!tanstoos 

A three-alarm fire ripped through the Ramada Inn on Route 31 North yesterday morning, according to the Ramada's catering manager, leaving "just the motel standing." All the banquet rooms, dining areas, kitchen, and the lobby were destroyed. The fire started around 11 a.m. and although it was considered under control at 1 p.m., there were firemen still at the sire until late evening. The fire originated in the kitchen, and according to Fire Chief Lindzy the cause was a defective deep fat fryer which ignited the grease. A fire of this type could have been easily contained, yet the motel's automatic fire extinguisher over the cooking hood also malfunctioned. Thus the grease fire was allowed to spread. Lindzy. could give no reason for the non-working extinguisher. "Safety 
procedures require them to be checked every SIX months, and the Ramada Inn's extinguisher was approved last November," he said. 
However, another crippling factor in fi~hting the fire was the motel's non-functioning sprinkler system. The management was aware of this and the system was in the process of being corrected. Consequently, it was discon­nected when the blaze broke out. Lindzy emphasized the seriousness of such a malfunct­ion. A sprinkler system is our main method of containing a fire and extinguishing it quickly," he stated. 
The motel had to be totally evacuated, forcing other area motels to accomodate the Ramada's guests. One woman was overcome by smoke inhalation and was treated at the scene_ There were on other injuries. 
The night clerk at Ramada said the motel will be closed for just Sunday night. Any reservations will be .accomodated after Sunday, however , just for sleeping purposes for awhile since the resturant was damaged so extensively. 
The manager was /leased at how well the evacuation proceede . "We have 157 rooms with two or three people to a room all occupied at the time the fire started and no one was really hurt," she said. Whe asked about the extent of the damage in terms of dollars, she replied, "We can't tell now; we're still digging out and trying to clean up the water.'' 
the students most affected by the installation of noon-hour classes. These will be worked into the students' progams by Freshman Year of Studies, which schedules all freshmen classes. Some upperclassmen will attend the 12 o'clock class­es, but not to the extent of the freshmen. 
Lone advantage to the noon­hour classes is that students may finish classes earlier in the day by utilizing the additional time slot in which to schedule classes. Also, classrooms once empty during the noon-hour time slot can be used by classes which were crowded into smaller rooms earlier or later in the day because no other rooms were available. 
The dining hall hours would be extended to accomodate the students who wish to eat lunch before or after their noon-hour class. ''The campus tradition of eating lunch at noon'', said Sullivan, "exists only because that is when the dining hall is open. With longer dining hall hours, the option of eating earlier or later will be available to the students.'' 

Republicans denounce Bush after debate 
CONCORD N.H. (AP) -After a debate that almost didn't happen, the Republicans who weren't allowed to take part spent the last hours before the New Hampshire primary de­nouncing George Bush. 
Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, one of the seven Republicans on Tuesday's ballot, fueled the controversy yesterday, declar­ing that Bush "treated us like dirt under his feet. ' ' 
Sen. Howard Baker of Tennessee called it the "the rawest political act I've ever seen... exclusionary politics .. . bad judgement ... inexcusable .. . a lockout." 
"He was the heavy," Baker said on NBC's "Meet the Press." 
And Rep. John Anderson of Illinois, one of the frustrated four, said Bush "shot himself in the leg." 
Ronald Reagan, who finally got the face-to-face debate with Bush that he asked and paid for, called the event "kind of a fiasco." 
The Saturday night debate, before a restive, prone-to-boo crowd of 2, 500 persons in the Nashua High School gymna­sium, was enlivened at the start when the four uninvited debaters Dole, Baker, Anderson and Rep. Philip Crane of Illinois -showed up. 
They stood awkwardly behind Reagan, Bush and the moder­ator while Reagan tried to explain to the crowd why he had changed his mind about a two-man debate and had invit­ed the other candidates. 
''Only the Nashua Telegraph is the sponsor of this event,'' said Jon Breen, executive edit­or of the paper and moderator of the debate. When Reagan insisted on speaking, Breen ordered the microphone cut off, and the crowded booed. 
"I am paying for this micro­phone," said Reagan, referring to his campaign organization's payment of $3,500 to under~ write the debate. At this, the cheers of,Reagan's supporters rattled the gym rafters .. 
The debate, sponsored by Nashua Telegraph, had been planned as a two-man event but a few hours before it was to start, Reagan invited the other canidates to take part. of the seven, only former Gov. John Connally ofTexas was unable to

O'Shag lounge 
AL-CAP discusses idea 
By Kelli Flint StaffReporter 

Adding a faculty-student lounge on the third floor of O'Shaughnessy was one of the ideas proposed at a discussion last Thursday sponsored by the Arts and Letters Committee in Academic Progress (AL-CAP). 
According to Tom Jemielity, chairman of the committee, the AL-CAP is an extension of the Dean's office. "The AL-CAP is a vehicle for encouraging and supporting students interested in furthering the intellectual life of college ways that couldn't be handled by any one depart­ment," Jemielity said. "We're more c~~legewide than depart­mental. 
About rwelve students attend­ed the discussion, which was held in O'Shaughnessy Hall. "We expected 20, but there were other required discussions at the same time as ours: . 
according to Terry Keeley, chairman of the Student Co­ordinating Committee of the CAP. 
Students who attended the meeting critiqued and altered the ideas presented by the committee at the meeting. ''A nucleus of about 22 students worked on the ideas presented at the meeting, "Keeley said. ''Through these and other sug­gested changes, we hope to reorganize the AL-CAP.'' 
Keeley will meet with the Dean of the College of Arts and Letters on Thursday to request a faculty-student lounge in O'Shaughnessy. The proposed lounge would be open from 3:30-5 p.m. during the week. 
"We feel that the lounge is 

needed as a place for counsel­
ling and discussion,'' Keeley 
said. "It would be a place for 
students and teachers to gather 
to discuss issues and have 
coffee. Students need a place 
other than the hallways to talk 
to their professors." 
The institution of a new AL­CAP course was also proposed at the meeting. "The course would be similar to the directed reading course now existant, except with group instead of individual projects,'' Keeley said. 
Publication of a new journal 
was another idea discussed at 
the meeting. "The journal · 
would include topics of stu­
dents' own interestS," Keeley said. "Itwould be connected to 
the AL-CAP course in that writings by students in the course would be published.'' 

The journal would feature such topics as literary criticism, poe­try, politics, and philosophy. 
''There are many blockades ahead for the journal, Keeley said. ''We face major problems 

infunding and circulation. Our commtttee is investigating jour­nals established by other uni­
versities to gather ideas for format.'' ''The meeting was very use­

ful, although there was a small turnout,'' according to Mary Hayes, a senior in the AL-CAP. 
''The people who were able to attend the meeting were inter­ested in revitalizing the AL­

CAP and the Arts and Letters College.''

ND Provost O'Meara conunents on Placetnent Bureau problems 
by Betsie Boland 

"It is ridiculous that Notre Dame students should have to spend the night in the Admin­istration Building in order to get interviews with potential employers,'' Notre Dame Pro­vost Timothy O'Meara said. Lines of students waiting to sign up for interviews have been forming late Sunday nights outside the Placement Bureau office, with up to 100 or I)0 students waiting when the office opens Monday morning. According to O'Meara, the tirst come-first served interview policy is the most equitable to the students, but the system cannot adequately handle the demand. The potential employ­ers dictate the number of 
interviewsavailable by the num­
ber of representatives they 
send. 
·'The enterprising students 
are forced to spend the night, or 
get up very early, in order to 
guarantee an interview with the 
most desirable companies. It's 
not our fault, but this situation 
shouldn't even have to happen 
to Notre Dame students,'' 
0' Meara said. 
fhe greatest pressure for 
these interviews seems to be 
among Arts and Letters majors. 
''The top business executives 
say they are looking for stu­
dents majoring in the human­
ities, but people in the field 
hiring look for people already 
trained. There is a gap in 
communication from the top to 
the field," O'Meara said. 
Although liberal arts students 
are more adaptable their mar­
ker is limited because of this 
selectivity by those hiring, 0'­
Meara stated. "That's why the 
problem is so difficult-it is not 
internal, not under our con­
trol,' ' he added. 
According to Richard Wille­
min, director of the Placement 
Bureau, over 500 potential em­
ployers will come to campus 
Soviet troops block access to bridges in Afghanistan 
NEW DELHI; India (AP) ­Soviet troops have blocked ac­cess to bridges over the river through Kabul, splittin~ the Afghan capital in rwo 10 an apparent attempt to protect the Soviet Embassy and a Russian housing area after three days of street violence, reports from Kabul said yesterday. 
In Bono, West Germany, a 
magazine said Prestdent Carter 
asked former Chancellor Willy 
Brandt on Feb. 15 to act as a 
mediator between the Soviet 
Union and the West in the 
Afghan crisis. 
There was no immediate 
comment on the report in Der 
Spiegel from either Brandt or 
U.S. officials. But a spokesman for Brandt's 
Social Democratic Party, which the Nobel Peace Prize winner still heads, said the report contained material that was "more speculative than helpful 
or useful. " 
Afghan sources here said 
Vice President Sultan Ali Kish­
tmano, earlier reported wound­
ed in a Kabul shooting incident 
Feb. 7, died following unsuc­
cessful medical treatment in 
Moscow. The dllte of his death 
was not known. 
Afghanistan's Marxist gov­ernment has not confirmed the death of Kishtmaod, consider­ed a strong backer of President Babrak Karma!. But govern­ment-run newspapers earlier reported Kistmand, an econo­mist-turned-politician, had gone to the Soviet Union for an undisclosed medical problem. 

The apparent aim in blocking access to bridges across the Kabul River was to increase security around the Soviet Embassy, the modern housing complex where many Russians live, the strategic BaJa Hissar

Republicans to sponsor Mock Forums 
The Notre Dame Mock Repub­lican Convention will sponsor two Presidential Forums for all interested students. The first 
one will be tomorrow in Carroll Hall at Saint Mary's. The second will be on Thursday in the Notre Dame Library 'Audi­torium. The starting time will be 7 pm at both locations. State chairmen and delegates are urged to attend. · 
this year. Limited representa­tives and a ceiling of rwelve students per interviewer per day restricts available spots and greatly reduces the students' chance of interviewing with the first-choice companies. 
"We want to offer interviews to the greatest number of students possible ... and the best way we have found is with the present sign-up limit of rwo employers per student on Mon­day, and subject to availability, sign up the rest of the week,'' Willemin said. 
Willemio does not foresee any major changes of policy be­cause of the equitability of the present system and the relative success Notre Dame's bureau. 
''What  we  provide  for  the  
students  is  an  on  campus  
employment  agency-we  save  

them time and energy in the long run,'' he said: The students waiting in line recog­nize the fairness of the system, and do not complain about it because they are "hungry e­nough and enterprising enough to go to this length to get a job," Willemin claimed. 
A .Priority sys.tem as a.~ alter­native would mvolve moun­tains ofpaperwork'', according to Willemin, and although a lottery would eliminate the lines, it would hardly be fair. "We feel the system is ade­quate, and I do not see how it could be changed and still be as fair,'' he said. ­
Saint Mary's has a fraction of graduates that Notre Dame does-450 as compared to ap­proximately 2000-and, therefore is not faced with a similar crush for jobs. "Even students who dislike the system agree that it's fair", Willemin said. 
0'Meara, however, hopes that a viable, workable alternative can be implemented for the next school year. "We' II discuss it with our department heads and the trustees. I don't have a solution right now, but our students should not be subjected to this in order to gain interviews with the highly desirable firms,'' he said.

In Tehran 

UN Com.m.ission m.eets Bani-Sadr 
(AP) -Members of the U.N. 
Commission in Tehran to inves­
tigate the opposed shah's 
regime met yesterday with 
Iranian President Abol Hassam 
Bani-Sadr in talks described as 
''extremely constructive,'' but 
several high-level Iranian offic­
ials insisted the panel's work 
was not tied to the release of 
the American hostages. 
The meeting concerned the commission's operating pro­cedure, including possible tFst­imony by the hostages. Hassan Hariat, spokesman for the rul­ing Revolutionary Council, said the panel might call as ''wit­nesses" some of the approxi­mately )0 Americans who yes­terday spent their 113th day in captivity at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Hariri did not elabor­ate and a commission spokes­man said the details had not been settled. 
Mansour Earhand, Iran's Ambassador to the United Nation's, said in a broadcast interview in New York, "there was no linkage between the formation of the commission and release of the hostages, if by linkage you mean a deal. Ayatollay(Ruhollah) Khomeini, who has the ultimate authority over the crisis, does not make deals.'' 
Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nasir U-Sadat Salami, told a Tehran news conference that the five com­mission members were "to investigate the shah's crimes, not to see the hostages. The rwo issues are not related at all. We emphasize that they are separate." 
Khomeini on Saturday dis­couraged American hopes for early release of the hostages decided by the new Iranian parliament to be elected in balloting March 14 and April 3. 

Militants who have been holding the Americans since Nov. 4 immediately endorsed Khomeini's decision and reiter­ated their original condition that ousted Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi and his wealth be returned to Iran before they free their captives. The former monarch is living in Panama. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Saofgh Ghotrzangh yesterday also backed Khomeini's posi­tion. "It is the Imam Khomeini who determines foreign policy and we in the Revolutionary Council always approve his decisions,'' the official Pars Ne'Ys Agency quoted him as saymg.

''This is a period of extreme­ly difficult negotiations. What we want is a peaceful solution to the problem ... ," Carter told reporters. "I can't give any details about what we are doing." 
After the meeting with Bani­Sadr, according to a Tehran Radio broadcast monitored in Kuwait, the commission mem­bers issued a statement ex­pressing thanks to the presi­dent for assurances of coopera­tion they received yesterday and said, "We will go ahead in carrying our our mission."

Insur­gents lost 12 men, it said. Hezbi-Islami, a right-wing fundamentalist Moslem party, also claimed to have destroyed three Afghan Army tanks in neighboring Paktia Province. 
The claims could not be inde­
pendently confirmed. 
A Pakistani official in W aziris­
tan, near the Afghan border, 
reported the defection of 24 
Afghan militia officers and two 
former members of Parliament. 
Akbar Ahmad, the official, said the group ·crossed into Pakistan led by Afghan Maj. Gen. Ahmad Jan Masood. He quoted Masood as saying: ''The Afghans have risen against the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan as they are true Moslems and cannot tolerate foreign intervention.'' 
U. S. intelligence estimates there are some 70,000 Soviet troops inside Afghanistan, with another 30,000 across the Sov­iet border. The Kremlin inter­vened militarily in later Decem­ber to help put down the Moslem rebellion.

A closing ceremony in the ice arena Sunday night ended these Olympics, in which the 
U.S. team won a total of 12 medals, matching the biggest medal haul ever for an Amer­ican squad in Winter Games. 
The 1932 team also won 12 the last time the Olypics were in Lake Placid, and two Americans also won medals in the women's 500-meter speed skat­ing race that year. But that event was an exhibition at the rime, not a medal event. 
The two main celebrities cheering the U.S. hockey team to victory Sunday were Vice President Walter F. Mondale and Eric Heiden, who Saturday became the first man to sweep five gold medals in any WiP.ter Games. He set a world record in the· men's 10,000-meter speed skating event after set­ting Olympic records in the four earlier races. 


''This is one of the greatest moments I've been through in my life," said Mondale, who comes from Minnesota -hockey country -and admitted to being "sort of" a hockey freak. 
The Americans trailed 2-1 entering the final period. They pulled even on Verchota's 15­foot goal at 2:2 5 of the period and went ahead for good on McClanahan's five-foot shot to the left of Finnish goalie Iorma Valtonen at 6:05. Mark Johnson, whose father, Bob, 
by Michael Molinelli 

coached the 1976 American 
Olympic team, added an insur­
ance goal with 3:25 left and the 
boisterous crowd began chant­
ing "We're No. 1." 
The Americans shocked the 
nation and the hockey world 
Friday night when they came 
from behind three times to 
upset the mighty Soviet team, 
4-3. The Soviets had won the 
last four Olympic hockey gold 
medals. The U.S. team 
coached by Brooks of St. Paul, 
Minn., also had upset 
Czechoslovakia 7-3 in the 
second game of the tourna­
ment. 
So for the Americans, these Olympics belonged to 20 young hockey players with gold medals around their necks and to the amazing Heiden, 21, of Madison, Wis., who was photo graphed Sunday with all five of his golds. 
Other American medal win­
ners: 
--Figure skater Linda Fratianne or Northridge, Calif., who won a silver Saturday nishr and narrowly missed beaung East German Annet Potzsch, the gold medalist. 
--Speed skater Ofah Mueller of Dousman, Wis., who won silver medals in the women's 500 and 1 ,000-meter events. 
--Beth Heiden, Eric's younger sister, who won the bronze in the women's 3,000­meter speed skating event. 
--Charles Tickner of Littleton, Colo., who won the bronze medal in men's figure skating. 
--Phil Mahre of Yakima, Wash., won the silver in the men's slalom ski race. 
Fratianne was disappointed that she failed to follow Dorothy Hamill's 1976 performance and win the Olympic figure skating gold for the U.S. "I didn't think I could have skated any better," she said. "I was just sort of disappointed that I didn't have a gold medal around my neck." 
Heiden was easily the out­standing individual athlete with his five golds. Nikolai Zimyatov of the Soviet Union won two gold medals and one silver in Nordic ski racing. Hanni Wenzel of Liechtenstein won two gold and one silver in Alpine events and gave the tiny European principality in which she ltves its first Olympic gold ever.

even with my broken writing hand, l can write a statement faster than the marathon men under the Golden Dome. 
Jusr as the american people have voiced their disapproval of the actions of the Iranians, so too have the Notre Dame students demonstrated their sentiments regardi-ng the University's behavior. But all tht: petitions and signs and banners in the world mean little unless you can fill the seats of the arena. 
So, if you have a dollar (that's all, just a dollar) , it could speak louder than any petition. Buy a ticket and, who knows, maybe it will help free the hostages.

Fencers continue winning ways 
MADISON Wis. --Coach Mike DeCicco's Notre Dame fencers will take a 17-0 season le_dger and 122-meet winning streak into Thursday's encounter at Wayne State, thanks to victories over three schools here on Saturday. 
The Irish defeated Wisconsin, 19-8, Illinois, 17-10, and Minnesota, 19-8, to prepare for this week'.s "match of the season.'' Epeeists Kevin Tindell and Pat Rooney led the Irish, posting respective 5-0 and 4-0 marks on the afternoon.

U.S. hockey clinches goldas Olympics close 
LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) ­The dynamic, young United State hockey team came from behind twice to beat Finland 4-2 Sunda_y and capture this coun­try's first Olympic hockey gold medal in 20 years. It was truly an Olympic feat and the triumph generated more ex­citement across the nation than 
even Eric Heiden's record five gold medals in speed skating. Later Sunday, the Soviet 

Union routed Sweden 9-2 and 
won  the  silver  ice  hockey  
medal.  Sweden  won  the  
bronze.  

An ·outpouring of national­istic fervor followed the U.S.­Finland game in which Phil Verchota and Rob McClanahan scored third period goals 3:40 apart to break a 2-2 tie. The gold medal climaxed the XIII Winter Games, probably the only Olympics in which an American team will compete· this year. 
The crowd of 8,500 poured out of the Olympic Fieldhouse chanting "We're No. 1," "U-S-A" and "Bring on Iran." A band struck up ''God Bless America" and the crowd sang 
along.  
''Great!  Super!  Unbeliev­ 
able!''  shouted  Carlton  
Barnett,  42, a  fan  from  St.  

Louis. ''After all the problems 

in getting around this town, this makes these whole miserable two weeks worthwhile. '' 
He referred to the collapse of the Olympic bus transportation system that left thousands of spectators stranded during the first week of the Games and general disorganization and price-gouging that irritated visitors.

EAST LANSING--The Notre Dame hockey team does not know where it will be when the Western Collegiate Hockey Association playoffs begin in less than two weeks, nor does it know if ic has a future at all when this 1979-80 season con­cludes. 
Neither of those facts ts a surpnse. 
The University's administra­tion continued its closed-mouth policy on the program's status this past weekend, and says only that a statement is forth­coming. 
Notre Dame's race for home ice in the playoffs continued in much the same way--no deci­sion reached. 
The Irish split with Michigan Stare at the Munn Ice Arena over the weekend to put their league record at 13-12-1 and 
remain  in fourth  place.  The  
Spartans  won  Friday's  game  
7-6  while  Notre  Dame  came  

back Saturday afternoon for a· 9-5 victory. 
The triumph guaranteed the Irish at least a spot in the playoffs as they head into this weekend's season-ending series at the ACC against third place Minnesota. 
Ninth place Michigan State dropped t<? 11-15 in the league as 1t conttnues to struggle to gain a post-season berth. 
''At times we played just too 
lackadaisically," said Irish coach Lefty Smith, "especially in our own end. We were too loose on defense, passing the puck poorly, and when we went after it, we played the puck rather than the body. That always spells trouble. 
"On Saturday, though, our fourth line was a great factor. Their hustle sparked the whole

!'Ill' s11nilarites between America's situation in Iran 
and the current dilemma facing non-profit bearing 
"l'"ns at Notre Dame are numerous. Of course, you 
t 1uld never begin to compare the value of a human 
l1t'c t<J that of a university's athletic program, bur the 
'>I 1uat 1ons arc strikingly similar. 
On .J .uwarf 16. a group of adm.nistrative militants 
took over the future of Notre Dame non-profit 
lwanng sports, issuing a statement which placed a 
rtH>ratorrurn on the offering of athletic grants-in-aid 
r..,these sports. 
\1any student leaders asked questions as to the 
t a11onale behind the move, but received unsatis­
LtLtory answers. 
1~omrnunication, or rather the lack of it, became a ...c:rious problem. The militant's religious leader, the Ayatollah Edmund P. Joyce, closed himself off from public comment, sending Athletic Minister Jack S_rephens in his place to speak" at a forum on the matter. 
.Joyce continued to refuse interviews to loca! t<·levision, radio, newspapers, and concerned sr.ud­enrs. Senior hockey alternate captain Tom Michalek called in search of a meeting, only to learn chat the Ayatollah was out of town. Yet an hour later, student body president Bill Roche was granted a phone conversation with his holiness. 
1-'urcher questions arose as to exactly who was calling rhe shots. Was it Joyce, or perhaps another 


Michael Ortman 
religious leader. The Most Supreme M. 
Hesburgh, or possibly the University's Revolution­
ary Council, which was not to convene until February 
I )-16 in Key Biscayne, Fla.? 
llcsburgh spoke to hundreds of concerned stud­
ents, indrcating that hockey was the sport in greatest 
danger-"an experiment which has failed," he said. !'he militants opted to put the future of the sports .on trial before the Council, but would not allow  
hockey captain Greg Meredith to appear in their 
defense. 
And what of the meeting? 
Good question. We've been told a decision was 
made, but as to what it was, all lips are sealed. 
The Scholarship Crisis : 
MINOR SPORTS HELD HOSTAGE 
Day41 

Whether the decision is favorable or not, several 
possibilities linger as reasons for this silence. 
Could the administration have been waiting unci! Junior-Parents Weekend was over, hoping to fend off inquiries from parents if the decision was against the sports? 
Could the administration be waiting for Athletic Director Edward "Moose" Krause to return from vacation on March 1, so that he might use his public relations talents to help calm negative reaction to a negative decision? 
Could they have adopted a wait-and -see attitude regarding hockey? That is, if Notre Dame's hockey team won the national championship (that's not out uf the question), the University would look pretty silly if it Clropped the program, regardless of financial loss. A card player who has just won knows better than to get up and leave the cable. 
Could the powers be discussing the matter further? In other words, could the University's decision maker(s) have come to the realization that the nature of collegiate athletics has changed in the past 10 years, and that, perhaps, Notre Dame hasn't kept pace? 
Call it wishful thinking, but maybe people are rehashing their rationale. This weekend's stunning hockey gold medal for the United States, for instance, indicates that money isn't the bottom line. All but two ofAmerica's heart-warming hockey team hail from schools whose hockey programs lose a bundle of money. 
"A statement is forthcoming," we are told. But
