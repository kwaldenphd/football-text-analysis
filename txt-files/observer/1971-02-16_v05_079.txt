Burtchaell releases co-ed proposal 
University Provost Rev. James Burtchaell pre­sented a comprehensive proposal for coeducation to the ND-SMC Co-education Coordinating Committee at its meeting last Saturday at Laughin Lodge, Michigan. The group had called the meeting to discuss problems, ideas and plans surrounding the co-education issue at Notre Dame. 
Burtchaell's proposal was the highlight of the three-session, twelve hour meeting. Although he chose to withhold comment on the plan, pre­ferring to wait until he receives written reaction from the committee members, informed sources revealed the substance of the plan in broad outline. 
The sources claimed that the Burtchaell plan, which was presented by the Provost at the end of the meeting, cited five points which he believed to be essential to coeducation: social, academic, financial, personnel, and buildings. 
Of these five points, sources claimed Burtchaell

that the students at Notre Dame are "overrepresented." 
Decentralization proposal planned 
The newly formed Student Senate Constitutionai Commit­tee last night in informal session debated four departures from the current Student Government Constitution. Included was a proposal to abolish Student Government for a year. 
The proposal, raised by Sorin Hall Senator and former Execu­tive Coordinator Chuck Ryan, would have all branches of stu­dent Government, including

considered three critical: academic, personnel and buildings. 
In considering academic questions, the majority reportedly believed that there was no reason to initiate an experimental college such as the one described in the Runde plan, which would concentrate on a humanistic approach to education as opposed to a graduate school orientation. Many of those in attendance felt that it would be more beneficial to incorporate the two academic programs into one. 
Maintenance of the experimental college is not feasible since it would probably not accommodate more than 300 students and these students would have to have the same basic education as all of the other students before they could enroll in the special college's courses, sources said. 
In presenting the plan, Fr. Burtchaell reportedly stressed the need to reorganize the two campuses to profitable use all of the space. It is reported that he suggested consolidating the departments of education, economics, sociology and psychology into one social studies department quartered ·in one building. Burtchaell allegedly advocated moving Notre Dame's fine arts departments over to Moreau Hall at St. Mary's and re-allocaqng space in the Notre Dame library so that the St. Mary's library building could be used for another

Winings noted that his propos­al was necessitated by the con­troversy surrounding the suspen­sion of a student arrested during last semester's drug raid. He also noted that he and other students realized that the outcome of this amendment couldn't affect past

the original wording of the 
Code. 
Winings withdrew the propos­
al because he thought that the 
consideration of this amendment 
was being construed as an at­
tempt to interrupt the procedure 
in the current controversy. 
The SLC also discussed the nature of the interim report on Hall l.ife that it had agreed to submit to the Trustees. Shilts said that he had polled twenty hall rectors and twenty hall pres­idents for their opinions on par­ietals and alcoholic beverages. 
He noted that only half of the replies have been submitted and that no attempt was made to contact any representatives from St. Mary's. The preliminary re­plies indicate that extension of parietals is favored by most of the respondees. 

HLC asks for B-ba/1 tickets 
The Hall Life Commission of the Notre Dame Student Gov­
ernment and the Neighborhood Study Help Organization are running a campaign to bring 80 
children from South Bend to the campus for the Notre Dame-NYU basketball game on February 23. Both tickets and cars are needed. 
According to Chan!ling Brae­key, one ot the orgamzers ot the drive, 80 student tickets are needed for the game. Thev can be turned in at the Convocation Center Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of this week. The o[Jeration will be similar to that used for the Georgia Tech foot­ball game this year, when over 700 students turned their tickets in. Also needed are 20 drivers willing to pick the children up at Lin coin and Harrison High Schools at about 7 pm, and return the children to their homes at about ten-thirty. Anyone wishing to volunteer to drive or who· wants further information on the project should contact Bruce Bower, at 807 Flanner ( 1488).

Notre Dame led 45-35 at the half mainly on the basis of a­ligntning quick fast break trig­gered by either Catlett or Jones. 
Carr account~d for Notre Dnme's first six points while e 'v airo retaliated with some outside baskets by John Wolfenberg and the clutch inside shooting of center Lynn Seyfert. Despite Notre Dame's 53% shooting from the field in the first half, the Crusaders kept it close and were down only 33-39 with 
5: 58 left in the half. At that point, Valpo coach Bill Purden expressed his displeasure with an out of bounds call by flinging~ towel onto the court. Carr made good on the technical and by int~rmission the pressing tactics of Notre Dame and Johnny E­gart, in particular, had stretched the lead to ten.

Coach Dee emptied the bench with about three minutes remain­ing, and Austin Carr, who must have been arm weary after all that shooting, retired to a standing ovation. Statistics bore out the aggressiveness of Jones and Catlett on the boards as they to laled fourteen and ten rebounds, respectively. 
We!l-n questioned about Notre Dame's impe.nding battle with Fordham at Madison Square Garden, coach Dee replied, "I'm 
Sports Editor: 
This is about a coach. A coach here at Notre Dame. He's come in for a fair amount of criticism in hi~ time, and maybe we should look at the record, and then decide if this criticism is warranted. 
He came to Notre Dame with a pretty good reputation, and he took over a team that had a proud tradition, but not much else. In fact, they were having a hard time winning as many games as they were losing. So he went to work. 
You have to give him credit for one thing, he did a tremen­dous recruiting job. He got players to come to Notre Dame that you might have guessed were going out to the west coast to play their college ball. But he convinced them that Notre Dame was on its way to being a national power, and pretty soon, it looked like Notre Dame was. 
The Irish began to move up in the ratings. Our games were in demands by the television people; and tickets became a real status symbol, particularly for the big games. And the rea­son: all of a sudden, Notre Dame was going into every game know­ing it could win. So everything was fine? Right? 
Well, not quite. A lot of people, in fact, were kind of unhappy with the coach. They would grant you that he had brought some great players here, but with all those players, why couldn't the team ever have that one great season. Why were there always those games when somebody who had no business even staying close to us would sure it will be a tough game, they're another team in the top ten. This is the seventh time this season we've played a tP.::.m in the top ten." Dee clarified the status of John Pleick by saying, "I wanted to give him five straight days off, so he'd be ready to play against Fordham. Whether or not he starts depends on the individual match-ups." 
Finally, when asked if Austin Carr had turned in one of his better performances, Dee an­swered, "I don't know, it's hard to say." Which gives you some idea of the kind of year Austin is having. 30 
beat us. Like Michigan State, or that team from Indiana. 
And then there came this year. This was the team that nobody was going to beat. This team had the best ballplayer in the country, or so it was said. He wasn't real big, as players in this sport go, but he could do it all. Well, even with him, somebody 
still found a way to beat us, and make it look e1sy. So it's got to be the coach's fault, right? 
And look at post~eason play. How many years had it been since Notre Dame was involved in that. But this coach put to­gether a team that's been invited twice in a row. But do you remember that first year. When it was over, Notre Dame had come out of things a loser. And with that team. How could it be anything but the coach's fault. I mean, it just has to be. 
So here is this coach, and this team. A good team, sure. Better than most? Well, you might ask that coach from the west coast, or the one down south, who've both lost to Notre Dame teams coached by the guy I'm talking about. But what of it~ Shouldn't we expect more than an occa­sional victory over a big team from this guy. Hasn't he failed to get the most out of his players? Don't you think he should he fired? 
Well, if you do, you've been pretty quiet about it. Because the guy I'm talking about is Ara Parseghian; and as for the things I've said about his record, well, as Casey Stengel used to say, "you can look it up."

_P_ag_e-4--------------------------------------~ Q~~ 

WITH MAX SHULMAN 
tBy the author of Rall,11 Round the Flag, Boyff ... DohitGillis ... etr.) 

ESP; or Extra-Sensory Pollution 
Physicists tell us there are three basic forces at work in the uni­verse: matter, energy and chopped liver. 
But I, for one, am no longer satisfied with this narrow definition. How do physicists classify ESP? Certainly it falls into none of these categories, but just as certainly it exists. And not as a mere theory; ESP is a proven, demonstrated fact. 
For example, how many times have you walked into a place you never saw before and yet recognized everything? How many times have you known the exact words someone was going to say before he ever said them? How many times have you been absolutely certain some­thing was going to happen hundreds or even thousands of miles away and, sure enough, it did? 
Let me tell you about a case I am fortunately able to document. Some years ago I went fishing with my dear friend Donald L. Fromkiss at a virgin lake deep in the Canadian wilds. It was hellishly difficult to get there, but we did not mind, for the moment we dropped our lines we each caught a splendid crappie. Mine weighed just over 300 pounds. Donald's was somewhat smaller, but by far the friendlier. 
Imagine my surprise then when, before we could throw our lines back for another try, Donald suddenly leaped up and cried he'd had a premonition that he must go home immediately. He could not tell m11 why. He only knew that some one or some thing was calling him back and he had to go at once. Apologizing profusely, he left me alone on the lake and portaged to the nearest town (Moose Jaw, well over a thousand miles, and poison sumac every inch), and there he chartered a Ford Tri-Motor and flew home. 
Well sir, at first he felt like an utter dolt. Everything was perfectly normal at home. His wife Edith was quietly reading The Sensuous Woman. His son Herschel was taking his daily glassblowing lesson. His dog Trey was eating his leash. 
And yet the premonition would not leave Donald. Carefully, he went through the house, inch by inch, room by room. Sure enough, when he got to the back hall he suddenly heard a faint whimperihg noise outside. He flang open the door. And there, by George, he saw where the whimpering was coming from: someone had left a basket on the back stoop! 
Well sir, who can blame Donald for crying a cry of joy and tri­umph? What a find! A whimpering basket! That's something you don't see every day, let me tell you! 
And so today, as you know of course, Donald L. Fromkiss and His Whimpering Basket is one of the highest paid acts in show busi­ness. Next Sunday, in fact, he completes his 84th consecutive year on Ed Sullivan. 
As for me, I too was a beneficiary of Donald's ESP, for when he left me alone on the lake I figured I would get to drink all-not just half-of the goodly supply of Miller High Life Beer we had brought along, and as you know of course, Miller High Life is never so welcome as it is on a tranquil sylvan lake while a flock of Canada geese darkens the sky above. Of course, Miller isn't bad in a noisy bar either while a flock of American coeds darkens the jukebox. For that matter, it's even great in the dor.m while your cruddy roommate darkens the tub. 
But as it happened, I never did get to drink all our Miller High Life because I forgot how well sound travels across a sylvan lake. No sooner did I pop my first can of Miller when-lo and behold!-ten Mounties galloped out of the forest singing selections from Rose Marie! Of course, I shared my Miller with them, and gladly, because I know it's hard being a Mountie, especially if you're an alto. And so by the time they polished off my Miller and said adieu, we were all fast friends. One of them, in fact, let me slide down his hat. 
* * * 
We, the brewers of Miller High Life Beer and the sponsors of this col­umn, are like the Mounties in one respect: we too always get our man­that is, if our man wants a beer that always makes it right-Miller High Life, the Champagne of Beers!

In addition to the Student 
Union, the proposal would 
effect the Student Senate, the 
Cahinet, and the Student Body 

Presidency. Only the Hall Presi­
dent's Council would remain 
unaffected. 
The Committee was evenly 
divided in an informal vote 
count on the proposal taken

Devine contended that "Notre Dame is small enough to support such a method. This would hring power hack to the halls. There's no need for this size of beauro­cracy in this small of a place." 
Committee Chairmann Tom Thrasher, a stay Senator from Grace Hall, introduced a pro­posal to replace Senate election with what he described as a "selection-by-petition process."

The new bus would increase the frequency of the huses from every 15 minutes during the day, to every ten minutes. Buses will leave SMC at ten after the hour and every ten minutes after­wards. They will leave the Notre 

Dame  Library  at  five  after the
