Consbuction cause ofSMC gas leak 
Authorities respond to line breach near Le Mans Hall; report it is harmless and contained

News Writers 
Construction workers installing storm sewers on the south side of Le Mans Hall, east of the Moreau Center for the Arts, struck a low-pres­sure gas line, allowing a small amount of gas to seep from the ground onto Saint Mary's campus at approximately 6:30 
p.m. Monday. 
Timm Ringer, the College's maintenance working super­visor, said there is no danger to students, but said he did not know how long it would take to turn the gas off. 
"We brought in the 
Northern Indiana Public Service Company {NIPSCO), we're waiting from the word from them to be able to shut this down to see what it's going to affect on the build­ings," Ringer said. 
Bill Rambling, director of the facilities department, said in a statement to The Observer that NIPSCO was on campus within 10 minutes of the gas leak. 
"NIPSCO quickly capped the line and determined there was no need for an evacua­tion of either building," Rambling said in the state­ment, released by Gwen 0' Brien, director of media rela­

College 
chooses new RAs 
44 students selected to oversee dorm life 
By LIZ HARTER 
Saint Mary's Editor 
Shortly before spring break, the Saint Mary's Office of Residence Life informed 44 students that they would be hired as resident assistants (RAs) for the 2008-2009 aca­demic year. The group includes 31 students who are new to the position. 
Life as a Saint Mary's RA intertwines dorm living, the full-time workload of a col­lege student and the signifi­cant responsibilities of creat­ing unique living situation for students who decide to take on the job. 
Sophomore Melissa Croft said she was very excited after being informed that she will be the RA of 5 South in McCandless Hall, but is also "very nervous, but the good kind of nervous." 
She said she has wanted to be an RA since she found out what the position entailed when her older sister, Elaine, attended the University of Chicago. 
"I think it is a really unique opportunity to be a part of the campus community and to get to know several groups of people including the entire residence life staff, my partic­ular hall's staff and of course the women in my individual section," Croft said. 
Croft said she is looking for-

NO insta11s new alert system 
Second trial proves more successful; OIT improves e-mail delivery 
By MADELINE BUCKLEY 
News Writer 
More than 20,000 text messages, voice-mails, and c-mails were successfully sent to students, faculty, and staff Friday afternoon as part of the University's 
effort to set up a  system of  
communication  for  an  
emergency.  

The ND alert test was a response to problems that occurred in the previous test of the system, which took place in November, Chief Information Officer Gordon Wishon said. 
"We specifically ran this test to see if the refine­
ments we made had been effective," Wishon said. "We don't have all the results in yet, but the preliminary results look very good." 
After the first system test, OIT noted a delayed deliv­ery of a number of the emergency e-mails, and students and faculty report­ed "garbled voice mes­sages," Wishon said. In the past months, orr looked closely at these failures, and made the necessary changes. 
To improve the delayed e­mails, OIT has worked with the system administrators and "made some changes in the way campus e-mail is delivered," Wishon said. 
Before the campus-wide test, the department con­ducted some internal tests, all which indicated that the 
· changes were effective. As for the voice-mails, OIT discovered the source of the problems, and Wishon said there have been no reports of garbled messages. Of all the meth­ods of communication, Wishon said text messaging worked best. "Over 96 percent of all texts were delivered suc­cessfully," Wishon said. "Our text messaging system keeps exceeding our expec­tations."

Alumnae discusses leadership roles 
By NIKKI TAYLOR 
NewsWrirer 
Saint Mary's alumnae and Board of Trustees member Paula Dawning spoke about her life and qualities she thinks are important for women in leadership roles at the Saint Mary's Leadership Luncheon Monday. 
A South Bend native, Dawning took the audience through her life and the important lessons she took away from .her varied expe­riences. She said she can see the formation of leadership qualities throughout her life. 
For example, Dawning was the fifth of thirteen children. "Being one of thirteen kids, you 
learn how to speak up for your­self, or you'll get lost in the crowd," Dawning said. "You learn how to fend for yourself." 
Dawning was very thankful for her Saint Mary's education and the opportunities it gave her, including the chance to spend her sophomore year in Angers, France. While in France, Dawning had her first real expe­rience with being different, as she was one of the only African­Americans in the city. 
"I learned how to go in and be different, and be unique. That served me well in corporate America," Dawning said.

INSIDE COLUMN 
The year's best holiday 

As I sit here and think about the cold, the snow, and the mountain of home­work that is piling up on my desk, I lind myself not being able to wipe a giant smile oil' of my face. Why'! It's because 
my favorite holi­ 
day oeeurs this  Andy Ziccarelli  
week. Easter'!  
Nope. Better. The best holiday of the  Sports Wire Editor  
entire year is the  
first and second  

rounds of the Men's NCAA Tournament a four day basketball extravaganza that is unlike any other sporting event any­where. 
I know I am not alone. America is coming down with a case of March Madness along with me, whether it is for good or for bad. Online business maga­zine Slate.com estimates that $3.8 billion are lost in worker productivity during the NCAA tournament and that $750 million arn wagered every year on the tournament. That isn't even counting the millions of dasses skipped by high s<~hool and collnge students to catch the games. 
But there is a reason for it. More than any other sporting event, the NCAA tour­nament allows lor fan participation by filling out a bracket (and likely wagering a few dollars in a pool). It is the only event where you get to pick the winner of such a vast amount of games, sliding each team as much or as little as you decide. Don't like a team'? Pick them to lose in the first round and then root vehenwntly against them. Or, go ahead and do as I did and put the Fighting Irish in tho Final Four. You are ultimately in eharge of your bracket, and the power is intoxicating. 
And because everyone has a bracket, each of the 63 games has a meaning. You. personally, have picked a winner li>r all of the gamns that am on at any given moment. Since you have probably laid down some cash, or are just playing for bragging rights with your friends (or both), you cheer hard for your team to win in every single game, no matter how much you cared about the team one week ago, before the tournament start­ed. Go ahead. watch and see how many people will be glued to the UNLV-Kent State game on Thursday afternoon. 
The only things we love more than our bracket<> are upsets. It is an American institution, something we have seen over and over again in our lives. We love to see the scrappy underdog challenge and beat the talented favorite who might not be giving them their due. It is the reason why America fell in love with George Mason, a No. 11 seed who slayed basket­ball gianl<> North Carolina and Connecticut on its way to the Final Four in 2006. And even though these under­dogs are not as talented, and have almost no realistic chance to win the tournament, it is a once a year treat to see them play with the intensity and pas­sion that they do. 
So go ahead, skip class, ditch work and become a couch potato for the weekend. Use this column as an excuse note if you need to. The best holiday of the year starl<> Thursday at 12:20 p.m. and I, for one, am not going to miss a minute.

ND aids N at'l Park Service 
Three undergraduates conduct research related to cutting costs 
Special to The Observer 
The University-National Park Energy Partnership Program (UNPEPP) has funded a joint project between the Notre Dame Energy Center and the National Park Service at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore to provide energy 
related consulting services to the park during this coming summer. 
During the course of the project, three undergraduate students from the University will work with park officials, conduct­ing onsite research that will result in specific recommendations for capital improvement at the Indiana Dunes facilities. 
According to Joan F. 
Brennecke, Keating-Crawford Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and director of the Notre Dame Energy Center, the students' work will focus on energy con­servation and savings. 
"This is a wonderful opportu­nity for the students to put their training into practice in a real-world setting that encom­passes project management designs for a grass roof system for Building 110 at the park headquarters, and the creation of educational materials for park guests that describe the proposed improvements and energy savings. 
UNPEPP is a nationwide pro­gram that links universities with national parks to address energy issues within the parks. Through these partnerships, parks gain assistanc.e with energy related issues, while students obtain problem-solv­ing experience in the energy field. Since its inception in 1997, UNPEPP has funded numerous partnerships between universities and national parks. Funding typi­cally ranges from $15,000 to $20,000 per project and is used to support students, and faculty and equipment purchases. 
The Notre Dame Energy Center works to develop new technologies to meet the global energy challenge. Housed in the College of Engineering, the center focuses on five areas of expertise: energy efficiency, safe nuclear waste storage, clean coal utilization, carbon dioxide separation, and storage and renewable resources. The center, which was established in 2005, is also committed to playing key roles in energy education and literacy, the development of energy .policy and the exploration of the ethi­cal implications associated with energy. 

NYC investigates crane safety after accident 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -They are part of New York's skyline: hun­dreds of spindly construction cranes like the one that top­pled over the weekend, pul­verizing parts of a city block below and killing seven peo­ple. As the machines work furiously amid a supercharged building boom, experts say it's always a risk. 
Operating cranes in a city of 
8.2 million people where apartments and offices ar~ stacked so closely and on top of one another is especially tricky. 
"Because of the tightness of a construction site in New York City, there's always the problem of having less space, and also there's the problem that if anything does go wrong, there are a lot of peo­ple at risk," said Gene Corley, a structural engineer. 
The city will launch a safety sweep of the cranes in use around the city, Buildings Commissioner Patricia Lancaster said Monday, although officials have no rea­son to believe the accident was "indicative of a larger problem." 
Six construction workers and a woman in town for St. Patrick's Day were killed Saturday when the crane broke away from an apart­ment tower under construc­tion and toppled like a tree onto buildings as far as a block away. The last three bodies were found Monday. 
The crane was being length­ened with a new section -a process known as "jumping" -when it tumbled to the street. A 6-ton steel collar used to secure the crane to the building came loose, the buildings department said. 
When the collar fell, it clanged into another collar on the ninth floor that acted as a major anchor, ·and without that sup'port the counter­weights at the top of the crane's tower pitched it over, the buildings department said. 
Pieces of the crane hurled themselves forward as they crashed to the ground, coming to a rest a full block away. By the time it was over, a brown­stone was pulverized, at least seven other buildings were damaged, and 24 people were injured. 
The scale of the damage gives some sense of a con­struction crane's heft and span. 
This particular model, known as a tower crane, had a 200-foot mast, comprising 13 sections that each weighed 11,000 pounds. The cab and deck at the top of the mast weighed about 50,000 pounds, the boom weighed about 20,000 pounds, and the coun­terweights added up to about 80,000 pounds, city officials said.

To ensure the safety of stu­dents, there are certain cri­teria that HAs must meet to be considered for the posi­tion. 
Candidates must not have any outstanding debts to the College or be on disciplinary probation, the Hesidence Life Web site said. Applicants must also be at least rising sophomores and have at least a 2.5 grade point aver­age. 
"When hiring HAs, we are looking for women who are passionate about making a positive impact at Saint Mary's in this leadership role," Kathleen O'Leary, assistant director of the Office of' Hesidence Life said. "We are looking for students who will be able to balance their academic workload with the demands of the HA position and have fun doing it." 
HAs' residential placement depends entirely upon where Hesidence Life feels the can­didates' strengths would best fit the needs of' the residents. 
Croft said she knows that being an HA is a full time job, but thinks she will be able to handle having to set aside large amounts of time to be on call and meeting with other HAs. They must also be available to work the front desk in case a shift needs to be covered at the last minute.

Suicide bomber leaves at least 43 dead 
BAGHDAD -A female suicide bomber struck Shiite worshippers in the holy city of Karbala on Monday, an official and a witness said, killing at least 43 people and leaving pools of blood on the street leading to one of Iraq's most revered mosques. 
The blast was the deadliest in a series of attacks that left at least 72 Iraqis dead, includ­ing six youths killed when mortar rounds slammed into a soccer field in eastern Baghdad. 
Two U.S. soldiers also were killed Monday in a roadside bombing north of Baghdad, bringing the American death toll closer to 4,000 as the U.S.-led war enters its sixth year. At least 3,990 members of the U.S. military have died since the beginning of the Iraq war in March 2003, according to an Associated Press count.

A preliminary city investigation found that the crane toppled after a steel collar used to tie it to the side of the building fell as workers attempted to install it. 
The crane, which rose 19 stories, came crashing down on a Manhattan neighborhood a few blocks from the United Nations on the city's east side. 
McCartney reaches divorce settlement 
LONDON -Money may not buy her love, but Paul McCartney's ex sure has a lot more of it now. 
One of Britain's bitterest divorces reached a settlement Monday when Heather Mills was awarded $48.6 million -an enormous sum, but a fraction of what she sought and a sliver of the former Beatie's $800 million fortune. 
Mills declared herself "very, very, very pleased" with a payout that amounted to about $34,000 for each day of her four-year marriage. But some legal experts were surprised the former model, who has been widely portrayed in the British media as a gold-digger, did not get more.

Paterson sworn in following scandal 
New York's first blackgovernor succeeds Eliot Spitzer, eager to move past predessor's collapse 
Associated Press 
ALBANY, N.Y. -David Paterson was sworn in as governor Monday before a crowd of lawmakers who chanted his name and cheered his message of unity in a state eager to move past his predecessor's sordid and speedy political collapse. 
Paterson became the state's first black chief execu­tive and nation's second legally blind governor almost exactly a week after allega­tions first surfaced that Gov. Eliot Spitzer was "Client 9" of a high-priced call girl service. 
"We move forward. Today is Monday. There is work to be done," Paterson said. "There was an oath to be taken. There's trust that needs to be restored. There are issues that need to be addressed." 
Spitzer, according to ex­aides, was at his Columbia County farmhouse 48 miles south at the time of Paterson's swearing-in. 

Where Spitzer's 14-month tenure was marked by parti­san sniping, Paterson, a fel­low Democrat, reached across the aisle in his remarks from the ornate Assembly chamber.

IN BRIEF Paulson praised for economic tactics 
WASHINGTON -Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the consummate Wall Street baron who amassed a fortune at investment giant Goldman Sachs, is applying his insider knowledge to help manage a credit-market meltdown. 
Known as "Hank the Hammer" when he led Goldman Sachs, Paulson is winning praise for using hard-nosed bargaining tac­tics to strike deals seen as critical to coping with the worst crisis to face financial mar­kets since the savings and loan crisis of the early 1990s. 
Paulson heads the President's Working Group on Capital Markets, which briefed President Bush at the White House on Monday. He said the president was "quite pleased" with the results of the marathon negotiations over the weekend that resulted in a deal for the sale of troubled investment house Bear Stearns Cos. to JPMorgan Chase & Co. 
Industrial production hits record low 
WASHINGTON -Industrial output fell in February by the biggest amount in four months, providing yet another gloomy assessment of the economy's health. 
The Federal Reserve said Monday that output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities dropped by 0.5 percent in February, the biggest decline since a 0.6 percent fall last October. 
It was a far weaker reading than the slight increase of 0.1 percent that many analysts had been expecting. It served to underscore the severity of the current eco­nomic slowdown. 
Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, said he believed that the manufacturing sector fell into a recession in October and the overall economy followed in December. 
"The economic shock of a housing col­lapse. credit crunch, including financial sector turmoil. and sky-high oil prices have squeezed consumers' budgets to the point where there is no growth left," he said.

Wall Street recovers as investors grab bargain stocks following buyout ofBear Stearns 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Wall Street ended a temperamental session widely mixed Mond ay after investors grappled with JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s government-backed buyout of the stricken investment bank Bear Stearns Cos. 
The Dow Jones industri­als recovered from an ini­tial drop of nearly 200 points to finish up about 21 points. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes ended lower as investors bailed out of investment banks and small-t~ap stocks and fled instead to large companies apt to be reli­able during a weak econo­my. 
"You move to the defen­sive names in times of mar­ket uncertainty -safer, consumer names," said Ryan Detrick, senior techni­cal strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research.

Yreka still has inependence hopes 
Northern California city sought separation from state 67 years ago 
Associated Press 
YHEKA, Calif. --In extreme 
Northern California, far from 
the bright lights of Hollywood 
and the foggy charms of San 
Franeiseo, is a placn unknown 
to most people: a handful of 
counties that onee sought to 
make thnrnselves into a sepa­
rate state ealled Jefl"erson. 
The idea lasted only a few 
days in 1941 before it was 
quashed by the attack on Pearl 
Harbor. But for a few who 
ronwmber its history, thH move­
ment mnbodins the rnindset of 
this sparsely populatod eountry 
that slill longs for morn autono­
my. 
"Wo've always fostered an 
independent streak up hern," 
said Pete LaFortunn, executive 
director of the Chamber of 
Commerce in Yn~ka (pro­
nouneed why-HEEK-ah), about 
270 miles north of San 
Frandsen. 
More than six deeades later, 
many residents of tlw mountain­
ous region along the California­
Orngon border continue to com­
plain that their eonenrns are 
ovnrlooked and umll~rvalued by 
dndsion makers in morn popu­
lated areas. 
The State of Jefferson began 
as part publicity stunt, part 
politkal w~sturn. Even today, the 
movmnnnt is made up of tourist­
frinndly whimsy intertwined 
with morn serious themes of dis­
content. 
In the Palaeo Barber Shop on 
Yreka's main drag hangs an 
animal skull decorated with the 
XX brand adopted by the 
Jefl'ersonians of 1941 to signify 
their disgust with being "dou­
ble-crossed" by authorities. 
"A lot of the laws and dill'erent 
things that affeet us are voted 
on by people who've never been 
here and don't know anything 
about us," said John Lisle, a 
barber at the shop, which 
stands on a site that is said to 
have offered haircuts since 
Ywka was a Gold Hush town. 
Another barber, Hichard Pease, agreed: "Whm1 we vote on something, it doesn't make mueh diiTernnce at all because onH precinct down there out­numbers the whole county here. You vote, but you fe1~l like your votn is going down the tube." 
Siskiyou County, home to Yreka, has about 46,000 resi­dents spread over 6,400 square miles. Although registered Hepublieans have only a modest edge over registered Democrats, residents are often at odds with more liberal parts of the state. 
The 1941 secessionists were angry about the region's poor roads, which beeame useless in winter. 
"Our Hoads are Not Passable, Hardly Jaekassable," went the rallying cry. 
Thnse days, it's not hard to get to Yreka. Interstate 5, which runs the length of California, is a long, smooth route through fir-covered hills and Mount Shasta, a popular recreation spot. 
But there is plenty of resent­ment simmering over long­standing government limits on logging and fishing, and a pro­posal to rip out a series of hydronleetric darns on the Klamath i{iver to help struggling salmon runs. 
Bill Overman, chairman of the Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors, is among those concerned that removing the dams will hurt property values for people living along the reservoirs. Like previous lead­ers, he chafes at the feeling that outside forces are calling the shots. 
"We would like to be able to take eare of our resources and be able to manage them prop­erly, and we ean do that if we're just allowed to," Overman said. 
The idea of forming a sepa­rate state out of the counties in far Northern California and southern Oregon has eome up several times in the past. 
"It's really a very, very old historieal tradition in Ameriea that people sort of removed from the center of power resent the eenter of power," said Jay Mullen, professor of history at Southern Oregon University. 
The 1941 movement got started when Gilbert Gable, mayor of Port Orford, Ore., announced that a number of Oregon counties should join with California neighbors to form a new state. His idea was to draw attention to the region's rotten roads. 
The idea caught fire, espe­cially in Siskiyou County, and Yreka became the nascent state's temporary capital. 
Jefl'erson's attempt to secede got national attention. San Franciseo Chroniele reporter Stanton Delaplane won the Pulitzer Prize in 1942 for his artieles about the rebellious movement. 
But with the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, the movement was shelved. 
Today, the brief chapter is memorialized on a Web site, jefl'ersonstate.com, and a barn south of Yreka painted with the name "State of Jefferson." It's also recalled in the name of Jefferson Public Radio, based in Ashland, Ore. License plate holders reading "resi­dent of the State of Jefl'erson" are a popular item.

Twister knocks Atlanta's hotel rooms out ofuse 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA --Workers strug­gled to their offices Monday through debris and snarled traffic days after a tornado struck downtown, but no long­term effects on the eity's lucrative convention and tourism industry were antiei­pated. 
The twister knockPd hun­dreds of hotel rooms out of commission and significantly damaged the city's largest con­vention venue, the Georgia World Congress Center, said Spurgeon Hichardson, presi­dent and CEO of the Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureau. 
"We are open for business," Hichardson told reporters. 
A volleyball tournament next weekend was still on and expected to bring 38,000 peo­ple to Atlanta, though it will likely be scattered around ven­ues throughout the metro area instead of concentrated at the World Congress Center as plannPd, of'licials said. 
The Omni I lotel lost the USP of nearly 500 rooms when the tornado struck Friday night but is still hosting a 600-per­son U.S. Department of Energy conference this week, said hotel marketing director Mike Sullivan.

The president does have a major advantage: support from Iran's supreme leader. A key question will be whether Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's backing lasts until presidential elections expected in the summer of 2009. 
Conservatives maintained their hold on the parliament in Friday's election, but their camp is split over Ahmadinejad. His conserva­tive opponents won a solid bloc that will likely clash with the president over the next year. 
Reformists also managed to preserve their presence even though most of their candi­dates were barred from the race. 
"If the government contin­ues the policies that have been controversial, the majority of the parliament will be against it," said Amir Ali Amiri, spokesman of the Inclusive Coalition of Principlists, an election slate 
of conservatives who have broken with the hard-line president. 
Amiri said the coalition might put forward a candi­date for the presidency, but said "we must wait" until the political situation becomes clearer, according to the semi-official ISNA news agency. 
Two men are seen as top possibilities to challenge Ahmadinejad: Tehran Mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf and former nuclear negotia­tor Ali Larijani, who won a parliament seat in the elec­tion. 
The strength of Ahmadinejad's conservative opponents likely won't mean. changes in Iran's tough line toward the United States. 
They support pushing ahead with Iran's nuclear program despite U.N. sanc­tions. But they also oppose Ahmadinejad inflammatory rhetoric, which they say has provoked the West. Some seek greater pragmatism in dealing with the outside world. 
The economy has been Ahmadinejad's weakest point. Jumps in inflation have at least doubled prices for some foods over the past year, and unemployment is believed by some economists to be around 15 percent. And the public has been angered by gas rationing and heating oil shortages during the unusually cold winter. 
Ahmadinejad's critics say his economic policies have been haphazard and only made the situation worse. 
Amiri said his camp would seek to elect Larijani as par­liament speaker ---a post now held by an Ahmadinejad ally -and oppose the cur­rent deputy speaker, who is widely seen as the brain behind the president's rise to power. 
Still, Khamenei has become more overt in his backing for Ahmadinejad, despite grum­blings in the conservative camp. The supreme leader, as head of Iran's clerical leadership, has final word in all state matters. 
Khamenei ·tries to stay above factional disputes in public, but took the unusual step before the election of expressing strong support for the president, calling on vot­ers to choose candidates allied to the government. 
One reason may be the nuclear issue. Khamenei has praised Ahmadinejad's han­dling of the matter, and the clerical powers may see him as best able to stand up to the West. 

FRANCE 
Funeral remembers last WWI veteran 
Associated Press 
PARIS -France unfurled its military majesty Monday in honor of its last World War I veteran, who died last week at 110, and all the other Frenchmen who fought in the conflict. 
Flags fell to half-staff and the president unveiled a plaque at the gold-domed edifice where Napoleon is buried to honor Lazare Ponticelli and the 8.4 mil­lion other Frenchmen who served in a war that tore Europe apart. 
The day of national commemo­ration was ordered by President Nicolas Sarkozy, who wants younger generations to remember the sacrifices of "les poilus" -an affectionate nickname meaning hairy or tough that France uses for its WWI veterans. 
"Never again will anyone tell their grandchildren or great­grandchildren about the terrible life of the trenches," Sarkozy said. "No more, will anyone hear the. old 'poilu' tell his grandchildren or great-grandchildren: 'Never make war again."' 
"We will never forget them." 
The solemn day began with a Roman Catholic funeral Mass attended by Sarkozy, government ministers, soldiers and teary-eyed members of Ponticelli's family at the Saint-Louis Cathedral, part of the Invalides complex that honors France's military and houses Napoleon's tomb. 
"You didn't talk much but when you did, we felt your wisdom, that you doubted nothing and were determined," Ponticelli's grand­son, Patrick Large, said during the Mass. 
Flags representing all military divisions that fought in World War I were later ceremoniously unfurled. 
Ponticelli was a French citizen for most of the past century and an unusual soldier who fought first for France, then for Italy, where he was born. 
Representatives of the Italian Alpine brigade for which he fought, along with its French counterpart, attended the Mass. 
The 1914-1918 conflict, known at the time as the Great War or the "war to end all wars," killed millions. Only a handful of veter­ans from the war are still living, scattered from Australia to the United States and Europe. Germany's last WWI veteran died on New Year's Day. 
Monuments to battles and war dead cover swathes of France where trenches divided the land­scape during the war, which left 
1.4 million French fighters dead. Ponticelli was born Dec. 7, 1897, in Bettola, northern Italy. 
To escape a tough childhood, he trooped off at age 9 to join his brothers in France, eventually becoming a French citizen.

Ever since I got this column, I've wanted to write about Barack Obama. At first, I wanted to praise him for being so positive and staying above the harsh rhetoric common to ambitious politicians. As a conservative (well, mainly), I wanted to express my grat­itude for the fact that he, from what I could tell, didn't hate me. It was so nice to see such a prominent Democrat refrain from constantly accusing Hepublicans of hat­ing poor people/old people/little peo­pln/Mexicans/blacks/Muslims/gays/wom en/children/polar bears/etc. I found his warmth and charm a pleasant contrast to his main rival, who I bet would like to bite my face off and eat my brain. Even his name's cool. So duped was I that I nurtured the hope that his ultra­liberal voting record was just a means to get the nomination, and that once elected he'd govern as a moderate. 
By the time I'd submitted articles I considered higher-priority, though, the "Look -this guy's not a shrill partisan jerk!" story was old news. Even impor­tant conservatives had written glow­ingly about Illinois' junior senator, or at least as glowingly as they could about a liberal, and not just because they enjoyed seeing someone giving the Clintons problems. 
My next Obama idea was more about his supporters. Friends who follow pol­itics carefully began telling me about the more ridiculous aspects of Obama mania -people actually fainting at his rallies, describing their "coming to Obama" conversions, making creepily propagandist YouTube videos, etc. By then, I'd realized his campaign was just a bunch of hot air, and that his movement was mainly a pop-culture phenomenon, a shallow fad. I found it especially amusing that most of his support, aside from black voters, was coming from the highly-educated ­the last group you'd expect to fall for smooth empty oratory (unless you're cynical about contemporary higher education, like me). I thought of Santino's question to Michael, whether he'd gone to college to get stupid. 


Once again, though, I was the last lion to the kill. Poking fun at the over­the-top-ness of Obama hype had become a common theme, as had criti­cism of his message as vacuous. So I'd decided to forget about him, and was thinking of writing an advice piece for seniors about how to enter the whitl~­collar world (item: if the ol'fice go-to girl comes to your cubicle seeking a donation for an AIDS charity, don't ask whether she'd contracted it). Then I saw tllR latest issue of Holling Stone. 
At first I thought it was a parody. It's gotta be, right? Then I realized it was­n't, and I was reminded of a book by the great Hussian Orthodox mystic/the­ologian, Vladimir Soloviev. In it, the leaders of the Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant faiths go to meet a mysteri­ous, popular world leader, who's prom­ised to usher in a new order of peace and universal brotherhood and all that good stuff. All his words are spirit and light, and there's even hushed specula­tion in some quarters about whether he could be Our Lord come back to earth, or maybe a man who'd prepare for His return, like a second St. John the Baptist. I think it was the Protestant who, in their meeting with the great man, realized with horror that he was none other than the Antichrist. 
Before you think I'm totally nuts, wait. I don't believe Barack's the Antichrist. Even if biotech develop­ments -human cloning's inevitability, recent creation of embryonic human­animal hybrids, etc. -make me believe time's near its end, there's still much that must happen before the man of sin appears. Besides, there's a goofiness about Obama and his cult that won't be found with the Antichrist. But there's a point-and r think we've reached it with Obama-where gross­ly unmerited adulation and adoration stops being funny, and starts being sin­ister. And there's a point too where a man can no longer deny responsibility for the cult-like following he's gained. Even though I'm deeply cynical, rarely surprised at man's capacity for self­love and little shocked by any sugges­tion that most people end up damned, I still think normal people would be at least a bit bothered by the veneration Obama's received. Hmnembor Monty Python's Brian? I'm conceited myself, and I was siekened by my own surprise graduation party. But Obama seems perfectly comfortable being treated like a god. And I believe it takes a spfl­eial, espeeially evil, man to accept such worship. 
With the ongoing On-Eaghl's-Wings­ification of' tho Church, many Catholics consider tlw idea of thn Antichrist an embarrassing anachronism. That's one reason lw'll manage to gain power. Those who do still look for his entry into history are likely to expect a bloodthirsty savage riding a chariot of human skulls. That's another reason he'll fool so many, for he'll be more Lennon than Lenin. 
Don't get me wrong-thcml's plenty about Obama's politics I consider pro­foundly evil. For instaneo, his opposi­tion to laws protecting babies born in botched abortions (amazing how the little stinkers resist being chopped up). Indeed, the odiousness of his positions is one reason he keeps his speeches away from pesky specifics and policy. But it's his ability to inspire religious fanaticism toward himself, and his delight in it, which I lind most disturb­ing, even chilling. And it's these fea­tures of his candidacy that I think will be of most lasting significance.

An eye for an eye ... 
There are certain videos posted on YouTube that have become Internet cult classics. An interview of a kid at a carni­val, "Zombie kid like turtles" has four million views. The adorable British brothers in "Charlie bit my finger -Andrea again!" have been Laidman watched twelve mil­lion times on High Sounding YouTube. A clip of a Words toddler boy with an endearing and comical laugh, simply titled "Hahaha," boasts 48 million views. 
These videos offer thirty seconds or a minute of humor, but give viewers little else. And while sites like YouTube have begun to play a role in the political process -evident with the abundance of videos and channels dedicated to cov­ering the 2008 presidential primaries ­videos that offer wisdom alone are largely ignored by the internet commu­nity. 
"Victim to Panel: No to Death Penalty, No to Revenge," is one such clip. With only 1, 700 views, it doesn't even begin to compete on YouTube's "most viewed" page, but the testimony offered in the video is perhaps the most insightful and comprehensive statement about the death penalty that I've encountered over several years on working on the issue. 
Aundre Herron is a former prosecutor in California whose eldest brother was murdered in 1994. In this YouTube clip, filmed during hearings on the death penalty currently occurring in California and posted by the group California 
LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Sheen deserving 

When I received the e-mail regarding who I wanted to be the speaker at the 2008 Commencement, one name came to mind: Martin Sheen. I was excited to hear that he is being awarded the Laetare Medal. Thus, I have to respectfully dis­agree with Jay Rowley ("Sheen doesn't deserve Laetare Medal," March 17), who argues that Sheen is not a "genius". 
First, the man is a fine actor. Have you ever seen The West Wing? The show won an Emmy for Best Drama four straight years. That has to count for something. In it, Sheen plays President Josiah "Jed" Bartlett, the best fictional president ever (James "Get off my plane!" Marshall in Air Force One comes in a close second). Bartlett got a B.A. in American Studies from none other than the University of Notre Dame. After getting a Ph.D. from the London School of Economics, he won a Nobel Prize, taught at Dartmouth, served as Governor of New Hampshire and then saved the free world as President of the United States. 
He speaks fluent Latin, memorized the Bible and makes the Press Corps sing the Notre Dame Victory March. Obama!Hilary!McCain have nothing on this man. Our University owes a great deal to this fictional President and the fine actor who plays him. 
Finally, Martin Sheen has given us two other fine actors of our day: Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Anyone who has seen The Three Musketeers or The Mighty Ducks knows how crucial each of these sons was to the movie. Thus, Martin Sheen deserves the Laetare Medal for his great acting and the great acting sons he fathered.

Crime Victims for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, Herron describes her ini­tial reaction to her brother's death as one of vengeful vigilantism. She says she wanted to pick up a gun and roam the streets in pursuit of her brother's killer. 
But given time to reflect and heal, Herron explained to the panel, she reached an insightful position on the death penalty that does not forget the real rage and desperation felt by vic­tims. 
"I understand that this sense of revenge is a very legitimate emotion, but it is not a legitimate basis for public policy. I think we denigrate our own noble ideals when we use revenge and we use the public fist for the purpose of killing our fellow human beings." 
Bud Welch, who spoke at Notre Dame in early November 2007, lost his daugh­ter in the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995. Like Herron, Welch initially react­ed with anger, only later to arrive at his stance against the death penalty. Speaking in the Montgomery Theatre of LaFortune on Nov. 7, Welch said to a group of Notre Dame students: 
"The very idea that this revenge of killing another person is going to some­how help you to heal ... it's impossible. I was trying to go through the healing process while I was living with this revenge, and you can't do it." 
Another speaker who visited Notre Dame this fall, Dr. Michael Radelet of the University of Colorado-Boulder, argues against the death penalty and for the families of murder victims in anoth­er way. He is involved in fighting for a reallocation of funds from maintaining Colorado's capital punishment system to paying for re-investigations of cold cases. 

Rather than seek the so-called highest form of revenge for only a few families, this movement asks that resources be used to work toward answers for all families impacted by the tragedy of murder. 
Herron, too, points to the financial irresponsibility of the death penalty in California, where 114 million dollars are spent each year to uphold the death penalty system: 
"It is a stunning irony, I think, that even as the governor [of California] is about to announce a deficit of fourteen billion dollars, we can still find funds to kill those who kill-all the while pro­claiming that killing is wrong. We can pay prison guards more than teachers, and exalt state-sanctioned killing to a place of greater importance than healthcare and housing, than paying workers a living wage, than protecting our children, our seniors, the disabled and the disadvantaged." 
According to Aundre Herron, a woman who has worked both as a pros­ecutor and a defender, who has "com­forted surviving family members and counseled convicted murderers alike," and who has suffered through the mur­der of her own brother, "The death penalty is not about justice, it is about revenge." 
As a Catholic community, we at Notre Dame must act in the interest of the vic­tims of violent crime, and join in a growing national discussion on shifting public funds from capital punishment to straightforward initiatives that care for the victims of violent crime and their survivors (including helping them to pay for funeral expenses or obtaining grief counseling). We must work toward developing possibilities of giving justice to communities impacted by murder without allowing emotion to become an accepted basis for the law. 
During this season of Lent, and espe­cially during Holy Week, we can consid­er the death penalty in another light, as we recall the execution of Jesus. As members of the Christian faith we follow a man who forgave his killers even as he neared his last breath; we have a responsibility to examine the modern death penalty and challenge the conven­tional wisdom regarding justice and revenge that are often used to support it. 
Andrea Laidman is a senior political science and peace studies major, and the Director ofNotre Dame Against State Killing (ND ASK), a campaign for a moratorium in Indiana. Her column's title recalls advice given to John Adams by his wife, Abigail: "We have too many high sounding words, and too few actions that correspond with them."

The group relies heavily on drum samples, loops and other forms of electronic programming to form the backbone of their esoteric sound. Beats are cen­tral here, but not in the mainstream hip-hop sense of making the most watered down, accessible sound possible. No, These New Puritans are more focussed on using percussive ell'ects and loops as a weapon, using them to beat you into submission. Everything else is secondary -vocals, guitar, bass and key­board all serving to baek up and complement the percussion. On "Infinity Ytinifni", there is no guitar or bass at all. just keyboard and huge, eehoing drums, with singer Jack Barnett's half-sung vocals floating over the song. The nearest sounding con-

temporary to the band is the similarly beat-intensive Battles. There aren't many post-punk outfits that sound like this or for that case, in all of music. 
The band has pop chops as well, and they reveal them on the surprisingly catchy single "Elvis". One line claims "what will happen next. we have no clues," succinctly summing up what it's like to listen to this album. Ilere, an ominous bassline leads into a verse with the paranoid exclamation that "we're 
"MKK3" is a quiet, brooding track that updates Joy Division's melan­choly for today's short attention span culture in less than two minutes. "Navigate-Colours" continues the Joy Division fixation before dissolving into looped vocals and beats that fade in and out. In fact, nearly all of the songs on Beat Pyramid offnr something of interest, with its seeming tug of war battle between conventional and oflbeat sound. You might not think that the idea of mixing late '70s post-punk with modern day electronic programming could sustain a full length album, but These New Puritans pull it off surprisingly well. Perhaps that can be attributed to brevity, by not allowing any­thing to repeat for a long enough time to get boring. The twelve songs on the record, not counting the four sub-30 second interludes, play for a mere 35 minutes. For the non-mathematically inclined, that works out to around three minutes per song. Songs 
zip by, making their point and ending. It's a direct method of song writing that serves the group well. 
These New Puritans have put forward an impressive effort with their debut album, challeng­ing the listener and pushing post-punk in new directions. Not content to merely rip ofl' their fore­bears, they borrow from other genres, melding everything together into one unique sound. There are moments where the bands that influence them shine through, but these are only for brief seconds. Each song is distinct, but overall the album has a cohesive sound, easily identifiable as the work of one group. If you're looking for something a little different than your normal fare, this would be a great place to start.

A cast of 35 characters including the likes of Sonic the Hedgehog and Solid Snake return to brawl on new stages with new moves. Being a lifelong Sega fan, I know how much o!' a disconnect it is to be playing as Sonic on a Nintendo console, but at least I can use the spiky blue blur to destroy Mario all I want. 
Nintendo has simplified the controls a little bit, allowing new players to jump in easily.

Besides that, they've added a richer single player game. While Melee attempted to have a single play­er adventure, it was weak and shallow. Brawl's sin­gle player game has much more depth and fun, but still pales in comparison to the times when you can play with three of your friends. After all, this was mean to be a multiplayer game. 
While I don't have Wii myself, I can walk down the hall and into any room and find people playing the game. Much like I did with Melee, I can definite­ly see myself buying a Wii just for this game. And I bet I'm not the only one. 
While admittedly fantastic multiplayer games like Halo, Rock Band, and Call of Duty 4 have stolen our hearts the past couple of years, we must remember to gather to praise and give thanks for the latest installment in the greatest multiplayer franchise that has ever existed. Let's brawl.

ago, Jeremy Hoenick wasn't 
totally sure his struggling San 
.lose Sharks would make the 
NIIL playoffs, even with all 
their talent, experience and 
depth. 
After the longest winning streak in franchise history, Hoeniek's only remaining question is whether the Sharks can ride this wave all thf~ way into June. 
San .lose's club-record 11­game roll ended Sunday night, but the 2-1 shootout loss to Edmonton still pro­duced the Sharks' 23rd point in 12 games. Led by a rejuve­nated captain, a new def'enseman and a tireless goalie, San Jose has replied to the doubters who saw the preseason Stanley Cup favorites' first 60 games as a disappointment -particular­ly the five before their win­ning run. 
"We had that five-game los­ing streak, and when you're in a playoff race and you get scared of actually missing the playoffs. it gets your atten­tion." said Roenick, recalling a miserable trip from New Jersey to Philadelphia right before the streak began. "Everything started going right at that time, and it just built on itself. It's an energy, and everybody thrives off it. We feel really confident right now. 

With 93 points, the Sharks (42-21-3-6) have leaped three points ahead of Anaheim and four in front of Dallas in the get, Wilson's typically detail­even better than San Jose He has six goals and three for Patty to get going, and he tight Pacific Division after oriented staff has posted a expected.

BLACKSBURG, Va. ­Like most major lea­guers, the New York Yankees don't get too excited about Grapefruit League games, especially when a bus trip is involved. 
Tuesday's spring train­ing road trip will be dif­ferent. 
Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and the Yankees will board a bus at their Tampa,. Fla., training complex to catch a flight to Virginia, then bus to Blacksburg for an exhibition game they all want to play. The Bronx Bombers vs. the Virginia Tech Hokies. 

"All the players are looking forward to it," Jeter said Monday. "The players that can't go want to. I'm sure it will be emotional, especially for the student body." 
It was 11 months ago this college town became the focus of a horrified nation after a gunman killed 32 people on cam­pus, and then himself. 
People around the world rallied behind Virginia Tech and the community, and the Yankees were among the organizations that offered overwhelming support, donating $1 million to the Hokie Spirit Memorial 
IN BRIEF Harmon to coach US men's 
tennis team in Beijing First Andy Roddick, now Patrick McEnroe. 
The United States' men's tennis team at the Beijing Olympics will be missing the top player and the cap­tain from the squad that ended the country's 12-year championship drought in the Davis Cup. 
McEnroe told the U.S. Tennis Association he did not want to return as Olympic tennis coach, a job he held at the 2004 Athens Games. Instead, Rodney Harmon will lead the American men in Beijing, pend­ing U.S. Olympic Committee approval. 
"I just felt like, I've been there, I was lucky enough to have the experi­ence," McEnroe said Monday in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. "I've been the cap­tain for eight years. It seemed like a good opportunity for someone else to have that experience." 

Fund and asking if they could come play a game. 
They'll do it Tuesday afternoon in a stadium packed with 3,000 stu­dents who won a lottery for tickets, 1,000 faculty and staff, and victims of last April 16th. 
Virginia Tech coach Peter Hughes still gets choked up when he thinks about that day, and the one coming. 
"Everywhere in life we've got guys that talk and guys that do things," the second-year Hokies coach said. "And when the Yankees call and say, 'Hey, we want to help out. We've got to do some­thing. Here's our idea: we 
Study questions results of 
growth hormone use 
NEW YORK -Athletes who take human growth hormone may not be getting the boost they expected. 
While growth hormone adds some muscle, it doesn't appear to improve strength or exercise capacity, according to a review of studies that tested the hormone in mostly athletic young men. 
"It doesn't look like it helps and there's a hint of evidence it may worsen athletic performance," said Dr. Hau Liu, of Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, Calif., who was lead author of the review. 
Growth hormone, or HGH, is among the performance enhancers baseball stars Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte were accused of tak­ing in the blockbuster Mitchell Report. Clemens denies using the hormone, while Pettitte admits using it. 
want to come play and here's a million dollars.' How proactive is that? It blows you away, their generosity." 
The Yankees have their own history with massive tragedy, playing in the same city where the attacks on the World Trade Towers claimed thousands of lives on Sept. 11, 2001. 
"I really had a new appreciation for life after that," Jeter said. "I think it brings attention to how precious life is. You real­ize it's going to be a spe­cial trip and you can't take anything for grant· ed. This really puts things in perspective." 

Indiana forms committee to 
search for new head coach 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -While Indiana prepares for its first-round game in the NCAA tournament. the school said Monday that a former trustee will lead a 1O-member commit­tee to search for a replacement for dis­graced coach Kelvin Sampson. 
The head job became vacant last month when Sampson resigned amid allegations of NCAA violations. Dan Dakich, an assistant under Sampson and a former Indiana player and assis­tant under Bob Knight, took over as interim coach for the rest of the sea­son. 
Harry Gonso, a former Indiana quar· terback and attorney, will lead the search committee, which includes ath· letic director Rick Greenspan and for­mer Hoosier player Wayne Radford. 
No timetable for the selection was 
. announced, and Gonso said committee members would not comment publicly on progress until a decision is made.

PGA 

Woods looks to maintain perfect 2008 in Florida Swing 
Associated Press 
I>OHAL -The outcome has never been more inevitable. Tiger Woods has never looked so invincible. 
The world's No. I golfer faced a 25-foot birdie putt on the final hole at Bay llill, and the moment he settled over the ball and the crowd grew quiet, it no longer mattered that Woods had not made a putt this long all week. 
This one was for the win. 
For most players, making such a dutch putt would be a can~or highlight. For Woods, it's more like a summer rerun. 
"You know what he's going to do, right'?" Arnold Palmer whispered to those around him right before Woods rapped his putt down the slope and watched it turn sharply to the right and tumble into the cup for a one-shot victory. 
For Woods, it is the ultimate thrill. 
"It's knowing that you have an opportunity to end the tour­nament, and it's in your hands," he said. "Whether you do it or not remains to be seen. It's like having the ball with a few seconds to go. Do you want it or not want it'? I would much rather have it in my hands." 
Lately, it has been nothing but net. 
The Florida Swing long has been known as the road to the Masters, which is three weeks away. Woods already has his game at warp speed, and he's lapping the field. His victory Sunday in the Arnold Palmer Invitational was his fifth in a row on the PGA Tour and his sixth straight worldwide, a streak that spans six months and is the longest overall of his incomparable career. When he won seven straight tour events in 2006-2007, second only to Byron Nelson's 11 in 1945, Woods lost three times over­seas. 
Now, even the purists must wonder if Woods can go an entire season without losing. 
"It's unbelievable, isn't it'?" Steve Stricker said Monday. "You think that one of these times, he's not going to get it done. But he continues to do it. And now you expect it. You just learn with him that nothing is unexpected." 
Woods' latest victim was Bart Bryant, who did everything right and never felt so helpless. 
Bryant twice made birdie to tie Woods for the lead, shot a 6 7 in stifling heat and waited in the scoring trailer to see if Woods could beat him. There was no television in the trailer, and Bryant didn't need one. 
He heard a roar that rattled the trailer, and Bryant forced a smile and slowly shook his head. 
"That's why he's Tiger Woods," he said. 
Stricker felt that way outside Chicago the second week in September, when this winning streak started. He had a one­shot lead in the final round when he got to the 12th hole, looked down toward the green and saw Woods make a 50-foot birdie putt to catch him. Woods went on to a two-shot victory. 


He can sympathize with Bryant. 
"That's all you can do some­times is shake your head and laugh," Stricker said. "That's what it's getting to be -laugh­able." 
Golf is more global than it was a half-century ago, so Woods' win­ning streak is complicated. This is the third time he has won at least five in a row, and he also won on the European Tour last month, shooting a 31 on the back nine to rally from a four-shot deficit. 

And he won the Target World Challenge in December, although that doesn't count because it was a charity event that Woods hosts for 16 top players from the world ranking. For what it's worth, Woods won by seven shots. 
Woods is so dominant that he has won seven of his last eight times on the PGA Tour, the excep­tion being a runner-up finish to Phil Mickelson at the Deutsche Bank Championship on Labor Day. He's an incredible 16 for 25 since the 2006 British Open. 
"What he's doing now, you can't even fathom it," Bryant said. "You just can't explain it. It's just incredible. Just what he did today is more evidence of this weird zone he's in. And he's been in it his whole life."

EU, Australia oppose boycott of Beijing Games over Tibet 
Associated Press 
BIWO I' HI KI{AN.JU, Slovenia-Amid ns<:alating violnnc<' in and around Tibet, tho nwssagn from around the world was dear: "l.nt. th1~ games bngin." 
l·:uropnan nations and Olympir. rommittnns said Monday Llwy opposed a boywtt of tlw Beijing Camns over China's handling of tlw unnst in Tilwt. And most Pvcryorw nlsn who spoke out. from Hussia to tlw Unit('() StatPs to Australia, nrhond that approach. 
"UndPr no ,·irrumstancP will wn support tlw boycott. Wn are I00 pPrrPnt unanimous," Patrick llirkPy, tlw lwad of tlw l~uropnan Olympir Committnns, told Tlw AssoriatPd l'wss. 
Tlw HJ sports ministers and Olympil" rommittPPS said sports should not Ill' linkPd to surh a political issuP and that prPvious Olympic boyrotls had limited impart. 
"Not one world leader has rom<· out with tlw suggestion of a boycott and no loss a pnrson than tlw Dalai Lama" is against it. llickny said. "A boycott is only a punishnunt of thn ath­ldcs." · 
Slownn Sports Ministnr Milan Zvnr. who is chairing a mnnting of top I~U sports ol'lkials from tlw 27 nwmbnr statns and Olympic committ<~ns, said it was no dil'l'nnmt on tlw govPrnnwnt sidn. "I am against a boycott of thn Olympic (;anws in China." Zvnr said. 
Christiane Hohmann. a spokeswoman tiJr the EU's exne­utivn commission. said "such a boycott would not bo thn appro­priate way" to voien concerns of human rights or rights of those in Tibnt. 
World 50-meter butterl'ly champion Holand Schoeman, hownver. supports ealls for the IOC to take a stand. · 
The IOC "should stand up and say, 'Tho way thcsP people are being trnated is not aecept­abln, "' thn South African swim­mnr said. "Either you put an nnd to this or else. The 'or else' could lw extrnme or it could be a snt of conditions." 
From its Colorado headquar­ters, the U.S. Olympic Committnn witnrated its stance that an American boycott is out of the qunstion. 
"Put tognthnr a ranking of the worst idPas ever conceivnd and 'Oiym pic boycott' would bo at the top of that lisi." USOC spokesman Darryl Seibnl said. "Otlwr than unnoe<~ssarily and unfairly punishing athletes. Olympic boycotts accomplish absolutP!y nothing." 
Bussia warnnd against turn­ing tlw lkijing Olympics into a political ganw. 
"Wp would like to underscore that nfTorts to politicize the holding of tlw 200S Sum mnr Olympi!' Camns in China arn unaeceptablo," thn govornment said. 
Added Australian Foreign Minister Stophon Smith: "I very strongly belirwe that we should not in any way bring the Olympics or call the Olympies into question." 
Erica Terpstra, the head of the Dutch Olympic Committee, said it is wrong to burden sports with such problems, and "it really has to be for the politi­cians." 
"There was no call for a boy­cott whatsoever, even though there is great concern about what happens there," Terpstra addnd. "And I have an addition-to do our sport and not get' involved as a tool for politics." 


Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates contends that a boycott would only harm the athletes. 
"It is not the role of the IOC to take the lead in addressing such issues as human rights or politi­cal matters, which are most appropriately addressed by gov­ernments or concerned organi­zations," Coates said. 
On Monday, Tibet's governor promised leniency to anti­Chinese protesters who turned themselves in before the end of the day, as troops fanned out to quell sympathy protests that have spread to three neighbor­ing provinces. 
The fiercest protests against Chinese rule in almost two decades have embarrassed China's communist government and hurt its efforts to have a smooth run-up to the Aug. 8-24 Olympics. 
Europe has never questioned th<~ right for tho Chinese to stage tlw games. On Friday, a summit of' EU leaders critieized China's response to demonstrations in Tibet but did not threaten a boy­cott on human rights grounds. 
Togay Bayatli, prnsident of the Turkish Olympic Committen, strossed it was up to business leaders and politicians to take the initiative. 
"Our countries aro doing busi­ness there," Bayatli said. "Everybody is going thore." 
Economic relations between the 27 -nation EU and China are moving closer. Bilateral trade doubled between 2000-05 and reached $370 billion in 2006. Europe is China's largest export market and China is Europe's prime source of imports. 
Zver has argued that political pressure through sports doesn't work, saying the boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games was large­ly ineffectual at a political level. At the same time, it badly hurt the Olympic movement.

That idea was echoed by Claudia Bokel. head of the ath­lete's commission of the European Olympic Committees.

Howard leads Magic past Cavaliers with 23 
Jefferson has double-double in Timberwolves win; Grizzlies snap four-game skid; Bibby drops 23 on Wizards 
then extended it to 16 in the fourth when Miller hit a 3-point­er and followed it with a spin­ning layup with just under 7 minutes to play. 
Memphis eventually pushed its advantage to 21 points down the stretch and sent the Bobcats to their fourth straight loss, and further hurting Charlotte's chances of reaching the eighth spot for the Easter Conference playoffs. 
Charlotte missed all five of their shots outside the arc in the second half, while Memphis con­trolled the middle with a 56-32 advantage in the paint and out­rebounded the Bobcats 49-42. 
Charlotte led 47-42 at the break. 
Memphis shot poorly to start the game, missing seven of its first eight shots. There were dunks blocked and layups missed by the Grizzlies, which con­tributed to Memphis hitting only about a third of its shots before finishing at 38 percent in the half -including shooting just 1-for-7 on 3s. 
Also, the Grizzlies were 5-for­12 from the line in the half. 
Initially, the Bobcats couldn't capitalize on Memphis' poor shooting, allowing the Grizzlies to cut into an early lead. However, Charlotte maintained the advantage through the half, building it to 14, while shooting better than 50 percent until the final 2 minutes of the half. 
Associated Press 
The Orlando Magic found their shooting touch beyond 23 feet. 
Hashard Lewis made three of five 3-pointers in scoring 21 points, Dwight Howard had 23 points and 13 rebounds and the Orlando Magic beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 104-90 Monday night. 
Orlando shot better from 3­point range (43.8 percent) than it did overall (39.5 percent). The Magic won despite getting outscored 22-3 on fastbreak points and 46-34 in the paint. 
"The main focus is to get the ball inside to Dwight," Lewis said. "Obviously he demands so much attention and they can't guard him 1-on-1. They try to clog the paint and _they leave us wide open out on the wing, so we take what they give us." 
LeBron James had 30 points, nim1 rebounds and six assists for Cleveland. Delonte West had 16 points and Sasha Pavlovic added 14. 
Cleveland must have known it wasn't their night when Jameer Nelson. who was 2-for-12 from the field, sank Orlando's 14th 3­pointer on its 32nd attempt. It rimmed out, then bounced off the baekboard and in with 2:30 left. 
"They made shots that they didn't make in the first half," James said. They are a team that shoots the ball very well. They

hit a lot of 3-pointers, and when they do that it is tough to come back. We just never recovered from that." 
Redo Turkoglu had 18 points and seven rebounds and Maurice Evans had 10 points for Orlando. Nelson had seven assists but only six points. 
Cleveland led 45-40 at half­time, and by as many as 10 in the third quarter before Orlando made a run. Evans, Turkoglu and Lewis each hit consecutive 3-pointers and Nelson capped it with a 3-point play to give the Magic a 73-72 lead at the end of the third quarter. 
"We had to change our eover­age and they still hit a couple on us," Cleveland coach Mike Brown said. 
James nearly kept Cleveland in the game by himself in the fourth, scoring seven of its first nine points. Four of them were on seemingly effortless dunks. 
But the Cavaliers went more than four minutes without a bucket, missing three straight free throws (one from James and two from Zydrunas Ilgauskas). 
Turkoglu sealed the win with a 3-pointer to put the Magie ahead 89-81 with 5:35left. 
Timberwolves 99, Clippers 90 
Al Jefferson had his 48th dou­ble-double with 22 points and 14 rebounds, Ryan Gomes seored 19 points and the Minnesota Timberwolves beat the Los Angeles Clippers Monday night. 
Minnesota won for the fourth time in six games and moved past Seattle into fourth place in the Northwest Division. Jefferson trails only Orlando's Dwight Howard, who recorded his 60th double-double Monday, among NBA leaders in that category. 
Corey Maggette had 34 points for Los Angeles, which concluded a five-game road trip by losing its fourth straight. Tim Thomas added 22 points. 
Minnesota went on a 13-4 run early in the fourth quarter to take an 81-70 lead. Craig Smith had three quick points to open the period, Rashad McCants hit a 3-pointer and a long jumper before Kirk Snyder made two long-range jumpers. 
McCants scored 16 points, Snyder 14 and Smith 11 for the Timberwolves. Marko Jaric had 10 assists. 
A 3-pointer by Maggette pulled Los Angeles to 95-88 with 2:33 to play, but the Clippers could get no closer. 
Maggette, who also scored 34 points Saturday in Washington, has scored at least 30 points seven times this year. This was the second time in six weeks, and fifth time in his career, that Maggette had back-to-hack games with 30-plus points. 
But he and Thomas got little help, especially with C Chris Kaman missing his fifth straight game with a lower back injury.

Nadal, Blake claim victory 
Davenport, Ivanovic dominate women's Pacific Life Open play 
Associated Press 
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. ­Defending champion Rafael Nadal defeated Donald Young in their first meeting, and James Blake evened his record against familiar foe Carlos Moya in third-round matches Monday at the Paeilic Life Open. 
Nadal beat his 18-year-old American opponent 6-1, 6-3. Blah took a methodical 6-3, 6-4 victory over Moya. 
Two-time women's title win­ner Lindsay Davenport bounced back from a second­set loss to defeat Chan Yung­Jan 6-4, 5-7. 6-2. Ana Ivanovic, ranked No. 2 and the top seed since Justine Henin is skipping the tourna­ment, advanced with a 6-3, 6­0 win over Tathiana Garbin. 
The 21-year-old Nadal, sec­ond in the rankings to Roger Federer, benefited from Young's inconsistency. 
Although he was able to match Nadal stroke-for­stroke in some rallies and also hit several hard winners that brought roars from the crowd, Young's inexperience was evident at other times. 
After hitting a routine fore­hand out to end a long rally in the second set, Young slammed his racket to the ground in frustration. 
Soon after, he banged an overhead volley into the net, shaking his head at missing the easy shot. 
Young won just seven of 17 points when he went to the net and Nada! was 6-of-7. Young made 38 unforced errors, 13 more than his Spanish opponent. 
Although just some three ynars older than Young, thren-time French Open 
champion Nadal obviously has a huge edge in experi­ence. 
"Well, I think he's young," Nadal said, describing how the match went. "I think he started very nervous. So I tried to score in the begin­ning, and he had some mis­takes." 
Young agreed. 
"Obviously I was really nervous," he said. "It's not the first time I played in front of a lot of people, but it's the first time I played No. 2 in the world." 
Asked if his nerves had calmed down by the second set, Young said, "Yeah, losing 6-1, I think they go away. But overall, it was pretty decent." 
Young had scored the biggest victory of his career two days earlier at Indian 
Wells, beating No. 32 Feliciano Lopez in three sets. 
The 28-year-old Blake, at No. 9 the highest-ranking 
U.S. player remaining in the tournament since No. 6 Andy Roddick was eliminated a day earlier, won for the sixth time in 12 career meetings against Moya, the former No. 1 now ranked 19th. 
"We know each other's games really well," Blake said. "I've had a lot of tough matches with him. So I was really happy with getting through it in two sets, and either way, just getting the win was something I was proud of." 
Moya, a 31-year-old from Spain, had been the oldest player left in the men's side of the tournament.

Irish guard Charel Allen, who lost at Purdue her sophomore year during the NCAA Tournament and during the regular season (65-54 on Dec. 7, 2005), said she feels more confident winning there than before.

success at Mackey Arena, it still pres­ents a clear advantage for the Irish. 
They have a very winnable first two games (against No. 12 Southern Methodist and possi­bly No. 4 Oklahoma) before a likely showdown with Tennessee -the top-seed in the region. 
And the location seems ideal. Instead of being shuttled off to Des Moines, Iowa, or Albuquerque, N .M. -two places not known as bastions of Notre Dame women's bas­ketball fans -the Irish are 
playing instate where South Benders can easily support their team in person. 
When they first heard the bracket pairings on ESPN's selection show, Irish coach Muffet McGraw and her play­ers unanimously said they were glad to be close to home because of the support their fans can give. 
"Our fans are great at the home games and I feel they will make the trip to Purdue and that will be so helpful for us," Irish

Notre Dame got lucky this time.

And even with the bad karma they have in the Mackey Arena, the Irish look poised to keep dancing for at least a few more games.

Weather postpones game 
By LORENZO REYES and FRAN TOLAN Sports Writers 
Back when Notre Dame head coach Dave Schrage spoke at the seventh-annual Opening Night Dinner in February, he spoke of Monday's Opening Day game against Central Michigan as a day that would hopefully be filled with warmth, sun, green grass and most importantly for Irish fans -baseball. 
Unfortunately for all those in attendance, there was only one of these things present at Frank Eck Stadium for the St. Patrick's Day opener -and even that was in short supply. Due to inclement and wintry weather, action was suspended in the middle of the sixth inning with the Chippewas up 3-2 and the bases loaded and two outs. 
A make-up date of May 12 has been announced, but both squads are still awaiting word for the procedure of the restart of the game. 
Several make-up scenarios are on the table. Either the action will be called as a 2-2 tie or the game could be postponed to be completed at the point of the last full inning (also a 2-2 tie) May 12. 
The Irish bats seemed poised to break open the contest and give freshman starting pitcher Brian Dupra the early run support nec­essary to pull otf a victory when senior Brett Lilley ripped a dou­ble past the Chippewa first base­man. Sophomore David Mills then followed with a sacrifice bunt that pushed Lilley to third base. A.J. Pollock then singled up the middle to score Lilley and put Notnl Dame up 1-0. 
Junior first baseman Evan Sharpley's fielder's choice moved Pollock into scoring position, allowing classmate Jeremy Barnes to bring home Pollock,

Zamler, and their No. 2 sin­gles, sophomore Michelle Mulder. Both Zamler and Mulder are strong top players for the Brits this season, each going 3-2. The real threat is when they join forees to beeome Albion's No.1 doubles team, going 4-1 this season. Their next challenge will most likely be Saint Mary's No. 1 doubles of Gebert-Hurley. 
"Winning our doubles will give us an advantage," Gebert said. "We need to start off strong in each match, and keep the intensity up through­out. We have a very good chance at beating them, so long as we play to our poten­tial." 
The Belles travel to Albion today to take on the Brits in their conference opener at 3 p.m. 
"Our matches are all going to be tight, so we must stay positive," Gebert said. "Giving up will not bn an option. I beli1we we will rise to the occa­sion."

giving the Irish a two-run advan­tage. 
Central Michigan would not go away quietly, and followed with a pair of runs of its own in the next inning, nullifying the lead. In a frustrating series of events for Notre Dame, it Central Michigan used infield singles to chip away at Notre Dame's lead. With two runners aboard, Chippewa senior Noah Lankford'a one-out, two­run double knotted the game at two. Dupra promptly retired the next two batters, leaving Lankford stranded. 
Dupra ran into some trouble, but managed to escape without any earned runs until the sixth frame, when he hit senior Jeff Helps with a pitch with the bags juiced bring one in. The ominous clouds began to break open, causing the umpires to suspend the game. 
The Irish will return to the dia­mond tomorrow when they face Xavier at the Frank Eck Stadium at 5 p.m. Freshman Hyan Sharpley will take the mound against the Musketeers in search of his first win of the season. 
Today the Irish were trying to build off of a successful weekend where they won 2 of 3 games. 
Notre Dame was poised to sweep il<> three games in the Irish Baseball Classic in San Antonio this weekend before squandering a seven-run lead against Texas­Pan American Sunday. The Irish beat Buffalo 13-1 Friday and shut out Southern Illinois 4-0 Saturday before falling to Texas­Pan American 10-8. With a 2-1 record for the weekend, Notre Dame improved to 7-7 on the season. 
Junior right-hander David Phelps surrendered just one run on four hits in seven innings of work to pick up his second win of the season against Buffalo. 
The Irish oll'ense gave Phelps plenty of breatlling room, rncord-

ing 12 hil<> in the rout. Fmshman third baseman Greg Sherry led the balanced Irish attack, going 3-for-3 with three runs scored. Sophomore designated hitter David Mills went 2-for-2 with two HBis. Sophomore hurler Steven Mazur and freshman Cole !Judson each tossed a scoreless inning to close out the victory. Senior Wade Korpi, senior Tony Langford and junior Kyle Weiland kept the Salukis at bay as junior second baseman Jeremy Barnes led the Irish to a 4-0 over Southern Illinoi.<;. Barnes pounded out three hil'>, inducting a seventh inning solo home run to put the game out of reach. Korpi and Langford eombined to load the bases in the seventh but Langford struck out the final two Salukis batters of the frame to preserve the lead for Notre Dame. Langford worked a per­fect eight inning and Wei! and closed out the contest. Sophomore centerfielder A.J Pollock went 2-for-4 with a run scored in the win. 
The Broncos ended Irish hopes for a perfect weekend, scoring runs in the seventh inning to come from behind and notch the win. The Irish took a big lead after scoring six runs in the fifth inning. Hoss Brezovsky led off the frame with a home run and the Irish continued to roll, knocking out seven hits before being retired. But Texas-Pan American dawed back, plating six runs of its own in the seventh to cut Notre Dame's edge to 7-6. The Broncos completed their come­back with three runs off of Mazur and Johnson in the eight inning. Johnson took the loss for the Irish in his first deci.<>ion of the season. Barnes went 2-for-4 with an HBI in the losing ell'orL

NO WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
McGraw sends team to NCAA tourney again 
By BILL BRINK 
Sports Wrirer 
Notre Dame will hit the danec lloor for the 13th eon­seeutive year. 
The Irish (23-H) earned a No. 5 send and will play Southern Mflthodist Univf'rsity Sunday at 2::W p.m. in West Lafayette, Ind. 
Last season. the Irish me1~ived a No. 9 seed and lost in tlw seeond round, 60-51 to No. I sP-ed North Carolina after beating No.H seed California 62-59. 
Notre Dame is 23-13 all-time in tlw tournament and won the national ehampionship in 2001. 
The end of tlw season was not kind to the Irish. They 

-droppNI their last two games, including their first-round Big East tournament game -a 64­5:~ loss to Pittsburgh. Notre Dame raced to a 14-2 lead, but went H-for-27 in the half and was up only one at the break. Pittsburgh reboundnd from shooting 25 percent in the first half to hit 14 of their 32 see­ond-half shots, induding three 3-pointers to put it ahead for good. "We want to get away from that Itwo game losing strnakl and start a new streak and get busy at praetien," Irish coach MutTnt M<~Graw said. Tlw Mustangs (24-H) amassed the most wins in pro­gram history this season. They beat Texas-El Paso Sunday, 73­

Coach prepared for tough game at Mackey 
Just because Notre Dame is playing in familiar territory does­n't mean that it is eomfortable there. 
The Irish drew the 5-12 game in the Oklahoma City regional, a game that will be played at Mackey Arena in West Lafayette, Ind., on Purdue's eampus. 
At first glanee, this home-state advantage sounds like a huge boon for the Irish. 
But more important than the game being in Indiana, it is being held in Mackey Arena -where the Irish have 

s t r u g g I e d Jay Fitzpatrick mightily in the past. 
Before this Sports Writer season, Notre Dame was winless at Mackey in eight tries, including a previous trip in the NCAA Tournament. The Irish lost 78-61 in the first round of the big dance in West Lafayette two years ago against Boston College, when then-freshman guard Lindsay Schrader netted a career-high 29 points. 
The Irish did get their first win in Purdue this season, a 61-48 victory on Dec. 8. MufTet Mr.Graw said she was happy to get that lirst win in Maekey Arena just to know slw ean go down there and win.

Last Saturday, the Belles went up against the Division II Indiana Wesleyan Wildcats, losing 6-3 and falling to 4-4.

Irish head to Kalamazoo 
By SAM WERNER Spons Writer 
After competing in tourna­ments in Arizona, Florida, California, and South Carolina over the past month, Notre Dame will head to Kalamazoo, Mich., to take on Western Michigan University. 
Irish coach Deanna Gumpf hopes that the switch to a colder climate will do noth­ing to cool off her team's red hot hitting. The Irish scored 46 runs in five games at last weekend's Lowcountry Invitational in Charleston, S.C., including a 16-2 thrashing of Charleston Southern. 
"We've gotten better offen­sively and that showed this past weekend," Gumpf said. "We hit the ball much bet­ter."
