Hesburgh invites Ford to campus 
White House answer by tomorrow: purpose of visit undisclosed 

by Tom Drape Editor-in-Chief 
President Gerald R. Ford has been in­vited to appear at Notre Dame on Monday, March 17 by Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh, University President. White House sources said yesterday that an acceptance or refusal would be announced by tomorrow morning. 
A personal letter of invitation from Hesburgh was delivered to Ford while the Notre Dame president was in Washington, D.C.last week, according to a White House spokesman. Both the White House and Hesburgh have refused comment on the purpose of the visit until Ford's personal confirmation is released. 
Rumors about Hesburgh possibly leaving the University to accept a possible Ford appointment were, however, squelched yesterday by Richard Condlin, director of Information Services. 
"If the President does accept the in­
vitation to visit Notre Dame, this would not 
indicate any change in office by Fr. 
Hesburgh or any other officer of the 
University," Conklin said. 
Conklin confirmed that an advance team 
from the White House was on campus last 
week checking the physical facilities. A 
tentative schedule was also discussed with 
a group of ten administrators. He declined 
to identify the administrators involved in 
the planning until definite plans are an­
nounced. 
According to the tentative schedule of 

events discussed, Conklin said, Ford would 
be on campus for one day only. He would 
not speculate on the 'schedule of events' or 
possible locations of events any further 
than saying the University would be in­
volved in some of them. 
"At this point, everyone is under the 
same information embargo that I am," 
Conklin said. 
Joseph Sassano, assistant director of the 
Athletic and Convocation Center, said 
yesterday that according to the schedule 
the main arena has not yet been reserved. 
If the visit is confirmed, Ford's St. ·Patrick's Day appearance at Notre Dame 
would be the third made by a U.S. 
president while in office. Franklin D. 
Roosevelt came to campus on Dec. 9, 1935 
for a special convocation on Filipino In­
dependence In June, 1960, Dwight 
Eisenhower came to campus for 
graduation ceremonies. 
President Ford would be the fourth man 
who has served as President that Fr. 
Hesburgh has personally welcomed to the 
campus during his 23-year tenure. Besides 
Eisenhower's visit, Hesburgh presented to 
both John Kennedy and Richard Nixon the 
University's Patriot of the Year award. 
Kennedy received the award in 1956 and 
Nixon in 1960. 
Kennedy had intended to visit Notre 
Dame during his term for a football game. 
His appearance was cancelled due to the 
eruption of the Cuban Missile Crisis that 
weekend.

Lack of quorum stops SLC committee action 
By Virginia McGowan Starr Reporter 
A proposal to decrease the size of the SLC to five members each from the student body, the faculty, and the ad­ministration was presented at the SLC meeting yesterday afternoon by Dennis Sullivan, chairperson of the committee on the future of the council. 
The SLC was unable to vote on the committee recommendations for lack of a quorum. A straw vote of those present showed ten in favor of no change, seven in favor of a decrese in size, and one ab­stention. 
Based on a proposal by Frank Flanagan, SLC chairman, the committee had previously discussed five alternatives regarding the size of the Council before reaching a compromise with the 5-5-5 devision. 
"On the surface the Council may appear as a concerned and attentive group," stated Flanagan in his report to the committee, "but this is hardly the case when you consider there are emembers 
who  have  missed  eight  of  eleven  
meetings.''  
He  cited  poor  attendance  and  a  

lackadaisical attitude demonstrated by some members as resulting in disillusionment of the Council as a whole. 
According to Flanagan, "If changes aren't made now then the Council might as well die." Flanagan theorized that a decrease in size from the present 24 members to 15 would "make it a lot easier to work as a smaller group and enable more non-SLC participants to make suggestions." 
"For example, today everyone knew this was an important meeting and yet we failed to have a quorum," asserted Flanagan, "which speaks in favor of decreasing the number of members." 
In response to a suggestion that the SLC dismiss the chronic absentees and appoint new SLC members, Flanagan retorted that they had had a hard enough time getting students to run in the first place, and replacements were apt to be in even scarcer supply. He stressed that the decrease in size would be accompanied by an increase in highly-motivated members. 
Sullivan also advocated the proposed decrease, stating, "the proosal itself gives diversity and is also more efficient than the present number." He added, "I think it would increase the effect of the SLC and give the new life that is needed right now." 
Counter-arguementswere based on the premise that reduction in the Council size would limite the variety of views offered by more members. 
"I voted for not changing on the basis that the present policy gives a wider representation of the campus," said Paul Conway. finance professor. 
"With more people there's a greater diversity of opinion," he continued, "while in the smaller group you'll get greater power." 
In .ND-SMC teams 
Other committee recommendations met with a minimum of discussion or debate. The SLC opened with a clarification of its statement of purpose, which reaffirms its legislative duty to establish rules gover­ning student life and provide for their enforcement a judicial system which protects student rights. 
Fr. Carl Ebey, Fisher Hall rector and Internal Auditor, who vetoed for no change , did not think any valid arguments were presented that would justify a decrease. 
Committee recommendations continued with a suggestion that the SLC Steering · Committee become more active by identifying and then assigning vital issues affecting student life to appropriate committees. 
SLC Standing Committees were strongly encouraged to rpomote participation by non-SLC members in the future. 
The Commitee advised the selection of a parliamentarian in order to conduct SLC meetings according to parliamentary procedure. 
It was also noted that, since SLC bylaws have not been changed since 1968, any change in the SLC should be reflected in the bylaws. 



Women's sports growing apart 
by Christie Herlihy 
Staff Reporter 

Women's opportunities in sports are increasing and, as new programs are considered, the Notre Dame and St. Mary's sports departments lean towards developing them separately. 
Dominick Napolitano, director of non­varsity sports at Notre Dame, commented that at the last meeting of the Athletic Department and Board of Directors it was decided to permit the sharing of certain women club sports since St. Mary's students were already on the teams. "We decided for the time being and for next year to allow them to operate in ajoint capacity," he stated. 
Women's intercollegiate tennis, golf, and basketball porgrams are offered by both schools and will remain separate. Napolitano added that any new additions to the ND women's sports program will be restricted to ND students while sailing, skiing, fencing, and crew will reamin open to both campuses. 
"Right now the clubs are not talking about varsity," Napolitano said, "but eventually when they achieve the necessary quality, and of course such standards will have to be set, women's varsity teams will become a reality," he added. 

Varsity sports Cltffer from club status in the amount of financial support given by the university, the provision for a coach, and in the keenness of the intercollegiate competition. 
Napolitano cited the lack of facilities as the main reason why St. Mary's and Notre Dame have joined in certain club sports. Sailing and crew equipment are providec by Notre Dame while the fencing team uses the ACC. 
St. Mary's offers six club sports which it terms "varsity": golf, basketball, gymnastics, tennis, fencing, and swim­ming. Asked if Notre Dame women may participate on St. Mary's "varsity" teams or intra-murals, Wernig replied, "I'm waiting for a statement which will be issued jointly from the Notre Dame and St. Mary's sports departments in two weeks." 
She added that currently Notre Dame women are welcomed to enter any St. Mary's sports programs which are not offered on the ND campus. 
Notre Dame donates $700 to the treasury of each of the sports clubs while St. Mary's contributes proportionally to the number of its participants on Nore Dame teams. "St. Mary's contril:>utes from $100-$150 towards the minor trips of the joint clubs. They have done it this year and in the past and will continue in the future," Napolitano said. 
While St. Mary's looks forward to 
developing a sports program in its new 
gym, Notre Dame is concentrating on 
improving communication with itw own 
female contingency.

P.O. Box Q 
Rating The Ratings 

Dear Editor: 
The incident of rating women in the dining hall seems to be a reflection of the general chauvinistic attitude many Notre Dame men display toward women. 
The immaturity in this matter lies not with the women who were upset by it, but rather with the boys who dreamnt up this "practical joke." This is the kind of thing one could expect in a 4th grade lunch room, where the main concern of the children is not to catch the opposite sex's Kutee germs. If the boys who played this "practical joke" would like to practice writing the number 1-6, or drawing joke cards, I'm sure the "Happy Day Care Center," would be glad to educate them with the rest of the 3 and 4 year olds. Just imagine them sitting there flashing their cards, and having a gay old time with the kids, rather than disturbing and insulting their peers. 
Many people are very sensitive to other people's reactions to themselves, and are hurt by a negative response, regardless of whether it was intended as a joke or not. The practical joke played in the dining hall is on the level of telling Helen Keller jokes to a person who is both blind and deaf. You may think the joke is funny, IJut how funny is it to someone who can neither hear nor see? 
It is not up to the boys who played this "joke" to decide whether other people should take it seriously or not. People are en­titled to respect and if you cannot respect other people's feelings, then you do not belong near people, and should become a recluse. 
Some jokes are funny and some are not. This one was definitely not funny. 
Sincerely, Marirose Lescher 

Dear Editor: 
When does the joking end and a comprehension of the cold hard reality begin? I appreciate the fact thatthe "rating contest" which took place at the South Dining Hall on Feb. 27 was not in itself meant to demean the women of Notre Dame. But this event only further reinforces the generally accepted rating system that women have been reduced to for centuries. To be reminded of this fact over dinner is not much less than nauseating. 
DOONESBURY 
More people are becoming aware of the position of women in society. But a woman's way is by no means paved. Unless women do stand up like the few Notre Dame women and refuse to besubjected to this treatment these practices and the ideals that go with them will not change. To call this initiative immature is a shallow analysis of the situation. It is encouraging that the University did take action. The fact that the students did not recognize this insolence is not so reassuring. 
I am a St. Mary's student so I cannot fully appreciate the male­female situation at Notre Dame. But being female _ I know first hand that it is hard to 

laugh  when  one  is  not  being  
tickled.  
Sincerely,  

Rosemary Gill 
Bizarre Microcosm 

Dear Editor: 
Besides Notre Dame University, the letters "NDU" could ap­propriately stand for Negro Diversification Union. 
Negro ("knee-grow") because a considerable number of black students attending this university appear to prefer an identity somewhat less related to the "common" Afro-American. 
Diversification because it seems to be an express purpose of this university to induce indifference among black students. Almost unbelievable is that of all 126 black students our origination can be from such conflicting social confines. A few of us are poor, a few wealthy, a few middle class, a few of us come from "lily-white" number one high schools others from all black, a few of us are athletes a few scholars. A few of ourfamiliesconditioned us to retain and revive black traditions others promoted imitation of and assimilation with whites stifling social contact with other blacks. 
llnion becauseit'snecessary that university administrators condone this diversification and deprivation; without active sup­port this collage could not exist. In a cognizant effort to avoid con­frontation the university has created a bizarre microcosm 
diverting black's responses to frustration toward each instead of toward the actual perpetrator.

student we are getting now (at N.D.) is less concerned with the black movement and a separatist philosophy." Fr. Schlaver placed partial blame for the decline in use of the Black Cultural Arts Center on this "change" in black students. 
Ironically this article was printed in the Observer Insight section. If the article lacked anything it lacked insight. Most obvious was its blatant negligence to mention the fact that black students don't just attend Notre Dame; we are processed, screened, chosen, St'lected 1 If there has been any change its been in the type of blac~ student allowed to attend Notre Dame. 
In this selection of black students we have been homogenized for one characteristic. We all exhibit a blemishless "good kid" record. We are in a predicament where people say "you can ask anyone, he's a hell-uv-a-good guy." 
Observer Insight also failed to observe or sight that there are now fewer blacks at Notre Dame to utilize the Cultural Arts Center not to mention a greater percentage living ofh~ampus.

Election Lamentation 

Dear Editor: 
Once again, the debacle known as "SBP-SBVP" elections is over. One can only thank God for that. And ,once again-as has been their custom in three of my four years here-the student body has made the wrong choke. 
After being a witness to the conceited, supercilious and even pompous manner of our SBP~lect, I can only wish him and the Student Body good luck. I'm sure that Burtchaell, the Board of Trustees, and whoever else he has to deal with will be quite impressed by it. When something im­portant-like a calendar con­troversy-arises, I hope that when his position is assailed or even mildly questioned that he can put his facial muscles to work as well as he did during his Keenan debate, showing by the mature manner in which he grimaces that, if nothing else, he is a serious contender for the Emmet Kelly look alike contest-thus adding to the administration belief that Student Government is en­tertaining but incompetent and ineffective. 
Sincerely, Dennis J. Dziemiznowicz

Spring In Angers 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiipet e r h. k a r t h 
Friends, lovers, and assorted strangers at Notre Dame· we are coming. At last the word is out. Some of us will begin the iong sail home on June 19; others, more impatient, will fly to you on June 10. Of course, the most of you won't s~ us before September, anyways, but at least you can breathe a sigh of relief and know· we are coming. ' 
We never dreamt that it would come this soon nor this fast. S_pring has hit Angers, in every way that Spring can' hit-a veritable right ~ook to the heart. (A special hello to all you lovers! ) It's gone right to my head, even as I sit here. And I'm not the only one! The only o~e sitting here, yes; but Spring! Why, tomorrow a large congregatiOn of SUNDEF is going on a 28 kilometer moby ride to play softball. And, of course, the ever-present phenomenon the Picnic. What joy. ' 
The students are still working very hard, however. Just this mo~ning we ~ot together to work on our own little yearbook. Trymg to decide a theme...we dismissed "Agony & Ecstacy " ~ven "Ago~y & Ag.ony." It just can't be put that simply. The be~t 1dea so far ts the simple caption "Some of Us Don't." This can be used in many ways...some of us go to classes, some of us don't; s?me of ':Is speak French, some of us don't; some of us go home at mght, e.nJOY our classes, drink a lot of wine, go to church on Sunday, get mail from friends at ND, et cetera, et cetera and some of us don't. This suggestion has been more or less dis~issed, not for its highly controversial apsects, as you might expect, but for its rather pessimistic overtones. And the year in Angers hardly deserves that. 
My goodness...where else could you get a theology course slotted at 8:30 Monday morning taught by a professor who speaks in the Passe Simple? Or an Institutions Publiques class taught by the grandson of Alexander "the Three Mousquetaires" Dumas? The opportunities are endless. And not only that: we have no classes on Thursday afternoons. Now can you beat them apples? 
I think it's clear by now that Spring has made me light verging on empty headed. But I love it. I remember springing about the Notre Dame campus in Spring. I think it came a bit later...but I do remember it. We all remember it even if we never hear from anybody there. <hint 2) but I don't need to tell you about your upcoming change of seasons-you'll see for yourself. So: What is Spring in Angers? 
It means a change in all the flower beds; and they are many. Both the beds and the changes. (Not so with our sheets, however­we do our own laundry over here.) The sky is also blue. This was something we got a kick out of last Fall, and are sort of glad to see return. And so many other little things .. .like the upcoming Easter vacation! We'll profit from that. How does Greece sound? A few travel-happy individuals are talking about it. Not everyone.. .few of us speak Greek. <Try and tell that to our French teachers!) Some of us will settle for Spain or England, or even both-and Greece! You'd be amazed how much you can see whiz by in 17 days. Or even longer...some of us come back from vacations on time, some of us don't. 
Myself, I'm going to go the Isles and walk on the moors pretending I was created by Charles Dickens. <Who knows, mayb~ I_ was. l We all have our personal fantasies to indulge, or dreams to hve, depending on how you want to look at it. That's why some of us will travel to Rome and bless the crowds...and others to Am­sterdam to bless the Heineken. We all turn religious when travelling; fervently praying that the customs man won't find that candy bar and those three cigarettes. Chances are he won't~ven if he does wake us up. Oh the excitement of international trade. 
We get visits these days from Innsbruck people...we're sort of '<;ed to it now. What I'm waiting for is some well-worn voyager 110m Mexico City...or better yet, Japan. That would be something. Almost as good as a letter from a friend at ND (3). 
Really, we're happy. Got paid on Wednesday...had a cocktail party, went out to dinner. Today is Friday, we're eating at the RU. Notre Dame pays us enough, but with oour'lack debts it sort of got eaten up-rapidly. A RU meal only costs 50 cents, and you can't get even a rue meal for that much. Or for that little. 
Oh! Anabel just stopped by and of course that reminded me of the St. Ma~y's commu.nity-not that I had forgotten, but I did neg!ect to deh_ver a. special hello. Hello-a special one. Too bad I can t expr~ss 1t more eloquently. There are five young ladies from SMC sharmg SUNDEF with us ...we like them. One of them, formerly known as Sue, is now referred to as "SMC." See what loyalty? 
At any rate, so much for Spring in the Loire Valley. And so much for our thoughts of you-for the present moment, at least, and rest assured, no longer. And by the way-write.

a moderator, cited the fact that 10,000 people are dying each week due to hunger. He outlined two factors to be con­sidered. The first is whether or not values can be taught and tlie second asks if theUniversity can be morally neutral or it it should take sides on controversial issues. 
"No more Magruders" 
The book On Higher Learning by Robert Hutchins claims that the University should just deal with intellectual issues, noted O'Leary. In contrast, he observed that the ~ ...._,,its advocate teaching the whole man in moral spects. Dr. Stanley Hauerwas, professor of theology, began by saying, "No university wants to produce more Magruders. We have got to have a values seminar taught at the senior level." 
by Pat Cuneo 
Staff Reporter 
Dr. Roberto Cruz discussed bilirtgual alternatives to education in a lecturelast night in the Library Auditorium. 
In short, bilingual education is instruction in two languages, whereby the young student becomes proficient in two languages and cultures. Although the program is workable in a multiplicity of languages, Cruz concentrated on the Spanis­English language. 
Cruz stated, "the child can take the best of the American system while keeping his native culture." ln the same way, the American youth benefits through his knowledge of both cultures. 
The popular misconception to this program, cited Cruz, "is teaching the Spanish -speaking child a sufficient amount of English and then throwing him into a one-language system again." 
Most of Cruz's work has been 
tested in the San Francisco Bay 
area, where he teaches at Stanford Universityand directs a number of bilingual organizations and training programs. 
"The Chicano has refused to 
surrender his culture to the 
melting pot of America as did 
the European immigrant, mainly 
because he did not migrate to the 
new world," offered Cruz. 
Cruz drew an analogy of small <ethnic l tributary streams, filtering into the mainstream, in 
With regard to the world hunger issue, Hauerwas said that it "presents us with a great moral crisis and we should have something to say about that to show the university to be relevant." 
The problem is, he continued, that "just as the study of humanities does not humanize a person, neither does ethics make a moral man." Values are too fragile to be learned; they involve training, he added. 
"The University is tempted to sell its soul to a moral store which is not central to the university's primary moral role," he stated. 
Hauerwas noted that the diversity of function is an im­portant aspect. "The University is not meant to meet every moral problem; its primary task is to be itself. It is the institution to give people the psychological and physical space to be dedicated to life and mind," he said. 
Articulation of truth 
The articulation of truth is a moral task, Hauerwas stated, and we are better off in the long run if we know the truth. 
"It is an institution that takes the risk that it is better to produce men to pursue the truth even though it may cause pain in the long run," Hauerwas said. "The pursuit of the truth is not separate from the pursuit of the good. We expect in our students and faculty in­tegrity." 
"We must take the reality as it is and not as we would wish it to be. This requires honesty, justice, humility, humor and kindness. As the demands of truth can be so destructive that only the love of others can sustain us in such a moral endeavor," said Hauerwas. 
He then raised three questions: how the University is to fulfill this role, what kind of community would be required and are we now doing it successfully. 
Rodes sites moral leadership 
Professor of Law Robert Rodes followed Hauerwas comenting, "I see more moral leadership in the University than Hauerwas does, a Christian should be concerned about hunger." 
"We are all of us inadequate before suffering; we need to work together out of common· inadequacy," stated Rodes, citing such obstacles as our habit of being

Professor of Government Peri Arnold represented a 'different background. "There is assumption of both Hauerwas and Rodes that Imorality is easily available. I want to suggest that it is a much ' harder job to find a basis for 
morality." 

First, he mentioned that we assume the moral role of the university. Second, he suggested an inquiry into the role of holy beliefs. Thirdly, he proposed that the university might provide the basis for reflection. 
"We must teach men and women how to reflect on the beliefs. The values can be memorized but memory serves a poor guide for moral choices," he claimed. 
He noted that only in a "heterogenous community of religious beliefs" is it possible to reflect on such issues. 
Burtchaell on Christian tradition 
Burtchaell was the last to ad­dress the issue stating, "As ·a University, our principle task is a search for learning; this can be a big contribution to moral life in the community. If men and women are good then their being wise has a great moral impact on the world." 
Burtchaell described qualities of the University, first citing the fact that it is a tradition to become not only proficient in a discipline but also to try to put the knowledge to human use. 
Secondly, "Our tradition does

saying that there are courses in the Universitywhich help us learn how to think and analyze problems. "We must do a lot of thinking to figure out what to do about the

Reactions varyover drinking age bill defeat 

by Marianne Schulte Starr Reporter 

Optimism for the lowering of the drinking age in Indiana to eighteen years of age was shattered last Thursday, when Chester F. Dovis, chairman of the House Public Policy Committee, decided not to hold vote on House Bill 1818. 
After a public hearing on the bill Wednesday, March 5, the outlook 
for  the  passing  the  bill  the  
following  day  looked  very  op­ 
timistic,  according  to  students  

representing Indiana colleges who were present at the meeting and who had been woking for the bill for nearly seven months. 
Without explanation, Dovis refused to hold a vote on the bill, thereby obliterating all chances for the bill to be allowed on the House floor this year for further debate and the final decisive vote. 
t:ommentmg yesterday on Dovis" move. Indiana State Hepresentative Robert DuComb stated. "It was a surprise to members of the committee when Dovis decided not to hold the vote. He might have made that decision because he felt that the bill would not hpve had sufficient support from panel members to assure its release into the House's agenda." 
DuComb did not, however. dismiss the possibility that Dovis' personal feelings concerning the bill might have entered into his decision relased last Thursday. DuComb admitted, "It is not in­conceivable that for some personal 
reason  Chairman  Dovis  did  not  
want  the  bill  released  to  the  
House."  
Confirming  that  it  was  not  

possible for the bill to be brought up again l'ntil next year, DuComb speculated that it was possible, but extremely unlikely, that the bill could be attached as a rider to another bill this year in hopes of entering into the house floor. 
"We're not like Congress, you know. We can't make a Christmas tree out of a bill; riders can't be attached to just any bill. They must be related to the same sub­ject matter as the bill they are appended to," DeComb said. 
DuComb admitted, "Unless the Indiana Alcoholic Beverages Association plans to introduce any 
major bills this year, the chances for House Bill 1818 becoming at­tached as a rider to a bill are unquestionably abscure." 
DuComb concluded on the promising note that "our brightest hope appears to rest on the pending success of the passing of the Faccenda Bill <the limited liability drinking bill) later this year. Otherwise the future of the bill will rest on its re-introduction to the same or another committee next year." 

Not unexpectedly, student reactions to the failure of the bill varied widely. Farley sophomore Judy Robert commented, "I guess I just had too much optimism. I suppose I didn't really believe it would pass because Indiana is so conservative. On the other hand, I thought that the chances seemed pretty good, especially after McLaughlin and others had gone down to the hearing and admitted to the bill's favorable chances for being voted out of the committee." 
Considering the liquor situation here on campus, Robert stated, "It's a farce because not everyone is twenty-one and they're going to the bars anyway. People are just going to have to wake up to reality." She also remarked that if alcohol were again allowed on campus, the stature of social life and parties would be improved at least to the level they were at last year. 
Grace Tower resident Gerard Martin, a junior from New York, noted, "It's ridiculous--it just shows you what a backward state Indiana is anyway." 
Morrissey resident Rob Tully, conceded. "I was really disap­pointed. In a sense, I think it was kind of irresponsible of the state legislators not to take into con­sideration some kind of com­promise ... at least lowering the drinking age to 18 or 19 for beer,

lnPIRG scores 111ajor victory 
by Hrian M. Clancy Starr Reporter 

The Indiana Public Interest 
Hesearch Group <lnPIRG) won a 
major victory l''ebruary 14 when 
the Public Service Commission 
closed a case concerning Indiana 
telephone companies' efforts to 
charge customers for directory 
assistance calls. 
"This is the first really clear-<:ut victory for the people of Indiana to come out of the new Public Service Commission." said Fritz Wiecking, InPIRG state director. "It has been clear for over a year now that the telephone companies had no reasonable way to charge for directory assistance without penalizing poor people, students and those who move frequently" he added. 
lnPIRG originally intervened in the proceedings in July 1973 when the Public Service Commission ordered General Telephone of Indiana. Indiana Bell of Indiana, llnited Telephone of Indiana and lllinois Bell to submit plans for charging for directory assistance

The dec1s1on by the Pubhc telephone companies to add directory assistance charges to their regular rate proceedings will 
be allowed. 
The Notre Dame chapter of InPIRG has been working with the state organization. conducting an investigation of the rate structuresof electric utility com­panies. The investigation resulted in the introduction of at least seven bills into the state legislature. These bills concerned such areas as utility deposits. interest on deposits, the warning period before cutting off service and an extension of billing periods. 
Locally, InPIRG has just released a report on checking accounts in the South Bend-Mishawaka area. The report, based on a survey compiled by !\lark Clark, a board member, tells in detail each bank's charge per check, charge for bounced checks and monthly service charges. The report is designed to help students select the bank best suited for their needs. The report is available at 

the campus InPIRG office. involve more people because we Another InPIRG project rely upon manpower," she added.

presently under way is a grocery

be prepared by Jim Wilmes, will

semester's report and will be done

The Notre Dame chapter has also been assisting the state office in starting new chapters at IUSB. Ill-Northwest in Gary, and at St. Mary's. These new chapters should be functioning by the end of this semester and ready for action next semester. 
The newly elected InPIRG Board of Directors are having a meeting Wednesday night to decide which areas each of the officers will be in charge of. "We will be trying for quality projects with more impact," said Julie Engel)Jart, one of the new board ml·mbers. "We especially want to

even if it did remain a minimum age of twenty-one for hard liquor." 
Sophomore Kent Bransford from Fisher Hall responded, "It warms the cockles of my heart to know that the guiding fathers of this great state possess that rare and touching concern for my frail being that manifests itself in the tender coddling arms of state legislation." He added, "Let's drink to the coddling arms." 
When questioned for comment on the recent failure of the bill, one junior resident from Dillon <requesting to remain anonymous) quipped, "I'll take the fifth." 
Three freshmen from Farley, all coming from states with an eighteen years-old drinking law, agreed, "They should have passed the bill, because if you want to drink, you're going to drink anyway. If students can't get into the bars here in Indiana, they're only going to go up to Michigan to drink." 
One of these freshmen, Mary I<'lannery, observed, "I think that there is an over-emphasis on 
campus placed on drinking." 
Mary Bak agreed, "Sometimes I 
wonder if it isn't a case of the old 
'forbidden thing'--that people 
make such a big deal out of it 
because it's not allowed. At home 
we have parties and alcohol is 
merely regarded as a natural 
occurence, but not as the major 
reason for having or going to the 
party." 

Freshman Rosemary Marks from New York offered her opinion on the consequences of the alcohol situation here on campus. "Campus unity is being shot. People are keeping more and more to their rooms." 
Probably the biggest obstacle preventing alcohol from being allowed on campus is the policy holding the university liable," she added, "What bothers me is the total inconsistency of the situation. 
What makes someone more mature in Michigan than in In­diana?" 
In conclusion, the three agreed. 'Notre Dame is not like a normal college "

44th Bengal Bouts resume tonight 


CHET ZAWALICH will be the veteran tonight when he faces freshman Carl Penn in an attempt to repeat his championship in the 180 lb. bracket. 
by Bill Brink 
The 44th annual Bengal Bouts got under way Sunday evening in the ACC, with 16 fights taking place among contestants from the 127 to the 175 lb. brackets. 
Hard-hitting, aggressiveness and a little blood characterized the first half of the evening, but most of the first eight fights produced one clearly dominant fighter as evidenced by the one TKO and five unanimous decisions. Only two fights were close enough to warrant split decisions. Terry Broderick opened the eveninglwith a unanimous 
decision over Dan Romano in· the 127 lb. class. 
Sophomore Mike Mullin followed with a unanimous 
decision victory over Jason Mims in the 135 lb. 
bracket. 

The Bouts' first close match came next in the 140 lb.. division with sophomore Pat O'Brien scoring a split decision win over senior Larry Higgins. Higgin's aggressiveness made for a lively match, but O'Brien's superior reach enabled him to check it and capture the bout. Bob Kane then won the other match in that class with a unanimous decision over Greg Bachman. 
Amidst the blood and controversy of the 150 lb. division bout Junior Mike Shaw outpointed John Albers in a debated split decision. Though Albers drew blood from Shaw's face, Shaw used his defenisve prowess to gain the victory. The evening's first TKO followed in the 155 lb. class with Rob Metzler stopping Bob Schweihs at 35 seconds into the second round. 
Joe Cooler's unanimous decision over Dave Brown in the 160 lb. bracket and Steve Schuster's win over fights being stoppedTony Yonto, also by unanimous decision, brought a before completion. Matt Wuellner close to the first half of the night's events. opened the 165lb. weight class with

Zawalich playing veteran 
Wt'ight Class: 
by Rich Odioso 

Chet Zawalich knows what Carl Penn must be thinking. Two years ago in the Bengal Bouts Zawalich, then a freshman just out of Hart· ford, Conn. entered for the ring for the first boxing match of his life. 
Now in che role of veteran, Zawalich meets Penn, a freshman from El Paso, Texas, in the semifinals of the rugged 180 pound weight class Tuesday night. "I was uncertain, unsure of myself, " says Zawalich. "I was worried about the ring, the crowd. how to train, what to eat-all this plus my opponent." Uncertain or not, Zawalich scored a knockout in that fight before losing a close bout to Jerry Samaniego. Last year Zawalich won his first Bengal Championship. 
Penn is understandably 'lervous yet confident as he prepares for the bout. "I've boxed some before, in fact my first organized fight was in the fourth grade, but its been an off-and'{)n thing. Yet I've gone in against some Army guys back home, they're really tough, and I'm still here so I should be all right. I've got confidence in my training and I've had some good tips. I'll just do my best and see what happens." 
Zawalich feels that experience is a small, yet possibly decisive, advantage in the Bengals. "I'm not really worried in the ring. I've been on both ends of the stick, a winner and a loser and I can accept whatever happens. A key to boxing is self-confidence, because with it you can relax and perform to vour ootential." 

Zawalich knows he's going to need more than just confidence to win the 180 pound class which shapes up as one of the Bengal's best. In the other semifinal bout Mike McGarry, whom Zawalich describes as "good with jabs, more of a dancer, he's got a lot of quick combinations," meets Ed Coppola who is "more of a slugger, he's got a strong upper body." McGarry boxed in the Bengals last year and while this is Copola 's first Bengals he has prior ring experience.

face and earned him a TKO victory at 1:20 of the final round. 
John Ricotta and Tom Plouff then provided the crowd pleaser in that division with a wild, scrappy bout resulting in a split decision victory for Ricotta. 
The New York sophomore managed enough hard combinations among thequickflurries to win the bout. 
John Garland finished up the 165 lb. bracket with a TKO of Mike Thomas when Thomas failed to answer the bell for the second round. 
In the 175lb. division Lou Bulte dominated the first 
two rounds of his fight with Tom Hastings to gain a unammous decision. Sophomore John Thornton used an agressive jab attack to eke out a split decision win over Shane Carew. 
The first knockout of the evening came in the third match of the 175 lb. class, with junior Thad Naquin disposing of Bill Blum at 20 seconds into the third round. The match had been close until a right to the jaw decked Blum. Bob Farrell then closed the evening by defeating Gus Cifelli by a TKO at 40 seconds into the third round. 
The bouts resume tonight at 8:00 with 18 matches slated for the evening. Tonight will mark the first competition in the 180 lb. and 190 lb. weight classes, along with bouts in all of the lighter divisions as well. 
Key matches to watch begin in the 150 lb. weight class when defending champ Phil Harbert takes on Mike Shaw, a winner on Sunday night. Harbert floored all three of his opponents last year en route to the division title and the matchup with Shaw is ex­pected to be a rought, hard-fought one. 
In the 175lb. bracket the bout between Thad Naquin and Bob Farrell promises to be one of the highlights of the event. Both fighters won convincingly on Sunday. 
Defending champion Chet Zawalich opens the 180 lb. bracket with a match against freshman Carl Penn. Zawalich is the favorite of the division, but the competition is by no means easy, with Penn and other division contenders Mike McGarry and Ed Coppola (who also fight each other tonight> expected to be formidable opponents. 
Both of tonight's bouts in the 190 lb. division should prove exciting. Mike McGuire, champion in 1973 and runner-up in 1974 faces Ron Buttarazzi, and Tom Bake takes on Rudy Ruettiger.
