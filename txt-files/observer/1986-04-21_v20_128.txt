North Quad blackout dims lights but not student pranks 
By CUFF STEVENS 
CopyEdttor 
The lights went out in several North Quad buildings late Saturday night, but the quad lit up with stu­dents' fireworks and a bonfire, wit­nesses said. 
Power failed at approximately 
II :30 p.m., according to Director of UtilitiesJohn Delee. 
Cavanaugh Hall, Breen-Phlllips Hall, Farley Hall, Zahm Hall, LaFortune Stuf1ent Center, Student Health Center and the Administra­tion Building lost power during the failure, according to Delee. 
Delee attributed the cause of the blackout to a short In the electrical feeder line running between Cavanaugh Hall and LaFortune. He said the short triggered a power plant breaker that shut down the af­fected buildings' power. 
After the short was determined, power was turned on for every af­fected building except LaFortune so that Its line could be repaired, Delee said. 
"We didn't want to turn it back on until we found where the problem was," he said. 
He said electricity was restored approximately one and a half hours later to every building · except LaFortune, which regained power at approximately 6:30 a.m. yesterady. 
Farley Hall resident Anne Marie O'Brien said that the crowd of stu­dents who gathered on the quad when the power went out was "wild." 
"There was a lot of firecrackers going off," said Breen-Phillips Hall resident Leslie Heidenreich. A bonfire was also started on the quad, according to Heidenreich. 
Although Cavanaugh Hall's semi­formal was put in the dark, the· dan­cing continued in the hallways, said rector Father Matthew Miceli.

Relatives c-ondemn United States for death of Kilburn in Lebanon 
APTOS, Calif. -Family members of Peter Kilburn, an American hostage killed in apparent retaliation for the 
U.S. air raid on Ubya condemned yesterday the U.S. government for the attack and said it would escalate violence In the area. 
"I don't think Peter will be the only one that will be sacrificed," said Jeanne Repetto, Peter Kilburn's sister-in-law, in an interview. Repetto compared the U.S. air raid on Ubya to throwing a bomb out a window to kill a pest. 
"By throwing the bomb out the window, we've blown out the win­dow, breaking whatever protection we had, and now we have found that, Instead, we hit a hornet's nest. I shudder to think about what will happen," said Repetto, 56, of San Jose, Calif. 
She and other members of the Kil­burn family gathered here at the home ofTim Kilburn, Kilburn's nep­hew, to call upon the world to join them in a day ofprayer April 25. 
Kilburn's body was flown to Andrews Air Force Base near Was­hington yesterday, said Bruce Am­merman, a State Department spokesman. 
His body was discovered with those of two Britons in Lebanon's central mountains Thursday, along with a note saying they had been "c:xecutc:d" by the Arab Revolution­ary Cells to avenge the U.S. attack against Ubya earlier In the wc:ek. 
Ammerman said Kilburn's body arrived about noon and was taken to an undisclosed location for a foren­sic examination. 
The body wa'i flown aboard a U.S. Air Force C-141 transport plane from the U.S. Rhein-Main Air Base In West Germany, where: it had arrived Saturday from the Middle: East, said Master Sgt. Dave McMahon, a U.S. military spokesman at the base, nc:ar Frankfurt .

'Good ole days' can be found in future as well as in past 
"Well, when I was growing up, I had to walk six miles to school in blizzard conditions. You know, a loaf of bread was oniy a nickel--ah, the good-ole days." 
Most everyone knows a relative or old family friend who is known to make statements like the one above. They sit back and reflect on when they were younger, making comparisons to the current craziness of our world and say "When I was growing up, I could have never gotten away with ..." 
As I grew older, I noticed the "good ole day" stories were being told by younger and younger people. 
Lately, I have been kidding my older brother about beginning the "I remember when" stage. He can speak of a walk to school as an exaggerated four miles, al­though he can still say this in a joking manner. 
I thought I had some time before falling into this trap of making comparisons to the "younger" generation. After last weekend, however, I feel myself wanting to tell the world about my two mile walk to high school (there is a direct correlation between the age of the in­
dividual talking and the dis­shaving cream on a friend's 
tance to school). 
Last weekend, some friends from high school and I attended a convention of high school students from ---.---r--r-.,~~ an organization ofwhich we were once members. In all, there were over 300 ofthem and six ofus. The realization that we had gotten old (or at least older) set in quickly; We could feel our arteries start to harden. 
Actually, it took a while for it to sink in that we were in a different world. We all decided to crash their dance and attempt to dance to periodic "heavy metal" special requests from the crowd. We also witnessed a frightning moment when part of the group started simultaneously to chant the words to "like a Surgeon." We were in the twilight zone. 
I realized time is definitely relative after people had difficulty remembering just what year I graduated and when I couldn't recognize the person who's position I held oniy two years before. Four girls screamed across the dance floor to me telling me they are from my old high school (I, of course, had absolutely no clue as to who they were). 
After the dance we sat down and, sure enough, started to reminisce about our old high school days. Fortunately, we did snap out of our daze and started to get back to our realities--college and what we are going to do with the rest ofour lives. 
This eye-opening experience was only the latest inci­dent in noticing the difference two years make. When I 

Scoff Bearby 

VIewpoint Editor 
returned home over Christmas break, I was told of mar­riages, new-born babies, divorces, and even death, not of people older than myself, but happening to people who I regularly saw in the high school hallways. 
I listened in amazement as I was told an old teacher was engaged to a girl I once had a crush on. Amazement turned to amusement as two girls I knew before college asked if a little boy seated a short distance from me in a local mall was mine. 
I realize that we are not really old, though (as I com­
plete a practical joke from 
the good ole days and put 
phone receiver) and some things should never change. I did not have the heart to tell a disgruntled high school senior this after she confided that she was ready to get away from some ofher friends who "haven't grown up." 
The truth is, the minute one fully grows up is the minute most of the fun is taken out of life. While it is important to grow, the "kid in you" should not be forgot· ten. 
When all was said and done, I had a very good time 

last weekend. It was fun to get the "good ole days" out 
ofthe system, butit was even better on the drive back to 
Notre Dame to get ready for the "good ole days" of the 
present and future. After all, I have to begin collecting stories to com­plete the line, "Well, when I was at Notre Dame...

Ideas shared, Hesburgh honored at 'powerful' 25 year CILA reunion 
By MISSY KOLOSZAR 
StaffReporter 
"It was a beautiful, powerful weekend," said James Roemer, Director of Community Relations, about the 25 year reunion held by the Community of Lay Apostalates ( CILA) this weekend. 
CILA is a student service organiza­tion of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's which aims to help underprivileged and disadvantaged people on local, national and international levels. 
The reunion's purpose was to give everyone touched by CILA In the past 25 years the opportunity to get together and share their ex­periences. 
"The weekend was great for the participants because it renewed the CILA Ideals that have become part of their lives," said Mike Lochhead, stu­dent co-chairperson ofCILA. 
University President Father Theodore Hesburgh, Associate Provost Father Edward Malloy, Director of Fatima Retreat Center Father Stephen Gibson and the founder of CILA, Father Larry Murphy participated in the reunion's program. 
Lochhead presented Hesburgh with a water-color painting of the Golden Dome In gratitude for his physical and spiritual support. 
"The reunion was also a salute to Hesburgh for his encouragement of the CILA program," said Roemer. 
One of the highlights of the reunion was the exchange of ideas and experiences among the CILA participants. "Everyone par­ticipated. There was not a silent per­son in the group," said Roemer. 
During the reunion Malloy discussed "what Is Involved in keeping a social justice conscience Integrated In one's life," said Loch­head. 
"The same spirit and values which got CILA started are still present today," said Father Ernest Bartell, a former director of the organization. Currently there are 25 students from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's from Involved In CILA. 
CILA was the first formal service organization at Notre Dame. It was initially composed of Notre Dame students and acted as a discussion group for social Issues and Catholic social teachings. Many of the Initial members were participants in service projects In Latin America. 
"Today CILA has become more lo­calized," said Bartell. It focuses on providing services to area Institu­tions. He also said 26 Notre Dame student service programs were created out of CILA. 

Anti-abortion activists arrested 
CLAYfON, Mo.-About 100 anti­abortion activists were arrested Saturday after trying to stop women from entering an abortion clinic, authorities said. 
The demonstrators arrested at the Reproductive Health Center were to be charged with trespassing and resisting arrest, said Officer Don Sut­ter of the St. Louis County Police. Many of the demonstrators were from out ofstate, he said, adding that there was no violence. 
Clayton is west ofSt. Louis. 
On Friday, anti-abortion activists shouted slogans and taunts at about 65 women's rights supporters who were picketing outside a St. Louis University building, where about 260 people attended a conference opposing abortions. 
Organizers of the meeting said It was designed to discuss non-violent methods of shutting down clinics that perform abortions. 
The agenda for the conference In­cluded sessions called "Activating and Organizing Christian Resis­tance" and "Understanding Abor­tionists and Their Victims."

SWEETWATER, Texas -Damage was estimated at up to S20 million yesterday in the wake ofa pair oftor­nadoes that slashed through homes, killing one person and injuring 100. Texas Governor Mark White toured the city yesterday to sec what state aid was needed. 
White said he probably would an­nounce tomorrow whether the city should be declared a disaster area. He said he would contact the Texas Housing Authority to sec if aid could be arranged for the homeless. 
"The only thing I can say is tough times never last, but tough people do, and we've got a lot of tough people around here," White said. 
As many as 1,500 people were homeless and property damage was estimated at S 15 million to S20 mil­lion, Mayor Rick Rhodes said yester­day. An overnight curfew was posted to prevent looting. 
Two twisters dipped from the clouds in succession early Saturday, then came together to cut a swath of destruction a half-mile wide and two miles long through a mobile home park, a senior citizens' housing project and a subdivision, Rhodes said. 
More than 2,000 of the city's 12,000 residents were a1fected by the damage to about 800 houses, and three-quarters of those houses were destroyed, Rhodes said. 
He said that although emergency shelters were set up, few of the homeless used them Saturday night because they were taken In by other Sweetwater residents. 
"Last night I think the mood was somewhat relief that we had survived a very trying day. Today, the realization has finally hit us what a devastating blow this has been to the community," the mayor said yes­terday.

yesterday, one in critical condition, at Hendrick Medical Center In Abilene, said hospital spokeswoman Jo Thompson. Nine people, all In stable condition, were held over­night In Sweetwater's Rolling Plains Memorial Hospital, spokesman Bud Neffsald. 
"It was just like I was In a vacuum," said Gladys Lane, a resi­dent of the Sun Valley senior citizens' project, as she looked through what used to be the side wall of her house. "I was down on my knees begging the Lord to take care of me. I didn't care about the house." 
Kathleen Lewis, director of the housing project, told the governor that residents had pulled together well through the storm. An 87-year­old project resident was the lone fatality from the twisters. 
A curfew was posted from 7:30 
p.m. to 7:30 a.m. as the Texas Na­tional Guard patrolled the streets. 
An organized half-21 party just became a "half-light and half-dark party," said Overbeck. 
Zahm Hall's fire alarm was tested during the failure by afreshman resi­dent, according to resident Mike Meyer. "It worked," said Meyer, "and It pissed off our rector." 
The dome lights on the Adminis­tration Building were mispointed after power resumed, according to onlookers. 
The lights were pointed at the Alumni Van parked behind the building and at the Sacred Heart Church steeple, prompting specula­tion that they may have been tam­pered with during the blac;kout.

Secret Libyan terrorist fund found by Mideast intelligence services 
HAMBURG, West Germany · The weekly BUd am Sonntag neWspaper said Saturday that Ubya had a secret fund to pay rewards to Lebanese ter­rorists to carry out attacks against Is­raeli and. Western targets. 
It said the Ubyan price list, which offered up to S12,000 for a suicide attack, was discovered by Lebanese and Israeli intelligence-services, but gave no source for its report. 
The article also said that British in· telligence agents found out in December that Ubya has been paying $12 million each year to a Palestinian terrorist group headed by Abu Nidal. 
It did not say how long Ubya had been paying money to Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabry al-Banna, but gave this account of one pur­ported transaction: 
Abu Nidal and Ubyan leader Col. Moammar Khadafy met in the Ubyan capital ofTripoli last September and agreed that Abu Nidal's terrorists would attack "English, American, Is­raeli and Egyptian targets" under the supervision of the Ubyan secret service. 
Hassan Ashkal, described as a colonel in the Ubyan armed forces, then gave Abu Nidal the "first install­ment of S5 million." 
In November, Abu Nidal's ter­rorists hijacked an Egyptian Boeing 737 to Malta, and the Incident ended in a bloodbath when 59 people were killed as Egyptian commandos stormed the plane at the Valletta air· port. 
Bild am Sonntag said Ashkai was "liquidated" a day after the assault because Khadafy wanted to remove all traces of Ubyan involvement in the hijacking. 
The newspaper's report appeared in its Sunday editions but was released in advance to other news media. 
"Israeli and Lebanese intelligence services have discovered there is a secret Khadafy price list for attacks," Bild am Sonntag said, and it gave this list: 
Ubya offers 10,000 Lebanese pounds, about S400, for placing bombs or mines against the targets. 
A reward the equivalent of S800 would be paid for hand-grenade at­tacks, while a machine-gun attack would be worth 51,200. 
A terrorist willing to carry out a suicide attack would be guaranteed a sum of S12,000, to be paid to the terrorist's survivors. 

Gorbachev says summit is possible 
Associated Press 

POTSDAM, East Germany -Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said yes­terday that he was willing to meet President Reagan this year if the United States changed policies he charged were poisoning relations between the superpowers. 
Speaking to reporters at Potsdam, site of the 1945 Allied conference on Germany, Gorbachev said "the meeting (with Reagan) can take place if the United States realizes that itis necessary to take this path." 
"But ifit (America) goes on acting as it is today, trying to poison the atmosphere, this will throw a shadow over any future meeting," the Soviet Communist Party chief said. "Ifit (the summit) is to happen, a better atmosphere is necessary." 
Gorbachev did not elaborate, but he appeared to be referring to last week's U.S. bombing raids on Ubya and recent U.S. underground tests of nuclear weapons. On Friday, Gor­bachev told the East German Com­munist Party congress those actions and the "increased (U.S.) threats" against Nicaragua demonstrated that the United States was following a "militarist and aggressive" policy that could damage U.S.-Soviet rela­tions. 
White House ChiefofStaff Donald Regan said yesterday the United States expected Gorbachev to "live up to his word" and meet with Reagan this year. 
The two men agreed at their Geneva summit in November to meet this year in the United States. No date has been set. 
Regan, interviewed on the NBC television program "John McLaugh­lin: One on One," said he believed the meeting had been "postponed more than canceled." 
The Soviet leader addressed reporters in the courtyard at Cecilienhof, a manor house where Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, Presi­dent Harry Truman and Prime Mini­ster Winston Churchill of Britain met in the summer of 1945 to decide the fate ofpostwar Germany. 
Gorbachev was the first Soviet leader to visit the site since Stalin was there, East German officials said. They said other Soviets had not come for "political reasons" after Nikita Khrushchev · denounced Stalin. 
Gorbachev has been in East Berlin for the party congress since Wed­nesday and is expected to return to Moscow tomorrow. Yesterday was his first day away from the congress, which ends today. 
Explosion of 'dud bomb' injures 3 
Associated Press 

TRIPOU, Ubya -Ubyan officials said a bomb that did not explode when dropped during the U.S. air strike blew up Saturday night in a residential district, Injuring a man and two boys. 
The boys, ages 11 and 13, were playing soccer when they found the " bomb in a mound of rubble in the 
,.; ,. Bin-Ashour district, said the officials. It blew up at about 7 p.m. when the man tried to remove it, they said. The officials, who insisted on anonymity in accordance with government regulations, said the man lost his right hand and suJfered serious wounds in the chest and left arm. The boys were slightly hurt, the officials said. There was no independent con­firmation of the report. Ubyan offi­cials were restricting foreign reporters to their hotels except for escorted trips. Ubyan leader Moammar Khadafy's No. 2 man, Staff Maj. Abdel-Saiam )alloud, held a news conference Friday and accused the United States of bombing Ubya be­cause attempts· to have Khadafy poisoned had failed.

Five other American kidnap vic­tims are stlll missing in Lebanon. 
United States continues its "barbaric aggression" against his country. 
.Before the reported bomb explo­sion, the government said earlier Saturday that Ubyan explosives ex­perts were searching for scores of unexploded bombs dropped during the air raid Tuesday. 
Ubyan military officials said Satur­day they found 1 7 unexploded frag­mentation bombs near Tripoli's international airport. The airport's military wing was one offive U.S. tar­gets in the raid. 
Army Maj. Ahmed Abdallah told reporters Saturday that 11 shells crashed inside the airport zone during the U.S. raid but claimed they did not cause substantial damage. 
The military officials claimed the 
U.S. attack failed because American pilots panicked when they ran into libya's air defenses. 
An official announcement on Ubyan radio said army engineers planned yesterday to detonate "dud bombs" dropped by the Americans at Sidi al-Said on the coast west of Tripoli.

Libyan blames Reagan for killing of chickens 
Assodated Press 
TRIPOLI, Ubya -Farmer Milud Mohammed Hassen said Saturday that the U.S. air strikes against Ubya cost him at least 300 of his best chickens. 
"Tell Reagan, Thank you very much," Hassen shouted to a crowd of journalists taken by Ubyan offi­cials to inspect the damage from Tuesday's bombing near the Tripoli airport. 
"He killed my chickens.... Reagan is a chicken killer," the 61-year-old farmer shouted in Arabic. His com­plaints were translated for jour­nalists by a government interpreter. 
"My chickens were asleep, now they are buried," he said, standing near a devastated hen house, its tin roof blown to pieces by a powerful blast that gouged a crater in the orange grove nearby. 
He said, however, 5,700 other hens and chicks survived the pre­dawn air raid and he considered himself lucky because his rabbits escaped unhurt. 
"They are smart," he said. "They went underground after the first bomb." 
Amid a swarm of television cameras, photographers and cluck­Ing poultry, Hassen then grabbed two white hens by the neck and began chanting, "Down with the 
U.S.A. Down with the U.S.A."

,..AIUDPIT TEMPTATION 

Stutlng as a three day festival, An But what makes An Tostal so Tostal now covers six days: Timid special? Surely It Isn't the eating Tuesday, Wicked Wednesday, contests or the)ell-0 wrestling. 'lbirsty Thursday, Frivolous Friday, Many students feel that it is a Sunny Saturday, and Serene Sunday. 



Not only has the length of the festival increased, but new events have also increased dramatically. Since 1984, 23 events have been added. Students now have the op­portunity to engage In 75 diJferent activities during An Tostal. Classes rank as 76th In the list of things to do during An Tostal, even for en­gineers. 
The name An Tostalis Gaelic for "the festival." The Irish celebrate a similar festival, although their ac­tivities are less adventurous than Jell-0 wrestling. The spirit of the festival lives on, however; It presents something for everyone. 
There are many traditional favorites, among the most popular are the chariot races and the bookstore basketball games. However, many of the new events should be quite popular given enough time. Who could resist the glamour of cow chip throwing throwing. or the thrill of eating as much popcorn as humanly pos­sible? 
laying out. I think An Tostalis just organized recreation for all these people-they'd.all be out there anyway," stated Mike Farnan. An Tostal also allows students to relax 
one last time before finals, which gives all a much needed rest. 
"With all of the pressure on the students throughout the year, I think we'd all go crazy ifit weren't for An Tostal," quoted one anonymous Oak Room dweller, "It's good that we can blow everything off for a while and relax. I'm always ready for the last few weeks of school after I've had so much fun during An Tostal. I can't walt until it starts up this week." 
In fact, the entire campus seems to be waiting for this festival. Talk in the dining halls and dorms center around events and possible low test scores resulting from indulgence In these events. 
Upperclassmen advise poor In­nocent freshmen In the ways ofAn Tostal -where to go, what events to be sure to go to. An Tostalls one of the few happenings, except for pasta night at dining hall, that af­fects everyone on campus.

oompicks. Mention those two words on campus these days, and you'll see students begin to change Into something less than human. 
Pulses rise, palms grow sweaty, and eyes dart nervously. In more 
severe cases, students will develop long, fang-like teeth and an 
abnormal overgrowth offacial hair. 
Yes, it's time for that traumatic year-end ritual when students 
rearrange friendships and backstab their peers. Tempers flare, egos 
are bruised, and emotional rollercoasters run wildly out ofcontrol. 
All for a stupid dorm room. 
St. Mary's held room picks shortly before spring break. As usual, 
there were all kinds offrantic negotiations, followed by heartaches, 
sobs, and annoying high-pitched shrieks. 
At Notre Dame, the fun begins this week, when rectors post lists 
ofdorm residents' names that have been randomly scrambled by a 
computer. These lists give the order in which students will choose 
their rooms. 
H your name happens to show up near the top of the list, you'll suddenly become very popular. Since you can choose one of the ·best and largest rooms in the dorm, everybody wants to be your roommate. Friends come crawling out ofthe woodwork. 
They begin to drop by for social visits, they offer to do your 
homework, they leave six-packs ofimported beer by your door. 
Those in biology lab go so far as to name their fetal pig after you. 
It's very moving. 
But somehow you see through it all and realize that these 
"friends" are merely flattering you, using you. 
All for a stupid dorm room. 
Along with the room pick lists, the rectors will often post floor 
plans, indicating the size and location of all the rooms in the dorm. 
For the entire week before room picks, crowds ofstudents 
congregate by the floor plan posters continuously, picking out 
which rooms they want, and devising plots to assure getting those 
rooms. 
For example, a couple ofyears ago, a hulking football player In 
my dorm wanted to make sure that nobody else picked Room 21 7 ­
the room he wanted. On room pick night, he simply stood in front 
of the floor plan, his broad shoulders blocking Room 21 7 from 
everyone's view. 
At one point in the evening, a scrawny freshman walked up to 
him. 
"Excuse me, sir," the frosh said, "but can you please step aside a 
little?" 
"Nope." 
"I just want to see ifRoom 217 Is available on the floor plan," the 
freshman persisted. 
"Usten, pal," said the big Junk, "ifyou take Room 21 7 I will personally see to it that the only room you'll need is a pine box." The freshman had a sudden change ofheart, deciding that fourth floor would be a much better choice. 
The experience left permanent emotional scars on the freshman. He never came near Room 21 7 again. In fact, the poor kid was terrified by the very number. Every time he read a book and got to page 217, he would suddenly turn pale, begin to tremble, and quickly skip to the next page. 
All because ofa stupid dorm room. There are many considerations to take into account when choosing a room. 
Last year, a friend ofmine made sure to choose a room on the west side ofthe dorm so the mornlng sun wouldn't bother him as he slept off his hangovers. 
Another friend chose a particular room because of the excellent TV reception it got for shows like Double Jeopardy and Divorce Court. 
I've even heard ofa Notre Dame rugby player who purposely chose a room that he knew was roach-and rodent-infested. He wanted to save a few bucks on late-nlght snacks. 
These are all valid considerations. But when students begin to quibble about one room over another because ofan extra six inches in length, the situation gets to be pretty absurd. 
The quibbles lead to quarrels, the quarrels iead to shouting matches, shouting matches lead to violence, and violence leads to bloodshed. 
All for a stupid dorm room. 
When the room pick process is left up to random computer lists and the self-centered, ineffective negotiations ofstudents, feelings are inevitably going to be hurt and friendships are going to suffer. 
However, I have an all-new solution that would end room pi~k problems forever.l propose that each dorm sponsor an intrahall mud-wrestling tournament, in which all residents would be required to participate. 
The winner ofthe tournament would get the room ofhis choice, followed by the second place finisher, and so on. No discussion or verbal agreements would be allowed to take place. Everything would be settled in the mud-wrestling pit. Instead ofhurt feelings and severely damaged friendships, there would be just a few bruises and pulle~ muscles. 
You're probably thinking that mud-wrestling might be a bit harsh for the women's dorms. I agree-women shouldn't have to get mud in their hair and underneath their nalJs. Therefore, I propose a milder alternative for women -JELL-0 wrestling. 
I'm sure the ND administration wouldn't ever take my plan seriously. They'd probably say it was a stupid idea. Well, that's right -itis a stupid idea, a delightfully stupid idea. 
All for a stupid dorm room.

Islam has strict principles on use of violence 
I would like to respond to the issues raised by Nancy Hansen in her article :Islam does not condone terrorism, violence." But before· I talk aboUt the position of Islam from issues like war, terrorism, and peace, I want to refer briefly to the misunderstanding of Islam on the part ofmany people. 
Abdelkader M. guest column 
People mix usually between the world "Muslims" and the world "Islam." However, 
r there is a difference between both of them. Islam as a religion is a group ofprinciples that have been sent down by God (Allah) to refine the conduct ofpeople. Muslims are a group of people who believe in Islam. But Muslims are not equal in the degree of their following the priniciples ofIslam. On the top, comes the one who tries to live every Islamic principle in his life. At the bot­tom, comes the one who does not have anyth­ing from Islam except the name. Between 
these two limits, come many categories which differ in the degree oftheir faith. Since no one is pedect, we cannot evaluate Islam as a religion, through the conduct ofany category ofits followers, especially when we start from 
the bottom. 

Islam is not agroup ofpeople, it is a group of principles. We evaluate the behavior of the followers of Islam through the Islamic prin­ciples, rather than the other way around. For someone to evaluate Islam, he needs to go to its basic sources: the Quaran and the tradition of its prophet "Mohamed" (Peace be upon him). 
Let us now talk about the thcee issues that we mentioned before. In Islam the war is jus­tified only to defend and protect the self, the property and the religion against any external aggession. Let me quote here from tJte holy Quaran, "Fight in the cause ofGod those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for God loves not transgressors" ch2 verse: 190. From this verse it is clear that war justified in Islam is not for aggression. But even for the jus­tified war, Islam put what we call "the morals of war." These morals mandate that the sol­diers of Islam must not kill the helpless people. The helpless here are defined as those who are not equipped for war nor participat­ing in it. That is to say, in Islam, the goal does not justify the mean. If you want to be rich, this is a noble goal, but this does not justify to steal This means, in Islam, the goal must be noble and the mean must be noble too, and this is what makes the war legitimate. 
The violation of any of the conditions which are related to the goals or the means of war (as mentioned before), turns the legitimate war to terrorism. That is, a war for illegitimate goal (like aggression or occupa­tion) is terrorism, a use of illegitimate ways and methods (like killing helpless people) even to achieve legitimate goals is terrorism. Needless to say, a use ofillegitimate ways and methods to achieve illegitimate goals is the top of terrorism. 
But what is peace? First ofall, peace is one of the names of God in Islam. The greeting that the Muslims are to use in their dally life is "peace on you." The word "Islam" is derived from the Arabic word "Salam" which means peace. That is, peace is a concept that Islam appreciates and invites people to. But what does peace mean? Does it mean a case of no war, nor terrorism? 
Of course no war, nor terrorism is a part of the peace process, but it does not mean neces­sarily peace. The oppressor may have the power to keep the oppressed silent for a while. This case of silence cannot be described as a case ofpeace. It may be a case of peace for the oppressor, but surely it is not for the oppressed. 
Peace by its nature cannot be separated from justice. Peace must be for all, otherwise it is not a peace. Terrorism may be the il­legitimate child of oppression or may not. It may be the black market in which people look for freedom in a society that keeps the prices quiet by force, where there is no freedom in the controlled market. But any way Islam sup­ports neither the black market nor the con­trolled one. 
But what does peace mean? It does mean the disappearance of the reasons behind war and terrorism and with them war and ter­rorism.

Career and Placement serves students well 
Dear Editor: 
On behalf of the many seniors who have recently completed their job search, we would like to express our sincere apprecia­tion to Kitty Arnold, Paul Reynolds, and the entire staff at Career and Placement Services. As the beneficiaries oftheir efforts, we wish to thank them for the hours of group seminars, personal consultations and the numerous events they have sponsored throughout the recent interview process. · · From the introductory sessions that ac­quaint juniors with successful interview and job search techniques through their reloca­tion services, Career and Placement has been an invaluable asset and resource during this crucial stage ofour college experience. 
Having friends at other schools who often complain quite vocally about the quality of services provided by their career and place­ment offices, we feel fortunate to have a ded­
icated  and  professional  stlllf  which  is  
committed  to  continually  improving  its  
service to students.  

Recognizing that flaws exist in some programs, the staff has made strides toward upgrading services and developing new programs. Foremost among these improve­ments has been increasing the number and 
diversity of the employers who interview at Notre Dame. ­
We encourage all students to support Career and Placement and to attend the numerous events it sponsors throughout the year. The opportunities it provided have given us a significant advantage over the can­didates at other competitive institutions. 
As seniors who will reflect on this time with positive memories, we owe much of this feeling to the professionals at Career and Placement who have served us well.

No one Catholic stand on complex issues 
Dear Editor: 

PhllUp Lao's response (The Observer, April 
15) to the University's policy on investment in South Africa is an old refrain that we hear over and over again. When all arguments fail, and a student or a faculty member cannot get his way on a social issue, the Catholic or Chris­tian card is pulled out ofthe deck in the confi­dent expectation that it will trump all opposing views. It's an interesting and rather desperate forensic technique. We find that University policy is a "damning indictment of the state of the Catholic faith at Notre Dame" while students and faculty supporting that policy are in all probability in danger oflosing their souls. 
When argument sinks to this level we are all the worse for it. I don't suggest that we should ignore the relevance of the Catholic tradition in addressing troublesome social and political issues. Indeed, we have an obligation to do so. But on most social and political issues the tradition does not speak in a single voice. There is no one Catholic or Christian response to a complex issue like investment in South Africa. Sensitive men and women, indeed committed Catholic men and wom­nen, disagree on what is the best strategy or means for achieving justice in that part of the world. And I should hope that they would continue to disagree and not march in lock­step to any tune struck up by the most pas­sionate believers among us. It may surprise the passionate believers that others among us who may disagree with them do have con­sciences informed by Catholic principles. We simply may disagree on how conscience is to be applied to a specific situation. So this is a 
plea  for  more tolerance  and  less  self­ 
righteousness.

Catholic rules on sex do not restrict freedom 
Dear Editor: 
This letter is in response toJulie Maier's let­ter about premarital sex. It is not true that the Church's teaching against premarital sex is in­sulting to the divinity and freedom of the in­dividual. In fact, the experience many have had with sex, even in the most meaningful relationships, shows us the tragic conse­quences ofignoring God's law. 
Marriage loses its sacredness when this spe­cial act is not held in its correct context. If marriage is not kept sacred, often people do not understand that it means for better or for worse; and many of my friends who come from divorced families can witness to this tragedy oferrant sexual practices. 
In no way does the law against sex before marriage constrain people's true freedom. Rather, people who follow this law in the way that Christ intended are set free for a gift of themselves to others in a much more meaningful human love, which can endure the tensions and tragedies to which we are all subject. 
Those who are eager to explain this law's position are not judging the heart of their fel­low people. To assume this is to misinterpret the intentions of the Church in giving us its 
laws. Paul Kueber Keenan Hall

of-15 from the field for Tequilla White lightning. Ian Larkin and Eric Bellafronto tried their best, but these two basketball players could not even hit the side ofa barn for We Can't Jam But We'll Slam Your Mama. They combined to shot a less than impressive 0-of-6. 
·-oestinailonStepan came one sfep -· closer to its goal. They defeated 4 . . . Whipped Faggots and a Homeboy by a score of 21-12. Chris Hagenow and Ed Jordanich shot an identical 5-of13 from the field to lead Destination Stepan to victory. For 4 P.W.F.A.A.H., everyone had an 

I off day shooting from the field. The best shooting percentage for the
f team was Andy Cross who made only two of his eight attempts for a
I 
hot 25 percent shooting average. 
On Sunday, there was a scare in the game between Four Fags and a Zahmbie and Challenger, Go To Fu.l Throttle. John Darrow of the Chal­lenger team was rushed to the hospi­tal after taking a bad spill while going for a rebound. Mark Sullivan, who scored eight baskets for Challenger, said that Darrowfeeling better and is home at Grace. 
Challenger, Go Full Throttle had to continue the game with only four players~"1iiillivan commented thar once they lost Darrow, the team could no longer play effective defense. 
The rest of Sunday's action was characterized by the dominate play of top seeded teams. The Embarass­ing Stains, lead by Tim Kempton, defeated the Return of Red Red Wine 21-14. Lee's BBQ also beat Shaffu by a 21-14 score. Steve Treacy scored seven baskets to lead last year's champ, Fun Bunch Finale, over O.D.,3 Throats and Some Duke by a final of 2I-I0. Pete Herbert made all of his five shooting at­tempts as Mr.Coffey and the Non­Dairy Creamers took a 21-1 5 victory from 5 Guys Without Uberty Bowl Sweats. WBBS With Ed Smerciak beat Smite-Make Someone's Day, 2I­14, as Dan Dressel made 6 of his 7 attempts from the field. Finally, The Shysters easily handled Leon Klin­ghoffer and the 4 Assasins, 21-8. 

In today's big games, Lee's BBQ, led by Jim Dolan and Steve Beuerline, faces Goldprick and the Wiretappers, who are lead by Tom Sluby, on Bookstore Court 9 at 6: 15. On Bookstore Court I 0 at 6:15, Tofu Chaka Khan will play Los Milandros. On Stephan Court I at 6:15, Hill Billies face Mr. Coffey and the Non­Dairy Creamers.

In the Catholic Church there are hun­dreds of religious communitie\, or order\. These Rroups of "religiou\" men and women ha\t comt out of a common lrlldi· 
tion-,.hat Pope John Paul II lrrm> "lhe 
consecrattd life"-·and I hut. ha,·r much in common fthe H)WS, communil~ living, and a shart in lht Church's mis'iion of ~preadin2 the Kingdom of God). 
Bul each religious communil)" has something whiEh marks it out as distincl 
from the othrrs, too. This charism (or Rift of the Hoi~· Spirit) i~ each communit~··s unique ideal or spirit "hich, when added lo the whole, manifests lhe richness of lhe ptyster~: of salvation in Jesus Christ. H is fitted, like a single piece of colore-d stone in­to a mosaic, to form part of the bigJ!,er pic­lure of Jesus ChrisI toda~·. 
The Congregation of the Blessed Sacra­ment (or the Blessed Sacrament Fathers and 
Brothe11i) is a relatively '1ew and small com­
munity among the Church's religious 
orders. The Congregation was founded in 
the vear 1856 bv Saini Peter-Julian 
Eyma.rd, popularly known as "the Apostle of Ihe Eucharist," lo promote awareness of and appreciation for the eucharistic Presence of the risen Lord. l'rom its hum­
ble beginnings in Paris. France, the Con­
gretz:alion today numbers 1200 members in approximately 34 nations worldwide. God ha"' bl('~\l'd IJ,c \o\Ork nf lhe Congre~alion tnormou~h :~ ih rirlil renrun -and~a­quarler of. life and labor on behalf or lbe 
Kingdom. 
Whal dh;tin~uishe.'i lhe Rle.'ised Sacra­ment f"athers and Bro1her~ is their inlense lme for I he Eucharisl. Certainl~. lhe F.urharist belongs to the enlirr Churrh, but the Priesls and Brolhers of the Congrega­tion ha·1e accepted Rspecial charge from the Church lo be contemporar~ apostles of I he F.uckarist and of eucharistic livinjit. The The Rult of l.ife puts il this way: "Our ideal is 
lo live ttw Eucharistic M~·ster~· to the fullesl and lo mke clear its significance so lhatlhr Kingdom of Christ ma)· come..." (I) 
/.il'inx the Eucharistic \fystt'ry to its fullest means developing ever~ possible dimension of lhe Eucharist. Through a love for lhe Lilurg~ and for prayer beforf' the 
Blessed Sacrament, through a life of 
brotherly concern in communil~·. and lhrouRh a life of srrvice and of dedicalion to justice and peace, Blessed Sacrament Fathers and Brolhen seek to show all of us 
ho" fulfilling and demanding life lived in 
lhe light of the Eucharisl can be! 
The Congregation of the Blessed Sacra­
ment has nine local communities through­
out the Uniled Stales. Since coming to New Ynrk City In 1900, lhe Blessed Sac..!llent Fathers and Brothers have expanded their 
wilness and minlslry to Chicago, Cleveland, Albuquerque, San Antonio, Sail 
l..ake City, and other cities and Iowns. The fire of eucharistic zeal still burns in the hearls of those who have followed in the 
footsteps or Saint Peter-Julian Eymard. 
New generations of aposlles of the F.ucharisl continue his work and inspira­lion. so lhat all Chrislians might be more genuinely men and women of the Eucharist. 
Eucharist is our Gift . .. >Ou can live it for life!

NEW YORK -Despite a one-sided victory over the New York Rangers in Game 2 of their National Hockey League playoff series, the Was­hington Capitals say they'll have to keep hitting if they want to win tonight's third game. 
"If we don't come out with fire in our eyes, it will be a tough game," Washington right wing Craig Laugh­lin said as the best-of-seven Patrick Division finals at Madison Square Garden. 
Washington's resounding 8-l vic­tory at the Capital Centre in Lan­dover, Md., Saturday night tied the series at 1-l and featured some of the toughest checking the Capitals have done in the playoffs so far. It erased memories of Thursday night's 4-3 overtime loss to the Rangers after which Washington Coach Bryan Murray accused his team ofplaying soft hockey. 
"We told our players to bump their defensemen," Murray said. "When we hit, we gel: involved and we score. No doubt, bodychecking was the key. We have to continue that. We have to think of Monday night's game as the critical one for us.u 
Hitting is also a key for the Rangers, who must rebound from their worst beating ofthe playoffs so far. But they rebounded from a 7-1 loss to Philadelphia in the fourth game of their first-round series to win the decisive game on the road. 

Zoeller wins Heritage golf tourney 
As8odated Press 

HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. ­Fuzzy Zoeller went leaping in the air when a 72nd-hole birdie found the cup and made him a one-stroke win­ner yesterday in the Sea Pines Heritage Classic. 
Zoeller, who blew a two-shot lead with a double bogey on the first hole, capped his comeback with the 12-to 15-foot birdie putt under the shadow ofthe red-and-white striped lighthouse. 
That got him back to par 71 for the struggling round, lifted him out of a multiple-man tie for the top and provided him with his second vic­tory of the season. 
Zoeller, bad back and all, took a skipping step as the ball neared the hole, then went airborne as it dropped in. 
It completed a 72-hole total of 276, 8 under par on the Harbour Town Golf Links, and left Australian 
"It takes a little bit ofsteam out of us," New York goaltender john Van­biesbrouck said. "They're going to gain confidence from this, and we realize that. They had a pretty relent­less forecheck, banging our defen­semen, banging our forecheckers. 
"They were very tenacious and they got those breaks early and then they got confidence and more con­fidence. After a blowout like this, you have to look for the positive. The bright side is we got a split in Washington, but now we've got to come back and take two in New York." 
Montreal also evened its series with Hartford, as Guy Carbonneau scored two goals to lead the Canadiens to a 3· l victory at the Montreal Forum. That series shifts to Hartford tonight.

Borje Salming scored Toronto's other goal with a shot into an open net with 1:13 remaining. Wregget kicked out 35 shots to record his first NHL playoffshutout.

He was followed by Ray Floyd, Tom Kite and Ken Green at 279. None really got in the hunt, and moved up only with fast finishes. Green birdied the last three holes for a 67. Kite had the same. And Floyd shot 66 in the mild, breezy overcast weather. 
Game 3 of the best-of-seven Nor­ris Division final will be played tomorrow night in Toronto. 
By winning, the Maple Leafs snapped a 13-game winless streak on St. Louis ice. Ihnacak opened scoring at 9: 14 of the second period and Fergus scored 1 5 minutes later by tipping in Salming's shot. 
lhnacak picked up a rebound of Greg Terrion's blocked shot to beat sprawling Blues goalie Greg Millen. Fergus' goal, at 4:56 of the final period, came as Blues defenseman Charlie Bourgeois was attempting to tie both him and Toronto right wing Rick Valve up in front of Millen. 
Toronto, while dominating a con­test marked by close checking and numerous player altercations, won for the first time on Arena ice since prevailing 6-3 on Feb. 17, 1983. They were 0-11-2 during the long drought. 
Oilers 6, Flames 5 
EDMONTON -Glenn Anderson scored at I :04 of overtime to give the Edmonton Oilers a 6-5 decision over the Calgary Flames last night to deadlock their NHL smythe Division finals at one victory apiece. 
Anderson took a short pass from 
Dave Lumley, cut to the front of the 
net and pushed a backhand shot into 
the corner. 
Games 3 and 4 of the best-of­seven series will be played in Cal­gary tomorrow and Thursday nights. 
Bernhard Langer of West Ger­many, the defending title-holder, went to a 75 -10 shots higher than his Saturday score-and finished well back at 285. 
Zoeller, a two-shot leader going into the round, lost that when he drove deep into' the woods on the first hole, required four strokes to reach the putting surface and even­tually made double bogey. 
He also made bogey on the third hole and reached the turn in 39. At that point, he was three shots behind Roger Maltbie. 
"I almost let it get out of reach," Zoeller said, "but this is the type of golf course that nobody is going to run away with it." 
He made a long putt, perhaps 30 feet, for birdie on the 11th. Maltbie bogeyed the 14th, missing the green, and Zoeller was back in it when he threw a soft little shot inside ofa foot for a tap-in birdie mo­ments later on the same hole.

"At this point our main concern is protecting the passer.lt's all a matter of consistency on the offensive line and pass protection is essential If we're going to win." 
The Irish round out the 1986 spring with their final week of practice, culminating in the annual Blue-Gold game on Saturday at 1:30. Holtz and his coaching staff will divide the players for the game eit­her tomorrow or Wednesday. 
"(The Blue-Gold game) is for war," Holtz said. "That's a com­pletely different story from a scrimmage. This scrimmage was good in that we needed to get a little competition, and I think we ac­complished some things. But next weekend is for real." 
EXTRA POINTS -Senior tailback Hiawatha Francisco, who under­went arthroscopic knee surgery over the off season and was ex­pected to be sidelined during spring workouts, caught an eight-yard pass in Saturday's scrimmage·: Holtz removed him immediately after­wards, however, saying he "will take no chances."

"Overall, we played quite well throughout the entire game. Our guys were very aggressive and passed well to the open man. Last year Denison embarrassed us. Our kids came out knowing what they had to do which was to be aggressive and to run hard and they did it." 
The Irish started quickly, as Franklin scored his first goal at 12:19 In the first quarter. After senior co­captain Tom Grote scored, Franklin followed with another goal off of a beautiful assist from junior Jim Shields to give the Irish a 3·0 lead.

Holtz names Beuerlein top QB heading to Blue-Gold game 
By MARlY STRASEN 
AssistantSports Editor 
Notre Dame head football coach Lou Holtz has made a key decision regarding his team's quanerback situation. He had vowed earlier in the 1986 spring season to name a number­one quanerback before the upcoming Blue­Gold game. 
That decision was announced after Saturday's scrimmage in Notre Dame Stadium -Steve Beuerlein is the man. 
"I felt going into this scrimmage that Steve Beuedein was number one," Holtz said. "He moved the ball well and didn't make a lot of mistakes today. 
"I thought Terry Andrysiak played well also, but right now Steve is number one because of the overall control he gives us. He throws the ball well, moves the ball well and knows how to handle a team." 
Beuerlein, a junior, combined with sop­homore Terry Andrysiak to lead the blue team in a 39-7 romp over the white team in a scrimmage that was played under game condi­tions. And while Beuerlein moved the blue team downfield seemingly at will, it was sop­homore flanker Tim Brown who stole much of the show. 
Brown, lining up in the backfield when the wishbone offense was used, carried the ball 1 0 times for 13 5 yards, a pair of touchdowns and added three receptions. 
"Our receivers had a very good scrimma2e," Holtz said. "Reggie (Ward), Milt 
Spring Football '86 
Qackson), Alvin (Miller) and Timmy (Brown) all played well. What can you say about Timmy Brown. He's a Notre Dame man in all respects." 
Brown took a Beuerlein pitch into the end zone on a 13-yard scoring play in the first quarter to cap off a 60-yard drive and open the scoring. But the real fireworks began in the second frame for Brown, after freshman Mark Green boosted the first-quarter score to 13-0 when he went over the top on a fourth down and goal from the one-inch line. 
In the ·first minute of the quarter, Brown took a pitch from Andrysiak at his own 35­yard line and headed for the outside. Green provided the first block when he took out a pair ofdefenders and allowed Brown to get to the sideline. Senior receiver Miller made the final block, and Brown used his speed to breeze past everyone on a 65-yard touch­down scamper. 
The white team scoredits onlypoints ofthe scrimmage when junior quarterback Tom Byrne connected on a six-yard touchdown pass to sophomore Kurt Zackrison, usually an outside linebacker. 
The third and final quaner saw more domination by the blue squad, which was -composed of most of the frontrunners for starting jobs in the fall. 
Beuerlien found senior fullback Pernell Taylor open on a roll-out pattern for a five­yard score, and then Green scored his second touchdown of the day when he took an Andrysiak handoff over the goal line from the 
12. Taylor finished the day with 44 yards on nine carries while Green ran the ball six times for 34 yards. 
Fittingly, Beuerlein finished the scoring on the last play of the day when he teamed up with Miller on a 14-yard touchdown. 
Holtz was pleased with his team's progress and still sees the offensive line as crucial to his squad's chances for success. 
"Overall, I saw some good progress made," he said. "I was pleased with our ability to eliminate the lost yardage and I thought the hitting was awful good on defense. There were some great hits from (Wally) KJeine, (Robert) Banks and (Cedric) Figaro. I think we have an idea of what we have to do and that's important.

JOE ZAWINFUL 
On Joe Zawinful's new solo album, "Dialects," he brings the folk sounds of the 
world into 11is jazz. 

BY GREG PTACEK 
M 
usic fans know Joe Zawinful's music far better than his name. 
Mention Weather Report, and 
almost everyone calls them their favorite jazz band. Even those who aren't intimately familiar with their music know the tune of "Birdland," the hit sin­gle he wrote for the mega-album Heavy Weather (1977). Mention his name, and the response tends to be, "Zawin what?", except from those jazz afficionados who know to rank him with Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck and a handful of other modern jazz masters. 
That's o.k. with Joe. He would much 
rather be a musician-artist than a musi­
cian-celebrity Born in a Slavic town of 58 
people in rural Austria, he's never left his 
roots, emotionally or intellectually. Dia­
lects, his first solo album since co-found­
ing Weather Report with Wayne Shorter, 
reflects his respect for farm people and 
their folk music, whether from Austria, 
Africa, Asia or Australia. 
On a recent sunny California morning, 
Zawinful sipped coffee poolside at his 
I"Jsadena home on a hill overlooking the 
Rose Bowl. His house reflects his person­
ality: down to earth, more comfortable 
than hip, pets everywhere. 
He shared his thoughts on his album, the impending break-up of Weather Re­port, Sting as a jazz artist, rock 'n' roll, the future of jazz and the recording industry 
CEG: Why did you decide to make a solo album now? 
]Z: I've wanted to make this album for I 5 years, but my work with Weather Re­port always precluded it. When you put out an album, sometimes two albums, ev­ery year, there just isn't time. Several of the songs, though, I had written many years ago. It only took me two months to put it together. With Wayne [Shorter] do­ing his own album, it finally gave me an opportunity to do mine. 
CEG What's the future for Weather Re­port, now that you and Wayne Shorter are off on your own? 
4 
Ampersand 
]Z: Weather Report has a new album coming outApril15. The band will proba­bly tour between June and November, but we might have to bury the name. Wayne has his own band now and isn't part of Weather Report anymore. Wayne and I share the copyright for the name, so we probably can't go under that name. If we can't, then it's very likely we will call the band Weather Update. 
CEG: What kind of research did you do to capture the international sound you've achieved on Dialects? 
]Z: Absolutely none. The album is just my impression of the many peoples and places I have visited. I was not trying to imitate other culture's music. I don't even know any African or Japanese music. If it sounds authentic, it's because I'm a good listener. The music I created was based more on people's speaking patterns than anything else. 

CEG: How are jazz and folk related? 
]Z: To me, jazz is simply improvised rhythmic music with a heavy folklore background. Pure jazz is improvisation. All of Dialects is improvised; in fact, two of the tunes, "The Harvest" and "Zee Bop," are total improvisation-com­posed, played and recorded simulta­neously. And all the others were impro­vised, but the sound of the original improvisation was not good enough, so I recorded them again. There was no mas­ter blueprint to the album. That would take the pure soul away That would be like trying to prepare yourself to tell a girl you love her. How do you practice some­thing like that? 
CEG: How has rock 'n' roll affected your music? 
]Z: To be perfectly honest, rock has never had any effect on my music, aes­thetically Certainly, there have been great rock musicians. Jimi Hendrix comes immediately to mind. But Weather Report was not influenced by them. We're really a traditional jazz band, in the sense of Ellington and Louis Armstrong, that continues to explore new territory 
I grew up as an accordion player, play­ing with gypsies and playing folk music. Folk music is in my blood and my bones, and therefore I love jazz. Rock 'n' roll used to be great, or at least some of it, but I honestly could not name live rock musi­oans that I like, that I consider to be ex­cellent. My kids listen to that stuff, and I do like the Talking Heads. 
CEG: What do you think of the recent synthesis of pop and jazz, say, for exam-pie on Sting's Dream ofthe Blue Turtles? 
]Z: He's more of a jazz musician than a rock musician. The Police invented their own brand of music and they've said they are very influenced by Weather Report. In one interview, Sting actually said he is try­ing to emulate my vision but in a song form with lyrics, etc. 
But pop musicians like Sting are so rare. If I were to work with him, I could make him into a superior jazz singer. He's got a great voice, number one. He's got really good rhythm concepts, he's a musi­cian-a good bass player and he's got confidence. All the ingredients are there. 
CEG: What's holding jazz back from reaching a wider audience? 
]Z: The powers that control the record­ing industry don't want jazz to be great. If jazz becomes great, then what happens to all that other junk that so much time and money has been invested into? If you own a restaurant and you really think you've got a shot at making a lot of money by selling your version of junk food, you're going to ignore someone who tells you to serve really good food so that peo­ple know what it's like. 
It's the same thing in the record indus­try. Most people who run the industry are in it because they like to listen to music, and it's an easy job. They have no qualifi­cations. They get a big expense account and can take their favorite stars to lunch. And whoever shakes more hands is the most powerful. 
I was never a handshaker. I'm not inter­ested in power lunches. I'd rather eat lunch here with my wife and kids. I am a musician. I don't need cocktail parties. + 
Joe Zawinlul studies an upcoming project in his unpretentious home stu­dio. Uninterested in the trappings of pop stardom, the jazz musician comes across as aregular guy­who just happens to be a musical genius.

TOP GUN 



BY JIMMY SUMMERS 
hen the time came to cast the part of Maverick Mitchell, the best young Navy pilot in the air, the producers of Top Gun had only one actor in mind. 
That was Tom Cruise. With relatively few roles to 
his credit, Cruise has become one of the most 
sought after andpopularyoungperformers in mo­
tion pictures. 


breed, a description most readily sup­ported by the pilots. During the produc­tion of Top Gun, Tom Cruise met many a Top Gunner and one of them summed up his slightly immodest attitude about his line of work by saying "there are only four occupations worthy of a man: actor, rock star, jet fighter pilot or President of the United States." That's not the sort of statement you get from a shrinking violet. 
It's also not an attitude that's overly tol­erant with outsiders. But Tom Cruise managed nonetheless to earn the pilots' respect. Said one Top Gun pilot: "Tom took his role very seriously. He looked like a pilot, studied like a pilot and some­times even partied like a pilot. Fortunate­ly, for him, he still made the salary of a movie star." 
The pilot Cruise plays in Top Gun is considered one of the best in the Navy's program. But Maverick Mitchell is achiev­ing his success without necessarily play­ing by the rules. He prefers to fly by in­stinct, a notion that keeps him in hot water with his superiors. He may win more dogfights than any other pilot, but he's only a few steps away from being booted out of the program. 
Matters are only worsened when he falls in love with a civilian specialist as­signed to the program. Playing Charlotte Blackwood, the forbidden love interest, is Kelly McGillis. You might remember McGillis from an even more complicated romance in Witness, when she played the Amish widow in love with Harrison Ford's Philadelphia detective. 
Rounding out the cast are more of Hol­lywood's promising new faces. Playing Maverick's radar intercept officer-his one partner in the air-is Anthony Ed­wards of Revenge of the Nerds and Got­cha. Playing his chief competition for the distinction of top Top Gunner is Val Kil­mer of Top Secret!and Real Genius. 
Also in the cast are Tom Skerritt, play­ing the Top Gun commanding officer and Michael Ironsides, playing the Top Gun instructor. + 
From his first appearance on screen in Taps, Cruise had a certain something that made him stand out from the rest of the crowd. By the time he starred in Risky Business, dancing in his underwear to the music of Bob Seger, the world knew it had a new star. Certain people just can't be held back from achieving success, and it seemed obvious that Cruise was one of those special people. 
Now Cruise is playing a character that might be described in just the same way. Lt. Pete "Maverick" Mitchell is also a golden boy, but he's a golden boy of the sky. He's an F-14 fighter pilot who's been selectively chosen to participate in the Navy's prestigious Fighter Weapons School, or as it is known to the pilots, the Top Gun program. 
The few who are privileged to be Top Gun students are chosen from the Navy's top air crews. Because the Navy's F-14 pi­lots already represent the best the Navy has to offer, the Top Gunners are the best of the best, the excelling elite. After an 
Ampersand 
intensive program that includes simulat­ed in-air dogfights and hours of class­room study, the Top Gun graduates re­turn to their commands and share their new expertise with the other crews in their squadron. 
These aerial cowboys are a special

Mike Rutherford 
A 
sa founding member of Genesis, 
guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford 
was instrumental in creating the 
progressive rock sound of the '70s. While the hand has always operated as a collective unit, its frontmen, notably Peter Gabriel and, following his depar­ture, Phil Collins, received the lions' shares of publicity. 
But the success of Mike and the Me­chanics, both the name of his new group and solo album, has brought Rutherford into the spot I ight. 
Mike and the Mechanics is actually Rutherford's third solo album, hut the first to make a splash in the U.S., largely as a result of the single, "Silent Running." The song not only shot up the record · charts but spawned a Number One MTV video, putting an end to the suggestions 
that Genesis was nothing without Phil Collins. 
Still, Rutherford admits he prefers working in the context of a group rather than as a solo artist. "This album doesn't feel like a solo album," he says, "because I've developed and presented the album differently; hence the group name: Mike and the Mechanics. It feels very much like a group. It's a lot more fun working with others than on your own." 
Most of the album's songs were written by Rutherford and producer Chris Neal, whom he credits with choosing the right material. Genesis co-founder Tony Banks and Phil Collins co-wrote "A Call to Arms," an old song Genesis never re­corded that I've always liked." Paul Car­rack and Paul Young (the former lead singer of the group Sad Cafe, not the Paul Young of "Everytime You Go Away") handle the vocals. 
Rutherford is currently at work on the new Genesis album and readying for a world tour with the group beginning in September. As if Genesis and Mike and the Mechanics weren't enough, he is also working with another band, Virginia Woolf, which includes Jason Bonham, the son of the late Led Zeppelin drum­

T
he reunion of Led Zeppelin for "Live Aid" last summer prompted a flurry of rumors of a possible re­union album by the supergroup. Those suggestions, hopes and prayers were extinguished quickly by Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, the former pursu­ing a successful solo career and the latter involved with The Firm. But now come published reports in England that a Led Zeppelin album will be recorded this year with Plant, P'Jge and John Paul]ones. Power Station's Tony Thompson will fill in for the late John Bonham. The four are said to be currently rehearsing, with plans to go into the studio in late April. While no official announcement has been forth­coming, The Firm has limited its U.S. tour to only six dates, leaving Page available in April ... Miami Vice co-stars Don john­son and Philip Michael Thomas have new record projects in the works. Johnson's upcoming solo album will feature songs by former Allman Brothers' Band guitarist Dickey Betts, who is also working on an album of his own. Thomas is beginning a musical based on the age-old blues song "Staggerlee." He envisions the song first as the inspiration for a thematic album, then as a Broadway musical and finally as a TV movie. Thomas says it will feature music from the roaring '20s to the '80s .. The Pretenders are currently in studio, completing tracks for their follow-up to 1983's Leaming To Crawl ... The Roll­ing Stones' new album, Dirty Work, car­ries a dedication to Ian Stewart, founding member and keyboard player who died last December of a heart attack at the age of 47.

It was really just for fun." Yeah, well don't forget, they said the same thing about disco.

WHERE GREAT ENTERTAINMENT BEGINS 
Director-writer-producer John Hughes, known for his uncannily sensi· live and on-the-mark portraits of high school teenagers in The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink, cuts class for aday on the town in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. 
F 
erris Beuller's Day Off, says John Hughes, "is about this high school kid who cuts class and goes to the big city for the day with his best friend and girlfriend. But, it really is about personal freedom and how differ­ent things are when you have decided for just one day to be free." 
Hughes, world class creator and cutter of films ranging from Mr. Mom to Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club, is perched on the edge ofa long grey couch at his offices at Paramount Studios in Hol­lywood. With the exception of Stephen Spielberg, no recent young filmmaker has enjoyed such speedy success. During the past three years or so, his efforts have made hundreds of millions of dollars and displayed the comic verve and range of a Charlie Chaplin or Woody Allen. Just by

making movies about kids. 
Some, like The Breakfast Club, are tightly choreographed, literate ballets. One or two others, like the National Lampoon's Summer Vacation, may have had their most crucial scenes conjured on the back of a cocktail napkin. 
But, mostly, Hughes' work is ambi­tious, smart, riveting and funny And no current movie maker is as good at mixing belly laughs with heart and compassion. Ferris Beul!er is his latest. 
"It's about freedom from worry Ferris doesn't worry, doesn't sweat anything. It's also about a change in reality If you've ever stayed home from school or work for reasons other than being sick, you see how different the world looks." 
Hughes looks far less like the stereo­typical tanned Hollywood mogul than, 

BY MARK CHRISTENSEN 

say, a rather bookish member of an En­glish rock band. Tall. An explosive mane of long, dark blond hair. Glasses. A black cloth coat, thoroughly wrinkled silver slacks and a white shirt with sleeves so long that his cuffs touch his knuckles. 
''I'd much rather be a musician than a movie maker, but I'm just about tone deaf. To me, tuning a guitar correctly is one of the world's major mysteries." Nev­ertheless, his aggressive use of new mu­sic has become a stock in trade. "Simple Minds sold 50,000 albums until 'Don't You· broke on Breakfast Club. 
"But there will be a change with the music on Ferris. What I want to do is use a big sound, a state of the art production using edge bands that press the enve­lope-or whatever the space people call it-bands like Zig-Zag Sputnik, then, couple that with a more accessible sound. 
"I want to focus my movies on bands who have the right to be heard by the great Top Forty masses. New stuff. Be­cause, like, when I go to Chicago, I listen to three stations and get nothing but San­tana and 'Layla.' It's like somebody fell asleep on the 1972 button." 
A former writer for National Lampoon, Hughes left the magazine several years ago to write what are popularly perceived as "teen flicks," a realm previously domi­nated by big breasts, beer drinking and fart jokes. His efforts (usually) to elevate the genre have made for films that re­create adolescence with an energy, in­ventiveness and exactitude that can be drop dead eerie. 
Who can forget Anthony Michael Hall in Sixteen Candles, the kid with the spi­dery hands and concave chest who, while wooing Molly Ringwald, allows, some­what parenthetically, that his social status in the school is insured by the fact that he is "king of the dipshits." Or, later, when he wakes after a drunken night of evident­debauchery and de-virginizing with his high school's brassiest sexpot, the new, rather blithely unanchored Hall asking her, "Did I enjoy it?" 


JOHN HUGHES: 
Making the Movies 
Young People Love 
Hughes' enthusiasm for these kinds of shenanigans is surprising in light of the fact that his own adolescent experience was not idylic. "In high school, I was a serious outcast, a laughingstock. I took it. I took it and I thought, Til show you; I'll show you.' This was, like, in 1967. 
"I went to a jock-y school. We had a serious dress code. I almost didn't gradu­ate, because my hair touched my collar." 
"Back then, I wanted to be Picasso, Mi­chelangelo, James Joyce or Bob Dylan. That's where I took my solace. People would make fun of me, and I'd think, 'That's okay. Picasso would like me.' I'd come home at night, and I'dsitat my win­dow and put on my albums and read my British music magazines. I didn't want to belong, because I couldn't belong." 
"The guy who was the teacher in Breakfast Club was my gym teacher. He didn't like me because of my hair, so he flunked me senior year in gym, which meant, to graduate, I had to take double gym and health. You know, sit in class and look at YO-ravaged genitals and slide shows about how to brush your teeth." 
Were other characters in his films taken directly from experience? "Yeah. The jerk rich kid in Pretty in Pink. I had a guy like him haunt me all the way through high school. Money to burn. His older brother had an Alfa, the big nice one, and parked it outside with the top down in the rain. I would walk by and see the rose­wood buckling on the dash. I couldn't un­derstand how kids could live like that. I just wasn't part of that world." 
And college was scarcely an improve­ment. "I hated it intensely I was enor­mously homesick and felt completely displaced ... I went to college in Arizo­na, a big party school, a big fraternity school. The anti-war movement was very small, and the cops were very tough . 
"I was desperately in love with my wife, who was then my girlfriend. She was still in high school. I spent $1,000 first semester just on phone bills. 
"I had problems with the social nature

of the school. I wasn't a fraternity type. 
And I had a knack for attracting hostile 
authority figures. I mean, during the Rev­
olutionary War I would have been OVl'r at 
Torn l~tyne·~ house saying, '!ley, let's get 
some boats, cross the Atlantic and make 
them live under US for a while'." Finally, 
after two or thrl'l' and a halfyears, Hughes 
got a belly full of academia 1nd, on hear­
ing John Lennon's"Working Class llero", 
decided to head hack home. 
Conditions did not improve immedi­ately. "Nancy and I· -she was 20, I was 21-I ived in a converted boxcar. The rent wa~ only $110 a month. But, we couldn't­make it and ended up living in my par­ents' hastmtnt for eight months." But things gotlwtter. After !;tiling the"writing ttsts"of half the ad agencies in Chicago, he got a job at Leo Burnett where he final­ly found a niche. 
"I went to work in the day and came home in the dark. I started at $H,';OO a year, doubled my salary within six months and doubled it again a year after 1hat. I just kept eating up bosses. One time the guy above nlt' did an ad the com­pany didn'tlike. I asked for a shot at it and stayed up all night doing sixteen varia­tions on the idea I had. They liked one and, the next thing I knew, I had his job. I was a creative director at 2') or 26." 
Then came Nationall.ampomz, where I lughes filled upwards of 120 magazine page~ a year with stories like "Sexual! lar­rassml'llt: IIow to Do II." The rest, as they say, is history. 
So, has success changed .John Hughes? Evidently, not much. llughes still spends as much time as possible back home in Chicago. "I still own a house there. 1just put a new roof on it, so, if there are winos living there while I'm gone, they won't get wet. I don't mix much socially out here. I've only gone to two so-called 'lloll)'wood' parties in my life, one be­cause l'.j. O'Rourke made me, and the other because it was an MTV premiere for 
Pre/~)' ill Pink." 
Big Money doesn't seem to interest 
him either. "I've got a business manager I 
haven't seen in a year and a half. Basically, 
I know I'm better off now because I can 
afford to buy lots more records." 
But what about the future? "I'd like to 
have my own building, my own opera­
tion. I'm not that nuts about movie lots. 
I'd like to write a hook, maybe a novel, 
but I don't think I've mastered that form 
yet. I'd love to do some 9,000 page thing. 
''I've got another film scheduled to start shooting this summer, Some Kind of \Hmdet:fill. It's college, my first foray into college. It's about the difference between the first year and the last, the struggle for dignity and identity. 
"Right now, I'm making two movies a year with very direct involvement. But I could do three a year, produce two and direct one. The thing is, I've got a million ideas. It's choosing which ones to exe­cute that's tough." 

Above: As the class-cutting lead in Ferris Beul/er's Day Off, Matthew Broderick indulges in some serious relax­ation. Hughes describes his film about the high schooler's day on the lam as "about personal freedom," and "a change in reality. If you've ever stayed home from school or work for reasons other than being sick, you realize how different the world looks."

inspired by areal-life Hughes high

AFINE MESS

aurei and Hardy would he pleased. 
The humbling silliness of the his­
toric comic duo is the inspiration 
for director Blake Edwards' new film, A Fine Mess, starring Ted Danson and Howie Mandel as two equally hum­bling ne'er-do-wells. 
Laurel and Hardy would seem to he a natural for the director who, with Peter Sellers, created the modern master of bumble, Inspector Clouseau, in the Pink Panther films. Indeed, "They were Blake's favorite comedy team," com­mented co-star Mandel. 
Although loosely based on a classic short by the comic legends, A Fine Mess, "is more of an homage," said Mandel. "It

was originally called The Music Box, which was the famous Laurel and Hardy short with them trying to get a piano up a flight of stairs. But this movie is a com­pletely original story It's very physical comedy, wacky, with chases-! guess it has a little piece of every one of their movies in that sense." 
"1 play Dennis Powell, a roller-skating hamburger stand waiter who's been working his whole life to save up for his own fast-food restaurant. Ted Danson plays his huddy, a movie extra whose dream is to become a big star. This story is about the "fine mess" he (Danson) gets us into when he sees something he's not supposed to see." 
John Carpenter turns his weird sensibilities to Chinatown in Big Trouble in Little China. Kurt Russell (second from right) stars as an adventurer who helps afriend (Dennis Dunn, second from left) find his kidnapped wife. 

BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA 

W 
elcome to dinner in China­town in john Carpenter's /3ig Trouble in Little China. After you finish the tea and the dim­sum, how about a stroll through the un­derworld, with such exotic attractions as the "Room of the Upside-Down Hell" the "Honorable Hall of the Infernal judge?" 
You'll know you're in big trouble when you bump intojack Burton (Kurt Russell) and his pig hauling truck, the Pork Chop Express. jack is helping his friend Wang Chi (Dennis Dun) recover his lost green­eyed bride kidnapped by Lo Pan (James Hong) and his fiendish thugs. 
Aided by Gracie Law, a sensuous attor­ney played by Kim Cattral, and Egg Shen (Victor Wong), a clairvoyant bus driver, jack and Wang enter an imaginary under­world ruled by Lo Pan. According to leg­end, Lo Pan is a cold-blooded spirit im­prisoned in hell by the First Emperor of China, who can only regain his virility by coupling with that one-in-a-million green-eyed woman. 
Pretty kinky, huh? Big Trouble starts off as an action-adventure-comedy, shifts into high gear as bizarre circumstances mount and winds up as a kung fu-mon­ster-ghost story Whew! 
"It's an ensemble piece, and it's very complex," says Carpenter, who is famous for his low-budget, gripping thrillers like Halloween and Christine. 
However, Big Trouble is a $25-million production, filmed mostly in Los Angeles with a great deal of special effects from fiery explosives to an 8-foot human skull which emits eerily-colored smoke. 
But stripped of its haunting facade, the basic premise of Big Trouble is still good guys versus bad guys. This ancient tradi­tion of story-telling "goes back to the days of Ulysses and Shakespeare," Car­penter says. And, though it may sound simplistic, Carpenter believes that's the key to every one of his films: sheer fun intertwined with subtle messages. 
-Albert Pang 
Will Rodney Dangerfield (left) finally get some re­spect? Maybe in his new film, Back to School, where he plays abusinessman who goes back to college. 


BACK TO SCHOOL 
' '~ movie's hard," says Rod­
ney Dangerfield, his long 
doleful face looking more 
sorrowful than ever. "When you're telling jokes to a camera, you don't get much of a response. Know what I mean?" It's not much solace to a man who's used to making millions laugh that the cameraman and the boom opera­tor are trying to keep from falling down with laughter while filming Back to School, Dangerfield's latest movie. 
"They're laughing because they weren't expecting that," says director Alan Metter. "Rodney makes up material all the time. I leave at the end of the day, exhausted from shooting. He goes home to polish jokes and continue to work. 
In Back to School, Dangerfield plays a self-made millionaire who signs on as a freshman at college in order to help his shy son through a bad time. It's a comedy of errors with Dangerfield triumphing in spite of himself amid the usual comple­ment of rapid-tire one-liners.

THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS 
J 
ust when you thought it was safe to go back to the greenhouse ... along comes The Little Shop Of Horrors, with Audrey II, its people-eating plant. Director Frank Oz (of Muppets fame) says cheerfully, "By the time we're finished, the entire cast is eaten. I know a lot of directors will envy that." 
You probably would love Audrey II, if you could see her, but, until the movie is released, she's being kept under wraps. ''Alii can say is she sings, she dances, she dials the phone, and she eats people," says Lyle Conway, her designer. Those who have seen her say she starts out small and sexy, and, fed human beings, grows to truly huge proportions. 
Audrey II first proved her popularity in the original Little Shop, a low-budget Roger Corman film made 25 years ago. ("We spent $40,000 on ours," says Cor­man ruefully. "This one is $20 million.") Four years ago, Little Shop ofHorrors was resurrected as an off-off-Broadway musi­cal comedy. Its success encouraged Warner Bros. to reprise it on film. 
"It's not a big, splashy Hollywood mu­sical," says Henson. "The music is an in­tegral part of the story and moves the plot forward. We haven't opened up the plot so much as we've enriched it." 
The action takes place in Mushnick's Flower Shop in a rundown part of town. Seymour (Rick Moranis), a nerdy floral assistant, buys a strange little plant and names it for his girlfriend Audrey 
Having no awe of the Hollywood star system, the plant snacks happily on cast members Steve Guttenberg, Bill Murray, Paul Dooley, Vincent Gardenia, et al­though not necessarily in that order.

one of us could wait to getdown on location," says Twiggy, who stars with Robin Williams and Peter O'Toole in Harold Ramis' (Ghostbusters) new film Club Paradise. "I had just come from a film set in Eng­land, where it was freezing cold," said the actress and former model who set the style for London's swinging sixties."We all were so glad to be in the sun, we would have played the phone book. As it turned out, it was a very, very funny script, so we were lucky in all ways." Club Paradise is a comic mixture of ro­mance, revolution and seedy resorts, written by Ramis. "It also includes a smarmy Englishman, which I play," says Simon Jones (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Brideshead Revisited). "It's a

small but nasty part, and I liked playing it, especially in Jamaica. 
"Robin Williams plays the good guy He's a fireman from Chicago who wisely decides he's had enough of cold and snow and fighting fires. He comes to Par­adise, where he not so wisely decides to invest in a rundown resort hotel with Jim­my Cliff, who is having trouble with the local corrupt politicos. Along the way, Robin manages to attract the cook and first mate of my yacht to his enterprise. Since the mate is Twiggy, you can under­stand my deep resentment." 
There's Peter O'Toole's sun-drenched Governor General, who hates to have his cushy life disturbed. And there's his girl­friend, a travel writer who wants to report on world events and sees her destiny in an island revolution. 
"In fact, things were so complicated," says Simon Jones, "that Harold was the 
only  one who  knew what  was  going  
on."  -Joan Go odman

Olympic gold medalist Mitch Gaylord re­turns to the world of gymnastics, but this time as an actor who plays a young man trying to compete while dealing with peer, coaching and parental pressures. Janet Jones plays his girl, and Albert Mag­noli-who helped Prince film Purple 
Rain-is writer and director. 

Far Left: Daryl Hannah sit­ting pretty in Ivan Reitman's new romantic action comedy, LegalEa­gles. Left: George Lucas, David Bowie and Jim Henson combine artistic energies in the fantasy adventure, Labyrinth. 

JUNE 27 <> RUNNING SCARED-Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines play-of all things-"rugged undercover cops" in this action comedy set in the badlands of Chicago. 
JUNE 27 o RAW DEAL-When will those bad guys ever learn? You just don't cross Arnold Schwarzenegger. Here he deals with Chicago mobsters. Guess who's left standing? 
JUNE 27 <> RUTHLFSS PEOPLE-Bette Midler stars as a kidnap victim no one wants-not her millionaire husband, not her hapless kidnappers, no one. Seems she's a bit hard to get along with (not Bette!). Danny DeVito and Judge Reinhold co-star. The directors are the loons who created Airplane!: Zucker, Zucker and Abrams. 
JULY o HEARTBURN-The intriguing star pairing ofMeryl Streep andJack Nich­olson would probably make a movie in-
Kelly McGillis (Witness) and in-training navy fighter pilot Tom Cruise combine forces in Top Gun. Al­though Cruise is in arisky business, he gets serious for this flick.

JULY o SHORT CIRCUIT-Haywire wir­ing turns a military robot into an AWOL peace activist. Steve Guttenberg is the sci­entist on the robot's trail and Ally Sheedy is the mechanical rebel's new friend. 
JULY 2 <> THE LimE SHOP OF HOR­RORS-First it was a low-budget movie. Then it was an off-Broadway musical. Now it's a big-budget movie musical. It's the story of a nerdy flower shop employ­ee and his people-eating plant which eats and eats until it has swallowed most of the cast. Rick Moranis stars, and Steve Martin and Bill Murray have cameos. 
JULY 2 <> PSYCHO ID-Last time we saw Norman Bates, he was giving his

ON THE 
ROAD 
A 
s we go to press, there is still some doubt whether the Rolling Stones will tour in 1986 in support of their new album Dirty Work. Keith Richards startled reporters when he announced that MickJagger has nixed plans to go on the road this year. "Mick is the only one preventing us from touring," said Rich­ards. ''As far as I'm concerned, the Stones should go on the road. We have a good album coming out and we would all en­joy it" . . . Van Halen launched their eight-month American tour on March 27 in Shreveport, La ... This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Monkees and in­side sources say there will he a celebra­tion world tour to honor the event with at least three and possibly all four of the original members . . . Faces, the early '70s hard rock group that included Rod Stewart, Ron Wood and Ronnie Lane, will reunite for a one-time only reunion concert later this spring. Proceeds from benefit concert will go to fight both ltiple Sclerosis (the disease Lane is af-JJicted with) and AIDS. Look for a possi­ble MTV simulcast ... Yoko Ono brings her "Starpeace" world concert tour to the States, beginning April lOth in New York City. . Emerson, Lake and Powell plan to hit the road in April may be delayed because several custom-built keyboards to be used during the tour have been damaged. Seems a tractor accidentally crashed through Keith Emerson's studio 

in Sussex, England, where the keyboards were housed ... Frank Sinatra, Lionel Richie, Kenny Rogers and Willie Nel­son will star together in a concert at the Meadowlands in New York during the weekend of July 4th to mark the closing of the lOOth anniversary celebration of the Statue of Liberty ... ELO's first tour in four years began in England on March 15. The event, called "Heartbeat '86," was a benefit concert for a local children's hos­pital ... Miami Sound Machine, the first act in the history of Billboard Magazine to appear on the pop, black, Latin and dance charts simultaneously, has launched its first U.S. tour. They just wrapped up a 9-month tour in the rest of the world ... Ozzy OsHboume's tour, which hit the U.S. in March, features an elaborate stage set that includes a 50-foot winged monster with an Ozzy face, a creature last seen on the cover of his cur­rent album, The Last Sin ... The Firm kicked off their U.S. tour in Tampa, Flori­da on March 14 ... Pat BenaHtar wrapped up her 30-city tour in Honolulu on April 5 with a very positive note: "It just seems that live concerts are the one thing that never gets old, the one thing I never get tired of" ... Big Country has begun a British tour in support of its new album. No plans yet for the States ... Autograph, the American hard rock band, and Autograph, the Russian band that appeared on "Live Aid," have both been invited to perform at the \\lncouver World Fair this summer. (The big ques­tion, of course, is whether they'll ask for each other's autographs) ... Simple Minds' current U.S. tour will run through May. 
Top: Dramatic Ozzy Osbourne currently on tour ... Let's hope this al­bum win be his last sin. Center: Van Halen on tour with Sammy Hagar as the pseudo David Lee Roth. Right: Will the prolific Mick join up with The Rolling Stones for their new album's tour?

Do you hear dump trucks roaring through your living room when you watch TV? 

If you hear bullets ricocheting across your living room, turbulent water falls crashing down the stairs when you watch TV, you possibly already have a Teledap­ter. However, if you don't, read on. 
Hyou have a TV and a stereo system you can enjoy the excitement you've been missing ... now! ·The Teledapter's unique electronics will combine your TV and stereo into a powerful entertainment center that would easily cost thousands of dollars. Imagine having the best front row seats in town for your ball games, musicals, and movies. 
Teledapter works with any TV, VCR, or satellite receiver, regardless of age or model, and conveniently plugs into the auxiliary, tape, or tuner input on any stereo amplifier or receiver system. All TV, satellite, cable, and VCR programs will have the same powerful sound as your stereo system and speakers. 
HOW 
All Teledapters contain Stereo-Plex111 syn~ thesizer circuitry for all mono TV's and VCR's. It transforms their sound into sparkling twO<hannel stereo effects. Got a stereo TV or VCR? No problem. Just plug them in (TE~250). Since most TV and cable programming is mono, the Stereo-Plex circuitry will pick up where your stereo TV or VCR stops short. 
Mono sounds, even when played through two speakers, appear to come from one direction-the center. 
Stereo sounds come from two directions. The stereo/ mono test is really simple: Plug the Teledapter up, push the

the test without a Teledapter, and a mono signal will remain in the center. 

The TE-100 Tele­
syn­thesizer circuit. Its 
one isolated low 
TE-100 impedance input allows it to be connected directly to the speaker terminals or earphone jack of the TV, and then its left and right outputs are plugged into the left and right inputs on the stereo. The isolated input provides total chassis isolation between the TV and stereo for complete protection of both components. The TV and stereo may be located any distance apart. 
BETTER 
The TE-200 has all of the same qualities of the TE-100, plus a Type 2 Stereo-Plex synthesizer that gives more defined stereo separation; plus a high impedance input that allows the TE-200 to be connected directly off your VCR audio output, which is convenient if your TV doesn't have any outputs; plus an output level control for optimum level adjustment of the audio signal. 

BEST 
The TE-250 has all of the qualities of both the TE-100 and TE-200, plus a Type 3 Stereo-Plex1'11 synthesizer for even greater defined separation; plus the latest integrated circuit design; plus stereo inputs that allow this unit to be used with a stereo, VCR, or TV; plus a bypass fea­ture allowing the synthesizer to be cut off, allowing a stereo source to pass through; plus multiple inputs that expand the input capabilities of your stereo; plus a tape monitor loop that allows the TE-250 to be used with everything coming through your stereo-AM, tapes, records, etc.
