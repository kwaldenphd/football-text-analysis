INSIDE COLUMN 

There should be limits to "free speech" 
Over 200 years ago  an  Sarah Doran  
amendment  to  the  
Constitution was ratified that  News Copy Editor  

prohibited congress from--------+ making a law that would prohibit free speech. This privilege has come up against a few walls during its existence, including the Sedition act of 1798 which prohibited malicious writing against the government and the Espionage act of 1917 prohibiting anything that would cause disloyalty. Both of these acts would have extremely hampered the constitutionally given right of free speech, if they remained in existence. 
We do not know what the United States would be like without free speech. Certainly, the forces that govern would be quite different and life in general would not be as we now know it. 
We are most definitely better ofT with the first amendment. 
But. there is another light with which to view the press and its first amendment given rights ....... the light that shines on those individuals that the never satisfied press chooses to dig into. 
Sure, I read People magazine and join a rather large group when I say that I, too, am interested in the latest bit of Hollywood gossip. Its actually really funny and I guess a break from the heavy news issues that bombard us in each morning's headlines. 
But what about those rather innocent victims that the press bites its teet)l into to get its fill of tear jerking stories for the day. Are they what sells papers? Is it these stories that persuade us to buy a paper each morning and tune into watch Tom, Peter, or Dan each night? 
The media glare that has been east upon the Notre Dame swim team asks the question of whether or not tragedy spells financial prosperity for those who write about it. 
First there was the initial coverage the week of the bus accident. When a swimmer injured in the aecident required addition surgery during the summer for injuries sustained in the aecident, in came the glare. Just recently, the first anniversary of the tragedy was observed, again with these extra lights around. 
Over the last year, it has been plastered in papers around the country. These papers include the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune in addition to small papers from middle of nowhere America and of course there was the Sports Illustrated spread. Lets not forget the long segments on broadcast on television stations whieh included CNN and ESPN. 
The press invaded the lives of the swimmers. As if the tragedy hadn't made their lives hard enough already. 
Is this what the framers meant all those years ago? Is it the freedom of the press to do to your life what it wants. Or, do individuals in society ~ust have tragedy deficits whose insatiable appetites cannot be satisfied with their own problems, thus turning them to prey on the sadness of others.

Gore: Cuts to be announced Olsen named NO's first 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Vice President Gore said Sunday the administration would announce spending cuts this week to prove President Clinton is serious about eliminating government waste before asking Americans to pay higher taxes. 
The Cabinet-level National Economic Council met with the president at the White House for a detailed review of the federal budget and the president's economic program. 
Before that, in a television talk show appearance, Gore pre­dicted, "You're going to see an­nouncements this coming week that will demonstrate quite clearly that the experience Bill Clinton has in balanced budgets is being brought to bear in weeding out the unnecessary wasteful kind of spending that's just been allowed to go on for too long." 
"Then we're going to ask those who benefited the most from the last 12 years, unfairly, to pay their fair share," Gore said in an interview on ABC­TV's "This Week with David Brinkley." 
Gore did not specify the cuts but he said they would make it "unmistakably clear that we have been wrestling with the guts of these very difficult deci­>ions." 
A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the first of the announcements, probably on Tuesday, would focus on cutting the White House staff. 
Labor Secretary Robert Reich, appearing on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," said Clinton is going through the budget himself "in excruciating detail" and would not approve cuts that will hurt the poor or middle class. 
"The president is asking de­tailed questions. Who's this go­ing to hurt if we cut it? Who's going to gain? Is this something we need? And he takes his pen and he crosses it out. This is a budget-cutting president. ... But he's doing it very carefully," Reich said. 
Meanwhile, Republicans sug­gested Clinton could most effec­tively reduce spending by scrapping his economic stimulus program, which they said is no longer needed.

for him to run against a fellow black man. 
"People say I can't run against a brother ... but white guys run against white guys all the time," Innis said. "That (way of thinking) is not diver­sity-not political diversity." 
Innis called this counter revo­lution a "reign of intellectual terror," a reign in which it is politically incorrect to challenge common black thought. Such questioning, however relevant, is considered "treason if you are black, and racism if you are white," according to Innis. 
"Every revolution that be­comes tyrannical-whether physically or intellectually-is doomed for failure," he added. 
The signs of this failure have begun to manifest themselves in the violence in the streets and turmoil in many inner-city African American communities, according to Innis. Such serious problems cannot be blamed on poor relations between blacks and whites, he said, but rather the burden falls upon the single, narrow, "intellectually stagnated" ideological spectrum of thought within the urban centers. 
"If all the white folks go to the moon, we'd have problems in black America the next day," Innis said. 
helpful, according to Beauchamp, because the top issue for the UW may not be the top priority for all charitable help. 
The third addition imple­mented during Beauchamp's term is the donor choice pro­gram. This program allows donors to designate the pro­gram that they want their money to go towards. 
Beauchamp's leadership was a "stable and calm influence" during the controversy that sur­rounded the United Way of America last spring, according to both Olson and Warlick. 
"He helped the community to 
Attention must now focus in­ternally upon the African American communities them­selves, he said. 'The real prob­lem is not the Klu Klux Klan," argued Innis. "More of our people were killed in one year by blacks than when the KKK rode high." 
"The black/white thing is no where close to being a problem compared to the black/black thing," he added. 
The first step in solving problems in black America, ac­cording to Innis, is to promote educational, political and intel­lectual diversity. He cited the diversity in the choice of speak­ers for the conference Friday as a positive example-Innis as a conservative voice speaking in the morning followed by Jesse Jackson's more liberal voice in the evening. 
"I do not believe there is one Chicano, one Puerto Rican, one Asian American spokesman," Innis said. "And certainly there is not one black spokesman." 
Innis grew up in New York City and studied at the City Col­lege of New York. He joined CORE's Harlem chapter in 1963, and was elected to his post as national chairman in 1968. 
As chairman of the chapter's education committee, Innis be­came a forceful advocate of community controlled educa­tion and black empowerment. In 1967, he and nine other

understand the difference be­tween the UW of Saint Joseph's county and the UW of America," said Mark Wagner, president of the UW of Saint Joseph County. 
"We addressed the problems head on and they didn't hurt us," said Beauchamp, "We made our independence clear. We informed donors that less that one percent of their money goes to the UW of America and that 90 percent of their money goes immediately back into their own community. 
"In some ways it may have helped us because I think that it strengthened our ties to the community," he said. 
black men formed the Harlem Commonwealth Council, an in­vestment corporation formed to create independence and stabil­ity in Harlem. 
Innis delivered his address to the more than two hundred students from about 50 Catholic colleges and universities at­tending the conference, as well as by members of the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's com­munity. 
The lecture was sponsored by Student Government, the Stu­dent Union Board, Saint Mary's College and the Lilly Founda­tion.

In room 116, current NDinfo users will talk about how and why they use it and what its ad­vantages are, said Moreland. Student input will also be ac­cepted into what changes and/or new services could be offered by university computing in the future, she said. 
Although students can cur­rently only access the network through University platforms, that may soon change, said Moreland.

students will be completely wired in. 
Wiring the dorms will allow students to access the network using their own computers from their own dorm rooms, further interconnecting the University and allow computing to reach more people. 
Although off-campus students can access the network via modems, the current demands on the University lines prohibit them from doing so on a regular basis. But as more and more computers on-campus are wired in, the demands on modems will lessen, and off­campus students will be able to access the network more easily and reliably, said Moreland. 
The OUC is planning to offer these seminars twice a year to faculty and students to acquaint them with services already available and new ones being developed and put on line. As students and faculty use the network more, they can get an idea of what is needed and into what areas they need to expand into, Moreland explained.

Mediators push for peace plan 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) ­With time running out for Bosnian Serbs and Muslims to agree on a U.N. peace plan. in­ternational mediators held a final series of meetings Sunday before the Security Council takes over the crisis. 
Mediators held little hope of reaching a solution after talks bogged down over their plan to end the nearly 11-month-old war. Meetings elsewhere in­creasingly turned to the possibility of outside military intervention. 
Defense Secretary Les Aspin met in Munich, Germany. with Western military leaders to dis­cuss Washington's proposals. Aspin refused to describe the proposals to reporters, saying only that Washington could act on them as early as this week. 
Previously, the United States said it was not ready to commit ground forces in the war-torn region. 
But NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said at the Munich meeting the alliance might have to use force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where a three-sided ethnic conflict has killed more than 18,000 people and created 1 million refugees. 
"We must not shrink from the legitimate use of force if we are to remain credible," Woerner said. 
U.N. envoy Cyrus Vance said Sunday he believed the Security Council would get involved Monday. 
The talks were moved to New York from Geneva last week so the 15-nation Security Council -especially the United States -could pressure the factions to compromise. 
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, going into a meeting with mediators Sunday, said all sides should "stop the war im­mediately." 
In comments to reporters, Bosnian Croat leader Mate Bohan ridiculed such state­ments. 
"The Serbian requests are il­logical, they're unreasonable," he said. "The Serbians wish to have in their possession all the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
that they have captured by force." 
The Serbs began their offen­sives after Bosnia's declaration of independence a year ago from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. Muslims and Croats supported secession. 
The Serbs, who accounted for a third of Bosnia's population before the war, now control about 70 percent of Bosnian territory. Under the peace plan proposed by Vance and Lord Owen, a negotiator from the European Community, the land under Serb control would be cut to about 40 percent. 
The former republic also would be divided into 10 semi­autonomous provinces: each ethnic group would dominate three regions of Bosnia, and the area around the capital, Sara­jevo, would be under joint con­trol. 
The Muslim-dominated gov­ernment contends the plan would reward Serbian aggres­sion by giving the Serbs control over conquered territory. 


Brown admits to not paying social security tax for his housekeeper 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Com­merce Secretary Ron Brown ac­knowledged Sunday that he failed to pay Social Security taxes for a domestic worker over a number of years. saying he was not aware the payments were required until last month. Brown's revelation came as the Clinton administration grap­pled with ethical questions raised by the withdrawal of two candidates for attorney general 
over the hiring of domestic help. In an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press," Brown, a suc­cessful Washington lawyer who last year reported income of $750,000, said that he had not paid Social Security taxes for a women employee who cleaned his house "on an irregular basis over the past four of five years." He said the person worked only for about three hours a week and that he became

aware only last month upon further examination that he was required to pay taxes for the worker. 
"They were paid as soon as I found out there was, in fact, an issue ... that there was an obligation to pay those taxes," said Brown in answer to a question on whether he had ever failed to pay taxes for domestic employees. 
Brown said he checked further into his tax obligations last month after the issue scuttled the nomination of Zoe Baird as attorney general. She was forced to withdraw after being pressed at Senate confirmation hearings over her hiring of two undocumented workers and her failure to pay proper taxes. 
Then on Friday, Clinton's sec­ond apparent choice for attorney general, Judge Kimba 
M. Wood of New York, also withdrew from consideration after it was learned that her babysitter had been an illegal immigrant. In her case, however. the hiring of the worker was not in violation of immigration laws and she paid taxes. 
It could not immediately be learned how much in back taxes and penalties were paid by Brown, or exactly how many years the payments covered. 
Wood denies misleading White House 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Federal judge Kimba Wood denied Sun­day that while under considera­tion to be attorney general she had misled the White House about the fact that she had hired an illegal alien to care for her child. 
"I did not mislead anyone at any point and I have obeyed all laws," Wood said in a letter sent Sunday to The New York Times. 
Wood withdrew her name from consideration on Friday after saying her baby sitter had been an illegal immigrant when she was hired in 1986. 
The judge stressed that she had broken no laws because hiring undocumented workers was not illegal at the time, and the White House agreed. 
The issue took on special sig­nificance because Clinton earlier had nominated corporate attorney Zoe Baird, who withdrew after it was revealed that she had illegally employed aliens in her household as a nanny and driver. 
Administration officials said Clinton worked on the attorney general choice Sunday. One aide said the selection could be announced "in a day or two." 
~ Wood's letter, released by the White House-and the judge, was drafted in response to a Times report Sunday that quoted friends of the jurist as saying she had fully supplied the Clinton administration with details of the hiring. 
After abruptly dumping Wood from the short list of candidates Thursday night, administration officials worked feverishly to

More women buying guns as new means of protection 
CARTERET, N.J. (AP)-For a long time, Maury Mangan hated even the sight of guns. The men in her life had them, but she firmly believed that firearms were one of society's problems, not a solution. 
After she was accosted three times by threatening men. her resolve began to crumble. Then, when a New Jersey woman was abducted at a suburban mall and killed, the last threads of opposition snapped. 
On a recent Sunday, Ms. Man­gan stood on the firing line at the Lake Island Rifle and Pistol Club, clutching a revolver and slowly blasting away at a paper target 50 feet away. When the chamber was empty and she turned around, she was smiling. 
Ms. Mangan, a nurse from Oceanport, N.J., is one of an in­creasing number of women who have turned to firearms for protection. Although there are no reliable statistics, gun sellers and advocates agree that women are a rapidly expanding segment of the gun­buying market. 
"A lot more women are buy­ing firearms," said Mark Camp­bell of Shooting Systems Inc., a gun dealer in St. Louis. "More women are living by themselves and say they want protection." 
The National Hifle Association has seen the number of women members increase by about 100,000 a year recently, according to Elizabeth Swasey, the NRA's director of women's issues and information. Her office, established in 1990, is one indication of women's newfound clout. 
Five years ago, Ms. Swasey said, only 5 percent or fewer of those taking the NHA's introductory personal protection course were women.

Are deportees Islamic terrorists? 
JERUSALEM (AP) -In the snowy hills of Lebanon, the men deported by Israel say their prayers, cook simple meals and plead for justice to television cameras that carry their images around the world. 
In Israel, officials excoriate the men as Islamic terrorists who are financed by Iran and have links with shadowy Muslim groups in America. 
The public relations battle has raged since the Palestinians were expelled Dec. 17, but the basic questions remain: Who are the 399 men now in Lebanon and what is Hamas, the group they are said to lead? First, as Israel readily admits, they are not thfl triggermen di­
rectly responsible for the deaths of six Israeli soldiers in Decem­ber that inspired the mass de­portation. 
Second, most of them un­doubtedly support extremist Muslim groups that want to re­place the Jewish state with an Islamic one and issue leaflets that advocate killing as a means to that end. 
"We certainly do not claim that they are Boy Scouts," said Andrew Whitley, director of the human rights group Middle East Watch, outlining a study it con­ducted of deportees. 
Human rights advocates say Israel violated international law by deporting people from occu­pied territory and could have tried them instead. 
Whitley added that he is not convinced all the deported men were ringleaders or inciters of the radical factions Islamic Jihad and Hamas, as Israel asserted. 
Most appeared to be chosen as "the easier ones to deport," since they openly sympathized with radical factions, he said. 
His organization's report noted that about half were prayer leaders, religious schol­ars or Islamic judges. They also include 15 professors, 14 physi­cians and 16 employees of the 
U.N. agency that aids Palestinian refugees.

Solidarity for rape victims in Yugoslavia ends in disarray 
ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -A conference called to show international solidarity for rape victims in Bosnia's war ended in disarray Sunday when some Muslim and Croat women ob­jected to a resolution they said was too soft on Serbs. 
More than 500 women, including some of western Europe's leading female politicians, turned out for a meeting to denounce the mass rapes reported in Bosnia and work on strategies for halting such crimes. 
But their solidarity collapsed over a resolution that, while blaming Serb fighters for most of the atrocities, said men on all sides had raped women during the war. 
"We refuse this resolution be­cause it mentions only Bosnia­Herzegovina, and not Croatia, and because it equates the ag­gressor and the victim, saying that all parties rape," said Slav­ic a Bilic of Wall of Love, a Croatian group founded in 1991. 
Dafinka Vecerina, a lawyer from Zagreb, Croatia's capital, said: "Being raped in a park in Brussels and being raped today in a detention camp in Bosnia

have nothing in common. These women were raped only because they were Muslims and Croats." 
The European Community and some international groups estimate that up to 20,000 women have been raped in Bosnia's war, mostly Muslims attacked by Serbs. But most such reports note that some Serb women also have been raped by Muslims and Croats. 
In an apparent effort to reflect that balance, the proposed resolution blamed mass rape on "Serb war leaders ... who use sexual violence as their military strategy." But the proposed statement also said that "the rape of women by men takes place by all sides." 
Most women at the meeting generally appeared to support the declaration, but it was not strong enough for a number of local women's groups who re­fused to go along with it. 
One rival declaration de­manded that the meeting take ethnic sides and "clearly state who the aggressors are and who the victims are of the mass sexual atrocities" in Bosnia and Croatia.

Forsyth gains confidence from performance in Rolex 
-
By JONATHAN JENSEN 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame senior Will Forsyth, currently the 19th­ranked collegiate singles player in the nation, advanced to the second-round of the prestigious Rolex National Indoor Championship in Minneapolis this weekend before falling to 6th-ranked Mike Sell of Georgia 4-6, 7-5, 6-4. 
Forsyth faced Pepperdine's Howard Joffe in the opening round, pulling ofT an impres­sive 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4 I victory. 
"I was a little encouraged by the way I played this week­end," noted Forsyth, "Especially considering the way I played last week." 
In the Irish's dual meet against 8th-ranked North Carolina last weekend, Forsyth lost a 6-3, 6-1 decision to 11th-ranked Boland Thornquist and was determined to bounce back in Minneapolis. 
"This was definitely the best win I've had this year," said the Medford, Oregon native, "I regained some confidence." 
In the first match, 1-'orsyth was even down match point in the tiebreaker. but was able to continue on and get the win. 
"I owed that to just gutting it out," said Forsyth. However, turnaround was 

not fair play in his second match, where he had Sell down match point in the second set at 5-4, only to see his lead slip away. 
"I've known Mike when we used to play back in Oregon, so I knew his playing style," stated Forsyth, "I knew if I played a controlled, aggressive type of style I could be successful. I just didn't close it out when I could have." 
Forsyth and the rest of the Irish squad will take their act on the road on Tuesday, when they travel to Kentucky to face the 11th-ranked Wildcats, in their second difficult challenge in the last two dual meets. 
Hockey 
continued from page 16 

The Irish returned to the Joyce Fieldhouse Saturday for a rematch with Ferris State, who had defeated the Irish 9-3 the weekend before. In a closely fought contest, but the Irish fell 5-4. 
The Bulldogs scored the first two goals of the game at 2:24 and 5:30 of the first period and managed to keep the Irish off the score board until the 6:07 mark when the all-freshman line of 
Morshead, Ling, and Jay Matushak cut the lead to 2-1. 
On the goal, Matushak found Morshead open behind the Ferris defense and caught him with a pass that sent him in alone on Bulldog goalie Craig Lisko. Morshead moved to the right and beat Lisko with a backhander to the top shelf. 


Ling also assisted on the play. Morshead 
The Irish tied the game three minutes and sixteen seconds later while on a 4-3 advantage. Alternate captain Dave Bankoske lifted a ten-footer into the top left corner of the goal with Morshead assisting. 
Carl Picconatto was pulled from the game with five minutes left in the period after he gave up his third goal on seven shots. He was replaced by Greg Louder, who saved seventeen of the nineteen shots he faced. 
For the second consecutive night the Irish came out flying in the second period down 3-2. this time out-shooting their opponent 15-5. 
Sophomore Carey Nemeth, playing in only his second game of the season, scored the first goal of his career to tie the game at three. With 7:39 remaining in the period, he deflected home a Bankoske pass from the right corner. 
Bankoske gave the Irish their first lead with 
2:24 left when he netted his second power play goal of the game. He carried the puck behind the back of the net, swung around the left pole and swept it in front of Lisko just inside the far right post. 
The Irish lost their lead fifty seconds later when the Bulldogs scored while skating with a delayed penalty. The period ended with the score tied at three. 
Worse than the loss of their lead, however, was the loss the Irish faced with three minutes and forty nine seconds left in the period. Jamie Morshead, Notre Dame's leading goal scorer, was forced to leave the game with a fractured left clavicle. Morshead, who scored the first goal of the Ferris State game and the lone goal against the Spartans, will probably be out for the rest of the season. 
Although the Irish out-shot the_ Bulldogs in the third period, they were unable to come out with a victory. Ferris State managed to score with 
5:31 remaining in the game to take a 5-4 win. The final shot count was 36-26 to Notre Dame's advantage. 
"This really is a heart-breaker," said Schafer. "We're really tired of losing, and that just hurts. I think we deserved to win." 
"They caught a couple breaks," Bankoske said, "but all in all I thought we played pretty well." 
"We just came up a little short," said Osiecki. "I don't know why we always come up on the short end of winning." 
"I commend their effort," said Schafer, "and I lament their loss. It hurts." 
The defeats place the Irish in tenth place in the CCHA, still leading last place Ohio State by two points while now trailing eighth place Kent State and ninth place Illinois-Chicago by five and four points, respectively. 
Kent defeated OSU 4-1 Saturday night and UIC upset Western Michigan 4-2 on Friday to give both teams two points apiece for the weekend. 
The Irish will need to leap-frog both Kent and UIC in their final six regular season games if they wish to avoid the dominant three-some of Miami of Ohio, Lake Superior State, and the University of Michigan in the first round of the CCHA playoffs. The three schools were ranked fourth, fifth, and sixth in the nation prior to this weekend's results.

Stagnant offensive to blame for lopsided loss 
By MIKE SCRUDATO 
Sports Editor 
In Saturday's National Hockey League All-Star Game, the Wales Conference scored six goals in the game's first seven minutes. But in the sup­posedly high-scoring realm of college basketball, it took the Notre Dame men's team almost 10 minutes to do the same against Duke Saturday. 
then-seventhAgainst the ~···· . .·."!!;'f!.:ti; 
ranked Blue .· , · 
Devils, the 1, ~ ~' Irish were · · again victims of an inabil­ity to convert offensively, Ryan Hoo~~r 
suffering scoring droughts of 6:46 and 
4:14 in the first half, and 3:40 and 4:10 in the second half. 
This problem is the result of Notre Dame's tendency to turn the ball over, and the team's lack of motion on offense. 
The Irish had 1 7 turnovers in the first half, and 24 for the game. 
"The bulk of our turnover problem was that our players were excited about playing against a top team like Duke and on national TV," John MacLeod said. "As a result, they rushed things and tried to do something more than they were capable." 
As senior Monty Wiliams put it, "Turnovers killed us." 
The turnovers are in part caused by the stagnant Irish offense. On many occasions, no one seems to take charge of­fensively. The lack of leader­ship and confidence on the floor leads to bad shots and turnovers. 
"When we get in droughts, we tend to sit on offense, and we give up the ball," sopho­more Malik Russell explained. "You can't win games without putting the ball up." 
Despite the offensive mis­cues, MacLeod found some so­lace in his team's performance. 
"The positive aspect is ... we turned the ball over 17 times in the first half and yet were only down four at one point in the second," he said. "To keep your composure and withstand mistakes like that is very en­couraging." 
"Notre Dame neutralized what we wanted to do," Duke forward Thomas Hill added. 
"They played good defense with very sound principles," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski commented. "They were able to play at their tempo and it frustrated us." 
Duke, however, changed its offensive philosophy, finding success in the second half. "We adjusted to their tempo instead of trying to force ours," Krzyzewski said .. 


CORRECTION: 

The captain of the women's fencing team is Dinamarie Garcia (junior} not Kathleen Vogt (senior) as indicated in Friday's Observer. The Observer regrets the error. 
Hoops 
continued from page 16 
"Finally, we adjusted to the tempo rather than trying to impose our tempo on them, and that is what happened in the second half." 
The opening minutes of the first half gave some Irish fans hope as Jon Ross answered Thomas Hill's two opening shots with a slam dunk and a lay in off a Monty Williams' pass, but the Irish were stricken with the first of three scoring droughts and Duke quickly jumped ahead on a balanced scoring effort from Thomas Hill, Cherokee Parks and Hurley. 

The Irish shot 50 percent in the first half, but took only 22 shots. The lack of offense due partially to Hurley's defense on Irish guard Ryan Hoover, the team's second leading scorer, who was scoreless. 
"I knew he was a great three point shooter and that is what I tried to take away from his game today. We had a lot of respect for his ability to shoot it. I just tried to get a hand in his face and make him work for anything he got," said Hurley. 
Turnovers were a factor in the game, with the Irish (24) giving up the ball more than the Blue Devils (19), but it was poor shooting that doomed Notre Dame. 
Duke had three players in double figures including Thomas Hill(17 pts), Grant Hill (16 pts) and Hurley (14 pts) while Monty Williams (16 pts) was the only Irish player to cross the 10-point mark.

Loss to Michigan overshadows success 
By HALEY SCOTT Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's swim team achieved a split this weekend, falling to Michigan in Ann Arbor Friday night 156-131, but returning home to South Bend on Saturday and topping the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee 149-69. 
"Friday night we were as tired as we have ever been," !lead Coach Tim Welsh said. "Michigan is by far the better team, but we could have raced faster." 
The Wolverines are in the nation's top ten but an opponent which Welsh feels is necessary to face even it it equals a lopsided loss. 
"It is important to have Michigan on our schedule. They have a great athletic program, along with academic demands similar to ours. Their program is what we want ours to be," Welsh said. 
Despite the physical exhaustion of the team, there were some good swims. Senior co-captain Tanya Williams won both the 100-yard and 200­yard backstroke events, and took second place in the 200-yard individual medley. The only other individual winner of the meet was freshman Jesslyn Peterson in the 200-yard breastroke. 

Angela Gugle 
"We gave a good effort. We may not have swum as fast as we would have liked, but you can't blame anyone for not giving a good effort." 
The Irish returned to Rolfs Aquatic Center on Saturday to swim Wisconsin-Milwaukee in the last home dual meet of the season. With tradition being a huge part of Notre Dame, the meet started out with a few swim team traditions. Poems were read to each of the grad­uating seniors about their career at Notre Dame. They, along with the team's senior manager, Christy Cook. were also presented with gift of ap­preciation from the other members of the team. 
The seniors and the rest of the team went on to kill Wisconsin-Milwaukee, winning every individual event except one. Senior Kay Broderick left her last home meet a double win­ner, placing first in the 200-yard individual medley and the 200-yard backstroke. Freshman Joy Michnowicz also won two events, the 1000-yard and the 500-yard freestyle. 
"We were definitely the faster team. But everyone did an excellent job keeping focused, and everyone did an excellent job athletically," Welsh said. "We tried to balance people in different events, while letting the seniors swim at least one of their power events. It was a nice send oft" meet for the seniors." 
But according to Welsh, and head diving coach Adam Hirchfield, the diving events "stole the show this weekend." 
"Our performance versus the power of Michigan's divers was good. And on Saturday our divers gave a superstar performance." 
Junior Angela Gugle, sophomore Diane Walton, and freshman Liane Gallagher all qualified for the Zone championship in March. Gallagher also set a school record on the 1­meter board. 
"It was exciting to have everyone dive so well," said Walton. 
The Irish finish their dual meet season next Saturday against the University of Illinois­Chicago; then on to the Midwestern Collegiate Conference Championship meet and the Eastern Collegiate Championship meet. 
Divers' success highlights rout of UWM 
By ALLISON MCCARTHY Sports Writer 
The men's swimming team added another victory to their dual meet record this weekend, defeating the Panthers of the University of Wisconsin-Mil waukee 142-77. 
"It was a real well­balanced win," said Head Coach Tim Welsh. "We just had too much overall for Wisconsin-Milwau­kee." 
In their last dual meet at Rolfs Aquatic Center, the five Irish seniors won four of the eleven events and placed high in several others. 
Senior co-captains John Godfrey and Tom Whowell placed first and second in the 200 backstroke, and each swam the backstroke leg on first and second place medley relay teams. 
"It was a fitting end to their career here," said Welsh. "They have been a backstroke pair since their freshman year." 
In the 200 back, Godfrey and Whowell were within two-tenths of a second of each other, and in the relay their times were within two one­hundredths of a second. 
Senior Greg Cornick did not swim his traditional race, the 100 freestyle, but instead dropped to the 50 free and placed first at 21.76. 
Senior Ed Broderick 
placed first in the 100 free at 48.43 and also in the 200 I.M. in a time of 1:59.79. 
Senior Colin Cooley placed second in the 200 Butterfly at 1:57.65. 
"Colin didn't swim his specialties-the 200 I.M. and the 200 breast-but he had an outstanding time in the 200 fly, an event which he hasn't done since he's been here." stated Welsh. 
The underclassmen also contributed to Notre Dame's victory over the Panthers. Sophomore Will McCarthy, a distance freestyle specialist, placed second in the 1000 free at 10:15.97. 
Sophomore Mike Keeley won two events, the 200 and 500 free at 1:46.47 and 4:41.12, respectively. 
"The men were relaxed and focused. It was great to see the seniors have a really nice day," commented Welsh. "Overall, it was a very successful, solid meet." 
One of the highlights of the afternoon, according to Welsh, was the diving of junior Sean llyer. llyer won both the one and three-meter diving events against some of his toughest competition this season. 
In the one-meter diving, llyer scored a 314.4, qualifying for the NCAA zone diving meet and breaking the university record of his coach, second year law student Adam Hirschfeld. 
According to Welsh, "This meet sets the team up very well for MCC's, Easterns, and NCAA's."

McWilliams gives sterling performance 

By SEAN SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's track team competed this past Friday in the Meyo Invitational. The Fighting Irish displayed an array of outstanding performances. 
The most dramatic performance of the day was by All-American Mike McWilliams in the Meyo Mile. McWilliams is a three time All-American in cross country and is among the nation's elite distance runners. If critics could find one fault with McWilliams' ability, it would be that he doesn't have the speed to run the mile. His personal record was 4:11. 
Well. this past weekend McWilliams put the critics to rest. The junior from Grove City, PA was up against three professionally sponsored athletes in Jon Warren: Nike, Mike O'Connor: New York Athletic Club and Benny Mcintosh: Asics. When the starting gun fired, McWilliams locked in at 5th place and held on. 
The first 400 meters McWilliams ran in 57 seconds and he still looked strong. After 1000 meters into the mile McWilliams was at 2:30. Last weekend competing in the 1000 meter event, McWilliams ran 2:32. Clearly something was happening. What began as a rushed, fast paced start, turned into a valiant display of fortitude by the All­American before the hometown crowd. The professional Jon Warren pushed through in four flat and McWilliams kicked it down the final stretch finishing in 4:04. 
He'd done it. He took seven seconds off his best mile time obliterating his former personal record. And now McWilliams, never considered to have the speed for the mile, qualified for the NCAA champi­onship in that very event. 
The eternal distance runner had this to say of his performance. 
"I don't think what I've done is that great. I was really happy with it. I didn't expect to qualify for Nationals. Running a fast mile is kind of a stepping stone. I'm just ready to run the 5K." 
Another great performance of the day was by Junior Co-Captain Todd Herman, who won the high jump competition. The Linton, Indiana native broke his second straight personal record by clearing 7' 2 1/2" for a new Meyo invita­tional record. Other good performances in the high jump were by Tom Mescall and Todd Johnston who finished fourth and fifth respectively both with heights of 6'9 1/2". 
Other impressive showings were Nate Ruder who ran 4:08 in the mile and Shane Duboise, who ran 8:33.74 in the 3000 meter. 
"Today was excellent, it's the best we've ever done at the Meyo Invitational. It was also exciting to have two guys qualified for the NCAA championship," said Head Coach Joe Piane.

Women finish strong despite tough challenge 
By MIKE NORBUT 
Sports Writer 
Individuals from universities 

across the United States and 
Canada competed this past Sat­
urday as the Fighting Irish 
hosted the Meyo Invitational at 
the Loftus Sports Center. When 
the array of action finally 
slowed, the Notre Dame 
women's track team found 
themselves fighting off some 
tough competition to finish 
with a strong performance. 
The Irish were led by Karen 

Harris, who took first place in 
the shotput, and Erica Peter­
son, who set a Notre Dame in­
door record while winning the 
400 meters. Notre Dame's 
other first place winner was 
their 4x880 relay team, which 
also set a university indoor 
record. 
The University of Windsor 

fared well in the sprinting and 
field events Saturday. Sprinter 
Irma Grant won the 55 meter 
dash and set a new Meyo Invi­
tational record en route to her 
victory in the 200 meter dash. 
In the field events, Windsor 
athletes Gisele Poulin and Kelly 
Dinsmare took first in the long 
jump and triple jump, respec­
tively. Tricia Joseph placed 
fifth in the long jump and third 
in the triple jump for the Fight­
ing Irish. 
Notre Dame competed 

fiercely with Western Michigan 
and the University of Michigan 
for dominance in the distance 
races. Western Michigan run­
ner Jill Stamison won the 800 
and set a Meyo Invitational 
record in the 1000 meter run, 
though she was trailed closely 
by Irish runner Emily Husted, 
who came in second and set a 
Notre Dame indoor record in 
the process. Kristi Kramer 
placed second in the 5000 me­
ter run behind unattached 
runner Cindy James, and Eva 
Flood took second in the mile 
run behind Illinois St. runner 
Heather Murphy. 
"Our runners are starting to 

bring their times down," said 
captain Lisa Gorski. "A lot of 
our runners had some really 
good performances today."

In the only home meet of the year for the fencing squads Saturday. both the men and the women continued their winning ways by going 4-0 and 4-1 respectively. 
The Irish men beat Case Westnrn Heserve University 26­1, Cleveland State 25-2, Northwestern 18-9, and Ohio State 16-11. The four victories improved the men's record to 18-1. 
The women improved their record to 13-3 by defeating CWHU and CSU 14-2, North­western 13-3, and Lawrence 16-0. The women fell to the Buckeyes 12-4. The women also feneed CWHU in the epee event, winning 10-6, and marking the first time in NCAA history that women have fenced competitively in the epee. 
The foilists led the way for the men, proving that they are among the best teams in the Midwest. dominating the tough foil squads of Ohio State and Northwestern. Senior captain Jeff Piper was 10-0 on the day, improving his season record to 35-5, while junior Hian Girard was a solid 10-1. 
"The foil team fenced as we expected them to." said men's coach Mike DeCicco. "They had a stellar weekend, winning big against all four teams. They beat Northwestern and Ohio State handily, and that proves to me that we are one of the best teams in the midwest." 
Letia Bowen (31 ), shown here against La Salle, continued her impressive play in the interior.

The epee squad was also quite successful, thanks to an 8­1 performance by senior Per Johnsson and an 8-2 perfor­mance by junior captain Grze­gorz Wozniak. Senior Brian Ray who usually doesn't see much action fenced to a 7-0 record on the day. 
"The team of Per Johnsson, Grzegorz Wozniak, and Geoff Peehinsky will be outstanding. They are among the leaders in the midwest," said DeCicco.

The women fenced well, although they showed an in­ability to beat the top midwest­ern team by falling to Ohio State, 12-4. Their 13-3 record for the year marks the first time an Irish women's has lost three times in one season since 1985. Freshman Claudette de Bruin went 3-1 against the Buckeyes, 

Women's hoop routs Duquesne for second straight win 
Observer Staff Report 

!lot shooting and a strong bench performance lifted the Notre Dame women's basketball team to a 95-67 rout of Midwestern Collegiate Confer­ence foe Duquesne Saturday. 
The Irish, now 10-9 overall and 6-3 in the MCC, connected on 41 of 72 shots from the field for a 55 pereent dip on the way to their largest offensive output of the season. 
Sherri Orloski led the offen­sive barrage with 20 points, including 4 of 9 from three­point range. Kristin Knapp connected on 9 of 15 shots for 18 points and Letitia Bowen maneuvered inside for 13 points on 6 of 8 from the field. 
Notre Dame raced to a 24-7 lead in the first 10 minutes of the game and Duquesne never made a serious run. 
Bench support from Tootie Jones and Audrey Gomez played a big role in Notre Dame's suecess. Jones filled in for Knapp with 14 points of her own inside. And Gomez dished out four assists to go along with eight points. 
The emotional peak of the night came near the end of the game when walk-on Susan Atchinson connected on two three-pointers and added a free-throw for her first colle­giate points. 
Chris Sebastian scored 20 points to lead Duquesne and Erin Popovich added 16. 
Notre Dame returns to action Thursday night when Xavier visits the Joyce Center. Earlier this season, the Irish handed the Musketeers a 64-58 loss.

RICH KURZ 
Eye in the Sky 
Arthur Ashe's greatness came on and off the court 
Every so often, an athlete will rise to 
the top of the sports world and then 
transcend it, making his mark not only 
on the field of competition, but off it. 
On Saturday, the world lost such a 
person when Arthur Ashe died of 
AIDS-related pneumonia in a New York 
City hospital. 
Those who haven't seen Ashe play 
tennis may not realize the great skill 
and poise he possessed on the tennis 
eourt, but anyone who saw Ashe speak 
can admire him for his great 
intelligence and thougtfulness. 
My lasting memory of Ashe comes from an interview he gave with Roy Fin~stone on ESPN last fall. Not only did Ashe have a great intellectual capacity, but it was obvious that he put great care into his thoughts and expressed them with an articulateness rarely found in athletes. 
lin wasn't satisfied with merely talking about issues, though. lie also fHit a strong urge to act on his eonvktions. Ashe funded tennis camps and programs for inner-city youths who otherwise might never get exposed to tennis. 
In 1970. Ashe was prominent in getting South Africa banned from the Davis Cup because of that country's apartheid policies, and he also has written a three-volume work on the history of black athletes. 
Ashe himself was one of those history-making black athletes. He was the first and only black man to win the Wimbledon championship and the U.S. Open. lie was ranked number one in 1968 and 1975, the year he beat .Jimmy Connors to win Wimbledon. 
But in 1979 a heart attack forced Ashe. then 36, to have the first of two open-heart surgeries. It is believed that he contracted the AIDS during the second of those operations. 
lie managed to keep his illness a secret for several years until an overzealous and opportunistic news n~porter threatened to run a story on it, prompting Ashe to acknowlegde publicly his disease. 
Characteristically, Ashe kept up his busy schedule and involvement in public-interest affairs, focusing on AIDS. 
I Ie gave a speech on AIDS in front of the United Nations General Assembly in 1992, and joined the boards of AIDS institutes at Harvard and UClA. 
The full effect of the impact Ashe has had on his game and his world has been evident since his death Saturday. lie is mourned not only by fellow athletes and sports fans, but by the entire country. including the President of the United States. 
In a fitting final gesture to the athlete who has had perhaps the greatest influence of any sports figure in recent memory, the body of Arthur Ashe will lie at th1~ Capitol in Richmond, Va., his hometown. 
It will be some time before the sports world, and indeed the whole world, sees another man the equal of Arthur Ashe.

Irish hockey lose games, Morshead over weekend 
Notre Dame no match for Duke

"That was a big time play," said Notre Dame coach John MacLeod. "Great pass. That was a big effort there."

Leading scorer could be lost for season 
By BRYAN CONNOLLY Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame hockey team faced a major loss Saturday night when leading scorer Jamie Morshead suffered a fractured left clavicle (collar bone) in the second period of a game against Ferris State. 
Morshead, a freshman, was heading toward the left boards for a loose puck in Notre Dame's defensive end when he was 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.:. checked forcefully by a Ferris skater. 
Although the check was clean, Morshead hit the boards perpendicularly. All of the pressure from the check was therefore thrust up01,1 his left shoulder. He will most likely be out of the line up for the remainder of the season. 
"That's a big loss for us," said Irish captain Matt Osiecki. "He's been on a tear lately. It hurts us a lot because we haven't been scoring much lately and he's been one of the main scorers." 
Morshead's twelve goals place him first four-point play that put the Blue Devils up 52-42. With the exception of a single free throw, the Irish were held scoreless for seven minutes and could only close the deficit to within 20 on a pair of Lamarr Justice desperation three pointers. 
"It was a close game. It was like six or eight points and it was going back and forth and I think it was important to get it to double figures. It just 
,happened that I was able to hit a four-point play, but we got it to double figures and 
I

from that point we were able to build on it," said Hurley. 
Prior to the four-point play, the Irish had been keeping pace and slowly chipping away at Duke's nine point halftime lead (32-23), but the Blue Devil's experience showed as they took control in the second half. 
"I thought our experience showed in the second half and we played really well in the last 10-11 minutes of the game. Very precise and we broke open a game where I thought Notre Dame played us hard," said Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski. 
"They were able to play at their tempo and that is a sign of a team, a good basketball team," added the Duke coach. The Observer/Jake Peters

double figures. 

on the Irish goal scoring charts and his twenty-one points put. him at fourth in overall scoring. 
"He's one of our true goal scorers," said Notre Dame head coach Ric Schafer. "His presence will be sorely missed." 
Prior to the injury, he had been a strong candidate for the Central Collegiate Hockey Association's All­Rookie Team, along with line-mate Jamie Ling. 
For a team which is averaging just under three goals per game, the loss of Morshead is devastating. Alternate captain Curtis Janicke, who is second on the team in scoring is also currently out with a slightly separated shoulder. 
"We definitely need him," said alternate captain Dave Bankoske. "We have enough trouble scoring as it is now. But that just means somebody else is going to have to step up." · 
Morshead spent last night in the infirmary and was unavailable for comment.

With two losses this weekend to 

Michigan State and Ferris State, 
respectively, the Notre Dame hockey 
team fell to 6-20-2 overall and 4-18-2 in 
the Central Collegiate Hockey Asso­
ciation. 
Michigan State, which is fifth in the CCHA and was ranked ninth in the nation in last week's poll, handed Notre Dame a 5-1 loss at Munn Arena in East Lansing, Mich., on Friday night. 
The Spartans opened the scoring with 

9:33 remaining in the first period and then doubled their lead only thirty-eight seconds later. CCIIA leading scorer Bryan Smolinski closed the period's scoring at 3-0 when he netted his twenty-third goal of the season while shorthanded. 
The Irish responded by dominating the play in the second period, as they out­shot the Spartans 14-4. Freshman Jamie Morshead scored his eleventh goal of the season 4:24 into the period with assists going to fellow freshman Jamie Ling and senior Eric Gregoire. The power play goal cut the Michigan State lead to 3-1. 
The Irish would come no closer, however, as MSU held them scoreless through the remainder of the game. Smolinski and line mate Brian Clifford each scored their second goals of the evening during Spartan power plays in the third period to lock the score at 5-1. 
Carl Picconatto started in net for Notre Dame and saved twenty one shots. The Irish out-shot the Spartans 33-26. 
Notre Dame head coach Hie Schafer characterized the. play of his team as a "gutsy performance". 
"We did a lot of good things (Friday) night," he said. "We fired a lot of good shots at the goaltender." 
"I thought we out-played them in the second and third periods and I think we had a lot more chances," said Irish cap­tain Matt Osiecki. "The problem was they capitalized on all their chances to score and we didn't."
