Only half of raffle winners claim tickets 
By JOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
Tlw Student Union Board (SUB) was unable to sell 58 studnnt football tickets to Notre Dame's game Saturday at Purdue, according to SUB manager Phil Hoss--making the 33­19 loss against the Boilermakers also the biggest loss SUB has expe­rienced on a football ticket sale in recent years. 
SUB originally offered the Purdue tickets for sale through a lottery held Sept. 12, in which there were 196 winners who were eli­gible to purchase two tick­
ets each. Of the 196 lottery winners. however, about half were claimed before the Sept. 24 deadline. 
The remaining tickets were then made available for sale to the general stu­dent body, SUB director of publicity Laura Fox said. 
For the Michigan game, the first away game ticket sale this year, SUB sold the entirety of its 196 ticket allotment. All 98 winners of the initial lottery claimed their tickets, who were each allowed to pur­chase two tickets.

COR 
Freshman fills vacant position 
Parliamentarian makes sure constitution obeyed 
By JOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
The Council of Representatives (COR) approved Tyler "T.J." Smith as parliamentarian at its meeting Tuesday. Smith fills a position that, though writ­ten into the student union constitution, was previously vacant. 
Smith, a freshman from Knott Hall, has assisted in his dorm's programming events, such as the Knott Rodeo, since coming to Notre Dame. In high school, he participated in student government and served as the vice president of Model United Nations. 
Smith "enjoys the techni­cal and rule-based parts of government," judicial coun­cil president Ashley Weiss said in her nomination let­ter to the members of COR, in support of Smith. 
As parliamentarian, Smith is responsible for ensuring that all rules are followed at all student government meetings.

Annual W"alk raises funds to fight poverty 
College attendance low at nationwide event 
By LIZ HARTER News Writer 
Only five members of the Saint Mary's social work club participated in the annual Communities Responding to Overcome Poverty (CROP) walk Sunday at Howard Park. But despite the low atten­dance this year, the students that participated in the event said they were happy to have been there. 
The walk, sponsored by the Christian World Service, was one of hundreds that will occur across the country throughout October to raise money for local hunger-fight­ing agencies and internation­
al poverty relief organiza­tions. 
"[The walk] is a wonderful example of the South Bend community's dedication to the awareness of social justice issues and commitment to the elimination of social injus­tices," social work club presi­dent Connie Adams said. 
The walk not only benefits international agencies com­bating hunger and poverty, but also the local South Bend community. 
"Twenty-five percent of the money collected [by the CROP walk] stays in our communi­ty," said Carrie Call, the direc­tor of the Office for Civic and

there are so many possibili­ties is both exciting and daunting. Most seniors at this point pretty much know whether they'll be con­tinuing on the path of higher learn­ing or venturing out into a world far removed from the libraries and labs of academia.

It's this idea of branching out that causns such anxious thought and frazzlnd conversation at any num­ber of the local South Bend water­

Maybe you want to do service. That's great. But where to bngin? 
You could teach with the ACE program or Teach For Ameriea. Or are the struggling third-world pop­ulations of the world constantly calling out in the back of your mind for hnlp and aid? Peace Corps could be just the right fit. 
And these are just three of the many service options available to graduating Domers. 
So the dnsnrts of Africa or a ram­bunctious elassroom of sixth graders in the Bronx just aren't exactly what you have in mind? That's entirely fair. 
Aftor all. most would agree that falling deep into debt for the oppor­tunity of studying beneath the watchful gaze of Our Lady is service enough for awhile. 
If you're smart with numbers and an intelligent communicator, a gig with an investment bank or a spot in a business leadership program might be appealing with all their promises of fat paychecks and uppnr-management exposure in the first few years out of school. 
But do these look dull and bor­ing? 
There's always consulting. where it is possible to work with a wide variety of clients and businesses. After a few years as a consultant, it's not too tough to find a job in one of the industries to which you previously acted as an expert con­sultant. 
But then you'd be in the same ideological jam you found yourself in when you turned down the job with GE to stalk the halls of Bain. 
Or maybe all this seems like it's just not worth the effort. Well, there's always mom and dad's couch and the aceompanying privi­lege of overhearing mom constantly reaflirming her friends that yes, her dear son or daughter is "find­ing" himself or herself and will soon be the great success we all expeeted after watching the little rascal graduate with NHS honors four years ago.

Spiders, scorpions found In Manila mail 
MANILA, Philippines ­The package from Hong Kong looked innocent enough, marked "personal clothing." But when customs offieials opened it, they were stunned to see about 300 live scorpions and spiders. 
The scorpions and spiders -which included tarantulas -were paeked in nets. bot­tles and transparent plastic boxes, concealed under clothes, newspapers report­ed Wednesday. 
"The scorpions almost bit the examiner," Nelson Ebio, a port collector at the Central Mail Exchange Center, told the Philippine Daily Inquirer. It was the first time the post office had encountered such poisonous mail, he said. 

The Philippine Star daily quoted Ebio as saying the paekage arrived from Hong Kong on Monday, but it was not dear who sent it or why, though some speculated they could have been intended for a collector of the creatures.

The Irish government used censorship during the war to try to make neutrality popular.

among  other  local  food

Saint Mary's has been send­ing students to the CROP walk for the last eight years, includJ ing 15 students in 2006, Call said. 
The goal for this year, she said, was to send at least 20 students. but sehedule con­flicts made that figure unat­tainable. Call said the other benefit walk scheduled for this week -Thursday's Light the Night walk. will take place on Saint Mary's campus. The event will raise money for the Luekemia and Lymphoma Society. 
Moreover, the College is also sending the "Belles Brigade" to the Making Strides Against Breast Cancer walk in down­town South Bend Saturday. 
The option to attend the other walks might have con­tributed to this year's low attendance at the CHOP walk, Call said. 
"The number of students from Saint Mary's walking this year is low compared to previ­ous years," Call said. "[Those other two walks are] pulling in many of the volunteers who might have done the CHOP walk." 
Other groups, however, were able to send larger delega­tions. St. Joseph's Jligh School's Helping Other People Endure (II.O.P.E.) charity organization sent a group of almost 100 students to the CHOP walk, according to the South Bend Tribune. 
To boost Saint Mary's partici­pation in the event, the OCSE was hoping to increase the College's CHOP donation to $400, up from last year's $350 contribution. Final figures weren't available, since dona­tions for the event can still be made, said Jayne Fogle, direc­tor of the Educational Learning-Tree and CHOP walk campus liaison. 
"[The CHOP walk's goal] this year is to earn $5,000 over last year's total in order to receive a $5,000 matching grant," Fogle said. 
The walk raised more than $32,000 last year, aceording to the Tribune.

Korean leaders meet for rare summit 
SEOUL, South Korea -The first summit between the divided Koreas in seven years opened Tuesday to rapturous cheers from hundreds of thousands of North Koreans, but their leader gave the visiting South Korean president a chillier reception. 
The words ''I'm glad to meet you" were apparently the only ones North Korean leader Kim Jong II uttered to South Korean President Rob Moo-hyun during their first encounter in the North's capital Pyongyang -a 12-minute welcoming ceremony to launch the three-day summit. The two did not have substantive talks.

Wildfires growingmore intense, aggressive 
Firefighters say they are less likely to risk their lives saving unprotected homes from fires 
Associated Press 
SALT LAKE CITY ­Fueled by drought and development, wildfires in the West are getting big­ger and more aggressive, creating conditions so dangerous that fire bosses are increasingly reluctant to risk lives saving houses -particularly if the own­ers have done nothing to protect their property. 
From Southern California to Montana, seven firefighters have died this year battling blazes that have destroyed more than 400 houses, a dramatic increase from last year. 
The firefighters' job has been made more haz­ardous by an onslaught of houses and vacation cab­ins being built across the rugged West -some of them inside national forests. An estimated 8.6 million houses have been built within 30 miles of a national forest since 1982.

IN BRIEF Stocks mixed following Monday rally 
NEW YORK -Wall Street ended mixed Tuesday, selling ofT large companies' stocks but buying up those of smaller companies as investors cashed in gains from Monday's big rally and poked around for new bargains. 
It was a somewhat unusual day of trading ­normally, the major stock indexes closely track one another, but Tuesday, the Dow Jones indus­trials closed with a moderate loss while the Nasdaq composite index had a moderate gain. Given the market's quick, sharp rebound from August's credit market squeeze and stock sellofT, it was to be expected that investors would pause to adjust their portfolios as the fourth quarter gets under way. 
Wall Street was only slightly fazed by the National Association of Realtors' report Tuesday that its seasonally adjusted index of pending sales lor existing homes fell 6.5 percent in August from July and 21.5 percent from a year ago. The data suggest sales of existing homes will proba­bly keep declining in the coming months -bad news for the economy, but good news for those hoping for another interest rate cut. 
Buyout offer reduced for student lender 
WASHINGTON -After a group of investors reduced its cash offer for Sallie Mae by 17 per­cent on Tuesday, the nation's largest student lender insisted that the buyers honor their origi­nal $25 billion deal. 
The investor group, which is led by private equity firm J.C. Flowers & Co. and includes Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, said the student-loan legislation signed into law by President Bush, and weaker economic condi­tions, made the $60-a-share price negotiated in April unacceptable. 
The group sent its revised offer to the board of the company, formally called SLM Corp., say­ing that $50 a share now "appropriately and fairly reflects the new economic and legislative environment that faces the company." 
Under the new offer, which is worth about $21 billion in cash, Sallie Mae has the potential to receive an additional payment of more than $7 a share if the company performs on track with its own projections. It could receive an extra $10 a share if the company exceeds those expectations. 

Record companies attack file sharing 
Capital, Warner Bros., Sony BMG beginfirst civil copyright claims trial against Minnesota woman 
Associated Press 
DULUTH, Minn.-The nation's largest record com­panies took their fight against illegal downloads to court for the first time Tuesday, targeting a Minnesota woman they say improperly shared nearly 2,000 songs online. 
Jennifer Pariser, head of litigation and antipiracy at Sony BMG, portrayed the federal copyright trial as a fight for survival. 
"It is imperative for Sony BMG to combat this prob­lem," Pariser, lead attorney for a coalition of music com­panies, said in her opening statement in the civil trial. "If we don't, we have no busi­ness anymore." 
Jammie Thomas, a 30­year-old mother of two from Brainerd, Minn., told reporters outside the court­room that she was "inno­cent." 
Thomas said that instead of paying a settlement to the record companies she had spent the same amount on her attorney's retainer. 

"I refuse to be bullied," she said. The trial was expected to last just a few days. Record companies includ­I'J" ing Capitol Records Inc. and Jammie Thomas, a 30-year-old mother of two, speaks to reporters with her lawyer after Warner Bros. Records Inc.

Actual
al mayhem. 

Common Sense 
Estimates of' Iraqi civilian df1aths due to vioiPnce since 2003 range anywhere from 50.000 to the hundreds of thou­sands. Aceording to a poll conductNJ by the Opinion Research Business in 2007. one out of four Iraqis has had a family member murdered. In Baghdad where the U.S. presence is the most concentrated, one in four said they had a family member kidnapped and OJH~ in three said a family member has fled abroad. Iraq is hardly peaceful. 
While people can and should argue about the wisdom and justif1cation of the U.S.-Icd invasion of Iraq, the fact n~mains that the U.S. is there and Iraq is truly a war-torn country. This is a fact and no amount of complaining that the U.S. should not be in Iraq in tlw first place will change it. Consequently, the U.S. should be ask­ing what it can do to help decrease the bloodshed. Particularly, it should focus on what type of government for Iraq is most likely to stem the violence. To do so, we must first look at what moti­vates the violence in the first place. 
Iraq is a large and diverse country. As of 2006, Iraq had a population of nearly 27 million people. Ethnically, Arabs make up about 75 percent of the population, Kurds make up about 15 percent and Assyrians, Iraqi Turkmen and others make up the remaining five percent. Nearly all of Iraq (97 percent) is Muslim. Of those, just over 60 per­cent are Shi'ite and fewer than 40 per­cent are Sunni. These religious denom­inations are also associated with dif­ferent ethnicities which make the mat­ter even more complicated. Shi'ites are comprised mostly of Arabs, Turkmen 
and Faili Kurds, while Sunnis are also 
composed of Arabs, Turkmen, and 
Shali school Kurds. 
From an American perspective, what is particularly confusing is that much of the violence in Iraq isn't a result of' conflicts between American troops and thosP opposed to their presence; most of the violence is due to in!ighting bPtween diff'erent Iraqi f'aetions, whether religious or ethnic. It seems odd at llrst that citizens of tho samn country who have lived alongside each other f'or so many years would start to attack each other, but a few quiek facts about the relations between the groups explains much of' it. 
Saddam Hussein and his ruling Baath Party heavily f'avored the Sunnis at the expense of the Shi'ites and Kurds, even though the Sunnis made up at most 40 pereent of' the popula­tion. He gave Sunnis high positions in his government and kept the Sunni minority J1rmly in power, cspceially economically. Consequently, many Sunnis hailed Hussein as their leader and those not in power (the Shi'ite and Kurds) resented those in power (the Sunnis). In addition, Hussein had a well-publicized tendency to "erack down" on Shi'ite and Kurdish dissi­dents. In 1988, for example, Saddam began a campaign to exterminate the Kurdish people living in Northern Iraq, killing between 50,000 and 100,000. Just after the Gulf War, he killed between 60,000 and 130,000 rebel­lious Shi'ites. Incidents such as these caused tension between the faetions in Iraq and are now overflowing in the form of violence between different sects. In particular, the formerly­oppressed Shi'ites blame the Sunnis for decades of oppression. They are fighting for control of the newly creat­ed government. 
As Charles Rice pointed out last week ("Assyrian suffering overlooked in Iraq," Sept. 26), the U.S. government is trying to force all the factions under the same powerful central democratic government rather than allow the sep­arate groups to govern thmnselves. The problem is that in a dnmoc-.racy where the central government is pow­nrf'ul, the majority f'rcqunntly tramples on the rights of tlw minority. As Bien showed, those now in power arc abus­ing the Assyrians b11eause the Assyrians don't hav11 the numbers to do anything about it. Giving tlw major­ity (tho Shi'ites) tlw powor through the central governmnnt over the rest of the population. (i.e. the Sunnis) when tlw Shi'ites want revengo f'or their opprns­sion at the hands of' tho Sunnis, is a reeipe f'or disastPr. Such a poli1:y will only lead to furthnr violence and con­flict botween groups. 
The solution is to create a republic like the one that tho Constitution creat­ed: a federalist system of government. Nearly all of the powor remained at tlu1 statn level, rather than the f'nderal level. The federal government's powers were limited and defined. Consequently, tlw states wore able to govern themsnlves largely without interference. Power rnsidnd at the local level -Americans not living in Virginia held virtually no power over those living in Virginia. In Iraq. because most local populations are of the same ethnicity or religion, each community would be mostly free to govern itself without interference from the majority via the central govern­ment. Sunnis would govern Sunnis at the local level, Shi'ites would govern Shi'ites, Kurds would govorn Kurds. Shi'ites would have very little power over Sunnis. II' each faction has little power over the other factions, there is little incentive to continue the fighting. A federalist system worked for the US and can work for Iraq.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Denunciation of beauty standards ill-founded 
I was initially heartened to read Greg Yatrola's column ("Anorexia and the devil," Oct. 2) decrying the pernicious beauty standards our popular culture foists upon women. But I have to dis­agree profoundly with the basis he gives for his denunciations. 
While Yatrola does point out the harm these standards do to women, this is not the central complaint of his piece. Rather, the real problem he sees with beauty standards is that they're not his stan­dards. Rather than judging women by how well they live up to the standards set by Maxim and Cosmo, he believes we should be judging women by how well they live up to the standards set by Greg Yatarola. 
It's true that Yatrola does not say this in so many words. He pretends to be speak­ing for (straight) "men generally" and a simplistic, biologically deterministic account of attraction. But women's bod­ies do not belong to men, whether those bodies are to be admired as attractive objects from afar, used for sex or used for procreation. Women's bodies belong to women, and it's up to women to decide what they will do with their bodies. 
Yatrola is no more entitled to decide the standards by which women are to be judged than are the editors of Maxim and Cosmo. Standards of beauty -any stan­dards of beauty, whether those of Maxim or those of Greg Yatrola-used to dis­criminate between acceptable and unac­ceptable women are objectifying and per­nicious. The only terms on which a women's body should be judged arc her own.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Disputing facts about the Irish language 
Irish language holds strong 
In her letter to the editor ("Irish lan­guage a relic of the past," Oct. 1), Sara Falvey claims that the Irish Language is spoken by few and is a "relic." Recently, I travelled to Ireland and spent several days on an island, Inis Oirr, where the working language was clearly Irish. The island's name is always spelled the Irish way (except in tourist information, for ease of pronunciation by those unfamiliar with the language), and most signs-not just road signs, but also commemorative markers ­are as well. The mass I attended was entirely in Irish. 
Additionally, I encountered a large group of children from other parts of the country who were sent there to getimmersed in the language. Perhaps in parts of Ireland English is the dominant language, but in other areas, Irish holds strong, and there are efforts underway to spread its use. 
Jackson Bangs freshman Stanford Hall Oct.! 
Misinformation about Irish language insulting · 
As two young members of the substantial Irish speaking community living and working on the Notre Dame campus, we have been left with no choice but to take issue with Sarah Falvey's letter ("Irish language a relic of the past," Oct. 1). She must first be congratulated on having succeeded in fit­ting such a vast amount of misinformation into such a short piece. 
Her theory that Irish language signposts are some sort of stunt promoting cultural tourism is ridiculous. All road sig­nage in Irish-speaking areas is in Irish alone, a fact which serves to confuse tourists rather than entertain them. Outside of the Irish-speaking areas, they are in both Irish and English. 
The amount of Irish medium schools is increasing all the time. Parents and students are voting with their feet and as a result Gaelscoileanna (Irish medium education) cannot cope, such is the demand for places in Irish medium schools. 
With regard to learning Irish being akin to learning any other foreign language taught in schools; each child begins learning Irish in their first year of school and continues to do so throughout primary and secondary level. This is not an option, this is compulsory. Irish is treated the same in schools as the other official language of the state, English. Both are academic subjects. Other foreign languages need not be taught until students reach high school. 
Flavey poses the question, "Who's left to resurrect the Irish language?" This implication that the language is dead and in need of resurrection is simply~not true and, quite frankly, it is personally insulting. Any aspect of modern life can be dis­cussed and enjoyed through Irish. There is an Irish language version of "South Park" currently in the making and the lan­guage is easily spotted on web sites like Facebook and Bebo. These would not typically be seen by sociolinguists as char­acteristics of a "relic of the past." 
We now wish to lay this matter to rest once and for all. Irish is not, nor will she be, dying any time soon. For us to be relegated to the ranks of linguistic antiquity by anyone whose knowledge of Irish life or culture is based on a semester spent living with three Irish girls in Dublin is unacceptable. For anyone to presume to have gained an understanding of Ireland's complex linguistic make-up after such a limited ephemeral fling with Joycean fly-by nets is, putting it quite simply, taking the proverbial piss. 
In light of the recent ignorance shown by some of Notre Dame's students in relation to language matters in general, perhaps the University might consider instigating a program in socio-linguistics.

Deportation not solution for ex-Nazi 
For an elite task force of Nazi-hunters, World War II refuses to die. Since 1979 the "Office of Special Investigation" has stripped 
U.S. citizenship from 108 ex-Nazis, and now, it can claim one more. Paul Henss, an 85­year-old man from Atlanta, Ga., will be deported and sent to face charges in Germany for his role in the Holocaust. But for anyone watching the case closely, it is clear that time spent hunting dying Nazis like Henss could be put to more constructive pur­poses. 
As a young man, Paul Henss joined the Hitler Youth in 1934 and later volunteered to fight in the Waffen SS, Germany's elite com­bat organization. He fought in battles with the most infamous, decorated German divi­sion of the war, the first SS Panzer Division. On leave from his division, Henss spent two months patrolling the outer fences of Dachau and Buchenwald with a guard dog. Today, it's those two months that make Paul Henss a wanted man. 
Before we rush to deport a senior citizen for his role in one' of history's greatest atroci­ties, let's be clear about exactly what he did. Dachau and Buchenwald were concentration camps -not extermination camps -where prisoners were exploited for slave labor. As an exterior guard, Henss had little contact with victims, especially since his leave from the front lasted only two months. If he were a high-ranking officer or a camp commandant, his deportation would be much deserved, but this is not the case. 
For those who disagree and believe Henss is just as culpable as a high-ranking officer, the question remains -what would deporta­tion actually achieve? While any level of involvement in the Holocaust is appalling, deportation is not the best way to punish Henss. No matter how minor his role may have been, he did lie about his two month duty in order to enter the U.S. in 1955. Instead of deportation, which achieves noth­ing, Henss should be required to travel to the National Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C., at his own expense, to host a public lec­ture on his role in the Holocaust. This kind of event not only forces Henss to confront his past, but also offers the opportunity for oth­ers to hear how a perpetrator of history's most infamous atrocity fell under the spell of a twisted, murderous ideology. 
No one is asking Nazi-hunters to stop hunt­ing aging Nazis in hiding, but we do need to start demanding'more constructive solutions.

Liberal radio limited by low popularity 
After reading Andrea Laidman's "Hosting Ignorance," (Oct. 1), I came away fairly certain that Laidman is ignorant of how the free market really works. She claims conservative talk radio dominates the airwaves, quoting figures from the Center for American Progress. Having never heard of this group, I decided to do some research on them. 
I found out that I actually agree wholeheartedly with a statement of their "About Us" section that seems to apply to this debate. They say, "As pro­gressives we believe that America should be a country of boundless oppor­tunity -where all people can better themselves through education, hard work, and the freedom to pursue their dreams." 
Freedom, though, seems to be what Laidman finds as the problem in the 
U.S. radio market. She claims that the conservative leanings of widely syndi­cated radio hosts are due to "structural imbalances and not popular demand." She also later quotes the Center saying that "the relaxation of ownership rules have tipped the scales against localism." So here we have a situation where free­dom is not what we want-apparently allowing more free choice somehow "tips the scales." 
Corporations, including those in radio, are driven by profits. In radio, that means advertising dollars, and advertis­ing revenue is driven by ratings. Ultimately, it is the listeners who decide what they listen to, and apparently they like listening to the content on the air, because Laidman says that "90 percent of Americans age 12 or over tune into radio programs each week." Laidman says that "Radio outlets like NPR demonstrate that longer stories can facilitate in-depth discussion of contro­versial issues through thoughtful, well­reasoned arguments, inquiry and inter­views." 
If NPR is what people want to listen to, what is really in "popular demand," then why don't they dominate the rat­ings? It is on the air -it's just that there is not much demand for this kind programming. Air America Radio, a group that also describes itself as "pro­gressive," was founded in March 2004 to provide an avenue for left wing radio. In our free market, they were allowed to do this. They were also allowed to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy a little more than 30 months later, because they had few listeners and no money. 
Laidman seems to believe that access to radio outlets is what limits liberal radio -this has been proven to be inaccurate by the lack of success of NPR and Air America. Americans have shown that we do not want to listen to left wing radio. I am glad that we are free to listen to whatever we want. I find it ironic that many "progressives," who claim to be champions of free speech, selectively back this freedom when they agree with what is said.

REVIEW: HALO 3 FINISHES THE FIGHT 
By DAMON JASON Scene Writer 
Halo 3's single player campaign starts where its predecessor left off. Master Chief is pursuing the Prophet of Truth to stop him from activating the "sacred rings,'' which would destroy everything in the universe. 
Many fans were disappointed with this difl11anger ending of Halo 2. as well as
 
the repetitive level design, and Bungie's decision to have Master Chief's story take a backseat to what was happening within the internal ranks of the Covenant. All of these issues are addressed this time around, and make for a very solid and engrossing campaign. 
If Halo 3's single player campaign can be faulted for anything it would be for being too short. The single player mode is only nine levels and lasts a little more than 10 hours on the normal difficulty. Veteran Halo players should play the cam­paign on a harder difficulty, because the default difficulty is simply too easy. 
This is not to say the campaign is not 
·· fun. While there are certain sections of the game where backtracking is neces­sary, this is kept to a minimum. The action is solely on Master Chief and his marines. From the start of the game, the action picks up almost instantaneously. The single player campaign is so engross­ing that it is very hard to put the con­troller down once you start. 
Tired of playing alone? You can play through any of the nine campaign levels via system link or ·over Xbox Live. This adds a level of replay that was not avail­able on previous iterations of the game. 
The final chapter or the Halo trilogy has benefited from the added graphical prowess of the Xbox 360. Everything is beautifully done. All of the in-game envi­ronments look simply amazing, and the attention to detail deserves much praise. Surfaees such as the armor of cortain 
Halo 3 
Developer: Bungie Platform: XBox 360 

vehicles show rellections in real time. The water physics are simply beautiful -the developers even took refraction into account. 
The multiplayer has essentially carried this title since it was released. In the past, there have been many issues with weapon balance, ranging from certain weapons being too powerful to .every map having a limited number of "power weapons." Everything has been tweaked to make for a much more balanced multiplayer game. 
Speaking or weapons, Bungie has creat­ed quite a few new additions. Of tlwse new weapons, the Spiker is probably the most balanced. 
A surefire soon-to-be favorite is the Gravity Hammer, which is essentially a large hammer that can take vehicles out of commission, so you can imagino what it can do to your opponents. There are even some tweaks to old weapons. It's no longer embarrassing to dio at the hands of a Needler because its damage has been upped significantly. 
The multiplayer maps are just plain run. Tl).ere are 11 maps right now, but there will be more offered later as download­able content. Bungie has attempted to make sure that these maps never get old by offering a sort or map editor, called Forge. While you can't alter the actual layout of the maps, you can change the location of vehides, weapons, spawn point and others. 
The multiplayer for Halo 3 is so good that it will keep players occupied until Butigie's next project. Many players will enjoy the new Saved Films mode. which allows you to save replays of your favorite in game moments. While this has been popular in sports titles for some time, it's relatively new for console shooters. 
Microsoft has also added a mode called File Share, in which you can upload your favorite videos to Xbox Live to share with the world. By default,. everyone is given 25 MB of space, although you can pur­chase more space if' desired. 
Bungie could have shippod 
Halo 3 with just the multi­player mode and the game would still have been impressive. Considering that you get the superb multi­player, the excellent single player campaign and a bevy of other features, Halo 3 is oaslly the most solid and complete game available for any console on the market today.

of the Arbiter. which is essentially a sym­bol for "blade of the Prophet's will." The role of the Arbiter is expected to be a death sentence as well. 
The story begins with Master Chief reeeiving awards for his work on Halo. However, the ceremony is cut short due to a Covenant invasion. 
Master Chief is charged with stopping the Covenant strike on Earth. Meanwhile, the Arbiter was tasked with assassinating a "heretic" (as labeled by the Prophets) Elite spreading "lies" about the true pur­pose of the sacred rings. After completing his mission, the Arbiter starts to question his loyalties to the Covenant. 
The stories of Master Chief and the Arbiter converge with the release of the Flood from Delta Halo, a second installa­tion built by the Forerunners. 
Things get convoluted when mysterious Flood creature called the Gravemind manipulates both the Arbiter and Master Chief because they all have a "common" goal: To prevent the rings from being acti­vated. Gravemind sends the Arbiter and 
. Master Chief in separate directions to pre* ·· .vent The High Prophets from activating Delta Halo. 
Master Chief goes to the Covenant city called Iligh Charity, an immense space sta­tion. and pursues the remaining Prophets. During his mission, he finds himself.in the middle of a Covenant civil war between the Brutes and the Elites (who were the former protectors of the Prophets). 
After capturing a Covenant ship, the Flood arrives at the city and begins infect­ing the population. The only remaining High Prophet, Truth, escapes on a ship located in the core of lligh Charity. The Mastnr Chief stows away on board and leaves Cortana behind in order to destroy Delta Halo and High Charity if th¢ Brute eaptain Tartarus aetivates the ring. 
The Arbiter, with the help of fellow Elites and human marines. manages to stop the ring from being activated. However, the unexpected shutdown causes the ring to send a signal out to the other remaining Halos, sending them all into a "standby" mode so they can be remotely activated from the Ark, which is a device that can aetivate all of the remaining rings, 
Meanwhile, thn ship that Master Chief is stowed away on approaches Earth. The game ends with the Chief being questioned by one of Earth's patrol services regarding what he is doing aboard the ship. The ChiHf' answers by stating, "Sir, flnishing this light, sir."

On Saturday, the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center held a screen­ing of the D.W. Griffith's 1915 film, "Birth of a Nation." It was the flrst seg­ment of a three-part series presented by the DPAC that was intended to con­textualize this controversial mm. 
The title is well known, and is infa­mous for its horrendously racist con­tent. The film is split into two parts, the first focusing on the Civil War and the second on Reconstruction. Both parts feature the interaction of two families, the Camerons and the 
Stonemans, who rep­resent families of the South and North, respectively. The first part of the film is somewhat pedantic to the modern day viewer -not really illuminat­ing or surprising in any particular respect. But as the t1Im launch­es into its second part, a markedly different picture comes into view. The film's posi­tion on Reconstruction becomes evident when a more obvious racist mentality comes into play.

DJ Spooky relies on 

ment technique for the Ku Klux Klan. It characterizes the post-war years as ones that were rife with persecution of whites and upheaval of the white-dem­ocratic standard followed by the insti­tution of an uneducated black anarchy. 
Terms such as the "Aryan birthright" emerge, attempting to unite whites against blacks in a new racial war. 
From a cinematographic perspective, the lengthy film was a masterpiece of its time. It had a large budget and excellent scenes and special effects. From a social and political perspective, the film twisted the events of Heconstruction into a fabricated histo­ry that served to recruit KKK members and dehumanize African-Americans. 
Due to the obvious offensive nature of the content, the Performing Arts Center has framed the film as part of a three­part series. On Tuesday night, there was a panel presentation that sought to gain a variety of perspectives from a cross-section of academic areas such as the Department of Film, Television, and Theatre, Africana Studies and the Center for Social Concerns.

Powerful offenses collide 
Phillies, Rockies look for big bats to make statements in hitters' ballparks 
Associated l'ress 
PIIIL/\DELPIIIA-Pitchers beware: Two potnnt offenses plus two hitter-friendly ball­parks could equal a slugfest. 
Tho Philadelphia Phillies and Colorado Hoekies got to this point mainly because of their hitting. And, they'll need to kenp swinging to advance. 
c;ame I of this NL first-round series is WednBsday at Citizens Bank Park, th11 East Coast ver­sion of Coors Field. Both teams are sending thnir aces to the mound -Cole llamels (15-5) for the Phillies and Jell" Franeis 

-(17-9) for the Hockies. But it'll be thn hitters gntting most of the attention. Philly has Jimmy Hollins, Chase Utley, Hyan lloward, Pat Burrell and Aaron Howand. Colorado brings Matt llolliday, Todd llelton. (;arn~tt Atkins, Brad llawpe and Troy Tulowitzki. /\II these guys can flat-out hit no matter where they play. lfowever, many often find themselves explaining why it's easier to have success at homn. Balls hav11 bnen flying out in Philly since the Bank opened in 2004. The dimensions are rather standard, 329-330 feet down the lines, 37 4 to Jell-cen­ter and 401 to straightaway center. But for some r11ason. there's far more homers hit thew than at tlw old Veterans Stadium. Perhaps the op(\n-air outfield allows the wind to play too much a factor. Maybe tlw pownr-allnys aren't deep enough. Whatever th11 ease, it plays small. "Tiw ball S!H1JJIS to carry more," Hollins said. "Maybe it just looks small, so people feel a little strong11r.

I've always said when you hit a hall and it's a home run. it doesn't matter whern you are playing. If you hit it here 10 rows deep, that's out of any other ballpark." There's a much easier expla­nation for all the scoring at Coors. Blame it on the high altitude. Balls dry out in the thin, arid air, making them slicker and harder to grip. Thnm's also less air resistance, causing breaking balls to nat-

llome run totals have decreased significantly at Coors over the past decade ­sevoral years ago, the Rockies installed a humidor to store baseballs and control their moisture. Still, it remains the best park to hit in. 
Batters had a .286 average in Colorado this season, high­est in the majors. It was sec­ond in runs at 874 and ninth in homers at 1R5. Meanwhile, the Bank led the majors with 241 homnrs and was third in runs at 871. Batters hit .277 in I'hilly. 
"Hngardless of where you play, you still have to get it and hit it," lloward said. "Sometimes the wind may be blowing in at a field that's con­sidered to play large and if you hit in the air, it might go out. You still have to hit it. You still havn to put a good swing on it for it to go." 
Iloward ean hit them out of the Grand Canyon. He had 24 of his 47 homers on the road. Hollins and Burrell each had 30 homers. Hollins had 12 on the road and Burrell 14. 
But a few of Colorado's slug­gers had far better power numbers at Coors. Holliday hit 25 of his 36 homers at home. 
liawpe's home-away ratio was 19-10 and Tulowitzki's 15-9. 
"It's changed," Hockies man­ager Clint II urdle said of the Hockies' park. "The elevation is not going to change, but the ballpark is not as much hitter­friendly as it used to be. It plays out much diiTerent than it has in the past." 
Since the Bank opened in 2004, it ranks third in homers with 903. Coors is eighth in that span at 744. 
But, the .294 batting average in Colorado over the past four years is by far the highest. Kansas City's Kauffman Stadium is second at .279. 
"They have thin air and long deep gaps, so balls fall in and it's the complete opposite here," Hollins said. "We have no gaps, but you hit it over somebody's head and it's going to go out. If you don't have pitchers that can pitch to the ballpark, you can find yourself in a lot of high-run games." 
As the weather cools down, balls obviously travel less. That was clear in Philadelphia's weekend series against Washington. 
"Howard hit two balls against the Nationals that he absolutely crushed that were only three rows deep," Howand said. 
Attention on A-Rod as Yankees face Indians

NEW YORK-Everywhere 
Alex Hodriguez went, the lenses 
were on him. 

When he took batting practice, 
the cameras clicked. In the club­
house, so many mini-cams 'l'\'ant­
ed to capture his words and 
image that he had to move away 
from his locker to the center of 
the room. 

Not that he had much to say, just a collection of cliches so old that he probably chuckled to himself as he said them. He's made a concentrated ell"ort since spring training not to reveal his thinking, to focus on the field. 
And who could blame him? 
Why concentrate on his past 
postseason performances? JIe is 
4-for-41 (.098) with no HBis in 
his last 12 playoft" games and hit­
less in his last 15 postseason at­
bats with runners in scoring 
position. His own failures are a 
big reason baseball's best player 
has never reached the World 
Series. 

When the Yankees were elimi­
nated during each of his first 
three seasons in New York, A­
Hod was the top target in the 
blame game. Chances are, the 
fate of the pinstripes this 
October will turn on his per­
formance starting Thursday in 
the first-round series against 
Cleveland. 

"I think his mind-set definitely changed," Johnny Damon said. "He was always out trying to please people, try to do, say the right things." 
A-Hod cut down his appear­ances in the media and increased 'em on the leader board. 
Hodriguez hit 54 homers and had 156 HBis this season, an onslaught likely to earn him his third AL MVP award. From the seventh inning on, he batted .349. Yankees captain Derek Jeter said he'd never seen an offensive performance like it. 
New York fizzled to a 21-29 start. llad Hodriguez not hit 14 home runs in April, the Yankees could have been about 15-35. 
"I don't think we would have made the playoffs if it wasn't for him," Andy Pettitte said. "Without him, I don't think we would have really had a shot down here at the end." 
These could be Hodriguez's final games in New York. Since his very first day at spring train­ing, he's been asked about that opt-out clause, the one that allows him to bolt the final three seasons of his record $252 mil­
lion, 10-year contract and seek 
even more money in the free­
agent market. 

lie's avoided talk about that~ 
he doesn't have to make a deci­
sion until the 1Oth day after the 
World Series ends. Before then,

"This is probably the most comfortable he's been in the time he's been hern, in my esti­mation," Yankees manager Joe Torre said. "lie just seems like he's had more fun this year, even during games, whore at other times you could see him grinding out a little bit too much." 
Torre talks to A-Hod a lot. In 
describing the team's most-dis­
sected psyche, Torre sounds 
more guidance counselor than 
manager. 

"I think he sort of internalizPd a lot last year and in doing that, I think he really built up a lot of baggage," Torre said. "lie's tried to be a lot of things to a lot of people, and this year I think he spent a lot more time just trying to help himself." 
Can't argue with the results. Rodriguez especially f(~asted on Indians pitchers, gobbling them up like a kid eating Milano cook­ies. He was 8-for-24 with 13 RBis as the Yankees swept the six-game, regular-season series, and six of his hits were home runs. 
lie thinks his attitude played as big a part as his improved mechanics at the plate. 
"Coming into spring training, it seems like yesterday, I said that I was in a good placn," Rodriguez said. 
What did that entail? 

"I lave an opportunity to laugh at myself," he said. "I haven't done that too much over the last three years, and this year I kind of laughed at myself along with all my teammates at me all the time."

Rodriguez was interested in Yankees history, wondering where his RBI total ranked among Ruth, Gehrig and DiMaggio (A-Hod was 1Oth) and why in the early days of Yankee Stadium, the RBI totals were so high (the center-field fence was 490 feet from the plate through 1936).

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -In an end to a salacious three-week trial, a jury ordered the owners of the New York Knicks to pay $11.6 million to a former team executive who endured crude insults and unwanted advances from coach Isiah Thomas. 
The jury of four women and three men found Thomas and Madison Square Garden sexually harassed Anucha Browne Sanders, but it decided only MSG and chairman James Dolan should pay for harassing and firing Browne Sanders from her $260,000-a-year job out of spite. 
The result: The Garden owes $6 million for con­doning a hostile work envi­ronment and $2.6 million for retaliation. Dolan owes $3 million. Though Thomas is off the hook for any damages, he leaves the case with a tarnished image. 

Outside court, a beaming Browne Sanders insisted her victory was more about sending a message than the money. 
"What I did here, I did for every working woman in America," she said. "And that includes every­one who gets up and goes to work in the morning, everyone working in a cor­porate environment." 
Earlier, Thomas, who led Indiana to the 1981 NCAA championship and coached the Pacers during 2000­03, emerged from the fed­eral courthouse in lower Manhattan with his trade­mark smile but flashed anger as he reasserted his innocence amid a crush of reporters and cameras. 
''I'm extremely disap­pointed that the jury did not see the facts in this case," he said. "I will appeal this, and I remain confident in the man that I am and what I stand for and the family that I have." 
MSG said it will appeal, also denying wrongdoing in a case widely viewed as a public relations disaster for a franchise struggling to regain credibility. The team hasn't won a playoff game since Thomas was signed as president in December 2003 and has wasted millions this decade on a series of free­agent busts. 
The verdict also amounts to another blemish on the resume of Thomas, a two­time NBA champion whose post-playing career has been marked by one fail­ure after another. 
NBA spokesman Tim Frank said the league's policies "do not encompass civil litigation." 
Jurors, who needed roughly two days to decide on the allegations but only about an hour to deter­mine damages, declined to talk about the verdict.

Playoff tested Beckett, Lackey to start Game 1 
Red Sox, Angels will open tonight at 6:30 
Associated Press 

BOSTON -Josh Beckett was just 23 the last time he pitched in the postsnason. eoming back on thn~n days' rest to shut mit the New York Yankees and elinch the World Series for Florida. 
John Lackey was a 24-year­old rookie when he won Came 7 of the 2002 Series for the Angels. 
The two big-game vnterans will start things oil' in Game l of their !\1. division series on Wednesday when the East champion Boston HPd Sox play West champion Los Angeles. With Beckett facing Lackey in the opener. the only suro bet is that they won't be crumbling under tlw pr~>ssure. 
"lie's been in these big games just like I have, and done extrnnwly well," Lackey said. "I mean, throwing a shutout to win a World SPries. it doesn't get much better than that. I le's obviously got great stuiT and it's going to bt1 a great challenge for us. I'm going to have to pitch Wl'll to give our guys a ehancn." 
Now 27. Beckett was the MVP of the '03 Series after beating the Yankees in the Game 6 finale. !\!ready flush with eonli­denc.e, he grew stubborn in his suc1:ess and became convinced that his best pitch in every situ­ation was to blow his fastball by tlw hitter. 
That resulted in some rough starts last year -his first in 

Boston -and a whopping 36 
home runs allowed, along with 
a 5.01 EHA. 
"You learn a lot through fail­urn and through succeeding,'' Beckett said after the Red Sox worked out at Fenway Park on the day before the playofT open­er. "!\s you get older, obviously, you're still learning. But I think you learn a lot of crudal things along thn way. But I don't think anybody will ever consider their learning process completed in this game." 
Mixing in his curveball and changeup more this season, he became the majors' first 20­gamn winner in two years. lie also rnached a career high with 194 strikeouts while topping 200 innings and cutting his homer total to 17. 
"We've seen a young guy work so hard and mature so much, and he became the guy that we really needed him to bncome," Boston manager Tnrry Francona said. "Every good tnam has guys like that ­whern you say, 'This is our guy, and go get 'em.' 
"!\nd he'll respond to adversi­ty, and he competes. He's got a lot of different weapons. !\nd you IHJnd that, because we're playing a good team." 
!\nd facing a piteher who's every hit thP. bulldog as Beckett. 
Although Lackey was smiling and joking around at Tuesday's workout -Beckett was all seowl -Angels manager Mike Scioseia knows that, onee the gamn starts, his ace is plenty snrious. In Lackey's mind, a visit to the mound is the open­ing bid in a negotiation. 
"Anytime he comes out of the game, he's upset. He wants 10 more pitches or 15 more pitch­es," Scioseia said. "This guy's one of the best competitors I've been around in 30-plus years. ... He's channeled his emotions into something that's positive out there to get to the next piteh. 

"lie had the ability to get to the big leagues, but to do it under the most powerful of mieroscopes, the playoffs, the pennant raee, whatever the sit­uation might be. Obviously his success in the playofl's in piteh­ing Game 7 of a World Series shows the confidence we have in him.'' 
Lackey, 28, set career highs this season with 19 wins, a 3.01 EHA, 224 innings and a 3.44 strikeout-to-walk ratio. 
But heading into the series against Boston. he will be draw­ing upon his playofT experienee. In addition to the five games he pitched in '02, Laekey also made three starts in the 2005 playoffs when the Angels knoeked out the Yankees in the first round before losing to the Chieago White Sox in the AL championship series. 
No game was as big as the World Series elineher, when he allowed one run in live innings to lead the Angels to a 4-1 vie­tory over the San Francisco Giants. 
"I was a rookie, I was coming up with a lot of veterans. I was just hoping to contribute at that point," Lackey said. "I was pret­ty mueh a two-piteh pitcher that year. I've got more options these days. If one thing is not working, I've got a few more things in my bag I can go to.''

Cavanaugh a first and goal on the 10-yard line with plenty of time on the clock. Sophomore receiver Sarah Cline caught the go-ahead touchdown pass to put the Chaos on top again, 13-8. 
"Elisa Suarez and Sarah Van Mill made some excellent plays, and Katie Dunn really maintained composure on our second touchdown drive," Martini said. "She really helped keep the team focused and the intensity high." 
The Ducks' took over the ball with one last chance to score and a minute and a half on the clock. Cavanaugh's usually strong defense was unable to cover the Howard receivers, and Bishop was able to create a drive with rapid-fire passes to Robinson and sophomore co-captain Mary Jenkins. With four sec­onds left in the game, Hobinson caught the ball in the end zone to win the game, 14-13. ~ 
"Our final touchdown drive, and the fact that we never gave up, shows how intense and passionate we all are for Howard football," Jenkins said. "Last year, we won only one game and struggled to find eight players for the games. This year we have twelve, but we finally made the playoffs." 
Junior co-captain Kate Sylvia was thrilled to have defeated a large, powerhouse team like Cavanaugh. 
"We may be small, but Howard's got a big ol' heart," she said. 
Walsh 12, Farley 0 
Walsh has established itself as the team to beat, defeating Farley's Finest 12-0 and extending their winning streak to five games. 
Both the offense, led by sen­ior quarterback Mary Claire Sullivan, and the defense, lead by senior Julie Campbell, established control of the game and came out with another efficient victory. 
Early on, however, Farley looked as if it might pull out an upset, driving down the field into the red zone multi­ple times. Some key plays in the secondary by Campbell and an interception junior Meghan Soriano staved off the Finest and held them score­less in the first half. 
The Walsh offensive squad looked a little out of sync early. The Farley secondary pressed the receivers hard and the line forced Sullivan to rush her throws. However, after Soriano's interception, Sullivan and sophomore receiver Sierra Smith led the Wild Women down the field, the drive culminating in a last-second touchdown pass to freshman Lindsey Schanzer. 
"With basically the whole dorm showing up to support us during wild week, it really fired our team up," Smith said. "We all pitched in, and the victory was a real team effort."

While Notrn Dame has rein­forcements on the way in Thomas and Samba, the Irish lineup continues to be altered by other injuries. Senior forward Kurt Martin will have to miss some time due to an ankle injury he re­aggravated this past Friday against Cincinnati. Senior defender Kyle Dagan also left Friday night's game with an injury. 
"The nice thing with the injuries has been that we've been able to get some younger players involved, whieh is great because down the line it's only going to make us deeper and stronger," Clark said. 
Tonight's game will be the seventh meeting between Notre Dame and Michigan, with the Irish holding a 5-0-1 edge in the all-time series. The last meeting took place last year in Ann Arbor with Notre Dame winning 2-0 on two goals from senior for­ward Joseph Lapira.

ther wa..s per!eet," Weis said. 
When Sharpley entered the game, the Irish trailed 26-(>, but two touchdown passes by the junior brought the scorn to 2(>-19 before a game-clinching touch­down by Purdue. 
Wnis said that while Clausen is still going to be the starter if he's healthy enough. Notre Dame is fortunate to have two quarter­backs with game exporienee. 
"They both have done a very good job progressing and running the tnam," he said. 
Combined. Sharpley and Clausen threw for 377 yards against the Boilermakers, over 200 more yards than the Irish had passed for in any other game this year. 
Weis said the improvement was partially because he made the quarterbacks practice without play calling wristbands all last week. 
"Last week was a turning point with both of them going from calling plays to running plays," Weis said. ''They did a lot better job of running the offense in praetice." 
Weis said without the wrist­bands, Sharpley and Clausen had to foeus on the play being called. 
"It put a lot of pressure on them." he said. 'They didn't have the security blanket where you say, 'number three' and they just read it. They're not calling a play, they're just reading the play." 
Getting rid of the wristbands also took away a distraction li'Jr the signal callers as the team approached the line of scrim­magn. 
"Sometimes you'll see them go to the line of scrimmage and they'rn looking at the wristband again," Wnis said. "It's like, 'wait, what was that play again?"' 
Both quartnrbacks wore wrist­bands during the game against the Boilermakers. 
Injured players may return 

WeL<> said junior wide receiver David Grimes and sophomore offensive guard Dan Wenger are both "50/50" for the UCLA game. Grimes was. injured against Purdue, while Wenger has not played since the Michigan game Sept. 15. 
Maust takes over punting 

Sophomore Erie Maust handled Notre Dame's punting Saturday against Purdue instead of fifth­year senior C.JColl' Prien, and Weis 
said  Maust will  start  again  
against UClA  
Maust  kicked  three  times  

against the Boilermakers, aver­aging 44 yards pnr punt. 
Changing depth chart 

In addition to Maust, several other players moved up on the official Irish depth chart. Sophomore James Aldridge was moved to first string running back, with fil'th-year snnior Travis Thomas, snnior Junior Jabbie, and Ji·eshman Armando Allon all sharing the No. 2 spot. 
Offensive guard Matt Carufel and defensive end Dwight Stephenson were also ollicially moved into starting roles. The original starters in those posi­tions, Wenger and senior Justin Brown, are injured.

.... "They'rn the bnst Big Ten tnam I've seen." Clark said. "They transition well. They have some very good attack­ing players, and they're good on sot pinces.

Howard edges Chaos, Walsh defeats Farley

Sports Writers 

Howard (2-2-1) scored a last-minute touehdown to defe'at Cavanaugh 14-13 Tuesday, narrowly escaping defeat and seeuring a spot in the Blue Division playoffs. 
"It was a heart-breaking loss." Cavanaugh senior een­ter Jill Martini said. "I don't think anyone saw it coming." 
Both the Chaos, now 2-3, and Ducks eame out strong on defense. Howard junior Laura Giezeman intercepted a pass by Cavanaugh junior quarter­back Katie Dunn. The Ducks offense, however, was unable to capitalize on their great field position. 
Cavanaugh held the Ducks to less than 20 yards in the first half. 
The Cavanaugh offense struck first, scoring a touch­down on the last drive of the half. Senior Elisa Suarez and junior Sarah Van Mill caught Dunn's passes for a combined gain of 55 yards, bringing up first and goal for the Chaos. 

Dunn then complnted an S­yard pass to Van Mill for the touchdown and converted to Suarez to end the half leading 7-0. 
Howard's first drive of the second half ended abruptly with an interception by fresh­man Mary Kate Howard. but Giezeman and the DLJcks answered baek with another interception to launch Howard's first touchdown drive. 
Freshman quarterback Kayla Bishop complPted a pass to freshman reeeiver Kaitlin Hobinson for the touchdown. The Dueks then made a gutsy deeision to go for the two-pqint conversion, despite having lost to Walsh earlier this season bncausn of missed extra points. Howard eonverted and took the lead, making the seore 8-7. 
With Jess than six minutes left in the game, thE~ Chaos knew they had to aet quiekly.
