In Hearst trial 

Damaging evidence is admitted 
SAN FRANCISCO AP-The judge in the Patricia Hearst trial today rejected a defense bid to suppress incriminating evidence against the heiress taken from the last hideout of her terrorist traveling compan­ions. 
U.S. District Court Judge Oliver 
J. Carter ruled in a written memo­randum that Miss Hearst could not protest the use of documents taken from the home of Symbionese Liberation Army members William and Emily Harris. 
Carter ruled the heiress had "no possessory interest" in the docu­pons found in the Harrses' apart­ment. 
The most damaging item already introduced is hte so-called "Tania Interview," a manuscript the gov­ernment claims shows Miss Hearst embraced the revolutionary goals of the SLA. 
Carter made his ruling after listening to arguments from gov­vernment and defense attorneys. However, he later ruled that one of the disputed documents -a floor plan of a Sacramento bank ap­parently targeted for robbery ­must be suppressed because it might give jurors a false impres­sion that Miss Hearst is charged with a homocide at a different Sacramento bank. 
Among items not yet placed inot evidence is a diagram for the unrealized Sacramento bank robbry and a "laundry list" which U.S. Atty. James L. Browning said was a guide of what to do when robbing a bank. The government says some 
of  these  items  contain  Miss

without harming the professional­ism of teaching, Joseph Schwartz said last night. 
Schwartz, associate secretary of the American Association of Uni· versity Professors (AAUP), said that faculty unions have been most beneficial to the "downtrodden" faculty. 
"Some institutions have gained enormously,'' Schwartz said. "Others have been ripped off. On balance collective bargaining has been good for the profession as it is.'' 
Schwartz told an audience of 30 faculty members at the University Club that faculty unions have had different effects at different uni­versities. What often determines the effect on an institution is not the union itself, but how adminis­trators and faculty respond to their new roles.

Effect on academic freedom 
Schwartz argued that academic freedom and tenure have been neither diminished nor enhanced as a result of faculty unions. 
He cited the unique case of the Universtiy of Hawaii in which a propoal to limit tenure was made part of a collective bargaining agreement. The proposal was later rejected overwhelmingly by the entire faculty and the collective bargaining unit was replaced. 
Schwartz could cite no instances where academic freedom was en· hanced because of unionization. "I think it's a misrepresentation of reality that a set of principles can be changed by the bargainers," he

Judicial Board proposes guidelines for hall boards 
by Mary Mungovan 
Senior Staff Reporter 

The University Judicial Board proposed guidelines to standardize the procedure of hall judicial boards, John Lonsberg, judicial coordinator, announced Wednes­day after a closed meeting. 
The Judicial Board, which con­sists of six students, six faculty and six administration members, sug­gested guidelines for the jurisdic­tion, due process, ethical standards and appeal procedures of the hall judicial boards. 
"The Board's recommendations arc based on a proposal submitted last year by Dr. Ackerman," Lonsbcrg stated. "They're not designed to make all J-Boards identical or to limit their autonomy, but to insure that in each hall the J -board is functionally adequate and observes due process." 
The Board's report will be sub­mitted to the Student Life council for approval and then distributed to hall J-boards after break, according to Lonsbcrg. "Our goal is to parallel the University judicial sys­tem on the hall level." he added.

"Students have shown much confidence in Dean Roemer this year--the University Judicial Board has not yet been asked to meet," 
Lonsberg noted.

Theodore Hesburgh, University president. 
If a student commits a hall violation, the offense is heard by the rector or hall board. 
"Ideally, the student should have a choice," Lonsberg com­mented. "All 20 halls have J-boards in some form, with the average size somewhere between 10 and 20 members. Most boards hear one or two cases a year." 
The judicial board system at Notre Dame was begun in the late sixties, Lonsberg explained. Ini­tially they were used quite often, but in the last few years rectors have lost cofidence in their ability to handle problems," Lonsberg added. 
Brian McGinney, last year's judicial coordinator, conducted a survey which demonstrated "the need for improving the J-board situation in the halls," according to Lonsbcrg. "This year, we've attempted to make halls more aware of their potential," he co'ltinued.

L Tricksters fool SMC seniors with hoax letters 
~ 
by Mary Egan r Senior Staff Reporter 
A group of six students sent joke letters to some sehiors last Friday,
f which stated they were "two credit hours short of the graduation requirement.'' The letters suggested the recip­ients "take immediate action" and add the credits or else be unquali­fied "to graduate with your class this May." Besides being written on stolen stationery, the letters contained the forged signature of Gail P. Man­dell, the assistant to the vice president for academic affairs. Mandel termed the joke "silly." She said: "It's a terrible thing to forge someone's signature to per­petrate a practical joke. It's senseless under those circumstan­ces. The administrative assistant took "no official action" towards the studenjs, w49 lll'olo_gi.~~d to Man­dell. She felt none seemed necessary. ''The students were extremely contrite. They hadn't given it much thought. They realized the full implications only a~ter they had done it," she said. · Mandell felt the ruse "under­mines the trust that has to exist in any community, particularly an academic community." She continued, ''The only thing that stops people from ruining tbe trust is their own integrity and common sense." Mandell feels that if these things fail it is possible to get a bad scare. It took a whole day of Mandell's time to straighten out the letter's repercussions. She had to explain­to students that she had not sent the letter and that they were not in

Abortion passed easUy 
There was a sense of victory in the air during the roll-call vote for the abortion issue. The final tally was 495 in favor of the majority pro-life plank, 249 for the minority "pro­choice" plank, and 16 abstaining. Over the 15 states voted unani­mously for the pro-life proposal, and of the four Iaraest state delegations, only New York did not vote heavily in favor of the majority plank. 
There was a heated debate which lasted twenty minutes before the vote. The delegates were attentive and there was not as muo·l con­fusion as there had been dur1 ,g the busing debate later in the e\1 ming.

Let's Be Realistic 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii pat kearns 
For the hundreds, or maybe thousands, of Notre Dame students who prefer to let their lunch get cold (or colder) rather than delay reading the latest "Consider This" column, it seems worthwhile to clarify this author's stance in his January 30 column. For in the interim, this humble ci.tadel of journalistic integrity has been maliciously maligned by one Ken Hallett. His remarks may go unloved, but they cannot go unanswered! 
In the January 30 column, entitled "Funny Ideas", this author presented his reflections on conservative political thought in America today. That conservative thinking which provides the firm foundation for the practical solutions offered by the Right to the day to day problems of United States social and political life. And what are the principle tenets which form this conservative foundation? According to Mr. George H. Nash in his National Review essay (cited in the "Funny Ideas" column), there are four essential tenets, which are: (1) authority, (2) morals, (3) tradition, and (4) truth (particulary achieved by the great Classical and Christian

It is Ash Wednesday evening, and there is a lingering odor on my fingertips from the number of times today that I smeared burnt palm on the foreheads of Lenten penitents. Over and over, at two different Masses so far, I repeated the words: "Remember, man, you are dust and to dust you will return;" and at eleven o'clock I will repeat them again at a Mass in Farley chapel. Shakespeare said it more prettily, I think, but I couldn't use Shakespeare's words as a liturgical formula. I couldn't simply say: ''Golden lads and girls all must,/As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.'' I might think that, as I sign all those young Catholic heads with the blessed ashes. I might think that "Golden lads and girls all must/ As chimney-sweepers, come to dust;" but I mustn't say those words. If it is any comfort to bishops and liturgists who worry about such things. I didn't say them, and wouldn't say them, ever, at Mass. But I have to admit, I did think about them a lot this Ash Wednesday. 
Then, just a little while ago, I gave the invocation at the opening session of the Mol:k Convention. The golden lads and girls were there, and on some of them, you could see the smudges on their foreheads where a priest had put the sooty mark of the day, reminding them of their mortality. None of them acted as though they felt the least bit mortal; they laughed and clapped and cheered as though they were going to go on in life forever. They were pinned and ribboned and hatted with the names of their favorite candidates as though they expected that the country would go on forever. I am reasonably nervous that the country couldn't survive some of those candidates they support for president. If some of those candidates were elected, I'm not sure that the country would want to survive; and great numbers of us would migrate to Australia. But of course countries are pretty cocksure they are going to survive. You never hear any more of the people of a country putting on the sackcloth and ashes of repentance, declar­

A ntltural mixture of the new and the old 
l:an be sampled during the five-day 
bil:cntennial festival starting next Sunday 
on the campuses of the University of 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. 
Virtually all events are free and open to the 
publil:. 

The musical span of history will be most evident at the opening session next Sunday (March 7) at 3 p.m. as the Notre Dame Concert Band, Orchestra and Jazz Band combine for a patriotic concert ranging from the "Yankee Doodle" of the Revolu­tionary War to "Blues," a 1975 composi­tion. The musical selections will be interspersed with dramatic readings, also drawn from 200 years of the nation's history and including the works of its public figures and the thoughts of its immigrants. Conductors of the musical groups participating in the opening ses­sion, all members of Notre Dame's music faculty, are Robert F. O'Brien and James Phillips for the Concert Band, Ralph Lane for the Orchestra, and Rev. George Wiskirchen, C.S.C .. for the Jazz Band. The concert, which will be in the ACC will be followed by an address by Sen. William Proxmire of Wisconsin. 
Proxmire assumed the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by Joseph McCarthy following a special election in 1957. He was returned to the Senate in 1958, 1964 and 1970, the last time by a landslide in which he carried all of Wisconsin's 72 counties. He is a 1938 graduate of Yale University and also holds a master's degree in business and public administration from Harvard Uni­versity. He holds congressional records for consequetive roll votes and has earned a reputation as a severe critic of wasteful federal spending. The event is free and open to the public. 
Other speakers slated to speak during the festival week include Martin Diamond and Sydney Ahstrom, both Yale profes­sors; Peter Berger, currently a Rutgers professor; Bernard Cohen, a Harvard 
ing a fast, adm1ttmg that the country had sins for which God could humiliate it into the dust. Golden lads and girls might acknowledge their mortality, but a country never seems to recognize that death could overtake all that country's dreams and hopes and sacred promises. A country should be forced to read Kipling's Reces­sional. where the pride of empire is reminded of "the pomps of yesterday" that became "one with Nineveh and Tyre": "Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,/ Lest 
we forget, lest we forget ... '' 

So the golden lads and girls, marked 
with the dust of their mortality, gather into 
conventions that are half-carnival and 
near-circus. You think to yourself that a 
revival tent is what is really needed; not for 
the lads and girls who have rene":,ed their 
covenant under the sacramental sign of the 
Blood of the Lamb; but for the nation to 
whom the plains and the mountains. the 
rivers and the lakes, were given as an Eden 
restored, a Paradise regained, a Promised 
Land flowing with milk and honey. I am no 
Billy Graham, calling on a nation to fall on 
its knees before God, as though Huckle· 
berry Finn were confessing that his were 
the sins of the Prodigal Son. I am not an 
evangelist or prophet, preaching repent­
ance, bidding the country to come home to 
Jesus. But I wonder if there are not Ash 
Wednesdays that a nation has to face, 
sounding the trumpet and proclaiming a 
fast? 

This is the fasting that I wish: 
releasing those bound unjustly, 
untying the thongs of the yoke; 
Setting free the oppressed, break­
ing every yoke; 

Sharing your bread with the hun­
gry, sheltering the oppressed and 
the homeless; 

Clothing the naked when you see 
them, and not turning your back on 
your own. 

Then your light shall break forth 
like the dawn ...

It was really a very handsome mock convention, as reassuring as an old-fash­ioned Fourth of July picnic. The Varsity Band played ''The Star Spangled Banner''. The Glee Club sang "This Is my Country". There were helium-filled balloons, and a presentation of arms by the Army ROTC. There was excitement and patriotic fervor. The only thing wrong with the affair, I felt, was that there were no believable political candidates. There was not a single name that I saw or heard in that whole mock convention hall that was, as a presidential candidate, worth a leak-hole in the snow. Maybe middle-aged priests should keep their mouths shut on such things. Maybe it is the role of university chaplains to be flag-wavers and true-blue Americans in love with apple pie. Maybe old ex-English teachers should be satisfied with voting in every election for candidates who are the lesser of two evils. Maybe cynics like me should not share their fears with the young, for fear that the young may become disillusioned with the democratic process. Maybe clerics who have grown weary in a day filled with the Ash Wednesday rituals have no right to insist that countries, like churches, need their penitential fast days too. Maybe fat, faded Democrats shouldn't admit their sometimes fears as to whether America is intended to last forever as the home of the brave and the )3J1d of the free. 
Nixon said he wanted to tell the country what's right with America. Ford also wants to tell us what's right with the country. I know what's right with America; and it isn't Richard Nixon, and it isn't Gerald Ford. It is the youth of the country that are all right: the golden lads and girls who dare to dream the imperishable dream of the patriots ... the Glee Club singing "This is my Country", the ROTC color guard, and the band playing the National Anthem ... 
The ugliness of Vietnam and Watergate was the harm they did to the American dream; at least they harmed the Dream for me, and I don't see how it can be mended. not by the midget men who trudged in the

Today I saw young people at their prayers and at their politics. The fabric of their flesh was dust, they were told at Mass, and into dust it will return. The thought of their mortality didn't seem to discourage them. In the evening. at their convention, it was obvious that Watergate and Vietnam had not discouraged them either. Being with them was as cheerful as attending one of the War Bond rallies back in World War II. When Kate Smith sang "God Bless America," you knew we were going to win the blooJy war, and bring home the troops, and the lights would go on again all over the world. Tonight, as the golden lads and girls touched my doubt~ with their faith, I felt the lights coming on again. The candidates now on the busting~ may seem shabby; the country may seem shabby; I may feel shabby; but right now, the Dream that may have gone shabby seems as enduring as solid gold. 
Ash Wednesday evening, and I have shared today in the solemnities of liturgies and the ballyhoo of politics.! have seen the golden lads and girls turned into political creatures, and I am comforted. It was for them also, from the beginning. that Paradise was regained; to them, that Eden was restored; to them that the Land was Promised, as much as to any founding fathers. 
Up to now, I have not been enjoying the political street-walking of the candidates of the Bicentennial Year very much. After Ash Wednesday, I may enjoy it more because of the mortal children with an immortal Dream. I went to their rituals, and they came to mine. I gave them dust; they gave me hope. I shared my faith, and they shared theirs; and theirs was a faith that I have wept for as lost, hopipg I might find it again. It does not smell of mortality; but on Ash Wednesday my hand. like Lear's hand, smells of mortality. Dust can do that to your fingers; doubt can do that to your dreams.

The dramatic offering during the festival will be William Saroyan's "My Heart's in the Highlands," performed by the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Theater at 8:15 p.m. March 9 in O'Laughlin Aditorium at Saint Mary's College. Dr. Reginald F. Bain, associate professor of speech and drama, will direct the play.

Hate the dining halls ? there is still some hope 
by Jane Neff Staff Reporter 

Have you ever wanted to offer helpful suggestions to the Notre Dame Food Service, but didn't know how to make yourself heard? 
Well  the  Food  Service  Advisory  
Commission  is  working  to  help  
you.  according  to  Joe  Fiorella,  
chairman.  

·'The Advisory Commission ex­ists to function as a channel of communication between students and management, with the goal of improved food service for stud­ents," Fiorella stated. 
The Committee is comprised of eight Notre Dame students, four -A·ho cat in the North Dining Hall and four who eat in South. They meet periodically with the Food Committee Staff to discuss comp­laints and suggestions given them by other students. 
·Edmund Price, director of Food Services, feels very strongly about the importance of the Advisory Commission. "The Commission is our official contact with students," he began. "We're providing a service for students, and think it wise to try to see what they want." 
Citing examples to show that the Food Service does listen to Comm­ission input. Joe Corpora. comm­ittee member, said, "We asked for poached eggs. wheat bread, apples and Mr. Pibb, and we got them." Also a request to change steak night from Thursday to Tuesday was honored. 
"They've done a good job im­plementing what we've suggested he concluded. "But of course, there's always room for improve­ment." 
The three functions of the Com­mission, according to Phyllis Rose, Food Service Dietitian, arc comm­unicative, evaluative, and innov­ative. "They direct suggestions to us, evaluate the Food Service and help explain administrative policy to students." 
Emphasizing the importance of communication, Price stated, "So­metimes we don't sec the same

go on is an absolute disgrace. We can't let it go on," he said. 
As a remedy, Riegle proposed a national income maintenance pro­gram for the elderly. To this suggestion, Riegle received a stand ing ovation. 
Another stand in the Mock Convention platform which Riegle praised concerned the seniority system. "You carne straight out against the seniority system in Congress. In the House of Repre­sentatives, we changed the senior­ity system. We haven't made that change in the Senate yet,'' Riegle commented. 
Riegle criticized the misrepre­sentation of nonloyal Democrats. He cited Phil Hart's retirement from the Judiciary Committee as a result of the unfair effects of seniority. After eighteen years of service on the committee, Hart still did not have the chairmanship. Instead, the Judiciary Committee continues to be chaired by "the senator from Mississippi, Mr. Eastland, who calls himself a Democrat but is really a Republi­can" said Riegle. "We..llrnSi make a change in the Senate. We can make a change in the Senate." 
Congressman Riegle is running for the U.S. Senate this year. 
Riegle told the audience that self-government needs help. "We haven't made it work right. What we have now is special interest government," he said. 
Riegle believes that the Mock Convention has a definite purpose and importance in the election of a new president. "What this con­vention has to do is thrash out the issues. We've got to take that message right out the door, out to 
: the elections," he concluded. 
 ~It.,.' \ ..-~ .-1," .._~ ..... <;;--:" '~"... c ''.;.' 
things students see. Sometimes what they see is more important than what we see, but we have to know about it. The Commission is helpful in keeping us informed." 
Recently a 10 day survey was conducted by the Commission to evaluate the present dining cond­itions. "We didn't want it public­ized," said Julie Dunn, committee member and Student Coordinator at North Dining Hall, "So we completed the surveys ourselves, or asked roommates or close friends to do so." 
"It was vital to a successful outcome that the management have no prior knowledge of the surveys," she added. 
Co;pora feels the survey was representative of the student body because it contained complaints that he has heard over and over again. 
The survey pointed to the need to improve Sunday night meals and the taste of the coffee, and comp­lained of lines closing early. It also suggested an extention of breakfast hours. 
On the positive side, soups were complimented for their rich flavor and warmth. and breakfast was rated as quite good. 
Fiorella complimented the man­agement by saying, "Everything we suggest. they give an honest attempt to implement. And if it's not feasible, they tell us why." 
"We listen and act on what is plausible." Price commented. ·'But we must look at the long range change. Everyone likes and wants something different." 
And budget does enter into the consideration also, as Price pointed out. ''Two or three times a soft ice cream machine has been put into our budget, but each time it's been pulled out because of finances." 
"Foa; instance, right now a proper machine would cost $12,000. But we need a new roof 
on  North  Dining  Hall,  priced  at  
$14.000.  You  know  what has  to  
come first," he said.  

Another request that is some­times denied, is for a certain soft drink. "If you add something," 
stated Price, "You have to take 
something else away. We only 
have so many soft-drink tabs and so 
not everyone can be satisfied. We 
aim at pleasing the majority." 
A major frustration for Corpora 
in serving on the Advisory Comm­
ission comes when something is 
agreed on to be implemented, then 
is not. "On steak nights they 
should have a second entree for 
people who are not filled by one 
steak, or people that don't like 
steak," Corpora said. "The Food 
Service agreed to a second entree 
but has not served one up to now." 
Likewise, he objects to students who constantly complain, even when nothing can be done. Dunn agrees, saying that students don't always realize that certain sug­gestions just aren't feasible. 
"We're in the top 10 percent of the country in food service," Price explained. "But that doesn't mean we're perfect. We have to keep our ears to the ground and listen to the 
students." 
"I'm sure there arc many more Fiorella added that positions on students suggestions and the Food Service Advisory Com­complaints," Corpora concluded. mission, including chairmanship.
"People just don't know how to are open for next year and re­channel them. But that's what the quested that interested students Advisory Commission is here for." contact him at 6795.

with women for the past year and a half, Soens has dealt with many passive women who come to the center for counselling and group assertiveness workshops. 
Soens and a half-dozen other women started the Women's Cen­ter on a shoestring with volunteer counsellors and donated space. They were funded by the Indiana office of Manpower, last May. The Center in South Bend is one of only two in the state and 300 in the country. 
Soens and Kish ended the three­hour program with a slightly­dwindled audience broken into small groups and enacting asser­tive behavior in various personal situations.

Irish accept Midwest tourney berth 
by BiU Brink -... ' Sports Editor 
Notre Dame was offered and has accepted an at-large berth in the Midwest Regional of the NCAA basketball tournament yesterday afternoon. The Irish will open up against the winner of the Metro-Six Conference next Saturday in Lawrence, Kansas. 
This will be the Irish's second bid in a row to the Midwest Regional. Last year they lost in the regional semifinals to Maryland in '.as Cruces, New Mexico. Two years ago they were knocked off in the semifinals of the Mideast Regional by Michigan. 
Notre Dame's opponent will not be determined until Saturday when the Metro-Six concludes their playoff for a tournament berth. Louisville, Cincinnati and Memphis State are the favorites. If the Irish win their opening game they'll advance to Louisville, Kentucky to face the winner of the Missouri Valley Conference (Wichita St. or So. lllinois)-Michigan t'ontest. to be played at N. Texas St. 
Other games in the Midwest Regional include Big Eight Champion Missouri against the University of Washington at N. Texas St. and Southwest Conference winner Texas A&M vs. the ECAC upstate New York division winner. 
Two opening-round Mideast Regional games will be played here at the Notre Dame ACC next Saturday. Big Ten Champion Indiana will squre off against the loser of the Rutgers-St. John's game and Mid-American Conference winner Western Michigan will battle either Virginia Tech, or the runner-up of the Big Eight (probably Kansas St.). 
All of the playoffs for tournament berths are expected to be completed by Saturday, and the final pairings wl11 be decided Sunday.

Home-ice advantage on the line as icers face Wisconsin 
by Ernie Torriero 

Two years ago, Notre Dame traveled to Wisconsin facing possi­ble elimination from the playoffs. This year the Irish again journey to America's Dairyland to close out the season. Only this year, the roles are reversed with the Badgers needing a two-game sweep if they are to continue play this season. 
Indeed Wisconsin chances of making it to post-season play are very slim. The Badgers are mired in tenth place in the WCHA, four points away from Denver and Minnesota-Duluth. If Denver ma­nages one win or a tie versus Colorado College. the Wisconsin is eliminated from contention. 
The Irish situation is more complex. though more desirable. Notre Dame, 18-14-2, needs just one more point this weekend than Michigan to assure themselves of home-ice advantage in the first round of the WCHA playoffs. Michigan plays a two-game home­and-home series with second place Michigan State. 
However. should the Irish and 
Michigan, currently mired in fourth

place with 32 points each, have the same kind of weekend, the Wol­verines would get the home-ice advantage and host Notre Dame because they scored more goals in the four games between the two teams. 
"We feel that from our play the past few weeks we are beginning to gel as a team," Notre Dame coach Lefty Smith explained. "We hope to have the same kind of momen­tum this weekend versus Wiscon­sin. It would be nice to end up in third place." 
Smith is hoping for a doubleirish win and a double loss by Minnesota. If Michigan were to split, the Irish would vault into third place and play Colorado College at home in the playoffs. 
''The league has been very up and down this year," Smith conti­nued. "Any club is capable of beating the other club in the league. Wisconsin, though in last place will be very tough this weekend." 
Crowds of over 8,000 are ex­pected for each game this weekend and the fans will be treated to inspired hockey. For the Irish to win twice this weekend, they once again must meet the challenges of a hostile crowd and of playing without two of their top stars. 

Premier right-winger Alex Pirus was ejected from Saturday night's contest for fighting. Second-line right-wing Kevin Nugent went the same route later in the evening. 
"Losing Pirus and Nugent isn't going to help us," Smith ex­plained. "The rules don't allow us to replace them. Yet our squad has fought adversity all year long. I think we are ready for the chal­lenge even though it will be very difficult for both clubs to play Sunday afternoon after having to play a game the night before." 
Wisconsin, in the midst of its worst hockey season in almost a decade, is 9-19-2 for 20 WCHA points. Sophomore defenseman Craig Norwich paces the Badger attack. The 5-11, 175 pound sophomore has netted 11 goals and 26 assists for 37 points. Center Mike Eaves is right behind with 35 points. Dave Herbst, another center is the Wisconsin goal-leader with 15 goals. 
Acting coach, Bill Rothwell, tak­ing over while Badger coach Bob Johnson is on leave with the Olympic team. places the goal­tending chores in the capable hands of Mike Dibble. Dibble. who had some personal problems at mid-season, posts a 4.9 goals­again!\! av~rage. 
IRISH ITEMS: The Walsh line has 
153 points on the season. Walsh 
heads the assist column with 43 
and Pirus is the leading goal-getter 
with 24. 
The Irish will headquarter at the 
Sheraton-Inn in Madison. The 
team will leave by bus late this 
afternoon and return Sunday fol­
lowing the game. 
The Irish and w;~consin have 
already met twice thL season. On 
December 5, the Irish gained a S-3 
victory as Brain Walsh netted the 
first Notre Dame hat trick of the 
year. The following night, Notre 
Dame's dimutive goalie Len Moher 
made 53 saves, including 26 in a 
scoreless second period, as the 
teams skated to a 2-2 overtime tie. 
II were Alumnill. Cavanaugh II, Pangborn II and Grace V. These four move into the semi-finals which will be played this Sunday. 
Division I 
Cavanaugh I boasted four men scoring double figures as they dumped Alumni II by a score of 53-44. Jim Singer and Bill Igoe both scored 12 points while Greg Garcia and Mike McGlinn added 10 to II points respectively. Alumni was up at the end of the first quarter and tied 21-21 at the half as both teams were shooting poorly. Cavanaugh opened it up slowly in the third quarter and then put it away in the fourth quarter. John Dubenetsky played brilliantly for Alumni taking game scoring honors with 19 points (scoring 16 of Alumni's points in the second half). 
Bill Flannigan added 10 points for the losers. 
The battle for basketball king in Grace Hall never came through as Grace III handed a forfeit win to Grace II. Grace II was 7-2 during the regular season while Grace III posted a S-4 mark. 
In one of the many close games in the playoffs Dillon I slipped by Keenan I by a score of 60-58. Keenan seemed to have this game under control in the first half as they raced out to a 31-24 lead. Dillon gradually came back behind several buckets by Chuck Mc­Pherson and Paul Martin. The lead switched hands several times in the second half. McPherson ended up with 16 points (11 in the second half) and Martin finished with IS points. Kevin Doherty also added 13 points. Mike Banks took game scoring honors pouring in 21 points for Keenan. The Wilks brothers, Dan and Greg, each scored 12 points in the losing cause. 
St. Ed's posted a minor upset in the closest game of the playoffs by edging Morrissey I 50-49. Morri­ssey went 7-1 during the regualr season and was the favorite in this game as St. Ed 'shad to win a playoff game to get a birth in the tournament. The game went as expected in the first half as Morrissey blazed to a 31-23 halftime lead and looked as though they were going to blow the game wide open. St. Ed's just kept chipping away atthe lead in the second half and nipped Morrissey n a hectic finish. St. Ed's relied on a very tough defense in the second half holding Morrissey to a mere 18 points. Dave Schlitchting and Mark Hardig led the way for St. Ed's scoring 14 points a piece. Tony Anzaone also broke into double figures scoring 10 points. Russ Lisch and Mike Vadas each scored 13 points fo! Morrissey. 
Division n An undefeated Alumni II team barely escaped the ending of their 
season in a 54-53 decision over Stanford III. Alumni, up by 10 points at the half way mark, had to hold off a late fourth quarter surge by Stanford to claim its victory. They were outscored 20-10 in the fourth quarter. Pete Green and Paul Kelley totalled 25 points in the first half for Alumni but were held to one point between them in the second half. Keeley finished with 15 points while Green scored 11 points. Jim Philbin als added 14 points for the winners. "Star of the game" had to go to Gary Thomp­son who led all scorers with 20 points. He scored 14 of hs 20 points in the second half with 10 points coming in the fourth quart­er. Dave Gorecki and Mark Ewald added II and 12 points respectively for Stanford. 
Cavanaugh III trounced Off­Campus VI by a score of 57-SO. Cavanaugh was led by Marty Koppenhaffer and Roman Klos who were both in double figures. 
O.C.VI remained close for a while but Cavanaugh broke it open in the second half. Cavanaugh Ill will meet Alumni II in the semi-finals Sunday night. 
Pangborn II stumbled past Keenan Ill by a score of 37-24. The defense was dominant throughout the game as neither team could assemble much of an offense. Keenan scored 10 points in the first quarter but could only manage 14 points the rest of the game. Pat Holmes and Mark Sheppard led Pangborn's attack with 10 points a piece. Andy Salitius scored 11 points in a losing cause. 
Grace V turned back Flanner IV 48-39 to advance into the semi-fin­als. Grace jumped to a quick 21·13 halftime lead and then just exchanged baskets throughout the second half. Grace relied on a balanced attack. Paul Hukel topped Flanner with 10 points. Grace V goes up against Pangborn II Sunday night.
