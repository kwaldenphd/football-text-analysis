University switches to Common App 
Office of Admissions will accept standardized format next year with supplemental portion 
By MADELINE BUCKLEY 
NewsWrirer 
Prospective students will apply to Notre Uame through the Common Application next year as the Office of Admissions abandons its cus­tom application for the first time. 
The change was made to ease the rigorous admissions process for high school sen­
iors,  said  Dan  Saracino,  
director  of  the  Office  of  
Admissions.  

Students will be able to access the Common Application on July 1. 
The Common Application originated in 1975 when 15 private universities agreed to accept a single, standardized application for admission. More than 300 universities and colleges in the United States are now members of the Common Application. 

The Common Application is designed to let admissions officers evaluate all aspects of a candidate's record, Saracino said. 
"You, as an institution, have to be committed to viewing application files holistically­not just looking at numbers -and be committed to diver­sity," he said. 
Though Notre Dame has been asked to join the Common Application several times, the University said joining before this year "did­n't seem necessary." 
The Common Application was once considered new and 
experimental, Saracino said. 
"Now they have gotten all the kinks out of it," he said. "I have heard nothing but good things about it recently. Students and colleges are happy with it." 
Now that the Common Application is completely online and supported by strong software, its use will allow elimination of paper waste and confusion from written applications, Saracino said. 
"It will be much more effi­cient," he said. 
The Common Application will also simplify the admis­sions process for students who can use the same form for the majority of their applications, he said. 
"Virtually all of the schools that our students also apply to are members of the Common Application," he said. "We know the schools our students also apply to. If a student applies to Northwestern, or Stanford, let them for convenience sake, be able to apply to Notre Dame the same way." 
Northwestern and Stanford, along with the University of Chicago, are among a num­ber of schools that recently joined the Common Application, Saracino said. 
"Joining just seemed like the right thing to do," he said. 
Notre Dame's Common Application will have a sup­plemental application, which

Wabruda events honor black history 

Weekend conference features guest speakers, trip to Underground Railroad landmarks 
black men on campus. 
Two-year Wabruda presi­dent, senior William David Williams, said he envisioned the Conference a year ago but began planning the event in December. 
The Conference was designed to address black history and its effects on American society today, Williams said. 
"I think that we commit cultural genocide by ignoring these issues," Williams said. 
Presentations given by three speakers Saturday attracted about 100 students, faculty, staff and community members, he said.

The Shirt to fund scholars 

Proposal to remember seven ND students 
By JOSEPH McMAHON Assistant News Editor 
The Financial Management Board is moving to create seven new scholarships in memory of students who died while attending Notre Dame, Student Union Board treasurer Kedeja Gaines said. 
If the initiative succeeds, funds from The Shirt Charity Fund will be used to create scholarships with a $25,000 endowment, Gaines said. 
The Fund will reach $1 million for the first time this year, she said. 
Gaines said she hopes to estab­lish the scholarships before the end of the academic year. 
Students who would be memo­rialized include Timothy Aher and Connor McGrath, both of whom died in unrelated incidents Feb. 17, Ryan Rudd who died in 2007, Caitlin Brann who died in 2006, Daniel Kish who died in 2005 and Chad Sharon, who went missing in December 2002 and was found dead in February 2003. 
"The scholarships would serve as a great way to not only benefit the Notre Dame community in the name of the deceased student in question, but also a way to forever inunortalize each student and the impact they have had on our com­munity," she said. 
This is not the first time money from The Fund was used to create an endowed scholarship memori­alizing a student.

This weekend's inaugural Black History Conference underscored the importance of remembering and cele­brating black history through cultural immersion in a series of lectures on campus and a vitsit to Underground Railroad landmarks in south­ern Michigan. 
The conference was spon­sored by the Notre Dame stu­dent group Wabruda in honor of Black History Month. Wabruda, a group whose name means "brother" in Swahili, promotes brother­hood and leadership among

INSIDE COLUMN 


Ca1npaign strategies 
Every student by now has noticed 
the plethora of' campaign posters 
canvassing the walls of' their dorms, 
classroom buildings, and dining 
halls. 
Everywhere 

Joseph McMahon 
we go, W!~'ve 
been remind­

ed to vote for Assistant News 
some generic Editor 
ticket for 
class council 

in yesterday's election. 
Most of the posters are exactly the 
same. They feature the four candi­
dates in formal attire smiling, arms 
crossed and standing in front of 
some school landmark like the 
Dome or that giant granite ball in 
CoMo. 

As someone who has seen both his 
parents run for election four times 
in the past eight years, I know how 
important it is to make yourself 
stand out to the voters. 
Distinguishing yourself from the 
other candidates is one of the most 
important things you can do, and 
one of the best ways to do this is 
through effective, unique advertis­
ing. 

The trend of smiling faces in front 
of some Notrn Dame landmark has 
to stop. If you want to win, you have 
to do something that really reaches 
out to voters and makes them want 
to vote for you. 

One of the major reasons Bob 
Heish and Grant Schmidt were so 
successful in their campaign for stu­
dent body president and vice presi­
dent was because of their Web site, 
bobandgrant.com. This was easy for 
students to remember, and Heish 
and Schmidt won their election by 
more than 1,000 votes. 
However, most tickets for both 
junior and sophomore class councils 
have failed to learn from this exam­
ple. There is one-the sophomore 
class council ticket of Zach Reuvers, 
Steven Ouyang, Melissa Truitt and 
Nicole Navas. 

Through their Bob and Grant 
inspired Web site, 

zachandsteve.com, Reuvers and 
Ouyang have separated themselves 
from rest of the generic tickets. 
However, it is their poster that 
really helps set them apart. Inspired 
by the Will Ferrell movie 
"Anchorman," the four candidates 
are set in front of a red background 
that features the words "News Team 
11." 

Ouyang, set to the far left, is 
wearing a cowboy hat while waving 
at the voters. Reuvers is in the cen­
ter, flanked by Truitt and Navas and 
although he does have his arms 
crossed, his face conveys the joking­
seriousness that Ferrell is best 
known for. 

Steve Carell's character from the 
movie, Brick Tamland, is also fea­
tured standing in the right corner. 
It is this type of poster that will 
really stick in students' minds and 
influence their voting. Besides, hav­
ing Steve Carel! in your poster is 
way cooler than that granite mon­
strosity in CoMo.

German pollee dogs to wear shoes 
BERLIN -Police dogs in the western city of Duesseldorf will no longer get their feet dirty when on patrol -the entire dog unit will soon be equipped with blue plastic fiber shoes, a police spokesman said Monday. 
"All 20 of our police dogs -German and Belgian shepherds -are currently being trained to walk in these shoes," Andre Hartwich said. ''I'm not sure they like it, but they'll have to get used to it." 
The unusual footwear is not a fashion statement, Hartwich said, but rather a necessity due to the high rate of paw injuries on duty. Especially in the city's historical old town ­famous fo·r both its pubs and drunken revelers ­the dogs often step into broken beer bottles. 
School bus driver claims to be a cop 
ECONOMY, Pa. -A school bus driver in Beaver County said he told stu­dents he was an undercov­er officer so they wouldn't misbehave on the bus. They didn't. 

But the real police said what William Dunn, 59, did was wrong and have charged him with imper­sonating a public servant. Police said Dunn flashed a badge and identified him­self as an undercover offi­cer to at least three peo­ple on Feb. 5. 
Dunn said a fellow bus driver, who has asthma, had been harassed by stu­dents, and he was driving her route that day. 
Dunn said he didn't mean any harm.

In 2001, a memorial scholar­ship was created in honor of Connor Murphy, a junior who died ofleuknmia, Gaines said. 
The Pund's other function is to help students pay for medical expenses. 
Gaines said the Financial Management Board will not pro­ceed with individual scholarships before acquiring permission of the student's family. She has yet to approach the Aher and McGrath families, she said. 
''I'd really Hke to respect tl1e sit­uation of the families and give them a little bit of time to them­selves," she said. "Then I'd just like to let them know that this opportunity is out tllere to really honor their sons and keep them 
immortalized within the school." There are two main steps in creating the scholarship. _ 
First, a minimum of $25,000 must be depositnd for the estab­lishment of an endowed scholar­ship fund, Gainns said. The schol­arships will rely on the Financial Management Board, which is responsible for approving all activities of The Fund, for the ini­tial $25,000, she said. Later, other dorm and class council groups may contribute to renewing the scholarships. 
After the initial funds are allo­cated, representatives of The Fund will work with the student's family and friends in order to establish the criteria by which scholarship recipients would be selected. 
"Normally, these criteria would reflect some aspect of the memo­rialized student," she said.

N. Korea welcomes N.Y. Philharmonic 
PYONGYANG, North Korea -Swirling dancers and musicians beating traditional drums welcomed the New York Philharmonic to North Korea Monday for a historic cultural exchange between coun­tries that have been technically at war for more than a half-century. 
In a burst of musical diplomacy notably devoid of propaganda glorifying leader Kim Jong II or attacks on U.S. policy, North Korean dancers balanced water jars on their heads or twirled pink and green fans to entertain the celebrated American orchestra -which gave them a standing ovation. 
The Philharmonic is the first major American cultural group to visit the isolated communist nation and the largest-ever dele­gation from the U.S. to visit its longtime foe. 
Skull found in fonner children's home 
LONDON -Police used dogs to search for more bodies Monday at a former children's home on the British island of Jersey after a child's skull was found under a concrete slab there. 
The skull was found Saturday by a police dog in an investigation of the property, which was a home for orphaned and aban­doned children until 1986. Forensic experts have determined the remains are at least 20 years old and that of a child. · 
Officials said that without dental records and a full list of who went missing from the home it may be difficult to determine the child's identity.

NIU students struggle to retmn to nonnal 
DEKALB. Ill. -Students carried backpacks stuffed with books, headed in and out of class, grabbed something to eat and plopped down in the library just like always. 
But there was nothing normal about Northern Illinois University on Monday. Not with white crosses on a small knoll and television news trucks parked around campus. And not with crime scene tape strung in front of the auditori­um where 11 days earlier a gunman wordlessly pumped bullets and buckshot into a crowded class, ending the lives of five students before tak­ing his own. 
"You've got to move on," said Jonathan Brock, a 25-year-old studying industrial management, who was clearly not quite ready to do that as he looked for a spot to add his thoughts to message boards on which students have expressed their grief, faith and anger. 
Police shooting arouses suspicion 
NEW YORK-Three undercover police detectives who fired 50 shots at an unarmed man on his wed­ding day, killing him, were reckless and trigger happy, prosecutors argued Monday at the opening of the officers' trial. 
Sean Bell, 23, who had been at a bachelor party on the night before his wedding, was killed in a barrage of bullet<; out<;ide a Queens strip club in the early hours of Nov. 25. Two ofhis friends were wounded. 
The shooting sparked protest<; and debate over exrAJssive force and police conduct in New York City. 
Prosecutor Charles Testagrossa told the judge that once the evidence is heard, "It will be clear that what happened eannot be explained away as a mere acci­dent or mistake. It ean only be characterized as criminal."

Leftists find refuge in Venezuela 
Rebels fighting Columbia's U.S.-backed military receive weapons, food and medical treatment 
Associated Press 

EL CRUCE, Venezuela Leftist rebels fighting Colombia's U.S.-backed mili­tary have increasingly found refuge in Venezuela, where they get weapons, food, medical treatment and a smuggling route for the cocaine that keeps them afloat. 
Former rebels, local citi­zens and Colombian officials told The Associated Press that hundreds or even thou­sands of Colombian inswr­gents are in Venezuela at any given time. 
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who last month publicly recognized the rebels as "insurgent forces," denies directly sup­porting them. He blames Colombia for failing to poliee their 1,370-mile border. 
But former rebels say the two main Colombian rebel groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and the National Liberation Army, or ELN, buy protection from high­ranking Venezuelan National Guard and army officers, with whom they often also share a leftist ide­ology. 
"Venezuela's army helps the guerrillas a lot," said Antonio, who spent 13 yeaJ~s with FARC. Now an inform­ant for Colombia's military, buying weapons and seeking United States and Europe, ipal hospital in Guasdualito, he asked that his last name refuge in Venezuela long according to U.S. and a town in Apure. be omitted to protect rela­before Chavez came to Colombian officials, who He said FARC paid for the tives from reprisals. power in 1999.

Association  of  African-

(AAAHM), spoke about the Underground Railroad. Gillam discussed black history during the era of the Civil War and the impaet of black migration northward. 
Saturday's final presentation featured Bishop Gideon Adjei, founder of Crystal Horizons Investment and father of Notre Dame junior Alvin Adjei. 
His lecture, called "Visions for Victory," focused on the number of different platforms on which people must focus in order not only to achieve equality in society, but also to better the world. 
Adjei began by introducing himself as the descendent of Ghanaian slave traders. He apologized to the black com­munity for his family's help in selling many blacks into slav­ery. He noted that his ances­tors were unaware of the inhumane treatment that they were to receive upon arrival in the Americas. 
"On behalf of the South Bend and Notre Dame communities, I accepted his apology," G. David Moss, assistant vice president with the Office of Student Affairs and advisor for Wabruda, said. 
Moss said Adjei's public apology was one of the most profound aspects of the Conference for him. 
"We can now look past this since we have reconciled and look at what we can do to move on," Moss said. 
Adjei discussed a number of different areas, or "visions," on which to focus, from regaining spirituality to strengthening family relation­ships to taking care of educa­tion, which he said is "the key to success." 
Adjei said there is a need for universal betterment of socie­ty, regardless of race, age or socioeconomic status. 
"These visions for victory can be applied to anyone," Adjei said. 
Saturday's events closed with a performance by spoken word artist Taalam Acey at Legends, where the Conference saw its highest attendance with more than 100 audience members, Williams said. 
Sunday's activities took par­ticipants out of the classroom with an excursion into south­ern Michigan to view a num­ber of important Underground Hailroad sites, including a visit to the Underground Hailroad Cemetery in Vandalia, Mich., a family farm in Paw Paw, Mich., and the Sojourner Truth 
statue in Battle Creek, Mich. 
Williams and Moss both said they were pleased with Sunday's turnout, particu­larly with the numbers of South Bend community members. 
"It was a successful way

IRAQ 


Civilians fear Turkish troops 
Associated Press 
AMADIYA -Turkey says it is not targeting civilians as it chases after separatist rebels in northern Iraq, but people in Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region say they have lived in fear since the incur­sion began. 
Some residents of this area 18 miles from the Iraq-Turkey border thought they'd escaped to a safe haven, having aban­doned homes closer to the bor­der to avoid skirmishes between the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, and Turkish troops. 
But with the Turks mounting their first confirmed ground operation in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, some say they are fearful of getting caught in the deadly crossfire. 
Already, the Turkish military says it has killed 153 rebels since fighting began last Thursday. Turks fired barrage after barrage of artillery shells at rebels Monday, and its mili­tary said it had hit some 30 targets in the last 24 hours. The Turks have put their own death toll at 17; a funeral service for three troops was held Monday. 
"Whenever the children hear the military operations, they feel frightened," said school headmaster Aoni Mashaghti. "Most of the women came to school to take their kids out. Whenever they hear any sound of bombardment, the school becomes empty." 
Hawzan Hussein, who lives in a community of about 160 families, said people are wor­ried because some of the Turkish targets are so close to their homes. 
The explosions "have become a daily scene that frightened me with the possi­bility of hitting our house any time," the 25-year-old said. 
Associated Press Television News footage from the border area showed Turkish tanks dug into barren hillsides, with armored vehicles taking posi­tions in towns. 
The PKK wants autonomy for the predominantly Kurdish southeastern Turkey, and rebels have carried out attacks in Turkey from bases in Kurdish Iraq. The conflict started in 1984 and has killed up to 40,000 people. 
Turkey has assured Iraq and the U.S. military that the oper­ation would be limited to attacks on rebels. The U.S. and European Union consider the PKK a terrorist group. 
Lt. Gen. Carter Ham, direc­tor of operations for the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at the Pentagon on Monday that the United States has no indications that the Turks are straying from their original assurance to Washington that their incur­sion would be "limited in depth and in duration."

IN BRIEF 
Getty Images to sell for $2.1 billion 
SEATILE-Getty Images Inc., the leading sell­er of stock photography and video footage, said Monday it has agreed to a $2.1 billion buyout from the private equity group Hellman & Friedman LLC. 
Ten-year-old Getty, whose nearest competitor is privately held Corbis Corp., put itself up for sale in January after taking a beating on Wall Street for two years. 
After reaching a high above $94 per share in November 2005, Getty's shares tumbled 77 per­cent to $21.80 in Jan. 18 of this year, as higher costs ate away at profits. Four days later, the Seattle-based company said it would consider strategic alternatives to boost shareholder value. 
Troy Mastin, an analyst at William Blair & Co., said Getty's core business of selling more-expen­sive photographs to newspapers and magazines had declined as those media struggled with the rise of Internet content. Sales to direct mail and brochure customers also cooled. 
VISa IPO could raise nearly $19 billion 
NEW YORK -Stocks are shaky, credit is tight, the economy may be tipping into a recession. Not the best of times to be going to the markets for what could be the largest initial public offering in 
U.S. history. 
That's the gamble Visa is taking as it gave details Monday about an IPO that could raise up to nearly $19 billion: If it works, it could be an encouraging sign to the stock markets and may even help loosen the credit knot. 
While Visa's !PO will have little direct effect on its cardholders, the banks that issue Visa cards are expected to see a total windfall of more than $10 billion-which might keep them from pulling back credit lines further and pushing rates higher. 
'That's a good thing f(Jr the banks, and a good thing for consumers. It might help ease the credit crisis a bit," said Ben Woolsey, marketing director at the card in!iJrmation Web site CreditCards.com. 
Banks have summ~d huge losses tied to defaults on subprime housing loans and are gearing up lor more as consumer crndit deteriorates. JPMorgan Chase & Co. -which has a 23 percent stake in Visa -stands to gain the most. The more cash­strapped Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. are also Visa stockholders. 
Inteme~t networks fight for rights 
Questions raised about owners interfering with traffic flow on the Web 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Internet users should be free to surf where they want and down­load what they please. But shouldn't the owners of the networks that make the Internet possible also have rights? 
That, in a nutshell, is the topic of debate at a special public meeting of the Federal Communications Commission at Harvard Law School on Monday. 
Recent events involving Comcast Corp. and Verizon Wireless have raised ques­tions about network owners interfering with customer traffic flow. The meeting also is expected tQ attraet a rally on minority media owner­ship. 
The session is the agency's most serious public discus­sion to date of the principle of "network neutrality." That is the idea that all Internet traf­fic should be treated equally.

Minister regains control of Muslitn tnovetnent 
Farrakhan recovers to lead Nation ofIslam again 
Associated Press 
CIIICAGO -A year after delivering what the Nation of Islam deemed its ailing leader's final public address, Minister Louis Farrakhan has regained control of the move­ment and his place in its spot­light, a top aide said. 
Months before delivering the 2007 Saviours' Day speech in Detroit, Farrakhan had passed daily leadership of the Chicago-based religion to an executive board as he recuperated from serious complications from prostate cancer. 
Some experts were quick to predict an inevitable fractur­ing of Nation of Islam leader­ship without Farrakhan, the organization's best-known leader and charismatic speak­er. 
But on Sunday, a healthy­looking Farrakhan returned for another Saviours' Day, delivering a two-hour speech in which the 74-year-old expressed his hopes for the presidential election and out­lined his view of the Nation's future tone. 
Ministnr Ishman! Muhammad, top assisting minister at the organization's Mosque Maryam on the city's South Side and who is widely believed to be Farrakhan's successor, told The Associated Press that Farrakhan has qui­etly reassumed full responsi­bility for the Nation during the past year. 
In fact, Farrakl;lan passed daily leadership duties to an executive board for only a few months before taking back the organization's reins, Muhammad said. 
"God has spared his life and kept him here," Muhammad said. "He has work to do and complete." 
In May, Farrakhan delivered a message of unity at St. Sabina Catholic Church on Chicago's South Side. In October, he addressed a crowd of about 5,000 in a commemoration of the 12th anniversary of the Million Man March. He has since pro­duced a series of lectures for youth with titles like "Black Youth in Peril." 
On Sunday, Farrakhan spoke for two hours to an estimated 20,000 people dur­ing his first major address in a year, pausing only to wipe sweat from his forehead. 
lie told followers his weight was up to a robust 192 pounds -up from a low of 158 pounds in late 2006 ­and suggested that he may be ready to assume a more pub­lic profile.

Docu111ents Ina y reveal Iranian nuclear plans 
Tehran may have developed arms after 2003 
Associated Press 

VIENNA, Austria -The U.N. nuclear monitoring agency present­ed documents Monday that diplo­mats said indicate Iran mav have focused on a nudear weapo~s pro­gram after 2003 -the year that a 
U.S. intelligence report says such work stopped. 
Iran again drmied ever trying to make such arms. Ali Ashgar Soltanieh, the chief Iranian dele­gate to the international Atomic Energy Agency, dismissed the infor­mation showcased by the body as "forgeries." 
He and other diplomats, all linked to the IAEA, commented after a closed-door presentation to the agency's 35-nation board of intelli­gence findings from the U.S. and its allies and other information pur­porting to show Iranian attempts to make nuclear arms. 
A summarized U.S. National Intelligence Estimatp,, made pub­lic late last year, also came to the conclusion that Tehran was eon­ducting atomic weapons work. But it said tlw Iranians frozn such work in 200:~. 
Asked whctlwr board mem­bers were shown information indicating Tehran continued weapons-related activities after that time, Simon Smith. the chin!' British delegatn to the IAEA, said: "Certainly some bf'the dates ... went beyond 2003." 
He did not elaborate. But another diplomat at the presen­tation, who agreed to discuss the meeting only if not quoted by name, said some of the docu­mentation focused on an Iranian report on nuclear activities that some experts have said could be related to weapons. 
She said it was unclear whether the project was being actively worked on in 2004 or the report was a review of past activities. Still, any Iranian focus on nuclear weapons work in 2004 would at least indicate con­tinued interest past the time­frame outlined in the U.S. intelli­gence estimate. 
A senior diplomat who attend­ed the IAEA meeting said that among the material shown was an Iranian video depicting mock­ups of a missile re-entry vehicle. He said·IAEA Director General Oli Heinonen suggested the com­ponent -which brings missiles back from the stratosphere ­was configured in a way that strongly suggests it was meant to carry a nuclear warhead. 
Other documentation showed the Iranians experimenting with warheads and missile trajecto­ries where "the height of the burst ... didn't make sense for conventional warheads," he said. 
Smith and the senior diplomat both said the material shown to the board came from a variety of sources, including information gathered by the agency and intelligence provided by member nations. 
"The assumption is this was not something that was being thought about or talked about, but the assumption is it was being practically worked on," Smith told reporters. 
He said the IAEA presented a "fairly detailed set of illustra­tions and descriptions of how you would build a nuclear war­head, how you would fit it into a delivery vehicle, how you would expect it to perform." 
The U.N. agency released a report last week saying that sus­picions about most past Iranian nuclear activities had eased or been laid to rest. But the report also noted Iran had rejected doc­uments linking it to missile and explosives experiments and other work connected to a possi­ble nuclear weapons program, calling the information false and irrelevant. 
The report called weaponiza­tion "the one major ... unsolved issue relevant to the nature of Iran's nuclear program." 
Most of the material shown to Iran by the IAEA on alleged attempts to make nuclear arms came from Washington, though some was provided by U.S. allies, diplomats told the AP. The agency shared it with Tehran only after the nations gave their permission.

TODAY'S STAFF 

The old double-standard-promiscu­ous males are studs, promiscuous females are sluts. A perennial source of outrage, bewilderment or rejoicing. 
It seems this double standard is rap­idly vanishing, and that chastity is almost as stigma­tized among younger women in particular as among men. But insofar as the dou­ble-standard still exists, it's usually challenged by women. Isn't that partly what "The Vagina Monologues" is about? I'll undnrstand if some of you think "only at Notre Dame ... " as I challenge it from the men's side. 
When I was little, a Bon Jovi song recalled being taken to a motel by some woman and being made by her into a man. There's probably few people on Earth with less knowledge of being or becoming a man than Jon Bon Jovi; it's common sense that one cannot give what one doesn't have, so the idea of a woman giving men their manhood is idiotic. But common sense wasn't my strength, and I was very interested in becoming a man, so the suggestion intrigued me. 
I soon learned what was meant by it, but it wouldn't have mattered if I had­n't. The idea that being a man meant being unchaste was thrown at me countless times as I grew up -by teammates, upperclassmen, bosses, popular culture, sometimes even older relatives-and I still encounter it. I'd say it's part of our society's cultural wallpaper. 
I find this attitude as bizarre as it is prevalent. Is it that sex itself makes one manlier? Our very instincts tell us no. There's a place in our psyche in which the Samson story rings true. It makes sense to us intuitively for athletes to 


abstain from sexual activity before competition, as is customary. We know 
what Dietrich von Hildebrand meant when describing the perfumed, suffo­cating atmosphere of sex. And don't we have an innate respect for asceticism'? Isn't their love of pleasure one reason we despise the French, and don't we suspect it's somehow connected with their lack of courage? 
Okay, maybe "success" with women isn't the cause of one's manliness so much as its effect? Again I'd say no. On the contrary -aren't the guys who get lots of girls usually just a bit promiscu­ous'? Maybe a lot promiscuous? 
Well, so what? Am I just that annoyed by guys boasting about fornicating, or even going to strip dubs, as if it were some kind of heroic accomplishment'! Yes, but that's not it. Having taught in Catholic schools, I've seen how hard it is to evangelize teenage boys. There's many reasons, including evangelizers like me. but one major obstade is their perception of the faith as effeminate. The liturgy's one problem. Catholic moral teaching is another. Now, it's ter­ribly wrong to reduce the faith to morality, or reduce Catholic morals to sexuality. But for many people, old and young alike, a salient feature of Catholicism is the Church's prohibitions about sex. 
We need to present the Church's teachings differently. Saint Thomas Aquinas taught that a measure of wrath is necessary to protect one's purity. How stirring, and utterly unlike how the call to chastity is usually offered! Priests and teachers of the faith should explain the pursuit of chastity as more like joining the Marines, less like join­ing the Peace Corps. 
There's aspects of the faith that can't be made attractive to men, like the commands to forgive enemies and turn the other cheek. Discipleship in Christ transcends the narrow category of mas­culinity. But there's lots about following Our Lord that requires us to bn as 
strong as we can. 
The affirmation of ehastity as a steep good must never d11gnneratn into a crabbed hyper-stoicism. Nor must it nurture pride and self-righteousness, spiritually deadlier than all depravity. Least of all should it make us deny the surpassing goodnnss of trun love of man for woman, the love that makes him want to lay down his lil'e for her. 
Popular reeognition of ehastity as a virtue in the true sense-an excel­lence, a perfection of man proper to his nature and an enhancement of his being-isn't going to happen. Outright physical cowardice will sooner be cele­brated. So we must rnach individual hearts. It's not enough to toll boys to bn chaste out of respoet for women's digni­ty, especially when so many of the women they see show no ovidenee whatsoever of any such dignity. At some point, cynical as this sounds, we, men. have to stop objoetifying women not because of who they are, but because of who we ourselves are. And this might sound even worse, but it's also true that a chaste man can't be controlled. 
In a previous artiele I implied that it takes manlier qualities to be altogether celibate than to bP profligate. Judging by my inbox, that struck a nerve. Whnn so many boys and young men are quite comfortable discussing even their pornography habits with eaeh other, as if those habits could possibly be any­thing other than profoundly shameful, it's natural that there's resistance to the idea of a pure heart being brave and strong. But this is a big topic, and here might be a good place for a small mind to drop it. 
Greg Yatarola is a 1999 alumnus. He hopes 'The Vagina Monologues" might encourage more men to consider celibacy as a life choice.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Acceptance, not tolerance 
Haeism is a reality that will never be completely extin­guished as long as differences among people exist in socie­ty. What we can strive for. however, is acceptance through understanding. Acceptance, not tolerance. For to merely "tolerate" someone di!Terent carries the implication that we agree to live side-by-side without strife because it is "the right thing to do." But we must look beyond what we have been taught in the classroom about the ideal of equality and examine what it truly means to achieve this ideal. 
Equality is not the slatus quo; it is an uncommon bal­anced state that is only achievable through combined effort and individual commilment. Each individual on this campus must care enough to question his or her subconscious prej­udices, and reach out to learn about others outside of his or her comfort zone in small, but significant, ways on a daily basis. Sadness and anger are humane and important reac­tions or those who have been exposed to the depth, history and continuing reality of racism. 
For instance. Irving Howe commended the novel "Native Son." because "Wright forced his readers to acknowledge his anger, and in that way, if none other, he wrested for himself a sense of dignity as a man. He forced his readers to confront the diseasH of our culture, and to one of its most terrifying symptoms he gave the name of Bigger Thomas." But anger is useless if it is not backed by the strength and conviction needed to accomplish change; and change does­n't always happen in loud movements. There is no reason to remain heartbroken, Cor as long as the students at Notre Dame really arc the good-hearted and willing people that I have had the fortune to encounter in the past few months, there is every reason to believe that we can come closer to the delicate balance of equality, and remain distinct and true to our backgrounds in the process.

Although the Academy Awards would not have taken place without the great films of the past year, the fashions on the Red Carpet drew a large number of viAw­ers before any statuettes were handed out. Whether audiences hoped to see ele­gant gowns or wanted to mock a fashion faux pas in real time, this year's pre­Oscars festivities did not disappoint. 
There were several standouts in the early evening festivi­ties: Cameron Diaz wore a pale pink Dior 
through the thigh, the gown featured a unique texture, with layers of black mate­rial that fell into larger ruffies at the bot­tom. 
Kelly Preston strolled by the paparazzi on John Travolta's arm in a gown featur­ing a recently popular silhouette. What set Preston's look apart was the fresh and interesting marigold shade by Hoberto Cavalli. Pregnant beauties Jessica Alba and Cate Blanchett glowed in richly col­ored gowns by Marchesa and Dries van Noten, respectively. 
True to its name, the Hed Carpet fea­tured several dresses of the same color. Teen pop sensation Miley Cyrus wore an elegant, age-appropriate Valentino gown. Reminiscent of Old Hollywood glamour, Katherine Heigl showed off a vintage­inspired Escada gown, with an equally fit­ting hairstyle. The always classy Helen Mirren touted a deeply colored Georges Chakra gown with stunning Swarovski crystal sleeves. 
Also in crimson, Heidi Klum's bold John Galliano gown was auctioned off after the big night to benefit The Heart Truth, an organization founded by the National Institute of Health to promote awareness

of women and heart disease throughout the country. The red dress is the national symbol of worn en and heart disease awareness, and Klum began her help pro­moting the cause when she wore a red Marc Jacobs creation on National Wear Hed Day at the recent Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. 
The most debate-inspiring gown on the Red Carpet was certainly French actress Marion Cotillard's mermaid-esque gown by Jean Paul Gaultier. However, even skeptics of the design could not deny Cotillard's beauty when she stepped for­ward to accept her Oscar for Leading Actress for t,er role in "La Vie en

Further confm.ing the evening's audi­ence were the simple shoes that Diablo Cody showed off to photographers. Cody was scheduled tc· wear a pair of million­dollar metallic T·strap heels designed by Stuart Weitzman that featured roses of Kwiat diamonds. In the days leading up to the ceremony, the writer of Indie film "Juno" had made known her disappoint­ment at being used as a stunt to publicize the shoes. 
Despite the few exceptions, the ladies of Hollywood cleaned up nicely for the indus­try's most important night. I lowever, even those gowns that impressed viewers the most still lacked a certain something that memorable gowns in recent years had brought to the table. Loyal Hed Carpet fans will certainly be waiting for more noteworthy looks, from both the best and worst dressed, at next year's event.

"Jackhammer of Truth" 
Zehrbach 
Whalen, a freshman, took advantage of his height early, knoeking the senior Zehrbach down twice in the first round. The second round saw eontin­ued dominance from Whalen, as Zehrbach was forced to defend most of the round. Whalen continued to control the paee until the end, earning a unanimous vktory. 
Bryan Grissinger def. 
David Cray 
Grissinger dietated the tempo of the bout by displaying a loose, confident swagger. Cray didn't baek down, though, doing most of his damage in the second half of each round. (irissinger finally took a decid­ed advantage by bloodying Cray's nose early in the third and then putting the fight away following a brief stoppage. 
Charlie Gough def. Rob Gallic 
Gough literally blew Gallic out of the ring in this fight, knocking him down and through the ropes early in the seeond round. Gallic landed several punehes early in the first, but once Gough gained an advantage, he didn't relinquish it as the fight ended early by TKO. 
Nazur Ahmed def. John Tierney 
The eontrasl in styles was immediately evidnnt, as Tierney stood straight up and looked for headshots while Ahmed's stratngy was to stay lownr than his taller opponent. The latter approach prevailed, and Ahmed dominatnd the final two rounds en route to vietory by unanimous deeision. 
170-pound division 
Mike Doran def. John Soltis 
Doran displayed perhaps morn emotion than any other fighter on tlw night, jumping out of his eorner before every round, engaging the erowd and othnrwise giving ofT an air of confidence unmatched during tlw preliminary rounds. In a split decision that truly went down to the wire -an advan­tage wasn't clearly established until the final round, when Doran laid into the junior Soltis against the ropes before Soltis could only hold on for dear life -Doran, a freshman was able to advance. 

Drew Whiting def. 
Brendan Collins 
The sophomore Collins used a distinet height advantage to take an early lead, out-punch­ing Whiting, a senior, nearly three to one throughout the first round. Whiting, his face covered in blood, wouldn't let his smaller stature hold him back, unloading several hooks that eventually gave him the momentum he needed to win by split decision. The fight appeared to be a deadlock after two rounds, but Whiting out­lasted Collins, forcing him into the corner repeatedly in the final minute and winning the third round decisively because of his ability to land a series of jab-hook combos. 
Christopher Jordan def. 
Charles Cossell 
The senior Jordan's experi­ence proved too much for Cossell, a sophomore, who was knocked down near the end of the first round. The officials stopped the fight after one round. 
Eric Jones def. Matt Paletta 
Jones, a junior, knocked down Palletta, a sophomore, who appeared to tweak some­thing in his lower body. The officials were forced the stop the fight early in the first round. 
Ben O'Brien def. Andrew Renz 
O'Brien defeated Henz by unanimous decision to advance to the quarterfinals. Renz came out aggressively in each round, but 0' Brien maintained his eomposure and leveled several series of jabs against his oppo­nent. Renz got in some good body shots, but ended the fight bloodied and beaten. 
Mike Cimino def. Scott Jarvie 
Cimino, a senior, held off a late charge to beat freshman Jarvie by a split decision. 
Jarvie eame out with fists fly­ing, getting in strong jabs in the first round, but Cimino blocked well and countered with some good series of his own. Both fighters tired late in the fight, and Jarvie got Cimino against the ropes late in the third round. Unfortunately for Jarvie, though, the comeback was too little, too late. 
Matt Gimlett def. 
Vincent Keneally 
Gimlett easily defeated 
Keneally by a unanimous deci­
sion. 
The fight started off with a 
quick pace, and Keneally 
appeared to tire late. By the 
end of second round, Gimlett 
was chasing Keneally around 
the ring, landing punch after 
punch to wear down his oppo­
nent. 
Bernardo Garcia def. 
Patrick Martin 
Garcia, a freshman, won over Martin, a junior, by unanimous decision. Martin had trouble protecting himself throughout the fight, and Garcia took advantage. Martin was able to land a few good series on the freshman, but a solid consistent jab allowed Garcia to advance to the quarterfinals with rela­tive ease. 
176-pound division 
Mike Lee def. James Hassan 
The fight went down to the wire, but Lee landed a good combination of body shots and jabs in the final round to take the fight. Both fighters adapted a somewhat defensive style early on, with each getting in a few good, calculated shots. Lee took control in the final round, though, and advanced to the next round by unanimous deci­sion. 
Pat Jackson def. Jonathan Parry 
Pat Jackson didn't tire and managed to beat junior Jonathan Parry by unanimous decision. The fight was close for all three rounds, but Jaekson was able to get in more consistent punches throughout the match. He put the nail in Parry's coffin in the third round, when he backed the junior against the ropes and landed a flurry of jabs and body shots. 
Dominic Golab def. Richard Paulius 
In a fight that was fast-paced from start to finish, Golab defeatnd Paulius by unanimous decision. Both fighters came out flying, and neither seemed to tire as the bout wore on. The intensity ramped up at the end of the second round when both fighters continued to throw punches after the bell sounded. Golab proceeded to take control in the final round, landing several shots to his opponent's head and leaving him bloodied. 

Mike Delach def. 
Ken Shamrell 

Delach, a freshman, outlast­ed a tough contest from Shamrell to win by unanimous decision. Both fighters did a lot more punching than defending and with the fight close all the way through, both came out swinging in the third round. Delach was able to land a series of solid body shots and advanced to the quarterfinals. 
Josh Von Schaumburg def. 
Daniel Glees 

Glees came out more aggres­sive than Von Schaumburg, who may have focused on blocking Glees' attack instead of mounting his own in the first round. After getting knocked down in the first, Von Schaumburg turned the tide in the second, connecting on sev­eral jabs to the body and hooks to the face that knocked down Glees, a junior, in the second. It was more of the same in the third, as Von Schaumburg dominated the last two rounds en route to a victory by unani­mous decision. 
Matthew Belton def. 
Gavin Payne 

Payne, a junior, dominated the first half of the opening round, immediately backing Belton into the corner and keeping him there long enough to land near a dozen solid jabs. Once Belton got out, though, it was a different story as he mixed in a few uppercuts to go along with an impressive arse­nal of hooks and jabs. The start of the third looked much like the fight's beginning, with Payne able to get Belton in the corner once again. But once again, the senior Belton escaped and regained control, winning the fight by unani­mous decision. 
Jordan Smith def. Pat Allare 
Smith was able to corner Allare several times, giving him plenty of opportunities to rack up the punches and points that gave him the victory by a unanimous decision. Allare mounted a substantial come­back in the final round by landing three or four upper­cuts, but Smith's recovery ensured him the win. 
Andres Villalba def. 
Barry Clark 
Like many of the night's suc­cessful fighters, Villalba estab­lished himself by immediately controlling the tempo and put­ting his opponent on the defen­sive. Clark had to focus on blocking Villalba's repertoire of hooks and jabs -so much so that he could hardly fight back during Villalba's unanimous victory. 
189-pound division 
John Tchoula def. Bobby 
Hicks 
Tchoula dominated this fight from start to finish -which was ended midway through the first round. lie was simply too tall, strong, quiek and aggres­sive for Ilicks. 
Kevin Carrier def. 
Daniel McDonald 
Carrier charged at McDonald before the opening bell even finished ringing, immediately taking his opponent into the corner with a series of jabs before attempting several uppercuts. McDonald hardly had the opportunity to mount an attack of his own until the second round, but by then, Carrier had pulled too far ahead, guaranteeing him the unanimous decision. 
Andrew Mrugala def. 
Kyle Kownackl 
Despite being just a fresh­man, Mrugala came out show­ing no hesitation -the opening bell had to be re-sounded because he came out of the gate so quickly. A knockdown in the second round and a bevy of body shots in the third ensured Mrugala the unanimous victory over the senior Kownacki. 
Xavier Burton def. Matthew Gray 
Both fighters kept up the intensity for all three rounds, but Burton outlasted Gray, landing a consistent series of jabs in the first two rounds. Gray attempted to storm back in the third, but Burton fended off the attaek, and effeetively countered with his own flurry of punches. Burton won by unanimous decision.

Associated Press 
FONTANA, Calif. -For Carl Edwards, it's a signal. At least one NASCAR Sprint Cup team is ready to take on Hendrick Motorsports. 
Edwards won the rain­delayed Auto Club 500 on Monday, finishing ahead of Jimmie Johnson and Jeff Gordon. In a race that resumed with the 88th of 250 laps, Edwards assumed the lead for good with 13 laps left. 
"I hope it's an indication we've caught up with them," Edwards said after the eighth victory of his career. "They still were sec­ond and third and they were the guys to beat today. I hope this is a sign we're up to their standards, to their level." 


Johnson took the green flag for the final restart in the lead with 26 laps left, but Edwards surged from third. He then showed fme form on his traditional vic­tory backflip after capturing the checkered flag in a race that ended under caution when Dale Jarrett spun on the final lap. 
Edwards had it all but wrapped up at that point, driving his Roush Fenway No. 99 Ford to a lead of more than four seconds over Johnson. It was his first victory at Fontana but his seventh top-1 0 fmish in eight starts at the track for­merly known as California Speedway. 
IN BRIEF 
Tennessee takes over No. I 
spot, Memphis falls to No. 2 
Tennessee surged to the top of The Associated Press college bas­ketball poll for the first time Monday on the strength of its victo­ry over Memphis in a Nos. 1-vs.-2 matchup. 
The football team at Tennessee has been ranked No. 1 during four seasons, including two national titles. The wome£Ls basketball pro­gram has been a regular atop that poll since 1977, winning seven national championships under coach Pat Summitt. 
Now it's the men's turn. 
The Volunteers (25-2) were a run­away choice, receiving 69 first­place votes and 1,797 points from the 72-member national media panel after a 66-62 victory at Memphis. Tennessee is the 53rd school to hold the No. 1 ranking since the poll began for the 1948­49 season. 

Gordon, who dominated Sunday's rain-interrupted racing, finished third. He was followed by Kyle Busch and Roush's Matt Kenseth, who had won the two previ­ous February races at this track. Another Roush driver, Greg Biffie, won this event in 2005. 
A year ago, Johnson and Gordon ended 1-2 in the season points. Johnson won his-second straight Cup title and the team rolled up 18 victories in 36 races. The Hendrick contingent also won nine of the 16 races in which NASCAR's new Car of Tomorrow was raced. 
The CoT is being used for the entire Sprint Cup sched­ule in 2008 and its debut on Auto Club Speedway's 2­
Tampa Bay to pursue Barry
Bonds 

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -The Tampa Bay Rays have had internal discussions about the prospect of pursuing Barry Bonds. 
Manager Joe Maddon said Monday he knew "little" about what was going on, but acknowledged some thought has been given to the career home-run leader. 
"A minor discussion was thrown out there a little bit, and it's really not gone any further than that," Maddon said after Monday's work­out at the team's spring training facility. "That's all it is right now." 
The St. Petersburg Times report­ed in Monday's editions that team officials have conferred among themselves about Bonds and other veteran unsigned free agents, such as Kenny Lofton and Mike Piazza. Andrew Friedman, Rays vice presi­dent of baseball operations, called the report a "non-story." 
page 15 
mile oval was a triumph for Edwards and Roush Fenway Racing. 
"I know that last year I would not have traded my car in for one of theirs at any of the CoT races towards the end of the year," Edwards said. "I thought we had the best car. Everyone knows, all the drivers know for sure, it's what you're sitting in a lot of the times that makes a tiny little difference and I'm proud to be driving this car." 
Team co-owner Jack Roush dragged his feet test­ing the bigger, boxier CoT a year ago. But Roush said that changed last May when he realized other teams were getting too far ahead. 

ForsberJ;! to finish season in 
ColoradO 
DENVER-The Avalanche and Peter Forsberg have agreed on a deal to bring the NHL's 2003 MVP back to Colorado through the end of the sea­son. 
Forsberg will earn about $1.1 mil­lion prorated from a one-year, $5 mil­lion deal, since there are about six weeks left in the regular season. 
Forsberg won two Stanley Cups in his nine seasons with the Avalanche and won the Hart Trophy in 2003 after scoring 29 goals and adding 77 assists. 
But foot and ankle injuries have plagued him in recent years. 
Until Monday's announcement, it appeared Forsberg wouldn't return to an NHL team this season. His agent, Don Baizley, informed teams last week that Forsberg didn't have enough confidence in the strength of his surgically repaired right foot to play.

DakicJh faces OSU in first home game 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS Dan Dakich passed his first test as Indiana's new coach Saturday night. 
On Tuesday, the former Hoosiers player and Bob Knight assistant will fulfill his lifelong dream -being intro­duced to the home fans as the Hoosiers' new coach. To Dakich, who laments the cir­cumstances surrounding Kelvin Sampson's resignation last week, it will be a bitter­sweet moment. 
''I'm obviously thrilled to be sitting here, I'm not thrilled at the circumstances and I hope that's obvious, too," Dakich said Monday night on his first weekly radio show. "But I do want to thank a ton of people who sent me e-mails, text messages, letters and phone calls. The messages they left were unbelievable to me and my family. It tells me the mag­nitude of Indiana basketball, regardless of how things go, and it's just been an incredible thing for me personally." 
For Dakich and the 12th­ranked Hoosiers (23-4, 12-2 Big Ten) it's been a tumultuous couple of weeks. 
Since the university released an NCAA report accusing Sampson of five major rules violations Feb. 13, basketball has taken a rare backseat to rumors, speculation, criticism and consternation. 
Many fans questioned whether Sampson should have even been hired at a school that prides itself on not having committed a major NCAA vio­lation since 1960. Some critics responded by booing Sampson during pregame introductions of the Hoosiers' last three home games even though the Hoosiers continued to chase their first outright Big Ten title since 1993. 
Sampson's resignation Friday and Dakich 's subse­quent promotion were fol­lowed by a threatened players' boycott that never material­ized Saturday at Northwestern. The result: An 85-82 victory that was more impressive in demonstrating the Hoosiers' resilience than their play. 
Still uncertain is how fans might react to the players, six of whom skipped Dakich's first practice Friday. Dakich has repeatedly downplayed the supposed rift, reflecting on the hypothetical situation of how he would have acted in a simi­lar predicament during his playing days. 
"You don't miss practice, ever. But this isn't ever. This is extraordinary circumstances," he said.

Nevv ac~quisitions give Angels depth for '08 
Associated Press 
TEMPE, Ariz. -The Los Angeles Angels have been one of baseball's better tnams over the past several yean. They've won the AL West three of the past four seasons -and gone home frustrated in October. 
"One of the things that I believe hurt us the last few years is depth. I think the real good teams have good, solid depth," said Arte Moreno, who bought the Angels in 2003, the year after they won their first -and only -World Series title. 
Last fall, about half of the lineup was slowed or sidelined by injuries when Los Angeles was swept by Boston in the AL division series. 
The way the Angel:> stack up this spring, depth shouldn't be a problem. There's a surplus of Angels in the outfield and start­ing rotation, with some other spots also deep in talent. 
"You have to win your divi­sion first. You have to win your division outright," Moreno said. "Then you have to build for a short series. llow do you match up? I'd like to think we're built for the playoffs." 
Los Angeles has four outfield­ers with outstanding credentials aftnr signing f'ree-ag,~nt center finlder Torii II unter in the off­season. Vladimir Guerrero is in right. Garret Anderson in left, and Gary Matthews Jr. is being shift11d from center to some­where. Manager Mike Scioscia intends to keep all four in the lineup, using some sort of rota­tion at DH. 
Two other outfielders, Juan Rivera and Reggie Willits, will have to fight for playing time. 
Rivera hit .310 with 23 homers and 85 RBis and had an AL-high 13 outfield assists in 2006 but missed most of last season recuperating from a broken left leg. He has been working some at first base this spring, with Scioscia thinking he may be able to add depth there. 
Willits, impressive during his rookie campaign last year despite being hampered by a gallbladder problem, batted ' .293 (430 at-bats) with 27 steals. 
The mound is almost as crowded as the outfield. 
With five starters seemingly set, the Angels added a sixth when they sent shortstop Orlando Cabrera to the Chicago White Sox for Jon Garland. His acquisition looks more signifi­cant now, since 18-game win­ncr Kelvim Escobar is sidelined with a sore shoulder and may miss part of the season. 
"A few years ago, if Kelvim Escobar went down, we'd have a problem," Moreno said, allud­ing to the added depth. 
Not only do they have an abundance of proven players, the Angels have a number of highly regarded prospects in the pipeline.

They will also auction an autographed NIU jersey and cap along with a White Sox bat and two other signed items on their Web site next month, with the proceeds going toward the scholarship fund. 
Western Michigan has been paying tribute, too, wearing NIU ribbons on its jerseys. And, of course, there will be tributes on Tuesday. 
This was already a difficult season for the Huskies (6-17, 3-8 Mid-American Conference), even though their most recent game was their best. Two days before the shootings, they beat Akron 88­78 and snapped the Zips' 22­game home winning streak. They were scheduled to host Western Michigan on Feb. 17, but NIU had closed down by then. 
When the team returned to practice on Wednesday, the elder Patton noticed "a level of focus and excitoment just got­ling back around one-anoth­

PGA TouR 

Tiger's hot start fuels thoughts of Grand Slam 
Associated Press 
MAHANA. Ariz. -The closest anyone came to a perfect season on the PGA Tour was Ben Hogan. 
He won every major champi­onship he played in 1953, and every official tournament he entered except for the Seminole Pro-Am Invitational, where he tied for second. Then again, !logan only played six times that year because of battered legs from a bus accident. 
Tiger Woods will play no more than 17 evenl<> on the PGA Tour this year, so a 2-0 start might be a little early for anyone to get exeited. 
Even so, expectations were as high as the desert sun at noon when Woods left Arizona with yet another victory. It was his fourth in a row on tour sincn early September, all done in meord fashion. 
lin set a 72-hole seoring meord at Cog llill outside Chicago and won by eight shots at the Tour Championship and the Buick Invitational. both record mar­gins. On Sunday. he smoked Stnwart Cink S and 7 in the Aecenture Match Play Championship, the biggest blowout in the finals in 10 years of a tournament that Woods eon­siders the toughest to win this side of a m<~jor. 

"I think this certainly is the best stretch I've every played," Woods said. 
Strong words -downright scary -considering that Woods won nine times, including three straight majors, in 2000 and that he won six consecutive PGA Tour events at the end of 2006, a streak that reached seven until losing in the Match Play the fol­lowing year. 
Woods, who also won in Dubai earlier this month, has never before started a season with three straight victories, and it is hard not to speculate how long he can keep winning given his history at some of the tourna­ments coming up. 
Next is the Arnold Palmer Invitational March 13-16 at Bay llill, where Woods won four straight times from 2000 to 2003. The week after that is the CA Championship at Dora!, wlwre he has won the last throe yoars. 
Then the Masters April 10-13. 
"lie just morphs his game into the courses," Cink said. "So I don't think there's a course that's going to present him with a real obstacle as far as him not being a favorite." 
Woods did little to squash the notion of a perfect season when someone asked him if winning them all was within reason.

Bush skips deposition in illegal gifts lawsuit 
Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO-Heggie Bush failed to show up for a sched­uled deposition on Monday, the latest twist in the civil lawsuit against the former Heisman Trophy winner who allegedly accepted cash and gifts from sports marketers during his sophomore and junior seasons at Southern California. 
"lie literally ran from his dep­osition." said Brian Watkins, the attornny for sports marketnr Lloyd Lake, who is suing Bush. 
Watkins said he received a fax from one of Bush's attorneys saying the New Orleans Saints' running back wouldn't bn corn­ing. 
Bush's attorney, David Cornwell, dndirwd to eornmnnt. 
"I have nothing to provide fi1r you," Cornwell said when readwd on his cell phone. 
Watkins requested that Bush bring extensive financial rncords, including thosn doeu­nwnting the purchase of a <~ar, as well as canceled rent chocks for thn suburban San Dingo honw whnrn his parents lived and for a condo in Los Angeles. 
Lake is seeking to recoup somn $291.000 in cash and gifts tlw star running back and his family allegedly acceptnd from Lakn and his former partner, Michael Michaels, while Bush was at USC. 
Lakn daims he gavn Bush eash to buy a car and that Michaels allowed Bush's parents to live rent-free in a San Diego-area horne. Lake and Michaels were trying to attract Bush as a dient for their marketing firm, New Era. 

Michaels settled with Bush in 2007. 
The latest development came 13 days after Lake and Watkins walked out of a deposition after a man accompanying Cornwell opened his jacket to expose a pistol. 
Watkins said Bush's lawyers are trying to keep transcripts of Bush's deposition from being given to the NCAA. 
"That's my intent. That's why you play," Woods said after col­lecting his 63rd career tour vic­tory and his 15th title in the World Golf Championships. "If you don't believe you can win an event, don't show up." 
But it also is his intent to make every putt and hit every shot just how he wants. No one does that, of course. No one wins every tournament. Byron Nelson holds the record with 11 straight victo­ries during a year in which he won 18 times in 30 events. That means he lost 12 times that year. 

A perfect season in golf? 
"I do find that laughable," Hal Sutton said Monday. "Anybody who knows golf knows that ain't going to happen. You can only own this game for a certain peri­od of time. Even if your name is Tiger Woods, you don't own it forever." 
Sutton was among those who beat Woods during a time when the world's No. 1 player looked unbeatable, going head-to-head with him at The Players Championship in 2000 and win­ning by one shot. 
He watched part of the cham­pionship match Sunday "until I got bored." 
'Tiger is defmitely more domi­nating," Sutton said. 
Curtis Strange is among those who played in the prime years of Woods and Jack Nicklaus, and he said it is pointless to compare generations.

Stretch 
continued from page 24 
beat No. 21 Syracuse in the 
Carrier Dome on Feb. 16 
and outlasted DePaul on 
Sunday with a two-point 
win. 
Notre Dame did slip up once on the road trip, a 57­51 loss at No. 4 Rutgers last Tuesda~ but that loss is to be expected in the Big East. 
Even though that loss did not sever Notre Dame's chances of a bye, it did expose an alarming trend for the Irish this season. Notre Dame has beaten infe­rior teams all season, but has struggled mightily against other ranked oppo­nents. Other than Rutgers, the Irish played three teams currently ranked in the top live, and were blown out in two of them -both at the Joyce Center. 
Notre Dame played No. 1 Connecticut on Jan. 27 and lost 81-64 and then lost to No. 3 Tennessee 87-63 on Jan. 5. The Irish also lost to No. 13 West Virginia in Morgantown 56-50. a remarkably close finish after the Irish managed only 11 first-half points. 
Currently, only Connecticut (13-1), Hutgers (12-1) and West Virginia (11-2) sit ahead of the Irish (9-4) in the conference standings. But what makes the final three games so crucial for Notre Dame is the logjam behind it. 
Syracuse, Louisville and Pittsburgh all sit one game back of the Irish at 8-5 and DePaul is 7-6, still within striking distance of the earn­ing the bye. 
One major factor in decid­ing the No. 4 seed in the Big East tournament is schedul­ing. The Irish haVf1 already faced their toughest confer­ence tests this season in the Huskies and Searlet Knights, and look to finish off the year against some of the dregs in the bottom of the standings. 
The Orange still have to host the Mountaineers before traveling to l'iseataway, N.J., on Saturday for a matchup with Hutgers, meaning they could eonceivably finish the season 1-2. Louisville and Pittsburgh each have easier roads to the tournament; each plays West Virginia and two other schools that are in the bottom half of the league standings. 

In its last three regular season games, Notre Dame will play host to South Florida (3-1 0) on Wednesday and Seton Hall (3-10) on Saturday before finishing with St. John's (4-9) on March 4. 
On paper, those games look like they should be easy wins, but McGraw fears these games the most head­ing into the stretch run. This is the last season in which only 12 of the 16 Big East teams make the conference tournament, leaving the bot­tom four to start their off­seasons a week earlier than they would like to. Currently, the Red Storm occupy the No. 12 spot, but the Bulls and Pirates are only a game out. This means that Notre Dame, with its postseason spot all but guaranteed, will be playing teams that are in must-win situations from here on out. 
McGraw is not the type of coach that will let her team slack off at the end of a sea­son, so she needs tell her team to stay focused and to make sure it wins these next three games. 
The worst thing that could happen for Notre Dame at this point is any kind of let­down. Last year, the Irish had a two-game home skid to end the regular season and then lost in the first round of the Big East tour­nament to DePaul. Even though the Irish still made the NCAA Tournament, they were a No. 8 seed and had to play No. 1 North Carolina in the second round -not the ideal situation for any team. 
The best way for Notre Dame to make sure that they are the bully picking ofT mid­dle-ranked teams in March is to finish with three solid wins that would impress the NCAA Selection Committee. 
The Irish have a knack for winning games they are sup­posed to. They just need to do it three more times.

Connecticut has a pretty easy road ahead of it. Its only away games are at Rutgers and Providence, and they finish the season with slumping Cincinnati. West Virginia may provide a test, but that game is at home.

The top 10 teams in the con­ference all feel comfortable about their prospective trips to Madison Square Garden (although if Syracuse falls apart, it could be left out). However, there is a logjam in slots 10-14 and only two of those teams can get to the con­ference tournament. 
If the season ended today, Seton Hall (6-8) and DePaul (5­

South Florida (2-12) and Rutgers (2-13) need monu­mental collapses by the teams in front of them to make the conference tournament and are just hoping to stay out of the Big East cellar.
