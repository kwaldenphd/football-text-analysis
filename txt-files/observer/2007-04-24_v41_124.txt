Flogging Molly to perform 
5UB uses extra funds to bring in big talent 
By JOHN-PAUL WITT 
News Writer 
Due to the financial succf)ss of last semester's Ben Folds concert, the Student Union Board (SUB) will bring Irish rock band Flogging Molly to Legends for a free concert Thursday, SUB manager Patrick Vassel said. 
"There was about $25,000 in revenue for SUB after the Ben Folds concert, and we decided to put on an end of year concert that's as exciting as possible," Vassel said. 
The Ben Folds concert ­which sold out -was held in Stepan Center. SUB decided to host Flogging Molly as a free concert in Legends because the cost of renting Stepan Center would have forced a concert either "with high tick­et prices or free, but with a !less famous] band," Vassel said. 
SUB has not always been able to bring well-known bands like Ben Folds or Flogging Molly to campus. Last year, several SUB-pro­duced concerts did not sell out, and this factored into the decision to forgo the expenses of renting Stepan Center for Flogging Molly, Vassel said. 
"Last year, we had two solid shows in Stepan [Center] ­but neither crowds filled to capacity," Vassel said, "Our goal this year was, however we do [the concerts], to make them as big and exciting as possible."

Live from DeBartolo Hall, "Saturday Night Live's" Kenan Thompson delighted students with anecdotes from his years as a child actor and a full­grown comedian Monday night as part of the Student Union Board's "SNL" lecture series. 
''I'm in my fourth year on 'SNL'. Chris Rock only did three," he said -and with that he drew the crowd's laughter in his first minute in the spot­light.

Physicsprof to transfer to Boston 
Barabasi chooses move to pursue nehwrkstudies 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Assisram News Ediror 
Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, the Emil T. Hofman professor of physics and the director of the Center for Complex Network Research, will leave 
Notre Dame in the fall to p u r s u e research and teaching opportunities a t Northeastern University 


and the Barabasi Dana Farber Cancer Institute, a teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School. 
Barabasi's decision to leave Notre Dame followed his experience last year as a vis­iting professor studying bio­logical networks at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Over the cours-e of his time in Boston, his investigation into networks led him to the study of human diseases. 
Barabasi stressed that his decision to take a new posi­tion was not because he was unhappy at Notre Dame. 
"To the contrary," he said in an e-mail sent to friends after deciding to leave the University. "I love this University and the whole Notre Dame community, and over the years I became an Irish fan as well."

'Building' founder describes education goals 
By BECKY HOGAN NewsWrirer 
The Millennium Development Goals Awareness Week is in full swing, working to educate the campus community on the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDG). 
To get the week's events started, Building Tomorrow founder George Srour spoke to students Monday about how they can get involved in making universal pri­mary education a reality. 
"One of the things we are focusing our efforts on is increasing the number of kids who have access to primary school [educa­
tion]." Srour said. 

Srour first became involved in the issue when he spearheaded an effort at the College of William and Mary to help build a school in Kampala, Uganda. Building Tomorrow is a non-profit o_rganization that works to get young people . involved in raising aware­ness and funds to build schools for children in Sub­Saharan Africa. 
Building Tomorrow ini­tially targeted college stu­dents, and it now has established chapters at 10 college campuses in the United States. The organi­zation has also partnered with Key -Club

does not afford 
these luxuries. 
Although I will be working full-time, I plan on taking advantage of my last opportunity to act like a kid. What better way to relive my childhood than with baseball of all kinds? Independent league, millor league, major league-my convenient northwest Indiana location offers it all. The biggest decision I need to make is which team I \\jll root for. 
One choice is the Gary Southshore Railcats. You may have noticed their field from the window of your South Shore train. Set in beautiful downtown Gary, the Railcats really have it all­giveaways every night, the rowdiest MC and the best live pizza race in town. Not to mention their father-son mascot team Rusty and Rascal. I can choose to watch the game from the stands or from the ever glorious party tub behind center field. Each seat is the perfect place to enjoy a hot dog and cheer on the two­time Northern League (that's independ­ent) Champs. 
Option two offers a similar family atmosphere and guaranteed fun, includ­ing a battle royal produce race where an enlarged broccoli challenges an ear of corn on foot. The South Bend Silverhawks may be the best kept secret in this area. A feeder for the Diamondbacks, the Hawks might not have the best record, but they do offer a great time. I've never been to a stadium where heckling the other team was quite as enjoyable. Because the stands are less than filled to capacity, to put it mild­ly, the players can hear every word you say. This is quite effective when yelling things like "ducks on the pond 2-4, knock 'em in" in support or "left, right, left, right" as the other team marches to the bench after striking out. This free­dom of baseball phraseology at its finest, coupled with dollar Mondays and thirsty Thursdays, will surely put the Hawks at the top of my list on many days. 
Of course, the wonderful Chicago White Sox, nestled on the South Side, never disappoint. Where else can you enjoy a sunset over the skyline of Chicago, Icees of all flavors and Tadahito Iguchi all in one place? To a real White Sox fan there is nothing more magical than watching the montage of amazing plays set to the score from Pirates. After the game has started, it is important to check the big screen from time to time so as not to miss the intermittent prom requests, proposals and birthdays in between the hat trick and pizza race. 
I realize I've neglected to comment on the shear greatness of the game itself, because that is a given. It is important for everyone to realize there is more to going to a game than the sport itself, and I encourage everyone to try it out at any level. I know this is a guaranteed great summer of baseball which will have to hold me over until I retire to follow the Sox cross-country.

Woman runs length of Long Island 
MELVILLE, N.Y. -It isn't called Long Island for nothing, and one long-dis­tance runner has learned that firsthand. Alicja Barahona ran the whole 120-mile length of the island over the weekend, in an effort to draw atten­tion to a breast cancer charity walk scheduled in June. 
She started around 6 
a.m. Saturday in Montauk, at the eastern end of the island. She finished about 11 a.m. Sunday in North Woodmere Park, on the western end of the island at the New York City bor­der. 
Barahona, who has com­peted in ultradistance run­ning events, did her Long Island run without sleep­ing or stopping, except for bathroom breaks. 
"I feel great," she said afterward. "No blisters, no cramps, no stiffness."

Flogging Molly has been in contact with SUB "for a few years" regarding a show at Notre Dame, Vassel said. SUB was unable to synch budgets and schedules with the band until now. 
Financially, SUB decided to "zero out" its accounts by put­ting on a show with no ticket sales, Vassel said, in part because of student govern­ment's newly formed endow­ment and the carry-forward account. 
Extra money left in the SUB budget is placed in either the carry-forward account for use during the next year or ­after that account reaches $100,000-in the student government endowment. 
"In the next couple years, the interest from the endow­ment should add about $20­30,000 a year," Vassel said. "That will support student organizations ·on campus. Once that endowment gets over a million dollars, it will significantly start returning money that will help the Student Union." 
With the expanded budget, 
Vassel forecasted more pro­gramming options for student government, especially in terms of "major program­ming", such as concerts with big-name performers. 
"When you have a consistent source of funding from an endowment like that -that'll be a difference maker," Vassel said. "[Student government] can use this endowment to ensure that financial concerns won't be a liability." 
Vassel is part of a team pre­senting information about the endowment to the University Board of Trustees later this semester. The report will con­tain details of the present and 
future plans for the endow­ment. 
"This is interesting because five years ago, the student body president basically asked the Board for a million dollars for an endowment but was told it wasn't feasible," Vassel said. "But now we can go to the Board and say, 'We found the money on our own'." 
For the Flogging Molly con­cert Thursday, Legends has attempted to expand the amount of people that cail watch the concert in the 680­person venue by simulcasting the show on large-screen TVs in the field behind Legends, so a total of 1 ,200 people will be able to watch the concert, Legends general manager Rich Jacobs said. 
Jacobs advised students to arrive early for the concert, but said the club will not per­mit students to start standing in line while classes are in session. 
Attendance at the Flogging Molly concert is limited to stu­dents with a Notre Dame, Saint Mary's or Holy Cross College ID, and students are allowed two guests each, Jacobs said. The concert starts at 10 p.m.

Barabasi was out of town and could not be reached for comment, but he forwarded to The Observer the e-mail he sent to his friends when he decided to leave the University. 
He said he felt he needed to make the move to advance forward with his scholarship, since his interests have evolved toward medical research. 

"At the end it was not a vote for or against the University, nor a question of resources -it was a decision based on location, and access to the collaboration possibili­ties that are necessary to take my research program to a new level, which," Barabasi said, "with the exponential growth of the field that we initiated now requires close interactions with experimen­tal groups, h.eavily based in medical schools."

"In a certain sense, it reflects well on Notre Dame that one of our faculty mem­bers is so well-recognized around the world," he said. 
Barab asi majored in physics and engineering at the University of Bucharest in Romania. He received his master's degree in physics from Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest and his Ph.D. from Boston University.

Nigerian election votes denounced 
ABUJA, Nigeria -A former chemistry pro­fessor and provincial governor hand-picked by President Olusegun Obasanjo won the presi­dential election in a landslide Monday, in a vote ·denounced as deeply flawed by interna­tional observers and the opposition. 
Umaru Yar'Adua must now fight for credibili­ty in Nigeria, where some 15,000 people have died since strict military rule ended in 1999. Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, the 1980s-era mili­tary leader who was the runner-up in Saturday's vote, called the outcome "the most blatantly rigged election results ever produced in Nigeria." 
During Saturday's presidential and parlia­mentary votes and a week earlier during elec­tions for state governors and legislatures, elec­toral oflicials could be seen inking ballots and shoving them into boxes. Thugs intimidated voters. The presidential ballots bore no serial numbers, making them easy to mishandle and impossible to track.

But he also said Israel would hit militants "until they are destroyed," following a week­end of fighting that left nine Palestinians dead.

Border patrol agent charged 
PHOENIX -A Border Patrol agent was charged Monday with first-degree murder in the shooting of an unarmed illegal immigrant at the border in January. 
An investigation found that Agent Nicholas Corbett's killing of Francisco Dominguez-Rivera, of Puebla, Mexico, was not legally justified, said Cochise County prosecutor Ed Rheinheimer. 
Corbett is also charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter and negligent homicide. A judge will determine which of the charges the evidence supports best, Rheinheimer said. 
"We have concluded that the evidence shows that at the time he was shot, Mr. Dominguez­Rivera presented no threat to agent Corbett," Rheinheimer said. His attorney, Daniel Santander, didn't immedi­ately return a message left Monday afternoon by The Associated Press. The Border Patrol said it would make a statement Tuesday. 
U.S. against European gas deal 
WASHINGTON -Irritated by the prospect of a huge European gas develop­ment deal with Iran, the Bush administra­tion said Monday it will argue that such transactions undercut international bar­gaining power over Iran's nuclear pro­gram. 
Also Monday, the State Department said it has again asked Iran for information about a missing former FBI agent. The United States says it has no information to substantiate reports that Iran may be detaining the man, but spokesmen do not rule out that possibility.

MOSCOW -Former President Boris Yeltsin, who hastened the collapse of the Soviet Union by scrambling atop a tank to rally opposi­tion against a hard-line coup and later pushed Russia to embrace democ­racy and a market econo­my, died Monday at age 76. 
The first freely elected leader of Russia, Yeltsin was initially admired abroad for his defiance of the monolithic Communist system. But many Russians will remember him mostly for presiding over the steep decline of their nation. 
Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet president, summed up Yeltsin's com­plex legacy Monday by referring to him as one "on whose shoulders are both great deeds for ~e country and serious errors." 
Defense Secretary Robert Gates called Yeltsin "an important figure in Russian history." 
"No Americans, at least, will forget seeing him standing on the tank out­side the White House (the Russian parliament build­ing) resisting the coup attempt," Gates said while visiting Moscow.

"I only get to see [Mitchell] every now and then, and he's well, but I don't know about Good Burger 2," Thompson said, referring to the movie the pair produced while their hit Nickelodeon show aired in the late 1990s. 
After graduating from Nickelodeon comedy, Thompson said he went on to star in a number of film proj­ects, including "Fat Albert" and "Barbershop 2" before landing a recurring role in NBC's variety show. 
Born in 1978, he became the first "SNL" cast member born after the series began in 1975, according to the show's Web site. 
While his experience in Nickelodeon's sketch series, "All That," and his work alongside comedian Ben Stiller in "Heavyweights" prepared Thompson to join "SNL", he said he was still nervous about auditioning and giving suggestions to his experienced co-stars during his first season on the show. 
"I don't consider myself an expert in comedy or any­thing, but you just have to feel comfortable pitching your ideas," he said. "Sometimes they work, and sometimes they don't." 
Thompson admitted he had never written a full comedy sketch until he joined "SNL" in 2003, but he said he was proud of the progress he has made as an actor and a writer from his time on the show. 

Pulitzer winner Halberstam dies 
Fonner New York Times writer killed in car crash en route to interoiew 
Associated Press 

SAN FRANCISCO -David Halberstam, a Pulitzer Prize­winning writer who chroni­cled the Vietnam War genera­tion, civil rights and the world of sports, was killed in a car crash Monday, his wife and local authorities said. He was 73. 
Halberstam, of New York, was a passenger in a car that was broadsided by another vehicle in Menlo Park, south of San Francisco, San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault said. The cause of death appeared to be internal injuries. he said. 
The accident occurred around 10:30 a.m., and Halberstam was declared dead at the scene, Menlo Park Fire Chief Harold Schapelhouman said. 
The driver of the car carry­ing Halberstam and the per­son driving the car that crashed into his were injured, but not seriously. 
Halberstam was being driv­en by a graduate journalism student from the University of California, Berkeley, which had hosted a speech by the author Saturday night about journalism and what it means to turn reporting into a work of history. They were headed to an interview he had sched­uled with Hall of Fame quar­terback Y.A. Tittle. 
Halberstam was working on a book, 'The Game,' about the 1958 NFL championship between the Baltimore Colts

And despite his established presence in the show and having shared the stage with actors like Tom Hanks, Samuel L. Jackson and Steve Martin, Thompson said humility and good manners go a long way in any setting -a lesson his mother taught him and reminded him of constantly. 
"There are other people out there who could be doing what I'm doing and maybe two times better, but none of that really matters if you're a prick," he said. "That atti­tude won't get you any­where."

and the New York Giants, often called the greatest game ever played, said his wife, Jean Halberstam. 
She said she would remem­ber him most for his "unend­ing, bottomless generosity to young journalists." 
"For someone who obvious­ly was so competitive with himself, the generosity with other writers was incredible," she said. 
In an interview earlier this month with The Associated Press, Halberstam recalled the zeal with which he and his colleagues covered Vietnam. 
"Maybe we were 28, 29, 26 and we had a great story, which we knew and we had a lock on the truth because we had such great sources. When for a variety of reasons -a flawed, deeply flawed policy -the government starts lying, that is when independent journalism really matters," he said. 
Such reporting, he said, is a key component of democracy. 
"The idea that somewhere before it is a big story that there is some young person ... putting themselves on the line morally, ethically, journalisti­cally, that is a great thing," Halberstam said. "I mean, that is what a free society is about." 
As word of Halberstam's death spread, tributes and remembrances poured in for the veteran reporter whose baritone matched the heft of his nonfiction narratives.

He immortalized knuckle pucks in "Mighty Ducks 2" and amused children in the 1990s as Pierre Escargot in "All That." And in the future, Thompson said he hopes to further solidify his career in Hollywood. 
"I like Eddie Murphy's life. That's a good life," he said. "He's been around for many years, and in that time he's made so many movies we will never forget. That's what every actor wants to accom­plish. Maybe somewhere down the line I could do something like that. Maybe I could be in Doctor Doolittle 1 7 some day."

"He was a dear friend," said author Gay Talese, who was at the Halberstams' home Monday night and was best man at his wedding. 
Halberstam was born April 10, 1934, in New York City to a surgeon father and teacher mother. His father was in the military, and Halberstam moved around the country during his childhood, spend­ing time in Texas, Minnesota and Connecticut. 
He attended Harvard University, where he was managing editor of the Harvard Crimson newspaper. 
He launched his career in 1955 at the Daily Times Leader in West Point, Miss. He spent only a year there because the editor at the time thought Halberstam was too liberal. said Bill Minor, the Jackson, Miss., bureau chief for The Times-Picayune of New Orleans. 
Minor remained friends for decades with Halberstam. who he said was not afraid to wear his social conscience on his sleeve. 
Halberstam went on to The Tennessean, in Nashville, where he covered the civil rights struggle, and then The New York Times, which sent him to Vietnam in 1962 to cover the growing crisis there. 
In 1964, when Halberstam was 30, he and Malcolm W. Browne, of the AP, won Pulitzers for their coverage of the war and the overthrow of the Saigon regime.

Another factor affeeting Uganda's inadequate educa­tion system is the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which runs ram­pant through the African con­tinent.

IN BRIEF 
Audit: federal workers abuse system 
WASHINGTON -Federal employees are going online to sell the mass transit fare cards the government buys them, congressional audi­tors say. 
Employees are also exaggerating their com­muting costs, and some continue to receive transportation subsidies after leaving the gov­ernment. 
Abuses in the mass transit benefits program for government workers are wasting tens of mil­lions of dollars each year, says Congress' Government Accountability Office 
Using seven agencies' mass transit records, investigators found at least $17 million in fraud­ulent transit benefits clain1ed in the Washington metropolitan area during 2006. That amount "could be millions more" if fraud exists in the dozens of agencies the GAO did not review, auditors say in testimony prepared for a Senate hearing Tuesday. 
In three days of online searches, the GAO found at least 20 federal employees who were fraudulently selling their fare cards on eBay. Posing as buyers, investigators purchased bene­fits from three employees on Craigslist. In other cases, employees claimed benefits while on leave, gave the cards to friends and family or used them for personal travel. 
Democrats ask for lending rules 
WASHINGTON -Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee asked Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bemanke on Monday to write new rules against predatory lending in the market for high-risk mortgages, which has been in distress in recent months. 
Bemanke told Congress last month that the cen­tral bank would "look very carefully" at its authority to define unfair and abusive lending practices under a 1994 law that the Democrats. led by committee Chairman Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut. invoked in their letter to 
him. 
He also said it was important to proceed care­fully and write any new rules precisely to avoid "killing the market" and choking off an important avenue for less wealthy people to become home­owners. 

Barclays PLC to stage takeover 
Company to acquire ABN Amro NVfor $91.16 billion, create global banking giant 
Associated Press 
AMSTERDAM -Barclays PLC said Monday it will acquire ABN Amro NV for 67 billion euros ($91.16 bil­lion) in the largest takeover in the fmancial services sec­tor, aiming to create a glob­al banking giant and pre­empt a rival bid to break up the Netherlands' largest bank. 
As part of the deal, ABN announced it is selling its 
U.S. unit LaSalle Bank to Bank of America Corp. for $21 billion in cash. 
The proposed chief execu­tive of the new group, Barclays CEO John Varley, called the deal "the largest merger ever in global finan­cial industry," and said it holds out the promise of growth at a rate twice as fast as global gross domestic product. 
Despite the agreement, ABN said it would welcome a meeting with representa-. tives from Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, Spain's Banco Santander Central Hispano SA and Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis NV, which invited 

· ABN to enter talks earlier this month. But the consortium called off the meeting at the last minute, and said it wanted to hear from ABN Amro by the end of the day under what conditions it would "ABN Amro considers When completed, "The proposed merger of consider scuttling the itself to have four home Barclay's acquisition of ABN ABN Amro and Barclays will planned sale of LaSalle. markets: Holland, the U.S., Amro would create one of create a strong and compet­

Natural law still applies 
How do we decide whether we are doing right or wrong? Jack Bauer and the "24" counterterrorism unit might say the test is utility, a point that might be disputed by their torturees. Others might ask whether the act makes you feel good. 
There is a better way. Through the nat­ural law, we can know the right and wrong of our own actions and we can set moral limits to the power of the state. 
Everything has a law of its nature, built into it by its maker. A rock will sink. And your Chevy will run if you put gasoline, but not sand, in the tank. When we talk about the natural law, we mean the law inscribed in the nature. of human beings by their Maker. The natural law is not a Christian invention. Aristotle and Cicero, the Roman statesman, aflirmed it. Saint Thomas Aquinas, however, provided the most comprehensive exposition of it. 
The natural law is a rule of reason by which man (of both sexes) can know how he should act in order to achieve his final end of eternal happiness with God. The "first and general principle" of that law, as Pope Benedict XVI recently put it, is "to do good and to avoid evil." The good is that which is in accord with the nature of the thing we are talking about. It is good to feed your Chevy gasoline. 
As for man, Aquinas said, "all those things to which man has a natural inclination are naturally apprehended by reason as being good." From those inclinations we reason to conclusions. From the inclination to preserve one­self, we reason that it is good to eat a balanced diet and not to gorge on Big Macs. We know that theft is wrong because it is inconsistent with the incli-nation to live in community. From the inclination to unite sexually and raise our offspring, we conclude that sex should bn reserved for marriage and marriage should bn permanent. And so on. We make these judgments through our conseience, a faculty of our intel­lect. "Moral truth is objective," said Pope John Paul 11, "and a properly formed conscienee qm perceive it." However, to declare that theft, etc., is objectively wrong is not to judge the subjeetivn culpability of the person who does it. To be morally culpable, one must know it is wrong and yet ehoose to do it. Wn generally have noitlwr the right nor the capaeity to judge the sub­jective eulpability of anyone. 


But whose natural law arc you going to apply? Supremn Court Justieo James Iredell, in 1798, rejeeted natural law because "the idoas of natural justice are regulated by no fixed standard: thA ablest and the purest men have dif­fered upon the subjeet." 
People may sineerely disagree, as they have on slavery, abortion, etc. But they can't both be right. "If ... we con­sider one action in the moral order," said Aquinas, "it is impossible for it to be both good and evil." 
Our intellects are weakened by origi­nal sin. But the Lawgiver of the natural law eame to the rescue of wounded human nature by giving us the Commandments, which are specifica­tions of that law, so we would have sure guidance. And Christ, who is God and the Lawgiver, founded one Church, headed by his Vicar who is the authori­tative interpreter of the natural law and the Commandments. The Magisterium, or teaching authority, of the Church is possessed by the Pope and the bishops in union with him. "Christians," said John Paul II, "have a great help for the formation of con­science in the Church and her Magisterium.... The Church puts her­self ... at the service of conscience ... helping it not to swerve from the truth about the good of man." 
Everyone has a pope, a visible authority on moral questions. If it is not the real Pope, it will be a pope of the individual's own choosing-whether Bill Clinton, Sean Hannity or the indi­vidual himself. It makes sense that we have one Pope rather than seven bil­lion, whieh would involve the natural law and its Lawgiver in a chaos of con­tradictions. 
The natural law is a standard for human law as well as for personal con­duct. Martin Luther King echoed Aquinas when he said that "an ur\iust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law." As Aquinas put it, if a human law "deflects from the law of nature," it is unjust and "is no longer a law but a perversion of law." llosa Parks af!irmed the natural law when she refused to give up her seat on the bus in Montgomery in 1955. A law mandating raeial segregation is unjust and void. Aquinas said that we may be obliged t<J obey an unjust law "to avoid seandal or disturbance," but that a law that is unjust because it would eompel one to violate the divine law must never be obeyed. 
The alternative to natural law is some form of legal positivism, which is based on the idea, as I Ians Kelsen put it, that "justice is an irrational ideal.'! If we cannot affirm any knowable, objec­tive norms of justice, we cannot define any moral limits to what the state can do. "[l]f there is no ultimate truth to guide and direct political activity," said John Paul, "then ideas and convictions can easily be manipulated for reasons of power." We all know that by experi­ence. 
The natural law has not been repealed. Think about it. Even Jack Bauer might find it of interest.

In 2004, filmmaker Sergio Arau asked America a simple question: What would happen if you took all the Latinos out of California? Arau posited a guess with "A Day Without a Mexican."

disappeared from California. For that matter, it would not be too hard to imagine what would happen if every wage-working immigrant in America went missing. 
I selfishly wish that Arau had made his movie about interns instead. What would happen if you took all the unpaid interns out of New York City? Now that is a movie I would take time to see. 
Immigrants and interns are not often mentioned in the same breath but, as an intern, I feel a certain solidarity. with the immigrants that surround me in the melting pot of New York City. 
Our generation has cast aside jobs as camp counselors and busboys to instead sort corporate America's mail. This in an attempt to put a couple of lines on our resumes ·to make the words "Dartmouth College" really

sparkle (or to divert our attention from the omission of our GPAs). 
Since I have left my friends and pro­fessors in Hanover and returned home to intern, I have found it hard to be optimistic all the time (maybe I should be traveling instead). All my intern gloom goes away when I behold the romantic sacrifice of the American immigrant. 
One stormy morning last week, I asked my Polish housekeeper how hard it was raining outside. She told me I needed an umbrella, and I rolled my eyes, saying I would rather miss work than go out in the rain. 
"Work?" she asked skeptically. "But you're a student." 
How should I explain the idea of an internship to her? "It's not a real job, Krystyna; it's just for experience." She still looked confused so I rethought my words. "I only make 10 dollars a day." 
She broke into a grin. "My job is bet­ter than that!" I left that morning with the sound of her laughter still ringing in my ears. 
As an intern, I expect people to laugh at me. Nobody has any respect for interns; they are at the rock bot­tom of any professional hierarchy. The masochist inside of me -and Skip Sturman-thinks that interning bal­ances my willy-nilly Ivy League class­room scholarship with solid profes­sional experience (which is correct). And yet, I still cannot help feel that the dullness of internships might cause my brain to rot. I blame this suf­fering on my professors. 
Our professors imagine that our brains are weapons. I imagine that mine is a death ray. At Dartmouth, I feel like I am using my death ray to capacity, writing poetry, mastering the cello, solving mathematical riddles, translating Catullus and pursuing other "lonely acts," just as the late College President James 0. Freeman would have wanted. 
As an intern, I cannot help but feel that my death ray is being wasted scanning coupons at a supermarket. How can I do something practical like work when I feel like I should be culti­vating my mind? 
At the end of the day, we interns work for little to no money because we know there is another half-educated, resume-wielding twerp willing take our spot, waiting right behind us, and any deliveryman in New York City knows that if he did not show up for work, there would be somebody else willing to do his job, and his absence would be little more than an inconven­ience for the person who hired him. 
Interns and immigrants also under­stand the value of completing unfulfill­ing work for future benefits. 
Jose, the young man who handles the trash and Windexes the mirrors in my building, once told me that before he came to America, he was training to be a pharmacist. Since arriving in America, doing unskilled labor has provided Jose with immediate money, and he probably anticipates that his children will benefit from his hard work. Or maybe he will just save some money and buy an iPod. Either way, he is living the American dream. 
In their own way, internships pos­sess a special dreamlike power; they allow us to test the waters of our future. If our death ray temporarily gets laid to waste on a foreign shore, so be it.

DVD REVIEws· 

'Kong' DVD roars new life into colossal film 
By RAMA GOTTUMUKKALA Senior Staff Writer 
The seminal moment of Peter Jackson's childhood imagination came on a Friday evening in 1970. Huddled in front of his parents' black and white TV, the 9-year-old Peter saw the 1933 classic "King Kong" for the first time. It was love at first sight. 
It "was one of those defining moments in [my] life where everything changed after I saw 'Kong,"' Jackson admits in a documen­tary about his version's genesis. 
In his years following that 1970 evening, young Peter busied himself with making his own version of "Kong." Using his mother's fur coat for the hair, he built a wire and rubber Kong figure. He spent hours deli­cately manipulating the simian, remaking his favorite film using his parents' Super-8 movie camera. Eventually, Jackson had to face the cold hard facts. 

"I got so far and just realized it was never going to be what I was imagining it to be in my mind," he says. 
Cut to Dec. 14, 2005 and the release date for Universal Studios' remake of "King Kong." The results speak for themselves. Jackson's "Kong" is a staggering achieve­ment, a modern marvel of filmmaking ingenuity. Working on a number of levels, it excels as a period piece, an action adven­ture and a love story. It is a work of sur­prising warmth and tenderness thanks to its star, a captivating, digitally-rendered ape who feels more real and humane than dozens of more atypical and mediocre human protagonists. 
Late last year, Universal debuted the three-disc "King Kong: Deluxe Extended Edition" DVD, which clocks in at a hefty 201 minutes-14 more than the theatri­cal release. Most of this footage comes down to action set pieces on Skull Island, including an awe-inspiring triceratops stampede. Jackson and his crew have poured a great deal of effort into this fasci­nating archival project, and it shows. 
Split over the first two discs, the image and audio quality are both pristine. Supported by a thundering soundtrack, the film's breathtaking cinematography and crisp digital backdrops are !lawlessly sharp and vibrant. Much of "King Kong" takes place at night, a typical problem qrea for most DVDs, which tend to lose detail in these scenes. That is not the ease here ­and it is in these deep, inky blacks that "Kong" shows its dexterity. 
A seemingly boundless array of special features await within the confines of this DVD, including deleted scenes, a blooper reel, trailers and a featurette that com­pares this "Kong" to the 1933 version. Chief among them is "Recreating the Eighth Wonder: Making King Kong," a three-hour documentary that rivals the film itself in its scope, depth and running time. None of it is tlufl', which may be its greatest strength. 


In the first 10 minutes of the "Eighth Wonder" feature, Jackson expresses his obvious love for behind-the-scenes looks at movie making. A'i a kid, he would seek out the magazines that had set photographs showing stop-motion artists at work. That enthusiasm has carried over to his DVDs, which feature heavy contributions from the New Zealander director. 
Between this "Kong" extended edition and the superlative, four-disc "Lord of the Rings" extended editions, Jackson has established himself as the DVD medium's biggest supporter. He enthusiastically offers up explanations and lessons on every aspect of fllmmaking on this release, and the two most notable contributions are his warm, insightful commentary with co­writer Philippa Boyens and the mammoth "Eighth Wonder" feature. Simply put, "King Kong: Deluxe Extended Edition" is the best DVD of the last year and one of the fmest DVDs ever released.

'Ducks' 3-pack relives glory of childhood sports 
By SEAN SWEANY Assistant Scene Editor 

Sometimes movies are so campy, cliched and predictable, they're actually quite entertaining and good. When it comes to early '90s movies, there is perhaps no series of movies more in tllis vein than the trilogy of "Mighty Ducks" films, recently released in a DVD 3-Pack. 
Disney produced three "Ducks" films between 1992 and 1996 -featuring nearly identical plotlines and slapstick routines ­that bombed with critics but skated to com­mercial success with audiences, spawning a television series and the creation of an NHL team. 

"The Mighty Ducks" (1992) 
When trial lawyer Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez, "The Breakfast Club") is arrested for drunk driving, he is sentenced to serve community service as a pee-wee hockey coach for a ragtag team of misfits. Although a rocky marriage at first, coach and team discover there are more impor­tant things than winning and use that moral to win the district championship game against their arch-rivals, Bombay's old team and coach. 
This film is the most childish and innocent of the three, and it introduced America to several child actors who would later make big names for themselves, including Shaun Weiss ("Heavyweights") and Joshua Jackson ("Dawson's Creek"). 
"D2: The Mighty Ducks" (1994) 
This is the best -or at least most rn­watchable -of the three, and it follows Bombay and the now famous Ducks as they travel to Los Angeles to compete in the Junior Goodwill Games against the best youth teams in the world. Both Bombay and the team must overcome ego struggles and the feared Iceland team before they can be crowned world champs. 
This film is the best of the group because it is perhaps the most outlandish. The hock­ey is ridiculous, Estevez' locks sparkle from his numerous hair treatments and product placements for Delta Airlines and the Mighty Ducks NHL franchise -both highly connected to the Disney company -are everywhere. Nevertheless, the happy-go­lucky, feel-good attitude this film evokes overshadows all the drawbacks and makes "D2" a lasting legacy. 
"D3: The Mighty Ducks" (1996) 
The third and final "Ducks" film takes a step back from the second, putting the Ducks iJ! a private prep school and effec­tively releasing Emilio Estevez of his duties early in the plot. Under a new coach, the Ducks struggle to be themselves (a common thread throughout the films), but eventually unite under the changed leadership to defeat the school's varsity team. 

"D3" essentially re-uses all the gags from the first two films, but in this ease, all the enthusiasm seemed to have left-from the writing to the directing and acting. Additionally, the absence of Emilio Estevez -whose spacey delivery and mannerisms made the first two films enjoyable -is sorely missed. 
While it is nice having all three "Ducks" films in one DVD set, there is nothing in the way of extras to entice casual fans to buy the set. There are literally no special fea­tures, not even the films' trailers. As the films were made in an era before the incep­tion of DVDs and their special features, per­haps it is not surprising that there are no extras here. 

Obviously, this DVD set is not meant to wow anyone and it caters to a very specific audience (its Amazon.com DVD sales rank is a miserable No. 2,793). In reality, tllis set is a guilty pleasure for many of us who grew up playing street hockey to chants of "Quack, quack, quack" and making sure to incorporate the"Flying-V." Fans of the "Mighty Ducks" films or any early '90s, uplifting sports movies will enjoy it as a trip down memory lane.

'Sunny in Philly' offers brilliant career paths 
With graduation rapidly approaching, the unlucky seniors (like me) who don't already have jobs or graduate school lined up are scrambling to find some way to make money next year, since flex points and Domer Dollars aren't valid currency. 
If you don't actually have a real career plan, then the next best thing is to do something with your friends-and. ideal­ly, something where you wouldn't have to exert yourself and do a lot of.work. One possible plan would be to open a bar. and this is exactly the premise of the growing, critically­acclaimed show "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia." 
Airing during the summers on FX­and entering its third season this sum­mer -"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" revolves around the lives of four completely self-absorbed 20­somethings who run a bar-Paddy's Pub -in the titular city ... because they have nothing else to do. Frequently compared to '"Seinfeld' on crack," the show is less about the bar and more about the antics and situations they encounter in their daily lives. 
The show centers on four friends ­the twins Dennis (Glenn Howerton) and Dee {Kaitlin Olson) Reynolds and their 

Erin McGinn 
Assistant Scene Editor 
friends Mac (Rob McElhenney) and Charlie {Charlie Day). The second sea­son also introduced Dennis and Dee's father Frank, played to comic perfection by the diminutive yet hilarious Danny DeVito. 
"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" has covered a wide variety of controver­sial topics, including abortion, gun con­trol and slavery, through the day to day lives of the characters, and often in their politically-incorrect manners. During the first season, their activities included faking cancer in an effort to get laid, turning up on opposite sides of an abortion rally to meet girls (and get laid) and allowing underage high schoolers to drink at their pub-I think one of the characters wanted to get laid. 
The second season is where the actors and writers truly hit their stride and the show truly shines. In one episode, Dennis and Dee decide that they are sick of working with their dad, who's taken part ownership of the bar, so they go on unemployment. Once their unem­ployment runs out, they try to figure out a way to go on welfare, then set out to smoke crack in order to prove that they're in need of public assistance. Instead, they wind up addicted to crack and all the while insist that they've been emancipated from the daily drudgery of a workday existence to chase their dreams. · 
The show was created by McElhenney, Howerton and Day, and nearly all of the episodes are written by so~e combina­tion of those three. They filmed a pilot episode for under $200 and sent it to FX, which decided that it was good enough to be made into a show. Since they air during the summers, the sea­­sons are fairly short. The first season has only seven episodes, and the second only 10. There are supposed to be 12 to 15 episodes in the upcoming season. Although there are few episodes, they are all highly memorable. And much like any Will Ferrell film, the series is incredibly quotable and highly re­watchable. 


With only 17 half-hour-long episodes 
{all available for download from iTunes). it's entirely possible to get through the series in a weekend. So with study days quickly approaching, grab some friends, some beverages and download the episodes. 
And who knows, if you're an unem­ployed senior, it might just give you a couple ideas.

DVD REVIEW 

'Volver' breathes with tragedy, humor on DVD 
By MARTY SCHROEDER Assistant Scene Editor 
Pedro Almod<lv.ar's "Volver" is one of the saddest, funniest and heart-warming films to be released in recent memory. Starring Penelope Cruz and a host of other Spanish talent, this film is quirky without being inaccessible, tragic with­out being depressing and humorous without being trite. It is a beautiful piece of storytelling that is both local and uni­versal in its themes. 
"Volver" revolves around sisters Raimunda and Sole {Cruz and Lola Duenas) and Raimunda's daughter Paula (Yohana Coho). When a tragic event befalls Raimunda's husband, the film takes divergent paths by telling the story of Raimunda dealing with her now absent husband and the possibility that her mother ·may be haunting her aunt's house. 

While always a monumental task to tell multiple stories within one film, Almodovar does it with skill and aplomb. Though the stories are not narrationally about the same things, they certainly are thematically. This is the strongest point of the film -the way in which Almodovar weaves local traditions and stories of Spain into universal themes of family and community. Raimunda's encounters with the denizens of her town are some of the most rewarding parts of the film and offer important lessons in a world that is becoming increasingly alienated from the concept of communi­ty. 
Cruz shines and revels in her role. Although the film is in Spanish, even those who do not speak the language will understand her emotion and apti­tude in the art of acting. She delves into her character being both harsh and lov­ing in the space of a word. Her role as daughter, sister and parent bring out multiple facets of Almodovar's character and Cruz polishes all these facets until they shine brightly. 
The DVD release is a single-disc edition that offers some sparse but worthwhile features. The American Film Institute (AFI) tribute to Cruz is an in-depth look at one of the most respected actors in the world that is not only able to make it big in her native Spain but also in the cut­throat world of Hollywood. The director and cast interviews are the best features on the DVD. Hearing the famed and sto-ried Almodovar talk about what it was like to make not only this film but also others is worth any sticker price. It is something akin to sitting at the feet of the master and absorbing everything he has to say. Alongside the interviews are commentaries by both Almodovar and Cruz that offer new insights into the decidedly complex film. While there is something to be said about letting a film like "Volver" just sit in the mind for awhile with no outside commentary, what the two primary forces behind the film have to say is equally important. 


Overall, this is a marvelous film that was loved by both critics and audiences. 
It may not be Almodovar's best work, but it is certainly one of his warmest. In the vein of the French "Amelie," it warms even the coldest hearts. But unlike "Amelie," this film takes a deeper look at the human soul and relishes in what it finds. The tangled mess of the soul reflects on the tangled mess that families can be. It doesn't seek to undo the tan­gles; it rather tries to find a way into the loving core of those tangles that all of us have somewhere, however deep we may have it hidden.

Associated Press 
PARIS -Follow-up tests on backup urine samples by Tour de France champi­on Floyd Landis found traces of synthetic testos­terone, the French sports newspaper L'Equipe reported Monday. 
The tests on seven "B" samples clearly showed traces of the banned sub­stance, the paper said on its Web site. _Landis had insisted the follow-up tests weren't necessary because the primary "A" samples tested negative for banned substances during the Tour. 
The tests were done at France's national anti-dop­ing laboratory of Chatenay-Malabry outside Paris. L'Equipe said the lab used a technique that can distin­guish synthetic from natu­ral forms of testosterone, a male sex hormone. The lab is the same one that revealed Landis' positive test for elevated testos­terone to epitestosterone levels after he won the 17th stage of last year's Tour. 

Pierre Bordry, president of the French anti-doping agency, told The Associated Press the tests were con­cluded this weekend but he dido 't know the result because they were sent directly to the U.S. Anti­Doping Agency, which requested the tests. 
Landis spokesman Michael Henson said Monday the head of the French lab prevented the cyclist's expert, Paul Scott, from entering the lab Sunday to witness the test­ing. 
"Such behavior consti­tutes a clear and direct infringement of Landis' rights while casting severe doubt on the integrity of an already dubious process," Henson said in a statement. 
Bordry confirmed the incident had taken place but said it stemmed from a prior agreement stipulating that Landis' expert would attend the test with two USADA experts. 
Scott was excluded 
Sunday because USADA experts didn't show tip, Bordry said. 
USADA general counsel Travis Tygart said agency rules prevent him from commenting on an active case. 
Landis lashed out at USADA in a statement Monday, saying the incident in which his expert was barred from the French lab was "yet another in a series of malicious actions." 
''I'm infuriated by the behavior of USADA" and the French lab, Landis said. "Togethe~ they have turned this proceeding into a full-scale attack on my civil rights and a mockery of justice." 
IN BRIEF 
No St!ll>rise as Barbosa wins 
NBA 6th man award 
PHOENIX -Leandro Barbosa, among the fastest players in the NBA, ran away with the league's sixth man award Monday. 
The "Brazilian Blur" received 101 of a possible 127 first-place votes from a media panel. 
The honor came one day after Barbosa matched his career playoff high with 26 points -in the Phoenix Suns' 95-87 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers Sunday in Game 1 of their opening series. 
"Give him a soccer ball," the Lakers' Kobe Bryant said when ~sked what could be done to stop Barbosa. 
"Tell him Brazilians should be play­ing soccer, not basketball." 
Barbosa was a reserve in 62 of the 80 games he played this season, adding extra speed to the already fast Suns. · 
"It's a fun team to win so many games," Barbosa said. 

Metal bats to be replaced in 
New York school system 
NEW YORK -Metal bats will be banned from high school baseball in the nation's largest school system starting this September after the City Council on Monday overrode a may­oral veto of the bill. 
The measure outlawed metal bats under the theory that they produce balls with greater velocity and raise the risk of injury because of less reaction time. Opponents, including little League Baseball and equipment suppliers, say there is no evidence metal bats are more dangerous. 
Youth leagues and lawmakers are proposing similar bans in other areas, including New Jersey, where a 12-year-old boy went into cardiac arrest and suffered serious injuries after a batted ball struck him in the chest. 
In New York City, Mayor Michael Bloomberg vetoed the bat ban this month. 
Fallen pilot remembered by
Oklahoma football coach 
NORMAN, Okla. -The Navy Blue Angels pilot who died Saturday in a crash in South Carolina once had Oklahoma fo.gtball coach Bob Stoops as a passenger in his plane. 
Lt. Cmdr. Kevin J. Davis of Pittsfield, Mass., was in his second year with the Blue Angels, who are known for their high-speed aero­batic demonstrations. 
Last May 10, Davis took Stoops and former "American Idol" win­ner Kelly Clarkson on a ride in his Blue Angels jet in Fort Worth, Texas. 
On Sunday, Stoops recalled the flight. "My experience with Lt. Davis was overwhelming," Stoops said. 
"You just don't run into that cal­iber of person very often. He was bright and obviously very intelli­gent; a role model. That came across to me in just half a day."

Women's water polo secures bid to the nationals 
Men's sailing finishes third in Northwestern Regatta; women's sailing fails to qualify for nationals at Diamond Lake 
Special to The Observer 
Women's Water Polo secured a bid to nationals this weekend by winning the Midwest Conference Tournament. 
Playing at home, the Irish started off strong, beating Western Michigan 15-2. Cristina Romano and Kelly Horner led the scoring with four goals apiece, MC Cimino and Kristin Schmitt each had two, and Bridget O'Neill, Ali Schilling and Emily Harig each added another. Goaltending was split between Betsy O'Neill and Maggie Hyde. 
In the championship game, the Irish faced Grand Valley State. GVSU scored the first two goals of the game, but the Irish came back with seven unanswered goals, leading to an eventual score of 15-3. 
O'Neill led the team with five goals, Horner added another four, Schmitt and Romano had two apiece, and Cimino and Schilling each one. The cage was guarded by goalie O'Neill. 
The team will head to nation­als in two weeks, which will be held at Williams College in Massachusetts. 
Sailing 
The Notre Dame sailing club just missed qualifying for women's nationals as it placed third in the qualifier the Irish hosted at Diamond Lake -the top two schools qualified. 
Jaci Chase and Kerry Kilbourn finished fourth in A's, while Tricia Hughes and Ali Donahue placed third in the B Division. 
The men's Irish squad, com­peting at the Northwestern Regatta, finished third among 16 schools. Tim Roy and Nasha Baughman were tenth in A's and Tim O'Brien and Paul Cordes captured first in B's. 
Men's Rowing 
Notre Dame's varsity and novice crews squared off against Northwestern, Marquette, and North Park Rowing Club at Crystal Lake Park. The racing was over an 1800-meter course located northwest of Chicago. 
The novice 4+ set the tone for the regatta by winning the first race of the morning. Andria Seneviratne's crew of Steve Walter, Nick Springer, Ben Queen, and Mark Brickey edged out Northwestern's top crew by a margin of 7:16.25 to 7:18.72, while easily leaving behind two Marquette crews and one North Park boat. Radhika Deva's boat of Craig Wiborg, Tomas Castillo, Andrew Matasic, and Matt Napierski took fourth in the lightweight 4+ event. Notre Dame's varsity 4+ crew of Mike Lehmann, Ray Schleck, Tedd Hawks, Michael Lucci, and Steve Maher took third in the varsity event, while Gigi Gutierrez, Karol Grzesiak, Jake Teitgen, P.J. McAward, and Taylor Donaldson finished fourth in the same race. 
The eight-man Irish crews were the first to the finish line all afternoon. Julie Lambe's sec­ond varsity eight raced Northwestern's lightweight 8+, which is Northwestern's fastest eight-man boat. Lambe's crew of Michael Lutkus, Tom Mazzacavallo, Matt Degnan, Andrew Baker, Andrew Matasic, Matt Napierski, Nick Kluesner, and Michael Giordano finished in 6:07.75, leaving the Northwestern lightweights 7 seconds behind. 
The novice 8+ boat of Beth Daley, Steve Walter, Nick Springer, Ben Queen, Mark Brickey, Andrew Haynes, Yang Chen, Tom Kenny, and Jorge Trejo captured an easy victory in their event. 
The closest competition for Notre Dame's first novice boat was Notre Dame's second novice boat. Caitlin Hawryszkow coxed Brian Simpson, Josue Rodriguez, Conor Binder, Steven Cumberworth, Colin Cimala, Devin Vrable, Tommy Clarke, and John Deng to second place in the event, leaving Marquette and Northwestern behind from the start of the race. The last race of the day featured Notre Dame's top two crews in the varsity 8+ event. Gigi Gutierrez's crew of Ray Schleck, Tedd Hawks, Karol Grzesiak, Jake Teitgen, Michael Lucci, Taylor Donaldson, P.J. McAward, and Steve Maher completed the course in 
6:00.31. Julie Lambe coxed nearly the same crew as in her previous race, with Craig Wiborg and Tomas Castillo switched in for Andrew Matasic and Matt Napierski. Lambe's boat finished second in 6:06.7 4, while Northwestern's two boats took third and fourth. 
Cycling 
The Irish women salvaged an otherwise lackluster weekend for the Notre Dame 

Cycling Team by scoring top 20 finishes in both races this weekend. 
Women's A-racers Meghan Johnson and Jenn Perricone with Men's A racers Matt Prygoski, Neil Griggs, Mike Lavery, Andy Steves, and Tim Campbell made the trip to 
Wisconsin this weekend with Peter Nistler accompanying in support role. 
Saturday's race was a 70-mile road race through the rolling glacial deposits of Sheboygan County, Wisconsin. 
The Woman's A field departed on their 50-mile excursion min­utes afterwards. Perricone put in her best effort to date and showing the great strides she has made throughout the sea­son by placing 12th while Johnson fell off the pace early, but dug deep to come back and finish 15th. 
The Men's A field splintered apart due to the wind, aggres­sive racing, and a few well timed attacks. The first casual­ty of the race was Steves, who returned to the team car 40 miles in an attempt to save his legs for the next day. Campbell choked on a Powerbar in a feed zone and consequently fell of the pace, and Griggs dropped ofT soon after. 
Campbell eventually caught Griggs and the two finished the race for the Irish 
coming in outside of placing. 
Prygoski and Lavery stuck with the pack for most of the race, with Prygoski falling off when the group counterat­tacked one of his moves. Prygoski also came in outside of placing. Lavery exhibited his Ironman endurance with the highest Irish placing at 17th. 
The weather was beautiful for the Irish in Sunday's criterium around the Capitol Building in downtown Madison, Wisconsin. The one-kilometer square was fast and had one decent rise, which put the hurt on riders. 
Perricone and Johnson lined up first for the Irish in their 45­minute elite Women's A race. Johnson and Perricone suffered sore legs from the previous day's effort, but 
still managed respectable 17th and 19th place finishes, respectively. 
The one-hour Men's A race was fast, completing nearly 28 miles. Griggs and Steves were gapped early in the race and chased hard, but were pulled from the race 30 minutes in and not allowed to finish, Lavery, Prygoski, and Campbell worked hard throughout the race, launching attacks and making moves, none of which lasted. 
With 3 laps to go, Campbell went off the front in an effort to win the race solo. No one from the pack organized the chase and Campbell opened up a size­able gap. With 2 laps to go the peleton became,motivated to chase and Campbell was caught with three quarters of a lap remaining. 
Prygoski and Lavery contest­ed the field sprint coming in 17th and19th with Campbell coming in outside of placing. 
The Irish will compete this weekend in the Midwest Collegiate Cycling Conference Championships in Indianapolis, the last regular season race weekend.

"I don't know if it's added pressure, but I think we all want to work hard," she said. "We work hard all the time so as long as we keep it together, we'll be fme."

Albion is a less accomplished squad, entering with a team ERA of 4.93 and batting average of .251. The Britons' ace pitcher is sophomore Amber Hummel, who has posted a 3.40 ERA but owns a 2-7 record, thanks in large part to poor run support. 

In the past week the Belles have returned to their early-sea­son form, easily handing losses to Goshen and Olivet. The Belles' top four sluggers -freshman Ashley Peterson (.436), sopho­more Kristin Amram (.429), sen­ior Sarah Miesle (.408) and

erful offense and dominant pitching into South Bend, bat­ting .297 as a team with a 1.77 EHA. Sophomore Tammy Williams and seniors Katie Logan and Garland Cooper have given opposing pitchers fits all season with their com­bination of power and speed. 
Williams leads the team with 
a .465 batting average and 11 homers on the season, while Logan is close behind batting .380. Cooper has been one of the premiere power hitters in the nation this season, hitting 18 home runs with 54 RBis while batting .370. 
The Wildcat pitchers have been just as dominant as their hitters this year, with pitchers Lauren Delaney and Eileen Canney each giving up less than two runs per game. Delaney, a freshman, sports a 16-2 record with 15 complete games. Canney, a senior, is 20­8 with 20 complete games and 236 strikeouts in 169 innings. 
Despite the success and tal­ent of Northwestern, Irish sophomore pitcher Brittney Bargar said the team is still very confident. 
"We have been doing a good job putting the ball in play and taking advantage of opponents weaknesses," Bargar said. "We have been playing amazing defense that has really limited our opponents." 
The game likely will carry extra significance for the Irish, whose season has been ended by the Wildcats the past two years in the NCAA Tournament. Notre Dame will have to get its hitting back on track to have a chance against Northwestern -in the four Irish losses over the weekend, the team scored just four runs. 

"A huge key to our success is scoring first, and making things happen," Bargar said. "Taking the momentum right off the bat and staying ahead are really important." 
Much of the team's success this season has also been based on the performance of Bargar and fellow pitcher Kenya Fuemmeler. Bargar 
leads the team with a 16-9 record and a 1.98 ERA, while Fuemmeler is 8-9 with a 3.00 ERA. 
Notre Dame is 13-1 in games in which the Irish have scored first, and 20-0 when leading through the first three innings. 
The game is the second to last at home for the Irish, who will play their last home game against Illinois-Chicago Wednesday.

Irish one round aW"ay fron1 conference ti tie 
ND holds three-shot lead into final round 
By LORENZO REYES Sports Writer 
Notre Dame is poised tD win the Big East championships when it enters the final round today with a three-stroke lead. after it shot a 14-over par 392 in the second round Tuesday. 
Louisville shot the lowest score of the day Monday with its 11-over par performance, shaving three strokes off the Irish lead to move into second place. South Florida is a dis­tant third, 22 strokes behind the Irish. 
Notre Dame's overall score is an 18-over par 594 with solid contributions from the team's young golfers. 
Freshman Annie Brophy clubbed a one-over par 73, mainly due to her team-high five birdies on the day. After shooting an even par in the first round, the freshman leads the Irish in scoring and is in a tie for second in the tournament. 
Senior co-captain Noriko 
Nakazaki shot a two-over par 7 4 on the day, placing her in a tie for sixth place. After her first round score of one-over par, Nakazaki looks to move up the leaderboard with a strong final round. 
Freshman Julie Kim fell six strokes behind her first­round mark when she fired a six-over par 78 after break­ing for even par on the first day. She enters the final round in command of seventh place. 
Sophomore Lisa Maunu equaled her first-round mark of a five-over par 77 on the second day, which was good enough for a ninth-place tie. She is the third member of the Irish in the top-10.

One more chance to qualify 
Belles tee offin MIAA NCAA qualifier final round this afternoon 
By KATE ARNOLD Sports Writer 
It has all come down to this. 
Saint Mary's will compete today in the third and final round of the MIAA NCAA quali­fying tournament, held at Tri­State University's Zollner golf course. With a two-day total of 760, the team currently sits in fifth place, behind Olivet, Albion, Hope and Tri-State. Captain Katie O'Brien leads the team with a score of 165. Sophomore Meredith Fantom follows next, with a total of 192. 
The Belles have had their sights on this tournament all spring, but the team is current­ly 36 strokes off the lead going in to the final round. 

"The past few weeks have mostly consisted of fine tuning our golf swings and working mainly around the green to help us score low," Fantom said. "Spring break was incredibly intense for the golf team since we were playing every day, and we really have worked hard since then to practice every day and really work on the areas that each of us needed to improve on." 
Although it's a long road to victory, the team still has high hopes. 
"The course we are playing tomorrow is not nearly as tough as the course we played this past weekend," Fantom said. "Consistently working on chipping and putting [has been I the most crucial part of preparing ... because with a solid short game we will bfl able to score low as a whole team." 
The Belles are a young team, and were forced to change their fall line up due to the loss of talented players, but they remain confident and enthusi­astic. 
"If we don't qualify for Nationals this year, it is in our future plans for next year, and we are all very excited to be one of the top competitors in the fall next year. Our team is extremely close knit and I think that will attribute to our successes this season." Fantom said. 
After today's competition, the MIAA squad with the lowest cumulative score will advance to the NCAA Championships held May 8-11 at El Campeon Golf Course at the Mission Inn and Hesort & Club in Howey­in-the-Hills, Fla.

McGraw also said that Washington's departure could give her other coaches ­Jonathan Tsipis and Angie Potthoff -a chance to step up to fill that void. 
"It will be an opportunity for somebody to come in and then do some things here," she said. "And it will also be an opportu­nity for the two assistants that we currently have to do a little bit more." 
One additional problem with Washington going to Penn State is that the Irish are scheduled to play them next season at the Joyce Center in the second leg of a home-and­horne series. McGraw said that this causes a problem because she does not like to play against her former assistants and avoids scheduling games against their teams whenever possible. 
"It's just interesting that they're already on the sched­ule, but we'll see," she said. "They have not called yet about dropping the game but we cer­tainly will talk about that."

Another problem that sur­faced against West Virginia was an inability to fend off breaking pitches in the strike squad that was 2-6 in con­ference play at one point. 
But Schrage doesn't want to make any promises with conference leaders Rutgers and Louisville stili left to play. 
"We have a tough schedule ahead," he said. There are opportunities for improvement, however, like

tonight's match-up with non­conference Ball State. T h e Cardinals are 15-24 overall and just 4-11 in the Mid­American Conference. 
First base­man Matt Stoeklen, who is hitting .319 this sea­son with four horne runs and 25 RBis, leads the Ball Naismith award winners Niele Ivey (2001) and Megan Duffy (2005). 

"She's really grown tremen­dously into the coach that she is now from all the different experiences she's had here working with so many different inevitable part of coaching col­lege basketball. 
"When you graduate a player who did a lot for the team, I think it's the same thing with coaching," McGraw said. "You're always going to lose people. I feel like it's my job to to locate their breaking stuff for strikes, but he was put­ting them over the plate," Schrage said of West Virginia's pitching. 
Even with the loss, howev­er, the Irish have won six of their last eight games. And, if the season ended today, they would qualify for a spot in the Big East tournament -an impressive feat for a State offense. 
After the Cardinals, the Irish will wrap up their 12­garne horne stand against Valparaiso Wednesday before traveling to Piscataway, N.J., to play the Scarlet Knights over the weekend.

aggressive press, trapping in the corners and dropping back to a 2-3 zone that tried to swallow the point guard at the top of the key. This defense worked well for the Barbers, who quickly climbed out of their hole to pull within one at the half. 
The game was physical with both teams jawing, hustling for rebounds, and playing gritty in­your-face defense. With the game tied at 20-20, it came down to ball control and free throws. The Marksmen shot poorly at the line, going 1-6 from the charity stripe. In the end, though, it was the speed and athleticism of the Marksmen that helped them pull away. 
With the ball at the top of the key, the Marksmen stole a lazy pass off of the Barbers, leading to a foul on the ensuing layup. The Marksmen missed their free throw attempt, but in Bookstore Basketball, a team only shoots one free throw and gets the ball back. On their possession after the missed free throw, the Marksmen's George Fisher, wearing No. 3, was fouled. Fisher then sank the free throw to win the game. 
''I'm number three for a rea­son because the third time is a charm," said Fisher, talking about his previous misses from the line before his game winner. 
"It was a hard fought game, and we made a lot of strides to where we want to be," Marksmen coach Alvin Reynolds said. "[Marksmen players] Tommie Lee, Geogre Fisher, and Dan Djondo all played very hard and did a good job of finishing the game."

In this battle of two capable and athletic teams, it was the Engineering Giants that were able to come through in the end in this marathon of a game that lasted over an hour and a half. 
The game, which began with a fast pace, quickly slowed down as both teams had difficulty scoring. Ingabo relied heavily on .its athleticism to help them pen­etrate to the heart of the Giants' 2-3 zone, while the Giants relied on their size advantage to attack the post. With both teams col­lapsing in the middle and inca­pable of consistently making outside shots, points were sparse. With little offense to sep­arate the two teams, the Giants handled the ball and rebounded better to take an 11-10 lead at half. 
The second half was much the same; however, as time wore on, conditioning became a big fac­tor. Both teams' offensives slowed down even more in the second half, but it was the 
SOFTBALL 

Giants who were able to handle a longer game. Fatigue con­tributed to Ingabo committing even more turnovers in the sec­ond half, which allowed the Giants to pick up easy buckets. In the end, the size and endurance of the Giants were just too much. 
"This just proves that old men, old engineers nonetheless, can still play," Engineering Giants coach Tim Hall said. 
"If we played them ten times, they would win five," Giants player Phil Schonewill said. "It was a very hard fought game." 
Air Force One 21 Straight From Da 'Burbs 10 
Air Force One flew on all cylin­ders Monday, taking care of Straight From Da 'Burbs in con­vincing fashion. 
Before the game, 'Burbs cap­tain T.J. Ceravolo was not intimi­dated by his team's noticeable size disadvantage. 
"I wake up every morning, and I [urinate] excellence," he said. 
Despite Ceravolo's confidence, Air Force One used its size to establish an inside presence early. St. Edward's freshman Joe DeMott authoritatively grabbed boards and hit several inside shots. No one from Da 'Burbs was able to challenge him in the paint. 
Air Force One captain Rich Ybarra was responsible for han­dling the quick Ceravolo, and he did so effectively throughout the contest. On the offensive end, Ybarra ran his offense patiently and efficiently, refusing to yield to the pressure applied by Ceravolo.

sank in. They aggressively chal­lenged every single Air Force One shot, even shots that had no chance of being blocked. They committed 18 fouls total, allow­ing Air Force One to reach the bonus early on in both halves. 
While the outcome of the game was never in doubt, Ybarra and his teammates were far from pleased with their level of play. 
"We definitely have to play better than that in the next round," Ybarra said. 
Indian Peaks 21 We Sold Our Naming Rights to Miml19 

In an intense and well-played contest with a running time of more than 70 minutes, Indian Peaks outlasted We Sold Our Naming Rights to Mimi, coming away with a two-point victory. 
Naming Rights' big man Sean Murphy felt good during warm­ups. 
"We're excited. [Captain] Matt Cavo is going to be feeling it," he said. 
Indian Peaks, led by captain Matt Frankenfeld, attempted to set the tone early by creating fast break opportunities, but Naming Rights ran the floor in both directions, not allowing any easy baskets for Frankenfeld or his teammates. 
Cavo and his teammates may have been feeling it on the defensive side of the ball, but neither team could establish an offensive edge early on. Impenetrable 2-3 zone defenses employed by both teams forced several turnovers and prevented either from establishing an inside presence. With gusts of wind wreaking havoc on every

outside shot, points were at a premium early. 
Eventually, Indian Peaks' Ray Farabaugh found his rhythm. He ran his team's offense with unmatched proficiency, and his shots were the first to start dropping. 
Naming Rights kept pace by grabbing rebounds and convert­ing crisp outlet passes into easy buckets, eventually coming to within one point of Indian Peaks at 20-19. 
At that point, Frankenfeld put an exclamation point at the end of his performance. With momentum on the side of Naming rights, Frankenfeld established position underneath with a beautiful spin move from the free throw line. He was fouled on the shot and made his free throw to secure victory for Indian Peaks.

At the start of the first half, the Marksmen jumped out to a quick 5-0 lead before the Barbers could gather them­selves. The Marksmen played an up-tempo style of play with an aggressive man-to-man defense, while the Barbers started ofT with a soft 2-3 zone.

Stellar round puts ND in contention 
Isban and Gifford get Irish back in the mix for conference title 
By FRAN TOLAN Sports Writer 
After finishing Sunday's opening round in fourth place, Notre Dame mounted a charge and finished Monday with the second-best two-day score at the Big East championships in Louisville. 
The Irish now trail only the host Cardinals heading into today's final round. 
Louisville has a team score of 14-under-par 562-a mark 16 strokes ahead of the Irish. 
"It's always going to be a two-team race here," Irish sen­ior Cole lsban said. "They've just played better than us on their home course." 
lsban and fellow senior co­captain Adam Gifford led the comeback for Notre Dame, which overtook St. John's and Marquette on the leaderboard Monday. _ 
A day after tying his career­low round with a three-under­par 69, Gifford fired an even­par 72, leaving him tied for second in the individual stand­ings, behind Louisville's Daryl Fathauer. 
Isban, meanwhile, rebounded after shooting a first-round 76 to card a four-under 68 and move into a tie for eighth place in the tournament. 
Sophomore Josh Sandman continued his consistent play, notching a 74 Monday after shooting a 73 in the opening round. Sandman sits in a tie for 17th heading into today's linal round. 
Junior Greg !lodgers and freshman Doug Fortner round out the field for the Irish, with respective two-day scores of 148 and 149. 
Notre Dame is now six shots ahead of third-place

Marquette, though the Irish are more concerned with Louisville. Despite the 16-shot deficit, Notre Dame thinks it has a shot to make up ground on the Cardinals before the final team scores are tallied today. 
"We basically have to play match play with whoever we're playing against from Louisville," lsban said. "If we each beat our guy by four shots, then we have a shot." 
The Irish tee off for the final round in 10 minute intervals starting at 8 a.m.

Penn State hires Irish asst. coach 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Associate Sports Editor 
The Irish bench is going to look a little different next year. 
After spending 12 years with Notre Dame -four as a player and the last eight as an assis­tant coach -Irish c o a c h Coquese Washington accepted the head coaching position at Penn State Monday. 
The posi­tion opened when former Lady Lions head coach Rene Portland stepped down March 23 following alle­gations that she discriminated against lesbian players. 
Irish coach MuiTet McGraw said that Washington is pre­pared to step into the head coaching role. 
"She has the total package," McGraw said. "She's going to be a great head coach. I think she's ready for the challenges, and I know that she's excited about this opportunity." 
As a player at Notre Dame from 1989-93, Washington was a role player, earning a mono­gram all four years while lead­ing the team in steals in four seasons and assists in three. For her career, Washington is ranked second in Irish history in steals (307), second in steals per game (2.7), fifth in assists 
(554) and fourth in assists per game (4.9). 
Washington continued her playing career in the WNBA for seven seasons, winning a championship with the Houston

Pitching looks to bounce back at Eck 
Team looks to recover from Sunday's loss to WVU with Ball State 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Editor 
After seeing its five-game winning streak eome to a screeching halt against West Virginia Sunday, Notre Dame will try to regroup tonight at 
6:05 against Ball State at Frank Eck Stadium. 
The Irish (21-18, 6-8 Big East) were tied with the 
Mountaineers 7-7 after six innings Sunday but had their pitching collapse in the final third of the game and found themselves on the wrong side of a 16-7 decision. 
In the process, Notre Dame gave up 20 hits -by far the most this season. Irish coach Dave Schrage said he expects his pitching staff, which had been strong all year, to bounce back in time for the contest with the Cardinals tonight.
