Whykids can't read: 
Geneticd~ficiency? 
SAN DIEGO (AP) -Some intelligent children simply can­not be taught to read, and society should accept that fact instead of wasting money and time in a vain effort, according to the head of a learning dis­ability clinic run by the nation's largest prepaid health plan. 
"It's like a physical handicap for some kids, a code they'll never break," said Dr. John H. Richards, director of the Kaiser-Permanent learning dis­ability clinic in San Diego. ' 
"Let's not say a: child is a "lilure just because he can't do one thing,." Richards said. "Ifhe can't read by the age of1 3 or 14, encourage him to go into other areas where reading isn't es­sential."  
There are "geniuses with an IQ of 150 and over who can't rt::ad and never will be able to," who deserve a chance to earn fame and fortune, Richards said in an interview. 
"We all were brought up that you're dumb if you're illiterate or certainly that you can learn with enough special instruc­tion," Richards said, "But after 13 years of research, I'm con­vinced that simply isn't true. 
"There comes a time to give up trying to teach them to read and start letting them live around it." 
Richards, a 46-year-old pe­diatrician, said at least 2 percent of young people unable to read can become successful "when they're out in situations where they don't have to read; at least 
HELP WANTED 
not out loud." 
The toughest thing for par­ents is to admit it, he said, "but they're gradually beginning to understand they're putting an awful lot of money and time into kids who will never learn to read." 
Almost 500 remedial reading patients are seen annually at the clinic, which opened in 197 5 for children from families with Kaiser medical insurance. The clinic, part of Kaiser-Perman­ente's nationwide group of 30 hospitals and 110 medical of­fices, acts as the pupils' advo­cate through their schools, providing diagnostic tests and recommending treatment. 
At the clinic, Richards said, the parents are told that "some children don't have that neur­ological connection to break some sorts ofcodes you need to break-reading is a code with nothing to do with one's basic intelligence." 
Richards said a child who is forced too long to try to learn to read "will begin to hide his handicap and mess himself up. Let him say 'Here I am, I can't read,' like if he doesn't have a right leg so don't make him play soccer. 
"Admit it, some people just can't read," Richards said. "Not everybody can be Willie Mays, just as not everyone can learn to play golf...lt's OK if the kid 
feels  all  right  about  himself  
even if he can't read.  
"It's  not  the  end  of  the  
world."

Gettingalong fine 

Co-eds reside in highschool dorms 
By john M. Higgins ­
The women of Villa Angela would like to let everyone know that they are happy and healthy and don't need any sympathy. This was the message conveyed by both the residents and the rector of the temporary dormitory located on the property of St. Joseph's High School. 
"We've become the sob story ofthe campus," resident Alice Aimette said. "I'm really sick of hearing 'Oh, you poor thing!' just because I live here. I'm getting along just fine. 
The residents remarked that they are being treated very well by the rest ofthe campus. "The halls on campus have made a special effort to include us in their activites," Rector Dolores Ward said. She pointed to an invitation from residents of Flanner Hall to a section pig roast and to a vase of flowers sent by residents of Zahm. "It's things like this that make the girls feel welcome," she added. 
The major complaint voiced by the residents

The lake is very rich in nutrients which also promote algae growth. When the dead algae falls to the bottom it decomposes, James Litton, as­sistant professor of biology, said. "This decomposition adds to the' nutrients causing new algae growth. Copper sulfate is 
used  only  for  cosmetic  pur­ 
poses.  It  has  no  long  term

was the reliability of the shuttle bus between the dormitory and campus. "I just spent an hour running back and forth from Notre Dame to SaintMary's," resident Lynn Placke complained. "The bus driver said that he didn't go there for another 30 minutes." 
"Saturday the buses didn't run at all," Alyssa Aimette said. "Sunday they ran but it was prcr,tty sporadic." 
"You really begin to have doubts about the service," Placke said. "They want us to ride back and forth on the bus, but if it's not reliable, we're going to walk." 
According to Mrs. Ward, Student Activities Director Dr.James McDonald was "arranging to work out problems" with the shuttle but didn't know just when the scheduling difficulties would be cleared up. "I think it's just lack of communication with the drivers," she said. 
"I'm just tired ofhaving everyone tell me how sorry they are that I live here," Placke said. "I like it here."

Kentucky governor denies presidential hopes ...Lake 
FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP)­Gov. John Y. BrownJr. says it is "totally presumptuous to give any consideration for' national office." 
With that comment, the new Kentucky governor seemed to be backing away from an earlier exploratory move that was gen­erated in part by his aides during the Democratic national con­vention. 
At that time, he said that the presidency interested him as a possible goal and that he has discussed it with his wife Phyllis. 
But in an interview last week,. for me, but I try to curb it," he 

Brown took pains to disassociate himself not only from the pro­motional efforts ofhis followers, but from any desire for the presidency. 
He has "absolutely none," he said, while continuing to hold out the possibility that he may seekanothertermasgovernor­
if a proposed succession amend­ment is approved by voters in November 1981. Brown's term ends in December 1983. 
"There are a lot of people around me that have ambitions said. "I just know that I enjoy what I'm doing, I have a home in Cave Hill (Lexington), a new baby and I couldn't be more happy. 
Brown said he thinks his staff "wentoverboard" in touting him for president recently "and I've already sent word that I don't want any more of that." 
The governor said that of all the political possibilities, anoth­er term in his current office "would be the only one I would have any remote interest in at

this time." 
"The other thoughts and am­bitions are too far in the future to really relate to," he said. "I don't have to have the ego boost." 
Time will tell the effectiveness of his administration and whe­ther he and his wife continue to enjoy it, Brown said. 
"She made a tremendous committment to come down to a new state and she's fit in very well, but I owe something to her interest, too," he said. 
Brown said  he  is "naturally  
flattered"  by  the  presidential  
speculation.  

"ButI don't want that to be the perception of me because that's not where my head is," he said. 
"lfl don't do anything more in four years than run this state on a businesslike basis the way it ought to be run, then I feel I will have done something worth­while without political deci­sions." 
(continued from page 3) 
The copper sulfate can only be added twice a year. If the concentration of copper be­comes too high in the lake it can be toxic to the plant and animal life in the lake, according to Litton. "The biology depart­ment uses Lake Marion to study the ecosystem. It is important to protect it for this reason," Joseph Bonadies explained. 
The bottom ofLake Marion is concrete. The weeds on the bottom are "actually lillies that have been artificially intro­duced. They are held in place with cinder blocks and can be easily moved around," Litton commented. 
When the decomposition builds up on the bottom of the lake it must be dredged. This is also done by Bonadies. This dredging last took place about three years ago, according to Clarence Dineen. 




Bookstore sets new book policy 
by Kelli Flint Senior Staff Reporter 
As a result ofstricter publisher return policies, the Notre Dame bookstore has revised its book return policy, according to Brother Conan Moran, book­store manager. 
The new policy requires both a drop slip and a receipt ifl order to receive refunds for returned books. 
Brother Conan cited several reasons for the new policy. "At a recent meeting in Chicago, publishers expressed concern over the increasing number of books returned to them from college bookstores," Conan said. "As a result, we can't return as many books to the publishers . Now we are only able to return 20 percent of ordered books to the publishers." 
Conan added that student misuse was a consideration in changing the policy. "We feel that the old policy was badly misused," Conan said. "Students purchased books without think­ing, and in many cases brought them all back. Some students purchased our books for classes while they looked for used ones. Consequently, we had an excess of unused books." 
The new book return policy should help everyone in the long run, according to Book Depar­tment head Pat Vanek. "The policy should encourage stu­dents to make sure that they have the correct books," Vanek said. "Previously, we would run out of books during the first week of classes and reorder them. Stu­dents would then return many of the hook~ reordered, and we 
were left with an excess of books." 
Conan, who has managed the bookstore since 194 7, noted that the cost of books has become very high, despite what students may think or say. "We're not operating at " profit on text­books," Conan said. "We receive a 20 percent discount on text­books, but we have to pay freight, which is about 3 percent of the cost of the shipment. Considering freight costs and the new limits on returns, we're operating at a loss on text­books." 
There have been some excep­tions to the new policy, accor­ding to Vanek. "If a student accidentally purchases the wrong book for a class, we will exchange the book," Vanek said. "We will exchange books in circumstan­ces such as this, but we will not give cash refunds without a drop slip and a current receipt."

Chemicals clear SMC Lake 
By Cece Ba!t'les 
Lake Marion, Saint Mary's 

man-made lake, was recently 
cleared of the algae clogging it. Joseph Bonadies, the head groundskeeper, and his assis­tant, Mark Korpacki, sprayed the lake with copper sulfate to kill the algae. 
When the weather gets hot the algae grows more rapidly, said Bonadies. Lake Marion has both an inlet for fresh water and an-outlet. There is not enough flow to create circulation, so when the temperature reaches 80 or 90 degrees there is a rapid 
-r· 

~ ..Party 

(continued from page 1) 
"everybody in the section will probably chip in a couple bucks," one of the charged students said. He added that no one was pretending the three were the only ones giving the party. 
Brother Charlie explained that the original problem with the section party was simply the crowd of people in the hall. Assistant rector Jack Jones went through the hallway trying to increase in algae growth, Bonadies explained. 
When the algae growth be­gins to clog the lake, Bonadies makes the decision to spray with copper sulfate. This occurs about twice a year1 This week the copper sulfate "killed the algae, and the heavy rains knocked it to the bottom ofthe lake," Bonadies added. 
The algae is an important part of the ecology of the lake. Bonadies works closely with the biology department to protect the balance between plant life and animal life. "The algae is very important because the fish, which are bluegills, not only feed on it, but it also supplies them with oxygen. We just have to put up with the algae," Bonadies said. 
The small size ofLake Marion also contributes to the algae problem. Dr. Clarence Dineen, professor of biology at Saint Mary's, explained, "The Notre Dame lakes are 100 times the size ofLake Marion. Therefore, they do not get the congestion that we do."

send people into rooms and discovered the keg after noticing cups and glasses of beer rather than the usual cans and bottles. 
Though "too many invited" was among the charges against the three Grace residents, Brother Charlie clarified the keg as the main issue. "the guys are pretty helpless once the party gets out of hand," he said, but added that leafing through directories and inviting all the girls on campus from Florida could have affected the crow­ding, which was intensified after 
the Polish Wedding at nearby Stepan Center let out. 
The three charged students chose to appear before the ju- dicial board of their hall rather than accept a fine and hall probation proposed by the rec­tor. After the hearing later this week the three may appeal theJ­board's ruling back to their rector if they are not yet satisfied and finally to the Dean of Students, James Roemer, where the disciplinary buck stops. 


Foreign affairs set candidates apart 
by the Associated Press 
The president said the Rep­ublican Party under Ronald Reagan is not the same as it was under Gerald Ford "and pres­idents all the way back to (Dwight D.) tisenhower." 
Those presidents, he said, were committed to controling nuclear weapons and "not launching a nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union which no one could win." 
Reagan, said Carter, is the first one to depart from that com­mitment. 
"He has announced that ifhe's elected president that he will initiate a massive nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union. This would mean that if he did that then there would be no reason for the United States and the Soviet Union to try to ne­gotiate an arms control treaty. 
"I consider this one of the most serious threats to the safety and the security and the peace of our nation and the world that is being dramatized in this 1980 
election,  and  therein  lies  the  
primary difference."  
Carter spent  a  few  minutes  

alone with 95-year-old Bess Truman in the graceful, century­old Truman home at 219 North Delaware Street, at the corner of Truman Road. 
"I had a very exciting visit with Mrs. Truman," the president said. "It's indeed an honor for a president ofour country to come to the home that belonged to one of the greatest presidents who ever lived and served our nation." Truman died in 1972. 
In Detroit, Reagan talked separately with the chairmen of the Big Three automakers, then toured the plant in which Chrysler is building its new front wheel drive. K-car, the fuel ef­ficient model the firm hopes will be its salvation. 
The Democratic administra­tion · has scolded Detroit for building the wrong kinds ofcars, Reagan told about 200 workers. 
"There is something that government has a responsibility for that it has shirked so far," he added. "That is to convince the Japanese that in one· way or another for their own best in­terest that the deluge of their cars into the United States must be slowed while our industry gets back on its feet." 
Failure ofsuch an effort would lead to protectionism, Reagan said. His issues adviser, Martin Anderson, explained that Reagan would try to negotiate a curb on the number ofJapanese cars imported. 
Before an enthusiastic crowd of 3,000 persons at the Uni­versity of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Anderson restated his oppostion to Carter's draft reg­istration plan and said there should be no discusson of sen­ding American forces to the Persian Gulf until ways have been found to reduce U.S. con­sumption of imported oil. 
"We ought to be willing to make the biggest effort here at home before sending young people to fight in the Persian Gulf," he said._

'Rocky' showing misunderstood 
Dear Editor, 
Brian Crouth (Sept. 1, P.O. Box Q) recently criticized the Notre Dame Student Union's supposed tacit support of the sexual mores and "degenerate" 
values ofthe movie "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." 
While I can agree with Mr. Crouth's statement that the movie was an "advocaton ofsex on a pure pleasure-orienta­ted...plateau", I would like to voice some opposition to his statements concerning the motives ofthe StudentUnion in showing the film. 
The showing of "Rocky Horror", or any other film for that matter does not imply the approval of the sponsoring body of the statements the film expresses. The Studexit Union provides (ostensibly) acts and speakers for the campus to consider intelligently, it is not invested with a mandate to force its opinion upon th

I was most disap-last year does not necessarily pointed therefore, to see in constitute the Student Union's Thursday's article a quote at-endorsement of his possibly 


Doonesbury 
dubious philosop y, and just as the reading Qf The Communist Manifesto and other Marxist works does not constitute University support of the "breakdown ofsociety" (to use Mr. Crouth's term, the showing of "Rocky Horror Picture Show" does not imply that the Student Union endorses (or denies support of) the mores and values the film represents. 
My conception of a univer­sity, Mr.. Crouth, is not of a place which "produces" stu­dents of any particular per­
 suasion (save that toward the 
love of learning), but of a 
community which exposes stu­dents to a variety of opinions and invites informed consi­deration of those opinions. 
In the terms of Mr. Crouth, the result of the sort of cen­sorship he seems to advocate would presumably be a "sick" (incapable of forming its own value judgements, or of func­tioning independently) rather than "healthy" mind. Whether "Rocky Horror" is or is not "smut" as Mr. Crouth states, is a moot point. The more impor­tant question raised (unwit­tingly perhaps) by Mr. Crouth is that of the extent to the Notre Dame Student Union feels it necessary to mold the thoughts of the student body through a movie selecton policy based upon the perceived danger to the virgin minds of the univer­sity. 
If the decadence to which Mr. Crouth objects is exposure to presumably adult and capable minds (and souls) to a variety of opinions and conceptions of 
reality, then I must be counted with those in the crowd at "Rocky Horror" who were chanting "Up With Deca­dence." More of that sort of decadence is needed here. I leave Crouth to another variety of smut, pre-digested opinions, conceptions of morality ac cepted without question, and unexamined maintenance of the status quo. Michael Case 713 St. Louis St.

Don't Forget to Wonder Why You're Here 


College students hve constantly 
under the threat of betrayal. It can 
come from any of us-teachers, 
administrators, rectors, fellow stu­
dents, campus ministers. 

It happens when one engages in the 
subtle conspiracy to hide the truth or 
to forget it. When the anivcrsity 
prostitutes herself and abdicates her 
principles in order to curry favor with 
benefactors. Or when the very edu­
cation offered does not intend to make 
better people but to stuff minds with 
facts. 

The great danger of college is that education will be seen (and designed) primarily as a preparation for making a living instead of a preparation for life. It can function for gain and not for growth. 
In many universities, .for example, the humanities don't humanize, they neutralize. Students are asked the wrong question ("When you graduate, what are you going todo?") whereas the real question is: "When you graduate, what are you going to be?" The chief concern should be what kind ofperson you will become. 
The temptation is to reward students for successfully acquiring information that will enable them to fit into our present system, with all its faults and superficiality, its consumer Pt-enzy and materialistic self-serving. This is the educational plague called "vocation­alism." It would have us train and not truly educate; itwould have us be more of a technical institute and not an authentic university; it prepares young women and men more for task than for life. 
"Vocationalism," to use the words of Fr. John Dunne, "is the danger of the limited goal. When a career becomes the goal, it is like seeing all the way to the end of one's life, but with most of life left out. This sort ofvocationalism . breeds tunnel vision ... and also un­happiness. As one pursues a limited goal, there comes a dissatisfaction with one's whole life." 
Another form of collegiate betrayal is "indoctrination." This educational perversion would have the school educate not humane and decent people but safe citizens-manageable ve>ters, manipulable consumers and, if 
~­

need be, in the case of war or crisis, willing killers. We have no shortage of examples of superb educational ma­chines, spectacularly effective in teaching students how NOT to in­terrupt the evil patterns that they see before them, how NOT to question and how NOT to doubt. 
Finally, schools betray students to the degree they foster a bloody co­mpetitiveness, which works against the goals of forming community­something that is meant to charac­terize higher education. Many students are now taught that they have to make it on their own and at the expense of others (who are trying to get into med school, for example). This competi­tive, non-cooperative education is defended as a means ofreadying young adults for "the real world," with its ungodly, dog-eat-dog competition over the scarce resources ofwealth and power. 
These ~re some of the challenges before us this year at Notre Dame. What, for example, is all our learning for if it is not to render service to persons? That is the criterion, after all, 
Snite to House University Art Treasures 
From the seemingly endless roar of 
construction presently on the Notre 
Dame campus, one particularly ex­
citing building is about to emerge in 
its finished state. 

Begun in October of 1978 with a 
projected cost of 3.7 million dollars, 
the Snite Museum ofArt is scheduled 
for dediction November 9. The 
gallery will rank sixth in exhibition 
size among university museums in 
the US presenting a 12,000 piece 
collection worth nearly five million 
dollars. 

This awesome display of art has 
been developing since the 1840's 
when Father Sorin began the col­
lection. Originally, the works were 
housed in the Notre Dame Archi­
tecture Building, and were moved to 
O'Shaughnessey Hall in 1966. There, 
space allowed for only one tenth of 
the collection to be shown. Con­
sequently, thirty percent of the art 
work to be exhibited in the Snite 
Museum will have never been pre­
viously displayed. 

Construction was initially funded 
by a two million dollar donation fron 
the Snite family ofChicago, longtime 
patrons of Notre Dame. The balance 
uf the 3.7 million dollar bill was paid 
by alumni donations. 

Physically, the Snite Museum has been as thoughtfully planned. The building is contemporary, yet simple enough to fit into the traditional atmosphere of the Notre Dame campus. Ambroise Richardson's straightforward architecture pro­vides the potential for changes needed to fit any new concepts in the future. Of the four levels in the structure, one consists solely of offices and conference rooms,while the remaining three boast dynamic art collections arranged chrono­logically. 
On :;he lower level, one will find the Ethnographic Art Gallery and the Victor Higgins Gallery of Western Art. Works ranging from 3500 B.C. to 1700 A.D. will be shown on the Snite Museum's ground floor; 
the Ancient and Medieval Gallery will 
b o ast ofthe atrium, across from that 
will be adisplay of the sixteenth and 
seventeenth century art.To complete 
the chronological sweep, the second 
level will house the Eighteenth and 
Nineteenth Century Gallery as well 
as the Beardsley Gallery ofTwentieth 
Century Art. 
The special features to be found in 
the Snite Museum are especially 
interesting, and broaden the scope 
ofthe new gallery beyond that of the 
traditonal art museum. The Print and 
Drawing Study room on the second 
level will be used for traveling ex­hibitions,collection display, small seminars, and individualstudy. The . reference library on the lower level 
will hold a collection of prints, 
etchings, drawings and photos, which 
will be exchanged with other uni­
versities -an added source of ar­
tistic wealth. On the same level,an 
auditorium that seats 300 will more 
than suffice for films, classes, and 
lectures, as its acoustics are out­
standing. 
It is not surprising that a project 
with such wideranging vision would 
have equally ambitious goals.The 
Snite Museum of Art is one striving 
for quality in its art collections, and 
its staff of eleven people work 
energetically toward this. The Di­
rector ofthe museum is Dean Porter, 
curator of the ND collection for the 
past eight years. Doug Bradley is the 
curator ofEthnograhics and Stephen 
Spiro is the curator ofthe general and 
European Art collectons. 
A Picasso, which is the museum's "pride and joy",along with other remarkable pieces, assures the Uni­versity a high quality, dynamic col­lection which hopefully will also benefit the surrounding community. Docent Tours, in accordance with the South Beqd Art Center and the museum's education coordinator, Linda H2.lley, are now setting up programs. Local schools may tour the museum, and children as young as the fifth grade will participate in some inquisitive exercises involving the art they observe. 

Dean Porter stresses that art is a 
challenge, and that its real beauty is 
that it can inspire "both sides o(the 
brain",the thinking and the sensual. 
Those involved with the Snite 
Museum of Art are anxious for 
people to "actively experience" the 
gallery, and to offer some feedback 
upon seeing,hearing, and feeling the riches within.

upon which ourfinal judgement will be 
based. The trouble with so many 
schools is that they indulge the nesting 
instinct by building very protected 
little communities inside the great 
walls. A truly educated person is one 
who has "matured into vulnerability," 
to useJames Forest's phrase; it is to be 
a person who refuses to erect walls that 
shut out other people. 
Notre Dame's challenge for your 
education is to afford, as an integral 
part ofyour education, the experience 
whereby your eyes will see and your 
ears will hear...what is everywhere 
around us: the cries ofthe poorand the 
oppressed, and to see and hear in such a 
way that you become vulnerable to 
them and their needs. 
Otherwise, an epigram ofBob Dylan 
will become frighteningly real: "The 
only difference between schools and 
old-age homes is that more people die 
in schools.' Wtth this entry, Fr. Toohey begin.r his 9th year ~s an Observer col­umnist. His latest book, LIFE AFTER BIRTH: Spirttuality for ();liege Students,

appreciation: "It couldn't happen 
elsewhere." "

Department ragesover dispute 
WASHINGTON (AP)-A burgeoning dispute over federal rules on bilingual education has brought the honeymoon for the new Department ofEducation to a rapid close. 
Less than four months into its existence, the agency has come under a barrage ofcriticism from major education groups for its attempt to spell out rules on how the nation's schools should teach children with limited or no ability to speak English. 
The rules hducation Secretary Shirley M. Aufstedler proposed Aug. 5 marked her first major into the regulatory field. 
twen before the Federal Reg­ister ink was dry, some education leaders were charging the de­partment was overstepping its bounds and trying to dictate to the schools how to teach. 
"The proposal is an unmiti­gated disaster. It threatens the fabric of American education and the future of our country," charged Albert Shanker, presi­dent of the American Federation of Teachers. 
Leaders of such groups as the National School Boards Asso­ciation, the Council of Chief State School Officers, and the national associations of elemen­tary and secondary school prin­cipals joined Shanker in a letter to Mrs. Aufstedler attacking any federal mandaJe to force schools to teach youngsters in their native language. 
The proposed federal rules stipulate that children who have a "primary language" other than hnglish and score below the 40th percentile on an English test must be taught required subjects in both English and their native language. 
Left open for public comment and a later decision was the question of whether students equally limited jn both English and their native language should be taught in both languages. 
Mrs. Aufstedler said more than 
3.5 million youngsters in America have limited English proficiency. Seventy percent are Hispanic. 
A subsequent analysis by her staff estimated that 1. 3 million would qualify for bilingual ed­ucation at a cost to the public schools of from $176 million to $592 million.

from AlA W Divsion III to Division II this season. 
Rich Hunter's soccer squad, which returns 15 letter­
winners from last year's team, opens its fall schedule at the 
University ofCincinnati. The Irish are hoping to avenge last 
year's 1-0 defeat at the hands ofthe Bearcats in the '79 season 
debut. 

Finally, the JV football team opens its three-game mini­
schedule on Sunday afternoon in West Lafayette against the 
junior Boilermakers. TheJV'ers were scheduled to open last 
Saturday against Triton but a rash of minor injuries forced 
cancellation of that initial test. 
Two other games remain on theJV slate following Purdue: a pair of contests against Michigan State, one on September 28 at Notre Dame and the other October 5 in bast Lansing.

My tick~t application?? 
-Uh. ·.. 
Before you ever again question the creative fiber of the Notre Dame student body, you should hear some ofthe "Gee, I'm sorry but-" excuses given for not sending in a student football ticket application last summer. Granted, some of them were pretty standard. For instance: 
brought it?" · 
-or 

"My dad thought it was junk mail so he threw it away." 
But some ofthem were real classics, like the 23­year old law student who apologetically explained that his "mom and dad forgot to send it in." Here are a few more of my favorites. 
"My dog ate the application." 
"Well, you see, it came at the same time as my record club 'selection ofthe month' and I couldn't afford both so I bought the record because I have to purchase eight more selections over the next three years or they'll throw me in jail." 
"I was a delegate to the Democratic National· Convention so I was in New York when it came." 
"My little sister ate the application." 
"When the application came, I hid it from my parents because I want them to think that all I do here is study. Then I couldn't remember where I hid it." 
"I looked at the home schedule and thought it was junk mail so I threw it away." 

"My little sister ate the applicaton and my dog ate my little sister." 
"It came at the same time as my tuition bill and I didn't think I should ask for any more money at the time." 
"I was in the hospital this summer and, when I looked at the return address on the envelope, I thought it was just a get well card from student accounts." 
"Oh, you mean I was supposed to send something back?" 
"I was a missionary in Zambia this summer and I did send it in. But the mail takes six months to get here so why don't you guys just give me my ticket now and you should get my check sometime after the first of the year." 
"I didn't have a stamp." "Well, I would have sent ft in but I had to go register for the draft that day." "Whatta ya mean we gotta pay for football tickets??!!" 

...KOegel 
(continued from page 12) 

Some may argue justifiably that the 6-foot-4, 194-pound senior has plenty of reason to be disenchanted with Notre Dame. He came in as one of the most highly touted recruits in the school's recent history, with one prep magazine dubbing him "the most "talented football player entering college this fall (1977)." 
The Cincinatti Moeller prod­uct led his squad to consecutive state titles in '75 and '76, and arrived in South Bend ready to step in and assume command of the Irish charges. 
No one was to forsee, how­ever, the career comebacks of Joe Montana and Rusty Lisch, comebacks that have thrown Tim Koegel's gridiron career into relative obscurity. 
But no matter how long and hard you search, you won't find this signal caller offering any complaints, or feeling any bit­terness for his three years as a backup. 
"There's always a lot of com­petition for the quarterback position but that's something I expected when I came to Notre Dame. Everyone wants to play, but there are always going to be some who can't. My attitude this year is to do whatever I can for the team and enjoy myself." 
It's this exceptional attitude that has earned Koegel the respect of coaches, players and fans alike-one that represents a 
refreshing  change  from  the  
comments  most  frequently  
heard from athletes.  

Quarterback coach Ron Toman echoes these sentiments in describing Koegel. "Tim's an excellent young man to work with," says Toman. "He's a good student of the game with a good head for offense. He's also a real perfectioni~t. He wants to play to the very best of his ability. Pressure doesn't bother him-he doesn't discourage easily unless he feels he's· done something wrong." 
Koegel's heralded rifling abil­ities are not apt to discourage him. He broke every high school passing record that existed at Moeller, impressed everyone as an Irish rookie when he became the first freshman quarterback since 1951 to thow a touchdown pass (a 31-yard strike against Georgia Tech) and has compiled the highest total passing yardage 
(293) of the three senior cand­idates. 
What's most likely to dis­courage the Notre Dame field general is his inability to elude the rush. Koegel himself readily admits that quickness is not his forte, although with the kind of line he stood behind at Moeller, he was never really forced to be adept at scrambling. Always the perfectionist, the Planner resi­dent is working hard to correct the one problem that has pre­vented him from nailing down the starting slot. 
"I just try to work on mas­tering my skills and on knowing and avoiding the different de­fenses," he says. "I know I'm not as quick as some ofthe others but I constantly try to work on that." 
Tim spent the entire summer in South Bend, taking classes and working out daily with some of his teamates. And while one would assume that the quarter­back race was foremost on his mind, Koegel chose to downplay the sweepstakes as much as possible. "You've got to remain somewhat objective and main­tain a kind of calm or it could really get to you," he noted. 
Koegel bo~sts the most play­ing experience of the seniors, seeing action in all11 games last season (often as kicker Chuck Male's holder) and starting a­gainst Purdue for an injured Rusty ~isch. But he does not allow himself to think for one minute that those facts should. automatically award him the starting position on Saturday, and expresses anything but re­sentment for the situation. 
"Whoever starts for us, I'll do whatever I can to help him out. There's no bitter rivalry between any ofthe quarterbacks. We'll all stand behind whoever it is, and if l can be ofany help to any ofthe quarterback's, I v:ill be." 
That's the kind ofcontribution you won't find in any record books, but one that's of im­measurable value to a team just the same. 
"He's very unselfish that way," remarked Toman. "He's been helping the younger quarter­backs since early this season ­he's just a good leader on the field." 
This season is Koegel's last chance to create some football legends of his own, yet he feels no more pressure this season than in previos ones and is determined to enjoy his final gridiron campaign. 
"I enjoy football now more than I. did as a freshman. When you first come in everyone's older than you and you're not real comfortable with the sys­tem. Now I feel familiar with the offenses and defenses and I know more about our game now than ever before." 
The American Studies major plans to enter law school next fall, possibly at Notre Dame, putting to rest any thoughts that he may have been disappointed with his life under the dome. 
"Notre Dame has lived up to my expectations. I'm happy here. I like it here, and the people I've met, the experiences I've had, everything about Notre Dame is bound to help me later in life. I couldn't have asked for a better education." 
Tim Koegel is a bigger success at Notre Dame that most people realize, and is quickly demon­strating that Irish quarterbacks cannot be judged by awards, statistics, and championships a­lone. 
McEnroe, Connors 
advance in Open 

J'\;bW YORK (AP)-Defen­ding champion John Mcbnroe beat Pascal Portes of France 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 yesterday to advance to the quarterfinals of the endur­ance test known as the U.S. Open tennis championships. 
"Considering how hot it was, I played quite a few solid games," saidMcbnroe. "Itwas something like 120 degrees out there and you definitely feel it. You get careless sometimes because of the heat, but I didn't let that happen too much today. 
In the featured night match, Jimmy Connors ousted South Africa's Bernie Mitton 7-6,6-4,6­4. 
McEm;oe, who is seeded sec­ond, was never in serious trouble in his match against the 21-year­old Portes.

Koegel n1akes ND work for him 
This is a five-part series analyzinfi each of Notre Dame's ft_ve leading quarter­backs. The order in which these features appear in no way reflects the position each occupies on the Irish depth chart. 
by Kelly Sullivan Women's Sports Edrtor 

Such Irish quarterback legends as Horning, Huarte, Hanratty, Clements and Montana have stablished a rigorous standard of measurement for judging the quality of their successors. Making an AllAmerican squad, setting numorous school rec­ords, winning college bowl games and appearing on mag­azine covers are common meas­uring sticks when evaluating a quarterback's performance. 
Senior Tim Koegel may be defining a new standard of quarterback measurement. Of course, Koegel has received his share ofawards, has rewritten his share of records, has won his share of championships and has been featured in a number of sports publications. 
But not at Notre Dame. 

By Irish standards Tim Koegel's career could be judged as unsuccessful. Yet this partic­ular young man is proving that judgement incorrect by estab­
. lishing a measuring stich of his own -one that extends beyond the boundaries of the football field, a criteria that would earn him the Reisman if the votes were cast for attitude.

Where were you? 
Remember back to August 15 

Where were you when the lights went out? 
Where were you August 15 around 9:30p.m (bOT) when the Notre Dame Stadium's, marquee, er, scoreboard-starring Dan Devine 
and  the  Fighting  Irish-flickered  and  then  
dimmed  in  anticipation  of  its  finale  as  a  
collegiate football troupe?  
In your favorite Friday night place?  

Or perhaps at home watching the Steelers do the expected, crushing their opponents? 
Or, heaven forbid, both? 

Had the blackout occurred last December, when there were bad reviews, rumors of the show's close by its backers (forced retirement) and thoughts ofa new director (or savior) in the air, would we have been surprised at the announcement made by the 55-year-old Devine on the ABC network? 
It's doubtful. 

But, over halfa year later, nearly everyone was shocked... not only at the announcement, but also at its. timing. 
The 1980 Irish football team assembled just prior to the announcement with no foresha­dowing of the resignation.. 
"It caught all ofus completely by surpr!k No one on the team hadany clue about rtat all When itcame wejust decided toput itaside and let everyone else worry about it. .We're just going to play the season, that's our goal"­Tom Gibbons 
"We had a team meeting after the press conference and we all decided wejust had to let itpass. We have this one year left with Coach Devine and the staff and it's gonna be a great year. Atthe time it happened, everyone thought it was kind ofa shock because ofthe timingfactor. That was the only shock, that we found out now instead of watting unttl maybe the last gam_e of the season. "­Steve Cichy

Beth Huffman 

Casting Director, C.S.C., studies the flood of applications and ponders auditions... but at least one company member feels the transition from old to new is not that big an issue. 
"You have to realize that Coach Devine announcing his resignation at a place like this is unusual At most universities it's common practice, they may go through coaching staffs every two or threeyears. But just because it happenedat Notre Dame, I think everyone has kindof overplayedit. The players at Notre Dame, at least I can speakfor myself, don't come here toplay for a headcoach. When they come to Notre Dame, they come to playfor Notre Dame. The coach is really secondary, and that's not toput Coach Devine down, but any coach, whoever it was. Most people come to play for Notre Dame, notfor any particular coach. I don't think that's rea//v true at many other institutions. You see how ~t other universities, they have a couple oflosing seasons in a row and they get rid of the coach. But winning is such a tradition at Notre Dame, that it overshadows the coach whoever it may be. "-Scott Zettek 
Only a choice few know all Devine's secrets behind the resignation but one can gather from talking to the coach thathis love for Notre Dame and his team is sincere, not play acted. A closing line from the mentor who will enter his· sixth season as the Irish coach on Saturday reveals how he will feel when the lights go out on that marquee for good. 
· ''I'm not walking away, my heart will always be with thts team. "-Dan Devine 
But the show must go on.

POLL CALL-Heading into this first weekend of the 
NCAA football season, most ofthe pre-season picksters, with 
one major exception, have tabbed the Irish in the top of the 
Second Ten. 
The nation's AP writers have chosen the Irish footballers 
11th in the country, while the UPI voting coaches rank the 
Irish 12th. Sport magazine tabs the Irish eighth among the big 
schools, while the highly-reputable Playboy poll picks Notre 
Dame as 11th (and the Southwesrern Conference cheer­
leaders tops). 
Street and Smith's college preview lists Devine's charges 
15th, while Sports Illustrated neglected to include the Irish in 
its Top Twenty. 
The Boilermakers are rated slightly ahead of the Irish in 
most polls, tapped 9th by the AP, lOth by UPI and 11th in 
Sports Illustrated. 
HbAD START-Saturday's season opener against 
Purdue will be the earliest opener for either school in its 
history. The Irish sport a 78-8-5 mark in season debuts (5 7-7­
3 at home), although they have lost their last two in Notre 
Dame Stadium (31-10 to Pittsburgh in 1976 and 3-0 to 
Missouri in 1978). 
Another omen for the gambler is the fact that Purdue has 
won more games in Notre Dame Stadium than any other 
team. The Boilers boast a 9-11 slate here since the Stadium 
was erected, although their last victory came in 1974 when 
Alex Agase's crew dumped Ara Parseghian's last Irish squad 
31-20. 
Nevertheless, the Irish hold a 31-18-2 edge in the all-time 
series with Purdue, which started in 1896 and has been 
contested annually since 1946. In fact, Notre Dame has won 
four of the last five battles and eight of the last ten games. 
WON'T YOU COME HOME SHILLELAGH-Since 
1957, the winner of the annual showdown between Purdue 
and Notre Dame takes home the Shillelagh. Donated byJoe 
McLaughlin, a merchant seaman and Irish fan who brought it 
here from Ireland, the travelling trophy is currently dotted 
with 23 gold footballs, heralding the victors of each 
Irish/Boiler clash since the award's inception. Notre'"Dame 
holds a one-football edge on the trophy. 
BOUNCING THE BIG TEN-Notre Dame enjoys an 
impressive 156-70-13 mark against Big Ten foes in its history. 
Dan Devine, once an assistant at Michigan State, owns a 
personal 21-4-1 record against that league, 11-3 under the 
"shadow" of the Dome. 
BROKAW'S BACK-Former Irish hardcourt standout 
Gary Brokaw has joined Digger Phelps' staff as a part-time 
assistant coach. The 197 3-74 All-American left Notre Dame 
before his senior year for the financial security of the NBA, 
having been tabbed by the Milwaukee Bucks in the first 
round of the 197 4 draft. 
Brokaw spent two years in Beer-town before being traded 
to Cheer-town (Cleveland, couldn't you guess?), averaging 
8.5 points in his four-year pro stint. 
"We're excited about having Gary back at Notre Dame," 
remarked Phelps. "His experience in the NBA will be an asset 
in many ways both on and off the court." 
While here, Brokaw will also work as an advisor and counselor in the Office of Minority Student Affairs. 
A LOT OF CLASS-The fact that Brokaw recently completed his requirements for a bachelor's degree from Notre Dame raised Phelps' off-the-floor coaching record to 100%. Every player that the basketball mentor has coached at Notre Dame has now graduated. 
The Notre Dame Athletic Department, its individual coaches and Academic Advisor Mike DeCicco should be congratulated for the impressive classroom record and graduation rate of Notre Dame student-athletes. 
In light of pending NCAA investigations for academic violations at Arizona State, USC and other member in­stitutions, Devine told a gathering of Notre Dame alumni this summer that, "I'm humiliakd and emarrassed as a football coach because of the things that are going on. 
"We've got some big problems in the 1980s. There may not be college football in the 1980s. They are making a farce ofwhat a university should stand for. The winning at any cost attitude has fostered drugs and phony transcripts. 
"It comes down to coaching ethics. The university must hire a coach with ethics and a president with ethics. "It's up to Notre Dame to lead the way1 to win the right way and show people it can be done." 
They already have. BALLS 0' FUN-Four other Notre Dame varsity teams open action this weekend. The women's tennis and field hockey teams inaugurate the new Irish athletic season on Saturday morning. Sharon Petro's court contingent hosts Indiana-Purdue University at Fort Wayne (that's IUPU-FW for you abbreviation addicts) at 8 a.m. on the Courtney Tennis Center courts. Rookie coachJan Galen will send her field hockey charges to Cartier Field at 11 a.m. for their season opener against Albion College. Both women's squads are making the move
