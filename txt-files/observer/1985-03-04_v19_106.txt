Anticipating tomorrow's campus elections for the three class offices, the candidates are concerned with campus social life, community ser­vice, and liturgical programs. 
Among the two tickets running for next year's senior class represen­tatives is that ofjohn Spatz, Pam Fox, Chris Hirschfeld, and Lori Griffith for the positions of president, vice­president, secretary, and treasurer, respectively. 
Speaking for his ticket, Spatz said, 


Gordon speaks on what it is like to be a Catholic writer 
By MARKS. PANKOWSKI 
News Staff 
"This reading and all readings tonight are dedicated to Kathleen Biddick and to the ideal offriendship between women that I hope will be allowed to grow on Notre Dame soil." So said author Mary Gordon after her first reading ofthe final ses­sion ofthe 1985 Sophomore Literary Festival. 
Biddick is an assistant professor of history at Notre Dame. 
According to Gordon, she and Biddick have been friends since childhood and have given "each other encouragement to be women ofaccomplishment." 
Gordon, the only child ofa Catho­lic family, characterized some of the drawbacks and benefits of being a Catholic writer. 
"American Catholicism is dominated by the Irish immigrant culture. It is not a culture that wants its people to have careers as artists. To the Irish, to tell about the family is to betray the family," site ex­plained. "But if you can get by that, it's a wonderful tradition. It's an unmined, closed community for ex­
ploration. In that way, (being a Cath­
olic) has been a great benefit 
because there's so much you can 
look into." 
According to Gordon, "People are 
very partisan about my writing. I've 
even received death threats from 
right-wing Catholics. People either 
think I'm betraying tradition or that 
I'm not telling them what the path to 
salvation is." 

Gordon, who said she decided to · become a writer because she "was 
not good at anything else," related to 
her audience the difficulty of being 
an author. 
"It's hard to be a writer. You have 
to have a notion of discipline. You 
have to make yourselfbelieve in the 
importance of what you're doing to 
make yourself do it. I have a special 
place that I go to every day, even if I 
don't feel like writing, to make 
myselfwrite for four hours." 
When described as being optimis­
tic, Gordon vehemently denied it. 
''I'm immensely pessimistic. I always 
expect the worse and I'm always 
ready to panic. Life is frightening. It's

"We plan to provide a lot of activi­ties so as to appeal to as large a percentage of the class as possible. 
"We expect to have a smooth transition into our administration since we have worked closely with the present administration." 
Running against the Spatz ticket is that ofEd Bornemann,Jamesjordan, Phil Poinsatte, andJohn Mihalovich. 
Mihalovich said that he and his running mates "plan to stress social service through such programs as the Neighborhood City Help.

In the Class of 1987, the incum­bentsJim Domagalski, David Miklos, 

Melissa Moody, and Michael Gregory are facing opposition from only one other ticket, that one a write-in. 
Domagalski commented, "We in­terpret this situation as a show of support for our administration cur­rently.

Willianl deVrtes stitched up a tiny hole in artificial heart patient Murray Haydon's right atrium on Saturday, stemming leakage that had begun Tuesday when start monitoring the plastic and metal heart were withdrawn, said Bob Irvine, director of public relations for Humana Inc. in Louisville, Ky. DeVries was "generally satisfied" with the operation, Irvine told reporters at an afternoon briefing yesterday. Barney Clark and William Schroeder, the first two human recipients of permanent artificial hearts, also suffered from internal bleeding problems. Doctors also suspected the wound was unahle to heal because blood-thinning medication administered against stroke. -AP 
A lone gunman shot to death Roman Catholic police Sergeant Hugh McCormac, 40, as he went to Mass yesterday at Ennis­killen, Northern Ireland, near the border with the Irish Republic, officials reported. McCormac was shot as he entered a monastery with his wife and their 16-year-old daughter and 1 5-year-old son. Witnesses said the killer opened fire with a pistol at point-blank range, then fired several more bullets into the sergeant as he lay bleeding on the ground beside his screaming family. -AP 
The subway mugger, that all-American symbol of crime beneath city streets, is now spreading fear through "metro" systems around the w~rld. An Associated Press check of cities on four continents found that some subway systems are almost crime­free because ofrelatively small size, limited times ofoperation, heav­ily middle·class ridership and new designs that make them easier to patrol. And sometimes, as in japan, because the society Is safe. When a Tokyo youth punched an elderly subway rider two months ago, he touched off a national furor. This breach ofJapanese decorum was described by police as the first "serious crime" in 1 0 years aboard Tokyo's jam-packed underground system. ·AP

Two satellites were removed from Challenger's cargo bay yesterday, including a possibly defective one that caused the cancellation ofthe space shuttle's planned Thursday launch from its Cape Canaveral site. The suspect payload, a NASA tracking and data relay satellite, will have to be modified because it is believed to have a timing problem in a system that encodes communications on Defense Department shuttle missions. The second satellite removed yesterday, a Canadian communications satellite, will be transferred

A gunman opened fire in a photography studio crowded with birthday party guests whose lavender and black dresses resembled the colors of a Hispanic street gang, killing one person and injuring two others, police said. The shooting on the Chicago's West Side occurred Saturday after two men walked into the Dieguez Studio, where about 30 people in two separate parties wer~ assembled for picture-taking sessions, said Chicago police Sgt. William Murray. One of the men opened fire into the crowd, killing the birthday girl's 14-year-old cousin, Carlos Romero. Wounded were two ofthe girl's uncles, James Bucio, 21, and Ramon Buclo, 27, who were both in fair condition Sunday at city hospitals, officials said. The gunman and his companion ran to an alley behind the studio after the shooting and fled in an older-model car, Murray said.

Those wbo forget the past are condemned to repeat it 
Those were heady days back in 1968. The air was full ofprotest talk, and the University did its best to hear the students out. 
But somehow it wasn't enough for those students. Their president was a long-hair, thin-tie and tennis­shoes leader whose loose tongue almost got him ousted. Those interested in campus politics divided themselves into political parties, and they often seemed to fight more among themselves than they did as a united effort against the administration. 
Within the first days of school, Student Body Presi­dent Richard Rossie gave an embittered address at ori­entation. Later, he spoke out strongly against the University's plan to put 63 "rule enforcing" prefects in the residence halls; Rossie said the hall councils had not been consulted and the dean ofstudents said the coun­cils had never asked. 
By the third week ofSeptember-only four weeks into the school year -Rossie had had enough. In a Jetter to the student body, Rossie let · his emotions get the best of him: 
"We can no longer accept 

Bob Vonderheide 
Editor-in-chief 
suggestions." 
Rossie understood that student government should tackle more issues than simply the anemic campus so­cial life. 
He was upset that the Vietnam-involved CIA was per­mitted to recruit on campus, and he brought the issue before the senate. A motion to prohibit CIA recruiters was quickly tabled, and an angry Rossie walked out of the meeting. 
The campus sentiment against the CIA-and also Dow Chemical, a maker ofnapalm -eventually led to a four-day sit-in at the Administration Building. Masses were cele· 
a Notre Dame in which the brated beneath the rotunda students are consistently and Rossie gave a few denied an effective voice," speeches. About SO students 
Rossie wrote. "Nor can we blocked the entrance to the be misled by face-saving placement office on the day half-measures insuring stu­of the CIA interviews, and dents 'participation' in im­the recruiter went home portant decisions. Too many dismayed. students live in alienation or Now in 1985, the goals indifference, too many stu­and vision of 1968 are gone, dents are restless and bitter. but the parallels are Ironic, A Something is wrong at Notre recent effort by freshman Ed Dame, something that can Funai tried to nullify the 

be solved only (by) a radical 
restructuring of this Univer­
sity." 
The letter got Rossie in 
trouble for a while. A group of"conservative" students­
mostly freshmen -wanted to oust him and obtained 
enough signatureson a petition to force a new election. 
Rossie survived, actually getting a larger percentage 
of the vote than he had gotten earlier that spring in the 
first election. Even if Rossie was a bit emotional, it 
seemed that he was the kind of leader the students 
wanted: aggressive and tough. 
Rossie and his 48-member senate were instrumental 
in starting the Student Life Council, a tripartite council 
of students, faculty and administrators empowered to 
write student-life policy. 
Even though Rossie called the SLC a half-measure in 
his letter, he listed it as one of his accomplishments 
during the re-call election campaign. 
And it was an accomplishment. As Observer colum­
nist Tim O'Meilia wrote: "Those eight students (on the 
SLC) will help shape University policy regarding stu­
dents, which is considerably more than merely offering 

pr······'R~~~~:~·-.i·~i;"·~ 
election of Bill Healy. The 
SLC has long since melted 
into the lethargic Campus 
Ufe Council, and student government now wants to know how it can better make its voice known. And the only other time students have protested in the Administration Building occurred last spring during the alcohol policy protest. 
But something is missing in 1985. There is no vision. There is no understanding of what has been tried before. For all their faults, at least the student leaders in 1968 seemed to understand the purpose of their gov­ernment. 
But now, as student government struggles to restructure itself, no one seems to know what the fuss is all about. No one can articulate why student govern· ment exists. 
So our student leaders will probably expand the num· ber ofsenators (to including one from each dorm), and they will probably want more from the CLC. And that's precisely the way it was 1 7 years ago. 
As Friedrich Hegel wrote in 1832: "What experience and history teach is this -governments have never learned anything from history or acted on principles deduced from it."

Peace With Justice Week to increase student awareness 
ByJOHN COYLE 
News Staff 
This week the Center for Social 
Concerns is sponsoring a "Peace 
With Justice Week" on the Notre 
Dame campus. 
The series ofevents is designed to increase student awareness of the problems ofpeace and justice. 
In 1983, the Association ofAmeri­can Colleges and Universities en­couraged its member institutions to mark the twentieth anniversary of the Pacem in Terris papal encyclical with symposiums, lectures and liturgies reflecting on that docu­ment. 
Concurrent with the anniversary of the papal encyclical, the Bishop's Peace Pastoral was released. Therefore the following year the ACCU stressed the idea of continu­ing to hold a week ofemphasis upon peace and justice every April. 
Last year, Peace withJustice Week events at Notre Dame were poorly attended. 
Scheduling late in the semester was cited as the main reason for poor student participation. 
The Network for Peace and Justice, the nationwide coalition of campus and community groups sponsoring the events, decided to move the week to earlier in the se­mester. 
The week officially began yester­day and will continue through Thursday. 
Yesterday, a Spanish Mass was said in Farley Hall and a prayer for peace was offered by University President Father Theodore Hesburgh before the Notre Dame/Washington men's basketball game. Many other events have also been planned, all in the Center for Social Concerns. 
The South African Crisis will be the subject of a talk given by Notre Dame Professor of Government and International Studies Dr. Peter Walshe on Wednesday afternoon at 12:15. 
Afterwards, Margaret Garvey, a member of the University Ministry staff, will give a talk on conscien­tious objection. 
Thursday afternoon, non-violence 
will be the topic of Manmohan 
Choudhuri's presentation at 12:10 
and the subject of military-tax resis­
tance will be addressed by Saint 
Mary's Associate Professor ofMathe­
matics Dr. Peter Smith at 4:30p.m. 
Also on Thursday, at 7 p.m., in the LaFortune little Theater, Notre Dame student Haider Raza will speak on Perspectives in Human Tyranny based on his experience of having a father who is a "prisoner of conscience" in Pakistan. 
The ND/SMC Students for the Freeze will sponsor a discussion on the issue of nuclear weapons on Tuesday at 7 p.m. 
Also, the World Hunger Coalition will sponsor a canned food drive Wednesday at the Marquette game. The film "The Business of America" will be shown Monday and Tuesday at 7 and 9 p.m. "The Silent Scream," a film depicting an abortion will be shown on Wednesday night at 9:30. 
According to the CSC and the Net­work for Peace and Justice, the Peace with Justice Week is a reminder that two years after the Bishop's Peace pastoral there is still much to learn and to do for the cause ofa just peace in our world.

He called the new graduate program "a significant step in the (architecture) school's continuing development." 
The undergraduate program will remain in its present form as a five­year course of study. With the ad­vanced program in place this fall, graduate assistants will be present in some undergraduate courses. 
Amico describes the current ar­chitecture faculty as "excellent." He believes they are sufficient in num­ber to handle both programs. He also expects to attract visiting pro­fessors "to enrich the program." 
The Architecture Building will be able to fulfill the needs of both pro­grams, according to Amico. Proposals are now under considera­tion to renovate a portion of the building for the use of the advanced program. The renovations are to be completed this summer.

Recruiting will begin this week as

across the country. 
Professor Robert Amico, chair­man of Notre Dame's School of Ar­chitecture, said the admissions board would be "looking for a broad section of students who are repre­sentative of the country and foreign nations." 
Amico expects the program will attract "a small, high quality group" of 15 to 16 students. 
The master's degree program will require 30-credit hours ofstudy that could be completed in one and a half years. Study in Rome .and Chicago will be available and would focus on architectual design. 
The establishment of the new graduate program will be celebrated in April when four of the five living recipit>nts of the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal will visit Notre Dame. 
The Gold Medalists, selected by virtue of their distinctive contribu­tions to the profession, will also par­ticipate in a symposium and an academic convocation, where they will receive honorary doctor of fine arts degrees. 
The gift made by Bond will es­tablish the Montedonico Fellow­ship, which will generate Bond Fellowships to be used by eligible students in the graduate program. 
The realization of the master's degree program in the School of Ar­chitecture ends a process begun by Amico when he arrived at Notre Dame in 1977. The petition for graduate work in architecture was fi. nally approved by the Graduate Studies Committee this year.

Preventive measures prompted by outbreak 
ByJOHN SOUTER 
News Staff 
A recent outbreak of measles on college campuses has prompted the Notre Dame Student Health Center to take preventative measures. 
Carol Seager, director of health services, last week Issued an on­campus bulletin stating, "As a preventive measure, all Notre Dame students who have not received a measles Immunization since 1969 must do so. Any students requiring immunizatlons must contact the stu­dent health center to make arrange­ments for innoculation." 
Seager would like students to check their immunization records. This can be done by checking with Infirmary records. 
If a student has the slightest suspicion they are coming down with the measles they should go to the Infirmary for an examination, ac­cording to Seager. 
"It is very important for students not to diagnose themselves. The 

Election

"We expect to have council rep­
resentatives to increase the input 
and feedback on our projects be­
cause we want to know if they have 
been successful or not." 
Also running for the sophomore 
class leadership is the ticket of Tim 
Malone, Patti Tripathi, Kary 
O'Connell, and Tom Crowe. 
Tripathl outlined the party's plat­
form emphasizing their desire to 
"get a representative from each 
dorm to alleviate complaints. 
"We feel that we will work the 
hardest of the many tickets because 
we represent the entire campus." 
Malone added, "We will work for 
the students and with them." 
Ted Smith and his running mates 
Brian Holst, Julie Flaherty, and Vince 
Willis hope for "increased involve­
ment. We want to have speakers 
from various businesses to address 
the class and help them make career 
choices. 
"Because we see academics as 
very important, we want to establish 
an academic council to review the 
curricula." 
Ofthe six-ticket ballot, Smith said, 
"Nobody will win on Tuesday. A 
run-off will be necessary..." 
The final ticket vying for the lead­
ership of the Class of 1988 is that of 
Tom Tracy, Molly Shannon, Jerry 
Krimbill, and Katie Pampel. 
Tracy, the party's presidential 
candidate, said, "Our big thing is the 
social life. 
"We want to have hall rep's and 
more off-campus activities because 
ofthe problem of the alcohol policy. ..e would also like to have service I"'Ograms such as tutoring for local ldds." 
In the race for off-campus com­missioner, Tracy 'Race' Thoman is seeking re-election. 
"I am currently the O.C. commis­sioner and I am the only one of the three candidates who lives off­campus right now. I have the experi­ence having served as liturgical commissioner and having run other events such as our formals and fund­raisers. I hope to have a more structured O.C. government next year, getting things more together than they are now," said Thoman. 
The other two off-campus candi­dates, Tom 'Beaver' McDonald and Kevin Howard, could not be reached for comment. 
doctors will check you out," cau­
tioned Seager. 
Seager stressed that the im­
munizations would be provided at 
no cost. 
"For many students the cost ofthe immunization is a big factor. Stu­dents should know the State Health Department is providing the service free to the students." 
Seager did not know if the service would be provided at the infirmary or a nearby location. 
Measles, a highly contagious virus with flu-like symptoms, can be trans­mitted by almost any kind of con­tact. Because of close living arrangements, residence halls pro­vide ample opportunity for measles to spread. 
There are two kinds of measles, Rubella (three-day or German measles) and Rubeola (hard measles). 
Complications may arise if measles are not treated. The virus lowers the resistance of the patient to secondary infections. 
Two students from Principia Col­lege in southern Illinois died from complications arising from measles because they failed to get treatment.

For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under the sky: a time to study, and a time to relax (that is to say, a time to break down, and a time to build up); a time to write a paper, and a time to tear it apart; a time for an A, and a time for a F; a time for freshman year, and a time for senior year and com­mencement speakers; a time for winning a championship, and a time for losing it; a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance. 
But is there any thing of which it is said, "See, this is new?" A generation goes, and a 

generation comes, but Father Hesburgh 
remains forever. 

Commencement speakers come from the 
South, and may eventually come from Rome, 
but doubt is cast upon them all. 
When summer goes, and winter comes, so do the complaints about unsafe walkways. Hungry ones in Africa and downtown South Bend, and satiated ones on the Notre Dame campus, yet the cook is always the first to be blamed. Vanity ofvanities! 
All is vanity. We have all plied our minds to know wisdom and madness and folly. And some ofyou· but not all· perceive this is to be striving after wind. 
You said to yourselves, "Corne now, we will enjoy ourselves at the game." But behold, this also was vanity, for Sister said ofyour laughter, "It is mad," and ofyour pleasure, "What use is it?" 
Once graduated you will build skyscrapers (where land ·prices are high) and plant vast orchards (where land prices are low). You will make unto yourselves private gardens and parks with pools therein to water the grass and trees. You will have any number of cars and homes (more than any before you). And

I have always been in awe of those individ· uals on television commercials who hold credit cards. 
It seems only fitting to idolize those who hold the infamous "gold" cards which allow them to purchase scuba gear in Aruba. The

world is at their fingertips, and those twelve little numbers cause even the most sure­footed of store clerks to tremble. Not being one to miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime, I soon applied for mine. 
I remember the day so well. It was a fairly cold and blustery morning when I made my daily trek to the mailbox. I looked inside and noticed a fairly fat white envelope. At first, it appeared like a Carnpusnet bill, but I was soon to be overcome by surprise. For the little protrusion from the envelope was my new VISA card. 
Truly, this day was to go down in history. Not to be outdone by some paid actor in a commercial, I immediately proceeded to take my card on a tour and "break it in." 
I literally flew from one store to the next as the stack of packages at my side began to amass into a UPS man's nightmare. Why worry when it was such fun to say,''Charge it."? 
By the time I was through, I had put several store clerks through graduate school and my card was hotter than Mount St. Helens. 
One month later, however, the honeymoon was over. I had so many little slips of carbon ing became more rapid. My pupils began to dilate. My hands, to shake. 

For those who have never had a credit card in your sweaty little palms, you cannot sym­pathize with me. You do not know the smug satisfaction ofcorning up with more than two forms of identification. You do not know the physiological pleasure received while waiting for a clerk to call in your number for a secJJrity check. It is almost like being in Las Vegas. What is more, you do not know the true meaning of"sirnple monthly payments." 
I have always laughed at those who think the budget deficit is the most pressing matter of the economy. Me and others like me have managed to amass a private debt ofmore than S1.7 trillion. Compared to that, the deficit looks like kid stuff. When the American private debt is added to what the world in gen­eral owes, the figure inflates to even more drastic heights. 
Sure, credit is good. It promotes spending that might not ordinarily occur, but be realis­tic. One needs to draw the line somewhere. This is especially true when one realizes that most of these purchases were not really nec­essary in the first place. Slow down. Wait a while longer for that new VCR. Leave horne without American Express. You might find out that "cash and carry" was created for a rea­son. 
I still admire those people on television commercials, but I am beginning to have my doubts. It seems that living beyond your income consistently will result in a few prob­lems. Certainly Mexico and Brazil are good examples of what can happen when debtors can no longer pay their debts. We all lose so you will become great and surpass all, past and present. And your scholarly wisdom which Notre Dame bestowed upon you remains with you all your life. 
And whatever your inner eyes desire you will set out to create. You will keep your hearts from no pleasure, for your heart will find pleasure in all your toil, just as it was with the Class of 1984, and it was their reward. 
But then, when they grew older, they con­sidered all their hands had done and the toil they had spent in doing it, and beheld, all was vanity and a striving after wind. So they turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly, for what can the Class of '85 do? Only what the Class of'84 has done already. The '84s said to themselves, "What befalls the fools also befalls us; why then have we been so very wise? How the wise die just like the fools!" 
So they hated life and all their toiling under the sun, seeing that they must leave it to the Class of'85. And who knows whether you will be wise men or fools? Yet, you the '85~s will be master ofall for which the '84s toiled and used their wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity. 
The '84s turned about and despaired over all the toil oftheir labor, because sometimes a man who has toiled with wisdom and knowl­edge and skill must leave all to be enjoyed by the Class of '85 which did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil. 
What did they have from all their toil and strain under the dome, the golden and the 
.. 
secular one? All their days were full of pain, and their work was a vexation; even at night 
.. 
their minds did not rest. This also is vanity. .. 
And so they say to you, the Class of '85: There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and find enjoyment in his toil. Better is a handful of quietness than two hands full of toil and a striving after wind. 
Some such quietness now let us practice, for you have already heard my speech (as countless others have before you over the last ~ few thousand years) and there is nothing new therein.

Iwo Jima was a battle well worth the s~ruggle 
Dear Editor: 
It seems that Mr. Neblo neglected to do some basic research prior to writing his column of Feb. 26., relying more upon film footage of James Garner and Julie Andrews than upon history. 
IwoJirna is a small volcanic island 750 miles southeast ofToyko as Neblo asserts. However, when Neblo goes further to suggest that it is a "worthless chunk of volcanic ash," he reveals his profound ignorance ofthe subject at hand. Iwo Jirna provided the U.S. Navy with an air­altruism. Cowardice only serves to preserve the skin of the coward while leading to the further suffering ofothers. 
John Stuart Mill wrote that war is a terrible thing, but also that a more terrible thing existed: the poverty ofspirit that drives some to think that nothing is worth fighting for. 
Weaker people enjoy their freedom be· cause stronger people are willing to sacrifice their lives to preserve that freedom. Neblo's gratitude to the Americans who fought in America's wars is not unwarranted. He should admire their courage and selflessness that left so many of them behind on small islands like IwoJirna.

Movie review ~~~~ 
I 
Hollywood seems to hate the 
youth oftoday. Although its 
target audience is becoming 
predominately under 20, Holly­
wood filmmakers continue to 
depict teens as mindless, 
sexually-oriented fools whose 
thoughts go no farther than their 
precocious classmates ofthe 
opposite sex. 
But not all filmmakers hate the 
teen population. In defense of 
today's youth comes 
writer/directorJohn Hughes, 
who firmly believes that kids 
today have personalities worth 
exploring. 
His latest effort in eliminating the prejudice against teens is "The Breakfast Club." This film directly attacks common stereotypes that teens today labor under, by at first appearing to assert them and then thoroughly eliminating them. 
Anthony Michael Hall, from Hughes' earlier film "Sixteen Candles," introduces the rum by identifying each character with what adults would accept as suitable categories. We are intro­duced to "the brain" (Hall), "the beauty," "the athlete," "the cri­minal" and "the basket-case." They meet for Saturday deten­tion in their school library, and the film concentrates on their getting to know each other and establishing themselves as com­plex individuals. 
The first half ofthe rum is dominated by "the criminal," played by Judd Nelson with power and charisma. He's a teen that rejects all authority, all insti· tutions, and all his fellow stu­dents. He mocks everything eloquently and effectively. The product ofabusive parents, he cares nothing for the institution that educates him, expressing himselfin almost artistic displays ofanger and violence. 

Towards the middle ofthe rum, the emphasis switches from Nelson's character to the others, and we soon learn that most of them have problems similar to Nelson's, victims ofparental abuse or apathy. 
The ready classification ofthe character played by Anthony Michael Hall as "the brain; causes this character to con­template suicide. He's the victim oftoo much parental pressure. His main problem, the fact that he received an "F' in a shop project, may seem Light when compared to the cigar burns on Nelson's arm, but his failure almost kills him. A foil for him is "the athlete," played by Emilio Estevez, also the victim ofparen­tal overdrive. His family is so obsessed with his winning that he wishes to be physically injured to relieve him ofthe pressure. 
The final victim ofpoor parenting is "the basket-case," enthusiastically portrayed by Ally Sheedy. This character has trouble dealing with others. At first, she ignores her fellow captives, but as she gradually begins to speak, she cloaks her personality in a string oflies. One ofthe only true statements she makes is that her parents ignore her. 
The fifth character is "the beauty," played by Molly Ringwald, who also appeared in "Sixteen Candles." This charac­ter does not complain ofapat­hetic or overbearing parents; she complains about her friends and 
how they control her life. She is 
a slave to their opinions, at one 
point even threatening to reject 
the friendship ofthe others to 
protect her image. 
Ringwald's character is impor­tant in that it saves the rum from falling from one set of stereotypes to another. Aside from her, all ofthe characters are innocent victims ofrotten parents. The fact that she's pres­sured by peers, and not parents, seems to be a deliberate attempt by Hughes to broaden the rum, . to acknowledge the fact that parents are not the sole in­fluences on the lives ofteens. And he succeeds. 
Another device to make the rum less predictable is the stormy relations between the five. They argue, they mock each other and at times they hate each other. Thus adults and teens are not drawn into oppos­ing sides. These people must learn how to relate to each other, as well as adults. 
Unfortunately, the rum tends to be melodramatic. Personality disorders are overblown. For example, it's hard to believe that an "F' in shop would lead Hall's character to contemplate suicide. And instead ofmerely telling the others about his troubled home Life, Nelson's character acts out a typical home scene, thereby overstating his point. 
The movie is generally well­acted, though. The characters are three-dimensional and are played as such. It's about time that Hollywood's prejudice against teens today was attacked in film, and Hughes does so ef­fectively. The film is wonderfully entertaining, with a short but interesting dance sequence and absorbing dialogue. The film succeeds both as a statement against common youth stereotypes and as a fun rum.

Book review 
In his newest book, "Murder On High," George Kennedy weaves a suspenseful tale involv­ing an oil-rich nation in the Middle East, a wounded Arab sheik, movie stars, and a mur­derer. Although it is a novel, it does reflect some aspects of current world affairs, thus making the story more dramatic and believable. 

In the Arabian country of Qram, Qram's ruler, Prince Ibrahim, who is on the set of Kennedy's (yes, he is in his own novel) movie "Airport: Middle East," is critically wounded in an assassination attempt. For reasons ofsafety, it is decided that Prince Ibrahim must be flown as quickly as possible to a hospital he owns in Los Angeles. The only way for the rum crew to leave the country is to go along with the prince in his private plane. Also important is tpe presence ofsuch rum stars as Jimmy Stewart, Bobby Troup, andJulie London. 
Kennedy develops the suspense in the major portion of the novel, which takes place on the sheik's plane. Although all the passengers expect a normal flight, anything.but this happens · for, one by one, the passengers are being murdered. 
The situation becomes more frightful when it is found out that the plane cannot land be­cause a stop-over would endanger the sheik's life. High stakes are involved in Prince Ibrahim's fate, for it is in the United States' interest that he survives. His death woflld cause turmoil in the Middle East, espe­cially since his would-be succes­sor abhors Western standards. Here, Kennedy adeptly adds touches ofrealism to his novel. 
It is up to Mike Corby, cop­turned-actor, to find the killer. Things are becoming more and more panicky on the plane, and there doesn't seem to be any clues as to who will be the next victim. Furthermore, there does not seem to be any connection between the murders and the prince. As the film stars have almost as much celebrity as the prince, Corby's search becomes doubly difficult. The action builds up as Corby checks into the passengers' background to find leads, and consequently unearths intriguing details about their personal lives. 
When the plane finally reaches its destination, the mur­derer and motive are revealed, but the story does not end after the plane trip. Mike Corby still feels that the clues don't fit all the details, and pursues the case further; what he eventually dis­covers makes for a surprising. and satisfying climax. Kennedy, instead ofgoing for an easier ending, creates a more exciting conclusion that gives this thriller ofa novel the "big bang" its harrowing plot deserves.

EVANSTON, Ill.-The Notre Dame men's fencing team took another step toward the national champion­ship over the weekend as the Irish qualified a maximum number of six fencers for the NCAA tournament and captured their second straight Great Lakes Championship. 
In the ACC on Saturday, the Irish hosted and won the 19th annual Great Lakes Championship tourna­ment by out fencing the Wayne State Tartans 192-187 while accumulat­ing gold medals in men's and wo­


men's foil. 
Sunday, the Irish traveled to Evanston, where they rounded out their entry in the men's NCAA fen­cing finals by placing all five oftheir fencers among the top in each ofthe three weapons. With this result, Notre Dame will be able to enter the NCAA tourney at full strength. 
"The team that will have a full complement in the the finals cer­tainly has an infinately better chance of accumulating enough points to win it," said Irish Head Coach Mike DeCicco. "Right now, I would say, on the basis ofthe people that we're talking about, that Notre Dame has a shot at the final four or five spots in

the country. How well we do, however, depends upon how well we do that day." 
En route to their seventh Great Lakes Championship as a team, the Irish were lead by outstanding per­formances on the part ofsophomore foilist Charles Higgs-Coulthard and freshman foilist Molly Sullivan. 
Higgs-Coulthard, the defending national champion in the foil, out­lasted Wayne State's Stephan Chauvel in a fence-off by a 5-4 mar­gin and gained an automatic berth in the NCAAs with a nice 18-1 record. 
"Charles won the hard way after opening up with a loss to Mike Van­derVelden," said DeCicco. "The pressure was on him in the last bout to beat Chauvel, which he did 5-4, and again in a fence-offwhich he also won, 5-4. 
"This shows me an awful lot about his tenacity," continued DeCicco. "He just hung in there until the job that he had to get done got done." 
In women's foil, the best perfor­mance ofthe day, and perhaps ofthe year, came from the foil of Sullivan. The freshman, after going 43-4 on the year, turned in a perfect 20-0 mark against the best ofthe Midwest on her way to her first-ever Great Lakes gold. 
"I have never had a fencer who 
dominated a tournament like Molly 
did," said DeCicco. "For Molly to 
win 20 bouts-and have only 10 
touches scored against her in those 
20 bouts is to me pretty amazing. 
That was the best single perfor­
mance that I've ever seen in that 
gym." 
In the men's epee, defending na­
tional champion Ettore Bianchi of 
Wayne State took the medal with an 
impressive 14-0 mark on the day. 
In the sabre division, Giovanni Girotto outlasted Notre Dame juniors Don Johnson ( 13-2) and John Edwards ( 14-1) to take the medal and qualify for the NCAAs with a 13-2 mark. 
While the Irish were only able to 
seed one fencer through the Great Lakes tourney, they were, neverthe­less, able to realize their goal for the weekend and round out their cham­pionship entry at Northwestern yes­terday. 
Leading the way with strong performances were Johnson and Ed­wards in the sabre. The two finished first and second, respectively, and will provide the Irish with a solid entry without the services ofsenior captain Mike Janis. Janis had the fourth best Great Lakes record in the weapon but did not advance due to team limitations after going 42-3 on the season. 
"We had to make a decision of who to go with so I made a decision to go with Don and John because they, with Girotto, had in the fence­off," said DeCicco. 
In the epee, senior captain Andy Quaroni and junior Christian Scherpe finished third and fourth in Wildcat country. Quaroni went 8-7 'on Saturday to advance while Scherpe recorded a solid 12-3 mark, second only to Bianchi. 
Despite the poorscheduling, both Notre Dame and defending national champion Wayne State were able to qualify six men fencers and will now take their challenges up against the Eastern schools at the NCAA tourna­ment to be hosted by Notre Dame over spring break. 
sticking him with good jabs. Mean­while, Sassano showed some good punching power in his unanimous decsion triumph over John Rademacher. While Sassano knocked out Rademacher's mouth­piece six times, he couldn't put away the big senior who proved he could take 1 punch.

Irish look like a tournament team 

Phil Wolf 
Assistant Sports Editor 
"I said, 'You're playing a first-round game against an NCAA team at home.' That's how we approached the game, and that's how we went after it." 
That's how Digger Phelps described his team's motivation in yesterday's 57-50 victory over Wash­ington. Ofcourse, it wasn't a tournament game, and Notre Dame isn't even guaranteed a berth in the tournament yet, but the Irish played like a tournament-bound team. 
A tournament-bound team? With 27 percent shooting in the first half? With the team's leading scorer getting only six points? With a seven-minute scoreless streak in the second half? 
Sure, Washington coach Marv Harshman said: "They're a logical choice." 
Yes, we all saw the same game yesterday.lt is quite true that the Irish played poorly to start the game and some players had bad games, and that is not what makes an NCAA tournament team. But Notre Dame did something a tournament team must do: it hung on until the end. 
"When we kept mixing defenses, I just thought sooner or later we can't keep playing as bad as we're playing," Phelps said. "We weren't playing well at all, and it was just sooner or later..." 
It turned out to be later in the first half, when jim Dolan's free throws tied the game at 22 and a hus­tling Irish defense created several turnovers at the other end. Donald Royal powered inside and helped Notre Dame to a three-point halftime lead. 
From that point, the Irish looked like a tourna­ment team. They didn't quit. They didn't allow the Huskies to get the lead again. After so many times this season when the Irish failed to bury a team once they got ahead, they showed that they are capable of finishing well. 
Notre Dame was able to maintain its lead the way a good team docs: by holding the ball, making free 
throws and not committing stupid fouls. You know, 
the kind that allow a team to get back into the game. 
"We've been doing that pretty good, lately," 
Phelps joked. "With the lead, fouling the other team 
so they can shoot one and one. So I told them to foul 
today, and the guys didn't foul." 
Another thing the Irish were good at yesterday 
was coveringfor each other. Acouple players had off 
days, but there were others there to fill the impor­
tant roles. 
"I thought Kenny (Barlow) had another bad 
game," Phelps said, "but so what? The other guys 
came through." 
Matt Beeuwsaert and Gary Voce came off the bench in the first half to give Barlow and Dolan a rest, and Notre Dame's level ofplay did not suffer for it. Starters Kempton and Royal picked up the slack for Barlow, and late in the game, Kempton came in for Dolan to grab four key rebounds and hit some free throws. Dan Duff also came in late in the game to play his role: holding the ball and hitting free­throws. 
Good defense, everyone playing his role, a strong finish. These are the characteristics of an NCAA tournament team. 
Especially finishing strongly. For a long time it seemed the Irish were not capable of playing well down the stretch in a game. And much of the time, they were in close games where finishing well was vital. 
"We have a tendency to start out slow sometimes," David Rivers observed yesterday. "After a while, though, we start to get in a groove and things start to go well for us." 
So if things are starting to go well for the Irish, does that mean they can have a strong finish to the season? If everyone continues to play his role they can. 
"It's late in the season right now," Barlow pointed out, "and the guys realize what they have to do down the stretch." 
Yes, the guys know what they have to do. They know what they're shooting for: the NCAA tourna­ment. And ifthey fall short; ifthey go to the NIT; how would that feel? 
"Very depressing," Rivers says.

for most ofthe first half, leading by as 
many as seven points, but Notre 
Dame managed to stay close despite 
shooting a dismal 2H percent from 
the field and getting no points from 
leading-scorer Ken Barlow. 
In the final minute of the first half, 
with the Huskks on top, 26-24, 
Royal laid in the follow of a Rivers 
miss and was fouled by Paul Fortier. 
Royal finished off the three-point 
play, and gave Notre Dame a 27-26 
lead. As it turned out, the Irish never 
trailed again. 
"Today we just got off to a slow start, but as time went on we got into our rhythm and some shots started to fall for us," said Rivers. "After the first half, we felt that it was going to come around, because we were playing poorly and yet we were still in the game. When we were up at halftime without playing that well, we thought that things would go well in the second half for us." 
Defensively, things did go well for 
the Irish, well enough that they were 
able to overcome a scoreless 
drought ofoverseven minutes in the 
second half. The Huskies managed 
only six points over that span, and 
Notre Dame recovered to hold off a 
late Washington rally with four Dan 
Duff free throws. 
"I thought our defense really worked well," said Phelps. "Washington was playing very well, and they had to have a letdown, whereas we weren't playing well at all, and our defense did it for us. And that's what I told our players, that if we're having trouble with shooting percentages, then we've got to win with defense. And I thought what won the game for us was our defense." 
And what of the latest offensive woes for Notre Dame, a team that has hit less than 50 percent of its shots from the field in each ofits last three games? 
"I think we're getting good shot position," said Phelps. "It's just that we're not shooting the ball well. But in this game we just stayed with it. Our defense helped us out, espe­cially in the end ofthe first half when we went to the zone and Washing­ton hit just one of seven shots. That allowed us to do the things that we had to do to score the points and go up at halftime." 
With key games coming up against Marquette and Dayton, however, the Irish will need an of­fense that can stand on its own two feet.

Dame accomplished both of these goals, as Royal, Tim Kempton, and Jim Dolan turned in solid defensive performances against Washington's 6-9 Detlef Schrempf and 7-0 Chris Welp. Schrempf finished with 18 points and Welp had 16, but neither inflicted the type of damage of which they are capable.

"I think the fact that he only had 1 2 shots, whereas he's capable of having 20 or 22 shots, is something we caused by ex­tending our defense. We felt that that was the key for us defensively. Worrying about both the big men, Welp and Schrempf, was tough, and I thought we also did an excellent job ofcontrolling their other players on the floor."
