Philippine rebels suffer setbacks, vow to fight 

MANILA, Philippines (AP) -Rebel soldiers battled government troops last Monday in Manila's financial district as forces loyal to President Corazon /.quino moved against mutinous hold­outs in the fourth day of the attempted coup. 
On Sunday, more than 600 rebels sur­rendered after government units re­pulsed a fierce assault on the armed forces headquarters at Camp Aguinaldo. Government officials said the battle dealt a fatal blow to the uprising. . 
About 400 rebels also held the Mactan Air Base in Cebu, 350 miles south of Manila. Officials said they expected the Mactan rebels to surrender Monday. 
At sunrise Monday, rebel snipers hid­ing in skyscrapers in the Makati finan­cial district of Manila began firing at soldiers who approached their build­ings. 
One fireman was grazed by a bullet, and the van of a Manila radio station was hit by gunfire. 
Mutineers fired at a helicopter carry­ing Brig. Gen. Loven Abadia, comman­der of the 205th Helicopter Wing, as it flew over Makati en route to central Lu­zon. Bullets ripped through the aircraft, wounding the pilot in the shoulder, but he was able to return to the Villamor air base and land the helicopter safely, the military reported. 
The mayor of Makati, part of metropolitan Manila, appealed to the rehels to surrender. 
"This thing is over," Mayor Jejomar Binay said in a message sent to rebel leaders. "The best thing for your men is to lay down their arms." 
However,.one rebel leader, who gave his name as "Col. Galvez," told a re­porter late Sunday: "We will continue to fight until we get our political objective" -the resignation of Aquino. 
Elsewhere, Manila was returning to normal, with government and private sector employees reporting for work. 
Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said Sunday the government had crushed the 
,. attempted coup. Aquino ruled out a cease-fire in a nationwide television broadcast and vowed: "What they started, we will finish." However, junior and middle-grade of­ficers in several provincial commands declared their support for the rebellion, which began Friday. Aquino, facing her sixth coup attempt since coming to power four years ago, rejected suggestions bv Cabinet mem­bers that she declare a "state of siege," according to assistant Press Secretary Lourdes Sytangco. That would be tanta­mount to martial law. At least 56 people have been killed and more than 500 wounded since Fri­day, according to hospital and Red Cross figures. More than 10,000 people fled their homes to escape the fighting and were housed in schools, churches and other

Malta summit ends, no major agreements 
MAHSAXLOKK BAY, Malta (AP) -President Bush and So­viet President Mikhail Gor­bachev left their weatherblown summit talks offering visions of a dawning era of lasting peace, with the remnants of the Cold War giving way to a better world. 
ThPy announced no break­throughs Sunday on issues that divide their countries, such as Central America and naval dis­armament, but said that was not the point of their open­agenda dockside encountNs. 
In their parting remarks, both chose to emphasize mu­tual aspirations. 
"We sought the answer to the question where we stand now," Gorbachev told reporters. "Many things that were charac­teristic of the Cold War should be abandoned ... the arms race. 
mistrust, psychological and ideological struggle and all that. All that should be things of the past." 
Trading relaxed banter at the first-ever joint news conference of Soviet and U.S. presidents, Bush and Gorbachev repeatedly echoed each other's words as they described their talks and their hopes for the future. 
"I couldn't have asked for a better result out of this non­summit summit," Bush said. "It was a no-agenda meeting and yet it was a meeting where were discussed, as the chairman said, many, many subjects. So I think if a meeting can improve relations, I think this one has." 
The next chance comes in June, when a full-scale Bush­Gorbachev summit is scheduled

Entire East German communist party leadership resigns 
EAST BEHLIN (AP) -With public resentment against the ruling Commu11ists reaching a fever pitch, the party's entire leadership has resigned in dis­grace and asked a committee of 25 reformers to salvage what they can. 
Just two months ago, the party's hierarchy enforced iron-fisted rule. Now, the former ruling elite has its back against the wall as demands grow for punishment of those who Jived in style while East Germany sunk into crisis. 
Arrests and expulsions from the party have humbled top of­ficials, but the most dramatic and potentially dangerous step was the mass resignation Sun­day of party leader Egon Krenz, the 10-man Politburo and 163-member Central Committee. 
Erich Honecker, Krenz's pre­decessor as party leader, and 11 other members of the hard­line old guard were expelled from the party, three former Politburo members were ar­rested and the country's chief of trade with the West fled. 
Authorities are investigating allegations of massive corrup­tion. 
"The grass roots are in re­volt," commented West Ger­many's ARD television network. It said Sunday's unprecedented changes leave the party "without a head." 
A spokesman for the new party committee, Gregor Gysi, said its immediate task would be to investigate corruption among the discredited Com­munist elite. 
"We want to form a modern socialist party guided by the rank and file. We want to save this country. We want to save soc.ialism," said Gysi, a promi­nent East Berlin lawyer. 
The committee, given the mandate of trying to save the party, will effectively rule as the party prepares for a special congress on Dec. 15 when it is expected to choose new leaders. 
The party that has ruled East Germany for all its 40 years has already abolished its guar­anteed monopoly on power and promised free elections for as early as next year. 
It was not clear who will now try to fill the leadership vac­uum. 
The popular opposition, still in its infancy, remains poorly organized while the Communist Party has a broad power base from which leaders with grass­roots support could emerge. 
Among the reformers named to the new 25-member party committee are Dresden Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer and the country's former spy chief, Markus Wolf. 
Huge demonstrations contin­ued despite the party leaders' resignation. 
Several hundred thousand people joined hands to form "human chains" in sections across the country Sunday de­spite freezing temperatures. They held up signs calling for the removal of the "Central Committee mafia" and impris­onment for ex-party "criminals."

INSIDE COLUMN 
Young don't know about the Cold War 
If I had to write an 
essay on "What the 
Opening of the Berlin 
Wall Means to Me," I 
would be at a loss. 
Unfortunately, I've 
found that I don't 
have much of an 
appreciation for the 
changes taking place

in Communist Europe, 
including the fact that Kelley TuthIll 
the Berlin Wall was Assistant News Editor 
opened. 
Part of my problem is that I am only 19 years old. I wasn't alive when the Wall was built. Nor was I a witness to the beginning of communist oppression in East Germany. I only knew that people in East Germany were oppressed; I didn't see the beginning. In my lifetime I suppose I will only witness the beginning of the end of this oppression. 
r think a large part of my problem is that in high school my history courses included world history and Amnrican history. In studying world history, we started at the birth of civilization and never got anywhere near the 1900's. Then junior year in American history we reached the 20th century, but we stopped at The Great Depression. 
When I look back at junior high school the story is much the same. Seventh grade, world history; eighth grade, American history. The texts always included modern history, but summer vacation interrupted tlw class just before we got to modern history. 
Young people need to know history, in­cluding modern history. When I .took the National Endowment for the Humanities test on history and literature I found that I made many errors in the modern history section. I was never taught about the World Wars, tlw Vietnam War or the building of the Berlin Wall. 
Junior high schools, high schools, and especially eollr~ges, must include mandatory courses that teach students about modern history. I know that Columbus discovered America. I know that George Washington was the first president of the United States. I should know when the Berlin Wall was built and why it was significant, but I don't. 
Educators cannot forget that their stu­dents missed a lot of history by being born in the late '60's or later. We need to be taught what we were not alive to experience ourselves. 
Th11 changes taking place right now in the world are exciting and I'm lucky to witness them. However, the nightly news and Time magazine can only tell me so much. 
They say the Cold War is ending, but I'd like to know when and why it began. It's hard to become excited over world events when you've never be educated as to why they're important in the first place. 
Many teachers and professors say that students are not intellectually curious enough, but maybe they just don't know what we're curious about. It could be that we'd like to learn about events that took plac11 before we were born other than the history we've learned many times before.

Bush meets with NATO leaders, discusses Malta summit with allies 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) ­President Bush reports today to NATO leaders on his super­power summit with Mikhail Gorbachev, saying the allies can be pleased with two days of talks that helped "tear down any remaining barriers" erected during 45 years of Cold War. 
The president said the meet­ing helped dispel Gorbachev's doubts about Bush's attitude toward economic and political reforms in the Soviet Union, as the United States applauds the fall of hard-line communist regimes throughout Eastern Europe. 
"I don't think he has me down as a total negativist at all and I certainly don't have him down" that way, Bush said be­fore leaving the Mediterranean island of Malta, where he held eight hours of discussions with Gorbachev aboard the Soviet cruise liner Maxim Gorky. 
Arriving here Sunday night, Bush said, "Much was accom­plished to accelerate and im­prove East-West relations." 
While there were no concrete agreements, Bush and Gor­bachev said they want to speed completion of three arms con­trol treaties: to banish chemical weapons, slash long-range nu­clear missiles by as much as 50 percent and to reduce troops, tanks, artillery and other con­ventional forces in Europe. 
There had been some concern 
among the allies that Bush and Gorbachev might strike an arms deal without consulting them, but Bush said there were "no surprises." 
Today's gathering of leaders from the 16-member North At­lantic Treaty Organization was a mini-summit of its own. Bush planned to brief them during two rounds of talks spanning about 4 1/2 hours. 
Gorbachev, meanwhile, was baek in Moscow to brief leaders of a radically reshaped Warsaw Pact. Attendance by Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Ma­zowiecki, a Solidarity figure, marked the first time a non­communist would sit at the table.

TOKYO lAP) -Breaking into the lucrative Japanese market isn't impossible, but it isn't easy, either. Consider Snickers. 
For Mars Co., putting Snick­ers, Mars bars and M&M's within reach of Japanese con­sumers required "a mind-bog­gling expenditure of time and money," said Kiyoshi Ide, senior managing director of Mars' .Japanese subsidiary. Master Foods KK. 
The breakthrough also re­quin~d an alliance with one of .Japan's giant trading compa­nies. Mars leaped over Japan's formidable barriers by using Mitsubishi Corporation's exten­sive eontacts to place its candy bars at subway kiosks and in gron~ ry stores. 
Mars began selling candy in .Japan in 1987. While the com­pany won't divulge sales fig­urns, it said surveys show Snkkers' share of th1~ chocolate bar market is growing, from its small base. faster than that of any other brand. 
Foreign companies attempt­ing to sell in Japan have to hurdle governrnent barriers ­including murky rules and rPgulations, import duties, fair tradP price laws that limit sales promotion activities, and com­plex import procedums. 
But the maze-like distribution system -rigidly controlled by wholnsalPrs -is a particular hindrance to importers because it typically inerflases prices up to four times after Japanflse distributors add on their markups. 
For "status" products. the climb is even stBeper. The wholesal1~ price of a bottle of Hennessy's VSOP Scotch whiskey is $7, but by the time it hits storn shelves it is $77.50. 
Consider the imported neck­tin: $28 to thfl import agent, who s1~lls it to a wholflsaler for $56, who sells it to a depart­nwnt store for $70, which dis­plays it beautifully and gets $112 from the customer.

Simply finding someone to distribute new products in Japan often is impossible be­cause of exclusive, longstanding relationships between wholesalers and retailers. Sole import agents, although easier to find, limit a product's sales. 
Amway Corporation, the American direct-sales company, is doing a booming business here. Its secret? It imported its own distribution system. 
The company offers house­hold items. toiletries and cook­ware through its network of 500,000 Japanese distributors who sell through personal con­tacts from their homes. A phone call to one of Amway's three modern distribution cen­ters will produce an item within 72 hours, says Peter Scacco of Amway. 
Amway is the fastest-growing foreign company in Japan, ac­cording to a study by the No­mura Hesearch Institute, with sales of more than half a billion dollars last year.

After more than 20 years of pressure and persuasion, and some recent improvement in the trade balance, Washington is zeroing in on what many ex­perts say has been the issue all along: Heal progress depends on changing the way the Japanese do business. 
"Japan's systems for buying and distributing goods are the biggest obstacle facing U.S. manufacturers who export or do business in Japan," H.K. Morris, director of international trade policy for the National Association of Manufacturers, recently told a U.S. Senate committee in Washington. 
With Japan accounting for 40 percent of the U.S. trade deficit last year, the imbalance hasn't fallen as far as it should have given the weakening of the dol­lar against the yen, U.S. offi­cials say. 
Behind the arcane trade rules once used to keep imports out lies an even more formidable challenge -"keiretsu," or networks of financial and per­sonal ties that bind Japanese subcontractor to manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer, in al­most impenetrable alliances. 

Washington in November at which Japanese officials said they would "advise" firms to end practices keeping foreign companies out of their market, but warned that quick change was unlikely. 
"There was very little flexibil­ity in the Japanese government position ... in reaching common ground on the nature of the problems, even problems which appear to be widely recognized in Japan," U.S. Assistant Trea­sury Secretary Charles Dallara said after the talks. 
Japan's insular, exclusive business culture and the Hfestyle and tastes of its dis­criminating consumers lie out­side government jurisdiction. 
In most cases, but certainly not all, a foreigner hoping to sell to Japan no longer faces obvious legal barriers, U.S. of­ficials say. Quotas and excessive duties on alcohol, beef, citrus and many other products have been negotiated out of ex­istence. 
Vociferous complaints and lengthy trade talks also have helped to end the strange re­strictions like those that once judged foreign-made skis "unsuitable" for Japanese snow. 
Instead, foreign and Japanese businessmen trying to sell new products here face alliances of Japan's most powerful firms ­Dai-Ichi Kangyo-each with its own banks, retailers and real estate, insurance and manufacturing companies. 
These are the "keiretsu," and there are some 30 smaller ones as well. Through interlocking holdings, they own more than 70 percent of shares on Japan's stock markets. 
Cartels by any other name, the keiretsu enable competing manufacturers to fix prices and divide markets among them­selves -activities that would be illegal under antitrust laws in the United States or Europe but provoke only mild govern­ment warnings here. 
According to a study by the American Chamber of Com­merce in Japan, almost 48 per­cent of home electronics in Japan are sold through exclu­sively affiliated stores and 99 percent of cars are distributed through exclusive dealerships. 
The keiretsu are looser ver­sions of the industrial com­bines, or "zaibatsu," of wartime Japan. 
Japan's commercial armies are the nation's economic de­fense. Only Japanese products carry the guarantee of being returned to the wholesaler if they do not sell. Imports don't. Through such arrangements, Japanese manufacturers keep 
1.6 million retailers in business. 

Weak growth seen for final quarter 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The government's chief economic forecasting gauge signaled a slowdown in October, but other evidence suggested lower interest rates will keep the economy from toppling into a recession. 
The 0.4 percent drop in the Commerce Department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators announced Friday fits in with the consensus among analysts that the final quarter of this year and the first three months of 1990 will see weak growth at best. 

"The indicators are telling us what they've been telling us for some time and that is that the economy is continuing to expand, but at a slow rate," said economist David Berson of the Federal National Mortgage As­sociation. 
However, he and other ana­lysts said a number of factors mitigated the unfavorable re­port. The decline followed two monthly gains; most of the weakness was concentrated in only two of the index's 11 for­ward-looking business statis­tics. 
And, elements of the index and a separate report on October construction spending suggest that the Federal Reserve Board's cuts in interest rates since June are beginning to stimulate the economy. 
Construction activity rose 1 percent in October, bolstered by the first gain in single­family construction in nine months, the Commerce Department said. 



Computer industry finds profit in American illiteracy 
The troubled computer in­dustry thinks it may have found a new profit center for the 1990's by focusing on a problem even bigger than its own: the illiteracy of Amer­ica. 
Look for a major push by tlH~ technology tycoons at the national educational conclave in Washington in February. The meeting is billed as a hard-hPaded, practical follow­up to the first such conclave in Charlottesville, Va .. this fall. when President Bush and 48 governors espoused a gen­eralized concern about the sad state of American educa­tion. 
The argument you'll be hearing from computer companies is that one of the most cost-efficient ways of spending any new money for education is on more and better technology. 
IBM. for example, is getting ready to spread the story of Orangeburg, S.C., where in 197 5 only fourteen percent of the 6,500 students-80 percent black, 70 percent on reduced-price school lunches-scored better that the national average on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills. That jumped to 57 percent in 1988, after installation of 140 IBM computers. ("We use the same books, we have the same teachers, the same administrators," says school superintendent James A. Wilsford. "The intervening variable is the computers.") 
Computers in schools are scarcely a new idea, of course; more than a million educationally oriented com­puters and programs have been installed in the past decade. But executives of companies like IBM, Apple, Commodore and Tandy are convinced that this is just the beginning of the role they can play in educating backwards students, particularly in the inner cities. 
The dimensions of the problem are indisputable. An estimated 23 million Ameri­cans cannot read or write. About 50 percent of prison 

Louis Rukeyser 
Tribune Media Services 
inmates are illiterate, which may be one big reason why they started down the road to the slammer in the first place. Kids are quitting school at the rate of 3,600 every school day, and the estimated percentage of high school students who fail to graduate has jumped to a new high of 28.9 percent. 
U.S. businesses spent $25 billion a year simply retrain­ing workers who enter the employment market unpre­pared. 
The computer manufactur­ers, eyeing the lucrative school system market, are heartened by the admission of Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos that the country has been "standing still" educationally for three years running, "and so it's time to turn things around." 
Technology can do just that, industry executives argue, by appealing to the instant-fun inclinations of today's youth, while making the routine tasks of learning interesting. 

As James B. Dezell, head of educational marketing for IBM, put it to me, "Technology makes learning exciting. If we're going to solve the serious dropout and illiteracy problems in America, we have to make learning exciting. The ability to do that is available today." 
An array of technology "smarts" to capture students' attention and help them learn is increasingly available. Apple, which long has pushed for dominance in the youth markets, has supplemented its educational hardware and software with an "Educational Technology Consultants Program" that even provides advice on fund-raising. Tandy's "School Mate" connects stand-alone computer software into a network of integrated learning systems. IBM has come up with programs like "Writing to Read," which entertainingly shows kids how to write the words they are speaking. And Commodore has introduced a new line of personal computers specifically for educational purposes. 
In a period when it is far easier for Americans to proclaim goals than to finance their achievement, the new classroom technology will inevitably face stringent budget constraints. On its side, however, is a growing recognition of the price of continued inaction; by some estimates, problems related to illiteracy are costing the nation as much as $200 billion a year, and recent Japanese cnticisms of the state of our educational system are only the latest evidence of the damage it is doing to America's image an(:! competitiveness. It would be poetic justice if a country that forgot how to read were helped back up the learning ladder by the darned com­puters themselves.

What a Question inspires new conversation 
ROBYN SIMMONS 
assistant accent editor 
Late night discussions in the dorm usually lead to bleary­eyed mornings for collt=:ge stu­dents, but for Daniel R. Murray the late night conversations he had during his undergraduate days at Notre Dame were the inspiration of his first book, What A Question! Opening Doors to Conversation and Windows of Discovery. 
What A Question is a book of conversation-inspiring ques­tions. based on the discussions Murray had as an undergradu­ate and graduate student. Murray graduated from Notre Dame in 1984 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. He is currently finishing a Masters degree in Applied Statistics and Quality Improvement at Rutgers University. 
"When people hear I wrote the book. they're really sur­prised at what I studied," said Murray. 
Here is a sampling of the questions in Murray's book: 
* 
If you could write your next fortune cookie, what would it say? 

* 
lias there ever been a time in your life you later considered to be a turning point? 

* 
If you were granted one wish for any person other than yourself, whom would you choose to give it to. and what would you wish for that per­son? 


Murray's interest in philo­sophical discussions began while he was an ND under­graduate living in Stanford Hall. "Wh~t used to happen is some friends of mine and I would end up staying up really late in the dorm after we fin­ished studying." said Murray. 
"We had interesting conver­sations about all sorts of topics. With all of the students taking courses like philosophy 


"After I graduated and I got into the real world. I found that those conversations were very infrequent and I found it was hard to find people who were interested in having those sorts of deep conversations," he said. 
Murray finally found kindred spirits at a local diner in Para­mus, New Jersey. "I met up with a group of friends who would meet every week at a diner. and that's where the idea for writing those interesting questions came from," he said, "So at the diner, each person would contribute questions that they had thought up, and as a group we would discuss the question. 
"As that got going, I decided 
lines aren't realistic. Maybe he should go back to the big screen. 
Another problem with the show is its lack of originality. Fans of "Murphy Brown" may consider this show a sort of deja vu. The office sets are quite similar to "Brown" and the characters in the office are, to write up a list of those ques­tions so I wouldn't forget them, and that list became the early manuscript for the book. And as the list grew larger I real­ized that I could turn this into a book." said Murray. 

Based on the initial response to What a Question. Murray be­lieves that the book can be read three different ways. "The first (way) is. they read through the book on their own ahead of time. and then later when they're talking to people, ideas from the book trigger in their mind and spark conversation." said Murray. 
"Another way is some people just enjoy reading through the questions and thinking about 
too. There's even a dinghy blond on the show. just like on "Brown." There is, however. one huge difference between the two shows: "Murphy Brown" is excellent and entertaining. Where's the agent who sold "Teddy" to CBS? Maybe he has a brighter future writing com­edy for Bob Hope. 
what their answers would be," said Murray. "That's more of an introspective self-discovery approach." 
"The third way is when people actually have the book while they're talking to other people 
and will be reading questions 
from the book," he said. 
New Voyage Books, the pub­lisher of What a Question! is also offering Murray's ten point guide to conversation. Murray refrains from using hard and fast rules; one of his tips is to "have fun." The guide is sepa­rate from the book itself. and interested readers can obtain a copy of it by writing to New Voyage Books, 415 Route 18, Suite 234, East Brunswick, NJ 08816. 
"The reason I wrote What a Question! is to launch people directly into conversation with­out a lot of rules." said Murray. "I think people sometimes get turned off by a long description of conversational techniques that doesn't tell you what to talk about." 
With the publication of one book under his belt, Murray plans to write more books. "My theme (will be) relationship en­richment, in other words, im­proving your interpersonal re­lationships with other people," said Murray. 
As far as Murray's relation­ship with his friends from Stanford Hall is concerned, Murray still keeps in contact with many of the people who stayed up all night with hini, deep in conversation. 
"When I was in college I used to think that everybody that I knew there...would all be friends for life." said Murray. "What typically happens instead is people drift apart and it takes an active effort to keep in contact and finally that effort is well worth it." 
All summer. CBS braced the public for "The Famous Teddy Z;" however, they didn't brace it enough. The sitcom to ·end all sitcoms should itself be ended. "Teddy" is a drab and dull dis­appointment that drowns its devotees in disgusting drool. "Teddy" will surely be famous, but not as CBS hoped. 
and theology and mentally stimulating courses that ex­pand one's horizons. I think that leads to a lot of stimulat­ing discussion on campuses," he said. "For me, that was a very satisfying part of my col­lege experience." 
Murray's discussions with his friends were spontaneous and covered a broad range of topics. from the general to the specific. "We used to have a lot of ethical discussions about personal freedom," said Mur­ray, "The issues here were things like. 'Should the govern­ment make people wear things like seat belts, thus infringing on their personal freedom but for their own good?'" 
'Teddy' features big name and lacks plot 
Old habits are hard to break. CBS constantly thinks that placing a big name star into a two-bit show will help viewers overlook the program's medi­ocrity. Cases in point: Jon Cryer in his cheesy new sitcom 
JoeBucolo 
To be continued... 
"The Famous Teddy Z." "Z" airs on Mondays at 9:30 
p.m. It presents Jon Cryer as Teddy Zakalokis. a new young agent at thn Unlimited Talent Agency. Teddy works with A1 Floss (Alex Hoeco). a hyper. uptight agnnt who sincerely be­lieves Teddy will be a great agent once he's given the chance. Teddy may make a great agent. but "Teddy" will never make a good show. 
The premise of the show is ­well-bearable. If ABC can have a teenage doctor, CBS can have a young agent; however, a show needs to be more than bearable to succeed. The dialogue is silly and the plotlines make those of "Three's Company" seem so­phisticated. 
In one episode, AI lights to get Teddy more clients. When the bosses at UTA agree, AI gives the famous TV star. Bobby, to Teddy as a client. The problem: Bobby is a monkey. When Bobby's owner tells Teddy the monkey's a girl, Z says, "But he plays a boy on the show." The owner responds, "He's a good actor." These are the jokes, folks. 
Of course, that episode is full of monkey pranks and stunts. What's more pathetic is the fact that the monkey's grunts and noises are more intelligent than the actors' lines. While Teddy tries to keep everything under control. A1 jumps and scurries around the office as if he were related to Ed Grimley. And this is supposed to be CBS' hit of the season? 
Jon Cryer fans will remember his great performances in such movies as "Pretty in Pink" and "Hiding Out." Don't expect characters like those in this series. In fact. Cryer seems out of sorts in the program. His delivery is unnatural and his

Some balloters criti­cized llouston's offense as be­ing geared to rack up statistics for Warn, and others said llouston was beating up on 
much weaker opponents, and continuing to pass when hold­ing a big lead, all to improve Ware's chances. In fact, Ware was left off 280 of the 917 bal­lots cast.

"Andre had a sensational year," Thompson said. "He was definitely the worthy winner, with his stats and so forth." 
Thompson put together a sensational year himself, with 1,793 yards rushing and 25 touchdowns. faeing tougher de­fenses than Ware all season. 
''I'm not disappointnd. really. I had no idea I'd be second. I figured Ware would win it, and I'm proud to be anywhere close to that." 

"I think it was fantastic that he was a finalist," said Thompson's Indiana coach, Bill Mallory. "To be second is really exciting. I'm thankful he's been involved in our program." 
Harris was less magnanimous than other candidates. 
"I think I did an adequate job this year," Harris said. "I played in a team concept of­fense, and I think I made the most of it. I could've had com­parative numbers if I'd had the same offense. With that of­fense, if you don't put up those numbers, you sit. This isn't go­ing to affect me. I'm still a Mountaineer. and I've got to get ready to play." 
The team concept was also on Rice's mind. When asked if what he could've done to im­prove his statistics, Hice, who garnered 72 first-place votes, said: 
"If you go out there to rack up stats and you lose, what is that? That's nothing. Notre Dame is not just a one-person team. I like what hn (Ware) said about sticking tognthnr and prove people wrong. It's the team that wins." 
Hice's teammate, reeniver and kick returner Haghib "Hoeket" Ismail, tied for 1Oth in thn vot­ing with 48 points, the same as Penn State's Blair Thomas and one less. than Ty Detmer of Brigham Young. One defnnsive player was among the top 11 , Michigan State's Percy Snow.

But the referee called Davis for a charge, wiping out the basket and giving the ball back to Termessee. On their next trip downeourt, Sara l.iebscher drove to her left at the top of the key and was tripped by a Volunteer defender. Liebscher 
was called for travelling. and her team lost its spark on the floor. 
"I don't think we should haw~ l1~t it (the officiating) bother us. but it did," said Irish coach Muffet McGraw, "The way we were playing on offense, we re­ally needed every basket we could get, so that hurt us a lit­tle bit." 
The Volunteers closed out the half with an 8-0 run to head into the locker room with a 35­23 advantage. They carried over the momentum they had gained into the second half and quickly disposed of the Irish. running out to a 45-26 lead with a little less than 13:12 left to play. 
The key to the second half was Tennessee's work on the boards. Although Notre Dame managed to outrebound the Volunteers 24-23 in the first half. Tennessee's depth at the forward position took its toll on the Irish. By the time the second half rolled around it was obvious that Notre Dame center Margaret Nowlin, who led the Irish with 10 points and 15 rebounds, could not continue to compete with the plethora of talented rebounders Tennessee brought off the bench. 

"Margaret did a good job de­fnnsively and a good job on the boards," said McGraw, "but their depth hurt us more than their size. They could CQme in with so many talented players that they wore us down." 
Turnovers also hurt the Irish in the second half. Although Notre Dame had no problems with the 1-2-2 press employed by the Volunteers in the first half, the man-to-man defense of Tennessee forced the Irish guards to turn over tlw ball several times. 
"They forced our offense out away from the basket, and our guards didn't handle the ball very well. Our strnngth is sup­posed to be in our ball han­dling, but it's tough l'or us to simulate this (type of pressure) in practice because we only have 9 players. That's tlw strength of a team like Tennessee. they can go against a scout team in practice that is as good as our starting team." said McGraw. 
In the end. tlw stn~ngth and 
balance of the Volunteers wew simply too much for tlw Irish. Guard Dnna Ilead led all seor­ers with 12 points, while McGhee, center lhwdra Charles and thre11-point bomber Jody Adams added 11 apiece. Kuhns and junior guard Karen Hobinson were right behind Nowlin in the Irish scoring col­
umn with nine points each.

"But it was more lik11 thren to

play -the doctors wnren't right, 
so I'd never go back them." 
More than once, the steps to 
recovery nearly proved too 
tough for Hannon. 
"About four or five times. I 
wanted to just. go home and 
forget about basketball," he 
said. "Sonwthing kept drawing

playnr was back in full gear. 
"lie started practicing with us right aftN Christmas," re­called Crum. "We used him against otlwr guys just to get him in shape. By the end of the season. we w11rc wishing he was eligible." 
Harmon now finally is show­ing the rest of the country why he was so lwralded coming out of high school. A major catalyst coming off the berich. the red­shirt sophomore has t!J<Un­mates irnpt·ess!ld with his ver­satility. 
"Jerome is a great player. and any great playnr is going to b11 a plus for us," said Smith. "fie can play two to three posi­tions, hit tlw boards, pass and scow. 
!Iarmon proved all those things against the Irish. just as he has throughout this young season. Thn only thing still sur­prising about Harmon is the fact that he isn't starting.

"fie's as good as anybody on this tnam or any team," said LouisviiiP center Felton Spencer. "lie's a phenomenal talent who always comes out to play."

"(Crum) just puts me in to add a spark to the team and help out the offense." Harmon said of his job on the team. "It really doesn't bother me. I play just as much as some of the starters." 
Besides, after waiting two full years before his collegiate de­but, sitting on the bench for live or six minutes at the start of a game seems like nothing. "It's been a really long time," said Harmon, remembering his past adversity. "But my time is here. It's really worth the wait." 

Senior forward Keith Robinson recorded 1s-points to lead the Irish in scoring for the second consecutive game. Freshman Monty Williams scored 11 points off the bPnch, and point guard Tim Singleton added 10. 
The Louisville defense shut down Notre Dame co-captains Joe Fredrick and .Iamere Jackson. They combined for just 13 points on 5-of-13 shooting. 
"We were just running the of­fense, and I wasn't moving around enough to get open," Fredrick said. 
Said Phelps, "We really need both of those guys to have good games. When they go 5-for-13, that's not going to win very many games."

and played the Cardinal starters to an 8-8 tie for the first six minutes. 
The "Green" team of 
Williams, Daimon Sweet, Elmer 
Bennett, Keith Tower and Kevin 
Ellery played the next five min­
utes and helped the Irish get a 
17-15 lead. Ellery scored five 
points during that run. 
Louisville bounced back to take a 33-28 advantage, with Smith connecting on a three­pointer and a baseline jumper. Notre Dame scored the last three points of the half on a free throw by Ellery and a 20­foot jumper by Fredrick to trail just 34-33 at the intermission. 
'The first half, we seemed a step behind wherever we were," said Louisville coach Denny Crum, whose team played in the Maui Classic at Hawaii last weekend. "Their defense had something to do with that." 
The Irish stayed close early in the second half. A jumper. by .Fredrick with 16:49 to play gave Notre Dame a 41-38 lead. The Cardinals scored six straight points to take the lead, but two free throws from Jackson cut the advantage to 48-46 at the 13:37 mark. 
Louisville took a 56-50 lead on another jumper from Smith, but baskets by Bennett and Williams shrank that margin to 56-52. The Irish cut the lead to 58-56 on a driving layup by Bennett and still had a chance at 64~61 ~ith 7:35 to play. 
said Pitino. "He got off as good a shot as vou want.

Bears' woes continue 
Madson sets record in Irish sweep 
By KEN TYSIAC Sports Writer 

Senior goaltender Lance Madson broke the Notre Dame record for career victories last wnekend at the Joyce ACC as the Irish hockey team swept two games from Mankato State. 
Madson shattered the victory mark in style on Friday night. stopping 38 shots in a 5-0 shutout for his 47th career win. Madson also performed well on Saturday night in a 5-3 triumph over the Mavericks as the Irish boostl~d their record to 10-2 on the season. 
But Madson, who holds sev­eral other Irish records, induct­ing saves in a season and saves in a career, was quick to credit his teammates for their part in the shutout. 
'Everyone was really pulling for the shutout," said Madson, "And that made me feel pretty good. The defense tonight was just incn~dible." 
Sophomore center Pat Arendt provided all the support Madson needed at the 8:06 mark of the first period when he took a pass from senior Bruce Guay, wheeled in front of Maverick goalie Glen Prodahl, and slid the puck into the lower right hand corner. 
Lou Zadra, Dan Marvin, Curtis Janicke and Tim Kuehl went on to score goals for the Irish in what was a very physi­cal hockey game. Madson bore the brunt of some Mankato State frustrations. as the Mavericks chargnd the net with authority looking for rebounds. 
On one play late in the second period. Irish ddenseman Dan Sawyer thought Maverick for­ward Mike Finnerty charged the net a little bit too hard. The two players exchanged words, and then Sawyer dropped his gloves and knocked Finnerty to the ice. 
"Thev had been taking shots at Lance after the whistle all night long," said Sawyer, a 5­11, 205 pound freshman, "On that particular play it was re­ally blatant. I took him (Finnerty) into the corner, and I didn't like what he had to say. We had to make an example out of him." 
Sawyer received a four-minute double minor penalty, while Finnerty only was penal­izcd for two minutes. On the ensuing Maverick power play, Madson was tested several times from in dose, but he was equal to the task, and managed to keep the puck out of the net. 
The physical play continued into the following night, when Mankato State scored first on a long slapshot by Paul Gherardi that seemed to fool Madson as it rattled off the post and into the net when the game was just over a minute old. The Mavericks were able to keep the Irish in cheek until midway through the period, when Curtis Janicke knocked the puck away from a defender right in front of the Mankato State net and sophomore Mike Curry smacked it into the goal. 
Dave Bankoske scored on a breakaway at the 14:15 mark to give the Irish the lead going into the dressing room. Sawyer made it 3-1 with a wild slapshot from the left point on a power play which hit the upper right hand corner above goalie J.P. Piche's shoulder at the 4:40 mark of the second period. 
But the Mavericks refusea to 
quit. Just .31 seconds later 
freshman Paul Gertf'n tipped a 
shot past Madson from in close 
to narrow the Irish lead to one 
goal. Mankato State continued 
to put the pressure on Madson 
throughout the second period, 
as Notre Dame had trouble 
moving the puck out of its own 
end. 

Then the Mavericks gave the game away. With 3:36 remain­ing in the second period, a Mankato State defender made an errant pass from behind the net right onto Pat Arendt's stick. Arendt backhanded the puck past Piche to give the Irish a 4-2 lead going into the third . period, and the Irish were on their way to their fourth straight victory. 
Senior defenseman Kevin Markovitz really stood out for the Irish on a weekend when most of the accolades were heaped upon Madson. Markovitz totaled four assists in the two games. lie show­cased his passing and puck handling skills on a goal in the second period of Friday night's game, when he eluded a de­fender at the blue line, skated in from the point, and slid a perfect pass to Curits Janicke, who tipped the puck .past Prodahl. 
"That's what coach Schafer likes me to do," said Markovitz. "lie likes me to bring the puck out of the zone. I'm not looking for big hits out there. I'm just looking to move the puck." 
This weekend the Irish meet Ferris State in a home-and­home series. Schafer's squad will travel to Ferris State on l'riday and then meet the Bulldogs at the Joyce ACC at 
7:30 on Saturday evening. 

Saint Mary's defends tourney title 
By HEATHER ATKINSON SMC Sports Editor 
Tlw Saint Mary's basketball team was able to defend its title again this year at the annual Houndball Classic. 
On Friday, the Belles played what head coach Marvin Wood calls the team's best offensive and defensive game of the sea­son. In the first round of the Classic, Saint Mary's defeated Mundelein College 94-74. That was the Belles' highest point output thus far. 
Senior .Julie Hadke turned in an outstanding game, leading the team's scoring with 25 points and contributing six as­sists. Two other players were in double ligures -sophomores .Janet Libbing and Catherine Hestovich, both with 13 points each. Libbing also lead the team in rebounds with nine. 
"We accomplished a lot of things that we wanted to," said Wood. "We've come along really well so far this season." 
The championship game against Bethel provided a more intense competition for the Bfllles. Bethel took a 16-8 lead early in the game and held onto that until the last seven minutes of the first half when Saint Mary's went on a 15-0 spurt. The Belles went into the half with a :n -24 lead. 
During the second half the Belles were able to maintain th!lir position. They dominat1~d

with a 14-point advantag<~ at one point in the game, but Bethel rallied near the end of the half to elpse the gap. The final was 73-67. 
The scoring in the final round was very balanced with 11 dif­ferent players conWbuting to the Belles victory. ;:l¥+tdke was again the top scorP,·f with 12 points followed by Dawn Brohman and Hestovich with 1 0 points each. Senior Amy Baranko dominated the boards, pulling down 11 rebounds. 
"Overall, it was a very good tournament," said Wood. "We've changed our style of play and the girls have adjusted well."

It turrwd out that th11 Cardi­nals destroyed the Irish in that category. 
Louisville pulled down 16 of­flmsive rPbounds and seored 19 second-ehancn points en route to an 84-73 victory over Notre Dame befom 40,128 fans at the Hoosier Dome in the Big Four Classic. 
"Corning into the gamn we were eoncnrrwd about their of­fnnsive rebounding capabili­ties," Phelps said. "You can't givn a tnam 16 offensive re­bounds and expect to beat them. That's where they punish you. It's just finding your man, maintaining contact and making sure they don't get the ball. That we couldn't rebound

Ware wins Heisman in close race 
Notre Dame's Tony Rice finishes fourth in balloting 
By THERESA KELLY 
Sports Editor 
NEW YOHK-Andre Ware, the University of Houston's record-breaking quarterback, won the 55th Annual Heisman Trophy, awarded by the Downtown Athletic Club in New York City. 
A favorite late in the voting, Ware edged Indiana running back Anthony Thompson by 70 points, the fourth closest lleisman race ever. West Virginia's Major Harris was third in the balloting with 709 points, and fellow quarterback Tony Rice of Notre Dame fin­ished fourth with 523. 
Rice was an early favorite, but 83% of the voters withheld their decisions until the last week of balloting, during which Hice's Irish team lost to Miami and Thompson and the Hoosiers lost to Purdue. 
"Some people said I'd have

crushed us in the second half." 
Said Louisville center Felton Spencer, "We work on it (offensive rebounding) a lot ­getting rebounds, screening people off and getting rebounds off of missed free throws. Today we wern able to get some baskets inside on free throws and put some missed shots back in the bucket." 
Despite being outplayed on the boards, the Irish stayed close, but the Cardinals (3-1) exploded for a 12-0 run mid­way through the second half that upped their lead from 64­61 to 76-61 and virtually assured Notre Dame of its first loss of the season. 
"I think they're a well­rounded team," Notre Dame center Scott Paddock said. "They're quick, physical up front, good outside shooters and good rebounders. That's the kind of team you have to

much about him, but he's a good player," said Notre Dame forward Keith Hobinson. "He can hurt you driving and shooting the pull-up jumper. It's hard to rush out and play him on defense." 
You couldn't blame Robinson for not knowing much about Harmon. During the past two years, Harmon had not done too much to get himself recog­nized . 
A MrDonald's All-American while at Lew Wallace High in Gary, Harmon was a Proposition 48 casualty his freshman season. After slipping on his back during the ofT-sea­son, Harmon underwent surgery to have a ruptured disk removed in Snpt1~mber 1988. lie was redshirtl~d and spent his entire sophomore year in rnha­bilitation. 
"The doctors told me it would bn six to eight weeks," Harmon said of thn rneovery procnss.

No. 1 Tennessee too much for Irish 
By KEN TYSIAC 
Sports Writer 
The top-ranknd Tennessee Volunteers simp:y had too much firepower fur the Notre Dame women's basketball team on Sunday as they shot down the Irish at the Joyce ACC by a score of 77-54. 
For a good portion of the first half. however, it ap­peared as if Notre Dame could possibly upset the Vol­unteers at home in front of a crowd of 2,764. After Ten­nessee shot out to an 8-0 lead, the Irish decided to prove that they could play with the number one team in the country. They pulled within one at 13-12 with 
11:37 remaining in the half when senior Lisa Kuhns con­verted an offensive rebound after a Comalita llaysbert miss. 
But the Volunteers pulled away again, as 6-3 junior center Carla McGhe1~. who finished with 11 points, scored 5 in a 10-4 run which gave Tennnssee a 23-16 !Pad. Again the Irish elawed back, and when junior forward Krissi Davis converted the front nnd of a one-and-one after being railroaded by Tennessee's Tonya Edwards while trying to set a piek, the score was 25-23 with 3:52 left in the half. 
At that point, a question­able call took the wind out of Notre Dame's sails. After McGhee hit a hook shot in the lane, Davis took a pass right in front of the basket, squared, and banked home a layup. The whistle blew, and it appeared as if the basket would stand and Davis would have a chance to complete the three-point play.

"At first I though Rice had it wrapped up," candidate Dee Dowis of Air Force said. "But when they got beat last week, all the attention shifted toward Ware." 
Three points were awarded 
for a first-place vote, two for second and one for third from among the 7 43 Heisman votes cast. 
"I want to thank my team­mates for playing their hearts out," Ware said from Houston after the award was an­nounced. "We've overcome a lot as a football team. I'm accept-
