STUDENT SENATE 

Jenkins fields questions from group 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Assistant News Editor 
University President Father John Jenkins ended an after­noon that included open office hours by visiting the Student Senate Wednesday, giving mem­bers the opportunity to ask questions about topics ranging from tuition increases to research. 
Jenkins opened the floor for discussion and told senators he appreciated their work as rep­resentatives of the student body. 
"Please know that your work is important and we value it, and whatever you say we will listen to it," Jenkins said. "We many not agree with everything you say but we will listen to you." 
Welsh Family senator Mary Popit asked Jenkins for his thoughts on a resolution the Senate passed two weeks ago, which urged the University to add sexual orientation to its anti-discriminatory clause. 
Jenkins said he had not yet

Cathedral High gives upNDlogo 
Use of Leprechaun violated trademark 
By KATIE KOHLER 
Saint Mary's Editor 
After almost 90 years of using Notre Dame's Leprechaun logo, Cathedral High School in Indianapolis is changing its image -a move strongly supported by Cathedral's principal, if not its alumni. 
Cathedral, whose students have been known as the Fighting Irish since the school's founding in 1918, will no longer be permitted to use the Leprechaun logo due to the University's allegation of trade­mark infringement. 
An Indianapolis Star article published on March 16 said Cathedral will stop using the logo, much to the chagrin of many alumni who feel "dis­owned by their own family," as Mary Boyle, president of the Cathedral Alumni Association, told the Star. 
Dave Worland, Cathedral High School principal, had a more optimistic view of the sit­uation. 
"I can understand why some people are upset because it has been part of our identity for so long," he said in a telephone interview with The Observer. 
Worland said he has not experienced any backlash from the students and sees the situ­ation as a positive one. 
"The students think it is

Irish tnascot cotnpetes on SpikeTV progratn 
ByJENN METZ News Writer 
Just because Notre Dame's basketball season has come to an end doesn't mean that Leprechaun Kevin Braun's duties are over. Tonight, the senior will be featured in a special college mascot edition of SpikeTV's "Pros vs. Joes 2" -potentially the last time he will be seen in the green suit. 
Braun, along with Penn State's Nittany Lion Dave Johnson and Wisconsin's Bucky Badger Sky Halverson, flew to California to film the episode last December on an all-expenses paid trip. 
Preparation began early last fall when Notre Dame cheer­leading coach Jo Minton told Braun he had an offer to be on the show, which airs at 10 
p.m. tonight. With the help of his fellow cheerleaders, Braun prepared an audition video that showcased him playing basketball and football around campus. 
Braun said the show usually puts three regular "Joes"-in this case, the mascots -with varied athletic skills up against retired professional athletes, or "Pros," in their respective sports. 
While the three mascots signed documents that forbid them to discuss the results of the contest, Braun said keep­ing that information from family, roommates and team­mates "has been pretty diffi­

Panel evaluates Honor Code 
By STEVE KERINS 
News Writer 
Academic integrity is an essential aspect of Notre Dame's mission, and students, faculty and administrators share the responsibility of upholding the Honor Code, a three-person panel said Wednesday. 
University Vice President and Associate Provost Dennis Jacobs, philosophy professor Bill Ramsey and senior Sarah Glatt spoke to about 30 people at this semester's second-to-last Theology on Tap event, "To Cheat or Not to Cheat: The Academic Honor Code." 
The issue of academic integrity "really cuts right to the heart of the University," Jacobs said, citing a phrase in Notre Dame's mission statement requiring members of the community to "seek and share truth for its own sake."

Squirrels are evil 

If there's one thing that I have learned while at Notre Dame, it doesn't have to do with theology or English. It's not about friendship or religion, life, work, society or univer­sity life. It has nothing to do Chris McGrady with relation­ships, truth, faith,

Scene Editor 
the development of a viable skill set that will help me in the real world. It's simply that squirrels are evil. 
Yeah, I said it. These furry fiends attack at a moment's notice and the truth is that the squirrels of Notre Dame are multiplying. 
Yeah, you know the ones -the obese little fluff-balls that roam this campus like bloodthirsty scavengers. They are growing in numbers by the day. In their plot to control the foot­ball team, run the dining halls and disrupt the campus sprinkler sys­tems, the squirrels require a large amount of funding. To defray the cost, these beasts seek monetary "donations" obtained largely through armed robbery of helpless North Face wearing, iPod-toting students. 
To help avoid these surprisingly carnivorous beasts. I'd like to make you aware of a few of their strate­gies for overtaking the common stu­dent. Remember. knowing your enemy is key to survival. 
The first tactic is called the "wolf pack." In this strategy, the squirrels attack in large numbers, sometimes 40 or 50 deep. They overtaken the victim by sheer force and drag them off to their secret lair (thought to be somewhere in South Dining Hall). 
Another tactic often employed by these animal assassins is the "kitty coup." Only certain squirrels are able to pull this off, but given the large size of these monsters, it can be done. A particularly chunky squirrel is outfitted with a cat collar and poses on the quad as a harmless feline friend. The unsuspecting vic­tim approaches the "cat" and is quickly subdued by a strong tran­quilizer stolen from the chemistry lab. Hours later, the injured party awakens frightened, alone, and 100 Flex Points poorer. These creatures will show no mercy. 
In addition to the large possum or "cat-like" squirrels, there is another variety called sprinters. These small­er, more agile creatures dupe their victims with exceptional speeq. 
As one undisclosed junior says, "Those squirrels are quick as [exple­tive]. They'll run up your pant leg and take you down." 
This is not an exaggeration -this is the plain and simple truth. Try out running these speedsters and you'll find yourself on the wrong end of a squirrel showdown. 
Until NDSP starts an initiative to help control the squirrel population, it is necessary to become educated about the dangers of these horrific brutes. This may seem ridiculous to you, but when you see one of these fatal mammalian creatures approaching you, you'll know to be on your guard.

Man gets probation for dead deer sex 
SUPERIOR, Wis. -A 20­year-old man received pro­bation after he was convict­ed of having sexual contact with a dead deer. The sen­tence also requires Bryan James Hathaway to be eval­uated as a sex offender and treated at the Institute for Psychological and Sexual Health in Duluth, Minn. 
Hathaway's probation will be served at the same time as a nine-month jail sen­tence he received in February for violating his extended supervision.

Center holds annual luncheon 
By JOHN TIERNEY 
News Writer 
With former Notre Dame football star Mike Golic as its keynote speaker, the annual Nose-On Luncheon raised an estimated $70,000 Wednesday for the Logan Center, a developmental­disorder support organi­zation in South Bend. 
Organizers hoped the event, more than just a fundraiser, served as a way to increase aware­ness of developmental disorders in the commu­nity. 
During his speech, Golic emphasized the importance of sports in the life of those who are helped by the Logan Center. 
The Logan Center serves individuals with developmental disabili­ties in all stages of life. It also provides resources for individuals and their families and advocates for developmental dis­ability awareness, but is not an institutional set­ting with caregivers. 
Golic told the audience that the biggest smile that he ever wore -­when he ran out of the tunnel as a Notre Dame football player --could not compare to the smiles he saw on Logan Center clients Wednesday morning at the "Breakfast of green noses to fundraise Champions," at which for the Logan Center this sports enthusiasts had month.

Professor honored by women of Saint Mary's 
By MANDl STIRONE 
News Writer 

Susan Latham, professor of commu­nicative disorders, received the "Women Honoring Women" award Wednesday night during Saint Mary's fifth annual Women Honoring Women ceremony. 
Latham was joined by fellow final­ists women's studies professor Astrid Henry and education professor Nancy Turner, who were selected from sev­eral nominees by the Student Academic Council (SAC), said event organizer Maggie Siefert, student body vice president and SAC coordi­nator. 
Siefert said the ceremony was expanded this year to include the stu­dents who nominated the finalists. Originally only SAC members, a pro­fessor of her choice and two students chosen from every department were invited, as well as the nominees and their husbands, Siefert said. 
"We are just excited that it is an ongoing event that has become a tra­dition to celebrate the great women of Saint Mary's," she said. 
The event, a formal dinner, began with a "cocktail hour" and then a din­ner, after which the students who nominated Latham, Turner and Henry each read their nomination presenta­tions. 
Senior Grace Guebert nominated Henry for being an outstanding edu­cator as well as a mentor and friend, she said in her speech. She described Henry as having "great respect for the women of the college." Guebert talked about Henry's warm smile and "open, understanding nature," going on-to call her a "sister to all the women of Saint Mary's." She also shared a per­sonal account of how welcome Henry made her feel during Guebert's first year. 
Next, senior Erin Turner read her nomination of Nancy Turner for "put­ting her whole heart into her work," and being a role model for her stu­dents. Erin Turner spoke about how Nancy Turner is organized and effi­cient in everything she does and is someone who has good moral quali­ties. She also spoke about the new program in Special Education Nancy Turner is working on. 
Senior Jessica Andrusiak then took the podium to speak about Latham. She said she was "blessed to be in her class," and talked about Latham's cru­cial research and development of a speech communicative disorders major at Saint Mary's. Andrusiak also said how responsive and enthusiastic Latham is during classes, sometimes bringing her students bagels. 
Siefert then took the podium along with last year's award recipient, Mary Ann Merryman, to announce the win­ner. 
After the announcement, a choked up Latham spoke of arriving at Saint Mary's 20 years ago as a student and how the campus was filled with "so many amazing women." Latham then went on to say how blessed she felt because she was still a part of the col­lege. 
"I just feel grateful everyday that I get to come and work here," she said.

The 27th anniversary of the assassination of Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero will be commemorated at Notre Dame March 27 and 29 with a panel discussion, a Mass and a lecture by Judge Victoria Marina de Aviles of the Supreme Court of El Salvador. 
The panel discussion, "Human Rights in El Salvador Today," will be held at 12:30 p.m. March 27 in Room C103 of the Hesburgh Center for International Studies. Panelists will include Aviles; Neris Gonzales, a Salvadoran Catholic Church worker and plaintiff in the recent Florida trial of Salvadoran military lead­ers responsible for torture and other human rights abuses dur­ing their country's civil war; Douglass Cassel, director of Notre Dame's Center for Civil and Human Rights; and John French, associate professor of history at Duke University and visiting fellow at the Kellogg Institute. 
Following the discussion, a Mass for women who serve in Latin America will be celebrated at 4 p.m. in the Church of Loretto at Saint Mary's College. 
Aviles also will give the annual Romero Lecture, "El Salvador's Reform of the Judiciary," at 8 
p.m. March 29 in the auditorium of the Hesburgh Center. The lec­ture will be in Spanish, but an English translation will be avail­able. 
Archbishop Oscar Romero was assassinated by a right-wing death squad while presiding at Mass on March 24, 1980, in a hospital in San Salvador. His out­spoken advocacy of human rights, his denunciations of U.S. military aid to El Salvador, his call for Salvadoran military per­sonnel to disobey immoral orders and his insistence that the Church be inseparable from the poor all made him a figure of some controversy before and after his death.

Palestinians find international help 
RAM-\LLAH, West Bank -A top European Union envoy met with a senior member of the new Palestinian government Wednesday, joining the U.S. in ending a year of ostracism and leav­ing Israel increasingly isolated in its demand for a total boycott of the Hamas-Fatah coalition. 
However, the Islamic militant l-lamas itself is still being shunned, and economic sanctions remain in place. The boycott has been a costly policy, international aid officials indicated. 
Donor countries had to send more aid to the Palestinians in 2006 than the year before to ease a humanitarian crisis set off by the embargo. Despite the increased aid, public institutions and services suffered because the funds bypassed the government, and the Palestinian economy shrank by 6.6 percent. 
The Palestinians hope the government installed Saturday, an alliance of Hamas and the Fatah Party of President Mahmoud Abbas, will lead them out of international isolation -even though the coalition did not meet international conditions for acceptance, such as recognizing Israel's right to exist.

Chirac's declaration of support and Sarkozy's departure from government had long been expected. Even so, the president kept praise for his former protege and later rival to a terse tele­vised declaration.

Gore faced a skeptical reception from Republicans who questioned the science behind his film.

Leader defends nuclear program 
Khamenei threatens 'illegal actions' if provoked by U.N. or United States 
Associated Press 
TEHRAN -Iran's top leader warned Wednesday his country will pursue "ille­gal actions" if the U.N. Security Council insists it halt uranium enrichment, an apparent reference to nuclear activities outside international regulations. 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also warned the United States that Iran would fight back with "all its capacities" ifattacked. 
"Until today, what we have done has been in accordance with interna­tional regulations," Khamenei said. "But if they take illegal actions, we too can take illegal actions and will do so." 
He did not elaborate on what the "illegal actions" could be, but Iran is a signa­tory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the agreement under which the 
U.N. inspections are held. 
Iran says it will never give up its right under the treaty to enrich uranium and pro­duce nuclear fuel. But it has offered to provide guaran­tees that its nuclear pro­gram won't be diverted toward weapons -as the

the First Lady on Feb. 22. 
"[Her secretary] invited me to have lunch with the First Lady, [a local congressman] and eight other representa­tives from schools along the Gulf Coast," Stowe said. 
Bush has been affiliated with ACE since 2001, when the Laura Bush Scholarship was established. The award is given to a student attend­ing an ACE-participating school in Texas, Bush's home state. 
"She wanted to know the condition of the [hurricane­affected] schools," Stowe said, adding that the First Lady's press secretary trav­eled with her and later wrote a report detailing their find­ings. 
Bush's familiarity with ACE and another similar post­graduate teaching opportuni­ty, Teach for America, led her to quiz Stowe on differ­ences between the two differ­ent programs during their conversation. 
"As a principal from anoth­er Catholic school said his greatest need was good teachers, Mrs. Bush turned to me and asked about the ACE program," Stowe said. "She asked something like, 'Now do you get as much 

support through ACE as you would through Teach for America?' 
"I was able to tell her that we learn the current best practices ... while we gain experience in the class­room," Stowe said. "I told her that this all takes place with the support built into the program through our fac­ulty, pastoral staff, princi­pals, mentor teachers and the community in which we live."

IN BRIEF 
Biotech companies to focus on fuel 
SAN FRANCISCO -Biotechnology was first applied in medicine, then farming. Today, dozens of lifesaving drugs are on the market, while many crops are genetically engineered to with­stand weed killers. 
Now, a 2-year-old push to develop alternative fuels is driving biotechnology's growth into the industrial sector. 
Most of the 5 billion gallons of ethanol pro­duced annually in the United States is still made by fermenting corn, but the crop is expensive and its use in biofuels cuts into the nation's food supply. So the Canadian biotech company Iogen Corp. has developed a method for deriving ethanol from a variety of plants including wheat, oats and barley. Others are genetically engineer­ing microbes to produce enzymes that will con­vert the cellulose in crop waste, wood chips and other plants into ethanol. 
President Bush helped breathe new life into this once-sleepy biotech sector by touting the need to ramp up production of this "cellulosic ethanol" in his last two State of the Union speeches. 
IDA bars input from drug companies 
WASHINGTON -Outside experts with more than $50,000 in ties to drug and medical device companies regulated by the Food and Drug Administration would be barred from advising the agency under draft guidelines issued Wednesday. 
The conflict-of-interest guidelines would allow scientific experts who accept less than $50,000 in corporate grants, contracts and consulting fees-or hold less than that amount in company stock -to still serve on the FDA's advisory com­mittees. But that could happen only if the need · for their services outweighed the potential con­flict, and only if they were nonvoting members, according to the draft. 
The agency relies on its panels of outside experts for recommendations on drugs, vaccines and devices. It wasn't immediately clear how many advisers would be barred, but Randall Lutter, the FDA's acting deputy commissioner for policy, told reporters it was a "significant num­ber."The release of the guidelines brought rare praise from a lawmaker and a watchdog who have criticized the FDA.

cult." 
The competitions featured on tonight's show include baseball, football, soccer and basketball events with Darryl Strawberry, Andre Reed, Cobi Jones and Spud Webb, respectively. 
The trip to California was "different," Braun said. He arrived late Sunday night and immediately began filming segments for the show. 
"It was bizarre," he said. "I was jet-lagged. We were on a very nocturnal-like schedule." 
The filming took· place d ur­ing class days, but Braun said his professors were very sup­portive and excited about his opportunity. 
Though he's been featured on TV many times as the Leprechaun, Braun said film­ing on a set was a <ery differ­ent experience. 
''I'm used to being in five­second clips ... [but] in [the episode] I'm prominently dis­played performing athletic feats," he said. "It was fun playing sports on camera, but I had to perform with person­ality." 
Braun said the show's events are creative and tend­ed to focus on aspects of the sports the pros excelled in. One event with Strawberry featured the former MLB star hitting fly balls for the Joes to catch. 
There are three preliminary events, and the top two mas­cots from those advance to overtime, which features more direct competition. The events were filmed in the Home Depot Center outside Los Angeles, the home of Major League Soccer's L.A. Galaxy. 
The winner of the show gets to "take the jersey off the Pro's back" and receives signed jerseys. Braun men­tioned a "Pros vs. Joes Tournament of Champions" as another incentive to win. 
While they competed in nor­mal athletic gear, Braun and the other mascots filmed the introductory segments in their suits. 
"The pros heckled us in our goofy outfits," said Braun, who described the experience as "intimidating." 
"The other two can't see [in their outfits], they don't talk, and they're covered in fur," he said. "It was interesting to see the other mascots' per­sonalities come out and to watch them do their thing." 
His three years of cheer­leading experience made him physically stronger, he said, but Braun had to think back to his high school intramural days to prepare for the com­petition. While he said he was pleased with his performance, he is curious how the editors treated the mascots during the production process. 
"I have no idea what the final product looks like. The three of us did some very embarrassing things.... I don't know how many bloop­ers they're going to show," he said. 
Braun said he and the mas­cots didn't get to interact with the pros that much during the early filming. 
"It was someone's job to take care of the pros so we wouldn't pester them," he said. 
After the final event, howev­er, they took the Joes back to their locker room and signed autographs and took pictures. 

"They [the pros] were very nice, but trash talk was encouraged. They wanted to make good, sensational TV," Braun said. 
Braun said about 25 percent of the filming was devoted to the actual competition, while 75 percent was "reality TV stuff," like the trash talking. He's most concerned about how his acting looks on film. 
"I want people to watch, but at the same time I'm afraid about how potentially embar­rassing this could be," he said. 
Even with the risk of embarrassment, Braun said all three mascots jumped on board with the show, which he called a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 
"Overall, it was a very excit­ing experience and I have maintained close contact with the other two mascots," Braun said. "Being in front of a camera and learning how many people go into the pro­duction of a successful TV show were very eye-opening experiences."

something cool because we may have a contest to create a new mascot or something dis­tinctly different than Notre Dame's Leprechaun," he said. 
Worland, who sends weekly e-mails to parents, students, faculty and staff, said he fre­quently reminds his con­stituents that the phasing out process is in full swing. 
Cathedral is not the only high school being asked to abandon its logo, Associate Vice President for News and Information Don Wycliff said. 
"Our general counsel tells me there have been literally dozens of schools over the years that have done the same thing," he told The Observer. "And every one of those schools thinks it is a special case for which the University ought to make an exception." 
Wycliff said the University had contacted Cathedral in 2000 about this issue. 
"There's nothing unusual about what Notre Dame has done in this case," he said. "It's a protect-it-or-lose-it situa­tion." 
The controversy at Cathedral made news when a parent who worked for the Star forwarded the information to the Star's sports department. 
"I think it really made a dif­ference that the last e-mail was sent right before St. Patrick's Day," Worland said. "It became a story repeating news that was already published in December." 
Still, the added publicity has not placed any more pressure on Cathedral or disturbed rela­tions with the University. 
"We have a great relationship [with Notre Dame] and I totally understand why they are ask­ing us to do this," Worland said. "We are not expecting Notre Dame to make an excep­tion for us because if they did, they might as well let loose for all the other schools who use the logo." 
Notre Dame has not set a deadline for Cathedral to com­plete the phase-out, but simply requested it produce no new merchandise or apparel with the logo. 
"The fact that the discussions between Notre Dame and Cathedral High have been going on since 2000 indicates that we have been generous in allowing the school to phase out the use of the University's marks and adopt others," Wycliff said in a press release Saturday. 
Since the process to change logos began years ago, Worland has been encouraging the use of the Celtic cross, another symbol of the school's Irish heritage. 
Overall, Worland said he and other members of the Cathedral community respect Notre Dame's stand on the issue and are willing to comply as soon as possible. 
"We respect their trademark rights. That's what trademarks are for," he said. "This issue will not change our relation­ship one bit." 
Worland said he is using this as a learning experience for his students. 
"We want to teach students that not respecting the trade­mark is the same as copying music or work. We don't want to teach the wrong example," he said. "This situation is no different. It shows our students the right thing to do.''

Pet owners frightened after recall 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -A recall of potentially deadly pet food has dog and cat owners studying their animals for even the slightest hint of illness and swamping veterinarians nation­wide with calls about symptoms both real and imagined. 
"It's like we're on pins and needles," said Brian Paone, a 27-year-old loan auditor in Knoxville, Tenn., who scheduled a blood test with his vet after realizing both of his cats had eaten brands on the recall list. 
"You kind of sit there and wonder -it's terrible to say this -you wonder if this is going to be your last moments with your pet. It's not pleasant." 
Some of the 60 million cans and pouches of food have been blamed for kidney failure in scores of animals and killed at least 16 pets. Neither the manu­facturer nor authorities have been able to determine why the pets died. 
Atlanta veterinarian Will Draper received so many calls and e-mails about the recall that he drafted a newsletter on it and e-mailed his customers. 
"That helped tremendously," Draper said. "It has calmed clients." 
Since Friday, nearly 100 brands of the "cuts and gravy" style food have been recalled by Menu Foods of Canada, includ­ing popular labels sold at Wal­Mart, Kroger and other large retailers. 
Veterinarians are directing most questions to the Food and Drug Administration's recall Web site. Some have agreed to run blood tests on pets, even though many of the animals have not consumed any of the recalled brands. 
Pet owners with animals showing symptoms such as vomiting, lethargy and extreme thirst are being told to bring them in for immediate exami­nation. 
"The recall is huge. It's unprecedented, and people are seeing their dog food is on the list and picking up the phone, wondering if there's anything they can do or what to do," said Tim Hackett, who runs a small­animal clinic at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. "Fortunately, most of these ani­mals are absolutely fine." 
Julie Benesh of Chicago brought her cat, Truffle, to a vet's office Wednesday after realizing the animal had eaten some of the contaminated food. The cat was lethargic and had been drinking an unusual amount of water. 
"That's my baby," Benesh said of the black-and-white cat she's had since the animal was a kit­ten. "We've been through a lot together." 
The Animal Medical Center on the East Side of Manhattan has tested 143 animals for renal failure since Saturday. Of those, 10 were confirmed to be diet-related cases, and one cat died. 
"I have people coming in who haven't even said their pet's eaten the bad food, but they're worried that maybe the recall has not been broad enough so they want their pet tested to be sure," said Ann Hohenhaus, a veterinarian at the clinic.

oneself. 
Faculty Honor Code Officer and philosophy pro­fessor Thomas Flint, who was not among the panelists Wednesday, explained some of the specifics of the Honor Code. Flint said, as at many uni­versities, Notre Dame's is a "modified honor redesigned to give professors more control over matters of discipline in certain cases. The change has resulted in a significant rise in reported infractions, he said, the caus­es of which remain unclear. 
"There's no reason to think that dishonesty among Notre Dame students has increased 61 percent over one year, but I know of no data that shows that it hasn't either," Flint said. "We're in an area where all one ean do is speculate." 
Wednesday's panelists touched on students' increas­ing use of the Internet as a vehicle for plagiarism, but Flint said the Internet can be a double-edged sword. 
"Professors have largely caught up to the students in terms of computer literacy, and most are quite adept at using Google, Turnitin.com or other resources to uncover cases of Internet-based cheat­ing," Flint said.

she said. 
Ramsey described academic dishonesty from a faculty member's perspective, but emphasized the need for both students and professors to ensure that clear goals and expectations are established at the beginning of each course. 
"I think sometimes faculty suppose that if we need to explain what's wrong with cheating, there's already

Ramsey also addressed Glatt's point about the choice between upholding the Honor Code and remaining loyal to a friend or classmate, arguing that the ethical conflict is illu­sory. 
"The choice is not a ehoice code," which allows students and faculty to administer it jointly. 
"Personally, I think we were wise to adopt a modified honor code," he said. "Cheating hurts other stu­dents, but it also does enor­mous damage to the teacher­student relationship." 
Flint also commented on the University's new system for responding to Honor Code infraetions, which was

The usually flamboyant boxing promoter, wearing a blue suit with his pre­ferred high hair style primly flat­tened for the papal event, gave the pope a green-and-gold box­ing belt and a handwritten letter asking for prayers for people ranging from President Bush to the world's sick and aged. 
"I was thrilled to be there. It was a deep spiritual experience," King told The Associated Press after the two-hour open-air audi­ence in St. Peter's Square. 
In Rome to discuss possible boxing matches in Italy, King had expressed his wish to meet with the pope. 
, 

Don King Productions spokesman Alan Hopper said the Vatican visit was arranged through a boxer King represents -Italian super welterweight champion Luca Messi, whose brother Alessandro is a Catholic priest. 
King was seated in the front row of a special section on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica. He was able to hand the pope the gift and the letter as Benedict drove slowly by in an open jeep at the end of the audience. 
King, who spent four years in prison for manslaughter, had hoped for a personal meeting with Benedict. Very few nonchurch people, however, receive private time with the pope during his Wednesday audi­ences.

Kids say the darnedest things. Working at a camp with high-schoolers last summer, I gained a new perspec­tive on a younger generation. "Younger" by only a few years, sure ­but contrary to pop­ular belief. college really does expand your mind and help you mature. 
In observing the dynamics of an age I myself so recently outgrew, my insights were not entirely positive. For instance, the campers would toss around racial stereotypes that could be playful or border on brutal insensitivity. To them, things like big Mexicans or golf-playing African­Americans were anomalies to be point­ed out. 
Before you stop reading, my misan­thropic reader, know that I too was once in your position. Sure, thought I, this whole race issue is important. But we're light-years beyond that now, aren't we? Racism may exist in some parts of the world, but here in our little community we are surely too egalitari­an to waste time worrying about dead issues of the past. Racial conflicts have been resolved, the world has learned its lesson, and our new generation will usher in an era of humanitarian peace once we claim our place in society and brush aside the dying embers of our less-tolerant progenitors. 
I held this mindset for my first two years on campus. If a column had nothing shocking to say about race or ethnicity in the first paragraph, I would probably skip over it. What more could be said? At my most dose-minded, I even thought that if we all just left this supposed "issue" alone, it would even­tually become moot and we would all come to a glorious understanding of 

James Dechant 
ForegoneConclusion 

our harmonious multiculturalism. 
Wrong. In the months since my expe­rinnees last summer, I am rethinking the way in which we learn about other cultures. Because there most definitely arc still things that need to be said. I'm not taking an overly eynieal stand on the matter-MLK and others have not toiled in vain, and we are leagues beyond the segregation of fifty years ago. But in our age, as America blinks tho dust out of her eyes and realizes she is not alone (for example, we are just now confronting the Arab world for tho first meaningful time), compas­sionate minds are needed. Minds that won't see generalities. 
Baek to the camp situation. The play­ful comments didn't bother me, but the arrogant presumptions of cultural awareness did. Campers assumed they knew all about a raee or culture, when in some eases they were obviously encountering such a person for the first time. The source of their behavior lies in a eareless ignorance, something many of us can identify with. We assume what we've "heard" about an ethnicity applies to individuals, when we actually have no personal experi­ence to guide our behavior. 
An ignorant mind, in terms of raee, probably means you're trying to com­prehend generalities, when you should be focusing on particulars. The prob­lem many people experienee when try­ing to break out of their bigotry stems from not being able to see past the entrenched praxis that urges us to see things in broad strokes. When accused of using stereotypes, one's compensa­tory and superficial reaction often clings to the same kind of textbook totalities, only with an aim of compas­sion. Example: Don't know anything about black people'? Just watch Dave Chappelle and take notes. No personal interaction neeessary. 
We are all guilty of this culture eo­opting. Cultures are valuable, incredi­bly dense and dynamic organisms. 
Understanding one takes time, and we 
eannot honestly consider ourselves 
multicultural if we do not invest the 
time to learn. You cannot understand a 
race or a culture through the incom­
plete lens of fashion or television or 
holidays, thank God (think St. Patrick's 
Day). Those important elements help 
broaden your horizons, but they are 
secondary to the integral demand of 
understanding individuals. The real 
cure is to try to learn about a culture 
from a person, not to learn about a 
person from a culture. 
Don't view individuals as tools to help you gather knowledge, but when the opportunity arises; do try to meet diverse people and get to know them. Don't approach them assuming the article on Wikipedia about their culture will help you understand their actions; instead, learn about their background by inter-acting with them. I delineate the prefix to stress that understanding is a two-way street: it requires dia­logue. not monologue. To work against the cultural ignoranee that breeds hate, meet people. And please avoid stereotypes and generalizations, even ones said casually or "in good fun." I know at least a few of the campers matured in this manner after aetually talking to new people. 
Primarily, try to open your mind and don't assume the struggle to end big­otry and stereotyping has ended. Many people still use stereotypes, learning about "the wholly other" from televi­sion rather than from a person. Try to ehange that -because after all, there is hope. You've got to admit, it's getting better ... a little better all the time.

The privilege of pressure 
"Pressure is a privilege." Billie Jean King, a pioneer in women's tennis, reportedly responded with this quotation when asked how it felt to be playing in her first U.S. Open. And it's true. Ifyou've got sweaty palms over an exam, a sporting event, a presentation, a concert or a project for which you're responsible, just remember, you've gotten this far Kate and people believe in you. Faced with Barrett the kind of pressure that interrupts 
FaithPoint
my sleep, churns my stomach, becomes a constant distraction, my first desire is usually just to disappear, or at least take a really long nap until it's all over and hope that someone else will pick up the slack for me. It takes a lot of extra effort and will to face that pressure and think of it as ­of all things! -aprivilege. 
My 10-year-old son just competed this past weekend in a regional swim meet that brought swimmers with low enough times to Columbus, Ohio from Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and West Virginia. He paced, he squirmed, he complained that we were late to meet his coach and teammates (we were half an hour early), he paced some more. From our seats up in the stands, we could see him on deck waiting for his events to start, still pacing and squirming. My first instinct was to try to pro­tect him, to believe that it was all too much for him. Then it occurred to me that he had come to the meet because he was fast enough to get there. He had worked hard enough; he had developed his God-given athletic ability. The pressure he felt was a privilege. 
You don't have to be THE best. Chances are, unless you're Albert Einstein or Leo Tolstoy or Michael Phelps, somebody else out there is better than you at whatever it is you do. You ought to try, however, to be YOUR best. Remember the parable of the talents from Chapter 25 of Matthew's gospel? A master, going on a journey, gave considerable sums of money to three of his servants ­five, two and one talents, each talent the equivalent of many years of wages-"to each according to his ability." While the first two each doubled the amount the master gave them, the third simply buried his master's money in the ground and waited for him to return. The master did­n't mind, Jesus tells us, that the servant with two talents made less than the one who started with five. Only the servant who did nothing at all, who took no initiative, angered the master. Do we take the risk, accept the chal­lenge to make the most of the gifts God has given us, though the pressure may make us sweat, or pace or squirm? 
You don't have to be doing the most important thing in the world to feel some well-deserved pressure. Maybe you're not discovering the cure for cancer or ending the war in Iraq or figuring out how no child will be left behind. OK, look at where you are and do something else that will help build up the Kingdom of God and better our world. Martin Luther King, Jr. once famously said, "If life makes you a street sweeper, be the best street sweeper you can be." 
Believe it or not, we're coming to the end of Lent. Palm Sunday is a mere ten days away. Imagine the pressure Jesus must have felt, facing hostility, anger, brutality, undeserved accusations, mockery and ultimately certain death. Even as he cried out to God to "let this cup pass from me," he recognized that his gift, his privilege, was to follow the will of his Father completely: "Yet not what I want but what you want." Perhaps we too can find in Jesus' experience, as we walk with him in these fmal days of Lent, the grace to follow the will of God in our own lives. And if exploring your own faith makes you squirm a little bit, ifit makes you uncomfortable, remem­ber that God has given you gifts you may not even know about yet. What a privilege. Make the most of it!

Spring break 2007 South Florida, uncensored 
When one thinks ofsweatshops, coun­tries such as China and India probably come to mind. Most people think sweat­shops in the United States do not exist; most people feel employee abuse and slav­
ery are long gone. Up  Kristofer

ago, I also shared  
these common  Guest Column  
American misconcep­ 

tions. This past spring break, I went on the Migrant Experiences Seminar in Immokalee, Fla., which was offered through the Center for Social Concerns. It was through this seminar that I was exposed to the harsh realities migrant workers face. 
Notre Dame, an institution that promotes Catholic social teaching, has previously taken initiative against large corporations that exploit employees. Many may remem­ber the Taco Bell boycotts that took place on campus several years ago. These boy­cotts were a large success due to nation­wide student involvement and activism. While this was a monumental step toward a fair wage for farm workers, it only marks the beginning. We as a Catholic community must continue to be advocates for social justice in every aspect oflife. 
The battle for migrant worker rights is still ongoing. While in Immokalee, I saw a community exploited in every possible way. For instance, most migrant workers must rent trailers which are often roach-and rat-infested-many do not even have elec­tricity or running water. According to an article published in Gulfshore Life Magazine, the cost for one ofthese trailers is roughly $500 per week. When I asked several people in the community about the cost of housing, they reaffirmed the over­charging. Due to the ridiculous pricing, people are forced to combine incomes to pay the rent; many 2-bedroom trailers have 10-16 occupants. This description is not solely based on interviews. For one of the nights I was in Immokalee, I stayed in one ofthese trailers. It was difficult seeing human beings forced to live in such a state while I attend a school with an endowment ofover $4 billion. 
Despite the Taco Bell boycott victory, stagnant wages and worker abuse are still prevalent in the fields. At wages of 40-45 cents per 32-lb. bucket of tomatoes picked -wages that have remained the same since 1979 -migrant workers earn signifi­cantly less than those at the poverty line. The very best workers only earn $50 for a full day's work. Taco Bell is only one pur­chaser of tomatoes. Pressure has been placed on other fast-food giants so that they too will increase the pay offarm workers and enforce a code ofconduct throughout their supply chain. McDonalds, the face of the industry and a main purchaser oftoma­toes in Immokalee, has refused to follow Taco Bell's footsteps. The migrant workers have united and are once again seeking allies. Notre Dame students have proven to be a very powerful force in the past; it is now time to continue where we left off. 
It is important to note that there is a dif­ference between charity and social justice. I do not wish for people to simply throw money at the problem and hope it fixes itself; that is not activism or social justice. 
These people are not looking for handouts; they want people to work with them to change a system ofexploitation. We need to become conscientious consumers so as not to promote situations of exploitation like those that I witnessed first-hand while on spring break. 
For those that want to take action, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers -a group ofmigrant workers that banded together several years ago in an effort to end unfair treatment -is organizing a rally at McDonalds' corporate headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill;, April13 and a parade in down­town Chicago April14. This is being done in an effort to send a clear message to McDonalds and other fast-food corpora­tions that exploitation is wrong.

In the spirit ofenergy conservation, which may be the most important way to avert human-caused global climate change, I suggest we turn off the skyward facing spot­lights that adorn the top ofthe main building and run all night. However impressed with ourselves we might like to feel on the frequent 2 a.m. journeys from the library to our residence hall, perhaps we can display our grandiosity by being an example of conservation in an America that needs a greener future.

When science looks at sex 
As a part ofthe Progressive Student Alliance's Week ofAction, Dr. Timothy Murphy will be speaking about the biology and ethics ofhomosexuality tonight at 8 p.m. in the Hesburgh Center Auditorium at the Kroc Institute for Peace Studies. Our views ofhuman sexuality are often influenced solely by religion or the norms ofour culture. Opinions rarely are informed by scientific, objective views. The discussion often is based on faith, but not reason. While I do not believe that science alone can answer all ofsociety's ques­tions, I am sure that it is a necessary part ofthe answer. Just as society asks clergy and theologians about homosexuality, society should also turn to scientists to provide their answers. I hope that Dr. Murphy's lecture will provide some answers to ethical questions about human sexuality research and offer a different perspective to the discussion.

MOVIE REVIEWS 

Greatest security 'Breach' investigated in new film 

Fathers," he holds his own against Cooper and delivers an effective, sensitive per­formance that draws audiences into his increasing fears and paranoia. Also look for notable performances by Gary Cole (better known as the boss from "Office Space") in a surprisingly well-crafted dra­matic turn as an FBI agent, as well as Laura Linney as the agent in charge of the investigation. 
"Breach" is only Ray's second film as director -the first was the similarly­themed "Shattered Glass," which was about real-life reporter Stephen Glass, who fabricated articles for several publi­cations. Ray, who wrote and directed "Shattered Glass" and directed "Breach," seems to be carving out a nice little niche for himself. Like Phillippe, he is quietly building a reputatuion as a talent worthy of greater exposure. 
Although the real Hanssen is locked away in Colorado's "supermax" peniten­tiary (where the Unabomber is also serv­ing his sentence), his actions still have ramifications in today's world. 
"Breach" isn't a perfect film, and its simple approach means that its scope and breadth is relatively modest, but it's still pertinent and enjoyable -and a chilling reminder of the evil that men can do.

Billy Ray's "Breach" tackles the internal investigation by the FBI to nail Hanssen as the perpetrator. Hanssen (Chris Cooper) is portrayed as a God-fearing loyal Catholic and, to the casual observer, it's hard to believe that he would be capable of betraying his country. 
Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe) is the fledg­ling FBI agent assigned to be Hanssen's assistant in an FBI attempt to garner inside information to solidify the belief Hanssen is a double agent. O'Neill then faces the difficult task of not only collect­ing information for his superior officers but also gaining the trust of Hanssen with­out arousing his suspicions. Since this is the assignment that could gain him full agent status, it is also the first time that he lives the life of an agent, which takes a toll 
By MARTY SCHROEDER 
Assistant Scene Editor 

"Breach" is a film that wants to be as taut as the older Cold War thrillers and tries to teach viewers lessons about contemporary global affairs. Unfortunately, it ultimately fails to achieve either goal. 
Everything about this film -except for perhaps Chris Cooper's perform­ance -is mediocre. The writing was nominally good -it wasn't horrible, but it didn't impress -and the cam­era, except for a few shots, was as stat­ic as a shoe 
carpet. 

Even though the film clocked in at only 110 minutes, it felt much longer due to the poor pacing and poor attempts at transition­ing from calm to tense moments. 

"Breach" tells the story of FBI agent Robert Hanssen, who sold government secrets to the Soviet Union for many years and was responsible for the largest security breach in the history of the United States. Cooper, one of the only bright spots in the film, plays Hanssen with gusto and relishes the role of the model American whom the audience knows is a traitor but whom the other characters think is, aside from being a little off kilter, a fine patriot. Cooper is one of the most ver­satile actors in Hollywood and this film, despite its poor technical aspects, allows him to showcase his skills. 
Director Billy Ray has written a few films in the past and directed one ­on both him and his wife Juliana (Caroline Dhavernas). 
It is interesting to get this perspective into an agent's personal life and how his job affects his family. Dhavernas gives an excellent performance as O'Neill's wife, who struggles to come to terms with his rising new position in the Bureau. 
"Breach" is a 
tense, taut and inter­
director and co-
screenwriter Billy Ray wisely decides to cut to the heart of the story, giving the film a lean, focused style that prevents it from flagging or feel­ing pretentious. 
That "Breach" is essentially a true story makes it even more compelling, and its insights into what could drive a man to betray his country are effective. There is a wonderful scene toward the end of the picture in which Hanssen tells another FBI agent that the "why" doesn't matter -this sums up the meaning of the film. Ray is not interested in cheap psychology, but rather in simply telling a story. 
Cooper is unabashedly the dominating presence in the film, perhaps granting Hanssen more depth and dimension than the real-life spy deserves. Alternately charismatic and terrifying (in almost equal measure), viewers get a sense of the disturbed and calculating mind behind Cooper's dark eyes. 
Phillippe is quietly making a case for himself as a great actor. Coming off of his outstanding performance in "Flags of Our 
2003's "Shattered Glass," starring the wooden Hayden Christensen. Although that film was well received by critics, the same success didn't transfer over to "Breach." Ray's pacing is stilted and, aside from a few genuinely tense moments, the movie has no heart. Ray can't decide whether he wants to feel sorry for Hanssen or condemn him. 
Ryan Phillippe and the rest of the cast play their roles well enough. They seem locked in the conspiracy of the film that leaves no room for character development. Cooper's Hanssen takes over the movie but does it in such a way that is excessive and borders on 
camp.

For a decent film that requires no attention to enjoy, see "Breach." However, "United 93" and "Independence Day" are better for films for examining serious and enter­taining threats to America, respective­ly. 
At least the latter know what they are. "Breach," unfortunately, just never figures it out.

Paranoia leads to thought-provoking situations 
Protection challenges privacy in a world rocked by terrorism 
I spent spring break in Europe with my roommates James and Adam. It was, in many ways, an eye-opening experience. One night, we decided to attend a show­ing of "Les Miserables" at the Queen's Theater in London. After spending the day exploring the city, we arrived at the theater for the evening's per­formance. 
After finding our seats, we went off to the bar to get some­thing to eat and drink. We sat there for maybe 20 minutes, after which they dimmed the lights and an announcement via speaker asked every­one to return to their seats. 
We noticed that there didn't appear to be very many people in our section, but didn't think much of it until we got to our seats. There, to our surprise, a secu­rity guard was holding a brown messen­ger bag. 
"That's my bag," said Adam. "This is yours?" asked the security guard. "Ticket please." Adam complied, and the guard shook his head angrily. 
"You oughtn't have left it unattended, you know -keep all your belongings with you at all times." 
The guard turned, and that's when we noticed that our section of the theater only appeared empty because the the­ater workers had held the occupants back while Adam's bag was investigated. After the guard gave the "OK," the patrons began to saunter back in, clearly annoyed with the inconvenience. 
A distinguished-looking couple-a middle-age English woman and a com­parably aged black man -sat next to us. 
"Was that your bag?" asked the man, with more than a hint of disdain. "You oughtn't have left it alone." 
"I know," Adam said. "I didn't think anything of it." "Don't you know it might've been a bomb?" 
"Why would someone put a bomb here?" I asked. The man gave me his best "stupid Americans" look. 
"What do you mean 'why'?" he said. "I mean, it doesn't make any sense ... " I started. "Of course it doesn't make any sense," he snapped. "Terrorists bringing bombs

on the tube and blowing up half the city doesn't make any sense either, does it?" 
He had clearly misinterpreted my question -when I said "here" I was referring to the 20-pound nosebleed cheap seats in the second balcony where we were sitting, not the theater as a general statement. 
"It may not make sense to you and it certainly doesn't make sense to me, but that's the way it is," the man continued breathlessly. "People blowing each other up in the tubes. And for what? Some kind of political or religious statement? Senseless." · 
I leaned back and decided not to remind him that we were about to watch a show that featured students violently barricading the streets as a political statement. 
By the next day, I had largely forgotten the previous night's little fiasco, except as a humorous -and no doubt embar­rassing to Adam-anecdote. That evening we rode on a crowded tube toward Piccadilly Circus when we noticed an unattended suitcase. It was brown and tattered, with the name "OBAMA" etched on the top and some writing in a language I didn't recognize on the side. The three of us regarded the seemingly abandoned case and I felt the hairs on the back of my neck slowly rise. 
"What do you think?" whispered Adam. 
"I don't know," I said. "Don't touch it." 
We looked around for a potential owner, but the closest occupants were an elderly woman and a British couple cradling a child. I started to back away from the case, slowly edging myself toward the other end of the tube -not that it would have really mattered had the case really contained a bomb. 
"It's all right," I said to Adam. "Don't say anything." 
"Let's get off at the next stop," recom­mended James. Adam and I nodded in agreement, nervously waiting out the tube's bumpy approach to its next desti­nation. 
Finally, James decided it wasn't worth waiting and loudly inquired if the case belonged to anyone. A man, sitting across the tube, claimed ownership, say­ing simply, "It's mine." 
We all breathed out and remained on the tube until our final destination, but I know that for me a full sense of relief only came when I stepped off the tube at Piccadilly Circus. 
Afterward, we were all embarrassed. What a silly, paranoid, senseless turn of

NFL 
Goodell to address off-field problems 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -NFL commis­sioner Hoger Goodell could announce new initiatives Tuesday that will allow him to impose harsher and quicker discipline for players who get into trouble off the field. 
League spokesman Greg Aiello said Wednesday during a conference call that Goodell eould use his first full league meeting, to be held next week in Phoenix, to address the arrests and other off-field episodes that plagued the league in the last year. 
They include the arrests of nine members of the Cincinnati Bengals; 1 0 encounters with the police by Tennessee's Adam "Paeman" Jones; the four­month jail sentence imposed this week on Chicago's Tank Johnson on weapons charges; and other run-ins with the law by NFL players. 
The policy would allow Goodell. who has been meeting with players, owners and team oflicials, to impose harsher dis­cipline earlier than in the past, when the NFL has waited for legal steps to be finished before imposing fines and/or suspen­sions. 
"What's important to him in developing this policy is that it is supported by a wide faction of people in our league, mean­ing the owners, the players' association, the players and the dubs," Aiello said. "He's been very encouraged by the strong stance that the players have taken in terms of looking for a more effective policy." 
Most of the conference call was devoted to recommenda­tions for changes in playing rules made by the competition committee. 
The biggest change would be moving the kickoff in overtime from the 30-yard-line, the spot in regulation, to the 35. 
Atlanta general manager Hich McKay, the committee's co­chairman, said the committee believed the kickoff spot was the major reason that that 62 percent of teams winning the coin toss won overtime games last season, not necessarily on the first possession, but because of the field position they got. McKay said it stemmed from the change in 1998 that moved the kickoff back to the 30 and added the "K-ball," a kicking ball harder to kick deep. 
Until then, winners and losers of the toss had won just about equally. 
"This is something we resis­ted," McKay said. "But there was an advantage gained by the coin toss. We think we can cure those stats and make the coin toss less of a factor." 
The rule would have to be approved by three-quarters of the teams, as would a variety of other proposed rules changes. 
One would make instant replay, which is due to expire after two more seasons, a per­manent part of the league's rules. 
NCAA BASKETBALL 
Volunteers will hope to contain Oden, OSU 
Associated Press 
SAN ANTONIO -Tennessee's Bruce Pearl is far too good of a talker to frame his team's upcoming game against Ohio State in worn-out coachspeak. 
So when he essentially says "it's not Greg Oden, it's the rest of the Buckeyes" that he's focused on containing Thursday night, at least give him the ben­efit of the doubt and listen to his explanation. 
Start with the background. 
The Volunteers faced Ohio State in Oden's 1Oth game of the season, back in January, when Oden was adjusting to the col­lege game and still wearing a brace on the surgically repaired right wrist that delayed the start of his college career. 
Those things were supposed to be holding him down. Instead, he had his first monster game: 24 points, 15 rebounds, perfect from the foul line (6-for­6), four assists, three blocks and a steal in 36 minutes. 
Yet the Buckeyes, playing at home, still needed what was then a career-high in points from freshman point guard Mike Conley and a 3-pointer from Hon Lewis with 11.2 sec­onds left to beat the Volunteers 68-66. 
Ohio State (32-3) hasn't lost since, a run of 19 in a row it takes into a semifinal against Tennessee (24-1 0) in the NCAA tournament's South Hegional. 
Pearl spent this week studying his team's near-miss in Columbus and most of the other 18 games in the Buckeyes' run. After concluding there's no stop­ping Oden -"He's unlike any­body I've ever gone up against," Pearl said -he set his sights on everyone else wearing red and white. 
And the part that scares him the most? 
'They've not broken out yet," Pearl said. "They've not had that breakout game that we all know they're capable of." 
Buckeyes coach Thad Matta was flattered by the notion his top-seeded team has gotten within four wins of a national championship by merely grind­ing out games. 
However, he agrees that his team can do whatever it takes to win, as opposed to being a juggernaut that goes out and does things its way, daring oth­ers to stop it. 
"The thing I love about this team is we've shown that we can play a lot of different ways," Matta said, listing a few exam­ples -not including the over­time win against Xavier in the second round that kept Ohio State in the tournament. 


NCAA BASKETBALL 

Howland, Dixon vvill square off in Sweet 16 

Associated Press SAN JOSE, Calif. -The almost daily phone calls haven't stopped this week even though Ben Howland and Jamie Dixon will be on opposite sides of the court Thursday night. It's hard to break a routine built through decades of friendship. The only change in the coaches' relationship is what they discuss. Talking about strategy, and their teams' strengths and weak­nesses has to take a back seat at least until after Thursday night's third-round game between Howland's UCLA Bruins and Dixon's Pittsburgh Panthers in the San Jose RegionaL "I think it's inevitable it was going to happen," Dixon said Wednesday. "It hasn't changed [our relationship] at all. We've talked a couple of times, not too much about the game, just about families and different things 

besides that." 
Whether the relationship has an impact on which team advances to Saturday's regional final remains to be seen. 
"I think it's pretty unique and pretty interesting," Bruins point guard Darren Collison said. "But again, to me it won't be about the coaches. It will be about the play­ers on the court. That's what will dictate who wins the game. The coaches will just do their job and that's just to coach and tell us what plays to run." 
That's one area that will provide at least a little bit of a wrinkle since the Panthers (29-7) still use many of the same plays they ran before Howland left for UCLA (28­
5) following the 2002-03 season. 
But with scouting and the use of video what they are in the mod­em game, Howland thinks it will be just like playing any other team.

NFL 


Associated Press 
Houston -The Houston 
Texans are close to acquir­
ing Matt Schaub from the 
Atlanta Falcons. 
A trade for the highly 
regarded backup quarter­
back was expected to be 
announced Thursday, 
according to a person with 
knowledge of the deal who 
requested anonymity 
because the deal hadn't 
been completed. 
The person did not dis­
close the details of the 
trade. The Houston 
Chronicle and the NFL 
Network said the Falcons 
will get second-round 
picks in 2007 and 2008 
and that the teams will 

swap first-round picks this year, with Atlanta moving from 10th to eighth. 
A call by The Associated Press to Texans general manager Rick Smith was­n't immediately returned Wednesday. Rich McKay, Atlanta's general manager, had no comment. 
"Matt's a restricted free agent," McKay, chairman of the NFL's competition committee, said during a conference call with national reporters in preparation for next week's league meetings. "He's clearly entitled to visit every team. We've talked to a number of teams that have interest in Matt. That's all I'm going to say." 
Houston television sta­tion KRIV reported on it's Web site that Schaub and agent Joby Branion arrived at Houston's George Bush Interconti­nental Airport on Wednesday. 
"We have an agreement in place," Branion told KRIV. "I dealt with Rick Smith on Ahman Green a couple of weeks ago. That gave us a great deal of comfort heading into these discussions believing we could get something done and we did. It wasn't easy but I think both sides are comfortable with where we are." 
Schaub, who has per­
formed well in preseason games, has started two games in his three-year career and is 84-of-161 for 1,033 yards with six touch­downs and six intercep­tions. 
The acquisition of Schaub would make the possibility David Carr will remain with the team seem unlikely. Unhappy with Carr's performance, Houston tried to sign both Jeff Garcia and Patrick Ramsey before the two signed with other teams. 
The Texans hoped that Carr, the first pick in the 2002 draft, would have a breakout year under the tutelage of first-year coach Gary Kubiak. 
IN BRIEF 
Artest faces four counts of 
misdemeanors after arrest 
SACRAMENTO -Sacramento Kings forward Ron Artest faces four misdemeanor charges stemming from a dispute with his wife at home earlier this month. 
The charges were filed late Tuesday. Placer County Deputy District Attorney Dan Quick said Artest will be arraigned Thursday on charges of battery and corporal injury to a spouse, false imprison­ment and dissuading a witness from reporting a crime.

The former Indiana Pacer was arrested March 5 at his estate in Loomis, 25 miles northeast of Sacramento, and was released from custody after posting a $50,000 bond.

Illinois won't discipline AD 
after incident 
CHAMPAIGN -The University of Illinois will not discipline athletic director Ron Guenther for yelling at men's basketball coach Bruce Weber and Illini players during the team's NCAA Tournament loss Friday. 
Guenther yelled substitution advice to Weber -who was just a few feet away -and also yelled "Warren -you idiot" after a play by Illini forward Warren Carter, according to a report on CBS Sportsline.com. Guenther also pounded the table throughout Illinois' 54-52 loss to Virginia Tech in Columbus, Ohio. 
Richard Herman, chancellor at the Urbana-Champaign campus, said Wednesday that Guenther -in his 15th year as AD at Illinois -would not be disciplined. He said Guenther had apologized to Weber and Carter. 
The outbursts happened because Guenther is a fan, Herman said.

Salukis hope to upset Jayhavvks 
Associated Press 
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) ­Rodrick Stewart waited patient­ly for the perfect shot, slipping through a crowd and moving behind a screen before letting it fly. 
The meatball-sized wad of paper flew over a cameraman and hit Kansas teammate Mario Chalmers in the chest while he answered questions in the locker room. The Jayhawks' leading scorer in the NCAA tournament didn't even dangle a participle, coolly fin­ishing his conversation to his laughing teammates' delight. 
The top-seeded Jayhawks seemed remarkably stress-free on a cool Wednesday in California, one day before meeting Southern Illinois in the West Regional semifinals. 
Sure, expectations are still huge for everybody in this proud program. But after embarrassing first-round exits in the past two tournaments, Kansas feels fortunate simply to be planning for a second weekend and beyond. 
And even facing the fourth­seeded Salukis' intense defense couldn't bow their shoulders. 
"After last year, we waited a long time to get this chance," said coach Bill Self, who has led three schools to nine straight NCAA tournament appear­ances, including four at Kansas. "In a weird way, and not in a good way, I think the

failures last year prepared us for this year. We don't really see the (No.) 1 seed as pressure any more. Everybody is here for a reason." 
While the Jayhawks (32-4) got to San Jose with an up­tempo offense that bested Florida, Southern California and most of the Big 12 Conference, Southern Illinois (29-6) is built to neutralize the nation's best offensive talent­and Kansas has more than its share. 
Brandon Rush and his 
Kansas teammates have watched tape of the trapping, aggressive style with which the Salukis yielded just 56.1 points per game -the third-fewest among 336 Division I teams this season. Kansas can't recall facing a better defensive team, yet nobody in .layhawk blue seemed distressed. 
"The way they trap. the way they get through a screen, they're like piranhas," said Rush, who scored 19 points in the Jayhawks' second-round win over Kentucky. 

Motivated Florida ready for Bulldogs 
Billy Donovan leads the defending champs against 5-seed Butler 
Associated Press 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. -lie's been "Oflicer Bill," a history pro­fessor, a tour guide, a father fig­urn and even a friend. 
lie's been way mom than just a coach. 
Billy Donovan has been a mas­ter motivator for top-seeded Florida, inspiring players with championship rings, famous dads and NBA futures to play hard, stay focused, follow his "live in the moment" catch-phase and possibly become the first team in 15 years to successfully defend its title. 
lie's kept the Gators hungry and humble while dealing with ofl'-the-chart expectations, outside influences and the constant pres­sure of trying to make history. 
"Sometimes when you hear the word motivation, people think it's a rah-rah speech every day," Donovan said. "I think there's dif­ferent ways to motivate people and to inspire people. I would say that I spend every single day try­ing to do that." 
Florida (31-5), which plays fifth-seeded Butler {29-6) on Friday in the Midwest Hegional in St. Louis. has won 14 consecutive postsea­son games and cut down live sets of nets in the past 11 months. 

Aside from having live talented, unselfish and experienced starters, a big key has been Donovan's motivational tactics. 
He's invited big-name sports celebrities to speak to the Gators -a list that includes NBA legend Jerry West, New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick and St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Hussa. 
He's shown clips from movies and sporting events in hopes of providing inspiration. He's told stories about all-time greats like Muhammad Ali, Michael Jordan, Pete Sampras and Tiger Woods. 
He even brought in ronowned sociology professor Harry Edwards, widely considered the leading expert on issues of race and sports. 
"{Edwards) talked about push­ing the ball back up the hill," for­ward Corey Brewer said. "You can't push it up the same way, and you've all got to go up togeth­er. It's time to get together and go back up the hill." 
Belichick made an encore appearance two weeks ago after florida won a third consecutive conference tournament.

Men1phis, Aggies vvill play in Texas shootout 
Associated Press 
SAN ANTONIO -Some Texas A&M students wore paper bags over their heads during Acie Law's freshman season, embar­rassed to be rooting for a team that didn't win a conference game. 
Now, Aggies fans are decked out in maroon shirts, eager to be part of what Law and his teammates are doing. 
For Memphis (32-3), the No. 2 seed in the NCAA South Regional, that means once again playing in front of a parti­san crowd despite have a better seed. 
"I would have never imagined playing in San Antonio with the Sweet 16 with the opportunity to go to the Elite Eight after what I experienced by fresh­man year," Law said Wednesday. "Coach came in and he changed all our mind­sets. He told us we were going to win, and not take as long as people thought." 
That's exactly what the Aggies have done under Billy Gillispie, going from that 0-16 record in the Big 12 to the NCAA round of 16 and a school­record 27 victories only three seasons later. 
And Texas A&M won't be far from home Thursday night for its first regional semifinal game since 1980. The game will be in the Alamodome, only about a 2 1/2-hour drive from campus. 
When the Aggies finished their open practice, the players greeted and shook hands with fans, many who chanted Law's name. 
A crowd of more than 30,000 is expected Thursday, mostly in A&M colors. If the Aggies (27 -6) win, there might not be another color visible for the regional final this weekend -much like when Texas won a regional final in the same building four years ago. 
"It may be able to help you get over a couple of tough spots in the games, but it won't be the ultimate determining fac­tor," Gillispie said. "We learned that last weekend, and every­body is coming here for a rea­son. Everyone is coming here to win."

basket with 7. 7 seconds left to send Air Force to the NIT semifinals with a 52-51 win over DePaul on Wednesday night. 
Draelon Burns, who scored 18 points and had five 3­pointers, rimmed out a 3­pointer from the right corner at the buzzer after Burtschi missed a free throw following his layup, and the usually sub­dued crowd at Clune Arena stormed the court, their Falcons headed to the NIT Final Four and "New York, New York" playing over the loud speakers. 
The Falcons (26-8), top seeded in the West, play South Region top seed Clemson in the semifinals on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden in New York. Mississippi State will face West Virginia in the other semifinal. 
Matt McCraw also scored 13 points for the Falcons, who nearly saw their 33-game 

home winning streak against nonconference opponents snapped. 
Clemson 74, Syracuse 70 
K.C. Rivers had a career­high 29 points and the Tigers bounced the Orange at Littlejohn Coliseum. 
It was the Tigers (24-10) 
ninth straight NIT victory at 
home. But this one did not -come easily. 
Syracuse (24-11) cut Clemson's 17-point lead to 69­68 on Demetris Nichols' tip-in with 19.8 seconds left. However, Rivers, the team's best free-throw shooter, hit a pair of foul shots to extend the lead. 
Josh Wright's open 3-pointer 
with about 10 seconds left 
bounced off the rim and into 
the arms of Tiger guard Vern 
Hamilton. 
Hamilton followed with two 
foul shots to clinch the victory 
-and Clemson's first trip to 
Madison Square Garden since 
1999. 
Then, the Tigers were sec­ond to champ Cal. This time, they can keep a curious streak alive for the Palmetto State as they try and become the third straight South Carolina team -the Gamecocks won the past two NITs -to hold the trophy. 
MLB -SPRING TRAINING 

Sosa, Rangers fall to slugger's former squad 
Associated Press 
When Sammy Sosa stepped to the plate, he looked out to see Cubs starter Jason Marquis wearing the slugger's old No. 21. 
This was definitely not an average spring day for Sosa in his return with the Texas Rangers after a year away from the game. 
Sosa got a mixed greeting Wednesday from a large crowd of 11,674 at HoHoKam Park, where he spent so many spring afternoons during his 13 sea­sons with the Cubs. 
"You know, regardless, no matter where I play, my heart is always going to be in Chicago," Sosa said. 
"I don't think anyone's going to take my name away from Chicago.... My name is always going to mentioned in Chicago." 
Sosa went 1-for-3 in his return. to Mesa, Ariz., and the Cubs beat the Rangers 11-7 on Daryle Ward's grand slam in the bottom of the ninth inning off Jesse Ingram. 
Starting in right field, Sosa grounded into a forceout, legged out an infield single and hit a hopper that took a wild bounce before Cubs shortstop Ronny Cedeno reached up and made a nice play before throw­ing him out. Sosa's still batting .410 this spring. 
How did the fans in right field treat him? He used to be their darling, an entertainer when he played the position in Chicago. 
"Great," he said. 
j 

Did they yell at him? 
"In my favor, yes," he said. 
"He deserves good things from the fans. He did a lot of good things in Chicago," Cubs pitcher Carlos Zambrano said. 
Sosa hit 545 of .his 588 homers with the Cubs. How big a deal are the 12 homers that would land him at the 600 land­mark? He actually wants more. 
'Tm not going to get in shape for 12 home runs. I'm going to go out there and play. It's going to happen," said Sosa, who also wears No. 21 with the Rangers. 'Tm thinking I'm not satisfied. More than that." 
White Sox 10, Giants 9 
At Tucson, Ariz., Bobby Jenks' ERA ballooned to 10.50 for his five spring games after he allowed three runs and three hits in two innings. White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said he is concerned about his clos­er. 
"I worry about Bobby. If you are not ready one week and a half before the season starts, you have problems," Guillen said. "If you are not ready to this point, and you are not in condition to start the season right now, you have to dig in and start pushing yourself to get better." 
Red Sox 7, Pirates 3 
At Bradenton, Fla., Daisuke Matsuzaka allowed one run and one hit in 5 2-3 innings. The Red Sox right-hander struck out seven and got a standing ovation when he left the game.

TRACK AND FIELD 
ND finally heads outside 
By BILL BRINK Sports Writer 
Notre Dame travels to Tucson, Ariz., today to compete in the Jim Click Multi-Events/Shootout. The meet, which lasts until Saturday, is Notre Dame's first outdoor competition of the season. 
After an indoor season that cul­minated in two All-America per­formances in the NCAA Championships, the Irish are making the transition to outdoor competition. Training and com­peting outside allows the team to practice skills it hasn't worked on before and offers a break from the monotony of the Loftus Center. 
"The men and women in the 4­by-1 00-meter [relays) will do baton exchanges which basically we did not do at all at the begin­ning of the indoor season," Irish coach Joe Piane said. "And frankly, just getting outdoors is a joy." 
The outdoor track is 400 meters long, twice as long as the standard indoor track. The length of the track could decrease the times posted by the runners. 
"In theory, it should be faster because the turns are so spa­cious," Piane said. "Indoors it's a little tight, but outdoors the radius is much larger." 
Some events during the indoor season change once the team moves out<>ide, and some events don't exist during the indoor sea­son. The discus and javelin throws and the 400 hurdles are exclusively outdoor events. Also, the 60-meter hurdles becomes the 100 hurdles for women and 110 hurdles for men. 
"You take a discus thrower or a javelin thrower, they're waiting all season just to get outdoors," Piane said. "So they've been training from September on just to get to the outdoor season." 

The Shootout, which is primari­ly an individual meet, will give coaches a chance to see how ath­letes who have not yet competed handle their first meet. 
''I'm really anxious to see what [freshman) Balazs Molnar does in the 400 meter hurdles. He was one of the best intermediate hur­dlers in Europe last year, so I'm really anxious to see what he can do during the outdoor season," Piane said. ''I'm anxious to see what [freshman] Jaclyn Espinoza can do in the discus. She's throw­ing well already, but let's see how well she can do." 
Piane said he also excited to see how throwers, including junior Kyle Annen and senior Garet Koxlien, perform in their first competition of the season. Annen's best hammer throw of the 2006 outdoor season was 
61.46 meters at the Big East Championships. Koxlien's season­best discus throw for the 2006 season came at the CalPoly Invitational, where he threw for 
51.52 meters. 
''I'm anxious to see how the people who don't have the oppor­tunity to do those event<> start off the season," he said.

NO SOFTBALL 

ND to play first home game 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 
Notre Dame plays its first game of the year at Ivy Field tonight. 
After going 9-12 against stiff competition over the past four weeks, the Irish take on IUPUI in a final tune-up before starting conference play this weekend. 
The Jaguars got off to a very slow start this year, losing their first 11 contests. However, IUPUI worked out the kinks last week­end at the Rebel Games in Kissimee, Fla., and went 5-1 in the tournament. The turnaround included a 10-0 rout against Army and a thrilling come-from­behind 6-5 win over Fairleigh Dickinson in extra innings. 
Sophomore pitcher Breanna Howell, who will most likely start for the Jags tomorrow, picked up the win in both contests. Howell leads the team with a 4-3 record and an ERA of 4.03. The only other IUPUI pitcher to pick up a win on the season is senior Angelica Espinosa. 
The Jaguars have made just one trip to Notre Dame in the program's history in 1999 ­IUPUI came away with a 2-1 vic­tory in nine innings. 
This time around the Irish are a bit more accustomed to picking up wins late in close games. Notre Dame is 3-1 in one-run games, with all three of those wins coming in walk -off fashion. 
The Irish bats have struggled recently scoring only four runs in the past five games including shutout losses to Pacific, No. 8 Texas and No. 2 Arizona State. The IUPUI pitching staff should help the Notre Dame hitters get back on track after facing pow­erhouses from some of the top programs in the country. 


The Irish have been without their leading hitter, senior out­fielder Stephanie Brown, during the five-game slump. Brown was injured during practice when a ground ball took a bad hop and caught her just below the nose. Prior to the injury, she was hit­ting .440 with 15 runs scored from the leadoff position. 
Since Brown went down, Notre Dame has turned to its pitching staff to try to bail the team out. Sophomore hurler Brittany Bargar currently leads the team with a 2.77 ERA, but her record has dropped to 6-7 with tough losses to the Sun Devils, Longhorns and No. 16 Louisiana-Lafayette all in the past week. 
Bargar will look to get back to the .500 mark with a win over the Jaguars tonight. 
Tonight's game is the first of five that Notre Dame will play this weekend at home. The Irish have doubleheaders scheduled against St. John's Saturday and Seton Hall Sunday. Saturday's matchup will mark the begin­ning of Big East play as Notre Dame attempts to defend its 2006 conference championship.

that gets you fired up," Pollock said. "Hitting i'i contagious." 
Lilley lit the fire under the Notre Dame bats with a single as the team entered the bottom of the fourth with the 5-3 lead. The eight­run inning inducted two-run singles from Lilley, Jeremy Barnes and Ryne Intlekofer as well an unearned run apiece from Polloek and senior Danny Dressman. 
Notre Dame coach Dave Schrage said Lilley serves an important leadership role. 
"Brett is so consistent," he said. "I Ie comes everyday to the ballpark with a great attitude and works hard-you win a lot of games with Brett Lilley. Every time he comes he's giving everything he's got." 
The Irish extended their lead to 15-4 in the bottom of the sixth as freshman Austin Pearce drove in an RBI offhi<> first career hit. 
Western Michigan threatened in the top of the eighth but was unable to dose in on the Irish lead. Freshman right-hander Steven Mazur gave up a two-run homer to Kyle Galbraith and a one-run single to Matt Abro before retiring from the mound. 
Sophomore right-hander Brett Graffy took over in the middle of the inning. Bronco Kyle Gendron drove in one run off an error to close out the inning and bring Western Michigan within six. Those four runs would fmd the ommsive game for the Broncos. 
Cycling through two pitchers in one inning happened often during the offense-focused game. Sophomore left-hander Sam Elam started the game for the Irish. Grafly threw two innings from the mound and Andrew Scheid, Tony Langford and David Mills tallied an inning apiece -Mazur only saw action in the first part of the eighth inning. Tim Mowry started from the mound for Western Michigan, pitching 2.2 innings before the Broncos brought in six pitchers from their bullpen. 
Using many pitchers in the mid­week non-conference game allowed Notre Dame and Western Michigan to rest their arms, since both teams play in conference series thi<> weekend. 
The Irish responded to Western Michigan's drive in the eighth with two runs in the bottom of the inning. Schrage noted the team's ability to respond from behind the plate every time Western Michigan drew closer. 
"I think our guys did a great job of answering back when Western Michigan would score," he said. "I was very happy with how we hit the ball long." 
Even though the Broncos responded with strong offensive innings, Pollock said, the Irish were confident they would respond. 
"We kept battling. We didn't put up runs in just one inning, so that always keeps you into the game more," he said. "And I think that carried over toward defense too ­a game like [Western Michigan] kept everybody on their toes and rnady for the next pitch." 
Notre Dame sealed the win with a no-run ninth-inning. Schrage said the team hopes to stay strong from behind the plate and tune up defensively as it prepares for its weekend series against South Florida. The Irish will look for strong showings from Lilley and Pollock again as they face tougher competition from the mound. 
"Right now [Pollock's] as hot as anybody and hopefully that will continue," Schrage said.

Irish jump out to early lead, cruise to 16-9 win over OSU 
By MICHAEL BRYAN Sports Writer 
After several straight games of overcoming an early deficit, the Irish finally got the start they were looking for Wednesday, jumping out to a 9-1 halftime lead and beating Ohio State 16-9 at the Loftus 

the year, with nine different players scoring points on the match. Sophomore Jane Stoeckert and senior Meghan Murphy led the way with four points each. Junior Caitlin McKinney and senior Lena Zentgraf also netted three goals apiece in the victory. 
"It was a total team effort," Coyne said. "We do everything

Slahor led the Buckeyes with three goals, and six different Ohio State players netted one goal on the game. 
The Irish dominated posses­sion offensively and defensive­ly, out-shooting the Buckeyes 33-14. 
home for the Irish in almost a month -was moved from Moose Krause Stadium indoors to the Loftus Center earlier in the week due to weather concerns. 
Next up for the Irish is a Big East matchup with Loyola in Baltimore. The Greyhounds have struggled this season and have a 1-5 record after Wednesday. 
The match is the Big East opener for Loyola, while the Irish are 0-1 in Big East play after a loss to Syracuse Sunday. 
The Irish improved to 6-2 on the season with the win, while Ohio State dropped to 3-2.

Regional. Former Irish standout Alicja Kryczalo won the women's foil competition and then-sopho­more Patrick Ghattas collected the men's sabre crown. Two weeks ago, two new Notre Dame fencers -freshman epeeist Kelley Hurley and sophomore foilist Adi Nott­captured titles in the regional com­petition at the Joyce Center. 
"I know there's going to be a lot of different competitors," Nott said, comparing her expectations of this weekend's event to the Midwest Regional. "I want to fence better than I have [this year]." 
Ghattas, now a senior and three­time All-American, will compete at the NCAAs after a third-place fin­ish in the Regional March 10. Ghattas has finished second at Nationals two years in a row. 
The competition begins today with round-robin competition on the men's side. Further men's rounds and direct elimination fol­low on Friday. The women start fencing on Saturday before finish­ing Sunday, when the NCAA awards one national championship for a team's combined men's and women's performances. Notre Dame finished fourth in 2006. 
Irish senior Valerie Providenza will look to become the first Notre Dame women's sabreist ever to earn All-American status four straight seasons. She won the indi­vidual crown as a freshman before finishing fourth in 2005 and ninth in 2006. 
Providenza will be joined in her weapon by sophomore Ashley Serrette, who is making a home­coming of sorts. The sophomore native of Orange, N.J., earned a bid in the NCAAs with a sixth-place finish at the regional competition. (Ohio State had three fencers in the top five, but NCAA rules limit teams to two entries in each weapon per gender.) 
This weekend's competition will be the flrst NCAA Championship action for five of Notre Dame's 11 fencers. Serrette, Hurley, junior epeeist Greg Howard, sophomore foilist Emilie Prot and sophomore sabreist Bill Thanhouser will be making their championship debuts. 
Hurley, who has dropped only four bouts all season, represents Notre Dame's best chance at a vic­tory from the first-timers. 
Among the returning competi­tors, Nott finished sixth in the NCAAs as a freshman, while junior foilist Jakub Jedrkowiak placed seventh in 2005 and eighth in 2006. Last season, sophomore epeeist Karol Kostka and sopho­more foilist Mark Kubik fmished 18th and 21st, respectively.

won all six matches in straight sets. 
Saint Mary's now boasts a 5-4 overall record, alongside its lone win in the MIAA in its first match. Olivet's setback now leaves it at 1-2 in the MIAA with an overall record of 4-3 on the season. 
Prior to the match, senior Kelly McDavitt spoke about last week's play and its effect on the season. 
"We all learned a lot from our match play experience," she said. "I think our team is ready for the sea­son. We all have the potential to per­form well on the courts. We have the mindset of being focused and work­ing hard. Every ball with a pur­pose." 
Starting the match from the No. 1 spot, McDavitt defeated Olivet senior Rachel Vilums 6-1, 6-0. From the No. 2 spot, freshman Camille Gebert overcame Comets sophomore Jaclyn Mummaw 6-2, 6-3. 
In the third match of the day, Saint Mary's sophomore Mary Campbell beat Olivet junior Abbie Utberg in the first set 6-3, but then finished off the match with an overpowering 6-0 set. Belles freshman Usa Rubino faced freshman Celeste Gruber from the fourth spot and won 6-1, 6-2 in a consistent performance. 
Belles senior Tara O'Brien earned a victory for Saint Mary's in the fifth spot with her steady showing over Olivet senior Jaime Morrison. O'Brien conceded two games in the first set, 6-2, but then blanked her opponent in the final set, putting the contest away. 
In the final match of singles play, Saint Mary's junior Cassie Quaglia defeated Lindsey Struble, a fellow junior, 6-3, 6-3, finalizing the Belles' sweep over Olivet in singles play. 
With the match already decided, Saint Mary's didn't let up. In the first match of doubles play, McDavitt and Gebert extended their doubles win­ning streak to six, defeating Olivet's pairing of senior Mallory Bailey and Vilums8-5. 
From the second spot in doubles play, the Belles continued winning, this time thanks to Campbell and Lisa Rubino, who earned an 8-5 vic­tory over Olivet's Utberg and Mummaw. 
In what was shaping out to be a clean sweep, the Belles slipped for the first and only time against the Comets doubles team of senior Corey Jager and Struble. O'Brien and Belles senior Grace Gordon weren't able to overcome an 8-4 performance from the Olivet duo. 
Freshman standout Gebert spoke about the uneasiness prior to the match and team's potential. 
"It was nice to get our first confer­ence match out of the way. I think that everyone's nerves were racing, but we pulled through as a team," Gebert said. "There is something special about our team this year -I think that we have the potential to go very far. It will all depend on our heart."

day. It'll be [No. 4 seniors] Christian and Catrina Thompson, and after that we still don't know," Louderback said. "Katie Potts will step into the doubles ... but we don't know the combinations yet." 
Louderback said Tefft, Potts and freshmen Cosmina Ciobanu and Kali Krisik would be in the doubles mix. 
No. 19 Catrina Thompson will lead the Irish out of the No. 1 singles slot. She has a 13-3 dual-match record and has won her last four, includ­ing a 6-0, 6-3 win Saturday over No. 31 Blakeley Griffith of Tennessee. 
Catrina Thompson will take the No. 2 slot and try to rebound after dropping all three of her matches last week. 
The other nationally ranked singles player for Notre Dame is No. 62 Ciobanu, who has a perfect 16-0 dual match record out of the No. 5 slot. Ciobanu slid 31 spots from the last set of rankings, but Louderback said that is to be expected with the automated nature of the computer rank­ings. 
"The problem is if you aren't playing No. 1 or No. 2, you can drop fast because you don't get points for play­ing there," he said. "Now, they went to the computer two weeks earlier than nor­mal, so the rankings, espe­cially the team will be adjust­ing a lot each week. Florida jumped ahead of us and we're tied with Stanford and I think the top four in the team rankings have really separat­ed themselves."

Beginning

Quinn, two top receivers in Rhema McKnight and All­American Jeff Samardzija, three-year workhorse Darius Walker at running back and three offensive lineman, position battles for the top spot on the depth chart will shape the spring. 
At signal-caller, the battle will feature three returning players -rising junior Evan Sharpley and rising sophomores Zach Frazer and Demetrius Jones. But the most intriguing storyline is the arrival of high school star Jimmy Clausen, one of three early-enrolling freshmen. 
Weis said he hopes to cut the competition for the starting job down to two by the end of spring practice, with the top candidates vying for the job once summer camp starts in August. He said he would focus his attention "heavily -almost exclusively" on the quarterback battle as Corwin Brown installs the new 3-4 personnel defense. 
''I've set this up where every­one will get their fair chance to show that they can run the team," Weis said. 
Frazer said his strengths are in leadership and size -he's the biggest of the group at 6-foot-4 and 226 pounds. 
"Each of us is very different, but I think my skills and my tal­ents definitely bring something to the table," Frazer said. "The competition's going to get tough but I'm working towards trying to get one of those two spots." 
Jones said the competition is open both in terms of informa­tion and candidates. 

"Coming into spring we all know the expectations on the field as well as off the field," he said. "There's not any hidden secrets about the responsibility we're going to have to take on, there's not any secrets period." 
But then there's the question of to whom who the new quar­terback will be throwing. 
Weis said rising junior David Grimes, the No. 3 wideout last fall, would be the top receiver to start the spring. Grimes, a 6­foot, 174-pound speedster, underwent an undisclosed sur­gery after the Sugar Bowl in January. 
"A couple days before spring break, when I said, 'If I don't see him go full-speed, he's not going on spring break,' he ran around great," Weis said with a laugh. "So from what I saw right before spring break, I have very high expectations." 
Weis said he talked to Grimes about successful wideouts in the NFL whose heights were shorter than the prototypical receiver frame, including former New York Jet Wayne Chrebet and current New England Patriot Troy Brown. 
"I've talked to him about a bunch of guys that I've coached in the past that have not been the biggest in stature that have been very, very, very productive and productive as in the lead roles," Weis said. 
But after Grimes, even more questions remain. 
Behind Grimes are rising jun­ior D.J. Hord, who is fully healthy after missing all of 2006 with a torn Achilles tendon, ris­ing sophomore George West, who enrolled early a year ago, and classmates Richard Jackson and Robby Parris, the tallest receivers on the Irish roster at 6­foot-3. 
But all four are wet behind the ears. In fact, with Chase Anastasio deciding against applying for a fifth year, only two Irish wideouts, other than Grimes, have logged even a sin­gle catch in college. West caught two balls as a freshman, and Parris hauled in one. llord returned seven kickoffs as a freshman but never saw the ball on offense. 
In the backfield, early-enrollee Armando Allen will battle with nsmg sophomores James Aldridge and Munir Prince and multi-faceted fifth-year senior Travis Thomas. 
Weis said Thomas, who played outside linebacker in 2006, likely would start at the beginning of the spring but could move back to defense. Thomas had 13 car­ries for 81 yards and two touch­downs on limited offensive action last season. Aldridge car­ried 37 times for 149 yards, while Prince had 34 yards on 15 attempts. 
On the offensive line, Weis said rising sophomores Dan Wenger, Eric Olsen and Matt Carufel like­ly would battle for the two open spots at offensive guard, while rising sophomore Bartley Webb and rising juniors Mike Turkovich and Paul Duncan will fight for the open left tackle position. 
On the other side of the ball, new defensive coordinator Corwin Brown will instill the 3-4 personnel -a scheme largely unfamiliar to the Irish. 
"Defensively, although person­nel comes into play, the changes are more schematic, and you're going to put it in -in its due course-and you're going to be very deliberate in how you put it in," Weis said. "So everyone

POSITION ILB RB OLB DE 59 CHRIS STEWART OG. INT 90 JOHN RYAN DE OLB 
knows what they are doing and you arc building a system rather than just throwing a system at them." 
Despite the changes, Weis refuses to allow excuses to lower his team's expectations for the upcoming season. 
"All you do give a scapegoat and say, 'You only have three guys coming back on offense, you only have a few more com­ing back on defense,"' Weis said. "I don't think that's what good teams do." 
To accommodate the switch to a 3-4 from a 4-3, some Irish per­sonnel will be switching posi­tions. Rising sophomore Chris Stewart will join the defensive line this season after spending his freshman campaign at left guard, but Weis left open the possibility that Stewart could return to the offense. 
Weis said overall the switch in

defenses will benefit both the players he has now and any recruits looking to come to Notre Dame because the outside line­backer slots on the 3-4 accom­modate players who are too small to be defensive lineman, but too slow to play linebacker in a 4-3 set. 
"This gives you a lot more flex­ibility because now, both those guys, both the guys on the out­side are capable of being either a defensive end or a linebacker on every play," Weis said. "And this way the defense and the offense really never knows which one is which: Is this guy a linebacker in this play or is he a defensive end on this play? By natural view of that, it causes confusion."

ND travels to Jersey for NCAA meet 

By KEN FOWLER 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame may not be the favorite, but the Irish plan on rat­tling some sabres starting today as the four-day NCAA Fencing Championships kicks off at Drew University in Madison, N.J. 
Columbia, Penn State and St. John's are the favorites, each qualifying the maximum 12 fencers for the event. But Ohio State and Notre Dame, two peren­nial powers who failed to qualifY a full squad, have shown an ability to overcome a numbers disadvan­tage in the past. 
Last season the Buckeyes quali­fied just nine fencers yet finished third with 155 points-only 10 behind champion Harvard. For the Irish, Notre Dame's 2005 championship marked the only time a squad ever captured the title without a full allotment of fencers. 

"I think we have a shot," Irish coach Janusz Bednarski said of his team's chances this weekend. 
And he has empirical evidence on his side. 
Like they did two seasons ago en route to a national champi­onship, the Irish qualified 11 fencers for this year's NCAA Championships. 
But the similarities don't stop there. In 2005, Notre Dame captured two titles at the NCAA Midwest

Spring beginnings 
Weis says expectations still high as young squad starts practices 
By CHRIS HINE and 
KEN FOWLER 
Sports Writers 
Tradition never graduates, but experience does. 
A year after posting a banner that read, "9-3 is not good enough," Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis said Wednesday he picked a theme -"Tradition never graduates" -for spring practices that would eliminate any low expectations as the team replaces seven offensive and transitions to a new defen­sive scheme. 
Weis' comments came at the team's news conference to usher in the start of spring ball. Notre Dame held the first of its 15 spring practices Wednesday at the Loftus Center. 

The Irish enter the spring needing to fill the top of the depth charts on an offensive unit that led Notre Dame to a 10-3 record and a Sugar Bowl appearance last season. 
"Our identity on offense is going to be more personnel­related than it is schematically because we changed people," Weis said. "There's been a great influx of new people coming in, so now, for example, let's say your runner is a different type of runner than Darius [Walker]. Well, you know, that might change what you do offensively as far as the run game goes."

Irish crush Broncos at Eck 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA Sports Writer 
Notre Dame scored eight runs in the bottom of the fourth to jump ahead 13-3 and cruise to a 17-9 win over Western Michigan Wednesday at Eck Stadium. 
The outburst was the third inning in which the Irish have driven in seven or more runs this season. 
The win, with its season-high 17 runs, put Notre Dame just above .500 with an overall record of 10­9. 
Freshman third baseman A.J. Pollock led the Irish offensively, going 5-for-6 from behind the plate. Notre Dame jumped out to an early 1-0 lead and never allowed the Broncos a chance to take the game. 
"It was a great day to hit and everybody swung the bat well, so

No. 3 squad to play Badgers in Madison 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Editor 
Days after surviving its first road trip of the season without dropping a match, Notre Dame is on the road again to face Wisconsin today. 
Last week, No. 3 Notre Dame (15-1) captured three matches away from home, including its first two outdoor matches against No. 15 Duke and No. 31 Tennessee. 
The Irish will try to win their 12th straight against the unranked Badgers, who will likely be without their best player, No. 18 Caitlin Burke, who has been out nearly two months, Notre Dame coach Jay Louderback said. 
"They've struggled this year," Louderback said. "If their kids are back and healthy, it could be a good match. If their kids are out, they're struggling. They've had about eight days to rest and [Burke has] played dou­bles, but we just don't know who'll be in the lineup for them." 
The Irish are suffering from injury problems of their own. 
Louderback said junior Brook Buck will not play today due to an undisclosed injury. Her injury will affeet the com­binations Notre Dame sends out to play doubles. Buck, along with sophomore Kelcy Tefft, is currently ranked No. 15 in the ITA Tennis rankings with an 8-5 record.
