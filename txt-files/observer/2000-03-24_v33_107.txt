S n i t e Museum reflect the luminous, rich col­ors of this new exhibit, Jeffrey Becom Photographs: The Maya and Their Color Cosmos. 
"It's a different world -the tropical and subtropical world is much brighter -It's a much more colorful place," said Steve Moriarty, associate art profes­sor and associate professional specialist at the Snite. The exhibit consists of three topics: painted houses, painted churches and painted tombs. 
"This is the first museum exhibit of this photographer's show," said Gina Costa, mar­keting and public affairs spe­cialist. She said that students could benefit from the exhibit's immersion into the very beauty of vivid colors within a tradi­tional indigenous Mexican soci­ety. 
"Sometimes we are not aware of the very sophisticated system [the Maya people] have of symbolically using colors," Costa said. Colors are not just pigments selected from a palate, but rather, represent death. the heavens or even sac­rifice. 
Becom reflects those tradi­tions in his photography. 
"[Becom 's I obsession is color," said Costa, explaining that the photographer accl'ntu­ates the beauty within the Mayan's poverty. 
"It became clear that painted architecture -and specifically its colors -was my life's call­ing, whether I photograph. paint or write books about painted color customs. myths. and meaning," Becom said. 
Becom uses a silver bleach process to highlight the rich colors in the architecture. 
"Dye structure is a positive­to-positive process that pro­duces prints directly from color transparencies without the need for an inter-negative," said Becom. "During the pro­cessing .. . some of the dyes are bleached out to remove unwanted areas of color." 
In the Mayan tradition, hous­es should all resemble each other to avoid envy from neigh­bors. 
"Only in those towns where the lure of the outside world holds sway do customs loosen; and Maya might dare personal­ize their houses with flamboy­ant colors," Becom said. This does not hold true for church­es, however. Before the Spanish explorers, Mayan peo­ple painted their churches in red paint "as a potent symbol of blood sacrifice and a prayer for renewal," Becom continued. Because this practice was con­trary to Catholic beliefs of red as the devil and sin, the Mayan

Callahan calls on Church to rethink gender issues 
By LINDSAY FRANK 
News Writer 

The Catholic Church needs to develop a more inclusive sexual ethic, said Sidney Callahan, pro­fessor of psychology at Mercy College, in her lec­ture Thursday night. 
The Church should rethink how it deals with issues of gender differences. contraception and sexual orientation. Callahan said. 
When discussing issues of gender, she empha­sizes that one could be Christian while disagree­ing with gender stereotypes of women as home­makers and men as being in the workforce. 
"I became one of the first people to advocate Christian feminism," she said. "J didn't find that there was one specific location for women or for

Firing Ideological Blanks 
Ah, gun control. The issue makes otherwise intelligent people sound like complete buffoons. So it's no surprise that a debate on the issue should be prominent at Notre Dame, where intel­ligence abounds, but common sense is as easy to find as a natural tan in Michiana. 
Both extremes in the drbate offer ample amuse­ment. Radical gun lovers claim that the Second Amendmrmt fully grants them the right to hunt rab­bits with anli-tank missiles. Anti-gun pundits claim that we need to hold the avail­ability of guns responsible, not the evil tendencies of humans. 
Sadly enough, the truth is closer to your gun-loving Uncle Rufus up in Montana than the legislation-happy gun control Lealots, which speaks volumes. As much as I hate to side with the guys who wear !luorescent Jeff Gordon hats, their stance is, I'm afraid. more logical. 
Persomtlly, J would be happier than a guy with a pocket foll of quarters in a nickel stripper bar if banning guns would have any significant efTed on gun violence and crime in general. But Prohibition and the "war" on drugs teach us valuable lessons: as long is there is a high demand for something -whether it be guns, money for sex or drugs, then your laws must reflect this. 
Though comparing gun use to prostitution or substance abuse is rather "apples and oranges," it is still an important point. Whereas prostitution and recreational drug use are illegal (except in Nevada and the Mayor's office in D.C., respec­tively), there are legitimate uses for guns by civil­ians, whether they be self defense. sport or other legal and legitimate means. 
There are several horrible arguments in favor of gun control -never mind the fact that more restrictions are no guarantee of less crime. We have the "It works in England" simpletons who disregard societal factors as a role in gun vio­lence (By the way, prohibition is alive and well in Saudi Arabia). 
These individuals, when studying statistics on gun-related violence, reason that by making a law to take the gun away, the crime vanishes as well, or at least decreases considerably. Won't these criminals find other means to purchase weapons? Of course they will, and they already do. Allow me to introduce the phrase "black market" to the world. 
Wouldn't our efforts be better spent in han­dling the problems leading to the crimes or even addressing the criminal? And if they would, is it adequate to assume that because we don't know how to go about effectively stopping the crimi­nals, we should just pass more laws in the mean­time to appease the electorate and convince them we're making a difference? The answers to these questions grow more obvious by the hour. 
The issue won't go away, because it provides fodder for gutless politicians to bolster their images as "caring" more about people than about an outdated Amendment they perceive as "taken out of context." (Interestingly enough, these same clowns trample the premises of the First Amendment.) 
And if they ever succeed in banning guns, they will gaze cluelessly at unfaltering crime rates, pondering the failure of clueless advocates of years past. 
The views expressed in the Inside Column are those of the author and not necessarily those of The Obsen>er.

Student seeks to sell Sacred Heart 
March 17, 1970 

In an effort lo purchase food and medicine for starving and injured people, Peter UuBois, a Notre Oame senior, circulated a petition to sell the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. He gathered 42 signatures, including one profes­sor. "The altar alone would bring in a sizeable sum and the bricks might be able tn be sold as building material and perhaps even as 'souvenirs,"' Du Bois said.

Michigan students murdered in Costa Rica 
ANN ARBOH, Mich. 

University students from across the country travel the world each year gaining new communication skills and cultural experience. But Sunday's murder of a 19-year-old Ann Arbor woman and her friend in Costa Rica raises questions about student securi­ty abroad. 
Emily Eagen, "vho was arlrnitted to the University of Michigan as a non­degree student l'or the upcoming fall semester, and Emily llowr.ll, a 19­year-old student at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, were found dead Monday on a highway near the tourist town of Cahuita, Costa Rica. 
Eagen was a 1998 graduate of Ann Arbor Pioneer High School. "They were murdered Sunday night some­where on the coast," Eagcn's older sister Sarah said. 
"We have been told they were last seen leaving the hotel to go get beer or go to a bar. We have been told it is not a sex crime. My sister was found fully clothed. We would like to clarify that." 

Authorities reported finding the girls' rented sports utility vehicle badly burned several miles away from the bodies. Howell, of Lexington, Ky., and Eagen, a former Antioch student, were found with clothing, belongings and credit cards, authoritios said. 
Howell was doing a photography project as part of an Antioch College curriculum that requires students to spend five semesters doing co-op work to fulfill graduation require­ments. 
Eagen had been visiting Howell for 15 days in Costa Rica, and her sister said she had investigated the area before traveling. 
"We thought it was okay, it was a peaceful place," Sarah Eagen said. "Now we have been informed that in the past two weeks there have been five other murders in the region." 
Sarah Eagen said she thinks it is wrong to send students ofT abroad on their own with no place to live. 
"Antioch dumps you with no place to live. llopefully due to this tragedy they will look into changing things," Sarah Eagen said. "We can't hold them responsible," she added. 
Penn State team protests flag 
UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. 
By taking a mostly Southern issue into Northern hands this past weekend, the Penn State baseball team raised awareness of the racism a century-old piece of heritage can still imply for some. In this case, the heritage was a reddish cloth with a blue "X" and white stars known as the Confederate flag. And when the team showed up to play against Winthrop University in Rock llill, S.C., Saturday, more than a few in the audience noticed the red wristbands each Nittany Lion wore to protest the prejudice commonly associated with the flag. "We just wanted to make a statement on how we felt about a flag that has a lot of different meanings, of course," Penn State infielder Willie Melendez said. The flag, which flies in many areas of the South but most noticeably on South Carolina's capitol building, has been the subject of many debates during the past few years. "I think you have to live here and be from this area to understand what proponents of the flag issue are thinking," said Winthrop University sports information director Jack Frost, originally from Kentucky.

Morgan State U. shuts down paper 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. 

When oJ'licials at Morgan State University stopped the presses of the student newspaper, they couldn't have forr.se<rn the reaction the administration would receive. Since the school pulled the plug on an issue of the newspaper, questions about the constitutional­ity of its action have reinvigorated a university press freedom debate. "It's so clear that school officials have violated the rirst Amendment," said Mike Hiestand, an attorney with the Student Press Law Center. "They stopped the presses without even see­ing the final product." The nr,wspaper, the Spokesman, is part of the student government system at Morgan State. The publication also receives a por­tion of its monetary support from student fees. The specific issue at the newspaper in question was a preview of the student government elections which did not include any sort of official endorsement, Hiestand said. "They were going to print what the editor described as fairly routine coverage of the election," Hiestand said. "They stopped short of run­ning any sort of endorsement."

Conference aims to interest girls in math and science 
Special co The Observer 
"Expanding Your Horizons." a career conference for 6th to 8th grade girls with an accompanying program for par­ents, will convene Saturday at 8 a.m. in the University of McKenna Hall, the Center for Continuing Education. 
The conference aims to increase young women's interest in mathematics and science and to make them more aware of career opportunities in math-and science-related fields. 
Some 200-250 girls from schools throughout northern Indiana will attend the conference. About 50-60 parents will participate in a separate program, which includes a panel discussion on "Women in Academia" and a session on "Preparing Your Daughters for College." 
The conference will include interactive workshops for the young participants in animal health sciences (handling live animals). computer sciences, business and finance, engi­neering, human health sciences, life sciences and physical sciences (with hands-on chemistry activities). Closing the program is a demonstration with live eagles by the Raptor Chapter from Auburn, Ind.

Holdaway said that

one reason for the rapid loss of the Moa was that the bird lived for a long peri­od of time and repro­duced infrequently. When humans start­ed killing the adults

and eating the Moa eggs, he said, the population crashed quickly. 
"We think this shows that when you push things too hard, you get to a point where it suddenly falls down," he said. "You may not even notice what is happening until it is too late." 
Holdaway said the first New Zealand settlers, Polynesians who are the ancestors of the present-day Maori, arrived about 1250. 
They brought with them not only weapons, but also egg­eating rats that contributed to the widespread New Zealand extinctions. 
Within only a few decades, the Moa were gone, along with many ground birds, frogs and snakes. History's largest eagle, a 35-pound bird called Haast's eagle, was gone. 
The settlers used fire as a weapon and tool, burning into extinction an entire forest that was then replaced by grassland. An estimated 40 percent of the woody plants became extinct, said Holdaway, and this destroyed habitats. 
By the time Europeans arrived in New Zealand, in the 18th century, hundreds of animals and plants were gone forever, said Holdaway.

The agreement would allo­cate $4 billion for compensat­ing slave and forced labor vic­tims and another $500 million to cover claims for property, bank accounts and i.nsurance policies stolen by the Nazis as well as "humanitarian cases," said Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat, the 
U.S. government envoy to the talks.

"We have taken a huge step forward today," Eizenstat said. "This brings this process a substantial step closer to com­pletion." 
Another $350 million will be used for a foundation to spon­sor research and educational projects around the theme of Nazi labor, with the remainder 
going for administra­tive costs and legal foes. 
All sides agreed in December on the size of the fund, to be financed half by the German gov­ernment and half by indus­try. But nego­

Noah Flug, an Auschwitz survivor who heads an umbrel­la organization of Holocaust survivor groups in Israel and was one of the negotiators, said two-thirds of the people who could have been eligible for the fund had already died. 
"It is better late than never," Flug, 75, said today.

Six people were detained, including the hotel manager. Authorities believed a sev­enth person fled the scene.

The pope began his day, the fourth of his weeklong pilgrimage, by celebrating a 90­minute Mass for clergy at the traditional site of the Last Supper on Mount Zion just out­side Jerusalem's Old City. 
Toward the end of the cere­mony, John Paul was left alone in the grotto-like chamber where tradition says Jesus shared his last meal with his disciples. Sitting in a gold-and­white chair before a small altar, the white-robed pope buried his face in his hands and sat motionless for a few moments. 
The pope's next stop was a meeting with Israel's two chief rabbis, Meir Israel Lau and Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron, at their office in west Jerusalem, ahead of what many Israelis feel is the most important element of the trip -the visit to Yad Vashem. 
The Polish-born Lau, a sur­
vivor of the Nazi concentration

he had high expectations of the 
pope's speech at Yad Vashcm, 
monument to six million Jews 
who perished in the Holocaust. 
The rabbi said the pope's visit 
in itself was of great symbolic 
importance to the JP-wish peo­
ple. "I can stand before him in 
my home, my national home, in 
my holy city of Jerusalem, to 
look him straight in the eye and 
say to him: "The vision of the 
Prophet Ezekiel that the dry 
bones will come to life is taking 
place before our eyes."" 
Meir Gorsky, a professor of 
dentistry who lives near Tel 
Aviv, said he was sure the pope 
will say something about the 
r.hurch"s role during the 
Holocaust, and that "it will be 
great." 
Gorskv will be there to hear it firsthai1d. Tho pope, a dear childhood l'riAnd of Gorsky's late father, Leon (;oldbcrgcr. has made a special request that Gorsky come and meet him. 
"I'm· nially looking forward to meeting him," Gorsky said in a telephone interview. "lie is nice, gentle, friendly. And hr. didn"t have to do this. 1le is reallv sun~ that he loves Jewish people." 
Gorsky said his father and the pontiff, tlrnn simply Karol Wojtyla, were soccer buddies in Wadowice, Poland, each playing goalkeeper for opposing teams. Karol would often have Sabbath dinner at his Je,.vish f'riend"s home, h,~ said. 
When his father visited the 
pope at the Vatican many years 
later, Gorsky said, the pope 
looked at the broadly built man 
and said, "l can see why you 
wern a good goalkeeper." The 
pontiff also told Goldberger not 
to call him "Your Holiness" -it 
was too formal. 
Gorsky, 54, said his father 
also played the piano as a 
youngster -and the pope sang 
along. 
Along with Gorsky, some 20 
other former friends from 
Wadowice are expected to 
reunite with the pontiff today, a 
day that is 
as symboli­
Jerusalem, 

the pontiff will also meet President Ezer Weizman. Some, like Habbi David Rosen of the Anti­Defamation League, see the meeting with Weizman as the most important event because it would be "a recognition of the transformation of the Catholic Church's attitude toward the Jewish people in the land of Israel." 
During the last papal visit in 1964, Pope Paul VI never ven­tured into west Jerusalem and never publicly uttered lsrael"s name. 
On Wednesday, the pope visit­ed the cradle of Christianity, cel­ebrating Mass in Bethlehem's Manger Square. 
But as expected, the day was a potent mix of prayers and pol­itics. John Paul gave a forceful speech in the presence ofYasser Arafat, during which he recog­nized the Palestinians' "legiti­mate aspirations" and thnir "natural right to a homeland." 
The Palestinians prP-sented 

him with a golden bowl of soil, 
to which the pontiff briefly 
touched his lips. 
The pope's spokesman par­

ried suggestions that he was 
endorsing a Palestinian state, 
saying such a state has not yet 
been proclaimP-d and that the 
Vatican would consider the 
issue wlrnn it happened. 
Later in the day, John Paul 

showed sympathy with 
Palestlnian refugees from tlrn 
1948 Mideast war, visiting the 
Dheisheh camp near 
Bethlehem. 
The visit was a peaceful one, 

and especially satisfying for

Hastert names priest 
House chaplain 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

For the first time. a Roman Catholic priest now holds the title of Hous!" chaplain. ending a fractious selection process that embroiled the Republican Party in allegations it was biased against Catholics. 
Speaker D1rnnis Hastert on Thursday named thf' Rev. Daniel Coughlin, the vicar for priests in the Chicago archdio­cese. as chaplain. 
Hastert and Republicans have been under firP since late last year when they announced the selection of the Rev. Charles Wright. a Presbyterian minister. for the position. 
Democrats insisted that a Catholic priest, the Rev. Timothy O'13rien, was the top choice of a bipartisan selection committee. Hastert has main­tained he was unaware of any ranking. 
For four months, the issue raged as some Democrats and Roman Catholics fin,ct rharges of an anti-Catholic bias. GOP strategists fretted about the impact of such allegations, par­ticularly given that Catholics make up more than 25 percent of the electorate. 
In ending the controversy, Hastert accused Democrats of playing an "unseemly political game" by claiming religious bias. 
"I am a patient man," said the Illinois Republican, who took office 15 months ago with a pledge to lower the level of acri­mony in the House. "But even I did not easilv take in stride carelessly tossed accusations of bigotry:·· 
Coughlin's appointment seemed to quiet the brouhaha for the time being. He won bipartisan applause on the House floor. a sharp contrast to the partisan struggle that prompted Wright to withdraw Tuesday. 
Coughlin. who flew to Washington on Thursday and was quickly sworn in. called his appointment "terribly unexpect­
d ,. 
e . 
He told reporters the united States stood for "unity mixed with diversity." 
William Donohue. president of the 350.000-member Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights. said the group had been "dismayed by the way Republicans handled this mat­ter" but "we have no interest in fighting this fight any longer and we commend House Speaker Dennis Hastert for brin,,ging this chapter to an end. 
Deal Hudson. editor and pub­lisher of Crisis, a magazine of politics, culture and the Catholic church, said Hastert clearly sent a message to Catholics with the selection of Coughlin, who hails from largest Catholic diocese in the nation. 
The selection helps "refute the notion that somehow Hcpublicans are country club Protestants who cannnt include Catholics within their ranks," Hudsnn said. 
ThA House has never had a Catholic chaplain; the Senate had one in 1832 but he was un the job only a year. 
Coughlin's duties, in addition to opening each day's session with prayer. will be to minister lo llouse members and their families. 
Vfright, his nomination in limbo for months, met privately with Hastert in the Capitol on Tuesday and offered to with­draw. In a letter released by the speaker's office, he referred to the political controversy. "Let us be thankful that God is not an independent, not a Democrat and not a Republican. He is for all ofus," he wrote. 
In a somber speech on the House floor where he retraced the controversy and responded to critics, Hastert commented that those charging bias "don't know me or are maliciously seeking political advantage by making these accusations." 
"l have never said and I never believed that there was a bias involved in the making of this selection," llouse Democratic leader Dick Gephardt said moments later. 
Wright's nomination emerged in October from a bipartisan committee of lawmakers, but Hastert has the authority to name a chaplain himself. 
Rep. Earl Pomeroy. D-N.D., offered a resolution shortly after Coughlin's nomination that would require that future chap­lains be voted on by the House.

Space warranty to expire 
. NASA's station remains unoccupied after 500 days aloft 
Associated Press 

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. 
1'ASA's space station war­ranty runs out this week, and the agimcy is no closer to fin­ishing the project than it was when the first two pieces rock­elr,d into orbit in 1998. 
Mt.er almost 500 days aloft. tlw international spaco station has no occupants. nn experi­ments, no firm assr,rnbly plans. Instead, it's a barren two­roomer with bad batteries, noisy c-iquipment and poor ven­tilation. 
Blame the Russians: They wern supposed to launch a ser­vice module that would assume control of the station and provide living quarters just livr, months af'ter the ini­tial components soared. but they have been stymied by insufficient funds and malfunc­tioning rorkets. 
As a result, the all-important third component, the Zvezda service module, will not fly before July and astronauts and cosmonauts will not move in until October -at the earliest. 
In the meantime, the war­ranty for what's in orbit is expiring. And that has space shuttle astronauts nying to the rescue next month. 
The 496-day guarantee for Russian-built electronic equip­ment runs out Thursday, according to figures provided last year by then-station man­ager Frank Culbertson, an astronaut who will command a future station crew.

Of that amount, $307 billion would be for defense, $1 bil­lion more than Clinton's request. Its $289 billion for domP-stic programs is almost $30 billion below the presi­dent's plan. 
In early votes, the House overwhelmingly rejected five rival budgets by black, pro­gressive and conservative Democrats, Democratic lead­ers and conservative Republicans. As they did when Kasich pushed the plan through his committee last week, Republicans blocked a Democratic effort to force a vote on the $483 billion, five­year tax cut Bush has pro­posed. 
Bush's proposal and the con­gress iona! tax cut are not directly comparable because they cover different five-year periods. Nonetheless, the Bush plan would eat into Social Security surpluses as projcct­e d by Congress, and few Republicans would be com­fortable voting to do that. 
Clinton proposed $99 billion in tax cuts over the next five years, nearly offset by $96 bil­lion in higher cigarette and some business taxes. 
House conservatives won a promise from GOP leaders to pursue at least $4 billion more in debt reduction this year. 
In exchange, they dropped budget language that would have prohibited spending any of this year's projected $27 billion surplus. In effect, that would have killed a separate $9 billion measure financing anti-drug efforts in Colombia.

Kern said the cause of the 
problem has not bem1 found. 
Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of thA llouse ArmAd Services Committee, issued a statement saying he harl been assured by the Army on Wednesday that the swap-out of missiles has left U.S. forces at no higher level of risk. 
"However, I am concerned that these steps are only short­term and the long-term solution for fixing yet another military shortfall has not yet been deter­mined ,"Spence said. 
The missiles that developed problems range in age from 3 years to 10 years, Kern said. The components suspected of failing cost as much as

$100,000 per missile, but the replacement effort will cost more than that. Kern said he could not offer a total cost esti­mate. 
The problem and the swap­out of missiles was first reportcd Thursday by The Wall Street Journal. Thn newspaper said Patriot missiles were pulled from approximately 11 batteries in South Korea, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Each battery has about 64 missiles, although Kern would not confirm specific numbers. 
The Patriot is used to defend against aircraft and short-range ballistic missiles at medium and high altitudes. 
An upgraded version, called the PAC-3, is being developed to provide a greater capability against short-range missiles.

Poll: Voters find Bush 'arrogant'

Associated Press 
CINCINNATI 
Al Gore, accustomed to the Democratic Party's upper hand on Social Security. bitterly dPridecJ George W. Bush Thursday as 
t h C lfopublica11 staked his own claim on that issue. Anv school child could "go to the bl:ick­

board ancl Gore 
demon­strate how his numbers don't add up." Gore contended. 
Battling for the favor of senior citizens, who reliably vote in powerful numbers, the vice president alleged that the only way Bush could pay for his proposed tax cuts would be through massive budget deficits or Social Security cut­backs. 
Bush countered that Gore was naive to think he can save the program for future retirees simply by throwing money at the Social Security Trust Fund. 
"People need to ask, 'Who's the reformer in the race, who's going to bring people together and get something done and who's an obstacle to reform,"' Bush said in Orlando, Fla. "Step one is you better have a candidate for president who understands it is a problem." 
When people were asked in a new poll by the Pew Research Center who would do the best job of keeping Social Security and \1edicare sound, 4 7 per­cent said Gore and 36 percent said Bush. 
Bush. the Texas governor, made clear his determination to change those numbers. 
lie started Thursday's spit­ting match in an interview published in The Washington Post. in which he declared he would make Social Security a centerpiece of his fall cam­paign. He said Gore has a "major credibility problem" on any kind of policy reform.

Justice Department probes White House e-mails 
. Criminal investigation begins over vice president's missing correspondence 
Associated Press 

WASI-lINGTON 
The Justice !Jepartment announced Thursday it has opern~d a criminal investigation into how the White House foiled to review thousands of e­mails that may have been under subpoena. Lawyers divulged most of Vice President Al Gore's messages are among the missing. 
The White House failure to archive vice presi­dential e-mails before 1997 means that most of Gore's electronic correspondence was never reviPwed to determine whether some pieces should bA turned over to investigators looking at Democratic fund-raising abuses. 
"It appears that much. if not all" of Gore's e­mails were not captured by the White I-louse archive system. While House counsel Beth Nolan informed Congress in a lotter. 
Nolan told lawmakers they are reviewing backup tapes from the vice presidential e-mail system to see if nny o!' the A-mails ran be recon­structed. 
The archive failure was "the sole result of human mistakes and entirely unintentional." Nolan said, explaining that Gore's office simply used a different e·mail system that until 1997 could not be archived by the normal White House system. 
"We have found no indication that those peo­pIe producing documents [under subpoena) were aware of this problem." Nolan wrote. 
But the House Government Reform Committee, which is investigating the e-mails, disclosed that current White House Chief of Staff John Podesta may have known about the e-mail glitch back in the summer of 1998 in the midst of the Lewinsky scandal. 
The White House acknowledges that the glitches caused White House lawyers to fail to review thousands of messages to sec if they were responsive to subpoenas and should have been turned over to Congress or criminal inves­tigators from the many Clinton-era controver­sies. Some of the e-mails may be lost forever, aides said. 
In a court filing, the Justice Department q,ivulged it has opened a c:riminal investigation into the missing e-mails, and allegations by some White !louse contract workers that they were threatened by presidential aides never to disclose the problems to investigators.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Notre Dame should assume founding 
position in Workers' Rights Consortium 
The convnrsation botwn011 lop Notrn Dam0 ol'ficials, lr.ad­ers of tbe Progressive Studnnt AlliancP. and student suµport­Prs this past TuPsday on anti-sweatshop initiatives was in many ways a model for such convnrsations, 
Two vr~ry simple questions wr.rn not asked and no informa­tion rnlevant to them ·was providt>d. "What am tlrn costs or risks Lo the University in accepting Lhc conditions set by lhe Workers' Rights Consortium !WHC) !'or official participatiun in its originating "constitutional convention" in NYC? Why does Notre Dame consider these costs excessive''" 
Fiftp,e.n months ago the University acceptod an invitation to join in the founding meeting of the !;air Labor Association. It did so an<l is proud of the inlluP.ncr. it has had on the forma­tion of standards in the FU\. 
Notre Dame could play a similar role in lhr. wm:. Its rea­sons for declining tlrn option to participate in the founding meeting of tliis new urganizatiun are hardly derisive. (1) Since the WRC is operating on a shoestring. with one slaffcr. and since the WRC intends to be a "bottom-up" organization whose founding members will collectively determine its goals, there is no draft charter at the pr~senl Lime. (2) To participate in the founding meeting, Notre Dame would have lo commit a year's dues and "join" the WRC prior to the meeting. 
Notre Dame's pending counter-offer to the WHC is an application to participate fully in t'fie founding meeting on the basis of a written "good faith" promise to make a firm "up or down" decision within 30 days after the meeting. Nothing is wrong with that counter-uffp,r. 
But it is also very simple to draft an alternate offer dissolv­ing tho currPnt impasse. 
Notre Dame could offer I) to pay imnrndiatnly a full share or the costs of holding the founding meeting of tlw W11C or 50 percent of one year's dues, the exact amount to be negoti­ated, and f2) to fully support tlrn costs of attendancP at the meeting by an attonH'Y from the Office of the Goncral Counsel. a faculty member of the anti-swP.atshop task l'orce at Notre Dame, and two students tone chosen by tho Student Body PresidPnt and onP chosen by the Progressive StudPnt Alliance). In return, Notre Dame should require rights ol' full participation in the founding meeting. Notrn Dame would also continu(' its offer to make a final "up or down" decision concerning mnmbership in tlrn WHC within 30 days of tho rompletion of thP meeting. 
Why should Notre Dame consider adding memlwrship in the WHC lo its VHry influential role in tho FLA'! Tak<1 a simpl<1 look at the history of organized labor. The right to organizP is for Lhc sako of' collective bargaining. You chn't bargain with bosses you can gel to Urn table. FLA has garment manu­facturers in its tent. But garment manufacturnrs who an-' exploiting third world labor can't be trusted much further than Notre Danrn has successfully kirked a fir.Id goal in recent memory. Meaningful negotiation to improve labor conditions can't bo achieved unless the stick of public expo­sure of continuing abuse is readily available. That's what tlrn WRC sta1ids for. So should the Fighting Irish.

We are all guilty of racial profiling 
I have been considering ideas for a Viewpoint letter ever since I heard the verdict of the l)iallo case a few weeks ago. For those that do not know, Armadou Diallo was a 22-year-old West African who had immigrated to New York and was shot last February by four plain clothes police officers as he stood in the doorway of his Bronx apartment. On Feb. 26 the officers, who fired 41 shots on tlrn unarmed Diallo. striking him 19 times. were acquitted of all charges brought against them. 
I have had a dillicult time articulating the emotions that I felt as a result or the verdict. ranging from sadness to rage, into words that l hoped would promote awareness on our campus. After all, Diallo was far awav in the citv or New York and, as many of us here o·n campus often ignore the 1;ews of' the world outside our microcosm, it was hard to convey a message Lo which peo­ple could relate. I was finally pushed to wriLe this when I picked up The Observer just before spring break and read the headline "ND students arrest­ed at local Denny's." This tirnr the problem had explicitly revealed itsel!' on a local level and was affecting mem­bers of our community. The vnry prob­lem that left an innocent and unarmed 22-year-old dead in his doorway at tlw hands of the polie<~ landed four inno­ceut !\'D students in jail. The problmn is racial profiling. We am all guilty. Guilty, at very least, of being indifferent and unaware. But more often, we arc guilty, at some level or another, of the same kind of racial profiling that takes 

place on a daily basis throughout this nation. Sometimes it is highly publi­cized, as in the Diallo case, but more often that not it goes unnoticed by tlrn population at large. We arc guilty of it when we assumP that a black follow student must be an athlete, that he/slw must have a partirular background. or that brJshc is here only because of a race-based quota policy that displaced a morn deserving white student. We have all lrnard oi· participated in llrns1 assumptions and complaints. Every sin­gle person here deservns tlrnir spot and each has something valuable to con­tribute to the university as a whole. whether it is excellence in academics, athletics, or a different point of viPw. A large perc(mtage or our school's popu­lation, namely that of the white American male. must come to terms \vith the fact lhat it has never and probably will never be oµpresscd in any way in its lifetime. Only when this is realized can we hope LO alleviate the burden of tho men and women who face unwarranted prejudice every day. Author James Baldwin stated the fol­lowing in a letter to his nephew: "this is the crime of' which I accuse mv country and my countrymen, "that they have · destroyed and are destroying hundreds of thousands or lives and do not know it and do not want to know it." Thnv are. in effoct, trapped in a history whfch lhny do not understand; and until they understand it. thHy cannot bn released from il." We must open our eyes, pro­motP awareness, and release ourselves from all types of prejudice and profil­ing, including racial. sexual. and reli­gious. Quite simply, as it was once stal­ed on some bathroom graf'liti, "I ley apathetic college studnnls, think!"

Graffiti Dance is part of a larger 'meat market' 
In respornw to lhe recrnt wntroversy surrounding the (irat'fiti Dance, let me take time to defend it. The Graflili Dance is Notre Dame reality. It may not be pretty, it may be a meat market. but that is Notrn Dame. In u very rnal way, it does "orient'' one to ND. Ever been to a party? That's reality. I feel like every night at Senior Bar is really "free-undergrad night" for the Law School... 
If we havfl a problem with meat markets, or with upper-classmen drooling over freshman girls, then for heavcm's sake let solve the problem, not the symptom. Canning the Graffiti Danco does noth­ing for our currnnt an<l continued subjugation of women, minorities and other "outsiders" on this campus.

(From far away it looked 1.ike a third-place award.) By high school, J did not even want the awards distributed at tourna­ments and banquets, including those for actual 
victories or accomplishments. I threw them 
into a box in my closet. I gave my "participa­
tion" awards to my younger sister, Laura, to 
whom the trophies still looked impressive. 
The coaches at these awards banquets and 
tournament prize presentations meant well. 
They hoped to alleviate the pain of the disap­
pointment suffered by those not receiving 
actual awards. I remember a discussion at an 
end-of-the-year swim team banquet in which 
one mother boasted that no child would leave 
without a prize, as she admired the rows of 
miniature trophies on the table. 
unfortunately, the children receiving these 
prizes did so without the benefit of actual 
accomplishment. They obtained a sign of suc­
cess without actual success. In American 
society today, as evidenced by the numerous entertainment awards shows and the "partic­ipation" awards now sitting in a box in my closet, awards and trophies signify ultimate success. However, as an increasing number of these trophies circulate throughout society, the success that they represent becomes increasingly trivial. The distinction between those who deserve an award and those who merely participated becomes increasingly blurred. The average director, actor or athlete becomes victorious. Do those coaches and bestowers of entertainment prizes truly believe mediocrity deserves honor? 
Perhaps they simply want everyone to feel accomplished. In the case of the entertainment industry, the awards shows also aid their busi­ness. The awards show itself draws attention and viewers to the network broadcasting it. I wonder. could ABC or NBC receive an Emmy for their skilled. thoughtful coverage of the Grammys'? 
And maybe some people benefit from the participation awards. II' the average person believes themself successful. fewer people will turn to self-help gurus in their middle age. As for 1\otre Dame, my friend \fary Anne offers a differing theory. "Here," she says. "they make everyone feel average by making everyone fail." But then, she seemed a little bitter at the time.

Concrete destroys campus beauty 

When I was a kid visiting this campus, soaking up the Saturday morning football atmosphere and the cool fall air, there was always one particular memory of Notre Dame that stood out. The campus, full of large oak trees, famous buildings, and expansive greenery always made an impression in my head. The beauty of this campus alone could have solrl me on coming here. Ever since I arrived here, it seems as though the campus is transforming from its former into a concrete jungle. 
Everywhere I turn, in any direction, there is a concrete path to guide me. The concrete sidewalks have swallowed up almost all of the lawn on North and South quad. Right in front of my dorm, they decided to connect two roads with an adjoining road right through the middle of the West Quad. Did they consider tearing up some of the old sidewalks that lay there before? NO, they simply connected all of the former paths with the new road! Now the West Quad looks more like the west side of Los Angeles, bare of any grass or trees. The campus looks very grey and depress­ing, seemingly to reflect the moods of a lot of students. Ever since a Dutch Elm disease hit the South Quad, wiping out a num­ber of the large trees that once created a green canopy in the spring, South Quad now resembles a bleak Chicago alley. It's a shame too, because we are definitely not lacking any beautiful buildings in that area either. 
What needs to be done on campus is to end of all utilitarian improvements to the campus. What I mean is that they need to stop placing sidewalks were they are unnecessary. First of all, every diagonal and shortcut sidewalk should be eliminated. If our buildings were spaced out miles apart I could see the point in having them, but everything is relatively close enough where could have at least 40 percent less sidewalks. Besides, if people feel that the extra 20 seconds they save is worth it by cutting through on the lawn or using one of the unnecessary sidewalks, then they should invest more time in leaving earlier for their classes. 1can't understand how anyone could argue with me. There is no doubt that there is an excess of sidewalks. If vou consider the Debartolo/Business school quad, you would have to agree that tlrnre is definitely a lack of warmth and comfort. Besides the fact there aren't any large trees, there is again an abundance or sidewalks. I am sure that if we eliminated all of thC' extra concrete on campus, and convince tho student body to stay off the grass for the most part, then they would comply. It seems everyone takes pride in our rampus; all WP need to do is bring it to everyone's attention that we are corrupting its former beauty by depriving it of its natural beauties, Other schools that have large lawns have not given in to utilitarian pathways (Duke, UVA, Dartmouth). and neither should we. 
Notre Dame thrivAs off its campus beauty; we should do every­thing in our power to keep it intact. Get rid of the sidewalks, and throw a f'ew large trees in where nenissary. If' Fatlwr Sorin Pnvi­sioned a concrete jung!fl for our campus, he would have scttlNI 90 miles west in Chicago.

Anything can happen with Mr. 0 
In "Magnolia," one of this year's Oscar-nominaled films, it rains frogs. The theory is that sometimes .... frogs are swept up into the air dur­. ing tornadoes and become caught up in the strong winds, only to fall back Lo earth miles from where the tor­natl o originally struck. It happens from time to time in South America, and it's a weird phenom­enon, but then again last year "Shakespeare· in Love" upset "Saving Private Ryan" for Best Picture. 
Best Picture 
When this year's nominations were announced it seemed that there was no clear-cut frontrwmer in the best picture category. Most recently though, "American Beauty" has made such a sweep of other year-end film awards that it would probably degrade the award if any other film won. So far this year "American Beauty" has won three Golden Globes (best picture, best director and best screenplay}, three Screen Actors Guild Awards (ensemble acting, Annette Benning and Kevin Spacey) and the Director's Guild Award (Sam Mendes). It was also chosen as best film by more than 15 newspapers, television stations and radio stations (L.A. Times, Chicago Tribune, Rolling Stone, among others). 
Well-known critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times has predicted "American Beauty" to not only win Best Picture, but for it to "sweep" the five major categories that it was nominated ­best picture, best actor, best actress, best director and best original screenplay (it also received nominations in Sound, Score and Editing}. In the 71-year history of the Academy Awards, only three films have accomplished this feat, the last being the thriller "Silence of the Lambs" in 1991. 
The film most likely to upset "American Beauty" Sunday night is "The Cider House Rules." "The Insider," "The Green Mile" and "The Sixth Sense" were also nominated but really don't stand a chance. 
"The Cider House Rules" is believed to be a strong contender, not because it is a movie worthy of winning best picture, but only because of the strong marketing pro­gram of its producer Miramax. "The Machine," as the program is called, has in recent years punched out many nomina­tions for its films ("The Crying Game," "The English Patient," "Shakespeare in Love"). There have been so manv nomi­nations that an Web site started arumor that there is an executive of Miramax sleeping with an executive of PriceWaterhouse Coopers (the official vote counters). But most Hollywood insid­ers just believe it is because of the mar­keting program. 
If the fact that the romantic comedy "Shakespeare in Love" defeated "Saving Private Ryan" isn't enough proof of The Machine's power, "The Cider House Rules" receiving seven nominations must be. The film was not accepted very well by critics and did even worse at the box office. Many critics complained of thfl muddled abortion issue, which wasn't really much of a problem. It was a heart­warming story, but in a year with so many good films ii. is hard to believe this film deserved seven nominations. 
Just a few of these other good films that

were snubbed by the Academy and are deserving of an honorable mention are "Magnolia," "Being John Malkovich," "Three Kings" and "The Hurricane." Most of these films received lesser nominations in other categories. 
Best Director 
Sam Mendes of "American Beauty" is by far the leading candidate for winning this category. This was Mendes' first fea­ture film after being discovered by Dreamworks executive Steven Spielberg. Mendes has already won the Director's Guild ofAmerica Award, an award that in more than 50 years has only been wrong in predicting the Oscar four times. 
Other newcomer Spike Jonze (a.k.a. Adam Spiegel, heir to the Spiegel maga­zine fortune} is an alternative favorite for his artistic work "Being John Malkovich." Jonze was imaginative and worked on many levels, but as the miracle man in "The Princess Bride" said, "It would take a miracle." Like Jonze, Lasse Hallstrom of "Cider House Rules," M. Night Shyamalan of "The Sixth Sense" and Michael Mann of "The Insider" also stand little chance of winning. They all made great pictures out oflesser scripts, and they should remem­ber that "it is an honor to be nominated." 
Best Actor 
Originally, Denzel Washington was thought to be a frontrunner for this award. He transformed a sub-par movie about a black man wrongly accused of murder into a somewhat worthwhile and interesting story. In recent wep,ks though, there has been numerous articles about the inaccuracy of the movie -it seems it left out a few felonies that Carter commit­ted. This does not take away from Washington's performance, but it does hurt the perception of I.he film and could hurt the voting. 
Kevin Spacey was the other frontrunner and it seems as though he is currently the man to beat. There is no question that Spacey's dry, sarcastic voice made "American Beautv," and he will benefit from the progiiosticated sweep of "American Beauty." He has already won the Screen Actor's Guild Award, which is a correct indicator of the Oscar winner 90 percent of the time. 

Best Actress 

This category seems to be wide open. Annette Bening, whose husband Warren Beatty will receive a special Oscar at the awards show, seems to be a frontrunner due to the overwhelming popularity of "American Beauty" and her win at the Screen Actor's Guild Awards. But some feel her role was to small to be in the Best Actress category. 
Benning is contending with Hilary Swank's gender bending role in "Boys Don't Cry" and Julianne Moore's throw­back role in "The End of the Affair." 
Swank has been highly praised for her meticulous role as a distraught woman/boy, and she won nearly every award outside of the Screen Actor's Guild. Her role was tough to play and award­worthy, a far cry from her days as "The Next Karate Kid" and as Steve's girlfriend on "Beverly Hills 90210." Who would have ever dreamed that an Aaron Spelling pro­duction could churn a chance to win an Academy Award? 
Julianiie Moore is the darkhorse of the race. Her role as a promiscuous wife was hardly deserving of a nomination, but she also had roles in four other movies in 1999, including a large role in "Magnolia." Meryl Streep was again deservedly nomi­nated in what seems to be an annual occurrence, this time for her role in "Music of the Heart". 
Best Supporting Actor 
Tom Cruise is one of those life-time achievers who seems to have an asymptot­ic reach for the little gold trophy. He has been nominated for best actor twice for his roles in "Born on the Fourth of July" and "Jerry Maguire," has never made a bad movie, yet he has never won on Oscar. 
P.T. Anderson wrote the role of T J Mackey with Cruise and a best supporting actor Oscar in mind. The role is both active, as we see Mackey scream about seducing women, and dramatic, as we later see him unfold when his father dies in front of his eyes. It is the perfect role to w:in Cruise the Oscar, and has already won him a less-than-satisfying Golden Globe. 
Also on Cruisc's side is that "Magnolia" was snubbed from the "Best Picture" cate­gory. But negating this fact is Michael Cail1e, whose "The Cider House Rules" will probably not win best picture. I receive some sympathy votes in his Cail1e played the ether-addicted d search of a successor. He is the old ever nomiliated for best supportir at the age of 79. Like Cruise, receive some votes for his previo1 ("Hannah and her Sisters," "Dirl3 Scoundrels"), but his role was too to overtake Crui,e's masterpiece. 
In direct opposition to Cainc'i Haley Joel Osment, who is th youngest child to be nominated at of 11. He showed maturity far beJ age in last summer's surprise be smash "The Sixth Sense." 
Other nominees include pretty Jude Law, who was nominated his role as the rich boy with a si kick named Matt Damon in '" Talented Mr. Ripley," and Mid Clarke Duncan, who gave a ste performance as a prisoner or death row in "The Green Mile." 
Best 

Supporting 
Actress 

For her part in the film "Girl, Interrupted," Angelina Jolie seems to be the consensus pick of most critics despite bad reviews and poor box-office receipts. 
Catherine Keener may get some votes for "Being John Malkovich," although she owes all of her attention to Spike Jonze, who was the real hero of the film. Former "Kids" star Chloe Sevigny of "Boys Don't Cry" should also receive some attention, but not enough to win. 
Best Original Screenplay 
"Magnolia" is far and away the most deserving film in this category. It was orig­inal and interesting with the best dialogue of the year, and it gave the actors a chance to let it all hang out. P.T. Anderson magically wrote the combination more than nine stories into one film. It was almost three hours, but you want to know so much about the characters it doesn't seem anywhere near that long. It is a deli­cious treat for actors, and with the actor sector making up the largest portion of the Academy's voting population, "Magnolia" should win out. 
However, it does have to upstage the giant "American Beauty," which again should benefit from the sweep factor. "American Beauty" does have the editing process working against it though. Most people probably don't know that the origi­nal screenplay ended in a trial, which if it did, would be a travesty in itself. 
Best Adapted Screenplay 
"The Cider House Rules" is really the only choice for winning this category. "The Machine" will be enthusiastically promot­ing it, and one should notice the fact that .John Irving (who wrote the novel) worked for years on perfecting the screenplay. If anything, it should be a token award for not winning best picture. 
The awards will be banded out this Sunday at 8 p.m. on ABC. The red carpet will be rolled and the stars will be dressed to the hilt in their designer dresses that cosl. more than our tuition. It should be entertaining, but don't plan on repeats of Roberto Renigni's performance from last year.

LIZ LANG/The Observer Senior captain Niele Ivey has overcome injury in her Irish career and is poised to lead her team in the NCAA tournament's Sweet 16. At the helm of the Irish floor game, Ivey leads the team in steals and assists on the court, but also plays a crucial role off the court as the team's emotional leader.

Post players step up to help Riley in paint 
By KERRY SMITH 
Sports Editor 
Any Irish fan will tell you that Ruth Riley dominates in the paint. 
From the echoing bellows of her name when she enters the game to the Baby Ruth candy bars thrown into the r.rowd after every blocked shot, fans relish every minute the junior All­American center plays on the court. 
To add to the hype the Irish have been touted as tho "Ruth Riley Show" all season long. 
Riley's role in the eyes of her fans has moved from an aggres­sive post player to a one-woman legend in her four-year career at Notre Dame -and the legend is not far from the truth. 
But as dangerous as Riley is in lhe paint. one player cannot win an NCAA tournament. One play­er cannot lift a team to the No. 6 spot in the nation. And one play­er cannot sustain the success the Irish have attained all season. 
She needs help. 
Riley finds Lhat help down low in the increasingly-potent post play of senior forward Julie Henderson and junior forward Kelley Siemon. 
The tr.io of Riley, Henderson and Siemon on the inside serve as a sweet compliment to an effective set of Irish guards behind the arc. 
George Washington head coach Joe McKeown learned that the hard way when Notre Dame handed hi'> squad a ticket home Sunday with a 95-60 wi11 in the second round of the NCAA tour­nament. 
"They have a lot of weapons and some kids that probably do not get enough credit. Players like [Niele] Ivey, [Danielle] Green and Henderson played very well for them tonight," said McKeoV\n after the focused Irish foiled his team's upset bid. "Their role­players are high school All­Americans, so don't feel sorry for them. It may he played up to be the 'Ruth Riley show,' but they are all good players. A'l you watch film on them you become very impressed with players like !Kelly] Siemon. They are very talented and I do not underesti­mate some of their other play­ers." 

Notre Dame's post play has been a vital component to its 27­4 season record. While the guards direct the offense, the forwards and center get tho job done under the basket on both offense and defense. 
Riley leads Lhe Irish in a host of categories, including scoring, field goal percentage, rebound­ing and blocked shots. Averaging more than 16 points and sm·en rebounds a game, her domi­nance in the paint has been unmatched in almost every game the Irish have played this year. 
Irish head coach Muffet McGraw knows the value of Riley's presence on the court. 
"I think [Riley] has improved trnmendously and has a great work ethic. She does a great job getting position, she has been a little more physical this year, and she does a great job reading the defense," McGraw said. "She does a lot of things with her size that a lot of the teams don't know how to deal with. There is no one in the country that can do what she does." 
But even legends have their weaknesses. 
Riley's one glaring blemish this season has been her penchant for getting into foul trouble and landing a spot on the bench for extended periods of time. That's where Henderson and Siemon come in. 
The two forwards have picked up where Riley has left off all season and have become more of a threat to opponents as the year has progressed. 
"Our team has the mentality of it's us five guarding you so Ruth is not alone on defense," said Henderson after the win over George Washington. "We know [teams] are going to try and get her in foul trouble early in the game. But it is us five guarding you. We had Ruth's back all game. It was great. All the post played great so we are very happy." 
Henderson's post play has come alive in the latter part of the season.

Sizing up the competition 


Mideast Bracket 
The top seed in the Mideast, the Tennessee Lady Vols are hungry for their seventh national championship. Averaging 82 points per game, the Vols' strength lies in their offense production. Tamika Catchings, Semeka Randall and Michelle Snow am tough to guard in the paint. Perimeter defense has been a con­cern for the Vols all season, but with a 24-3 record, the team has shown it has what it takes to bring home the title. 

A surprise winner in the ACC, the fourth-seeded Virginia Cavaliers find their leadership in Renee Robinson. Robinson's season of' success shocked many -the senior point guard more than tripled her scoring average since­last year. The Cavaliers are a solid shooting team, but they have struggled on the boards all season. Lack of depth could also hurt thP Cavaliers in their run for the title. 



The Notre Dame Fighting Irish pack a potent punch with strong inside and out­side shooting. All-American center Ruth Riley L'l a force in the paint and a trio of guards, Niele Ivey, Alicia Ratay and Daniello Groen, arc a menace around the perimeter. The second-seeded team has struggled with turnovers all season, averaging 21.4 a game. Key inside play­ers will need to stay out of foul trouble in order to make it to Philadelphia. 
Making their 11th straight NCAA tournament appearance, the third­scedcd Texas Tech Lady Radiers lost four starters and the bulk of their offense t.o graduation last year. The young team has proven worthy of the Sweet 16, however. With key players stepping up, the Raiders are monsters on the boards and boast the ninth-best defense in the country, allowing just 55 points a game.

Irish journey to Philadelphia makes stop in Memphis 
By KERRY SMITH Sports Editor 
It may not be the quickest route to Philadelphia, but Muffet McGraw's Irish squad has no choice -it must go straight 
through Tennessee on its way to the Fin­al Four. 
And win­ning a pair of games in Mem­


phis this McGraw weekend won't be an easy task for the second-seeded team in the Mideast. 
Touted as the toughest bracket in the NCAA tourna­ment. the Mideast boasts four of the top teams in the nation: T1rnnessee, Notre Dame, Virginia and Texas Tech. 
While the Lady Vols and the Irish are the favorites. the Cavaliers and Lady Raiders are hungry for upsets. 
Second-seeded Notre Dame will take the court at The Pyramid on Saturday in the fourth round of the tourna­ment against No. 3 seed Texas Tech. 
Texas Tech, a Big 12 pow­erhouse, will pose a formida­ble challenge for Notre Dame in their quest to reach the Elite Eight. 
"We're just getting back to the fundamentals to get ready," said senior guard

Danielle Green. "We're focus­ing on basic drills, defense and rebounding." 
Not onlv do the Raiders boast a powerful offense and stingy defense, the experi­enced squad has a little extra motivation coming into Saturday's game. 
Two years ago, the Irish traveled to Texas and handed tho Raiders an early exit from the NCAA tournament -the only home court tour­nament loss the squad has suffered in 14 outings -and that's something the Raiders won· t soon forget. 
"George Washington was out for revenge too," joked Green about Notre Dame ·s win over the Colonials to advance to the sweet 16 last Sunday. "Thinking about revenge just hurts them. When you play with a lot of emotion you get off your game plan." 
The Raiders muscled their way to the No. 6 spot in the nation and captured the Big 12 conference title this sea­son for the third consecutive year with a 27-4 record. 
But now they are eager for a chance to avenge their 1998 tournament loss with a win over the Irish in Memphis. 
Forwards Plenette Pierson and Aleah Johnson lead the Raiders' fast paced offense while Keitha Dickerson patrols the paint. 
Averaging 10 rebounds and 
12.3 points a game, the six­foot senior will challenge Riley and Henderson at the 
post. 
But Riley's distinct height advantage over Texas Tech's starting five could work in Notre Dame's favor. 
The trio of Irish guards Niele fvey, Danielle Green and Alicia Ratay, will keep the Raider defense on its toes. 
Notre Dame's balanced scoring attack has proven to be a menace for opponents and has propelled the Irish to a 27-4 record. 
If the Irish can survive Saturday's contest, the road to the Final Four will only get tougher facing the win­ner of the Tennessee­Virginia game Monday. 
No. 2 Tennessee, the Mideast favorite playing in familiar territory. is a tough draw for any team in the fifth round. 
Vols' head coach Pat Summit has cultivated a powerful inside game and her veteran squad holds a 27-3 record on the season. Forwards Tamika Catchings, Semeka Randall and center Michelle Snow spearhead a high-scoring offense that averages more than 80 points an outing. 
While the Vols' outside game is their weakest link, Tennessee lays claim to freshman point guard Kara Lawson, the leading three­point shooter in the SEC this season. 
Lawson will provide a good match-up for Ratay, who has also made her mark from behind the arc.

Jillian Depaul 
Scene Movie Critic 
Living up to tradition, the toughest races of this year are in the supporting acting cate­gories. In the supporting actress category, there is an exciting, scene-stealing perfor­mance by Angelina Jolie, whose father Jon Voight is an Oscar winner himself. These are the type of p0rformanccs that usually take home the gold in supporting categories. But, if we "look closer" at her compe­tition, we see Chloe Sevigny's gracefully understated perfor­mance as Brandon Teena's lover in "Boys Don't Cry." lt is 
Sevigny's portrayal of Lana Tisdel that brings this 
movie to the next level, turning it into an emotional 
powerhouse, instead of merely a vehicle for 
Swan.k's courageous gender-bending performance. 
Critics'· Comments 

The Academy played it safe once again with best picture selections in the traditional molds; four of which are about as exciting as watching paint dry. No, wait, even less excit­ing than that. There was apparent­ly no room for anything original like "Being John Malkovich" or "Magnolia." Nor was there room for anything disturbing ("Boys Don't Cry," "The Talented Mr. Ripley"), nihilistic ("Hght Club) or controversial ("Eyes Wide Shut"). That's too bad, because my choice for best picture, "American Beauty," isn't nearly as good as any of those films. 

And the Oscar for snub of the year again goes to the Academy ... 
Last year, many were angered by the Academy's perceived snub of Jim Carrey by failing to nominate him for his performance in "The Truman Show." For my part, I felt the truest snub occurred on Oscar night itself as "Shakespeare in Love" very nearly shut out "Saving Private Ryan." but this year Carrey has 

truly been snubbed for his masterful per­formance in "Man in the Moon." It's hard to believe that the Academy, with its tradition of overcompensating, would not nominate Carrey for his depiction of Andy Kaufman, but once again they have gone beyond the call of duty in ignoring a great perfor­mance. I can only hope that they were tact­less and thoughtless enough to make Carrey a presenter again this year. 
This year's nominations exemplify the Academy's cow­ardice for taking chances on films that don't necessarily go for conventional effect. With the notable exception of "American Beauty," the Academy gave little respect to actors' bravery, rather than taking more direct chances by nominat­ing films not of traditional Hollywod form. The recognition of disappointing films such as "The Green Mile" as opposed to far more innovative and interesting work such as "Three Kings" or "The Talented Mr. Ripley" goes to show the need for security in the minds ofAcademy voters. After the luke­warm critical response to the toned-down "The Cider House Rules," one has to think that its nomination was out of elimi­nation ofriskier films that might have stirred up too much controversy for the Academy's unsteady and sensitive voting body. 

John Crawford 
Scene Movie Critic 
So is the Academy going to award Tom Cruise -who surprised many, myself included, by showing some serious acting chops with his role as the seduce-and­destroy motivational speaker in "Magnolia" -or Haley Joel Osment -the kid whose per­formance is critical to "The Sixth Sense" being so good? Two great performances, but hopefully they award Cruise. Sure, he plays another in a long line of cocky characters, but his work in "Magnolia" covers the emotional range 

from confidence to denial to rage. His character's 
meltdown before the television interviewer is a 
roller coaster ride through the soul. 
Although many people are more concerned with the lead actor roles than with the sup­porting actor roles, that is where the most interesting races lie. it seems as though Angelina Jolie is a shoe-in for best supporting actress, but Chloe Sevigny deserves to be neck and neck with her. All of the hype from "Boys Don't Cry" has gone to Hilary Swank, but Sevigny was just as impressive in the role. The movie really did depend on whether the audience could buy if she would fall in love with a gen­
der-confused woman and she sold everyone. 
Anyone may win for best supporting actor. Michael Caine is the sentimental favorite, Tom Cruise is the old (young) pro who has yet to receive an Oscar and took a chance on a risky role, and Haley Joel Osment is the youngest male ever to be nominated and made ghost stories believable again. All in all, Osment impressed me the most because he made me believe in ghosts once again. 
The supporting actress cate­gory holds the most mystery. Catherine Keener's no-non­sense vixen in "Being John Malkovich" held the early lead. Now, Angelina Jolie, as the crazy chick in "Girl, Interrupted" is the frontrunner. But the Academy likes Woody Allen, they really like his actresses and they love giving the award to actors playing characters with a handicap.
Scene Movie 

Think Daniel Day-Lewis in "My 
Critic 

Left Foot" or the deaf Marlee 
Matlin in "Children of a Lesser 
God.") Samantha Morton's 
sweet and moving portrayal of a mute girl in Allen's 
little-seen "Sweet and Lowdown" is the upset of the 
night. 


Jason Hammontree 


The only two who are real frontrunners arc "American Beauty" for best picture and Hilary Swank for best actress. Her performance was head and shoulders above anyone else's in this category. The race in the best actor category is close to caU but Denzel Washington edges out Kevin Spacey by a hair because of the powerful character he por­trayed in 'The Hurricane." The supporting actor and actress cate­gories are pretty much up for grabs. The Oscar should go to Haley Joel Osment, who was absolutely amazing in "The Sixth Sense," but the Academy may overlook him because he is so young. Angelina Jolie wins best supporting actress because her performance was the only worthwhile thing in "Girl, Interrupted." She had to carry the movie while the others were aided by the people surrounding them. As far as best director goes, all the nominees were phenomenal. But the one that truly stands out as the most original and creative film is Spike Jonze's "Being John Malkovich." he will probably be over­looked, but his work on that film was awesome.

ND bands are back and ready to rock 
Scene provides all you ever wanted to know about the campus bands and performers playing at tonight's NAZZ Battle of the Bands 
By AMANDA GRECO

anticipated event for all involved. Sponsored by the Student Union Iloard and organized this year by Tony Cak, campus entertainment corn­dinator. NAZZ will feature 13 bands and five solo performers. Descending on the Senior Bar, the performances will be split between soloists and bands on separate stages. The winners of this battle will be determined bv throe judges for the band category and three judges for soloists. Judging criteria is based on performance, crowd response. skill and overall presentation. Of the six judges, three are rep­resentatives of The Observer. two are frnm WVFI and one other is a student. Prizes will be awarded to the top three performances in each section. All winners will receive various gift certificates to Woodwinds and Brasswinds music store. The evening will be led by announcer Christina Castrillo and there will be pretzels and pop provided for the audience. The first 150 people through the door will receive a free T-shirt. 
In lengthy, serious interview sessions. Scene asked each of the performers a few important questions about their music and inf'luences, focusing on ideas of artistic representation, such as what type of Spice Girl or car part they feel best represents them. 

The Butterfly Effect 
The Butterfly Effect has been together for two-and-a-half years and has appeared twice before at NAZZ. Doug McEachern (class of '97) jams on guitar and vocals. Ph. D candidate Hon Garcia plays the bass while Vinny Carrasco (class of '96) bangs away on drums. Their music is influenced by the music they listen to, the movies they see, the books they read and "the hugs our friends give us after we play," Doug said. The only bands they listen to are the "good ones -only the best ones around really." When asked if they play covers, they replied, "No. all originals of course. We couldn't really call them our songs otherwise, now could we?" They play rock and roll music, sounding "like the way a hug from a friend you haven't seen in years until vou run into them in a coffeehouse after thev've had about three ·huge cups of coffee feels," according to Doug. Their last show will be on April 15th, as Doug is moving to Portland a week later. "He's choosing to be with his girlfriend of three-and-a-half years instead of being a rock star. if you can believe it," stated a disgrun­tled anonymous source. Their best NAZZ memory is of their set last year when they played for a very enthusiastic crowd. They were dri­
ven to return to NAZZ this year by "a need for acceptance that stemi;; from some much deeper childhood issues we would prefer not to discuss in these pages," Doug said. They have elected to be the Anti Spice. Why? 
"Just 'cause." 
Sexual Chocolate 
"It's a nmss-around name for a mess­around band. We play to have a good tinrn and we don't take ourselves too seriously. So why would we need a "real" name?" Thus is Lhe rationaliza­tion behind the name ·sexual Chocolate." They started over a year ago with only a guitar, a voice and somr rrazy backup singPrs. They added a bassist and drummer to the band last Varettoni on acoustic guitar and sophomore Joe Madia on fllectric guitar. Ai;; for the name. it's of "ques­tionable origin" according to valid sources. They bring a unique sound that is "a weird mix of modern rock and funk, hard rock with acoustic guitar." They are currently working on compiling an album of ten original songs to be released in a few weeks. Wlrnn asked about the band's future. Bill said "We've always called it what it was. We said 'We're just gonna have fun in college.' It worked out really well." Doc Brown was a surprise hit at last year's NAZZ. Originally, they didn't make the cut, but when SUB extended the time and needed more bands, they brought Doc Brown in. Unexpectedly. they won third place. "We did it all on heart and soul; there were no gimmicks. Because of the situation going in. we lacked a lot of enthusiasm. But it turned out to be our best show. The audience erupted on the first chord and you could feel the electricity running through the band. It was worth it," Bill said. Look for Doc Brown to deliver a crowd pleasing performance. And remember Doc Brown for all your ailments. They're undeniably l lealthy Spice, cause everyone needs a good dose of Doc Brown. 

spring. With srmior .luan Pablo Montufar on guitar, junior Mickey McGarry on bass, sophomore Kevin O'Bryan on drums, sPnior John Tabis dolivrring lead vocals and the Pralinns ·n Dkk backup singers. their soumJ is compleLn. They call their style "eclectic." "Ifyou were honest. you would call our style completely random but really funny." Thriy said. They'wi been in.~pired by musical lligcnds like Poison. Color l\1e Gadd, Warrant, Bel Biv Divoe and Juvenile. They tt111d to play a lot of r,overs. though they do have a few originals. "In general we cover a lot of songs that most people feel shouldn't be 1'.overed at all. Funny songs, really bad songs. songs from 7th grade, or anything prw­ple can dance to." "Nazz last year was inr.redible. The best moment wa.o; when we looked out into the crowd and everyone head-banging to AC/DC's 'You Shook Me All Night Long."' Srxual Chocolate plans to continue to entertain the Notre Dame students at their l'avorite venue. AcoustiCafo, and at other campus gigs. They plan to hold a post-graduation national "Sexual Chocolate Reunion Tour" when they're in their 60s. Simply said, they an' Dudo Spice, "because we'n, calmer than you are. (Ever see the movie 'The Big Lebowski'?)" 
Wish a happy birthday to The Transoms tonight, as this year's NAZZ performance is the second anniversary of their first show together. Senior John Huston provides guitar and lead vocals. junior Scan Markey drilivers his talent on bass and Ph. D candidate Hon Garcia will seduce your auditory senses with his drum skills. This group is sum to delight everyone with their all-original songs. "l try to make my songs as unique and original as possible," said John, who writes the lyrics. The Transoms can bn defined as an emo band -post-hardcore, indie rock sound with emotional lyrics. 
They draw their style from bands like Nirvana. Braid. The Dismemberment Plan. Hazel, Kinda Like Spitting and others. The Transoms chose their name because it "allows thfl listenrr to intrrpret for himsrlf or herself what the undrriying thr,mes or ethos is behind the music," John said. For thosr of you who don't know, a transom is the window located above doorways (seen in some of the older dormsl. With this in mind. thr band's motto is "We're like the Doors, but higher." Their NAZZ appearance last yoar was well received by the crowd, so the guys are excited for tonight. their fourth Senior Bar appear­ance. With the amicability of the members of' this band. it is easy to sre why they chose to be lluggy Spice. As John said. "We like hugging people. Free hugs to all in exchange f'or votes!" 
Doc Brown camr, to be just before last year's NAZZ and has been going strong ever since. Senior Ryan Murphy leads on vocali;;, accompanied by senior Bart Lanahan on bass and back up vocals. senior Brian "Petra" Petrina on drums, senior Bill 

American Standard has brien together for a little over a year and has gained a lot of support in that short time. The band features the talt>nl'i of s<'nior I lolly Hoffman on lead vocals. senior Chris Osos on guitar. senior Grant Hamsny on drums. seuior Dan Puccini on guitar and sophomore Tom I !ayes on hass. Their :mund encompasses many diffornnt styles. "According to the guys in our band. our original stuff is inlltwnced by .Jewel. hut it doesn't really sound anything like Jrwel," band mPmbnrs said. Evervone in the band has their own dilforont tastes that affnct the sound they creatii. When the band plays covers. they "try to h,ok for good bar songs. flockin,' part.yin' tunes that a crowd ran get into." American Standard has progrosscd from their cover-band days to now playing all originals and they recently recorded their own CD. This will be their second NAZZ show. Their l'avoritl' momnnt is from last vcar's show. "When wr, bust11d out with "Sweet Child O"Mine"-man, that waijust 1-rotch-grabbingly great," they reminiscrd. They're hack this year for to take advantage of the rare opportunity for campus bands to be showcased. "When NAZZ rolls around it's a big deal. It's just a great way to get all the bands together and give them a big show," thfi band said. Thr, band as a whole would likf~ to be called Bed Spice cause they've got three rndheads. Though Holly added,"Personally. I would like to br called Ninja Spir,e, brcausP ninjas are neat-o."

81RD IN SPACE  
Their band, Bird In Space. plays an acoustic, folk sound inllu­enced by groups such as Indigo Girls and Bob Dylan. Their performance tonight will be a split between covPrs and originals.

Comprised of' senior Dom Valore on rhythm guitar, senior Mike Faloon on 
lead guitar, senior Chad Mikolajcik on bass. sophomore Will McGrath on 
drums and senior James Gomochak on vocals, this band will be making its

with a sound akin to that of' Pearl Jam and The Smashing Pump!Jns. "NAZZ 
is the perf°pct opportunity for an audience."Dom said. "We've played in our 
basement long enough. I think we're good enough to play live,"he added. 
Alizarin Crimson can most easily be likened to the broken mutllcr of a '77 Monte 
Carlo, "c:ausi> it's loud."

The members of Moonshine would like all to know that there is no con­nection between their name and alco­hol. Freshman Meaghan Netherly pro­vides lead vocals. freshman Tim Bradley comes in on guitar and vocals, sophomore Fish plays guitar and freshman Bill Taylor delivers percus­sion. They would like to thank their main influence, David Hassclhoff, though they have also been inlluenced by Ani DiFranco and music types such as ska, classic rock. punk and indie. They will present one original and some covers in their "god awful. fuzzy, catchy, pop, rock 'n roll mayhem" style. They appeared once at AcoustiCafe and would like to play there again, though they want to expand to play in "strip clubs and industrial porn theaters." The long­term goal for the band is a European tour. "We are self-proclaimed materi­alistic hogs," Fish said. "We're only at NAZZ for the money." Just call them Nudie Spice. "That will sell more albums than anything. It's all about the money." 
Lazy Blue Method 
Getting their start three weeks ago. Lazy Blue Method takes the individual interest,;; of each band member and incorporates them to make their band's sound. With freshman Ben Dillon on guitar and vocals, freshman Aaron Estes also on guitar and vocals. junior Tom Dolphin on drums and freshman Luis Moctezuma on bass, this group ha.., plenty of different musical interests to draw from. "We lis­ten to music ranging 

from Santana to Red Hot Chili Peppers to Pink Floyd ­and it all affects our sound," Luis said. Though the band is young, they're quick on the draw, already hav­ing two to three original songs to present. along with some covers, tonight at NAZZ. "We decided to· apply for NAZZ because we all wanted a band and an audi­ence, the opportunity for other people to hear us," Luis said. The guys want to keep playing together and to expand their gigs and play some parties. Though it's not quite certain why, the band insists they want to be the steering wheel. "because it's round."

Senior Justin Dunn has been playing music since he was three, when he picked up his first violin. lie started singing before high school and somewhere in those high school years, he quit the Yiolin. Len with his vocal talents, Justin decided to try the guitar freshman year here al Notre Oame to complete his songs and provide the opportunity to do more performing. .Justin practiced throughout his freshman year and was play­ing AcoustiCa.fo hy the end of the year. His sophomore year, Justin tl'amed up with his thl'n-Notrn Damn S<'nior brother, Aaron. to record a CD and play NAZZ. Last year. Justin gave a solo performance at NAZZ. What he rmnembcrs most was when he ran over time covering "JI' I !lad a Million Dollars" by Bare l\aked Ladies. Though they pulled the plug on him. the crowd kept right on singing. This year. Justin will sing a mix of covers and originals for us, with tho originals display­ing his "folk-alternative" sound. llis style takes some cues from Dave MattlHnvs Band. JackoPierce and Simon and Garl'unkJ.,I. An experienced NAZZer, Justin feels that the Batt!!' of the Hands is OM of the best things SUH does. "It's a 
healthy environ­
ment,;. Justin added. Lastly, .Justin wants to be Ginger Spice. and not because of her glamorous sex appeal, but because "she was wise enough to leave!" 
Bill 


Senior Bill Varettoni, a member of Doc Brown, is no stranger to performing. though the solo performance he will be gracing us with tonight is a rare treat. "Writing personal songs has always been my catharsis, though I seldom write to perform," Bill said. NAZZ will be Bill's third solo public performance. On stage will be Bil!, his acoustic guitar and original songs with a funky-rock sound. Most of his musical influence derives from Michael Hedges, who Bill declares a "phenomenal guitarist" and from music teachers over the years. Bill played NAZZ last year with Doc Brown. but says this year "l figured since l was leaving it would be nice to do something on my own." While Bill was confident in his decision to perform at NAZZ, he couldn't quite decide whether he would prefer 
to. be... ~urry Spice [ 1t s yel­low and packs a punch"] or the drive shaft or a car ["it gets stuff going"!.

Senior Christian Parilla will bn soothing our cars this evening with his jazz and blues vocals and style on the piano. Ilaving spent 17 years playing, Christian is sum to amaze the audience. 

Josie Vodicka is a second year grad­
uate student in creative writing. She's been playing guitar, 
singing and writing songs for about six 
years now She plays almost all originals. 
She listens to jazz. mainly, but also anything 
from Alison Krauss to Zap Mama. Hight 
now. she's a big fan of Lucinda Williams, a Ifolksy/countryish songwriter with a pop 
edge. "That's the kind of stuff I like to play, 
tlw kind of acoustic music that doesn't 
Pxartly fit into a neat genre, but plays off all 
sorts of influPnces. from jazz to world or 
what have you." Josie said. She played at 
NAZZ last year and thought it was a great 
experi1'nce. "It's interesting to see what 
people are doing musically on campus. It's a 
good event because some of these 

bands/solo acts seem to come out of the PhotocourtesyofJosieVocticka 
woodwork and it gives everybody a chance to hear campus musicians that don't necessarily play out a lot," she said. Josie plans to continue with music when she's done at '.\!otre Danw. As far as the car part or Spice Girl is concerned, Josie said "I would just rather not be the exhaust pipe !which is what the Spico Girls would be if they were part of an automo­bileJ."

Christian played at Lim Blues Festival two ynars ago and makes appearances at i\coustiCaf'c. and he also appeared in NAZZ last year. Tho most memorable monwnt for Christian from last year's performance was rolling a piano <lnwn tlrn sidnwalk. In tho frantic search for an instnrrn,nt, he was caught unprnpared and wingnd it quite successfully. "Making a fool of' myself in front of' a largo crowd is always a good idea," Christian said. And when it comes to cars, Chrislian sees himself' as a shoddy muf!ler. "It makes a lot ol' noise but keeps a rhythm going anyways."

gence in which the Warren 
Gulf Course will play a major 
role. 

The Crown Jewel 
With the Lalenl in place and opportunities to win ahead, the Irish have put themselves in great position to become a national power at the perfect time. With the Warren Golf Course sPt to open. the Irish will gain a powerful recruiting tool. The antiquated. relatively plain, nine-hole facility that previously served as the team's home course did little to attract recruits. The new 
Warren Golf Course, which purports itself to be of cham­pionship ralibN should sPrve as a recruiting magnet. The par 71 layout designed by two­time Masters champion Ben Crenshaw promises to be one of college golf's 
finest facilities. It's likely that the course's beautv will work to offset the recr11iting disadvantage l\'otre Dame has dnA to its weather. Many top recruits choose to play thrir college golf in the south, where warm Wfrnther allows for year round play. A course as nice as \Varren will go far in dissuading would be stars from venturing south. instead wooing them to Our Lady's University. 
Though the Wa.rrnn Course is not yet open to the public (the new target date is '.'vlay 1), members of the golf team have had a chanr,p to tPst their skills on the new links. 
"It's a great course, not too easy, not too difficult," Ratay noted. "I think it'll be a good home advantage for us. The greens are tricky, and undu­lating, so local knowledge is a goo<l thing to have." 
The course will favor shot­
makers, as accuracy of the tee 
will be required. The rourse's 
rather short layout (less than 
7000 yards) puts a premium 
on accuracy rather than dis­
tance. 
Hazards are common, as 
players will encounter lakes 
on both nines, as well as a 
creek that winds through the 
finishing holes. 
"You have to be accurate," 
Ratav said. "You need to keep 
it in play."

MEN'S TRACK AND FIELD 

Experience, training drive sprinter 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN ,\.,sociare -'f>Orts Editor 
Senior sprinwr Chris Codmm is reaping tlw rewards of four years worth of' hard work this sNtson. 
Cochran has racked up two Big East titl<'s and earned 
A I I 
American honors in the distance 

m e cl I e y Cochran rPl11y. "That's basically thf' ultimate thing lO do," said Cochran of being an All-American. Cochran rnn the 400-meter l1:ig on Notre Dame's senior-dominat­ed distance medley relay at the Indoors Nati01ml Championships. 
The squad captured sixth place in a timo or nine minutes, :~8.82 seconds. just of'f Lhe srhool record it set Aarlier this vear of 
9:38.15. Joining Cochran-on thr. All-American relay cre,v were seniors Tim KobPr on the 800­meter leg and Phil Mishka at 1200-meters, along with sopho­more Luke Watson i·unning the 1600-meter leg. 
"I can't say it was one of our best races, but we weren't that far off our best time," Cochran said. "Overall, we were looking to step it up a little bit more for the big meet, but in rnality, it did­nOt happen." 
Earlier in the indoor season, 
Cochran captured two of his 
three career Big East 
Championships. Last year, he 
won the 400-meter Outdoors 
Championship. This season, he 
beat out his opponents in the 60­
meter dash and the 400-meter 
run. 
Turning to his senior season, 
Cochran developed a sense of 
urgency. 
"The big change in my mind is you know ifs your last year," Cochran said. "Now it's do or die right now." 

Cochran's been accomplishing most of his goals for llrn year. Th<' biggPst aim lell on his list is winning a Big East Championship as a wam. As a team captain, pulling off Notro Dame's first-ever 13ig East Ch11mpionship would be a major feat. 
"He leads certainly bv his actions," hf\ad track ~nc( fi!'lct coach Joe Piane said. "Ile's a great runner. Ho's a many time Big East champion. Ihi'Il do any­thing that Coach 1.Jolinl Millar of sprints asks him to." 
Cochran's high school career was marrt. cl by a slew of' injuries. 
"Ho r.ame in with a lot of !al­enL." Piane said, "flut he Vias injured a great deal during high school, so I think thal his tfthint was largely untapped." 
In becoming onP or Notre Dame's best track athl<'tos, Cochran devoted a greaL deal ol' time in tl1f\ off-season to training and practice. He also became more in tune with how much strnss his body can handle, lead­ing him to avoid the injuries that plagued his high school career. 
"Weights is the big thing that's 
led me to be healthv," Cochran 
said. "I think that's also led to my 
body being stronger, and led my 
body to not be as susceptible to 
injury." 
With the added strength, 
Cochran had raised his expecta­
tions and lowered his times on 
the track. In the 200-mctcr dash. 
he is aiming to run around 21 
seconds by the end of the year, 
while in the 400-meter run, 46 
seconds is the time to beat. 
'Tve always been striving to be 
high 45s, low 46s," Cochran said. 
When Cochran won the 400­
meter run at February's Big East 
Indoors Championships, he ran a 
strong time of :47.76, but one 
that, in his mind, leaves room for 
improvement.

sivc 13-3 record has earned th<' team a No. 24 ranking by Collegiate Bas!"ball, i'> coming off of its best start sinr,f! the 
1963 tr.am openfld the season 15-3. Thny will attempt to surpass that record in three games against a Villanova team that finished last season 27-26-1 and tied fur seventh place in the Big East. 
The Irish lead the all-time series against their conl'er­nnce opponP.nt: winning eight of the 10 contests between the clubs. Last season. the Irish swept a doubleheader over tlrn Wildc:ats. winning 4­0 in the l'irst game and 10-8 in the sewnd. 
Head coach Paul Mainieri !'eels strong heading into the opening games of conf'erencc play. 
"Our pitr.hing has been strong all season." he said. "And during our last few games the offense has really began to perform. I couldn't be happier with our team right now." 
The Irish will send their top thrne pitr.hf'rs out against the Wildcats. For Saturday's dou­blr.hcrn.der. junior co-captain Aaron lleilman and senior Scott Cavev take the mound for Notre hame. Freshman right-hander Matt Laird throws thB finale on Sunday afternoon. lleilman has yet to viBld a run in 10.2 i:areer innings against the Wildcats. I-le has silenced the Villanova bats to the tune of 13 strike­outs and no walks while col­lecting one win and one save. 
CavPy. a senior leader fin­ishing off a stellar career, has dominated in winning all thnw of his starts this season. The right-hander was forc:ed to miss his last scheduled start in Florida after being hit by a line drive. He is, howev­er, expected to return at full­strength on Saturday. 
Laird has filled a gaping void in the I.rish rotation this season. Hec:ording a 1-0 rncord to go along with a 1.98 EHA. Laird has solidif'ied thi> rotation behind studs Heilman and Cavey. 
The offense has been pow­ered by freshman Brian Staviskv. whose four home runs an·d .638 slugging per­centage lead the team. 
'Tm feeling really r.omfort­able aL the plate right now," Stavisky said, "The coaches have really been helping me a lot." 
Sophomore r.enter fielder Steve Stanley has been pro­ductive while batting in the second spot for thf' Irish. I-ff' leads the team with seven steals in eleven attempts to go along with his .407 batting average. 
Villanova is led by junior second baseman Matt Longo. who was named a first team all-Big East selection last sea­son and is rated by Baseball America as the 105th best prospect among draft-eligible college players. First base­man Rob Cafiero's .361 sea­son an d 1 0 ho me ru n s las t season earned him a spot on the Big East all-rookie team. 
Play begins at 12 noon on both Saturday and Sunday.

Dear Mr. lvlurphy. 

Players of your raliber are rare. especially at schools when~ football mediocritv often out­ranks basketball iuccess. It's bPen a pleasurn for wn who had to endure the MacLeod vears to watch you play and retti'rn respect to a basketball program that sorely lacked it only two years ago. 
As adept as your skill is though, it's the almost childlike love for the game that you dis­play on the court that makes you enjoyable to watch. You capture the spirit of college basketball. 
I know that you've never explicitly said that you're consid­ering leaving us for the NBA after this season. but you have commented that it's not out of the question. I sincernly hope that you rid yourst>lf of any con­sideration for your teammates, your fans, your school, the thou­sands of Domer kids that hope to be Troy Murphy some day and for Troy Murphy. Stay for your­self. You're one of the best play­ers in the entire r.ountry right now. You 're a front-runrnff for next year's awards. You poten­tially can af'hieve what only three players have previously in Big East history, winning player­of-the-year two years in a row. 
You can establish yourself as one of the greats in Big East his­torv. 
/\side from simply personal achievement, you appear to have so much fun playing, a joy that's a rarity in the money-driven NBA. Ask Corey Maggette if he regrets giving up a chance to be the best player at Duke and enjoying March Madness for being a bench player in Orlando and enduring a losing season. 
You can't go back to college. The NBA will be around for years to come. You r,ould cost yourself millions. The rookie salary scale increases in value as your draft position becomes higher. While this year you look to be a mid-first-round pick, next year you could be a high-lottery pick. Thus, the riches of the NBA may be greater the longer you wait. 
You certainly could succeed in the NBA. That doesn't take away the fact. that you simply aren't ready. Another year of college will help you increase your size and strength. preventing oppo­nent<; from brutalizing you on defense. ls it a coincidence that your worst games were against teams that had big, physical post players that could assault you each trip down the court'? 

Learn this lesson in college and still dominate the game or learn it inthc pros and try to shake the disappointment label. Would you rather be Antawn Jamison, who has ber.omc a good player only after struggling for a year, or Tim Duncan who immediately made an impact'? 
Stay for your teammates. You once said that one of the reasons you came here was bocause you and David Graves wanted to build something together. You've begun to do that. But just as an architect doesn't abandon his design in mid-form, you shouldn't abandon your pro­gram. Don't leave your team­mates on the cusp of respectabil­ity. 
Stay for the selection commit­tee that shunned us. Give them no reason to be able to do so next year. Earn some redemp­tion. 
Stay for Ryan Humphrey who waited an entire year to play with you in hopes of alleviating the triple teams you draw. Stay for the Domer basketball fans who can smell the successes tha1 our fathers enjoyed and now want to taste it. 
Stay for Notre Dame. We havfm't had a basketball player

Irish going to Carolina to take on UNC, No. 5 Duke 
Ry RACHEL BIBER Sports Writer 
Wlrnn the upclaled rankings wPrc released bv tho l11t1rcollegiatc ·Tennis Association this week. the Irish rrnrn's tirnnis team recognized tlw diflkult task ahead of them. The numbers arP not scaring them away from the challenge. 
No. 23 Notre Dame heads to the East this weekend to take on No. 28 North Carolina on Saturday and No. 5 Duke on Sundav. 
"lt's·obviously a big weekend for us," Irish head coach Bob Bayliss said. "[North Carolina and Duke! are formidable oppo­nents but it's not a chall<~nge we are afraid of taking on. We are excited and ready to go." The Irish hope to extinguish the recent hot streak of the North Carolina Tar Heels -a team that leaped from No. 44 to ~o. 28 in the recent rankings. The Tar Jfoels won two big matches last week. ovflr South Carolina and Florida State, to improve to 8-2 overall and 1-0 in the ACC. Depth seems to bo an asset foi· tlrn Tar Hm~ls, and the Irish will look to counter that strength by continuing their strong doubles play and by taking advantage of the opportunities for wins in the top part of the lineup. "We arc playing very good doubles right 

now," Bayliss said. ''I'd like to think that is ber.oming a strength for us." 
Notre Dame also made a remarkable jump in the latest rankings due to a strong showing at last week's Blue-Gray National Classic in Montgomery, Alabama, where it posted big wins over Virginia and UAB. The 9-5 Irish earned a season high ranking of 23 after being slotted at No. 36 last week. The Tar Heels also

series Duke leads 9-4, but Notre Dame has won two of the last three meetings overall and two of the last three matches at Duke. The Irish posted 4-3 wins at Duke when the Blue Devils were ranked fourth in 1994 and 1:~th in 1998. Notre Dame also won a 4-3 match over eighth­ranked Duke at home in 1997. Duke comes into the weekend's compelilion after suffering a string of losses to now eighth­ranked Baylor, top ranked UCLA, and fourth ranked 
Pepperdine, dropping to 9-4 on the season. The Blue Devils have not been defeated three straight times since the 1993-94 season. 
With a singles squad that .is 
the season. 

The Irish squad will most likely have all their weapons intact as they hit the road for the uprnming com­petition. Aaron Talarico, who has been pestered by an ankle injury, has been cleared to play after fear that his pains were a result of a stress fracture. Talarico will definitely appear with doubles partner Javier Taborga to form the No. 1 Irish duo in doubles. but Brian Farrell will be ready to fill in if Bayliss decides to pull Talarico from the singles lineup. 
In the end, the rankings are mflaningless and the intensity and quality of' play of the Irish will be the deciding factor in determining the wins and losses.
