SMC students race for scholarship 
By JAMIE BELCHER 
News Writer 
Her sister once said only a 
symphony  could begin  to  
describe her.  
Among  other  things,  

Suzanne Kondratenko was a sister to seven girls. She graduated in the top of her class from Saint Mary's College in 1996 and after spending time in Rome, it became one of her passions. 
Suzanne's sister Caroline is now a senior at Saint Mary's and also went on the Rome Program. Caroline says that her life so far. parallels her older sister's. 
"She was the reason I ended up going. She's the reason I'm at Saint Mary's. She's the reason I went on 
the Rome Program," Caroline said. 
Suzanne was killed while working in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. 2001. A scholarship has been sot up in her memory to assist a stu­dent wishing to go on the Rome program. 
Peter Checca. an Italian professor at Saint Mary's and the director of the Rome pro­gram, spoke to Suzanne at her class reunion last year. 
"Although she loved her work, her ultimate dream was to· return to Rome some day and become the director of the Rome Program," Checca said. 
The day of their conversa­tion, according to Checca, Suzanne described how Rome influenced her and changed her life. 
"She'd be really glad just to give someone the opportunity to go," said Caroline. 
Soon. Suzanne will have such an opportunity. This year's Oktoberfest Run/Walk held tomorrow will be in memory of Suzanne and raise money for the scholarship fund. 
Joan Muecke, Abby VanV1erah and Courtney King, among others are establishing a team to run in Suzanne's memory. Muecke received some assistance going on the Rome Program and explains what a wonder­ful experience her sophomor_e year in Rome was to her. 
Chris Pfau is organizing the event to be held tomorrow in front of Angela Athletic Facility at 4 p.m_. Participants

Coordinators of the Paid 
Community Service Program say 
poor advertising and program stip­
ulations may have contributed to a 
lack of student interest. 
The program, which allows stu­
dents to do service and receive 
work-study pay, has roughly 20 
local agencies, said Cortney Swift, 
senior financial aid admmistrator. 
"Many students tutor children in 
reading and math," Swift said, 
adding that the Center for the 
Homeless and Robinson 
Community Learning Center 
employ the greatest number of 
Notre Dame students through the 
program. 
Junior Adam Senior is one of the 
many students who work at the 
Robinson Learning Center as a 
tutor and said he feels rewarded 
by helping others. 
"vVhen l do it, I don't treat it as 
just tutoring. It's more than just 
doing homework," Senior said. 
According to Swift, 40 positions 
remain available in the service 
program and the program is still 
looking for stud1mts who want to 
work in the community. 
"We're always looking for people 
to fill positions," Swift said. 
The two employment programs 
that Notre Dame offers are Federal 
Work-Study and Campus · Employment. 
Any student who fills out the 
Free Application for Federal 
Student Aid (FAFSA) is eligible for 
community service positions with 
some exceptions.

financial aid or do not qualify for

SMC pride 
It began in 1843, when four Sisters of the Holy Cross Order came from Le Mans, France, with the dream to open a college in northern Indiana. One year later, in 1844, the sisters opened their first school and Saint Mary's Sarah Nestor College was born. And 158 years S . M ,
later. the Sisters of amt ary s 
News Editor
the Holy Cross are still here, lending support to Saint Mary's, as the College has educated thousands of women over the years. 
How is that significant today? Today is the start of Saint Mary's pride week. A week in which Saint Mary's women, pre­sent and past, celebrate the College her­itage, students, athletes and each other's accomplishments. 
With the freedom and encouragement that students receive from the College the women of Saint Mary's are always amazing me, whether it is missionary work in China, internships that have resulted in patents or with beautiful poetry written in class. 
While the brochures are true when they state that the campus is beautiful, dorm rooms are usually big, cl.asses are small and that the College has some impressive rankings and statistics, these would all be at the bottom of my list of reasons for Saint Mary's pride. It is the students, professors and staff I know that makes the College special to me. 
No, Saint Mary's isn't for everyone and I'll admit that. Despite the fact that Saint Mary's was the only college I applied to, or wanted to go to, I didn't even like it that much my freshman year. Taking initiative I applied for the Saint Mary's Ireland program, hoping that a year away would provide me with a better college experience. 
I'm not going to gush on and on about how much studying abroad changed me, but it did. My attitude towards Saint Mary's also changed, I was sad about coming back but I couldn't wait to the girls that were my family for a year. 
To me Saint Mary's will always repre­sent the great friendships I have made, in my year in Ireland and while on cam­pus, friendships that I know will always be there. 
While primarily I will have positive memories of Saint Mary's, it is not a per­fect institution and the women who attend are not perfect. There are plenty of issues that upset me about Saint Mary's: the fact that there is not recog­nized support for lesbian, bisexual or questioning women, that there is not a recycling program and even the fact that the dining hall closes at 7 p.m. all annoy me. 
There are plenty of outlets to voice my concerns, whether at a Board of Governance meeting, talking with the hall director or even e-mailing or setting up an appointment with the College president or vice presidents. I may not like the answer I get, or agree with it, but from experience I have always got­ten one. · 
So this week celebrate Saint Mary's pride by celebrating the people you know at Saint Mary's, by questioning what you don't like about the College and working to change it for yourself and future generations.

Panel discusses college and religion 
ByJIM GAFFEY News Writer 
A panel of university presi­dents from prominent Christian colleges gathered Friday afternoon in McKenna Hall Auditorium as part of this weekend's "From Death to Life" conference. The panel, entitled "The Future of Christian Higher Education," included Charles Dougherty, the president of Duquesne University, Robert Sloan, president of Baylor University, and Father Edward Malloy. president of Notre Dame. 
Each speaker expressed different points important to the mission and identity of private Christian universities. Dougherty emphasized the unique role Christian univer­sities play in a religiously pluralistic society. 
"I think U.S. society is drift­ing towards un amorphous spirituality," he said. "There's a hunger for values in America, and our universi­ties help fill that." 
The success of Christian universities is part of a new counter-movement to grow­ing secularization in society, and for them to compromise -their mission would be to lose both part of their identi­ty and their niche in the economy, Dougherty 
said. "It is more important to 
Sloan, in his

Univer­
sity in 
Erie, Pa., 
during a 
special 
ceremony 
Thurs­
day. It is 


his 14th Malloy 
s u C h 
honor. 

Notre Dame's 16th presi­
dent, Malloy was elected by 
the Board of Trustees in 
1986. Now in his third five­
year term. he has led the 
University at a time of 
rapid growth in its reputa­
tion, faculty and resources. 
During his tenure, Notre 
Dame's faculty has 
increased by more than 
350, the academic quality 
of the student body has 
improved dramatically, and 
the number of minority stu­
dents has more than dou­
bled. 

The University's endow­
ment of approximately $3 
billion is among the top 20 
in higher education, and its 
recently completed 
"Generations" capital cam­
paign raised $1.1 billion, 
by far the most successful 
in the history of Catholic 
higher education and just 
the 12th billion-dollar cam­
paign ever for a private 
university. 

Malloy has been a driving 
force behind efforts to pro­
mote community service 
and combat substance 
abuse in higher education. 
A member of the advisory 
board of AmeriCorps and 
the National Civilian 
Community Corps, he also

the Points of Light l -Foundation, a member of l 
the board of governors of 
the Boys and Girls Club of .1 
America, and a member of 
the Indiana Community 
Service and Volunteer 
Committee and the Indiana 
Commission on Community 
Service. 

In combating substance abuse, Malloy has served as a member of numerous organizations, including the National Advisory Council on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. the President's Advisory Council on Drugs. the 
Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, the Governor's Commission for a Drug-Free Indiana, and the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia University. He also current­ly serves as cochair of the subcommittee on college drinking of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a compo­nent of the National Institutes of Health, and chairs the National Commission on Substance Abuse and Sports for CASA.

Death toll higher than thought in ferry sink 
Associated Press 
DAKAR 

In long, solemn lines, thou­sands of people pored over pho­tos Sunday of the bloated bodies from one of Africa's deadliest ferry accidents, as the govern­ment said that nearly 1,000 people are now believed dead. 
Only 64 people are known to have survived when the MS Joela capsized off Africa's West Coast in heavy winds Lale Thursday. On Sunday, the gov­ernment said that 1,034 people were on board the ship, sharply up from the 797 it had first announced. 
By midday Sunday, Gambian and Senegalesc sailors, dive teams and other searchers had collected 352 bodies from the ferry, the water and from along the coast, where some were washing up, said Aminata Dibba, permanent secretary for Gambia's presidency. ' 
Six refrigerated ship contain­ers with bodies inside were lined up in the capital's port, while hundreds more disinte­grating bodies were offshore waiting to be brought in. 
Authorities planned Monday to finish an investigation into what caused the Senegalese state-run boat to sink off Gambia, a former English colony about 30 miles across at its widest point that divides north and south Senegal. 
Grieving family members studied photos of the dead in hopes of identifying rapidly decomposing victims. 
"Now there seems to be little chance they'll come back alive," said Tijane Jalow, 29, who had three brothers on board. 
"This is awful, awful, awful. I'm inconsolable," he said, pinching his eyes. 
On Sunday, the government added the 55-member crew and said 185 passengers had board­ed the doomed ferry at a second stop en route from southern Senegal, bringing the total aboard to 1,034, said Diadji Toure, communication's adviser for Senegal's prime minister. 
Authorities set up five "crisis centers" in Dakar to display photos of those retrieved from the wreckage. Boy Scouts rushed bottled water and food to more than 3,000 people who waited in line throughout the day, officials said. 
Ambulance teams tended to people who passed out from temperatures of about 92 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Many victims' faces were too waterlogged to be recognizable. One bleary-eyed woman wailed "Papa, Papa!" as she was helped away from a display. 
At the port in Dakar, young men crouched in the shade, 


People look Sunday in the Dakar city hall at a list of survivors from the MS Joola ferry which capsized off the coast of Gambia Sept. 26. The ferry was carrying 1,034 people when it left Ziguinchor for the Senegalese capital of Dakar. Nearly 1,000 are believed to be dead.

IN BRIEF 
Shippers: West Coast port stays shut 
A frail labor peace between shipping lines and West Coast longshoreman collapsed Sunday when workers were ordered off their jobs indefinitely. 
The Pacific Maritime Association, which represents the shipping lines, said it would bar workers from the docks until the union agrees to extend a lapsed contract while talks toward a new agreement continue. 
West Coast ports handled more than $300 billion in cargo over the past year. Continued labor unrest could cost the U.S. economy an estimated $1 billion a day. 
"They're just doing whatever they're doing," said Steve Stallone, a spokesman for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. 
Association president Joseph Miniace called Sunday's action a "defensive shutdown" that came less than 12 hours after longshoremen returned to the docks at the 29 major Pacific ports. 
Shipping lines imposed a lockout Friday immediately after talks broke down. That lockout was lifted, then reimposed after the association accused the union of understaffing operations and dispatching unskilled workers. 
Former VP to give policy speech 
Al Gore plans to offer his views on the U.S. economy Wednesday in a major policy speech on the topic at a time the political debate has turned increasingly toward Iraq and the pos­sibilities of war. 
The former vice president helped stir up that debate over Iraq with a speech a week ago in San Francisco criticizing the Bush administration for its policies on Iraq. 
Gore told a crowd at the Commonwealth Club that the Bush administration should not allow Iraq to distract this country from the war on terrorism and said the United States should work more with the United Nations to get the broadest possible support for chang­ing regimes in Iraq.

Tyco case: board vs. executives 
Associated Press 
CONCORD, N.H. 

The case against three former Tyco International Ltd. executives accused of looting the company could boil down to a blame game between the board of directors and the defen­dants, legal experts say. 
Tyco documents show some board members knew of certain loans to top executives -knowledge which could help the defense. But those docu­ments also include details of extrava­gance in how the money was spent, and that could hurt the defendants, according to former federal prosecu­tor Gregory Wallance. 
"They're bringing the charges in the middle of a climate of public out­rage at executives pigging out at the expense of investors," Wallance said. "The sheer magnitude of the money is going to be a problem for the defense." · 
A recent Tyco filing with the Sewritics and Exchange Commission said former chief executive Dennis Kozlowski, former chief financial offi­cer Mark Swartz and former general counsel Mark Belnick enriched them­selves at the company's expense. The company also has filed a civil suit against Kozlowski, seeking $7 30 mil­lion. 
Prosecutors have accused 
. Kozlowski and Swartz of stealing $600 million from Tyco, and both are charged with enterprise corruption and grand larceny. Belnick was charged with falsifying business records to conceal $14 million in improper loans. 
The three men have pleaded inno­cent, and their lawyers have said any money they received was approved. 
The king of excess was Kozlowski, Tyco maintains. One example cited by the company: a $2.1 million birthday party Kozlowski threw last year for his wife, Karen, on the Italian island of Sardinia. In documents filed with the SEC, Tyco says it footed half the bill.

Time for talk is over 
Let's say you are the President, and the date is July 1, 2001. And let's say that America's intelligence systems (as they failed to do in reality) put together all the pieces au<l stated that a terrorist aJtack from a foreign group, Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, would strike U.S. soil sometime in the next three months and kill thousands of Americans. Do you: 
A. Launch a fierce preemptive attack, designed to destroy the threat before it can materialize, or 

B. Petition the United Nations to draft resolutions, plead with the other four members of the U.N. Security Council to gain acceptance, and wait for Congressional approval? 
Obviously hindsight tells us that the proper answer is the first. Yet com­mon sense tells us that as well. You wouldn't know that by listening to those people against a preemptive strike against Iraq, though. I admit, the situation may not be quite as dire as the hypothetical posted above, but it's only tragic hindsight which has shown us how severe the threat al­Qaeda was 15 months ago. The threat Saddam Hussein poses may not be exactly the same, but it's similarly imminent and clear. 
Our Commander-in-Chief, regard­
. less of whether it's George ,v. Bush, George H.W. Bush. William J. Clinton -or, in our little hypothetical game, you -has the authorization by our Constitution to protect America and its citizens. Yet the President's oppo­nents can think of a million different reasons not to act, but·can't grasp the fundamental reason why we should. 
Global politics and foreign policy can be complicated., but in this case, there are simple questions, and there are simple answers. Is Saddam Hussein a vicious and evil tyrant? Does he possess weapons that can cause unimaginable horrors? Is he attempting to acquire nuclear weapons'' The answer to all of these is yes. We've known this for years, of course, but a 50-page dossier issued last week by the British government reinforces these facts. 

Another equally simple conclusion that can be drawn is that Hussein will not stop based on any international resolution made against him. He's vio­lated more than a dozen U.N. r~solu­tions already in the decade-plus since the end of the Gulf War. And history teaches us that in the face of a tyran­nical threat, diplomacy not backed by the threat of force only emboldens the tyrant -.it does not contain him. 
The onus should therefore be on those who do not support action against Iraq to provide a compelling case. So far, they have yet to come up with even a coherent case. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.). Senate Majority Leader and the highest-ranking Democrat in Washington, can only express "concern." Last week, he thought it over and heightened his rhetoric; he now expresses "grave concern." 
Al Gore, who broke ranks with his own party and supported the Gulf War, admonished President George H.W.,Bush for leaving Saddam in power, and served as Vice President in an administration which made sev­eral unilateral strikes against Iraq, made a speech last week in San Francisco that threw out that legacy and argued feebly against it. Even The 1'.ew Republic, which twice endorsed Gore for President, said the speech "sounded like a political broadside against a president who Gore no doubt feels occupies a post that he himself deserves." 
And there are still grumbles interna­tionally that an independent America that acts in its own self-defense is more terrifying than a madman with weapons of mass destruction. · German Justice Minister Berta Di:iubler-Gmelin compared George W. 
Bush to Hitler by saying Bush was 
using Iraq to shift the focus away from 
domestic issues in a political cam­
paign. Ironically, thi~ statement took 
place in the midst of the German elec­
tion season; though the anti­
Americanism played well and center­
loft Chancellor Gerhard Schroder won 
reelection, he thankfully relieved Frau 
Daubler-Gmelin of her duties. 
To a certain extent, the objections 
are steeped in good intentions. While 
President Bush and his braintrust, 
buttressed by the support of British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair, have laid 
out a case for action against Iraq, 
they've been somewhat caught up in 
their mission to address some bigger 
questions. If preemptive action 
against terror networks and rogue 
states is going to be the Bush 
Doctrine, we should at least have an 
honest discussion about our rules of 
engagement in the future, if for no 
other reason than to reassure our ·allies. 
But that should not be used as an 
excuse to sit around and wait while 
the threat grows. In three months' 
time, Saddam Hussein may very well 
have a nuclear weapon. This would be 
a problem not just because he could 
detonate it on a whim, but also 
because it would give him leverage he 
doesn't possess now. It would be easy 
for him to invade Kuwait or Saudi 
Arabia if he can blackmail the United 
States with a weapon aimed at Tel 
Aviv, or London, or Washington. The 
United States and the United Kingdom 
are the only ones who'll stop him now; 
who will stop him then? 
There have been months to talk 
about it. Action is needed now -not 
more talking.

Life can be rough, but appreciate the ride 
Last night I saw one of my liest friends in the Peace Corps give a con­cert. In his former life he was an acting major and writer who aspired to be in pictures in People Magazine and to cre­ate art his audience could understand. Maite Uranga Now he lives in the village 45 minutes away from me. 
When I was at Life in Africa home I saw my col­lege roommate, and for the first time since we met six years ago there was not even one night or debauchery. 1am turning 25 in six months. Soon I will be closer to 30 than to 20. 
I have sat in the desert for over a year 
-and somewhere in that time my friends and I seemed to have grown up. Serious relationships have come into the pic­ture. Others have been continuously single for the first time since high school and finally get to spend time with themselves. I finally came to terms with the fact that applying to law school does not mean that H1e adventure is over. My brother is taking a yea:r off of medical school because in much simpli­fied terms he figured out life is not about the destination. 
Everyone has heard 1.hese cliches. And it is highly likely that most people have experienced a lot of them. But within the vanity of the mid-twenties age group, an individual and a group of friends think that they are discovering the world as it has never been seen before. We think we know it all because we are at a top-25 university and spent a semester living somewhere else. Our friends live in other cities, states and countries, which makes us worldly. Our parents do not know where we arc on Friday nights and do not know if we ever go to class. We think we are inde­pendent. 
Then we graduate. We realize a liber­al arts degree is hard to sell, especially with an economic downturn. We under­stand· the fast track to the corner office requires a lot of time, but more chal­lengingly a lot of sacrifice. And friends who knew they wanted to be a doctor since they were two suddenly decide to apply to MFA programs instead. Friends start getting married. Friends start having children. Friends get divorced. Suddenly your life-long friends from college no longer seem to be life-long when you have not talked to them in six months and then two years.. 
Amidst all this, largely because of the pretentiousness that education pro­vides, we search for ourselves. The world is tragic and we are idealistic. We can solve the world's problems although no one ever asks us. The Sahara, the isolation, the distance and the time have helped me grow up. I have not lost all of my idealism and arrogance, although some of the inno­cence floated away in the three years since graduation. Perhaps because I did not see my brother and friends for so long, when I finally did on vacation home the same thing seemed to have happened to them amidst the chaos. 
After trying to escape the influence of two lawyer parents, I resigned that it also happened to be what I wanted. Even more shocking is that my need for continual roaming seems to have been greatly appeased. The actor who lives 45 minutes from me loves theater and everything it involves. He will end up in New York. For now, though, we enjoy the freedom that being away from it provides. My brother still wants to be a doctor but decided a year in Spain is also a great option. My college room­mate and I did not want to waste our precious time together in a bar and talked more in five days than we did for a month in college. 
One day the actor and I reflected over our Peace Corps experience. Over a year ago, we decided our lives in Mauritania could best be summarized as, "This sucks. We live in hell." After nearly a year and a half I think we still think we live in hell. But what the hell if we don't like hell. Sure, there are rough days, but at least we know that some­times you've got to go to hell to get to heaven. And on those long hot days when everything seems to be going wrong and the world is going to fall off its axis, I have grown to appreciate the ride.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Joint committee examines honor code controversy 
We write to thank The Observer for the attention it has given the recently revised Academic Code of Honor in a front page article on Sept. 25 and an editorial on Sept. 27. Undergraduate students will soon receive, if they have not already, an email explaining in greater detail some of the more significant revisions of the honor code. The revision of the honor code and the attention it has been given will, we hope, heighten awareness of issues of academic integrity throughout the University. 
In its Sept: 27 editorial The Observer raised an important issue regarding the faculty's use of Turnitin.com, an internet plagiarism detection service the University has recently con­tracted. "While a service like Turnitin.com should be employed in cases where professors have a reasonable suspicion of dishonesty," The Observer argues, "it should not be used as a standard procedure in the grading process." 
The Observer's concerns are shared by members of the faculty and they merit careful con­sideration. The appropriate use of Turnitin.com will be taken up by the University Code of Honor Committee, a body composed ofsix students and six faculty members, which will · begin discussion of this issue at its first meeting today. 
While we are grateful to The Observer for its interest and for raising an important issue, we strongly disagree with its claim in the Sept. 27 editorial that "the honor code revisions and the contract with Turnitin.com indicate that trust [between professors and students] has been broken." 
On the contrary, trust and common commitment to academic integrity has never been gre·ater. The revision of the honor code is the result of a great deal of hard and conscien­tious work, with wide consultation by faculty and students; the new code enhances the role of students, working with faculty, in the administration honor code procedures; and it was passed unanimously by the Academic Council, a body which includes both faculty and stu­dent representation. The University community should be proud of the joint efforts of faculty and students to defend and even strengthen academic integrity at Notre Dame. 
Regarding the contract with Turnitin.com, this service was intended as a tool to assist individual faculty and honesty committees to exonerate students as well as to establish that dishonesty has occurred. Whether Turnitin.com should be used by individual faculty in cases in which there is no prior suspicion of dishonesty is an important question, and a poli­cy concerning its use will be debated and established by the students and faculty of the University Code of Honor Committee. But the fact that this tool has been acquired does not determine how it will be used, and so we do not believe the mere acquisition of the Turnitin.com service is in itself a sign of broken trust. 
As the University Code of Honor Committee discusses the appropriate use of Turnitin.com and other issues related to the implementation of the honor code, we welcome contributions from members of the University community. Please feel free to pass your observations and opinions on to us or other members or the committee. Academic honesty is the concern and responsibility of every student and faculty member at Notre Dame. The students and faculty of the University Code of Honor Committee welcome your thoughts as it strives to make decisions in light of the ideals of Notre Dame's honor code.

Biblical instructions 
not always relevant to 
modern times 
This letter is in response to Becket Gremmels' Sept. 27 let­ter. 
So, Becket -you don't hate gay people? That's great. You have gay relatives? Terrific. Wait-you even talk to them, too? Well, Hallelujah. (Pun entirely intended.) Please stop shining your medal for a second and read this. 
Something tells me -gut instinct -that you count your gay friends on your hands. And by that, I don't mean that you only choose to have this many or that many gay friends. I say you count them on your hands so that you can say you have gay friends. ("Well, there's Tommy, he's one. And Amy, yeah, Amy's two. And, well, no one knows about Mark, but I'm totally counting him.") 
The best defense to any argu­ment -especially one you have such thin evidence to back up, like yours -is to use your own life as an example. But please, don't use your friends and family as backup and then throw out a Bible quote that equates them with "theft, kidnapping, murder, greed, fratricide, lying and law­lessness." I know Tomm,y, Amy and Mark would be so proud. 
So since I'm assuming we're taking the Bible so literally these days, you would tell me to shut my big yap (or stop my fingers from typing) and marry a man I don't know and start making him babies, right? Or that I should start building a tent now, in which I can take solace once my period comes because a menstruating woman is unclean and unfit to be in society. (Shh, I'll let you in on a little secret: this is what the Bible says, too. Not just that gay people are wrong, wrong, wrong.) 
I won't directly quote from the Bible because there are so many different versions and so many different interpretations of the book o' rules. And maybe a word you should start researching, Becket, is this: interpretation. 
Just because it's written down, in a big, fat book o' rules, doesn't mean it's a. Meant to be taken literally; or b. meant to be taken literally in the 21st centu­ry. Countless events, laws and changes have passed since the Bible's inception, for example, the Civil Rights Movement, the Women's Movement, Vatican II. Catholic doctrine has been inter­preted over the years to adapt to modern society. In 2002, should sinners or law-breakers be made to wear a crown of thorns? I think not. But, or course, that's just how I interpret it. 
But I must say that your final, most moving point was when you note, "God didn't drop the ball on this one; He took it to the basket." That's funny you say that, because I swear I don't remember reading anywhere in the Bible that God played bas­ketball.

Scene Editor 

Friday night: The band takes the stage casting aside empty bot­tles of Boone's Farm wine. They gear up their instruments and proceed to rock the garage to the sounds of Dave Matthews band. Of course, the version of 'The Space Between" the group performs sounds more like Dave Matthews playing at Ozzfest after dropping an entire sheet of acid and snorting a couple king sized pixie sticks. The band: The Kinky Boot Beasts, the self-pro­claimed class clowns of the campus music scene. 
The band, composed of junior guitarist Dave Lodewyck and senior guitarist Joe Andrukaitis, is one of the most talked about bands on campus. Of course, that might be more a facet of the group's just-escapecl-from-an-institution-for-the-criminally­insane appeal than their musical talent, but who needs talent to be a rock star? 
The Kinky Boot Beasts formed the day after NAZZ, Notre Dame's annual battle of bands, in 2001. Fellow Fisher Hall resident and acoustic crooner Phil Wittliff was scheduled to play at an acoustic festival called ND at Nite, but could­n't make the event and asked then freshman Lodewyck to fill in. 
Lodewyck teamed up with Andrukaitis and the pair hastily drew up a set list and formed a band. They toyed with various names such a.s Phil La.y.tio, in hom­age to their benefactor, and finally settled on The Kinky Boot Beasts. 
Garbed in a wig once used to portray Jesus in a Department of Film, Television and Theatre mainstage show and king cobra hats, the Kinky Boot Beasts took the stage singing Johnny Cash songs and as many '80s power ballads as they could remember attempting to make as big of a mockery of the event as they could. 
After their iconoclastic set, the pair rushed to gath­er their gear and make a cunning getaway disband­ing the one-hit wonder Boot Beasts, but fortune changed that. 

"At the end of the whole thing one of the girls who was responsible for setting the whole thing up ran up to us and we thought, 'Oh no, here it comes. We're about to get an earful.' And she was clearly worked up, so we we 're expecting her to be made for making a mockery of her 


event. whereas she said ·that was so tunny,"' Lodewyck said. "We really thought it was just going to be a one time thing," Andrukaitis said. And so the Kinky Boot Beasts were born. 
Despite the fact that the Boot BP,asts almost never practice, the group still manages to land an occasional gig. The band even attends those gigs when they can remember and/or are sober enough to find the correct address. . 
"It really hasn't required any practice, although perhaps it should have. I find that being well practiced and together as a band is more of a liability for the Boot Beasts," Lodewyck said.

A Letter from Fr. Bill Lies, the CSC's Executive Director 
These are tough days in which we live. Sometimes we find our­selves wondering what's ahead. The tragedies ofterrorism and the ongoing realities of war and violence can, at times, lull us into feelings of hopelessness. Yet, in the face of the suffering, hope is among the most important gifts that each of us has to bring. 
The motto of the Congregation of Holy Cross is ave crux spes unica, "hail the cross, our only hope." It emhodies the Christian paradox, that the cross is for us the sign of transformation, a symbol of our deliverance from darkness to light, from suffering to Joy, from death to life. 
In these days, more than ever, our faith must continue to lead us through that cross to that hope. We must pray and work for a just and lasting peace, both for ourselves and our distant neighbors. Each of us is called to play a part in the transformation that would bring this justice and this peace. 
I invite you to consider ways that you might begin right here and · right now to be a part of the world's transformation. I invite you to push the boundaries of your classroom to the neighborhoods of South Bend and beyond and to enter the Iives of those who live and study and work there. 
Through the years, thousands have taken part in the many opportu­nities offered through the Center for Social Concerns and our many partners. Each has make an important difference. Very often their service and learning has transformed them and allowed them to be ever more impressive agents of transformation as they have con­tinued to reach out long after their time at Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross College. 
Jesus called love the greatest of all commandments-to love the Lord God with all our hearts and to love our neighbor as ourselves (Mark 12: 28-31 ). It is not easy in these times-indeed, sometimes it seems impossible-but remains no less our challenge and our call. It is the foundation upon which we will build the justice we seek and the peace we long for. 
Be a part of the transformation we are called to, and be transformed. Give yourself away. One or more of the opportunities on these pages will quite possibly change you forever. 
Hospitality is an important part of the Center's work on campus. Center hospitality includes: a coffeehouse and kitchen, a large multi-purpose room, seminar rooms, and a, reflection room. These facilities are available for use by approved student and community groups. Contact the Center at 631-5293 to reserve rooms for lectures, films, liturgues, meals, other gatherings, and to inquire about the new policies surrounding vehicle use. 
M-Th 8:00 a.m. -1_0:00 p.m. Fri 8:00 a.m. -7:00 p.m., Sat. noon -2:00 p.m.* Sun. 6:00 p.m. -9:00 p.m. *On home football weekends, the Center opens 2 1/2 hours before game time and closes 1/2 hour before game time.

Dames homegrown, ky Boot Beasts 

when pressed, admit that they hope to emulate the sound of their  idols Tenacious D lead by actor/comedian/musician/psychopath Jack Black. After all, as Lodewyck points out, they're both fat guys on acoustic guitars singing filthy songs. 
"In all fairness, we suck. But we're funny and that's what we're going for," Lodewyck said. 
The Boot Beasts don't claim to be the best band around (or even competent to have driver's licenses) but they do hope that the future of campus music will be much brighter than it is now. Lodewyck is encouraged by the number of musically inclined freshmen he has met this year and encourages them to follow in his footsteps ofnot sleeping on Tuesday nights and concocting interesting monikers. 
Band names is, in fact, one of Lodewyck's fetishes. Since he began playing guitar seven and a half ye3crs ago. Lodewyck has been in bands named Horatio's Orgasm, Six Inches Between Us, The Vancouver Porn Enseble, and The Salvation Airforce, to name a few. 
"For a band like the Boot Beast, the name matters· as much as the music, but it will never be as important as our good looks," Lodewyck said. 
Though Lodewyck and Andrukaitis pride them­selves on their lack of prac­tice, both are, in fact, tal­ented musicians. It's their taste that may have some of their audience raising eye­brows. 
For example, at their gig on last Friday night (to which they "lost" their set list for), The Kinky Boot Beasts included a cover of Johnny Cash's "Folsom Prision Blues," a three sec­ond long piece called "A List of Things I Wouldn't Do Tq Have Sex With Anna Kournikova," and a medley of pop songs played to the same four chords. 
"Our style is atotal bas­tardization of all popular music," Andrukaitis said. 
With Andrukaitis' imped­ing departure at graduation Lodewyck plans to move onto more serious endeav­ors such as a venture play-. ing trombone in a third-· wave ska band tentatively named Shuger in the Haw with former Skammnnists guitarist Pete Balogh. Though Andrukaitis said 

that he would dcfrnatly return for some reunjon shows. 
But the Boot Beasts, serious or not, do it for the fans. When asked if the pair got had lot of groupies, Lodewyck replied, "Sadly."

Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO 

Yes, the San Dh~go Chargers am for real Any doubts were lflft in thP vapor trails of LaDainian Tomlinson and his teammates as they raced past the Nflw England Patriots. 
Tomlinson tied tho team rush­ing record with 21 7 yards and scqred on runs of .58 and 37 yards as the Chargers defeated the defending Super Bowl cham­pions 21-14 Sunday in a battle of unbeaten teams. 
Playing in what Junior Seau called their biggest game in three yflars, the Chargers improved to 4-0 for the first time their Super Bowl season of J994. 
"We shook up the world, baby," said Tomlinson, who had thc most yards rushing in the NFL this season. 

That was about as exuberant as the Chargers got, although a rare full house at Qualcomm Stadium went wild. The Chargers felt validated by the victory, but there's still three-quarters of the season left. 
"It doesn't mean anything unless we make the postseason," said Seau, who hasn't been to the playoffs since 1995. "We're growing, and we hope to buikl onit." 
The Patriots. (3-1) lost for the first time in 13 games, including last year's Super Bowl nm. It

But it was Tomlinson's running that carried the Chargers. Thc go-ahead score came on his 58-yard run -the longest of his career -on the second play of the third quarter. Ile was helped along by an unbelievable block from pint­size receiver Tim Dwight. 
Tomlinson cut outside, side­stepped one tackler about mid­field and headed down the right sideline. The 5-foot-9, 180­pound Dwight, a former Big Ten 100-meter champion at Iowa, showed incredible closing speed when he came from behind the play. He outran even Tomlinson and drove cornerback· Otis Smith about 12 yards before sending him to the ground. That allowed Tomlinson to score the only touchdown of the second half. 
"I saw Tim coming up and I said, 'Am I running that slow?"' Tomlinson said. 
"It was just a block," Dwight said. "Curtis Conway did a great job of getting the first part, and I just finished it." 
Tomlinson's 37-yard touch­down run tied the game at 14 late in the second quarter. He started off right tackle, then cut back inside and found a hole opened by rookie center Jason Ball. Tomlinson outran defen­sive backs Smith and Victor Green to the end zone.

Cowboys 13, Rams 10 
A bad season just keeps getting worse for the St. Louis Rams. 
The defending NFC champions lost quarterback Kurt Warner before losing their fourth straight g a m e 
the first 

time since 1963, when they started with five straight losses and finished 5-9. 
"That's life," coach Mike Martz said. "You can't sit and stew about it. That's where we are, ­and what's important is what we do about it." 
Rookie Billy Cundiff kicked a 48-yai:d field goal as time expired to win it for the Cowboys (2-2). 
The Rams, who went 14-2 last year, fell to must somehow improve quickly just to get back to .500, and they'll have to do it without Warner, who has a bro­ken little linger on his throwing hand. The team said the injury will be evaluated Monday to determine whether he'11 require surgery. 
"Usually those things take about a month," Martz said. "But it could be sooner. Who knows?" 
Warner broke the same finger in 2000 and it required surgery, knocking him out for five games. If he's out that long again, there might be no rush. The only 0-4 team to make the playoffs was the 1992 San Diego Chargers. 
'Tm not believing that one bit," Warner said. "We've got too good of a team to believe that. I believe I'm going to be back just in time to take us down that stretch run into the playoffs, and on to where we want to go." 
The Rams don't have any relief in sight. They play at San Francisco next, then host Oakland. 
Dallas quarterback Quincy Carter, who didn't earn a vote of confidence from owner Jerry Jones after a shaky first three games, led the Cowboys 41 yards on nine plays in 1:27 to set up the field goal. 
"I knew we didn't need a touchdown to win it; we just needed to keep moving the ball down the field," Carter said. "Everybody really had to pay attention. I did my part, but also my line did their part, my receivers, my backs. I just thought, as a collective group, that wo did a groat job handling tho 2-minute drive."

Associated Press 

SUTTON COLDFIELD, England The underdogs were the best from top to bottom. 
Ripping a page out of the American playbook, Europe won early and won big with its best players. And that inspired the rest of a no-name cast to snatch the Ryder Cup away from Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and a heavily favored U.S. squad. 
"It was a huge risk," Colin Montgomerie said. "And it worked very, very well." 
Europe beat the Americans at their own game Sunday, winning the sin­gles matches for only the sixth time in history to capture the· most precious golf prize on the continent. 
"Hopefully, that will say to the Americans we can play singles, and we can compete with them and also

Nebraska unranked for first time since 1981 
For the first time in 21 years, Nebraska is not ranked in The Associated Press college football poll.

Nebraska moved into the AP rank­ings Oct. 5, 1981, and remained among college foutball's top teams week after week after week until a second straight loss knocked it out. 
During the streak, Nebraska won two AP national championships (in 1g94 and 1995) and was ranked No. l in 52 polls. The lluskers were 49­31-1 againsL ranked teams, with four of those losses coming in tlin tram's last seven gaim~s dating t\, last s1m­son.

The final score was 15VZ-12VZ, the largest margin by either side since Europe scored 161/2 points in 1985, the first time the Ryder Cup was played at The Belfry. Sam Torrance was the star that day, making the clinching putt. 
lie was equally important as the European captain. 
"He took a hell of a gamble by front­loading his team like he did," U.S. cap­tain Curtis Strange said. "Because if they don't do well, in my mind it's over." 
No one was more magnificent than Monty. 
He led the charge by beating Scott lloch in the opening match and whipped the partisan crowd into a frenzy early. Montgomerie was unbeaten at The Belfry, never trailing

No. 25 Colorado State had 206 points. 
Florida (4-1), ranked No. 6 this week after a 41-34 victory over Kentucky, now owns the longest con­secutive polls streak, at 208. 
To match the Huskers' run. the Gators would need to be ranked in every poll f'or the next eight years.

A timid Welshman who is ranked '.'Jo. 119 in the world, Price scored a surprisingly easy victory-over Mickelson that deflated any American hopes of a comeback. 
In the middle was Niclas Fasth, who survived a spectacular finish by Paul Azinger, and Paul McGinley, who clinched the Cup with an 8-foot par putt. 
"Out of the shadows come heroes," Torrance said. "And that's where Paul McGinley and Phillip Price came." 
Not many have heard of these guys before, but the Americans sure won't forget them.

"I'm as confident with Hoger as I am with somebody else. I really can't come up with a reason for it," Torre said. "Hoger is Roger. He's been a leader for us. There is a certain step up when you hit the postseason."

Irish boats claim top 3 spots frotn Kansas 
By CHRISTINE ARMSTRONG Sport, Writer 
After an impressive finish last weekend in the Milwaukee River Challenge, the Irish rowed into the top throe spots over Kansas in this weekend's races on ·the St. Joseph lliver. 
Cassie Markstahler (cox), Natalie Ladine, Ashlee Warren, Elizabeth Specht, Alice Bartek, Becky Luckett, Erica Drennen, Kerri Murphy and Kathleen Welsh led the Notre Dame A boat to a first-place finish in 13 minutes, 39.35 seconds. 
The varsity B crew of Kathryn Long (cox}, Kati Seduu, Ann Marie Oillhoff, Casey Buc_kstaff. Meghan Boyle, Diane Price, Meredith Thornburgh, Katie (h0nowith and Sarah KeAfer finished with a second-place time of 13:51.91. 
The Notre Dame C boat of Maureen Gibbons (cox), Kristin Mizzi, Shannon Mohan, Melissa Felker. Christy Donnelly, Danielle Stealy, Jenna Froberg, Sarah Palandech and Megan Sanders secured third place with a time of 14:04.08, just 17 seconds ahead of the Kansas A boat. 
The Kansas B boat took fifth place with a 14:33.07 finish and the Notre Dame D boat of Caitlin Rackish (cox), Katie O'Hara, Alicia Garcia, Katherine McCalden, Kristin Henkel, Antoinette Duck, Fallon Shields, Rachel Polinski and Devon Hegeman finished with a sixth­place time of 14:48.78.

Andrea Werner finished second at 231 (79-77-75). 
"This win bodes well for the future," said Gebauer, describ­ing the impact of winning their home invitational. "The team's really excited. I think the high expectations made us really con­centrate and focus on this week. We weren't going to look past this." 
King also noted how the play of the younger members of the team will build for the future.

any one team that is dominat­ing," said Belles sophomore Jen Concannon, who also had a pair of goals in the match. "Hight now any team can take it. and we definitely feel we have a chance." 
Midfielder Emily Wagoner and defender Jen Herdman also added goals to the Belles' tally. 
The Belles continue to show that they are a team on the rise. Only nine games into the season, they are two-thirds of the way to their six-win total from last year. 
"Last year was sort of a start­ing over for our program," the sophomore Concannon said. "It Andrea Amoni. Tori Blainey, Corrine Roman; Jennifer Connelly, Kristen Wright and Beth Franzosa pulled in a time of 15:14.52 
The team attributes some of its success this weekend to the home fans' enthusiasm and sup­port. 
"lt was a lot of fun for us to race on our home course and to actually have a crowd there to cheer us on," Ladine said. 
The team, which had been practicing in smaller boats, usu­ally pairs, used this race against Kansas to strengthen il'i unity. 
"J think we continue to get better with each race," first var­sity eight ro\-ver Drennen said. '"Our goal is to raise the level of intensity each week this fall, and we definitely brought it up a notch for this race. Also, to have three eights beat Kansas's first boat is a testament to the depth on our team this year." 
The rowers are satisfied with their performances so far, but will continue to push themselves more with each upcoming race, especially when the team races in Pittsburgh next weekend. 
"The competition this week­end was not nearly as tough as what we will be up against next weekend in Pittsburgh," Ladine said. "This weekend gave us the additional racing experience and heightened level of intensity which will help us tremendously at the Head of the Ohio next weekend." 
The team will compete in the Head of the Ohio Saturday in Pittsburgh.

MENS SOCCER 
Fit to be tied: Irish equal No. 19 Rutgers 
By JOE HETTLER Associate Sports Editor 
It was another good perfor­mance for the No. 10 Notre Dame mens soccer team and another game without a victory. 
For the second straight game the Irish battled a ranked Big East opponent and still could not pull out a win, tying No. 19 Rutgers 1-1 in double overtime. Notre Dame lost to second­ranked St. John's 1-0 Thursday night. 
"It's disappointing we didn't actually finish the job, but that'll come," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. 'There's an old saying that you'_ve got to be the bridesmaid before you can be the bride. So I think we've been the bridesmaid more than we should." 
Midfielder Justin Detter scored his fourth goal of the season, while Chad Riley tallied his team­leading seventh assist oft.he year . 
The Scarlet Knights took the lead in the 68th minute with a goal by Sam Castellano. But the Irish were able to match Rutgors' mark with Dettcr's game-tying goal in the 79th minute. 
Notre Dame out shot Rutgers 21-13, forcing Scarlet Knight goalie Ricky Zinter to save 10 shots. Meanwhile, Irish goalie Chris Sawyer successfully defended four Rutgers shots. 
While the Irish held the overall advantage in shots, Rutgers had an important 9-5 edge in corner kicks. 
"We actually played very, very well," Clark said. "It was an excellent performance. It was a tough weekend for us because I thought we played very well in the St. John's game and the Rutgers game and we only came out with one tie." 
The Irish are now 4-2-3 on the season and 2-1-1 in Big East play. 
Notre Dame headed into the contest having lost its last five games against Rutgers, and the Irish were 1-6 at the Scarlet Knights' home field. In its last six meetings with Rutgers, Notre Dame had been outscored 11-2. 
"I think this is all tremendous experience for this team and I think you know it's going to come out right in the end," Clark said. 
Notre Dame will face Big East foe Pittsburgh Oct. 4 at home before heading to Akron, Ohio to face the Zips. · 
Clark knows his team must be sharp against Pittsburgh if they hope to win their third confer­ence game of the year. Pittsburgh, like Notre Dame. lost to St. John's 1-0. 
"[Pittsburgh) is a very tough team," Clark said. "They're a big, strong team and it'll be another test. It's going to be one of these tough games, and if we take them lightly for one second, it'll be a very, very long evening for us. We've got to be absolutely fired to get back into the race for the [Big East conference title]."
