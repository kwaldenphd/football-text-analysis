The color orange will spnckl11 Notre Damn's campus once again today as students and faculty show their support for alternative Jifnstyles by wnaring "Gay? Finn By Mn" shirts pro­vided by mnrnb11rs of AlliancnND. 
The student group, which has not been formally recognized by the UnivPrsity, focuses on issues of sexuality and tolnr­ance. Members said they dis­tributed about 250 new T-shirts in preparation for today's event, which is eo-sponsored by the sociology department. An nstimated 2,500 shirts havn benn distributnd to nwmbnrs of the Notre Dame community since tho inception of the cam­paign in spring 2004. 
Graduate student and group eo-coordinator Anna Gomberg said she believes demand for the shirts has not want~d. 
"A lot of faculty and staff wanted the shirt this time around," she said. 
AlliancnND said in a press release that "wearing tho shirt indicates support and accept­ance of Notre Damn's gay, les­bian, bisnxual, transgender, queer and qunstioning ((;LBTQ) community and its allies."

INSIDE COLUMN 

Whirlwind weekend 
I was supposed to get my driver's license this weekend. · 
Then again, I was supposed to keep my necessary certificates safe so the beautiful bureaucracy that is the New York State Department of Ken Fowler Motor Vehicles would let me take the road test. Sports Writer 
At 3:20a.m. Friday, after 13 hours of travel that included a three­hour flight delay and diversion from the friendly confines of LaGuardia Airport in Queens to New Jersey's Newark International, I couldn't find the certificate showing that I took the appropriate 5-hour beginner drivers' class. 
After a few hours of sleep and a couple more of searching, I resigned myself to the fact that it was nowhere to be found. The driving school that had my records was closed, and my road test was within hours. I went to the test site anyway, knowing I would be denied. 
I was right in my assumption. 
When I got home, I figured I had to make the most of the two days home. I mean, the plane tickets cost $161. The bus was another $57. Meals at Midway and LaGuardia, about $20. Overall, my two-day, three-night voy­age home cost me nearly $240. Plus, the travel had been hellacious, and I had failed my weekend's main goal. 
I was not going to allow the days to go to waste, so first things first. 
I threw on a bathing suit, grabbed my fins, and walked about a quarter­mile to the south-facing ocean beach of my hometown. It was the first time in a little more than a month I had been there, and I was dying to catch a few waves. 
Lucky for me, the sunny day's air was about 75 degrees and the water about 65. And despite an onshore wind, the waves were breaking clean­ly and three to four feet -perfect for bodysu_rfing. 
Glory! 
I swam out to the surfers dropping in off the jetties and started catching waves of my own. I realized once again the thrill of lying prone on a wall of water as you fall over the face of a wave. 
A few times, I was a little reckless and took a few tumbles, but I'll take a few bruises and scrapes for the joy of bodysurfing any day -even a day that was a failure just hours before. 
After I exhausted my playful energy from constantly swimming out to the line of breakers, I caught one last wave a:nd called it a day. I put my fins in one hand, shoes in another and shirt over my shoulder. 
It was the beginning fall, and I felt like I was just starting summer. I was walking barefoot in on the street, salt water infiltrating my ears and eyes and sand up and down my now-not­so-tan legs. My smile was ear-to-ear as I walked home. 
Just 45 hours later, I wrote this col­umn in Midway amidst a cold September rain, thinking to myself, 'How soon can I schedule my next few road tests?'

Born in Panama, raised first in England and then Brooklyn at ago five, Chambers had alrnady expnrinneed several dif'f'nrent cultures and lan­guagns before she cnternd Simon College at age 16. At this point, shn said she bnliovnd she could identi(y her­snlf as a young black Brooklyn girl. Chambnrs soon gained internships and began to write for s1weral nationally published magazines such as Seventeen and YM, and il was at this time she realized hnr self'-idnntifiea­tion began to change. 
"You arn not totally defined as you thi11k you are when you grow up." shn said. 
Through intern­ships and additional jobs, Chambnrs was abln to travel to Los Angnles. London and Japan. She said it was her experience in Japan in 2003 that drastically changed her porson­al view of' horse!!'. 
"In Japan Ill was known as an American, not Black, not African­American, and I 
liknd it," Chambers said. 
Arter sharing personal sto­rios, Chambors aimed her talk directly at the students in attendance. 
"If you have an interest reaching across lthel cultural lino, I you I have opportunity to 
build friendships here," she said. 
Chambers also told how her exporiences with other Americans of different back­grounds, hor work and her travel have influenced her writings and presentations. She reminded the listeners that even though we are all 

Americans, it is benn/1cial to at least familiar with other eth­nicities. 
"If there is a time to reach past lthe] awkwardness, this is the time," she said. "College is [thel place where topics come up and [the] safest place to dis­cuss topics -the eorporate scene doesn't care." 
Chambors concluded by encouraging studnnts to broad­on their exporienens with diversity through writing. 
"I am happy to help and give advice for those of you intnr­ested to be writers," shn said.

Why should I change to a Strong Password? 
(1) 
Weak passwords put sensitive and personal information at risk that can be used by identity thieves (you don't want strangers guessing your password and pretending to be you) ; 

(2) 
If you do not change to a Strong Password, your existing password will expire, disrupting your access to Notre Dame networked applications, including email and shared storage. 


Will all existing passwords expire at the same time? 
No. Passwords that have not been changed (to 
Strong Passwords) since July 5, 2005 will be 
randomly tagged for expiration sometime between 
now and the spring of 2006. 
How will I know that my password is set to expire? 
You will receive an email from the OIT, and you will 
have 30 days from the day of receipt to change to a 
Strong Password. Once you change your password 
to a Strong Password, you won't have to change it 
again for another 180 days. 
When it comes to Strong Passwords, will the 
University make exceptions for some campus 
computer users? 

No exceptions will be granted.

site, e-mail lists and word of mouth to advertise events like the T­shirt days. 
The shirts usually get a mixed reaction from the student body. Sophomore Josh Kempf and junior Meredith Wholley said they will not be wearing the shirt today. 
"I think the Catholic nature of ND doesn't support that, and I don't see it as a lifestyle I agree with," Kempf said. 
"I think the shirts have an ambiguous message," Wholley said. "There is a difference between loving someone for who they are and accepting actions that are sinful." 
Renfro said he will be wear­ing the shirt to show his support for the GLBTQ community. 
"Diversity is a h·uge issue at Notre Dame, and we are simply representing the level that deals with sexuality," he said. "You have to start with awareness to bring tolerance." 
Junior Laura Vilim said she will also be wearing the shirt. 
"I wish it had a stronger sen­timent-it's not just fine by me, it's completely acceptable by me," she said. 
Senior Peter Quaranta, a staunch shirt supporter, said he believes it helps send a positive message.

Suffering from poor health, Byrnes returned to Saint Mary's in May 2001 to undergo an operation. It was while strug­gling to recover she met athlet­ic director Lynn Kachmarik and began building a relationship with the College's athletic department. 
"A few years ago we needed to find a way for the fall sport athletes to eat over fall break and the dining hall was closed," Kachmarik said. 
Sister Louisita Welsh, assis­tant to vice president for mis­sion and the volleyball team chaplain, suggested the student athletes dine with Sisters of the Holy Cross at the convent. 
"It was a win-win situation for everybody," Kachmarik said. "[The athletes] mixed and 
mingled  with some  of the  
Sisters."  
From  that  point  on,  

Karchmarik said, Byrnes "just stuck." 
"I started doing what I call nun runs," Kachmarik said. "I would take my golf cart over to the convent and I would pick up whatever nuns wanted to come to the basketball game or the volleyball game." 
Attending games regularly, Byrnes grew especially close to members of the soccer squad and became team chaplain. 
"[The Sisters] want to be out serving, but health issues bring them back here," Kachmarik said. "So it is kind of like a life­line for Sister Viola -it keeps her young." 
Byrnes also credits her involvement with the athletics teams for energizing her physi­cally, mentally and spiritually. 
"lit's] been a lifesaver,'' Sister Viola said. "I would have gone nuts if I didn't have anything to do." 
In good times and in bad 
Despite serious health prob­lems -including two knee replacements, two knee hip replacements and severe arthritis -Byrnes is always on the sidelines cheering on the Belles. 
In May, Byrnes had successful open-heart surgery only to be diagnosed with breast cancer four weeks later. She spent the summer undergoing 30 radia­tion treatments. All of her focus, she said, was in recover­ing in time to attend the first home game this season. 
"I will never forget bringing her over on the golf cart Ito the first game] and she had her hands above her head saying 'I'm here, I'm here."' Kachmarik said. ''I've never seen our team play so much as a team as that first win against Albion." 
Byrnes has also become leg­endary among athletes and coaches for braving terrible weather in order to watch teams compete. 
"Last year it was this really cold, windy day," said senior Maura Schoen, one of three soccer team captains. "It was so windy we thought she was going to blow over and she was still out there. We had some of for the athletes. when they compete away. She and affirmed her belief that the

"I was in such awe of their lives and their commitment to Cod and their work," Kachmarik said. "I started looking into it and then they became my sponsors."

Overdue credit card bills at record high 
American Bankers Association reports surging debt could rise in months ahead 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON -Charge it! That familiar refrain is producing an unwanted response for more Amnricans: Your bill is overdue! 
Surging energy priees, low personal savings and the higher cost of borrow­ing have combined to pro­duro a record level of over­dull credit card bills.

Small businesses seek aid of backup services 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -Business has picked up at data recovery services, insurance brokers and loss preven­tion consultancies across the nation over the past few weeks, as images of flooded and destroyed Gulf Coast companies made many small busi­ness owners uneasy about their own disaster preparedness. 
At LiveVault, a data backup and recovery company in Marlborough, Mass., orders doubled around the time that Hurricane Katrina hit, in late August, said CEO Bob Cramer. 
"A lot of people found us on the Web and called us frantically. They rapidly put orders through and begged us to get them up and run­ning," Cramer said. 
Many small business owners began thinking about contracting with a remote data backup service to protect their computer data after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, Cramer said. But many never signed up with a provider until they were unnerved by Katrina's devas­tation. 

But Cramer also said business has leveled off somewhat since the early blip, a sign that many company owners, perhaps distracted by day­to-day demands, are again putting off disaster prep. 
"They forget about disasters the week after they happen," he said. 
VeriCenter Inc., a Houston-based information technology firm with seven data backup centers around the country, also saw an uptick in business, said co-founder Dave Colsante. He's found that many cus­tomers have been motivated to start tapping into money that was set aside for disaster preparation but that went unused until now. 
Colsante said many of those com­panies were what he called toe-dip­pers -"they were interested in looking but hadn't actually pur­chased." 
"Katrina caused a lot of people to actually engage and force their IT staff to make the leap into tho dis­aster recovery world," he said. 
Insurance brokers have also been getting more phorH1 calls and e­mails. 
George Yates, president of Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of New York, in East Hampton, said his firm has bnen getting calls from businesses won­dering whether their insurance includes f'lood coverage. For many owners, the answer is no -11ood insurance has to be purchased sep­arately from a standard busirwss policy-and so Yatns' eompany has been selling morn coverage for 11oods. 
Yates said his company has been working on its own disaster plan­ning. Located right next to tlw Atlantic Ocean, East Hampton is vulnerable to hurricanes.

dents in professor Alan Dowty's class on the Arab­Israel conflict. 
Their counterparts were from Al-quds University in Jerusalem, students who spoke excellent English and ­dressed in jeans, T-shirts and sweaters -looked similar to themselves, notwithstanding several headscarves. 
A general curiosity on each side begged the question: "What do you think of us?" 
"[The State Department] is trying to find some way to get human contact into the con­text," Dowty said. "They can't just go into one of these uni­versities in the Arab world; it's just too controversial. The 
U.S. position is not strong enough. 
"They want this to be very informal, student to student, just to break down stereo­types and create some good will." 
The conference was organ­ized by Mark Rincon, a 
both sides. 
The Palestinian students insisted that they not be seen as terrorists -a label one student called offensive -but instead as victims of war. 
"I watch CNN all the time, and the media doesn't cover everything," one female Palestinian student said. "Daily, Palestinians are dying. The other day 19 [Palestinians] were killed, just like that. You'd be lucky to see it on bottom of the screen." 
A Notre Dame student asked if the students felt optimistic that the situation would improve. 
"Oh, that's far, far away from us," one Palestinian stu­dent said. 
Another added, "We are imprisoned, but we are hang­ing in here -and we do smile a lot." 
The Palestinian students were interested to know that three of the Notre Dame stu­dents had been to the Middle East and a few study Arabic. 
"How do you feel about us when you see us and hear us now?" one female Palestinian student asked. "Because we have

studying, foot­ball season, clubs, interhall sports, the­ater, service, bars and trips to Chicago. 
The Palestinian students presented a much different reality, one of constant identi­fication checks "even when you go to the bathroom," a wall built to divide a people "both inside and outside" and a political situation that left uncertain tomorrows. 
One Palestinian student said she should be able to get to class in 10 minutes, but with checkpoints it takes an hour. Others said that some days they are not able to get to class at all. 
"We don't have much to do after college [classes]," one female Palestinian said. "We go home and do homework, we sleep. There's actually no place to hang out, we just sleep. 
"We're good sleepers," she added, prompting laughter on on a people often 
misunderstood. 
"What struck me was that everything we talked about was linked to the political cli­mate," junior Josh Hugo said after the conference. "It's a stark contrast to our own edu­cation. We could do whatever we want, and they're happy if they can get to school on time for a test. We're happy if a test gets cancelled." 
Stud-ents from both sides said they believe the dialogue was an important yet small step in the direction of improved relations. 
"I wonder how much that really helped," said junior Meghan O'Connell. "We can go on and on about the things that we do ... I hope that does not reinforce the negative ideas. I hope they know we don't take anything for grant­ed -especially now."

"The first year we worked

Not wanting to have both a search for a new president and new dean being conduct­ed at the same time, the College dropped the interim from White's title.

Marrow transplants improving 
Development of safer procedures will helpfight cancer, doctors say 
Associated Press 
STi\NFOIW UNIVEHSITY ­Doctors seem to have found a way to make bone marrow transplants safer and more nfTn!'tive against blood canc~ers likn lnukmnia, an achilwemnnt that offers new hope for people over 50 in particular. 
The advance by Stanford University doctors could make such transplants, which have dramatically improved cancer survival among children and young adults, more widely available to older people who typi!' ally don't fare as well. 
It also brings the field eloser to its Holy Grail -training a reeipinnt's body to accept tis­sun from another person and live a "blended" life without heavy reliance on anti-rejec­tion drugs. 
Scientists already had achinved this in mice; Stanford researchers now have extend­ed it to people. Their study is published in Thursday's New 1\ngland .Journal of Medicine and was funded by the National Institutes of llealth. 
Specialists said tlw study was small and preliminary, but vnry promising. 
"II' it works. we would be able to do transplants in a lot morn people," said Dr. Mary llorowitz. seientific director of the C1111ter for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Hes1~ard1, based at the Mndical Collnge of Wisconsin, which had no role in the research. 
Ideally, a leukemia or lym­phoma patient would be given radiation or high doses of chemotherapy to destroy the cancerous bone marrow before receiving healthy marrow or blood stem cells from a donor. I lowever, many patients, espe­cially those over 50, die of infections they are unable to fight ofT before the new mar­row takes hold and grows. 
To avoid this problem, doc­tors usually destroy only part of the patient's original mar­row. That brings other dilem­mas: some cancerous blood cells remain, and the new marrow frequently attacks the old -an often-fatal problem called graft-versus-host dis­ease. 
Stanford researchers devel­oped a way to condition the recipient to accept the new marrow and to inactivate the parts of the patient's immune system that would attack it. They used a combination of low-dose radiation over two weeks and short courses of immune-suppressing drugs. 
Only 2 of the 37 patients given the experimental treat­ment developed severe graft­versus-host disease. Ordinarily, more than half of them would have. 
An average of one year later, 27 of the 37 were still alive, and cancer was in complete remission in 24 or them -bet­ter results than usual. The average age of the patients was 52. 
"It can achieve the cure of the tumor without the high likelihood that you will come down with the dreaded side effect," said the lead researcher, Dr. Samuel Strober. 
The results need to be repeated in larger studies, but are "impressive" and "open a new era in the field," Dr. Gerard Socie, a transplant expert from several universi­ties in Paris, wrote in an accompanying editorial. 
Patients also need to be fol­lowed for longer than a year to see if they remain cancer-free, Horowitz said. 
Bone marrow and blood cell transplants are one reason the death rate from childhood can­cers has dropped roughly 50 percent since the 1970s. Leukemia is the most common cancer that children face, but it is diagnosed 10 times more often iri older adults -the very group for whom trans­plants have been most danger­ous. 
With the new treatment, "the side effects are being markedly reduced, which is good news for elderly patients with leukemia and lymphoma," Strober said. 
The approach also might help people receiving organ transplants if they are "condi­tioned" with marrow or blood cells from the donor before receiving a kidney or other organ, Strobnr said. 



Areas of New Orleans 
reopen for residentS 
Associated Press 
BATON ROUGE, La. -More areas of New Orleans that escaped flooding from Hurricanes Katrina and Hita will be formally reopened start­ing Thursday, Mayor Hay Nagin said. 
The areas include the French Quarter, the Central Business district, and Uptown with its historic Garden District. Business owners will be allowed in on Thursday, and residents on Friday. 
"The re-entry started Monday and is going very well ­exceedingly well," Nagin told legislators at a hearing Wednesday at the state capitol. "Everything you hoped to hap­pen is happening. Algiers is alive and well and breathing." 
On Monday, Nagin opened the Algiers neighborhood, which has electricity and dean water. 
Nagin said checkpoints where officers stop people will be pulled back Thursday so that only areas that were f'looded will be ofT limits. llomes in those areas were heavily flooded and most are likely beyond repair. 
If all goes well, as of Oct. 5 only the Lower Ninth Ward, whieh was hit especially hard by the flooding, will be cor­doned off, Nagin said. 
Electricity has been restored to some dry parts of the eity, but the water is not yet drinkable. The mayor disagreed with the head of the state's Health Department about the condition of the city's water, insisting resi­dents could now wash in it, though they shouldn't drink it. 
"The two things that are absolutely necessary to ensure public health -dean drinking water and proper sewagn sys­tnms-simply are not available in the east bank area of New Orleans at this time," said Dr. Fred Cerise, secretary for the state Department of llealth and Hospitals. 
"People who re-enter the city may be exposed to diseases such as E. coli, salmonnlla or diarrhea illness if they do not allow time for the necessary inspections to ensure public health and safety," Cerise said. 
Many residents of the city have returned ahead of Nagin's offieial timeline, and the mayor appeared eager Wednesday to get more of' them back. 
Nagin complained that statn opposition was feeding a mis­perception about Nnw Orleans, saying: "We're f'ighting this national impression that we're tainted, we're not rnady." 
Yet a handout from the mayor's of'f'ico to returning motorists struck a more cau­tious tone than Nagin himself'. 
"You are entering thn city of' New Orleans at your own risk," it reads, bnfore going on to detail potential health hazards from water, soil and air. and advising rnsidnnts to bring in food.

Roberts on the verge of becoming the next chief justice 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON -A divided Democratic caucus on Wednesday assured Supreme Court nominee John G. Roberts Jr. of a comfortable. bipartisan 
Senate con­firmation as the nation's 17th chief justice, the youngest in 200 years. 
Many say they would have chosen 

someone else Roberts 
for the posi­
tion, yet 21 Senate Democrats 
agreed he has "a brilliant legal 
mind" and will be among the 
76 senators -more than 
three-fourths of the 100-mem­
ber Senate -who say they 
plan to vote to confirm the 50­
year-old Hoberts as the succes­
sor to the late William H. 
Rehnquist. 
Democrats are uniting, how­ever, in sending the White House a warning not to nomi­nate a conservative ideologue to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Conno~ President Bush is expected to nominate O'Connor's replace­ment soon after Hoberts is sworn in as chief justice. 
"While this nomination did not warrant an attempt to block the nominee on the floor of the Senate, the next one might," said Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, chair­man of the Democratic 
 Senatorial Campaign Committee, and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He was out front on filibusters of Bush's lower court judicial nominees and is one of the 21 Democrats who have announced their opposition to Hoberts. 
Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas is one of the 21 Democrats who have announced support for Roberts, yet he too cautioned the White House on the upcom­ing pick, saying, "If Bush nomi­nates another conservative activist judge, there will be problems in the Senate." 
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter, R-Pa., condemned talk of blocking Bush's next Supreme Court pick, but also urged the White House to nominate "in the mold of Judge Roberts," who has gone through the Senate rela­tively unscathed from the day Bush tapped him as the nation's 109th Supreme Court justice. 
"If the president can find someone in Judge Hoberts' mold, I think by putting up that nominee, he disarmed his opponents," Specter said. 
Roberts is expected to have a long tenure as chief justice. 
Not since John Marshall, con­firmed in 1801 at 45, has there been a younger chief. Oliver Ellsworth was 50 -about six weeks from turning 51; And John Jay, the first chief justice, was 44. lie served from 1789­1795. 
Roberts, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, grew up in Long Beach, Ind., working summers in the same steel mill where his father was an elec­trical engineer and serving as high school class president and captain of the football team. 
After graduating with honors from Harvard -both in under­graduate and law school -he clerked for William H. Hehnquist when he was an associate justice on the Supreme Court and later worked as a prominent lawyer and judge in Washington. He argued 39 cases in front of the Supreme Court, and was con­sidered one of the nation's best appellate lawyers before being tapped for the federal appeals court. 


Hoberts has drawn fire for his conservative views on women's issues and civil rights but also disarmed many Democratic senators with a smooth performance before the Judiciary Committee. He spoke without notes for four days and jousted with senators who unsuccessfully tried to pin down how he'd rule once he's confirmed as chiefjustice. 
"No one disputes that Judge Hoberts has a brilliant legal mind," said Sen. Hon Wyden, D-Ore., adding that he believes Hoberts is not as conservative as Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia. 
If Democrats voted against Hoberts as a bloc, it would give Republicans a reason to block the next Democratic president's nominee if they are still in charge of the Senate, Wyden said. "A sword forged in ideolo­gy in 2005 can be used against a progressive nominee in 2009 with an equal disregard for the Constitution and the individ­ual," he said. 
Senators are expecting a more partisan fight over Bush's replacement for O'Connor. She often has been a swing vote, a majority maker whose replace­ment could signal a shift on the court on many contentious issues including abortion and affirmative action. 
Roberts makes it harder for the White House, given how well his nomination was accepted by the Senate, said Sen. John Cornyn, H-Texas and a member of the Judiciary Committee. "If the president picks a nominee close to the quality of John Hoberts, then I don't think there will be a fight," he said. 
Democrats say if Bush sends up any of the nominees they fil­ibustered earlier this year ­like federal appellate judges Priscilla Owen, Janice Rogers Brown, William Pryor or Hispanic lawyer Miguel Estrada -they will fight to the bitter end. 
Debated ground zero ?1-useum idea dropped 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -Bowing to pres­sure from furious Sept. 11 fami­lies, Gov. George Pataki on Wednesday removed a proposed freedom museum from the space reserved for it at ground zero, saying the project had aroused "too much opposition, too much controversy." 
He left open the possibility that a new spot at the former World Trade Center site could be found for the museum. 
The decision followed months of acrimony over the International Freedom Center, with Sept. 11 families and politi­cians saying that the museum would overshadow and take space from a separate memorial devoted to the 2,749 World Trade Center dead and would dishonor them by fostering debate about the attacks and other world events. 
"We must move forward with our first priority, the creation of an inspiring memorial to pay tribute to our lost loved ones and tell their stories to the world," Pataki said in a state­ment. 
Pataki said that the Freedom Center cannot be part of a cul­tural building located near the proposed trade center memori­al. But he left open the possibili­ty that the center could find a home elsewhere on the 16-acre site. 
Pataki said he would direct the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. -the agency he created to rebuild the site -to explore other locations for the center. 
A campaign by some Sept. 11 families to oust the museum from space reserved for it at ground zero had grown in recent months to include four police and fire unions, an online petition with more than 40,000 signatures, and several politi­cians including former Mayor Hudolph Giuliani. 
"Goodbye and good riddance," said Hep. Vito Fossella, one of three congressmen who had threatened hearings on federal funding if the museum stayed where it was. "The IFC will not stand on the hallowed grounds of the World Trade Center site." 
In addition to the terrorist attacks, the Freedom Center planned exhibits on such topics as Abraham Lincoln, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the fall of the Berlin Wall, the civil rights movement, the Declaration of Independence and the South African constitution. 
The museum would also include a section on the world's response to Sept. 11 and a film that links the victims' back­grounds to periods in history. 
Some families have opposed the museum as much for its location as its content; they say it would sit in a prominent part of ground zero that would obscure the memorial museum.

Design for $100 laptop unveiled 
Inexpensive computers could benefit children in developing countries 
Associated Press 
CAMBHIDGE, Mass. -TIHl $100 laptop computers that Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers want to get into the hands of the world's children would be durable, flexible and self­rnliant. 
Tho machines' AC adapter would double as a carrying strap. and a hand crank would pownr them when there's no nleetridty. They'd bfl foldable likfl traditional notnbook PCs, and carried like slim lunch­boxes. 
For outdoor reading, their display would bn able t<~ shirt from full color to glare-resist­ant black and white. 
And surrounding it all, the laptops would have a rubber easing that elosos tightly, hneause "they have to be absolutely indestructible," said Nieholas Negropontn, the MIT Mndia Lab loader who ofTernd an updatr. on the project Wmlrwsday. 
Nngropontn hatched the $100 laptop idea after ser.ing ehildrnn in a Cambodian vil­lago hnnnfit from having note­hook cornputnrs at school that thny wuld also totn home to usn' on thnir own. 
Thosn computers had been donatnd by a foundation run by Nngropontn and his wife. lie dneidnd that for kids every­wlwrn to bnnnlit from thf1 edu­cational and communications powp,rs of the Internet, some­one would have to make lap­tops inexpensive enough for officials in developing coun­tries to purehasn en masse. At least that's Negroponte's plan. 
Within a year, Negroponte expects his nonprofit One Laptop Per Child to get 5 mil­lion to 15 million of the machines in production, when children in Brazil, China, Egypt, Thailand, South Africa are due to begin getting them. 
In the second year -when Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney hopes to start buying them for all 500,000 middle and high-school students in this state -Negroponte envi­sions 100 million to 150 mil­lion being made. (He boasts that these humble $100 note­books would surpass the world's existing annual pro­duction of laptops, which is about 50 million.) 
While a prototype isn't expoctnd to be shown ofT until November, Negroponte unveiled blueprints at Technology Heview magazine's Emnrging Technologies eonfer­enee at MIT. 
Among the key spees: A 500­rnegahertz processor (that was fast in the 1990s but slow by today's standards) by Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and flash mnmory instead of a hard drive with moving parts. To save on software costs, the laptops would run the freely available Linux operating sys­tem instead of Windows. 
The computers would be able to connect to Wi-Fi wire­less networks and be part of "mesh" networks in which eaeh laptop would relay data to and from other devices, reducing the need for expen­sive base stations. Plans call for the machines to have four USB ports for multimedia and data storage. 
Perhaps the defining differ­ence is the hand crank, though first-generation users would get no more than 10 minutes of juice from one minute of winding. 
This certainly wouldn't be the first effort to bridge the world's so-ealled digital divide with inexpensive versions of 
fancy  maehinery.  Other  
attempts have had a mixed  
record.  
With  those  in  mind,  

Negroponte says his team is addressing ways this project eould be undermined. 
For example, to keep the $100 laptops from bning wide­ly stolen or sold ofT in poor countries, he nxpects to make them so pervasive in schools and so distinctive in aesign that it would be "socially a stigma to be carrying one if you are not a student or a teacher." lie compared it to filching a mail truck or taking something from a church: Everyone would know where it came from.

To the media, World Youth Day was "a Catholic Woodstock." But to the new Pope it was a teaching moment. 
2005 had two World Youth Days. The frrst, in April, was spontaneous. The young predominated among the millions in Rome for the funeral of John Paul II. The event, including the homily by the future Pope, was seen, in person or on televi­sion, by more people than any other funeral ill history. Four days Charles Rice

tificate, Benedict XVI looked to the future: "[T]he Church is alive. And the Church is young. She ... shows ... the way towards the future." 
In August, Benedict went to the World Youth Day in Cologne to show young people "how beautiful it is to be Christian." The event exceeded expecta­tions, with more than a million at the closing Mass. The Pope made the most of it, confirming that relativism, among other issues, would be a major concern of his papacy. 
At the Mass before the conclave that elected him, then-Cardinal Ratzinger had said, "We are building a dictatorship of relativism that does not recognize any­thing as definitive and whose ultimate goal consists solely of one's own ego and desires." He described "relativism" as "letting oneself be 'tossed here and there, carried about by every wind of doctrine."' In Cologne, Benedict devel­oped the point. "[F]reedom," he said, "is not simply about enjoying life in total autonomy, but ... about living by the measure of truth and goodness, so that we ... can become true and good." He explained that objective, non-relative "measure" in the context of the Greek and Latin origins of the word, "adora­tion." Adoration of Christ in the Eucharist leads to "submission, th_e recognition of God as our true measure ... [That] submission liberates us deep within." 

Papal discussion of relativism is noth­ing new. John Paul II, in 1991, denied that "agnosticism and skeptical rela­tivism" are the foundation of democracy. Rather, without an "ultimate truth to guide ... political activity ... ideas ... can be manipulated" as a means to power. A relativist democracy "easily turns into open or thinly disguised totalitarianism." That makes sense. If there is no acknowledged moral truth, political life becomes a power struggle among inter­ests, with no real limits to what the law can do. Similarly, in 1999, then-Cardinal Ratzinger identified as one of the "crises of law" the determination of what is just by the shifting consensus of the majority. 
Relativism is a problem of special note in the academic world. More than a few professors are absolutely sure that they can't be sure of anything. But relativism itself is absurd. If you say that all things are relative, you must admit that your statement, too, is relative. The jurispru­dence of a relativist society will be legal positivism in which any law, whether Dred Scott, Auschwitz, or whatever, will be considered valid if it is enacted by the preseribed procedure. A law cannot be criticized as unjust because nobody can know what is unjust. As Hans Kelsen, the 20th century's leading legal positivist, put it, "justice is an irrational ideal." 
The answer to relativism, however, is not in the false absolutes of ideology. Instead, Benedict XVI urges a "true revo­lution" in contrast to the ideological rev­olutions of the twentieth century which "assumed total responsibility for ... the world in order to change it ... [A] human and partial point of view was ... taken as an absolute guiding principle. Absolutizing what is not absolute but rel­ative is ... totalitarianism. It ... takes away [man's] dignity and enslaves him. It is not ideologies that save the world, but only a return to ... our Creator, the guar­antor of our freedom [and] what is ... good and true." 
Carrying on the truth-affirming mis­sion of John Paul, Benedict gently but firmly laid it on the line to the young people in Cologne. Without God, he said at the closing Mass, there is frustration and "dissatisfaction with everyone and everything. People tend to exclaim: This eannot be what life is about!"' One result is "a kind of new explosion of religion." But Benedict cautioned against letting religion become "a consumer product. ... [R]eligion constructed on a 'do-it-your­self basis ... may be comfortable, but at times of crisis we are left to oursdves." The answer is in Scripture and the teaching Church. 
So what is Benedict all about? He real­ly believes in objective moral Truth. Imagine that. And he capitalizes it because that Truth is a person. Like John Paul, he tells it like it is, especially to the young. At his inaugural Mass, he said, "I say to you, dear young people: Do not be afraid of Christ! He takes noth­ing away, and he gives you everything. When we give ourselves to him, we receive a hundredfold in return. Yes, open wide the doors to Christ -and you will fmd true life." 
Surprising numbers of young people seem to be listening to this man. Even at Notre Dame.

CD REVIEW 

Icelandic melodies are unmistakable blend of new flavors 
By VINCE LABRIOLI Scene Critic 
They have collaborated with Radiohead, been lauded by Chris Martin of Coldplay, and with their new album entitled "takk ... " Icelandic rockers Sigur R6s have produced a new, lighter sound that may move them into the limelight shared by the aforementioned bands and others in mainstream alternative music. 
Their most accessible album to date, "takk ... " is simultaneously fiery and uplift­ing, an intense, atmospheric album that is great for long walks with the iPod or sim­ply as background music while studying. 
"takk ... " is by no means a traditional album, continuing the trend Sigur R6s set with their first release, 1997's "von." That album was never widely released in the U.S., but the group's second effort, "agretis byrjun," was released in America to excel­lent reviews and established the band as a difficult, if ultimately rewarding, listening experience. Both "von" and "agretis byr­jun" are long, emotional albums with indi­vidual tracks that often take as long as 10 minutes to play out, filled with electronic buzzes and strange instruments that can haunt the listener well after the music has ended. 

Perhaps the most signature element of Sigur R6s' compositions are the ethereal, sexless vocals that drift thro.ugh the tracks. They are spoken in Icelandic and, for the most part, seem completely incom­prehensible. 
The vocals become yet another part of the evocative arrangements that Sigur R6s is known for. This new effort is no differ­ent. Although vocals were completely missing from the band's previous album, given the unpronounceable title "( )," "takk... " is filled with wistful spo­ken melodies that permeate every track. However, "takk... " is a much more tradi­tionally structured album than those that preceded it. Ambient noise fills much less space on the tracks, without compro­mising the ele­


albums. Nevertheless, it's difficult to talk about individual tracks on "takk .... " When the album is listened to from beginning to end it's nearly impossible to discern where one song ends and the next begins. 
Such is the case with "von," "agretis byr-· jun" and "( )," but those three albums are · heavy and dark, with only moments where the music eases up from its relent­less drive onward. In short, they're not the best albums to listen to when you're hav­ing a bad day, but they are the best albums to listen to when you want to brood. "takk ... ," by comparison, dedicates a considerable amount of time to simple, repetitious bell and xylophone melodies that give several songs an uplifting quality missing from Sigur R6s' earlier albums. 
This is most apparent in the second and sixth tracks of the album, titled "gl6s6li" and "saegl6pur," respectively. The latter in particular builds melodies and vocals on top of one another in such a powerful and unique way that while it is certainly a new sound, it remains unmistakably the work of Sigur R6s. 
Considered one of the most "artsy, avant-garde" groups currently producing, there is no doubt that Sigur R6s is an acquired taste. However, with "takk... " the band was willing to explore new ends of the musical spectrum and, as a result, created yet another amazing album. More than anything else, Sigur R6s has created their own unique brand of alternative music, and if you're in the mood for some­thing intense, emotional and, most impor­tantly, different, the Icelandic melodies on "takk ... " are worth spending some time with.

Bookmakers' Pub in South Bend is usu­ally considernd to be a fun, unassuming sports bar.

White Sox down Tigers, pad AL Central lead 
Yankees take one game lead over Red Sox in AL East; Indians fall to D-Rays 
Associated Press 
After taking a huge division lead and nearly giving it all up, the Chicago White Sox need just one more win to clinch a berth in the playoffs. 
Jose Contreras won his eighth straight start and Scott Podsednik had four hits, lead­ing the White Sox over the Detroit Tigers 8-2 Wednesday night and opening a three­game lead for Chicago in the AL Central. 
The White Sox would clinch no worse than a wild-card berth in the playoffs with one win in their last four games. 
"I just know we've got to win tomorrow," White Sox catcher 
A.J. Pierzynski said. "We've got four games left and that's the most important one." 
With Chicago's victory and second-place Cleveland's 1-0 loss to Tampa Bay, the White Sox lowered their magic num­ber to two for clinching their first division title since 2000. After Thursday's series finale in Detroit, the White Sox finish the regular season with three games at Cleveland. 
"To worry about what they're going to do in another city, you worry about stu(ffu stuff you can't control," White Sox man­ager Ozzie Guillen. "Just come back tomorrow and win the game." 
Chicago, which had lost its previous two games, led the AL Central by 15 games on Aug. 1 -no team with a lead of more than 13 games has ever failed to finish first. 
Carl Everett's two-run triple broke a 1-1 tie in the fifth, and Juan Uribe and Aaron Rowand homered for the White Sox, who had 15 hits. 
Carlos Pena homered for Detroit. 
Contreras (15-7) gave up two runs and seven hits in eight innings, walked none and struck out nine, one short of his career high. Bobby Jenks fin­ished with a three-hit ninth.

"It's still in our hands," said Lee, who lost for the first time since July 8. "It's just going to be a little tougher." Despite the loss, the Indians stayed tied for the wild-card lead with Boston. 
Toronto 7, Boston 2 
Bronson Arroyo doesn't have time to worry about his spot in the playoff rotation yet. He still might have to help the Red Sox get there. 
In his last scheduled start of the regular season, Arroyo gave up three homers as Boston lost to Toronto Wednesday night and dropped one game behind the Yankees in the AL East. The Red Sox have four games remaining, and Arroyo will be available in the bullpen for the three-game weekend series against New York. 
"We'll try to wipe this one away as quickly as possible," said Arroyo, who allowed seven runs and seven hits in three­plus innings. "I only threw 79 pitches, so I feel like I'll be healthy for the Yankees.... You always hope for the opportuni­ty. So, we'll see." 
Boston (92-66) remained tied in the wild-card race with Cleveland Indians, who lost to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 1-0. The Red Sox play Toronto on Thursday, then close with three games at Fenway Park against the Yankees (93-65). 


"This is the playoffs right now," outfielder Johnny Damon said. "It's amazing. It's here already before October comes." 
Frank Catalanotto doubled, tripled and homered as the Blue Jays opened a 7-1 lead and won their second straight over the Red Sox. Vernon Wells and Eric Hinske also homered, and Ted Lilly (1 0-11) allowed two runs, six hits and five walks in 6 2-3 innings to improve to 3-0 with a 2.40 ERA against the Red Sox this sea­son. 
Boston was just 1-for-10 with runners in scoring position and has been shut out for 9 2-3 innings by Toronto relievers. 
"We scored some runs to give him a little breathing room," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. "He pitched good. He got out of some big jams." 
Arroyo (14-10) hadn't allowed a homer while winning four consecutive decisions with a 
3.71 ERA in September, and had been 7-0 in the month for his career. But he gave up three homers -a season high -in the first three innings. 
New York 2, Baltimore 1 
Alex Rodriguez's eyes darted to the television screen as reporters gathered around his locker in the New York Yankees' clubhouse. 

Instead of fielding a question, he asked one. "What inning is it?" he inquired. 
Moments after the Yankees beat the Baltimore Orioles Wednesday night, Rodriguez and his teammates rushed off the field to find out if the victo­ry thrust New York into sole possession of first place in the AL East, one game ahead of Boston. 
After Manny Ramirez made the final out for the Red Sox in a 7-2 loss to Toronto, there was no commotion in the New York clubhouse. Just a feeling of sat­isfaction that will last at least until Thursday night's game against Baltimore. 
"It doesn't mean anything unless you come in and play well tomorrow," Rodriguez said. "It's obviously better to have a one-game lead than a tie, but we still have to come out here and play an important game tomorrow night." 
Rodriguez hit a milestone homer, Derek Jeter singled in the tiebreaking run in the sev­enth inning, and the Yankees used a fine pitching perform­ance by Shawn Chacon to get past the Orioles. 
Boston and New York meet in a three-game series beginning Friday night. The Yankees' vic­tory Wednesday means New York will need no more than two wins at Fenway Park to capture the division crown.

Red Sox, Yankees push for playoffs 
Associated Press 
Throughout tlw rieh fabric of baseball history, the Boston Bed Sox and Nnw York Yankees keep showing up, tlwir seasons froquontly intnr­t.wirwd. tlwir destinies of't<Hl dntermined in head-to-head showdowns. 
From Death Valley in Yankee Stadium to tlw Creon Monster in Fenway Park, a litany of dramatic confronta­tions oftpn have dnfinnd thnir seasons. 
Tlw eharaetnrs change. Wlwn~ on<~n thorn worn the YanknP Clipper and t.hn Spl<~ndid Splinter, and later (),mt and Yaz, now we havn A­Bod and Big l'api. Instead of Basehi pitching against Kinder. tlw Yankees have tho Big Unit and the Hed Sox have Boomer. 
It all adds up to the same thing -one final series between two old rivals to set­tin the season's accounts. 
Tlwy'll do it again this wnck­erHl at Boston, thrn11 games to decide the AI. East champi­onship, the Yankees and Hnd Sox going mano-a-mano. 
Perfect. 
Only once lwlim~ it did come down to this, the Hod Sox and Yankees playing a final rngu­lar-season series for first place. 
In I ')49, tlwir fatns eamn down to the last two games of tlw season. Boston held a onn­ganw lead with two to play at Yankee Stadium. The math was simple for the Hed Sox: win a ganw and win tho pen­nant. Tho challenge was a bit morn daunting for the Yankees, who had no margin for error. Lose one and they were done. 
A year earlier, the Yankees, Hod Sox and Cleveland Indians were locked in a thre<~-way battle for an AL pennant that was uncomplicated by divi­sions. With one eye on the scornboard and ho~ (:J<weland was doing, Boston beat New York in tho season's final two gamos. That knocked the Yankons out of thn race and forcnd a playoff with the Indians that Cleveland won. 
Now, a year later, the Indians were out of the pie­turn. This showdown would be strictly a two-team affair. Nobody would have to watch the scoreboard this time. 
Tho Hed Sox had rhased the Yankees all season, gaining the lead a weekend earlier by sweeping New York in Fenway Park. Then they WPnt on the road for thnir final five games, three in Washington against the hapless Senators and the final two at Yankee Stadium. When they arrived in New York, the Hed Sox were still elinging to that slender one­game lead. 
The two teams worn crowd­ed with superstars. 
Boston had MVP Ted Williams, who batted .343 and lnd the league with a career­best 43 home runs and tied teanunatn Vern Stephens with 159 HBis, and a pitrhing staff headed by 25-gamn winner Mel Parnell and Ellis Kinder, who won 23.

Patriots clutch in crunch time 
Associated Press 
FOXBOHOUGB. Mass. "Fonzic" takes the field with 81 seconds left and the game tied. "Robin Hood" follows with 5 sec­onds left and kieks the winning field goal. 
Better known as Tom Brady and Adam Vinatieri, the combi­nation manages to stay calm and produce under pressure time after time. 
Josh Miller, the New England Patriots' talented punter and punster, marvels so much at their eluteh performances that he came up with those nick­names. Brady is "Fonzie," the epitome of enol from the televi­sion show "Happy Days." Vinatieri is "Hobin Hood," who helps those in need. 
But what about Miller? "Josh is a funny guy," Brady said Wednesday with a grin. 
There arc plenty of smiles in the Patriots' locker room this week after Vinatieri's 43-yard lield goal with 1 second left gave them a 23-20 win at Pittsburgh last Sunday. Brady set it up by completing all three of his pass­es on the drive for 37 yards as part of his 12-for-12 fourth quarter. 
It was Vinatieri's 18th winning field goal in the fourth quarter or overtime. Two of thmn came in Super Bowls. It also was the 18th drive in Brady's live sea­sons as a starter that ended with the Patriots taking the lead in the fourth quarter or overtime. 
Last Sunday, they started at their 38-yard line with 1:21 left and the score tied at 20. 
"All you can do is put yourself in that situation. What would you do'?'' Miller said, "but you're watching this guy who's just like Fonzie. It's awesome.... lie's just a cool cat. He doesn't get rat­tled." 


Neither does Vinatieri, who depends on Miller to take the snap from Lonie Paxton and hold the ball properly. 
"We have Robin Hood who just comes in, does his thing and leaves. lie's cool," Miller said. 
The analogy isn't precise because Robin Hood took from the rich and gave to the poor. Winning thren Super Bowls in four years doesn't qualify the Patriots as needy, but in individ­ual games they sometimes find themselves behind and in need of a rescuer. 
Vinatieri never heard Miller usc the Hobin flood comparison and prefers to focus on the basics without mnbellishment:.

They did it in the Super Bowl that eapped the 2001 season. With the score tind at I 7, tlw Patriots startod at thnir 17-yard line with 1:21 to go and no limn­outs Id't.

NFL 


Associated Press 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. ­For now, the Tennessee Titans are putting their trust in running back Chris Brown. 
The Titans (1-2) lost Travis Henry on Monday to a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's sub­stance abuse policy, and coach Jeff Fisher said that freed up some money for Tennessee to possibly add a running back to the ros­ter to fill that void. 
But they hadn't made a roster move through Wednesday, and Fisher said Brown is ready to handle the work Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts (3-0). 

"He believes that if he can get on a roll and get moving, then we are going to keep feeding him the ball. That was our approach going into the game last week. This is really no different than last year," Fisher said. 
Pending a late move, rookie Damien Nash, a fifth-round pick out of Missouri, will back up Brown. Fisher also said fullback Troy Fleming is another option and that promoting Jarrett Payton, the son of the late Walter Payton, off the practice squad remains a possibility. 
The reason the Titans swapped a third-round pick to Bufi'alo for llenry in July before training camp was because they wanted an insurance policy for Brown. A third-round pick out of Colorado in 2003, Brown missed five games because of injuries as a rookie and five more in 2004 with turf toe. 
Brown may be at his healthiest yet despite a concussion on his first reception against Baltimore on Sept. 18 that sidelined him for the sec­ond half. Through three games, he had 39 carries for 179 yards with Henry getting 31 rushes for 97 yards. 
"He is issue-free I guess you could call it right now," Fisher said .. 
"He feels good and he is looking forward to the challenge this week with this defense. You have to hit the hole exceptionally fast and quick to get creas­es because things close up very quickly. 
He knows .it is a chal­lenge as does our offensive line." 
Brown is ready to show the Titans he can handle the work. 
''I'm just going to go out there knowing my team­mates are depending on me to get the job done." 
IN BRIEF 
McNair misses practice, will 
play against Colts 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair didn't practice Wednesday because of a sore foot, but isn't expected to miss any more time. 
McNair and receiver Drew Bennett, who were not listed on the early injury report, sat out practice because of sore feet. Both were added to the injury report after prac­tice. 
McNair is expected back on the field Thursday. 
"I think both of them will practice tomorrow," Titans coach Jeff Fisher said. 
Defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth, who missed last week's 31-27 loss at St. Louis with a sprained left knee, remains question­able. Fisher said both Haynesworth and receiver Courtney Roby (left turf toe) are improving. 
Linebacker Peter Sirmon could 

have practiced but didn't. He played last weekend despite an injury to his right knee. 
"What we wanted was to just shut him down. He did a great job getting back last week. We kept him out of change-of-direction things and got some conditioning and shut him down," Fisher said. Champ Car World Series cancels Korea race 
The Champ Car World Series called off its Grand Prix of Ansan, sched­uled for Oct. 16 in South Korea, a blow for a series struggling to regain its place in the top echelon of racing. 
But series executive vice president Joe Chrnelich said Wednesday that dropping the race, even two weeks before the race, is not a big setback for the American-based open-wheel series. 
"At first blush it would appear to be a step backward, but what it real­ly demonstrates is that we are going to do whatever it takes to ensure that every Champ Car race is a world­class event," he said. Winborn loses starting job,
will leave via trade 
SANTA ClARA, Calif. -Linebacker Jamie Winborn cleaned out his locker and left the San Francisco 49ers on Wednesday as the club abruptly announced plans to trade the former starter. 
Winborn lost his job to converted defensive end Andre Carter last week, and coach Mike Nolan suggested the fifth-year pro should stay away while the 49ers find him a new home. 
"He sees himself as a starter, and I would tend to agree with that," Nolan said. "It just won't be here." 
Winborn's departure is the biggest move yet in a promised shakeup by Nolan, who hasn't been pleased with the 49ers (1-2) after consecutive loss­es. 
Nolan said he already received sev­eral inquiries from teams seeklng the speedy linebacker.

'sup with Marian apparitions? Do I have to believe in them to be a good Catholic? 
At various points throughout the history of Christianity, those m heaven made rather miraculous appearances to those still on earth. One of the most and best-known accounts of an apparition occurs when Jesus appears to 
Paul (then Saul) on his journey to Damascus, which ellectivcly converts him Christianity (sec Acts 9: 1-1 0). Many times since then, Jesus, Mary, and vari­. saints have miraculously appeared to provide messages ofencouragement, 
or admonishment to believers in various parts of the world. Some 
the best known Christian shrines throughout the world mark the place where , as the Mother of Jesus, has reportedly appeared. The names of these are familiar to many: Lourdes, Fatima, Guadalupe, often appearing in this 
as the name of a church or chapel with an "Our Lady of..." in front of location. Despite the diverse epochs and locales where Mary has appeared, flicially-recognized apparitions have many characteristics in common. First, the apparitions ollen occur to people with minimal theological ucation, thus defusing skeptics' claims that the individuals made the stories 
on their own. For example, when Mary appeared at the grotto in Lourdes, ranee, in 1858, she did so to a young girl who was nearly tailing her catechism lass. When Bernadette reported to the local priest that the Lady appearing to 
had called herself the "Immaculate Conception," two things were made clear the priest: I. that the Lady appearing was indeed Mary, the Mother of God, 
nd 2. that Bernadette couldn't possibly have made up such a story, as that title only recently (in 1854) been dogmatically declared by the universal Church, Bernadette would have had no real access to or knowledge of such detailed 
I infonnation. A similar situation can likewise be seen with the shep­children of Fatima (Pot1ugal, 1917) or Juan Diego of Guadalupe (Tepeyae, ico, 1531 ). 
Secondly, the messages given by Mary have as central themes repen­
ce, prayer, and the return to a right relationship with God. These messages ways point one towards a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ, and never end Mary herself. Otten apparitions have occurred in those areas in moral or re­gious turmoil: places where wars were about to break out, where Communism 
threatening the fhith, where people were being led astray by vices of various 
s. Authentic messages never contradict revealed Christian truth, and follow­tlw advice given by Mary always leads the true believer to a deeper sense of and holiness. So do I have to believe in them'? Most often, apparitions arc examples f private revelations, where Mary appears and gives a message to one or a small of individuals. Unlike general revelation (ie, revelation found in Sacred cripturc and Tradition, which ended with the death of the last apostle), private · ions are only binding upon those who receive them. Thus, there is no 
ent that Catholics believe in any Marian apparitions or the messages 1rted therein. though many find great solace and a deeper peace in doing so.

Yet, in the dugout, Torre's behavior usually was tho same -either sitting stoically on the bench or, in ballparks wlwre that affords little view of tho field, loaning on a rail, with pitehing eoaeh Mel Stottlemyrn and bench coach Joe Girardi at his side. 
"Joe is the kind of pnrson that will not show his enw­tions," said center fielder Bernie Williams, the longest­tenured member of tho current Yankees at 15 years.

she played No. 4 singles and compiled a 22-13 record. She also teamed up with Brook Buck to post a 27-12 record at No. 2 doubles. The marketing major also boasts a 3.7 GPA. 
The senior's ability to combine her work ethic with light-heart­ed moments has made her well­liked among her teammates. More importantly, she has earned her teammates' respect. 
"She's funny and she keeps the team loose; she's got a great per­sonality," Louderback said. "She has also matured over four years and has developed into a great leader." 
Connelly was quick to point out that the responsibility for leading the Irish this season will fall on all five seniors on the team. 
'There are four other seniors with me, so it's not all on me," she said. 'Tm just going to look at what past seniors have done and learn from that. Everyone on the team is really close, so that makes it easier too." 
Louderback also felt that past a good leader is that she was a good follower," he said. "She's done everything we've ever asked of her since she's been here." 
Much of the focus will be put on Connelly to lead a talented Irish team to national prowess. In addition to her singles play, Connelly will team up with fel­low senior Kiki Stastny to anchor the doubles lineup at No. 2 posi­tion. Connelly's aggressive nature on the tennis court makes her a force in doubles, which Louderback thinks will be a strength of his team this sea­son. 
"She loves to come to the net," Louderback said. "She plays bet­ter when she comes forward, that's what makes her a very good doubles player. We have the potential to put three very good doubles teams on the court this year." 
Connelly has been a key con­tributor to the recent success of the women's tennis program, and her efforts have not gone unrewarded. She feels the team has taught her important life­long values about teamwork and effect on more than one person. I've also learned to communi­cate better by interacting with my teammates," she said. 
The last three years also afforded Connelly a unique opportunity to play with her sis­ter Sarah Jane, who graduated in the spring. Connelly and Louderback agreed that the two enjoyed the experience and that they grew closer working togeth­er. The Connellys, along with Thompson twins, Christian and Catrina, have helped to develop a family atmosphere that has brought the team close and allowed them to play together and rise in the rankings. 
This season as the Irish look to defend their Big East champi­onship and rise into the top 10 in the national rankings, Connelly knows she will play her best if she continues to let her person­ality come out in her tennis game. 
"I just like to have fun out there," she said. "I play my best when I'm loose and relaxed."

that Mattia did, and recalled her first experience in college­level competition, as well as how much she has grown since. 
"She was rather quiet [as a freshman], but I could tell she was a good golfer," Hamilton said. "In her first tournament she was rather nervous ... and shot a score I'm sure she'd like to forget ... but she became more accustomed to playing college golf and has blossomed into probably the most consis­tent player that I've had for the school." 
And it is exactly that consis­tency that Mattia has used to lead the way for her team this year. She may not be the most vocal person on the team, but then golf was never designed to be a vocal sport. 
Mattia has done an outstand­ing job so far this year of help­ing to fill the big shoes left by last year's extremely successful senior class. At the beginning of the fall, Mattia spoke about her goals for her last season with the Belles. 
"Individually I just want to play really well. ..to make first team all-conference, to keep improving, and to score well. And I really want to win con-goals to be met this year. The Belles are in perfect position to take the conference title for a fourth year in a row, and Mattia has been consistently finishing rounds in the high 70s and low 80s. 
With her success at the con­ference competitions, she is likely to earn MIAA honors for her fourth and final year, and will look to lead her team to another NCAA appearance in the spring. 
And to be successful at that, Mattia will only need to do more of what she has been doing. She has been to three NCAA championships and is about to win her fourth MIAA title with the Belles, giving her enough experience in the pro­gram to have an impact on any team. 
"I think she shows people how to shoot low scores on the golf course," Hamilton said. "She knows she shouldn't get rattled. She 'II stay the course and keep working at it and good things will happen. 
"I expect her to keep doing what she's doing, playing solid­ly and being Megan. "She's got the experience ... and she never fails me."

Hokies coach blames 
himself for last year 
Associated Press 
Blame it on the coach. 
That's essentially what Virginia Tech's Frank Beamer said Tuesday about the Hokies' last visit to Morgantown, which ended in a 28-7 loss to West Virginia. 
It seems Beamer started feel­ing real good about his team, which went into the rivalry game 6-0 and ranked No. 3 in the nation, the same ranking it has now. 
Like Saturday's game, that one came after the Hokies manhan­dled a good team -Syracuse in 2003, Georgia Tech last week­end -51-7 in a raucous Lane Stadium. 
"We had just played really well against Syracuse and (former West Virginia coach) Don Nehlen's a great friend," Beamer recalled, somewhat sheepishly. "We're talking before the game and I'm saying, 'Don, we're pretty good. We've got a good football team,' and Don's saying, 'Well, I'm going to tell you this place is ready for you.' 


"And I said, 'I know. We know exactly what we're getting in to, but we're a good football team,' and we were. But that good foot­ball team -we fumbled five times, we threw three intercep­tions and we had 13 penalties for 115 yards." 
The loss, and one two games later at Pittsburgh, ended the Hokies' championship hopes in their final season in the Big East. And even though Virginia Tech got some redemption last year, beating the No. 6 Mountaineers 19-13, a bitter taste lingers. 
For Beamer, the uncharacter­istic cockiness provided a lesson he won't forget.

Philadelphia scores 16 runs in the win over New York, Trachsel

I'IIIIAI>ELI'IIIA-Chaso Utley hit a thrno-run homer and drove in five runs, and David Bell and Kenny Lofton each had four hits to give the Philadelphia Phillies' fading postsoason hopos a boost with a 16-6 win over the New York Mots on Wodnesday night. 
Thn Phillies avoided a three­game sweop and maintained their slim chance of catching Houston for the NL wild card. Tim Phillies began the day 2 1/2 games behind the Astros, who playNI in St. Louis and finish the season with four horne games against the Cubs. 
The Phillies arc off Thursday and elosc the season with a throe-game series in Washington.

Philadelphia desperately needed the victory after two erushing losses to the Mets. The bullpen squandered a three-run lead in the eighth inning on Monday, and Bell's critical basnrunning blunder in the eighth on Tuesday cost the Phillies two games they could have won.

"It was very symbolie. It seems likes we get in that situation and we don't get anything. It's very frustrating," manager Dusty Baker said after Wednesday's loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. "We had a great chance to win that game." 
The Cubs figured to win a lot of games this season, especially at their cozy neighborhood ball park. Instead, baseball's lovable losers were 38-43 at Wrigley Field and must sweep a four­game series at Houston to finish at .500 overall.

The loss pushed the Brewers back to the .500 mark (79-79) as they try to finish with a winning record for the first time since 1992, when they were still in the American League. 
Reds center fielder Wily Mo Pena hyperextended his lower back when he crashed into the wall diving for Bill Hall's line drive in the fourth. Pena hit his head and left shoulder and remained on the ground while left fielder Hyan Freel retrieved the ball.

NFL 
Rookie receiver part of Vikings' game plan 
Associated Press 
EDEN PHAIHIE, Minn. ­Minnesota Vikings coach Mike Tice has been trying to take it slow with Troy Williamson. 
This rookie isn't used to doing anything slow. 
Tice had wanted to be patient with Minnesota's top draft pick, hoping to keep the Handy Moss comparisons to a minimum. 
Heading into just his fourth game as a pro, Williamson's con­siderable skills -and an injury to No. 1 receiver Nate Burleson -have made the speedy new­comer a big part of the game plan heading into Sunday's game at Atlanta. 
"We know that he is a real burner and he plays the ball very well in the air," Tice said. "We are not holding anything back now due to Nate's injury. He is in the game." 
Williamson does everything fast. He learns fast, eats fast and talks fast. 
Oh yeah, he runs fast, too. Williamson ran in the low 4.3s in the 40-yard dash at the com­bine. 
"Any football player that has speed, that's a good thing," Williamson said. "You can learn everything else, but you can't teach speed. I'm glad that I was blessed with that asset. I can learn how to learn a route and catch a ball, but you can't learn how to run fast." 
Not surprisingly, it didn't take long for the seventh overall draft choice out of South Carolina to show what he can do. 
In the second quarter of last week's win over New Orleans, Williamson got behind man cov­erage and hauled in a 53-yard touchdown pass from Daunte Culpepper that propelled the Vikings (1-2) to victory. 
"It felt real good," Culpepper said. "Just putting it out there and letting him run and get it. That's what I like to do ... and we have been doing that for years in this offense. We have to keep that in the back of people's minds that we can hit you over the top if you are not careful." 
Williamson finished with three catches for 83 yards and let opposing defenses know that the Vikings' offense is still danger­ous, even without No. 84. 
The Vikings' offense has strug­gled mightily to find an identity without Moss, who was traded to the Raiders after seven record-setting seasons in Minnesota. The Vikings selected Williamson over USC receiver Mike Williams for his speed and game-breaking ability, two things that were in short supply when Moss was traded. 
Even though he is only a rook­ie, and light-years away from the ultra-talented Moss, oppos­ing coaches are already getting the message. 
"Especially after the play he made last week," Atlanta coach Jim Mora said. "You saw what happens if you let him off the line clean. He can just go.... The kid has got the ability to be spe­cial -really, really special." 

Manning looks to tie record 
Associated Press 

INDIANAPOLIS -Peyton Manning has always been there when his teammates needed him. Whether it's on game days, in the locker room or inside the film room, the Indianapolis Colts have count­ed on the NFL's two-time MVP to be on the field. Anything less is unimaginable. 
In seven-plus seasons, Manning has never missed a game. On Sunday at Tennessee, Manning is expect­ed to make his 116th consecu­tive start, setting a franchise record and tying Bon Jaworski for the second­longest streak by an NFL quarterback. 
"I like to play, I like being in there," Manning said Wednesday. "It's more fun being in there than being on the sidelines." 
For Manning, the records have become almost as rou­tine as the starts. 
He and Marvin Harrison hooked up six times last Sunday to break the NFL record for most yards passing between a quarterback and receiver. Manning also became the second-fastest player to top 30,000 yards, taking 115 games -one more than Miami's Dan Marino. 
This week, Manning is ready to break the franchise mark for consecutive starts, set by former Colts center Ken Mendenhall (115). Next week, Manning should pass Jaworski, leaving only Brett Favre's record 208-game streak between Manning and another milestone. 

Like Favre, Manning has become the identity of his franchise because of his relia­bility. He helped turn Indianapolis from an NFL also-ran into a perennial Super Bowl contender, and without Manning, nobody knows where the Colts would be. 
Fortunately, they've never had to ponder the thought. 
"Next question," tight end Dallas Clark said when asked about the Colts' offense with­out Manning. "One-hundred sixteen? That's a lot of games. It shows you his consistency, his dependability. l-Ie's always there, always ready to play." 
Manning's track record sup­ports that contention. 
He earned the starting job at the University of Tennessee three games into the 1994 season and never gave ii up. When his college stats are added to those with the Colts, Manning's consecutive start streak hits 161. 
Twice it looked like Manning's streak might end, but he toughed it out. 
In August 2001, Manning was twisted awkwardly in a preseason game at Minnesota. A right knee sprain did the unthinkable, keeping Manning out of the Colts' meaningless preseason finale, the first pro game he'd ever missed.

Nittany Lions hope to contain Gophers' Maroney 
Associated Press 

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. -The plan to stop Minnesota running back Laurence Maroney sounds pretty simple: control the line of scrimmage and have tacklers swarm him when he gets the ball. 
Penn State linebacker Paul Posluszny knows the task will be much tougher than it sounds when Maroney and the 18th-ranked Gophers (4-0, 1-0 Big Ten) visit Happy Valley on Saturday. 
"l-Ie's a really strong downhill runner," said the square-jawed Posluszny, one of Penn State's defensive leaders. "We've got to get as many people to the football as we can." 
Maroney, a Heisman Trophy hopeful, leads Division I-A with 
174.5 rushing yards per game. "He doesn't really have much going against him," Posluszny said. 
Maroney is usually eluding and speeding away "from would-be tacklers. Last week. the 5-foot-11, 210-pound jun­ior pounded out a career-high 217 yards on 46 carries in the Golden Gophers' 42-35 double­overtime win over Purdue. The Boilermakers had the nation's top-ranked rushing defense coming into the contest. 
Like any good running back, Maroney is quick to credit an offensive line anchored by two four-year starters, Greg Eslinger at center and Mark Setterstrom at guard. The Gophers' athletic linemen run a zone blocking scheme to open up running lanes. 
"I need to be patient so I can give the line time to set up their blocks," Maroney said. "I think I've got enough quickness and speed to be patient and then when I see the hole, hit it fast and hard." 
Penn State, which is off to its best start since going 9-0 in 1999, hasn't faced a power­running attack yet this season. Nittany Lions coach Joe Paterno is quite impressed. 
"They are a very, very well­coached, dominant football team that's going to run it down your throat," Paterno said. 

His defense isn't too shabby either, allowing just 85 yards per game on the ground. Last week, though, Penn State gave up 198 rushing yards in its last-minute 34-29 win over Northwestern, including 112 yards and two touchdowns to freshman Tyrell Sutton. 
Penn State's defense is laden with experienced linemen, tal­ented linebackers and a quar­tet of senior starters in the sec­ondary that allow the front seven to take risks. 
"They've got a lot of guys that can do great things in the box, so its going to be a great battle in the trenches," Eslinger said. 
Posluszny, known as "Puz" or "Poz" to his teammates, plays with unsurpassed intensity on the field and displays quiet leadership off. He had 22 tack­les last week against the Wildcats -the most by a Penn State player since 1977 -and could be busy again against Minnesota. 
Posluszny likes to block out anything not related to football before a game and straps on headphones to listen to hard rock bands like Korn and Metallica. 

"He gets tuned in," defensive tackle Scott Paxson said. ''I'm glad he's playing on my team." 
Paxson said the defensive line must occupy the Minnesota linemen to "keep our lineback­ers free so that Puz can make tackles and do what he does best." 
Paterno remains concerned about fatigue on his defense, which was on the field for 95 plays last week.

He's not about to get into a discussion of what beating the Gators (4-0, 2-0) would mean personally or how it would affect his legacy.

down his line of scrimmage at the depth of five yards, doing what the conventional option quarterbacks do on the line of scrimmage. 
"They still have all the triple option reads with the pitch, and they've got all the triple option playaction passes off the option, and they do it from back where at any time they can snap the ball and be in the gun with potentially five receivers." 
Ultimately, more so than other offensive systems, Purdue's style of play caters to the exploitation of one-on-one match-ups within the defense. 
"It's basketball on grass when you think about," Minter said "It's about match-ups and playing in space and making the one on one play -that's their intention. It's also caused them to become a little more physical in that they are committing themselves to run the ball a little more, so it was an addition they probably thought they needed." 

For Weis, the incorporation of the option presents more challenges than those that naturally accompany defend­ing such a quick, multi­faceted style. 
"They have evolved that offense into such a more bal­anced offnnse than they have been in the past," Weis said. "It causes a whole buneh of problems. When a team is basically a throwing team first, if you can go in there and make sure that they don't run the ball on you, at least you'll have a fighting chance because you can play a men­tality where they are just going to throw it on every down. Now. you no longer can pereeive their offense as one­dimensional." 
Building on an already well­respected Tiller offense, the Boilermakers hope to confuse Notre Dame defenders with the inherent difficulty of the offense, an intention acknowl­edged by cornerback Mike Hichardson. 
"With them being able to spread out as much as they do, and then be able to incor­porate the option into it, it's going to be pretty complex to defend against," Hichardson said. "As a team, we'v11 boen preparing for it as much has possible."

Arnold Palmer tried to hit it out of a creek on the 15th hole to make a double bogey and lose the tournament," said the University of North Carolina basketball coach, who played in the pro-am on Wednesday. "That's how far back I go." 
Now, the question is whether the tour's reorganized sehed­ule in 2007 has room for the Chrysler Classic of Greensboro. Nothing is final­ized, but the tour is moving toward a season that would end in thP. middle of September with the Tour Championship, preceded by three tournaments that would be part of a points-chase toward a $10 million prize for the winner. 
The tournament in Greensboro currently is part of the Fall Finish. a group of 11 events beginning Labor Day wHekend that eompiHtes the brutal 4 7 -week season. 
"The Fall Finish, it is impor­tant to all of us, there's no doubt about it," Sergio Garda said. "There's some really good events in the fall. I try to give it the best shot I ean."

Raining wins 

Notre Dame's victory in the poor weather over Bradley moves them to 6-3 
By KEVIN BRENNAN 
Sports Writer 
Bobby Clark feels like he's gone home. 
For the second straight game, the Notre Dame head coach watched his team battle 
through pouring rain and strong winds-con­ditions much more com­monly found on the pitch in Clark's native land. 


"It's like Clark playing back in Scotland," Clark said. "This is par for the course back in Scotland. That's two games in a row. We're getting used to it now." 
While the weather remained the same, the result improved for the Irish. After falling 2-1 to I

Belles roll, shut dovvn MIAAfoe 
DuBree scores twice in the strong victory 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 
It was another game, another win and another step towards the forefront of the MIAA pack for the Belles soccer team after trouncing Adrian College 5-0 at home on Wednesday afternoon. 
The Belles were spearheaded by the sweet touch of midfielder turned all-out attacker Sarah DuBree, who struck twice in the Belles-dominated affair. A strong first half coupled with a second half mix of strong defensive play and explosive power vaulted Saint Mary's into third place in the MIAA conference, 4-2 in league play and 5-4 overall.

NO WOMEN'S TENNIS 
Connelly loving the opportunity to play 
By RYAN KIEFER Sports Writer 
Lauren Connelly is living in the moment. 
The senior captain of the women's tennis team has a very simple goal for herself this sea­son-enjoy every minute. 
"I want to keep everyone motivated this year," Connelly said. "But this is my last season and my last year playing !com­petitive] tennis. I just want to have fun and appreciate every­thing that happens." 
Connelly's easygoing nature should not be interpreted as lacking effort or focus. 
In fact, it's quite the opposite. 
"She works hard," coach Jay Louderback said. "She is one of the players that comes in the most outside practice to work on her game." 
The results speak to her dedi­cation. Connelly has won more than 70 percent of her career doubles matches. Last season
