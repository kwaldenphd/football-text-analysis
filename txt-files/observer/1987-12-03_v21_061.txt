In Brief 
Chicago's acting mayor was sworn in yesterday, succeeding the late Harold Washington. Veteran black Al­derman Eugene Sawyer was chosen in a raucous City Council meeting amid charges of a return to machine politics. Sawyer, elected with support from old-guard whites, immediately vowed that Washington's reform movement "shall remain intact and go forward. It will continue untainted by special interests for the rich and powerful." Sawyer was elected at 4:01a.m., climaxing a chaotic 19 hours of political intrigue. Ten aldermen re­ported de&.th threats, an estimated 5,000 protesters mobbed City Hall and a lawsuit was filed in an unsuccess­ful bid to stop the council's selection of an acting mayor.

Special TV Guide lists Christmas sentiments 
Now, I'm hardly one to advocate television viewing. Aside from my daily soap opera and college football games, I rarely blow the dust off my set. It horrifies me to realize that the level of programming has descended to the likes of "Alf." 
This is the time of year, however, when tele­vision traditionally takes a turn for the better. Christmas specials, old and new, fill our screens with magic, music and all the best imagery and imagination of the season. 
All these shows are a part of my past, present and future, I'm sure. I watch them all every year; many I•know by heart. Some people would call my behavior childish. I call it a sanity­saver. 
I have Notre Dame memories, good and bad, associated with these specials ... the year we had a pre-SYR Christmas party and watched all dressed up ... the year we tried to tape the shows and the VCR became disconnected ... the year they dragged me against my will to the final that made me miss the Grinch ... the year friends battled across campus in a blinding snowstorm just to watch with us. It is a special time. 
Christmas is in many ways a child's holiday. The TV specials are catered to children's young minds, uncorrupted by the "real world," still able to believe in intangible things. They teach subtle lessons of which the holiday season seeks to remind us with words and songs about good­ness, sharing, giving, hope and love. I think, especially at this time of year, it doesn't hurt to remember some of those words. No time can be more stressful than finals week at Notre Dame. Who needs the mental break and gentle reminders of these specials more than us? 
As with wine and most music, the old ones are the best. Sadly, many of the newer shows feature less and less make-believe (and car­toons) and more and more pop stars. Here's a very biased selection of season favorites: 
Frosty the Snowman -Little Karen cries when the real-world conditions of the greenhouse melt her special friend away, but Santa's magic breeze spins Frosty back to life. Sometimes just believing in something is enough to make it so. 
'Twas the Night Before Christmas -Cynical Albert mouse is much too practical to believe in a fat man in a red coat, and his meddling almost costs the town a visit from Santa. In the act of repairing his damage, he learns about the value of believing in something that doesn't make human sense, and that just being sorry isn't always enough. Even a miracle needs a hand. 
A Charlie Brown Christmas -Hapless Charlie Brown is the director of the Christmas play, 

Melissa Warnke 
Production Manager 
but with the standard abuse comes the realiza­tion of just how much he can give to others. Complete with subtle points about materialism, the true Christian meaning of Christmas friendship, and how a little love can go a long way, this is definitely not to be missed. 
The Grinch Who Stole Christmas -The green monster wants to ruin the day for everyone, but when little Cindy Lou Who shows him the tiniest bit of care, he becomes a model celebrator. Sometimes we need to look beyond someone's ugly green exterior to find the heart two sizes too large that hides inside. 
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer -Unloved Rudolph with his shiny red nose and his friend Herbie the elf, a would-be dentist, leave the North Pole --ashamed of that which makes them different. But it is Herbie's skill with tools that saves everyone from the Bumble, and we all know what an asset Rudy's honker turns out to be. It's okay to be different. 
Will most children watching these shows pick up on their underlying messages? Probably not. Can we watch them again and find something new to think about? Maybe so. 
So if anybody finds out when "The Year with­out a Santa Claus" is on, please let me know. I love to watch the Snow Miser and Heat Miser battle it out every year.

Associated Press 
ATLANTA--Cuban inmates holding 89 hostages met with a lawyer Wednesday to discuss matters raised in talks to end the standoff and heard a taped appeal from a Cuban-born bis­hop credited with ending a Louisiana uprising. 
Auxiliary Bishop Agustin Roman of Miami's Roman Catholic Archdiocese said he told the inmates: "Be very charitable with all the hostages because every person is our brother. I wish the situation would finish well, honorable . . . . Don't ask more than the law permits."

Atlanta prison still at stalemate 
Roman said he will travel to the prison, probably on Thursday, "as a brother, not a negotiator." He told Miami television station WPLG that he anticipated an end to the 10­day crisis by the time he ar­rived and hoped to "celebrate with my brothers." 
Earlier, the Rev. Francisco Santana, archdiocese spokes­man for Hispanic affairs, charged that federal negotiators were standing in the way of mediation by Roman and a quick end to the crisis prompted by inmate fears of deportation . 
But U.S. Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten said Roman has not asked to be part of the negotiating team. 
Leshaw, after meeting with the inmate leaders, said he was "not there to negotiate. I was there to answer questions for the detainees." 
"I think there is one major stumbling block," Leshaw said. "I think if we could get that issue, we have a real good chance for a settlement. 
"I don't want to get tremen­dously optimistic or tremen­dously pessimistic. We've been at this for eight or nine days and we're still here." 
No talks between federal of­ficials and inmate representa­tives were scheduled, Korten said. 

Also on Wednesday, six in­mates met with Gary Leshaw of the Atlanta Legal Aid Soci­ety, who has represented some of them. Leshaw said after­ward there was one n.ajor ob­stacle to a settlement but he refused to disclose the issue. 
The tape of Roman was played in Spanish over the penitentiary's public address system to the estimated 1,100 Cuban inmates holding the prison. 
An appeal from Roman to surrender was credited with ending an eight-day siege at tl)e federal prison in Oakdale, La. About 1,000 inmates there freed their 26 hostages Sunday.

Sports memorabilia endowed 
By LYNNE R. STRAND Staff Reporter 
The University has com­mitted $1 million to endow an existing sports memorabilia collection to honor Father Edmund Joyce, Notre Dame's execu­tive vice-president emeritus. 
Joyce, who oversaw three decades of Notre Dame ath­letic growth, retired this spring from the position of executive vice president, which he held since 1952. 
The current executive vice-president, Father William Beauchamp, said, "It's a very fine collection, and that quality should be maintained for academic re­search." 
Most of the funds came from one unnamed source, according to Beauchamp. 
"We wanted to honor Fa­ther Joyce and it seemed the best way through the endow­ment since the collection already had a need," said Beauchamp. The endow­ment will help preserve and update the collection and pay for its supplies. 
The collection begins on the Hesburgh Library's first-floor concourse with the majority of the collection being housed in the base­ment. 
Visitors can touch a sweater Knute Rockne wore in 1927-28 and view an airplane's pulley wheel from Rockne's fateful 1931 crash. The collection also displays the original script of "Knute Rockne, All American" and the camera Rockne used to film football practices in 1923. 
A Knute Rockne postage stamp which will be issued soon, will be included in the collection, according to the collection's curator, Jethrow Kyles, who said, "It's by far the best collegiate sports collection in the country. .The others are regional­based." 
A film of every Notre Dame football game played is stored there along with a video machine. 
Only 18 per cent of the col­lection consists of Notre Dame memorabilia and ma­terial. All sports, especially fencing, golf, and billiards are included, along with 6,000 catalogued books, 500,000 uncatalogued pro­grams, books, and photographs, and some 5,000 film reels --5.25 million feet long. One hundred seventy­two magazine titles and 46,000 programs are represented. 
The collection features films of bowl games, a New York Times index of Babe Ruth articles, and a reproduction of a boardgame discovered in Tutankhamon's tomb.

Student support helps in moment of need 
It seems that lately a lot of bad thmgs have been said about us domers. And .. do you know who the guilty domer­abusers are? Ourselves. Getting through a single day without hearing how we guys are jerks or how the girls are witches (censored) is nearly impossible. Well, at this time I would like to say a few words in favor of those inconsiderate losers, or domers as we call ourselves. 
Paul Kane 
guest column 

But first you are going to have to lis­ten to my sob story. 
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas of my sophomore year (1985), while I was on foreign study in Ireland, I received the news that my sister had been diagnosed of having leukemia. "Is there any hope?" I asked my sister over the 3000-mile phone con­versation. "Yeah well, they've got this thing called a bone-marrow transplant which could possibly cure me," she responded, "but there are no guaran­tees and we probably won't have to deal with it for another two or three years." 
Actually, the way in which her leukemia had been discovered was somewhat of a quirk of fate. Earlier that fall she had been bitten by a tick and got 'Rocky Mountain spotted fever.' This disease alone can be fatal, but the proper medication was given and she soon recovered. However, her white blood count remained unusually high. From this her leukemia was dis­covered. Our family is now quite thank­ful for that dumb little tick. 
Immediately upon my return from Ireland in mid-May, I went to the Red Cross Blood Center and had myself tested to see if I was a suitable donor, for my brother had already been tested and had not matched up genetically as close as the doctors would have liked. The test results concluded that I was indeed to be the donor. In my own mind though, I could not see this operation taking place until after graduation. 
In mid-June 1986, my sister made a visit to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Reasearch Center in Seattle, Washing­ton for a consultation. Upon examining her, the doctors informed her that in­stead of waiting a few years to treat her, they wanted to perform the transplant while the disease was still in its early stages and she was still healthy and strong. The date of the pro­cedure was moved up from the un­foreseen future to mid-September. My request for a semester leave of absence was granted by the University and on September 1, we went to Seattle. 
At this point I will not go into all the details of the procedure, but I will men­tion that the doctors requestM that I remain in Seattle for at least a month and a half after the actual transplant in case my sister needed any more blood or marrow. So I decided to stay in Seattle for the entire semester. 

It was during those four long, painful months that the true character of the Notre Dame students started coming out. Living over one thousand miles away from my home in Oklahoma, and equally as far from Notre Dame, and with little opportunity to meet anyone my age, I need not stress the potential for loneliness. I occasionally heard from my friends in Oklahoma, but the people who really came through for me were the friends I had made in the two years previous to the whole affair. I had always loved getting mail, but in Seattle, the daily mail truly became the highlight of many days. My support team back here under the golden dome became irreplaceable. 
At Christmas my sister returned to home in Oklahoma, well along the road to recovery. And after Christmas I returned to Notre Dame, a place I had not seen for over a year and a half. The warmth of the reception I got upon re­turning was unbelievable. Friends I had not seen since freshman year were around me once again. People I had never seen in my life were coming up and asking how my sister was doing. Freshmen and sophomores whom I had never had the chance to meet came to me telling me of how they had heard about my situation and how they had prayed for my sister and me. 
A little over two months ago (September 1986), my sister went back to Seattle for her yearly check-up (which is required of all patients of the cancer research center). At that time they declared her 'normal' once again. No more medications. No more monthly check ups. A year's worth of fingernail biting and praying had not gone in vain after all. I am happy to report that she now works part-time and lives a happy, normal life back in Oklahoma. 
With that burden off my back those around me may see a 'new me.' Or per­haps an old me; the me of freshman year once again. For those people who 'put up' with me over the past year, I thank you. You have helped me realize that despite the cynicism and griping that is heard so often around campus and in this newspaper, there is hope for the salvation of the domer character. I also wish to thank anyone who took even the smallest interest in my sister's story. The support I received from here was just as important to me as my mar­row was to my sister.

Save a life, write a letter 

Dear Editor: 
Apartheid. Military Regimes. Totalitarianism. What do these politi­cal realities bring to your mind? Lack of freedom? Victimized people? Citizens' loss of control? All around the world, governments oppress their peoples. They prohibit freedom of speech, religion, individual expression. Here in the United States, we take for granted our basic freedoms. We have individual opinions and lifestyles which are respected in this country. 
We who are free in this world have a duty to relieve the oppressed around the globe. Amnesty International, an independent organization unaffiliated with any government, political party or religious creed, was founded in 1961. It unites the world-wide efforts to free the 
Doonesbury 
oppressed. Amnesty International has more than 500,000 members in 150 countries who work to free prisoners of conscience-those people imprisoned for their b~liefs, color, sex, ethnic origin, language or religion, provided that they have never used nor advocated vio­lence. Amnesty International has a local chapter with members from Notre Dame, St. Mary's and the South Bend community. Amnesty International needs your involvement. 
Amnesty's local chapter is sponsor­ing two prisoners of conscience: Mr. Ibrahim Orizov, a Turk living in Bul­garia, and Mr. Mutil Henri Fazzi of South Africa. Amnesty International believes that Mr. Orizov has been ar­rested for exercising his right to freedom of expression. Mr. Orizov refused to change his Turkish name to a Bulgarian name, one of the forced assimilation procedures Bulgaria is employing on the country's ethnic Turkish minority. Mr. Fazzi is a union organizer and~known as a "Moderate." We believe he was banned in 1985 from union activities for expressing his beliefs against apartheid. His latest ar­rest was August 5 or 6, 1986. 

To help free these prisoners, Am­nesty International is sponsoring a Write-a-thon on December 7. You can either sponsor a letter writer by pledg­ing a certain amount of money for the letters he-She writes, or you yourseh can write letters, collecting pledges fm your writing. Whatever you choose to do is significant: your input could heir save these men's lives. Join us on Dec 7 at 7 p.m. at Theodore's. We will hav£ a guest speaker, music and refresh­ments to encourage your "crusade ot the pen." Following the letter writing will be a prayer session at the Grotto. The celebration will end at 10 p.m. 
Your basic freedoms are unchal­lenged in America. Others are fighting 
Garry Trudeau 
for theirs. Help Amnesty and remem­ber to "Write a letter, Save a life."

T
hey have been called 
"America's next great 
band." Rolling Stone terms 
them "one of the most original 
bands the heartland has to of­
fer." Newsweek reports that 
"The songs are stunning." 
SO WHO ARE THEY? 
They are The Rainmakers, and they hall from Kansas City, Mo. On their second and latest album, entitled Tornado, they are explosive. Live, they rock out. In case you didn't know, they will be returning to Notre Dame for a concert at Stepan Center at 9 tonight with special guests, The Insiders. Go, espe­cially If you're Into music with meaning behind lt. 
The flrst album released by the Rainmakers was self-titled and came out In 1986. It proved to be a refreshing change from most progressive rock records because every single song was strong and the lyrics were well thought out and meaningful. "Let My P~ople Go-Go" was the big single and helped the band get their name known In the music world. 
The Rainmakers' flrst album was widely talked about for Its prevalent cynicism. Lead singer Bob Walkenhorst has some remarks to make on that Issue. He says, "''m not really a cyni­cal person. A lot of the songs on Tornado deal with Identify­Ing It and flghting it." 
Tornado, the band's latest release, Is the second album and, arguably better. Walken­horst says, "We're making music with a little more deter­mination, a little more ur­gency." Those two words best describe this energetic four­some. They are determined and urgent about their music and It shows, both live and on vinyl.

On the Tornado album, the flrst single Is "Snakedance" In which Walkenhorst deals with the problem of belonging. He sings, "''m part man, part monkey. And the angels and the devils are playing tug-of­war with my personality." 
In other songs, the band sings about the many problems they have noticed In the world around them. One of the best songs on the album Is "No Romance." In this catchy tune, The Rainmakers tell us all to "get on with things that really matter. There Is no romance." Cynical, yes, but these songs don't try to force us to believe what the band members believe. Rather, they offer new perspectives to encourage new thinking in the listeners. This Is such a welcome change from bands that simply scream their lyrics out In order to get them across. The Rainmakers are certainly unique. 
As their press release states, the band is becoming known for its "compelling imagery, lyrical depth and musical ap­peal," both here In the States and also abroad, especially In England, where they hit the 
Top 20 in 1986. 
Along with Walkenhorst on lead vocals and guitar, Steve Phillips plays lead guitar and sings, Rich Ruth plays bass and sings, and Pat Tomek drums In back. In regard to the new Tor­nado album, Walkenhorst says, "The album talks about that larger view, the realization of what a wonderful world It Is, and what a dangerous place It Is ... the way a tornado strikes­It could go any minute." An Interesting perspective Indeed. 
Listen to their albums and watch their live shows, and you'll be hooked on the Rain­makers very soon.

Strange and Woosnam were the leading money winners this year on the U.S. and European tours, respectively, and Faldo won the British Open. All the non-South African entrants played in the Ryder Cup com­petition this year between top 
U.S. and European pros. 
The Million Dollar Challenge has been held annually since 1982, but in previous years the purse was divided among the 
players,  with the  first  prize  
ranging  from  $300,000  to  
$500,000.  

This year, Sun City owner Sol Kerzner decided to switch to a winner-take-all format. As an incentive for players who drop out of contention, he also is of­fering $50,000 prizes for the lowest round each day. 
Jack Nicklaus, Johnny Miller and Lee Trevino of the United 
But union counsel Dick Ber­thelsen said that in "the best of all possible worlds," players whose contracts end on that date could immediately begin negotiating with all NFL teams for a new contract, without having their old club liable to provide compensation. 
The union contends that the expiration of its basic contract with the owners nullified the agreement that had allowed the clubs to restrict players from switching teams. The agreement ran out before the start of the season, and no new one was reached during the strike. 
The NFL management Coun­cil agreed with the union's as­sessment that 
States, Greg Norman of Australia and Spain's Seve Bal­lesteros were among the super­stars to play in previous years. 
The new format was in­stituted after tournament director Sam Feldman conceded last year that it was becoming difficult to attract top stars because of political pressure. 
Faldo, asked if he had en­countered any pressure this year, replied. "I think that's old hat now." 
Langer, who won the $300,000 first prize in 1985, predicted an aggressive style of golf. 
"In this tournament it's no use being satisfied with second or third --you have to go for a win," he said. "Second is as bad as eighth, so there's no use holding back." · South Africa considers Bop­huthatswana independent, but it is not recognized abroad. 
likely to knock out compensation, but disagreed with the union's stand that the absence of a basic agreement might give it a chance. 
"Our attorneys believe that the court will find that manda­tory subjects of bargaining that have received union approval continue after the contract's expiration," Council spokes­man John Jones said. 
The motion is scheduled to be heard Dec. 30 in Minneapolis, where the union filed a federal antitrust suit after the players went back to work following the 24-day strike.

season, the loss being a tough 
84-83. to nationally-ranked Stan­
ford. The Cornhuskers bring a 
powerful scoring attack and a 
3-0 record into the Phoenix 
Classic. Nebraska is averaging 
97 points per game in victories 
over Oral Roberts, Texas 
A&M, and Missouri-Kansas 
City. 

"Both are excellent teams," 
said McGraw. "We'd like to 
play either one. 

"BYU is like us; they have a 
strong inside game. Nebraska 
has a strong perimeter game." 
The Irish have gotten out to 
quick starts in their games this 
season, jumping out in front 36­
13 against Loyola and 20-7 
against Northwestern. The 
early leads have keyed the 
team.'s success so far. 

"The leads build up our con­
fidence," McGraw said. "It's 
more fun to play the game 
when you're winning." 

The Irish will be looking at 
some tough competition in the 
Classic, but McGraw says the 
team is ready to perform when 
the pressure is on. 

"I think we'll be terrific un­
der pressure," she said. "The 
players know what we want 
them to do. We have great 
poise, and Mary Gavin is a 
great leader on the floor. 

"This is a veteran team, and 
I think we'll do well." 

So despite the fact that the 
Phoenix Classic will take place 
in the frozen city of Green Bay 
and not the sunny desert of 
Pheonix, the Irish are ready to 
heat up with the challenge of 
strong tournament competi­
tion.

NEW YORK--Eighth-seeded Brad Gilbert upset No.4 Jimmy Connors 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) in the opening round of the $500,000 Masters tennis championship Wednesday night. 
Gilbert, who lost to Connors in the U.S. open quarterfinals, avenged the defeat in an error­filled match at Madison Square Garden. 
"It was a tough two-setter," said Gilbert, who had lost five of six previous matches to Con­nors. "With Jimmy against you on your serve, he makes you work really hard." 
Gilbert and Connors are the only Americans in the Masters, a round-robin tournament featuring the top eight players in the world. Each competitor plays three matches to deter­mine who advances to Sun­day's semifinals. _ 
In an earlier match, second­seeded Stefan Edberg of Sweden defeated No. 7 Pat Cash of Australia 6-4, 4-6, 6-1. 
The match was a replay of the Australian Open final in January, which Edberg won in five sets. Cash, the 1987 Wimbledon champion, beat Edberg in their only other meeting of the year, at the Queen's tournament in En­gland. 
Edberg took command in the final set when Cash double­faulted to lose the fourth game. 

Edberg broke Cash again in the sixth game to take a 5-1 lead and then held serve to win the match, closing it out with a backhand pass down the line. 
"I started working very hard and he was missing a lot of first serves," Edberg said of the final set. "I took advantage of his second serve and got the break at 3-1." 
Edberg, who rarely shows emotion on the court, shouted a profanity after hitting a wide volley to lose the opening game of the second set. 
"I should have been more careful," he said. "After I won the first set, I relaxed a little bit and so I lost the second set. I have to concentrate better all the time." 
The 21-year-old Swede said the victory was important be­cause "I was ill two weeks ago and I haven't played competi­tive tennis in three weeks." 
The first two sets between the serve-and-volleyers were tightly played, with only one service break in each. 
Cash had two break points in the ninth game of the first set, but Edberg fought back to win the game and take a 5-4 lead. Edberg then broke Cash in the final game to win the set.

Notre Dame Head Coach Lou Holtz (Jacket and cap) confers with Tim Brown and Kent Graham earlier this year. Holtz will be spending less time 

Irish swimmers to host first-ever National Catholic Invite this weekend 
coaching and more time recruiting now that the regular season Is over. Marty Strasen has the story on the back page. 

By GREG GUFFEY Sports Writer 
History is taking place at Rolf's Aquatic Center. 
The men's and women's swimming teams host the first­ever National Catholic Invita­tional of Swimming and Diving today through Saturday. Trials start at 10:30 a.m. each mor­ning with finals at 7 p.m. 
This will be the first organ­ized Catholic meet, featuring teams from Boston College to San Diego. Fourteen teams are competing in the men's divi­sion, while 16 squads comprise the women's group. Both Irish squads hold identical 2-1 records going into the meet. 
"The National Catholic promises to showcase some of the better swimmers in the na­tion," said Irish coach Tim Welsh, who guides both teams. "I expect that every one of our pool records will be broken and with the caliber of the teams coming in here, it is definitely possible. I hope that not only will we see some spectacular times, but that the meet will be regarded as abuilding meet for teams in the fall." 
The top hopes for Notre Dame's men's squad wil be freestylist Mike Messaglia and Ed Veome on the boards, while the women will count on Amy Darlington in the freestyle and butterfly and Andrea Bonny in diving to pace the attack. 
Welsh sees the meet as balanced on both sides with all teams having a chance to fare well. 
"The quality of the meet will, 
. in the end, show in the results," Welsh says. "The difference in the training programs, the size of the schools, and the speeds will balance the event and give a chance for the faster schools to be fast and for the other schools to test ability, depth, and talent."

I H hockey to begin 
By FRANK PASTOR Sports Writer 
It's winter again. The skates 
are being sharpened and the 
Zambonis are waiting in the 
wings. The Interhall hockey 
season is upon us. 
If its 3-2 victory over Off­Campus Tuesday night is any indication, Grace will most cer­tainly be the team to beat this season in Interhall hockey's Gold division. The defending champions simply play good, fundamental hockey, and they do it better than anyone else in their division. The team is paced by standout goalie Gary Davis, defenseman Steve Bis­hop, and center Eric Galis. Once again, Grace possesses a plethora of good skaters who are adept at exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents. 
"(The Grace squad) is the 
strongest Interhall team I've 
seen," remarked an impressed 
Chris Brown following his Off­
Campus squad's loss to the pe­
rennial power. If this is true, 
then Brown's own squad cannot 
be far behind. Also an interhall 
finalist last season, Off­
Campus boasts a solid team all 
the way around. 
Brown blames the loss to Grace on disorganization in his own ranks as well as a problem with NVA regulations involv­ing the eligibility of players. Evidently, two Off-Campus players were declared in­eligible because they had earned varsity letters prior to joining the team, while another was lost as a result of his status as a temporary student. Brown referred to these losses as a "monkey wrench" in forming his lines for the season. 
Dillon, behind the play of Tyler Norene, Marty Hall, Mark Thesing, and Tim O'Loughlin, is also expected to put a good team on the ice. Ac­cording to captain Tom Tracy, the Big Red will be giving Grace and Off-Campus "a run for the playoffs".

fourth-place finish of a year ago. 
Keenan, Morrissey,and St. Edward'sHoly Cross will also be competitive. 
The Blue division does not ap­pear to be dominated by any single team. However, Alumni, Stanford, and Cavanaugh are preseason favorites for the title. 
On the surface, Alumni would seem to be in the midst of a rebuilding year after losing six starters to graduation. However, captain Mike Brach asserts that his freshman class has "filled in the slots" more than adequately. Mike Flynn, who scored two goals in the team's 4-1 defeat of Pangborn Tuesday night, Pat Hogan, and Steve Vairo provide the offen­sive firepower. Dave McDonald (one goal) and Mike Bailey have picked up the slack defensively. 
Brach contributes his posi­tive outlook to three factors: the abundance of players who came out this season, three solid lines, and the superb play of his goaltender, Rich Knauf. 
Stanford, which boasts a number <1f good freshman and sophomore players, defeated Fisher 6-0 Monday evening. With the help of goalie Hardie Tankelsen, the Studs will most likely improve upon last season's 3-3 mark. 
Sorin, more organized than in previous years, should climb to respectability on the strength of its two solid lines and the return of center Phil Marin, who was declared in­eligible for the second half of last season. 
The Cavemen of Cavanaugh, who almost always put to­gether a respectable team, will make no exception this year. According to managers of other teams in the division, Cavanaugh will definitely be a squad to reckon with this year. 
Zahm, Pangborn, and Fisher round out the Blue division, but it looks as though there won't be many walkovers because the talent seems to be evenly distibuted among the remain­ing teams. .

Wrestlers to meet nation's best at Las Vegas Invitational 
By STEVE MEGARGEE 
Sports Writer 
No, the Notre Dame wres­tling team is not making a trip to the NCAA championships four months early. 
But judging from the compe­tition the Irish face in this weekend's Las Vegas Invita­tional, it's easy to see how one might make that mistake. 
Notre Dame will compete in this Western tournament all day arid into the night on Friday and Saturday, along with about 45 or 50 other teams. 
"It's a marathon," said Irish coach Fran McCann. "It's big­ger than the NCAA's as far as numbers go. Looking at the rankings, about 10 of the top 20 teams will be there." 
All the Western powers, like Arizona State, will be in Las Vegas. Other schools making the trip to Nevada include pe­rennial national powers Okla­homa, Oklahoma State and defending national champion Iowa State. 
These schools are all return­ing from last year's Invite, in 
Gamecock tackle seeks revenge 
Associated Press 

COLUMBIA, S.C. --South Carolina senior offensive tackle David Poinsett missed last season's game against Miami with an ankle injury. 
But he has not forgetten the kidding he took from Miami linebacker George Mira after the Hurricanes' 34-14 victory. Poinsett knows Mira from a se­ries of high school all-star games in Florida. 
"George came up to me and started giving me a little bit of a hard time," said Poinsett. "It was all in fun, but I said I'd see him next year." 
Next year has arrived. 

The No. 8 Gamecocks, 8-2, travel to Miami to face the second-ranked Hurricanes, 10­0, in the regular-season finale for both bowl-bound teams Sat­urday. 
Miami needs to win to set up a championship showdown in the Orange Bowl against No. 1 Oklahoma. But the Gamecocks, who have won six straight games and have lost only to fifth-ranked Nebraska and No. 14 Georgia, would like 
.. nothing more than to upset Miami's plans. 
"I think everybody's flirting with the idea that if we beat Miami we are going to screw the bowl game situation up (and) the ranking situation," Poinsett said. "Everybody's having a little fun toying with that idea, saying who's No. 1 and all that stuff. 
"But I think what basically we're looking at is that they came up here last year and just short of embarrassed us," the 6-foot-5, 283-pound lineman said. 
While the Hurricanes have no South Carolina natives on their team, the Gamecocks have nine players from Florida, al­though none is from Miami. Poinsett grew up about 30 minutes from the Orange Bowl and was recruited by Miami when Harold Schnellenberger was head coach. 
"I thought about playing for which the Irish placed twelfth. One new guest should make this year's competition all the more imposing. The University of Iowa, the national champion from 1978 to 1986, plans to make this year's Las Vegas Invita­tional more interesting than ever. 

"I think it will be about as competitive as last year with the exception of Iowa," said McCann. "That will make it a lot tougher." 
But McCann is still confident that Notre Dame can improve on last year's finish, and that the Irish can have sev.eral wrestlers place among the top eight in individual weight classes. 
"Our goal is to finish in the top 10," said McCann. "I think they're excited. I think we legitimately have got five or six people who can finish in the top eight." 
Notre Dame wrestlers finish­ing in the top eight last year included 167-pound junior Chris Geneser (fourth), 134-pound junior Jerry Durso (fifth), and 142-pound junior Pat Boyd (seventh). 
Miami," Poinsett said, "but it They're on the cocky side of was too close to home." confident." 
Poinsett knows many of the Miami players. He played Poinsett and the Gamecocks against several in high school, are, if not cocky, at least con­including split end Brian fident and believe they can beat Blades and defensive back Miami, which has not lost to Bennie Blades and tight end the Gamecocks since 1947.

"I have no regrets about not The Hurricanes have one of playing for Miami," he said. the nation's top defenses. "I'm happy for them. They Miami is third in scoring
have a good ballclub, but defense and sixth in total they're notoriously cocksure. defense. 
Boyd will not get a chance to improve on the seventh-place finish this year, as both he and freshman heavyweight Jeff Massey will miss the Invita­tional with injured knees. 
"The injuries don't seem to be too bad," said McCann. "They'll be back hopefully by Christmas. Massey may be ready by next week. 
Junior Ron Wisniewski will replace Boyd at the 142-pound division, and the Irish will not send a heavyweight. 

McCann hopes that the Invite can work as well as the St. Louis Open, held two weeks ago, in giving the Irish compe­tition with the best in the · country before the dual meets and NCAA qualifiers. 
"That's why we go to some­thing like this," said McCann. "We want to see what the great schools have and how we com­pete with them .. 
"St. Louis was a big confidence-builder. We did well against some of the best schools in the nation, and this is another chance to do that.''
