VATICAN CITY [AP] -Pope John Paul II promised Tuesday that a "ministry of love" would mark his reign as the 264th pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church. 
He said, "We would like to reach out our hands and open our hearts in this moment, to all people and to those who are oppressed by what­ever injustices or discrimination · whether it has to do with economy, life in society, political life or the freedom of conscience and just reliuious freedom. We must reach ouc~!th all means to them, that all forms of injustice manifest in our times be rejected by public opinion." 
In his televised sermon delivered under Michelangelo's fresco "The Last Judgment" in the ·sistine Chapel, the pope pledged to carry on the church reforms launched by the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65 and to follow the guide­lines laid down by Paul VI and John Paul I. 
The former Cardinal Karol W ojtyla of Krakow, Poland, also took a trip outside Vatican walls on his first full day as leader of the world's 700 million Catholics · to visit a "very dear friend" who had suffered a heart attack. 
Vatican officials, meanwhile, an­nounced -that John Paul would preside at a Mass at his installation on Sunday. The announcement made no mention of a coronation, implying that he would continue the pattern of John Paul I, who refused to be crowned the tempor~l ruler of the church.

I. 
ist leader Edward Gierek sent a message to the pope, saying that his election ''fills Poland with great satisfaction" and that he was "convinced that further develop­ment of relations between Poland and the Apostolic See" would come about. 
A polish government spokes­man, Kazimierz Kakol, said that passport restricitons would be eased to allow a "large number" of Poles to travel to Rome for the installation. He did not say how many visas would be granted. Poles normally have to wait three to four weeks to obtain a travel visa. 
In his first papal sermon that was televised live in Poland, the 58­year-old pontiff warned that the

Nurses protest new drink 
RICHMOND Va. [AP)-The beer manufacturer calls its new product a "not-so-soft drink" but a nurses' group wants it boycotted, saying it could help soda-sipping children grow into beer-guzzling adults. An amber blend of lemon, ginger and apple flavoring in a malt-flavored base, "Chelsea" is being test-marketed by Anheuser­Busch in six markets, including Richmond and Staunton, Va. The 3,000-member Virginia Nurses Association, is worried because it contains about one-half of one percent alcohol and is packaged to look like premium beer. Barbara Bolton, executive director of the association, said yesterday that the nurses' group fears that drinking Chelsea will "condttion" children to consuming beer and other, stronger alcoholic beverages when they grow older. 
Reading Joyce beats togas 
AMHERST, Mass. [AP)-An around-the-clock public recitation of James Joyce's mysses ended last night with a two-person reading of the book's final, 40-page sentence which ends, " ... Yes I will Yes." Fifty-one students and 11 faculty members -10 from Amherst, one from Smith College in nearby Northampton ­completed their adventure in reading the classic novel aloud in 28 hours and 40 minutes. The reading started at 8 a.m. Monday, with most readers taking half-hour turns. "It's better than a toga party,'' one of the organizers said, referring to wild celebrations popularized by "Animal House," a film spoof of fraternity life. 
Two attempt snake murder 
WS ANGELES [AP)-Two men affiliated with the Synanon Foundation were charged Tuesday with conspiracy to commit murder in connection with a rattlesnake attack on an attorney who had won a $300',000 judgment against Synanon. A Deputy District Attorney John Watson said the attack involved revenge. Joseph Musico, 28, and Lance Kenton, 20, son of bandleader Stan Kenton, were also charged with assault with a deadly weapon. A 41/l-foot rattlesnake was placed in attorney Paul Morantz' mail box on Oct. 
10. Morantz was bitten by the rattlesnake, whose rattles had been removed apparently to keep it from being detected.

Dowty interviewed 

Summit represents step 1n right direction 
by Gregory Solman 
"The Camp David Summit should not be viewed as the beginning ofthe end of this historic conflict," commented Alan K. Dowty, professor of government and international studes. "It does represent, however, a step in the right direction in the Middle East.'' 
Though Dowty would prefer to downplay his expertise on the Middle East, one need only enter his office to realize that his perspective on Mideast problems is far from being unjvolved-
On the walls are Hebrew-cap­tioned caricatures of Israeli lead­ers, clipped from a Jerusalem newspaper. The bookshelves are lined with texts on foreign policy and Middle East topics, among them one which he has written himself. 
But his office only hints at his experience. Dowty taught at Hebrew University for seven years, serving as chairman of the depart­ment of international relations. He also worked on the planning branch of the Israel General Staff, as a member of the Governing Commit­tee. . 

Just last June, Dowty traveled as a member of a select group of American educators to Egypt, Sy­ria. Jordan. and Israel, where he sought opinions on options for peace in the Mideast conflict. 
''I recall that in Egypt, there was a strong urge to be done with the entire thing," Dowty recollected. "So in that respect, I'm not totally surprised with what has eventua­ted. But that is not to say that I expected Israel and Egypt to go on to a separate peace." 
Dowty thought that some sort of breakthrough seemed to be a logical consequence of the Sadat initiative. However, he didn't foresee it going as far as it has. 
He credited the Israeli side for "input", also. But that was not unexpected, he said, considering the tremendous advantage a sepa­rate peace with Egypt gives Israel in terms of removing the most critical military threat to them. 
"To a great extent, it has turned out that the issues could not be resolved in terms of right and wrong," he remarked. This agree­ment may never have happened, had both parties remained preoc­cupied on the issues at that level." 
When visiting Syria, Dowty ob­served this to be a major problem, and made the Syrians' reaction to Camp David predictable, "They are not yet thinking along prag­matic lines,'' Dowty said. ''They are still primarily concerned with rights and justice and other related issues." 
Dowty does not foresee any major "stumbling blocks" between the separate Egyptian/Israeli peace, though he stressed that further "linkage" of the separate peace .and general issues could 
cause problems, and that the Saudi Arabians could also pose a prob­lem. 
"The Saudis want to see more 
general issues put into the frame­
work of the agreement," Dowty 
explained. ''As it now is for them, 
the agreement does not solve the 
problem of certain fundamental key 
issues. However, the general 
framework does close the gap and 
give all of the parties a base from 
which to work." -Dowty indicated that Jordan has 
no inclination toward accepting the 
pact without the cooperation of 
other parties involved, particularly 
Syria. 
"Jordan is in a weak position," 
Dowty asserted, "Hussein has 
been isolated in the Arab world, 
and has only recently developed 
good relations with the Syrians. He 
does not want to endanger this relationship.'' 
''He will not commit himself 
until the dust settles. At this point, 
he hasn't closed any doors, and he 
hasn't stuck his neck out, either," 
Dowty continued. 
Dowty gave President Jimmy 
Carter credit for the Camp David 
Summit :md said, "There was 
certainly some skill involved in how 
he handled it." 
"I was worried at first," admit-' 
ted Dowty. "Carter surprised me 
in handling it so well. It was done 
seriously, with no press present, no 
klieg light<: blaring...all of the 
conditions were. present to make 
what happened possible." 
"He played his role in the 
agreement skillfully," he conclu­ded. "He may have exaggerated his accomplishments, but I forgive him. I think it's about time that he had a few things going his way." 
Senator Birch Bayh lectures club on ERA 
by Mary Beth Andrasak Senator Birch Bayh (R-IN) addressed the South Bend Busi­ness and Professional Women's Club last night on the issues surrounding the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). The main concerns of Bayh's speech were both the topics of the rescission of state ratification and the time extention of the ERA. Bayh argued that never before in the history ofthe nation was there a time limit placed on the ratification of an amendment. "The pursuit of full· equality and justice for the women of America," he added, would be hindered if a time limit were placed on the ratification of the ERA. "Congress responded in the only responsible way it could" in extending the ERA ratification

deadline to June 30, 1982, he said. 
Bayh blamed opposition to the extention of the ERA on a "fear that extention will allow the truth to percolate through the big lies" that penetrate the ERA issue. The Hoosier Senator reported that the ERA proponents have their work cut out for them as a result of "those who cleverly and effectively misrepresent the issue to the point where I don't recognize it." 
"Some ERA advocates are the amendment's worst enemies," Bayh said. "They should provide for their followers the opportunity to choose" actions rather than demand that they be followed out of the homes into the job market. He recognized the importance of the "housewife's" occupation and

Badin hopes: 
Underprivileged may attend Irish game 
by 
LesUe Brinkley 
Thirty-one underprivileged stu­dents from the Sacred Heart School on Chicago's south side, will have the opportunity to attend the Tennessee game on Nov. 11, if the women of Badin Hall have their wav. _ . . 
Badin hopes to obtain blocks of seats in the stadium for the students by asking groups of University students to break up and switch seats. 
Depending on student ticket 
donations, the Badin committee 
wants to gather most of their goal ­
forty tickets -before October break, 
although they will still accept 
donations up until Nov. 11. Ellen

Saint Mary's hopes to have four to 
six speakers this year. A com­
mittee is now in the process of 
contacting possible guests. 
On November 12, the series 
begins with Pat Paulson. Other 
tentative dates for speakers are 
scheduled for the third week in 
January and the second week in 
February. The presentations will 
be held in O'Laughlin Auditorium. 
Because it is a new idea, the 
series will begin gradually this 
year. Ptacin said she "hopes it will

Dornev predicted that Notre Dame students will find "a lot of these kids are more worldly or streetwise, in a sense, than they may imagine. It will give us a chance to take a step back and look at what we've been blessed with and will give them a vision for the

Marty reflects: 
'The Dream on Main Street' 
by Mary Ann Wissel Staff Reporter 
"No longer is Main Street tradi­tionally the street in downtown as it was in the 1920's. Instead, the Main Streets of our hometowns are the spurs, airport strips and state highways where America pledges allegiance to the flag of McDonald's," according to Prof. 
Mike Marty. 
Marty, a history professor at Florissant Valley Community Col­lege, MO. discussed "The Dream on Main Street" yesterday before an audience of approximately 45 students and faculty in Room 117 Haggar Hall. 
In his lecture, sponsored by the American Studies department,

Marty described the American I 
Dream as one ''with variations. It 
is the dream of the American 
people collectively and on by one. 
It is at times fantasy, illusion and 
myth, but it sustains, encourages 
and builds." 
This American Dream is found in 
Americans of the past, Marty 
continued. "Samuel Gompers was 
speaking for more than just the 
members of his union when he 
described their goal in just one 
word: 'more'," Marty said. Marty 
appled Gompers' idea to modern 
America, contending that "more" 
is the essential ingredient in the 
dream of Main Street Americans 
today. 
He claimed that the automobile 
offers the "way to 'more'" since 
today's Main Street emphasizes 
physical mobility. Its establish­
ments represent extensions of the 
automobile which allows Ameri­
cans "to defy what we might call 
one-placeness," Marty said. 
Marty also referred to the nega­
tive side of "more" which does not 
necessarily represent the American 
Dream. This aspect of predictabil­
ity and sameness, reflected in Main 
Street restaurants, "are a product, 
of course, of something called 
'quality control'," he noted. 
Marty voiced other complaints 
against such restaurants, stressing 
their waste of food. McDonald's 
discards hamburgers if they are not 
purchased within ten minutes, he 
said. 
The fast-food chains also drain 
natural resources, according to 
Marty. "Bringing the figures that 
were generated six or seven years 
ago into line with McDonald's 
current size and sales volume would suggest that it takes the sustained yield of more than 600 square miles of forest to keep McDonald's supplied with paper packaging for one year," he said. "Franchise restaurants repre­sent a part of the ongoingness of American life. They are significant for what they tell us about contem­porary society: that it values mobility and quality and that its pace and its changing family and occupational structures call for fast, predictable food service," Marty said. According to Marty, Americans are unwilling to improve their society through public expendi­tures because "we prefer private indulgence." He cited Andrew Hacker, a writer who speculated on America's future, who argued that, as private lives get better and better, public lives get worse and worse. Marty asked, "Where is tech­nology taking us? Does the food technology on Main Street hurry us along in getting there? H Main 
Street does nothing else, it reminds us of the demands for "more," while showing that careful plan­ning--it is quite a ways down the road." 
In conclusion, Marty stated that "technology can be both a destruc­tive and a constructive force. As we face trasformations, the men and women who know this will be called upon for counsel and leader­ship, and we should not hesitate to give it. Putting to work what we know and believe can make a difference."

U.S.· Senator Robert Dole campaigns for Thorson 
by Kevin Richardson Senior Staff Reporter 
U.S. Senator Robert Dole (R-Kansas) was in South Bend yesterday to keynote a luncheon fundraiser for third District Repub­lican congressional nominee Thomas L. Thorson. The former GOP Vice-Presidential candidate is one of many prominent Republi­cans who have come to the Third District to campaign for Thorson. 
In his speech to approximately 250 people, Dole outlined "the tremendous opportunity Republi­cans have in 1978 to offer the voters attractive alternatives to the same old policies which have ushered in our current national problems.'' 
Concentrating on economic issues, Dole emphasized what he termed "the end of the era where politicians can buy political power with taxpayer's dollars." He cited that combined problems of taxes and inflation as the cornerstone of "the Republican comeback." 
''The American people under­stand that what makes it difficult for them to balance their budgets is the fact that the government re­fuses to balance its own. Every­time the cost ofliving goes up by 10 percent, government revenues go up 16 percent. As it stands now, there's no incentive for govern­ment to stem inflation because government is benefitting from
inflation,'' Dole said. 
~ 
Dole stated that it is important
~for Republicans to provide work­[ able answers to the problems the J nation faces today. "We must do \ more than just call the Democratsi 'bad guys' and tell the voters we're ~ available. We must present solid 
I programs to the public," Dole said. 
· He cited income tax indexing for ~ inflation as an example of a positive I program." j Also included in Dole's remarks 
!~~!ald~~~ne~san~ra :ov:~~;:~ 
scrutinizing of the Strategic Arms 
Limitation Treaty which will be 
submitted to the Senate next year. 
In closing his remarks, Dole 
talked of the need for Republicans 
to organize across the country "for 
the preservation of the two-party 
system." He said that Indiana's 
Third Congressional District race 
provides the opportunity for Re­
publicans to show "what we can do 
for the people and not just what the 
Democrats have done to the 
people." 
Local political observers consider 
the Dole visit a boost to the 
Thorson campaign. "It reflects the 
belief by the national Republican 
party leaders of the 'win-ability' of 
this congressional seat," Brent 
Bahler, Thorson's campaign man­
ager said. 
School counselors to attend college workshop 
Secondary school counselors in 
Northern Indiana will attend a 
college entrance workshop in the 
CCE tomorrow. Sessions will 
include an update on current 
precedural information related to 
admissions testing, credit by exam­
mination and financial aid, both 
state and federal. 
One of nine workshops sche­
duled in the state, the program is 
sponsored by the Midwest Office of 
the College Board in cooperation 
with the Indiana Student Financial 
Aid Association and the State 
Student Assistance Commission of 
Indiana. Joseph Russo, director of 
financial aid at Notre dame, is

Crew: 
Early hours, hard work and a good view 
Ask anyone what they know about the Notre Dame Crew and the answer you will receive will probably be something like, "Oh, don't they get up at five o'clock in the morning and go down to the St. Joe's?" While it is true that oarsmen do sometimes suffer from chronic cases on insomnia, to ignore the panoramic beauty of the river and the diligent work intrinsic to crew would be a mistake. 
Rowing is a team sport of the highest order. Each person is part of a boat, striving to move as a single entity. It is a sport which requires an enormous amount of dedication and work. One must enjoy rowing to do it, in the words of the immortal Mike Meenan, "I row because it's fun and if it stops being fun, I'll quit." 
Notre Dame Crew was founded in 1964 by an industrious group of Notre Dame students, who without any previous exper­ience on the water, hitchhiked to a race and rowed. Later, the crew became situated at its present location at the Mishawaka Marina. Women's crew was established in 1973, founded by Frank "Oete" Graham. For a newly organized crew, the women's crew reached national recognition by winning the Midwest Sprints in 1973 and 1974 and be placing second in the Eastern Sprints in 1974. 
The schedule of a typical oarsman is rigorous. A day in his life begins at 5:30 
a.m. when the bus leaves Stepan Center for the Marina 10 miles away. Once there, the team must carry the boats to the water occasionally "into" the water. Practice time is usually limited to an hour and a half at best, as the schedules of team members require them to be back in time for class. Besides workouts in the mornings, crew members must lift weights and run an average of three miles a day (hmmm.). Participation in crew is often to the exclusion of many other activities -most notably sleep. 
Hoth men·s and women's crew row eight and four man shells. Although they compete separately, the crew is a single club. Both field varsity and novice rowing teams. Mike Meenan, a four year veteran, is presently coaching the men's varsity and Mike "Sundance" Miller is at the helm of the men's novice. Jody Gormley, who rowed four years with the women's crew, now is in her second year of coaching. 
The major problem that faces the crew is the lack of funds to buy badly needed new shells. At Notre Dame, the club sports are alloted approximately 1200 dollars per yaer from the Athletic fund to maintain their sport. For some sports, where little more than uniforms and equipment are needed, this is often more than adequate. However, the crew must purchase all of its equipment from select boat manufacturers, spending up to 7000 dollars for every eight man shell. This makes the club sonsider­ably dependent on alumni support. Most of the boats have been donated by funds from these ~umni or the parents of the oarsmen. 
Crew competes during both the fall and spring semesters. In the autumn, the novices race against the perennial rivals of Purdue or Michigan. This year's first home meet saw the novice men and women soundly defeat their Michigan counter­parts. The varsity too defeated their respective rivals by a considerable distance of open water -crew terminology for a smear. 
The climax of the fall season is an international racing regatta, the Head of the Charles, in Boston. This is the fourteenth Annual H~d and is the largest single day regatta in the world. Held on October 22, the race is a gruelling test of strength and endurance. It attracts top teams and inidvidual competitors from colleges, universities, and clubs from across the United States and Canada. 
This year the Irish are sending an elite varsity men's eight and a mixed eight consisting of four men and four women. Rowing in the elite eight are Captain Robbie Wettach, Paul Devitt, Mark Davis, Kurt Weber, Carl La France, Chris Lyons, Sundance, Dick O'Malley, and coxswain Bill MacKay. This year, the Regatta will inaugurate the first "mixed eight" race of international competition. This race will feature 40 eight oared shells. Regatta sponsors, The Cambridge Boat Oub, hope that this rowing "first" will prove to be both highly competitive and great fun. Rowing in the mixed eight are Mike Hammerly, Bob Flynn, Laura Rohrbach, Marty Murphy, Jay Ferrerra, Ginny Ott, Kathy Dilworth (women's captain), Mickey McGowan, and coxswain Terri Hinz. 
The spring season is longer consisting of small meets and participation in the larger regattas such as the Midwest Sprints, Eastern Sprints, Dad Vails, Mariettas, and the Miami Internatkmal Invitational. Last year the Notre Dame Rowing Oub traveled hundreds of miles for an extremely varied racing schedule . 
. The season culminates with the annual award ceremony; recalling the most mem­orable moments of the season -best oarsman, best style, did you, did you, and the most improved award. Thus, crew parties are a breed unto themselves whether they be after a major regatta or at home in South Bend. For crew is more than a sport -it is a way of life. The pursuit of indivi~ual recognition is secondary to the combined team effort.

The Notre Dame chapter of Amnesty International (AI) is spon­soring a series of lectures as part of the International Prisoner of Con­science Week, scheduled Oct. 15-22. 
Mike Guay, University media information officer, said that the purpose of Prisoner of Cons~ience Week is to raise the community's. awareness that torture is a common practice in twentieth century civil­ized countries. 
Mark Hommes, president of Notre Dame's AI chapter, noted that, aside from informing the public about political prisoners, the groups sponsor letter-writing campaigns to make influencial people in other nations aware that an injustice has been committed in their country. 
According to Guay, no chapter works for reform\ within its own

Lanzingerpresents lecture 
by Brian McFeeters 
Professor Klaus Lanzinger presented an informal lecture about Austria's "Unique position in the world" in honor of the Austrian national holiday yesterday afternoon in the Memorial Library. 
.. A native Austrian, Lanzinger expressed his pleasure at the observance of this holiday at Notre Dame and St. Mary's. "Austrians today have many reasons to be happy,'' he said, and added that they would be glad to know some Americans are celebrating also. The holiday celebrates the State Treaty, a treaty signed by the United States, France, England, and Russia in 1955, which declared Austria neutral. 
Lanzinger stressed the unique position of Austria in Europe, both for its neutrality and its location. Austria's neutrality is valuable to the West since it serves as a "wedge" in the communist bloc of nations. But it is also helpful to the communists, Lanzinger pointed out, because, together with Swit­zerland, Austria divides the NATO countries into northern and south­ern portions. 
Today Austria is a member of numerous international organiza­tions and will soon open a United Nations complex in Vienna. The country is secure in its parlimen­tary form of government, Lao­zinger stated, and has made "im­portant contributions to ease and improve relations between East Klaus Lanzinger, professor of modern languages.

Women's club hears Bayh 
[continued from page 3] suggested it be legally recognized. Bayh declared that after seven years, the ERA is "still impor­tant.'' He cited such reasons as the "pay discrepancies" that still exist between male and female peers; that ''blacks now live under a higher legal standard than women"; and that despite separate legal victories "discrimination against the female has not yet been ruled illegal by the courts." "The dual standards applied to some laws have got to end," Bayh said in discussing pay, prostitution, 
homosexuality,  and  employment  
opportunities  with  the  female  
Hoosier audience.  

On the rescission of ratification attempted by several states, Bayh commented that "rescissions have never before been permitted or counted" in constitutional history. Therefore "no precedent has been set," he said. "We can't send a message to the legislature to let them think they can play with the rescission issue." 
Bayh warned the audience that "if ratification doesn't pass con­gressional and legislative action on it will regress because Congress will believe it isn't all that impor­tant" to the people. He uri' ... continued support of the ERA. He also applauded the women's organ­izations, such as the one he addressed, for their supportive and powerful influence in the move-Senator Birch Bayh, U.S. Senator of Ind.

Group desires better relations 

by Cathy Santoro 
"It's up to us to make the new international students feel at home at Notre Dame," Beth Kline, president of the International Students' Organization at Notre Dame, stated. 
"We hope to open new channels of international communication by destroying the myths and stereo­types people hold concerning dif­ferent cultures,'' she added. 
The organization is comprised of 400 students form 68 different countries. American students also can be mem\>ers. The club is open to undergraduate and graduate students from any country who want to share their cultures with others at Notre Dame. 
Club members have the oppor­tunity to share their cultures during the One Earth Week which is sponsored by the organization. These five days include lectures by visiting ambassadors and films on different countries, culminating in 
DOONESBURY 

the International Festival. At this 
event, students perform their 
native songs and dances before an 
audience in Washington Hall. 
In conjunction with the One Earth theme, the students will organize an international market­place to sell handmade crafts and jewelry. The market will be set up in the Rathskellar of the LaFortune Student Center during the week of Nov. 13-17. 
The club also hosts a coffee hour 
on Wednesdays from 11 a.m. to 1 
p.m. in the club's loungc!Students' Lounge, located in the basement of LaFortune. The coffee hour is another attempt to promote greater friendship between people from all over the world and students from Notre Dame, according tu Kline. 
Elected president of the organi­zation last April, Kline stressed that adjusting to a new culture and overcoming the language barrier is difficult. "International students are here to meet Americans and learn their way of life," she said,

but "it's often too easy to form 
ethnic cliques and avoid speaking 
English." 
The organization is faced with 
the task of electing a new director 
this year since the death of Fr. 
Daniel J. O'Neil who served as the 
Foreign Students' Advisor last 
year. Kline said that it will be 
difficult to replace O'Neil. "He 
really cared about the international 
students and what happens to them 
at Notre Dame," she said. 
The Foreign Students' Advisor is in charge of the 400 club members and handles their housing and visa problems. Mrs. Betty Fitterling, O'Neil's secretary is serving as the acting director of the organization until a new advisor is elected in the spring. 
The membership of the Interna­tional Students Organization has increased annually. Kline sug­gested that one reason why an increasing number of foreign stu­dents are studying so far from home is the good reputation that Notre Dame has abroad.

LOS ANGELES [API  On a team 
hat has assembled some of base­fball's most awesome sluggers, it twas a pair of slap hitters -Bucky Dent and Brian Doyle -who supplied the big hits that propelled 
he New York Yankees to a 7-2 victory over Los Angeles and their 22nd World Championship Tues­day night. 
With Reggie Jackson adding a monstrous home run to punctuate )'!ew York's six-game World Series conquest of the Dodgers, the Yankees destroyed Los Angeles with two popguns and a cannon. 
Dent, the Series' Most Valuable Player, and Doyle, the rookie stand-in who spent much of the season in the minors, occupied the last two places in the Yankees batting order. 
But they both looked like cleanup hitters to the Dodgers, combining for six hits and five runs batted in. 
"I like to hit ninth," said Dent. "Where else am I gonna hit on this team?" 
Actually, Dent claims living at the bottom of the batting order makes his job at the plate easier. 
"By the time they get to the eighth and ninth places in this batting order, they go 'whew' and relax a little bit," said the Yankees shortstop. "It's a lot easier to hit down there. I really believe that." 
Dent was an integral ingredient in the· Yankees' comback this season -one of the most remark­able recoverjes in baseball history. Doyle, on the ·other hand, was on a New York-to-Tacoma shuttle for most of the year and had only ro hits in 52 scattered at-bats with the Yankees when he was thrust into the middle of the infield in October after an injury to second baseman Willie Randolph. 
He responded with a remarkable playoff and even better World Series, supplying some standout defense and showing a lively bat. 
Asked if he felt any pressure because of the situation he was stepping into, Doyle laughed.

Dent. 
The Dodgers noticed. 
Dent and Doyle kept coming up with clutch hits in Game 6 and helped build a 5-2 lead for Catfish Hunter. The Jackson jolted his second tape measure home of the Series, deep into the Yankees bullpen in right field. 
Hunter lasted until the eighth inning, when he surrendered a leadoff double to Joe Ferguson. Then Yankees ace Rich Gossage came out of the bullpen and hurled tow inning of one-hit relief to nail down the victory and the World Championship that the slap hitters had constructed.
