Hurricane devastates Dominica 
BRIDGETOWN* Barbados (AP) -Hurricaine David devastated the tiny island of Dominica, killing at least seven people and l~veling virtually all the houses in the capital, Roseau, Prime Minister Oliver Seraphin said Thursday. 
''There are very few roofs remaining and very few build­inss standing'' in Roseau_.; he satd, and predicted the death toll would go "much higher" in "the worst disaster we have had in living memory.'' 
One death was attributed to the storm in Puerto Rico. Police said Narcelo Perez Acevedo, 68, was killed at his coast home when he was pinned under a tree by high winds. 
The storm, one of the most dangerous of the century, flat­tened vital banana crops on Dominica and the neighboring islands of Martinique andGuad­eloupe on Wednesday; then headed northwest Thursday towards the southern coasts of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola island, shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Authorities said the hurricaine center was passing 100 miles south of Puerto Rico and His­paniola late Thursday, but eval­uated low-lying coastal areas as a precaution. 
Forecasters warned that hurri­caines often behave erratically and David could shift course. 
Winds within the storm were clocked at 150 mph. Sustained winds of up to 74 mph extend 50 miles in all directions, and steady gale force winds upto 63 mph radiate at least 100 miles from the center. 
Forecasters said its course would carry the storm about 100 miles south of Pone¢, Puerto Rico's largest city_and there Wt:IC "reason-rely Certain" that hurricaine force winds, higher than 74 mph, would not strike the island. Heavy seas and gale force winds of more than 50mph lashed Ponce and other areas on the southern coast, forcing evacuation of the lowlying areas. 
On the Virgin Island of St. Croix, civil defense spokesman said winds of 50-75 mph touch­ed 
On the Virgin Islanp of Sf. Croix, civil defense spokesman said winds of 50-75 mph knock~ ed down. trees and utility lines, but caused no casualities or major damage. Teofilo Espin­osa, the island's acting admini­strator, said emergency plans were put into effect, and about 225 people were still housed late Thursday in five shelters in public schools. · 
On Dominica, Seraphin broad­cast an international appeal for aid, and ordered government buildings, schools and churches opened to an estimated 60,000 persons whose homes were 
destroyed by the hurricaine.

Police charge IRA member in murder 
DUBUN ,Ireland (.AP) Irish authorities charged an aHeged IRA. timebomb expert and another man with murder in the slaying of Britain's Earl Mountbatten, killed when his boat has blown up in Donegal Bay. 
Police said they also rounded up an unspecified number of men for questioning in an overnight swoop through Coun­ty Donegal. 
Francis McGirl, a 24-year-old farmer, and Thomas McMahon, 31, an upholsterer -both al­leged members of the illegal Irlsh Republican Army's Pro­visional wing -stood before a judge for just 41h minutes in Dublin's special no-jury court for terrorist cases. 
The charges accused them of "on Aug. 27, in Donegal Bay in Mullaghmore, County Bltgo, murdering Lord Louis Mount­batten contrary to public law." Two members of Mountbat­ten's family and a local teen­
, age boat hand were also killed in last Monday's boat explosion for which the IRA climbed responsibility. McGirl and McMahon, who were not charged in the other deaths, were ordered held until Oct. 2 for a hearing. Security sources said they regarded McNahon as an ac­knowledged expert on time­bomb mechanisms. McGirl' s uncle, John Joe McGirt, was once one of the top six men in the Provisionals' chief policy­makin~ council. McGrrl and McNahon were picked up by police at an antiterronst checkpoint along a road in northwestern Ireland several hours before the bomb blast splintered Mountbatten' s boat. If they were involved, it apparently means either that others took part in the killings or the bomb -an estimated 50 pounds of explosives -was triggered by a timing device or by contact. Police have theorized the ex­plosives might have been plant­

ed in a locker on the boat or in one of the lobster pots checked regularly by Lord Mountbatten, 79-year-old cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, during his annual holiday at MuJlaghmore. 
Monday was the bloodiestday in the 10 years of underground warfare by the IRA., fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland. · Later that day, 18 British soldiers were killed in two bomb explosions in North­ern Ireland for which the Irish guerillas were blamed. 
The desert table at St. Mary's picnic yesterday proved to be a popular spot.

The shooting touched off prot­est demonstrations by members of the black community, but Grady was cleared of wrong doings. An inquest was told that~he victim was "A hold-up man ' and had lungea at Grady with a knife. 
The case was secretly reopen­ed last year, officials said, after Grady's former partner came forward with the information that Bell was shot while fleeing from a traffic investigation and that Grady planted a jacknife in the dead victim's hand. 
District attorney E. Michael McCann said two superiors who knew the truth and who pursu­aded partner Louis G. Krause. to go along with a doctored report are now dead. 
McCann did not identify them. and said no other officer who may have known the truth is any longer with the depart­ment.

Krause "has thought about 
the matter, and it has haunted 
him and deeply troubled him

LETTERS TO A LONELY GOD 
A Joy Until Sunrise 
At night, in Manhattan this summer, like a cosmetic, ~akes the peach and you would walk from Greenwich Vii-· resumes her pacmg, lunching on the 
lage to 59th street, along Seventh Avenue, and you would try to remem­ber what the Dome looks like when the sky turns a midnight blue in the summer sky over Indiana. On Seventh Avenue, Notre Dame seems as remote as the kingdoms you dream of in sleep, but New York is as close as a woman you have hired to share intimacy: temptingJou to love her, then denymg your nee for gentleness and accep­tance, like a call-girl who knows you can't pay enough. On lower Seventh Avenue, only St. Vincent's hospital is comforting to see; because a year ago, at St. Vincent's, they saved your life. The sidewalks are crowded with shadows until you reach 31st street, and the buildin~s in darkness have the bleakness of .{>nson walls. 
No one nottces you, and no one speaks, except near 23rd street where a toothless man, sitting on steps, asks: 
"Would you like to have a date with me?'' You feel sorry for him as you shake your head no. 
At 33rd street, you sit down on the embankment in front of Penn Station, smoke a cigarette, and watch the crowd. A woman, barefoot and dirty, walks up and down the sidewalk on her tiptoes, as though she were a house detective being cautious in a store stocked with gnef. A tiny lady dressed nattily in bib overalls ·-a shopping bag lady with style--pushes a cart crowded with bundles past you. ] ust down the embankment, she spreads out a news­paper to sit on; then, made comfort­able, she searches through the plastic sacks until she fmds a bag of peaches. Sorting them out for bruises, she picks out one, beckons to the lady in grief, and offers her the peach. Nijinska of t~e sidewalk, with dirt caked to her

If you're one of those filin viewers who lumps the Marx Brothers, the Three Stooges, Abbot and Costello, and the Bowery Boys inyto opne homogeneous cate~ory called, simply. "Comedy Teams, ' then I beg you, read no further. There is about as much similarity between the freres Marx and the Three Stooges as there is betweem Buster Keaton and Pinkie Lee. 
During their peak Broadway and HollywOod days(1924-1935), the Marx Bros. were the hottest comedy team known to civilization. Soon after they burst into the bi~time with tie 1924 hit, I'll Say She Is, 1t became very chic to quote the latest Groucho-isms and 
recount what new and naughty things Harpo and Chico were up to. Groucho's lightning wit, sprinkled with puns, nonsequiturs and double entendres appealed to the intellectual and sophisticated crowd; Chico's mus­ical talent for "shooting the keys" earned the admiration of many lady viewe~, w~ile the broader, more slapstick antics of Harpo were appla­uded by ev~ryone.

attendan£e records. By"thetime that George S. Kaufman, the all-time deao of American playwrights, wrote Anim­al Crackers with his collaborator Morrie Ryskind, the Marxes were the toast of the town. 
It seemed inevitable that the Marx Bros. would eventually turn to filin. And with the commotion caused be AI ]olson's The jazz Singer, it became apparent that verbal humor such as Marx's was,"in;" silent comedv was out. their first movie, :The Cocoa-r 
nuts(1929) was little more than a filmed copy of the stage show. zsimilarly, Animal Crackers, '{1930), is merely the film version of the hit Broadway production. 
Animal Crackers takes place at the fashionable Long . Island mansion of Mrs. Arabella Rittenhouse, a rich socialite, amicable portrayed by the Marx's favorite foil, Margaret Du­mont. The thin plot concerns Mrs. Rittenhouse's attempts to create the social hit ofthe season by uncoverin~ a famous painting at her home while also sponsoring the incorrigible Capt­ain Spaulding, the famed African explorer. There is some nonsense fruit as though it, too, were a part of her brooding sorrow. 
Musing on the mystery of who people are, and where do they come from, you journey on to Times Square, moving past the vendors peddling foods or toys, stopping at 45th street to listen to a Muslim preaching a mean-tempered God who rip§ the wings off airplanes as a punishment to arrogance. You pass the honky-tonk stores going out of business and the hustlers beginning the business of the riight. You visit the statues of George M. Cohan, giving his regards to Broadway, and Fr. Duffy at 47th street; then, on up the sidewalk, now darker, leading to Central Park, with time out to press your nose against the delis where bagels are sold, and to read the programs for the fall season at Carnegie Hall. 
At 59th street, you walk east on the promenade running the length of the park, to enjoy the cool of the darkness under the trees. Hansom cabs line up along the curb. You want to pat a horse, but the horses look too tired to be friendly. You stroke them only on the rear end, where the tail would be less vicious than the teeth in discoura­ging ·unwanted affection. 
At the Plaza Hotel, you stop in the restroom for the pause that refreshes. As you walk past the entrance to the Oak Bar, a stunningly dressed woman says, "Good evening," in a voice full of promises. You remember the line: ''A thing of beauty is a joy... until sunrise." 
"Anyway," you think, feeling com-· plimented, ''I must be doing some­thing right, because she looked expen­sive, and sounded sincere." 
In front of the Plaza, yo~ sit on a bench, smoking, and staring at the facade ofthe hotel, which reminds you 
1of t.he way buildings look in Paris, and at the fountain made famous by the midnight immersions of Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. The General Motors building is behind you; turning your head, you can see F.A.O. Schwartz's toy store. The glamour of New York stretches down Fifth A venue from this point: Tiffany's, Steuben's, St. Tho­m~Ls the Apostle church, St. Patrick's, Rockefeller Center, the stone lions of the Public Library, the Empire State Building. You think: "Ofall the night scenes, I love this the best." 
To touch your feet to earth again, you try to think dearly of the Dome, a memory, it seems, necessary to be grasped at, or you c'an never go home again. Thoughts of the campus are elusive, like a face you are trying to match with a name when you've been aoaethetized by a drink. The senses begin their surrender to the seduction of a fairyland kingdom. You are hooked on the City; totally in love with the night face of New York. 
For half an hour, smoking an unbro­ken chain of cigarettes, you sit enslaved as a skyscraper junkie, in servile bondage to the stone and steel of structures that twinkle with lights like a Milky Way laid out for an astronaut's journey. 
Walking down Fifth A venue, home to the rectory, humming with happiness, like a cowboy ridin~ back from the roundup,you begin smging the words of your song. 
Me and my shadow, strolling down the avenue-­Me and my shadow, with nobody to tell our troubles to. And when it's twelve o'clock, we climb the stair; We never knock--there's nobody

,everything works together as a m~­nificent vehicle for the Marxian antics. Groucho is in top form portraying-his most well-known alter ego, Captain Jeffery T. Spaulding. ( The "T" stands for Edgar). He qwps, cajoles, and otherwise verbally assaults Mrs. Rittenhouse and all of her guests. He quickly sees through their pretentious facades, but he beats them at their own game by drawing on their willingness to be duped. They refuse to see through his fraudulency, even when he discusses his  bravery but then faints at the sight of a catepillar. 
Groucho delivers some of his most 
famous lines in this filin. In the classic 
"african lecture" routine , he proc­
laims,"One morning I shot an ele­

phant in my pajamas. How he got in 
my lfiharsas, I don't know." WHEN HE HIS AUDIENCE THAT* 
"Mrs, Rittenhouse hastily concludes the speech for him. Pretty risky stuff for 1930. By the film's end, Groucho manages . to lampoon everything from 'the ailing stock market to Eugene

Griffin 
there But me and my shadow, all alone and feeling blue. 
Near 42nd street, in a doorway as deep as a cave, a young woman sits, ,very drunk or very stoned. "Hey there," she says, "you walking by with acane,you look lonely. Come in here and share your loneliness with me." Her tone makes her words lyrical, like a poem expressive of caring and concern. You apologize for not stoppin~, and she nods her head understandmgly. 
"Me and my shadow, all alone and feeling blue." The invitation that sounded like a poem, you realize, was real with the only promise the City could deliver on. Everything else was poetry that would melt with the sunrise. The night magic of New York was an enchantment mviting you ;o nothing substantial you could ever put your arms around. 
In Manhattan, when the moon is bright, you have to think of things you can put your arms around if you want Notre Dame to seem more real than the kingdoms visited in sleep. 
Hemingway writes: "If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.'' 
Notre Dame, you decide, is also a moveable feast. It is a feast as moveable as you need it to be, travelling with you as a landscape of the heart when other places let you down. Moonbeams, on the campus or on the Chrysler building, are only bneflyimportant. Only the things you can put your arms around are lastingly important. You can't put your arms around a shadow, when you're strol­ling down an avenue.

O'Neill. ) 
Chico plays Emmanuel Ravelli, a musician who offers to play, "an original composition by Victor Hub­ert." Unfortunately he can't recall the ending of the song and has to repeat the same bars over and over again. He confides that sometimes he has to play for weeks before he can remember the 
finish. , 
Harpo makes his entry into the filin as ''The Professor'' although profess­or of what is never made dear. He walks in with a long flowing cape and top hat. When the butler removes Harpo's cape, he leaves the silent down standing there wearing only a tee shirt and boxer shorts. (Once during the /lay's Broadway run Harpo arrive late at the theatre and forgot to put on the trunks under the cape. When the butler removed his cape on stage, the embarassed com­edian was wearing only an athletic supporter, which promoted Groucho to 
. ad-lib to the audience, "Tomorrow night he's not wearin~ anvthing, so get your tickets early.' ' True to his nature, Harpo spends most of his spare time playing games and chasing blondes. 
The youngest brother, Zeppo, has only a minor role in the film as Horatio Jamison, Capt. Spaulding's secretary. 'nus is probably just as well, as his ~al talents were vastly overshad­owed by the professionalism of his older brothers. 
There is still much more to be said about Animal Crackers and the Marx Bros., but I don't want to spoil the film for you. Animal Crackers is sheer zaniness and hilarity at its best. As the adage goes, they just don't make 'eni like this anymore. Don't miss it.

Rabbi teaches 
Theo courses 
in Judaism 
by Mary Fran Callahan 

Rabbi Pincus Peli, a professor from Ben · Gurion University in Negev, Israel, is currently teaching courses in Judaism for the Notre Dame Theology De­partment. Professor Peh is the first rabbi to be invited to occupy such a position. 
The rabbi is offering two courses this semester, Prayer & Judaism and Religious Lang­uage. The courses will focus on Judaism rather than contrast or compare it with Christianity. 
Professor Peli anticipated no problems in terms of interest for his course offerings, "In order to understand Christiani­ty, one must _go back to its source--the Judaic roots. My courses will provide knowledge as well as sensitivity, so that a student of any religious prefer· ence stands to benefit." 
On the first day of classes, Professor Peli did not have enough chairs to accomodate all the students reg_istered for his course. 
In addition to broadening the students' minds, the rabbi is confident that Notre Dame will enrich his own mind. ''I came here because I felt it would be a great opportunity to learn as well as to teach," he said. 
The professor received his education at the Hebrew Uni­versity in Jerusalem and has been chairman of the Hebrew Literature Department for the last three of his ten years at Ben Gurion University.

All of the money comes from the $17 student activities fee paid at the beginning of the year. For this reason the board is trying to get away from awarding so much money to service organi­zations. 
Roche said that he would also like to redirect the financial requests of these groups to the Mardi Gras charity chest. 
A lengthy discussion then followed concerning the alloca­tions of funds. While some members suggested the Stu­dent Government closely con­trol the use of the funds, Roche said he was against such gov­ernment "meddling." 
The board is made up of the Student Body President, Stu· dent Body vice-president, the judicial coordinator, Hall Presi­dents Council chairperson, two HPC representatives, Student Body treasurer, Student Union director and the Off-Campus commissioner. The board will meet again on Thursday the 13th in the Grace penthouse . All meetings are open to the public.
