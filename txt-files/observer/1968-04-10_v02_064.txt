Mroz: Festival A Success 
"We consider it one of the most successful things that has ever happened at Notre Dame," said Chairman John Mroz about the 1968 Sophomore Class Lit­erary Festival. "The reaction of the students and faculty was great. We consider it a total success." 
Mroz was reflecting on last week's festival about which Crit­ic Granville Hicks said, "when I first heard about the idea I thought it was crazy. But I marvel now. It was very impres­sive." 
Praises for the festival came 
not only from Hicks, but from 
the other participating authors, 
and from critics and newspaper 
writers from around the coun­
try. 
"The authors were extremely 
impressed with Notre Dame," Mroz said. "They found the rec­eption just tremendous. They were really impressed by the interest that the entire campus 
sho.ved in the week. Joseph 
Heller said that he wts coming 
back next year 'even if we don't 
invite him.' " 
"I definitely see the Literary Festival as an annual event at Notre Dame," Mroz stated. "We have a nation wide reputation now. A number of authors have already expressed a willingness to come next year, even before this year's festival started. Now that this year's festival has turned out to be a great success, I'm sure other authors will be more than willing to come. The im­portant thing now is starting 
the work.''

Two Breen-Phillips soph­omores however, irritated by the noise and distrubance caused by the controversy over the Pace­setter incident took approximate­ly four hundred of the original second pages of the Pacesetter and started distributing the mim­eographed page to Alumni, Dil­lon, and Keenan Halls.

Great Union Robbers Remain Unidentified 
The "Great Union Robbery" of approximately $3300 from a safe in the Student Union office over Junior Parents weekend re­mains unsolved. Notre Dame Se­curity Director Arthur Pears ad­mitted yesterday that he "had no red-hot suspect." But he said that after polygraph and finger print examination and investi­gation are completed he hopes to have information pointing to the Union robber. 
Pears said yesterday that Un­ion personnel have not as yet been fingerprinted. Prints were lifted from the Student Union Office last week, especially from the safe which held the stolen cash and checks. 
The lie detector tests called for by Pears and Student Union officials last week began yester­

In an Election Committee meeting called by Student Life Commissioner and Committee Chairman Larry Landry, it was decided that the Pacesetter would be asked to omit its attack on Soldati. The second of the pa­per's two mimeographed sheets was reprinted without mention of the old Faculty Club. 
The question was then raised by the Election Committee and both Doyle_ and Soldati camps 
as to the legitimacy of a hall newspaper being distributed out­side the hall. Eight hundred cop­ies of the Pacesetter were printed and distribution was planned for the halls on the freshmen quad and Dillon and Alumni. 
The Committee, consisting of Landry and members, Student day afternoon. Pears said that he hoped to run polygraph tests on eight students. 


Both the use of the poly­graph equipment and the finger­printing have been delayed be­cause the Security Office has 
had to bring in South Bend Police department personnel and equipment. 
Pears said that he was still optimistic about detecting the thief despite the lapse of ten days with no prominent suspects. 
Student Union Vice-President Bill Wade said yesterday that Student Union's investigation of the matter seemed to have rea­ched a "roadblock.'' Wade said that Union officials were con­cerned that the investigation's momentum would be lost over the Easter recess.

The man who killed Martin Luther King last Thursday killed a 
man who was already dead. King's sway over his people had dis­
sipated with the failings of non-violence. The people he led found 
that love was nice but it didn't put any bread on the table. America 
was at the point one of Alan Paton's characters considers, "Let us 
hope they turn to loving before we have turned to hating." King 
had a dream, a good one, but few had it with him. 
The irony of his death is that it excused the violence of last 
weekend, that the death of a man who, his father said, "never 
hated anyone in his life," focused the hatred of the ghetto on its 
walls. His death resulted in the actions his life exactly opposed. 
He wasn't Socrates and he wasn't Jesus Christ. He was a good man who went, as good men do, unheard. If man had evolved farther than he has, he would have destroyed himself long ago. 
Against that movement toward self-destruction stand the words of men like Martin Luther King. Treating us as better than we are, they raise us to their own level. 
Martin Luther King had his flaws, although his death, his char­
isma, will rub them out just as John Kennedy's death erased his 
blunders. A death such as King's boils a man down to the good 
that is in him, and Martin Luther King was a good man. He wasn't 
the most effective leader, except that he had been there first. Often 
he arrived late and left early, allowing subordinates to achieve the 
solutions his televised presence had served to pressure. Media gave 
him the credit for what his organization achieved. 
But Martin Luther King never pretended to be the organization 
man that Movement required. People need their saints and he 
agreed to serve that function. Conscious of his people's needs, he 
could also be conscious of how he failed them. He was an uncom­
mon man, if only because he kept his dream, could assert that "We 
shall overcome." 
Perhaps, in the universal scope of things as they are, it is nec­cessary that Martin Luther King is now buried. Somehow, a man who has died for a cause commands the wider audience as the natural feeling of loss in each man's death makes his words ring clear, his actions true. Maybe now he will be heard, if not by his people, at least by another. 
He spoke of being opposed, not so much by the White Citizens Councils or the Ku Klux Klan, as by those white moderates who are afraid to risk disorder for the sake of justice. Men with dreams will always challenge a free and easy status quo, even if that status quo is welfare checks as well as Lincolns. 

Now Martin Luther King is buried. The Movement will make him more than he was, those now confronted by Stokely Car­m~chael and H. Rap Brown, by those who have turned to hating, will wish King still lived, and those who understood and lived ~ King's words will find a new leader. Martin Luther King deserves that America should become as good as he believed it could be. 
Let his people go.

Hesburgh Gives Martin Luther King Eulogy 
BY PAT GAFFNEY 
Monday afternoon, a special Mass in Sacred Heart Church climaxed the public tribute of the Notre Dame community to the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The church was nearly filled, some 20 priests concelebrated, and University president Rev. Theodore Hcsburgh, C.S.C. de­livered the homily. 
Father Hcsburgh began his homily by reading a few senten­ces from a eulogy he had com­posed shortly after the assassin­ation of President Kennedy in 1963. The words he said, seemed once again appropriate: 

"And now he is dead, cut down in mid-stride along the road. There is no answer, out­side the inscrutable Providence of God, to the question on 

good and blackest cvii, everyone who works for what is good and noble can expect to unleash against himself all of the dark irrational powers of evil -anger, hatred and violence. The evil docs not disappear with the evil deed, it is only starkly ·and cruelly visible in his tragic death." 
Martin Luther King was, of course, a kind of prophet," said Fr. Hesburgh. "He said many things that many people dis­liked." He spoke to his people like a Moses, and "He had a dream of a nation where little children could go to school to­gether despite the fact that some were white and some were black; where a man could be taken for what he is as a person; a dream that is still with us, a dream that is yet to be achieved." But, "only if each of us do s9mething about it" will "the idiotic hatred" be overcome. 
But not only was Martin Luther King a prophet, said Fr. Hcsburgh, he was also a kind of charismatic leader. "To a world divided by so many chasms and predjudices, he spoke out loud and clear that everyone was a child of God...He did every­thing he could in a way that re­quired wisdom, courage and a great deal of sincerity." 
But most important, like the Mahatma Gandhi he admired, he understood the paradox of non-violence in the attainment of human justice. "All great hu­man goods are achieved by suf­fering...blood must flow:, the 
price must be paid." Dr. King, 
by the bold intensity of his life, 
and now by the violence of his 
untimely death, showed that he 
for one, "like all good men, lik; 
Jesus Christ," was willing to 
meet this cost and pay the price 
of sUffering. 
"A simple question remains for us," Fr. Hesburgh continued. "Are we going to pay the price? Are we going to help find a way out of the kind of second rate education most Negro youngsters get, the second rate housing, the second rate jobs, the life where everything is always second rate? 
...Does this nation just kill its prophets, or does it listen to them too? Are we gping to do some­thing beside write about it, read about it, and talk about it?"

In his "article" on this year's Olympic Games, Mr. O'Neil cri­ticizes the athletes who, for one reason or another, have chosen not to compete and makes a mockery of their decision. 
If the Olympics are non-poli­tical, as Mr. O'Neil implies, they represent an opportunity for an outstanding athlete to enter into personal competition with some of the greatest athletes in the 
·world. Assuming that the Games are not politically significant, the individual athlete is certainly un­der no obligation to either his government or his fellow citizens to compete in them. 
If, however, the Olympics are 

 significant outside of the realm of sports, which unfortunately appears to be the case, (witness the carefully watched score of medals won by each of the lead­ing nations, the professional "a­mateurs" representing the various countries, the ever-present flags and anthems, etc.) then the ath­letes in question have every right (especially in this "Land of the Free") to use this newly-acquir­ed political status to express their beliefs. 
_ Since they are amateurs, they are under no obligation to the United States government (which does not even pay for their transportation) nor do they have any duty to express their beliefs as some other Americans would prefer. 
The Olympic Games represent the greatest honor attainable by an amateur athlete, this is realiz­ed far more acutley by the ath­letes participating in the boycott than by Mr. O'Neil or any other self.appointed judges. The choice to compete or not is theirs' alone, and if they choose to sacrifice this tremendous opportunity, Dame students from the Circlethey should be commended for to South Bend. In order to attendtheir integrity not condemned the memorial that day, a greatfor making the country look bad.

I completely missed Physical Education, and thought I would miss a two-cut day in a five credit course (I believe I had four cuts at the time) but luckily the me­morial didn't last any longer than it did and I did not miss this par­ticular course. I really did believe that I would have gotten excused cuts from the Administration.

point out the Administration's extreme lack of good taste or stupidity in not honoring this great American.
