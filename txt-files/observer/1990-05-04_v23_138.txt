Proposed move of local bookstore stirs controversy because of zoning 
By KELLEY TUTHILL 
News Editor 
A debate is brewing in South Bend's northeast neighborhood over the pro­posed move of Pandora's Books to a new location on the corner of Howard St. and Notre Dame Ave. 
Pandora's Books is presently located at 808 Howard Street and would like to move across the street into a "bigger and nicer structure," accord­ing to Store Manager Mandy Arnold. 
In order for Pandora's to make a move across the street the plot of land would have to be rezoned from an A­residential zone to a C-1 commercial zone. 
Art Quigley, president of the north­
east neighborhood association and 
associate professor emeritus, opposes 
the rezoning based on bad experiences 
with this piece of land in the past. He 
said that he does not oppose a book­
store in the neighborhood; however, 
he does not want it on that particular 
corner. 
"It's a beautiful place for three 
homes," he said. Renelda Hobinson, 
director of the northeast 
neighborhood association, agreed 
saying, "We need some affordable 
housing in this area." 
"We really want to have a new 
store," said Arnold. She said the new 
plan, which includes a parking lot and 
landscaping, will get cars off the 
street. Presently, customers at Pan­
dora's must park on Howard St. in 
front of the store. 
She said. the operation would not 
change and promised that there would 
be no large delivery trucks, only small 
vans. Quigley said that in the past there was a restaurant on this slot of land which was respectable for a period of time. He said, however, that after the restaurant was granted a liquor li­
cense it "went downhill." 
James Roemer, director of Com­munity Helations at Notre Dame, said that the official University position supports the northeast neighborhood association. The offieial stance was a result of discussions by Hoerner. Thomas Mason. vice president for 
Business Affairs, Philip Faccenda. general counsel, and Father William Beauchamp, executive vice president of Notre Dame. 
He said that although the owners of 
Pandora's are "very good neighbors 
and well respected, wonderful people," 
the neighborhood residents do not 
want a bookstore on this corner. 
A petition against the rezoning of 
the land was signed by approximately 
200-300 residents, said Hoerner. 
He said that if Pandora's possibly failed, for example, the property could then be sold for commercial use. "Once it's rezoned. we have no control," said Robinson. 
"Supporting the proposed change to C-1 for this corner permits only lim­ited commereial use of property for such buildings as a bookstorn, This zoning changes does not permit tlw establishing a bar, restaurant or most other commercial uses; nor does Pan­dora's Books or the lloward-ND Part­nership (the builders of the building) have any interest in promoting or lm­couraging sueh ventures in our neigh­borhood." according to a Oyer put out by Pandora's. 
Arnold said that the bookstore polled the residents of the neighbor­hood by phone from April 1 through April 25. "We were pleased to sec how many people are for it (the proposed move)," she said. She said over 1000 contacts were attempted and over 500 responses were obtained.

Approximately 3,02H inci­dnnts wnre reported to Notre Dame Security in 19H9, a figure which is dose to the number of ineidents for the year before, according to Hex Hakow, diree­tor of Seeurity. 
This figure is a bit different from those of past years since traffic citations are now in­cluded, Hakow said. Larceny is traditionally the largest eate­gory of ineidents on campus, he said. and 500 of this year's re­ports were of some type of theft. 
"Larcenies include everything from stolen w11llets, bookbags, bicyeles, to car radios,"said Chuck llurley, assistant direc­tor of Security. 
Rakow said improvements are being made in combatting larceny. Last fall, a South Bend resident was apprehended in connection with the theft of bookbags at Notre Dame. The woman had attempted to sell the books to local bookstores. 
Public accidents increased significantly in 1989, according to Hakow. "These include per­sonal injuries from playing basketball to people falling out of lofts," Hakow said. 
Vandalism, assaults and towing all stayed at about the same level, said Rakow. Two hundred fifty-six cars were towed in 1989 and 84 have been towed as of March, Rakow said. 
"It was a good year overall, but recent assaults have been the most troubling prob­lem,"said Hakow. Hakow cited three series of assaults on campus this year. A jogger in a blue swcatsuit and a band of juveniles each separately both­ered women in the fall. A series of assaults that began in April have lead to the arrest of a suspect. 
"We have stepped up patrols and have placed people in vari­ous locations to watch," Hurley said. "Rightfully, females are concerned as we are," he added. 
Hakow stated that the in­volvement of Security with the student-based SafeWalk pro­gram was the most positive event of the year. "SafeWalk allowed us to do more patrol time," Rakow said. 
SafeWalk was started this year by junior Gina Mahony as a response to the attacks that occurred in the fall. Security has always offered escorts to people, but most students were not aware of it, according to Hurley. 
A new computer system will be used in the next few weeks that will keep records of every incident and accelerate the pro­cess of getting information, Hakow said. 
Other changes for next year will include the relocation of the Security department to the old HOTC Building. 
"The new offices will give us the opportunity to work more closely with student groups and offer more educational semi­nars on crime prevention," Hurley said. 
A few more Security positions will be added to next year's staff in response to the expan­sion of the campus, according to Hurley. 
Hurley said that the summer session at Notre Dame is not as "day-to-day busy," but that there are still many events such as alumni reunions and special events at the JACC. 
Some goals that the depart­ment is working on include the continuation of a good rapport with students and letting them know that "we are here to serve the University community," Hurley said. The expansion of education about crime preven­tion is another goal. 
Although this is only Hurley's second year of working for Notre Dame Security, he said it has been going smoothly and he enjoys working here. 

Ideas tor improved female experience at ND are given 

By SANDRA WIEGAND 
Assistant News Editor 
A sex-blind admissions procedure, co-residential housing, an increase in fe­male faculty and a policy al­lowing the consumption of alcoholic beverages in dorm hallways are among the di­verse conditions that would improve the female experi­ence at Notre Dame, accord­ing to a ~·udent Government report. 
In the last few years, due to a discrepancy between the number of women who ap­plied to NO and the number who were accepted and at­tended, a conscious effort was made to increase the number of women accepted. Men's and women's applica­tions have been evaluated. separately. 
The Student Government report to the Board of Trustees recommends an admissions procedure that does not take into account the sex of the applicant, to "enable the most qualified applicants to be accepted, thus contributing to the highest possible quality of student body."

have sex-blind admissions policies," said Amy Weber, chairperson for the report, "and their ratio is about what ours is. The applicant pool may increase if women realize they're not pitted against other women." 
Co-residential housing should initially be offered to upperclassmen on an exper­imental basis, the report says. Siegfried, Knott, Pas­querilla East and Pasqucrilla West should be converted first, as their "L" shape would allow separation of sexes by wing. 
Co-residentiality would "provide a natural environ­ment in which men and women could learn from each other, leading to the creation of mutual respect," &ays the report.

The Good, the Bad, and the Golden Dome 
She rode into town in 1972 in a cloud of dust, tethered her horse and prepared to stay. 
The townspeople regarded her suspi­ciously through their 
windows. They wer.e Alison Cocks 
coldly polite as she 
bought provisions at Editor-in-Chief their General Store and took a room in one of their boarding houses. 
But they stopped her as she tried to enter the Golden Dome Saloon. "Men only, ma'am," said the barkeep, doffing his hat to her. 
The men in the smoke-filled saloon turned hostile eyes to her, then went back to their high-stakes poker game, taking swigs of beer and adding chips to the pile. 
She went away quietly this time, but de­termined to return. 
The townsfolk accepted the stranger; she began to feel a part of them as they smiled politely and touched the brims of their hats as they passed. 
But there still remained the saloon. She passed it day after day as she walked down the street in the town, hearing piano music and boisterous laughter wafting through the swinging doors. The life of the town lay in the saloon, she knew, but for her it was strictly taboo. 
Once in awhile someone would stagger in front of the saloon, drunk, yelling half-co­herent challenges to the men inside. They would emerge, their silent manner ominous, and take care of the problem quickly. Ten paces, turn and fire ... the troublemaker never stood a chance. The townsfolk would mutter behind their window shades, but their justice prevailed. As long as the poker games continued, the whiskey flowed and the music echoed down the street all was right in the world. 
Years passed and she established roots in the town. Working quietly alongside her neighbors she earned her living and her place. The acceptance and the friendliness ceased to amaze her and became a matter of course. By day she felt as though the town had always been her home. 

By night the saloon still irked her. She had 
won the respect of the town, but the saloon 
remained an exclusive area and she had yet 
to gain admission. After dark she was still 
not completely accepted. 
What the hell, she thought one day, I'll try again. Maybe this time ... 
She approached the saloon, drawn as al­
ways by the sounds emanating from within. 
Boldly she pushed the door open. Heads 
turned but no one spoke. Silently the men at 
the poker table shifted in their seats and 
pulled a chair out for her, pushing a glass 
of whiskey her way. 

The Golden Dome Saloon let a woman into 
its men's club.

dents should be made public in order to reveal to the student body the extent of the problem. Many advocates for educating Notre Dame students on the problem of rape want conse­quences of rape to be made clear to incoming male fresh­men during orientation. 
The issue of women giving re­nections at Mass instead of the priest's homily was also raised. It was argued that the Univer­sity's decision to allow Provost Tim O'Mnara, an unordained man, to give the homily at the Baccalaureate Mass was a double standard in this issue. It was noted that women often give the homily at summer Masses at ND, and this practice could be extended to the regu­lar school year. 
A suggnstion was made that ND should makf~ an effort to improv1~ the mlationship be­tween the women of Notre Damn and Saint Mary's College. It was noted that when Notrn Dame first acceptml womnn 18 years ago, tlw ND women im­mediately subseribed to the stereotypes about SMC women established by men at Notre Dame. 
As for the stereotypes of women in general. the sugges­tion was made to implement a genders study course in the re­quired curriculum in the hope that it could help battle gmH.Ier ignorance. It was reported that the University has been very rn­ceptive to the idea, yet still needs the funding to st<irt such a program. 
A committee for the Graduate Women at Notre Dame wants a center established for tho graduate women as a place wh!lrn the women can nHnn to­gether as a community and act as a support network for each other. The committee said that these women are generally a minority in their disciplines and oftnn do not find any support within their departnwnt. 
In the dosing of the nwnting, a brief report purportPd that Student Aetivi'iies do1~s not sat­isfy thn n1wds of the nwdia groups: WVFI, WSND, and Scholastk. Tlw committee sug­gc~sted that an autonomous group outside Student ArtivitiPs eould soiPly regulat1~ tlwse stu­dPnt medias. 
Hobert l'asin, studPnt body presidnnt. said "It's unfortu­nate that only five out of I:{ trustees attendPd thn nweting. llowever. the n~ports don't end thorn. The reports will be sent to all trustees and officnrs of the University. The student government will follow up to­day's meeting with eontinw~d rnports on these issues."

a number of women faculty members which reflects na­tional availability rates, the re­port says. Presently less than eight percent of ND faculty with tenure are women. Bene­fits to increase retention of fe­male faculty should include parental leave and child care policies and spousal employ­ment initiatives. 
Alcoholic beverages should be allowed in the hallways during semi-formals, Student Govern­ment recommends, since drinking continues behind closed doors anyway, and "the current rule...inhibits two of the most positive aspects of the semi-formals: social interac­tion and hall unity." 
Information from various universities provided ideas for the report, Weber said. Brochures from Stanford Uni­versity designed to introduce women to the campus spurred the idea of a "Women's Guide to Notre Dame," she said. 
Other recommendations in­clude the following: 
Permanent 
status for the Gender Studies Program, along with a continued attempt to se­cure an endowment for the program. 

Re-evaluation 
of the curricu­lum to eliminate gender bias. 

A 
formal procedure for submitting sexual harassment complaints. 

Guaranteed 
participation at campus masses for Eucharistic ministers. even when enough priests are present to accom­modate the congregation. 

Greater 
participation for women at the year's opening mass. 

Installation 
of 25 emergency telephones to improve security, especially in the parking lots, and additional lights around campus that retain the "aesthetically pleasing" ap­pearance of the campus. 

A 
24-hour area for study and social purposes for the en­tire campus. The basement of LaFortune is recommended. 

A 
change in athletic policy to 


obtain accordance with Title IX regulations, which guarantee equality for both sexes regard­ing various athletic benefits and opportunities, "not only because it is the law, but because it is the fair and right 
thing to do."

continued from page 1 
According to the people who responded to the survey, 250 or 45 percent said yes to the ques­tion, "Are you in favor of a new bookstore on Notre Dame Ave. at Howard St?" 198 or 36 per­cent said they don't care, 69 or 12 percent said no, and 37 or 7 percent were undecided. These results reflect a combination of two separate surveys by Pan­dora's. 
Opponents of the rezoning questioned the validity of the survey. Roemer said that he heard Pandora's merely asked residents whether they would like to have a bookstore in the neighborhood, not if they minded rezoning in their neigh­borhood. 
Father David Schlaver, editor and publisher of Ave Marla Press, recently wrote a column in the South Bend Tribune voicing his support for the re­zoning. 
"A new and larger store would serve the South Bend and Notre Dame community better, and I think would greatly bene­fit the northeast neighbor­hood," he said. 
While opponents agree that they are not against the idea of a new bookstore, they sug­gested several alternative loca-

Roemer said he suggested that Pandora's move into Goodwill plaza, in the location that is currently Brunos Pizza. He said that this area is "properly zoned" for a busi­ness. 
In addition, Roemer said that Notre Dame offered to buy the lot at the corner of Howard St. and Notre Dame Ave. from Pandora's, at the same price Pandor-a's owners paid for it, in order to prevent the rezoning. 
He added that Notre Dame has a particular interest in this neighborhood because there are numerous students, faculty and staff who reside in the area. "Notre Dame is concerned be­cause of the people who live there." 
Robinson said she suggested that Pandora's consider moving next to Club 23, while Quigley suggested the area wherP Corby's bar used to stand.

Two Amtraks have accidents in less than 24 hours 
DURANT, Miss. (AP) -A passenger train crashed into a truck, injuring 29 people Thursday, less than 24 hours after another Amtrak train smashed into a row of freight cars in Indiana in an accident that injured 26. 
The latest accident occurred about 9:30 a.m. when the train, "City of New Orleans," en route from Chicagq to New Orleans, struck a log truck at a private railroad crossing near the Memphis Hardwood Co., alum­beryard in Durant. 
Authorities said no flashing lights or signs marked the crossing. 
"It looked like a dynamite explosion," said state Trooper Jimmie Thomas, who witnessed the accident. "When it hit, it scattered lumber all over cre­ation, and the truck was dragged down the track." 
"It was a big jolt," said pas­senger Melissa Mitchell. "Everybody woke up ... We got outside and saw that we were majorly off the track, but 
upright." 
Officials said 160 to 170 peo­ple, including crew, were on the train. At least two crew mem­bers were among those injured. 
It was the second Amtrak

The engine (left) of the three-car train hit a box car. Twenty-six people were reported injured. Six were admitted to Culver Hospital in Crawfordsville and listed in satisfactory 
condition. 

Internships awarded 
Special to the Observer 
The Helen Kellogg Institute for International Studies has announced the selection of three students for summer in­ternships in human rights. 
The Institute awards up to three subsidized internships annually to outstanding under­graduates from any college in the University. The students will all be working in Washing­ton, D.C. this summer. 
Wendy Cunningham, of Wright-Patterson, Ohio, a gov­ernment and economics major, will spend two months as an in­tern with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights at the Organization of Ameri­can States. 
Susan Finn of Dallas, Texas, a Spanish and international re­lations major, will spend her in­ternship at the Washington Of­fice on Latin American (WOLA). 
Kathleen Mulhern, an English major from Basking Ridge, N.J. will be an intern at the Center of Concern. 
The interns spend their time in a variety of activities pro­moting human rights, including research, attendance at Con­gressional hearings, and office support to visiting dignitaries.

Authorities said an incor­rectly set switch sent a Chicago-to-Indianapolis train crashing into freight cars Wednesday night near Craw­fordsville, Ind.

State" with 30 to 35 people aboard derailed Wednesday night after striking five freight cars parked on an outside track 40 miles northwest of In­dianapolis. 
A passenger and the train's engineer and assistant engineer remained hosoitalized Thursday with minor injuries. The others were treated. 
"Thank God we were only going 25 (mph), or him and I would be history," said assis­tant engineer James Neff, 42, referring to himself and Am­trak employee James Ullery, 40. 
Ullery said that by the time he noticed the train was on the wrong track, it was too late. 
Officials from Amtrak, Con­r~il. the National Transporta­tion Safety Board and the Fed­era! Railroad Administration were investigating the cause of the crash, but released no pre­liminary results. Conrail owns the track where the accident occurred. 
In the accident at Durant, District Two Community Hospi­tal reported at least 25 people were brought from the scene. A spokeswoman said that except for the truck driver, most of the people were treated for bumps and bruises.

the efficiency of labor." He cited a hospital in New Jersey 
where the method is scheduled to be implemented as one ex­ample where sous vide would cut labor costs. 
"This will help them stream­line," he said, "you're eliminat­ing a lot of labor in the hospital itself." He said he expects the method of food preparation to move into other areas of the food industry as well because, among other things, "you are able with that technology to of­fer a much broader, much more sophisticated menu." 
"I think there will be some applications in fast food. I don't think it's going to be im­mediate. I think it's going to be down the road," he said. 
One problem the method faces in restaurants he said is that "the customer has indi­cated that they don't want a branded product. They want to feel it was made for them, not made 150 miles away." 
Sous vide has unsuccessfully attempted to move into the grocery market. "We're actually packaging meals so people can just pick them up in a su­permarket," explained Grace. "This is a meal that when you bring it home, tastes just like a meal in a restaurant." The meals arc only marginally morn expensive than typical frozen dinners, he said. 
Responding to a question as to whether the typical American consumer would be willing to buy a high-quality meal in a package, he said, "That's one of the open issues, whether the American consumer will recog­nize that quality." 
So far General Foods, Nes­tles, and Campbell Soup have all tried to market sous vide products and failed. Kraft is currently test-marketing a product called Chillery in Kansas City. 
"The food business, like so many other businesses, is going to be technologically driven," Grace said of the future. "One of the reasons why it (technology like sous vide) is so expensive today is because the technology is just embryonic."

WASHINGTON (AP)-Senate Democrats proposed Thursday that the public finance nearly half the cost of Senate cam­paigns and that political action committees be prohibited from contributing directly to candi­dates. 
The revised campaign reform bill, which party leaders said they will bring to the Senate floor next week, retains spend­ing ceilings vehemently opposed by most Republicans but raises them about 20 percent above what Democrats had first pro­posed. 
Democratic leaders unveiled their package just two days after Republicans rushed out a counter proposal endorsed by 34 of the 45 GOP senators. 
Under the Democratic plan, about 70 percent of a candi­date's general election cam­paign expenses -but none of the costs for primary races ­would be paid by the govern­ment from funds raised through a proposed $3 checkoff on income tax returns. 
Since the middle 1970s, tax returns have included a check­off that allows taxpayers to designate $1 of their taxes to a fund for financing presidential campaigns. 
The new Democratic-pro­posed ceilings on Senate cam­paigns would range from $1.9 million in small states to slightly more than $10'million in the largest, California. Spon­sors said it would basically cut in half the amount now being spent. 
The GOP plan would abolish union and corporate PACs en­tirely and cut the amount that issue-oriented PACs can con­tribute to campaigns by 80 per­cent. But Republicans would leave unlimited the aggregate amounts that candidates and the two parties can raise from individual donors and spend on elections. 
"The only meaningful way to reform ... is to have limits on campaign spending," said Sen­ate Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine. "Anything less than that avoids the real issues and simply creates the illusion of reform." 
With revised proposals from both parties now on the table, the door is open for Mitchell, Republican Leader Bob Dole and their representatives to be­gin serious negotiations. 
"We still hope we can reach a bipartisan agreement," Mitchell said. "I hope we can engage in discussions in the very near fu­ture." 
Oklahoma Sen. Qavid Boren, the chief author of the Demo­cratic package, said he doesn't expect those talks to begin be­fore the bill is brought to the Senate floor Monday or Tues­day. 
. "Everything is negotiable from our point of view, except that we have to have some limit on overall spending, or that money will pop up in some other way," Boren said. 
The initial reaction from Re­publicans was disdain. 
"I can't believe this is a seri­ous proposal," said Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the chief author of the GOP measure.

conservatives lose elections 
LONDON (APJ -Prime Minis­
ter Margaret Thatchnr's Con­
sorvative Party lost heavily in 
local elections Thursday. and 
socialists posted their best per­
formance since she won power 
11 years ago. 
But the Consorvatives, in dnop trouble over the eeonorny and the imposition of an unpopular n1~w local governnwnt tax, averted the rout forecast in opinion polls, where Thatcher trails by nearly 20 points. 
"Not a marvellous result. hut certainly not the disaster that was being predicted," said En­vironment Soeretary Chris Pat­ten, the Cabirwt official in eharge of the new so-<"ailed poll tax. "It's thn massaere that didn't happPn." 
Tho Labor Party was jubilant. It was thn only party to make net gains and easily outstrippod its target of 200 new soats. 
With results declared from 180 of' tho 20 I councils. Labor had made 10 new gains to con­trol 89 eouneils. The Conserva­tives lost eight and had control of 36. 
The third-running centrist Social and Liberal Democratic Party controllod three councils and had lost throe. No party had overall control in the rest. 
About 5,000 seats were at stake. 
"We're delighted," said Labor campaign manager Bryan Gould . 
But he said the Tories' not doing as badly as predicted would lessen pressure by some worried Conservatives to try to shed Thatcher as leader. "If so, the Tories ~ill be making a mistake," he added. 
For the first time since Thatcher won power in 1979, Laborites made significant gains in the Tory heartlands of the prosperous south. 
Labor seized control from the Tories of the south England port of Portsmouth and for the first time in nearly 20 years, Laborites won seats in nearby

Iranian president says U.S. acted like 'spoiled, frustrated child' 
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) ­President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran said Thursday the groups holding hostages in Le­banon released two Americans at Iran's prodding, but that the United States was still acting like a spoiled child. 
He also said Iran is not restoring diplomatic ties with the United States. 
Robert Polhill, 55, of New York, was freed April 22 and eight days later a second U.S. educator held hostage, Frank Reed, 57, of Malden, Mass., was freed. 
Rafsanjani said the kidnap­pers released the two "at our suggestion. They could have ... rejected our advice. But they accepted our advice." 
In his speech to a group of teachers in Tehran, Iran's capi­tal, Rafsanjani compared the 
U.S. response to that of "a stubborn, frustrated child." 
The speech was carried by Tehran Radio and monitored in Nicosia. 
President Bush told a news conference in Washington Thursday he was cheered by the release of Polhill and Reed, but was unwilling to make any con­ciliatory gestures toward Iran at this time. 
Bush has repeatedly declared he will not negotiate with Iran or the Lebanese Shiite Moslem kidnappers for the release of hostages. 
But he did promise to help Iran get details on the fate of four Iranian diplomats kid­napped in Lebanon in 1982, calling. it a goodwill gesture and not an attempt to bargain for U.S. hostages. 
"This is something they feel very strongly about," Bush

Fire races through Everglades 
MIAMI (AP) -A 4-mile-wide 
brush fire raced through bone­
dry Everglades sawgrass 
Thursday, jumping a canal and 
threatening 150,000 acres of a 
wildlife preserve. 
"We're in big trouble, it jumped a levy 50 feet wide," said state ranger Gene Dempsey. "There's nothing slowing it down -there's no water holes, no breaks." 
The fire, driven westward by 15 mph winds and fueled by sawgrass parched by Florida's two-year drought, had spread to 24,000 acres, or more than 37 square miles, by early after­noon. 
The fire northwest of Miami did not threaten any inhabited areas. By jumping the canal, the blaze moved into the Ever­glades wildlife management area and headed toward the Big Cypress National Preserve. 
"Our main hope was to stop it there," Dempsey said. "The next canal is about 12 miles away." 
The wildfire was one of three burning around Miami. A 10,000-acre fire in Everglades National Park southwest of Mi­ami remained active Thursday, although park spokeswoman Pat Tolle said a federal fire­fighting team from Asheville, 
N.C. seemed to be containing it successfully. 
Seminole Indian firefighters were trying to control a smaller blaze on their reservation in Broward County, said Dempsey. So far they did not need state help. 
said. "They've mentioned it to us several different times." 
Sixteen Westerners, including six Americans, are missing in Lebanon. Most are believed held by groups controlled by Hezbollah, the Iranian-financed Party of God. Longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The As­sociated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985. 
In London, Prime .Minister Margaret Thatcher on Thurs­day welcomed Syria's and Iran's role in gaining freedom for Polhill and Reed, but said Britain will not deal with hostage-takers. 
She is under pressure to se­cure the r·elease of British hostages in Lebanon. Three Britons and an Irishman with dual British and Irish citizen­ship are held, including Terry Waite, special envoy of Arch­bishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie. 
Rafsanjani said Thursday that "an angry, revolutionary, enraged group, after it released one hostage without pre-condi­tions. 

Former hostage beaten after escape attempt 
ROSTON (AP) -Former hostage Frank Reed was severely beaten after an escape attempt and was told his mother had died even though she's still living, his daughter said Thursday. 
"He didn't know she was alive until he was released," said Marilyn Langston. "We were able to tell him she was very much alive." 
Reed's mother, 91-year-old Leota Sprague, shares an apartment in the suburb of Malden with Reed's wife, Fahima, and the couple's 9­year-old son, Tarek. 
Langston said she was told Thursday by a State Depart­ment spokesman that doctors had decided Reed, who is weak after 42 months in captivity, should undergo further medical tests. 
Frances Jones, a spokeswoman for the State De­partment's Bureau of Consular Affairs, said Reed would be flown to Andrews Air Force Basf~ Friday, then probably to Walter Heed Army Medical Cen­ter, where former hostage Robert Polhill was taken aftPr being released April 22. 
Jones said it was unelear how long Heed would stay in Wash­ington befon~ continuing to Massachusetts. 
Langston, who also Jives in Malden. said she would fly to Washington on Friday to meet her father. 
In a telephone call Wednes­day, Heed told Langston he had tried to nscape. 
"lie told me he'd been beaten. lie did try to escape and they'd bnaten him very badly," Langston said in a telephone in­terview from her home. 
She said Reed was denied medical attention for his wounds and is still recovering from them.

Air-, sea-launched weapons offset cuts in land-based, analysts say 
WASJIINGTON lAP) -The United States is developing air­and sea-launched nuelear wflapons that would more than offset the loss of fi rflpower re­sulting from President Bush's cancellation of two land-based nuclear systems in Europe, analysts said Thursday. 
Earlier in the day, Bush offi­cially scrapped plans to field a nnw. more powerful version of the Lance missile and a mod­ernized 155 mm nudear-tipped artillery shell. The decision had b1wn widely anticipated, even though Bush strenuously ar­gued for thosn weapons last year. West Germany and other NATO allies opposed the weapons. 
Bush made no mention of the other nuclear weapons already in the pipeline for European deploymnnt. Private arms nx­perts say these other weapons, some of which already arn in 
Europe,  havfl  mt>re  military  
worth  than  either  of  the  
earH~eled systems.  

The tradeoff is like "trading 
two handguns for an assault ri­fle," said Daniel Plesch, direc­tor of the British American Se­curity Information Council, a private arms group. 
Already in the American nu­clear arsenal in Europe are an estimated 1,400 free-fall bombs carried by the F-111 and other European-based aircraft; about 1,200 artillery shells; 200 anti­
submarine  depth  bombs  and  
700 aging Lance missiles.  
The  most  important  new  

weapon earmarked for Euro­pean deployment is an air-to­surface nuclear missile that could be carried on the Ameri­can F-16 fighters based in Eu­rope and the new F-15E nuclear strike aircraft now in production. 
The leading candidate for an air-to-surface missile is the Short-Hange Attack Missile­Tactical. which the Air Force is reported to be developing. It would have a range of about 250 miles. 
William Arkin, an arms ex­pert with the environmental group Greenpeace U.S.A., said the Air Force wants to start deploying about 300 of the the air-to-surface missile in Europe by 1995. 
The advantage of an air-to­surface missile is that it would give the air forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization the capability, in the event of a nuclear war, to "stand off" from the battlefront and still hit Soviet territory. 
The United States now has no air-to-surface nuclear missiles in Europe. Britain and Prance are reportedly cooperating to develop their own missiles of this type. 
The now-canceled Lance mis­sile, which was to replace an existing arsenal of 700 aging Lance missiles, would POt have been capable of reaching Soviet territory. 
Bush did not say he would withdraw any of the existing Lances, and Plesch said it was possible that NATO could agree to refurbish them to extend their useful lives.

WASHINGTON (AP) ­President Bush scrapped plans Thursday for newer and more powerful battle·

"As democracy comes to Eastern Europe and Soviet Jr9ops return home, th~re is need for nuclear systems

Bush made his announce­
ment at a wide-ranging news conferenee during which he also said "I sometimes do worry" that military hard· liners in the Soviet Union might oust President Mikhail · Gorbachev and try to reverse democratic reforms in East­
em Europe. 
It was Bush's most direct 
statement ever about Gor­
bachev's grip on power. 
Bush said Gorbachev is 
under "extraordinary pres-. 
sure" at home because of 
unrest over Lithuania's drive 
for independenee and the 
ailing Soviet economy. 
In a lighter moment, Bush defended his wife Barbara against complaints by Wellesley College students who oppose her as their graduation speaker. 
He said the students may be right in saying her recognition comes from his success. but deelared "these young women can have a lot to learn from Barbara Bush" anyway.

Ivan, 'Tm expecting company." "Not the devil, by any chance?" asks the holy man. "How did you know?" "Because I am the devil," replies the holy man. "Why do you look so surprised?" "I expected the devil to have a different appearance," stam­mers Ivan. The patriarch exclaims with a chuckle "Don't you realize all the press notices I have re­ceived were put out by my ene­mies?" Dostoyevsky gave us the story of a prisoner interned in a prison camp in Siberia. As a way of escaping from his grim, violent surroundings, the pris­oner starts to reflect on his past life. The memory of an August day, when he was a child, comes to mind. He recalls a hallucination in which he  spoke to him about the wolf or anything else, and all at once now, twenty years afterwards in Siberia, I remember this meeting with such distinctness. .. I remember the soft motherly smile of the poor serf, the way he signed me with the cross... if I had been his own son, he could not have looked at me with eyes shining with greater love. "And what made him like that? He was our serf, and I was his little master.... It was a solitary meeting in the de­serted fields, and only God, · perhaps, may have seen from above with what deep feeling and delicate tenderness the heart of a coarse, brutally ig­norant Russian serf may be filled..." Saint-Exupery wrote: "All grown-ups were once children-­ veil from his face, to lay it bare. But it would not have been given to me to discover anyone other than myself." For Saint-Exupery, God is simply "deus absconditus," a god who hides his face, the great silent one whom the mys­tics refer to as "the silent wilderness that is God." I'm too old to remember how God appears to the mind of the child whom Christ wants me to become like, but I think that as a child, I understood that adults have their space. This is especially so with God, who stood so close, I thought, I could feel His breath. But I was never tempted to make Him as small as myself. Only adults are tempted to make God in their own image. Often, the God we hear about from preachers and other be- countless drawings. Intrigued by Saint-Ex's doodling on the white tablecloth while at lunch in a New York restaurant, the publisher, whose guest he was, asked him what he was draw­ing. "Just a little fellow I carry around in my heart," Saint-Ex replied. The publisher looked closely at the little fellow and got an idea: "What would you think of making up a story about your imaginary Antoine, for a chil­dren's book?" The Little Prince echoes, among other "matters of im­portance" dear to Saint-Ex's heart, the importance of love, without which one is blind, as expressed in the desert fox's secret: "One sees only with the heart. The essential is invisible to the eye."  The Little Prince comes close to being E.T., the Extra-Terres­trial. Like E.T., he goes home to one of the trillion stars out in space. The way back to the lost childhood has always been through a child's garden of verses--as Robert Louis Steven­son, or E.T. or the Little Prince can show you, NOW THAT YOU'RE AN ADULT, for whom the stories of God have mean­ing. A trip to the far side of the garden and back could clear your head of the looney-tunes that you've been clinging to as a religion, like the preachers whose guardian angels have lost sight of God's face. Happy summer! Darby O'Gill and I never said we didn't love you!

four well played games on April 28-29. 
"We did not play exceptionally well against Xavier earlier this season," said Murphy. "Xavier has the type of pitchers that can give you problems with all their knuckleballs, especially since we're a young team. But we did what we had to do to win." 
The Detroit matchups will be a tough challenge for the Irish, especially since Notre Dame swept the Titans last time. Detroit, tabbed by Murphy as "the best team talent-wise in the conference, no question" returns almost all of its players from last year, a team that beat the. Irish seven out of 11 times last season. 
"We have to keep focused be­cause Xavier and Detroit are sitting back after we've boaten them, and they're just going to come out here and play base­ball. That's the best thing you can do," said Murphy. "I think our kids will react, that they

will be thinking baseball and concentrating on their perfor­mances. If they do that, the wins will take care of them­selves." 
Since these arc all MCC con­tests, Notre Dame could do nothing better for itself than to dominate the conference in the hopes of receiving an at-large bid to the NCAAs. 
"I think we should go (to the NCAAs), no question," said Murphy. "Our freshmen are getting better and better. If anyone saw the adversity we've been through this season, we have not missed a beat. We've had 28 one-or two-run ball­games, and we're 20-8 in those games." 
Perhaps the biggest disap­pointment of the season came when the game with Illinois was rained out on March 31 in front of a national audience. ESPN televised the game, in whieh the Irish jumped to a quiek 2-0 lead before rain came pouring down to dash any hopes of tire Irish defeating a top-20 team this 
season. 
Besides the goal of reaching the NCAAs, the baseball team would do well just to finish the season on a positive note. Murphy's slogan for this year, "One More Step," was coined in the hopes of building on the program's credibility, which just three years ago was a team that lost to teams like DePauw and Bethel. Sinee Murphy has been coach, tlw DePauws and the Bethels of the schedule have been replaced by nationally contending teams like Miami and Texas. 
"We're looking to make that one more step," said Murphy, "to make the commitment and have the players mature and grow up as baseball players. The will is the key, to prepare and to get better. If we do that, that's one mom s "

Propp lifts Bruins over Caps 
Boston comes from behind to defeat Washington 5-3 
-~~-~-~--------~-----~~ -~­

BOSTON (AP) -Brian Propp broke a tie with 5:22 left as the Boston Bruins scored three straight goals in the final period for a 5-3 victory over the Washington Capitals in the opener of their Stanley Cup semifinal series Thursday night. 
Propp, 30 feet in front of the goal on the left side, passed the puck across ice to Cam Neely. Neely immediately sent it back to Propp, who fired the puck from 15 feet over goalie Mike Liut's stick to break a 3-3 tie. 
It was the fourth goal of the playoffs for Propp and second assist of the game for Nealy, who also had a goal. Dave Poulin added an empty-net goal with 15 seconds left, his second of the game, as the Bruins rallied from a 3-2 deficit. 
The second game of the best­of-7 Wales Conference final is scheduled for Boston Saturday night. 
Boston, which had the NHL's best regular-season record, won its seventh straight home game. Washington, whose 36­38-6 record was 13th best, had its four-game winning streak snapped. 
Poulin had tied the score at 
1:05 of the third period. Randy Burridge passed the puck from the left corner back to Dave Christian along the left boards. Christian fired it across to the right corner of the crease, where Poulin tipped it in. 
Washington's Kelly Miller, who failed on a first-period penalty shot, had broken a 2-2 tie with a shorthanded goal with 2:21 left in the second. 
The unassisted goal after a bad pass from Boston's Ray Bourque came 1:21 after Washington's John Tucker tied the score on an unassisted goal set up by goalie Andy Moog's bad clearing attempt. 

The Bruins led 2-1 after one period on goals by Garry Galley and Neely. Washington's John Druce got his 13th goal of the playoffs and seventh on a power play. 
A seemingly harmless shot by Michal Pivonka from just in front of the red line led to Tucker's goal. Moog saved the shot, then tried clearing it by lifting it with his stick. 
Tucker caught the puck in the right circle, dropped it to the ice and fired a five-footer from the right for his first playoff goal. 
Miller got his third 34 seconds after Washington's Rob Murray was penalized for high-sticking.

department not to renew the contract of soccer coach Dennis Grace was big in that Grace led the Irish to a 76-38­14 record during his six years at the helm and their first-ever NCAA Tournament berth. His replacement will be hard­pressed to equal or better those marks. 
5. 
The women's basketball team did everything it could, but that was not enough. A 23­6 mark and 18-0 in the weak Midwestern Collegiate Conference did not secure a berth for the Irish in the NCAA Tournament. The fact that a team can have such a success­ful season and then be denied a tournament berth makes this a top five story.

Leahy learns ropes as rookie 

By MIKE KAMRADT Sports Writer 
Notre Dame pitcher Pat Leahy has a rich and storied athletic tradition in his family. His grandfather, Frank Leahy eoaehed the Irish football team to four national championships between 1941-19 53 and his dad played football for Notre Dame. 
Pat himself was a three-sport star in high sehool with schol­arship offers for his services as a pitcher, tight-end and for­ward in basketball. Leahy was also drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays. As an 18-year old, Leahy facod a lot of tough deci­sions. 
"It (the deciding process) was tough, but I made it harder than it really was," said Leahy. "I was trying to weigh every­thing, asking what-ifs." 
The 6-7, 245 pounder chose college baseball and it's a good thing for the Irish that he did. His 91 mile-per-hour fastball and excellent breaking ball make him a great addition to the Irish pitching staff. 
"He was very heavily re­cruited, but we had the inside

track because his dad knew Notre Dame inside and out," says Pat Murphy. "But Pat him­self knew what Notre Dame was all about as far as the edu­cation Md the program." 
"It was the tradition that helped me make the decision," says Leahy.'' "Baseball was definitely something I wanted to do and the last couple of years under coach Murphy the baseball has improved." 
Like any highly recruited ath­lete, there are a lot of expecta­tions of Leahy. 
He's had a lot of pressure on him," explains Murphy. "Everyone always asks, 'how's

the Leahy kid?'" 
Leahy was expeeted to step in and start as the Irish were only returning two starters from 
last year's 48-19 squad. Besides that pressure, Leahy was tabbed as the preseason MCC Freshman of the Year by Baseball America .. Leahy hasn't been fazed by all the attention that has been heaped on him, though. 
"I really didn't pay attention to it," said Leahy. "The best thing to do was to start over. I felt it was most sensible to start at the basies. In a way it has been a little difficult at times," Leahy continued. "I've had the typical freshman ad­justment period where the en­tire world is in a spin." 
Unlike many superstars out of high school whose egos are higher than Mt. Everest, Pat Leahy is a down-to-earth, mod­est guy. 
"lie's a warm hearted person who expects to be successful," says Murphy. "lie has to learn to be more patient, though. When you're extremely bright, competitive and young like he is, patience isn't always in the vocabulary. !lis biggest eritic is himself. He needs to relax a lit­tle more and realize you're not always going to have a good outing." 
Although Leahy is 6-0 with a dazzling 2.15 EHA in 67 innings along with 61 strikeouts, there have been times where he has struggled a bit. Against Detroit last Saturday, he walked six in a five-inning winning perfor­manee. Wednesday he struggled through three innings against Valparaiso. 
"When I don't pitch well, I can't even look myself in the mirror," said L(~ahy. "That I'm hard on myself is good because I'm never satisfied, but it's bad because I tend to dwell on things too long. I don't always just think about it, learn from it and forget it." 
One of the things that has made Leahy so suecessful this season is his desire to learn Murphy's pitching plan. 
"It's  been  a  pretty smooth  
adjustment  in  that  respect,"  
Leahy said.  

"lie's learning but he has a long, long way to go," adds Murphy. 
Leahy realizes where he need to improve himself to become a dominant pitcher. 
"By far it's the mental aspect," he said. "I need to have better focus. I have to be able to turn on the focus button when I need it and turn it off when I don't." 
No one can argue the fact that Leahy has been a big rea­son for the sueeess of the Irish this year. With more experi­ence, his two-hit shutout earlier this year against Saint Louis will become routine. In addi­tion, Murphy plans to take ad­vantage of Leahy's tremendous potential as a hitter next year once he is comfortable in his

Former walk-on Lund now a leader behind the plate 

By SCOTT BRUTOCAO 
Assistant Sports Editor 

How many people know that the captain of the Notre Dame baseball team was a walk-on? 
The Irish team. filled with freshmen and sophomore re­cruits who ooze with talent and anticipate potential pro ca­reers, is captained by a player who was not asked in any way to play baseball for the Fighting Irish. 
That former freshman hope­ful is senior catcher Ed Lund, the cornerstone of this year's team. 
"People forget that Ed Lund was a walk-on player at Notre Dame and that he just fell in love with the game," says third­year coach Pat Murphy. "He was put into catcher, a position he wasn't used to. and has done an outstanding job." 
This versatile athlete played outfield at St. Francis lligh School in Pasadena, Calif., although catcher has always been his first love. When he came to Notre Dame hoping to make the baseball team, he tried out at every position. 
"I came in here just hoping to make the team. so I tried out everywhere," says Lund. "I al­ways loved catcher, a position I've always wanted to play. You're in on every pitch, block­ing balls at the plate. I like ev­erything about catching, and I think that's what I do best." 
The pitching squad's statis­tics can attest to that. The team earned run average stands at 2.86, the fourth-low­est in the country. Three of the five main starters on the team are freshmen, and Lund's expe­rience has helped them in their process of maturation. 
"It has been extremely impor­tant to have a catcher behind the plate to have so much expe­rience," says Murphy. "The pitchers feel so confident with Ed Lund back there. That really helped the team, especially in the beginning of the season. He's like the Rock of Gibraltar back there." 
The Irish pitchers echo Murphy's sentiments. Freshman Dave Sinnes, who is leading the nation in ERA at 
0. 73, has nothing but compli­ments for the senior leader. 
"His presence behind the plate helps me concentrate and

focus a little better," says Sinnes. "If I make a bad pitch he'll let me know about it, and he gives that extra help that comes from being a senior and a great leader." 
Lund's experience reaches further back than the Murphy's winning tradition. Lund played his freshman year under former coach Larry Gallo, when the Irish went 15-29 for a .341 winning percentage. Since then, under Murphy Notre Dame has compiled a 123-51 record, or a .707 mark. 
In other words, Lund has seen it all. 
"It has been advantageous for us (the seniors) to see how far we've come," says Lund. "We know how it is to lose and not to get the best out of our ability, and maybe that's our jobs as seniors to say this is the way it's got to be or it will be like it was. 
"The better way is to put in everything you can and get the most out of it. If you're going to put this much time in. you might as well go all-out to make it worth it." 
"My expectations have defi­nitely changed since my junior year," says Lund. ''I'm hoping to get drafted and play in pro­fessional ball. That's what I've wanted since my junior year, but right now, I can't worry about that. That is out of my hands. Right now I'm worried about this team. I want Notre Dame baseball to do as well as it can." 

The team is on track to do just that, which at 36-10 has a shot at the NCAA tournament. Lund himself is batting .294 with four home runs, 24 RBis and a team-leading 12 doubles. His on-base percentage is .441 and he has swiped 11 bases this season. 
One more aspect of Lund's game deserves mention, and that's his cannon on his right shoulder. The Irish have stolen 111 bases this season versus their opponent's 49, a testi­mony to other teams' respect for Lund's lightning-bolt arm. 
"It's quite incredible that other teams have run so little against us," says Murphy. "It's because of his outstanding rep­utation. I feel that he's going to be a solid pro player in the fu­ture. There's no question he'll be drafted." 
Having made great strides in baseball at Notre Dame, Lund hopes to keep the momentum rolling with a shot at the big leagues.

the past year. This is simply a 
composite of the top stories chosen by the executive sports 
staff at The Observer. 
Here are some of the reasons why the 10 stories in the 
center spread merit special attention. 
1. 
When Notre Dame lost 27-10 at Miami, it not only ended the 23-game win streak for the Irish, but it also cost them the national title. This was the most-hyped game of the year. While the game itself may not have lived up to those stan­dards, the end result regarding the national title makes this the biggest story of the year. 

2. 
Notre Dame made history with its five-year television pact with NBC. The network will broadcast 11ve years of Notre Dame football beginning in 1991. This turned into one of the biggest national sports stories off the field, with sev­eral members of the CFA publicly voicing their displeasure when the Irish strayed from the organization and its new contract with ABC. This may have longer lasting effects than the Miami game, but within the context of one year, the Miami story was bigger.
