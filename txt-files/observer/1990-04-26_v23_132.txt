Attacker arrested 
Student flags down police car

News Editor 
A 26-year old South Bend resident has been arrested and charged with criminal confine­ment following an early morn­ing incident on U.S. 31, accord­ing to Chuck llurley, assistant dimctor of Notre Dame Secu­rity. 
A Saint Mary's student was walking north on U.S. 31 near the Angela Boulevard intersec­tion at 3:15 a.m. Wednesday when she was attacked by a white male who emerged from some bushes beside the road, seized her, and tried to pull her towards the Burke Memorial Golf Course fence, according to Michael Garvey, assistant direc­tor of Notm Dame Public Hela­lions and Information. 
Her assailant proceeded to strike her once on the face be­fore she broke free and man­-aged to flag down a St. Joseph County police squad car. The squad car and other units pur­sued the suspect south on U.S. 31 and apprehended him at the intersection of U.S. 31 and An­gela Boulevard, according to Garvey. 
Seargent Charlie Fierrell of the St. Joseph County police said that criminal confinement is like "kidnapping." He said the charge is essentially holding someone against her will. This charge is a Class D felony. 
"It will be 72 hours before he can post bond," said Fierrell.

Sacred Heart to open in autumn

Sacred Heart Church will reopen when students come back for the fall 1990 semester, according to Don Dedrick, director of the physical plant. 
"It has been a difficult job and a long job, but with ev­eryone's patience it will be done in the fall," said Dedrick. The job was very extensive and included the addition of an entire new slate roof to a new sound system. The total costs for the project will approach $6 million, he said. 
One important improve­ment is the new air condi­tioning system, he said. 
"Now, if we can control the 

.......................... 
heat in the Church, the Gre­gori paintings won't deterio­rate as quickly," said Dedrick. He said the past condition was a very tough environment for that kind of painting. They completely redid the Gregori paintings. 
Also, the stained glass will be completely renovated and restored. The stained glass was created by the Carmelite sisters. The 42 large, stained glass windows contain 114 life-size figures and 106 smaller figures. "It is the most extensive and valuable system of stained glass in the world," said Dedrick. 

In addition to the stained glass, Sacred Heart Church, constructed in 1871, con­tains 45 murals that include 244 ligures. 
Other improvements to the Church include the addition of all new pews, all new car­peting, insulation in the at­tic, copper gutters, new sta­tions of the cross frames, and a lire detection and sup­pression system. 

O'Hara to replace Tyson as Vice Pres. of Student Affairs 
By JANICE O'LEARY 
Associate News Editor 
Patricia O'Hara, associate professor of law at Notre Dame, has been rncommended to tlw Board of Trustees for appointrm~nt as vien president of Student Affairs. 
Her appointment is effective .July 1, the date when the cur­rnnt viee president for Student Affairs, Father David Tyson, assumes the presidency of the University of Portland. 
University President Father Edward Malloy said he had re­ceived approval from the Board's nominating committee to put O'Hara's name before the full board at its meeting on campus on May 4. "I have per­sonally contacted each trustee, and I am confident the ap­pointment will be enthusiasti­cally approved by the Board," he said. 
O'Hara said she is "honored 
by the nomination" and that 
she is looking forward to 
working with the students. 
"I have tremendous respect for what Father Tyson has done," O'Hara said. "My basic goal is to steer in the same di­rection and move forward." 
As vice-president of Student Affairs, O'Hara will be, for all practical purposes, the first female officer at the University of Notre Dame. 
However, in May 1971 Sister 
M. Alma Peter, C.S.C., the acting president of Saint Mary's College, was appointed vice president of Notre Dame in an­ticipation of a merger between Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. The merger was called off and Sister Peter was never really served in this capacity, accord­ing to Hichard Conklin, director 

Patricia O'Hara 
of Public Helations and Infor­mation. 
"I think it is wonderful for \1alloy to appoint women to key positions and I look forward to the challenge," O'Hara com­mented. 
The primary attraction of the position for O'Hara is the stu­dent contact. Student life and values are very important out-

side of the classroom, she said. 

A native of San Francisco who earned her B.A. at the Uni­versity of Santa Clara in 1971, O'Hara was a Kiley Fellow at the Notre Dame Law School, graduating summa cum laude and first in her class in 1974. She practiced corporate law for six years with the law firm of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison in San Francisco before returning to the Notre Dame Law School to teach in 1981, according to Conklin. 
O'Hara said she will continue to teach one course each semester. 
Her specialty is corporate and securities law, and she has published in the field, as well as participated iri a number of panels treating insider trading and corporate takeovers. She is a member of the California State Bar, the Federal Bar for the Northern and Central Dis­tricts of California and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth District, Conklin said. 
In 1986, she was selected by law students as the distin­guished professor of the year. O'Hara has served on several University committees, induct­ing those on the curriculum and on evangelism, pastoral min­istry and social values. She also served on a committee to review Moreau Seminary. Since 1988, she has been a member of the 
NCAA  Committee  on  In­ 
fractions, said Conklin.  
"Prof.  O'Hara has  won  the  

confidence of the University community both for her profes­sional contributions and her understanding of the core val­ues of the institution," said !'a­ther Malloy. 
Japan-America Society discusses cultures

News Writers  

At a panel discussion spon­sored by the Japan-America Society of Indiana, Dr. Jackson Bailey stated that "Our two so­cieties have become so inter­twined, that an immediate in­crease in cultural understand­ing is imperative." 
The Japan-America Society held the panel discussion Wednesday night in correlation with Notre Dame's "Year of the Family" and also presented a film entitled Japan 2000 -The View from Within. 
The panelists included Bailey. the director of the Institute for Education on Japan at Earlham College, Dr. Barbara Ito, the director of East Asian Studies at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Dr. George Wilson, director of the East Asian Studies Center at Indiana Uni­versity-Bloomington, and Dr. Jimmy Wheeler, director of Economic Studies at the Hud­son Institute. 
Each panelist addressed dif­ferent aspects of individuals' lives in Japan, and suggested potential future directions for the economy, society, and the family. 
Bailey,moderator of the panel discussion as well as a co-de­veloper of the Japan: 2000 tele­vision series, spoke first. noting that "over 100 Japanese firms have operations in Indiana, and many Japanese families live among us." These facts, Jack­

derstanding between  our  two  
peoples.  

lie noted that some racism exists amongst Amerieans to­wards the Japanese, partially a residual from World War II, but also as part of deeper cul­tural distrust. This racism threatens the relationship be­tween our two countries that has been so beneficial in the past. 
Ito discussed the rapid changes that have occurred in Japan over the past forty years. She said that "Japan previously had external models to help them shape society during peri­ods of change, but now society is breaking new ground." Change also happened more slowly in the past than it does

Printing rape victims' names 
not solution 
In February, the 
Des Moines Register 
printed a detailed ac­
count of a woman 
who had been ab­
ducted and raped. 
Although rapes are 
covered routinely by 
newspapers, this arti-Kelley Tuthill 
cle was different-the 
victim chose to have News Editor 
her name in print. 
This victim, a 29-year old mother, told the 
newspaper her story after Register Editor 
Geneva Overholser wrote a column saying 
that the media, by not running rape victim's 
names, only added to the stigma already at­
tached to the crime. 
I applaud the courage of this woman to 
come forward and tell readers about her 
horrible experience. This type of personal 
account allows others a glimpse into the 
painful healing process a rape victim must 
undergo. 
However, I could not support the idea that the names of all rape victims should be printed routinely. The role of the media, when reporting a rape, tries to warn the community of possible danger and print in­formation about the rapist so that individu­als with information about the crime might come forward, as Richard Conklin, director of Notre Dame Public Relations and Information said. 
I don't see how routinely printing the names of a rape victim could be a positive addition to newspapers. Would printing the name of a rape victim help destroy some of the stigmas attached to this horrible crime? If the public knew the name of the victim would they be any more compassionate to­wards her? I can't be sure, but I don't think so. By printing a victim's name, a newspa­per would only cause the victim, her family and friends more anguish. 
Newspapers do treat sexual offenses dif­ferently than other crimes, but for a good reason-to protect the individuals from further harm and embarrassment. Although I believe in this philosophy, I also agree with Overholser who says that we must talk 
more openly about rape. 
If women want to come to The Observer and tell about their experiences with rape or other sexual offenses, the news depart­ment would consider running their accounts including their names, if they choose. However, the news department will continue its policy of routinely protecting the anonymity of the victims of sexual offenses. 
By protecting the identities of the victims, I strongly believe that there is a better chance of women reporting rape. If news­papers decided to print the name of every woman raped, I fear that we will return to the days when women did not report rapes for fear that they would be treated more like criminals than victims.

Bush defends policy on Lithuania 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Presi­dent Bush, bitterly criticized by Lithuania, said Wednesday "I don't need any defense" for re­fusing to penalize the Soviet Union for its economic squeeze on the breakaway Baltic repub­lic. 
"The policies, decisions I've taken have had strong support from the American people, and that's who I work for," said Bush. The president did not re­ply whtm asked by a reporter how Lithuanians view his deci­sion. 
While Bush has won support from some congressional lead­ers for his strategy, there also were signs of restiveness Wednesday about the lack of a 
U.S. response. 
Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell said Bush should take some action "to express disapproval and to de­ter further actions" against Lithuania. 
He suggested slowdowns in U.S.-Soviet talks on the envi­ronment, taxes, investment or trade but also said Bush was in the best position to decide. 
For a second straight day, Lithuanian President Vytautas Lan?sbergis denounced Bush's refusal to curb economic ties with the Soviets in reaction to coercion of Lithuania. 

"Our people remember how they were abandoned after World War II ... relegated to the Stalinist empire. It just saddens us to see Western na­tions, especially the United States, being misled by the So­viet Union," Landsbergis said in a telephone call with mem­bers of Congress. 
"The Soviets are strangling (our) nation like a boa con­strictor," he said, referring to the mounting pressure from Moscow.

Panel talkson ordination 
By KEVALEEN RYAN 
News Writer 
In an effort to promote awareness of the plight of Catholic women, the Committee on the Notre Dame's Position on the Ordination of Women sponsored a panel discussion on "The Future of Women in the Church." 
This panel was designed to complement the forum Tuesday night in which Bishops William McManus and Kenneth Untener elaborated upon the position of the Church with respect to the ordination of women. 
Featured last evening to ad­dress this pressing issue was Rev. Sarah Webb Phillips, an ordained minister in the United Methodist Church; Cindy Geisen, a Catholic laywoman and 1980 Notre Dame graduate of the Masters of Divinity program; David Guffey, a member of the Congregation of Holy Cross and also a graduate of the Masters of Divinity Program, and, lastly, Mary Abowd, a senior in the Program of Liberal Studies. 
Commenting facetiously that this was her "one moment to change the course of Roman Catholic history," Phillips stressed the importance of the divine calling which can sum­mon all people from every reli­gion to devote their life to God. Her calling, in particular, was a distinct voice in her head which asked her to enter into a voca­tion which, after centuries of struggle, had only begun admit­ting women in 1956. 
Despite the lack of role mod­els in this field, she was finally brought to ordination by the Wesleyan approach to theology. John Wesley's quadrilaterals consist of four authorities to which appeal: Scripture, tradi­tion, experience and reason. 
Scripture, the first of the four norms, is essential to the proclamation of the ordination of women. Phillips quoted Phyl­lis Tribble in saying that the Bible is a "powerful testimony to the place of history in God's salvation history." 
God's original intention, said Phillips, for men and women in creation was companionship, not hierarchy. Along the same lines, Jesus opposed Jewish tradition acknowledging through his actions the "worth of women in the kingdom of God." 
According to Phillips, what

anchors theology 111 the history of the Church is tradition. She stated that although the actual ordination of women in rela­tively new, the idea, though largely repressed by a male­dominated society, has been around for centuries. Much of its history centers around the right to preach rather than who can serve sacraments. For Protestants, Phillips said, the proclamation of God's Word is equally as sacramental. 
"When God commends us to do a thing, it is the highest pos­sible evidence that we can do it." This theme from the 19th century revival movement de­fines the third authority for theology, experience. Thus, the fact that a woman can experi­ence a call from God is testi­mony to her ability to fulfil it. 
The final norm of the quadri­lateral, reason, does not hin­der, but supports, he ordina­tion of women. It led women to the conclusion that the "Church was being disobedient when it denied God's call to women," said Phillips. 
The second panelist, Geisen, addressed audience in the form of stories, a "litany a womens' experiences." She specifically demonstrated the pain women have experienced as a result of the Church's stand against or­dination. 
"I realized that the route of the pain for me was that once again the message became clear ... you, woman, are not created in God's image," said Geisen. 
She also stated that the ordi­nation of women are not on the distant horizon, but is a pre­sent reality not recognized by the institutional Church. Never­theless, they are ordained again and again in their everyday work. 
"I am a Homan Catholic priest," she said. 
The final panelist addressed the issue from her perspective as a student concerned about "the full personhood of women." Abowd stated that the second class perception of women in the Catholic Chureh is a direct result of the constant bombardment of male imagery with respect to God. 
For progress to be made in the institutional Chureh, a in­clusive perception of God must be adopted. According to her, God is "lie, She, and Neither."

now. This, she notes, has made many people nervous. 
She also said that things are no longer predictable in Japan. Conservative societal institu­tions, which have changed little since WWII, now are changing daily. Experiments are being tested in education and the workplace, much to the dismay of older generations, whom, Ito noted "are resisting change as the seeds of complacency," 
The main debate on this issue is whether the government should continue its policy of providing the majority of health care to the elderly or if that re­sponsibility should be shifted to the family, according to Ito. 
Wilson, the next speaker, dis­cussed the enormous changes that took place last year in Japanese politics. He says that women now possess enough in­fluence to constitute an impor­tant part of the voting public, and they are assuming a stronger role in politics, as represented by parliamentarian Doi, who heads the Japan's so­cialist party. This has forced big policy re-evaluations in Japan's ruling party for the past 40 years, the Liberal Democratic Party (LOP). 
Wilson noted that the LOP has "traditionally been very male based, with strong ties between the male politicians and male government bureau­crats." This has kept a very narrow policy scope on Japanese government agenda since WWII. Wilson said that women supporters fled the LOP after a series of scandals in 1989, involving disclosure of a reitl estate company buying in­fluence from the LOP. Now, he noted, a broader agenda has been embraced. 
Furthermore, Wilson said, that things are not so great with small Japanese industry. He said "As larger companies become more international, they are buying and assembling more parts elsewhere, in an at­tempt to be closer to their markets and also as a response to protectionist fears." These moves have put the squeeze on a sector of Japanese economy that once exemplified efficiency and productivity. 
Wheeler, in the final address of the evening, discussed two major problems with Japan's economy: the internationaliza­tion of its population and the restructuring of industry. One challenge facing the new gener­ation is that,"technologically, Japan has gone from a follower to the frontier. Once the fron-tier is reached, there is no Japanese products when they road." travel abroad, because they are 

Wheeler said that "as more so significantly cheaper in for­Japanese travel and live eign countries. Wilson argued abroad, they realize that things "It is not a matter of will the are not so great back home." Japanese consumer revolt, it is Many Japanese will stock up on a matter of when." 
The film touched on three of the modern problems for Japan which were brought up in the discussion. Women are partic­ipating in the workforce to a greater extent, and are increas­ing calls for equality. 
200,000 people resettle around Cherynobyl site 
Chernobyl (AP) Another 200,000 people will be resettled from areas irradiated in the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion in a $26 billion pro­gram adopted by the Soviet leg­islature on Wednesday, the eve of the fourth anniversary of the disaster. 
Many members of the legisla­ture, the Supreme Soviet, criti­cized the plan as inadequate to deal with the health, agricul­tural, economic and environ­mental aftermath of the Ukraine accident. Legislator Yuri Scherback estimated 250 billion rubles ($405 billion) are needed over the next ten years. 
Official reports say 31 people were killed when one of four reactors at Chernobyl caught fire and exploded April 26, 1986. Unofficial reports say 250 died. The blast spewed ce­sium, strontium and plutonium across much of the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Russia and sent a cloud of. radioactive gas around the world.

There are tentative plans for student victms of similar recent attacks in the area to have the opportunity to view the suspect in a police lineup on Friday, said Hurley. 
Both Hurley and Fierrell said that it was too early to com­
ment  on  whether this  attack  
was  related  to  other  recent  
campus attacks.  

"As the weather gets warmer you need to be aware of your personal security," said Hurley. He warned women to be careful about walking or jogging around isolated areas of cam­pus alone. 
up of the disaster and bungled evacuations, the Supreme Soviet endorsed a program drafted by the three affected republics and the central government for dealing with Chernobyl from 1990-92, Tass news agency reported. About 180,000 to 200,000 people still living in contaminated areas will be resettled. 
About 116,000 people were evacuated in the months after the accident, and some Soviet scientists and politicians have been campaigning since then for further resettlements. They say 4 million Soviets are living on contaminated land. 
Wednesday's resolution also provides for stepping up medi­cal aid to residents of the con­taminated zone and stabilizing radiation levels.

eight weeks from now, East Germans will make more money. pay fewer taxes and see some of tlwir savings triple in size.

Fruhling said that his "repressive policies" resulted in the disappearance of 700 people, 2,000 deaths, and thousands of others tor­tured and detained. 
The human rights organiza­tions established shortly after Pinochet came to power also forces Allouin to address the issue, as does the fact that the human rights abuses were "the issue whkh the opposition ral­lied around" to finally drive Pinodwt out of office. 
Fruhling said that Allouin's new government faces several dilemmas because of the crimes committed by the previous regime. One is the faet that the government must address the human rights issues for the reasons mentioned above. However, because Pinochet re­mains lumd of the military, ac­tion in resolving this issue might cause a clash between the military and the govern-

Although the commission has no formal powers, Allouin hopes that the report will "punish morally those who committed crimes" by making the crimes public. 
Fruhling said he is not sure whether the government will bring cases to trial or give amnesty for all crimes commit­ted between 1978-1990. lie said that he "fears" Allouin will grant amnesty after the results of the commission's report are published. 
Neglecting past human rights abuses "is a policy which will fail," said Fruhling, bee a use the new government "will command less moral respect than one which faces the question of bringing out the truth." 
Fruhling said that "the issue of human rights should be dealt with in a short time span," as quickly and nffectively as possi­ble. 
When ask1~d how far the any investigations can go, Fruhling said that they "cannot go too 
far," especially because "Allouin does not have a major­ity in Congress." lie said any­thing leading to a convietion of a crime before 1978 would "be seen as unfavorable," primarily by those effected most by such convictions, namely those in Pinochet's military government.

Chamorro sworn 1n 
11 year Sandanista rule ends 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -Violeta Chamorro took the presidential oath Wednesday, ending 11 years of leftist San­dinista rule in Central Amer­ica's largest country. She im­mediately proclaimed a political amnesty and ended the military draft. 
"This blessed Nicaragua, in­stead of burying its sons in a fratricidal war, will bury its weapons forever, so the cannon will never roar again," Chamorro told a crowd of 20,000 inside a Managua base­ball stadium. 
Despite the conciliator) words, the atmosphere at thf downtown stadium where the inaugural was held was often rowdy and divisive. 
Spectators on the Sandinista side hurled water balloons at Chamorro as she entered the stadium. and one splattered her skirt. Outgoing President Daniel Ortega and his wife, Rosario Murillo, were pelted with watermelon rinds tossed by United National Opposition partisans as they made their entrance. 
The transition follows nine years of a U.S.-backed insur­gency in which 30,000 people died. Chamorro inherits a le­gacy of suspicion and distrust, a nation of 3.5 million residents that resembles an armed camp and an economy shattered by the U.S. trade embargo and rampant inflation. 
The inauguration of Chamorro, a conservative elected in February, brought immediate resumption of U.S. aid and trade assistance. 
Ortega lashed at the United States-which backed the Con­tra rebels -for supporting an "unjust and cruel war." He promised to lead a constructive opposition and said if civil war broke out again, "the elections would have been for nothing." 
Chamorro said Gen. Hum­berto Ortega, former President Ortega's brother, will head the 
army but that she would as­sume the post of defense minis­ter to "direct personally the processes of demobilization and demilitarization and to put an end to the war." 
She said she would order Gen. Ortega to establish a plan to 
reduce the size of the Sandin-...~,.....,...,..,.....,,_...-~ ista army and got her b cheer when she decreed an e 
to the extremely unpopul draft. She added that draftees already in service would be re-~·---NII~~~~ 
leased early. 1 
Chamorro also said she would grant "a wide and un­conditional amnesty" to those responsible for political crimes. 
The Ortega appointment drew objections from Chamorro's al­lies in the UNO, a coalition of 
14 parties, and in the Contra movement. 
At least two top prominent anti-Sandinista leaders said they wouldn't serve in Chamorro's Cabinet because of the Ortega appointment. Gilberto Cuadra, president of Nicaragua's most influential business organization, had I been slotted as minister for construction and transporta­tion; Jaime Cuadra, unrelated to Gilberto, had been desig­nated agriculture minister. 
Dignitaries from 83 coun-I tries, including Vice President Dan Quayle, and nine interna­tional organizations attended the inauguration. Also present were members of the Sandin­ista Cabinet and high-ranking officers of the Sandinista army. 
Envoys of nations that had! been on unfriendly terms with [ the Sandinistas entered the stadium to catcalls, boos and insults. El Salvador's rightis1 president, Alfredo Cristiani. and Quayle were greeted with chants of "Assassin, assassin." 
Quayle carried a letter to Chamorro from former Presi· dent Reagan, who told her thal "with your assumption of the presidency, the people ol Nicaragua can live in hope. Their freedoms can be restored. Their dreams and aspirations can be met." 
Quayle brought symbolic gifts

importing of such staples as

He also brought word that President Bush has approved $2.5 million in medical supplies, signed a formal declaration saying Nicaragua is no longer a Marxist-Leninist country, re­stored its quota for sugar ex­ports to the United States and made businesses wishing to in­vest in the country eligible for low-cost government loans. 
Quayle called Chamorro's in­auguration "the miracle of Managua." 
In her speech, Chamorro said she would ask the National Assembly to "repair injustices committed" by seizure of prop­erty under Sandinista rule, but added that peasants will be guaranteed title to property re­distributed under the Sandin­ista agrarian reform program. 
She also said economic con­
trols would be lifted in an ef­

by the Sandinistas.

Princeton students end occupation 
PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) Princeton University students ended a 32 1/2-hour occupation of President's Harold Shapiro's office Wednesday after officials agreed to expand programs dealing with sexual harassment and assault. 
University officials refused to meet the specific demands of the 30 students who invaded the office early Tuesday. But they agreed to devote more re­sources to expand the pro­grams to include graduate stu­dents. 
If the counseling center needs more staff to do so, the univer­sity will provide it, Vice Presi­dent Thomas Wright said in a statement. 
The students had demanded that center staff be doubled to three full-time therapists. 
"The administration is de­lighted that we've resolved this issue without violent confronta­tion ... without having to result to the use of force," said Princeton spokeswoman Jacquelyn Savani. 
The university also agreed to create a task force to design the new programs, and to hold a forum in the fall to address the center's needs. 
The protesters say 208 stu­dents sought counseling at the center during the 1988-89 aca­demic year, up from fewer than 50 the year before. 
Wright had said Tuesday that the administration could not increase funding for a program in the middle of the school year. 
He told the students to follow formal channels and appeal to the Priorities Committee, which meets in the fall and makes budget recommendations for the following school year.

Proposed Israel government fails Women deem men 
JEHUSALEM (AP) -Labor Party leader Shimon Peres said Wednesday he failed in his at­tempts to form Israel's next government. 
Peres had been trying to put together a new governing coali­tion since his center-left party engineered the collapse of a Labor-Likud government on March 15. 
Peres' decision to abandon his attempts came after a key prospective defector from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc said he would stay with Likud in spite of Labor's efforts to lure him into a coalition. 
"I have decided to go to a Likud-headed coalition," Eco­nomics Minister Yitzhak Modai announced in a nationally broadcast Israel Television in­terview. 
Modai blamed Labor's nego­tiating team, which he said tor­pedoed his agreement with Perns and other party leaders. 
I lis statement ended two days of intensive negotiations with both Peres and Shamir and brought Israel's two major parties back to square one of their political deadlock. Each

controls 60 seats in the 120­member Parliament. 
Shamir's 15-month Cabinet fell last month over Likud's re­fusal to accept a U.S. formula for arranging Israeli-Pales­tinian peace talks. 
Peres had a Thursday mid­night deadline for presenting a government. He told reporters he will give back his mandate to President Chaim Herzog.

women rated men negatively on 
their egos, libidos and domes­
ticity. Sizable minorities went 
further: 42 percent, for in­
stance, called men "basically 
selfish and self-centered." 
Prurience took a particular 

pounding. Fifty-four percent of 
the women who were surveyed 
agreed that "most men look at 
a woman and immediately think 
how it would be to go to bed 
with her." In 1970, 41 percent 
had agreed. 
The survey, financed by Philip 

Morris USA in the name of its 
Virginia Slims cigarettes, was 
conducted July 22 through Aug. 
12 by in-person interviews with 
a random sample of women 
across the country. It had a 
margin of error of plus or mi­
nus 2 percentage points. 
Respondents overwhelmingly 

said women have made 
progress in obtaining job op­
portunities, equitable salaries 
and acceptance as political 
leaders. But they also ex­
pressed greater awareness of 
continuing discrimination. 
Moreover, six in 10 working 

women said juggling jobs and 
families put them under "a lot 
of stress," and nearly as many 
felt guilty about time they 
spend at work and away from 
their families. 
"Their frustration comes out 

of trying to be superwomen," 
said Ellen Merlo, a Philip Mor­
ris vice president. "Women are 
handling so many aspects of 
life -trying to achieve success 
in careers, wanting to be a wife 
and a mother, run a home, and 
do it all well. It's a lot for any­
one to handle." 
Because men traditionally 

have escaped most household 
and child-rearing duties, Merlo 
said, "The frustration is ex­
pressed in hostility toward 
men. Women are looking to 
men for more support. And 
definitely their attitude toward 
men has turned somewhat 
sour." 
The second-greatest cause of resentment in survey respon­dents' lives was their mates' failure to help with household chores, cited by 52 percent. Only money was a greater cause of woe. 
"As women contribute more to family income, they expect a more equitable division of the household responsibilities in return," the survey said. While many men acknowledge re­sponsibility for household work, it added, "Women indi­cate that men are failing to live up to this ideal, and that their failure is a major source of ir­ritation." 
But diapers and dishes arc by no means the sole problem: Many women in the survey ex­pressed negative views of men's attitudes as well as their behav­ior. Among the findings: 
-Fifty-eight percent of women agreed that "most men think only their own opinions about the world are impor­tant." That was up from 50 percent in 1970. 
-Given the statement, "Most men find it necessary for their egos to keep women down," 55 percent agreed, up from 49 percent 20 years ago. 
-Fifty-three percent agreed that "most men are interested in their work and life outside the home and don't pay much attention to things going on at home." That was up from 39 percent in 1970. 
The poll found similar in­creases in sensitivity to sexism.

NCAA looks to up studies 
OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -NCAA president Albert M. Witte said Wednesday that a consensus was growing among the organization's officials to limit the time demands sports place on student-athletes. 
"I think the consensus is to make the life of the athlete more like the life of the stu­dent," Witte said as the NCAA Council wrapped up its spring meeting. "So the quest is to find ways and means to do that." 
Witte said sports are becom­ing an "almost year-round ac­tivity" that leave students little time to study. 
"Time demands on students rarely received meaningful dis­cussion until this year," Witte said. But he said the issue was gaining momentum now. 
At its annual convention last year, the NCAA voted to reduce

The 46-member council, a policy-making group for the NCAA, received reports with recommendations from confer­ence commissioners and special committees. 
Among the issues were re­structuring athletic divisions, reducing costs of college athlet­ics and reducing the time ath­letes are required to dedicate to their sports. 
Witte said the reports would be circulated among NCAA members and the council would meet again in August to en­dorse specific proposals for the organization's convention next year.

Fencers extol honors in-year-end banquet 
By CHRIS ALLIO Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame fencing team reflected back on the past sea­son and honored their finest last night at the year's annual banquet. 
Though they finished third overall as a team in the NCAA's last March, the Irish fencers have quite a bit to be proud of. 
Senior Joel Clark, the foil captain for the past two years, was the recipient of the Scholar-Athlete Award pre­sented by the St. Joseph's Valley Club, as well as the Most Valuable Player award for the foil squad. Senior captain Anne Barreda was the female winner of the former award. 
"Being a part of the Notre Dame fencing team for four years has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life," said Clark. 'Til never re­gret my decision to come here." 
Sophomore Jubba Beshin and Heidi Piper were recognized for their outstanding performances this year as honorees of the Monogram Club's most valu­able players. 
Senior Kristin Kralicek was noted as the women's foil MVP in addition to receiving the Dit Langford Award, given to the

bats snap their 13-game win­ning streak. Freshman Erinn Kelly (0-1) went the distance on the mound for Notre Dame giv­ing up eight hits, walking four, and fanning four. The Irish, trying to put yesterday's loss behind them, are hoping to con­tinue their winning ways Saturday at 4 p.m. against St. Mary's and against Marquette at 1 p.m. s.nrlay.

fencer annually who best demonstrates a complete team commitment. 
Sabre captain Chris Baguer was chosen by his peers as that weapon's MVP, while Jubba Beshin was presented with the award for epee. 
"Jubba did something this year that I will always remem­ber," said assistant coach Mike Marx. "On the last day of NCAA's, even though the team's hopes of winning the title had be eliminated, Jubba still went out and fenced his heart out. He was determined to win the individual title. And that's just what he did. There's something to be learned from overcoming an obstacle like that." 
The John Criquilier Award for best scholar-athlete went to se­nior foilist Colin Gumbs, while sabreman Danny Yu received the Dan Mulligan award. 
The Walter Langford Award, which honors the great Notre Dame fencing coach, was pre­sented to <>enior Mark Gugel, a walk-on wl10 graduated from coach Yves Auriol's novice pro­gram. 
Head coach Mike· DeCicco also made special mention of formerly retired Supervisor of Athletic Grounds Harold Ben­ninghoff, as well as senior manager Mark Byrne. 
"I am very happy with the performance of this year's team, despite their finish," said DeCicco, whose team will begin practicing earlier in August. "This squad is very strong­willed and determined. And to those of you who may not be around next year with us, I will say this. If you come back to Notre Dame next season, this 
will  be  the  national champi­ 
onship  team.  I promise  you  
that."  

This year's squads are grad­uating only eight seniors, two of which may return to com­plete a last year of eligibility while pursuing a graduate de­gree.

for the winners. Scott Winsor was a force in the middle as well as he added seven points and 10 rebounds. Warren Pal­more's team-leading seven points for Scoregasrns included a tremendous stickback dunk on a rebound of a teammate's miss. 
Senior Bar continued to rip through the Bookstore field with a 21-11 triumph over Pittsburgh is Weak. Hay Flan­nery. who led Senior Bar with seven points and 14 rebounds, was quick to praise playrnaking point guard Tony Dill for his role in the team's success. 
"I think Tony Dill has played really well throughout the tournament," Glannery said. "llis intensity is unparalleled out there. lie's all over the court working hard, and even though he only scored two points today, when needed he can hit the jumper from the outside."

John Dowd and his investiga­
tors used records of calls in 
and out of the Heds' clubhouse 
early in the 1987 season to 
check into Hose's involvement 
with gamblers. Those logs re­
vealed that Paul Janszen, who 
claimed he placed bets for 
Rose, made 21 calls to the Heds 
manager in the locker room 
during the lirst three months of 
that season. 
Those logs also showed the 
personal and professional calls 
made to and from the locker 
rooms at Hiverfront Stadium. 
There were calls to agents, 
restaurants, wives and other 
players, including one from Ge­
orge Foster, formerly with the 
Heds and New York Mets, to 
Lance Parrish. who was at the 
ballpark with Philadelphia to 
play Cincinnati. 
The American and National Leagues have sent telephone logs sheets to each team. and switchboard operators must keep records of calls to and from both clubhouses and the umpires' locker room. 
Some teams that have auto­mated phone systems are mak­ing adjustments to comply. They are changing their sys­tems so that callers cannot by­pass the switchboard operators by directly dial extensions to reach the clubhouse. 
"I don't know of any prob­lems we've had so far," Levin said. 
The New York Mets are among the teams that previ­ously kept telephone logs. All calls from the home and visiting clubhouses had to go through a switchboard operator, who would record the call and place it. 
The last crackdown involving clubhouses came after the drug problems in Pittsburgh in 1985. After it was revealed that sev­eral undesirables had been in the Pirates' locker room at

the dribble to penetrate the gaps in the 2-3 zone defense employed by Peach's to get easy buckets inside. 
"That was the first time we had faced a zone," said Torn Veltz of C.J.'s. "If we continue to go against zones, though, I think we can penetrate and dump it inside and get some easy baskets as well as hit the 15-foot jump shot." 
With C.J.'s leading 16-13, the game suddenly turned around, however. Peach's scored a bas­ket inside and Steve Belles tried to knock the ball back up out of the hoop. He was immediately whistled with a technical foul. Peach's converted the free throw and scored on the ensu­ing turnover to tie it at 16-16. 
The teams battled back and forth until Torn Gorman banged home a layup for the win. 
In other games yesterday, powerful Adworks breezed past Fighting Kernals 21-13 as Jim Dolan scored seven points; Soul Sonic Force washed out The Good, The Bad and The Laun­dry 21-14 behind eight points by Dorsey Levens; and Gauchos got eight points from Dave Bose in a 21-17 win over Segue . 
The Bookstore Basketball Committee re-seeded the re­maining teams last night and set up a schedule and a bracket which will take the tournament up to Sunday's 3 p.m. final. 
Adworks was seeded first and will play Shoot or Get Off today at 5:30 p.m. This was not a great surprise, as Adworks has steamrolled all of its opponents to date and defending champion Malicious Prostitution, which was seeded second, has struggled a bit. 
"They really deserve it," said Jim Flynn of Prostitution.

Power outage in Toronto doesn't affect Blue Jays 
TORONTO (AP)-There was no power shortage at the SkyDome Wednesday night. 
While most of downtown Toronto was in darkness due to a transformer explosion, Kelly Gruber lit up the SkyDome. He went 4-for-5, including his ma­jor league-leading seventh home run, as the Blue Jays won their third straight, a 5-3 vic­tory over the Cleveland Indians. 
"Everything is falling in for me," said Gruber, who is 8-for­11 in three games against the Indians. "It's a combination of a couple of things. I'm not missing the pitches I should be hitting and I'm not wasting any swings on bad pitches." 
Athletics 4, Orioles 3 
BALTIMORE -Jose Canseco, who earlier hit a two-run homer, singled home the go­ahead run in the 12th inning and Oakland beat Baltimore. 
Carney Lansford drew a two­out walk from Kevin Hickey (0­1). stole second and scored when Canseco singled into the left-field corner on a 3-2 pitch. Canseco went 4-for-6, while the Orioles got a total of just three hits. 
Tigers 6, Twins 4 
MINNEAPOLIS Cecil Fielder drove home three runs and the Detroit Tigers beat the Minnesota Twins night for their first road series victory in nearly a year. 
The Tigers won two of three at Minnesota. They had lost 19 straight series on the road, go­ing 15-50 in those games, since winning a set in Chicago last May.

Mahoney attributes this to their success. 
"Our strong point is having played together in the past, be­cause we know each other's tendencies and abilities," she said. 
Untamed Lyons, who faces the number four seed Hoosier Lawyers today, beat Slow Mo­tion handily by the score of 21­
5. Meg Hobday from the Lyons squad, gave credit for the win to Maureen Nelligan, who went 9 for 12. 
"Maureen was a key to our win," said Hobday. "She was a point guard who controlled the game." 
Untamed Lyons made it to the Sweet Sixteen on one win, after getting their victory in the first round by forfeit. Their style of play was aggressive, with a number of steals pacing their win. 
"Three of the seniors have played together before, which helped a lot," Hobday said. "The key was our defense. We had a lot of fast breaks and steals." 
In a game cut short by an in­jury, the third seed C. J.'s Gals won over Smooth, Swift, and Sweaty by 17-6. During the second half, a player from Smooth, Swift, and Sweaty couldn't go on, and the team decided to end the game rather than continue with four play­ers. 
Liz Toohey, who scored five points for C.J.'s Gals, praised Mia Tettenhorn, a Saint Mary's basketball player, as a crucial factor in their win. 
"This game was the first we had played with Mia," Toohey said. "She really helped bring the ball down and was a big as­set to us. We had never played together before as a team, so this win was great for all of us." 
White Sox 5, Rangers 4 
ARLINGTON, Texas -Ron Kittle's two-run homer helped Chicago take an early lead and the White Sox held off the Texas Rangers, ending a four­game losing streak. 
Kittle put Chicago ahead 4-1 in the third inning with his sec­ond home run of the season. The White Sox added a run in the fourth on a balk by Bobby Witt (0-3) before Texas rallied. 
Brewers 1, Royals 0 
MILWAUKEE -Tom Filer and two relievers combined for Milwaukee's fifth shutout of the season and Dave Parker's first triple in two years helped the Brewers beat the Kansas City Royals. 
Mariners 5, Yankees 2 
NEW YORK -Brian Holman, making his first start since coming within one out of a perfect game, won for the third time in four starts, leading the Seattle Mariners over the New York Yankees. 
Edgar Martinez got three hits, including a two-run homer that capped a three-run seventh inning and put Seattle ahead 5­
1. Don Mattingly homered in the eighth for the Yankees, who have lost six of their last seven games. 
Holman (3-1), who lost his perfect game last Friday when Oakland pinch hitter Ken Phelps homered with two outs ih the ninth, ran into quick trouble. He walked leadoff bat­ter Steve Sax and Mel Hall tripled with two outs. 
But Holman did not allow an­other run in six innings. He gave up eight hits, seven of them singles, struck out seven and walked one. Mike Schooler got his third save. 
Expos 1, Astros 0 
HOUSTON -Tim Raines scored on a ninth-inning wild pitch by reliever Dave Smith, giving Montreal the victory over Houston. 

Raines singled with one out in the ninth and moved to third on a two-out single to right by Andres Galarraga. 
Galarraga moved to second on the first of Smith's two con­secutive wild pitches, but Raines was unable to advance on the play. But the second wild pitch hit in front of the plate and bounced by catcher Craig Biggio, allowing Raines to score. 
Steve Frey (1-0) was the win­ner. pitching a perfect eighth inning, and Tim Burke recorded his fifth save, pitching the ninth. 
Angels 3, Red Sox 1 
BOSTON (AP) Kirk McCaskill and two relievers worked out of constant trouble 
and the California Angels beat
the Boston Red Sox for their , second victory in seven games. 
The Red Sox loaded the bases three times without scoring and left 14 runners on base. They got 13 hits and four walks, but their only run came in the

McCaskill (2-0) allowed nine hits and two walks in five in­nings. He escaped bases-loaded jams in the first and fourth. Mike Witt relieved to start the sixth and Boston again loaded the bases, but Ellis Burks grounded into an inning-ending double play. Mark Eichhorn went 1 1-3 innings for his fourth save. 
Reds 12, Phillies 

Philadelphia -Mariano Duncan raised his average to .448 with three hits, including a three-run homer, and Todd Benzinger drove in three runs as the Cincinnati Reds routed the Philadelphia Phillies 12-7 Wednesday night. 
Cardinals 5, Dodgers 1 
LOS ANGELES -Bryn Smith pitched a seven-hitter for eight innings and delivered the first two runs with a double-play grounder and a bases-loaded single as the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-1 Wednesday night. 
Smith struck out two and walked one, and the only run he allowed was unearned in the eighth inning. The right-han­der, who signed with the Cardinals as a free agent last November after nine seasons with Montreal, ran his record to 2-2 despite having only four runs to work with in his previ­ous three starts this year.
