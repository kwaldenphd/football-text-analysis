Think of the Notre Dame student who made every attempt to protect his newly bought stereo from being stolen from his off-campus residence. 
He smuggled the sleek Japanese speakers 
through the back door at midnight, so nobody 
would see them. He kept the volume of his stereo 
set at a reasonable level most of the time, so 
nobody outside could hear it. And he bought a 
huge padlock for his bedroom door so nobody 
could get to his system. 
The secrecy, the attempts to stay inconspicuous 
and the padlock didn't help. The student placed 
the box which the stereo had come in at the end 
of his driveway with the rest of his trash. Some 
fellow walked by and saw "S-A-N-Y-0" written on 
the box, and three days later his new stereo system 
was gone. 
It seems not even padlocks and window bars 
are I00 percent effective in deterring burglars 
from cleaning a house out. If a criminal knows 
there's a pearl inside, he's likely to try to crack 
the shell. 
Having a stereo system taken from your room­
-speakers, amplifier, turntable and allaoes not 
happen very frequently on campus. Once every 
30 years, possibly. But it can and often does occur 
offcampus. Those ofyou who are dying to migrate 
to the Great Land of Freedom Beyond the Shadow 
of the Golden Dome, know well that life there is 
more than keg parties and no parietals. Living off 
campus entails much more. 
Right at the top of every off-campus student's list of realistic concerns is security. Sgt. John McCullum of the South Bend Police Department said he thinks the big problem right now is the student's lack of awareness on how to deal with crime. He said most students at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's have never put a great deal of worry into the subject of security. At home, the parents took care of locks and keys. In the dorms, the students are still In a protected environment. 
"Protected environment" is not a good way to describe the Northeast Neighborhood of South Bend: the area in which many Notre Dame stu­dents choose to live, the area hardest hit by break­ins. 
The police do what they can to clamp down on the shifty-eyed characters who prowl the area around the Five Corners, Notre Dame Avenue, Corby and St. Louis streets. Most of these suspi­cious types are under the age of 18 and are out in the alleys instead of at school. 
Most of these individuals can whip through a residence in five minutes or less and get every­thing they want, McCullum said. They know what they're after, they know where it is and they know how to get it out in a hurry. 
In short, students in this area are living in a crime zone. But still the crime is not so bad that it can't be prevented. 
The frequency of break-ins is not high at this time--the number of reports is normal for this time of year, according to McCullum. Off-campus students that fall prey to burglars are falling prey to their own ignorance. The police are willing to inform students on the ways to make their homes safer and more secure. 


Ways such as preparing for semester breaks, installing security systems, recovering stolen ob­jects, buying the right types of locks, and becom­ing part of a neighborhood watch program. 
Ways such as getting to know the neighbors and the police themselves, and learning how to become more comfortable in the neighborhood. Ignorance is the danger factor with off-campus security. 
Off-campus students have long argued that they are ignored by the University, student govern­ment, The Observer--and that they are hated by the community and the police. A change is needed in this attitude, 
By becoming more aware of how to deal with crime, and by making others aware of the circum­stances in which they live, off-campus students can help improve an otherwise difficult situation. 
Of course getting tough on burglars won't make them go away. But ignoring them won't either.

Chief of Lions Club for Lebanon kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut 
Associated Press 
BEIRUT, Lebanon -The top of­ficial of the International Lions Club for Lebanon and Jordan was kidnapped yesterday in Mos­lem west Beirut one day after an American educator was ab­ducted on his way to play golf. 
Police said three men armed with . silencer-equipped pistols and riding in a wine-colored BMW intercepted Lions Club governor Victor Kenou at 9:35 a.m. near the French Embassy compound on Rue Clemenceau. 
Two of the assailants forced Kenou out of his white Mercedes­Benz at gunpoint and bundled him into their car, police said. 
Kenou, 50, heads the 39 Inter­national Lions Clubs in Lebanon and Jordan. A Syrian-born Chris­tian, Kenou is a naturalized Lebanese citizen who runs a prosperous import-export busi­ness in both the Moslem and Christian sectors of the Lebanese capital, according to police and family friends. 
His wife, Rose, who lives in west Beirut told The Associated Press by telephone, "Contacts are under way at the highest levels to win my husband's release. I am hopeful." 
The Lions Clubs are among few social institutions still oper­ating despite Lebanon's I !-year­old civil war. 
Kenou's abduction, like the kidnapping of American educa­tor Frank Herbert Reed on Tues­day, was an apparent challenge to Syria, which sent troops into west Beirut in July in an effort to restore order and end the deadly anarchy spawned by warring Moslem militias. 
Police said they have no clues 
to either man's whereabouts. 
Reed, 53, director of the Lebanese International School in west Beirut was the first Ameri­can kidnapped in Lebanon in 15 months. A school associate said Reed has lived in Lebanon about eight years and converted to Is­lam. His wife, Fahima Dalati, was born in Syria. 
The kidnappers freed Reed's Lebanese driver a few hun~red yards from the headquarters of Syrian intelligence officers in charge of west Beirut's security plan, police said. 
A telephone caller claiming to speak for Islamic Jihad, a Shiite Moslem group espousing the teachings of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, claimed re­sponsibility for Reed's abduction and charged he was a CIA spy. 
Syrian troops, who have been deployed in Lebanon for a de­cade, pulled out of west Beirut during the 1982 Israeli siege and did not return in force until this summer. 
Islamic Jihad has claimed re­sponsibility for kidnapping four other Americans and four Frenchmen missing in Lebanon but has said it killed one ~f the Americans and one Frenchman. Their bodies have not been found. 
Most Westerners wete driven from west Beirut by a spate of politically motivated kidnap­pings in 1984 and 1985. 


Hetland appointed as new member of Saint Mary's Board of Regents 
By Katie Sullivan 
News Staff 
Rebecca Hetland, a senior at Saint Mary's has been appointed the College's new student regent by the Sisters of the Holy Cross. 

Hetland is an active member of the Board of Regents at the College and will participate in student affairs issues and con­cerns in addition to academic and development of -fiscal is­sues. 
"I was pleasantly suprised," said Hetland, when informed of her appointment by Saint Mary's President William Hickey. "They're a lot ofqualified women that could represent Saint Mary's. I am very honored and look forward to working with all the Regents," she said. 
In March of last y~r all Saint Mary's juniors received a letter asking them to consider apply­ing for the student regent posi­tion. "We received eight very qualified applications," said Sister Karol Jakowski, Dean of Student Affairs. "There weren't any who applied just for the sake of paddingtheir resumes, it was a quality group," she said. 
Jakowski said the applicants go through a series of interviews, and then recommendations are passed on to Hickey who in turn passes on his recommendations to the Sisters of The Holy Cross, who make the final appointment. 
Jakowski was notified Septem­ber 5, and the other seven appli­cants received hand delivered letters September 8. 
According to Jakowski, the stu­dent regent must be a person who can represent Saint Mary's well. She must be one who has demonstrated thrbugh leader­ship, an understanding of and appreciation for the Catholic character of the College, as well as it's women's and liberal arts 
dimension. "Involvement is the key credential," said Jakowski. "The more involved an applicant is the more qualified she is." She said Hetland fits that category quite well. 
In addition to being a member 
ofThe Board of Regents, Hetland 
is the Liturgical Assistant for 
Campus, Ministry, the Campus 
Ministry Commisioner on Board 
of Governance, a writing clinic 
worker and Editor of the Saint 
Mary's Literary Magazine, 
Chimes. 
As student regent. Hetland 
hopes to represent general stu­
dent opinions on issues and be 
sympathetic to the needs and 
wants of the student body. "I 
have a lot of faith in this College 
and I want to see it continue to 
be a forerunner among private 
institutions and women's col­
leges as a whole," said Hetland.

Tanker spills crude oil in the Delaware River 
Associated Press 
GIBBSTOWN, N.J. -A tanker spilled 150,000 gallons of crude oil into the Delaware River yesterday. The .coast Guard said it was a major spill. 
"The total environmental impact will not be determined until morning." said Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Aaron Daven­port of the Gloucester City Sta­tion. "It's a major oil spill." 
Late yesterday night. a I 0­mile oil sheen existed from the Commodore John Barry Bridge in Bridgeport to the mouth of the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia, Davenport said. The oil was expected to reach the New Jersey and Pennsylvania shores by this morning. 
The vessel, the Viking Osprey, was carrying 550,000 barrels of oil (a barrel is 42 gallons) and was docking at the Mobil Oil Co. refinery when the spill was discovered at 2:40p.m., Davenport said. The refinery is located across the river from Philadelphia. 
The vessel. which is regis-. tered in Singapore, was under contract to deliver the oil to the Mobil facility, said Mobil spokesman Edward Kolaloski. 
It was not known how the spill started, Davenport said. 
"It's quite obvious there's a hole in the ship somewhere. There's the possibility the ship touched bottom." Davenport said.

Egypt-Israel agree to meet for summit 

Associated Press 
CAIRO, Egypt -Officials an­nounced that the leaders of Is­rael and Egypt will hold the first summit meeting between their two countries in five years today after negotiators reached a last­minute accord on a formula to end a border dispute. 
The meeting between Israeli 
Prime Minister Shimon Peres and 
Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak is to take place in the 
Egyptian port city of Alexandria. 

They will meet less than I 2 hours after Israeli and Egyptian negotiators signed an agree­ment on international arbitration of their lingering dispute over Taba, a beach resort on the Sinai Peninsula. Mubarak had demanded a settlement on Taba before meeting Peres. 
Egypt's foreign minister, Es­mat Abdei-Meguid, said, "We hope that the upcoming summit between President Mubarak and Prime Minister Peres can end with positivity, which will help to push all efforts to reach a comprehen­sive and durable peace in the Middle East." 
He said the arbitration process itself would begin in about one month. 
Negotiating teams reached the agreement after days of intense discussions, including talks throughout yesterday. 
Mubarak's Cabinet unani­mously gave final approval to the agreement at about midnight yesterday. 
David Kimche, co-chairman of the Israeli delegation, said his government had also approved the document. 
Asked if the summit would be held today, Kimche said: "Yes. Prime Minister Peres Is arriving (today)." 
In Jerusalem, government sources said Peres was conven­ing his Cabinet for a pre-summit session at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. EDT) and would ny to Alexandria, Egypt's Mediterranean port, di­rectly afterward.

Utah senator donates left kidney to long-suffering diabetic daughter 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Sen. Jake Garn donated his left kidney yesterday to daughter Susan Garn Horne in what doctors called "an ex­tremely successful" operation that left the senator "proud and happy." 
"The best of our expectations have been met and everyone is fine," said Dr. Baird Helfrich, who transplanted one of Gam's kid­neys into the senator's 27-year­old daughter in a nearly six-hour operation. 
Another surgeon, Dr. Jan Spence, removed Gam's left kid­ney after a time-consuming inci­sion which extended from the senator's back to his left rib in the front. In an adjacent operat­ing room, Helfrich implanted the kidney into Mrs. Horne, a diabetic who suffers from kidney failure. 
"The senator is awake, has a bit of a grin on his face . . . He seems very self-satisfied, and happy and peaceful," Helfrich said. The doctor added that he had spoken to Garn at length in advance of the surgery about Gam's concern for his daughter and the senator's gratitude that he was able to donate the kidney. 
"He was proud and happy," Helfrich said ofGarn, a physically fit 53-year-old who new on the Discovery spaceship with a crew of NASA astronauts in April I985. 
Tim Sites, spokesman for Georgetown University Hospital, said later yesterday that both Garn and his daughter were in fair condition. 
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., said, "Needless to say, all our thowghts and prayers are with the Garn family. This is a most generous and coura­geous act." Dole said that two of Gam's sons could have donated a kidney to their sister, but that the senator felt it was his duty as a father to do so. "This is typical of Senator Garn," Dole said. 
Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., called Garn "a remarkable man, a man of courage." 
While the senator awaited the start ofthe surgery, Helfrich said, Garn conversed with his doctors about science and the senator's interest in the space program. 
"He indicated he had never been familiar with a hospital. He had been in his own home for $25," Helfrich recounted of his conversation with Garn. 
"Everything went well," Mary 
Thiriot. an aide to Garn, said fol­
lowing the side-by-side opera­
tions that took about six hours. 
"I am very happy and proud to be the donor," the Utah Repub­lican had -said as he entered Georgetown University Hospital. "Her mother carried her for nine months and I am honored to give her part of me." 
Garn interrupted his re­election campaign Tuesday to check into the hospital. 
Gam's operation, called a nephrectomy, was needed be­cause his daughter, Susan Rhae Garn Horne, has suffered since childhood with diabetes. 
Gam's doctors said the senator likely would be kept in the hospi­tal for at least a week, could drive a car and resume his campaign for re-election in three to four weeks, and even go jogging within a month. 
In juvenile. diabetes, the type Mrs. Horne contracted, the pancreas quits producing insulin and sugar builds up in the body's bloodstream. A victim needs one or more insulin shots a day to compensate. However, blood sugar levels still rise occasion­ally, and the kidneys attempt to filter excess sugar from the bloodstream.

Stories about suicide may cause teenagers to take own lives 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -News and feature stories about suicide, as well as television movies on the subject, seem to induce teen-agers to take their own lives, two new studies conclude. 
The research suggests that even well-intentioned examina­tions of the rising suicide rate can prompt troubled adoles­cents to kill themselves. 
Corrections 
The story about the Saint Mary's Board of Governance meeting in Tuesday's Observer listed incorrect hpurs for the However, experts are unsure what. if anything. the news media should change in their portrayal of suicide. 
"I don't think we should not tell the public that the suicide rate is going up. That would be ridiculous," said Dr. Leon Eisen­berg of Harvard Medical School. "Yet if this is fight. that may be some sort of stimulus to people who are thinking about it. I don't know what the solution is." 
Although the studies con­cluded that teen-age suicides in­crease after television news pro­grams or movies dealing with suicide, neither showed that the victims had seen the programs. 
Dr. David Phillips of the Uni­versity ofCalifornia at San Diego found that the nationwide suicide rate among teen-agers was 7 percent higher than usual following 38 television news and feature stories about suicide during the I970s. 
Dr. Madelyn Gould of Colum­bia University found that the number of teen-age suicide at­tempts in the New York City area rose significantly followinA three of four made-for-television movies about suicide that were broadcast during the fall of 1984 and winter of 1985. 
Both studies suggested that teen-agers imitate suicides they hear about on television. The reports were published in today's New England Journal of Medicine, along with an editorial by Eisenberg. 
After accidents, suicide is the leading cause of death among American adolescents between the ages of 15 and 19. Since 
1950, the suicide rate has tripled in this age group, and almost I, 700 kill themselves each year. 

Phillips' study concluded that "educators, policy makers and journalists may wish to consider ways of reducing public expo­sure to stories, both general and specific, about suicide." Gould's study saldo. "the presumptive evidence suggests that fictional presentations of suicide may have a lethal effect." 
"There is an implication that there should be censorship. I am very much opposed to that." said Charlotte Ross, executive direc­tor of the Youth Suicide National Center in Washington. 
In interviews, neither Phillips nor Gould advocated censor­ship. 
"I would be very upset ifpeople were to use my findings to pres­sure the news media to reduce coverage of certain kinds of stories," Phillips said. 
He suggested that news reports about suicides might in­clude mention of the finding that suicides often follow such coverage. This way, friends and relatives of potential suicide vic­tims, as well as despondent people themselves, could be es­pecially alert. 
Gould's study found that in the two weeks before three of the TV movies, there were 14 teen-age suicide attempts in the New York area. Afterward, there were 22. After another movie about suicide, however, there was no significant change. 
Two of the programs, includ­ing the one that had no apparent negative effect. were broadcast by CBS.

RASTA. We are Rally Against Starvation. Our efforts are directed toward African people. But now Rally Against Starvations has ben banned by the Notre Dame Ad­ministration, and we are confused. We believe our organization to be a good one, a humanitarian one, a Christian one. The goals of our group, whose members are both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students, are simple: We attempt to create awareness of the issue of African famine, and we directly fund long-term development, research and localized projects in Africa. 
Last year the Rally Against Starvation held twenty-three events: twenty-three community events. We hosted guest speakers, coffee nights, masses, folk 
Lora Naughton 
guest column 
concerts, movies, afternoon rallies on the mall, an African food night, a slide show, and a show of African arts. Members of Rally Against Starvation also visited high. school classes in order to generate atten­tion and enthusiasm for our campaign. Our final event was a three band concert, featuring Dallol, which alone raised 
$2,400. 
These cultural events were successful in both portraying hopeful images of Africa (for Africa is not a colorless land, but one rich in tradition and potential) and in raising money to send to our cho­sen project -nourishment training and development in Sierra Leone. The twenty­three activities enabled us to make a sig­nificant difference in the lives of the African poor. 

We realize that as humans we must make a resolution to care for fellow humans._We realize that as Christians we hav an obligation to serve others. Rally Against Starvation is an organization which supports our committments. Now, however, in the name of Rally Against Starvation we are no longer allowed to act. Our status as an official student or­ganization has been "permanently res­cinded." We are not to raise funds, we are not to use on or off campus facilities, and we are not to advertise in the Obser­ver or through any other means. 
The decision to ban Rally Against Starvation was madejointly by the offices of Student Activities and of Student Af­fairs. The July 3, 1986 letter from Joni Neal explains the reason as a violation of the University's alcohol policy and of the State Drug laws at the May 3, 1986 Rally Against Starvation concert. Security reports to have found evidence of alcohol use and of drug paraphernalia. The letter states that officers and members of Rally Against Starvation were among the violators, though no individuals have been charged, accused, or even con­fronted by Security. Rather, actions have been taken against the entire group. 
The letter goes on to say that any uni­versity organization, according to DuLac, must be consistent with the mission of the University as a whole, whether the mission be spiritual, moral, intellectual, cultural, social, or recreational. Ms. Neal wrote, "RASTA certainly was not operating within these guidelines." 
This bewilders us. The May 3 concert was a community experience. The music was music of peace. The break which Rally Against Starvation members passed through the crowd symbolized our com­mon bond with each other and with indi­viduals around the world. Our year-long efforts clearly show our dedication to the human mission. 
We are not denying Security's accusa­tions, though the violations were out of our immediate control. But we are an ex­tremely worthwhile interest made of caring, moral people. If there was a prob­lem we are willing to face it and correct it. To abolish an entire group, a sympa­thetic cause, is unjust. 
We are unsure of the future for Rally Against Starvation. Appeals are being made, and support is appreciated. We want to be able to act once again. We are surprised by and we sincerely regret the decision of the University, but our com­mittment still stands. Now we can only encourage you, too, to continue your in­dividual efforts in aiding African relief funds. Please remember Rally Against Starvation, for the cause is a special one and it needs special attention.

right to have clubs based on sexual ten­dency (where does that leave marriage, I wonder). It is against church as well as university policy to be homosexual. Why, I hear you ask? 
The answer to that is probably that it has no procreating dimension. Surpris­ingly, according to church position, nei­ther does rhythm-method hetrosexualtiy. Even more amazing, though, is that fact that celebacy has exactly as much procreating power as homosexuality. Are priests recognized by Notre Dame and the church? In the priesthood, it is cer­tain, a particular sexual tendency is re­quired -namely none. I wonder if these two stances are consistent. 
Why is the church so concerned with procreation and the general right to life (of those unborn)? You do not hear the church taking a stand on the issue of capital punishment in the context of the right to life. It's easy to say killing a child is wrong, but what about a blood-stained murderer? While Catholics tend to agree that abortion is wrong, they very fre­quently approve of capital punishment using the pathetic rationalization that murderers are no longer human. Very weak indeed! Regrettably, the pseudo­intellectual community at ND fits riglit into the trend. Semantics have a field day at ND. Wejust gobble it up. George Orwell called it "double-think." 
Unfortunately, the contradictions don't end there. The by now famous war­memorial drove home to me a possibly more disturbing double deal. The entire right-to-life theme is annuled by another church position: the church permits 'just" wars. There is, in fact, a rather strict def­inition of a 'just" war, but this is usually only invoked when the church is threatened. How the church can maintain so adamantly that abortion is wrong, while war is not necessarily, is something which I will probably never understand? Just think for a second! It is wrong to kill 
a  fetus,  but it is right  to kill  a  man  if  
certain abstract conditions arc met.  
Homosexuality  is  wrong  because  it  

lacks the procreative motive, we are told. But, strictly speaking. homosexualtiy is not sex at all (Webster's: Sex -the attrac­tion between the sexes) as only one sex is involved. Ifit is not sex then why should we expect procreation from it any more than we do from reading or playing foot­ball? Another interesting twist in the Ch_urch's stand is that if sex (for argue­ment's sake) then an innocent kiss must be deemed immoral unless accompanied by full sexual intercourse. But sex is ille­gal on this campus. 
Now many people have every really thought about homosexuality's place in the church? Not too many, I should think, and yet there are plenty willing to volun­teer the "fact" (?) that being gay is both unnatural and forbidden in the gospels ­right on! Show me whereJesus said being gay was unnatural. This task is not as easy as pointing to some spot where Jesus lauds marriage because

homosexuality is not the opposite of heterosexuality as I hope I have shown. One thing does come up frequently, though, if you look, and that is the com­mandment, "Thou shalt no kill!" 
It just doesn't make any sense. Jesus forbade killing yet the church permits it if the wind is right. while Jesus did not forbid homosexualtiy even though we arc told he did. Why is the church so hypocriti­cal? You don't know'? I'll tell you why: it is because we allow it to be. We never ask questions. We arc led like sheep. Roman Catholism is not commissioned by God but much more by expedience! 
People around here live under the illu­sion that a person who asks questions is necessarily evil. But I think I'm a pretty average guy. If I ask questions about the church I must be anti-Christian. On the contrary, the reason for my questioning is that I see a huge gap between Christian and Catholic and this I find both sad and infuriating. It is sad because many who don't know better are dragged down and infuriating because many (ND students for example) who should know better are dragged down also. I'm not out to bash Catholics. In fact I believe that we must be grateful to the civilizing innuence of the Church down through the ages. Nevertheless, I feel compelled to point to what I perceive to be inconsistencies in the teachings of the Church, not out of malice, but out of hope for a better future.

Star Wars undermines U.S./U.S.S.R. trust 
The original "Star Wars" was a wollder­ful fantasy about a dashing young hero. a beautiful princess and a ragged band of rebels who through luck. determina­tion and the power of the Force defeated the Evil t:mpire. The new Star Wars is fast becoming a nightmare as a man well into his seventies. his grey-suited supporters and a fighting force of the highest tech money can buy hope to defeat what they sec as an all too real Evil t:mpire. 
Adam Milani 
a closer look 
When Ronald Reagan unveiled his Stra­tegic Defense Initiative, instantly dubbed Star Wars, in March. of 198.3, it became the source of a great deal of discussion both in the West and in the Soviet Union. Would it work'? Were the Soviets trying to do the same thing'? Would it worsen the already strained relationship between the two superpowers-? I believe that concrete answers to all these questions exist. However. I do not believe that they will be easily found if the United States con­tinues to follow Reagan's secretive policy toward Star Wars technology. Instead, we_ should seek a lasting peace by working in conjunction with the Soviets in trying to develop a system that will finally make nuclear weapons, as Reagan expressed it, "impotent and obsolete." President Reagan's present stance toward the development of Star Wars technology is that the United States should perfect it first. and only then let the Soviet Union in on what we have found. This view can 
only force the Soviets into a position of more than their ordinary justifiable paranoia and will probably lead to an esclation of the arms race both sides claim they don't want. Our refusal to bar­gain over the SDI program only enhances the possibility of this happening. 
A further cost of this policy is that in our effort to adamantly refuse answers to any Soviet questions on Star Wars we are also preventing ourselves from an­sewring valid ones of our own. One that has not I teen adequately answered is the most basic one: "Are we capable of per­fecting this technology by ourselves?" Ac­cording to a report from the Congres­sional Office of Technology Assessment the prospects of this happening are "so remote that it should not serve as the basis for public expectations or national policy." This is understandable when one considers what Star Wars is trying to do: shoot down incoming enemy missiles from what will easily be hundreds, even thousands of miles away. There are several ideas about how this can be ac­complished. Most center around the firing of a laser or particle beam through space either from a satellite or from a ground­based system which would then be bounced off renecting mirrors in space. Laser technology is the most advanced, but it has the disadvantage of needing an enormous amount of energy. A satel­lite based sytem would require that fuel tanks capable of supplying the equivalent of 60% of U.S. electricity production be launched into space. Launching a payload this large is obviously a for­midable task. but even if this proves feasible there still remains the problem of making sure that these lasers hit their targets. At present, computer and sensor technology cannot guarantee this, and 
seem to be far from doing so. What, then, can we do to make Star Wars a reality more quickly? 
According to Time magazine "Experts say, the Soviets are about abreast with the United States in producing high­energy lasers and ahead in the power sources needed ~~A. _m them. But the United States is believed to hold a sub­stantial lead in computer technology and sensors.' If this is true, I believe it would make the most sense in terms of money, manpower, time and most importantly trust for the two countries' scientists to work jointly and_ openly for solution to the technical problems of this modern method of warfare in the hope that we will someday eliminate its very need for existence. 
Trust is most important at the negotiat­ing table, and that is precisely where Star Wars is at its weakest. It simply cannot be negotiated using the methods that the superpowers have utilized in coming to past agreements. I believe that any con­ventional type of negotiation on Star Wars-~ is predestined to failure, and that the only feasible accord on the topic would be for the Soviets and the United States to agree to work together on perfecting the tech­nology. In the past both the United States and the Soviet Union have understand­ably been very cautious at the bargaining table using the ponderous "We will give a little if you give a little" style. With Star Wars this cannot be done. It is an all or nothing kind of system which Time diplomatic correspondent Strobe Talbott says, "No single component (can) be given away at the bargaining table." And if the United States decides to continue with other arms reduction talks, Talbott warns, "The Soviets are all the less likely 
to cut back on their offensive forces." This, of course, means that the develop­ment of Star Wars will become even more complicated, possibly hopelessly so. It will be argued that it may well be equally as complicated for us ever to work to­gether, but with only the madnss of the present policy of Mutually Assured Destruction we must try something. 
Trust is, of course, the key element in the search for peace. One of the oldest and most sucessful ways of promoting trust is through the exchange of people and information. As was evidenced in the recent Olympic boycotts and aborted arms talks both sides have been ex­tremely reluctant to exchange either of these two valuable commodities. This hurts both countries. People are unwilling to compete or even speak with each other have little change of ever understanding each other's backgrounds and the views they innuence, and thus, have almost no hope of ever being able to negotiate a realistic, lasting peace. The lack of infor­mation exchange hurts all people for it can cause needless suffering as new in­dustrial. agricultural and medical tech­niques which could aid many remain hid­den under a cloak of suspicion. It is because of this lack of exchange that I see another benefit to a joint effort on Star Wars. I believe that even if a consor­
tium of Soviet and Western scientists are incapable of finding a technical solution to the peace process the mere fact that they are working together on such a sensitive project will add much to it as the two superpowers will slowly learn to do something they have never done before: trust each other.

Decision by Goldrick does not fit the crime 
Dear Editor: 
Two resident assistants, Kurt Petersen 
and Anne DeWald, were fired Tuesday 
after being ticketed at an off-campus 
party Friday night. 
As a member ofAnne's section in Lewis, 
I know this will have a very bad effect on 
several people here. Firing Anne and Kurt 
for what they did is not a punishment 
fitting the offense. 
Kurt and Anne have done so much for their halls and for the entire Notre Dame community in the past three years, and now it seems like it makes no difference. Their past behavior should have been considered in making the decision. Now how can they give to Notre Dame when it is slapped back in their faces? 
Many of us here feel that some other form of punishment would have been much more just for what Kurt and Anne did. Their "terminations" are going to 'have a strong impact across campus and I hope students will reactto this unjust treatment. Express your concerns, in writing, to the Office of Student Affairs and hope they reconsider their decisions. 
Jenny DuBrucq Lewis Hall 
Lack of Moral Justice in disciplinary action 
De,u· t:c/ilor: 
Is there Moral Justice at Notre Dame? We think not due to the recent decision which took the jobs of two responsible Resident Assistants. 
On the 5th of September an off-campus party was raided. Two resident assistants were ticketed and as a result lost their jobs. These two individuals are not only outstanding leaders and exemplary stu­dents but also ofthe highest moral quality that this University has to offer. 
In our minds relieving these students of their duties is a gross injustice to not only the individuals but to the University as well. The characters and past records of these two R.A.'s were never considered in rendering a decision. By taking these students away from their jobs both Keenan and Lewis suffer the loss of their individual leadership, understanding, and friendship. 
We understand the University feels the students should be disciplined but we also feel the excessive disciplinary action taken by the administration is sadly in­appropriate.

Students must decide on memorial's meaning 
Dear Editor: 
After the fence was taken down we took the opportunity to take a closer look at the newly completed "war memorial." Its meaning was unclear to us. We wondered what impression a monument of this magnitude would have on the many people who would see it. 
If it is to be a memorial to the people who have been victims of war then there should be some evidence of that. There is no plaque to convey this to casual ob­servers. The memorial seems to com­memorate the wars themselves rather than those who died. One side of the memorial reads "pro patria et pace.'' The individuals who were killed in the tragedy died in the hope of peace for the future. While it is important to remember that, it is not enough. We must go one step further. Is is not more important to strive for peace than to memorialize war? 
We cannot allow the memorial to be­come a glorification of war. Since it oc­cupies such a prominent place on our campus it shuld serve to remind us everyday that we must do everything we can to strive for peace in our world. War is not a thing of the past but a horrible reality of the present. We must take more positive steps toward achieving peace. Because life is sacred, we must be con­cerned about all life that is lost through injustice. We, as Catholic university, have to be conscious of how our money is spent in the name of peace and justice. In the future our money would be better directed toward more active peacemak­ing efforts. 
Since we, as students, had no voice in what this stucture would look like or what it would say, let us take a stand on what it shall mean for us. Let It remind us that there has been war, that men and women have died, and that we must now concen­trate on working for peace. Let us work for the time when there will be no more war memorials, but only memorials for those who have devoted their lives for peace. On Friday, September 1 2 from 2:30-5:00 pm we will hold a celebration of peace at the memoriaL We will be celebrating in our confi dence that to­gether we can achieve peace in our world. We invite all of you to join us in this celebration of life.

Belles drop 2nd, 3-0 
By JANE SHEA 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's soccer team lost its third game the season last Tuesday to Kalamazoo Col­lege, .3-0, dropping Saint Mary's record to 1-2. 
Kalamazoo took an early lead in the game, scoring twice in the ftrst half. 
The Belles were never able to get themselves going after they 
fell behind in the first half.  
"We  were  frustrated  by  
(Kalamazoo's early lead,"  said  
Coach John Akers.  

Saint Mary's was unable to score, but there were many close attempts like the ones made by sophomore Ellen Boyle. 
Kalamazoo added one more in the second half while continuing to frustrate the Belles. 
Despite the fact Saint Mary's was unable to score they did play a splendid passing game and junior goalie, Patty Hatfield came up with some god saves to keep the lead from increasing. 
"We are working on our pass­ing game and will be improved when we play Kalamazoo again in three weeks," predicted Akers. 
Saint Mary's takes the field again on tomorrow against Notre Dame.

Boston tries to hold off history 
Associated Press 
Darn those Boston Red Sox. 
Just when it was time for a final-month free-for-all in the American League East. the Red Sox wrecked it. 
With a I 1-game winning streak through yesterday, Boston holds its largest lead of the season, eight-and-a-half games over second-place Toronto. 
Now, it appears the Red Sox may have to hold offonly history. 
Baltimore was not able to catch them. Nor was Detroit. The New York Yankees surged, them stumbled, and are 11-and-a-half games back. 
Ever since the Red Sox moved into first place on May 14, the 
rest  of the AL  east  has  been  
waiting for them to fold.  
Everyone  knows  they  were  

supposed to-in the last 12 years, five Boston teams have led at the All-Star break and none of them has won. And who could forget the double-digit collapse in 1978? 
But this is a different brand of Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox, traditionally con-

The biggest difference is pitch­ing. particularly the Cy Young year of Roger Clemens, breezing with a 21-4 record. But does everyone realize just how good Boston's pitching has been? 
The Red Sox are within a few

the AL in earned run average. 
Boston has not done that since 
1916, when the star of the staff

vorable schedule, that the Red 
Sox believe will carry them to 
their first division championship 
since 1975. Boston plays its final 
1 0 games at home, three each 
against Toronto and Baltimore 
and the final four against New 
York. 
On the road, the Red Sox play 
three games this weekend in New 
York and three more the follow­
ing weekend in Toronto. 
Boston has won four of seven 
games against the Blue Jays this 
season and 13 of 20 in the last 
two years. 
Dennis "Oil Can" Boyd, despite his off-the-field episodes, is 14­
9. Bruce Hurst has won 10 games and Tom Seaver is still pitching well. Calvin Schiraldi, acquired in a trade that sent Bob Ojeda to the New York Mets, has overcome arm problems and has become Boston's stopper since being recalled from the minors seven weeks ago. 
Boston has also kept itself ahead this season by beating up on the weaker AL west. After going just 40-44 against West teams in 1985, the Red Sox pul­verized the other division this year with a 5 1-33 mark. 
Only once this year did Boston weaken, when it went .3-I 1 at the end of July. That's when the other teams made their moves. 
The Orioles pulled within 2 1h games in the ftrst week of Au­gust. When Baltimore fell off the pace, the Yankees got within 3'h games. Two weeks later, the Tigers broke a season-long malaise and climbed within 4'h.

For Sale: Series ring 
Associated Press 
EVANSVILLE, Ind. -Nestled in the classified section this week in The Evansville Courier is a tiny advertisement. For sale: 1961 Cincinnati Reds World Series ring. 
The ad sits there, like a dia­mond in the rough, between other ads for used bicycles, chrome dineUe sets and a chest­type freezer. 
Karen Stewart is asking $4,500 for the ring. which once belonged to her father, the late Elmo Henson Jr. 
Henson was a scout for the Reds. He got the ring from Pete Whisenant, who batted .200 in 28 games with the '61 Reds. Whisenant had trouble cracking an outfield that included league MVP frank Robinson, Vada Pin­son and Wally Post. 
It was the only World Series ring Whisenant collected. His major league career ended after thaf '61 season. So the gift of the ring was a warm statement of his friendship with Henson. 
Mrs. Stewart said she believes Whiser~ant currently lives some­where in Florida. 
"Pete and my father were very close," Mrs. Stewart said. "It started out during spring train­ing in Florida. My father was a real personable fellow, and never hesitated to walk up and talk to people. Over the years, he and Pete became real good friends." 
But now, 13 years after her fa­ther's death, the unemployed mother of three is hoping to sell the ring. 
"I can't wear it, except on my thumb maybe," she said. "And to be honest, we can use the money." 
The World Series ring is only a small part of her father's major league memorabilia. He in­fluenced some big sports names, including long-time pro football star and Evansville na­tive Bob Griese. The family has a letter from Griese, thanking Henson for his support and en­couragement.

Beuerlein tops depth chart; Andrysiak, Belles stand 2nd 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN 
Sports Editor 
The biggest controversy surrounding 
last year's football team on the field had 
to be the quarterback situatidn. Steve 
Beuerlein was bothered by a shoulder in­jury he sustained against USC which ren­dered him ineffective at times. Terry Andrysiak filled in for Beuerlein in last season's Navy game and spearheaded the Irish to a 4 1-I 7 victory. 
From that moment on, the arguments over who should start raged. Both saw action in the last four games of the season, but neither was effective in the losses to Penn State and Miami. 
At the beginning of spring drills, the quarterback question rose again. Would Head Coach Lou Holtz go with Beuerlein, the drop-back passer, or the more mobile Andrysiak. 
This year, the question was answered quickly. Beuerlein, showing signs that he was completely recovered from the in­jured shoulder, solidified his starting po­sition by the end of the spring drills and has maintained it this fall. Holtz, mean­while, has professed nothing but confi­dence in his senior starter. 
"I really have a lot of confidence in Steve Beuerlein," Holtz said at his weekly press conference. "I don't know what's going to happen in front of 60,000 people, but he's only made one bad deci­sion in practice this fall when we've been in team, and that was (Monday). 
"He has an excellent arm and a good touch. He's very intelligent -a good leader. He does the little things the right way. I think Steve Beuerlein is a fine, fine passer." 
Beuerlein enters the 1986 campaign as Notre Dame's leader in career comple­tions with 322. If he attempts 19 passes and and throws for 96 yards, he'll take over as the career ·leader in those categories as well. Last season, Beuerlein

I Question marks abound for fall Irish baseball squad 
I 
TERRY LYNCH 
~ 
Sports Writer
I I I 
If Irish head coach Larry Gallo I were to symbolize the 1986 I season, that symbol might just I take the form ofa question mark. 
"''m not much of a prognos­r 
ticator, so if you want to talk to me about the season, come talk to me on May I0," said Gallo, who will lead his team onto the diamond at Jake Klein Field this weekend. On Saturday at IOa.m, the Irish will play a game against former Irish players before for­mally opening the fall exhibition season against Bradley in a doubleheader at I p.m. Sunday. It will mark Gallo's seventh season as the Irish head coach, who will be using this fall to im­prove on last spring's 22-28 record. 
"Fall baseball at Notre Dame is the equivalent of spring train­ing in the majors," said Gallo. "We play I 0 games, all on the weekend, and intrasquad games during the week. We want to develop situational baseball and work on the fundamentals." 
Aside from a host of uncer­tainties, one bright spot for the Irish this season is that the basic offensive and defensive players on the team remain intact, which should be bad news for Irish op­ponents. Last year, the Irish hit opposing pitching at a consistent and powerful .31 I clip. Senior John Loughran, who broke the Irish single-season hit record 
(69) on his last at-bat of the '86 season, anchors an offensive at­tack that also includesjunior Pat Pesavento, senior Scott Rogers, and senior captain Ken Soos. 
"Youthful enthusiasm in so far as hitting is concerned can really carry it for the team," explained Gallo. "I have guarded optimism about the hitting. We've only been practicing for two weeks, so it's hard to tell. But I haven't seen a team hitting as well as this team since I've been here. They've still got to bear down and work on things, though." 
After the hitting, even the guarded optimism runs dry for the Irish. The team has a load of problems to work on this fall, the biggest of which is pitching. In last year's roller-coaster season, no one group exemplified the lack of consistency on the team than the pitching staff. The loss ofveteran and consistent slaffers Brad Cross, Mark Watzke, and Steve Powell to graduation only make the problem more acute for Gallo. 
"Kight now I have 19 pitchers, and all 19 will get an opportunity 
to pitch. We don't have an expe­
rienced pitching staff, and we 
weren't consistent last year. 
There were also a few arm prob­
lems. For instance, Kevin 
Chenail was not I00 percent last 
season, and he and Paul Mauk 
both had operations over the 
summer. 
"But as far as I'm concerned, 
it all starts on the mound. If we 
have some good pitching, it 
helps the whole team. The 
pitchers know that they're on a 
team that can score runs for 
them, but they've got to get it 
going by pitching consistently." 
The Irish also suffered from a 
plague of mental errors last 
season, but Gallo, who normally 
goes at length about such prob­
lems, attributed most of the 
problem to injuries. 
"We had people in there last season who were hurt or inex­perienced. They thought about their mistakes. But mental con­centration has to be a lot better, has to be. The team realized it had a frustrating season, but sometimes you have to get knocked down' before you can get up. 
One big change for the team when they start the season in March is that they have dropped out of the Midwestern Collegiate Conference, thereby making any NCAA berth a tall order for the new independent. 
''I'm disappointed, but it was an Athletic Department decision and I respect it (dropping out of the MCC)," said Gallo. "An inde­pendent in collegiate baseball needs 40-45 wins to be consid­ered for a tournament berth. Just ask Clemson. They had an excel­lent team last year and didn't make it to the NCAA's." 
Attitude will be key to Irish grid turnaround 
Right now, Notre Dame is down. But from these ashes a phoenix will emerge; a new Notre Dame, a better Notre Dame, will come back to its place in 
college football. 
Those might not be the exact words, but Notre Dame fans may recall them nevertheless. They fell from the lips of someone who knows, pe~haps better than anyone else, where Notre Dame has been and where it should be. They also catl)e at perhaps the low-water mark in the history of Notre Dame's great gridiron tradition. 
Ara Parseghian, the former Irish head coach and CBS-TV's commentator-on Nov. 30, 1985, stated those soothing words to all the dazed Irish fans who were witnessing the waning seconds of Miami's 58-7 humiliation of the Irish in the last game of last year's season. 
Most people by that point in the game had already turned off their sets, but as Parseghian was saying those words, almost mockingly the camera was showing the dejected and battered Notre Dame players straggling around in anticipation of the final gun. 
The general attitude of the team was one factor 
Holtz felt would play a major role in his effort to turn 
the Irish fortunes around. 
"The players have all worked very, very hard, but 
I'm not sured how how much confidence they have 
that they can win.," Holtz has stated. "I don't know 
what their attitude will be the first time adversity 
strikes. These are questions that concern me." 
The ultimate answer, of course, will come Saturday 
when the Irish players will attempt to put the past behind them and begin anew. And don't think for a moment that the fans, especially the student body, can't make a difference in how the players will respond to the situation. 

Marty Burns 
Football Notebook 
"The fan support means so much to us,~· said senior free safety Mike Haywood. "Maybe they don't know it, but when you come out of that tunnel you get chills up and down your spine. You realize you're notjust here for yourself but for everyone-the fans, the alumni and the Notre Dame family. That's what it's all about. Really, you feel like you have 13 men on the field -the bench is the 12th man and the fans are the 13th man." 
For the fans, it may be tough to get excited about a team that has seemed to let them down too many times before. Most of the student body was in gram­mar school when the Irish were last a national power and have only been told to expect greatness every year by the media and coaches only to feel in the end as though they had been duped. 
But the Irish have proven throughout the spring workouts that they deserve the support. If they get it, just maybe they will prove one prognosticator named Parseghian to be right. 
 
There is a striking similarity in the situation Notre Dame finds itself in this year and the one in which Michigan found itself a year ago. When the Irish went into Ann Arbor last season, they were the favorites over a team that was coming off one of its most disappointing campaigns in memory. 
The starting quarterback was recovering from a broken arm that some felt was not good enough to use in college football anyway. An untested sopho­more tailback was going to be the rushing game. Inexperience prevailed over the offensive and defen­sive lines. Many questioned whether the team had the desire to put the program back on the winning track. 
The Wolverines surprised Notre Dame Hrst and then the rest of the country in rolling up a I 0-1-I record and a final spot at number-two in the national polls. 
 
For those of you who wonder what it takes to be the football coach at Notre Dame, or for those of you who just want to hear someone else echo a common campus lament. Lou Holtz has something to say. 
"I just have absolutely no social life whatsoever," he says. "I get up about 5:30 in the morning and come in to start our staff meeting from 7 to 12. At one o'clock or so, I get ready for practice. After prac­tice gets done, then I look at film and go home around 9:30. 
"Then from I 0-I 2 or so, I prepare for the next day's meeting. I don't find it boring or difficult. Ijust don't know how to do it any other way."
