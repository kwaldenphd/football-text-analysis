No investment protests planned by student government, network 
By MIRIAM HILL 
Copy Editor 
Neither the Notre Dame student government nor the Anti-Apartheid Network will organize a protest against University policies toward investment in South Africa, unlike 

. cohorts at other universities across the country (see related story page 5). Both the Notre Dame Anti­Apartheid Network and the student government subcommittee set up to gather information on the Univer­sity's investments in South Africa believe a protest here would make the administration and the Board of Trustees less willing to discuss the University's investment policy, ac­cording to Pat Baccanari, a member ofboth the network and chairman of the subcommittee. "We (the Network) seriously con­sidered protesting, but thought it 
would not be the proper thing to do in light of the willingness of the Board of Trustees to talk with us," said John Dettling, chairman of the student government Committee for Responsible University Business Practices and Network member. 
"We have to stress we're one com­munity here and as one community we have to sit down and discuss before we decide to take actions," he said. 
Dettling said a protest would be antagonistic and "automatically create sides." 
Dettling will meet today with the chairman of the Board of Trustees' Committee for Student Affairs to present a student government proposal calling for a meeting bet­ween student leaders and the Board of Trustees' Investment Committee in October 1985. The October meeting will be a forum for discus­sion of the University's investment policy. 
Also today, Anti-Apartheid Net­work leader Margarita Rose and several network members, includ­ing Baccanari and Professor Peter Walshe, will meet with Robert Wil­mouth, chairman of the Investment Committee of the Notre Dame Board of Trustees, to discuss the University's investment policy. 
Rose said the Network will ask the trustees to revise the current policy of investing only in companies that have signed the Sullivan Principles to a policy ofinvesting in companies that have signed the recently revised Sullivan Principles. 
The Anti-Apartheid Network is a loosely organized body of several autonomous campus interest groups. Baccanari and Dettlingserve on the student government commit-

Campus organizations offer aid to minority students 
Editor's Note: This is the third part 
ofa three part series detailing the 
problems and situations minority 
students face on the Notre Dame 
and Saint Mary's campuses. 
Today's article focuses on 
minority students' clubs and or­ganizations. 
By MARGIE KERSTEN 
Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 
You're 4000 miles away from home and everybody and everyth­ing seems terribly unfamiliar. Where do you go? 
Minority and international stu­dents at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's have several clubs and or­ganizations which will attempt to adjust them to their new com­munities. 
Notre Dame's Office of Interna­

tiona! Student Affairs aids students 
who attend Notre Dame from 
foreign countries. 

"I see myself as the link between the international students and the United States · Department of Justice, Immigration, and Naturalization," said Brother George Schmitz, director of Notre Dame's Office of International Stu­dent Affairs. 
Under the International Student Affairs office a number of groups for different minorities have been established: The India Association, The Chinese Scholars Association, which includes the People's Republic of ·china, and The Chinese Students Association, which includes those students from Taiwan. 
Also in conjunction with the In­

ternational Student Affairs office is 
the International Student Or­ganization. The co-presidents for this past school year were Winston Griffin and Louisa DeMello. r\c­cording to DeMello, "We are minorites, but we have never been given the chance to share with the American minorities on campus, except at the night at Senior Bar." 
Minority Student Series 
DeMello is referring to an Ethnic Night that was sponsored by both student government and the ISO in which all minorities and interna­tional students at Saint Mary's and Notre Dame were invited to at­tend. The ISO also sponsors an an­

nual International Festival where food from all different countries is served. 
DeMello said that a lot of minority students took part in the festival, but added that more inter­action would be necessary be­cause "I'm still not sure they consider us minorities, because we're not a part of the American heritage." 
Other organizations under the ISO are the American Lebanese Club and the Hispanic Student As­sociation. 
Although the minority students at Saint Mary's are encouraged to attend the Notre Dame organiza­tions, the minority enrollment at Saint Mary's is extremely low. 
"Minorities at Saint Mary's are very poorly represented on all levels of the college -students, faculty, and administration," said Sister Karoljackowski, dean ofStu­dent Affairs at the College. 
According to Jackowski, the main concern of the College for next year will be to decide whet­her or not minorities are necessary on campus and if so how will the College go about providing the atmosphere for minority students. 
"The campus climate is impor­tant for bringing in minorities. People must feel comfortable before we start actively recruiting minorities. We need to look at the attitudes of the students, faculty and administration," she said. 
"I think we need to diversify the college community. There is a ten­dency to hire people and recruit students who already fit into the Saint Mary's mold." 
"I think the most valuable parts

In Brief 
In two separate rallies, more than 900 Brown Uni­versity students protested institutional racism at that school. The first rally was organized by the 'Ibird World Center, but a later rally drew 600 studens, most of them white, to voice support for Third World concerns. A student newspaper survey showed 81.6 Jlercent of the students believe complaints about racism at Brown are jus­tified, and that the university is too lenient in handling acts of violence against lbird World students. -The Observer 
An elephant-shaped balloon took the prime 
minister of Malaysia to an unscheduled stop along a highway today, with security officials in hot pursuit. Malcolm Forbes, American publisher and editor-in-chiefof"Forbes" magazine, took Prime Mini­ster Mahathir Mohamad for a short ride in the balloon. After I 5 minutes, the wind shifted and the hot-air balloon landed a quarter of a mile away beside a highway rather than returning to the field, Malaysian officials said. When they saw the balloon straying off its plannt:d route, the prime minister's security guards scrambled into police cars and sped to the highway, where a massive traffic jam had developed. Ambulances raced to the scene. However, the prime minister left the balloon safely with a big smile, and went home. -AP

Announcing the first annual Goofus and Gallant awards 
Goofus and Gallant taught me a lot about life. 
They didn't waste time with trivialities, n'lind you, 
Goofus and Gallant taught me the really important 
things in life, like not eating sweets before dinner. 
For those unfamiliar with Goofus and Gallant, they 
are two characters in the magazine for children, 
"Highlights." Each month they demonstrate the good 
way to do things, and the bad way. 
Gallant is the good one. He always makes his bed, 
washes the dishes, and shares his toys. Goofus is the bad 
one. Ht; never makes his bed, washes the dishes, or 
shares his toys. 
In honor of these two inspiring characters, I have named an award after each, and am presenting the awards to those most deserving of them. 
Here, then, are the 1984-85 Goofus and Gallant awards. 
A Gallant award to Jeff Anhut. Anhut, the guy who went crazy every time the band struck up the song "Wipe out," turned ot­herwise boring time-outs into miniature pep rallies. 
A Goofus award to those who threw oranges at the beginning of the Syracuse game. Not only did the oranges splatter all over the court disrupting play, but they succeeded in dampen­ing crowd enthusiasm and hurting the Irish team's momentum at the time. Two words aptly describe this ac­tion: no class. 
A Gallant award to Ann Pettifer. Although many do not agree with her and some 6A~LANT feel her arguments arc ridiculous, few do not read her columns. At a homogeneous school like Notre Dame, different view­points need to be brought out, and Pettifer's columns undoubtably do this. 
AGoofus award to those who wrote to The Observer about abortion, Mario Cuomo, or whether ROTCs should be allowed to play soldier on campus. Few care what a person has to say who is writing in reply to a letter which was in reply to a letter which was in response to a column. 
A Gallant award to the members of the Judicial Council who ruled the Student Senate's term exten­sions unconstitutional. They did what was right despite knowing their action would create more bad publicity for student government, something student govern­ment definitely does not need. 
AGoofus award to the Student Senate. By allowing a ticket that knowingly violated election rules to remain in the race and by extending their terms to pass a new constitution, the senate did about as much for studeRt

government's credibility in 1985 as Nixon did for the federal government's in I972. 
A Gallant award to the month of December. "Ibis month was so warm and free of snow that it caused many out-of-state freshmen to wonder whether all those legends about South Bend winters were really ex­aggerations. 
AGoofus award to the month ofJanuary. This month was so cold and full of snow that it caused many out-of­state freshmen to wonder whether all those legends 
about South Bend winters were really understate­ments. 
AGallant award to Vince Willis, Aline Gioffre and all those who worked on the Millions Against MS cam­paign. 'Jbey were respon­sible not only for Notre Dame and Saint Mary's win­ning of a free concert, but 

_/ more importantly, they were responsible for raising over .S20,000 to combat a debilitating disea.~e. 
A Goofus award to MTV. Whether MTV claimed a top five act would appear at the winning school or just implied it, the fact remains that MTV found the only 

way to make Notre Dame's victory antidimactic, and to many, slightly disappointing. 
AGallant award to students who work in the dining halls. Wearing funny hats and picking napkins off dirty trays cannot be an easy way to work one's way through school. Whatever they're being paid, those students deserve more. 
AGoofus award to whoever is responsible for theme nights at the dining halls. This Goofus award needs no explanation. 
Well, there you have them, the 1984-85 Goofus and Gallant awards. 
Fortunately, many of the Goofus award winners are making progress toward winning a Gallant award for next year. The senate condemned the proposed in­crease in the student activities fee, MTV awarded Notre Dame student Kevin Herbert a summer internship, and the dining halls did not reorganize the meal lines for its last theme night. 
Gallant would be proud of them.

Anti-government riots mark May Day in Polish cities 
As..'iociated Press 

WARSAW, Poland -Thousands of rock-throwing demonstrators battled riot police in Gdansk yester­day, and an estimated IS,OOO Solidarity supporters staged a two­hour peaceful May Day march in Warsaw to protest food price hikes and political arrests. 
About SOO Solidarity activists chanting "Solidarity" and "Lech Walesa" forced their way into the of­tidal government May Day parade in Gdansk. They interrupted the parade for I 0 minutes by sitting down in the road before being routed by baton-wielding police units. 
Almost a mile from the parade routl\ an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 mostly young demonstrators gat­hered near the former Solidarity headquarters and hurled stones ripped from the streets at a column of helmeted riot police, Western reporters said. 
'!be police initially showed restraint bur then charged with barons and shields and used water 
cannon and tear gas to disperse the 
crowd. Several demonstrators and 
police were injured. 

One member of the riot police was beaten ro the ground by demonstrators and taken away in an ambulance. A protester who ap­parently threw a rock at a police vehicle was rammed by a police car and then beaten by riot squads. The protester was taken away by am­bulance. 
Scores of demonstrators were ar­rested in the clash, which lasted over an hour and left the street lit­tered with stones and debris. 
Solidarity leader Walesa at­tempted ro join the government parade in Gdansk but returned home when his way was blocked by hundreds ofriot police. "We have no intention of getting into tights," he said. "It's a shame that someone divides us so brutally." 
In Warsaw, an estimated IS,OOO people chanting Solidarity slogans and carrying Solidarity banners marched past cordons of riot police in a two-hour demonstration before dispersing.

Reagan's Nicaraguan sanctions cause dissent among congressmen 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON President Reagan's decision to impose trade sanctions against Nicaragua won general praise from Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., and others on Capitol Hill yesterday, but critics said the move will drive the leftist Sandinista government even farther into the Soviet camp. 
Lugar, chai1rman of the Foreign Relations Committee, was quoted by an aide as saying the measures are "an important step," but not a com­prehensive policy toward Central America. 
"It's about time," Senate Majority Robert Dole said of Reagan's action. "I hope it's effective." 
Sen. Uoyd Bentsen of Texas, one of a group of Democrats previously urging sanctions, said the embargo "can help persuade those in power in Managua to send home the 2,500 to 3,500 Cuban and Soviet military advisers now in that country and to stop supporting armed insurgents against their neighbors." 
Bentsen and others said Reagan should persuade nations both in and

out of Latin America to join the United States in limiting or dropping trade with Nicaragua. 
But there was sharp criticism for Reagan from a number of House members and senators who said in­stead ofencouraging the Sandinistas to negotiate an end to the civil war in Nicaragua, it will encourage them to become another communist Cuba. 
Last week, Congress refused in a highly-emotional battle to release Sl4 million Reagan had sought to help the rightist Contras seeking the overthrow of the Sandinistas.

Sen. David Ourenberger, R-Minn., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the embargo is "a plus rather than a minus. But it's nowhere near being an essential part of the policy that should be imple­mented, particularly when it's done unilaterally." 
Durenberger quoted intelligence officials who told the committee a week ago that the sanctions would have little. practical impact on the troubled Nicaraguan economy. 
"It wouldn't have done that much good or we would have done it al­ready," Durenberger said.

Two hundred and seventy-one people have been arrested at the University of California at Berkeley in the past three weeks as students, faculty and Berkeley residents con­tinue to protest the university's in­vestments in South Africa. 
Between 200 and 500 people have staged a sit-in on the steps of Sproul Hall, an administration build­ing, since Thursday April II. The protesters have been sleeping on mattresses outside the building. 
The sit-in arose spontaneously after an April I 0 rally when 50 people refused to move from Sproul Hall until the university's Board of Regents agrees to listen to the protesters demands, which include complete and immediate divest­ment ofall university funds invested in South Africa. 
Berkeley has approximately $1.7 billion invested in companies with holding in South Africa, according to protester Howard Pinderhughes. 
The protesters also demanded that a public hearing be held to al­low community members to con­tribute their opinions to a report on divestment to be submitted to the regents. 
In addition, the protesters re­quired that the report be studied at the May 16-17 meeting of the Board ofRegents rather than at theJune 21 meeting as is currently planned. 

On April 16, Berkeley police stormed Sproul Hall and arrested 136protesters, including 17 student government members. One policeman was injured when a resisting protester bit him on the hand. 
"I'm missing all of my classes and I'm prepared to be arrested if that is what it takes to show how wrong it is to support white supremacy practices," said senior Richard Mel­nick. 
An additional 135 protesters have been arrested in the past two weeks, and the protesters added an addi­tional demand that all charges against those arrested be dropped, Pinderhughes said. 
Rallies for divestment are at­tended every day at noon by up to 7000 people outside of Sproul Hall, Pinderhughes added. 
Pinderhughes said the student protesters have received strongsup­port from faculty at the university and from Berkeley city council

members, many ofwhom have been arrested. Berkeley mayor Gus New­port will speak in support of the protesters at a rally in front of Uni­versity Hall this Monday. City businessmen have donated food to the protesters who have pitched camp outside Sproul Hall. 
There is some speculation that Nobel Peace Prize winner Bishop Desmond Tutu will stop at the uni­versity when he visits California from May II to 13. 
The idea for the sit-in at Berkeley was sparked by a sit-in by students at Columbia University which began on April 4 and ended after three weeks last Friday. The students were demanding that the university divest itself of $32.5 million in indirect in­vestments in South Africa. 
On April 4, 20 Columbia students padlocked the doors to Hamilton Hall, an administration and clas­sroom building, forcing students and faculty to resort to an under­ground tunnel to gain access to the building. 
The Columbia sit-in "began as 20 people who were going to sit for three hours, but then more and more people came to support it," said Tanaquil Jones, leader of the Columbia Coalition for a Free South Africa. 
Bishop Tutu telephoned the protesters from his home in Johan· nesberg on April 11 to praise them for taking a stand on the issue of apartheid. Tutu thanked the stu­dents "on behalf' of the victims of apartheid, said protest leader Daniga Bolyii. 
Jesse Jackson and Gary Hart also lent their support to the protesters. 
The average number of people participating in the sit-in ranged from 75 to 250 with approximately 300 to 400 people showing up for daily rallies, according to Anne Kornhauser, editor·in-chief of the Columbia student newspaper. 
Jones said the recent violence in South Africa along with a decision by the university's Board of Trustees not to divest itself of investments in South Africa prompted students to stage a sit-in. 

investments in an impartial manner, while the Netwdrk already has proposed specific changes in the in­vestment policy. Dettling said, however, that it is difficult to remain completely neutral on such a volatile issue. 
According to Dettling, the com­mittee agrees with the changes recommended by the Network. 
He said the two organizations are "not bound to each other. We can disagree and we can leave the (Network)." 
Baccanari said student govern· ment and the Network are two in­dependent groups fighting for the same cause. 
"(The two organizations) are like the army and the navy, they're fight­ing for the same thing, but they're separate bodies," he said.

Enforced silence at ND protest was unfortunate 
Tuesday, I lost some of my respect for the University of Notre Dame, the Notre Dame Law School and the principles ofopen debate and justice that they claim to espouse. That day, the right of students here to peacefully protest and to present views contrary to those 
Kristian Anderson guest column 
of an invited speaker was denied. That day, 
open debate was replaced by enforced 
silence. 
Harsh words, indeed, but words I think are 
fitting because ofwhat took place. 
When it was announced that William]. Ben­nett, secretary of education, was to receive the Thomas ]. White Educator of the Year Award, numerous students were outraged and decided to protest his visit to the Law School. Their protests were carried on in a spirit of open debate and education. Signs were put up around the Law School citing various state· ments Bennett had said on such topics as stu· dent loans for college. These signs questioned the choice of Bennett as "Educator of the Year." 
These signs and messages on the black· boards of the classrooms asked students to at· tend Bennett's speech and to listen to what he had to say. They also encouraged the audience to "clap only ifyou mean it." None ofthe signs called for any open clashes or disruptions during Bennett's visit or speech. 
Along with these messages, several students arranged for a protest march outside of the Law School prior to the speech. This protest was to continue inside the lounge during the speech· not in a disruptive manner, but rather by having the protesters simplysit quietly dis­playing their signs. 
Unfortunately, these protests did not go on as planned. Signs which had been around the Law School for a couple ofdays were suddenly ripped down. Ripped down not because they were posted where they should not have been · they were either by announcements of the speech, or were in places where other such announcements have been placed -but be· cause ofwhat they said. As well, students who attempted to put up new signs in the lounge prior to the speech were stopped from doing so. 
Outside of the Law School, campus security asked the protesters to keep down their chanting, so as not to disrupt classes. This re­quest came just four days after Law School classes had to continue while loud music was played, and loud speakers were used on the 
South Quad during An Tostal. As well, campus 
security prohibited these students from bring­
ing their signs into the lounge for the speech. 
The students were told that the Law School 
did not want to be discourteous to Bennett. 
The speech, and the rest of the protest then 
want on as planned. Bennett spoke. The 
protesters listened. There were no disrup­
tions. There were no denunciations. There 
were just thoughtful questions during the al­
lotted question period after the speech. 
I did not actively take part in any of these 
protests, but I fully supported my fellow stu­
dents in their efforts to bring open debate on 
an issue to Notre Dame and the Law School. I 
felt proud that my classmates felt strongly 
enough on an issue to protest and to attempt 
to educate others about their concerns. I also 
felt proud that they had not called for a dis­
ruptive protest, but for a quiet, thoughtful 
protest. They did not want to stop Bennett 
from speaking; they wanted him to be heard. 
But they also wanted their views to be heard. 
Unfortunately, the protestor's views were 
not treated with the same respect they gave 
Bennett's views. His views were allowed to be 
heard. Their views were suppressed, just at 
the time when starting them would have had 
the greatest impact. 
During my three years at the Law School., I have been told how important it is to be so­cially aware. I have been told that we were being trained not to be hired guns, but rather to be lawyers who are concerned with people and concerned with issues. I was told that Notre Dame lawyers were different because of their concerns about important matters. Why, then, when students show their concern about an issue are they prevented from fully expressing that concern? How are they to go forth into the world and speak for those who cannot speak for themselves when they are not allowed to speak here? How is open debate, and the search for what is right and just in our society furthered by what hap­pened here today? 
I want to believe that the University and the Law School believe in open debate. I find it hard to believe that after Tuesday's events. I hope that in the future, reasoned, reasonable debate and protest are not denied here again. 
I do not want to point a finger at anyone. I just hope that everyone -students, ad­ministrators, protesters -will learn a lesson from Tuesday's events. I also hope that open civil debate will continue here at the Law School.

Solutions to the crisis of declining ND minorities 
Despite University Director of Admissions Kevin Rooney's assertion that the location of this institution has an adverse effect upon minority applicants because "minorities prefer urban envirornments," it is increas­ingly evident that the University's !ask ofcom­mitment to the plight of black students has 
Lisa M. Boykin 
guest column 

resulted in the dwindling percentage of 
minorities that choose to enroll here annually. 
The Office of Admissions' disorganized at­
t~mpt to recruit minority students for the 
duration of the past two recruiting weekends 
is indicative of the negligent attitude that has 
created a precarious situation for minority 
students. 
A total of 41 black recruits visited the campus on the weekends of April ll-14 and April 25-28. These students did not have an opportunity to meet with any administration or faculty members although one meeting was scheduled with an academic advisor from the Freshman Year ofStudies. This was the extent ofthe contact between the administration and the black recruits. If the administration is going to display such a minimal effort, why did it bother going through the expense ofbring­ing these students to Notre Dame for a visit? 
If Notre Dame is in ·actuality concerned about improving minority recruitment, why was there not a representative from ad­ministration such as Father Hesburgh, Father Joyce, Father Tyson orJohn Goldrick to meet with these students? 
These recruits need professional guidance from the administration to assist them in determining of which institution they will at­tend. As of now, the only source for this in­formation is expected to come from the black students who are currently enrolled at Notre Dame; however, the administration should assume this role since it is uniquely qualified to provide this information. 
Although the Black Cultural Arts Council assists in many capacities in relation to the

recruiting process, the Office of Admissions 
should invest more time in providing an ac· 
curate presentation of academic life to the 
recruits. The administration's failure to do this 
only serves to diminish Notre Dame's appeal 
to minorities. 
To think that more time, effort and money is 
spent on maintaining the grass on the quad 
than is spent on minority recruitment is an ex· 
treme insult to the members ofthe black com­
munity as well as an embarrassing reflection 
upon the University in comparison to other 
institutions which offer minority students bet· 
ter programs. 
Notre Dame needs to once again establish 
its priorities and dedicate itself to this cause, if 
in fact it is committed to it. 
Granted, Hesburgh was at one point 
actively involved in the Civil Rights Move· 
ment of the 1960s; however, now that the 
situation necessitates intervention, Hes­
burgh's inaction suggests that the respon· 
sibility for increasing minority enrollment is 
no longer considered to be a significant issue 
to the administration. 
If the University wants to demonstrate its concern, it should embark upon a mission that would not only increase the number of high caliber minority students at Notre Dame, but in addition would develop a substantial net­work that would assist minorities in the transi· tion to academic and residential life. Furthermore, if this University expects to retain a high minority level, more funds need to be appropriated in an effort to provide greater financial assistance so that students will not have to resort to transterrmg or withdrawing as a result offinancial difficulties. 
By working in conjunction with the Black Cultural Arts Council and other minority groups, the Office of Admissions and the ad­ministration can resolve this crisis ofdecreas­ing minority enrollment; however, failure to take an active part in this problematic situa· tion will result in a continuation of this trend and inevitably a disappearance ofthe minority scholar at Notre Dame.

The peculiar thing about it all was that things rarely went wrong within the kingdom. Year after year, the empire was represented by football teams which played for national championships and intelligentsia who were among the most elite in the land. Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable were full of surprises, too. Why, in 1972 the empire even embraced women. The plebes of the kingdom could hardly believe that one.

The legend ofthe empire grew and grew, as books, magazines and movies focused on the king and his cohorts who could do no wrong. But somewhere up in the great castle Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable began losing touch with the people. It seemed that Arthur, in his quest to help other empires and other knights, suddenly became aloof. The roundtable began breaking at the seams, as the knights contested one another to replace Ar­thur. Distrust grew rampant and ultimately manifested itself in extremely questionable kingdom policy. The plebes of accepted the rules laid down by the roundtable, though. After all, the empire was still special, and cer­tainly proud and mighty in the eyes of its outside admirers. That was all that really mat­tered anyway since reputation became in­creasingly more important. 
The plebes, to be sure, still relished the status of living under the domain of the kingdom, even if the roundtable was breaking up and no one knew where Arthur had vanished. "Sh ... sh," they would tell one anot­her, "don't let the flaws of our kingdom be known." 

And the plebes could hide the truth for a very, very long time. They became virtuosos of deception in their attempt to maintain the status quo of the kingdom. "Oh yes," they would tell the plebes of other kingdoms, "Arthur is an eminent man and the Knights of the Roundtabe are just extraordinary." For­tunately, life within the kingdom was still bearable and even, at times, still special. There were virtuous local knights who consoled the plebes, taught them the proper way to live and gave the people reason to continue boasting. "Look at our magnificent castle," they would vaunt. "See how its golden spire shines throughout the land?" 
The dark dayfinally arrived, however, when the plebes could lie no more. You see, the dis­trust among the Knights of the Roundtable had reached such high proportions that mac­hination became the rule of the day. Local knights tried all they could to save the kingdom from downfall, but their efforts were futile. Dismissed from the kingdom and ironi­cally told that they were unworthy, the local knights were forced to journey elsewhere. This made the plebes extremely sad because all vestiges of the once proud and mighty empire were now gone. All that remained in the kingdom was jealousy among the knights who were once part of the roundtable and frustration among the plebes who no longer had any knights to lead them. 
And in the end, the plebes could boast no more. Their king had faded into obscurity and the roundtable been broken. The empire, once so proud and mighty, had become just like any other. The legend lived no more.

ten years ago with the surprisingly 
quick fall of Saigon to the North 
Vietnamese, a time laden with con­
flict, confusion, frustration and 
protest. 
The names of more than 58,000 Americans who died in the only war the United States ever "lost" arc engraved in a sea of commemora­tion that runs forever down the sides of the Memorial. They were the sacrifice this country made in an attempt to enforce its foreign policy of containment, a policy intensified by increasing American interests abroad and geared toward keeping the disease of communism from spreading throughout Europe and Asia. 
Characterized by new forms of music, clothing and heavier in­volvement with drugs, the counter­culture symbolized a release for those disenchanted with the values of the older generation. Music by such artists as Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, and Crosby, Stills and Nash lashed out bitterly at the effects of the Vietnam War, and the 

anger and frustration reached its 
peal< in the celebration of 

Woodstock in August 1969. They 
were talkin' 'bout their generation, 
and the time for action, they 
preached, was now. 

The student movement had been the most visible since 1966, and it escalated and reached its peak in mid-1970, when students at Kent State in Columbus, Ohio, called a rally to protest the presence of the National Guard on their campus after the students' burning of d1e ROTC building. Rocks were pelted at the troops, so the troops answered with tear gas and the students dispersed; the Guard followed. At last one detachment of guardsmen found iltself approaching a fence and retreated, while being bombed with rocks from angry students. 
With little warning the guardsmen turned and a single shot was fired. A 13-second fusillade ensued When it was over. nine

StudentsJeff Miller, Allison 
Krause, Bill Schroeder and Sandy 
Scheuer were dead. It was May 4, 
I970. 

On a sunny February afternoon in 
1968, three Notre Dame students 
arrived for their scheduled inter­
views at the Career and Placement 
Offices on the second floor of the 
Administration Building. 
When they got there they found 
more than 200 students stationed 
outside the offices, congregated in 
peaceful protest against Dow 
Chemical, which was the chief 
supplier of napalm -a petroleum 

jelly which burned at a temperature 
of 1000 degrees whatever it 
touched -and plastic body bags 
being used in the Vietnam War. No 
one stopped the three from 
meeting their interviewers -the 
crowd simply wanted to express its 
displeasure with Dow's involve­
ment in the war. 
It was a landmark in student 
activism at Notre Dame. according 
to the February 9, 1968, issue of 
lbe Observer. It was "the first time 
a 'radical' demonstration has been 
permitted within the walls of a 
University building." Dean ofStu­
dent.~ FatherJames Riehle had 
refused permission for the: 
demonstration that morning, and 
had threatened that non-students 
involved would be arrested for 
trespassing. 
Despite the warning, a crowd 
began to gather at approximately 
I 2:30p.m. outside the offices. Fif­
teen minutes later, there were 
about 70 demonstrators outside. 
Riehle then addressed the group, and immediately issued an ul­timatum: the University would allow their protest, but not inside the Administration Building, which he termed "a place of business" and "private property" where students had no legal right. The crowd would have to trove. 
Indecision followed, as the group debated whether or not to obey. Suddenly the large brown doors at the main entrance were pulled open and a larger throng of ap­proximately I50 more protesters who had assembled outside flowed into the building. Among them were philosophy instructor Father David Burrell and Peter Michelson of the English department. 
'!be dilemma was settled. lbe demonstrators would remain. In peace. 
"If we're going to have a demonstration for peace," said student Forrest Hainline, "let's malte it a peaceful demonstration." 
"There were a lot ofdecent 
people who loved their country but 
found themselves on the other side 
of the law," explained Burrell, on 
this tenth anniversary of the war's 
end. "But there came a point when 
people watching their TV's finally 
said, 'I've had it.' 
"Here at the University we could malte a case for conscientious ob­jection. But what about the poor kid who's not in college, who thinks he's going over there to fight for his country? The war was being fought on the backs of the poor. That's another reason we were so against it." 
Wednesday, May 7, 1968: At 3 p.m., a demonstration organized on the Main Quad, led by senior Bill Reishman. Reish man proposed marching in rows of three, onto the field where the annual ROTC Presidential Review would be taking place, until they were 

stopped by police or security. He 
instructed them "not to give 
ground in any case." Reishman also 
asked that the demonstrators not 
incite trouble. 
Student Body President Richard Rossie attempted to speak at the microphone. but was denied. "You promised me this wouldn't hap­pen," he told Reish man. 
Senior Ned Buchbinder began to speak w the demonstrators, but was interrupted by Rossie who had pushed his way through the crowd: "I am against the: war in Vietnam and the industrial-military complex like many of you," said Rossie. "But you have no right to obstruct the marching." 
Reishman argued with Rossie, claiming that the protestors were simply respecting their own com­mitments. 
"Why don't you respect theirs?" 
Rossie shot back. 
The demonstration took place a~ 
scheduled, as SOO protestors seated 
themselves on the southwest 
corner of the field, intentionally 
blocking an area through which the 
Corps was scheduled to march and 
forcing them to take a route SO 
yards in front of the reviewing 
stand. 
Approximately 300 of those: 
protesting trespassed onto the fic:ld 
during the ceremonies in front of 
University President Father 
Theodore lksburgl1, Lieutenant 
Gencrall.cwis W. Walt, assistant 
commander of the Marine Corps, 
military men and their families. 
Hesburgh was forced to apologize 
to a perturbed General Walt. 
Following their appearance on 
the field, Rossie again tried to ob­
ject. "You've: proved your point." 
the burly president pleaded. "I 
approve ofyour ideas but 1would 
appreciate it if you left the field." 
The demonstrators sat quietly througl10ut the proceedings, stand­ing and applauding when the: na­tional anthem was played. 
October /5, 1969: National Moratorium Day. The University had given its support to anyone who felt obligated to skip classes, although teachers had to conduct classes for those students wishing to attend. At Rutgers, President Mao;on Gross had given his full support behind the event, as did administrations a[ Georgewwn, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Prin­ceton and the University of Chicago. 
A huge Mass was celebrated at the library mall. A few students

hurned their draft cards. The FBI was there, so some were arrested hecause it was a federal offense to do so. 
"Then everyone marched to the ROTC huilding, and people were carrying white crosses draped with hlack cloth," said Father David Tyson, then a seminarian and now University vice president ofstudent affairs. "The crosses had the names of Notre Dame alumni who had died in the war. The group that organized the event stuck the crosses into the ground all around the building." 
May 4, 1970: The Kent State murders were national news, al­though the story ran on page 6 of the May 5 edition ofThe Observer. Students walked out on college campuses across the country in response to the National Guard's action.

At Notre Dame. ~tullent~ were restless and confu~n.l. They ~poke of"freezing" their education by walking out in protest as well. 
The Alumni Board was on campus at the time. Members had arranged to stay in the dorms. and they conducted a teach-in cam­paign, attempting to convince the students to stay. 
Chemistry teacher Emil T. Hof­man, now dean of Freshman Year of Studies, sent out a letter to his stu­dents on May 25, 1970, asking that they not "over-react" to the situa­tion and that they consider the importance of the career pursuits which they had chosen. He also at.ldressed the generation gap: 
"Your generation is dissatisfied with the world my generation has hrought to you. Admittedly it is in a sad way, but it is indeed an im­provement on the world that was left to us. My generation, that of your parents, did much to improve man's lot according to the temper and needs ofour time. We did not bring an end to racial prejudice, but we did bring about .legislation and attitudes that provide a beginning. We haven't found a suitable sub­stitute for war, but we did bring about the forum for airing interna­tional differences. Maybe your generation will solve these problems. 
"It seems to me, however, that the chance ofdoing so will be bet­ter if we close the gap and join forces. To do this, we must first learn to trust each other ... A dif­ference cannot be resolved simply by pointing out and emphasizing the shortcomings of the opposition_ We must first establish ourselves

Cruz 3 hits, 3 RBI's sink Mets for Knepper, 10-3 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK· Jose Cruz, homered, 
singled twice, drove in three runs 
and scored three last night to back 
Bob Knepper and the Houston 
Astros to a 10·3 victory over the 
New York Mets. 
Knepper, 2·0, worked five in­
ning.~. giving up three runs on seven 
hits. Frank DiPino, the third Houston 
pitcher, worked the final two in· 
nings for his third save. Ron Darling, 
1·1, who pitched a shutout in his last 
start, gave up five runs, two of them 
unearned, on nine hits in his 6 1-3 
innings' work. 
Met's catcher Gary Carter did not 
play. He was diagnosed yesterday 
morning as having a cracked rib, sus­
tained Sunday in a 5-4, 18-inning vic· 
tory over Pittsburgh. It was not 
known when he'll return to play. 
Cubs 4, Giants 3 
CHICAGO · Shawon Dunston stole third base and came home with the winning run on a throwing error by San Francisco catcher Bob Brenly in the bottom of the ninth as the Chicago Cubs beat the Giants 4-3 yesterday. 
Top horses prepped for Derby Day 
Associated Press 
LOUISVILLE, KY.· Spend A Buck is 
a speedy Kentucky Derby con· 
tender, but the time that most im· 
presses his trainer was the 12 
minutes it took to remove a bone 
chip from the colt's knee. 
Spend A Buck had arthroscopic 
surgery on the knee last Nov. 26, 
returned to racing with a third-place 
in the Bay Shore Stakes at Aqueduct 
on March 23, then turned in dazzling 
victories in the Cherry Hill Mile and 
Garden State Stakes at Garden State 
Park. 
Not so long ago, the colt would 
still have been recuperating. 
"It would have been a minimum of six months recovery priod," owner Dennis Diaz said yesterday. "He wouldn't have been here. He wouldn't have raced until the fall." 
Instead, Spend ABuck rules as one 
of the favorites, along with Chiefs 
Crown, Proud Truth and Rhoman 
Rule, for the 1 )-mile Derby on Satur· 
day. 
Entries will be taken today for a 
field of 14 three-year-olds which is 
shaping up for the 5250,000-added 
Derby, which would have a purse of 
about 5600,000 with 14 starters. 
One who won't be going is Creme 
Fraiche, winner of the Derby Trial 
last Saturday. Trainer Woody Step· 
hens said he plans to hold the gel­
ding out ofthe Derby and run him in 
the Illinois Derby May 18 at 
Sport~man's Park. 
Trainer Cam Gambolati said he thinks Spend A Buck suffered the knee injury when he jumped a track made by the starting gate during the Young America, in which he finished second at the Meadowlands on Oct. IH. 
However, if it did occur then, it was not noticeable, and Spend A Buck finished third behind Chiefs Crown and Tank's Prospect in the S 1 million Breeders'Juvenile Nov. 10 at Hollywood Park. 
r 
When the colt returned to Florida, X-rays were taken, and Gambolati called Dr. Wayne Mcllwraith of 
Colorado State University. 
"He told me if you give him six months he'll be 100 percent, but I can save you three months," Gam­bolati said. 
The 12-minute operation was per· formed at an equine hospital at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, Fla. 
Dunston led oft' the ninth with a 
walk and stole second base. After 
pinch hitter Larry Bowa struck out, 
Bob Dernier was walked intention­
ally, setting up the possibility of a 
double play with Ryne Sandberg at 
to bat. 
But Sandberg, last year's National League Most Valuable Player, never got a chance to be the hero this time. 
With one strike on Sandberg, both Dunston and Dernier took off. Bren­ley's throw to third hit the dirt in front of the bag and bounced over third baseman Chris Brown's head into left field. Dunston ran home without a play being made. 
Dennis Eckersley, 4-1, got the win. Scott Garrelts, 0-1 was the loser in relief. 
Padres 6, Pirates 4 
PITTSBURGH · Tim Flannery's two-run double capped a three-run San Diego fourth inning last night as the Padres defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 6-4. 
Eric Show, 3·1, withstood a three· run Pirate fourth inning to earn the victory, allowing three hits until

a two-run homer and Rich Dauer added a solo blast as the Baltimore Orioles defeated the Chicago White Sox 3·1 last night with unexpected help from third-base umpire Tim Welke. 
Rookie Ken Dixon, 2-0, got the 
win. 

The White Sox had the bases loaded with one out in the sixth when Carlton Fisk hit a smash that went past the bag fair but struck Welke in foul territory behind third base. 
Since the ball had gone past a Bal­timore infielder, it was in play. Rudy Law, who opened the inning with a double, scored on the hit to pull Chicago to within 2·1. But Greg Walker, running from first base, ap· parently thought the ball had gone into the left-field corner and was trapped after rounding second. In the ensuing rundown, Scott Fletcher broke from third and was thrown out trying to score. Oscar Gamble then fanned on a 3·2 pitch. 
Ripken homered in the fifth off Britt Burns, 3·2, following a single by Dauer and Dauer hit his home run to open the seventh.

Hartwig a big boost to teammates 
By ANDREA LaFRENIERE 
Sports Writer 
How does one major in nursing, serve as a resident advisor, actively participate in school organizations, and still find time to compete in a collegiate sport? 
Ask Diane Hartwig, a member of the Saint Mary's track team, who manages to accomplish all of this and more. 
Hartwig, a senior from Princeton, Ill., maintains a full schedule yet is still able to contribute a great deal of time and effort to the Saint Mary's track team. 
"Diane has had to juggle her time since she's a nursing major, but she's done it, so she's really given a lot to our team," says Jean Kerich, track 

Not only does Hartwig compete in the javelin, discus, and shotput events, but she helps the younger team members in the field events, as well. 
"I enjoy helping people with their form. It's really rewarding to see ot­hers increase their distance in the field events," savs Hartwig. 
Hartwig certainly has the ex­perience to help coach her fellow team members. A track competitor since seventh grade, she was the county champion for the discus and shotput events in high school, and she received the Coach's Award 
both freshman and sophomore years at Saint Mary's for her contributions 

"I've always been involved in ath­letics, and track was one sport I really enjoyed. I love it," she says. 
Hartwig is pleased with her in­dividual performances in the field events this season but is satisfied particularly with her accomplish­ments in the discus event. 
Among Hartwig's other interests are the Student Athletic Council, the Student Nursing Association, the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and Campus Ministry. 
Hartwig was attracted to Saint Mary's because of the atmosphere and its good reputation as a small, private, Catholic women's college. She decided to attend Saint Mary's primarily for its nursing program, however. 
After graduating, Hartwig plans to work as a neurological rehabilitation nursing specialist for patients with spinal cord and head injuries.

run. With two away, Shields reached base when third baseman John Hemingway did his Pele imitation on an easy ground ball. Shields went to second on an errant pick-off throw and moved to third on a wild pitch. From there, he had no problems scoring on Trudeau's single to left, which gave the Irish right fielder his 41st RBI of the year. 
Meanwhile, Powell had a no-hitter going with one out in the fourth before John Vanderwal lined a double to center. However, the Irish defense came to the rescue, as Van­thournout barehanded Roger Mar­quardt's bunt down the third-base line and gunned him down with an off-balance throw. Next, Powell helped his own cause, making a leaping stab of Hemingway's one­hopper up the middle to throw him out and retire the side. 
Still, the Broncos did not give up, putting runners on second and third with one out in the fifth. This time it was Shields, who had already made a pair of dazzling plays at shortstop, that came to Powell's aid. The junior shortstop went in the hole to get Kevin Mclellan's grounder and fired a perfect strike to the plate to nail 
JeffThrans trying to score. 
A lesser team may have been frustrated, but to Western Mic­higan's credit, it finally got to Powell in the sixth. Hemingway, who had been foiled in the fourth, came up with a sacrifice fly to left to tie the score at 1-I. 
The Irish were not about to let this pitching performance go to waste, and the bats came to life in the bottom of the sixth. Shields started the inning with a single, but was thrown out trying to steal. Un­daunted, Trudeau singled and managed to steal second using a nifty hook slide. One out later, fresh­man Mike McNeill came up with the big hit, lacing a grounder through the hole on the right side to send Trudeau sliding home just ahead of Craig Fields' throw. 
With a 2-1 lead to protect, Gallo had Buster Lopes warming in the pen, but Powell quickly proved he didn't need anymore help. Throw­ing harder than at any time in the game, Powell busted the first two Bronco batters with strikeouts, before Mclellan grounded out to end the game. 

The Irish now have a couple of days off before traveling to Maine to end the regular season with twin­bills on Saturday and Sunday. They could use the rest, as several players are nursing injuries with the latest casualty being Moran. The Irish cap­tain left the first game with a bruised heel which has been bothering him since the weekend, and he may only be available for pinch-hitting duty in the Maine series.

Aleader or a follower -the athlete usually falls into one of these catagories, and either way is an im­portant part of the team. But now and again there are those exceptions to the rule, those athletes that defy the odds. As leaders in some respects, and followers in others, they become both guide and inspira­tion to other members of the team. Senior Cathy Schnell fits just such a role on Notre Dame's women's ten­nis team. 
"Being a part of this team means more than just tennis 10 me," she says. "!like to encourage the up-and­coming players, hut at the same time, I have a lot of respect for the other seniors on the team." 
Schnell places particular em­phasis on the friendships that have resulted from her participation on the team. In fact, after living her first three years in Pasquerilla West, she moved to Farley Hall this year to be with her teammates. 
"My closest friends are right here among the tennis players," says the St. Louis, Mo., native. "In fact, I would credit those friendships with my decision to stick it out for four years. Tennis takes more dedication than most people realize."

SMC Athletic Council names Cushing as president for '85 
By KELLY PORTOLESE 
Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
'!be Saint Mary's Athletic Council elected junior Anne Cushing as president for the 19H'i-86 school year after a question-and-answer forum in front of the present council and athletes last night in the Angela Athletic Facility. 
"I consider it a real priviledge that the athletes at Saint Mary's have elected me as a future president of the Athletic Council." said the three­year swim team member. "Although I know it will be a lot of hard work I am looking forward to working with the athletes next year. 
"'Ibis past year was the first year for the Athletic Council and I would like to see it continue to represent the student athletes and promote in­teractions between the sports on the varsity, club, and intramural levels." 
'Ibis year's president Ellen Byrne 
feels  the council  made a good  
choice.  
"All  the  candidates  made  

speeches, and based on them it was a majority vote that picked Anne. Ob­viously, we are all in agreement that Anne will make a great president," 
, said Byrne. The election, which was to have been held early last week, was postponed until last night due to a 
t ­
petition circulated whic11 requested a format change in the council's election procedures. 
Byrne, student government representative Ann Boulton, Elaine Suess of sports information, and in­tramurals representative Kerry Klein, interviewed and rated six can­didates on a point-value system and narrowed the candidates down to three. 
Cushing, junior Kim Kaegi and sophomore Jennifer Feeriey were the finalists selected, but in an open meeting requested by Director of Athletics Jo-Ann Nester, last Thursday, it was suggested that all six candidates be allowed to present a three-minute speech and answer questions posed by council mem­bers. 
As a result, junior Beth Kreber, sophomore Kris Pantelleria and freshman Rachel Bir were added to 
the  ballot  on  which  all  athletes  
present voted.  
Pantclleria,  in  her  speech,  

withdrew her name from considera­tion, however.

Irish reach .500 plateau with 7-1, 2-1 sweeping of Western Michigan 
By CHUCK FREEBY 
Sports Writer 

It may sound strange if you have ever watched a ball game there, but right nowJake Kline Field is the hot­test place on campus. 
Larry Gallo's Notre Dame baseball team took out its broom yesterday at the friendly confines, sweeping visit­ing Western Michigan, 7-1 and 2-1. The Irish have now posted a torrid 12-2-1 mark in their last 1c; games, reaching the .c;oo plateau ( 23-23-2) for the first time since they were 4-4 midway through the spring trip. 
A pair of junior pitchers sparkled for the Irish yesterday to lead the Michigan. The Irish also took lbe nigbcap, which way. Brad Cross has been the hard­enabled them to reach the .500markfor the season. luck hurler on the Irish staff this Chuck Freeby bas details at right. year, pitching well enough to win several times, but usually drawing the loss or a no-decision.

Cross may not have been well, but it was WeMern Michigan's bats that looked sick, as Cross induced the Broncos into 16 ground outs. The only run he gave up was on Kevin McNees' two-out double in the second. 
Notre Dame came roaring hack in the bottom half of that stanza, though, scoring four nms to give Cros~ all the help he would need. With two out and Mike McNeill on 
first, John Loughran singled to keep the inning alive. 'lben Bronco starter Joe Humphries ( 2-'i) went wild, walking Ken Soos and jackie Moran 
to tie the game at one. Rich Van­thournout followed with a two-RBI single to center to make it 3-1. After another free pass to Tom Shields, Mike Trudeau stroked another single to score Moran and give the Irish a 4-1 lead. 
Notre Dame tacked on a run in the third when David Clark's lead-off double was followed by singles by Loughran and Soos to make the score 'i-I. lbe Irish finished the of­fensive barrage in the fifth, when Loughran led offwith his third hit-a double into left-center. Soos' second consecutive RBI-single made it 6-l, before Steve Skupien blistered a double in the gap to score Soos and run the Irish lead to 7-1. 
Cross went the distance, striking out one and walking nobody. Despite his l-4 mark, the Royal Oak, Mich. native owns the third lowest ERA on the staff with a 5.09 mark after yesterday's outing.

"We'n: having qualified coaches not return because ofwhat seems to be a power-play going on in the ath­letic administration and the athletes are suffering for it. I'm really disap­pointed. I feel Dan worked well with the team. I feel like I've improved because ofhim," said Gisch.

been outdone by classmate Steve Powell, as the Buffalo, Wyo., righty pitched a masterful two-hitter en­route to his fifth victory in six deci­sions in the nightcap. Powell also had plenty of support, but this time it was from the defense which turned in quite a few plays that were nothing less than spectacular. 
Gallo believes that yesterday's games were just a sample of the kind of play that has sparked the tur­naround. "The last three weeks we've been getting great starting pitching, and that was the case today," noted the Irish mentor. "I'm really happy for Brad. He's only had one bad outing all year, and even then he was a victim of cir-
Gymnastics club has promise for the future after "rebuilding year'' 
Now that the school year is coming to an end, the gymnastics club finished the year with three tough meets: Purdue, School Craft, and Eastern Michigan. 
In the home meet against Purdue on Feb., 9, the gymnastics club defeated Purdue by five points. In that meet, Paul Nowak, a freshman, won the all­around title, while Matt Sennett, a sophomore, put in a strong performance in the vault with a score of7.6 and the high bar with a score of7.0. 
In their next meet against School Craft, a strong varsity team, on Feb. 16, the men lost by a slim mar­gin of five points, in which Nowak again won the all-around title with a score of3'i.2. Another positive spot in the meet was that the team as a whole scored a record-high 131 . 5 points. In their.final meet of the year, the men lost to another strong varsity team in Eastern Michigan, but were very impressed with Mike Downing's first all-around meet in which he scored a team-high 34 points. 
"Basically this year was a rebuilding year because we lost two men to the London program: next year's president Jim Ciesil, and Rich John," says Tim Sen­nett. "Along with Rich's gymnastic skills, he brings along alot of leadership skills." comments Tim Sen­nett. "Next year, the team should be real strong be· cause Paul Nowak will be a strongforce and with the emergence of Mike as an all-arounder, and the im­provement of hard-working Matt Sennett, the club should have plenty to build on for next year." 
The women's gymnastic club also had a good year and it had some very bright spots. 
In its meet against Purdue, junior Cheryl Sydow won the all-around title with a score of 29.4 and a record-high score on the vault. Other outstanding performances came from senior Dena Heisler, who scored an 8.3 on the floor and and 8.1 on the vault, freshman Jennifer Hoover, who received an 8.1 on

the balance beam, and Laurie Bcal, who also did well on the beam with a score of 7.1. 
"Cheryl should perform very well next year," says Sennett. "The only problem I foresee is that she is a very slow starter. lbe up and coming gymnasts of Jennifer and Lauric should also help out the team next year. Also, the women ofSaint Mary's, Maureen Durkin and Renee Conwell, will really help out the team with their specialized events." 
"lbroughout my four years," adds Sennett, "working with and coaching the 'family' has been very rewarding because the people arc great. Their future looks very bright and I wish them my best. We, the graduating seniors will definetly miss them all. Also. the team appreciates all the help Sandy Vanslager has given to the team amd thanks NVAand Saint Mary's for their facilities." 
WATER POLO: With the water polo season com­pleted in the fall, the team only had one tournament this spring in which it defeated Purdue, but lost to Northwestern. Mike Roberts led the team in scores and he and Steve Guenther were shared teams MVP honors. Marty Watts gained recognition by being the outstanding freshman. 
"I am looking forward to next year," says Tom O'Reilly, "because we will be returning most of the players: myself, John Coffey, Charlie Brady, Mike Roberts, and Steve Guenther. Also, with the building of the new pool, maybe our status as club will be upgraded to varsity, which is our main goal."
