Bush ticket distribution stirs controversy 
Wrong info on distribution time leads to problems 
By MARK MCLAUGHLIN Senior Staff Reporter 
Incorrect information on the distri­bution of tickets to today's lecture by Vice President George Bush has resulted in controversy around the campus. 
Fliers were distributed by the Office of Student Activities on Friday, said Director of Student Activites Joseph Cassidy. The fliers said in part: "stu­dent tickets available Monday at noon at the LaFortune information desk." The information desk normally opens at noon, said Cassidy. 
Starting at 8 a.m., however, 900 stu­dent tickets were distributed from the information desk in the LaFortune Stu­dent Center. 
Many students registered as Republicans with Notre Dame-Saint Mary's College Republicans were notified by phone that distribution would be taking place at 8 a.m. Several student organizations, including Stu­dents for DukakisBentsen and student government, did not find out the actual distribution time until late Sunday af­ternoon. 
"Student Activities took it as if it were business as normal," said Rich­ard Conklin, director of public relations and information. 
Conklin said the University and the Bush campaign advance team had agreed "from the beginning" that ticket distribution should be as early as

Student leaders react to ticket distribution 
By SARA MARLEY Senior Staff Reporter 
The confusion surrounding Monday's 
distribution of tickets for Vice Presi­
dent George Bush's lecture today has 
student leaders irate. 
Leaders of campus organizations 
representing both parties were dis­
pleased that the original time of distri­
bution announced last Friday on Office 
of Student Activities fliers was incor­
rect and that a lack of communication 
existed in correcting the error. 
See Senate Reaction, p.3 
"This is supposed to be a lecture for the Notre Dame community. Everybody should have a chance to go and ask questions," said Karl Kronenberger, chairman of Notre Dame-Saint Mary's College Democrats. 
Kronenberger questioned the fact that Republicans on campus seemed to be informed of the mistake in time to contact pro-Bush students. "The Republicans had a phone tree network, and they tried to get all the conserva­tives that they could to get the tickets before the rest of the student body even knew they were on sale," said Kronenberger. 
"I arrived at twenty to eight and there were already tons of people there gathered around the information desk. At 8:00 I got up on a table and said this shouldn't start untill2:00 since that is what was announced," said

Candidate Ward visits Psych class Other ways to see Bush 
Ly CHRIS MURPHY Staff Reporter 
Third Congressional District candidate Tom Ward made a surprise visit to Prof. Daniel Lapsley's psychology class on Monday. 
Ward, a 1970 graduate of Notre Dame, emphasized his personal philosophy that "what I give is what I get" in the 20­minute speech and question and answer period during Lapsley's Child Development class. 
The Democratic candidate 
encouraged students to make a 
difference in the world. "I 
would encourage you as you 
face decisions to find a way to 
give something. In that way, 
you'll get a lot back," Ward 
said. 
Voting is one way of giving 
something, said Ward. 
"Democracy works only if the 
people vote. It's the minimum 
we can do." 
Notre Dame students can

ELECTION '88 
have an even more direct im­pact by entering politics, said Ward. 
"We need good leadership 
. . . people like you in this 
room," said Ward. 
Students have also played an 
important role in his cam­
paign, added Ward. "It's a 
good place for those who are 
interested in politics to get 
started," said Ward. 
A key to succeeding in 
politics, as in life, is the realiza­
tion that "the only limitations 
are our own." said Ward. "There's nothing I have that you don't. You could be up here in five or ten years," Ward said. 
Ward went on to address his personal political activities and his race against 3rd Dis­trict incumbent Congressman John Hiler. 
Ward, who lost by just 47 votes to Hiler in the fall of 1986, said that it's time for'it change in the nation's economic policy. 
"I feel like I'm in an auto driving 90 miles per hour in the dark with no headlights on and there's a cliff somewhere out there," Ward said about the last eight years of Republican economic policy. 
Ward added his support for the Human Life Amendment but said that the United States needs to build proper "economic support structures because children need quality of life," said Ward. 
"Too many women have abortions because they can't afford children, said Ward. 
Ward concluded by saying that much of what students learn at Notre Dame coincides with the political world. "It takes involvement and giving of self. Take that specialness at Notre Dame and keep that spirit alive by sharing it," Ward said. 
lecture announced 
By MARK MCLAUGHLIN Seating will begin at 1:30 
Senior Staff Reporter 
Several alternative ar­rangements have been made for the George Bush lecture this afternoon at StepanCen­ter, but the "no signs" rule remains in effect. 
Speakers will be placed outside Stepan Center so that more people can hear the lecture. 
The Center for Continuing Education will have closed­circuit television broadcasts of the lecture in its meeting rooms. Doors to the CCE were opened at 8 a.m. today. The areas where television coverage has been installed will seat 300 people, said Director of student Activi­ties Joe Cassidy. 
The actual lecture is set to start at 2:30 p.m. today. 
p.m and ends at. 2 p.m:
Banners and stgns will not be permitted in Stepan, said Director of Public Relations and Information Richard Conklin. "What people do outside is fine," said Con­klin. 
"This has been standard procedure with all debates,'' 
,, he added. "We did the same thing with Ford, with Carter, with Reagan, with Mondale and all the other po­litical figures on campus." Conklin said that banners shown jn the background of 
local news broadcasts from Stepan yesterday would be removed by today's debate. 
The lecture by Bush is sponsored by the White Cen­ter on Law and Government. The Center provides a focal point for public law research in the Notre Dame Law School.

Dear Michelle Dall, 
This is in response to your Oct. 6, 1988, Inside 
Column titled "Cleaning up your act is a dirty 
business." 
I must agree with several of your statements. 
The sight of men washing clothes is certainly 
pitiful. Many of our sex do resort to ploys such 
as calling up random girls to help us, and 
making such a mess in the laundry room that 
any female with a sense of compassion feels 
compelled to lend a hand. 
However, the vast majority of the male sex 
labors through the laundry experience, doing 
their own laundry in their own way. 
First, you must realize that the clothes you 
see as a girl are not the same ones I see as a 
guy. You see a pink blouse made of 100 percent 
cotton, something which would look good with 
that new sweater your Aunt Jill got you for 
Christmas last year. 
I see a pink shirt. Period. 
And it's probably dirty. 
As I'm sure you've noticed, the average Notre 
Dame male couldn't match a shirt to a sweater 
if his life depended on it. Shirts are simply in­
tended to be worn. Ideally the shirt is clean -­
or at least pressed. 
This leads to our attitude regarding cleaning 
this hypothetical pink shirt. If it doesn't need 
to match, what's a little extra bleach matter? 
Logically, white means clean, therefore the 
more bleach the better, right? 
Remember, white equals clean. 
Second, it is a well-known and scientifically­
proven fact that girls are born with an innate 
knowledge of what shrinks in what temperature 
water (I think I learned that in Honors Biology; 
I got a B-). 
This is the only logical explanation for how girls know that that dirty pink shirt belongs in cold water (I think). As you admitted in your column, girls don't do laundry at home either; that's what moms are for. Therefore, since they couldn't have learned it at home, a genetic ex­planation is the only answer. 
This goes to prove a third point: some girl in Neanderthal times (or whenever they invented the washing machine) decided that clothes should be washed by color. Certainly no guy ever decided this. It would be much more logi­cal to sort on another principle. Many guys, in a rebellion against the status quo, decide to sort based on size, fuzziness, or location on the body. I give my full support to these courageous freedom fighters. 
Matt Gallagher 
Assistant News Editor 

? 

Another problem an average Notre Dame male has with the entire laundry process (or should I say fiasco?) is the veritable plethora of detergents, fabric softeners, bleaches, starches, little-blue-sheets-that-smell, and the dozens of other items "necessary" to make that pink shirt pink. 
All I want to ask is: WHY? 
Again, I find myself in the unfortunate posi­tion of blaming this on that very same Nean­derthal woman. This was just a ploy on her part to confuse the many generations of men to fol­low who would find themselves stuck in the basement of Badin with fourteen boxes of pow­der, of which they can use precisely one: All Temperature Cheer (Note the operative phrase: "All Temperature." How can you go wrong?). 
Luckily for mankind (and I don't mean womankind), the Fab Detergent Co. has created the greatest invention of all time. Bet­ter than the automobile, better than the com­puter, better even than the wheel: the "Fab One Shot." 
Imagine, detergent and fabric softener in one! What a concept! 
Now, if they only could master the concept of colors and darks in one...

American hostage claims 

U.S. blocked his release 
Associated Press 
BEIRUT, Lebanon American hostage Terry An­derson, in a videotape released Monday by his kidnappers, read a statement that accused the Reagan administration of blocking his release and urged the next president to do more. 
President Reagan denied in­terfering with efforts to free Anderson, and his chief spokes­man, Marlin Fitzwater, denounced the tape as "a cyni­cal attempt" to influence the Nov. 8 election. 
Copies of the 2-minute, 35­second tape were delivered to two Western news agencies in Beirut four days after Ander­son, 41, marked his fourth birthday in captivity. 
Statements from the pro­Iranian Islamic Jihad, which holds Anderson, accompanied the tapes. 
"On the occasion of Terry .<\nderson's birthday and in response to your letters, and according to his desire to send you a recorded message, we hereby enclose with this state­ment the recorded message on videotape," the kidnappers said. 
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associ­ated Press, began the message by identifying himself and saying the date was Oct. 30. 
"Once again I'm being given a chance to speak to my family, to my friends and to the Amer­ican people," he said. 
Anderson said his spirits were boosted by the birthday greetings he received, "But as my fourth birthday in captivity passes and as the end of my fourth year (in captivity) ap­proaches, I find it difficult to keep my hopes and my courage high." 
"I've been very close to being released several times over the past two years. But each time it seems that the U.S. govern-

ment uses its influence to stop any agreement from being made. And I don't understand this." 
In Los Angeles, Reagan told reporters his administration had done everything possible to win the hostages' freedom. "I don't think that was Terry speaking," he said. "I think he had a script that was given to him." 
When asked about the state­ment on the tape that the U.S. government interfered when the hostages were about to be released, Reagan said, "That is absolutely not true, but let me point something out. Terry Anderson is in that terrible con­finement at the hands of those barbarians --any information he has has to have come from there; there is no contact with the outside world." 
"We have been doing every­thing we can for the release of the hostages, " the president said.

Senate discusses Bush ticket distribution 
By FLORENTINE 
HOF.LKER 
News Staff 
Student Senate again suspended its weekly agenda, this time to deal with the con­troversy surrounding the dis­tribution of tickets for today's lecture by Vice President George Bush. 
In an unusually long meeting Monday evening, the Senate discussed the available details surrounding the event. They agreed that blame could not yet be assigned to specific individ­uals, and voted on a represen­tative statement which would clearly state their views on the event. 
The senate resolution con­cluded that the University­sponsored lecture is supposed to be non-partisan, but has since not become such. As a result of difficulties with the ticket distribution process, the audience which has received tickets is probably not repre­sentative of the Notre Dame student body as a whole. 
The resolution states that they "regret the manner in which the lack of information was taken advantage of." In it, the senate also said that they "condemn the manner in which the ticket information was dis­seminated." 
Mike Paese, student body vice president, seemed to cap­ture the general opinion of stu­dent government when he said, "I find it disturbing that Notre Dame students were involved with and perpetuated this event." 
The senate also considered writing a press release to ex­press the opinion of student government concerning the event, but voted against it, saying that their primary con­cern was for the students.

MBA Mini-Forum to be held today in the CCE 
By KELLEY TUTHILL Staff Reporter 
The annual "MBA Mini­Forum" will be held today in the lower level of the Center for Continuing Education from noon until 4 p.m. 
"The purpose of the Forum is to bring together as many top MBA programs from across the country in one set­ting," said Jeff Rice, Assistant Director of Career and Place­ment Services, which sponsors the event. 
Rice said that representa­tives from thirty-four schools Will be present, many from ad­

are among the prestigious progams that will have infor­mation available to students, said Rice. 
The table representatives will answer questions and dis­tribute information particular to graduate programs, said Rice. "No interviews or ap­pointments will take place. In­stead students can stay as long as they wish to gather informa­tion." 
Representatives from the MBA program at Notre Dame will also be present and avail­able to talk with interested stu­dents, said Rice. He said that this was particularly beneficial to students that are unable to get individual appointments. 
Students of all majors are en­couraged to attend because ''all types of majors enter MBA pro~rams, not just business majors," according to Rice." 
·'All classes should come to the Forum so that students can begin to accumulate informa­tion and make more informed choices about their future," said Rice. 
Abenefit of this Forum is "to help students understand the real purpose of an MBA and what it can do for them career­wise," said Rice. 
Rice said that students are also able to make contacts at the schools for the future. "The representatives are very per­sonable and students are usually able to call and ask for the person by name at a later date." 
In the past the average atten­dance has been 200 students, said Rice. "I feel good about the program because no where else in four hours will you have such an array of information available, " said Rice.

to boost the chances of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the conservative Likud bloc, who advocates tougher measures against the Arab uprising in the occupied lands. 
"There's no question it will help Likud," said Daniel Elazar, a political analyst of the Jerusalem Center for Public Mfairs. "For most voters, this will only reconfirm their beliefs, but for those voters sitting on the fence something like this could push them off to the right." 
Zeev Eitan, a political analyst at Tel Aviv Univer­sity's Jaffee Center for Strate­gic Studies, said: "in this elec­tion, that could be the difference between a clear vic­tory by one party or a tie." 
Polls taken before the attack and published Monday in the newspaper Maariv either gave Likud the edge or indicated a dead heat similar to the one that forced Likud and the center-left Labor Party into a ''national unity'' coalition in 1984. 
Four different polls indicated Labor, led by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, and its left-wing partners would win 47-55 of the Knesset's 120 seats, with Likud 

and its allies getting 56-65.

300 Rice student tickets are needed for mentally disabled 
By CINDY PETRITES 
News Staff 
Students representing the Logan Center Council for the Retarded and the LaPorte County Sheltered Workshop have joined forces to allow developmentally disabled children and adults to attend the Rice football game this weekend. 
To raise their goal of 300 stu­dent tickets, the students have launched an ad campaign and are manning booths in the dining halls to make students aware of their efforts and motivate them to contribute. 
"It's something the kids really look forward to," said senior Karen Maier, co-leader of the Logan Center Council for the Retarded. The Council, composed of Notre Dame and St. Mary's students who orga­nize weekly activities with the retarded community of South Bend has been collecting stu­dent tickets for the last few years to allow Logan Center clients the chance to attend one

possible since student interest was unknown. "There was a strong preference that (the au­dience) be students," said Cas­sidy. 
"We wanted as early an in­dication as possible" of student interest, said Conklin. "We were surprised to see such a response after the Hileli'Ward debate showed limited inter­est." About 400 students atten­ded the Hileli'Ward debate after a strong publicity effort, said Conklin. 
Conklin said he did not know Sunday that fliers had been dis­tributed with incorrect times. "I did the best I could Sunday afternoon" to get the word out, Conklin said. He said he had sent press releases to The Ob­server and to WVFI. 
Distribution of the fliers with the incorrect times "was a mis­take," said Conklin. "The whole scenario that there was a conspiracy is untrue," Con­klin added. 
"Tickets ran out at 10: 20," said Cassidy. He added that they were handed out on a first­come, first-served basis, with two tickets given out for each student identification pre­sented. 
According to Cassidy, 900 tickets were allotted for Notre Dame students, 200 for Saint Mary's students, and 200 for the Law School, whose White Cen­ter is sponsoring the Bush lec­ture. 
Saint Mary's students were notified by flier that distribu­tion at Saint Mary's would be on Monday at 9 a.m., and dis­
tribution was in fact at that

Two hundred tickets were 
handed out by the University 
and the St. Joseph's GOP 
received 500, said Tom 
Ehrhardt, co-chairman of Stu­
dents for BushQuayle. 
"By no means was there any scheme to mislead any student groups," Ehrhardt said. "That's just not true." He added that there was no at­tempt to hide the distribution time from the DukakiS!Bentsen people. 
But a note distributed by Stu­dents for BushQuayle to mem­bers of that organization and members of the unrelated Notre DameSaint Mary's Col­lege Republicans, marked "CONFIDENTIAL," read in part "Tell all your Republican friends (and not Democratic) to join us (for a meeting) and to also definitely pick up their two tickets . . . Monday, even if they won't use both, for we can re-distribute the tickets for them." 
The note did not specify dis­tribution times for the tickets, but several members of Col­lege Republicans were also called by the "Vice President's Advance Desk" and notified of . the correct time for ticket dis­tribution. They were also told . that it was "really important that (they) get over there and get tickets for support of Vice 
President Bush." 
College Republicans said they were unaware of any plans to contact students about ticket distribution. 
"There has not been any 
redistribution of tickets," said

the note. "We certainly had people using the tickets." 
"You can't blame Students for BushQuayle or the BushQuayle campaign for our superior organization," said Allison Heuring, a member of Students for BushQuayle who was responsible for the note campaign. 
"There's nothing wrong with making sure that Republicans knew the distribution was at 8:00," said Erhardt. 
"Some of the (non-Republican) groups obviously did find out," said Schlapp. He said that members of Students for DukakiS!Bentsen and the Anti-Apartheid Network were on the ticket line at LaFortune. Schlapp also said that he had attempted to call officials in student government on Sunday but did not reach them. 
100 tickets that were originally set aside for Stu­dents for BushQuayle were in­stead distributed to Notre Dame students who were put on a waiting list for tickets, said Schlapp. "We tried to make a gesture," said Schlapp. 
"It's a shame that a mistake resulted in phone calls that kept the rest of the student body out" of the Bush lecture, said Student Body President Tom Doyle. Mike Paese, stu­dent body vice president, added that it was "unfortunate that the typical Notre Dame student, whether or not he or she has a party affiliation, will not have a chance to hear the Vice President speak." 
"To people who say that can­didates are using Notre Dame, I say, where is the other can­didate?" said Conklin. "One chose not to come and one did choose to come. The one who did come obviously has an ad-, vantage "

ment. The person responsible for dis­tributing the tickets told Kronenberger he was told by 
the Office of Student Activities 
to distribute the tickets at 8 
a.m. 
Mike Bettencourt, chairper­son of Students for DukakiS!Bentsen, shared Kronenberger's views. "In no way was the ticket distribution fair," said Bettencourt. 
"There was an obvious at­tempt to control who gets into a University-sponsored event," said Bettencourt. 
"I got a phone call from someone who happened to be working in ticket distribution. I believe every attempt was made to contact the Republicans," Bettencourt said. 
Students for BushQuayle, a campus political organization, started a note distribution cam­paign to publicize the ticket dis­tribution to fellow Republicans. 
Members whose names ap­peared on mailing and phone lists of the College Republicans received notes from a group calling itself the "George Bush election committee." The note was marked "CONFIDEN­TIAL'' and informed students of an organizational meeting held Sunday evening in the Cen­ter for Continuing Education. 
The note read, in part, "Tell all our Republican friends (and not Democratic) to join us and to also definitely pick up their two tickets . . . Monday, even if they won't use both, for we can re-distribute the tickets for them."

Kronenberger was informed Sunday evening by an anonymous phone caller that the tickets would actually be distributed at 8 a.m. Monday morning. The caller also in­formed Kronenberger of the meeting in the CCE. 
Kronenberger attempted to attend this meeting to get in­formation about asking Bush a question following his lecture. "I tried to go over there, but they wouldn't let me in," said Kronenberger. He was asked if 
he supported Bush and was denied entrance when he replied he was not, according to Kronenberger. 
Student Body Vice President Mike Paese also commented on the confusion. "It may be within the rules, but it's unfair and manipulative," Paese said. 
Paese expressed concern that the University was being manipulated by the Bush cam­paign. "I hate to see us identi­fied with a specific political ideology," said Paese. 
"The tickets are out now, they can't be changed," Paese said.

Vote for Bush and Hiler 
The 1988 presidential campaign has mercifully entered its final week, with voters feeling disappointed. Neither George Bush nor Michael Dukakis has emerged as a strong choice. The voters have been forced to select the mar­ginally better candidate, and for this reason The Observer endorses George Bush. 
The primary issue of this campaign has been the eco­nomy. One cannot doubt that the Reagan administration has enjoyed a certain degree of economic success. His policies have increased aggregate output, lowered un­employment, and tamed inflation. These same policies have left much to be desired, however--large budget and merchandise trade deficits, a worsening income distribu­tion and a decline of U.S. economic power worldwide. Bush can claim partial credit for the successes, but if he wins he must address the failures. 
Bush can also claim partial credit for the successes of the Reagan administration's "peace through strength" stance. U .S.-Soviet relations have improved lately with the signing of the INF accord, for example. Bush seems ready not to revert to Cold War rhetoric. 
Two of Bush's weakest policy positions are in Central America and defense spending. The Reagan administra­tion's current support of the Contra rebels in Nicaragua has accomplished nothing yet has cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. A new approach to the region's prob­lems is desperately needed. 
 The recent defense spending scandal signals the need for tighter fiscal responsibility in the largest budget cat­egory. A critical look at the need for and feasibility of specific weapons programs is in order. Cutting waste from the defense department does not weaken our nation's defense. 
Although George Bush is not the most qualified candidate in the country, he is the most qualified of this year's choices. 
The Observer endorses incumbent John Hiler(R) for the 3rd District Congressional seat. Hiler has been competent in representing the people of this district for the past eight years and should continue in this capacity. 
Much of what a congressman can accomplish is based on respect among his peers in the House of Representa­tives. Currently in his fourth term as representative, Hiler has proven himself capable of serving his district's inter­ests in the Washington bureaucracy. 
Hiler also has proposed an innovative approach to curing the growing education ills of this country. 
His belief that a tuition tax credit program for parents who pay for private education is a positive step for those in the middle class and those students at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
Similarly, Hiler's willingness to support an open enroll­ment plan acknowledges both a crisis in the public school system and that competition among school systems can improve education. 
He has also shown clear support for recruiting foreign investors to bring industry and jobs to the 3rd district. Though his opponent shot down the issue at the student­sponsored debate last Thursday, Hiler recognized that this rust belt area needs industry to provide jobs now. 
For continued fair representation in third district of In­diana, exercise your right to vote. Exercise it for John Hiler.

Election '88: c 
Dukakis vows to seek progressive change 

So, you thought Ronald Reagan could not be president again? Think again. George Bush will make your worst Reagan fears come true--only worse. In November the American people have the chance to reverse the reactionary trends of the last eight years by electing Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen. If George Bush and J. Danforth Quayle are elected, the trends of the Reagan-Bush era will not only con­tinue but also get worse. 
Karl Kronenberger Thomas Darin 
guest column 
During the last eight years, the 
Reagan-Bush administration has led 
an assault on America's poor. 
Poverty rates have increased for al­
most all demographic groups, but 
children under age six and families 
headed by women show the largest 
increases and have the highest rates 
of poverty in each racial group. 
There are 33 million people living in 
poverty, 8.5 million more than in 
1978. 
The average yearly cost of two 
children in day care is $4,000. Bush 
encourages the private sector to pro­
vide on-site facilities even though 
today only one percent of medium­
to-large-sized companies provide 
even partial coverage of child care 
costs for their employees. Bush also 
encourages employers to provide 
health care insurance for workers 
and opposes federally requiring it. 
Over the last eight years the 
majority of new jobs have been in 
the low-paying service sector; how 
populations, but, because of lack of 
federal funding, WIC only serves 40 
percent of those eligible. Bush has 
no position available regarding WIC. 
Dukakis represents a trend away from catering to the rich and neglect­ing the poor in this country. Dukakis supports a universal, federally funded health care bill. He also sup­ports a federal commitment to day care programs and WIC. George Bush is obviously against homeless­ness but is publicly indifferent, and the Reagan-Bush administration's lack of policies targeting the home­less just fuels the problem. Dukakis opposes the federal government "un­loading" housing stocks, and he calls for sufficient state housing funds and many of these do you think will pro­vide health care? It also must be noted that the Reagan-Bush admin­istration has repeatedly tried to dis­mantle Medicare and replace it with a voucher system. Together, Reagan and Bush cut $20 billion from Social Security and tried to push through $200 billion more before 199.2. Bush is opposed to long-term catastrophic health insurance. 
The Harvard University Physicans Task Force on Hunger es­timates that 20 million people in the 
U.S. go hungry for some period of time each month--12 million of them children. The indicator of the health in our nation, the infant mortality rate, is higher than that of 17 in­dustrialized countries. To directly address this problem is the effec­tively proven Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). WIC has been suc­cessfully used in highly vulnerable new financial and regulatory strate­gies for dealing with expiring con­tracts and restrictions. To address the housing shortage, he proposes a National Partnership for Affordable Housing, housing incentive grants, tax credits, mixed housing produc­tion, and federal rental assistance. 
Dukakis represents a trend away from catering to the rich and neglecting the poor in this country. 
A Bush-Quayle victory would con­tinue the Reagan-Bush trends of malignant neglect of America's working people. An estimated 12 mil­lion Americans lost jobs since 1981 as a result of plant-closings and layoffs. For those laid off, there is only a 62 percent chance of finding another job within a year. More than 44 percent of the new jobs created in our economy during the 1980s pay less than $7,400 a year--35 percent less than a poverty level income for a family of four. Also, in the Reagan­Bush era, 84 percent of job growth has been in the two lowest--paying industries. 
Bush is not on the side of the Amer­ican workers. Every year since 1981 the administration proposed cuts in already inadequate child care pro­grams and offered no new ways for working parents to afford day care. Bush opposed recent legislation re­quiring 60 days notice of plant closings to workers. And the admin­istration cut funds for employment and training by 51 percent since it entered office in 1979. While Bush recently flip-flopped on the mini­mum wage, the facts of his seven years in office are that the minimum wage has declined 31 percent in real value. 
The Bush agenda and the Quayle record says NO to workers. They op­pose all of the following: collective bargaining rights for workers, the textile and apparel trade act, un­employment compensation benefits legislation, strengthening safety laws, labor law reform. 
Dukakis proposes a Fund to Rebuild America that will commit a half billion dollars a year to economy-building and job-creating partnerships. Dukakis also supports raising the minimum wage. He strongly supports American workers.

Bush may say he is fighting ter­rorism, but he allowed Panamanian General Manuel Noreiga--a known drug dealer since 1972, a terrorist, and a murderer himself--to conduct business as usual with our govern­ment. Bush also supports the Contra military commander Enrique Ber­mudez who was quoted, "We will see more sabotage, maybe attacks on Sandinista personalities, and why not terrorism?" To Ferdinand Marcos, one of the most oppressive abusers of human rights, Bush gave praise for "his adherence to demo­cratic principles and the democratic process.'' 
Ethics and democracy will not be meaningless words to Dukakis. 
Bush is also connected with CIA senior specialists who led a domestic propaganda operation to manipulate the media, the Congress, and public . opinion to support administration policies. This subversion of democracy was not fully inves­tigated because it was out of the in­vestigative mandate of the Iran­Contra committee (See L.A. Times 9-11-88).

Bush focuses 
In the 1988 presidential campaign, the family has jumped to the fore­front of the few issues the candidates have chosen to address. I grant that the candidates' motivation for lan­ding on this issue may be mere op­portunism, but the recognition that there is a problem with the American family is of great benefit to our na­tion. 
Marty Schrier 
guest column 
The traditional family, the one that helped build our great country, is fal­ling by the wayside. In the past, the family served to educate and to in­still values in our children. However, the pandemic teenage drug abuse, gang violence, teenage pregnancies, and illiteracy points to a loss of values and direction in American youth. 
This loss, which has been most prevalent in the past 25 years, has weakened the economic and social bases of our country. 
Not so long ago, divorce, single parenthood and unwed mothers were exceptions to the norm. People today still think that these situations are anomalies, but statistics say other­wise: 
Almost half of the marriages per­formed this year will end in divorce. The United States possesses the highest rate of divorce in the world. 
Three-fifths of the children born this year will spend at least part of their childhood in a single-parent family. 
One-fifth of all children born in the United States last year were born to unwed mothers; the figure for minorities is even higher. 
These figures should be cause for alarm to anyone who cares about the future of our nation. 
The lure of drugs and gangs in our nation's schools is stealing the edu­cation of the very people who need it the most: the lower classes. These teenagers are wallowing in a vi­scious cycle which is marked by the diSappearance of the family and the disintegration of the community. The family needs to be resurrected before these people can rise out of poverty. 
The middle class is by no means immune to the problems brou_ght about by the destruction of the fam­ily. With a large number of middle class families having two parents in the workforce, children are often left to be raised by friends, relatives, or daycare facilities. There is a definite loss of values and of culture when children are able to learn from their parents for only an hour and' ahalf per day. Our public schools and child care facilities cannot begin to com-
on traditional 
pensate for this loss of parental care. 
The 1988 presidential campaign has been deluged with images of family and the future of our country. The American voter must determine which candidate is best able to help move the American family in the right direction. I feel that George Bush and the Republican Party are willing to make a firm and sincere commitment to bringing the family back from ruin. 
While Ronald Reagan has brought economic prosperity, jobs, peace, and world respect, his attempts to restore the family have sadly failed. Minorities have been largely ig­nored, and that is where the family

tary of Education William Bennet, the public schools have improved, but there remains much work to be done. Unfortunately, the small yet significant progress which has been made over the past eight years in the area of family issues has been overshadowed by the various scan­dals which have rocked the Reagan administration. 
George Bush is not Ronald Reagan. George Bush did not like Ronald Reagan eight years ago, and I still doubt they are the best of friends. Bush has done his job, a loyal advisor, and he has done it well. George Bush, however, rises far above his former boss on the issues of family and values.

George Bush's understanding of the vital importance of family issues was evidenced in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention in New Orleans. "It is family that communicates to our children--to the twenty-first century--our culture, our religious faith, our traditions and our history." 
George Bush has outlined pro­grams intended to curb the trends which are causing the destruction of the family. A "toddler" tax credit program has been proposed that will aid poor mothers in finding proper child care to help the development of their children. George Bush will strongly encourage states to promote child care programs that will allow teenage mothers to con­tinue their education by remaining in school, thus allowing them the op-

recipients. 
Continuing education reform is also important to George Bush. The Vice President realizes that educa­tion is the key to our nation's future strength. Since 1980, the average teacher's salary has increased by 20 percent to $28,000 per year. George Bush intends to continue increasing the salaries of educators so that the best qualified individuals will be drawn to teaching. 
Civil rights have always been a concern of George Bush. The Vice President's promise to nominate a Hispanic on the Cabinet may sound patronizing, but it exemplifies his eagerness to have minorities in­volved in the upper levels of govern­ment. The Governor of Massachusetts is quick to point to 
his ethnic heritage, but his dealings with Rev. Jesse Jackson show that 
he does not really understand the needs of minorities. George Bush's experience with drug preve~tion_ a~d his h~rd stance 
on cnme will aid m purgmg two of the greatest plagues of families and the nation. The Governor of Massa­chusetts does not even have the sup­port of the police force of Boston. 
The traditional value system of the Republican party brings hope that the Bush-Quayle ticket can direct the structure of the American family. The quality of the candidate each party nominated is exemplary of the different emphasis the two parties place on traditional family values. 
George Bush's impending victory on Nov. 8 will serve to accomplish at least one vital task: reminding Americans that the family still does matter. We can only hope that, when George Bush assumes the presidency in January, the Demo­
cratic Congress will go along with his initiatives to help rebuild the American family.

ND women's soccer drops two matches 
By COLLEEN HENNESSEY Sports Writer 
It was a disappointing weekend for Notre Dame wo­men's soccer. The team traveled to Dayton and dropped both its games in a four-team tournament that in­cluded Dayton, Xavier and Wright State. 
Dayton totally outplayed the Irish in the first match, win­ning by a score of 6-0. 
"Dayton is the best team we've played all year," said Notre Dame assistant coach Neil Schmidt, who accompa­nied the women on the trip. 
The first half ended at 1-0 and 
Schmidt decided on a tactical 
change, switching to a one-on­
one strategy and taking out the 
sweeper. The idea was to stop 
up the Dayton offense and free 
the Irish front line to generate 
a counterattack of its own. It 
had the opposite effect. 
"They jumped on us pretty quick," said Schmidt. "We've never allowed more than two goals a game all season and it was a new experience for us. We didn't know how to react. We didn't play to our poten­tial." 
Schmidt said the difference 
between the two teams was a 
matter of experience. 
"Dayton has played a lot of good Division I teams," said Schmidt. "In our first year, we lack that experience against top talent. We are definitely going to upgrade our schedule next year. We've learned a 
lot." 
Against Xavier, Notre Dame played a more evenly matched game, but was unable to pull out a victory. 
"I thought we should have won," said Schmidt. 
Xavier scored early in the match, but Joy Sisolak came back to tie it . up for the Irish, scoring her team's only goal of the tournament. 
The game went into overtime when Notre Dame keeper Kelly McCrystal blocked a Xavier penalty shot with no time left. The Irish proved unable to carry the momentum into over­time, however, and lost the match on what Schmidt termed a "questionable goal." Schmidt thought that Xavier may have been offsides when the goal was scored. 
"We played better in the second half against Xavier," he said. "But we were still tentative after Dayton. We started to play our type of game. It was just a case of missed opportunities." 
Schmidt cited the play of 
K.T. Sullivan, Kelly Hanratty and Debbie Ho as being bright spots in the otherwise un­remarkable tournament. 
"It was a valuable experi­ence and it will show up for us down the road," he said. 
Notre Dame will take its 13­5-1 record to Michigan State on Friday to play the final game of its first varsity season. 
"Three weeks ago, Michigan State was ranked in the top 20,' said Schmidt. "How well we do all depends on our state of 
mind."

Women's C. C. places second in MCC meet 
By MARY GARINO Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's cross country team finished second at theMidwestern Col­legiate Conference Cham­pionships, losing out on first place by only two points. 
Going into the meet, the Irish runners knew that Dayton was the team to beat. They came close, but the final score showed that Dayton had the winning edge, 30-32. 
Notre Dame took four spots in the top ten, led by Lucy Nusrala, who took second with a time of 18:32, proving once again that she can be counted on to finish high for the team. Captain Theresa Rice was six seconds behind Nusrala in third, and Linda Filar was seventh. Rounding out the scoring for the Irish were Terese Lemanski (ninth) and Kevaleen Ryan (eleventh) . 
Dayton's Laura Schweitzer led the way for her team by placing first, recording a time of 17:57 on the 5,000 meter course in Chicago. Her team­mates finished fourth, fifth, sixth and fourteenth, en route to a slim victory over the Irish. 
"I told the team before the race that this would be a dual meet between us and Dayton,'' Coach Tim Connelly said. "To be honest, we should have beaten them." 
Rice said that while the team was disappointed by the close loss, they could still hold their heads up. 
"No one has anything to be ashamed of," she said. "We ran well, but Dayton is a good team." 
Following Dayton and Notre Dame in the standings were Detroit, Butler and Loyola. Evansville and Xavier finished sixth and seventh, respectively. There were seven teams, not nine as originally anticipated. 
There was some contro­versy at the beginning of the race. During the first 100 meters, there was a pile-up, and three Notre Dame run­ners fell. The officials didn't call the start back. 
"That really hurt us," said Coach Connelly. "Linda Filar and Terese Lemanski were two of the runners who fell, and they might have done bet­ter. I think that Linda could have been in the top five." 
Connelly was happy with the performances of the first five runners for the Irish, which he offered as a positive aspect of the disappointing second place finish.

Former split end Terrell finds home in secondary 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
Pat Terrell has worn many hats during his football career. 
A quarterback and receiver in high school, Terrell has jumped from one side of scrim­mage to the other three times since arriving at Notre Dame. 
A receiver-turned-defensive back-turned receiver again, the 6-0 junior was switched to the secondary once again last spring and has found his niche, earning a starting spot at free safety in the last four games. 
"I was a little hesitant about making another change this late in my career," said Ter­rell. "But coaches really can see talent where its best, and I guess if I hadn't made that change from quarterback to receiver in high school I would never be here. 
"Coach Holtz told me we needed help in the secondary as far as depth is concerned," "I was fortunate to have a continued Terrell, "and I'm a great game," said Terrell, team-oriented person so I was "but now you just have to put ready to do that." that out of your mind. It was a

those three schools," recalled Terrell. "I thought personally that I would get stuck in the state, but there's nothing wrong with that--they're all good programs. 
"But I came up here," con­tinued Terrell, "and liked how everything was--the academics and athletics combined. I know you hear that from so many people but you see its really true after visiting other schools. Reggie Ward and Timmy Brown were my hosts when I visited. I just found that the players here were more compatible with me rather than another place where I may have to change to fit in." 
As the starting split end for five games last season Terrell played alongside Brown but caught only two passes--for a total of 63 yards. 
"I was the other receiver," said Terrell. "I would see a lot of passes going over my head. It was frustrating at first but when you have the best player in the nation on your team, you've got to get him the ball." 
The football is not the only 
thing going over Terrell's head 
that he notices--he is a self­
proclaimed "aviation freak." 
"When I was a wide receiver, 
that was probably one of my 
problems," joked Terrell. "I 
dropped a lot of passes because 
the airport planes fly right over 
the practice field all the time 
and I probably looked at the 
planes instead of the ball. 
"I like to fly," continued Ter­rell. "I go up in Cessna 172s with friends of my Dad over the summer. I don't have my license yet though-I'm working on it." 
The pilots license will have to wait for a while though. Ter­rell is having enough high­flying fun of his own, denying opponents' aerial efforts for the top-ranked Irish. 

now. I'm sure I'll go home and break out the tape after the season is over." 
There could be a lot more to put on the highlight film for the 8-0 Irish by the time this season is over. Notre Dame jumped into the top spot in the AP col­lege football poll yesterday fol­lowing UCLA's loss last weekend. 
"It's a great place (No. 1) to be," smiled Terrell, "but we know that it really doesn't mat­ter too much until the end of the season. Our job is to just keep winning, and the polls and bowls will take care of them­selves. 
"As far as being No. 1 during the season is concerned," con­tinued Terrell, "in some ways it works against a team rather than working for it because. it makes every game even more difficult. Everybody wants a piece of the so-called No. 1 team in the nation." 
Terrell came to Notre Dame out of Lakewood High School in St. Petersburg, Fla., sur­rounded by the Florida football triumverate of Florida State, Florida and Miami. After leaving the warmth of home to head for a chilly South B~pd in mid-January, he, like many, was impressed with the people, not weather.

Rugby season ends with win over Wildcats 
The Rugby Club ended its seven-game fall season with an 18-12 victory over Northwestern last weekend in Evanston, Ill. Senior Mike Ryan scored twice for a much­improved Irish squad. 
"We improved steadily over the course of the season," 
said Club President Jim Lammers, "even though our 
season was plagued by injuries." 
Earlier in the season, the Rugby Club participated in the Indiana Union Rugby Tournament. Notre Dame took a fourth-place finish in the eight-team tournament. A third­place finish was in Notre Dame's grasp until the Irish decided to play the second string for experience in the

final game. 
"Experience is essential for the upcoming spring season," stated Lammers. 
Mike Ryan, John Monohan and Lammers all were voted to the select all-tournament team, which consisted of players from numerous Indiana colleges. These three players represented Indiana in a tournament that included teams from many Midwestern states. 
The Rugby Club will hold tryouts and training for the Spring season sometime in February. 
Squash Club continued its winning ways this weekend with two outstanding wins at the Joyce ACC. 
In the first match-up, the Irish beat up the University of Miami of Ohio 5-2. In the second, they cruised 3-1 against the Fort Wayne Squash Club. 
Graduate student Marcus Knipp won both his games impressively, and the rest of the team followed with nearly the same results.

Notre Dame  
UCLA's loss puts Irish at top spot for first time since '81 
Associated Press 
For the first time since 1981, the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame are bn top of the college football world. 
And since Monday's Associ­ated Press poll finds Southern California right behind Notre Dame, it sets up what would be the 24th meeting between No. 1 and No.2 when they meet on Nov. 26 in the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
Before that can happen, however, Notre Dame, 8-0, must defeat Rice on Saturday and Penn State on Nov. 19 while Southern Cal, 7-0, has to beat California, Arizona State and UCLA, the former No. 1 team, which slipped to sixth in the wake of Saturday's 34-30 upset at the hands of Washington State. 
Notre Dame, a 22-7 winner over Navy, received 44 of 58 first-place votes and 1,144 of a possible 1,160 points from a nationwide panel of sports writ­ers and sportscasters. The Irish had been second behind UCLA the past two weeks. Southern Cal, a 41-20 winner over Oregon State, received 11 first-place votes and 1,097 points in climbing from third place to second. 
Since the AP poll began in 1936, Notre Dame has won seven national championships, more than any other school. But the Irish haven't won ana­tional championship since 1977 and were last ranked No. 1 after opening the 1981 season with a 27-9 victory over LSU. Notre Dame lost to Michigan 25-7 the following week and hasn't been higher than fourth until two weeks ago. 
Notre Dame became the fourth team to be ranked No. 1 this season. Florida State was No. 1 in the preseason poll but lost its opener to Miami 31-0. Miami became No. 1 for six weeks before losing at Notre Dame 31-30. UCLA was No. 1 for two weeks. 
Although the Top Ten in this week's poll are the same 10 teams as last week, there was considerable shuffling. 
Miami's defending national champions moved from fourth place to third with one first­place vote and 1,041 points fol­lowing a 31-7 triumph over East Carolina. 
West Virginia leaped from seventh to fourth by routing Penn State 51-30. The Moun­taineers, 8-0 for the first time in their 97-year football history, received the other two first­place votes and 950 points. West Virginia was as high as No. 4 twice during the 1983 season. 
Florida State was idle but rose from sixth to fifth with 886 points, followed by UCLA with 847 points. Nebraska dropped from fifth to seventh with 835 points after struggling past Missouri 26-18. 
Oklahoma trounced Kansas 63-14 and held onto eighth place with 739 points, Auburn blanked Florida 16-0 for its 
· third straight shutout and remained No.9 with 715 points and Wyoming is again lOth with 658 points after routing Colorado State 48-14. The Second Ten consists of Arkansas, Oklahoma State, LSU, michigan, South Carolina, Syracuse, Clemson, Alabama, Georgia and a tie for 20th between Brigham Young and Indiana.­
