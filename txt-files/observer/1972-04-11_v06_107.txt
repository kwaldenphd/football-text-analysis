North's losses stall Vietnam drive 
by Fox Butterfield 
1971 New York Times (C) 
Saigon, Tuesday, April--Allied military com­manders said Monday that the North Vietnamese appeared to have suffered a serious setback in their drive into Quangiri Province in the northern part of South Vietnam. 
A count on the battlefield revealed, according the reports from the scene by American officers and newsmen, that the communists lost more than 1,000 ·soldiersand30 tanks in their attacks Sunday west of the city of Quangiri. 
In the wake of those assaults, the only battle reported in the area was a brief enemy attack on a bridge on the northern outskirts of Quangiri. It was reported repulsed by South Vietnamese rangers and United States Naval gunfire. Intensive artillery fire by both sides, however, was said to be continuing. 
bombing intensified 
Exultant government troops displayed two captured north Vietnamese T;54 tanks in the citadel of Hue, Vietnam's ancient imperial capital. 
The American retaliatory bombing campaign against Hanoi intensified today as giant B-52 bombers began hitting North Vietnam for the first time since November, 1967, the U.S. command in Saigon announced 
The command said the B;52 raids were being made "in response to the commmunist invasion across the demilitarized zone." 

seven jets lost 
It also disclosed today that American fighter­bombers had made 225 strikes against North Vietnam during the first three .days of the raids, from last Thursday through Sunday. Two U.S. Navy A;7 jet fighters have been acknowledged lost in the raids over the North with one pilot reported rescued and the other missing. 
Despite the heaviest fighting in Vietnam since the 1-968 Tet offensive and the step-up in the air war, 5,500 additional U.S. troops were withdrawn last week, leaving the total American strength in Vietnam at 90,000. 

South Vietnamese paratroopers on highway 13 effectively stem recent enemy offensives. 
A large South Vietnamese relief column of tanks, howitzers and troops dran from the Mekong Delta crept cautiously forward today trying to relieve the encircled Fifth Division at Anloc, 60 miles north of Saigon, in Binhlong Province. For the first time since the estimated 20,000 North Vietnamese troops trrust South from the Cambodian border into Bihnlong three days ago, there was little reportedfighting. 
major cities safe 
Saboteurs blew up a strategic bridge on Highway 
1. seven miles north of Danang on the central coast yesterday, temporarily stopping supplied heading for the Quangiri front. 
South Vietnam's major cities remained free from terrorist attacks again today. No major North Viennamese assaults were reported in Kontum Province in the central highlands as has been ex­pected by American officials. 
American advisers who toured the sites of Sun­day's intensive North Vietnamese attacks on the government's western flank in Quangiri Province reported that they had counted more than 1,000 bodies in three locations. 
"I was just masses of bodies everywhere," one American officer in Quangiri said, "The N.V.A. <North Vietnamese Army) really got a bloody nose out there." 
The battles took place at Dongha, Hailang, five miles soutliwest of Quangiri City, and at Firebase Pedro, 10 miles southwest of Quangiri. 
The South Vietnamese Commander of Northern Military Region 1, Lt. Gen. Hoang Xuan Lam, said at his headquarters in Danang today that "'this was the big battle, we have defeated them." Lam asserted that the North Vietnamese invasion of Quangiri "has now been stopped." 


U.S. officers confident 
American ofiicers did not make such broad claims, but they said they were confident that the communist thrust across the demilitarized zone could be stopped if South Vietnamese troops con­tinued to fight with the same courage and tenacity that they displayed Sunday. However, North Vietnamese troops of the 3248 Division continued their shelling and probing attacks on Fire Base Bastogne, the key government defensive position guarding the western approaches to Hue. The Saigon command claimed killing 182 North Viet­namese in fighting around Bastogne Sunday, with the loss of nine South Vietnamese killed and 46 wounded. 


Viet Cong attacks decline 
There were also two communist attacks reported Sunday for the first time in coastal Bindinh Province, which had security rating in the country. 
Fifty North Vietnamese and ten government troops were said to have lost their lives. 
Local Vietcong guerrillas launched 15 more assaults on government militia outposts in the Mekong Delta Sunday, though the intensity of their attacks was said to declining. No casualty figures were immediately available.

AL Council creates 'problems procedure' 

At a recent meeting of the Arts and Letters College Council (March 15), a student­introduced proposal to establish a "problems procedure" within the college passed by a wiue margin. 
The procedure, according to Dan More, one of the sponsors, of the proposal, is designed to provide an established procedure for students to get direct action on their ideas, complaints, and problems concerning the running of the university, the individual college, and Arts and Letters courses. 
student final appeal 
The procedure will also provide for a final appeal by students who feel they have received a grade they do not deserve, and have exhausted all grievance procedures within a particular department. 
The "problems procedure" will be mediated by students with faculty participation, and final decisions and recommendations will be brought to the Dean's attention. Further details and the procedure in its entirety will appear in the next Scholastic, April 14. 
extend pass-fail 
Also at the meeting, the council passed another student-introduced proposal which calls for an amendment to the pass-fail option "to allow a student to receive a letter grade in a course previously designated pass-fail if the student so requests prior to two weeks before the last class day of the semester." 

exploration of more diverse areas as the pass­fail option was originally intended to do. 
Pres~ntly, only 30 percent of the student body are takmg advantage of the option, and most of these earned good grades, according to Arts and Letters Dean Frederick J. Crosson. 
need University okay 
Other members of the council bellevea the proposal would involve tampering with an ex­perimental program, which should not be tampered with so soon, and would also involve tampering with the professional relationship between student and teacher. 
The motion was passed by hand vote with 14 members in favor, 13 opposed and 6 abstaining. Because all amendments to the option concern the entire university, and not just the college, the proposal will still have to be endorsed by the University Academic Council before it is adopted. 
It will probably be introduced in UAC before the end of the semester. 
Freshman director 
The Arts and Letters Coucil also unanimously 
approved in a voice vote a measure to provide a 
director for the Freshman Seminar Program. 
The approved motion read: 
"The program woUld have a coordinator who 
would also be a member of a department and 
who would, in his capacity as coordinator an­
swer directly to the Dean of the College of 'Arts 
and Letters."

Buffaloon trial for draft file theft 

by Cliff Wintrode Buffalo, New York-­It's again time for the courts to 
decide where moral imperative belongs in our system of law. 
Tile opportumty occurs as nve people accused by the government of stealing draft files and army intelligence files go on trail here beginning April 17. 
The defendants agree that they did steal the files but they don't agree that they are the "defense." 
They say that in conscience they had to respond to "genocide" in Indochina, American business "exploitation" of the Third World, and "crimes of exploitation"of people in this country. 
The Buffalo add that their response to these "crimes" needs no defense but that the trial is an "invitation" to the government to defend its foreign and domestic policies. 
And they insist that the court, if it is concerned about justice, must consider these policies and ask not whether individual conscience instead of the law should be the guide for one's conduct. 
I 
I The government is expected to say that no one has the right to break the law for any reason and that the court's only concern is 
whether the defendants did violate the law.~ Arrested inside the old Buffalo 
federal building last August 21 by'r FBI agents were Maureen Con­I sidine, a former SMCstudentChuck 
, 
Darst, a former ND student, Jeremiah Horrigan. Jim Martin, and Ann Masters. The building housed the draft office and the office of army intelligence. 
Indictments charging The Buffalo with conspiracy, theft of government property, and burglary were returned by a Rochester, New York federal grand jury on September 3oth. 
The defendants have asked to be allowed the full privileges of self­defense so they may speak to the jury members. 
"We want to speak to the jury as people, on a person to person level, because that's what we are about," says Considine. "I hope that by the end of the trial, the jury will have a fair idea who I am and who the others are." 
U.S. District Court Judge John 
Curtin has told the defendants that ~ each may make opening and, closing statements but that he will r wait until the trial begins to rule on 
i 
individual cross~xamination. 
The five say that Curtin has indicated a "willingness" to permit them wide leeway in court 
to discuss their political and moral concerns.

However, The Buffalo remain worried that Curtin despite his personal openness to those con­cerns, will "tie his human hands with his judge's robes." 
People have become "com­plicit" in America's "crimes" The ~uffalo will tell the court, by ac­tmg according to role instead of conscience. 
They will cite the judiciary's "refusal" to rule on the War's legality, the army's "refusal" to accept responsibility for the War's direction, and Congress's "refusal" to assert authority over the President. 
"The situation isn't getting any better, precisely because people are still saying that I am just doing my job and evading their moal responsibility," adds Darst. 
If this judgment is accepted as correct by the people in the courtroom, the The Buffalo will consider their trial to have been valuable. 
The vast majority of Buffalo residents are unaware that the trial will soon be happening. 
The two major newspapers here have not done one feature article on The Buffalo. They have not appeared on television since the end of October. 
The college media has made the extremely large student com-
The Buffalo Defense Committee is hopeful that many people from the Buffalo community will come to the trial related activities scheduled nightly during the ex­pected week trial. 
But the focus will be in the courtroom where five peoplf', who violated the law, will say that morally they had no choice but to do their action. 
And it is certain that some people present will provide future opportunities for the courts to place moal imperative in our judicial system.

Coun-ries agree to ban biological weapons 

oy Hedrick Smith 
(c) 1!172 New York Times 
Moscow, April 10--More than 70 nations, including the United States, the Soviet Union and Britain, signed a convention today outlawing biological weapons and, for the first time under a modern arms-control measure, requiring states to destroy their stocks of such weapons. 
The signing ceremonies took place in Moscow, Washington and London. The treaty will go into force as soon as 22 nations, in­cluding the three major nuclear powers, have deposited in­struments of ratification. France and China. the other nuclear powers, were not among the signatories. 
President Nixon, in Washington, and Soviet President, Nikolai V. Pidgorny, here in Moscow, took the occasion to emphasize their hopes of achieving a breakthrough agreement to limit strategic nuclear arms. 
In the ceremony at the foreign ministry, where 47 states signed the convention, Pidgorny declared

Nixon veils criticisDl of Soviet arn1s aid to North Vietnan1ese 
bv Bernard Gwertzman 
Washington: April 10--In an unmistakable reference to the Soviet Union's military aid to the marauding North Vietnamese forces, President Nixon said today that the big powers had a special responsibility to discourage others from mounting attacks on neighbors. 
Although no nation was mentioned by name, Nixon's remarks were seen as part of the Ad­ministration's effort to focus attention on the Soviet Union's large-scale military aid program, which has provided Hanoi with the tanks, ar­tillery, and missiles for the current offensive against South Vietnam. 
He said every "Great Power" must follow the 
principle that it should not encourage, "directly 
or indirectly, any other nation to use force or 
armed aggression against its neighbors." 
{ In a news conference last Friday, Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird had criticized the Russians for placing "no restraints" on Hanoi's use of Soviet equipment outside of North Viet­nam. The State Department had said earlier that the 10-day-old attack could not have been launched without soviet equipment. JNixon who previously had not spoken, even indirectly, about the offensive, couched his comments today in soft, diplomatic language that could not offend the Russians publicly or jeopardize plans for his Moscow trip next month. He spoke at ceremonies at the State Depart­ment marking the signing of a United Nations convention that bars the development and production of Biological and toxin weapons and calls for the destructionn of existing stocks of such weapons. Similar ceremonies were held in Moscow and London. Secretary of State William P. Rogers signed for the United States. at ceremonies here, along with the British Ambassador, the Earl of Cromer, Soviet Ambassador Anatoly F. Dobrynin, and some 70 other ambassadors. The convention goes into effect when ratified by 22 countries.  Despite Nixon's veiled expression of concern about Soviet aid to the North Vietnamese the atmosphere at the ceremonies was friendly. Nixon shook the hand of Dobrynin quite warmly before signing began, and his remarks were made without any rancor. Dobrynin, in his brief speech, praised the convention and said Nixon's 
I 
presence at the ceremonies was a good omen for future progress in other disarmament efforts now under way. 
At about the same time these ceremonies were taking place, Laird was asserting at the Pen· tagon that additional American air and naval forces would be sent to Southeast· Asia to show 
"the determination"  of  the  United  States  of  
counter the North Vietnamt offensive.  
The Secretary said that the withdrawal  of  

American troops from South Vietnam continues on schedule. The Defense Department said there are now about 90,000 American ground forces in Vieftlam and the 69,000 target level set for May 1 should -be reached. 
Laird, reflecting the Administration's fairly optimistiC appraisal of the latest battlefield situation, said that Saigon's forces were per­forming well and had "destroyed over one hundred of North Vietnam's tanks," in Quangtri Province alone. He spoke to a women's group. 
Nixon, in hailing the prohibition of germ­warfare weapons, said that the treaty will allow the world's scientists to "devote their entire work toward the end of disease." 
But he said that the treaty was only a "means to an end" --an end to the threat of war. 
"Insofar as that goal is concerned, we begin with one proposition, and that is, that each nation of the world must renounce the use of force, the use of aggression against other nations," he said. 
"We must also recognize another proposition," he continued, "and that is, that a great responsibility particularly rests upon the great powers, that every great power must follow the principle that it should not encourage directly, or indirectly, any other nation to use force or armed aggression against its neighbors." 
Administration officials, when asked later whether Nixon was directing his remarks specifically to the situation in Vietnam, said they were "not unrelated" to Vietnam, but stressed that they also had wider application. 
The Administration has previously chided Moscow for seeking to take advantage of tense situations such as the recent was between India and Pakistan, in which Moscow backed the In­dians. Nixon has stated that he hopes to discuss with Soviet officials in Moscow the possibility of an agreement on joint restraint by the two largest nuclear powers to avoid conflicts by other countries. 
that the ban on bacteriological 
weapons "to a certam degree 
opens up favorable new prospects" 
for curbing the arms race in other 
areas. 
"By limiting the sphere of the arms race," he said, "this agreement can also serve as a good example for solving other pressing problems of disar­
mament." 
This was read as a suggestion that the Nixon administration would be well advised to strike even a limited agreement with the Soviet Union in the strategic-arms 
talks in Helsinki, now in the final phase before Nixon's visit to Moscow on May 22. 
A parallel exists between the nuclear-arms negotiations and the lengthy talks that produced the draft agreement to prohibit biological weapons last fall. Initially, Moscow also wanted to outlaw chemical weapons, but when Washington raised ob­jections, the two sides eventually agreed to concentrate on the bacteriological issue. 
In the strategic-arms talks, Moscow has pressed for limits on defensive missile systems and Washington for limits on offensive missiles. Podgorny's comments could thus be read as urging the United States to follow the Soviet example and accept partial limitations on offensive weapons-­possibly leaving out such an im­portant field as submarine­launched missiles--rather than lose a crucial opportunity to achieve some agreement. 
"Our country," the Soviet President asserted in a passage directed to Washington, "ex­presses its firm determination to continue its efforts toward limiting the arms race, including strategic arms. We call upon the states of the world, and primarily those possessing the largest war ar­senals, to take practical steps without delay leading to the solution of the disarmament problem." 
News of the agreement, signed 
With a speed of 650 miles an hour, they have always heen considered vulnerable f face;to;air missiles ar: therefore kept away fr.;H ~· ·-"" where the North Vietnamese concentrated their missile sites. 
The decision to send them against North Vietnam now is taken here to indicate the seriousness with which the Nixon administration regards the current communist offensive. 
The U.S. command has refused to disclose the targets hit Ly the B;52 raids over North Vietnam. The command said that the in­formation would be made available only when the "limited duration strikes are com_pleted." 
Local Vietcong guerrillas launched 15 more assaults on government militia outposts in the by foreign minister Andrei A. Gromyko, the United States Ambassador, Jacob D. Beam, and the British Ambassador, Sir John Killick, among others, was given prominent display on the front page of the government newspaper, Izvestia. Several dispatches on inside pages criticized the United States for new air attacks on North Vietnam. 
In a step parallel to the news ot the treaty, also evidently intended to put the Soviet people in the proper mood for President Nixon's visit, the poet Yevgeny Yev­tushenko warmly recalled the jubilant meeting of Soviet and American troops on the Elbe river after the defeat of Nazi Germanyin May, 1945. 
"I like America" was the repe~ted ~efrain of a new poem, published m the April issue of the Youth Magazine Yunost, out today. 
It drew lightly on his recent successful poetry reading trip to the United States, though it made no reference to his 70-minute private meeting with the President. 
The 15-article convention binds countries, "not to develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise adquire or retain" microbiological or other biological agents or toxins except for peaceful purposes. The same commitments apply to all weapons and related equipment designed to make possible the use of biological ag:ents i? warfar~. 
The convenuon a1so reqmres each country "to destroy or to divert to peaceful purposes, as soon as possible but not later than nine months" after the treaty comes into force, all biological agents and their means of delivery. It also commits the signatory powers to continue negotiations for a similar ban on chemical weapons. 
The convention does not contain a provision specifically banning the use of biological weapons. This was considered unnecessary because their use as well as that of poison gases is outlawed in the 1925 Geneva protocol.

on file burning 
by Fred P. Grahan 
<c> 1972 New York Times News Strvice 
Washington, April 10--The head of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporations' Washington office testified today that he ordered the shredding of office files after columist Jack Anderson obtained a controversial 
I.T.T. memorandum because "there might be a lot of others in there like that." 
William R. Merriam, a Vice President of I.T.T., explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he decided it was "time to clean house" after Anderson ob­tained a memorandum pur­portedly written by Mrs. Dita D. Beard. 
Merriam's testimony came on a day in which he and Rep. Bob Wilson, R-Calif., gave accounts that contradicted statements made by each other and testimony by prior witnesses. 
"Somebody's not telling the truth-take your pick," concluded Sen. Quentin N. Burdick, D-N.D., summing up the day's testimony. 
The publication of the memorandum, which has touched off a six-seek investigation, linked 
I.T.T.'s "noble commitment" of up to $400,000 to underwrite the expenses of the 1972 Republican National Convention at San Diego with the Justice Department's willingness to to settle three an­titrust cases against I.T.T. 
Merriam said he ordered the 
destruction of any documents that 
might be embarrassing to the 
company of its officials. But he 
said he could not remember if he 
had ever received the one 
published by Anderson because so 
many memorandums cross his 
desk. 
"Not alleging the kind of in­
formation that was contained in 
the Anderson-Beard memoran­
dum, I trust?" asked Sen. John V. 
Tunney, D-Calif. 
"Well, you'd be surprised," 
replied Merriam. 
Later, Sen. Edward J. Gurney, R-Fla., drew from Merriam the assurance that he did not mean that the I.T.T. files bulged with other documents as politically explosive as the Beard-Anderson one. but only that information about foreign operations and in­ternal financial data could be damaging if disclosed. 
During a day in which 
ll<>mocratic Senators expressed 
mcredulity over aspects of both 
w1tnesses' testimony, the following 
statements were made: 
--Wilson, who represents most of 
tne San Diego area, explained that 
Mrs. Beard told him in late 
authenticity of the memorandum public relations man whom Mrs. 
have a sentimental attachment for her despite some of her ec­centricities." He denied that he was the one who leaked the document ot Anderson, but he conceded that it was written by someone inside the company. 
Merriam, a middle-aged man with a prominent double chin and a flustered manner, agreed at one point with the Senators­bemusement over this testimony. "Everything I say I get in worse," he said. 

February that she was not the author of the memorandum published by Anderson. Asked why he did not mention this when he gave three news interviews about the I.T.T. case in early March, he said, "I was never asked. "The first time the 
--Merriam said that out of fear of Mrs. Beard's wrath, he falsely said that he had received an inquiry from the White House about the details of I.T.T.'s San Diego commitment. He said the truth was that he dealt with the White House through Jack Gleason, a

was publicly challenged was when 
I.T.T. and Mrs. Beard branded it a forgery in late March. 
-Wilson testified that Harold S. Geneen, the President of I.T.T. made a "personal commitment" to t!Onvention' s expenses in San Diego. He said this does not contradict Geneen's testimony that his commitment was only 200,000, because Wilson was certain he could raise enough money from San Diego busi­nessmen so that thefull $400,000 would not be needed. He said so much has been raised that only about $500,000 willbeneeded f!"om I.T.T. 
-Wilson said, "To my knowledge there is absolutely no connection between the personal guarantee of underwriting made to me and a subsequent out of court settlement of various law suits against I.T .T." 
--Meriam conceded that he probably told Wilson on Feb. 28 that he had received from Mrs. Beard the memorandum that fell into Anderson's hands. But he said he has since learned that he could not have received the memo because he did not go to the office on June 25, the date the memorandum bore. 
-Wilson testified that Harold S. Geneen, the President of I.T.T. made a "personal commitment" to guarantee up to $400,000 of the convention's expenses in San Diego. He said this does not contradict Geneen's testimony that his commitment was only $200,000, because Wilson was Beard dislikes. 
After these comments by Merriam, Sen. Sam J.Ervin Jr., D­N.C., demanded: "How I can put credence in your testimony?" before the committee. Merriam insisted he was not deceiving the committee. 
Merriam denied Mrs. Beard's testimony, given last month from a Denver hospital room where she was a heart patient, that he had asked her to write the memorandum and that he men­tioned a White House inquiry about a possible $600,000 I.T.T. pledge to the Nixon Campaign. He also denied her subsequent statement in a television interview that he instructed her to discuss I.T.T.'s hopes for an antitrust settlement with former Attorney General John N. Mitchell at a Kentucky Derby party last May. 
Asked about statements by Wilson that he <Marriam) hated Mrs. Beard and leaked the memorandum to Anderson to "get" her, Merriam insisted: "I

A look at the Democratic primaries 
After the first four Dmocratic' Presidential primaries, the race for "Who Can Beat Nixon," as the game goes, appears to have en­tered a new phase. It will be a more wide open phase, since there is no frontrunner, and yet in many ways it will be a more close, restricted period, since most of the fringe candidates appear to be ready to follow the lead of New York Mayor John V. Lindsay, in effect if not in fact. 
For an explanation of events so far, and for perhaps a few clues to the events of the next weeks, let us examine the first four primaries and their meaning for the dozen or so men and women seeking the role of standard-bearer against an incumbent Republican. 
First, New Hampshire. This traditional kickoff state gave its Eastern Maine Senator Edmund Muskie, then front­runner, 48 per cent of the vote to George McGovern's 35 per cent. The results were largely in­conclusive, except perhaps for their elimination of Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty had a serious threat. Yorty hd hoped to ride a Loeb-inspired Manchester Guardian endorsement to a 20 per cent showing. He fell about 15 per 
cent short. 
Muskie picked up most of the convention delegates, but McGovern's strong showing in Muskie's aforementioned backyard revented the Maine Senator from claiming the resounding victory he needed. 
Florida was the first on a list of 
"key" primaries, a list that in­
cludes Wisconsin already and will 
no doubt include Pennsylvania, 
Michigan, Ohio, and California 
before the Miami cvention arrives. 
University acquires rare French books 

David E. Sparks, left, director of libraries at the University of Notre Dame. and Prof. A.L. Gabriel, director of the University's Mediaeval Institute, examine one book from a 15,000-volume private library recently purchased by the University. 
Prof. Gabriel negotiated the purchase of the library of Canon Jarry, a retired professor of. mediaeval studies at the Catholic University of Paris, and supervised the shipment of 287 crates from Paris to South Bend. The library contains particularly rich material on 17th century religious movements and also reflects Canon Jarry's interest in the mediaeval history of French provinces and cities. 
Every volume more than 100 years old--about half the library--had to be cleared for export by the French National Library, and Prof. Gariel noted that a great number of the 17th Century books were not in any United States collection. Stored temporarily in an unused campus gymnasium. the books are now being uncrated and moved into the MPmorial Librarv collection.

Conservative Senator Henry Jackson, from Washington, needed a good showing from a con­servative state in order to stay in the race. The all-time "wild card," Alabama Governor George Wallace, was in the deck, too, and Muskie and Minnesota Senator Hubert H. Humphrey traded punches for the first time since they ran together four years ago. John Lindsay competed with the McGovern camp for liberal votes in Florida, and Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm from New York began iring away. Yorty was entered, as was powerful House Ways and Means committee chairman Wilbur Mills from Arkansas. Former Minnesota Senator Gene McCarthy was en­tered also. 
ln Florida, the busing issue, having smoldered for a year or two, was fanned ferociously by Wallace and Jackson, and it ex­ploded into the only bona fide issue of the campaign so far. It may even be the biggest issue of the campaign in the fall. 
In short, the people just don't want their kids bussed, and they

score.  Humphrey  ran  a  distant  
second  with  18  per  cent  and  

Jackson, the other busing can­didate, ran third with 13 per cent. Muskie,· Lindsay, and MGovern were back in the pack, and some party leaders were taling seriously of tiniting·temporarily in a "stop­Wallace" effort, perhaps in West Virginia or Tennessee. 
Wallace won 75 of 81 convention seats, with Humphrey getting the other six. 
The Illinois primary was a simple duel between Muskie and McCarthy, and Muskie, or course, won easily, with 63 per cent of the popular vote. McGovern write-in's were second, getting the South Dakota Senator a handful of delegates. Since there was Iitle or no opposition, Muskie's victory did not give him the great boost he needed on the way to a crowded Wisconsin contest. In addition, an uncommitted Mayor Richard J. 
Daley from Chicago will still lead his delegation into Miami, barring major political upheavals in Illinois. 
Going to Wiconsin, then Muskie was still the frontrunner, Hum­phrey had not yet shown significant strength, McGovern and Lindsay were still competing for the left wing, Jackson was stuck with poor voter-recognition and an even poorer stage presentation, and Wallace was ruffling more than a few Democratic feathers, although not yet taken totally seriously. 
The only major issue that had emerged before the Wisconsin primary was busing, and only Wallace and Jackson took stands on it. Before Wisconsin, Muskie was still the frontrunner, but Humphrey, McGovern, and even Lindsay and Jackson were given a shot at victQry in the convention.

Celebration 
The Celebration of Self can be the beginning for St. Mary's. It can be a start for the school to emerge from the con­fusion and disappointment of the can­celled unification, and for the women to assert themselves as women and more 
. ' 
Importantly, as people. And, it can be a chance for St. Mary's to become a community--or administrators, faculty, and students. 
"Community" is perhaps the most abused word around here. It is used as a promise, and has been largely unfulfilled, at Notre Dame and St. Mary's. "Non­community," a lack of trust and in­dividual development is the rule. But the potential to care has not been destroyed, the hope that people can live in concert remains with many. It has to be tapped. 
St. Mary's students have taken the first step asserting their right to community, and their ability to live in it. The "Celebration" is a chance to sit down, relax, communicate, and find out what's been hidden for so long. Additionally, it is a challenge to women to determine their roles in society, without the limitations imposed by male-oriented precon­ceptions. 
Aspects of Liberation 
Women have traditionally been regarded as only limited participants in society, an idea that has been a drag on human progress. Women have been defined in stereotypes--the homemaker and little wife--and men have had equally absurd sex roles that they have been expected to uphold--the provider and protector. The advent of Women's Liberation, with the recognition the 
limitations imposed on people by their sex are without factual basis, has created an awareness that the prescribed roles are absurd, and that tradition is not a valid excuse for their perpetuation. 
The Celebration includes sessions that can explode socially-assigned sex roles. Both sexes gain from such a redefinition because latent talents can be developed without the stigma usually attached to engaging in activity reserved for the opposite sex. Latent and stifled emotions can be expressed. These are standard arguments for the "liberation" of both sexes. What many people fail to realize is that few if any of the potential benefits of these arguments have as yet been realized. 
History has rarely given either men or women the chance to operate outside traditional sex roles. But the social pressure of the Women's Liberation movement not only invites us to move out of this historical mold but effectively prevents any retrenching. 
Come alive ... 
The challenge of the Celebration is not 
limited to the few organizers, or the 
students of St. Mary's College. The faculty 
and administration of St. Mary's, the 
people of Notre Dame share in the benfits 
accruing from a realization of individuals 
acting in community. In all fairness, 
everyone must also share the price. 
Willingness to learn, to question 
assumptions, to become open to others is 
the investment we must all make in 
redefining both the male and female 
roles.

The Notre Dame Man-a nifty phrase invented by some unknown slogan-writer way back when to promote du Lac for unsuspecting high school seniors. It must have meant a lot to a lot of people 'cause it's sure been exploited since them. The image of Notre Dame has grown around its image of the Notre Dame Man--a very masculine image, one full of the discipline of a tough academic world and heavily influenced by the rough­and-ready world of football. To be a Notre Dame graduate was to be a real man! 
But is that the best attitude to have now? Obviously, attitudes in society change with developing technology and new generations, and as of late, the image of "the real man" has been enlarged to encompass the idea that each is quite unique and actually has some unique feelings. The "complete" man is one of many ideas and special nuances-his attitude are his own and he nowjeels a great need to express them. 
Don't get me wrong--men have always wanted to express their ideas and attitudes. But society, sometimes deliberately and sometimes inadvertantly, has prevented him from not only expressing them, but also from even wanting to express them. It would not fit the image of a "real man." 
But now, society is becoming more lax in its unwritten social laws. It is a very human thing to see a man openly cry, to see a man openly express his love in various ways, to devote much of his life in open pursuit of activities that formerly would have labeled him as a social outcast because they weren't entirely masculine. 
And then there_ is Notre Dame: stalwart defender of the masculine spirit, bastion of the manly image. The Notre Dame football team is still known as one of the toughest around. The athletic staffs of Notre Dame are some of the finest around; equipment expenses are no matter. The cliche-phrase "Notre Dame Man" is still prevelent on all advertising posters, and the national image of emotionless, strong, manly bodies striding around the campus of Our Lady persists. 
Not true, you say? Perhaps not to that extreme,but just look around to see examples of these traits. 
"Whatcha doin' tonight, Jack?" "Well I thought I'd go over to the Rock and work out." "But you've done that for the last three nights!" "Yeah, well, gotta get in shape; big section b-ball game next week, y'know." 
Exaggerated? Not a bit. 
Read the Notre Dame publications. The annual Football Review isue of the Scholastic this year included an article by Mike Mooney whose main thesis is that sometimes there are other, more important things to do on a Saturday afternoon than watch football. Perhaps there are; that's not my argument. But the response he received about that article was overwhelming. Blasted by students and alumni alike, for not showing the "proper Notre Dame spirit," he was called a number of abusive name for his opinions, ranging from "sick" to "perverted queer." This is society's new way of accepting a man, free to express his own ideas and feelings? Hardly. 
Try another eample. Watch your compatriots. A while back the Ob­Sl'l'\"l'r ran letters from students concerning the situation of gay liberation. In the letters, they expressed their regret that gays are unable to express themselves openly, even though he estimated that a good chunk of Notre Dame's population is gay. Admittedly, this is a subject that even the rest of the world is slow to accept and discuss openly. But the students expressing their thoughts were expressing them in a serious, straightforward manner. They were expressing a genuine, human sympathy for an oppressed minority. And what did they get for their efforts? Ridicule. I watched people reading the letters in the dining hall, and nearly all responses were of ridicule for "the queer homos," and relief that "we're not perverts." It was sickening, but I guess that's what comes of a university of of "real men." 
But Notre Dame is improving. A follow-up letter in the Scholastic admits that Mooney's opinion though opposed by many, is one to be respected. 
Follow-up letters in the Observer showed much sympathy with the problems of the gay. A beginning has been made. But will Notre Dame build on these beginnings? Only time, a great deal of it, knows that answer to that. In the meantime, then, I guess we'll all have to re-dan our poker-stiff faces, our Converse sneakers and face the world like men . And that's a damn shame.

participatory democracy

ultimate meaning. But I know that something in it has meaning and that is man, because he is the only creature to insist on having one. This world has at least the truth of man and our task is to provide its justifications

justification but man  ...  
---Albert Camus  

A few years ago, it seems like more than a lifetime to me, there was a professor teaching here under the auspices of the non­violence program. Those were what you might call the fragile years (I couldn't call them naive), before this numbness seeming loss of nerve set in. 
This Professor's name was Charlie McCarthy. And some of the things he said and did were, in this liberal arts haven, anethema, he spoke alien words within this plastic tower. Tried perhaps to convey in

telephone voting. Each person in the state would use a telephone to vote on each major issue during a particular span. There would be an unchanging numbfor a yes vote and an unchanging number for a no vote with the caller's social security and private voter registration number also recorded. The people would decide directly whether they want to live under a proposed law, whether they want to pay for a proposed law. 
The purpose of participatory democracy is to give the people a practical and effective means for rational non-violent change by consensus. As Senator, Mr. McCarthy guarantees that he will vote on major issues that reach the Senate floor according to the will of the majority of the electorate, as directly expressed on these issues.

Blood rock 
in concert tonight 
The notorious Texas rock group, Bloodrock, will appear in concert tonight <Tuesday) at Morris Civic Auditorium. Bloodrock is perhaps best known for their startling-renditfon of "D.O.A.", a relese from Bloodrock 2, which was produced by former Grand Funk Railroad manager, Terry Knight. Also on the bill are Cactus and Potliquor. Cactus is composed of two former members of the Vanilla Fudge, bass player Tim Bogert and drummer Carmen Appice and three. new members. Among rock musicians, Cactus has acquired the reputation of being experts in the art of demolishing Holiday Inn rooms, and their recent recording "Bad Night in Cleveland" solidifies their position of leadership in this field. Potliquor is a new group from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. All three groups appeared at last weekend's Mary Sol Rock Festival at Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, and were well received by the crowd of 40,000. There are two shows scheduled for tonight's concert: 6:30 and 
9:30. Tickets for theconcert are priced at $4.00, $5.00, and $6.00 and will be available at the door at show time. 


In this age of inflation 
Mike Bourn 
It's heartening, in this age of inflation, to find a free concert that would be a bargain at $5 a throw. It's also hard, which is why I rejoiced in Saturday night's Folk Concert at SMC. 
Consider. In lead and final position we have the trio of guitarist Paul Guernsey, singer-guitarist Jim Moran, and the inimitable bass player, Jim Donnelly. 
I can't think of the proper superlatives, suffice to say, these people are good. With a program ranging from a Scottish sea song, to Gordon Lightfoot's Canadien Railroad Triology, to the humorous Ode to the John Birch Society, they were (personal opinion) the best act there (and the competition was fierce, too). 
Moran is an excellent singer, and Paul Guernsey's fast and slick finger-picking can't be adequately described. On a banjo he's ... weli ... Listen, look him up some time and ask to hear, say, "Breakdown in Dm", or maybe "Breakdown in Am,",either one. Or call long distance, it'd be worth it. 
Next we have Dan Gellert, of fiddle, autoharp, etc. fame, and guitarist Dick Tarrier, contributing music of the moun­tain folk and miners. Gellert, with his 1ectures on history and theory of the autoharp, is an an engaging sort. Their music was artful and enjoyable. I thought so, the audience though so.hence it was so. QUO. 
Dan will be playing again at St. Mary's soon, in a music workship affair, this time for cash. See your local paper for details. 
Beth Griffith and Ann Burlas followed with some nice vocal work. Their soft music--Grham Nash's "Our House" "I'll never Fall in Love Again" was i~ odd contrast to Gellert's mining ballads. Beth and Ann's polished harmonly was ac­companied by the . guitar work of Paul Guernsey, who's talented that way.In­termission 

Greta Anderson-Dave Huezo. (She sings, so does he. He plays guitar and piano). Doing mostly Spanish-Brazilian material, Grea. and Dave lack a certain polish, but certamly not talent. Miss Anderson has the sort of voice you will someday have to pay money to hear. Huezo sings well, but his really obvious skill is in Spanish guitar instrumentals. (After calling up to hear Guensey's banjo, you might ring up Dave to listen to his "Flamingo") They received a well-deserved standing ovation. 
In a return performance, Guensey-Moran­Donnelly finished the evening. Since one is in grad school somewhere, and the the other two are graduating, this was one of their last shows together, which is a pity. 
There were some minor flaws, of course. Moran misplaced the first line of a song, Gellert and Tarrier more or less made up their program as they wentalong, and Miss Burlas should maybe use thP microphone more. All all concerned had to hassle with an often recalcitrant sound system. Pure perfection gets dull, anyway. 
Sponsored by the Student llnion Social Sommission, the freebie concert drew a more than capacity crowd to Carroll Hall. It was organized by Paul Guernsey, who getsaround.·

To a graduating student who was helped through college by guaranteed loans 
Fi111t -congratulations! You have proved you have wha.t it takes to get the education you need. And we know it wasn't easy. 
One important step you took was to invest in your own future. You did this by taking out one or more loans, guaranteed either by United Student Aid Funds, or a state agency, or the Federal government. 
These loans were society's vote of con­
fidence in you. They were equally your 
vote of confidence in yourself. 
By finishing school, you have taken the 
first vitally important step to justify that 
vote of confidence. 
The second step is to pay back the money 
you owe. 
So we hope you will make arrangements 
right now, before you leave school, to begin repayment of this debt. 
 
Check with your Financial Aid Office to be sure your records are in 01·der. 

 
Make an appointment with the banker who loaned the money to you, and arrange a realistic repayment schedule. 


You need not make your first payment until ten months after graduation, but you will be able to make other plans with far greater· assurance if you know now exactly what 
you will need to set aside each month for 
your loan. Meeting this obligation faithfully is one of the most important steps you can take­for your own benefit. 
Your repayments will prove your respon­sibility. They will establish your credit for the time when you may need it to buy a car, a house -and, some day, a baby carriage. Or a business. 
You will be helping other deserving stu­dents, too. For as each loan we guarantee is repaid, the money we have set aside to guarantee it is released to generate another low-cost student loan. \Ve have guaranteed over 300,000 of these loans already. And with your help, we look forward to guaran­teeing loans for future generations of col­lege students. 
So meeting your payment schedules will help you. It will help other students. And it will help society. 
Once more, our hearty congratulations­and good lurk as vou leave campus to make your mark in the work-a-day world!

But that's where it stops. They don't learn anything about it. Natural talent plus knowledge, a tough combination to beat. 
"But where do we go from here? I originally thought that a one­week strike wouldn't hurt too much but that two weeks could be trouble, especially for the pitchers. 
The hitters can bounce back quicker because they will be playing every day as soon as we resume but the pitchers must wait between starts. It may be necessary to work two or three pitchers a game in the early stages of the season just as we do at the start of spring training." 
What that will amount to will be 
the using of real games to regain 
whatever conditioning has been 
lost during the enforced idleness. 
Presumably, it will be the same for everyone but that isn't necessarily a correct assumption. For in­stance, older ball players don't crank up as fast as younger ones. Some athletes require painstaking preparation while others, as Seaver says, can fall out of bed and be ready.

McGovern beco111es cautious 
(c) 1972 New York Times 

Washington, April 10--Sen. George S. McGovern plans only a cautious courtship of the industrial heartland in the Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan primaries that will choose 467 Democratic con­vention delegates in the next five weeks. 
Even if Sen. Edmund S. Muskie neglects the Massachusetts primary on April 25 to improve his chances of a comeback in Penn­sylvania the same day, McGovern aides say they will bear down on Massachusetts in hope of winning it. 
Last week McGovern speculated that if, as now seems likely, Muskie relaxed his Massachusetts effort, he would follow the Maine Democrat into Pennsylvania and hope to take full advantage of the split there between Muskie and Sen. Hubert H. Hunphrey. 
But the top McGovern staff members who met yesterday to plan phase two of the nomination campaign said today that they could not manage two statewide primary efforts at the same time. 
The Pennsylvania campaign will target Philadelphia and its suburbs and Allegheny County, around Pittsburgh, but even in those big media markets the McGovern advertising will be limited to radio. The goal will be to win clusters of delegates but not a popular statewide victory. 
Gary Hart, McGovern's chief of staff, said today that the staff was still "assessing our strategy" for the Ohio primary mi May 2 and "running hard" in Michigan, where primary voting is scheduled May 16. But neither state has yet won a commitment of money, time or experiences national staff that contributed to McGovern's recent victory in Wisconsin. And in neither Michigan nor Ohio does Hart foresee a McGovern win. 
In the month of primaries after those in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, the McGovern camp hopes only to win Nebraska on May 9 and Oregon on May 23, but the theory of McGovern aides is that those will be enough to set up decisive victories in California and New York in June. 

Muskie changf:s plans 
by James M. Naughton 
(c) 1972 New York Times News Service 
Pittsburgh, April 10--Sen. Ed­mund S. Muskie, responding to brooding unhappiness among young members of his Presidential campaign staff, paid a visit to his Washington headquarters this morning to declare that he was going to "work like hell" for the Democratic nomination "until the last delegate vote is counted in Miami Beach in July." 
The Maine Senator's pep talk to some 100 workers and volunteers apparently was prompted by complaints made at a lengthy meeting in the headquarters last Thursday, when young supporters protested bitterly of a "Berlin Wall" between them and the candidate. They demanded an opportunity to tell Muskie that his faltering campaign was burning up resources in states such as Florida and Wisconsin-where he came in fourth in primaries--and that such funds should be used to build grass roots support in key states.

Live interview with Dr. Stein 
White House answers to such questions as the state of the economy in the wake of Phase II, the continuing threat of inflation, and the nation's unfavorable I

"We're going to go where the delegates are and in those areas where our chance of getting delegates is best," Muskie said here. 
He listed the primaries in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts on April 25, Ohio on May 2, California on June 6 and New York on June 20. 
The Senator said he would 
·resolve the dilemma posed by confrontations the same day with Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey iri Pennsylvania and Sen. George McGovern in Massachusetts by asking supporters in the two states to shoulder much of the effort. 
ND grad leads coup 
Jose Napoleon Suarte, mentioned in wire service accounts as a leader of Sunday's abortive coup in El Salvador, is a 1948 civil engineering graduate fo the University of Notre Dame. 
News accounts have noted his Feb.20 loss in the country's presidential election, inwhich he headed a Leftist coalition. ' Duarte, 46, has had his own engineering firm in San Salvador and has served three terms as mayor of the city. 
At last reports, Duarte was under arrest. Father Hesburgh is attempting, through Chruch and government channels, to insure his safety, according to Richard W. Conklin, Director of MD In­formation Services. 
Advisors. ~--------------------------t-
Seated in his Washington office I Stein will answer questions sub~ mitted by students in their Notre . Dame classroom during a class ' period beginning at 1:15 pm. An 
amplified phone system with remote control microphones will permit the students to pursue certain topics introduced in the 
conver~ation. 
The um~ue system, since its introduction at Notre Dame last year, has resulted in live con­versations with noted authorities in various fields from wid_ely separated areas of the nation. One 
-class in international finance used the system earlier this year to maintain regular meetings with their professor, LeClaire Eels, when he was confined to his bed after an op_eration.
