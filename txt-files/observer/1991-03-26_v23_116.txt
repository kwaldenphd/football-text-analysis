Saddam steals $1 0 billion in oil profits 
NEW YOHK (AP) -The head of th(l company hired by the Kuwaiti government to find out the size and location of Saddam Hussein's wealth estimates the Iraqi president's family has skimmed $10 billion in oil profilr; since 1981. 
Jules Kroll also says Iraqi in­vestors working for Saddam have purchased nearly $1 bil­lion worth of shares in public companies, including Paris­based llachette SA, one of the world's largest media compa­nies. Kroll says the stock pur­chases were made by Saddam's half-brother and several Iraqi directors.

In yesterdays' Student Senate elections, 27 votes prevented a clear winner in the district one race, which has recently taken a racial focus that candidate Billy Allen called, "ridiculous." 

The three other campus con­tests resulted in decided victo­ries for Kristi Shafer, Joe Wil­son, and Bong Miquibas, but the off-campus race will pit the Jim Gordon-Brian Murphy ticket and the Kristen llarknett-Ellen Lanser in the Wednesday's run-off. 
The votes for the off-campus election were 71 to 68, respec­tively. 
Shafer claimed the district two position with 52.4 percent of the vote. Matthew Bomberger, the only other can­didate from this district, took 
43.9 percent of the vote. 
In district three, Miquibas won with 456 votes to Jorge Vera's 283 votes. "I am going to

work to deliver what I said I was going to do in my cam­paign," Miquibas said. 
Wilson ran an uncontested race in district four. 

A 3.1 percent difference in votes between Billy Allen and . Paul Peralez made a run-off election necessary in district one. Allen received 288 votes broadcast Sunday by CBS News' "60 Minutes." 
Kroll described Saddam, who took power in 1979, a.s one of the world's richest men. 
The reports quoted Kroll as saying Saddam and his family have skimmed up to 5 percent of Iraq's $200 billion in oil sales since 1981. Kroll also said he found evidence they siphoned an average of 2.5 percent off contracts with Japanese companies. 
The Financial Times report did not address whether any of the holdings could be classified as ill-gotten gains under U.N. resolutions adopted after Iraq's August 2 invasion of Kuwait. Those resolutions intended to force Iraq to relinquish Kuwait and recover plundered Kuwaiti assets. 
The CBS report, quoting 
Kroll, said Iraq had moved some of its money to circum­vent a freeze on overseas Iraqi accounts. 
Kroll said Iraq transferred huge sums in early August to Jordanian banks. He also said Kuwaiti luxury vehicles stolen by Iraq's occupation forces were shipped to Europe on a Royal Jordanian Airlines cargo flight, some turning up at Iraq's Embassy in Geneva. 
Asked whether Saddam's agents were still salting away money, including assets looted from Kuwait, he said, "I would judge that is the case, yes.".

Better grad. program to improve undergrad 
By MEGAN JUNIUS 
News Writer 
The University of Notre Dame believes by strengthening the caliber of the graduate pro­gram, that the quality of un­dergraduate education will im­prove as well, according to Pro­fessor Nathan Hatch, vice president for advanced studies. 
Hatch, along with Rev. Ed­
ward "Monk" Malloy, president 
of the University and Professor 
Francis Castellino, dean of the 
College of Sciences, discussed 
the role of the graduate student 
teaching and researching at 
Notre Dame during a lecture 
Monday evening. 
According to Hatch, the Uni­versity is facing the new chal­lenge of bringing the quality of the graduate level education up to that of the level of education that an undergraduate receives at Notre Dame. 
"When receiving a graduate level education, it is imperative to learn both how to teach as well as how to research," he said. "When giving a graduate level education, Notre Dame feels the responsibility of train­ing teachers and researchers of the next generation of aca­demic scholars." 
Hatch believes Notre Dame is in the position to build a quality graduate program because the foundation has already been laid during the past 20 years. 

"Notre Dame has worked im­proving the faculty. The Uni­versity did so by improving the salaries of professors as well as decreasing the teaching loads. This has attracted an outstanding junior and senior faculty," he said. 
"Now we are striving to the building of research laborato­ries. We see the University in­creasing the infer structure for suits were announced. "I just want to point out that Billy Allen has voted for Students United For Respect through the NAACP. I would be a vote of reason." 
While campaigning in Dillon Hall last night around 11 p.m., Allen said he spotted Peralez hanging up posters reading, "That S.U.F.R. guy from Alumni vs. Paul of Dillon Hall." 
Allen said he asked Peralez what he was doing, and asked that the posters be removed be­cause the information on them was incorrect. 
Allen stressed that he is not a member of SUFR, and said that he did not, as a student senator this year, ever take part in any vote regarding SUFR. 
"The signs have been removed totally," Peralez responded after the incident occurred. He explained that he took them down immediately after the conversation with Allen. 
The posters were "definitely

graduate research," Hatch 
added. 
As a Catholic research uni­
versity, Hatch wants to see that 
values are freely explored. 
"The religious component at 
Notre Dame should play a 
role," he said. 
Finally, "Graduate students 
should expect personal atten­
tion; this is a face to face uni­
versity," Hatch said. 
Malloy feels that the graduate 
level at Notre Dame should im­
prove as the graduate stipend 
increases. 
"One of the greatest problems is that many of the Notre Dame money-giving alumni only par­ticipated in the undergraduate program at Notre Dame, there­fore giving only to the under­graduate program. Tuition and endowment provides for the undergraduate program. Research programs are more expensive," he said. 
Malloy said Notre Dame does not have the funds to research every area; therefore the Uni­versity has focused on particu­lar areas and will broaden at the graduate level as the funds allow. 
According to Malloy, as rc searching costs continue to rise, public universities will no longer have enough funds to spread out research. There­fore, these universities will suf­fer from cutbacks, possibly losing students to smaller, growing graduate programs, such as that at Notre Dame, he said. 

Malloy also stressed the graduate student not only as a teacher and researcher, but as a student as well. "Becoming a graduate student requires fi­nancial, social and personal sacrifices," he said, "It re­quires one to reevaluate oneself

Quasimodo should be ND mascot 
Freshman year was pretty------­rough. I couldn't figure out why there weren't any books in the Bookstore (only shot glasses and facial tattoos). I never did fmd my French class (subsequently, my grasp of the language Paige Smoron 
never progressed beyond Assistant Accent my high school Edjtor memorization of the "Hail Mary"). And I'll never forget the day the Notre Dame mystique was irreparably shattered for me. I was mercilessly informed that there was no hunchback here. Indeed, hardly anyone even limps. I'm sure I'm not alone in this tragic 
misunderstanding. How many of you listen to Sacred Heart chime the Alma Mater and mentally envision a magnificent, hulking, swinging creature up in the bell tower? How many of you are here on false pretenses? To prevent any further confusion, I read Victor Hugo's "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," and learned that the reason it doesn't sell nearly as well as "God, Country,· Notre Dame" is be~ause it's actually based on that other Notre Dame, a less popular university in France, famous only for its Alchemy Institute. And, of course, for its grotesque (but well­meaning) hunchback, who apparently spent his time (in between ringing largish bells) pouring molten lead on the heads of peasants. The guy had style. So what are we doing with a weenie leprechaun? My proposal (Will you marry me?) is that we dump the annoying green dwarf and latch onto the hunchback as our new mascot. While I realize it will be difficult to fmd something to rhyme with "Quasimodo" in the Fight Song, I feel strongly that such a move will ultimately be beneficial to the Notre Dame community.We must cast off the tinge of ethnic stereotypes. "The Fightin' Irish" blatantly and ignorantly promotes a harmful image of an entire nationality. What's next? Where will the malevolent slurs end? "The Irritable Italians?" "The Grouchy Greeks?" I could go on, but I'll refrain. Oh, I can't. "The Testy Turks?" "The Resentful Russians?" "The Belligerent Brits?" "The Sullen Sri Lankans .... ?" Besides, I have it on good authority (someone who did find their French class) that "Notre Dame du Lac" is far from Irish, so wouldn't it be more appropriate to go with something like "The Feisty French?" Nay. With the hunchback as a mascot or team name, we would be taking advantage of a natural association, we would be culturally correct, and we would we be far more intimidating. And with a genuine freak of nature and reject of society, just think of how the tourist trade will boom. The commercial possibilities are endless. Quasimodo could moonlight giving campus tours. Instead of genial shamrock facial tattoos, the Bookstore could hawk stick­on warts.

Bostwick resolves proper hygiene for 1991-92 
By DAVID KINNEY Assistant News Editor 
Student Senate headlined its light-hearted final meeting un­der 1990-91 officers with a resolution calling for proper dental hygiene to become a campus-wide priority. 
Lisa Bostwick, district 2 sen­ator who submitted the resolu­tion, emphasized that uit's defi­nitely an Issue that all the members of the Notre Dame community can take to heart." 
The document, which was passed unanimously, operates on the premise that poor dental hygiene unegatlvely impacts the Interfacing of members of the Notre Dame family and is con­trary to the mission of the Uni­versity." 
The Bostwick resolution calls for the issue to be addressed by appropriate bodies, including the University Ad Hoc Parking Committee and the Sophomore Literary Fest, that training in proper hygiene become a part of Hesldence Hall Staff Training and other orientation pro­
grams. 
Finally, the resolution de­mands that 1991-92 be desig­nated the Year of Proper Dental Hygiene. 
"I think this would greatly Improve male-female rela­tions," Student Body President Hob Pasin added. 
In other senate business: 
1991-92 Treasurer John Coffey raised the Issue of the nine percent tuition increase and six percent room and board increase next year. Coffey questioned whether the administration is really still concerned with undergraduate financing. 
ulf is keeps going like that," he said, "you're looking at-in a couple of years-a lot of people, even in this room, won't be able to come here or it's going to be an extreme sacrifice on their family." 
Coffey pointed out that NO will not have enough students to fill all the new buildings on campus. 
u Are we really getting our tu­ition money's worth? Are we getting teachers that are con­cerned about students?" he asked. 
The 
senators approved the Student Union Board Executive Council for 1991-92. Lynn Ramsay will take over as board manager; Beth Wittman will become director of program­ming; Heather Burns has been selected for director of market­ing; Kristina Hannam will serve as director of relations; and Chris Weismantel will take over as controller.

Robert Scheidt, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Notre Dame, was recently elected a fellow of The Ameri­can Association for the Ad­vancement of Science (AAAS). 
There are approxi'Yiately 140,000 members of this orga­nization and only five percent receive this honor. 
Scheidt said he was elected fellow as a result of his more than twenty years of extensive publication. According to Scheidt, members receive fel­lowships in reward for distinct contributions to the scientific field. 
Scheidt's research attempts to umake a variety of different metalloporphyrin sy~~ems and determine their molecular structures and try to relate those structures to -other chem­ical and physical properties," he said. 

Robert Scheidt 
According to Scheidt, his re­search explores complexities not understood as recently as twenty years ago. His general goal is to explore ueverything there is to understand" about the important biological molecule metalloporphyrins. Scheidt said he studies these molecules by relating struc­tures to properties. 
From your Catbutt friends! Love, Cyn, Mark, Stan, Joe, Kate, and the rest of the gang. 
The advancement of science Is the organizational goal of the AAAS, according to Scheidt. uThere are certain questions one feels compelled to answer simply because they're there," he said. 
The AAAS publishes a weekly magazine, Science, which re­ports what is happening in science over a wide range of topics, said Scheidt. His new fellowship will be announced in a future issue of the magazine. 
Scheidt has been a professor at Notre Dame since 1970. He received his bachelor's degree in chemistry at the University of Missouri at Columbia in 1964. He then received a doc­torate at Michigan and went on to do his post-doctoral research work at Cornell University. This year he is teaching honor's general chemistry. 
Scheidt has been invited by the University of Paris to guest lecture at the University this summer.

I LOS ANGELES (AP) ­
' "Dances With Wolves," Kevin Costner's three-hour Western that was initially scorned by Hollywood, dominated the Academy Awards on Monday night with seven Oscars, includ­ing best picture and director. 
Kathy Bates, the demented recluse in "Misery," and Jeremy Irons, the sinister Claus Von Bulow of "Reversal of Fortune," won Academy Awards for best leading performances. 
"Dances," which had led with 12 nominations, also won for sound, original score, film edit­ing, cinematography and Michael Blake's screenplay adapted from his own novel. 
''I'll never forget what hap­pened here tonight," an exul­tant Costner said as he held up the best picture trophy he shared with co-producer Jim Wilson. 
Costner also won an Oscar for his debut as director in charge of the big-budget spectacle with Sioux subtitles, which became a box-office and critical sensation after being laughed at by the industry. 
"I'd like to thank the academy -I've been waiting a long time to say that!" said a teary Bates, an upset winner who was a relative unknown in films despite a long stage career. Most observers had predicted that either Anjelica Huston or Joanne Woodward would walk off with the prize. 
"This is great!" Irons said. He thanked his wife, who is in England, saying "I wish you were there to carry this, be­cause you helped me win it." 
Whoopi Goldberg, the fake psychic who surprises herself by contacting the dead in "Ghost," and Joe Pesci, the maniacal mobster of "GoodFellas," won Oscars for supporting performances. 
"Ever since I was a little kid I wanted this," said an emotional Goldberg, who had struggled since receiving a best actress nomination for her screen de­but in the 1985 film "The Color Purple." 
"When I was a little kid, I lived in the projects. You are the people I watched. The peo­ple who made me want to be an actor," she told the star-packed crowd. 
She became only the second black woman to win an Oscar and the first since Hattie Mc­Daniel was honored for the 1939 film "Gone With the Wind." "Ghost" also won an Oscar for original screenplay. 
Pesci was much more sub­dued, saying "It's my privilege, thank you," and walking off. 
Comedian Billy Crystal emceed the show in style, starting off with a hilarious musical tribute to the five best picture nominees for the 63rd annual ceremonies, which took place at the Shrine Auditorium and was televised by ABC-TV. 

"Dick Tracy," Warren Beatty's big-budget detective adventure, won prizes for makeup and art direction and song. The best costume award went to the French period drama, "Cyrano de Bergerac," and the sound effects editing prize went to "The Hunt for Red October." 
The Oscar for best documen­tary feature went to "American Dream" and the documentary short subject award went to "Days ofWaiting." 
"Journey of Hope," a Swiss movie, won the award as best foreign film. 
Several special Academy nods were presented: the Irving G. Thalberg award to producers Richard Zanuck and David Brown, an honorary award to actress Myrna Loy and a special achievement Oscar to actress Sophia Loren. 
Loren was on hand to receive her award, but the 85-year-old Loy has been ill and had to ac­cept the honor via satellite from her apartment in Manhattan. 
Presentation of the best orig­inal song had a tragic overtone. 
Country singer Reba McEntire sang one nominated song, ''I'm Checkin' Out" from "Postcards From the Edge." She had with­drawn from the show after seven members of her band and her road manager were killed in a private plane crash on March 16. 
But the widow of her road manager, Jim Hammon, per­suaded the singer to perform as scheduled, reasoning, "Jim worked all these years to get you where you would sing on the Oscars."

Holy Week This week most of the Churches of the Christian Tradition celebrate Holy Week, the week commemorating the death and resurrection of Jesus. The week begins with a reading of the passion-the story leading up to the crucifixion -on Sunday, followed by a reenactment of the Lord's supper on Thursday-the meal at which Jesus instituted what has become the primary religious celebration of the Christian faith-the Eucharist. Probably the biggest difference between this Eucharistic celebration and those held on other days is the ceremony of the washing of feet -an act by which Jesus made clear that he had no intention of establishing a church built on hierarchical power but rather of establishing one based on service and humility. Lenten Penance Service Tuesday, March 26, 1991Friday is the celebration of the crucifixion and death of Jesus. Key to this celebration are the questions: "He saved others; why can't he save himself?" and "If He is 10:00pm Sacred Heart Church truly the Son of God, why can't he come down from the cross?" Opportunity for individual confession following the service.

Changing social attitudes create ethical dilemmas 
By PAUL WASINGER 
News Writer 
According to Jean Porter, professor of theology at Notre Dame, the recent dilemma over medical ethics can be attributed to current medical techniques combined with wide-spread changes In social attitudes. 
In a lecture titled "New Chal­
lenges for Morality Medical 
Ethics In the 90s," Porter 
blamed the more advanced 
medical techniques that have 
emerged In the past 20 years 
for pushing former ethical 
guidelines to their limits and 
forcing new developments in 
moral theory. 
"Until relatively recently medical ethics, such as it was, was extremely simple; so sim­ple that no one would have re­ally thought of teaching a whole course just on medical ethics much less, as is common today, going to a whole Ph.d program and specializing just in medical ethics," said Porter. 
However, the vast expansion of a physlcan's capacity to save life ushered in new moral ques­tions, she explained. 
"Increasingly, we found our­selves in a position of being technically able to save or at least prolong life, In the case of people who were very, very sick to begin with, and we begin to wonder whether we really want to do this," Porter said. 
Because of changes in social views, Porter said doctors are now faced not only with ques­tions of whether or not to care for critically ill patients but also with the question of who counts as u moral subject. 
"Even If we start out with what counts with a good or a harm, we then still have to ask to whom are we trying to do good and avoid harm." 
In addition to these changes, 
Porter also blames the ethical 
crisis on the growing financial 
crunch associated with medical 
care. "At the level of social 
structure a host of questions 
arise about who should pay for 
medical care, how it should be 
allocated, and how funds for 
research should be allocated," 
she said 

Porter believes that the 
greatest challenges to medical 
ethics today come not from the 
developments in medicine but 
in the developments of moral 
theory. 

She sees the current trend 
towards dealing with ethical is­
sues on a case orientated ap­
proach, "ethics based on reflec­
tion," as working well in homo­
geneous communities yet 
breaking down in not so homo­
geneous communities. 
For this reason, Porter be­
lieves that it is a mistake to do 
much with medical ethics as a 
discipline. "Medical ethics as a 
discipline should self-destruct, 
if it has not done so already." 
She instead said that because 
there are no easy solutions with 
respect to these difficult ethical 
decisions, doctors should move 
towards a greater cohesiveness 
in moral decision-making. 
"Make a point of including di­vergent voices. Voices from dif­ferent socioeconomic classes and different races," she ad­vised, "And try, at least, not to force consensus where consen­sus is not warranted." 
The lecture was sponsored by the Provost Office, University Academic Code of Honor Committee, and the Student Academic Council Committee in the ongoing series on Profes­sional Ethics.

Kremlin forbids public rallies 
MOSCOW (AP) -President 
Mikhail Gorbachev's Cabinet on 
Monday banned rallies in 
Moscow for the next three 
weeks, fearing that unhappi­
ness over price hikes and a no­
confidence vote on Gorbachev's 
chief rival could boil over in vio­
lence. 
Boris Yeltsin's position as chairman of the Russian Feder­ation parliament is to be tested at an extraordinary session of that parliament due to start Thursday. 
Several groups, led by the anti-Communist movement Democratic Russia, have scheduled a mass demonstra­tion to support Yeltsin on Thursday. Moscow City Council, controlled by pro-democracy forces, has already granted a permit. 
March 10 drew about 500,000 people to Moscow and tens of thousands more into streets in

Hard-line members of the 
Russian republic's parliament, 
which is known formally as the 
Congress of People's Deputies, 
called the session after -Yeltsin 
demanded that Gorbachev re­
sign in an appearance on na­
tional TV last month. 
Yeltsin's plea came as Cor­bachev was attempting to muster support for last week's national referendum to pre­serve the union. The two lead­ers each accused each other of fomenting civil war and trying to expand personal power with the referendum, which passed with nearly 77 percent of the vote.

An emergency Cabinet meeting approved a resolution banning all marches, demonstrations, picketing and rallies, the state news agency Tass said. 
Yeltsin's future is riding on the no-confidence vote. He crit­icized the March 17 referendum as "ambiguous" but welcomed Russian voters' approval of a second question that created a new Hussian presidency. 
Many commentators speculate that Yeltsin will run for the new presidency if he loses the no­confidence vote. His title now is chairman of the Russian par­liament, although most Soviets refer to him as president.

Hampshire professors dismissed 
AMHERST, Mass. (AP) -Two professors in this college town contend there is such a fervor at their school to mix social issues with curricula that they were booted out for not being "politically correct." 
Hampshire College adminis­trators say Jeff Wallen and Norman Holland were denied reappointment only because they were ineffective teachers. But the two professors pin their dismissal to criticism from colleagues that they took a "Eurocentric" approach to courses and weren't committed enough to Third World studies. 
"It came up in letters to my file. These accusations are in writing," said Holland, a Panamanian-born assistant professor of Hispanic literature. 
Hampshire, which began 20 

years ago as an experiment in 
alternative education, encour­
ages students to build a Third 
World aspect into their courses 
and degree plans under some­
thing called the Third World 
Expectation. 
''I'm totally in favor (of the 

Third World Expectation)," said 
Holland, who is fmishing up his 
fmal semester of teaching. "I've 
never been at all opposed, and 
strongly supported it, not only 
personally but in my courses." 
Wallen, who teaches compar­ative literature, said he was criticized for using the Jaco­bite-English conflict in a Walter Scott novel as an example of imperialistic conflict. Ballots cast against his contract re­newal contained written criti­cisms of his lack of Third World commitment, he said. 
"First of all, I teach European literature, and second of all, I don't teach European literature simply as a story of colonialism and imperialism. Some people want it to be as simple as that," said Wallen, currently on a year's sabbatical and living near Boston. 
Across town at the University of Massachusetts, a new ap­proach to basic writing came after a 1986 campus brawl he­tween black New York Mets fans and white Red Sox fans. 
The University of Mas­sachusetts writing program consists of two different classes, Basic Writing and Col­lege Writing. About 4,000 first­year students enroll in the _ courses each year, with five percent taking Basic Writing and the rest going directly to the more advanced course. 
Basic Writing students select two hooks from a list that in­cludes such diverse topics as 
"Brothers and Keepers," an account of the lives of two black brothers, and "The Parish and the Hill," a story of Irish immigrants in Mas­sachusetts. Other titles include "The Lost Language of Cranes," an account of three men coming to terms with their homosexuality, and "The Joy Luck Club," vignettes of four Chinese women and their American-horn daughters. 
In the second course, stu­dents write and discuss their work, and teachers can intro­duce notes of cultural diversity by bringing in such items as a flier about a campus seminar on racism or a newspaper ar­ticle.

Palm Springs spring break lacks traditional chaos 
PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) ­The first weekend of spring break in Palm Springs was rel­atively tame this year, with po­lice reporting a dramatic drop in arrests and none of the ma­jor disturbances of previous years. 
"It's been really quiet," Sergeant Ron Starrs said. "We did not get the crowds we ex­pected." 
About 80 people were ar­rested Friday afternoon through Sunday morning, mostly for public drunkenness and drunken driving, police said. Starrs said,the number of arrests was down 50 percent from last year. 
Students from all over the region pour in for the annual celebration, sometimes leading to rioting and deaths. 
In 1969, students rampaged during rock concerts. In 1986, 600 youths threw rocks and bottles through windows and tore clothing off women. 
Officials of this staid desert resort attributed the unusually docile crowds this year to in­creased security, co1d weather, new bans on nudity, and con­crete barriers along the main street to discourage cruising.

Tuition increase to ensure 'excellence' 
Special to The Observer 
The University of Notre Dame has announced a 1991-92 un­dergraduate tuition increase of 9 percent, or $1, 115, to a total of $13, 505. The rate of in­crease is lower than the aver­age 9.6 at the University over the last five years. 
In a letter to parents of re­turning undergraduates and 1991 freshmen, University President Father Edward Mal­loy, said the five-year budgeting plan of the University calls for the rate of increase to be re­duced further." He attributed the increase for 1991-92 to "an expensive word: excellence." 
The letter cited faculty salaries in the top 20 percent of the nation's universities, a five­year, $27-million campus com­puting improvement, and ex­pansion of the Arts and Letters College faculty. 
Notre Dame's trustees have also approved a hike of 6 per­cent, or $200, in the room and board fee, which will now aver­age $3,575. the overall cost of an undergraduate residential student will increase $1,315, or 
8.3 percent, to $17,080. 

Tuition for Notre Dame's Graduate School will go up $1,115 to $13,385. In the Law School, tuition will be up the same amount to $14,095 and the M.B.A. program will see a $1,420 increase to $14,095. 
In his letter, Malloy presented figures on current costs at comparable highly selective, private institutions of higher learning which show Notre Dame to be ranked extremely low-33rd among 35 colleges and universities-in combined tuition, room and board ex­penses.

Arab base to be established 
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP)­
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf 
says the United States is closer 
than ever to establtshing a 
permanent land base on Arab 
soil-a goal governments in the 
region had blocked for many 
years. 
The U.S. commander in the 
Persian Gulf War told reporters 
Sunday that the base would not 
include American ground 
forces. 
He also said that the Ameri­
can troops who remain in the 
gulf will go home after a per­
manent cease-fire is signed 
with Iraq. 
A report in a U.S. newspaper 
today said that American ar­
mored forces drove deeper into 
Iraq over the weekend, but the 
Pentagon said that was not 
true. 
In another development, Iraq's government newspaper, Al-Jumouriya, on Sunday de­nounced the cease-fire terms set by the allies as aimed "at usurping Iraq's sovereignty, mortgaging its will and holding Its wealth hostage." 
The U.S.-led coalition, which halted hostilities last month after driving Iraq from Kuwait, says it will not sign a perma­nent cease-fire accord unless Baghdad destroys its chemical, biological and nuclear arsenals and agrees never to resume production of the weapons, among other conditions. 
Prisoner releases, however, continued. A Red Cross official in Riyadh said 1,000 Iraqi pris­oners of war traveled to the Saudi border post of Arar on Sunday and were handed over to Iraqi ofncials. He spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Also Sunday, hundreds of 
Kuwaiti soldiers who spent 
months in Iraqi prisons re­
turned home to their war­
wrecked nation, where they 
were greeted by weeping rela­
tives and celebratory bursts of 
machine-gun fire. 
Since Kuwait was liberated on Feb. 27, some U.S. forces have begun helping the Kuwaitis rebuild their nation. Other American soldiers are occupying part of southern Iraq, where they are keeping an eye on Saddam Hussein's troops. 
Schwarzkopf said the soldiers are not expected to remain in Iraq after a permanent cease­fire. But a permanent truce has been complicated by the rebel­lions by Kurds in northern Iraq and Shiite Muslims in the coun­try's south. 
Schwarzkopf said U.S. logis­tics troops could be in the gulf as long as eight to 10 months to help load up equipment, but that the vast majority of sol­diers will be home before then. 
Nearly 100,000 of the 540,000 American troops sent to the gulf in Operation Desert Shield have departed, the Cen­tral Command says. 
The command, now based in Riyadh, plans to return soon to its headquarters in Tampa, Florida. But Schwarzkopf said Sunday, "There's a possibility we will be moving a forward headquarters element of Cen­tral Command-not the en­tirety ... someplace over here on the gulf." 
"But's there's an awful lot of negotiations that have to go on, the locations have to be ac­cepted and all the arrange­ments have to be made ... we're certainly much closer to that now than we've ever been be­fore." 
The Washington Post, mean­while, reported in today's edi­tions that U.S. Army troops have driven deeper into Iraq. It said heavy armored units drove 60 miles north to the Euphrates River valley over the weekend in a major repositioning appar­ently aimed at intimidating Saddam. 
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams denied the report, saying the movement was part of the repositioning of troops 
· that has been going on in recent days. 
As was reported last week, the Army's VII Corps is taking over territory that was captured by the XVIII Corps, elements of which are leaving Iraq to return to the United States. 
The New York Times, quoting 
U.S. 
and Bahraini officials, to­day reported that the United States was close to signing an agreement with Bahrain to base part of the command in the island nation off Saudi Arabia. 

U.S. 
ofncials had been indi­cating for months that Bahrain was the desired location for a base, and a senior Pentagon of­ficial today confirmed that talks were under way to allow some representatives of the Central Command to remain in that nation. The official would not say how large the contingent might be. "It's not finished yet. We're still talking," the ofncial said.

as a person. Many people drop out as they realize what is ex­pected a s a graduate student." 
Following Malloy, Castellino described the researching method of the science depart­ment at Notre Dame. This is done so by forming a hypothe­sis, testing that hypothesis, evaluating the results, and then forming a unified theory. He discussed the need to continue to learn through discussion, reading and interaction with others from specialized labora­tories. 
"Research, especially at the graduate level, requires vast amounts of resources; thus students must work with con­straints. Scientific methods are formally learned in lecture, lab and discussion. 
In the science department, the University does not give sole responsibility of undergraduate classes to graduate students, Castellino said. "We work on the unified university approach-undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty all working together," he said. 
Hatch spoke on the responsi­bilities of teaching and re­searching among the humani­ties and social science depart­ments, "There is no inherent reason teaching and research are related," he said. 
"Teaching students while still being a graduate student, helps the graduate student learn what the profession is about," he said. 
"In humanities and social sciences, the research is much more on the individual level," Hatch said, "Research depends basically on the individual stu­dent's doctrinal dissertation." 
This lecture was last of a five part series sponsored by the Graduate Student Union. 


PHOENIX (AP)-Doctors said Monday they have found a way to figure out the safest and most effective dose of chemotherapy to treat cancer -by measuring the body's re­sponse to the caffeine in a cup of coffee. 
So far, the new technique works for only one experimen­tal cancer medicine, but scien­tists are looking for similar tests that will help them tailor treatment more precisely. 
The goal is to allow physi­cians to give people enough cancer medicine to destroy their tumors without triggering life-threatening side effects. 
Mark Ratain of the University of Chicago described his find­ings with the coffee test at a meeting of the American Cancer Society. 
"The important thing is that a simple test has turned out to be predictive of how toxic a drug will be," commented Daniel Ihde, deputy director of the National Cancer Institute. 
In other presentations at the meeting, doctors described preliminary results with two new weapons against cancer. One combines a poison with a normal protein to target cancer cells. The other combines anti­bodies with radioactive iso­topes. 
The coffee test will allow doctors to pick the best dose of amonafide, a promising exper­imental medicine that is being studied for use against cancer of the breast, uterus and prostate. 
"We would like to maximize the dose to maximize re-

"I don't think it's (the posters) in the best judgement," Caito said. "It takes the campaign to a personal level, and it's not supposed to be mudslinging." 
Peralez said he believes his campaign is fair. "I've tried to run a clean campaign," he said, "But we are both pitted in a race that both of us want to 
win." 

"This is a campaign, and indiscretions will happen," Peralez said. 
Caito said that the campaign

sponse," said Ratain. "We know that the more chemotherapy we give, the better the chance of benefit. We are limited by toxicity." 
Currently, doctors pick doses of chemotherapy based on the patients' height and weight. However, there are great dif­ferences in how people respond to amonafide, as there are to many other drugs. A dose that causes no side effects for one person may kill another. 
"The average patient does not exist," he said. "Everybody is more sensitive or less sensi­tive." 
Amonafide is broken down in the body through a process known as acetylation. People who are fast acetylators pro­duce high levels of a substance called N-acetyl-amonafide, which is highly toxic. 
Therefore, people who are slow acetylators should receive higher doses, and those who are fast acetylators should get less. But until recently, there was no way to figure this out in advance. 
Caffeine, the chemical that gives coffee its kick, is acety­lated the same way as amon­afide. So by using urine analysis that measures how quickly people break down the caffeine in a cup of coffee or a can of caffeinated cola, doctors can estimate how their bodies will respond to the cancer drug. 
"It appears that when the drug is given properly, the re­sponse rate can be quite high," Ratain said. 
In testing on 18 cancer pa­tients, he found that 11 were

Allen said that he is pleased with his campaign. He said that he thinks that he has cov-ered the issues well and has the ex­perience in student government which his opponent lacks. 
"I don't think that this is an issue of race," said Allen. "I'm not playing these games." 
"I think it is a case of who can do the best job," he said. 
William McDonald, another candidate from district one, re­ceived 14.7 percent of the votes. He said that he hopes that his supporters will now vote for Peralez.

·rroops arrest president of Mali 
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP)­Soldiers in Mali have arrested 
. Gen. Moussa Traore following days of rioting and protests against the embattled president, sources in Mali's capital said early Tuesday. Idrissa Traore, president of the Mali Barristers' Association, said military sources in Bamako informed him of the president's detention. He did not describe the action as a "coup" but said the soldiers "have the situation under control." Idrissa Traore is no relation to the president. There was no official confirmation of the report in Bamako. Residents of the city cheered and set off firecrackers after hearing reports that Traore had been detained. There were also reports of looting and gunfire in the downtown area. Burning barricades and tracer bullets lit the night sky. 
"Everyone's in the street. No­body's sleeping. We're all so happy," said a woman who an­swered the telephone at the home of human rights leader and lawyer Demba Diallo. She would not give her name. 
A worker at Gabriel Toure Hospital in Bamako said three bodies and eight wounded people had been brought to the center early Tuesday. 
Thousands of workers in Mali went on strike Monday, and 45,000 people rallied in the capital to demand Traore's resignation. For the first time in four days, troops did not fire on anti-government protesters. 
·Opposition groups said Traore's troops had killed at least 148 civilians and wounded hundreds during daily pro­democracy protests that began on Friday. Traore says 27 were killed. Neither report could be independently confirmed. 
Juror discusses murder trial in public 
CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -The state said Monday it is investi­gating a complaint that a juror publicly discussed the trial of a high school instructor given a life term for manipulating her student-lover into killing her husband. 
The complaint was filed by Pamela Smart's mother, Linda Wojas, who said she received an anonymous call last week from a man who said he heard a juror illegally discussing the case in public. 
Mrs. Wojas said she testified at a closed hearing Thursday before Judge Douglas Gray, who presided over the three-week trial. 
Gray called in the juror "and he denied it or explained it away or whatever," said Mrs. Wojas' daughter, Beth. "The judge apparently decided it was not enough to do anything more about it." 
Assistant Attorney General Paul Maggiotto would not say if the juror was being investigated 
There has been unrest In the West African nation of nearly 8 million people since January. 
Traore had agreed to free po­litical prisoners, lift a state of emergency and curfew and make other concessions after meeting with opposition leaders on Sunday night. But he has said he would not resign. 
Diallo said the strike called by the National Union of Malian Workers brought the city to a standstill and pressure would continue until Traore resigned. 
"Our movement is irreversible and cannot go back," he said. 
Traore seized power in a mili­tary coup in 1968, eight years after the country gained inde­pendence from France. He in­stalled himself as civilian presi­dent of a one-party state in 1979, and he was the sole presidential candidate in 1985 elections. 
further, only that Mrs. Wojas' complaint was. 
Smart, 23, was convicted Fri­day of being an accomplice to first-degree murder, murder conspiracy and witness-tamper­ing. Gray sentenced her imme­diately to the mandatory term of life in prison on the first charge. 
Prosecutors said she per­suaded her teen-age lover, William Flynn, and two friends at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton to kill her husband.

"We've had a number of peo­ple who have been wavering over there for a long time," Volker said. 
But Graber said the override is less likely in the Assembly this year with three former death penalty supporters gone. 
New York's electric chair has not been used since 1963. Court decisions overturned the state's death penalty and repeated ve­toes by former Governor Hugh Carey and by Cuomo blocked efforts to approve a new one. 
ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -The state Senate approved legisla­tion Monday to restore the death penalty in New jork, although a supporter said its chances of becoming law were slim. 
The Senate passed the bill 40­18 after nearly three hours of debate. The bill is expected to easily pass in the state Assem­bly, where it will come up for a vote in the next few weeks. 
Governor Mario Cuomo said he will veto the death penalty, as he has done in each of his eight years in office. 
"Nobody in a position to make a deal goes to the chair," Cuomo 
said. "Poor people go to the chair and nuts who want to go to the chair." 
The fate of the death penalty after Cuomo's veto was not certain. 
''I'm not optimistic," Assem­blyman Vincent Graber, a Democrat and chief death penalty sponsor, said of chances that the Assembly will override the veto. 
Senate sponsor Senator Dale Volker, a Republican, said, "I think we've got a shot at it."

Faculty member answers criticism from colleague 
In his recent letter to The 
Observer (March 6) my col­
league, Prof. Hochberg-Halton 
escalates his broadside against 
what he calls fascism and once 
again he targets me as some­
how engaging in its 
"apologetics." While I certainly 
respect his right to his opinion I 
regret that I am unable to 
follow this exchange any fur­
ther in the direction he has 
chosen to take it. Not only does 
he so coarsely misreport re­
marks made at the teach-in of 
late January which appear to 
have first incited this volley but, 
in addition, his mode of argu­
mentation too widely misrepre­
sents the facts as well as my 
stated views to allow for me to 
continue a discussion in this fo­
rum. 
Clearly, Prof. Hochberg­Halton is determined to duke it out, rhetorically of course, with some purported enemies of democracy. But I simply do not recognize myself at all as the interlocutor to whom he refers. In fact, in reading his last letter, will all due respect, I almost have the sense that I have slipped into the epistolary ver­sion of a Calvin and Hobbes cartoon except that the accusa­tions he I eve Is are so ou tra­geous and barbed. Furthermore, not only do these qualitative factors make a re­sponse prohibitive, but quanti­tative concerns enter as well. 
The sheer volume of the muddle that he offers in support of his convictions would require an entire special issue of the The Observer to sort out the particulars properly. 
To insist, for instance, as he does, upon reducing the highly variegated and changing land­scape of contemporary Middle Eastern societies to a gross polarity of fascism versus democracy strikes me as ulti­mately unhelpful. One might as well simplify the shifting intri­cacies of the Thirty Years War to a view either of degenerate Papist against heroic Heformers, or loyal Catholics against treacherous heretics, depending, naturally, on con­trasting prejudices. Unfortunately the contempo­rary Middle East especially in the face of the present catas­trophic crisis in the Gulf War requires considerably more at­tentive perception and far more refined analytic tools that these relatively Euro-centric labels. Without the calibrated use of more sophisticated distinctions there is little hope of under­standing the current struggles of the many peoples in the re­gion to achieve for themselves and their neighbors something of an indigenous free, just, equitable, secure, prosperous and modern civil order. 
But even as I must resign my­self to the impossibility of car­rying on this debate, perhaps I can briefly illustrate the char­acter of the difficulties just de­scribed. Given the constraints of space, I will limit myself to a few comments on the charges that Prof. Hochberg-Halton raises merely in the first para­graph of his expansive letter. Here, he insists, initially,_ that I inaccurately alluded to Dr. Ghada Talhami's position as an "emphatic condemnation" of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait because, he says, she denied that Scud attacks on Israel are terrorist acts. Unfortunately, he does not elab­orate on the logic of that unites these two issues and makes them in some unspecified way irreconcilable. 
Nevertheless, with regard to this question, her view, articu­lated quite clearly, merely started with forthright con­demnation of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait. It then proceeded to condemn other instances of illegal occu­pation by other states in the re­gion, notably, the Israeli occu­pation of Arab territories seized at the end of the Six Day War. Her argument was quite plain. If UN Hesolution 660 (demanding theat Iraq remove its forces from Kuwait) has led to the instant mobilization of an international effort to liberate one occupied country why then has UN Hesolution 242 (requiring Israel to withdraw from territories to overran in 
June, 1967) been treated for two and a half decades as little more than a topic for debate without any significant en­forcement of its protocols with respect to another occupied country, namely that of the Palestinians? 
Dr. Talhami's view of how the Scud attacks on Israel are best described emerged, as I under­stood it, from an analysis of the complex history of tragic and reciprocal violence resulting largely from the failure of those responsible to provide a framework for a just resolution to the original problem that followed upon the UN's decision to partition Palestine in 194 7. Prof. Rochberg-1-Ialton should take up this matter with her di­rectly if he wishes to pursue it further. However, since he sweeps me too into his broad dragnet of allegations, let me modestly venture a streamlined response in the terms of inter­national law which poses this question of classification as a double set of alternatives. 
One might say, on the one hand, that with the exception of Egypt, the 1948 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors has never formally ended. 
Patrick D. Gaffney 
Guest Columnist 
Hence, technically, a state of belligerence coRtinues even though it has remained largely latent. It was exactly on these grounds that Israel sought to justify its bombing of the nu­clear reactor in Osirik near Baghdad in June of 1981. If one accepts the premises of Israel's own argument then by the same principle the recent Scud attacks by Iraq may also be rec­ognized as yet another phase of this long war, even granting that such assaults were utterly futile by any military estimation and like all violence, especially against innocents, they were totally abhorrent in human terms. On the other hand, if Iraq's Scud attacks on Israel are terrorist acts then Israel's earlier bombing of Iraq is no less so. 
Turning to what he asserts are the disqualifying liabilities in my own emphatic condemna­tion of Saddam Hussein's viola­tions of basic rights both inside and outside his country, Prof. Hochberg-Halton advances two charges. First he faults me for failing to respond, point by point, to the catalogue of what he claimed to have heard from Dr. Talhami at the teach-in. True, I did not structure my let­ter (The Observer, Feb. 25) in this way, firstly, for purely practical reasons. To respond to his telegraphic and often distorted restatAmAnts of her views would have required an­other teach-in or more. Instead, I judged it wise to economize by satisfying this need by means of a blanket rebuttal in order to 
concentrate on the one explicit misunderstanding that he cited in specific reference to me. 
But secondly, there was an important principle at stake in my decision. I hold that free­dom of expression is an abso­lutely essential feature of a uni­versity community, not to men­tion a cornerstone of democ­racy. I defend Prof. Hochberg­Halton's right to state his views with the same vigor that I de­fend Dr. Ghada Talhami's free­dom to state hers. I do not take it to be my task to lash out with lurid condemnations in every setting where views may be ex­pressed with which I may not agree. Furthermore, I do not find it conducive to the clarifi­cation of delicate tangled issues to pillory as a fascist a very distinguished guest scholar with an impressive interna­tional reputation in such fields as civil rights, ecumenism and constructive dialogue between Jewish Israelis and Palestinians. 
But Prof. Rochberg-1-Ialton's second reason for rejecting as incomplete my condemnation of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait is still more aston­ishing. It is because, he insists, I "ignore...the obdurate fact that Yassir Arafat's Fatah fac­tion of the PLO was launching missiles toward Israel..." Once again no explanation on the link between these two issues is provided. And yet here, more than ever, my sympathy stirs for the parents of Calvin with their sadly limited adult capaci­ties to recognize the lovable Hobbes that their gifted son calls into life by the sheer force of his imagination. 
The incidents that Prof. 
Rochberg-Halton Is apparently 
referring to occurred on 
January 29th and 30th, a full 
week after the aforementioned 
teach-in was held in the Library 
Auditorium. How is it, then, 
that my colleague takes me to 
task for omitting discussion of 
an event that had not happened 
yet, and since I lack clairvoy­
ance, how could I be expected 
to know that it would occur? 
Besides, this sort of eventuality 
was not relevant to the social 
and political history of the Gulf 
region which constituted the 
subject of my presentation. 
Nevertheless, the fact that he attaches such importance to associating issues touching on Kuwait with issues touching on Palestine while adamantly denying any relationship be­tween the two continues to baffie me. Neither, I should add, does this incident come up
anywhere in Prof. Hochberg­Halton's first letter to The Observer (Feb. 14) to provide me with some cue from which I might have guessed that he was awaiting my pronouncement on this or any other subject. 
Moreover, and far more im­portantly, Prof. Hochberg­Halton's clear implication that I do not find the shooting of these Katyusha rockets objectionable (none of which landed in Israel, incidentally, nor did those that landed in Lebanon cause any casualties) is also sheer fantasy. In fact, I most certainly do condemn them and do so utterly, just as I also condemn Israel's continuing occupation of the Lebanese territory where they landed. And between these two issues, I do perceive a connection. In fact, these launchings marked the first violation of this sort since the PLO formally renounced terrorism over two years ago. 
Very sadly, these rockets also reflected the extremely height-· ened tensions that are now testing by fire that admirable landmark decision reached by democratic means. As such, they also betokened the down­ward spiral toward bitterness and desperation among many Palestinians who feel doubly betrayed, by Saddam Hussein's ruthlessness as evidenced In the murder of Abu Iyad, and because after having, at last, themselves officially recognized Israel, they find that Israel's government adamantly refuses to do likewise while Instead it continues to tighten the grip of its iron fist. 
But Prof. Rochberg-Halton's 
small anachronistic error along 
with his Implied misattribution 
of my views are not the worst of 
it. What he leaves out of his 
summary judgment is still an­
other key piece of information 
which flatly contradicts the very 
"obdurate fact" upon which he 
rests his case. In his eagerness 
to accuse me of "one­
sidedness" he omits, for some 
reason, the absolutely essential 
issue of responsibility. Note the 
following sentences which 
appear, not in some obscure 
scholarly footnote nor in what 
he calls the "propaganda put 
forth by Baghdad" but in the 
one source that Prof. Hochberg­
Halton shows he is familiar 
with since he cites it elsewhere 
in his letter. They report a 
crucial detail that quietly pulls 
the rug out from under his 
curiously backdoor case for 
"linkage." 
In the January 30 issue of New York Times on page A8, one reads: "The PLO late Tuesday issued a statement from its headquarters in Tunis denying that Mr. Arafat had is­SHAd ordArs to his estimated 
6,000 guerrillas entrenched in southern Lebanon to open a front against Israel in solidarity with lraq... Beirut newspapers reported today that Mr. Arafat sent a message to his most senior representative in southern Lebanon, Zaid Wehbeh, reprimanding him for making warlike pronounce­ments." 
I end this overlong exchange with a note of thanks once again to Prof. Hochberg-Halton especially in light of his gener­ous conciliatory remarks at the close of his letter. Not only do I agree with him that there is ample reason to fear that our country is heading for terrible times, but I add my confidence in the power of truth and jus­tice and mercy to his resistance to the "cult of the gun." And with regard to the Middle East our primary task, I feel, must be to attend with most special solicitude to victims of brute violence, oppression, and yes, even of "fascism," wherever they lodge whether in Kuwait, or Tel Aviv, Sabra-Sbatilla, Riyadh or Basra.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Co-ed dorms may not solve problem of poor male-female relations 
Dear Editor: 
Coed dorms, through their lack of existence on this cam­pus, seem to have become glamorized and overrated. I transferred to Notre Dame from a university in California where I lived in a coed dorm. Living on the same floor with the opposite sex did not produce the earthshattering experience that Ms. Eaton (The Observer, March 20) seems to anticipate. I suspect that Ms. Eaton and many others who share her views suffer from a grass-is­greener delusion. 
Coed dorms do not automati­cally induce a "healthy and normal environment" between the sexes any more than sitting at the same table in the dining hall does. On my former cam­pus, male-female tensions are as much or more prevalent then here at Notre Dame, an indication that gender related problems do not automatically evaporate or even diminish sig­nificantly because of cohabita­tion. "Normal healthy friend­ships" stem from individual at­titudes and personality traits, not housing arrangements. 
Campuses with only coed housing do possess a different type of environment than that which presently exists at Notre Dame. But one will find that students residing in this differ­ent atmosphere still experience sexual harassment, tensions and insecurities about relating to the opposite sex. Any change that coed housing may foster would be temporary and wear off with the novelty. Idealistic, spontaneous bonding between the sexes merely due to housing arrangements is not a realistic expectation. Instead, trivial changes, such as acquiring a lowered inhibition about mem­bers of the opposite sex remov­ing one's underwear from shared washing machines, re­sult. 
Notre Dame is a unique uni­versity in many ways; being dif­ferent need not necessarily be negative. It is true that few campuses have dorms similar to Notre Dame's. Those other dorms, however, consequently .Jack the individual character and the closeness that result from single-sex dorms in which students continue to reside for most or all of their college years. Also unlike Notre Dame, other campuses have fraternity and sorority organizations in compensation. I urge students to carefully and more realisti­cally evaluate the pros and cons of coed dorms instead of auto­matically blaming poor rela­tions upon university housing.

Tho run was old hat for the Runnln' Rebels. Just ask Georgetown and regular-season opponents Arkansas, Florida State, Michigan State and Princeton. 
UNLV has made a habit this season of starting second half action several minutes before they let their opponents into the game. The key, says coach Jerry Tarkanlan, is knowing which player to motivate. 
~You have to try to push the right button when the time comes," Tark the Shark said. "Each kid Is motivated differ­ently." 
The Rebels (34-0) have used these emotional lifts to move within two games of becoming the first team since UCLA in 1973 to capture consecutive NCAA championships and the first since Indiana in 1976 to do It without losing a game. 
When the Rebels pour it on to open a second half, It's usually because Tarkanlan preaches defense during his halftime talk. 
~when our defense picks up, 
we begin creating a lot of 
turnovers and that's what al­
lows us to make those scoring 
runs," Tarkanian said. 
Against Seton Hall, the Rebels led 39-36 at the half, then ran 
off  14  straight points  and  
coasted to a 77-65.  
Seton  Hall  coach  P.J.  
Carlesimo was impressed.  

~As soon as we slipped a bit, they lived up to Tark's nick­name," he said. "They go for the jugular pretty good." 
Even Tark marveled at his team's ability to turn it on. 
"It was something to see," Tarkanian said. ~, can't wait to go home and watch the tape." 
There are a few tapes Tark would enjoy: 
-In the second round of the tournament, the Rebels used a 15-4 run against Georgetown on their way to a 62-54 victory. 
-In their showdown with then No. 2 Arkansas on Feb. 11, the Rebels trailed 50-46 at halftime, then opened the sec­ond half with a 10-0 run and outscored Arkansas 29-11 in the first seven minutes to win 112-105. 
-At Michigan State, the Rebels broke a 56-56 tie with a 16-6 run and won 95-75. 
-Against Florida State, the Rebels used an 11-0 run in the first half to break open a tight game, then added a 21-2 run in the second half to win 101-69. 
And, there was a 22-3 run against Princeton, a 19-3 spurt against Utah State, a 20-2 run against Rutgers and a 16-2 streak against Louisville. 
The Rebels have used the sprees to toy with opponents all season, with most of the scoring surges coming at the start of the second half. ' 
~It all depends on what's hap­pened the first half," Tarkanian said. "We don't generally get mad or upset with them at halftime. We just go over what's working and what's not, just make some defensive adjustments that need to be made. 
"This year's club is just so good that we haven't had to make a lot of adjustments at halftime." 
An exception was Thursday's game against Utah, when a fuming Tarkanian switched from man-to-man to an amoeba defense during a halftime session that wasn't pretty. 
~one of the few times I really got upset was the Utah game," Tarkanian said. The Rebels de­feated the Utes 83-66 to ad­vance to Saturday's regional fi­nal against Seton Hall. 
Tarkanian gave his players a rare two days off following the Seton Hall victory, with work­outs scheduled at home Tuesday and Wednesday before the team leaves for Indianapolis. 
Rich, Buffalo still in the hunt for expansion team 
BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) ­Buffalo's chance to ol"tain a National League team has not been hurt by the prospective owner's concern over the cost of a franchise, the chairman of the league's expansion commit­tee said Monday. 
Douglas Danforth, owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates, said Robert E. Rich Jr.'s recent statements have been echoed throughout baseball. 
"It's not just the Riches who were saying that," Danforth said after he and three other members of the committee vis­ited the city, one of six finalists for an expansion team in 1993. 
~There are a lot of people that are concerned because salaries have jumped about 35 percent between 1990 and 1991," Danforth said. "Heretofore, it was 8, 9, 10, 12 percent (annually)." 
Rich, president of the coun­try's largest privately-held frozen food company and owner of the Class AAA Buffalo Bisons, said in December he had questions about the finan­cial viability of a major league expansion here, considering the steep rise in player salaries. 
The expansion committee, which made visits to three Florida cities earlier this year, visited Washington and Buffalo on Monday. A visit to Denver is scheduled for Tuesday, and Danforth said the committee will name the two new National League cities by the middle of the summer. 
Danforth said he sees two positives -solid ownership and a stadium -and two nega­tives -market size and avail­able parking -impacting on Buffalo's chance to get an ex­pansion franchise, which will cost $95 million. 
~The thing that impresses me the most ... is the Riches know what they're doing," he said. "They run a very good club, probably the best-run triple-A franchise that I know of. 
~They know what they're do­ing in concessions and they know what they're doing in providing entertainment for the family. They're real baseball people." 
Added Philadelphia Phillies owner Bill Giles, another committee member, "Certainly they're the kind of people that you want to have as partners in major league baseball." 
Giles added that he was ~very, very impressed" with Pilot Field, the city's 20,000-seat downtown baseball stadium that opened in 1988.

Boggs: 'Back tire narrowly missed running over my head' 
WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) ­Dazed and hurting while stretched out on the ground, Wade BQggs looked up at his wife and asked, "Am I still alive?" 
The Boston Red Sox' five-time American League batting champion told Monday of his "pretty dramatic experience" Saturday night when he fell out of moving pickup truck driven by his wife, Debbie. 
"I'm just glad to be alive," Boggs said. "The back tire nar­rowly missed running over my head." 
Boggs, whose mother and grandmother were killed in a traffic accident in 1986, escaped with minor injuries treated first by his wife and then by Red Sox trainer Charlie Moss on Sunday. 
While the team traveled to Sarasota for a game with the Chicago White Sox Monday, Boggs remained at Chain O'Lakes Park. He walked gin­gerly, but got in some batting practice. 
"You'd never know he was hurting, he could hit in his

victory. 
Senior captain Kim Pacella said, "I think we were a little bit down over spring break, especially after we lost to Northwestern. It was important for us to come out and make a strong showing this weekend, especially against Michigan and Ohio State, which are regional matches that we lost last year. This was an important weekend for our confidence." 
The Irish indeed made a strong showing, downing Michigan 7-2 on Saturday. Tracy Barton defeated Christine Schmeidel, ranked 52nd nationally , 6-3, 6-4 as the Irish won five of six singles matches, four of which went the full three sets. Barton/Christy Faustmann and Ann Bradshawffholen chalked up very close straight-set wins at first and second doubles, 6-4, 6-4, and 7-6, 6-4, respectively. 
Said Irish coach Jay Louderback, "Against Michigan, we just played great. We won four tight singles sleep," batting practice pitcher Bill Maloney said after Boggs lined shots all over the outfield. 
Boggs said he and his wife had dinner at a nearby restaurant and when they left to go home, they took a left onto U.S. 17 South. 
"We hadn't gone far when the next thing I knew I was bounc­ing around on 17," he said. "I don't know what happened. Everything happened so fast. I don't know whether I leaned on the door or I kicked it somehow with my leg. But it opened and boom." 
Boggs said that he didn't know whether he had failed to close the door completely, but he blamed himself for not using the seat belt. 
"Ever since the death of my mother, I haven't got into a car without buckling the seat belt," he said. "For some unknown reason, I didn't Saturday night." 
Boggs said that his wife was driving "about 25 miles an hour, something like that" when he suddenly was thrown out. 
"The rear tire just missed running over my head and I 
matches, and our kids played really hard. The match was pretty heated, and it looks like we have a big rivalry starting. Everyone pulled together, and that strong play carried over to Ohio State." 
The Irish methodically dis­mantled the Buckeyes in a 9-0 romp. Tracy Barton did not play singles, and Harris and Faustmann led the way with 6­0, 6-1 and 6-2, 6-4 wins at first and second singles. Notre Dame did not drop a single set in either singles or doubles in the rout, one of the team's most dominating performances of the year. 
"Our kids did not want to lose to Michigan and Ohio State," said Louderback. "We

lost to them both last year, so we wanted to get back at both of them. 
After exacting revenge on their regional opponents, the Irish took on Boston College on Monday. Due to time con­straints, only five singles and one doubles match were played, with the doubles counting for two points. 
Notre Dame quickly took the doubles match, with Bradshawffholen romping to a 6-0, 6-0 shutout. The singles matches proved to be much tougher for the Irish, who eventually pulled out a 5-2 win, though it was closer than the score indicates. 
Tracy Barton dropped a 6-4, 6-1 match to Pam Piorkowski at

· third. Harris again came from behind to win a thrilling match, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 at second singles. Terri Vitale and Kim Pacella also posted singles wins for Notre Dame. 
Riding a four-match win streak, the Irish will host Michigan State on Thursday at 4 p.m. in their final home match of the season. 
Louderback said, "Michigan State has not been real strong in the past. They've been at the bottom of the Big Ten for the last couple years, and they are not any stronger this year. They shouldn't be as tough as the teams we played this weekend." 
The Irish will be playing the remainder of the season with­out Katie Clark, an important contributor at both singles and doubles, who is suffering from back problems. The depth of the team will be tested, as four of the final five matches are against ranked or near-ranked teams, in matches which will likely decide the post-season fate of the Irish. 
Pacella recollected upon the team's progression during her four years, saying, "It's really amazing how the team has come along. I'm amazed I'm still playing. The team has changed so much lately. Jay has turned this program completely around."

Duke, NC familiar to Final Four 
DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -They told Mike Krzyzewski not to worry about winning when he got to Duke 11 years ago. 
Right. Just eight miles away was North Carolina and coach Dean Smith, models of consis­tency for nearly 30 years and all Krzyzewski had to do was keep the Blue Devils program afloat. 
"The athletic director just mentioned that we want to be competitive and we want good kids, to be educated, and repro­sent Duke," Krzyzewski said Monday. "Don't worry about winning. Maybe I was naive enough to believe that, and I'm still naive enough to believe that." 
Innocence aside, Krzyzewski came to Duke trying to smooth the hills and valleys which had marked the basketball program since the glory days of Vic Bubas. Now, it's Duke that's been to four straight national semifinals and five in the last six years, and North ~olina that's going for the first time in nine years. 
Yet, Krzyzewski won't mock the Tar Heel program. He won't compare his achievements with theirs, but he does say the improvement in Durham has benefitted both sides. 
"When you're competing against really good people, you get better," Krzyzewski said. "I think it's helped me greatly. I think it helps Dean maintain his hunger, the fact that we're good." 
There was a time when Duke was in a basketball famine, however. But not once, Krzyzewski said, did he hear from school officials trying to speed up the winning to keep up with the neighbors from Chapel Hill. In his 25 meetings with Smith, Krzyzewski is 8-17. 
''I've never considered it any pressure, with North Carolina there, or when N.C. State was doing it," Krzyzewski said. "Maybe that's the best thing because then we're able to de­velop our own program instead of trying to copy somebody else." 
When Bubas left in 1969, North Carolina had just finished the third of its three-year run in Final Fours. The Tar Heels lost the 1968 title game to UCLA and lost two consolation games. 
Duke had been to the Final Four in 1966 after winning the ACC championship. The Blue Devils lost to Kentucky in the national semifinals, but earned third place with a victory over Utah in the consolation game. 
Duke struggled with medi­ocrity after Bubas stepped down. North Carolina made two more trips to the Final Four in the 1970s and won four more ACC titles under Smith.

continued from page 20 ranked Mark Jeffrys, 6-4, 7-5. DILucia played with a back that had been troubling him since he suffered back spasms against UCLA on March 15.

(ourr.ol 6-7, 6-4, 6-2 and sophomore Andy Zurcher lost to Per Nilsson 7-6, 6-4. The only doubles score 
recorded and needed was Zurcher and Forsyth's 2-6, 6-3, 6-1 win over Mississippi State's Jefferys and Nilsson. 
On Saturday, the Irish faced 11th-ranked South Carolina and swept all six matches. DiLucia defeated Johan Sunberg, a second semester freshman from Sweden, 6-3, 7­
5. Troubles continued for DiLucia as he went down on the court with more back spasms. He was able to continue the match, but was hospitalized later. 
Forsyth played his best match of the year defeating 17th-ranked David Hopper 6-1, 6-4. Coleman bested P.T. Langone 6-3, 6-1. Schmidt beat Andres Theuron 6-1, 2-6, 6-4. Zurcher defeated Oak Hahn Heisen 7-6, 4-6, 6-0 and Rosas defeated Manh Palos 6-3, 6-1. 
On Sunday, the Irish fell to ninth ranked Arizona State 5-l. DiLucia posted the only Irish win and his 19th straight in a gutsy match with Brian Gyetko. Once again, his back was both­ering him, but DiLucia stuck it out and won a tough three-set­ter, 6-4. 6-7, 6-1. 
-My back wa:; :;tiff whh;h concerned me, but I just tried to focus on getting my first serves in," said DiLucia about his back problems. 
DiLucia's performance gave him a clean sweep at the Blue-Gray and earned him Most Valuable Player honors. He is the first non-senior to earn the honor. 
"His play was nothing short of phenomenal," said Bayliss. "I'm really happy David was named MVP." 
However, the rest of the Irish were not as fortunate. Rosas had his best match of the year leading 5-2 in the second set only to lose 4-6, 7-5, 7-5 to Ross Matheson. Schmidt pulled a hamstring against South Carolina and was helpless against Joel Finnegan in a 6-3, 6-2 loss. Forsyth lost a two­and-a-half hour contest to Tom Lominsky, 7-5, 6-4. 
"Will played extremely well," said Bayliss. "He gave it his all." 
Zurcher fought hard but was overmatched by Bob Gamibo who beat him 6-1, 6-4. Coleman also lost 7-5, 6-2 to Dan Marting. 
DiLucia praised the play of the team. 
"I think the team rebounded well from the lost to UCLA with the South Carolina victory," said DiLucia. "No one expected it." 
Bayliss was also pleased with his team's performance. 
"The Blue-Gray is without a doubt one of the best and toughest tournaments in the country. There were some very good teams that came out of it 0-3 so I'm really pleased that we tied Texas Christian for third place," said Bayliss.

continued from page 20 bled to left for the first hit off Linn. Ginnie Hartman sacri­ficed, and Erica Greiner came through with an RBI single. Valparaiso had a golden op­portunity to break the tie in the seventh. Ingram again led off with a double, and again Hartman sacrificed. However, McMurray tried to get Ingram at third and was unsuccessful. With runners at the corners 
and nobody out, Greiner grounded the ball to Kmak, who made a perfect throw to catcher Amy Folsom to nail Ingram at the plate. Given a reprieve, Linn proceeded to wriggle out of the jam with a pop-out and weak grounder. 
"It was a great play," Boulac said. "Ruth had to go into the hole a little bit to make the play. It was a tough throw to make in that situation, and we were very fortunate to execute the way we were supposed to. That's what won the ball game

First, though, Notre Dame had to survive another Valparaiso scoring threat in the eighth when Michele Gregor tripled with one out. But Linn once again pitched out of trou­ble, getting Carla Reiter and Krista Bane to pop out. 
The Irish finally won it in the ninth when Crossen hit a lead­off single and was replaced by Alvarez. Pinch-hitter Kathy Vernetti laid down the sacrifice, but Crusader second baseman Stacy Witfill dropped the throw at first. 
After Folsom grounded to third, coach Boulac called for the suicide squeeze, and daughter Debbie executed to perfection, bringing home Alvarez with the winning run. 
"We have (the suicide play), but we don't do it often," he said. "But when you have the baserunners and one of your better bunters up, that's what you have to come with. 
"We're starting to play as a team. We did some things tonight when we were strug­gling in the second game where we pulled together and kept our intensity, and that's only going to help us as the season progresses." · 
Next up for Notre Dame is a doubleheader at Ball State (7­

Senior Kim Becker and freshman Michele McCorkle each hit .340 to lead Ball State in hitting-McCorkle also leads the Cardinals in stolen bases with nine. Junior Karen Oliver (4-5, 3.22 ERA) is the ace of the Cardinal staff.

Murphy optimistic despite weekend losses to UVA Walania leads Irish pitching in single win 
By DAVE DIETEMAN 

Sports Editor 
Despite losing two of three games to the Virginia Cavaliers over the weekend, coach Pat Murphy's Notre Dame baseball team has climbed in some polls. 

"The team actually rose in the Murphy ranking," related Murphy. "I feel like we played under a lot of adversity. I don't want to build excuses, because the trip was a good experience. We grew as a team and went through some hard times. 
"We had a 15 hour bus ride to get there and a 13 hour ride home. That makes things tough. We've also had some tough times academically lately, but we've still had very positive performances. At best, these things happen when everyone does not play up to their poten­tial. There were lots of positives for us. I refuse to worry about the national picture until we are together as a team." 
Skiles scores 31 in Magic win; Nets lose 16th straight on road 
ORLANDO, Fla. (AP)-Scott Skiles scored 13 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter and the Orlando Magic used a 21­
Sophomore pitcher Alan Walania was the eye of the storm which rained on Notre Dame's weekend, as he pitched a complete game shutout in the first game of the Sunday double header. Walania, 4-2, fanned six while walking none and giv­ing up five hits. 
The Irish offense provided another bright spot, exploding for a 12-run, 12-hit attack. Frank Jacobs went two-for­three with two runs scored and three RBI in addition to knock­ing his seventh home run of the season. Mike Rooney drove in two runs while going a perfect three-for-three at the plate. Joe Binkiewicz also "dialed eight" for the first time this season, as Notre Dame scored in five of the seven innings. 
"Virginia is not a bad club," said Murphy, careful to give credit where it was due. "They aren't as good as we are, but we happened to lose two out of three. We could very easily have won two of three. Give some credit to Virginia. They played very well." 
Yet the wily coach was also careful to give blame where due. 
"We played under very ad­verse conditions," stated Murphy. "It was wet, rainy and the field was very different-it was half astroturf. Those are not excuses, but just the same, we had to make adjustments. 
"At this level, where we are playing all of these top teams-and Virginia also beat Georgia, the defending national champions, last week-anybody can beat anybody on any given day. I am very pleased with the way the team has responded to some challenges. We have more challenges ahead in Purdue and the Oscar-Mayer Tournament, which we are honored to have been invited to." 
Challenges aside, Murphy is­sued what is, effectively, a warning to the rest of the col­legiate baseball world: "Don't worry about us, we'll be back."

Tanya Williams named All-American in swimming 
Irish swimmer places 8th in the NCAA 400 individual medley; sets new University record 
By BECKY WOOD 
Sports Writer 
Sophomore sensation Tanya Williams made a major Irish inroad on the national swim­ming scene at the NCAA Women's Swimming and Diving Championships. Williams be­came Notre Dame's first All­American swimmer this week­end in Indianapolis. 
Since Notre Dame nabbed Williams in 1989 she has made Irish history. Last year, Williams, a nationally-ranked recruit, was the first Irish swimmer to qualify for the NCAA's. Now she has added to her accolades by earning her frrst All-American title. 
Williams placed eighth in the 400 individual medley in a uni­versity record setting time, 
4:19.88. Irish coach Tim Welsh felt Williams' performance achieved two significant ac­complishments. 
"For Tanya, I think getting to the big fmal with the big girls is the first of several. It's the be­ginning of her claiming as a collegiate swimmer. She needs to take the 400 individual med­ley, remember it and build on it and go from there," said Welsh. "For the program, last year she qualified (for NCAA's) and opened up the door for qualify­ing. This year she qualified in faster times and opened the door for All-Americans at Notre Dame. 

"Now we can talk to the best athletes with evidence that our team has progressed to the point where we qualify for the meet and score and become All­Americans," added Welsh. 
William's scored 11 points to rank the Irish 30th out of 159 Division I schools that sponsor swimming. Notre Dame tied with Princeton and Indiana in a field where only 158 individual swimmers qualified for the NCAA's nationwide. 
Last year's champion, the Texas Longhorns, captured frrst (746 points) ahead of Stanford (653 points), Florida (353) and California-Berkeley (27 5). Since women's athletics joined the NCAA in 1982, only three schools have won the national

The Notre Dame's men's tennis team had a very successful weekend in Montgomery, Alabama. The team tied for third place with Texas Christian in the prestigious Blue-Gray Invitational and junior Dave DiLucia was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player. 
On the first day of play, the Irish defeated Mississippi State 5-2. Sparking the Irish victory was sophomore Mark Schmidt's three hour come from behind win. Schmidt lost the first set 4-6 to Christope Damiens and was down in the second set when he turned things around. His 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 victory gave Notre Dame a 4-2 edge in the 5 point match going into doubles play. 
Irish coach Bob Bayliss was impressed with Schmidt's play. "He showed what he's always shown-his ability to play error free tennis at crunch time," said Bayliss.

Strong pitching leads Irish softball to sweep of Valparaiso 

Women take four important matches at Eck Pavilion 
By RICH SZABO 
Sports Writer 
Playing to redeem themselves after a disappointing spring break trip, the Notre Dame women's tennis team swept a four-match long weekend at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
Using power and speed, the Irish defeated Oklahoma and Michigan, overwhelmed Ohio State, and finally shook off the challenge of a stubborn Boston College team to raise their record to 13-6. 
On Friday, the Irish squeaked past Oklahoma 5-4 in a very tight match. Regular top-singles player Tracy Barton was rested, so Melissa Harris moved up to the number-one slot. Continuing her strong play, Harris won a thrilling 5-7, 7-5, 6-1 match over Stacey Bullman, ranked 53rd in the country, after being down 5-7, 1-5. 
Lisa Tholen, Kim Pacella, and Kristy Doran all posted singles wins for the Irish. Following losses at first and second doubles, Notre Dame clinched the

For the third time in four days, the Notre Dame softball team swept a doubleheader from an unsuspecting visitor. 
Monday afternoon, the victim was Valparaiso (9-11). The Irish (11-12) pounded out 11 hits in the opener in an 8-0 victory. In the nightcap, they staved off two excellent Crusader scoring chances in the scvonth and eighth innings before squeezing out a 2-1 win in the bottom of the ninth. 
In the rrrst game, sophomore Staci Alford faced two batters over the minimum in pitching a two-hit shutout. The Baton Rouge, La. native struck out 10 batters, walk-ed none and was behind in the count to only three hitters. 
"I love this warm weather; it makes it so much easier to throw," Alford said. "I felt good out there, and I had great defense behind me that really helped me out." 

Alford dropped her earned run average to 1.63 in raising her record to 4-2. Her steady improvement from some early­season difficulties-she has won three straight outings, giving up only two runs in 21 innings-is a good omen for the Irish. 
"Staci's been throwing very well since we've come back from our spring trip," said Notre Dame coach Brian Boulac. ·"All she needed was to get a little confidence in herself. She's really tough, and we needed her to come back and give us solid pitching." 
The Irish broke onto the scoreboard in the third inning. Back-to-hack triples by Carrie Miller and Ruth Kmak, com­bined with a wild pitch, gave Notre Dame a 2-0 lead. It pushed three more runs across in both the fourth and fifth in­nings to break the game wide open. 
The second game was a pitcher's duel between Valparaiso's Erin Reiter (4-7) and Notre Dame's Missy Linn (5-7). 
The Irish pushed a run across in the third. Casey McMurray led off with a single. Lisa Miller sacrificed, and Carrie Miller was hit by a pitch. One out later, Kmak reached base on an error by Reiter. The error proved costly when Reiter walked Rachel Crossen on four pitches to force in pinch-runner Amy Rueter. 
The Crusaders tied the score in the fifth. Karen Ingram dou­
