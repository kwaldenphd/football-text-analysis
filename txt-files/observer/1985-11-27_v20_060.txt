Mubarak defends commando raid on airliner; claims Libya's support of hijackers 'very clear' 
CAIRO, Egypt · President Hosni Mubarak's government launched a vigorous campaign yesterday to defend Its commando raid on a hijacked Egyptair jet in which 58 people died, despite little public criticism here. 
Mubarak accused Ubya of spon· sorlng the gunmen who seized the plane and told reporters he sent the soldiers to Malta to storm the jet· liner only after the pilot reported: 'they're going to kill us all." 
Mubarak blamed the deaths on the hijackers, who he said were the

The fire grenades set the Interior ofthe Boeing 737 ablaze. 
In Malta, government spokesman Paul Mifsud said the death toll in the hijacking and commando raid was 
59. He said one passenger was shot to death by the hijackers and the ot· her 58 people died during the com· mando operation. 
Hijackers took over Flight MS648 Saturday evening on a flight from At· hens, Greece, to Cairo and forced It to land on the Mediterranean island of Malta. They Jet 11 women go and shot three American passengers and two Israelis, killing one of the Americans, and threw them from the plane. 
Maltese authorities said that 27 survivors of the commando raid were hospitalized, including the man alleged to have led the hijack team. The pilot, Hani Gala!, returned to Cairo. 
They had said earller that the total death toll was 60. But Mifsud said yesterday it had been lowered to 59 because a Canadian baby was counted twice In the earlier total. 
The only public criticism of the raid in Egypt came from two opposi· tion politicians, who demanded par· liamentary inquiries Into how the deaths occurred. 
Asenior army officer, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said that he and colleagues with whom he had spoken were "shocked at the num· ber ofpeople killed." 
But such comment was atypical. An Egyptian diplomat said the com· mando raid had made Mubarak "more stable politically than Ire was last week" because it Improved his standing with the military, which he said is the key to political stability In

One man's "dream come true" came to an end yesterday morning. 
After months ofspeculation about his status, Notre Dame football coach Gerry Faust announced his resignation at his regularly scheduled weekly press conference. 
Showing little emotion save his reddened eyes, Faust stunned the group of reporters by1 calmly ap· pcoaching the microphone and tel· ling them of his decision to resign, effective immediately after Satur· day's game with Miami. 
"I called (University President) Father (Theodore) Hesburgh this morning in Baltimore, Md., and told him of my decision to reslgn,"-Faust said. "I'm a fighter till the end. It was tough for me to do this. But I think It's for the best · for me and for Notre Dame. You don't quit. You just change direction for the good of both. 
"I felt this would be the best time because it gives them the oppor· tunity to get another coach before recruiting starts next week. I don't want to hold them off by waiting un· til next week. I also wanted the pressure offthe players." 
Speculation already has begun about who Faust's successor might be. Athletic Director Gene Corrigan and Father Edmund joyce, ex· ecutlve vice president of the Univer· sity and chairman of the faculty board in control of athletics, met yesterday afternoon on the matter. 
Last night, Corrigan said that a replacement could be named as soon as today. 
"Recruiting is always critical and

persuasions. 
State-owned newspapers called the attack "necessary," "courageous" aqd a lesson In "how to deter terrorism and terrorists." 
Mubarak said the hijackers had closed off negotiations, not even al· lowing nine children off the plane, when the pilot radioed the control tower to "please do something. They're going to kill us all ... You have to storm the plane or we will all die." 
Egypt sent 80 commandos, and 
Malta gave permission for the attack. 
Although Mubarak said Ubya's "connection (to the hijacking) Is very clear," he would not Indicate what action Egypt would take. On Sunday, he reinforced Egypt's forces on the Ubyan border and declared a state ofalert there. 
Ubya denied Involvement In the hijacking. Its official news agency, JANA, described the raid as "stupid and clumsy." 
recruiting does start on Monday," he said. "We will have a replacement as soon as possible, and certainly no later than next Monday. We won't dilly-dally around with it." 
Much of the speculation last night centered around Minnesota head coach Lou Holtz, but Corrigan refused to disclose who Is beingcon· sidered as a possible replacement. 
Minnesota was 6-5 this season un· der Holtz and wilt play Clemson In the Independence Bowl on Dec. 21 in Shreveport, La. 
Holtz has compiled a 116-M-5 mark in 16 seasons at the college level, spending time at William & Mary, North Carolina State, Arkansas and Minnesota. Holtz, whose son Skip Is a Notre Dame student, also served a one-year stint as coach of the NFL's New York jets In 1976. 
Faust's career record at Notre Dame stands at 30· 2 5·1, with this year's team holding a 5·5 mark. His 25 losses rank as the most of any coach in the school's history. 
Reactions, page 8 
The target of much criticism for his failure to win consistently, Faust decided to resign on Monday night after discussing the situation with his family. He informed his wife Mar· lene, daughter Julie and son Steve In person of his plan to resign, and called both his son Gerry III, who Is away at school, and his parents to let them know. 
He said he tried to reach Hes· burgh that night In Ba}tlmore, bu\ was unsuccessful. Faust did manage to contact the University president yesterday morning, and tendered his resignation at that time. 
Faust followed up his conversa· tion with Hesburgh by visitingjoyce to inform him of the decision. He communicated the decision to Cor· rlgan and then, moments before the press conference was to begin, called his assistant coaches together to inform them. 
He had not yet Informed the team of his decision. Word had spread to the players by the time oflast night's practice, and Faust said that "some neat things" happened at the workout, which was closed to the press. 
After his announcement, Faust had nothing but praise for Hesburgh and joyce, saying how grateful he was that they had stuck with him for the duration of his five-year con, tract. 
"I can't thank enough Father Hcs­burgh and Fatherjoyce, who arc just unbelievable people, and the Uni·

Eliminating parietals would prove University has faith in its students 
"First they tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place. Then they tellyouyou can'tsleep with somebody else. I mean, sooner or lateryou sleep in your own place. Either way it's okay, you wake up with yourself" 
-"My Life," Billy Joel. 
The second most popular rumor on the Notre Dame campus, after "Gil Thorpe will be the new head football coach," is that the open grassy space between the Pasquerillas and the Memorial Ubrary is going to be the location of two new dorms -and they are going to be coed. 
Of course, if the University were to allow coed dorms, wouldn't that make parietals obsolete? 
That's right, it would. 

It's time the University took a long, hard look at parie­tals to see if they are still worthwhile. When Notre Dame considers the context in which parietals now exist, if it looks at what real purpose they serve in the Notre Dame community today, and if it considers the maturity and responsibility of incoming students the University wiil find that parietals are obsolete. 
The attitude upon which the parietals regulation is based is decidedly Victorian. The rationale behind the regulation assume students are not mature enough to make decisions affecting their own lives. The major argument for parietals states they attempt to remove the possibility of personal ir­responsibility by eliminating the near occasion of an irresponsible decision. A person is less likely to decide to spend the night with someone ifthey know they will get thrown out ofthe University if they are caught. 
While parietals might have seemed like a good idea in the past, to regulate visiting hours between people of the opposite sex based upon fear of dismissal today seems inappropriate and narrow-minded. 
Many students here agree with the administration 
that parietals are a good idea and that the University 
should be allowed to regulate where its students spend 
the night. But what about students who disagree? What 
about students who believe administrators have no 
right to make such moral decisions for students, thus 
impeding their personal freedom and growth as in­
dividuals. 

One popular response is that those who disagree can 
choose to go elsewhere. 

This "love it or leave it" attitude is inappropriate to the Christian beliefofthe school and to the progressive

nature of the intellectual environment. Simply because students are citizens ofthe Notre Dame community and agree to abide by the rules of the University does not necessarily mean students have to like the rules or ac­cept them unquestioningly. 
To accept any rule without question or examiniation is to deny personal growth. To question authority promotes moral, spiritual and intellectual develop­
ment. To reject those who question authority is to reject progress. 
What would be the im­plications of the elimination of parietals? First, it would show that the University has trust in the decisions of \ts students. It would be a vote of confidence in the ability of the adults that learn, live and grow under the golden dome to make decisions that are right for them~elves. 
Second. fc:w sciwols have parietals a i\ .wrc. Nearly every state schoo. and many private colleges and univer­sities in the United States at least offer the opportunity for students to live in coed 
housing. Students are allowed to make their own deci­sions. They are trusted to lead their own lives. 
Finally, eliminating parietals would promote better and more realistic communication and understanding between men and women here. Co-habitation would offer a healthier environment for relationships to deve"'p. Currently, a kind ofinhibiting influence exists between the sexes. 
The school supports the Catholic Church's teaching that a sexual relationship should only exist within the context of love, responsibility and commitment -and only in the context of marriage. 
Generally, I think students here agree with this. Eliminating parietals wouldn't necessarily mean stu­dents suddenly would become sexually active. To believe this implies students are somehow hedonistic, and this is just not true. 
Students at Notre Dame are mature individuals capable of making decisions rationally-and responsibly. Eliminating parietals would prove that University ad­ministrators have faith in its students, and would enable students to truly grow within the context of a mature community.

VATICAN CITY -U.S. and Scan­dinavian prelates proposed at an ex­traordinary synod yesterday that local bishops and their national or­ganizations share with the pope responsibility for running the Roman Catholic Church. 
Bishops from the Third World, addressing issues of their own region, called for increased church support of clerics working for the poor and oppressed. 
The proposals came in speeches on the second day of a two-week synod assessing the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, also known as Vatican II. 
Vatican II, held in four sessions between 1962 and 1965, made reforms in Catholic liturgy, ecumenism, seminary education, religious life and church govern­ment. 
Pope John Paul II sat through all 21 speeches yesterday, taking notes and reading texts, said the Rev. Diar­muid Martin, the synod spokesman. 
Bishop James Malone of Youngstown, Ohio, president of the 
U.S. Bishops Conference, said he believes there are "good grounds" in the Vatican II reforms to justify "some extension of collegiality to the direction ofbishops." 
In church parlance, collegiality refers to the collaborative relation­ship between the pope and bishops in Christian teaching and in govern­ing the church. 
The issue of shared responsibility between the pope and bishops is considered a major one before the synod of 165 bishops from around the world. 
Bishop John Gran of Oslo, Nor­way, representing the Scandinavian Bishops Conference, went further. He asserted that the Vatican II goals on collegiality "hardly have been realized according to expectations." 
"If anything, a tendency is felt toward the return to the idea of diocesan bishops as representatives of Rome rather than administrators in their own right," he said. 

Study says drinking age ineffective 
creased after the legal drinking age was raised, the study found. 
The researchers examined traffic fatalities in an eight-year period In some of the 29 states that have raised the drinking age for at least hard liquor since 1978. 
The federal government in 1984 required states to adopt a minimum drinking age of 21 for all alcoholic beverages by 1987 or lose 5 percent of their federal highway funds. 
"The government is well­intentioned, but it doesn't have a proven solution, so It experiments," said DeSario. "The expectation Is not reasonable, as far as we're con­cerned." 
DeSario and Bolotin calculated the percentage of traffic deaths that were related to alcohol, then compared that percentage among 18 to 20-year·olds before the drink· ing age was increased to the percentage after the new law took effect. 
Figures for the test period also were compared with figures in states that did not increase the drinking age. 
Of the states studied, only Texas and New York showed a desired decrease in the percentage of alcohol-related traffic deaths, the researchers said. Those states, however, also passed tougher drunken driving laws. 
Some other states showed no sig­nificant improvement, and eight states · Florida, Georgia, Massac· husetts, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Tennessee and West Vir­ginia -had Increases in the percentage of traffic deaths related to alcohol after raising the drinking age.

Notre Dame heads to season finale with Hurricanes at Orange Bowl 

By DENNIS CORRIGAN 
Sports Writer 
Lost in all the hoopla surrounding the resignation of Notre Dame head coach Gerry Faust was this Satur­day's opponent, the Miami Hur­ricanes. The Hurricanes come into the game with a 9-1 record and a berth in the Sugar Bowl. 
In addition, the Hurricanes are ranked fourth in the AP poll behind Penn State, Iowa and Oklahoma, a team Miami beat 27-14 earlier this season. Second-year Miami head coach Jimmy johnson smiles at his team's poll position. 
"A lot of people say there should be a playoff and settle this on the field," johnson said, "but then vote (Oklahoma) ahead of Miami. We beat them in Norman, yet we're ranked behind them. It puts a smile on my face." 
Neither can Faust understand Miami's ranking. 
"They're ranked second in the UPI (poll), and that's where they belong," he said. "Ifyou beat a team, and I don't care how early in the season it was, and have less losses or the same amount of losses, you belong ahead ofthem. 
"I think it's neat," Faust noted of Saturday's game. "We've played No. 1(Penn State), No. 5 (Michigan) and now we play No. 2. I don't know how anyone can say they played a harder schedule." 
Miami began this season as an un­known quantity. It had lost the big· play combination of quarterback Bernie Kosar to Eddie Brown and returned only four seniors. After losing their opener to intrastate rival Florida, 35-23, the Hurricanes are 9­0, thanks in large part to junior quar­terback Vinny Testaverde. 
Continuing the tradition of former Miami quarterbacks Jim Kelly and Kosar, Testaverde has developed into one of the nation's finest signal callers. Heading into Saturday's game, the Heisman and all-America candidate has passed for 2,882 yards, completed 194-of-320 attempts (a .606 percentage) and thrown for 19 touchdowns and I 5 interceptions. Needless to say, 
Johnson is more than pleased with the progress Testaverde has made. 
"He's worked very hard," said Johnson of Testaverde. "He has talent, good speed and a strong arm. He also has the confidence that he can be the number-one quarterback for a top team. He reads defenses well and executes very well. I'd have to say he's one of the better quarter­backs in the country." 
While Johnson does not like to compare Testaverde to his predecessors, others have. 
"Forget about Kosar," said Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden after Miami beat the Seminoles 35­
27. "Kosar never hurt us like that guy (Testaverde) did." 
Just as Testaverde replaced Kosar, freshman flanker Michael Irvin is on his way toward making Miami fans forget about Brown. Irvin has caught 41 passes for 773 yards (an average of 18.9 yards per catch) and eight touchdowns going into this weekend's game. 
junior tight end Willie Smith leads the team in receptions with 42 for 589 yards and a touchdown, while sophomore split end Brian Blades has caught 29 for 640 yards and 6 scores. 
As the Irish found out last year, the Hurricanes are more than capable of moving the ball on the ground. Junior fullback Alonzo Highsmith, who rushed for two scores and caught two others in last year's 31­13 victory over the Irish, has rushed for 420 'yards and five touchdowns this year. Backfield mate Warren Williams has rambled for 479 yards and into the end zone three times. 
Miami's offensive line is 
composed entirely of juniors and its 
average height and weight is 6-4, 
266 pounds. The line is allowing 3.1 
sacks a game, so a strong Irish pass 
rush is essential toward a defeat of 
Miami. 
The Miami offensive machine has 
been racking up an average of 454.2 
yards per game. The 'Canes also are 
averaging 34.2 points per game and 
an average victory margin of just 
over 19 points. 
The Hurricanes start only one senior and two juniors on their defensive unit. Their secondary is composed of three sophomores and a freshman. So far, though, this young crew has performed well. It has allowed an average of 289.2 yards ( 106.9 rushing, 182.3 passing) and 14.3 points per game. Freshman cornerback Don Ellis leads the team in interceptions with four of the Hurricanes' 18 total. 

"It's one more chance to get our respectability back," said Faust of the game. "I know our kids will play hard. We've got a great group ofkids. I want them to win itfor themselves because they deserve it, especially the seniors." 

Students 
continued from page 8 
There were some, however, that 
would have liked to see Faust stay 
on, despite the losses. 
"I would have liked the University 
to keep Gerry," said sophomore 
Andy Grimm. "You can't tell if the 
new coach is going to go 10-l next 
year. He might go 1-l0. And Gerry's 
such a great person that I would like 
to see him coach even with his 
losses. 
"If! had a choice between Gerry's 
.500 record and someone who wins 
by cheating like Charley ( Pell, 
former Florida coach), I'd pick 
Gerry Faust." 
Another student concurred. 
"Ifhe was going to resign, I think it 
would have been best to wait until 
the whole season was over," said 
junior jose Vithayathil. 
"But I didn't even want him to 
resign. I'm a big Faust fan. He was my 
number-one choice to be coach 
next year. He represented everyth­
ing Notre Dame stands for, except 
for winning enough football games 
according to Notre Dame standards. 
"And I don't think this should take 
precedence over what kind of per· 
son he is. Because of this, I thought 
he should be asked back. I would 
have liked to see him coach here for 
as long as he wanted." 
Gerry Faust failed at Notre Dame 
as far as his win-loss record is con· 
cerned. But he succeeded tremen­
dously as far as his character, 
personality and integrity are con­
cerned. It just seems too bad the

thought about that (telling the team) a little bit, anll I wasp't t"vcn going to talk to them," Faust said. "I was just going to go about practice and everything and just go about getting ready for Miami. I don't"think there's any need for a team meeting. They know how I feel about them. I hope they feel good about me. 
"I don't think there's any need to say anything to the team. They'll find out today. We're just going to go out and get ready (for Miami). I have no intention of saying anything to the team. I'm sure they understand." 
While most of the players said they did understand Faust's method of handling the situation, some said they were disappointed they were not informed earlier. 
"The players weren't informed, but I guess we figured it was coming from the way things were going," said Larkin, who heard the an· nouncement on the radio. "I was a little disappointed. I was surprised that he didn't tell the team. I ex· pected him to tell us before everyone else." 
Junior tight end Tom Rehder, who heard ofFaust's decision through his hall janitor, agreed with Larkin. 
"I could see why he decided to an· nounce it this morning before tel· ling the team," said Rehder. "If you told the team you'd get 100 different stories. It was up to him, although I kind ofwish it could have been done simultaneously · where the players found out at the same time as the writers. But he did it the way he chose to do it, and I can't blame him for that." 
Francisco said he was especially disappointed because he and Faust are so close. 
come into a place like Notre Dame that's expected to win and if it doesn't start out right, then you've got a lot of problems. If we would have gotten started out right · shoot, we might still be sailing. 
"But we didn't, and for whatever reason · God's will, my mistakes or what· I don't think it has anything to do with the level of coaching. I've seen pro coaches go into college coaching that have not succeeded, and vice versa.'' 
Exactly five years and two days after the beginning, the end came. 
Yet, the Irish coach remained the same upbeat person he has been from day one. 
"I love this place and I love what it stands for," said Faust. "I would have liked to have won more than we did. If you're going to put the blame somewhere, you've got to put it on the coach, and that's where it should be. 
"I think there's winning in other ways, though, like in developing young people. But the bottom line is that you've got to win on the field." 
Indeed, even at Notre Dame, a "Diversity of the highest ideals, win· fling is the bottom line. 
"When they first found out, a lot of the guys on the team were saying to me 'H, you must have known about this before,' but I didn't," Francsico said. "I was kind of upset that he didn't tell us (the players) first be· cause we're supposed to be a close family. I heard quite a few guys on the team say they were disappointed about that." 
Most of the players tried to keep Faust's resignation in perspective, especially considering this Satur· day's game at fourth-ranked Miami. 
"I don't know ifCoach Faust's an­nouncement will have any effect on the team this Saturday," said Pinkett. "I just want to focus on the Miami game. I want to win that game and go out a winner. It's his (Faust's) last hurrah and ours as well. I just want to go out on a good note." 
"I think a 'win one for Gerry' situa­tion is possible," said Beuerlein, "but we've got some kids, especially seniors, who want to win for them· selves also. We've got pride. We'd like to end this season on a winning note." 
Several of the younger players expressed concern about playing for a new coach next season. 
"Next year will be tough," said 
sophomore  quarterback  Terry  
Andrysiak.  "We'll have  to learn  a  
new system."  

"It'll be an adjustment next year with a new coach because Coach Faust has his ways," said freshman wideout Mark Green. "It'll be tough adjusting to a new system. It'll be like starting all over again with a new coach so it will make a difference. We know Coach Faust so we knew what to expect. We won't know anything about a new coach or his system.'' 

Butler visits Saturday 
By ERIC SCHEUERMANN 
Assistant Sports Editor 

The Butler Bulldogs invade the ACC on Saturday for the first time since the 1976·77 season to face the Notre Dame basketball team, which is coming off a less-than-impressive performance against St. Joseph's (Ind.). 
The Irish will remember last year's game against the Bulldogs, a surprise 70-69 overtime loss in In· dianapolis. 
"I would expect that our players remember how poorly we played against Butler last year,'' said Notre Dame head coach Digger Phelps. "It was a homecoming for Barlow and Hicks and for Price, too, since he's .from Mar~on, but none of them played very well that night. 
"It'll be up to us to do the things 
we didn't do last year when the op­
portunities presented themselves.'' 
Phelps will again start Tim 
Kempton at center, Ken Barlow and 
Donald Royal at the forward posi­
tions and David Rivers and Scott 
Hicks in the backcourt. 

Rivers scored 20 points against St. Joseph's, while Barlo"" also looked impressive, scoring 14 points and collecting 13 rebounds. 
Sophomore Gary Voce. who scored 10 points and had eight rebounds against the Pumas. andJim Dolan will be the first players off the bench for the Irish up front. 
Senior Joseph Price and freshman Mark Stevenson will likely see a lot of time at the guard position, espe· dally if the Irish can shake the pesky Bulldogs early. 
Butler, coming off an 87·72 win over DePauw on Monday, returns its top three scorers from last season. a season in which the Bulldogs finished I 9·1 0 including an NIT loss to Indiana. 
These top returnees for Head Coach Joe Sexson are 6-6 junior for­ward Chad Tucker ( 19.8 points last year, 5.9 rebounds), 5·9 junior guard Darrin Fitzgerald ( I 5.7 pts. ). and 6-4 junior forward Tony Gal· lahar(9.3, 4.8). 
Other likely starters are Mike Yeater, a 6-8. 210-lb. junior transfer from Indiana Central. and freshman Darren Fowlkes, a 6-5 shooting guard. 
In the upset of the Irish last year, Tucker scored I ; points, Gallahar 14 and Fitzgerald 12. 
"Butler's got three of its people back who caused us problems down there," said Phelps, "so they'll cer· tainly come up here with the idea that they can play with us." 
The Irish will try to raise their record to 2·0 by making it a point to show the Bulldogli that thingli are different this year.

happen, so they could have made some form ofannouncement." 
Pinkett agreed with Haywood that Faust had been mishandled by the media. 
"I was disappointed with the way the press handled the whole situa· tion," said Pinkett. "I think there was a lack ofsensitivity expressed by the kinds ofquestions they asked. I don't want to name names, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. 
"Another thing that left a bad taste in my mouth is the entire season be· cause the focus was always onCoach Faust and his destiny and not on how well the team was doing."

curred, and also admired Faust's handling of the announcement. 
"It was a tough situationfor Gerry, an emotional situation," noted Heis· ler. "You had to feel sorry for him. You could see in his eyes it wasn't easy. You have to admire any man who says thingli aren't working be· cause it isn't easy for anybody to say that." 
Perhaps, however, Faust saw the writing on the wall. After posting a 30·2 5-I record during five years, many people expected Faust to be relieved of his coaching duties after this week's game. Still, the expecta· lion of Faust's dismissal did not prepare his associates enough for the actual end ofhis tenure. 
"We all thought it might come," said assistant SID Eddie White. "Now 
Several players expressed regret at Faust's decision and said that they would be sorry to see him go. 
"I'm kind ofsurprised," said junior tailback Hiawatha Francisco. "But I'm also kind oftorn apart inside. I've got mixed emotions. Coach Faust and I are really close and I hate to see him go. 
"I felt sorry for him being under all that pressure. He never got a break. Maybe thingli work them­selves out eventually, but whatever happens I hope that thingli go well for Coach Faust." 
Faust annouced his resignation at his weekly 11 a.m. press conference. He said then he had made the decison to resign the night before and that he had not considered in· forming the team ofhis plans first. 
that it's here, it's. sadder than what we might have expected. It's like when somebody dies. This is the sad· dest I have ever felt." 
That melancholy feeling per· meated the ACC, but especially into the football office where secretaries sat stunned with their red-rimmed eyes filling with occasional tears. 
"He's a great guy," said football receptionist Mary Carmola. "I could never say anything bad about him. I was sad when I heard he was resign· ing, but I knew it was coming. I just didn't want it to come." 
Unfortunately for Faust, it has come to an end. Still, Faust's per· sonal secretary, Jan Blazi, may have offered the most glowing compli· ment of the day to Faust. 
"He's an extraordinary kind of person," said Blazi, who showed the rigors of one of the longest days of her career. "I feel fortunate that I had the opportunity to work with him and become a friend."

Reactions to resignation announcement mixed 
Players admit surprise at both timing and decision not to inform them first 
By LARRY BURKE 
AssistantSports Editor 

Gerry Faust's announcement yesterday morning of his resignation as Head Football Coach did not take his players by complete surprise. But while the players said they could see such an announcement coming, most were caught off guard by the timing and by Faust's choice to inform the media first, rather than his players. 
"I'm kind of surprised it happened at this time," said junior quarterback Steve Beuer­lein. "Obviously we knew something was going to happen soon. We just didn't know which way." 
"It's kind of shocking," said junior free safety Steve Lawrence. "I just thought he would wait until after the season." 
That opinion also was expressed by senior linebacker and co-captain Mike Larkin, as well as by junior linebacker Mike Kovaleski. 
"I thought Coach Faust would have waited until the end ofthe season," said Larkin. "But I guess the reason that he did it now was to take some ofthe pressure offthe team." 
"I'm very surprised he made the decision this week," said Kovaleski, "but I can see why he did it. He did it for the well-being of the team, the University and next year. It was his personal decision and we have to honor that." 
Senior linebacker Tony Furjanic and senior tailback Allen Pinkett, both co-captains, agreed that such an announcement from Faust seemed inevitable. 
"It wasn't a real shock," said Furjanic. "Because ofour record eight now and his con­tract situation, you knew something was going to happen, but it didn't look good the last few weeks. It was kind of frustrating waiting for official word. The general con­sensus was that it would be bad." 
"Everybody on the team knew something was going to happen," said Pinkett, "because it was the end of his contract. We just didn't know when or in what form. I feel a sense of relieffor Coach Faust because hopefully now everyone will leave him alone." 
Senior cornerback Mike Haywood agreed that the announcement was inevitable, but he thought it should have come sooner. 
"Everyone knew for a while that something was going to happen," said Haywood. "So I don't know why they (the administration) procrastinated. The media were acting like vultures, and I'm just glad the commotion is over. 
"The way they (the administrators) were leaving things up in the air caused a lot ofcom­otion, confusion and turmoil. There was a lot of time spent thinking about the coaching situation instead offootball. There was a lot of tension -both concerning the coaches and in the locker room. 
"They (the administration) should have gotten it out of the way a long time ago. I'm sure they knew that something was going to

Student opinion on Faust's decision varies 
By ERIC SCHEUERMANN 
AssistantSports Editor 

There has been a great deal of complaining about Head Coach Gerry Faust during his five years here,. He lost so many football games that many people urged him to leave the job so that Notre Dame could find a more qualified replacement. 
But now he has resigned his job so that the University will have plenty of time to find a new coach, and it seems that students are reacting with mixed emotions. 
"I like to see Notre Dame win as much as everybody else," said senior Bill Ryder, "and I don't think: I could sup­port him being coach any longer. Excellence is demanded of everyone here, and he has not shown himself to be a good college football coach over his years here. 
"On the other hand, he's been an example that we all should follow. It's a shame we've been so cruel to someone who's such a good person just because he doesn't win foot­ballgames. 
"As a senior," continued Ryder, "it has been a long four years. I had hoped to go to some major bowls with the band. It has been different than I.expected, but that doesn't. necessarily mean it has been bad." 
Students were on the whole glad to see him resign, but couldn't help wondering if people had been too hard on him. 
''I'm glad to see a new coach come in," said junior Rob Schaerfl, "but I wasn't exactly eager to see him resign. I greet this with mixed emotions. 
"I thought he deserved the chance to see what he could do for five years, and he got that. He didn't do the job so I guess we should have a new coach. It's just too bad." 
Some students admired Faust's principles. 
"I think it demonstrates a lot of integrity on his part," said juniorjeffChiesa. "He's giving up a job that has meant more to him than anything, and as always he's putting the school's interests ahead ofhis own desires." 
There were some more decisive views, however. 
"He's a nice guy, but he can't coach," said freshman Jim Mason. "And I think it was a good time to resign, since it will help our recruiting out. 
"He had some hope before the Penn State and LSU losses, but I think it's good the players know it will be his last game­at Miami so they can give a good effort."

Response at ACC resembles eulogy 
By CHUCK FREEBY 
Sports Writer 

The Athletic and Convocation Center had the atmo­sphere ofa funeral yesterday so it was only proper that the comments made about Head Football Coach Gerry Faust's resignation resembled eulogies. 
Faust, a man shadowed by criticism throughout much of his five years and two days as Irish football coach, was the recipient of a number of tributes from staff and administrators following his surprise an· nouncement at his weekly press conference. 
University President Father Theodore Hesburgh ac­cepted Faust's resignation with "genuine regret" while attending a conference on nuclear disarmament in Bal· timore. Hesburgh's acceptance letter never mentioned football, conc~ntrating instead on Faust's personal qualities. 
"During your five-year tenure here, you have cer· tainly earned the respect and affection ofvast segments of the Notre Dame Family," said the letter. "You have given example to the nation how a major athletic program can be run with integrity. You have, above all, been a caring member of this community. Your never­failing smile and remarkable acts of kindness toward those in need have endeared you to us all." 
Executive Vice President and Chairman of the Faculty Board in Control of Athletics Father Edmund Joyce echoed Hesburgh's sentiments in a prepared statement later in the day. 
"I have nothing but admiration and respect for Gerry Faust," said Joyce. "It is almost as disappointing to me as it is to him that success eluded him on the gridiron at Notre Dame. Our prayers and best wishes go with him." 
While Hesburgh andJoyce were the first to be served notice of Faust's resignation, others found out either only moments before the press conference or after­wards. One ofthose who learned about it just before the public announcement was Athletic Director Gene Cor­rigan, who obviously was surprised by the move. 
"All of us are in shock even though the ultimate en­ding of the thing is not surprising," said Corrigan. "It still came as a surprise when it happened." 
While Corrigan was busy trying to begin the process of hiring a new coach, he still had time to offer some kind words about Faust. 
"He's an incredible man," remarked Corrigan. "He brought new meaning to the word enthusiasm and to optimism. Gerry wanted every day to be a great day for his players, his coaches and the fans. He never gave anything but his best." 
That was evident at both press conferences yesterday as Faust answered the questions ofthe media with grace and dignity. It may have been Faust's best performance before the media, a group which certainly had caused him some difficulties during his Notre Dame career. 
"I thought he handled the announcement and fielded the questions with a great amount of class and poise," commented Sports Information Director Roger Val­diserri. "You had to be impressed with his demeanor throughout the whole thing. It had to be a difficult time for him." 
Valdiserri's associate, John Heisler, was seated in his usual spot next to Faust when the announcement oc­see ADMIN, page 6
