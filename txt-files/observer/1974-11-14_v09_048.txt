Longcoal strike no threat to ND 
by Paul Young Staff Reporter 

Despite the repercussions of Tuesday's coal miner strike, the Notre Dame power plant has enough coal stockpiled to heat the campus for almost four months, if it is a mild winter. disclosed William Ganser, chief engineer at the plant. Ganser asserted, that regardless of the weather, there is at least 3 months heating supply. 
J:<'r. Jerome Wilson, vice president of business affairs for the University Pxpressed a more optimistic outlook on the coal situation predicting. "We won't run short even if the strike runs until March." Although, if the strike forced drastic measures, heat might be cut off after daytime hours as a last resort, he suggested. 
The strike is crucial as the steam produced for heating purposes is primarily derived from coal, with oil providing "only 15 to 20 percent of the total fuel," according to Ganser. This oil is much more expensive to purchase than coal. 
The chief engineer indicated that the power plant had been burning gas for the last seven months at a a much lower cost than burning either oil or coal, but this source had been cut off as of Nov. 1. He added further that gas will not be 

available as a heat source for the next five months. 
The cost of coal has risen, indicated Fr. Wilson, "from $14.50 to $34.50 per ton from last fall to this fall." Over the last two years "the fuel budget has increased from approximately $1.5 million in 1973-74 to the present $2 million which an estimate of $2.8 million for next year," he continued. This hike in price is equal to a $100 increase per student, Wilson com­mented. 
{'oat is main source of heating 
According to Ganser, part of the increase was due to the fact that former coal suppliers would not sell to the University this year forcing Notre Dame to search out new sources. The result was a contract with a firm which provided coal transported by truck from southern Indiana. This tran­sportation proved more costly than the railroad services previously employed, and thus, directly affected one cost of heating by coal in general. 
Ganser stressed that the University is in a relatively comfortable position now at the onset of the strike, although he feared to speculate what the situation might be like if the strike is long. ''If the strike lasts three months, there will be a drastic nationwide shortage of key coal related products, such as electricity and gasoline, he predicted. 
Gasner also emphasized that most of 
the power of the midwest is generated 
by coal. He added that other univer­
sities face similar fuel problems such 
as Purdue, which operates on coal and 
oil power sources and Indiana 
University which he indicated might be 
operating on 100 percent coal. 


Both Banser and Fr. Wilson urged students to take a serious approach to conserving energy in view of the fuel crisis. Wilson's main appeal was for students to turn off unnecessary lights, which in wasting electricity depletes the coal supply which the University uses to make most of its electricity. 
Ganser stressed that the purpose of conserving energy would be as much a consideration by others in the same sense as a concern for saving money. "It is more humane that we conserve. for if we waste fuel and must acquire more, other people in other places won't be able to get it." 
A program will be organized as a conservation appeal to the students under the direction of Fr. James Flanigan, chairman of the Art Department.

Possible totape Nixon's testimony 
by Valerie Zurblis Staff Reporter 
Associate Law Dean David T. Link said there is a possibility of legally videotaping former President Nixon's testimony in the Watergate coverup trial. 
"It's an excellent idea to videotape the testimony of an ill witness or any witness for that matter," the law and technology expert said. "The film could be used for backup evidence or in case anything happens to the witnesses." 
Professor Link did stress that a personal testimony is best in most cases. "I'd rather see the videotape used as a substitute only if it' saves time and money for court or for the parties," he con­tinued. 

Link said that most courts ac­dept videotaped statements as legal evidence but he also noted that there are some problems. The 
cameraman can have an effect on people's impressions. He can zoom in on a witness wringing his hands or similar actions which may influence the jury. 
The solution to that problem proposed by Link is to have a cameraman who is a neutral of­ficer of the court. The court can then discipline him if he starts editorializing· behind the camera. 
"They have to be careful with sensitive cases like Watergate," warned Link. Someone who knows about law and videotaping should be involved. The person has to be careful not to subjectively edit behind the camera," he stated. 
Another way to solve this problem would be to keep the -camera at one focal point throughout the entire testimony. However this becomes boring to watch and concentration is lost. Link's answer to this is to use a split screen set up. "I think Nixon's testimony should use split or corner screening. They could keep the camerafocused on Nixon and rotate the other corners bet­ween the questioning parties. That way viewers will keep interested in what is happenings," suggested Link. 
According to the dean ther are several situations where videotaping would be an ad­vantage. One is when the witness isn't available. Another is when it :saves money and more citizens could afford to bring suit. "For example," started Link, "doctors are almost impossible to get to testify because they are on call for emergencies. With the videotape, the jury can see the witness testify when they are ready." 
Another advantage of videotaping is film editing. If a lawyer objects to something being said and the· judge sustains, usually the jurors will be asked to disregard the statement. When a videotape is used it can be edited and the jury would never know what was deleted. "The tape compacts the whole testimony," said Link. "It also cuts down on lawyers' theatrics," he added. 
Link started his career with a background in law and the com­puter field. He developed a computer system of law research and was later made chairman of the American Bar Association's

Nixon released today 
WASHINGTON (UPl) -Press Secretary Ron Nessen Wed­nesday announced a long an­ticipated shake-up in his White House staff, including a new assignment for Nixon holdover Gerald L. Warren. 
Warren, 44, a former assistant managing editor for the San Diego Union who serfved as chief spokesman for Richard M. Nixon in his last year of his presidency, will continue to serve as deputy press secretary with new duties. 
Warren's new taks will be to serve as a liason with other government public information officers and editors and broad­casters outisde of Washington-a job similar to that of White House communications director previously held by Herbert Klein and Ken Clawson. 
Nessen said that John W. Hushen will remain his deputy in the press office. Paul Miltich, who was President Ford's press secretary when Ford was the vice­president, will become a special assistant to the President and 
perform various writing assign­ments, including presidential statements and correspondence. 
Tom DeCair, another Nixon holdover, will continue to work as an assistant to Nessen in the press office and Bill Roberts, one of Ford's vice-presidential spokemen, was name das assistant press secretary to deal with the electronic media. 
Nessen also announced that Larry speaks has been promoted from staff assistant to assistant press secretary to work under Warren and Louis M. Thompson Jr., of Ames, Iowa, will be an assistant press secretary in charge of administration. Thompson, a retired Army mjaor, previously has served as a public affairs spokeman in Vietnam and at the Pentagon. 
Andrew Falkiewicz, currently a deputy press secretary, will be returning to the foreing service. His replacement will be another career foreign service officer, Edward Savage.

A food conservation program at St. Mary's was announced yesterday by Crawford Caswell, director of SAGA, the St. Mary's College food service. "It is not just a matter of saving money," Caswell said. "We are fortunate people. In Bangladesh people are starving." 
Charlie Flaim, manager of the food service, described the origin of the conservation program. "The whole program was in­stituted by some of our mana_gers within the SAGA Food Service Company who are concerned about 
ecology and the future," he ob­served. 
To help alleviate the world food crisis, the managers set up a six week program. Each week em­phasizes a particular theme. Last week; orientation week, the theme was "It pays tope. a clean plater." This week the theme "savea tree" emphasizes conserving paper and wood products such as napkins, for example. 
According to Caswell, the 


O'CONNOR 
.&.&.& 

program er:tploys basically the same princi1-les as the ecology program that Coca Cola sponsored at Notre 'Dame last year. However, the managers used their own ideas. Flaim noted that in a couple of SAGA-run food services napkin wastage has been reduced 40-50 per cent simply by reminding 
people  to  be  thrifty  with  the  
resources they have.  
Caswell  added  that  "in  those  

areas where we are able to measure waste, the information will be relayed to the students." To stimulate support for the program, students will give out candy and other items to people who have "done good deeds con­cerning ecology," such as eating all the food on their plates, etc., Flaim said. The idea, according to Flaim, is to :reward students who help the program. 
Employees will also wear twelve different pins, each one em­phasizing a different theme. Flaim concluded that "a few dollars saved can go towards next year." "Each year affects the 
. next," he added.

Students pledge to forego normal meal 
by Gregg Bangs

The Notre Dame World Hunger Coalition took pledges outside the dining hall yesterday at dinner for the purpose of getting students to forego a normal dining hall meal in exchange for a bowl of rice and a cup of tea. This meal, will be served in the dining halls Nov. 26. 
Flights finalized 
Sr. Class trip scheduled 
by Mauri Miller Staff Reporter 
"With Ohio State's loss over the weekend, the enthusiasm for the senior . class trip has become fanatical," said senior class treasurer Chris Fenn. Plans for the trip to the Southern Cal football game over the Thanksgiving holidays are now being finalized. 
According to Fenn, 617 students have signed up for the trip and are scheduled to fly into Los Angeles Wednesday, Nov. 'l:/ in 3 chartered planes. 
Each plane has its distinct feature, Fenn said. The TWA, for example, has the fewest number of minors, and will be the best stocked flight of the four. "There will be a waiting room set up for our TWA people, where drinks will be served. In addition, there will be an open bar on the plane serving free drinks for anyone of age." Fenn pointed out that the three

WASHINGTON <UPI) -Nelson 
A. Rockefeller disclosed Wed­nesday that for each of the 15 years he was governor of New York he and his family spent an average of more than $1 million on his political campaigns. 
And during that same period, Rockefeller told the Senate Rules Committee hearing on his nomination to be vice president, he contributed another $1 million of his own money to the political campaigns of others. 
Rockefeller said the family funds were spent on four suc­cessful races for governor and three unsuccessful bids for the Republican presidentail nomination. 
His breakdown: -About $2.25a2$8,: my most en­thusiastic and generous backer, my stepmother, the late Martha Baird Rockefeller." 
Rockefeller testified Wednesday that he gave $550,000 to William J. Ronan, head of the New York Port Authority, to help him with "financial responsibilities after retirement." 
In testimony before the Senate Rules Committee which reopened hearings on his nomination, Rockefeller decsribed Ronan as a close personal friend and a long­valued associate. 
Ronan, who is scheduled to testify later, is the most con­troversial recipient of a Rockefeller gift. The $550,000 he received was by far the largest among the $2.5 million in gifts and Iones Rockefeller made to political associates. 
Ronan had been Rockefeller's chief of staff when he was New York governor and was later appointed to head New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority and later the Port Authority. 
Rockefeller testified he never other flights will also provide beverages accordingly. Fight laws restrict drinking to those legally allowed to drink and say that the point of departure determines the legal drinking age. 
The main feature of the United Airlines flight is that it will depart from South Bend rather that from Chicago. "This means an extra three hours of sleep Wednesday morning for our United people," stated Fenn. 
As far as locating men and women evenly, TWA and United forced a revision in seating arrangements. "Neither TWA nor United recognize St. Mary's as part of the Notre Dame group, so the two American 707's will include everyone from St. Mary's. This means approximately a 50-50 ratio on each of the American planes," Fenn said. 
The $230 trip will include a round trip ticket to Los Angeles with a meal on each flight, five nights at Following the meal, Father Hesburgh will say Mass and preach on the world food crisis in Sacred Heart Church at 11:00 p.m.

"I recognize that, because of the size of the loans and my gifts, that many feel that there must be something more to this than friendship -that maybe I was trying to buy influence for some personal gain or personal power," Rockefeller said.

Any group which has a person at elast 21, will be provided with a rental car upon arrival at the hotel. A slight fee may be charged the driver for insurance, but there will be unlimited mileage for each car. 
Fenn pointed out that one of the major spots of interest would be the "swinging" Marina del Rey district, which is only a short distance from the hotel, and a very good area for night entertainment. Other nearby places of interest include the Hollywood Park racetrack, Knott's Berry Farm, Universal Studios, two 18-hole golf courses, beaches, Disneylpnd, Beverly Hills and Marineland. 
The International Hotel offers three lounges, including the world­famous Penthouse Lounge on the fourteenth floor of the building, and also three dinging areas," Fenn commented. 
Packages will be distributed late next week and will include bus fare, plane and game tickets as well as other information. Notice of when and where to pick them up will be gien early next week. 
"There has been a rumor floating that class officers have been showing some people favoritism, and I'd like to clarify this," said Fenn. "We're showing favoritism to anyone who requested it in the form of a memo. 
Any memos we've received requesting adjacent rooms, same flights, etc., have been ac­commodated." 
Fenn added, however, that lists have now been submitted to the airlines and further adjustments cannot be honored.

Roemer emphasized that all people interested should sign up as soon as possible because "we need to have an approximate number in order to estimate how many peple will be taking part in this meal." 
This combination dinner-Mass event is the first of a number of activities planned by the coalition for this year. Included among the possible activities are a possible Lenten fast and several group panel discussions on the problems caused by world hunger. 
One of these discussions will take place tonight in the library lounge at 8:00p.m. and will deal with the "Ethics of food, population and energy." Edward A. Malloy, Edward Manier and Basil O'Leary

FRESHMAN PREREGISTRATION FOR ARMY BOT(' 
Preregistration for the Freshman Army ROTC Spring Session will be held Nov. 14~21, 1974. 
No military obligation is incurred during Freshman and Sophomore years, and by enrolling, you become eligible to compete for a two-year Army ROTC scholarship during your Sophomore year. It pays full tuition, for books and academic fees, as well as $100 per month subsistence allowance. Even without a scholarship, you receive $100 monthly in your Junior and Senior years. 
Army ROTC can offer you a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the US Army Reserve concurrent with your graduation from college with a starting salary of $10,000.00 a year in addition to other liberal fringe benefits. 
If you then decide to leave the Army, you'll find that employers realize that a young graduate who possesses the attributes of leadership essential for Army officers is an excellent addition to their firm. 
The Army ROTC course consists of two class hours per week and is open to all Freshmen at NQtre Dame or other nearby cross-enrolled colleges. Course hours can be arranged by telephoning Major Jim Musselman at 283-6264 or by contacting him at the Notre Dame ROTC building.

The Notre Dame Hunger Coalition is an organization of Notre Dame community members interested in helping combat the world hunger crisis. The coalition is made up of the Students in the non-violence program, CILA, Campus Ministry and other con­cerned people. 
The program is not restricted to the Notre Dame campus. The St. Mary's International Club Dinner recently sent all of its proceeds to the cause of World Hunger. 
Anybody interested in joining the coalition should contact Mary Ann Roemer at 6536. St. Mary's students should contact Rita Cassidy or Debbie Dunlap.

Arab-Israeli clash 



over~afat speech 
NEW YORK <UPI) A small army of police kept fights between Israeli and Arab supporters to minor scuffles Wednesday outside U.N. head­quarters where Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat spoke to the General Assembly. 
Police arrested four persons after fistfights broke out. 
The two groups gathered in the street in front of the towering Secretariat Building and shouted taunts at each other across police barricades. But except for the few scuffles quickly broken up by police, the demonstrations were peaceful. 
Security around the U.N. compound was the tightest in a long series of appearances by controversial leaders. About I,000 police were assigned to protect Arafat and his Palestine Liberation Organization re­presentatives. 
Coast Guard vessels patrolled the East River below U.N. headquarters, while across the river security agents were on patrol to prevent any long­distance rocket attacks. 
Police sharpshooters stood guard in skyscrapers overlook­ing the United Nations. On U.N. grounds at least 16 guards were seen brandishing subma­chineguns. 
Security was tightened Mon­day after Russell Kelner, chief of operations of the militant Jewish Defense League, was arrested on charges of threat­ening to assassinate Arafat.

WORLD HUNGER· DINING HALLS· NOVEMBER 26 
This week, as the World Food Conference ends in Rome, some 10,000 people will have died of starvation in Africa, Asia, Latin America. Many here at Notre Dame feel that something can be done about this crisis, in the short run and in terms of long run strategies. 
On Tuesday, November 26, Fr. Hesburgh will say Mass and preach on the food crisis at 11:00 p.m. in Sacred Heart Church. 
During supper, 5:00-6:30, on that day the Notre Dame community .. students faculty, administration, friends from South Bend·· plan to share a meal. This i~ the first of a year's activities to allow us a small taste of what millions feel daily and, possibly, to save some money that can be sent to the suffering. 
We are inviting students to give up their regular meal in the dining hall and to join some 3,000, we hope, of the community in one or both of the dining halls for a bowl of rice and a cup of tea. To carry out this plan, we are asking you to pledge to forego the regular meal served that evening and to give us your dining hall number so that the Food Services will know not to expect you.

Languages, University of Salamanca 
Salamanca, Span secured by our intrepid 
editor for the edification of the Notre Dame 
Reading public from the waste paper basket 
in Professorin von der Voeglweide's Carrel! 
When we addressed the Notre Dame community in our last column it was with unshaken faith in the essential goodness and rationality of its members and no doubt as to our plea's salutary effect upon the miserable Gumms-Buhndoggel Debacle. 
Alas for the trusting in these evil days! Alas for the rare scholar among us (even those whose abilities are as humble as our own) in these days of factions and controversy! Alas and alack for truth! Alas, alack and weladay for pleasant courtesy and sweet disputations in formed in their very punc­tuation by the spirit of fraternal charity! Who shall defend the gentle arts and gracious sciences while they bicker among themselves? Who shall rescue the ignorant, those who dwell in darkness without the benefit of the trivium and quadrivium and good Latin usage--let along Old Norse and lead them into the kindly land of gram­merye? Not this academic community. We appealed and were cast aside like a fool for our child-like simplicity in insisting on charity and truth--out of the mouths of babes, out of the mouths of babes, oh you wretched disterbers of the academic calm! We hope St. Catherine of Alexandria smites you all, everyone. What grief and scandal you have brought to pass--what confusion of honest students and scholars! Think of your good names--what remains of them--have you no shame! No care for what posterity will hear of you? You vainglorious haughty 
few, can you not emulate the sounder, more 
charitable practices of your fellows? Are not cockroach races sufficient, are your energies not consumed by plying the eraser and sharpening pencils under the super­vision of two such scholars at whose feet you might be proud to sit at and learn charity, courtesy and sound method? Is truth served by your kidnapping a learned man of most sweet . disposition and angelic erudition away from his houseplants even as he watered them? Is either of those equally learned adversaries whose cause you supposedly espouse--although in truth we maintain you espose no cause but your own and mischiefs! -aided by outrage against all decency, all academic courtesy? Was not that rock enough, were not those everlasting pots sufficient, that foiled with the ducks you must take your revenge with Claren­don? 
We appeal to those who have stood above· the hysteria of the past weeks to unite behind the aegis of the Royal Geophysical Society and right this most abominable wrong and restore the position of Notre Dame in the world of letters. Be not provoked by this outrage into emulation but rather lend your support to the maintenance of reaso'l. Still the human passions aroused by sympathy for those poor abandoned African violets, those Boston ferns droping from want of a familiar voice, those coleus declining like a Latin noun into their mother dust and lend your voices to us, add your 
influence to ours; for a time has come when drastic measures must be proposed-· imposed if need be. Therefore we call upon Miss Gumms and Professor Buhndoggel to hold disputation with one another according to the University of Paris Rules as laid down by the learned Peter Abeland and adopted by the University of Paris during the chancellorship of Odo. Though they are innocent of any act unbefitting an academic yet they are in some measure responsible for curbing the excesses of their followers and therefore we require of them on pain of dismissal from the Royal Geophysical Society to hold said disputation before the faculty and students of this illustrious in­stitution and defend before them the truth of their theories and their interpretations of their findings. 
In the meantime if the students who kidnapped Doctor Johannes Claredon would return him to his office unharmed we will be pleased to interecede for you with the C.I.A. 




social action and inward study 
While the winter snow swirls downward and the fall semester rushes onward, several Notre Dame students are already busy planning their forthcoming summer. 
Not what one might term typical summer jobs, their tasks may include anything from teaching grammar to perspective nursing students on the Caribbean island of St. Lucia to running a recreation program on a North Dakota Indian reservation to helping organize programs which may solve community related problems in a New Orleans district. This aware and purposeful group of college students are united under the title "Council for the International Lay Apostalate" <CILA) founded twelve years ago at Notre Dame. As CILA expresses in a brochure, "they felt a curiosity, a concern and most of all a need to explore their caring by some meaningful action." 
In addition to their summer projects, the members have initiated programs within the South Bend area in which CILA volunteers tutor Spanish-speaking high school students, visit the elderly, and assist in running a day-care cneter. On a more international level, members are developing "a comprehensive educational and action response" to the problem of world hunger. 


beaux arts ball: frivolous and decadent 
The semi-annual Beaux Arts Ball will be held this Saturday, November 16, in the Architecture Building. The theme is "Uranus, An Intergalactic Extravaganze," one which will certainly draw a crowd of unearthly creatures. The action begins at 9:30, accompanied by the music of "Talisman." 
Tickets consist of a plastic ray gun and instructions on how to build your own rocket. These valuable items sell for $5.00 
er couple and should be purchased in advance at the Architecture Library. A couple does not necessarily have to be two 
embers of the opposite sex. 
The Beaux Arts Ball has enjoyed a long 
istory. It began in France at the Ecole 
Naturally such involvements with social actions result with inward studies, learning experiences, and questioning reflections. As Mary Beckman, one of its members, 
points out, "Each project is not an isolated experience in itself. We share what we've learned with each other." 
Sharing is an important concept with CILA. Its members work and share and grow together through the celebration of the Holy Eucharist, weekend retreats at the beginning of each semester, and various social events. To be mindful of the problems of famine, an occasional meal of rice is prepared and shared among the members. 
To help finance their projects, CILA is presently conducting a Christmas card sales campaign with a booth set up in the library lobby from 11 to 3 and from 6 to 8 Monday through Friday. Supplementing this, money was earned from a film 
screening earlier in the semester. CILA also shares in a collection from one of the Sunday masses with five other community action groups. Alumni members of the organization remain close to the group and frequently donate time, money, and sup­port. 
Last spring, the group was distinguished by being the recepient of the Reinhold Niebuhr award. An excerpt from the citation adds further dimension to the CILA concept: "At a time in the history of our country when cynicism and apathy appear to dominate the lives of so many people, and particularly it is said, the lives of college students, Notre Dame, through its Reingold Niebuhr Award, wishes to honor today an organization that represents a hopeful development in student life on our campus and also represents a great and

positive potential for the future.'' 
Certainly an idealistic cause yet ~one which should be striven for in the hope of attaining world harmony, CILA's main goal is "to work for justice in the world by I serving:. learning, celebrating, and sharing with one another and a multiple of people contacted through a variety of ac­tivities." Students wishing to join the organization should contact either CILA's secretary, Marianne Cleary (4438) or the director of community services, Larry Schlereth (287-0740).

d'Beaux Arts and was usually held in the fall at the completion of a long project. Students and faculty joined together in an elaborate costume ball that was designed to release tension. The tradition has since been transferred to the United States and has been going on for years at Notre Dame. 
The student chapter of the American Institute of Architecture sponsors the event, with Gene Aleci chairing this semester's ball. It is an inter-departmental affair for architecture students and a chance for them to socialize informally with their professors. 
Balls that have been held in the past have been everything from decadent to frivolous. "A Garden of Earthly Delights" was decorated with leaves, pumpkins, ivy hanging from the balcony, and little mirrors hanging from the ceiling. Five people came dressed as a long caterpillar and someone else slithered in as a snake. Oneenthusiast dressed himself like Pan, complete with fur leggings and grapes in his hair. 
"The SUpermarket Stomp" inspired all sorts of original costumes. One fellow wrapped himself in saran wrap--he was supposed to be a rump roast. Someone came dressed as a carrot and one girl was a bag of jelly beans, accomplished with the help of many balloons. 'The Architecture Gallery was decorated with large posters and price tags. 
"Blimps: Incredible Derigible Boogie" attracted pilots with leather headgear and

airplane costumes. One imaginative girl came dressed as the sky, wearing all blue with stars scattered over her. World War II movies flashing on the walls contributed to the cartoon-like environment. 
Other balls have been "The Age of Decadence," "Grand Hotel," and "Frac­tured Fairy Tales." Each has generated its own unique atmosphere. 
Matt Kubik, publicity chairman (who is currently searching for a pair of silver knee socks!), calls the Beaux Arts Ball "a per­sonal theatre. It is a great chance to fan­tasize, to play the role of someone or something else for a night." Is there any of us who wouldn't welcome the chance to do that?

Sniper ambJShes school bJs escort 

By KARL C. LILLY 
CHARLESTON, W. Va. (UPI) -A State Police car escorting a school bus loaded with children was struck from ambush by sniper fire Wednes­day in the Kanawha County textbook feud. · 
Another State Police car was fired upon, but not hit, in the county's fourth shooting inci­dent in three days. It was the first in the 11 week protest in which law officers were the targets. 
The two troopers in the cruiser that was hit, Dan Miller and J. C. Barker, were not injured by the gunfire. The other shooting incidents in­volved empty school buses. 
Troopers Miller and Barker said they did not return the fire for fear of endangering the children. 
Neither State Police nor school officials could say how many children were aboard the bus when the cruiser was hit. 
Classroom attendance was about 75 per cent of the county's 45,000 pupils despite parent's threats to keep chil­dren at home and set up their own schools. 
A State Police spokesman said what appeared to be rifle fire struck the right rear quarter panel of the cruiser and blew a tire. 
Other troopers and sheriff's deputies rushed to the area, known as Five-Mile, in Camp­bell's Creek, just east of Charleston, and the scene of earlier violence. 
State troopers with shotguns and sheriff's deputies searched the heavily wooded area but found nothing. 
The violence this week in the southern West Virginia coal mining area was erupted after the Kanawha County Board of Education voted to return most of a series of controversial textbooks to classrooms. 
Protesting parents contend the books are immoral and unpatriotic. The struggle in­volves who will determine what the county's children will be taught. 
State Police and sheriff deputies began patroling poten­tial trouble spots in the county Wednesday morning after three school buses were struck by gunfire earlier this week. Two were hit Monday night and one Tuesday morning. The buses did not contain children and the drivers were not hit.

Barnet seeks cooperation in economic crisis 
Dr. Richard Barnet of the In­stitute for Policy Studies, Washington, D.C., called Tuesday for corporations to make certain commitments to cities before they settle in a specific location. 
Addressing participants in the Catholic Committee on Urban Ministry conference on"Justice and the Economic System," Barnet said "the old myth that corporations are totally private institutions is in fact not true,'' but, he continued, our cities now are in the same position as undeveloped countries with respect to·· the corporations because they don't know when they're being "milked." 
Barnet suggested that a city should draw up a 'bill of rights' 
Ford critized 
that would require a corporation to adhere to certain rules and commitments. 
The balance of power between the corporation and the com­munity must change, he added, and to be effective, the change must come at both the local and national levels. 
Barnet talked about the possibilities of reform. in the economic system, saying. that "the future is ominous in many ways and the situation is extraordinarily difficult," but that it is foolish not to acknowledge bases of hope. 
"I believe a base exists -in the 
U.S. today for a political movement," Barnet said. "There is a potential majority of Americans who feel themselves to be the 'have nots' in society." He said the .reasons for such a movement are clear: unem­ployment, inflation, the unequal tax structure, and the lack of housing, credit, and health and all social services. 
However, while more poeple are seeing that the establishment is unable to deliver the promises that are part of the American dream, he said, there is another strain of American populism which is reactionary and isolationist, and rests on getting rights for one group at the expense of others. 
Barnet also proposed an alter­native food distribution system to food chains which would be sup­ported by public funds and, ultimately, by a national food co-op fund.

barrels per day by 1975. Com­menting on the gasoline tas, Bonello said that the addition of a 40 or 50 cent tax would be good in that it would produce a lot of revenue. Bonello also said that a tax like this would possibly curb consumption of the precious fuel. For has asked that the use of fuel oil be eliminated and that electric generators be improved. He has also suggested the prices of natural gas be de-regulated which Bonello said would cause a tremendous price rise. 
To increase competition, Ford increased the penalties for an­titrust violations: for the cor­porations, the fines have been raised from $50,000 to $1,000,000 
and  from  $50,000  to  $100,000  for

"Maybe  this  will  make  the  

corporations back off and keep their wages and prices in line with the regulations," commented Bonello. Ford also asked for the reduction and publication of fee rates for doctors, lawyers, and other professionals. In response to this, Bonello said that according to this proposal, all doctors and lawyers would have to compete with each other which they would not do. 
When asked if the United States was in a recession, Bonello said it was not as serious as it looked. He added that the economics rule of thumb for determining that a recession is occuring is two con­secutive quarters of GNP decline, and that there is such a decline. The U.S. is in its third quarter of GNP decline and the fourth does not look promising. 
"But I think Ford has taken two small steps in the right direction," concluded Bonello.

Gas tax drain British 
By JOSEPH W. GRIGG 
LONDON (UPI) -British motorists drained gasoline sta­tions dry Wednesday in a panic rush to fill up their tanks before a new tax hike boosts the price by up to 15 per cent next Monday. 
Long lines of cars formed outside gasoline stations, block­ing traffic on main highways. 
"Motorists are trying to drain every garage in sight before Monday," said a spokesman for the Automobile Association. 
A Royal Automobile Club spokesman said, "If they keep up the rush, some places will run short before tankers can call again." 
Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey slapped a new 25 per cent tax on gasoline effective next Monday in a cns1s budget presented to Parliament Tuesday. 

T.V. net'Works file application to 
WASHINGTON ( UPil -The three major television networks Wed­nesday formally asked U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica to allow them to broadcast White House tapes introduced as evidence in the Watergate cover­up trial. 
The networks suggested that Sirica 's existing ban on broad­easting the tapes violates con­stitutional guarantees of freedom of the press and fully public trials. 
A formal application was filed with Sirica by the National Broadcasting Co., Inc., the American Broadcasting Co., Columba Broadcasting System and the Radio-Television News 1 Directors Association. 
"The case your honor is now in the midst of tying may well be more important, in a wide variety of ways, than any trials every before conducted in the history of this nation," the application said. 
"Movant those -making the motion seek ... the right to inform the public contents of trial exhibits introduced in evidence which are of overriding national import in the unique way broadcasting can best do so."

Officials estimated the tax hike, coupled with price in­creases planned by oil com­panies, will push the price of a gallon of gasoline up 24 cents to $1.53 a gallon as of Monday -a record high price in Britain and a price increase of about 15 per cent. 
Healey said the new gasoline tax was designed to cut oil imports and save the country $480 million of desperately needed foreign exchange. 
The budget was the third Healey has handed Britons this year and he said there will be still another next April. 
They were designed to fight the country's inflation-fed eco­nomic crisis, which the govern­ment has termed Britain's grimmest since World War II. 
Healey pumped $3.6 billion of help into cash-starved industry in a bid to hold back unemployment, which he warned is likely to hit the 1 million mark this winter. 
He also gave help to retired and needy Britons. 
But the crisis blueprint touched off a storm of criticism. 
The Sun newspaper said, "Healey lit the fuse for a new cost of living explosion." 
The London Daily Mail said, "Healey sent a shiver down the spines of almost everyone in Britain." 
Left-wing members of the governing Labor party rapped it as "a budget to help big business." 
Big business was not pleased either. 
Ralph Bateman, president of the Confederation of British Industry, which represents 12,000 industrial companies, said: "We shall not have enough money to keep our business going. We shall not be able to keep as many people in jobs as we would like."
