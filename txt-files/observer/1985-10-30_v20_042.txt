Ad prompts letters ,to Tyson on handling of parietal violations 
BySCOTI BE.ARBY 
AssistuntNews Editor 
Letters objecting to recent ad­ministration action concerning parietals violations have been received after a Hall Presidents' Council ad concerning the issue ran in the Observer, said HPC Chairman Kevin Howard at last night's meeting. 
HPC is calling attention to Univer­sity ability to suspend or dismiss stu· dents who are in violation of parietals, regardless of cir­cumstances. Although HPC agreed "parietals are a positive influence on the residendality of Notre Dame," they question removing a student from the University "when there is no moral Issue in question." 
Howard called on the presidents to encourage more letter writing to Vice President ofStudent Allairs Fat­

Government Parliamentarian Brian Holst clarified a vote taken at the last HPC meeting concerning the dis­banding of Student Senate. At that meeting, hall presidents voted by a 2/3 majority to put the issue to a stu· dent referendum after debating the legitimacy ofthe body. 
According to Holst, they should not have voted to have a referen· dum, since that procedure would not be binding. He said if the body is going to take any action ·it should propose an amendment to the stu­dent government constitution, since disbanding senate is a structural change. 

Another vote was taken last night on whether senate should be dis­banded, this time putting the proposal In the form of an amend­ment. By a vote of 19 for, three against, one abstention, and one ab­sence, the proposal again passed. 
According to Holst, the issue needs to be approved by a 213 majorityofthe senate ora 2/3 agree­ment by the undergraduates who decide to vote on whether senate should cease to exist. Student Body Vice President Duane Lawrence said OBUD will be setting a date for the student vote, probably within the next week. 
Howard said he and the original group of student leaders who proposed the abolition ofsenate are currently working on revising the constitution should the students vote to disband the body. Some of the power currently held by senate would go to the Campus Ufe Coun­cil, while HPC would be delegated

Abortion activist to speak today about pro-life activities 
By CHRIS SKORCZ 
Sentar StuffReporter 
Joseph Scheidler, executive direc­tor of the Pro-Ufc Action League, will speak tomorrow at R:OO p.m. in the Ubrary Auditorium on the topic "Activism in the Pro-Ufc Move­ment." 
Scheidler, whose pro-life educa­tional organization works through the media to increase public aware­ness of abortion-related issues, has been called "one ofthe Green Berets of the pro-life movement" by nationally-syndicated columnist Patrick Buchanan. 
His methodll of drawing attention to his organization are highly "controversial" according to Profes­sor Janet· Smith of the Notre Dame/St. Mary's Right to Ufe Group. 
"Scheidler is very outspoken," said Smith. "His method is con­frontational, a method which reminds many people of the tech­niques used in the 1960's to protest the Vietnam War. He employs the same methods in defending the rights of the unborn. 
"Because many people find him s0 controversial, we thought it would be fair to let him present his views and defend his techniques," Smith said. 

Scheidler, a former writer for the South Bend Tribune, has taught jour­nalism and speech at Notre Dame. He has also served as public informa­tion director for the city ofChicago. 
In addition to his book. "Closed: 99 Ways to Shut Down the Abortion Industry," Scheidler has had articles published in many major newspapers and magazines and has made more than 500 radio and television appearances. 
Also today, Scheidler will be giving a demonstration of his sidewalk counseling techniques at the Women's Pavilion on St. Louis Blvd. from 4 to '>:30 p.m. It Is this technique, in particular, for which Scheidler has drawn much fire. 
"Sidewalk counseling Is a procedure, the goal ofwhich is to of­fer assistance to women before they enter the abortion clinic, " Smith said. "Scheidler has helped thousands ofwomen have babies by stopping them before they go into the clinic and by tcUing them that help is available at a care center. 
"Sidewalk counseling is not like demonstrating or picketing which are directly concerned with making a statement before the media," she said. 
Hurricane Juan swamps Gulf area 
MORGAN CITY, La. · Unex­pected Hurricane Juan wobbled ashore and stalled again yesterday, knocking down a third oil rig as its heavy rain and 8') mph winds whipped offshore waves 20 feet high and drove tides up to I 0 feet above normal against inland levees. 
At least three people were dead and four missing, including three believed trapped in a drilling rig that toppled in a marsh. Ap· proximately 160 people had been rescued from rigs and boats in the Gulf of Mexico and adjacent waters over three days, the Coast Guard said. 
By 3 p.m. CST, however, Juan's winds diminished to 65 mph, and the National Weather Service downgraded it to a tropical storm. At 5 p.m., the poorly defined center ofJuan was estimated to be near latitude 30.4 north, longitude 

92.1 west, near Lafayette, La. 
Displaced snakes, including poisonous water moccasins, and balls of stinging fire ants floated through some flooded streets. 
The storm, which surprised forecasters when it strengthened into a hurricane Sunday and then stalled for a day just off the coast, came ashore and then stalled ncar Lafayette. 
By noon, winds on land had gusted to 40 mph and heavy bands of rain extended from the Gulf south of Mobile, Ala., to Jackson, Miss., and as far east as Florida. 
Offshore, winds were clocked at 85 mph and kicked up 20-foot waves at noon, seven hours after Juan moved ashore near here, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Gary Stark. 
Tornadoes spun out of the rain clouds at Laurel, Miss., and Orange Beach, Ala., damaging trees, a barn and a trailer home at Laurel and a store and car at Orange Beach. In Florida, a tornado caused minor damage to the Panama City suburb of Calloway, and rain flooded streets in Jacksonville, on the At· !antic coast. Southeastern Texas had gotten almost 7.25 inches of rain since Sunday. 
Divers from the Coast Guard and the Louisiana Department of Wild Ufc and Fisheries cut holes in the steel hull of a jackup drilling rig

Viewpoint Editor

truth is that students are hostages to the quality of leadership available. More often than not, few really 

qualified leaders are at the helm ofstudent government organizations; however, my freshman year was one time when people of vision, not politicians, used con­structive methods for beneficial change. 
At a time when Healy-Haters and Bill-Bashers are gat­hering signatures to oust the student body president, I thought I would share with 50 percent of the student body not here two years ago some of the actions and characteristics ofthe then student leaders. 
FormerJudicial Coordinator Bob Gleason, a catalytic agent for student rights, took the Judicial Council from a skeleton ofan organization 
and the student protest to the alcohol policy much stronger events than had he not been present. 
The phone installation was one of several minor changes which occurred only because a studem took the time to do it. 
These two leaders symbolize an era when leaders worked hard, expected and received little applause, tenaciously pursued set goals and most importantly shared a vision ofwhat should and could be done. They were student workers as much as student leaders. 
Today's leaders are the

Gleason got Roemer to clarify ambiguous points in du Lac and offered parietals policy alternatives to the administration. He even began a newsletter to keep council members informed. Under Gleason, the concept ofa students' rights manual began to be formulated. 
Another leader who performed his duties well was former Student Senator Dave MeAvoy who lead the fight to win a series of minor victories for students' needs. 
In an Observer commentary, Mark Worscheh, former managing editor of The Observer, noted McAvoy's success on the "parking lot issues" which are "the little things student government workers do to make life for the rest ofus a little better." 
McAvoy, impressive in speech and in deed, got more phones placed in the basement of Memorial library. Having the phones installed took four months of working through the burea-ucratic obstacles. McAvoy, along with others, helped make the Mock Convention 
The solution to rebuilding student government rests in putting the right people in the ri""gbt place at the right time for the right reasons. Success ultimately becomes a question of motives, and for too long the motives of student leaders have been questionable. Students, such as MeAvoy and Gleason, may not have been right always, but their intentions were always beyond question. 
Student government needs students who care about the success ofstudent goals more than personal desires, who fight for what is right rather than what is ex­pedient, and who are too busy improving themselves and the organizations which they lead to attack others. 
This, though, is not to suggest Notre Dame is without such student leaders today. That would be unfair to many leaders who do care, who do work hard, who do do the job the way it should be done. In fact, they are the ones who have kept student government from total collapse. I only hope they will be there to pick up the pieces and rebuild in the weeks ahead.

Panel reviews apartheid options 
ByELLYN MASTAKO 
StoffReporter 
Notre Dame's role in South Africa was discussed by a p~el in Flanner Hall last night. 
Professor Peter Walshe, one of three panelists, began with a discus­sion of his views on the apartheid system. Walshe, a South African native, spoke ofhis country's plight. 
"Those who are pro-investment don't realize the powerlessness 'of the blacks in South Africa and the high infant mortality rate. It's easy under the dome and in Corby Hall to argue, 'let's give the South African government a little more time to change."' 
He continued, "They have to realize that the black protests began in 1912, and the United States has been condemning the apartheid since 1948. 
"The issues are no longer mkro­issues like integration of toilets. They are now macro-issues. We are moving into a period where increas­ing white repression will lead to in­creasing 4 black resistance and escalated violence." 
Father Oliver Williams, associate professor of management, and anot­her panelist, told ofhis involvement with the apartheid issue, which began with an interest in the ethics ofinvestments in South Africa. As he sees it, there are two schools of ~ought with regarding investments in South Africa. 
First, is the theory that if Notre Dame divests, it will make an economic impact on the companies that are in South Africa, and they will, in turn, disinvest in South Africa. This disinvestment would have an economic impact on the country and, it is hoped, cause the country to come to a speedy, and satisfactory change in political sys­tems. 
The other theory suggests Notre Dame should try to use the cor­porate power that it has as stock­holders, and try to advance human rights and abolish apartheid. 
He told of the aboliltion of apar­theid in the South African workplace. Blacks are in maru~ge­ment positions and are receiving equal pay; in wider society, however, things are quite dlft'erent. Even black executives are forced to live in black neighborhoods that have slum conditions. 
Williams said, "The issue is, 'Is

j

He does not agree with Walshe's

strategy of divestiture. Instead, Wil­liams believes that the best chance for change lies within the multi­national corporate structure. 
"Businesses are the most progressive vehicles in alleviating the apartheid system," he said, at which point Walshe interrupted, saying that the Black protestors are actually the most progressive vehicles for alleviating the apartheid system. 
Williams concluded, "The Univer­sity's divestiture would do nothing because other investors would simply move in. Investors might be less sympathetic to the anti-apar­theid cause. I feel that the policy at Notre Dame of selective divestiture is the moral policy." 
Lee Tavis, professor offinance and business economics, was the third panelist. He taught in South Africa and told of his contact with its citizens, especially an aging revolu­tionary named Ernest. He told ofter­rorist training for black South Africans by the Russians and the Chinese. 
Accountancy chair set up 
SpedllliO The Obeerftr 
The Vincet and Rose Uzzadro Chair in Accountancy has been es­tablished at Notre Dame by the late couple's son, an Oak Park, IL, in­surance executive who graduated from the University in 1933. 
"It is especially fitting that Dominic Uzzadro has chosen to honor his parents and the University with the gift of an endowed chair," said Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., Notre Dame president. "His parents were hardworking people at whose core was their love of family. Their beliefin the value ofeducation is joined in this chair with Notre Dame's mission to offer higher learn­ing as a foundation In life." 
Vincent Uzzaddro emigrated to the United States from Baragiano, Italy, in 1912 at his wife's persua­sion. Leaving behind his land hol­dings In Italy, he settled In Chicago to work as a railroad laborer. His wife and three children joined him· in Chicago in 1914. 
In 1919 the family opened the Uz­zadro Bakery at 2130 W. Polk St., where they also occupied the upstairs living quarters. Uzzadro retired from the bakery business in 1951 at the age of71 and moved his family to Oak Park. He died in 1958; his wife died 16 years later. 
After receiving an accounting degree from Notre Dame in 1933, Dominic Uzzadro worked as an ex­aminer for the Illinois Insurance Department. In 1949 he formed his own company, Industrial Fire and Casualty, Oak Park, and retired this year as its president.

"Only by learning from mistakes," Ruhe said, "can a person develop the self-confidence he or she needs to advance in business. And sometimes that is a hard filet for women to ac­cept. 
"Most managers of businesses are men, and women do not naturally have the skills men are looking for," Ruhe continued. "That's because women have not had the same socialization men have had.

New 'slim disease' linked to AIDS 
NEW YORK -A new fatal disease that is linked to the AIDS virus and produces extreme weight loss has been found in heterosexuals in Africa, where It has become known as "slim disease." 
"Although slim disease resembles AIDS In many ways, it seems to be a new entity," its discoverers wrote in the Oct. 19 Issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal. 
AIDS and sllm disease share many of the same symptoms, the resear­chers report, but AIDS docs not generally produce the extreme weight loss and diarrhea seen in slim disease. 
Victims of slim disease are not as likely to exhibit the swollen lymph glands and the rare cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma, both common

features of AIDS, or acquired Immune deficiency syndrome, in American and European homosexuals, the researchers said. 
Sixty-three of 71 patients with slim disease showed evidence of in­fection with the AIDS virus. Studies are under way to determine why evidence ofthe virus did not appear in all patients, said the researchers, who Include Dr. Anne Bayley ofUni­versity Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia and Dr. Robin Weiss of the Institute ofCancer Research in London. 
The disease, found in Uganda and believed to have originated In Tan­zania, ditfers not only from AIDS in America but also from the heterosexual form of AIDS seen in neighboring Zaire, the researchers 
said.  Slim  disease  occurs  
predominantly  in  promiscuous  
heterosexuals.  

A separate case ofwhat appears to be slim disease was found in London in one patient who did not have evidence of infection with the AIDS virus, often designated HTLV-III. That patient, however, did carry an AIDS-like virus that has been is­olated and is now under study, the researchers said. 
Not aU researchers believe that slim disease is a new Illness, said Dr. 
· Timothy Dondero of the federal Centers for Disease Control in At­lanta. 
"It sounds to me like a variant of ARC (aids-related complex), a poorly defined collection .of condi­tions which are related to HTLV-III infection," Dondero said. He said that he could not comment in detail because he had not yet seen the ar­ticle in The Lancet.

House approves bill for Pentagon budget 
WASHINGTON -The House yes­terday approved a bill authorizing a record Pentagon budget for the cur­rent fiscal year after some liberal Democrats dropped complaints that had delayed the measure for three months. 
The bill, approved by voice vote, 
authorizes Defense Department 
spending of S302.5 billion in the fis. 
cal year that started Oct. 1. That will 
buy thousands ofplanes, ships, tanks 
and other weapons, but it also halves 
President Reagan's MX nuclear 
missile program from 100 to 50 of 
the 10-warhead weapons. 
It also permits development of new chemical weapons for the first time since 1969, although money to actually pay for the project was stripped last week from a com­panion spending bill. Those funds will have to be restored on the floor or else the Army could not build the nerve gas bombs and artillery shells. 
The Senate approved the aut­horization measure 94-5 three months ago, shortly after it emerged from a House-Senate conference committee called to resolve 1,200 ditferences between the versions passed by the Democratic­controlled House and Republican­run Senate. 
But some House liberals were unhappy with the bill, arguing that House members of the conference committee, led by Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D· Wis., made too many concessions. 
Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said yesterday the position of the House was not well-represented in the con­ference committee. 
For example, the House originally

THOROLD, Ontario -With a reopening deadline eight days away, the number of ships delayed by a damaged lock in the Wetland Canal grew yesterday as workers hastened repairs to the vital link In the blocked St. Lawrence Seaway. 
Gay Hensley, a spokeswoman for the Canadian St. Lawrence Seaway Authority in Ottawa, Said 110 ships have now informed the seaway they are waiting to pass through the Wei· land Canal when it reopens.

That compares to approximately 65 ships waiting to move through before the authority announced last Thursday a Nov. 6 tentative reopen­ing. 
Most ships are moored In the 26· mile long_ canal, some are at anchorages on either end of the canal in lakes Erie or Ontario, whlfe others are tied up at harbors along the seaway, which links the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean. 
Hensley said 63 of the ships waiting to pass through the canal are westbound, while the other 47 are eastbound.

Still to come Is a major fight over separate legislation that actually ap­propriates the money for the aut­horized spending. The House was scheduled to begin floor considera­tion today of a bill appropriating S292 billion for the Pentagon this year. 
The authorization bill had been scheduled for a floor vote In early August, shortly before a month-long recess, but was delayed because of the complaints from some House liberals. 
After the recess, Aspln and other Democratic leaders worked behind the scenes to deal with the com­plaints. 
At one point, Aspln had promised a separate floor vote on the chemical weapons Issue, but that was refused last week by the House Rules Com­mittee.

The Observer 
Paper: Sakharov's wife to be freed 
MOSCOW-Yelena Bonner, wife ofNobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei Sakharov, will be released from exile in the Soviet Union and allowed to go to the West for medical treat­ment, a Soviet journalist said yester­day. 
Ifthe report is true, it could signal ·a reversal of Kremlin policy toward Sakharov, the country's best known dissident, and his wife. 
The West German newspaper Bild reported Monday that Bonner, 60, would be allowed to leave the Soviet Union immediately. Soviet journalist Victor Louis, who has close ties with Soviet officials, said he believed the report was authentic and that the United States was her likely destina­tion. 
The Sakharovs were exiled to 

Gorky in 1980 and have been is­
olated there since last year, when 
Saakharovwent on a hunger strike to 
try and get permission for his wife to 
be treated abroad for eye and heart 
ailments. 
Bonner had been allowed to make trips to Moscow until last year when she reportedly was sentenced to five years exile on a charge of spreading anti-Soviet slander and was forced to remain in Gorky. 
In Newton, Mass., Bonner's son­in-law could not confirm the reports, but said, "If she is about to leave, I would expect this to happen today or tomorrow." 
Efrem Yankelevich, who is married to Bonner's _daughter, Tatiana, added that if Sakharov remained in Gorky, "as soon as she has finished medical treatment she will go back to him." 
Since Bonner was reported sen­tenced in August 1984, Louis has been almost the only source of in­formation about the Sakharovs. Louis has supplied media in the West with videotapes of the Sakharovs in Gorky. 
Asked about the West German newspaper's report, Louis said, "As far as I am concerned it is authentic, that she will be allowed to go, that it will not be a one-way ticket, that it is up to her when and where." 
Asked where Bonner might go, Louis said she may go to the United States, or to Italy, where she under­went treatment for glaucoma in 1975, 1977and 1979.

On land, up to 10 inches of rain had fallen over most of southern Louisiana over three days and Juan blew in flood tides of up to 1 0 feet, flooding communities lying outside levees that ring the cities. 
Louisiana Office for Emergency Preparedness operations officer 
D.C. Jensen said he believed more than 2,000 people had fled their homes. 
But many coastal roads were flooded as early as Saturday night and hundreds were stranded. 
At Lafitte, waterfloated coffins out of mausoleums, and a Morgan City shelter for evacuees had to be evacuated itself. 
An estimated 5,000 to 6,000 Mis­sissippians fled coastal lowlands yes­terdat officials said, and Gov. Bill Allin declared a state ofemergency. 
City, said the victims suffered bruises when they fell while rup­ning. little new damage to the build­ing was visible. 
The Sept. 19 earthquake, measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale, collapsed or severely damaged about 3-,000 buildings. It was followed the next day by a quake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale. 
Since then, dozens of lesser tremors have hit the capital without causing damage. Tuesday's tremor, stronger than most, registered at least 5.5. 
Mayor Ramon Aguirre, in the first ofwhat the government said will be a series of reports on the devasta­tion, said Monday night that 720,000 tons of rubble have been carted from the city so far. He said food has been provided to more than 50,000 homeless people still living in tem­porary shelters or camps. 
Many who escaped with only 
their lives last month also lost their 
jobs or were already unemployed. 
President Miguel de Ia Madrid has 
said the damage in September was so 
vast that it will take years for 
reconstruction to be completed. 
On Tuesday, lamps swayed and ceiling tiles fell in some already damaged buildings. Clouds of dusts billowed from ruins of the previous quakes. Debris fell in buildings hit earlier. 
The government news agency Notimex said the National Seis­mological Laboratory recorded the quake as registering 5.7 on the Rich­ter scale with its epicenter 235 miles west of the capital in the Pacific off ofMichoacan state. 
The U.S. geological Survey's Na­tional Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said the quake had a magnitude of 5.5.

as anybody ever gotten 
you so mad that you wanted to 
do something dirty to them? 
Haven't you ever wanted to see 
them in some trouble, with the 
police or campus security? 
Your day has come. 
This is the chance you've been 
waiting for. 
The United Way's annual cam­
paign to raise money at Notre 
Dame/Saint Mary's kicked off Mon· 
day and Its activities include a way 
to lock up your worst enemy, or 
best friend. 
Student government is sponsor­
ing the campaign, along with the 
Student Activities Board, class 
governments, Notre Dame Security, 
Alumni-Senior Club, and each 
dorm. It will run until Saturday. 
"This is an opponunity for stu· dents to contribute to the com­munity they live in," said Co-chairman Mike Huber. "This will be a focus for students." 
Organizer john Kunz describes this "Lock Up a Friend" as a fun time. "One person can pay S5 to arrest anyone on campus." Security wiU arrest your friend and "hold them in the 'drunk cell' at the bot· tom of the football stadium." The 'prisoner' can make as many phone calls as he wants to raise bail · anot· her S'5. 
The Lock Up runs from 7 to 9:30 p.m., "but if the prisoner hasn't found someone to post bail by 10," added Kunz, "the Security guard will let him out then." 
Lock Up a Friend began last night and will continue tonight, as well as next week on Wednesday and Thursday. Applications are now being distributed in the dorms and Lafonune Student Center and must be turned in at the Security office by 6 p.m. on the night ofthere­quested arrest. 

It was Director ofSecurity Rex Rakow who first suggested Lock Up to Student Body President Bill Healy. "Security has given us a lot of support, but we (student govern­ment) will run it," said Kunz. 
"We hope to get a snowballing effect and get the Lock Up going by Wednesday and Thursday ofnext

week. Those will be the big days," 
he added. 
Another captivating attraction planned for this week is the Hal­loween Horror Story Marathon, boasting such campus notables as Vice President for Student Affairs Father David Tyson, Executive Vice President Father William Beauc­hamp, and Vice President of Univer­s!ty Relations William Sexton. 
Domers will not, however, be hearing their president read any eerie phrases, as Father Hesburgh will be out oftown. 
Students are also invited to read provided horror stories for 20· minute time slots. All students who want to panicipate should sign up by Thursday with organizer Laurie Hellen. 
This event will be located in a tent in front ofSouth Dining Hall on Thursday from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. While "goblins" serve marshmal­lows and doughnuts, people can donate money or merely pledge their United Way contributions. 
Joy,ride through time 
Michele McKeever 
features writer 
T 
he National Theatre of the Deaf 
brought its innovative produc­
tion to Washington Hall last night 
with their performance oftwo short 
st.ories, Akutagawa's "In AGrove" 
and E.B. White's "Farewell, My 
Lovely." The most remarkable 
aspect of the performance lay in the 
blending ofsign language with the 
spoken word. These elements were 
brought out by a lively and 
animated cast who delighted the 
audience of nearly 200. 
The first piece performed by this renowned company was "In a Grove" which Akutagawa adapted from a traditionalJapanese folk tale. It is the story ofa murdctr which was shrouded In deception. The audience is presented with three conflicting testimonies, one ofthem from the victim himself, while the other two are from his wife and his murderer. Through this dramatic device the audience is appointed as both judge and jury in this thriller. 
This tale challenges one to look beyond the surface meaning ofthe dialogue and to determine the motivational forces which act on the characters. Akutagawa ponrays man as a victim ofpassion, as one driven by love, lust, hate, fear, and jealousy. On this tumultuous foundation men must build their lives, trying to deal with this am­biguity inherent in their existence. 

The second piece performed, "Farewell, My Lovely" is based on a shon story by America's beloved humorist E. B. White. This produc­tion takes a whimsical look at human nature while celebrating old time Americana. It is a joyful tribute to the old Ford Model T, the first mass-produced automobile in America, recapturing the spirit of freedom and elation which this new invention gave its proud owners. Of his salute to Americana White said that he intended "to revisit, to try old places and other times in the hope oftasting again the sweet sorrow ofparting." 
"To try old places and other times in the hope oftasting again the sweet sorrow of parting." 
The NTD company stresses that they are a Theatre ofthe Deaf, not for the deaf. The subject matter they deal with is as relevent as the style in which they convey it. Their audiences, made up predominantly ofhearing individuals, enjoy the speech and music as well as the stimulating visual effects, which of course include sign language. The National Theatre ofthe Deafoffers a rare and beautiful synthesis ofthe visual and literary arts. 
Another horrifying event for 
many, eliminations for the all-dorm 
Tug-of-War Tournament, begin 
Monday. Each dorm will needs 10 
representatives for its team in order 
to play. There will also be a qualify­
ing S20 fee. 

This will not be another Billy je;m King vs. Bobby Rigas show­down as men and women's dorms will not be competing against each other. The Friday finale will feature the best north and south quad teams pulling for trophies. 
Other "spirited" events in the 
United Way Campaign include 
door-to-door donations which 
ended today, a donation night at the 
Alumni-Senior Club, gift check 
sales, the showings ofthe movies 
"Hot Dog" and "From Russia With 
Love," and a senior class cocktail 
party. The final event is entitled 
"Dance Your Class Off." 
In conjunction with the cam­
paign, the Student Activities Board 
will be sponsoring the event 
everyone will want to attend -the 
Halloween Costume Party. For a Sl 
donation to United Way, students 
can not only party, they can also 
win a prize every 15 minutes. A 
grand prize will be awarded for the 
best costume. South Dining Hall 
will be spooked out Thursday night 
from 9:30 to 12:30. 
The SAB is also scheduling a Up 
Sync Contest tentatively set for the 
second week in November. Watch 
out Kevin Herbert, there could be 
another Bruce in the wings! 
By giving to the United Way, 
"you're helping your community,"

The "typical SMC Chic", we all know her very well. She is introduced to us during the first weeks of freshman year. I met her at my first SYR She was painted on the walls of the dorm, in cartoon form. I didn't really under­stand it at the time, but my date assured me .that it was just a joke. The "joke" explicitly stated that a Saint Mary's girl comes to Notre Dame to meet the "perfect" domer in order to marry him, and create the happy home for him the rest ofhis life. Although my 40-hours-per­week summers and the withdrawals from my father's savings account, would beg to differ: 
S40,000 is a lot to pay -even for the perfect domer; the stereotype survives, proving the "ring by spring" cliche is alive and well.

ask not 
Students all over the country meet their futul'e spouses during theircollege years. This is not unique to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. The assumption that a woman would spend four years ofher life just to obtain a husband is ridiculous. Therefore, we must realize that the sterotype is a joke. The problem on hand (not the left one mind you) is that many women react to these "jokes" inways that are going to hurt them more in the long run. 
I have sensed a growing attitude among women in the 1980s. This attitude isexpressed in classrooms, in movies, in advertising, in daily conversations. The attitude is similar to a chip on our shoulders, and we all know who

African government out of apartheid." The Board of Trustees must not have yet realized that talking to the So4th African· government hall not done, and will not do, any substantial good in abolishi,ng apartheid. Constructive engagement has only produced token reforms by the white power structure and no real movement toward the abolishment of"apar­theid. 
I wonder if the administration and .the Board watch the same news on South Africa as "I do. Ifthey do, they must wear rose colored glasses ·when they do. They see a move towards reform and the need for Notre Dame to keep its investments inSouth Africa to help 



Women of the 80's are putting limits on themselves 
gets weighed down by the chip. The Virginia Slims ad captures the attitude well: "You've come a long way baby," and you'd better not blow it. In other . words, if we exhibit any qualities labeled as "feminine," we are afraid we will lose the ground we have gained. We cannot be afra.id to show our feminine qualities. Well, in exaggerated efforts not to "blow it," in efforts to escape from the restric­tions of the past, women are coming dan­gerously close to restricting themselves; this time, we will not have the men to blame. 
In the past, roles were defined for won:.en, and very few dared to cross the line that society drew for them. As our great grandmot­hers will tell us, a women knew her place, it was in the home. In the home, a woman's creative, communicative and organizational skills were limited. Growth wasn't impossible, but it was limited. Society dictated that a "real woman" got married (22 was considered an old maid), raised a family and made her man happy. She could not expect to become as ed­ucated as a man, or dare to work outside the home. Not only did the "woman's place" stifle her potential, but the roles society defined for women were also confining. In the past, . an entire list of etiquettes defined interaction between men and women. Women were put on pedestals, and were expected to stay there. On these pedestals, women were treated like helpless, empty-headed species who were not capable ofparticipation in the "man's world." Through society's definitions of feminity, a woman's potential for internal and external growth was seldom realized. Women of the

the process along. I see riot police firing rub­ber bullets into a crowd ofmourners for anot­her victim of endless violence. I see police jumping out of boxes on a truck, a new twist to the "Trojan horse,'; and firing shotguns in­discriminately at a band of youths. They see reform and an eventu:il. end to apartheid. I see repression andstate sanctioned racisicm. I see Notre Dame giving consent and recognition to an oppressive regime through its invest­
ments in South Africa. 

Notre Dame prides itself in being a Catholic university and standing up for justice. But this must be pushed aside when money is some­how involved. Notre Dame's financial well­being takes priority over its moral obligation to condemn South Africa and break all ties with this nation. Instead of listening to their hearts, the administration and the Board listen to their collective wallets when the subject is South Africa. 
Many reasons are offered by University President Father Theodore Hesburgh for why Notre Dame should not divest from South Africa. He says that we will lose all our in­fluence over the South African government if we were to divest. Unfortunately Hesburgh, we have little if ;;.ny, influence over what the whites in South Africa will do concerning apartheid. I wonder if the administration is afraid to divest from South Africa, if they are afraid to take the lead in the fight against apar­theid by divesting. Notre Dame should show moral courage ~d fortitude by deciding that Notre Dame will no longer be associated with a nation that advocates raciscm and uses violence to hold the oppressed ofSouth Africa down. Columbia University has become the first major university to completely divest from South Africa. Notre Dame should be the next to do so. 
I have been appalled by the actions of Stu­dent Body President Bill Healy in regards to representing student interests on South Africa. He will not stand up to the administra­tion and tell them fiat out that the student body does not support the policy. But Healy has decided to weakly submit to the ad­ministration and dismissed those two, John Dettling and Pat Baccinari, who stood up to the administration and demanded to know the specifics of Notre Dame's investment policy. Healy is not willing, and far from able, to stand up for the interests ofthe students. 
I applaud the efforts of Professor Peter Walshe in the fight to have Notre Dame divest from South Africa. He is an eloquent and pas­sionate man who is not afraid to say what is true. He has more knowledge of the situation in South Africa and what should be done wi~h it than any in the administration or on the Board ofTrustees. 
The time is now to divest and move away from South Africa. Notre Dame must now ad­mit that constructive engagement has, and al­ways will be, useless in dismantling apartheid. IfNotre Dame continues to support apartheid through investment in South Africa, the Cat­holic reputation may be seriously damaged. The glow of the golden dome of Notre Dame tarnished by this support ofinjustice.

past were not challcpged to be all that they couldbe. 

So what did women do about it? In the 20th century, they got the vote, they entered the workforce and then they burned their bras. Hey, we got lucky. The women of our past opened many doors for us. But where they opened a heavy oak door, we are closing a steel one. 
In reaction to the fear ofsuffering the same limitations of our ancestors, women in the l980s are re-defining the terms offeminity. Ac­cording to many college women, it is only ac­ceptable to strive for a career. Homemaking is not a choice in this definition ofa career. We are telling ourselves that in order to obtain ourcareer, we must abandon the qualities that might be labeled as feminine. We must be ag­gressive, not meek; strong, not weak; indepen­dent, not dependent; unreachable, not vulnerable; logical, not emotional; insensitive, not sensitive. In fact, the closer a woman resembles the qualities once labeled "masculine," the more successful she can 
become. 

In the past, a woman was only successful if she had a family and managed to care for its every need. The new definition ofsuccess is a six letter word: "career." We are merely redefining our "place" once again. We have become intolerable of any woman who feels she could realize her potential in another area, such as caring for a home and children. Just because we fear the past, is not a reason to fit ourselves into another mold. By denying a woman or any human being the opportunity to realize their potential, whether it be in bas-

ketweaving, or in weight lifting, is to stick them into a limiting stereotype. 
 Women fought many years to escape the limiting, defined roles society dictated to them. Now we are replacing them with new ones. Women are so afraid of regressing, that they are losing sight of the original problem: escaping any restrictions which stifled our growth. Women today are redefining the chains of restriction, when they stress the ul­timate importance ofhavng acareer, beingag­gressive, assertive, professional and tough. The opportunities for women today are end­less, but the restrictions are coming from a source we never would have imagined. To do our ancestors proud, to finish their liberating efforts, the women in the 1980s must not confine themselves to any stifling definitions.

Hurley's parents thank community for support 
Dear Editor: 
So many times I have started this letter never satisfied with the way it comes togct· her. There are no eloquent ways to convey our appreciation for the response ofthe Notre Dame community to our recent family tragedy. Notre Dame is a very special com­munity. Together with people from Saint Mary's you have sustained us all through your presence, your prayers and your ever-vigilant sensitivity to our practical needs and emo­tional ups and downs. 
The selfless love and prayerful reaching-out we experienced seem unending and continue to touch us as even now letters, cards, and an­nouncements of events in Kevin's behalf reach us. lltcrc Is no question in our minds that Kevin Is able to continue his fight for recovery because of Divine intervention in response to the earnest prayers raised in his behalf. Although he remains comatose at this time, you would be proud of his apparent determination. 
His future is in the hands of Our Lord and we have long anxious months ahead as we endure the uncertainties of his progress and limitations. We are comforted by you all and pray that Kevin may someday return to Notre Dame as part ofGod's plan for him. 
Know that we regularly read your cards and letters over and over to Kevin. With all you wonderful people pulling for him, Kevin can only win. We all shall win as Christ is among us.

ND students should be tolerant of government 
lJear Editor: 
In student government, Bill Healy is my boss. More importantly, he is a close friend. AI: though these facts will make any opinion of mine quite biased, they also provide me a valuable Insight into the current situation as­king for a recall election. 
Impeachment ofa student official, just as of a government official, Is a serious accusation. 'lltus, it should be enacted only after careful consideration. Only three areas come to mind that, found lacking, could possible. warrant such a drastic measure: integrity, motivation and ability. 
After surviving the most scrutinized cam· paign without a blemish, Healy's integrity would seem to command great respect. His recent encounters with The Observer, the Student Senate, and the Anti-Apartheid Net· work illustrate his forthright nature that presents his position in very certain and honest terms. 
To find a more motivated person to accept the duties ofstudent body president would be a very difficult task. Healy spent both his sum­mer vacation and his October break working on student government affairs. He can be found in his office at least thirty hours a week. In addition, he spend~ countless hours away from the office performing his duties. Very few, if any, can boast of this dedication to any job, much less an unpaid one. 
I cannot attempt to list the accomplish­ments ofthe present administration. The high­lights, however, are obvious. The student support for the Hurley family was overwhelm­ing; student government accepted the role of organizing It to produce maximum benefit. The Board of Trustees is looking into a pos­sible overpass or underpass linking the Notre 
Dame and Saint Mary's campuses at the re· quest ofstudent government. A minority con­cerns committee is opening debate into how to best alleviate special problems faced gy minorities on campus. A student government leadership conference brought new insights into the role of student government on campus. The United Way fundralsing drive is underway at this very moment. Clearly, much has been accomplished already for this ad­ministration, especially when compared to previous ones. No reason exists to suggest that this active role will not continue. 
The integrity, motivation, and ability of Healy is unquestionable in my mind as well as in those of whom that know him well. Im­peachment docs not seem the best way to solve the turmoil that is involving many dif­ferent student activities this semester. Tolerance and cooperation would work much better than conflict and discord. 
Bob McNamara Executive Coordinator 

Support for petition urged by the organizers 
Dear Editor: 
On the last Wednesday before break, a group of concerned students gathered toget­her to discuss what could be done about the current shambles called student government. Specifically, they discussed how to jolt the leadership so that some new air could be blown into a seemingly stagnant room. They worked out a solution, and that evening spread out among other students on this campus. In less than I 8 hours they gathered over 600 students' names on a petition to recall the student body president and vice president. In terms of their goal, they reached the 50 percent mark in less than a day. 
At this critical moment, we continue our petition drive and encourage discussion ofthe issues involved in this recall. To those ends, a round-table discussion between Bill Healy, Duane Lawrence and other students has been conceived and arranged. That student discus­sion will convene Wednesday evening in Hayes-Healy. We urge all to attend. 
We feel the round-table will provide an ex­cellent opportunity for our efforts to be reaf­firmed. We favor the forum because it ·will provide Healy and his administration with an opportunity to demonstrate whether or not they are willing and capable to actively voice and channel students' outrage at the childish way we are treated at this University. 
We ask for your continued support if you have already offered it. We ask for your newly felt support if you care to give it. Thanks.

Idealists never learn from own past mistakes 
DearEditor: 
Idealists don't learn from their mistakes. Some clamor for Notre Dame to divest itself of South African holdings. They claim it will help the oppressed. Who are they kidding? 
My class at Notre Dame was very sup­portive of the downfall of the white minority Ian Smith government of Rhodesia. A few years later, a new group of Notre Dame stu­dents welcomed the "human rights" move­ment. The human righters aimed their big guns at the Shah ofIran. 
Now it appears that the idealists are working for the downfall of the South African government. Idealists don't learn from their mistakes.

University must define rules and punishments 
DearEdttor: 
As hopefully many of you have heard by now, there was a recent parietals violation in which both students were suspended from the University. The actions of the University regarding the severity of the punishment and the ambiguity ofdu Lac has raised many ques­tions which we, as students of Notre Dame, have a right to have answered. 
In this case, the couple was discovered by security shortly after 5 a.m. on a night in which parietals ended at 2 a.m. The first ques­tion raised here is the University's definition of"overnight parietals violation." DuLac only states that "Overnight parietal violations In· volve suspensions or dismissal... The vague­ness ofthis statement allows the University to define for itselfwhat is an overnight violation, something which should be clearly stated in du Lac to begin with. I mean, how many times have you heard of a student being dismissed for violating parietals by only 15 minutes? Where should the line to be drawn: 1 hour, 2 
hours, 6 hours? This ambiguity is not fair to the students nor to the committees reviewing such cases for disciplinary action. 
The next question which must be asked is necessity of the severe punishment received by the students. There was no moral issue in· volved in this case, which would appear to be one of the main reasons for dismissal for a parietals violation prescribed in du Lac. Did the University actually feel that the punish­ment was constructive for the individuals, for Notre Dame, for people viewing Notre Dame from the outside? Maybe the University has simply lost touch with what asuspensionfrom a university can mean. What can be more 
traumatic for a 18, 19 or 20-year-old than to 
be suspended from their university? The 
severity of the punishment, when weighed 
with the offense, seems so disproportionate 
that it must be questioned as a effective means 
ofpunishment for such an offense. 
We must also question the University's han­dling of the appeal by the students. When the Judicial Review Board recommended com­munity service after hearing the appeal, the University completely overruled the Board's recommendation and reinstated the original punishment. Does the University recognize the role of the Judicial Review Board? Cer­tainly a compromise could have been worked out which was both disciplinary and benefi­cial for all involved. 
Several things must be done to keep the ex· 
isting problems from getting any worse: 
 Du Lac must be revised. The ambiguity which resides in du Lac js not fair to the stu· dents who must live by its rules. Definitions of offenses must be dearly defined, as well as the punishments. A review of the punishments and their appropriateness to offenses com­mitted must be done to insure that punish· ments are both disciplinary and beneficial to those involved. 
 The University must recognize the Judicial Review Board and its function as an appeal route for students. While the University does not have to accept completely the recom· mendatlons of the Board, compromises in some situations are certainly appropriate. 
By answering these questions, the Univer· sity will tell the students whether it feels that the relationship which exists between the stu­dents and the University is a one way street, or ifit feels that we can work together to enforce rules which are both fair and clear to all who must live by them.

Impeachment of Healy based on irrationality 
vear Editor: 
It seems to me that everyone is jumping on 
the bandwagon to dump Bill Healy because of 
one issue: South Africa. I do not know much 
about Healy's actions on this issue, but I do 
know that it seems rather ridiculous that he 
should be so brutally attacked by a group of 
radicals because of this one issue. These 
people must be extremely bored, or they 
must realize that they cannot win against the 
administration on the South African issue, to 
make such a campaign against Healy. 
It just seems that they are searching for an 
issue, cannot find one, and decide to attack 
Healy for kicks. He seems to be a very hard 
working student body president, and he 
seems to dive in head first on tough issues. I 
am not saying his timing is great, only that he 
is trying to make a difference. I would rather 
have a controversial student body president, 
who is trying to get some things done than 
someone who sits back and does nothing. For 
instance, I think he is right about the Student 
Senate, and I think that most students would agree that the senate is a joke and should be eliminated. 
What I have to say to this group ofstudents who are trying to remove Healy from office is: why don't you find some way to make a positive change at this University like he has? You may call him all kinds of names in the newspaper and you may tell your friends ter­rible things about him, but have you really sat down and looked at what he has tried to ac­complish? Or are you too frustrated in your own inability and you need to pick on someone else to make yourself feel good? Think about it.

Cards' pitcher suspended by Ueberroth 
As11ociated Pre1111 

NEW YORK-Joaquin Andujar will miss the first 1 0 days of the 1986 season under a suspension imposed yesterday by Commissioner Peter Ueberroth for the Cardinal right­hander's outburst against an umpire in the seventh game of the World Series. 
"Such actions are damaging to the game and cannot be tolerated," Ueberroth said in announcing that he was fining Andujar the maximum $500. 
Andujar was ejected in the fifth in­ning of Sunday's game in Kansas City, won by the Royals 11-0, after he charged American League umpire Don Denkinger to argue over the ump's ball and strike calls.

Freshman Heck plays big role at end for ND 
ByJOHN COYLE 
Sports Writer 

Football coaches seldom expect a freshman to have a large impact on a college football team like Notre Dame. The pressure of Division t football, bigger and stronger players, and a new system to learn are all obstacles that a freshman must 
overcome. 

Therefore, it comes as a surprise to most when a largely unknown freshman like Andy Heck is able to adjust so quickly at the collegiate level to make an important contribu­tion to the recent victories of the Irish. . Notre Dame looked to be quite thin at the tight end position coming into this season since it had lost three of its tight ends from 1984 to graduation. Junior Tom Rehder was moved from defensive tackle to tight end last spring to help fill the void, and junior tight end Joel Williams returned to the position where he had seen a bit of action the year before. But offensive coach Mike Stock was still looking for some more help at the position when the players returned in August. 
Stock believed that the 6-6, 235· pound Heck had the talent to help the team immediately but he was not sure that the young freshman could make the quick transition to major college football. 
"He has good feet, good leaping ability, agility and size," says Stock. "Also, he has the flexibility to be both a receiver and a blocker. I felt

that if he could acclimate himself to 
the system, he would play. He came 
in and has reached beyond our ex­
pectations and has proven himselfto 
be a player." 
The Annandale, Va. resident saw 
only limited acton in the first few 
weeks of the season, but in the last 
two games he has seen considerable 
time as the backup tight end. 
Despite the large crowds and the 
pressure on the Irish to win, Heck 
says he is not nervous when he 
enters the game. 
"In high school I was nervous as hell, but in college it's so fun and ex­citing that I'm more relaxed and really c;:njoy it," says Heck. 
With more practice and game ex. perience, the talented freshman can only become more valuable to the Irish. Stock believes Heck is a quick learner, who is fitting in with the team extremely well. 
"It's only a matter of repitition," 
notes Stock, who is the offensive 
CO()rdinator of the Irish. "He needs 
to improve on his patterns, recog­
nizing coverages, and the blocking 
scheme. He's not a hollerer. He's a 
guy who plays with a fire inside. 
"Andy is somewhat in the back as far as leadership because he's only a ,freshman, but he's in the forefront in competition." 
Heck, meanwhile, has some definite goals for himself and the Notre Dame football team. The Sorin Hall resident has a strong desire to win and wants the Irish back in the major bowls, where he believes they belong. 
"When I walked into that locker room at halftime last Saturday, win­ning 27-0 over U.S.C., and saw those green jerseys, I said to myself, 'this is what it should be like,' says Heck. "This is what I expected when I came to Notre Dame." 
Ifyou are a fan ofthe Irish football 
team, you most certainly have to like 
the way this enthusiastic freshman 
tight end thinkS.

"Chapman basically led the way for kids to stay at Notre Dame," says Smith. "After dropping to club level, Brent was offered scholarships by four schools, but he felt strongly about what we were trying to ac­complish and stayed on." 
Chapman will play alongside of sophomore center Tom Mooney, who scored 19 goals last year. Senior right wing Jeff Badalich rounds out the first line.

The Irish also have experience

seman Bob Thebeau who chipped in 
last season with 19 goalsand 46 total 
points. 

"Bob Thebeau is the key to our defensive success," notes Smith. "He was injured during our trip to Alaska and missed two games. We felt the loss deeply. He's a hard worker and hard-nosed." 
Because of the injury, Thebeau's spot on the first defensive line will be taken by freshman Roy Bemiss who will skate alongside sophomore Mike McNeill. Senior Greg Duncan and sophomore Pat Foley comprise the second line, while sophomores Lance Patten and Frank O'Brien will be the third pair. 
The goaltending position, however, remains unsettled. junior Tim Lukenda (6-11-1, 6.22 goals against) and senior_Marc Guay (2-3­0 6.06) return to the nets, but Jeff Henderson, a transfer from Wiscon­sin, and freshman Mark O'Sullivan are challenging for playing time. 
"All of our goaltenders have worked hard, but none has stood out," comments Smith. "I hope that in the next few weeks the cream will rise to the top." 
This year's schedule is again strong, with home-and-home series with Kent State, Michigan-Dearborn, Alabama-Huntsville and Lake Forest. In addition, the Irish have a berth in the Syracuse Invitational after Christmas. 
"The schedule is outstanding," says Smith. "Everybody would like to play us. We tried to upgrade it from last year. We won't get 20 vic­tories without stepping on the ice. Every game will be a challenge." 
The teams the Irish will meet this year also reflect the philosophy of the Notre Dame hockey program, a balance between academics and ath­letics. 
"It's an excellent schedule for our type of program," notes Smith. "We have the advantage of athletics and academics. The best salesmen for our program are our alumni -both those who have had success in the pro ranks as well as the business schools. The alumni encourage the kids to come because of what they can gain from Notre Dame." 
This year Smith, who embarks upon his eighteenth season behind the boards for Notre Dame, will be aided in recruiting by new assistant coach Tom Carrol, a former assistant at Culver (Ind.) Military Academy. Aside from his recruiting duties, Car­rol will also coach the forwards. 
After an 0-4 road trip in,Alaska, a trip Smith said was a great ex­perience, the Irish open their home season this Friday and Saturday with a pair ofgames against Kent State.

It was not to be, however, for Saint Mary's as it fell to both Saint Francis College and Goshen College to place third in the district tourna­ment over October break.

Irish come home after splitting four out East 
By CHRIS STARKEY 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame field hockey team returns to action this afternoon as it hosts Valparaiso in a 4 p.m. con­test at Cartier Field. 
The game marks the team's first home appearance since Oct. 6 when it hosted Albion. Five away games later, the Irish find themselves with a respectable 9-6-2 record going into today's game, their final regular season contest. 
Head Coach Jill Lindenfeid is op­timistic about her team's chances against Valparaiso. 
"We beat them 9-0 in a scrimmage in September," she says. "Unless they've become incredibly better over the last two months, we should have pretty good success against them. 
"Also, we played the scrimmage on their field. This game is on Cartier Field, and they've never played on artificial turf. That should give us an advantage."

The Irish have had a busy week heading Into the Valparaiso game. An intense East coast trip over 
midsemester break ended in  two  
Notre  Dame  victories  and  two  
losses.  

The Irish started off with an im· presslve 3·1 win over a competitive Wooster team. In that game, junior Corinne DiGiacomo had all three Notre Dame goals. DiGiacomo, the team's leading scorer last year, drew words ofpraise from Lindenfeld. 
"Corinne really had a nice game," says the Irish coach. "I was quite pleased with her performance, and also with the two assists Mary Wag­ner had playing in a new position." 
Unfortunately for the Irish, however, any momentum gained in the win over Wooster did not carry over to the next game against a very strong Trenton State team. Notre Dame suffered a 3-0 loss in that con­test. 
Notre Dame was able to rebound from this loss, though, and squeak by Franklin & Marshall College, 1-0. Sophomore Benet DeBerry was responsible for the lone tally In that game. 
Finally, the Irish closed out the road trip at .500 when LaSalle regis­tered a 1·0 victory over the Irish.

the caliber of competition we've played, it really helped our play against Charlotte." 
The Irish soccer team has measured themselves against some of the toughest competition in the country, and it is obvious that this has lead to a great deal of learning and progressing for all involved. 
"We've played some good soccer against some great teams," said Grace. "The fans may not be happy with the record, but you can't fool the players. I have no second doubts about putting together the most dif­ficult schedule possible." 
On Wednesday, the Irish will be playing Valparaiso, and on Friday they will face Loyola (Ill.) in their final game of the season. As the schedule draws to a close, Grace says that he's optimistic about next season. 
"The team has made some strides this year and we'll try and continue this improvement next year. We're getting better and better".

ND has foundation to build for future 
ByDENNIS CORRIGAN 
Sports Writer 
Once again, the Notre Dame hockey team is facing a season of rebuilding. Fortunately, the Irish have an ex­perienced foundation tobuild on in their secondseason ofvarsity play after a year ofclub status. In addition, the team is bolstered by a good crop ofnewcomers. 
"We have to try and rebuild and make ourselves as strong as possible," says Head Coach Charles 'Lefty' Smith. "Our first batchofrecruits last year really gave us a shot in the arm. Tim Reilly and Brent Chapmangetting into the MBA program and coming out to play is also a shot in the arm. 
"We can improve over last year's record (11-16-1). I realize we've got quite a challenge. We're competing with teams that do award scholarships. I'm encouraged by our attitude, the number of kids that came out for practice and the work ethic they've shown."

Irish lose four games in Alaska over break 
ByBILL IRVIN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame hockey team "went north" over fall break as it traveled to Alaska for its first competition of the 1985-86 season. 
The scenery, however, proved to be more enjoyable than the hockey as the Irish dropped a pair of games, one to the University of Alaska-Anchorage and one to the University ofAlaska-Fairbanks. 
Notre Dame began the trip Monday night in Anchorage, with senior Marc Guay getting the starting bid in the nets. Although Guay gave up two early scores, the Irish received power-play goals from Tim Reilly and Tom Mooney to stay even at 2-2 after one period. Notre Dame then took a 3-2 lead at 2:53 ofthe second period when freshman Roy Bemiss scored the first goal of his Irish career. Mooney and winger Brent Chapman picked up assists on the go-ahead goal by Bemiss. 
The state of affairs deteriorated in the third period, however, as Anchorage popped in four unanswered goals to trounce the Irish, 6-3. In the final stanza, Notre Dame managed only five shots on goal while Anchorage
