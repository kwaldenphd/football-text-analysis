Architects in waiting 

Carl Wiggins sketches the layout site of an architec­tural site in the Northeast side of Chicago for a pro-

Gilligan named to O'Malley chair 
Special to The Observer 
John Gilligan, former governor of Ohio and the Thomas and Alber­ta White professor of law at Notre Dame, will leave the White Chair to become Francis J. O'Malley Pro­fessor and special assistant for public policy to Father Theodore Hesburgh, University president. He will also continue to teach in the Law School. 
The Francis J. O'Malley Univer­sity Chair, of which Gilligan will be the first occupant, was established last year by an anonymous donor to memorialize the English pro­fessor. O'Malley died in 1974 after 42 years at Notre Dame. Gilligan was at one time a student of O'Malley's. 
O'Malley specialized in the rela­tionship between religious belief and literary imagination. One of the requirements of the O'Malley Chair is that the occupant teach onerone class in the Freshman Writing Program each semester. Gilligan, who formerly taught English literature for five years at Cincinnati's Xavier University, will do so beginning next fall. 
Gilligan graduated from Notre Dame in 1942, and was awarded a Silver Star for gallantry during the battle of Okinawa while serving as a gunnery officer in the Navy dur­ing World War II. 
In 1947, he received a master's degree in English literature from the University of Cincinnati. 
Between 1953 and 1963 he was six times elected to the Cincinnati City Council and became national­ly known for his work in urban renewal and neighborhood organization. He was elected to the 
U.S. House of Representatives in 1964 and then to the Ohio gover­norship in 1970. 
Appointed a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in 1975, he was later that year named administrator of the Agency for International Develoment by President Carter. He was appointed to the Thomas 

OC, class officer candidates advance to runoffs today 
Runoff elections today will determine the sophomore and senior class officers and the off­campus commissioner. 
Richard Ruehlmann won the junior class presidency outright Monday with 52.9 percent of the 1 vote. Candidates must win more than 50 percent of the first vote to win the election without a runoff. 
Next year's seniors will choose between John Decker and Dean Chrsity for senior class president. Joining Decker on the "Mob" ticket are Jim Gibbons, Dave Minion and Brian Potasiewicz. Christy's runn­ing mates are Ward Fitzgerald, Pat­ty Cisle and Rich Irwin. 
Decker won Monday's preliminary election with 26 per­cent of the vote; Christy finished second with 24.4 percent. 
In the race for sophomore class president, James Domagalski will compete against Jeff Martello. Domagalski overwhelmingly won Monday's election with 39.1 per­cent in a nine-ticket race. Martello received 12.4 percent of the vote. 
Running with Domagalski are Anne Jennings, Mark Foley and David Miklos. Martello's running mates are Joan Harvath, John Libert and Angela Adams. 
Students living off-campus next year will choose between Doug Honeywell, who received 30.1 per­cent of the vote Monday, and Jim Hagan, who received 24.6 percent. 
Voting will take place during meal hours in the residence halls. Off-campus undergraduates can vote between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. in LaFortune Student Center.

ND officials bar rival CPA course from Morris Inn 
By TERRY BLAND 
News Staff 
OFFICIALS OF THE University forced Conviser-Miller's CPA review sessions off campus so the company's class could not compete directly with Notre Dame's own review course, according to Rick Duffy, an instructor with the Chicago-based firm. 
Duffy said Conviser· Miller reserved a room at the Morris Inn this semester under the name of Harcourt-Brace, the parent name of the firm. "We did reserve the room under the name of Harcourt­Brace," said Duffy, "but we did tell them that we were a CPA (Certified Public Accountant) review course." Duffy said Conviser-Miller reserv­ed a room at the Morris Inn this semester under the name of Harcourt-Brace, the parent com­pany of the firm. "We did reserve the room under the name of Harcourt-Brace," said Duffy, "but we did tell them that we were a CPA (Certified Public Accountant) review course." 
When Conviser-Miller arrived at the Morris Inn intending to get the . room for the review class, accor­ding to Duffy, a hotel employee told company officials "they were competing with another review course at the CCE and they could not have the room." 
"We thought this was pretty un­fair," said Duffy. "It was obviously an embarrasment to them." 
COnviser-Miller sent a letter in January to students taking the class informing them that the company "ran into some inconveniences" and could not hold the review class at the Morris Inn. The sessions were relocated to the Ramada Inn, 52890 U.S. 33 North. 
"They might not have had a writ­ten agreement to hold the class at the Morris Inn," said Laurel Seid, student representative for COnviser -Miller, "but they at least had aver­bal commitment." 
Assistant Director of the Center for Continuing Education, Peter Lombardo, who supervises the scheduling of classes and events in the Morris Inn, could not be reach­Qd for comment last night. 
Conviser-Miller then approached Susan Vance, a professor at Saint Mary's College, and wanted her to teach some of the sessions. Vance, however, received a letter from Notre Dame stating that she could not teach the review class or "her position would be in jeopardy." 
"The thing that struck me," said senior accounting major Oscar Osorio, "was that the pressure not

IBM grant slated for computer lab 
Special to The Observer 
Dr. David Cohn, a professor of electrical engineering at Notre Dame, will receive $500,000 in grants and equipment from IBM to attempt to design a new type of multicomputer system. 
The equipment, consisting of an IBM 4341 mainframe computer system and a dozen IBM PC-xt/370 desktop computers, is being used to establish an on-campus personal computer laboratory on the third floor of Fitzpatrick Hall 
Cohn is attempting to devise an operating system that will expand the uses of minicomputers in a multicomputer system. 
Operating systems are currently designed to maximize the data pro­cessing capabilities of a large, mainframe computer, according to Cohn. But Cohn hopes to design a "distributed operating system" that will distribute computing tasks between a network of minicom­puters. 
"We know that with today's elec­tronics, computing is most reasonably priced when done at the desk," Cohn said. "However, the price of storing information is most reasonable at a central location. What we want to do is look at the sharing of these functions to make effective use of the available com­puting resources, storage facilities and devices such as printers. With high-speed communications added to the systtm; this will become very efficient." 
Through future developments in software that will promote this "interoperative" concept, Cohn said mainframes will be used like diskdrives, providing information to desktop computers running smaller jobs. 
Work-stations are essentially the same as mainframes with one-tenth the computing power, Cohn said. "We often use the large computers to do many small jobs. Perhaps we should distribute these jobs to the work-stations and do the work more efficiently." 
If successful, Cohn's research will pave the way for new uses of desktop computers. Eventually, he said, the machines that make up a multicomputer system will have the capability to delegate jobs among themselves just as a group of workers decides upon the most capable individual for any given task. 
Cohn said the IBM PC-XT /370s being used in the lab are ideal tools see GRANT page 3

In Brief 
A woman student has lost $3,200 in federal aid for refusing to sign a "statement of compliance" with draft registra­tion. Melissa Barker, a sociology graduate student at the Universi­ty of Oregon, is challenging the federal regulation in court with two other women denied aid for the same reason. The Committee Against Registration and the Draft (CARD) is filing the suit against the Department of Education, which added the require­ment that females sign compliance forms as part of its implemen­tation of the Solomon Amendment. The Solomon Amendment re­quires males to register in order to receive financial aid. -The Observer 
The co-editor of a Harvard University 
magazine has been ordered off campus by college authorities, who discovered he was not enrolled at the school, according to the dean of students. The editor, Joe! I. Goodfader, 23, resigned Thursday from his position at the Harvard International Review, a foreign policy magazine published seven times a year, after a meeting with the dean of students, Archie E. Epps. Goodfader had been on the staff since the fall of 1982. Epps said that pretending to be a stu­dent is against Massachusettes law, and added that Goodfader "has committed a grievous act against the integrity of the universi­ty." Good fader, who says he is a graduate of Georgetown Univer­sity, said: "It's not a particularly spectacular story. I have nothing to add at this time to what has already been reported." Magazine staff members said they assumed Goodfader was a student when he joined the magazine in 1982. -AP 
A proposal to increase student activities fees by $Io to sponsor non-alcoholic events was discussed at the Hall President's Council meeting last night at Cavanaugh hall.

Gary Hart coasts to victory with 70 percent in Vermont 
Associated Press 
MONTPELIER, Vt. -Sen. Gary Hart, completing a remarkable sweep of northern New England, won a lopsided victory yesterday night in Vermont's Democratic presidential primary. He embraced in­dications of Republican crossover vote and said, "I in­tend to defeat Ronald Reagan." 
Walter Mondale lost for the third time in seven hor­rific days and looked South, saying, "New Hamp­shire, Maine has hurt. I assume Vermont will hurt." 
The victory gave Hart unmistakable momentum go­ing into delegate-rich elections next Tuesday in Massachusetts and the South. 
"If I were in the White House tonight, I would be very concerned about the Hart candidacy. He 

represents a far more significant threat to the presi­dent than does Walter Mondale," said Oliver Henkel, the winner's campaign manager. 
With 68 percent of Vermont's 264 precincts repor­ting, Hart had 27,068 votes, or 71 percent, to Moo­dale's 7,444 votes and 20 percent. 
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who had 3,190 for 8 per­cent, awaited the final returns with interest -without 10 percent of the vote he stood to lose federal mat­ching funds in 30 days. 
President Reagan had 16,055 votes in the un­contested GOP election. 
A CBS news poll indicated Hart drew support from voters under 30 years old by an 8-1 margin. He also was outdrawing Mondale among elderly voters by 2-1 and he won the union vote. 
Hart said he got support from Republicans and in­dependents as well as from Democrats, commenting, "This campaign does have a chance to reach out beyond the Democratic Pary, to expand the frontiers 
of our party and expand the electoral base of our par­ty." 
Vermont's open primary allows residents to vote in 
the primary of their choice, and history has shown 
that voters tend to go where the action is. In I 980, 62 
percent of the voters cast GOP ballots. This year the 
tally showed more than 65 percent of the voters cast 
Democratic ballots. 
Mondale, in Florida, said he would now focus on 
the South, adding, "We were really not contesting 
Vermont. We spent little or no money there...this 
was one we just couldn't afford to be in." 
The Mondale campaign, once confident here, was 
hoping for, but not predicting, a win. No delegates 
were at stake, but Mondale wanted to stem the 
momentum of Hart upsets in New Hampshire and 
Maine. Vermont party officials say those victories 
created a snowball effect in Hart's favor. 
Most Vermont communities turned town meetings 
into a showcase for the primary. In many, citizens 
also voted on local matters. 
Hart's state campaign coordinator was confidant, but stopped just short of predicting vict9ry~ while dissension erupted in the Mondale camp after one aide predicted defeat for the former vice president. 
Jackson once was expected to get much support he~e. but it seemed to wane when he stalled in New Hampshire and with Hart's surging candidacy. 
The civil rights leader faced a cash problem if he fell into single digits as in New Hampshire. Candidates getting under 10 percent in two successive primaries are cut off from the federal matching money unless they win more than 2 percent in a later primary. 
Reubin Askew, who withdrew from the race last week, was also on the Democratic ballot. Alone on the Republican ballot was President Reagan. 
Delegate selection will not begin until April 24, when towns hold caucuses to pick delegates at the state convention. Vermont sends I 7 delegates to the Democratic convention and 19 to the GOP conven­tion. 
The outcome here had been difficult to predict because no reliable polls were taken and because of an open primary system that allows Republicans to vote for Democratic candidates. 
Hart made a much stronger effort than Mondale to win the primary, which would add fuel to a caijlpaign that caught fire Feb. 28 in New Hampshire. He visited Vermont six times last summer, overshadowin¥ Moo­dale's two brief appearances. Mondale lined up early endorsements from the state's most prominent Democrats.

Miss Manners Letters to a lonely God 
When his promise to call 
On loyalty and fidelity 
rings false 
by Judith Martin 
Dear Miss Manners -What to do when a man I've been dating, says, "I'll call Wednesday to make plans for the weekend." This response after asking me if I'd like to go out Friday or Saturday. This said in the morning after an intimate evening that Tuesday, prior to Wednesday. 
Then -no call at all. A chance meeting on Friday evening. He said, "I was planning to call on Saturday." Then-after confronta­tion, adjustment, he asks me out for another Saturday; we have a lovely time. That Sunday morning he says he'll call later in the week. He doesn't. 
I do not ask that he tells me whether he'll call or not, yet it's a comfortable closure when leaving each other after an intimate evening. Yet this builds in expectations. I expect him to follow through. He doesn't. I get forlorn. 
How should a man and woman handle this moment? Is this man 
really just a creep and have I been giving him too much 
understanding? Is this his way of saying, "I don't care"? 
A clue to his behavior may lie in the fact that he is a lawyer. 
Gentle Reader -His profession has nothing to do with it. A lawyer should be more careful with his words and leery of making offers that are open to interpretation as promises. 
What we have here is a common misunderstanding based on gender. You are using the same words to mean different things. Think of it without rancor, if you can, as an accident caused by cultural confusion. 
Many ladies unfortunately use the term intimate in the sort of situation you describe to include a form, however loose, of emo­tional commitment. It is only unfortunate when the lady has set the terms of the relationship without that, and then expects it anyway. If this is a truly casual arrangement, then the gentleman does not have obligations of continuity. "I'll call you," is a way of seeming to appease this expectation without actually fulfilling it. The correct parting statement is, "What a memorable evening this was." 
But gentlemen also use the calling statement as a social conven­tion, not to be taken literally, rather in the category of, "See you." 
There are two ways to handle this. If the romance is truly casual, merely smile, agree and then don't save the date. If he docs call when he says, or even after, and cannot succeed in reaching you, he will eventually start using the term literally. 
Or, if you want to step things up a bit, say kindly, "No, you'd better not, I have a heavy schedule just now -suppose I call you when I'm free, say, about the following Wednesday?" Then don't call until a week after the designated day. Miss Manners promises you he will be anxious to hear from you.

The word "loyalty" seems more 
secular than the word "fidelity." A 
husband is faithful to his wife as a 
religious duty. A soldier is loyal to 
his country as a matter of 
patriotism; even pagans accept the 
duty of being patriotic. Loyalty 
looks like a more muscular word, 
different from the jargon preachers 
use in promoting their trade. 
"Loyalty" is something you could 
mention without embarrassment 
while having a drink at Harry's bar. 
Gallagher had suggested Harry's as a place to meet. We were sitting at a little round table, cheering ourselves up on Virgin Marys because it was too early for mixed drinks. It was a quiet bar, neutral ground where a lapsed Catholic could talk to a priest. Gallagher, coming to the rectory, might give me the idea he was looking for help. 
Gallagher said that he was the president of a company he would like to dump. He had four kids who had nothing in common. His pity for her was the glue that kept the marriage together. He was tired of living with a woman because he felt sorry for her. He was thinking of cutting out, disappearing, getting lost without a trace. He had given his family as much as he had to give. 
"Where would you go?'' I asked. I expected him to say he'd been looking at travel folders from Tahiti or Nice. He gave me a know­ing look that shocked me with its revelation of how tired he must have felt. 
"How long have you been think­ing this way?" I asked. 
"For years," he said. "I got the idea from my dad. He checked out the day after my brother's 21st bir­thday. He was 57 years old. He wasn't a patient man, but he waited until his kids were grown up. At least he had that much loyalty to his duties as a father." 
"Do you want me to argue with you?" I said. "Do you want me to try to talk you out of it?" 
"It wouldn't matter," he said. He was an executive, as impersonal as a board of directors deciding to close up a downtown store because business wasn't good. "I have this old habit of making sure an ac­count is closed." The account he was closing was with the Church. He was turning in his bankbook to me. He wasn't leaving me with a forwarding address. 

"How's tricks with you?" he ask­ed, grinning as a signal for me to relax, because the business part of the meeting was over. We would talk for a while, and have a few laughs, before saying good-bye. I wondered if he really expected so little of me. 
"I'm happy," I said. "I'm luckier than you because I'm happy." I said it emphatically to register my in­dignation with him and his father and the whole tribe that is tempted by terminal boredom. 
"C6ngratulations," he said, laughing, "What's your secret?" He probably thought I would give him some predictable answer, like 

. "God," Who, in this book, was not verifiable. 
"All my life," I said, "I have had something to be loyal to. Most hap­PY people have something they care about: their countries, their families, their jobs. They attend churches, or join lodges, or get jobs with foundations caring for the handicapped. Even the street peo­ple have pets." I was tempted to say: You schmuck, where are your loyalties if you care nothing about your wife, your four sons, or your job? 
I would not have brought up the 

· subject of God, if Gallagher had not mentioned God first. You either believe, or you don't believe, but I wasn't willing to hassle with him over faith in God. He insisted on knowing, so I told him. Lately, because I've been reading the B'ible with "Genesis" as the starting point, I've had the idea of "loyalty" on my mind. The Bible contains1the history of the idea of how persis­tent God is in making us His fami­ly. Yahweh is the paradigm of loyalty, aggressively pursuing man, in brutal sagas starring slain Philistines, until we are aware that he loves us. More than ever, I'm understanding the necessity of be­ing loyal to Him in return. Loyalty means that He is always on my side, and He surronds me with mer­cy and forgiveness; therefore, I will stick with Him trying to live up to our partnership, even when I feel wearied, discouraged, or bored. 
Gallagher's future is still in­definite. I tried to talk him into be­ing a caring person. He feels empty inside where his loyalties should be. It's hard to be happy when your heart is not attached to someone or something. Nothing cares for us unless we care for it first. The only expectation is God and our mothers . 



Attack of the pre-spring break bugs 
by Marc Ramirez 
features staff writer 
Ah, it's almost that time of 
year again. 
Almost, but not quite. 
Mid-semester break is less than two weeks away, and if you're not already jumping out of your socks in anticipation, then you're pro­bably a freshman. 
Think of it. Vacation. Home. Travel. Anywhere but here. 
It's all only a couple of weeks away, but unfortunately, between now and then you've got to grapple with a few bugs in the system. 
These bugs are vicious, and unless you're into syllabi and pay­ing attention and that sort of thing, they quietly creep up on you, trying to bite you before it's too late. The first, and least dangerous of these, is the Quiz. 
The Quiz (quizzus botherus) is nothing more than an annoyance, as long as you're aware of what's going on. It strikes according to the whims of its breeder and trainer, sometimes called a Teacher. 
The Teacher (pimpus instructus) itself is an amazing creature. Often operating under the guise of a wonderful human being, the Teacher trains and breeds up to nine or ten of these Quizzes, letting them loose one at a time, then evaluating the student on his or her response to these attacks. 
The Quiz, however, is nothing to worry about, being no more harmful than a common bee. Like the bee, though, it can be more than a nuisance when it attacks in large numbers. 
There may be cause for worry in the second type of academic bug. 1t goes by the name of Test. 
The Test (testus hurtus) is a pest that feeds on free time, boldly at­tacking entire groups of people at once. The Test does not discriminate according to religion, sex or race. It strikes according to the whims of the Teacher. 
Not surprisingly, Tests have been known to cause students much pain. Their background is also well-known -it evolves out of tex­tbooks and class notes onto paper, hoping to catch the student un­prepared. Those students who have prepared in advance will not have much difficulty in fending off the Test, but for those who haven't, the Test will prove quite painful in­deed. 
The next two weeks are prime feeding seasons for Tests, but even more so for the second type of bug to watch out for: the Exam. 
The Exam (examus destructus) attacks with less frequency than does the Test, but compensates for its relative inactivity with its size and effectiveness. Exams are also bred by Teachers, and occasionally whole groups of Teachers will band together to produce one of these monsters. 

The Exam has a voracious ap­petite, feeding on bodily energy and mental stability as well as on free time. It appears approximately three times per semester. Students who know will tell you that on oc­casion they have merely toyed with Tests, but that an Exam always puts up a good fight. Whole courses, entire semesters, even Cumulative Grade Point Averages have been sunk by the poisonous bite of a single Exam. 
In short, Exams are nothing to scoff at. 
But don't lose all hope. With careful and preventive preparation, disasters resulting from Quizzes, Tests and Exams can be avoided. 
But there are exceptions. 

That's right, just when you thought it was safe to go back into the classroom. And these excep­tions are right up there with killer bees, black widows, poisonous millepedes, and army ants. 
And they love to bite. 
Pimp questions. 
There are some things you just can't prepare for, and Pimp Ques­tions (Pimpus omigoddus), alias Trick Questions, are prime ex­amples. They come in all forms, and can strike anytime, anywhere. They are bred by psychopathic Teachers with morbid senses of humor and sadistic tendecies. And they can appear on Quizzes. They can appear on Tests. They can ap­pear on Exams. Anytime. Anywhere. 

True/False Example: 

Question: In Pimpson's book, he implies that mankind still has a long way to go in the quest for a fair test. 
Student's Answer: True. 

Teacher's Answer: False. Pimp­son did not imply that mankind has a long way to go. Rather he came right out and said it. 
Perhaps you are shuddering to think that a Pimp Question such as this really does exist. But some maniac Teachers will stop at nothing to create havoc for the stu­dent. Be wary of Teachers who tell you to finish reading the rest of the book and then blast you with a Quiz or a Test on the appendix. And watch out for Multiple Choice Pimp Questions.... 
Multiple Choice Example: 

Question: Samuel Gompers was: Choices: a)Head of the AFL; b)Head of the NFL; c)An im­migrant; d)Head of the USFL; e)a legend in his own time;f)A and B; g)B and C; h)A and C; i)A, B, and E; j)Both D and E; k)A, D and sometimes E; l)B and C but never D; m)E every once in a while; n)none of these; r)all of these. 
Pimp Questions are devastating, and when in groups form whole Pimp Quizzes, Pimp Tests, and Pimp Exams. And when this hap­pens you are helpless and left to the mercy of the Teacher. 

Eventually you may decide just to give up and forget every effort to be serious about Pimp Questions. When handed a Pimp Essay Ques­tion (a member of the Pimpae family) reading, "Discuss the history of Greece in three simple sentences," it would be understandable if you wrote, "I'm sorry. I don't think I can handle this. Have a nice day." 
There will come a time when you should realize that your mental health is more important than some insignificant grade, diploma, or career. So next time yon are handed a philosophy Pimp Essay Question that reads simply, "Why?" and is followed by five blank pages, turn to the last page and vengefully scribble "Why not?" 

It might even get you an "A" for originality.

THe fact that Notre Dame will not be participating in the NCAA's should take nothing away from the team's performances throughout the indoor season. Although Piane would like to be attending the meet, he feels that the weekend off will give his team the opportunity to begin preparations for the outdoor season, which begins March 31 with the Notre Dame Invitational.

Hockey team holds banquet 

By ED DOMANSKY 
Sports Writer 
In many respects the 1983-84 
hockey season brought about many 
unique experiences, especially since 
the team was participating on a 

club level instead of the familiar 
Division I varsity level 
All of that was put aside, 

however, last night at the annual 
awards banquet where the team, its 
coaches, and closest followers 
gathered to recognize distinguished 
players from the season and to ex­
press hopes for meeting the upcom­
ing challenge of participating as a 
varsity independent in 1984-85. 
Freshman goaltender Tim 

Lukenda took home the award as 
the team's Rookie of the Year. 
Sophomore Dave Waldbillig, play­
ing in his first full season, then 
grabbed two awards. He was 
honored as the team's Best Defen­
sive Forward and as The Most Im­
proved Player. 
Best Defenseman honors went to 

senior co-captain Joe Bowie. 
Senior Tony Bonadio received the 
award as Scholar-Athlete for his 
3.0 average in finance. The even­ing's most distinguished award, Most Valuable Player, was presented to senior Adam Parsons. 
Insisting that he didn't deserve it, 

sophomore Steve Whitmore was 
given the John Whitmer Award as 
the team's biggest complainer. 
The Garfield Award, which goes 

annually to the fattest team 
member, had two winners this year. 
Head coach Lefty Smith and senior 
Mike Metzler were its distinguished 
recipients. 
Co-captins for 1984-85 will be 


Bouts 
continuedfrom page 8 
Reilly scored the program's second TKO in his fight with Pat Bauer. They will fight Joe Beatty and Dan Watzke in the semifinals. 
In the 165 class, Ed Hughes and Ed Bulleit earned the right to face Two-time defending champ Perino and Larry Nardolillo, respectively, in the semifinals. Hughes had it easy, advancing because his oppo­nent was sick. Bulleit did not have such luck, as he had to survive a slugfest with Bill Butler. 
John Chiaro and Ken Munro earned their spots in the 175 semifinals in different ways also. Chiaro received a bye, while Munro had to hold off Alejandro Cano to win a split decision. They will now meet some very tough fighters in John Gurganus and defending champ Dave Packo. 
Jim Ackerson and Mike Con­ricode finished Sunday's program by advancing to the semifinals in the 185 class. Ackerson took a split decision from Tom Taylor, while Conricode won unanimously over Tim McDermott. They will face defending champ Mike Cray and Dennis Hill tonight. 
Also fighting tonight will by the heavyweights and super­heavyweights. Among the heavyweights, Larry Andreini will be squaring off AGAINST Kevin Oshea, while Byron Abraham will be meeting Jim Seith. The super­heavyweights will feature Joe Fazio against Marty Roddy and Pete Klebba against Chris Boerner. 
sophomore Bob Thebeau and pre­sent captain junior Brent Chap­man. 
Master of ceremonies and Blueline Club president, Dr. Steve Anderson, thanked the team for the entertainment it provided over the past year. He also acknowleged those who supported the team in various other ways during the season. 
Smith then addressed the matter involving the team's status for next year. 
"We're looking forward with great eagerness to next year," he said. "We were told at Christmas time that we could start schedulin"g as a varsity independent, but we weren't given confirmation until last Thursday when the Faculty Board (in control of Athletics) con­cluded its meetings." 
Next year's schedule will feature an eight-day trip to Alaska for games with the Universities of Alaska-Anchorage and Fairbanks. Games with Princeton, Yale, Air Force, and several of the varsity teams from this past season's schedule will further highlight the 1984-85 calendar.
