Station to submit report 

Fanuele plans to draft a report describing the reasons why WSND had decided to broadt·ast ho.:kcv. This report will be submitted to Fr. Theodore Hesburgh. Universit\ president; Fr. Edmund Joyce. Uni­versity executive vice-president and official station license-holder: Paczensv; Bro. John Benesh. direc­tor of student a~tivities. the Faculty Senate and the Hall President"s Council. (HPC). 
The report will be a "concrete 
statement as to the rights and 
freedoms" which student media 
are guaranteed in the du Lac 
student manual. Fanuele stated. 
"The issue is not so much what we 
cannot air hockev as it is that the 
administrations ·stepped into our 
programming.·· he said. 
""In the past. we have had the 
diversity to air hockey." Fanuele 
continued. ·'The decision which 
prohibits our doing so is in violation 
of the guidelines for the freedom of 
the student press stated in the 
duLac student manual. 
Fanuele stated WSND has re­
ceived letters both in support of 
and against the station· s view, but 
"we have been encouraged that the 
other media and students back us 
up. 
Fanuele quoted a letter written by Joyce in response to a letter of support for WSND from Pete Webber. ND alumnus. who origi­nated hockey coverage on WSND. "We shall sec what happens in regard to hockey broadcasting." Joyce stated. "I generally try not to get involved in decisions affect­ing the student radio station. It is good for them to work out their own problems." Joyce's letter was dated Oct. 4. three davs after Paczesny's decision against hockey broadcasts. 
Fanuele also quoted a Jetter from University Provost James T. Burtchaell to Paul Bollwerk. WSND station manager in 1974-75. According to Fanuele. the reply made references to the effet·t that programming on WSND was "not as excellent" as station WAUS at Andrews University in Barion Springs. Michigan. 
"Our problem is the money." Fanucle complained. "That station has paid staffs and full-time em­ployees. It is a fine arts station, but we are looking into the possibility that it is almost a professional station." 
"One stipulation we made about covering hockey this year was that we would not go into the hole," he continued. "We can cover awav football games on AM because the travel expenses are minimal. They are close, within driving range." 
Fanuele explained that the AM station does not have enough money to cover away hockey games, while the FM station does. 
These points will be included in Fanuele's report. which will be completed by the end of this semester. Fanuele hopes the report will enable WSND to broad­cast the hockey play-off games in March. 
Paczesny refused to comment or to be interviewed until the report is completed and submitted to him. 
Joyce, the official license-holder for the station, explained he was not t involved in the decision against hockey coverage. "It's a student thing and would fall under the Contlaaecl on paae 7

Keenan Revue to repeat 
by Pete Newell Staff Reporter 

The New Keenan Revue, which took place last Saturday, will be presented again on Friday, Nov. 12 at 8:30p.m. 
According to Keenan Hall Rector Fr. Richard Conyers, there are a variety of reasons for the second show. "First of all. many people within the hall missed the show because of the formals, the Mid· west Blues Festival and other evcn.t~ that took place last week­end. 
Conyers cited "popular de­mand" as another factor. "Many people came up to me this week and said,'we're sorry we missed the show,' or something of that na­ture." The second show will give the residents of Keenan and those others who were unable to attend another chance to witness a pro­duction with "much class and techni~al smoothness" according to Conyers. 
Keenan Hall also received a letter from the Dean of the Fresh· many Year of Studies Emil T. 
Hofman. In the letter, Hofman thanked the performers for "one of the most enjoyable evenings I've spent in my years at Notre Dame." 
student ingenuity and initiative take over." Finally, Hofman thanked Keenan Hall for the hospi­tality he and his wife received at the successful party which followed the revue. 
As a result of the positive response, the Keenan Hall Council asked the cast and stage ere"' members if they would put on the revue again. "Considering the large amount of time required to put on the show," Conyers stated, "we decided that it would be up to the members of the cast and crew to decide whether or not the show would be performed again. We also required that it be a unani· mous decision." Each member of the cast and stage crew voted for a second performance. 
According to Publicity Director Erin Dwyer, "approximately 900 to 1,000 people attended the first performance of the semi-formal revue." He added, "we're a little concerned that there won't be as much support as last week. However, I do believe the word has gotten aroun~ that this is a quality, class performance so there should be a large audience on hand." 
Both Conyers and Dwyer com­mended directors Tom Lenz and Rick Thomas, technical director, 
Bob Zajac and especially the performers and stage hands who worked on the show. The second performance of the First Annual New Keenan Revue will take place at Washington Hall on Friday, Nov. 12 at 8:30p.m.

SLC discusses cable television, town meeting, new committees 
byJoeGm StaH Reporter 

The acceptance of a cable televi­sion proposal that would provide educational as well as entertain­ment benefits, and the establish­ment of a town meeting for off-campus students were dis­cussed at the Student Life Council (SLC) meeting yesterday. 
The proposal, which would allow television to handle overflows of class sessions in adjoining rooms, enable the campus to "receive lectures and educational material from other college campuses,'·' provide a feasible way of displaying popular classes for purposes of auditing from one's room, and continue the development of Uni­versity studies in the field of Communication Arts and broad­casting was sent back to the Council for further study. The apporximate cost of such a system is between $750,000 and 1.000,000. 
The town meeting will be held Nov. 16at the firehouse, located at 801 Notre Dame Avenue, according to off-campus committee chairman John Steinham. "Members of the police force will speak about burg­laries and the prevention of 
crime." Steinham said. In addi-..~·~~·~~~ 
tion, information billboards will be set up at strategic locations · South Bend. 
In presenting the television pro­posal, Student Body President Mike Gassman commented on the

educational benefits that would be obtained, but also noted that students would be required to pay $20 to $30 each for the installment and maintenance of the system. Pete Haley, campus life committee chairman, however, questioned whether or not the money could be put to better use, asking. "How valuable is it for a million dollars, considering that one·could build a whole new student center for this amount?" 
Fr. James L. Shilts, assistant professor of physics and SLC committee member, agreed, saying that ''the overall cost is stagger­ing." and Dean of Students James Roemer said that he "would like to know a little bit more about it." The SLC agreed to study the proposal in greater depth. 
Haley announced the establish­ment of several ad hoc committees. 
The Club Sports Committee will study the intramural athletic pro­grams. particularly in the area of funding problems. The Social Space Committee will explore "opportunities where students and faculty have a common room where they can 'socialize," and the possi­bility of "using the North Dining Hall for activities.''

The Memorial Library Commit­tee will try and establish a common space to socialize in the Library. "The second floor lobby has be­come too disruptive and noisy for many students," Haley said. A Freedom of Speech Committee will explore underlying feelings of hos­tilities that are present on campus and haven't been recognized, and the "Committee to delineate re­sponsibility" will study ways to prevent the overlapping of respon­sibilities and also inform students who have ideas where to go with them and how to initiate their acceptance. 
The Hali Fellows Committee will continue its work. 
Brother Just Paczcsny prcsl·ntcd a proposal from the Rules and Regulations Committee which would allow the SLC to review the prepare reports of various sen·iccs on campus every five years. The 
proposal will  be  voted  on  during

SLF: Soph Lit Folly 
The Sophomore literary Festival may very well be a failure this year as a result of the lack-lustre appeal of its attending speakers. Whether its failure can be forecast or not, it is presently the target of considerable criticism both within and outside of Student Union for its failure to produce prominent writers as guests and its dependence this year on obsure international poets. 
Although the Sophomore literary Festi­val (SLF) is formally part of the Student Union structure, it operates mostly auton­omously from the SU hierarchy. This year, however, SU officials, among them its director Ken Ricci, have argued that the SLF consumes a disproportionate 20 percent of the annual budget in terms of other services offered, considering its limited appeal to students. Since the festival is entirely student-funded, Ricci has said, it should appeal to the varied interests of all students. 
SLF Chairman John 'Santos, however, has answered that the festival is entirely responsible to certain ethical principles: namely, that it should invite and entertain the most talented contemporary poets, novelists and playwrights, regardless of their widespread popularity or obscurity. He believes quite strongly that this years speakers are talented and points out that they are critically celebrated in interna­tional literary circles. The festival is disproportionately funded, he argues, because its revenue is not recovered through monies collected at the door. 
The clash between SU and the SLF has been a traditional one. It is complicated this year by the guest program which is generally perceived as a lack-lustre one, despite Santo's assertion to the contrary. 
The SLF ideally should offer something for everyone, as Ricci contends. It should include such guest speakers with the reknown and stature of Arthur Miller, Kurt Vonnegut~Jr., and Norman Mailer, all of whom have attended in the past. For those more familiar with lesser-known yet criti· cally-acclaimed writers, it should feature writers such as George Luis Borges (who attended last year.) Furthermore, an important function of the festival snould be to introduce the unknown talent who may lack popular exposure but who can nonetheless make a valuable contribution to the festival. 
This year's festival promises only the last. We are willing to believe that these 

writers (mostly poets) are as talented as 
Santos claims but we fear that general 
apathy over the event may cause many 
studentl' to sidestep the festival for the 
Mardi Gras events scheduled elsewhere on 
campus. Considering the awesome cost of 
the festival (about $12,000) and the 
idealism of its goals, the SLF would be 
deemed a failure if there were a poor 
student response. 
In fairness to Santos it should be added 
that he has invited some notable writers to 
attend, but they have either declined or 
have not answered his invitations. It is his 
dedication to securing the attendance of 
these writers that we question. 
As a student-sponsored ~vent, the SLF should at least be sensitive to widespread student interest in well-known authors by attempting a delicate balance bet ween the prominent and the lesser known guests, bet ween authors and poets and even between varied tastes of prose and poetry. Permitting one person to decide the guest list unfairly limits the scope of the festival. We are not saying that the structure of the festival be changed by placing it under the direct control of Student Union or any other body. But we strof\gly urge that the SLF chairman be responsive to the ideas of others and that the committee as a whole assume a-larger role in the decision-
making process. Presently, there are two more speaker selections to be made for the up-coming festival. It is expected that two more obsure writers HortenseCalisher and Lara Riding Jackson will fill them. Those selections, not yet final, should probably not be made before considering the opinions and interests of many students. 
The SLF Chairman, Santos, has told us "It's understandalbe that people don't recognize these names" and "its a sign that we're-not reading contemporary poetry.'' Our reply to this is that there are certainly more characters in the worU arena of writers than obsure poets. H we are not reading their obscure poetry, perhaps we should. But we should also be exposed to the writings and of popular and obsure novelists and playwrights. 
The Sophomore literary Festival is an internationally-respected event and its prestige should not be jeopardized by the individual and alienating preferences of any one person. like the root of the word "festival" suggests, it should be a feast offering something for every palate.

The Myth of Notre Dame 
_.._._._._.robert jacques 
Pervading Notre Dame is a myth which, like an essence to its object, is the essence of Notre Dame. The essence can be summed up suc­cinctly and precisely in the phrase, "the Catholic, familial communi­
... 

ty. Such a community is of diversified peoples, all acting to­gether in a unified group. The members are friendly, helpful, courteous, loving, considerate, humble, patient, tolerant, warm, hopeful. It provides shelter for the lost and uncertain as well as it provides a base for the bond and aspiring. It offers stimulation for the curious and tranquility for the reflective. It is, in actuality, a small cosmo~;. a world into itself. 
Such is what the myth of Notre Dame is. Such is what Notre Dame is not. 
Behind the facade of the loving, happy family lurks selfish small­mindedness, vicious back-stabbing childish power assertions, and ignorance. 

Consider the administration. It consists of such figures as Price, Director of the dining halls, who plays petty power politics with pig farmers; Roemer, Dean of Stu­dents, who photographs strippers and panty-raiders for future refer­ence, and raids rooms to tear down posters bearing obvious double­entendres; Paczesny, Vice Presi­dent for Student Affairs, who claims "I am student affairs," and states the Scholastic can criticize the administr~tion only as long as it is done in good taste and is humorous (Is the subject of any criticism ever truly humored?); Burtchaell, Provost, who thinks he has 8,000 children and who believ­es that "virtually all universities in Europe and Latin America" repud­iate "certainly all responsibility for the personal growth and integra­tion of the students,'' thus making Notre Dame the only concerned university left; Hesburgh, Presi­dent, ,. ho gets "grim and white­
faced "in the presence of jokes (What when confronted with reali­ties such as starvation, war, and ignorance?). 
These and others are the people who run the loving family in such a pyramidal fashion, stricter than most factories and more status-quo oriented, that the Provost felt moved to observe, "The students are guests." It becomes apparent that amidst the struggles for asser­tiveness and dominance and super­iohty, there can be no time for love and consideration and improve­ment outside of mere lipservice to the ideas. Such is the administra­tion. 

Con~ider .the .students. _Of geographical dt:verstty and upbrm­ging and of superior ability and knowledge, one would expect supe­rior human beings. But quite the contrary is true. What one finds is obnoxious, immature, naive, and socially impotent children running about, crying for a relevant identity. Most feelings are expressed in booze (or grass) which delivers one from the very intensity of the feeling besides creating innumera­ble pot-bellied disgraces to the species. The rest are poetically expressed in writing on tables, chairs, and bathroom walls. 
Knowledge is something regurgi­tated on paper; understanding is an unnecessary superfluity. Intel­lectual growth and gain are measur ed in grades; these grades are so lusted after by some that all else, even life itself, is sacrificed to them. Means become ends; growth is forgotten about. 
Saddest of all is the uninquisitive nature of the students. The opportunity to rigorously question all aspects of life and to seek out the truth is so neglected that the opportunity has all but vanished. Such a seeker is too often viewed as a skeptic, an agnostic, a cynic, if not an antichrist; these few people are forced to hide so as to protect their sensitivity. So well imbibed is the myth of Notre Dame that-not only is it not questioned, but it is enhanced and spread by these complacent sub-humans. Thus the myth perpetuates itself. Such are the students. . 
Consider the faculty. The members are intelligent, well versed, and dedicated to their studies and students. Yet they are not without fault. The promised brilliance is too often conspicuously missing in the classroom. Too often the difference between good and excellent appears during the semester. The responsibility lies with the size of the classes, the students, and the professors. All share the guilt. 
Change is needed. Yet most of the faculty cowers beneath the tyranny of the administration; 
even collectively. the Faculty Sen­ate is a mere shadow of a body. Apparently for fear of job, advance­ment, and treatment, individuals and groups refuse to stand up for, what they believe. Such a position as they hold is unenviable, but equally unsatisfactory. Knowing that change won't come from above, it must begin here. Revolution is neither imminent nor eminent, but change is needed. It must start with the wise and ma"\ure. Such is the faculty. 
The Notre Dame of myth and the Notre Dame of reality can thus be seen to be quite different if not mutually exclusive of one another. Although most will agree that the one is more desirable than the other, even that is not of para­mount concern. Rather, it is one of when the University will cease being a hypocrite; being one thing and claiming to be another. If Notre Dame is ever to be a ;ommunity of loving, considerate people in pursuit of the truth, the truth of itself must first be known. Then it must choose -either to accept itself for what it now is or to change to equal or excede the lofty myth. 
Regardless, the dissemblence must end. I ask, when will the fraudulence and deception perpet­uated by the members of Notre Dame cease? 
Or in my asking am I asking too 
much?

'Thanks' 
Dear Editor: In last Thursday's Observer (Oct. 
28) there was some talk of review­
ing  the  infirmary  in  respect  to  
reform.  I  believe  Sr.  Marion  
Ruidl's  points  on  visitation  are  

sound in nature and protect the students, both those in and out of the infirmary. In regard to medical excuses from class, it appears as though the inf!!:mary has little control over the issue. 
Respecting Mike Gassman's con­cern for progressive reform, I also favor giving credit when and where it's due. Please allow me to relate a timely event. 
Recently, I visited the campus infirmary for a couple of days, ' thanks" to a viral infection. In consideration of those warm, friendly, and helpful employees I came in contact with, not only is it a nice place to visit, but you would alm)st be tempted to live there!

Tacky'n Cheap 

by Anna Monardo 

fhe Ritz 
Directed by: Richard Lester 
Starring: Jack Weston, Kaye Ballard, 
Jerry Stiller 
The Ritz begins poignantly and dramati­cally with a big Italian Family holding vigil at the death bed of their sick Papa. With his last bit of energy, Papa summons his loved ones to his side; the rosary beads are dropped and the family rushes to the old man only to hear his dying words, "Kill Procol. Kill Procol." the husband of Papa's only daughter, Vivian. So Papa's ~nly son, Carmine, Vespucci (his name indicative of all the underworld tendencies in his character), assumes responsibility for eliminating Procol, the husband of Papa's only daughter, Vivian. 
. At t~is point .the movie makes a huge dtgresswn; nothmg after this makes much sense. But if you like to laugh, and are not too selective about the things which humor you, The Ritz may even prove tolerable. 
The movie is disappointing, even in its title. The Ritz is not about the goings-on at an elegant high-rise hotel. In this case, the Ritz is an exclusive men's bathhouse, exclusive in that all the guests are gay. Procol goes to the Ritz to remain anono­mously secluded from his brother's hit men. 
Upon registering, Procol (Jack Weston) is unaware of the contingencies of the place; he learns fast, however. A little guy with a briefcase, Claude the Chubby Chaser, quickly tries luring Procol with candy bars thrown through the transom and eclairs served by candlelight. 
A lot of people chase Procol, but Chubby Chaser is the only one who wants the real Procol. The rest pursue him because of mistaken identity. There is Brick, the private detective, who becomes Procol's co-conspirator, despite the fact that he has been hired by Vespucci to spy on Procol. Poor Brick--a handsome young man whose voice never made it past adolescence-he is funny but that voice just grinds the nerves. 
The staff of the Ritz includes Googie (Rita Moreno), singer, dancer, bombshell in search of a career (Why does she work in a gay bath house?) who believes that Procol is the great producer who will make her famous. 
The action is a bizarre conglomeration of chase scenes through the steam bath, 1 escapes down the laundry chute, and escapades in the swimming pool. The slapstick reacHes a climax at the end when Vespucci (Jerry Stiller) registers as a guest. He walks around with a pistol strapped to his chest, trying unconspicu­ously to kill his brother-in-law. To top it off, Vivian (Kay Ballard), arrives in disguise to save her husband. 
After everyone who possibly can has gotten involved in the mess, there is a confrontation. The scoop comes out: Vespucci, in fact, owns the bathhouse. He is trying to set Procol up in "an unnatural act with one of the fruitcakes in this place'' so that his murder of Procol, which was meant to keep Procol out of the family's garbage business, could be justified as a "delitto di passione"--a crime of passion meant to protect Vivian. It doesn't work; Procol emerges victorious, returns to Cleveland with his wife, and life at the Ritz goes back to normal... 
And that just about sums it up. The movie is redeemed a bit by some of the acting--KayeBallard and Jack Weston are true comedians. All that needs to be said now is that The Ritz is· technically a rather cheap film and it~> subject matter, well, that's cheap too and a little tacky as well,

Aspect of Realism 
Three years ago the directors of the Art Gallery in O'Shaughnessy Hall decided to put together an art show based on a specific theme: the various aspects of Realism with an emphasis on Photographic Realism and its use in contemporary art. The directors' work, planning and coordi­nating have lead to a surprising and intriguing show that opened this week titled Aspects of Realism. 
Photographic Realism, which is incor­porated into many works in the collection, deals with the tendency in art to paint or draw things as they are and as they appear in photographs. 
The works in the show take on many attitudes. but are unified by the idea of painting with images that are either remotely or directly based on a specific photograph. The photographic images are used as stepping stones to achieve a great degree of intimacy and vitality in the works. 
The artists translate the images into acrylic on canvas, watercolor and graphite on paper, or wooden sculpture. Also notable is the use of the airbrush, an instrument that sprays a fine mist of paint over the canvas. This technique, used extensively in the show, softens the edges and suggests a more photographic surface quality. 
The show explores the depth and variety of attitudes within the field of Realism Each artist, by using the photograph as a 
by Maureen Sajbel 
tool, arrives at an individulil interpretation of the image and its essential nature. 
Joseph Raffael, author of the poem above, paints in an attitude peripherally related to Realism that incorporates a light, impressionistic quality, as in his Muir 
Creek D. He paints the reflections in the 
ripples of water to look like an intricate 
stained glass window. 
Mark Christian Wethli's realism in the work Paris is stated with an air of stark desolation. The picture is done in soft tones of grey, evoking a loneliness felt in an empty room during the late afternoon. 
The hard-boiled realism of Ben Schonzeit is shown dramatically in But­tons, a photographic blow-up-like painting. 
Another Schonzeit painting, Gold Mine. is technically flawless in reproducing the original photograph on a monumental scale. 
Many of these artists are young and their work represents what has been going on in the field of Realism withing the last eight years. Their works are fresh, technically outstanding, and startling at times because of their absolute accuracy. 
The art gallery is located in O'Shaugh­nessy Hall at Notre Dame. No admission is 
charged  and  the  gallery  is  open  on  
weekdays from 10 a.m.  to 4:45-p.m ..  on  
weekends from 1 p.m.  to 5 p.m.  and  on  

Thursday nights from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. The· Aspects of Realism show, which opened November 7, will continue until Janu.try 2.

Trashy Do'ins 
' 

by David O'Keefe 

Larrie Directed by Brian DePalma Stars: Sissie Spacek, Piper Laurie, William Katt, AmJ Irving 
The opening should have been a 
warning. In it we meet Carrie White. a 
seemingly innocent introvert who j, de­
tested and abu!-.ed by her adolescent pl'l'r!o,. 
While taking a shower after g\'m cia,~. !o,hl' 
begins to menstruate. Obvio~sl\' unaware 
of what is happening to her. sh~ becomes 
hysterical and screams to her clas!'.matc~ 
for help. They respond by pelting her with 
tampons. chanting and jeering. until she 
collapses, sobbing uncontrollably. in the 
corner of the shower. 
As the film progresses. we discover 
more about Carrie. Her sexual ignorance is 
only one manifestation of the effect that 
her mother, a psychotic religious zealot. 
has on her. When the charming Mrs . 
Whit~ hears of her daughter's frightening 
expenence at school. she locks Carrie up in 
a closet to beg God's forgiveness for the 
sins that have led him to visit her with the 
curse' of blood. 
But Carrie is far from being the 
defenseless child she appears to be. for she 
possesses the power of telekinesis, the 
ability to energize inanimate obJects and 
make them perform her will. As she 
develops this power, she graduates from 
the simpler tricks to more involved and 
impressive feats that will come in handy 
later. · 
Her t,'rmentors are punished for treating her as cruelly as they did, which only makes them more resentful of her. In an inspired bit of adolescent humanity. they persuade the handsome star athlete to asi her to the Senior Prom so that they may manipulate her election as Queen only to humiliate her at her moment of glory. All goes smoothly for the dear things and their little prank is a tremendous success: Carrie is basking. disbelieving, in the spotlight onstage when she is deluged by a bucket of pig's blood from above. 
There is more. including the predictable telekenetic slaughter that follows which wipes out the entire senior class and half the faculty of Bates High School, but it is all just as depraved and senseless as the rest. 
What it all adds up to is one of the most repulsive pieces of bloody fi.lth to splatter is guts on the screen in a long time. It is a confused and meaningless film whose feeble implicit claims-to some sort of allegorical profundity are drowned in a flood of blood and incinerated in fiery explosions. Its excesses leave the audience shocked and emotionally numb. save the anger that arises out of having spent time and money on such rot. 
Cll!rie has one lucid moment, at the prom. when Carrie's date begins to react to her honestly and emotionally. Their waltz is as tender and poignant a~ any romantil· moment in film, but in the end ·it is but a diamond under a dunghill, buried and forgotten. There are also some truly fine perf~rmances by a great screen vet (Piper Laur1e as Mrs. White}. a brilliant new­comer (William Katt as Carrie's date). and a young actress whose considerable talents ha.ve.been consistently stifled by poor roles (Stsst.e Spacek as Carrie). Spacek is t.he emotwnless mute once again. a role she handled so very well in the otherwise menial Badlands. She deserves much more than this film offers. 
Will success spoil Brian DePalma? The 
!ur~ . is ~ti!l out o~ this powerfully mdJVtduahsttc young d1rector. The thing that . makes Carrie so disconcerting is the 
knowledge that DePalma can do so much better, as was most recently evidenced by his masterful Obsession. Hopefully, he w,ll be able to wash his hands of this filthy deed and go on to bigger and inevitably better things. · the observer Wednesday, November 10, 197&

lower drinking age at Kalamazoo's W in<Js Stadium are now on sale at the River City Review 
by Michael Lewis Staff Reporter 
Lobbyists from Notre Dame will soon be contacting Indiana state legislators to work for passage of a bill lowering the drinking age to 19, according to Buzz Reynolds, assis­tant head of the Notre Dame stud_ent lobby. 
The lobbyists will be sending letters to all legislators. The letters will include facts, statistics and argl\ments supporting the bill. 
Speaking of this year's effort, Reynolds said, "We're optimistic ­we have to be." 
''There are many legislative hurdles to overcome, but hopefully, with a little more preparation, better arguments and the new makeup of the legislature, some­thing can be done," he added. 
Last year, the lobby killed the bill because they did not have the necessary votes. This kept the bill alive for the January session of the General Assembly, and the lobby­ists have been working all summer in the hope of receiving a favorable vote in the January session. 
Reynolds said the lobbyists will be working for a "large, bipartisan sponsorship" for this year's bill. Reynolds also said that the Notre Dame lobby will join forces with the Indiana Student Association and many other student leaders from all over the state. 

The arguments for passage of the bill deal with the inconsistency of Indiana law and conflicts with Indiana's border states. 
Concerning the inconsistency. Reynolds said, "In Indiana a 19 year old can legally vote, pay taxes, marry, choose a profession, enter the armed services, possess a firearm. be held responsible for debts, make wills, be tried in a civil or criminal court and sentenced to a penitentiary, hold office, own a corporation and hold a liquor license. 
"In Indiana a 19 year old can do everything but take a drink." 
Additionally, Michigan, Illinois and Ohio all have lower legal drinking ages than Indiana. Of course, many Indiana youths travel to these states to purchase liquor. 
Notre Dame lobbyists will be requesting the help of some stu­dents as Thanksgiving break nears. 
At that time, all students who reside in Indiana will receive a letter asking them to contact their legislator in an attempt to gain early support for the bill. 
The letter will include the legis­lator's name, how to reach him, and all the information he should know about lowering the drinking age to 19.

The situation will probably be discussed at a meeting of student media officials with members of the University Board of Trustees this Saturday, Nov. 13, according to Mary Ellen Keenan, WSND news director. 
The meeting, which was arranged at the beginning of the semester before the WSND contro­versy began, will, cover several topics, including the student inedia "as an educational and profession­al vehicle." It would be under this heading that the issue would arise. 

"We won 't make any sugges­tions," Keena:n said, "We just want to make them aware of the situation. It is a concern all three (student media) share. It is not a personal gripe. It affects all of us," she stated. 
Trustees will meet with Keenan, Tom O'Neil, Observer editor-in­chief, and John Phelan, Scholastic editor. They ~ill include John Schneider, president of CBS, Alfred C. Stepan, Jr., Chairman of the Board and Jane C. Pfeifer, vice-president of communication, of IBM. 
''The main thing we would like to come out of this," Keenan conclu­ded, "is that the Trustees are a\Yare ~f the 'situation." .

Wohlhuter discusses ND,Oiympics 
Last night, Notre Dame graduate and Olympic bronze medal winner RickWohlhutcrspokc with Observer -.porh writer Gregory Solman. 
Obsencr: How docs it feel to return to vour alma mater an Ol_vmpic Bn;nzc medalist. and what dwnges have you noticed on your 
return? 
Wohlhuter: I don't think the university has changed that much ~inn: I graduated --of course, l'\er~· graduate likes to think that the university hasn't changed since thn lived there. Of course, the 
advent of girls has changed things considerably. Obsencr: . How would ~-ou sum­marit.e the hendits of your Notre 
Dame eduvation'! Wohlhuter: I think that Notre Dame is a \'LTV uni4ue institution, and you probably appreciate it a little hit nHll'l' after vou\·l' been out of it for a fc\\ vears: You look back and rcalit.l' that the times were more simple when ~·ou were in vollegc. The univcrsit~· has a good 

reputation and a good alumni association. This does help me to a certain extent in my business. Observer: Was it very frustrating for you to have excelled at a sport and have it overshadowed by the football image? Wohlhuter: I realized that being overshadowed by the football team would be part of it, but I knew that there were other things to gain from Notre Dame besides having good seats at a good football game. I knew the school offered much 
more than that and that's what I look toward. Observer: Do you think Notre 
Dame will ever become a national track and field power? Wohlhuter: I don't think Notre Dame will ever become a national track and field power as far as the team is concerned. You may have certain individuals on the team that might excel!. Observer: How did it feel to work nine to live every day and then prepare for the Olympics knowing that in other places in the world 
Ray O'Brien 

Wake up the echos ... 


It st·.ms that latl'lv Notre Dame football has not been living up to its tradi.llln. l'rilll' to last vcar Notre Dame had not lost more than two games dtt! tng the regular ';l'a..,on in II straight years. In this span the Irish were ranked in the top 10 nine times (the other two years they were ranked thirtl'L·nth and fourtl'enthl and clinched two national championship~. These team.., boa~tcd 42 All-American candidates, including a Hcisman ·1 ropll\ \\·innn. 
Ma\hl' it i~ not fair tol·ompare today's team with those of yesteryear. Times han· changed andl tradition sometimes gets lost in passing. The college game and the rules arc not what they u~cd to he. The NCAA has L'Ut the edge.., on big time football. Spending must he cut down and this ha~ alltm ed motT sdwot... to gl't their share of the top football player~ making the college game more competitive. Perhaps some of those planT.., would have gone to Notre Dame. Maybe that b why the Irish have ..,Jumped. It seems that if you don't break these new recruiting rules you can't form a nationalchampion~hip team. 
This is giving up too easily, crying that "the good guys can't win." ~llll'l' Notre Dame is a "good guy" their chances for another national ,·ontender arc slim or next to none. I don't accept this because Notre Dame is still one of the most respected football powerhouses in the country and the publicity they get is second to none. Fifty-three of the members of this year's squad recieved some type of All-American recognition in their hi~:IL school years. This proves th~ talent is definitely there. 
Maybe the reason that these players don't perform as well as they used to is because schoolwork is so demanding. A pia) er cannot major in phv~iral education at Notre Dame as many pi 1yers do at other universities. However, when one looks at the record books he finds that Ioplayers of the teams in that previous eleven year ~pan were Academic All-Americans. So it can be done. 
Notre Dame's football reputation was founded by Knute Rockne, carried on by Frank Leahy and resurrected by Ara Parseghian. People like Gipp. Sitko, Scwartz, Bertelli, Lujack, Hart, Lattner. Hornung. Huarte, Lynch, Page. Hardy. McCoy, DiNardo, Patulski. Casper. Niehaus and many more each added their two cents to Notre Dame's million dollar name. 
Perhaps it is unfair to compare today's players and coaches to these legends. But why shouldn't we if the.>e players are going ot grab the limelight and live off the reputations others have made. Notre Dame's reputation is hurting them because they hold onto it but fail to live up to it. 
The Irish have been playing more like the "Defensive Irish" then the Fighting lrish.Thc team is simply not sharp and cannot seem to get up for ever~ game. Do they assume that since they are Notre Dame they're going to win'! t may be painful but look at the last three games. Notre 
Dame grabbed a 4uick lead against South Carolin in he first half and then ... a. on it. Gamecock coach Jim Carlen commented, "\fter ovenoming the ncn ousness of playing Notre Dame, we played a sL·ong second half." 
T'1c same dull play continued into t.he game agains: Navy. The Middies got l'syched for a game against a legendary football power and found the' Irish clawing for their li' es. A defens ~ that had S( t a school record for kLTping teams out of th?ir end zone I >oked like S'<iss Cheese the way aerials went through the secondary. 
,\nd then the inevitable came. Yello·.vjacket ccach Peppu Rodgers aroU'-L'd his team for an unmotivated Iri ;h squad md put Notre Dame awa' with little trouble in the second half. "They pi: yed a perfect garr.e," ,·om.mcnted Coach Dan Devine. But the uismal pia) of the Irish had a lot t<l do with Georgia Tech's perfection. The Irish defense proved they could be a-; inept against the run as they were against the pass. There is no excuse for one of the best rushing defenses in the cc·untry to crumble tha: way. Beating the Icge1dary Notre Dame team "made our season," is the wav Rodgers described the victory. 
It is time for the Irish to wake up and realize the potential they have. All this worrying may seem premature with only two losses showing, but the
 season could easily end with a 7-4 (6-5?) record with two of the last three games being against teams ranked in the top ten in the country. 
Notre Dame must work to keep their spot as one of the top schools in the country. Regardless of what the oddsmakers say, the name Notre Dame will not always speak for itself If there is time to recover, that time is now. The Irish can prove themselves against Alabama and get a post
... season bowl bid. It probably won't be Sugar or Cotton Bowls, but the Irish should take what they earn and expect no more. If the players, coaches and backers cannot achieve this excellence, they should stop getting the first class treatment they enjoy and expect from people that expect the quality of performance that comes with the name Notre Dame. 
there were athletes in a situation where training was their job? Wohlhuter: Well, that's just the way things are. Even some athletes in this country don't work during the day. Most of those, of course, are in college or are attending some school on a scho­larship. But after you graduate from school. you have to start paying your own way, and if you want to throw in little endeavors like training for an Olympic game, you just have to add that to your program and try to keep it as organized as possible. I think it is a worthwhile effort, and I put a lot of time and effort into it. I have no regrets over the last few years that I have been running at the interna­tional level. Observer: Would you consider your greatest athletic achievement your Olympic gold medal or your world record half mile? Wohlhuter: I suppose I would say mv world record means a bit more to-me. I worked hard, and it was an achievement that wasn't as plan­ned running in the Olympic games. It was more of a happening, yet it was a natural consequence of all the training and efforts I put into it. Observer: Do you have any ideas for a reform of the Olympics? Wohihuter: I think that any reform has to take place here in the United States' amateur athletic program before we start worrying about the structure of the whole Olympic games. The Olympic gam~s are very large and commercial but I think there is so much money, ideas and revenue exchanged tht the games are good in themselves. 
They have become polluted with political elements and that has hurt the games. but I guess that is true with most anything as large as that. Observer: Do you think that the process of selection of Olympic runners needs reform? Wohlhuter: Presently we have a kind of cut-throat, one-shot affair in making the Olympic team. It is not always the best runners that make 
Lacrosse team loses finale 

The Notre Dame Lacrosse Club finished their fall season on a losing note Sunday, as they were defeated by the Chicago Lacrosse Club, 9-8. 
The Irish controlled the game for three quarters but finally fell to the adroit stickhandling ability of an older Chicago team. Midfielder John Gray and attackman Tom Bingle paced the Irish offense as each scored two goals. Rounding out the Irish attack were single tallies by Club President Jay Williams, co-captain Bobby Dris­coll, and attackmen Jaimie Joyce 
and  Pat  Clynes.  In  goal,  Rich  
Mazzei  once  again  turned  in  a  
stellar performance.  

The loss proved costly to the stickmen, as starting attackman Tim W a Ish suffered a knee injury and defenseman Jim Philbin sus­tained a minor concussion. 
McLane suspended 
by Fred Herbst Sports Editor 

Mark McLane, co-captain and starting halfback for Notre Dame, has been suspended from the squad for the remainder of the season it was announced yesterday by Bob Best, assistant sports information for the University. The suspension is the result of viola­tions of team rules. 
Best declined to give the reasons for the suspension. "By university policy, we are not allowed to comment," he said. 
McLane carried the ball 18 times for 56 yards this season and caught nine passes for 110 yards and two touchdowns.

McKay lashes out 
TAMPA, Fia. (AP) -"I think they just want to show me I'm just a college coach--a losing college coach,'' says john McKay, still sour after facing a bitter rival in Denver and suffering another defeat. 
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers' boss stomped off the field after Sunday's 48-13 loss to Denver, refusing to shake hands with Bronco Coach John Ralston and severely criticized the Denver coaching staff for allegedly running up the score on his expansion team. 
After many victories through m ,,, of his 16-year coaching tenure at the University of Southern California, McKay has walked off the field a loser in 13 of his last 14 games. That includes 0-9 in regular National Football League play and 1-5 in the Bucs' prest:a­son. 
When McKay made the jump to the NFL this year, he scoffed at questions about the difference between coaching in college and pro ranks. There wasn't any difference, he insisted. 
He asked for patience, saying it would take three or four years to build a contender. 
But now, McKay's misery and frustration is obvious. 
"I will not concede until the 14th game," he said. "But winning one or two won't make me that happy. A 2-12 record is repugnant. An 0-14 record is equally repugnant. I don't want to be a Denver or any of those jerks who've been in the league 17 years and never won anything. 
"I have been in the other position a lot more than that horse's ass," the Bucs coach said of the Denver coach. "I don't like any part of him. His day is coming." 
McKay admitted that his dislike was kindled when he was at Southern Cal and Ralston was at rival Stanford. 
McKay charged Denver with using devices to further mount the score--a reverse to tight end Riley Odoms and a last-moment punt return by Rick Upchurch. 
"My idea is that when you've got the game out of reach, you first try to protect your best players . Odoms or Upchurch could be hurt and out of the season on plays on plays like that," McKay said. 
"Secondly, I think you have to think about the guy on the other side of the field who is miserable. We had some high scores at S.C., but we were never plotting to pour it on." 
Ralston, told Sunday about Me Kay's displeasure, pointed 'Out that many of the Broncos' touchdowns came on fumble recoveries and interceptions. 
"If anything, we were adamant about not throwing against them," Ralston said. "Those were defen­sive points we scored. Hell, you can't tell your linebacker who intercepts the ball not to run with it." 
With an 0-14 expansion season a possibility, McKay could get the No. 1 draft pick. If that happens, it's likely McKay will reach back to his old campus and grab Ricky Bell, a 6-foot-2, 228-pound running back.
