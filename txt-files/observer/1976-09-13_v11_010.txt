Desire student contact 



Alumni Board holds first of three meetings 
by Martha FIUUllng 

Senior Staff Reporter 
The Notre Dame Alumni Board concluded their fall meeting last Saturday, Sept. 11, 1976. The purpose of the conference was to maintain two-way communication between the University and the alumni, according to Robert Dowd, 1976-77 president of the Board. 
During the four-day conference, members of the ND administration spoke to the board on events in 
their departments. "It's our way of updating ourselves on what's going on around here," remarked Dowd. 
Speakers at the session included: Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, University president; Fr. James Burtchaell, provost; Bro. Just Paczensy, vice­president for student affairs; dr. James Frick, vice-president for public relations and development; and Dr. Emil Hofman, dean of the Freshman Year of Studies Pro­gram. 
The board is composed of 19 members, representing 15 districts in the United States. Groups of six are elected each year to serve a three-year term. The presid~nt is elected for one year from the exiting group. Dowd took office on July 1, 1976. 
To maintain current input, the 
Board has three members-at-large. 
These are individuals, one from 
each group of six, who have 
graduated within the last five 
years. In most cases, that mem­
ber's activity record as a student is 
above average. 
Dowd emphasized the desire of 
the board to establish a better 
relationship with the stude9ts. 
"We are particularly interested in 
the seniors, to update them on 
alumni affairs, encourage them to 
join the association, and to make

lived." ­
Finally, Mondale paralleled the 
ideas of the Carter-Mondale plat­form to the efforts and achieve­.ments of the John F. Kennedy administration. "The Kennedy administration is a symbol of what 
we need,'' Mondale advocated. 
One of the achievements sup­
ported by Mondale was the form­
ation of the Peace Corps, which 
Mondale said, "produced the best 
citizens." 
"When the Dominican Republic 
broke out in war, the Peace Corps 
was there," he added. "They were 
the only people caught' between the 
line of combat, and -they were 
called the 'Children of Kennedy' by 
the natives." 
Mondale also addressed the young people in the audience by asking for their support and urging them to register to vote for the election. A Carter-Mondale ad­ministration wants to· provide the kind of leadership that uses the ideas of the country's young, Mondale said. 
In his concluding remarks, Moo­dale emphasized that necessary for a vital foreign policy is a demon­stration of concern for the down­trodden in the U.S. 
"Abraham Lincoln once said, 'With public respect, nothing can fail and without it, nothing can succeed.' We want an America with its faith restored, with its respect reclaimed abroad that can once again be called the best hope of mankind," Mondale concluded. 
Following his presentation, Mondale, after a brief standing ovation by the students and faculty, was greeted at a small reception in the Grace Hall lounge. The occasion was restricted to desig­nated students, faculty and admin­istrators of the University and special guests. · 
Senator Mondale's appearance was made possible through an invitation by Fr. Hesburgh. 
available any contacts or expertise the alumni can make or offer for job placement.'' 
Dowd commented that most alumni offices have placement offices for summer and permanent work. "The economy has created a situation where the number of new jobs is not equal to graduates. So if you have an edge on a job through an alumnus, hopefully our alumni will get the job over anyone else,'' concluded Dowd. 
The board strives to improve its knowledge of student problems, by such means as the members-at­large. Also during the conference they attempted to establish contact with students through the Senior Bar and by talking to their relatives currently attending Notre Dame. 
"We are interested in how they feel, and what they think," stated Dowd. "What's right and, hope­fully, a few things that might be wrong." 
"I think all of us, students and alumni, know the good things about Notre Dame. We want to know the areas where we can be constructive, where we can help," concluded Dowd. 
Joe White, a Missouri member­at-large, stated, "It's very impor­tant to emphasize that the Alumni Board is not a Iegislativ,e body. It does not tell the Uoiversity what to do." The boad will make resolu­tions, based on information it receives. These resolutions go to the University through Prof. John Cackley, Executive Director of the Alumni Association. 
Resolutions from last week's conference were made from infor­mation given to the board in the administrators' speeches. "Most of the information was general­primarily on new projects or pro­grams,'' declared Dowd. 
Students are encouraged to give their suggestions, comments or questions. Joseph McGlynn, a member from Missouri, suggested that interested students go through the alumni office on campus. "Students can write their sugges­tions and deliver them to the alumni office. Mr. Cackley, or his on scholarships funded through the association." 
The University recognizes the fact that tuition increases cannot continue unchecked, White pointed out. "The rising costs would then eliminate too many students from coming here,'' White remarked. "We are trying to help supply more money." 
The association is especially interested in seniors, who it hopes will become involved in their local clubs. "We hope these students will return to Notre Dame a little of what they received," said White. 
McGlynn commented, "Every­one who has had contact with the student body has reacted in a positive manner. This student body is the best as far as intelli­gence, character and morality.'' 
The Alumni Board holds three meetings annually at Notre Dame. The next meeting will be Jan. 20-22, 1977. The following spring another conference will be held from April 14-16. 

staff, will disseminate the informa­tion and pass it on to appropriate board members," he explained. 
McGlynn related that the board has several standing committees to look into suggestions. "Nothing gets shelved," he said. "It all gets discussed and hopefully resolved. I would think that the University would be delighted to know that students are genuinely interested in the University," noted McGlynn. 
One of the primary purposes of the Alumni Association is to aid Notre Dame financially. White remarked that the association raises money to enable the Univer­sity to improve the quality of education. He added, ''Fifty-seven percent of the students are on financial aid. A major portion are

~!IOU can trust me'--a pant!# raid 
shawn shaughnessy 
Editors Note: "The pracdce of male students visiting female residence halls in large groups to ask for panties is not worthy of Notre Dame men," says Dean Roemer. Honor or not, threats of disciplloe or not, this Notre Dame anachronism sdll prospers, a crusade of tradition. 
In my freshman year at Notre Dame, I was staying awake an unusual amount of time, but my average wasn't showing any signs of improvement. Besides, the assign­ments continued to mount. And this was only the first month. 
"At least I'll be able to relax in two days," I reassured myself, on the Thurs­day night . before the first home football game. More than any other Thursday in my entire life, that particular one will be remembered. Every detail is etched in my mind. 
I had been at the library that night. As I walked back to Holy Cross, a commotion erupted on the South Quad. Shouts and screams echoed across the campus. Since I was on the North Quad, I wasn't exactly sure what was happening. Probably a large group of students going crazy together, I thought to myself. Definitely nothing to get upset about. 
Usually the act of "going crazy" last about two minutes. Then the student either returns to studying, talks to a friend (or the four walls), or goes to a bar. 
When I reached Holy Cross-(a ten minute walk from the library), however, the crowd was still screaming. This mob now' seemed headed in my direction. Even inside the hall, everyone was running around and shouting. 
From outside the hall a voice bellowed, "Hey, you guys in Holy Cross! Get your asses out here!!" At that exact same moment, my roommate, Mark, darted down the hallway. 
"Where the hell is everyone going, Mark?!'' "Jee-sus! I didn't even see you, Ted. Come on! We're going on a panty raid!" 
Perhaps more than any other college, Notre Dame is enriched with "tradition." In gootball, Rockne, Leahy, Parseghian, The Four Horsemen, and the Gipper provided a legendary past and a promise for the present. Academic excellence is, another traditional trademark of this college. These elements are well-known to people everywhere. Some traditions, how­ever, are only apparent to those who have been part of this college community. The panty raid falls within this category. 
On the Thursday night before the first home football game, the guys from Notre Dame make a panty raid on Saint Mary's College. The panty raid is to the football season what Ash Wednesday is to Lent. 
Usually the panty raid is an event just for the students. In my junior year, however, the administration offered its official recognition to this custom. Or so I naively thought.. It was an honest mistake. Dumb perhaps, but honest. 
After all, when the crowd reached the gates of Saint Mary's, I noticed that the police and the dean of students were there to greet us. The dean of students was even carrying his camera, taking photographs of the occasion. Since I left my Kodak pocket instamatic in my room, I stopped and asked the dean to take my picture. Something to show my grandchildren. Besides, I wanted to "remember the times of my life." The dean, a congenial sort, clicked his camera courteously. I thanked him and returned to the ranks. 
"I didn't know the dean of students was an amateur photographer," I said to the guy walking next to me. 
"Whadda you mean?", he inquired. I related the story about the dean taking my picture. 
"What are you...?I", the guy roared. Before I could answer "Irish", he con­tinued his rampage," ... some kind of idiot, pal?! Do you think the dean's taking photographs for he yearbook or some­thing??!! Don't you know the administra­tion wants to put an end to panty ra,ds?! That's why the dean's taking pictures!! If you're identified, you're liable to be suspended. The entire story is in the school paper! Didn't you read it?!" 
I hadn't. Returning to the hall, I found a crumpled copy of the paper. The details of the story were on page one. Immediately, in my usual calm, cool manner, I panicked. Within the week, I would probably be enrolling in the local community college. 
For the next few days, I tried to remain inconspicuous. I avoided the post office 
' completely. This might sound ridiculous but right next to the "Ten Most Wanted" list I was convinced the dean of students had placed a list of "The Ten Most Horniest.'' My photograph was probably first. Every day, I picked up the school paper in fear. Looking at the front page, I expected to see a picture of myself with the caption underneath, "If you know this student, report to the dean of students immediately. Fifty dollar reward." In the ensuing week, however, nothing happened. I was a free man. The flashcube on the dean's camera probably didn't work, I thought to myself. On the panty raid in my freshman year, I didn't experience fear. Wonder is more like it. I wondered what in the world was happening. There we were, nearly a thousand guys marching down the road from Notre Dame to Saint Mary's. Italians, Irish, Germans and Polish people raised their voices in the common cry of "Here Come The Irish. Here Come The Irish." Everyone was crammed together in this rag-tag formation for the sake of possibly getting a discarded panty or bra--without a girl inside them! This sea of students swarmed across 
U.S. Highway 31, which separates the two campuses. Traffic was blocked for nearly ten minutes. As the people waited in their cars, many probably thought that we were on some type of protest march or religious pilgrimage. Little did they know that we were sex-starved students who were horney as hell. 
The Saint Mary's girls knew though. And they loved every minute of it, seeing us squirm. After all, they were the cause of our condition. The girls from Saint Mary's held out longer than the Americans at the Alamo. 

While we continued our crusade, the girls busily prepared for our arrival. A few minutes earlier, the resident assistants in every Saint Mary's hall warned the girls, "Don't encourage those perverts" and "Keep your windows closed." With a look of innocence, the girls reassured their R.A. Inside their rooms, however, they began to fill buckets and pans with water. 
The Saint Mary's girls are always finding ways to drive Notre Dame guys crazy. 
Actually, the girls didn't drive us completely crazy. After several weeks of studying, we were more than halfway toward that condition. The panty raid proved just how crazy we were. 
Every guy has his favorite hall to "raid." LeMans, however, became the ·top choice of most "raiders." For two reasons. LeMans is the first hall that appears to the crowd. After a half-mile journey of running and screaming, most of us didn't have the energy to go any further than this four-story fortress. Secondly, LeMans housed more girls than any other hall. Thus, the odds were better. We may have been 
Nevertheless, I still want to b,e fairly certain of my chances. At the panty raid, my philosophy paid off--almost. 
As the crowd clamored below, the windows of LeMans Hall were opened above. Through one of the openings, a girl dangled a bra. While she tantalized the throng, her roommate dumped two buckets of water on the unsuspecting males. Since the crowd was crammed together in anticipation of the ','prize" being dropped, 
1 only a few excaped the sudden shower. I had seen enough. It was time for me to return to the hall. I wasn't going to get wet. "Hey you. Psssst. Over here," an unknown voice called. 
Turning around, I saw a shapely girl standing in front of her second floor window. . 
"Come over here," she urged. "I have a bra here that I wanta get rid of. You can have it. Just think how your friends will be impressed.'' 
I stood still, suspiciously surveying the area behind her figure. There didn't seem to be any sign of a roommate hiding with a bucket of water. But I wasn't completely sure. 
Noticing my skepticism, the girl said, "Don't worry. My roommate is out with her boyfriend tonight. You can trust me." 
Why not?, I thought. Even if someone did try to dump water on me, I could react before getting wet. After all, no one else was around. I was completely alone. 
"Okay," I agreed. 
As the bra slipped from her hands, thought to myself, "You know, Ted, you really should trust people more. This girl has no intention c.f getting you wet. Besides, it couldn't be any easier. There's no one in sight. In a second, the souvenir will be yours. Wait until the guys in the section see it!" 
The bra was no one inch from my awaiting arms. 
Splat! Splat! 
I was soaking wet. Inside each cup of the bra, the girl had hidden a water balloon. Chalk up another point for innocence. 
I left the bra for someone else. The rest of the night I scanned the scene as a spectator. Mark, who had simialr luck, sat nearby, smoking a cigarette. We watched two guys fight over a panty. Another "raider"was scaling a wall to get an advantage. The only thing he got was drenched. 
"Only at Notre Dame," Mark said. 
Shivering, we returned to the hall. Several souvenirs had already been stapled onto the section bulletin board. Entering our room, Mark switched on the light. The florescent rays revealed our roommate, Gene, sleeping peacefully. 
"The only sane one," I said. 
Before Mark and I could attempt to sleep, Jim Ladeck barged into the room holding a size 40 black-laced bra. 
"Do you guys have a Saint Mary's phone book?", Jim asked. "Yeah, over on my desk, Jim", I answered. "But why?" "Just read what's inside the cups," Jim retorted, while handing me the bra. · I read aloud the inscription, which was 
written in red nail polish. 
"For thee, who finds me, 
My cups runneth over. 
Love, Luscious Lucy." 
Jim would spend the night searching the 
Saint Mary's phone book for last names 
that matched "Lucy." A week later, Jim 
would give up the hunt in vain. 
In our beds, Mark and I discussed the 
night's events. 
"You wouldn't go on another panty raid, 
would you Ted?" 
"Maybe," I answered evasively. 
"What. Are you crazy?!!" 
"Almost." 
"Me too," Mark answered dreamily. 
Smfling, I silently said, "Of all things. A 1panty raid." Only at Notre Dame. 
fallout from the silver screen 

anna monardo 
A bit of grace fell from the Big Screen 
with The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with 
the Sea. The film, starring Kris Kristoffer­
son and Sarah Miles, tries to juxtapose the 
disciplined mind and its desire for the 
universal harmony and perfection, with the 
lonely body and its desire for intimate 
attention and satisfaction. Despite the 
sensitive and delicate performance of Miss 
Miles, the appealing if not predictable 
performance of Kristofferson, and the 
beautiful, scenic photography of the En· 
glish seaside village, the substance of th€ 
movie falls short of the promises of its 
themes. 
The film deals with a complexity of themes: the relationship between a lovely English widow and her young son, her physical involvements and his furtive ·knowledge of them, and his intellectual 
involvements and her ignorance of them. 
The boy and his schoolmates form an 
elite society whose purpose is to eliminate 
the weakness and slothfulness of man to 
find the essence of the powerful life. They 
are lead by an imposing and terrifying little 
blond boy, who extends his mission beyond 
the limits of human decency. (Anyone with 
an affection of animals is warned not to see 
this movie). He assigns the boys numbers 
to replace their names, and then com­
mands' and manipulates them in the way he 
hopes to dictate the world someday. 
Power is the justification of his acts. 
The mother, unlike her son, is not looking beyond herself to find a universal harmony. Rather, she is searching within herself to find an intimate and meaningful harmony to complete her lonely life as mother, antique-shop owner, and widow. 
The vehicle which unifies these complex themes and plots is an American sailor, played by Kristofferson, who becomes the mother's lover and the nautically-inclined son's idol. When he trades his Captain's cap in for a wedding ring, the boys see it as the abandonment of a sacred pact between sailor and sea. The group then "pun­ishes'' the sailor in an attempt to reorder a disrupted universe. 
The dominating themes are of a high order; they are deep and each is wide enough to cover a vast span of human experiences. However, when conglomerat­ed within one film, they lose dimension. 
The director is basically sensitive and perceptive as he contrasts the intimacy of the woman's life with the life to which the young boys are dedicated. Gradually, however, the emphasis changes from art to sensation effect; the sexual love scenes become erotic sex scenes and all perspec­tive is lost. The imaginings and illusory world of the young boys' minds is at first provocative and even somewhat amusing;

dom salemi 

The Man Who Fell to Earth is an emotionally sterile and thematically hollow science fiction film starring David Bowie in what could hardly be called an auspicious film debut. Bowie did not want to make the film, but director Nicholas Roeg apparently talked him in to playing the lead in spite of what the rock star termed a "corny" script. 
The film does not fail because of Bowie, however, who does the best he can under the circumstances, but because of Roeg's aimless and lackluster direction. Roeg, a former cinematographer whose directorial credits include Walkabout, Performance (with Mick Jagger), and the startlingly hypnotic Don't Look Now; relies on striking visual imagery to elucidate a .confused and often didactic tale of an alienated extrater­restial' s visit to earth. 
Roeg's apparent concern with the cine­matic aspect of fllm aided him in depicting a man trapped in the etheral, nightmarish world of his subconscious in Don't Look Now. But in this film, his images of barren urban landscapes are banal and uninterest· ing, providing no apparent context for his characters. In addition, there is little character interaction. Most of the film consists of a series of set pieces designed to explicate intricacies of plot and character motivation. 
The film is based on a little known 

60's. It concerns the attempts of one Thomas Jerome Newton (Bowie) to return to his drought-plagued planet, upon ascer­taining that the water supply on earth is suitable to support life on his planet. Once Newton drops down to earth he finds a lawyer (marvelously underplayed by Buck Henry), who obtains a patent for self-devel oping film, one of nine original patents he has brought to earth. With the returns on his inventions, Newton sets up a multi-billi on dollar conglomerate called World Wide Enterprises (WE), the profits from which he intends to use to build a spaceship and return home. While trying to amass enough riches to return to his planet, Newton falls in love with a young maid named Mary Lou (Candy Clark). Their ensuing relationship is the only aspect of the film that has any substance. Mary Lou's anguished attempts to understand not only the strange man who has decided to live with her, but her own reasons for doing so are very moving.

Hunger Coalition  announces fast  

by Ginger McGowan Staff Reporter 
The Notre Dame World Hunger Coalition will initiate their pledge drive for the Wednesday Night Fast Program tomorrow in the dining halls, according to Terry Barrett and Kathy Rost, co-chair­persons of the drive. 
Students who agree to partici­pate will give up their Wednesday evening meals from September 22 to December 8. "Everything's the same as last year,'' explained Doug Allen, advisor. Tables will be set up in the dining halls Tuesday where students can obtain fact sheets, pledge sheets, and further information. 
"If you plan to miss Tuesday night you can still sign up til Friday in the Student Activities Office in LaFortune or the Food Service Office in South Dining Hall," stressed Allen. 
The Notre Dame Food Service has again agreed to contribute 75 cents per meal to the Hunger Coalition. Three-fourths of this money will be donated to overseas relief organizations such as UNICEF, CARE, CORR, and other agencies which the Coalition has researched. 
"The money sent overseas is absolutely not going just to feed people but is also used in develop­ment,'' Allen commented. 
One-fourth of the money is distributed to the poor of South Bend through the Justice and Peace Commission. The Hunger Coalition retains none of the money as. overhead. 
The fast program in '75-'76 involved over 1200 student parti­cipants, accumulating over $10,000 in contributions. Barrett acknowl­edged that the Hunger Coalition hopes to increase the number of people fasting this year, citing 2000 pledges as their curr_ent goal. 
Barrett clarified the controversy last year concerning the discrep­
. ancy between the meal price paid by dining hall guests and the 75-cent contribution donated by the Food Service. "A lot of people think the dining hall is ripping us off because meal tickets cost $3.00," he explained. "However, the evening meal cost is well below the price for guests, so actually the dining hall is giving us the best possible deal."

St. Mary's food service does not participate in the fast program because it is a profit organization, while Notre Dame's is not. 
According to Barrett, the Hunger Coalition believes the Fast Pro­gram is a more meaningful sac­rifice than dropping money in a box. "In this way, people are not only donating their money but their thoughts," he said. "Bv thinking
