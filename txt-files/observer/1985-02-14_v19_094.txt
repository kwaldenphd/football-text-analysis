Hesburgh leads panel in pastoral discussion 
By PAT CONLIN 
News Staff 
Though each of the panelists had suggestions, the bishops' letter on the economy received a general nod of approval from professors and priests at a discussion held at Notre Dame last night. 
"The bishops' message is appro­priate and their timing is excellent," said Ed Trubac, professor of finance and business economics, who said attention is now focused on the eco­nomy because of current federal budget cutting and recent recession. 
"The long recession lowered in­flation. We know the benefits ofthat, the bishops have reminded us ofthe costs," he said. 
"A country is judged by what it does for the poor and powerless. If the bishops don't take a stand there, how can they take a stand on anyth­ing," said Father Theodore Res­burgh, University president. "I say to you, it's time now for the bishops to say something," he said. 
The first draft of the letter "Catholic Social Teaching and the 
U.S. Economy" was released by a committee of bishops led by Mil­waukee's Archbishop Rembert Weakland in November. The bis­hops will publish the final draft of the letter later this year. 
"It's really a restatement of the statement that has always guided Christians," said Father Oliver Wil­liams, associate professor ofmanage­ment. "We are both our brolher~· and sisters' keepers," he said. 
"It is important to show the relevance of religion and the Bible to economics. We have a nenl for ethical standards," Williams noted, adding that the challenge is to create a sense ofpurpose. 
"We all need an ideal, a vision of what we're shooting for. We don't have a cultural consensus that everybody has economic rights," he said. 
Charles Craypo, chairman of the economics department, said "We must pursue full employment in this country -it should be a serious policy objective." 
But criticisms came hand in hand with praise at the discussion, sponsored by Omicron Delta Ep­silon, the economics honor society. 
"They have gone in far too much detail, they shouldn't give policy ap­plications. We have managers who are extremely talented and ifwe let them, they could solve many of these problems," said Williams. 
"The bishops would do a great service if they would analyze the strengths and weaknesses ofour cur­rent society, not just economically but socially," said Hesburgh. 
Hesburgh also regretted that the 
letter sounds too much like an "old 
New Deal agenda." 
Economics professor James 
Rakowski said the emphasis on 
change should be placed more on 
people rather than capitalist institu­
tions. He said such arguments give 
individuals a "way out." 
"The focus of economy should be on people. The bishops shift from emphasis on people to 'sinful' structures," he said. "The economy is unstahk l~<..:au'e "·c-art" not good economists The economv is unjust

Low turnout marks class election's 
By BETH WHELPLEY 
News Staff 
The ticket ofAnne Marie Kollman was elected to office by thirty-seven percent of the student body yester­day at the Haggar College Center. 
The Kollman ticket consisted of Kollman herself, who was elected as Student Body president, Jeane Hel­ler as Vice President of Student Af­fairs, and Julie Harmon as Vice President ofAcademic Affairs. 
Running unopposed on the ballot, the Kollman ticket received 97 per­cent ofthe obtained votes. Said Kol­lman, "We got a high percentage of the votes. I am excited that they think we're capable ... We feel we have strong support." 
The senior class officers elected were Ann McCarthy as president, Mary Sauer as vice president, Mimi Boyle as class secretary, and Francie White as treasurer. Fifty-six percent of the senior class voted for the McCarthy ticket as opposed to the Steber ticket. The Steber ticket in­cluded Beth Steber, Elizabeth Spraul, Liz Zimmer, and Patty Mur­
ray. 
Commenting on the 66 percent turnout at the polls by the seniors, McCarthy said, "It was a great race .. . We are pleased with the voter par­ticipation, and we're anticipating an exciting senior year." 
The senior class boasts the largest turnout at the polls in comparison to the entire student body. 
Michelle Coleman was elected president of the junior class, along with her running mates Betsy Burke as vice president, Angie Hundman as class secretary, and Katie Sullivan as treasurer. While their ticket, which ran unopposed, received 90 percent of the obtained votes, only 28 per­cent ofthe juniors actually voted. 
"Even though I'm disappointed at the low turnout, I think it's under­standable considering the weather and the unopposed ticket. I think if there had been more than one per­son running, people would have felt their vote would be more impor­tant." 
For the sophomore class officers, president-elect is Sarah Cook, vice president is Colleen Dowd, secre­tary is Susan Etton, and treasurer is Lisa Hamann. Fifty-nine percent of the votes were acquired to surpass the opposing ticket of Karen Han­son, Uz Wrobel, Mary Ryan, and Anne Borgmann . 
The sophomore class had the lowest turnout at the polls, with only 24 percent of the students voting, said Cook. 
"Ifstudents want to have the right to voice their opinions, then they should exercise that right by voting," she added. 
Trish Cullo served as Election Commissioner for the '85 elections. Looking at the student body per­centages, Cullo said, "We had a really bad turnout for 37 percent. I think a lot had to do with the wea­ther. However, 66 percent is the highest percentage of voters we've ever had for the senior class." 
Voting took place at Haggar Col­lege Center which is accessible to most students by tunnels. 
Kollman, on the voter turnout said, "I'm a little disappointed. I ex­pected.a low count because of the weather. I'm surprised at the sopho­more class. Perhaps they felt voting wasn't necessary because there was only one ticket." 
Winter 'unusual,' says weatherma 
By MARKS. PANKOWSKI 
News Staff 
'Traveller's advisory for tomor­row. Cloudy, windy, and a chance ofsnow." 
That forecast, from Tuesday night's WNDU newscast, has become all too familiar to Notre Dame students and faculty lately. 
South Bend's recent weather has been characterized by heavy snowfalls and unseasonably cold temperatures, according to WNDU's weatherman, who said that this year's winter has been quite unusual. 
"This is not a typical winter. Last year we had a temperature of 59 degrees on this date (Feb. 12 ). Now I'm looking out of my win­dow at blowing winds and heavy snow." 
For Addis, the entire winter has been a nightmare because of it's unpredictability. 
"There've been no trends. Everything has been unexpected and full of anomalies. Things haven't been going along with projected patterns," said Addis. "I'm surprised when some wea­ther forecasters can· get the 48 hour outlook correct, much less the 5 day outlook." 
Student reaction to the recent snowfall and frigid temperatures has ranged from "I like it" to "It's depressing." 
FreshmanJohn Keegan took an optimistic outlook, saying, "I like the snow. It makes the campus look great." 
Other students weren't as en­thusiastic. Junior Christina W ein­mann commented, "I can take the snow. But when you get two feet of it, that's overdoing it." 
Jason Ebora, a sophomore from what the future weather will Hawaii, concurred, saying bring. simply, "I prefer white sand." "Basing the future on past

Classes not cancelled 
By MARK PANKOWSKI 
News Staff 
Many Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students have been won­dering why classes have contin­ued despite the recent harsh weather conditions. 
"(The weather) would have to be a lot more severe" in order for classes to be cancelled at Notre Dame, said University Provost Timothy O'Meara. 
Saint Mary's President John Duggan agreed, saying, "It would take a natural disaster for classes to be cancelled at Saint Mary's." 
Duggan and O'Meara have similar reasons for keeping their schools open. 
"The students are all here on campus and most of the faculty can make it here, so I see no point in closing (Saint Mary's)," said Duggan. "For those faculty that couldn't make it, we just can­celled their classes." 
"We have a large number of students on campus so we felt we could conduct classes," O'Meara noted. "We also have a certain amount ofclass days that we have to get in each semester." 
History and tradition seem to be on Duggan and O'Meara's side. 
According to Duggan, "Saint Mary's and Notre Dame have been closed once in the past 140 years, as far as anybody around here can remember." 
"That was in 1978 when the drifts were four to five feet high," continued Duggan. "People couldn't move around and they were advised to stay inside." 
O'Meara believes he made the right decision in holding classes at Notre Dame yesterday. "I just talked to several men in a dorm and none oftheir classes was can­celled," said O'Meara. "I drove five miles today (Feb. 13), and I got here fine."

H Connecticut lawmakers go along, "An Act 
Prohibiting The Use Of Uncooked Rice At Nuptial Affairs" would provide that "no person shall throw, fling, cast or hurl any uncooked rice at any time during the celebration ofany marriage." Republican Rep. Mae Schmidle says it would "prevent injury and death of birds as a result ofingesting raw rice." Schmidle's bill would impose a SSO fine for anyone caught throwing raw rice at a wedding. Tossing cooked rice at newleyweds would solve the problem, Schmidle ac­knowledged. But she said that, too, would tiave its drawbacks. "Then you'd have to throw It in lumps," she said. -AP

Flowers, candy, cards symbolize commercialism of Valentine's Day 
Today, for those who are still haven't gotten past December, is Feb. 14. Al:;o known as Valentine's Day. 
You might remember Valentine's Day; it's that holiday where half the population is coerced into spending money on flowers, candy and the like, while the other half is made to feel unloved, unwanted and maybe unwashed ifno oneis spending moneyon them. 
Some holiday. 
For those who have succumbed to the Valentine's Day spirit and are blessed with tokens ofsomeone's af­fection, this column is not for you. Smell your flowers, eat your candy. Don't bother reading on. 
The rest of us, who have nothing better to do than shovel snow and finish our homework, might as well continue. 
The Accent pages oftoday's paper explore the myths behind Valentine's Day. Who is the St. Valentine after 
which this day is named?  How  did  the  traditions  
originate?  
This author's personal  
belief is that Valentine's Day  
is the creation of a market­ 
ing genius who created a fic­ 
tional St. Valentine, sent  
press releases across the  
country and bought as much  
Hallmark stock as he could  
lay his hands on.  
Valentine's Day is  
capitalism in it's purest  
form. Convince everyone  
that they are thoughtless,  
unloving people unless they  
send flowers, or at least a  
card, on an arbitrary day.  
Concoct massive advertis­ 
ing campaigns to make sure  
no one forgets his/her Valentine's Day obligation  1-t'f  

Then sit back and count the money. I'll bet you wouldn't catch Chernenko sending a valentine. 
"But all holidays tend toward commercialism,'' say those Valentine's Day supporters who ignored the pre­vious warning and have continued reading. "That doesn't mean there's nothing there." 
Maybe not. Valentine's Day does have its good points, or so they say. It is a day ofromance.lt is a day on which people show their feelings for one another. And though it seems unlikely that there's much love in a candy heart, there's not much harm in one. · 
The sad thing is that Valentine's Day makes us translate our affection into dollars and cents. Cliched as it may sound, most people show their "love" in little ways. They shovel someone's sidewalks, help out with homework, even take out the garbage. Not very roman­tic, but a little more real than a rose and a song. "But," claim the ever-vocal Valentine's Day sup-

porters, "that's the whole point. Valentine's Day is supposed to be romantic." And for some it is. There are those who love to give flowers. Then there are those who feel obligated to give them just because it's Feb. 14. And finally, there are those who have no one to whom to give flowers. 

It is to the last two groups that this column is ad­dressed. Those who don't like to display their feelings and those who (maybe to their chagrin) don't have anyone on which to lavish their affections. 
The Valentine's Day sup­porters don't need this column. They can smell their roses and eat their candy. Or better yet, eat their roses and smell their candy. They have a whole slew of advertisers and sen­timental types on their side. 
This column is for those who are sick ofcandy hearts and X-rated valentines. This for those who plan to celebrate Valentine's Day alone with a biology book and a beer. This is for all those to whom Feb. 14 is just another snowy South Bend day. 
We know that Valentine's ,MARK wEtMHOLf Day is just silly and commer­
cial. and we refuse to submit. We'll sit back and laugh at those who take this holiday seriously. We'll stand fast in our war against commercialism. 
And maybe next year. someone will send flowers.

Internationally acclaimed guitarist to perform at O'Laughlin Saturday 
SpecJal to The ObM:rver 
Internationally acclaimed Canadian classical guitarist Liona Boyd will present a concert in O'Laughlin Auditorium on Saturday, February 23, 1985, at 8 p.m. She will play selections from Bach, Chopin, 
Rodrigo, and Granados among others. 
Boyd, rated one of the top three classical guitarists in the world by Frets magazine in 1983, is relatively new to the musical world. She did not begin studying the guitar until she was in her early teens, after at­tending a concert featuring Julian Bream, the internationally admired classical guitarist. 
"I wanted to take the guitar seriously," she recalls. "While other kids at my school were sticking Bea­tie cards on the backs of their mir­rors I'd stick pictures of Bream and Segovia on the backs of mine." 
Boyd studied guitar under the tutelage ofEli Kassner. In addition to giving Boyd superior instruction, Kassner introduced his protege to the most successful 20th century classical guitar perfomers. 
"We have a very close relation­ship even now," Kassner says. "She always asks my advice; she comes and plays new material for me; she checks out her records with me and gets my opinion on the construction of her concert programs." 
Boyd attended the University of Toronto where she studied compo­sition music history, harmony, and piano technique. Shortly before she completed her honors degree in mu­sical performance in 1972, Kassner arranged for her to play for his friend, guitarist Alexandre Lagoya, in Toronto for a concert. Although Lagoya was no longer accepting private students, he urged Boyd to come to Nice and study with him. 
Boyd agreed to make her first record in 1974. By now she had already won the 1972 Canadian Na­tional Music Competition for guitar. When produced, the album, "The Guitar -Liona Boyd," began her meteoric career. 
Boyd's life since her first album has been a nonstop blur of towns, cities, hotel rooms, high school auditoriums, concert halls and in­credible good fortune. In 1975 at the Juno Award presentations (she received hers in 1978 as Instrumen­tal Artist of the Year) she met folk guitarist Gordon Lightfoot. He asked her to join him as an opening act and for three years they toured across North America, playing more than 80 concerts. 
Today Boyd has many albums to her credit and outsells every other Columbia Records classical artist by 10-1. She travels the world to per­form for heads of state. In 1982 she played at the economic conference at Montebello for Ronald Reagan, Pierre Trudeau, Margaret Thatcher, Francois Mitterand, Helmut Schmidt, Giovanni Spaldolini and Zenko Suzuki. 
She has appeared on The Mike Douglas Show, The Merv Griffin Show, The Dinah Shore Show and The Today Show. CBS-TV, Canada, featured her in a 1978 Superspecial and she has played at "An Evening with the Boston Pops," and Stars on Ice. She composes music for short movies and plays concert benefits each year, and in 1981/82 she was spokesperson for the Arthritis Soci­ety ofCanada. 
In her concert at Saint Mary's, Boyd will perform a work by a local guitarist, Ian Krause, who is a graduate oflndiana University. 
Following the concert at O'Laughlin Auditorium, the Canadian Consulate will host a reception at Saint Mary's for the art­ist.

SAT value questioned in new Harvard study 
By EILEEN HOFFMANN 
News Staff 
How important are SAT scores? This question has received attention at Notre Dame lately as debate con­tinues concerning whether or not the Scholastic Aptitude Test is still achieving its original purpose. 
The questions arose in the wake of a study conducted by Harvard Uni­versity to determine the accuracy of the SAT in determining a student's potential for success in college. 
The study was prompted by the abolishment of the SAT requirement for admission at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine. 
As a result of the study, printed in the Feb. 5 edition ofThe Wall Street Journal, Harvard is considering replacing the SAT with achievement tests in such subjects as history and science. 
At Notre Dame, a prospective stu· dent's SAT scores are reviewed in

because we are unjust," stated 
 Rakowski. "Economics never made a hero," Hesburgh said, "We must per· sonalize the economy. The letter should have been written in a way that would most dramatize the prob­lems we face. Catholic social teach· ing is very good; the bishops must be more pragmatic. We cannot just come up with theories--we must do." 
In conclusion, Hesburgh ex­horted the more than 150 in atten­dance, "It's your world. You'll make It better or slide with the injustic~s. Get into it. Try to understand the in· justices. Don't be that kind of per­son. Do what you can to make this a better world." 
conjunction with a number ofother 
factors, including high school cur­
riculum and grades and the can­
didate's personal essay, according to 
Kevin Rooney, Director of Under­
graduate Admissions. 
''Several factors contribute to the 
process of admissions at Notre 
Dame, among them the personal es­
says written by the applicants, any 
extra-curricular activities that they 
participated in during high school, 
and the development of the whole 
person. Our admissions department 
is looking for those students who 
would be a positive force in both the 
classroom as well as the residence 
halls," said Rooney. 
Rooney adds that there are no plans to discontinue using the two· and-a-half hour test, taken by ap· proximately one million students each year, as part ofthe Notre Dame admissilits process. He noted, however, that the University would be interested in reviewing the re­.search being conducted by Harvard. 
In the first part of the discussion, 
the panel members each com­
mented on specific sections of the 
document. 
Refering to Chapter 2, Williams said, "This letter reminds us that our civil and political rights were hard won. Now is the time to move on to economic rights for everyone." 
Craypo outlined the four alterna­tives offered by the bishops to using unemployment as an anti-inflation strategy: "We need a national com­mittment to full employment, direct job creation, the formation ofpoliti· cal coalition to build full employ­ment, and finally to expand and improve employment sources." 
Trubac, discussing Chapter 4, cited the social factors leading to the poverty problems as "racial discrim­ination, the feminization of poverty and the unequal distribution of wealth becoming more pronounced."

iremen fight Manila hotel blaze 
Associated Press 
MANILA, Philippines -Hundreds of firefighters for a second night Wednesday battled a blaze that swept through one of Manila's larg­est luxury hotels. At least 24 people, including four Americans, died in the blaze. 
"This is going to take the whole night," said Col. Alfredo Garcia, area fire superintendent, supervising the hundreds offiremen on the scene. 
Twenty-four hours after the fire started on the hotel's second floor, smoke continued to pour out of upper-floor windows on one wing of the 11-story, 464-room bayside hotel. 
One fire official, Col. Rodolfo Vil­lavicencio, said the death toll could 
U.S.-Soviet talks to begin Tuesday 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The United States and Soviet Union will sit down to discuss the Middle East next week, but U.S. officials tried yester­day to dampen expectations in ad­vance by insisting they expect no change in Soviet policies. 
Nevertheless, the two-day session in Vienna, beginning Tuesday, represents an increase in the dialogue on such troublespots as Af­ghanistan, southern Lebanon, the Iran-Iraq war and the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
"These talks should not be seen as 
negotiations," State Department 
spokesman Bernard Kalb cautioned 
after announcing the discussions. 
"They are merely an exchange of views," he said. "They do not repre­sent any change in the U.S. position

The cause of the fire was not yet known, but Villavicencio said it may have been arson. "To me it looks sus­picious because the lateral spread was quick and the alarm was delayed." 
Fire officials said 18 bodies had been recovered, and that firemen had located at least six more bodies in areas of the building still too hot to enter. Government television said 26 people were dead, but gave no breakdown and cited no specific sources for the figure. 
Most of the bodies recovered were found on stairway landings. Villavicencio said he feared more

The U.S. delegation will be led by Richard Murphy, assistant secretary ofstate for the Near East. The Soviet team will be led by Vladimir Polyakov, who is Murphy's counter­part in the Soviet foreign ministry. 
"The discussions are to contrib­ute to our own mutual understanding of those problems and are part ofour ongoing effort to engage the Soviets in the full agenda of issues, including regional ques­tions, human rights, and bilateral is­sues as well as arms control," said Kalb. Arms control negotiations are set to resume next month in Geneva. 
President Reagan, leaving the White House yesterday for a vaca­tion in California, was asked what the meeting might accomplish. 
victims among the hotel's estimated 370 guests and an undetermined number ofemployees may have suff­ocated as they jammed smoke-filled hallways. 
Police said earlier that 160 guests had been transferred to the nearby Hyatt and that they did not know the whereabouts of more than 150 others. They said some ofthe others may have moved to other hotels on their own. 
Officials of two funeral homes where the dead were taken identi­fied the four Americans as Edward Carroll, a U.S. internal Revenue Ser­vice official based in Tokyo; Raymund Ching of Honolulu; Lewis Carrol Rowney, 62, and his wife Ber­nadine. 
"Well, there are a number of things that 1 think are of interest to both countries," he said. "There's some reason to believe that we can straighten out some things -trade matters." 
Kalb said the objective of the ses­sion was to "help avoid miscalcula­tion and to reduce the potential risk of U.S.-Soviet confrontation." 
Reagan, asked about the reported agreement between PLO chief Yas­ser Arafat and Jordan's King Hussein on a so-called "framework for peace," replied: "it seems as if some progress has been made ... so, we're being optimistic about it." 
But he said the administration was "definitely not in support" of hold­ing an international conference on the Middle East, which Israel also opposes.

Ballet company to perform as part of SMC art series 
Special to The Observer 
"Chicago City Ballet-such stuff as dreams are made of." This is how one critic described the Chicago City Ballet which will perform in O'Laughlin Auditorium at 8 p.m. Friday as part ofthe Saint Mary's Per­forming Arts Series. 
The internationally acclaimed bal­let is under the direction of of Maria Tillchiefand Paul Mejia. 
The company will perform three selections, each choreographed by Paul Mejia: "Brahms Waltzes" is a modern classical ballet designed for 18 dancers which features lyrical dancing in the style of the waltz; "Jeux" enacts flirtations on a tennis court to the music of Claude Debussy; and "Perfumes" utilizes the entire company and features the music of Albinoni, Shanker, Stravinsky, Berlioz, and an Argen­tinian tango. 
Tallchief has been universally recognized as America's first great prima ballerina. When George Balanchine formed the New York City Ballet in 1948, she became the

company's prima ballerina. Under Balanchine's guidance, she dominated the world of interna­tional dance for two decades. Presi­dent Eisenhower bestowed upon her "The Woman ofthe Year" award in"1953. 
Tallchief is now placing her en­ergy into her ballet company, which strongly reflects the artistic and cre­ative ideas of her teacher and late husband George Balanchine. 
With the help of another Balanchine protege, Paul Mejia, Tal­lchief is successfully shaping the company of 26 dancers into the image of Balanchine's New York City Ballet. 
Paul Mejia was made Artistic Director of the company in 1981. A scholarship student at the School of American Ballet, Mejia later joined the New York City Ballet where he danced leading roles in many Balanchine works. 
Tickets for the performance are on sale at the box office for 16. 50, S5.50, and S4.50, with a dollar dis­count for students and senior citizens.

IfAndy Looney were still around and the Keenan Revue were this weekend, 
Looney would look around O'Laughlin Auditorium and ask to his audience: 
"Classes in this snow. Why?" 
The answer, according to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, is that the snow ... er . . . the show must go on. And yesterday it did. Students stumbled out oftheir beds and waded to class through two-foot snow drifts just to find out, in many cases, that class had been cancelled anyway. Unlike the postman, professors sometimes have trouble moving a car through unplowed side streets. One ad­ministrator said it took 45 minutes to travel five blocks from his home to campus. 
The official word from the University and the College was that non-academic staff did not have to report to work yesterday. For secretaries, maids, business staff and the like, it was what you always hoped for as a child: a snow day. A sign in Decio Hall at Notre Dame summed II.;up: Classes were on, offices wereclosed. 
SaidJohn Duggan, president ofSaint Mary's: "It would take a natural disaster" for the College to close. 
But officials in South Bend seemed to be treating the snow storm as such. St. Joseph County roads were closed, in addition to parts ofU.S. 31 and the Indiana Toll Road. Every meeting, seminar, event--a list that took a local radio station 1 S minutes to read --all seemed to be cancelled in the South Bend area. Police threatened to arrest motorists who ventured out for anything less than an emer­gency. 
SisterJohn MiriamJones, assistant provost at Notre Dame, said the main con­cern is not to disrupt the academic schedule. Eighty percent of the people involved in holding class-on campus students--were already here,Jones added, so why not hold class? 
Another answer goes back to the winter of 1978. Snow drifts then were monsters, four or five feet tall, and all of northern Indiana ceased to function. Except the liquor stores near Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. As several professors noted in class yesterday, the two schools simply are afraid that the announce­ment ofa Snow Day would immediately explode into Alcohol Abuse. 
And everyone knows that few things are worse than Alcohol Abuse. Let pro­fessors land their cars in drifts. Let off-campus students skid offthe road. Please remember, Father Hesburgh and Dr. Duggan, that the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's community is not the U.S. Post Office. Rain, sleet, snow or hail can halt these schools, if not the mail.

Second semester senior syndrome sets in at ND 

It's February at Notre Dame -and you know what that means. 
It's time for the second semester senior syndrome or S4 · and you thought all you had to worry about was the cold andflu season? 
Guess again. 
Let's face it, second semester before spring break at Notre Dame can be a traumatic expe­rience for anyone · weeks upon end without sunshine, South Pacific night in the dining

hall, the mid-semester crunch. But, for many second semester seniors this time is especially troublesome. As we worry about what city we will end up in, what law schools or graduate: schools will accept us or what we'll actually be doing for the rest of our lives, we fre. qucntly lose perspective. All too often, we try to conceal our concerns from others, prefer­ring to keep them to ourselves. 
I know. After being afflicted with an acute case ofS4 this past week, I've discovered some: antidotes to this peculiar illness. 
First ofall, don't be afraid to talk about your feelings with a good friend. I'm not suggesting that you constantly burden other people with your problems, but rather, that you try to ver­balize your feelings to someone who has a sensitive car. Other seniors are especially good people to talk to, because chances are they're probably feeling or have already expc· ricnced the exact same feelings you have. 
Second, don't fall into the trap ofrefusing to meet new people just because it's second se­mester and you're graduating in May. Granted, you may only be able to spend a shon amount of time with them, but some time is better than no time at all, right? Think about it. There 
are approximately 1,700 members of the 
Class of 1985 -people who have attitudes, 
ideas, and perspectives totally unique from 
yours. In my view, if you don't make an effort 
to meet at least a few of them before May 19, 
1985, you'll be missing out on what could be 
an invaluable educational experience, not to 
mention some good times. 
Third, take time out for yourself. Nobody 
else is going to give you a break, even though 
McDonald's says you deserve one today -it's 
up to you to take the initiative. Do something 
you wouldn't ordinarily do-spend more time 
offcampus, get involved with volunteer work, 
or challenge yourself to do something you've 
always wanted to do, but haven't had the 
courage to try. In three weeks, I've (almost) 
conquered my fear of ice skating -next, it's 
time for me to hit the slopes. 
Fourth, reflect upon your faith and the role that God plays in your life. I'm not suggesting that you cloister yourself or even that you begin attending Mass on a daily basis; rather, I'm saying that since God is the one who knows what form your life will soon be assum· ing, doesn't it make sense to at least touch base with Him? 
Finally -and this is probably the most diffi­cult thing to do -hang in there. Even though this piece ofadvice is frequently given and sel­dom followed, it's still worth mentioning at least one more time. By concentrating your efforts upon living each day, you'll make it through. And just think, this time next year, you'll look back on your experiences as a second semester senior and wonder to your· self, "Where did the time go?", as the memories of S4 are replaced with reminis­cences of times spent laughing and sharing with friends.

Fighting and backbiting hurts our government 
By now, everyone is sick to death of the Great Notre Dame Election Scandal of 1985. For those of you who were hiding under a rock for the past week or so and didn't hear about it, I'll briefly reiterate the story, hope­fully for the last time. It seems that one SBP/SBVP ticket committed several infrac­tions ofcampaigning rules, was caught, had its candidacy withdrawn, and ultimately had its candidacy reinstated. In the process, a whole

bunch of "important and influential" people connected with the electoral process and stu­dent government resigned. Space limitations preclude my providing the scorecard neces· sary to keep track of who did what and to whom on this merry-go-round. 
In the case of our recent election, OBUD laid down the rules and enforced them. It used its "espionage network" to hunt down cam­paign violations. It confronted the violators, 
In the aftermath of this mini·Watergate (Domergate?), one must wonder not only what the role ofstudent government at Notre Dame is, but who Is "student government". The Student Senate? The Ombudsman? The Hall President's Council? 
A couple of days ago, I asked roughly a dozen of my friends who the student body president was. Only three replied "Rob Ber­tino." None of them had any idea who their student senator was. A few could describe OBUD's functions. Most had an idea of what the HPC was. My point is: If these bodies are such a vital part of our community and sup­posedly play a major role in student affairs, why don't we hear or know more about them? Are they really fulfilling the needs of the typi­cal student, or are they just a source of nifty· looking resume Items for their members? 
who admitted their guilt. It stripped them of 
their candidacy. A job well done. 
Then the Student Senate steped in. It over­
turned OBUD's decision and restored the 
guilty parties to the ballot. Why? · we don't 
know. The decision was made in secret, and 
no explanations were offered. Is this a job well 
done? 
Ultimately, an ad hoc election committee 
ran the elections, accomplishing what usually 
takes months to organize in a mere two days. 
The elections were conducted without inci· 
dent. However, all is stil not well. 
The problem is obvious: nobody really 
knows who is responsible for what. Egos take 
precedence over rules. Our "leadership" has 
no direction. A policy of "sec no evil, hear no 
evil, speak no evil" just will not work. The 
people with the most potential power and in­
fluence arc least in touch with the student 
body as a whole. The election fiasco was 
merely a symptom of this disarray in general. 
Despite the good intentions of many, our 
present system ofstudent leadership is a joke. 
It is a very bad joke. Like any bad joke, it 
reflects as poorly upon the perpetrator as the 
victim. We have the people and ideas to make 
our community truly great, we only need a 
push in the right direction. Better organiza­
tion and communication is that push. 
The campus leadership must realize that in· fighting and backbiting will get them, and us, nowhere. Goals and objectives must be set. Strategies and programs to achieve these goals must be implemented, maintained, and reviewed. Responsibilities must be assigned, and the various governmental bodies must respect each others' duties and decisions. Most importantly, they must remember whom they represent -the students. Closed door meetings and secret ballots are tools of dictators, not legislators. We have a right to know what's going on and why. Isn't getting 
fair representation what elections are all about?

Stalin's promises, hoping to elicit promise­, keeping in return. It never came. 
"We can't do business with Stalin, he has broken every one of the promises he made at Yalta," FOR said ruefully before he died. It was too late to lay down American innocence. Harry Truman had a lot of FOR's doing to undo. So does Ronald Reagan. 
C. 1985 LOS ANGELES TIMES SYNDICATE 
Forty years ago Franklin Roosevelt spent a week at Yalta with Stalin and Churchill, and out ofthat week the Soviet empire was born. 
Ronald Reagan, 34 at the time, was a fervent Roosevelt supporter. Now, 40 years later, in 
Max Lerner The Max Lerner Column 
his State ofthe Union address, Reagan has said, "We can't play innocents abroad in a world that is not innocent." It is a sentence likely to last. The phrase is from Mark Twain's hilarious spoofon American travelers in Europe. Regan could not have used it without having Yalta and its bleak and savage heritage in mind. 
With Churchill protesting but helpless to stop him, FOR agreed to Stalin's formula for mock elections in Poland, without the inter­national supervision Chuirchill had demanded. 
This meant a surrender of the Polish future to a government that would do Russia's will. Poland served as Stalin's model, and the result was the division of Europe into two Europes, one free, one satellite. 
How did this happpen, with the greatest American president of the century in charge, one who has become the paradigm ofour cult ofstrong leadership? Two sets ofexplanations have emerged. One is situational: Roosevelt was exhausted and sick, as witness the historic Yalta photo, with his face a death mask. Roosevelt -and Churchill too -wanted to end the war quickly, and avoid the cost in lives in finally cracking Hitler's Fortressed Germany. 
Asecond explanation runs in terms of quid pro quo. Roosevelt wanted three things form Stalin -to drive through Eastern Europe to Berlin, to help America later with the costly storming of Japan, to join him in building a postwar United Nations world. 
But in explaining Yalta these explanations explain it away. It is true that Roosevelt was a dying man who had stretched his body and will in the war and 1944 campaign. But Stalin needed no courting to drive to Berlin. He was only too happy to do it, willing to risk the casualties because it would make him the pos­sesssor on the grounds. 
The big bribe of islands and a sphere of in­fluence in the North Pacific was also a needless largesse for Stalin's promise fo help with Japan. He must have looked forward to a partnership in the occupation ofJapan, as of Germany. 
The decisive fact was that FOR never quite grasped the global geopolitical realities. That

I know hasn't it? Next fad, please. its fledgling days. It got a lot ofpoor 

and disadvantaged kids to do some­thing else besides stand on street corners and go nowhere. Break­dancing was fun and it inspired some intense non-violent competi­tion among the ghetto kids. It also unified the members of the black music community to some extent at a time when white music smot­hered the charts with its bland sound and polished looks. 
But now, breakdancing is old hat, and I think that the soundtrack to · Breakin' 2 Electric Boogaloo demonstrates what it has developed into -a big business that now neglects the original street-smart sensibilities that once made it vital. In short, Breakin' 2 is mostly noth­ing but corporate black music. 
Ollie & Jerry, the creators oflast year's breakdancing anthem, "Breakin'-There's No Stopping Us," again lend thdr talents to the effort. with Ollie Brown serving as execu­tive producer. They perform two of the better songs on the album, "Electric Boogaloo" and "When 
I.C.U." 
The former is a slower song than "There's No Stopping Us," but it is definitely more soulful. It combines a lot ofsynthesizer, electric drums, and percussion, much like "Breakin' "did. A hot, sultry groove grinds the song along, and some effectiv~ soul singing make this one a high­light. 
The latter is not quite as good, though. Its main problem is a lack of Jerry simply inserted some electric handclaps, or anything else handy. Still, these two songs completely overshadow the other songs on the album -all the other songs, that is, except a positively brilliant dance number by George Kranz called "Din Daa Daa." 
The people who compiled this soundfrack probably felt obligated to include at least one established hit, and this was it (It was the 5 dance song of I984 ). "Din Daa Daa" is danceable to say the least. The only "words" Kranz sings in the song are the three in the title. His silly lyrics are sung over some cool synthesizing and a heavy bass drum that's accentuated by handclaps (real ones this time), as well as backup singers who are also bab­bling nonsensical syllables. In the middle of the song, Kranz, who is playing the banjo, has a kind of duel with the drums. When this climaxes, both Kranz and the drums simultaneously do a soaring drum roll that slams -bam!-right back into the dance groove. Nonstop fun and nuttiness is what this song is all 
about. It's definitely the best track on Breakin' 2. 
That leaves seven other songs, and they aren't much to hear. The worst among these is "Gotta Have the Money," by Steve Donn. It's a horrifyingly insipid tune rambling on about how you need money If "you want to get the honey." The musical portion is equally as lame,

Valentine's Day-for lovers and legends 
Sharon Hook 
features staff writer 
Y
ou've heard, ofcourse, ofthe Grinch who Stole Christmas. I was almost the Grouch who Stole Valentine's Day. 
Last night, I was feeling com· 
pletely disillusioned with 
Valentine's Day and the commer· 
cialism that surrounds it. So, I gath· 
ered up aU the valentines on north 
quad and climbed to the top of 
Nieuland to dump them. 
Then I paused and put a hand to 
my ear. Asound came rising over 
the snow. 
Four men in black tuxedos were 
singing a love song. I hadn't stopped 
Valentine's Day from coming. It 
came without lace, without roses or 
cards. It came without lollipops, 
candy or bards. And then I thought 
ofsomething I hadn't before. Maybe 
Valentine's Day doesn't come from 
a store. 
Perhaps Valentine's day means a 
little bit more. 
I have long grappled with the 
meaning ol Valentine's Day. When I asked studt·nts to cummelll on Valentine's D:!'' ' heard such things as, "It comes around every February 
14th," "It's a hell ofa time to kiss a girl," "I love it because it's for Lovers," and "It's a good excuse to tell someone how you feel about them when you're too chicken the 
rest ofthe year." 
Thus,iftoday turns out to be a typical Valentine's Day, flowers will be sent, cards exhanged, and words oflove will be in the air. 
Besides wondering · why your roommate and not you, you may be wondering how February 14th came to be the extravaganza that it is. Who was Valentine and why is this his day? 
Actually there wasn't one St. Valentine, but three. Two from Rome and a third who suffered in Africa (ofwhom nothing more is known). Ofthe first two, one was the Bishop ofInteramna (the 
present-day Terni ). Bishop Valentine lived under the reign of EmporerJulian-a time when Chris· tians were persecuted mercilessly. He strengthened those under him in true faith and showed tremen· dous benevolence to the poor. It is said that one cold night Valentine passed a naked beggar on the street and took off his own garments to give to the man. Soon after, an angel appeared and told the bishop that the man had been Christ who had taken the form only to test Valentine. For his kind deeds, Valentine was granted several graces, one ofwhich was the gift of curing diseases such as epilepsy. When the Roman Governor Placidus discovered that Valentine had cured two people of their il· loesses, he had him scourged and thrown in prison. When Valentine did not weaken under these punish· ments Placidus had him beheaded. 
The other man who deserves recognition on this feast day is Valentine, a priest at Rome. This Valentine lived during the reign of Emporer Claudius. He was well known at the time for his high­
spirited personality. Even the Em· 
porer wanted to be Valentine's 
friend but Valentine was too eager 
to praise the name ofthe Christian 
God and proclaim the Roman gods 
as false. 
As a result, Valentine was accused ofsacrilege and was at length be· headed. Before his death, however, Valentine cured the judges daughter ofher blindness and con· verted the judge and his entire family to Christianity. 
As far as the traditional associa· ti.on oflove and expression oflove on Valentine's day goes, there are a couple oflegends that may be ex· planatory. It was a conventional beliefin England and France during the Middle Ages that on February the 14th, halfway through the second month of the year, the birds begin to pair. 
·Thus Valentine's day became a day for lovers and the perfect time to send tokens oflove. 
In Rome, when the Christians finally took over, they chose feast days to coincide with some existing Roman holidays. Valentine's Day comes close to Lupercalia, February 15th, a feast honoring a couple of Roman deities. 
During the Roman celebration, the names ofyoung Roman women were put in a box and drawn by young men. The chosen lady was considered to be "going steady" with the boy who picked her. Chris· tian Romans maintained the Valentine box custom. But instead ofdrawing girls' names, they drew the names ofsaints that they were to emulate for the coming year. But it seems drawing girls' names was more fun. The Roman youth reverted to the original custom. It has survived in the form ofschool· room Valentine boxes, for some 2000 years. 
Whatever the legend, whatever the reasons, Valentine's Day seems to be the one day on which our society condones madness. So, go a little crazy. It is a wonderful excuse to recklessly proclaim ones affec· tion. Despite all dangers, one can say, "It's Valentine's Day and I love you."

Irish determined to make meet 
Women go to NSC championships 
By MARY SIEGER 
!)ports Writer 
Neither ice nor snow nor gloom of traveller's advisories can keep them from this meet -the meet billed as the highlight of their season. 
Despite treacherous weather con­ditions, members ofthe Notre Dame women's swim team left for St. Louis, Mo., yesterday afternoon to com­pete in the North Star Conference Championship meet which starts today. The Irish geared their entire season toward this meet and were unwilling to let a little snow get in their way. 
Notre Dame is ranked at the top in the North Star Conference and is the Conference's defending champion. 
Last year, Notre Dame dominated the championship meet and is hoping to repeat its performance this weekend. 
The Irish compiled an impressive 11-1 record in the regular season giving them confidence for this weekend's competition. The only blemish in Notre Dame's record came last semester when the Irish lost to a tough scholarship squad from Bowling Green University. 
Sub-zero temperatures cancelled a dual meet in late january with Ball State University, one of Notre Dame's fiercest rivals. The meet was never rescheduled since both te.tms were booked until the end of the season. 
"I'm disappointed because it would have helped us get ready for the Conference meet," said Notre Dame head coach Dennis Stark ...It would have been a very close meet." 
The team's goal at the beginning of the season was to build its pro­gram and improve last season's 6-5 record. This year's 11-1 record and convincing victories over teams who defeated the Irish last year reflects the team's development. 
..We have more depth this year," explained Stark . ..There is no ques­tion of improvement because of the depth factor." 
Junior co-captain Venette Coc­hiolo will guide the Irish during this weekend's meet. Meanwhile, sopho­more distance swimmer Suzanne Devine and freshman Amy Dar­lington will pace the team's attack. 
Men try to continue winning streak 
By KEVIN HERBERT 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's swimming team will try to extend its six-meet winning streak when it participates in the Midwest City Conference meet t<>iiay through Saturday. 
Notre Dame will be competing against seven other Midwestern schools, including St. Louis, Xavier, Valparaiso, Loyola (Chicago), Evansville, Butler and Oral Roberts. 
The Irish come into the meet swimming better than ever. Last weekend they swept a triple-dual meet over Vincennes, St. Louis and Xavier, and in the process the team set no less than 1 0 new season 
record~. 
Notre Dame will carry its six-meet winning streak and its 7-4 record into the Conference meet in St. Louis today, trying to dethrone last year's champions, Evansville. 
In this meet one year ago Notre Dame finished a strong second. As Coach Dennis Stark explains, it is going to be more difficult for the Irish to finish second or higher in the Conference meet this year. 
..We would like to win the meet," said Stark. ..However, since we graduated nine players from last year's squad, we are not as strong as we were a year ago." 
The meet begins in St. Louis at 
9:30 this morning and will continue through Saturday when the finals begin at 7 p.m. 
If the Irish are to challenge Evansville and their other oppo­
nents, then their dependable swim­
mers will have to perform up to par. 
"Our dependable people are going to have to come through for us," said Stark...People like Mike Kennedy, Paul Bens and co-captains Tim Bohden and Brian Casey are going to have to swim their best if we are to be successful in the Con­ference meet." 
Last year the Notre Dame swim team finished second behind Evansville in the eight-team Mid­west City Conference meet. Today the Irish will again take to the pool in search of a conference champion­ship. 
Minus nine quality swimmers who graduated last year, Notre Dame may find it very difficult to repeat its second-place finish of a year ago.

Water polo team in rebuilding year 
As the Notre Dame water polo team enters its sixth 
season, the club finds itself in a rebuilding year. A year ago the club placed fourth in the Midwestern water polo con­ference, which consists of 20 teams -both clubs and var­sity teams. 
Gone from that team are goalie Chris Packer, the only Irish player to achieve first team all-conference honors, and former captainJohn Smith. Therefore, junior captain Michael Roberts and fellow juniorsJohn-Coffey and Tom O'Reilly have the task of rebuilding a young inexperi­enced team. 
"We don't have any seniors on the team this year, so there will be considerable pressure on John, Tom, and I to be the leaders both in and out of the pool," said Roberts. "However, we are all looking forward to next year because our improvement and experience will once again make us one ofthe better teams in the conference." 
Last fall the team played conference foes throughout the Midwest and also traveled to Virginia, Washington, D.C., and New York to play interconference games. In all, the team compiled a record of nine wins and 12 losses. 
"The level of water polo is steadily improving in the Midwest," said Roberts." Many teams in our conference are becoming varsity and in the near future, we must also make that transition in order to maintain our com­petitiveness. And with the new pool, the athletic depart­ment's interest in upgrading our status to varsity looks promising." 
The team itself has many standouts. Roberts led the team in scoring for the third staight year, netting 86 goals this season. Sophomore Steve Gauther also was a major factor in the offensive, scoring 55 goals. On the defensive side, Coffey and O'Reilly are the major components. And Matt Dolan, a high s~hool All-American, will add depth to the Irish line-up. 

The team has started practicing for its spring season, 
which begins with a home tournament in the Rockne 
Memorial during the second week of March. 
ROWING CLUB: With the Rowing Club competing in the Mid-Winter Classic in Madison, Wise., senior John Younger captured first place in the five-mile race on the rowing machine. Younger, rowing in the varsity lightweight division, won the event in a time of8:17. 
The club itself has been training in the Rockne and the ACC in preparation for the season which starts after spring break. During the season, 80 of the 100 members ofthe club wil train in Texas. 
SKIING CLUB: With the regional meet completed last weekend, the ND/SMC skiing team hopes for the tele­phone call that will tell them that they are invited to the Invitational Meet in the Upper Peninsula. 
In the giant slalom on Saturday,Tony Jordan, John O'Donovan, Julie Currie, K.K. Meyer, and Sheila Smiggen qualified for the afternoon race in which only the top six finishers from the morning run could participate. OnSun­day,Jordan, Currie and Smiggen, as well as Chris Simonet, Kateri Gaffney, and Usa Hamann qualified for the after­noon meet. Jordan was the only one to place, finishing third in the duals.

Notre Dame, Faust have another quality recruiting year 
By TRISH SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
With a good portion ofthe season over with and the race for an NCAA tournament birth getting heated, the major news in college ath­letics comes not from the hardwood ofbasket­ball, but rather from the gridiron of football. Yesterday, Feb. 13, was the official "National Letter of Intent" day in which top high school prospects make the major decision on where to play out their collegiate years. 
For the past four years, Notre Dame's ac­quired corps have impressed the recruiting experts, and once again, Gerry Faust and his staff appear to have nabbed some blue­chippers for the Golden Dome. 
"We have some real quality kids and quality players coming here," comments Faust. "We are a little dissappolnted in the lack of defen­sive linemen this year. We wanted a least four, but so far only really got one." 
But Faust certainly can't be disappointed with the acquistion ofone defensive player in particular. AII·America linebacker Ned Bolcar, a 6-2, 21 0-pounder from Phillipsburg, N. )., decided late Tuesday to attend Notre Dame. Bolcar was the co-player ofthe year for Parade magazine. Most recruiting experts have said 
that getting Bolcar makes a recruiting year go from good to great. 
Faust must also be smiling upon hearing that D'Juan Francisco (brother of Irish defen­sive back Hiawatha) a 5-11, 180-pound Cin­cinnati native has opted for the Irish also. Francisco also was named to the Parade maga­zine list. 
Faust also commented on the lack of a recruit in the fullback position. "We wanted a fullback, but we only found a couple that really fit the mold of what we wanted. And then it was difficult to get them either academically or from other colleges." 
The coaches did end up with a California back who can also fill in at the defensive back position. Mark Green, out of Riverside Poly, gained over 1,300 yards during his career and impresses the coaches with his enthusiasm in helping out the squad in any way he can. 
However, half of the 24 Irish recruits were recruited as offensive players. Vying for the backup position to Steve Beuerlein will be an­other Steve, Steve Belles, a 6-3, 190-pounder from Phoenix, Ariz., and Pete Graham, a 6-2, 190-pound, Rumson, NJ. native. Some oftheir potential targets will be Steve Alantz (6-2, 
185) from Edinburg, Texas, and St. Louis product Ray Dumas ( 6-2, 175 ). Both are being looked to at the wide receiver slot. 
Upon losing tight ends Mark Bavaro and Ricky Gray to graduation, Faust has found two prospects for their shoes. Ted Fitzgerald (6-5, 232 ), hailing from Wayne, N.J., and Richard Morrison ( 6-4, 222 ), from Lynchburg, Va., will both be given opportunities to show their colors in the fall. 
Notre Dame has beefed up its line again for next season with a well-rounded crop of de­fensive and offensive linemen. On the offen­sive side, there are nearby Chicago natives Steve Bynum ( 6-4, 225) and Tom Gorman ( 6­5, 225 ); out of the South Notre Dame has received a 6-6, 240-pounder from Fairfax, Va., Andy Heck, and Bob Hodge, a 6-6, 270-pound Atlanta native. The Irish also heard from the heart of Texas where Dallas standout Steve Huffman has committed. Huffman (6-4, 220) is familar with the Notre Dame scene as his two brothers, Dave and Tim, played for the Irish in the late 70s. Hitting the Midwest, Faust nabbed Youngstown, Oh., recruit Joe Kelty (6-6, 270). And Faust rounded out his cross­country excursion by signing Philadelphia's talent in the form of 6-6, 255-pound Chuck Killian and 6-6, 270-pound Marty Lippincott. 
On the defensive side of the coin, the Faust staff has worked to fill in the lack of experi­ence in the defesive backfield. From the far west, The Irish will welcome Spokane, Wash., 
player, Aaron Robb (6-1, 190). From Chicago, 6-3, 195-pound George Streeter will try to find a position on the Irish roster. And a Rochester, N.Y., native with a unique title, Corny Southall (6-2, 180)will certainly con· tribute his best. 
Rounding out the list of Irish recruits are four players being tabbed as linebackers. They are Craig Hudson (6-1, 210), out of Cindn­nati; Mark Nigro (6-3, 220), from Villa Park, Ill.; Steve Roddy (brother of Irish player Marty) a 6-3. 215-pound Harlesyville, Pa., native; and finally, Kurt Zackrison ( 6-4. 21 5 ), hailing from Chicago. 
The official list ofplayers who have actually signed will not be published until the end of the week, due to the request of the Admis· sions Office. All the potential signees must go through the formalities first. But this list does appear to be accurate as to the roster of recruits. Certainly it appears that Coach Faust and his staff have once again compiled a top· notch list. But ofcourse, Faust will be the first to stress one very important point about recruits. 
"We really won't know just how well we did until they put on those gold helmets and the Irish uniform."

Irish dominate boards, cruise to 79-54 victory over Privateers in ACC 
ByNICK SCHRANTZ 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's basketball team furthered its claim as one ofthe leading rebounding teams in college basketball by outrebounding the Universiry of New Orleans Privateers, 62-3I, last night at the ACC. 
Although beset by poor shooting, the Irish's strength on the boards propelled them to an easy 79-54 vic­tory. 
The Irish shot only 4I percent from the floor and 65 percent at the free throw line. 
Despite the poor shooting, the Irish stlll outshot the Privateers. 
New Orleans could only connect on only one-third ofits attempts, hit­ting a mere 2I-of-63, for 33 percent. 
"I'm not satisfied with our outside shooting, or our shooting at all, when we're shooting 41 percent," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps. "I think defensively we're pretty solid, when we hold a team to 33 percent shooting. That really helps us. 
"Obviously we just dominated on the boards, and that's where we scored the points, on the missed shots." 
The Irish got off to a fast start on the strength of two Donald Royal rebound baskets, and led by an 8-I tally with only two minutes gone in the game. 
led 46-30 with 18 minutes still to 
play. 
With II minutes to play, Rivers 
sank a jumper from the top of the 
key to give the Irish a 58-38 lead. A 
minute later joe Price sank an IS­
footer to give the Irish a 60-40 lead, 
and the Privateers could never cut 
the gap to under 20 the rest of the 
way. 
Price missed the first three shots 
he took in the game, but he came 
back after the intermission with I 3 
second-half points to lead the team 
with 17 points overall. 
Price's outside shooting forced the Privateers to play him honest and not sag into the middle, which pleased Phelps. 
"He (Price) missed his first three shots and we took him out and got him back in, and he ends up with I 7 points," Phelps said. "I think it's be­cause we believe in him, and when he gets in a groove he just puts it in. He played a very, very good game, probably one of the best games he's played." 
With Barlow in foul trouble and the game turning into a runaway, Phelps was able to experiment and give some of his younger players some valuable playing time. 
Freshman center Gary Voce came off the bench to pull down nine rebounds and add five points, despite playing just I3 minutes. Voce played with such intensity that
