University vvelcoiTies 3 provosts 
By TERESA FRALISH 
Associate News Editor 
The University named replacements this summer for its three departing associate provosts, all of whom are assuming greater administra­tive responsi­bilities at either Notre Dame or Saint Mary's. 
Two of the new associate provosts. Jean Ann Linney and Christine Maziar, come from outside t h e University. and the third, Dennis Jacobs, served previ­ously as a chemistry professor at Notre Dame. 
"It's a chal­lenge, but it also adds new insight and vitality," Provost Nathan Hatch said of the changes occurring in his office.

US revokes visa for Ramadan 
Decision bars Muslim scholarfrom teaching at Notre Dame 
By CLAIRE HEININGER News Editor 
Drawing a national spotlight to the University and dealing a painful blow to the Kroc Institute for Peace Studies. the State Department has revoked the visa of Tariq Ramadan, a prominent but contro­

versial Muslim schol­ar scheduled to begin teaching at Notre Dame Tuesday. 
Hired last spring to 


raise the pro-Ramadan me and diver­sify the curriculum of the Kroc Institute, Ramadan was initially granted a visa after passing a thorough investigation by both the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department. However, his per­mission to work in the United States was revoked July 28 for reasons not revealed to the University. 
Homeland Security spokesman Dean Boyd would not comment on the specifics of the decision to bar Ramadan, a Swiss citizen who had been scheduled to teach Islamic philosophy and ethics beginning this fall at Notre Dame. But Boyd said visas are typically revoked when a nonciti­zen poses a potential national security threat or a public safety risk -two suggestions that the University immediately denied. 
"We know of no reason why he shouldn't be allowed in," Notre Dame spokesman Matt Storin 
said. "If we did, we wouldn't  
have hired him."

No evidence found in sexual assault inquiry 
Hospital tests reveal female student was not sexually attacked 
By CLAIRE HEININGER 
News Editor 
Medical tests conducted on a female Notre Dame student who awoke naked near an abandoned home Saturday morning -lead­ing Notre Dame Security/Police to issue a campus-wide e-mail alert that afternoon -revealed no evi­dence of sexual assault, St. Joseph County Police Department spokes­woman Jaimee Thirion said Tuesday. 
"[The incident] was originally investigated as a potential rape but was not," Thirion said, adding that she was unaware of the stu­dent's blood alcohol content upon checking in to the hospital. "There was no evidence that she was attacked." 
The student, whose last memo­ry of the night was dancing at the Linebacker Lounge, awoke in a yard adjacent to the athletic fields east of campus and requested the tests after realizing that her clothes were missing and discov­ering bruises on her body, said Thirion. Hospital officials, who are required to report all rape exami­nations to police, notified St. Joseph County authorities, prompting them to contact NDSP.

what it means now, 
News Editor 

to be a square peg in a round hole. The air in my room felt stale; the scraps of paper and memory plastering its walls seemed to be yellowing prema­turely. Catching up with many of my old friends was like being introduced to a group of strangers, as I was stuffed into a mold that I had shattered long before. 
Suffocating in the hand-me downs of a former life, I saw no possibility of reprieve in the summer ahead, and no purpose at all to the hard-won changes. 
And then, a post office burnt down. 
A literal trial by fire, the day the Warrendale Post Office went up in !lames was the first time I was able to fully appreciate the work freshman year had done on me. I was an intern at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, mainly relegat­ed to writing llulTy features for the weekly Suburban living section, when I was sent out to report breaking news. It was a consequence of being in the right place at the right time under the only editor who would trust a newly-minted freshman with a front page article, and it petrified me. 
Putting on a brave front, I made my way to the scene, feeling smaller and younger than ever as I clutched a note­book and pen in one hand, and a cell phone for desperate calls for help to my editor in the other. The area was swarming with reporters. many of whom I had watched on the nightly news for as long as I could remember. and hose water from the 10 fin~ trucks on the scene was flooding the street. 
Wet up to my knees, I sloshed around for a lead. Expecting everyone to ignore the teenager playing grown-up, I was shocked to find that people actually talked to me and treated me as an equal. Of course, some of the firemen were more inclined to give me a com­ment than the middle-aged male reporters, but other than that I was treated no differently. 
My confidence grew as I continued to blanket the scene, and during each interview I inwardly thanked every per­son and situation-no matter how try­ing-that gave me the maturity to han­dle what was being thrown at me. 
A whirlwind of hours later I was sit­ting in the parking lot of the Post­Gazette, my story filed, my hands clutch­ing the steering wheel and my resources tapped dry. But the burden of expecta­tion and stress I felt at the prospect of being published wasn't choking me; on the contrary, it was a great relief. The growing pains seemed justified, and rid­ing out the rest of the summer wasn't such a bleak prospect, now that I knew that it wasn't all in vain. 
Cured of my claustrophobia and in desperate need of a shower, I was ready to go home.

ND, SMC continue ca1npus construction over summer 

Clockwise: The completed Opus Hall apartments at Saint Mary's, the Jordan Hall of Science at Notre Dame and the Notre Dame security and post office facility are part of a construction boom for 2004. 
By KATE ANTONACCI News Writer 
Though most of the Notre Dame stu­dent body was absent, campus was all but silent over the summer as construc­tion crews busily worked to prepare for the 2004 school year. 
While the most visible fruit of these labors is the new Marie P. DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts, other developments also took shape. 
James Lyphout, vice president for business operations, said the 150,000 square foot performing arts building, which first broke ground in Oct. 2001 and cost an estimated $62.6 million, was finished earlier this summer. 
"Faculty moved in on July 1 and everything is on time and on schedule," he said. adding that there will be an official ceremonial dedication in late September or early October. 
Though the new performing arts building houses many offices and class­rooms, the main venues include a con­cert hall, a center theatre, an organ and chorale concert hall, a cinema and a studio theatre. 
Construction continued this summer on the new security and post office facility, located near Stepan Center, which will be finished in late December or early January. 
Also underway is the Guglielmino Family Athletics Center, located east of Rolf's Sports Recreation Center. This 100,000 square foot building will house a variety of facilities for varsity athletes, notably a 25,000 square foot strength and conditioning center, according to the University Architect Web site. 
Lyphout added that the new Jordan Hall of Science, which will contain lab space for undergraduates, as well as an observatory, greenhouse and herbari­um, should be finished by the summer of 2006. 
The completion of the performing arts center and the developments made on other construction projects represent the first significant progress since budg­et cuts and a decreased endowment forced the University to cut back on all construction projects, with the excep­tion of Legends, in recent years. 
"These buildings are primarily fund­ed, with the exception of the security/post office building, by benefac­tion and those gifts have allowed these buildings to move forward," Lyphout said. 
Students at Saint Mary's also returned to campus to find completed student apartments, which were finished less than a year after the College broke ground. 
"The Opus Hall apartments at Saint Mary's were finished the first week of August and all 72 beds are filled," said Nick Farmer, the director of marketing communications at St. Mary's. "The new apartments offer the independence of off-campus living to senior students." 
Construction is also underway on the new Student Center at the College, which, if all goes as planned, will be ready for use by mid-March, said Farmer. He added that Saint Mary's is also considering building a new aca­demic facility, though construction will not begin until fundraising is finalized.

SMC naines Pierce nevv associate dean of faculty 
By KELLY MEEHAN NewsWrirer 
Saint Mary's political science profes­sor Patrick Pierce, who spent the last year serving as director of the College's Strategic Plan, was named Associate Dean of Faculty and director of the Center for Academic Innovation. 
As the associate dean, Pierce will extend his planning responsibilities to faculty and curriculum development. He said he hopes to earn further financial support for the academic life of the College by enhancing the array of grants that support faculty research, teaching, student learning and research. 
"Faculty and students work very hard at Saint Mary's College," Pierce said. "As a college we need to celebrate and rec­ognize those achievements. Additionally, we need to provide support so that fac­ulty and students can continue to excel."

Pullout plan moves forward 
JERUSALEM -Israel's defense minister, undaunted by growing resistance within the ruling party to a planned pullout from the Gaza Strip, said Tuesday that the army's blueprint for the withdrawal will be ready next month. 
Gaza settlers charged that the government is already preparing to throw them out of their homes. 
Also Tuesday, Israel's attorney general urged the government to consider adopting an international convention governing the treatment of residents in occupied lands. This showed increased Israeli sensitivity to international criticism, particularly in the aftermath of a world court ruling against its contentious West Bank separation barrier. 
The barrier and the Gaza withdrawal are hallmarks of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's "disengagement" plan, which he says is meant to reduce friction between Israel and the Palestinians. 
Najaf Shiite insurgency weakens 
NAJAF. Iraq -A Shiite insurgency appeared to be weakening Tuesday night as Iraqi forces moved to within 200 yards of the revered Imam Ali Shrine and Iraq's defense minister once again demanded fighters loyal to a radical cleric surrender or face a violent raid. 
The militant force, which once waged fierce battles with U.S. troops throughout the Old City and Najaf's vast cemetery, seemed considerably diminished in number and less aggressive after days of U.S. airstrikes and relentless artillery pounding. 
In Baghdad, assailants bombed the con­voys of two government ministers in sepa­rate attacks that killed five people and a sui­cide bomber, but left the ministers unharmed, officials said.

Senior officials faulted in abuses 
WASHINGTON-U.S. soldiers running the Abu Ghraib prison are mainly to blame for the inmate abuses there, but fault also lies with the Pentagon's most senior civilian and military officials, according to a report released Tuesday by an independent panel of civilian defense experts. 
Senior leaders did not establish clear guidelines on permissible techniques for interrogating various categories of prisoners held at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere in Iraq, the report said. 
High-level commanders failed to shift resources to an understaffed and ill-trained prison detention unit once it became appar­ent that the system was out of control, the report said.

WASHINGTON -Avoiding potential jail time, a Time magazine reporter has given a statement to prosecutors investigating the Bush administration leak of a covert CIA offi­cer's identity.

President's campaign attorney discloses relationship with anti-Kerry veterans 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON A lawyer for President Bush's re-election campaign dis­closed Tuesday that he has been providing legal advice for a veterans group that is challenging Democratic Sen. John Kerry's account of his Vietnam War service. 
Benjamin Ginsberg's acknowledgment marks the second time in as many days that an individual associated with the Bush­Cheney campaign has been connected to the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, which Kerry accuses of being a front for the Republican incumbent's re­election effort. 
The Bush campaign and the veterans' group say there is no coordination. 
The group "came to me and said, 'We have a point of view we want to get into the First Amendment debate right now. There's a new law. It's very compli­cated. We want to comply with the law, will you keep us in the bounds of the law?"' Ginsberg said. "I said yes, absolutely, as I would do for anyone."

Provosts 
continued from page 1 
ciate provost and current Saint Mary's President, announced last winter her decision to depart Notre Dame and take leadership of the College. The search expanded following the Board of Trustees' decision in April to appoint Father John Jenkins the next University president and name John Affleck­Graves executive vice president. 
Linney replaces Mooney, who became president of Saint Mary's June 1. Maziar fills the position vacated by Affleck­Graves and Jacobs takes over for Jenkins, who is preparing to replace University President Father Edward Malloy following the conclusion of the current school year. 
This search was spearheaded by Hatch, who will now have the task of implementing a smooth leadership tran­sition within his office. 
Keeping a focus on undergraduate education 
Undergraduates who complain that the University turns a deaf ear to their concerns stand to gain a strong advo­cate in Jacobs, who was named profes­sor of the year in 2002. Jacobs will over­see undergraduate education, in addi­tion to international study programs. 
"I have tried to understand some of the challenges [undergraduates] face," said Jacobs, who will continue to teach this fall. "I couldn't imagine moving into this role ... if I hadn't had that prior role [as a professor]." 
As a Notre Dame chemistry professor for 16 years, Jacobs combined a focus on chemistry research with concern for quality undergraduate education. He also redesigned a main general chem­istry course to better respond to differ­ent learning styles and student patterns. 
In his new position, Jacobs hopes to continue work on many of these same 
interests. ''I'm carrying the conversation on at a higher level," he said. 
In particular, Jacobs intends to take a close look at the purpose of the under­graduate curriculum and evaluate its ability to meet students' needs, though not necessarily with the intent of mak­ing major revisions. 
"Why should a student need to take two semesters of philosophy?" Jacobs asked. "What are we hoping students will gain from that?" 
In tandem with this effort, Jacobs also intends to focus on improving the quali­ty of course information available to stu­dents. He will also place special empha­sis on discerning how freshmen students 
choose majors and inter­ests, and the factors that influence those deci­sions. 
Building the Notre Dame of the future 
With responsibilities that include budget administration, academ­ic space management and the ten-year plan, "Notre Dame 2010: Fulfilling the Promise," Maziar will help build the Notre Dame of the future, both literally and figuratively. 
"Why should a student need to take two semesters of philosophy? What are we hopping students will gain from that?" 
Dennis Jacobs associate provost 
While being the provost at the University of Minnesota, she also served on Notre Dame's Graduate Program Advisory Council. 
"That kept me abreast of what was happening at Notre Dame," she said. "It caused me to say, this might be a good time for me to be at Notre Dame." 
Hatch had originally contacted Maziar to help recruit new provosts. 
Maziar views Notre Dame as a unique institution and relishes the chance to be a part of it. 
"We can be taken seriously nationally. Other people will take notice of our sue­cess," Maziar said. "[Notre Dame)'s also small enough that we can experiment without all the overhead of a super-size university." 

Maziar also praised Notre Dame's Catholic identity and credited it as a key factor in her acceptance of the new position. 
"I was very active at the Newman [Catholic] Center at Purdue. I have always made a point of ... making the campus parish my home parish," Maziar said. 
Maziar will focus her energy on imple­menting Notre Dame's ten-year plan and creating a delicate balance among a variety of academic goals. 
"We have the opportunity to be very 
thoughtful ... about how we build these [graduate] programs," she said. "They're not sustainable if we sacrifice in any way the quality of undergrad­uate education." 
Strengthening academic life 
Linney comes to Notre Dame from the University of South Carolina, where she served as graduate stud­ies dean prior to chairing the school's psychology department. She will 
ovesrsee faculty promotion, tenure and governance, in addition to diversity efforts. Linney was unavailable for com­ment. 
Hatch said Notre Dame was attracted by Linney's experience with diversity initiatives, including several awards for her efforts in that area. 
"Her work has long dealt with mul­tiracial issues," Hatch said. "I think her greatest strength is that she's a wonder­ful problem solver."

"We are inheritors of a great tradition of a glorious past," Malloy continued. "What will we do with this inheritance that has been passed on to us?" 
Calling Notre Dame a "community of faith, service, and learning," the University President said that as mem­bers of that community, "we are called to be agents of transformation in the Spirit." 
He challenged those attending to build on Father Sarin's dream and carry on the greatness of the Notre Dame tradi­tion. 
"We can recognize the power we rep­resent collectively to do great things," Malloy said. "I pray that together we might be blessed that the gift of the Spirit might give us courage, learning, and strength." 
New and returning students alike, along with members of the Notre Dame faculty and staff, celebrated with Father Malloy and the Holy Cross priests. A pic­nic, accompanied by live music and later fireworks, followed the opening mass and was celebrated on DeBartolo Quad. 
"The mass was a great bond of com­munity spirit at Notre Dame," said fresh­man Brian Brownschidle. 
Another freshman, Kara Fessler, agreed. 
"I think that it was great to see so many people at a mass that wasn't on a Sunday," she said. "It was a great way for the freshmen to see what the Notre Dame community is all about." 
"There is no better way to start off another academic year at a Catholic University than to gather together at mass and offer it up to the Lord," said senior Brad Leeman.

IN BRIEF 
World Bank lends Brazil $1. 2B 
BRASILIA, Brazil -The World Bank announced Tuesday it will lend $1.2 billion to Brazil over the next four years to help protect the environment. 
Vinod Thomas, the World Bank's director for Brazil, said it was the bank's biggest single loan dedicated to protecting the environment of a single country. 
"Given the size of Brazil and the size of the problem and the quality of the government's project, it is a reasonable amount," Thomas said in video link from Washington. 
Brazil's environment minister, Marina Silva, said the money would be used to finance 10 projects ranging from protecting the Amazon rainforest to employing environmental ana­lysts. 
"For us, this is highly relevant," Silva said, adding that the loan should serve to shield environmental projects from any eventual budget cuts. 
Stock action slumps on Wall Street 
NEW YORK -Investors all but ignored another substantial retreat in oil prices Tuesday, leaving stocks mixed in a listless and lightly traded session. Tech stocks fell in response to a brokerage downgrade of Cisco Systems Inc., while blue chips got a boost from an upgrade of Caterpillar Inc. 
Although oil dipped briefly below $45 per barrel during the session, two days of falling prices weren't enough for cautious investors to get back into the market, despite very attractive prices. 
Investors were concerned that oil prices, which topped $49 per barrel late last week but closed down 84 cents at $45.21 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, could advance again. Another sharp rise could raise corporate costs and reduce consumer spend­ing, thus harming third-and fourth-quarter earnings 
"Without any real big economic or geopoliti­cal news here, the market's keying off of oil," said Jay Suskind, head trader at Ryan Beck & Co. "But we're in the dog days of August here, so there's just not going to be a lot of volume or conviction here."

Metal beer bottles made available 
Pittsburgh Brewing Company asks $1 more per case for beer that stays colder 
Associated Press  
PITTSBURGH ~ How  
much would you pay for a  
bottle of beer that stays  
cold nearly an hour  
longer?  
Pittsburgh Brewing Co.,  
maker of Iron City Beer, is  
asking an additional $1  
per case.  
The brewery has part­ 
nered with Alcoa Inc., the  
world's largest aluminum  
maker, to produce alu­

50 minutes longer than a

Department, the Department of Homeland Security asked offi­cials to "invalidate the petition on which [Ramadan's] visa was based," said State Department press officer Darla Johnson. Johnson cited Section 221 (a) (3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which includes tightened immigration restric­tions under the post-September 11 USA Patriot Act, but would not provide any additional infor­mation. 
Ramadan's situation was kept silent from the public while Notre Dame worked to resolve it, University spokesman Matt Storin said. Ramadan previously taught at the College of Genevva and the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. 
While Starin said the University did anticipate possi­ble delays in Ramadan's approval due to increased secu­rity measures nationwide ­especially as pre-election buzz has centered on terrorism alerts -the scholar's previous visits to the country, including four visits to Notre Dame for lectures and job interviews, had been without incident. As a European citizen, Ramadan travels freely across the Atlantic, but has now been forbidden from accepting an appointment to work in the United States. His tenured, chaired position at Notre Dame was to have formally begun in mid-August, Starin said. 
"The fact that it was revoked at the 11th hour seems like a calculated political move by his opponents," Kroc director Scott Appleby said. 
Ramadan's opponents are in no short supply. Accused by Jewish groups in France and the United States of spreading anti­Sematic and Islamic militant ideas, Ramadan stirred further debate following the news of his appointment at Notre Dame. With a reputation for engaging in intellectual discourse with Muslim groups that "aren't sold on the idea that democratic soci­eties that value freedom are consistent with Islam," Appleby said his new hire raised eye­brows-but never suspicions. 
"Some people think he's insin­cere and he's trying to import militant Islam into American society, but obviously those of us on the faculty who supported his appointment do not feel this way," Appleby said. "We certain­ly knew that he is a controver­sial figure, but that in itself did­n't deter us because we judged him on the basis of his ideas." 
These ideas, while not always popular among Ramadan's peers, were always "within range of reasonable academic discourse," Appleby said, prais­ing Ramadan's appetite for open dialogue between faiths. 
"He encourages [Muslim groups] to enter into and help shape democratic society," Appleby said. "He also wants 'Western' societies to . . . make room for and respect religious practices and religious beliefs that are not secular, are not Christian, are not Jewish." 
While Kroc Islamic scholar Rasheed Omar serves as his immediate replacement in Islamic Ethics, a sophomore seminar that was the sole course he was scheduled to teach this semester, Ramadan remains in limbo in Geneva, Switzerland, Starin said. He added that while the University has made inquiries in Washington since the visa was invalidated, there has been no indication of when or how the situation will be resolved. 
However, Boyd noted that Ramadan has the option to reapply and argue his case with State Department ofllcials. 
Appleby, who spoke with Ramadan Tuesday but could not provide an official comment from the scholar, remained hopeful that he would eventually arrive at Notre Dame. 
"We ultimately have to have some faith in the fairness of our system," Appleby said. "At this point we're holding out for that." 
The Observer was unable to contact Ramadan.

Search for Boy Scout continues 
Associated Press 
SALT LAKE CITY -The search for a missing 12-year-old Boy Scout in a mountainous area of Utah was officially labeled a recovery operation Tuesday as authorities all but gave up hope of fmding the boy alive. 
"This is a great loss for my family right now," the boy's father, Kevin Bardsley, told reporters. 
Garrett Bardsley was last seen Friday morning, when his father sent him back to camp after the boy got his shoes and pants wet while fishing in a pond near a lake. The campsite has been described variously as 150 yards to a quarter mile from the lake on a well-established path. 
Dozens of searchers have spent the last three days search­ing for Garrett, who was wear­ing sweat pants, a T-shirt and a black hooded sweat shirt and tennis shoes. He had no food or backpack. 
The search has been ham­pered by cold, wet weather. Rain mixed with snow fell on searchers Monday, and the tem­perature plunged to 18 degrees overnight. On Tuesday, the high hovered around 50 degrees, said Sheriff Dave Edmunds. 
The official search likely will tail off by the end of the week, Edmunds said, "but we're never going to stop looking."

FRANCE 
Parisians fete 60 
years of liberation 
Associated Press 
PARIS-The Champs-Elysees, free at last, was awash with wild joy on Aug. 25, 1944. But deep in the heart of France the war raged on, with Frenchmen killing Frenchmen to aid a desperate Germany. 
And now, 60 years later, the people who suffered most are among the staunchest supporters of a new Europe in which France and Germany are, essentially, just two members of a 25-nation super-state. 
"This is the great triumph of the 21st century," said Jean­Marie Delabre, 81. "Peace is accepting the idea that you must live with others and forge natural differences into something stronger." 
He added: "I don't think I'd have said that a few years after the war." While Paris celebrated, his Resistance unit fought on near Dijon. Captured, he was in German prison camps until armistice in May 1945. 
With time, Delabre decided that since wars are much easier to start than to finish, the only answer is to avoid them. 
"A united Europe is a lesson for the rest of the world," he con­cluded. 
War that left millions dead had not only pitted France against its ancient neighbor and foe, it also forced deep divisions among the French themselves. Some resis­ted, but many col­laborated.

increased the bit­terness and deep­ened divisions between collabo­rators and real Frenchmen." 
As allies pushed toward Paris, he said, he watched the French milice, militiamen loyal to Germany, sweep into the prison yard to deal with three captured French Resistance fighters. 
"I could hear it all from my cell," he said. "The three were tried, sentenced, lined up against a wall and shot. The whole thing was over in less than an hour. Such things went on all the time." 
But today, like nearly every one of dozens of veterans interviewed by The Associated Press, he laud­ed efforts to meld ancient foes into a modern union. "We have to stop old stupid rivalries," he said. 
People who remember Aug. 25, 1944, are celebrating it with a bittersweet mix of emotions. For many, the horror and humiliation of occupation did not sink in until years, ifnot decades, later. 
"When it ended, we had all more important things to worry about, like finding our family members and repairing our lives," Delarue said. "Only later did we have the luxury of analyz­ing things." 
Almost immediately, the French army was off extinguish­ing colonial brush fires in Asia and Africa, including a war that spread in Vietnam and ended only in 1954. 
Although liberators found Germans had mined the bridges over the Seine, it was 20 years before most people realized the danger Paris had faced. 
Larry Collins, co-author of "Is Paris Burning?", told the AP his idea for the book came only in 1962 after he saw an item in a London newspaper about Hitler's obsession with obliterating the City of Light. 
"Before then. hardly anyone knew of the threat Paris had faced and how narrowly it escaped," he said. "When we started researching, we found an elaborate plot." 
By then, feelings had mel­lowed. 
"I've never sensed any hostility at all, even when I first came here as a 14-year-old girl in the 1960s," said Sabine Martin, a German businesswoman who lives happily in Paris. 
John Morris, 87, reached Paris five days after Liberation and is still here. He was Life magazine photo editor, and his archives contain the Sept. 11, 1944, edi­tion with the headline: "Paris Is Free Again." 
Charles Wertenbaker wrote, "Paris still looks like Paris -a little dirty and scarred with no irreparable damage. Notre Dame is chipped from machine-gun bullets ... and these scars will merge with the scars of time." 
Still, he noted, the people were desperate: "Pretty women dive 
for cigarette 
butts on the 
Crossing Paris 

under a hail of flowers, he wrote, "I estimate I kissed a thousand females, from 2 to 90 ... For one night, every American was a Lindbergh." 
But joy was tempered with death. Even now, no one knows how many hundreds of service­men and civilians died in the fight for Paris. From one end of the city to the other, plaques recall the victims: men, women and teenagers. 
By the Place de Ia Concorde, fresh flowers grow under a row of 10 marbled plaques in an old stone wall. The first remembers Marcel Bizien, a tank command­er in the French 2nd Armored Division. 
Bizien's tank fought a high­noon duel with a German Tiger on the Champs-Elysees on Aug. 
25. The French gunners destroyed the Nazi tank with a direct hit, but they were killed in the aftermath. 
Jacques Fouet, 81, was a fire­man who in the final days put on an army uniform to hunt down Germans. He watched that tank battle with a mix of pride for a revived France and hatred for Nazis who caused such pain. 
Nowadays, Fouet says he is thrilled to see tight new links between old adversaries. "I have always said that on the day Germany and France come to an understanding, there will be no more war in Europe."

Later Tuesday, Stanislaus County district attorney's office investigator Steven Jacobson tes­tified he set up wiretaps on Peterson's cell phones and received authorization to tap Peterson's mother's phone ­which ultimately was not done. He is due back on the stand Wednesday. 
Prosecutors allege Peterson killed his wife in their Modesto home around Dec. 24, 2002, then dumped her weighted body from a boat into San Francisco Bay. The remains of Laci Peterson and the couple's unborn son washed up a few months later, not far from where Peterson claimed he had gone fishing the day he reported her missing. 
Producer hires m_ob defense lawyer 
Associated Press LOS ANGELES-Music produc­er Phil Spector has hired an attor­ney who used to work for mob boss John Gatti to defend him on murder charges after his previous attorney resigned from the case. Leslie Abramson said Tuesday that she and her co-counsel resigned as Spector's attorneys but were taken by surprise when Bruce Cutler filed a motion to take over the case while Abramson was out of the country. "We were put in an untenable position, and we were forced to resign," Abramson said in a phone interview with The Ao;sociated Press. "If we wanted to be ethical and competent, we had to resign." She declined to elaborate. Cutler, speaking from New York, said he has known Spector for a long time and had signed on as his personal attorney before Abramson and Marcia Morrissey took over the criminal case. "I was engaged as Phillip's attorney and confidante last January," he said. "Leslie and Marcia were brought on in February. and they quit in July. They just jumped ship, and I had to take control of the ship and 
bring it into port." 
Federal prosecutors in New York have portrayed Cutler as "house counsel" for the Gambino crime family. He won three trials for Gotti before prosecutors were able to get him disqualified from the defense team by playing 1990 tape recordings on which he had conversations with Gotti about other defendants. 
Gatti died in prison 

Spector, 64, is free on $1 million bail. 
Abramson was hired in February to replace Spector's original attorney, Robert Shapiro, who was a member of O.J. Simpson's defense team.

Prosecutors present video evidence at trial 
Grainy images show civil rights lawyer conversing with convicted terrorist 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Prosecutors on Tuesday presented the core of their terrorism case against a civil rights lawyer: grainy videos of her meetings with a jailed Egyptian sheik she allegedly helped to com­municate with followers. 
A hidden camera at a fed­eral prison in Rochester, Minn., recorded conversa­tions of lawyer Lynne Stewart, Arabic interpreter Mohamed Yousry and Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, who is serving a life sentence. 
Prosecutors contend the videotaped conversations prove a conspiracy among the three to aid terrorists. Also charged in the case is postal worker Ahmed Abdel Sattar, who had served the sheik as a paralegal and interpreter. 
Authorities have said Stewart and Yousry enabled the sheik to smuggle danger­ous messages to the outside world -despite prison rules severely limiting the sheik's visitors, mail, telephone calls and consultations with lawyers. 
In the videotapes, played on a large screen in federal court in Manhattan, the three can be heard talking about their hopes that keep­ing Abdel-Rahman's name on the world stage might some­day get him freed from prison. 
Stewart represented the 
Wednesday.August25 

sheik at a 1995 trial in which 
he was convicted of conspir­
ing to assassinate Egyptian 
President llosni Mubarak 
and to bomb five New York 
landmarks including the 
United Nations. 
"I think that the whole prosecution, I thought that from the first day, was politi­cally, uh. motivated," Stewart says on a videotape. 
In another spot. Yousry tells the sheik about a group in the Philippines that took hostages. He says a newspa­per story failed to mention the group wanted to free the sheik. 
"And Hamzi Yousef," the sheik adds, referring to the man now imprisoned for life in the United States after he was convicted of master­minding the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six people and injured more than 1,000 others. 
Stewart responds: "Good for them. I didn't read that, either." 
Later, Stewart asks if the group was still holding hostages. 
When told it was, Stewart's comments are in dispute, so the jury got two versions in a transcript. The government version has Stewart saying, "That was a very," a com­ment surrounded by unintel­ligible remarks. 
The defense version has her saying, "That's so sad.... That was a very," followed by an unintelligible remark.

INDIA 
Truck driver strikes send prices soaring 
Associated Press 
NEW DELHI -Prices for food and essential commodi­ties spiraled upward Tuesday as thousands of truck drivers in India ignored a government appeal to call off a four-day­old nationwide strike. 
Meanwhile, in Bombay, India's financial hub, hun­dreds of thousands of bank employees staged a daylong strike to demand higher wages. 
The prices of vegetables, fruit and other foods were up by as much as a third at mar­kets in New Delhi, amid fears the truckers would go through with a threat to stop delivering all food items beginning Wednesday. 
The truckers are protesting a new 10 percent service tax on trucking included in the government budget being con­sidered by parliament. A truckers strike against a simi­lar proposal in 1997 lasted 10 days until the government dropped the tax. 
After three rounds of incon­clusive talks Tuesday, Finance Minister Chidambaram urged truck operators to end the strike, saying it was hurting ordinary citizens. 
"Innocent people should not be made a victim of a totally baseless strike," Chidambaram said. "The gov­ernment is always willing to discuss issues with any section of the people." 
The All India Motor Transport Congress, the largest trade group of truck owners in the country, has threatened to keep its mem­bers' 2.4 million trucks off the roads until November if the government does not with­draw the tax. 
"We have made our stand 
very clear to the government that the issue of service tax ... is not negotiable," B.N. Dhumal, president of the trade group, told Dow Jones Newswires. 
Although fruit and vegetable markets in New Delhi received their regular supplies of pro­duce Tuesday, prices have been rising as shoppers buy up extra food in fear of a pro­longed shutdown. 
"Potatoes were selling for rupees 12 (25 cents) yesterday. Today it's touched 16 rupees. It's the same with all other vegetables," said Neelu Arora, an office worker in the Indian capital. 
In Bombay, while most bank workers stayed home for the day, more than 1,000 marched in a heavy rain, chanting demands for raises while tying up traffic in the business dis­trict for an hour. 
The strike against nine state-run banks was backed by nine major unions whose political affiliations range from Hindu nationalists to leftists to the centrist Congress party, which heads the government. 
The banks have proposed a 
9.5 percent pay raise, but the unions are demanding 16 per­cent, the Press Trust of India news agency said, quoting Lalit Nagda, joint secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association.Marshall, President Harry Truman's emissary. The Associated Press was the only foreign news organization to stay in Yan'an. 
The Chinese had dug their caves in 1938 to house hospi­tals, universities, newspapers and training schools after Japanese air raids reduced the walled city to rubble. The Dixie Mission dug its own caves on arrival in 1944.

SUDAN 
Red Cross announces ITiassive Sudan airlift 
Associated Press 
AL-FASHER The 
International Committee of the 
Hed Cross said Tuesday it was 
mounting a major airlift of relief 
supplies to Sudan's troubled 
Darfur region, its largest such 
operation since the war in Iraq. 
Sudan's interior minister. meanwhile, said a cease-fire with rebel factions in Darfur was vio­lated twice on the opening day of peace talks that aim to bring an end to the crisis. 

The United Nations terms Darfur the world's worst human­itarian crisis. More than 30,000 people have been killed and 1.4 million forced to flee their homes in the 18 months of fighting between African rebel groups and Arab militia known as the Janjaweed. 
Interior Minister Abdel-Hahim Hussein said Monday's attacks by Sudanese Liberation Army fight­ers, which left several police injured, did not bode well for peace talks in Ahuja, Nigeria, which opened the same day. But he insisted the government remains committed to the peace process. 
"It still means we continue the talks because we think the only way to reach a solution is through negotiation," he told The Associated Press after visiting the scene of one attack -a police post responsible for secu­rity at Zam Zam refugee camp, 10 miles south of the regional capital, Al-Fasher. 
He said the second attack was 
on a police car near Tawilah, 35 
miles west of Al-Fasher. 
It was not possible to inde­pendently confirm the attacks or the affiliations of the perpetra­tors. But at Al-Fasher's military air base, two men wearing blue police uniforms, suffering appar­ent leg injuries, lay on stretchers in a room pockmarked with bul­let holes from a rebel attack last year. 
Announcing plans to launch a major airlift to the region, the Red Cross said it was planning six trips carrying trucks, other equipment and medical supplies by Sept. 5. 
"The aim is to improve ICRC access to thousands of people still deprived of urgently needed humanitarian aid and to provide further supplies to meet vital health and water needs," the agency said. 
The peace talks in Nigeria are a last-minute attempt for progress before Monday's U.N. Security Council deadline for Khartoum to disarm the Arab militia accused of terrorizing African farmers or face economic and diplomatic sanctions. 
Earlier Tuesday, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw toured a sprawling desert camp housing 40,000 displaced people and urged the Sudanese govern­ment to do more to make it safe for the frightened refugees to return home. 
CUBA 

Tribunals begin in Guantanamo 
Bin Laden's chauffeur is the first to be charged in military trials 
Associated Press 

GUANTANAMO BAY 
NAVAL BASE -Osama bin 
Laden's chauffeur was for­
mally charged Tuesday at 
the first U.S. military tribu­
nal to convene since World 
War II, and the defendant's 
Iawyer quickly challenged 
the panel over its impartial­
ly and questioned the pro­
ceeding's fairness. 
Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a 34-year-old Yemeni, declined to enter a plea until motions filed by his military­appointed lawyer attacking the legality of the proceed­ing are decided, probably in November. 
Hamdan, who was not shackled and wore a flowing white robe, smiled occasion­ally as he listened to an Arabic interpreter through headphones, even after hearing charges that could bring life in prison: conspir­acy to commit war crimes, including attacking civilians, murder and terrorism. He isn't charged with any spe­cific violent act. 
His lawyer, Lt. Cmdr. Charlie Swift, filed chal­lenges against four of the five panel members, includ­ing the presiding officer, and an alternate, questioning their capacity to serve fairly. The appointing authority, John Altenburg Jr., a 
retired Army general, will 
decide whether any of the 
commission members 
should be removed, but was 
not clear how soon he might 
rule. 

"It is important that these proceedings not only be fair, but appear fair to the world," Swift said during the hearing, which lasted eight hours. 
He challenged the presid­ing officer, Army Col. Peter Brownback, a former mili­tary judge, on the grounds that he came out of retire­ment to serve on the panel and that he is not a standing member of a bar associa­tion. 
Swift raised questions on panel member Marine Col. Jack K. Sparks Jr., citing concerns over Sparks' feel­ings about a reservist under his command who died in the Sept. 11 terror attack on New York's World Trade Center while working as a firefighter. 
He also said he was con­cerned that commission member Marine Col. R. Thomas Bright had said he was in charge of the logis­tics of moving detainees to Guantanamo; that Air Force Lt. Col. Timothy Toomey was an intelligence officer in Afghanistan; and that an alternate, Army Lt. Col. Curt Cooper, expressed strong 
emotions about the 2001 
attacks and concern for the 
safety of himself and his 
family. 
"Clearly the impartiality of these panel members is a concern to us," said Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union who was one of several rights activists observing the hear­ing. 
Hamdan has said he earned a pittance for his family as bin Laden's driver before the Sept. 11 attacks, but denies involvement in terrorism. U.S. officials allege he served as the al­Qaida leader's bodyguard and delivered weapons to his operatives. 
Brownback gave Swift until Oct. 1 to file other motions and said the pros­ectuion would have until Oct. 15 to respond. 
Tribunal members and prosecutors asked the media not to use the names of the panel members, fearing pos­sible retribution. But their names were previously made public and have been published. 
Brownback is the only member of commission to have formal legal training. Asked by Swift whether he thought the proceedings were legal, Brownback said he chose not to answer.

When describing our Notre Dame student body, often the words "disen­gaged" and "apathetic" find their way in the conversation. The attendance of social justice activities and participa­tion in campus demonstrations Kamaria Porter certainly support these descrip­tors, yet I feel 
Breaking the 
this generaliza­
Habit
tion may be too 
hasty. As people 
of consciousness 
and compassion, we all have some­
thing we care passionately about. The 
gamut of concern ranges from our 
own lives to the broader human com­
munity of this planet. While some 
show their passions more overtly, oth­
ers hold back. 
Yet, we are surely a community of overachievers. To be here at this pres­tigious university, ingenuity and dili­gence had to be a part of our charac­ters. So, with such an able student body and injustice all around us to inspire oodles of moral outrage, why do Notre Dame students still get donned as uncaring automatons? 
The more cynical view would suggest the achievements and eminent suc­cesses of many students have hard­ened their hearts to the worries of the outside world. Yet, this damning view only alienates the active crowds from everyone else. Perhaps a closer reflec­tion may offer a better answer. 
We all, as human beings, have some­thing about which we are concerned. Whether it is family, friends, our future, or our descendants, we all have a reason to care for something beyond ourselves and beyond the pres­ent. The gap between caring and action that so many are weary of crossing then points to a sadder truth. Most people do not recognize their own power to change circumstances and are overwhelmed by the wrong they see in the world. This is under­standable in such an individualistic 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 

and money-driven culture. As the rob­ber barons and ruling classes of the present make decisions that dictate our freedoms and fortunes, it is hard to see how a group of compassionate people can influence the course of things. 
Yet, all change and reform through­out history has been the result of countering power with power. Not the destructive power of violent force, for it only tears human bonds down and destroys lives. The appropriate description of power identifies two kinds in our culture -organized money and organized people. The lat­ter-as seen in the legacies of the Civil Bights Movement, Women's Suffrage Movement and countless oth­ers -is the catalyst for real change of which we all can be a part. 
It is important to recognize the power in a group of people organizing to change circumstances. More imper­ative, we must consider the inf1uence inaction has on the course of things. Refusing to aid others in their struggle for justice does more to retard the process than the actions of their oppo­sition. 
Howard Zinn, activist, writer and historian, captures the context in which we should view our power and action in his autobiography, "You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train." The title comes from a phrase Zinn used often in his classes. For him, history is being made everyday. The course of things resembles a moving train, surg­ing toward a foreseeable and some­times negative end. The hope for pre· venting tragedy is inside us -also on the train. We all have the power to act, one way or another, to shift the course of history. Our success compounds when we form coalitions and organiza­tions of concerned people to counter the powers of cynicism and self-inter­est with hope. 
These are times that require us to act. Poverty, hunger and unemploy­ment touch the lives of over 35 million Americans. Job growth is dangerously low, especially in this declared eco­nomic recovery. As high-paying manu­facturing and technical jobs disappear from the American industrial land­scape, people are faced with low pay­ing, labor-intensive service-sector jobs. Many work full-time, yet still qualify for financial government assis· tance. State government budgets have cut funding to valuable social pro· grams -especially education -to make up for ill-structured federal income and corporate tax cuts. 
If you care about the well being of your peers and fellow citizens, you must be a part of a movement to change the course of our moving train. Without action, our collective fortunes will feature more people living without hope and the necessities for survival. We will never be the greatest society if the majority of our citizens struggle to gain the basic needs for life. We will never live up to our charter of freedom if we continue to stifle the voices of our citizens and declare their mes­sages of hope to be unpatriotic. We will never be free from fear if we con­tinue to be a dominating and unwel­come force throughout the world. We cannot secure the future for our descendants if we continue to exploit and pollute this planet. 
From now to November, and for the rest of our lives, we must be on the side of active pursuit of justice. The activist in you exists where the con­cerns of your heart meet the injustice of the world. Do something.

Politics more than petitions 
1 know what you're thinking. "It's the second day of the fall semester, and the last thing I want to do is read a column about politics." 
We've been on campus for a little over a day now, and who knows how Nathan Cobb many times you've been asked to sign a petition for candidate New Mexico so-and-so or sign up Daily Lobo for political group X. 
Couple those inquiries with a sum­mer that boasted an unprecedented volume of political ads, and just about all of us are on political overload. 
But that's the joy of being a college student, right? 
We are the purportedly apathetic section of voters coveted by every political body imaginable. 
Walking around campus like a politi­cal buffet, there's always someone with a clipboard waiting to give you an earful. 
Yes, indeed, we are truly the chosen people of the political recruiting process. The frenzy is only amplified in an election year when so many states will be decided by a couple hun­dred votes. 
We all have our strategies for avoid­ing the petition-wielding army: Wearing headphones even if they don't happen to be playing any music, pre­tending to be in a big hurry and the ever-popular strategy of not making eye contact at any cost. The phone 
, <;~~~s are eyen easier to avoid. Just hang up. After perfecting one of these meth­ods. it gets pretty easy to start dis­missing these political activists. The trouble is, all too often the entire political process gets lumped in with 
them. 
It gets pretty easy to start filling the role of "apathetic young voter." We shut out the clipboarders, we change the channel and we assume issues don't apply to us yet because we're still in school. 
Tax cuts don't mean too much when you're living on Ramen noo­dles and Social Security is a million years away. The direction of U.S. foreign policy can inspire a few heat­ed class­room or coffee­house dis­cussions, but how much do we really care about these issues? All too often, the answer turns out to be: Not enough to vote. 
In the last presiden­tial election, only about one-third of college-age vot­ers got to the polls. Translate that to UNM's student population, and you have roughly 20,000 students not

absent from? The Republican-con­trolled 108th 
Congress has had quite an impact on 
our lives even though we are just 
college stu­dents. 
Congress failed to enact leg­islation that would have increased 
Pell Grant funding allowing 

those recipi­ents to receive almost $5,000 a year in addi­tional funds. Congress failed to amend the No Child Left Behind Act to include a measure to increase funding to pro­grams for Hispanic students, including English as a second lan­
guage programs, migrant education 
and funding for Hispanic-serving Institutions. 
Also, even though young people often choose to ignore issues such as rising federal deficits and the demise of Social Security, those are the types of issues that will plague our genera­tion and our children's generation unless they are kept in check. 
Although we may not always have the time or the desire to talk to every person who approaches us with the familiar, "Hi my name is ... Would you like to take a minute to ...,"that does not mean we can safely dismiss the political process as a whole. 
The people we vote for and the peo­ple who get elected when we fail to vote change our lives in numerous ways. 
From a Republican Congress failing to allocate proper funding to our schools, to Heather Wilson's crusade to strengthen the censorship powers of the FCC, we are greatly affected by the political process. 
There is meaningful political pres­ence on campus. Candidates will be visiting the University throughout the election season, and it is important to note candidates who make a point to prioritize student issues. 
College students have allowed them­selves to be ignored by the White House and the Republican-controlled Congress. The only way to change that is to make our voices heard on Election Day.

Offensive linemen key to Oklahoma's success 
Associated Press 
NORMAN -Oklahoma's greatest asset and the second-ranked Sooners have many might be the players who get the least attention. 
The offensive line that helped clear a path to the Heisman 'Ti"ophy for quarterback Jason White returns intact for Oklahoma. The five starters three seniors and two juniors enter the 2004 season with 133 combined starts. 
"A couple of years ago we were all thrown out there," All-American right tackle Jammal Brown said. "Now we have gelled and we've all been together and know each other. Now we just go out there and do our jobs." 
Brown and center Vmce Carter are the stars of a front wall that averages 6-foot-5 and 308 pounds. Each allowed only one sack last sea.<>on while registering more than 110 knockdown blocks. Around them will be left guard Kelvin Chaisson, right guard Davin Joseph and left tackle Wes Sims. 
Carter is the runt of the group at 6-3, 289 pounds. The others are each over 300 pounds and at least 6-4. 
The line was stellar through most of last season, especially protecting White. The Sooners averaged 42.9 points per game, led by White's 40 touchdown passes and 3,846 yards. 
But in the Sooners' final two games both losses the line got licked by blitzing defenses from Kansas State and lSU. 
Offensive line coach and co­offensive coordinator Kevin Wilson said the improvements his pupils need to make are more mental than physical. 
"It's getting an attitude and an edge and mind-set of how we're going to play up front," Wilson said. "We've got some great skill players to make them look good but we really need to compete." 
The line's job will be to give White enough time to throw down­field to his star wide receiver, Mark Oayton, and give Oklahoma's run­ning backs, prized freshman Adrian Peterson and veteran Kejuan Jones, space to maneuver. 

"With the kind of talent we have in our backfield, if we give those guys a little crease or a little seam, they are going to take it to the house," Carter said. "They all have great speed and are great athletes so it makes us real confident going into the season." 
Oklahoma coaches insist that Peterson, the top-rated high school recruit, must learn the complete offense to supplant Jones as the starter that includes blocking. 
"You don't want a guy who gives it all on a rushing play and then takes off on a passing play," said Chuck Long, Oklahoma's co-offen­sive coordinator. "He's going to be awarded the chance to play. 
"We're not opposed to be playing incoming freshman, but he has to prove himself."

Walsh, May win volleyball gold 
Associated Press 
ATHENS, Greece -They raced to the stands and grabbed American flags as "Born in the USA" blared over the speakers at the Olympics' rowdiest venue. 
Kerri Walsh and Misty May ended a splendid night on the beach with a gold medal, a fit­ting finale for the most dominant run in the history of beach vol­leyball. 
The top-ranked U.S. beach volleyball duo beat second-seed­ed Brazilians Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar 21-17, 21-11 on Tuesday night, and did it with­out ever dropping a set in seven matches. 
"It kind of hit me when I went and saw my family and they had tears in their eyes," Walsh said. "They flew a million miles to see it and they hate flying. It's really special." 
With the 6-foot-3 Walsh domi­nating at the net and the quick May scrambling and diving for every dig, they were favorites since last year, when they began an unprecedented 90-match, IS­tournament winning streak. 
"We have so much confidence in each other, we never doubted ourselves," May said. 
"We deserve it," Walsh added. 
Earlier, Americans Holly McPeak and Elaine Youngs won the bronze medal, beating Australia's Natalie Cook and Nicole Sanderson 21-18, 15-21, 15-9. 
The Americans and Brazilians exchanged hugs on the medal stand before the national anthem played. Adriana and Shelda. the all-time winningest pair on the international FIVB tour, won their second straight silver medal. 
On match point in a surpris­ingly lopsided final, Walsh ham­mered a spike just inside the line. Walsh fell to her knees as May ran to embrace her and both fell backward in the sand. 
"I just tackled her," May said. 
"I didn't care if I broke her knees because she has a lot of time to rest." 
Questions about the pair's Olympic chances arose in June, shortly after May pulled an abdominal muscle. She spent most of the summer rehabbing while Walsh kept homing her game with other partners. 
If they had weaknesses, they certainly weren't apparent in Athens where they were untouchable. improving to 108-8 over two years. 
"A lot of people had doubts," May said. "I tried to tell people I never had doubts." 
But they never took the medal for granted. 
"People said, 'You've got the gold medal in the bag,"' Walsh said. "However flattering that is, we know that's not true." 
Now it's time to party. 

May and Walsh are invited to a post-Olympics party at McPeak's home in California, where 10 bottles of Dom Perignon await. 
The toasts will taste especially sweet to McPeak, who finished fifth at the Olympics in 1996 and 2000, both times because her partner was injured. Two weeks before Atlanta. Nancy Reno tore a rotator cuff and couldn't do much more than set in the tour­nament. Five weeks before Sydney, May then her teammate tore an abdominal muscle. She and McPeak hardly practiced together before the games began. 
Youngs played on the U.S. indoor team that finished a dis­appointing seventh in Atlanta. She hit the beach the following year and paired with McPeak in 2002 with Athens on her mind. 
The Americans' bronze victory kept Cook off the medal stand for the frrst time since beach vol­leyball became an Olympic sport in 1996. Cook won the bronze in Atlanta and the gold in Sydney, both times with Kerri Pottharst. She teamed with Sanderson last year after Pottharst retired.

NATIONAL LEAGUE 
Marlins drop Giants in key wild card match up 
Cubs outlast rain and Brewers, gain agame on San Francisco 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -The Florida Marlins started a big series against the San Francisco Giants with a big inning. 
Alex Gonzalez hit a three­run homer to cap a seven-run first inning, and Mike Lowell drove in five runs to help Florida win 9-1 on Tuesday night. 
With the win, the defending World Series champions opened a three-game set tout­ed as their most important so far this season. Florida won for the eighth time in 11 games and pulled within four games of the Giants, who began the night tied with Chicago for the NL wild-card lead. 
A.J. Burnett (4-6) allowed just two hits both singles by Edgardo Alfonzo and one run in seven innings. Throwing at up to 100 mph, he walked four and hit a batter. and the Giants' only run scored on a bases-loaded wild pitch. 
The Marlins tied a franchise record with their seven-run first against left-bander Wayne Franklin (2-1), making just his second start this sea­son to fill in for injured ace Jason Schmidt. 
Pirates 3, Diamondbacks 1 
Oliver Perez pitched eight sharp innings, Daryle Ward homered and the Pittsburgh Pirates snapped a five-game losing streak with a win over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Tuesday night. 
Pirates left fielder Jason Bay reached over the wall to take away a two-run homer from Alex Cintron in the first, and Perez faced few problems after that. 
Perez (9-6). who entered the game leading the National League with an average of 11 strikeouts per nine innings, fanned nine and walked two. He struck out five over his last two innings. 
Perez gave up five hits and Jose Mesa pitched a perfect ninth for his 34th save in 39 chances. 
San Diego 3, New York 1 
David Wells continued his road dominance Tuesday night. taking a shutout into the ninth inning and pitching the San Diego Padres past the 
-
New York Mets. 
The only hits against the 41­year-old Ieft-hander until the ninth were a pair of first-
Roccd¥ 
Restaurant 
inning singles to Jeff 
Keppinger and Gerald 
Williams. The Mets knocked 
Wells out of the game with 
two outs on a double by 
Williams and Richard 
Hidalgo's RBI single. 
Trevor Hoffman came in and 
struck out Mike Cameron on 
three pitches for his 32nd 
save. 
It was the fifth straight road 
victory for Wells, whose only 
loss away from home came on 
April 19 at San Francisco. 
Wells (8-7) struck out four 
and walked none and came 
within one out of his 13th 
career shutout. It would've 
also been his first complete 
game of the year and 53rd of 
his career. 
Dodgers 10, Expos 2 
Adrian Beltre hit a grand slam of the season to become the first player to reach 40 home runs this year, and Alex Cora homered and had five RBis to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers over the Montreal Expos Tuesday night. 
Los Angeles scored eight times in the fifth, its biggest inning of the season. Beltre connected off Rocky Biddle (4­
7) for his fourth career slam, his second this season, and Cora hit a three-run drive against Francis Beltran. 
Cora also had an RBI single in the second and a run-scor­ing grounder in the ninth. tying his career high for RBis. 
Kazuhisa Ishii (12-6). who had been 0-2 in six starts July 16, allowed two runs in 7 1-3 innings. 
Astros 4, Phlllles 2 
Lance Berkman and Mike Lamb hit RBI singles in the eighth inning and the Houston Astros used a rare relief appearance by Roy Oswalt to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies Tuesday night. 
The Astros won for the sev­enth time in nine games. 
Carlos Hernandez pitched seven strong innings for Houston and left with the score tied at 2. 
The Astros then turned to Oswalt, who had not relieved since July 2, 2002. The right­hander had made 64 straight starts since that time, but went only 2 2-3 innings Sunday against Chicago before being ejected for hit­ting Michael Barrett. 
Oswalt (14-9) pitched a per­fect eighth, striking out two. Brad Lidge worked the ninth for his 16th save in 19 chances. 
Hernandez made his third start this year after sitting out the past 1 1/2 seasons with shoulder surgery. He allowed

two runs and six hits, striking out six and walking four. 
Atlanta 6, Colorado 5 

Rafael Furcal went 4-for-4, including a two-run triple in Atlanta's four-run sixth inning, and Eli Marrero drove in the go-ahead run with an RBI single in the seventh to lead the Braves to a victory over the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday night. 
Marrero and Julio Franco each went 3-for-4 for the Braves, who used 14 hits to rally past the Rockies after falling behind by four runs. Atlanta remained 7 1/2 games ahead of Florida in the NL East. 
With Colorado leading 5-1 in the sixth, Shawn Estes gave up a double to Franco to open the inning and Marrero hit an infield single to put runners on first and third. Charles Thomas hit into a fielder's choice to score Franco. Pinch­hitter Mark DeRosa followed with a single, knocking Estes out of the game. 
Furcal greeted Tim Harikkala (5-3) with a two­run triple that made it 5-4, and Marcus Giles tied it with a run-scoring double. 
Cincinnati 4, St. Louis 3 
Pitching while appealing a 10-day suspension, Julian Tavarez allowed the game­winning run to score in the 10th inning Tuesday night on Darren Bragg's single. which gave the Cincinnati Reds a win over the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Tavarez {5-4). penalized by the commissioner's office for applying a foreign substances to balls in a game he pitched last week, gave up a leadoff single in the 1Oth to Juan Castro, who advanced on Jason LaRue's sacrifice. 
Jacob Cruz walked and Bragg singled to right, with Castro beating the throw to the plate. 
Joe Valentine (1-1) pitched 1 1-3 innings for his first major league win. 
Cubs 13, Brewers 4 
Moises Alou homered twice and had a career-high six RBis, and Derrek Lee hit a grand slam to lead the Chicago Cubs over Milwaukee Tuesday and send the Brewers to their seventh straight loss. 
Alou hit a three-run homer in the first inning, a two-run homer in the fourth and a sac­rifice fly in the seventh as Chicago won for the sixth time in seven games and opened a one-game lead in the NL wild­card race over San Francisco. 
Alou. who has 31 homers, reached 30 for the third time in his career. 
Aramis Ramirez hit a solo homer off the left-field foul pole, and Corey Patterson went 3-for-4 and scored four runs for the Cubs, who built a 10-0 lead by the fourth inning. Nomar Garciaparra, who had missed three straight games because of a strained left wrist, went 0-for-4 and came out following a 1-hour, 4-minute rain delay in the seventh. 
Matt Clement (9-11). who had been 0-2 in four starts since winning at Milwaukee on July 26, struck out eight in six innings, allowing seven hits. He didn't allow a hit in the first four innings, then gave up two-run homers in the fifth to Bill Hall and Scott Podsednik.

NBA 
Dampier traded to Mavericks 
Associated Press 
DALLAS -The Dallas Mavericks got a big man, com­pleting an eight-player deal Tuesday that will bring Erick Dampier from Golden State. 
Dallas sent Christian Laettner. Eduardo Najera, two future first-round draft picks and the draft rights to guards Luis Flores and Mladen Sekularac to the Warriors for Dampier, Dan Dickau, Evan Eschmeyer and the draft rights to Steve Logan. 
The 6-foot-11 Dampier aver­aged career highs of 12.3 points and 12 rebounds in 7 4 games last season for the Warriors. lie was fourth in the NBA in rebounding. and one of just nine players to average more than 10 points and 10 rebounds a game. 
Dampier opted out of his contract with the Warriors in late June and became a free agent after seven seasons with Golden State. 
In a release. the Mavericks said Dampier signed a multi­year deal with Golden State before the trade was complet­ed. Contract details weren't immediately available. 
Donnie Nelson. the Mavericks president of basket­ball operations. was in Greece for the Olympics and not immediately available for com­ment. 
A call to Dampier's cell phone was not immediately 

While Dampier gives the Mavericks a much-needed big man for coach Don Nelson, Golden State achieved some objectives as well with the trade. 
"We acquired quality players who can help our team now and several prospects that bode well for our future," said Chris Mullin, the Warriors'

Najera averaged 4.9 points and 3. 9 rebounds a game in his four seasons with the Mavericks, shooting 51 percent from the field. He was limited by knee problems last season. 
Laettner, a 12-year veteran. spent the last three seasons in Washington before being trad­ed back to Dallas on draft night. He has averaged 13.3 points and 6.9 rebounds over 819 career games with Minnesota, Atlanta, Detroit, Dallas and Washington. 
Flores was the 55th overall pick by Houston in the June draft, but acquired by Dallas. Sekularac, who has played professionally in Europe since 1996, was the 55th overall pick by Dallas in the 2002 draft. 
Dickau was traded from Portland to Golden State last month, and Eschmeyer missed all of last season due to multi­ple knee operations after going from Dallas to the Warriors in another multiplayer trade last summer. Logan was a second­round pick by the Warriors two years ago. 

Bryant judge to restrict photos 

Associated Press 
DENVER-The judge in the Kobe Bryant rape case on Tuesday sharply restricted how the news media may cover the trial using televi­sion and still cameras. saying he was worried too much exposure could threaten the fairness of the proceedings. 
District Judge Terry Ruckriegle said no cameras will be allowed during wit­ness testimony or jury selec­tion. Still photography will be allowed during opening statements and closing argu­ments. Video and audio cov­erage will be allowed only during closing arguments. 
Attorneys for news organi­zations including The Associated Press had asked to be allowed to photograph and videotape the entire trial. Attorneys for the alleged victim joined prose­cutors and defense attorneys in opposing the request. 
Bryant, 26, has pleaded not guilty to felony sexual assault. saying he had con­sensual sex about the poten­tial for witness intimidation and anxiety stemming from physical threats made against the alleged victim, prosecutors and others involved in the case. 
"The increased anxiety and apprehension of witnesses that flow from the public dis­play of an image or live testi­mony reduces the court's ability to maintain a fair trial," he said. 
Ruckriegle also prohibited any photographs of jurors and any audio coverage or close-up photographs of con­ferences at the bench or dis­cussions between attorneys or attorneys and their clients. 
Ruckriegle said attorneys in the case have shown "no propensity for showboating or grandstanding" but con­cluded there was a likeli­hood that cameras would affect witnesses, some of whom displayed reluctance and discomfort during pre­trial hearings. 
"Substantial portions of the testimony may no doubt be embarrassing and humiliat­ing for some of the partici­pants and will likely exact some measure of intense psychological stress. if not a physical distress," Ruckriegle said. 
The ruling struck a bal­ance between the need to ensure a fair trial and the First Amendment rights of the media, said Bob Pugsley, a professor at Southwestern University School of Law. 
"I think that from the O.J. [Simpson] media debacle. judges have become very averse to allowing real-time television coverage of pro­ceedings, including the trial in their courtrooms," Pugsley said. 
Steven Zansberg. one of the attorneys for the news organizations, said the deci­sion reflects the judge's con­cern with how cameras may affect witnesses. 
He said the ruling cannot be appealed.

Associated Press 
HEMPSTEAD. N.Y. Herman Edwards believes not giving Quincy Carter a second chance would be a crime. 
That's how the New York Jets' coach explained the team's signing Tuesday of the former Dallas starting quarterback who was sur­prisingly released by the Cowboys three weeks ago. 
The fact the Jets were desperate for a backup to Chad Pennington had a lit· tie to do with the move, too. 
"The worst thing you can do to any individual is not give them hope," Edwards said after Carter signed a one-year deal. "If a nega­tive situation happens to a person in life, if you won't give them hope, shame on you." 

Edwards hopes Carter provides a solid option should Pennington get hurt the way he did last sum­mer. Pennington, entering his fifth NFL season, broke his right wrist a year ago in a preseason game and although the Jets had Vinny Testaverde as a backup, they got off to a slow start and never recov­ered. 
Testaverde, coincidental­ly, now is the starter in Dallas, so in essence the 
teams traded quarter­backs. 
"You know, in this game, we learn that surprises, there are a lot of them," Carter said before donning a No. 17 jersey and throw­ing a handful of passes in a lengthy practice session. "I know that things happen and you've just got to move on. 
"But I was shocked." 
Carter was cut Aug. 4 amid reports he failed a drug test and the NFL Players Association has filed a request for arbitra­tion in the case. Gene Upshaw, the union's execu­tive director, told The Associated Press on 
IN BRIEF 
Colts P-lan to release two 
offensive linemen 
INDIANAPOLIS -The Indianapolis Colts expected to release offensive linemen Rex Richards and Matt Griebel, coach Tony Dungy said Tuesday. 
Dungy was uncertain whether the official moves would come Tuesday night or Wednesday. 
The first cutdown day is Aug. 31, and the Colts rarely make early moves. Dungy said the releases were "special situations" and that both players met with him because they believed there were opportunities to play elsewhere. 
"It seemed like the right time to do it," Dungy said. 
Richards, a 6-foot-4, 315-pound guard, joined the Colts as a free agent for the second straight year. He has been cut both times. 
Griebel. a 6-2. 298-pound guard from Indiana State, was an undraft­ed free agent. 

Capriati advances into 
quarterfinals of Pilot Pen 
NEW HAVEN, Conn. -Third-seed­ed Jennifer Capriati outserved and outlasted Tatiana Golovin on long points Tuesday to advance to the quarterfinals of the Pilot Pen tennis tournament. 
Capriati, the defending Pilot Pen champion, defeated Golovin 6-3, 6-2 in about an hour. 
Also advancing to the quarterfinals was No. 7 Elena Bovina with a 6-3, 6-2 win over qualifier Marta Marrero. 
Capriati used a serve that topped out at 117 mph and a punishing backhand to overwhelm Golovin, who made mistake after mistake in the match. 
In the second set, Golovin had four chances in the fourth game to break Capriati, but failed on key points to keep the ball in the court. 
"I know she wasn't making many errors, and I kind of made the wrong Tuesday that the NFLPA will continue to press thn case. 
"We have to," he said, adding that part of the grievance involves poten­tial salary loss to Carter. 
"You'll have to ask Dallas why they released me," Carter said. "All I got was the papers." 
Edwards said the Jets didn't want to rush into anything with Carter _ or any other veteran quarter­back, which is why it took so long before they brought in Carter for a tryout. Edwards also defended his backups, second-year pro Brooks Bollinger and CFL refugee Ricky Ray. 

choices sometimes," Golovin said. 
Capriati said it was exactly the kind of opening match she wanted to test her game after a few weeks of rest for a hamstring injury. 
"I felt good out there. I felt like I was making a lot of good gets, and I was able to go the long points," Capriati said. 
Golovin said she would take the match as a learning experience as she continues her rise through the WTA rankings. from the 300s last year to 30th this week. 
In the second match, Bovina faced just one break point in cruising to a win over Marrero. 
Bovina was the aggressor through­out, keeping the Spaniard on the move and hitting clean winners off Marrero's drop shots. 
Bovina broke once in the first set to take a 3-2 lead, and served out. She broke twice in the second, the last with a forehand winner down the line to take a 5-2 lead.

Season ends prematurely after loss to Arizona 
Wildcats' hurler MeLoan too much for Irish at home 
By JOE HETTLER 
Sports Wricer 
Two years ago, Notre Dame shocked the college baseball world by beating No. 1 Florida State to advance to the College World Series. After recording the final out, Notre Dame play­ers rushed the field and creat­ed a dogpile on the mound. 
The same scene happened this year at Frank Eck Stadium. Except a different team did the celebrating. 
No. 3 seed Arizona ended Notre Dame's season in the NCAA Regional Tournament with a 7-6 win against the Irish June 6. 
"Our kids played hard right until the end," Irish head coach Paul Mainieri said. "If you were in that dugout, it was nothing but optimism, positive talk. We all believed we were going to do it. Sometimes in this busi­ness, you don't get over the hump. It's been a great year." 
The Irish scored six runs off Arizona starter John MeLoan in eight innings, but couldn't hold ofT the Wildcats seventh-inning rally. Notre Dame freshman pitcher Dan Kapala walked Arizona's leadoff hitter Trevor Crowe, Jeff Van Houten sacri­ficed Crowe to second before Jordan Brown singled in the run. MeLoan finished the game after throwing 141 pitches and surrendering all his runs via the long ball. First baseman Matt Edwards hit two homers and Steve Andres and Cody Rizzo added their own shots on a windy day. 
Arizona closer Koley Kohlberg finished the game for his second save of the season. 
"When I saw that the wind was blowing out today, I felt good about the way we swing the bats, but [MeLoan] was really tough," Mainieri said. "He was a competitor, and we had a tough time with him. I'm disappointed for the kids. I'm not disappointed in them." 
The Irish threatened in the top of the ninth when freshman Danny Dressman leadoff with a walk. But Dressman was picked off first after slipping in the dirt trying to dive back to the bag. All-Americans Matt Macri and Steve Sollman struck out to end the game. 
"They threw an excellent pitcher again, and he had his good stuff. It didn't work out for us that way," Edwards said. "We all thought we could come back and do this. Everybody had confidence and we were ready to go today. We just got beat out there today, and not because of anything that hap­pened earlier this week. We put that all behind us and we were ready to go." 
Notre Dame starting pitcher freshman Jeff Samardzija cruised through the first three innings before struggling in the fourth. The Wildcats pushed four in the fourth to take a 4-2 lead. Samardzija went 5 113 innings allowing five runs on seven hits and striking out six and walking zero. 
Senior Joe Thaman surren­dered one run in 2/3 of an inning in the sixth before Kapala came on. 

Notre Dame finished the sea­son 51-12 record and another Big East championship. The 51 wins were the most ever by any Notre Dame baseball team and the team had five players draft­ed into the Major Leagues. 
Kent State 2, Notre Dame 1 

Notre Dame lost the opening game against No. 4 seed Kent State June 4 when Golden Flash starting pitcher Andy Sonnastine threw a masterful game in a 2-1 victory. The big righthander went seven innings, allowed one unearned run and struck out seven and walked just two. He effectively moved his slider inside and out­side the plate to keep the Notre Dame hitters off balance all day. 
"The stage was set," Mainieri said. "I guess someone just for­got to tell Kent State not to do what they did today." 
Kent State manufactured a run in the fifth and added another on an RBI double in the eighth. Notre Dame's only run was unearned. 
The loss put the Irish in the losers bracket in the double elimination format. 
Notre Dame 6, University of California-Irvine 5 

The Irish stayed alive with a victory over the Anteaters June 
5. Right-hander Grant Johnson clawed his way through five innings, allowing four runs (three earned) while striking out four and walking three. Notre Dame's bullpen allowed just one unearned run through the next four innings to close out the game.

don't want to be blocked and commit errors." 
At practice, the two have been honing their skills through scrimmages on oppo­site sides of the net. 
The duo view practice as a time to challenge the other, and to learn from each others' strengths and weaknesses. 
"[Brewster] is such a big presence in the front row. We almost take her for granted. You really notice the differ­ence when she's not playing," Loomis said. "Every day I play her in practice, I know I'm playing the best."

The Irish scored two in the first and added runs in the third, fifth, sixth and seventh innings. Steve Andres lead the Notre Dame offense by going 3­for-3 and driving in two runs. The win pushed the Irish into the championship game June 6.

able with the praise they gar­ner. 
"Our outside hitters do such a great job of setting the block up. It's really a combined effort at the net. Because the setters do such a great job with ball placement, we can do our job," Brewster said. 
The combined Irish efforts at the net in conjunction with a solid back row are what Brown believes will put the Irish among the top teams in the country. 
She looks to Brewster and Loomis to lead the charge. 
"This year, I'm hoping they can dominate at the net, and I think they can," she said "They both hit and block effectively and their presence at the net will be hard for their opponents to adjust for."

"We did a reasonable job at times, some times better than others. I think we did quite well, but I also know that we still have quite a lot of room to improve." 
With the first of two exhibi­tion games under its belt, Notre Dame travels to Chicopee, Mass., Saturday to challenge Massachusetts at 7 p.m. in its final preseason game.

keep your linebackers fresh," Simmons said. "We have Mike Goolsby, who is available now. And that gives those other guys a chance to really take a break." 
Goolsby (6-foot-4, 242 pounds) has experience from the 2002 season but did not play in 2003 due to a collar­bone injury. 
His return will add depth to what could be one of the strongest positions on the defensive side of the ball. 
"It is extremely nice [to have depth at linebacker) and that makes it one of the strengths of our football team." Willingham said. "We're really pleased to have it, and not only just to have it but they have done great things with it." 
One of the most vocal line­backers and players on the team, Curry (6-foot-3, 235 pounds) could start at middle linebacker. Curry saw middle linebacker duties last season in the Irish defense's nickel packages. 
"It's nice to have experi­ence." Willingham said. "It's nice to have confidence. But if you don't share those things then it really doesn't mean a lot to a team environment. The !linebackers) arc sharing. They're leading not only by example but by stepping up and saying the right things at the appropriate times." 
While vocal leaders Goolsby. Curry and Hoyte boast the most experience, Mays has worked his way into signifi­cant playing time. 
The 6-foot-1, 243-pound senior made 26 tackles last year but hopes for better numbers after taking a solid number of snaps in the spring and fall. 
"I don't think you ever put a label on a guy who has a lot of ability [and say he is] the most improved player, but along those lines Corey keeps getting better and better," Willingham said. "What we need from Corey are the things that he is working hardest on, which is to be able to communicate about where everybody else goes, not just where Corey goes, and he's starting to do a very good job of that." 
Notes 
Coach Tyrone Willingham and the Irish began their preparation for the BYU Cougars Tuesday, 11 days before the team opens its sea­son at Lavell Edwards Stadium. 
Willingham said the early stages of learning the Cougars' schemes have slowed practice from the two­a-day pace that ended after Monday's practice. Still, early preparation is necessary. 
"The focus was to start some of the initial learning for BYU. so we did that," Willingham said. "We'd love to have it be very spirited, but if it's not it's the learning that is important." 
Ending two-a-day practice calls for a quick transition into the preparation phase. 
"Coming out of two-a-days, you're most sore, you're most hurt," Willingham said. "That's where you're fatigued the most. So we're just com­ing out of that period. Where we really start to get a build up is probably coming out of this [coming) weekend. Even though that is only one week away from the game, there still is that time before every­thing seems to be crystallized for you."

"It feels pretty good to be drafted by a hometown team," said Johnson, who grew up in Burr Ridge, Ill. 
Notre Dame coach Paul Mainieri, said Johnson should succeed at the professional level. 
"There's no question in my mind Grant will be a Major League pitcher," said Mainieri, who has had 40 players drafted during his 10 years as Irish coach. "He has all the attrib­utes -size, arm strength, quality of pitches. But his best asset is that he's a fierce com­petitor."

MEN'S SOCCER 
< Irish blank 1 Cats in preseason tilt 
By MATT PUGLISI Sports Writer 
While most downplay the importance of exhibition games, head coach Bobby Clark dis­agrees. 
"[The exhibition games) are huge -they're all you get to put a team together," Clark said. "They give you a chance to evaluate, build up team cohe­sion and just generally start to build the team." 
If Monday night is any indica­tion, the No. 9 Irish are off to a good start. 
Behind a pair of goals from forwards Justin McGeeney and Tony Megna and a shut out by 2004 Iiermann Trophy Watch List goalkeeper Chris Sawyer, Notre Dame cruised to a 2-0 victory over Northwestern at Alumni Field in front of a crowd of 2,100 Monday. 
McGeeney kicked off the scor­ing for the Irish, slotting home a cross from defender Greg Dalby for a quick 1-0 advantage 11 minutes into the contest. 
Notre Dame struck again not 10 minutes later when midfield­er Nate Norman sliced into the right corner of the box and found a waiting Megna. Controlling the ball, Megna calmly beat Northwestern goal­keeper Justin Pines inside the right post to double the Irish lead and post what would be the final goal at the 20:17 mark. 
Staked to an early 2-0 lead, Sawyer ensured the Irish remained on top, recording three saves in the game, includ­ing one brilliant stop on a close­range Northwestern blast in the second half. 
Although the Irish had a num­ber of opportunities to extend their lead late in the game, they were unable to find the back of net. 
McGeeney paced the Irish attack, unleashing a team-high 5 of 19 total Notre Dame shots, while midfielder Ian Etherington posted three and both midfielder Kyle Dulworth and Megna had a pair. 
All things considered, Clark was pleased with the Irish effort. 
"In many ways we, ~ .r~re just getting our shape, getting to play with one another and

VOLLEYBALL 
Loomis, Brewster dominate middle 
By ANN LOUGHERY Sporrs Writer 
Just for the record, they're winners -not wishers. 
For junior Lauren Brewster and senior Emily Loomis, there are no what-ifs or should-have-been's. 
The two middle blockers aren't ones to talk up their game; their achievements speak volumes. 
Coach Debbie Brown said both Brewster and Loomis are two of the leading blockers on the team. 
Last year, Brewster's 1.78 block average earned her the NCAA blocking title. 
An All-American, Brewster's blocking average was a mere .01 off the school record. 
She led the Irish in kills (372/3.58) and was runner-up in service aces (27/0.26). 
Loomis shined as well last season, though she made her 
contributions as an outside hitter. 
Brown decided to move the senior to the middle hitter position, describing Loomis as one of the team's strongest blockers. 
Loomis, also an All­American. led the Irish in kills (387/3.55) and was second in points (472.5/4.33). 
Further, last season. she shattered two school records -consecutive matches with 10 or more kills and most kills in a match without an error. 
"The statistical impact they made on the team last year was huge," Brown said. 
Together, the duo makes for an intimidating tag-team. 
"Other teams know they're good blockers and that's espe­cially intimidating for oppo­nent hitters," Brown said. "The hitters have to try some­thing different because they

FOOTBALL 

Hoyte's injury, return unknown 
By PAT LEONARD Associate Sports Editor 

Senior linebacker Brandon Hoyte spoke last spring about his will to improve within the defensive scheme. 
"At the end of last season," he said, "I couldn't look at myself in the mirror and say I played to my potential." 
Hoyte's numbers did not indicate he needed improve­ment. 
He finished second on the team in tackles with 7 4 total and 48 solo. 
Still, Hoyte's attitude reflects the leadership role that the Irish coaches feel flows through this season's linebacking core. 
"All the players on the team are leaders," lineback­ers coach, Bob Simmons, said, "but [linebacker is] a position from a vocal stand­point of getting guys lined up to play ... based on what the defense calls. It's important for them to be leaders on our defense." 
The word "them" describes more than just the normal three linebackers set behind a defensive line. 
Seniors Mike Goolsby, Derek Curry and Corey Mays will most likely start the sea­son against BYU, with Hoyte (5-foot-11, 231 pounds) side­lined with his right arm in a sling. 
Coaches have declined to comment on Hoyte's injury or a timetable for his return.

How do I plan a project for a large group? 
If you are planning a project for a large group, be certain there is interest in the project before contacting the agency and committing to a project.
