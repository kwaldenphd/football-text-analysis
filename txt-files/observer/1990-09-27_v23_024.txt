Tensions increase in Gulf 
Relations worsen between Jordan and Saudis 
AMMAN, Jordan (AP)-The 
diplomatic war in the Persian 
Gulf escalated on another front 
Wednesday -between Jordan 
and Saudi Arabia. Jordanian 
newspapers called Saudi offi­
cials "warmongers" who outdid 
Israel and the West in acting 
against Arab interests. 
The newspapers were react­ing to Saudi Arabia's cutting off oil supplies to Jordan and expelling more than 30 Jordanian Embassy employees on charges of spying for Iraq. 
Officials in Amman sought to play down the division, hoping it will heal. But many Jordanians expressed bitter­ness and defiance. 
"Let them drink their oil. We do not need them," said Ali Tobassi, a Jordanian waiting at a bus stand Tuesday. "We will sweat to earn our daily bread and we prefer to starve rather than take their money." 
Jordan's Arabic-language daily Al-Rai said the Saudis seem to consider opposition to foreign troops in the gulf to be directed at them and sought "to punish us in terms of halt­ing oil supplies and accusing our embassy staff of espi­onage." 
"This means the sister state of Saudi Arabia has virtually decided to declare a real war against the Jordanian and Palestinian people," it said. 
A multinational militarv 

force, including tens of thou­
sands of U.S. troops, has 
assembled in the Saudi desert 
following Iraq's blitz takeover 
on Aug. 2 of the small oil sul­
tanate of Kuwait adjoining 
Saudi Arabia. Jordan has sup­
ported Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein in the confrontation, 
but said Wednesday it will halt 
all flights to and from Iraq to 
comply with a U.N. air em­
bargo. 
Jordan's conservative Arabic­

language Ad-Dustour was par­
ticularly incensed by remarks 
Tuesday by Saudi Foreign 
Minister Prince Saud ai-Faisal 
that force was the sole option 
for getting Iraq out of Kuwait. 
It said in a front-page edito­rial, "Saud al-Faisal has out­aone the warmongers of Israel, Britain and even the United States in their campaign against Iraq." 
Saudi Arabia ordered 20 

Jordanian diplomatic personnel 
out of the country on Saturday 
and 12 more on Tuesday. 
Jordan indignantly reported the 
move on national radio, and re­
called its ambassador in 
protest. 
Saudi Arabia took the mea­sures to express outrage over Jordan's pro-Iraqi stance and at what it saw as Jordanian at­tempts to undermine its gov­ernment 
Prince Bandar bin Sultan a)­Saud, the Saudi ambassador in Washington, wrote an open let­ter to Jordan's King Hussein deploring what he called a de­fense of Iraq's "horrifying acts of rape and destruction" in Kuwait. 
Jordanian officials chose 
their words carefully in re­
sponse. 

"We do not understand why 
our brethren in Saudi Arabia 
are lashing out at us," said one 
senior official. "I am sure that 
this Is a misunderstanding 
which will be sorted out and I 
hope that will be soon." 
"I am sure all these differ­
ences will be solved," said a se­

nior Foreign Ministry official, 
who, like the other official, 
spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
He denied that Jordanian of­

ficials in Saudi Arabia had 
spied on military installations. 
Western diplomatic sources, speaking privately, said evi­dence existed that some Jordanian Embassy employees acted individually on behalf of Iraq without the knowledge or permission of their govern­ment. 
Some officials in Amman first refused to acknowledge that Saudi Arabia, long a source of huge monetary grants to Jordan, had actually expelled Jordanians.

Mclean speaks on law applications 
By CHRIS WILKINSON News Writer 
Professor William McLean, assistant dean of the Law School, started his lecture on the law school application pro­cess by asking, "Does the fact that we're in the chapel suggest that a good way to get into law school is to pray?" 
Although praying may help some students, McLean offered more practical advice about how to get Into law school dur­ing his lecture last night at the St. Edward's Hall Forum. 
McLean has been involved with the application process for most of his fifteen years with the Notre Dame Law School and shared much of his Insight into the process with almost seventy juniors and seniors in the chapel of St. Edward's Hall. He spoke of the ten questions most frequently asked by appli­cants. 
He said that students starting law school are often unsure what type of law is best for them. "A lawyer must work in harmony with others ... and be able to influence them." Keep­ing this idea in mind, he en­couraged students to explore all the various forms and tech­niques of law and not to focus on one area right away. 
As an example he mentioned that the trial lawyer needs to be able to think fast on the run, while the corporate lawyer has time to research his material and then present his findings. 
When asked to how many schools students should apply, McLean said, "at least one." He suggested that, "four is a good number," with one of these be­ing a safety-school. He said ap­plying to "ten [schools] is just silly." He encouraged the stu­dents to research their schools well and find one that suits their individual needs and per­sonalities. 
McLean spoke of GPA's, Law

scores, and personal state­
ments in terms of how much

INSIDE COLUMN 


There's more to life than football 
If you are the type of person who is likely to nominate Adrian Jarrell for "Person of the Week" and can recite the depth chart for the Irish football team 

and their opponents Usa Eaton 
in your sleep, this column is for you, so Production Manager read on. 
Don't get me wrong, I love football as much as the next person, but I think that the mania that sweeps this campus during the fall and makes polyester green-plaid pants a fashion statement instead of fash­ion faux pas, sometimes makes even the most level-headed Domer lose a little per­spective on life. Sure football is fun, exciting and definitely preferable to an afternoon in the 'Brare, however, it is not the end-all and be-ali of human existence. 
Notre Dame is an academic institution first, and a football powerhouse second. Thus, it makes sense that its students ought to be students first, and fans of the mighty blue and gold second. We are all here to get an education, football should just be a pleasant distraction from the more serious side of life as a Notre Dame student. 
Rallying around our team can provide a harmless opportunity to show the spirit and unity of the Notre Dame family, but for some reason that does not seem to be the case on this campus from early September until the beginning of January. We need to keep the proper perspective about what is really important in life. 
As members of the Notre Dame commu­nity we have an obligation to be aware of University policies and to have an opinion about them. There are many issues on this campus that are very serious and deeply af­fect the lives of many people. 
We cannot afford to be apathetic. We need to question the decisions made by the University and to think seriously about what is going on at this campus and throughout the world. That does not mean we need to spend many hours debating whether or not Lou Holtz should have thrown the ball on third down. 
As people attending one of the finest aca­
demic universities in the country, we need to 
be aware and involved in the Notre Dame 
community as well as the world community. 
Our education will be wasted if we are 
able to graduate from this University and 
know nothing more about the world we live 
in than when we began. We owe it to our­
selves to become informed and active mem­
bers of society. 
So, have fun at your tailgaters and enjoy 
the game, but make an effort to learn 
something new this weekend that has noth­
ing to do with the amazing grace of the 
Fighting Irish. I'm sure I'll see everybody at 
the game.

Lecture focuses on student sexuality 
By COLLEEN GANNON News Writer 
From the very first moment of our existence, we are sexual, said Patricia Livingston the as­sociate director of Notre Dame's Center for Continuing Formation in Ministry. 
Livingston began her lecture titled "Understanding and Claiming our Sexuality" by dis­tinguishing between the three areas of sexuality. These areas include primary, genital, and affective sexuality. 
"How we are embodied as males and females," falls under the primary area said Liv­ingston. Sex role identity and sexual orientation also play a role in this area. The question is: Am I more heterosexual or homosexual, she said. 
Primary sexuality includes a person's own perception of his/her body. Livingston dis­cussed the fact that many peo­ple feel self-conscious about some part of their body. This could include weight, height, facial features, or hair. How­ever, "What good does it do to have the perfect body, if you feel ugly in it?," questioned Liv­ingston. She said we must ac­cept the bodies we have and say "welcome home." 
After primary, she discussed genital sexuality. This area in­cludes desires, fantasies, and stirrings. As long as we are alive, this is a wonderful part of us, said Livingston. A major question in this area is what is appropriate at this stage in my life, she said. 
Affective sexuality was the fi­nal area discussed by Liv­ingston. This area includes qualities of tenderness, gentle­ness, and warmth. 
"All the areas are connected," she said. For example, if you are feeling attractive which is primary, you are reaching out to more people with confidence which is affective. 
"Sometimes people have genital sex to find out about 
themselves as women or men." Sometimes people have sex to "get bonding, to have relation­ships," said Livingston depicting the interrelatedness between the three areas of sexuality. 
"You are in probably the most stressful time of your whole life in terms of sexuality," said Livingston in reference to years spent in college. 
In terms of primary sexuality, she said you wonder about your attractiveness. Under this area, questions also surface about careers and marriage, said Liv­ingston. 
"In terms of genitality, enor­mous curiosity, fantasy, and cultural pressure about genital sex" exist during this time, she said. 
"A great desire to be liked by same sex pnople and other sex people, a great need to be pop­ular and a need to be included" fall under affective sexuality during the college years, ac­cording to Livingston. 
She said that this is a time of 
homesickness and touch depri­vation. Touch deprivation refers to things such as a hug usually received from Dad or Mom. 
Livingston said a psychologist told her that sleep patterns re­flect our psychological health. She asked, "How common is it on college campuses to stay up all night to study for an exam or to stay up all night for a so­cial reason?" Then people won­der why they are hyper or de­pressed, she said. 
Also, she discussed the con­nection between the Catholic Church and our sexuality. "The best wisdom we have from our Church is that sex is not triv­ial," said Livingston, the recipi­ent of the 1990 U.S. Catholic Award. 
In claiming and understand­ing our sexuality, Livingston suggests working on all three aspects of sexuality. According to Livingston, among other things, we can take care of our bodies, not repress genital be­havior, and have quality time both with friends and alone.

U.S. to sell strategic oil reserves 
CHICAGO (AP) -The White House, claiming there was 'no justification" for the recent run-up in oil and gasoline prices, announced Wednesday that President Bush had decided to sell five million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
The decision to tap the na­tion's oil reserve as a cannon shot against soaring prices was announced by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. 
Fitzwater said the decision to put five million barrels on the market was a "test" and the president would take "additional steps to stabilize energy prices." 
The reserve contains 590 mil­lion barrels of crude oil. It has never been used apart from a 1-million barrel test sale in 1985 that was not aimed at in-

fluencing prices. 

Fitzwater said he expected prices to decline under the gov­ernment's sale, but he did not say by how much. Prices have jumped to about $39 a barrel from $21 before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
Fitzwater said Bush was tak­ing the action to head off "those who might seek profit by subverting the sanctions" against Iraq. 
"There is sufficient oil to meet current needs," Fitzwater said. "Oil markets have simply not taken into account addi­tional production coming on stream." 
Industry experts have esti­mated that production in other countries has restored about two-thirds of the 4.8 million daily barrels of oil production removed from world markets 
McLean said that the LSAT's are the most significant indica­tor of performance in the first year of law school because they are updated yearly to reflect the successes of actual law stu­dents. As with GPA, a poor LSAT score may not totally de­stroy chances of making a good law school. He also pointed out that it is possible to take the~~ tests more than once. 
The personal statement writ­ten with the application is an important component for offi­cers making an acceptance de­cision. He encouraged students to include personal statements even if the school does not ask for them. Often schools rely on the written part of the LSAT's to indicate writing ability, but McLean thinks the statement is

WASHINGTON {AP) President Bush-may be willing to drop his insistence for a cut in the capital gains tax, Republican congressmen said Wednesday, a demand that has been the major obstacle to a budget deal. 
But the apparent softening of Bush's position was revealed on a day when Bush and congres­sional Democrats had their most withering public flare-up over the talks in weeks. 
The two sides accused each other of endangering their stalled bargaining, just five days before disruptive cuts in government services will be im­posed if the negotiations fail. 
Bush said nothing about his reported change in his capital gains stance as he campaigned for Republican candidates In Ohio. 
"The hang-up is with the Democrats," he said, accusing them of refusing to do their part to cut the deficit. 
"If and when the ax falls, the Democratic Congress knows that it will be held account­able," he said. "And I will take that message to every state in the union. It is their fault." 
He also said Democrats 
"have not come forward with a 
package" at the talks, a remark 
that touched off a Democratic 
uproar. 
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said Democrats have made several offers in recent bargaining sessions. 
"To begin a series of charges 
or countercharges ... at this 
stage is not helpful," Foley 
said. "It is damaging to the 
talks, though we're determined 
it not be critically damaging." 
Mitchell said the president 
must have been "badly misin­
formed" to have made the 
comment, and called it "highly 
misleading and damaging." 
Hundreds of unionized fed­
eral workers rallied outside the 
Capitol at noon to demand a 
quick solution to the budget 
crisis. They carried signs read­
ing, "Your furlough begins 
Nov. 6, Election Day," and 
"Congress, you do your jobs so 
we can do ours." 
The rally was organized by 
the American Federation of 
Government Employees, which 
represents 700,000 federal 
workers. 
Inside the building, the Senate 
voted overwhelmingly to apply 
the spending cuts to the 
salaries of members of 
Partisan politics stall budget talks 
Congress and top executive branch orficlals, including Vice President Quayle and members of the Cabinet -Items now ex­empt under the Gramm­Rudman budget-cutting law. 
After a morning meeting at the White House, GOP lawmak­ers said Bush was signalling compromise. Instead of lowered capital gains tax rates, Bush might accept other items he be­lieves would spur the economy, they said. 
"He might be willing to look at other alternatives in the growth area," said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R­Kan. 
Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2 House Republican, said the alterna­tives could include corporate tax breaks designed to encour­age research and to prod busi­nesses to operate In ailing ur­ban and rural areas. 
The developments occurred as negotiators for the White House and Congress were re­suming their search for a package of tax increases and spending cuts that could reduce the deficit by $500 billion over five years. 
Hanging over them was the prospect of $85 billion In po­tentially disruptive cuts sched­uled to take place automatically Monday -reductions that could result in furloughs for as many as 2.1 million federal workers and curtail govern­ment programs as diverse as air traffic control to food in­spections. 
If the cuts take effect, af­fected domestic programs would be slashed by 32.4 per­cent and defense programs by 
35.3 percent. 
Social Security, the military payroll and many benefits for veterans and low-income people are exempt from the cuts. 
With no spending legislation 
in place for the new fiscal year, 
which starts Monday, the 
House planned to decide 
Thursday whether to provide 
temporary financing for the 
government. A vote was also 
planned on whether to postpone 
the approaching spending cul<;, 
with Bush vowing to block any 
delay. 
"It is the law of the land, and 
I took an oath to the 
Constitution to uphold the law 
of the land," Bush said about 
the pending cuts. "We've tried 
to do our part."

The Wholesale Club finds success

This week marks the third anniversary of the Mishawaka branch of The Wholesale Club, a retailer of a wide variety of brand-name consumer goods. 
The Wholesale Club, estab­lislwd in 1982 in Indianapolis, is the fifth largest member of the $25 billion membership wholesale club industry and operates 25 units throughout the Midwest, including six in Indiana. 
During its seven and a half years of operation, the Whole­sale Club has created more than 800 jobs in Indiana, 100 at each warehouse and 200 in its corporate offices. 
Me m be r ship to the Mishawaka branch exceeds 
years, we've experienced an overwhelming response to our unit," said Mishawaka ware­house manager Mike Colnman. 
"The Wholesale Club's philos­ophy-to provide businesses, non-profit organizations and selected individuals with top quality merchandise at whole­sale prices-has enabled our membership to stretch their budget dollars further," Cole­man added. 

· 
In a recent letter to The Wholesale Club's Chairman John Geisse, Indiana Governor Evan Bayh wrote, "The Whole­sale Club is the kind of en­trepreneurial success that em­bodies the spirit of Indiana and serves as a model for many of 

Lieutenant Governor Frank O'Bannon wrote, "We look for­ward to more The Wholesale Club locations in Indiana and we appreciate the confidence you demonstrate in the Hoosier economy." 
Membership to The Whole­sale Club is open to all mem­bers of South Bend/Mishawaka upon payment of the annual membership fee. 
Today The Wholesale Club is hosting a ribbon-tying cere­mony including an appearance by Mishawaka Mayor Robert Beutter, which is open to the public. All proceeds from the sale of food and beverages at the event will be donated to the local United Way Chapter.

'Serious study' at IU funded 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) 
A 10-year development program supported by $15.1 million in grants was an­nounced Wednesday by the Indiana University Center on Philanthropy. 
"The grants virtually as­sure that the study of philan­thropy will become a serious scholarly subject, both in re­search and teaehing," said John Barlow, dean of the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI. 
The largest grant was $11.4 million for 3 1/2 years by the Lilly Endowmtmt. Anonymous donors have given the <~enter the remain­ing $3.7 million. 
The center, which is Ioeated on the Indiana University­Purdue University at Indi­anapolis campus, will estab­lish degree programs In phi­lanthropic students and a grantmaking school. 
Under the 10-year plan, the center will provide national leadership in developing the academic field of philan­thropic studies and will sup­port research worldwide. 
"Only a handful of centers at universities in this coun­try foeus on philanthropy as a field of serious study," said John Mutz, prtlsident of' the Lilly Endowment.

LETTERS 


Men pay the price for social standing 
best of all possible worlds. I've been in the army, knitted slip­pers, traveled to South America, visited prisons, cried in public, stitched up injured animals and never paid for dates. What man has the free­dom to engage in such a wide range of activities? If he cries, he's a "wimp." If he knits, he's probably "gay." If he doesn't pay for dates, he's "cheap." 
We all want to be in someone else's shoes. In America, we think the best shoes to be in are those of white men-those per­petrators of injustice and upholders of the status quo. We scream bloody murder when someone (read: male chauvinist pig) says something that re­minds us we're not in those shoes. 
So we're not white men. I, for one, am glad. They have to deal with all the ordinary hazards of life as well as potshots from every group looking for some­one to blame for their real or imagined problems. 
Racism and sexism are magic words. If I think I should have gotten a better deal in life, all I have to do is whisper "sexism," and suddenly I have a righteous cause with the moral approba­tion of society behind me to aid in redressing the wrong. If a white man thinks he should have gotten a better deal from life, that's too bad. 
All things considered, I'm pretty well off. And just think, if I were a man, I couldn't write an article like this and still hold my head up in academia. I guess freedom of expression applies only to women and mi­norities.

GARRY TRUDEAU QUOTE OF THE DAY 
Dear Editor: 
So this is the Year of Women. And from some of the articles I've been reading, it's a time for women to throw off the shack­les of discrimination forced upon them by the white males of this University (and of the world, for that matter). To be sure, Notre Dame is not alone in this. Women's issues are a hot topic at many universities. 
This is rather odd. To think that I have lived twenty-one years as a member of a down­trodden segment of society and never knew it. Now here I am in law school. How I ever man­aged to make it after having a white male undergraduate ad­visor helping me plan my life, I'll never know. I guess I heroically ignored his insidious insinuations and plunged into the fray. 
I've always thought I had the

In response to the editorial published in The Observer on Monday, Sept. 24, The Student Union Board of the University of Notre Dame apologizes for the inconvenience to the stu­dents of Saint Mary's who commuted to Notre Dame for the MSU ticket lottery. 
It is necessary to note that the SUB is not an extension of the Athletic Department's ticket office. Their policy of allowing St. Mary's students to purchase season football tickets for home games has been a long standing policy. SUB ticket lottery policy allows only Notre Dame students to enter the lottery to purchase away football game tickets. This rationale stems from SUB receiving its funding from the Notre Dame Student Activity Fee which permits SUB to perform its programs and services. 
Since Notre Dame alumni receive priority for away football game tickets, a very limited number of tickets are made available for the student body to purchase. Since the demand for tickets is so great, the situation forces SUB to limit the lottery to Notre Dame students. 
In light of last year's lottery, we feel the Services Commission's lottery ran smoothly. Once again, SUB apologizes to the Saint Mary's community for the ambiguity of the ad.

Women's IH football action begins 
By HUGH MUNDY Sports Writer 
/\lthough most eyes worn focused on Notre Dame's thrilling come from behind vic­tory over Michigan State last Saturday. another equally nx­eiting brand of Irish football got undnrway over the wenkend as tho Women's Intnrhall League kicked ofT its snason. 
Tlw aetion began as Pasquerilla East squared off against Siegfrind in what prornis1~d to lw a eompntitive match up. Both teams utilized strong defensive play as P.E. sqtwaked out a 7-0 vietory. 
I'.E captain B1~th Strom was plnasPd with l11~r team's per­formance and is almady look­ing towards Wednesday's match-up with Knott. "We hope to keep playing well," she said. 
In tlw second game, penm­nial pownr Lewis startNI off' its snason on a winning note, soundly dPI'nating Knott, 22-0. Captain Sue Lippa nxpects anotl1

In a mueh closer contest, Pasqunrilla West posted a 6-0 win over Farley in a battle be­tween two squads who face re­building years. "This season will serve as a transitional stage for us,"said Farley cap­tain Kate Monaghan. "We won't bn as strong as in previ­ous years." 
The day's biggest upset was recordnd by Breen-Philips whieh handed defending champion lloward a 20-14 defeat.

ends season 
By CHRIS BACON Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
The Saint Mary's tennis team completed its fall season last weekend, placing fourth in the Saint Mary's Invitational. 
The Belles ended the tourna­ment with a total of 27 points, with a first-place, two second-place, and one third-place finished. Butler University captured the tournament title for the second year in a row, tallying 42 points. Bradley University placed second with 30 points and Transylvania College placed third with 29 points. 
"I was very happy with their playing. They put everything into it. The weather was awful, but they never gave up," said Belles coach Shelley Schultz. 
In the singles competition, number-one Sarah Mayer captured second place, losing in the finals to her Butler University opponent, 6-3, 6-1. 
In the number-two competi­tion, junior Ellen Mayer cap­tured first place after beating her Hillsdale College opponent in three sets, 6-1, 1-6, 6-2. 
"Ellen just played superb. In the finals, it was as evenly rnatehed as two could be. Both girls worked hard for each point," eoach Schultz said. 
Sophomore Natalie Kloepfer and freshmen Thayma Darby and Mary Cosgrove made it into Sunday's eonsolation tourna­ment after winning two matches eaeh on Saturday. The girls played in pro-sets due to the bad weather. 
In the number-four competi­tion, Kloepfer lost her match 10-2 to her Bradley University opponent. Darby also lost to her Transylvania opponent 10­
5. However, Cosgrove turned in a fine performance as she escaped her Transylvania op­ponent 10-8, taking third in the number-six competition. 
In the doubles competition, the number-two team of junior Marie Koscielski and Kloepfer placed second after losing to their Butler University opponents in straight sets, 6-2, 6-1, in the final round. 
"The competition was very good. There were no blow off points. Every team had to work for their points," Coach Schultz said.

thosn saves, however. eamn in the second half, when the Irish were substituting frnPiy. 
"Their goalie was outstand· ing," said an impressed Petrucelli. "She probably had more irnpaet on the gamn than anyone else." 
Forward Tasha Strawbridgn finished the scoring with an as­sist from sophomore Denise Chabot. Chabot finished the game with ten shots, all coming in the second half. 
On the Irish side, the play of sophomore Marta Hoemer and junior Molly Lennon, both products of South Bend /\darns High School, caught the atten­tion of Petrucelli. 
"I think they both did a gn~at job. We had a whole new group of players in during the seeond half and they eame in and played well when they needed to," Petrucelli said. 
While eoming off the bnnch may seem to be an unenviable task to some, Hoemer makes the best of the situation. 
"It's frustrating, but it's a good experience also," said Hoerner, who finished with six shots. "We get to hear what coach wants everyone do to, and then we go in and do it. With the quality starters we have and our style of play, its easy for us to eonw in and give the team a lift." said Hoemer. 
1\fter three straight games of allowing only two shots on goal, the defense onee again dominated, keeping IUSB from forming any kind of offensive threat. 
Although the Irish may have been looking towards upcoming weekend games at Indiana and Louisville, Petrucelli realizes that his team cannot be up for every outing. 
"We're much better than we showed,"said Petrucelli. "We just had a lot of people going through the motions." 
Motions or not, the Irish con­tinued its dominance of IUSB, now winless in five attempts against Notre Dame.

Saint Mary's wins two and loses first; team goes to 6-1 
By CHRIS BACON 
Saint Mary's Sports Editor 

The Saint Mary's soccer team improved its record Tuesday to 6-1, defeating the De Pauw Tigers 2-1. 
Action began in the first half as senior captain Trisha Troester fired a shot from the far post, past the Tigers' goal­keeper. The unassisted goal put the Belles ahead 1-0, but the Tigers rallied back, squeezing the ball past Saint Mary's de­fense, to keep themselves in the game. 
In the second half, the Belles took control of the game, of­fensively as well as defensively. Sophomore Stacy Winget scored the Belles' second goal off of a heading flick from senior co­captain Amy Ross. The Belles' defense held the Tigers in the second half to seal the victory. 
"We need to seize our oppor­tunities when they arise. We need to take better advantage of the opportunities that are handed to us," said Belles coach Tom van Meter of the lost scoring opportunities for the Belles. 
The Belles played two road games in earlier action. On Friday, they travelled to Marquette University and blanked the Warriors, winning 1-0. The Belles' only score in the match came late in the first half, off of a direct kick by sophomore Greer Gilliland. 
"It was a competitive game," Coach Van Meter said, " chal­lenging our offensive and de­fensive skills throughout the match." This was the Belles' third consecutive win against the Warriors. 
Last Saturday, the Belles vis­ited the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee. The Panthers handed Saint Mary's its first loss of the season, beating the Belles 3-0. "The game shows us that we are not perfect and we are constantly progressing with some need of improvement and growth," Coach van Meter said. 
The Belles next game is at home this Sunday against Western Michigan University.

Jays lose, lead Sox half-game 
Toronto had its American League East lead whittled to a half-game Wednesday night as Milwaukee's Ron Robinson pitched a seven-hitter and Paul Molitor homered in the Brewers' 6-0 victory over the Blue Jays. 
While Toronto lost to Milwaukee for the second straight night, second-place Boston defeated Cleveland 7-2. 
Robinson (12-4) won for the eighth time in nine decisions and pitched out of several jams in recording his second shutout of the season and career. 
Molitor hit his 12th homer of the season leading off the first -the 27th time in his career he has Jed off with a homer -off David Wells (11-5). Dale Sveum drove in two runs with a sacri­fice fly in the second inning and a single in the eighth and Robin Yount had two RBI singles. 
Red Sox 7, Indians 2 

Luis Rivera's two-run single capped a five-run first inning that included five hits, two er­rors, a balk and a wild pitch and Boston snapped a three­game losing streak. The Red Sox' 13-hit attack was their biggest production since Sept. 12 and included three hits by Carlos Quintana and a homer by Mike Greenwell. 
Rookie Dana Kiecker (8-9) struggled through wildness for the victory with help from Larry Andersen and Jeff Gray. Kiecker allowed a run and two hits in six innings but was re­placed by Andersen after issu­ing his seventh walk to start the seventh. 
Loser Tom Candiotti (14-11) 
was tagged for five runs in 
Boston's biggest inning since a 
five-run eighth against Seattle 
on Sept. 8. With one out, 
Quintana beat out an infield hit 
and continued to second on 
shortstop Felix Fermin's 
throwing error. Dwight Evans grounded out but Ellis Burks singled, scoring Quintana. 
Burks took second on a balk and went to third on a wild pitch before Greenwell walked. Tom Brunansky and Tony Pena followed with RBI singles. After 
Pena stole second, Rivera 
blooped a two-run single to 
shallow left-center. Greenwell 
homered in the fifth. 


Mets 4, Expos 0 

David Cone gave up two hits 
over eight innings and tied th~ 
major league strikeout lead as 
the New York Mets kept their 
pennant hopes alive with a 4-0 
victory over the Montreal 
Expos. 

The Mets remained three 
games behind the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, who beat the Chicago 
Cubs 4-3 earlier to reduce their 
magic number to five. 

Cone (13-1 0) struck out seven 
to reach 221 for the season. 
That is one more than the 
Dodgers' Ramon Martinez and 
left him tied with Texas' Nolan 
Ryan for the major league 
strikeout title. 

Dennis Martinez (10-11) gave 
up three runs and eight hits. 
striking out five and walking 
four in seven innings. 

The Mets scored all the runs 
they needed in the first on an 
RBI double by Dave Magadan 
and RBI single by Darryl 
Strawberry. 


Pirates 4, Cubs 3 

Zane Smith improved to 6-1 
with Pittsburgh by throwing a 
seven-hitter and Andy Van 
Slyke hit a two-run triple as the 
Pirates lowered their magic 
number to five, beating the 
Chicago Cubs 4-3. 

Van Slyke, overlooked most

Special to the Observer 
The Notre Dame tennis teams received some pleasant news Tuesday when they were ranked in the preseason Volvo Tennis Collegiate Poll. 
The Irish men are 15th, while the women are 25th. 
"I think that's probably a lit­tle high for us with a lot of question marks," men's coach Bob Bayliss said. "A lot will de­pend on how we handle the schedule we have. It (the schedule) is a little ambitious." 
The Irish men will meet six teams in the Top 25, starting with top-ranked Stanford next weekend at Eck Tennis Pavilion. They will also meet No. 2 UCLA, No. 3 Tennessee, No. 5 Georgia, No. 21 North Carolina and No. 22 West Virginia. 
"It (the ranking) is a tribute 
to what we did last year to 
some extent," Bayliss said. 
The women will meet eight 
teams in the Top 25, including 
top-ranked Stanford next 
Friday at Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
They will also play Texas, 
San Diego State, Tennessee. 
South Carolina, Indiana, 
Kentucky and U.S. 
International.

spectacular. Everybody told me to just play sound football. 
"Todd gave me lots of point­ers. When I'd come off the field, he would tell me what the of­fense was going to try to do next, and he told me what to look out for. Todd told me that I have one advantage on him, and that is that as a freshman, nobody coached him play by play like that. He was really a great help to me." 
When it comes to playing for Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz, Lane's attitude is essentially the same. 
"Playing for Lou Holtz? Oh, well, that's an experience, too," said Greg Lane. "You know, it's like they say -he's wonderful. I wouldn't want to be playing anywhere else. I'm really far from home, but I like it here. 
''I'm just happy to play. I 

could have done better. I don't know why they [Michigan State] didn't throw my way more often. It would have been a challenge, but I wouldn't have minded." 
This weekend, the Purdue Boilermakers come to town, and Lane should see action again. He has been projected to play kickoff and punt coverage, as well as defensive back. 
"If Purdue uses their run and shoot, we might have to rotate our defensive backs, so I hope that I can play some," observed Lane. "You would think that they would throw at us a lot. They will probably try to pick on our secondary. When most coaches see a young secondary and know that you start lots of freshman, they figure that they can pass a lot." 
For now, Greg Lane plays the role of a young player standing in for an established performer. But give him time. The position he now rents may someday be his own.

The Olserverh<eme!h Osgood Notre Dame's Alison Lester fends off an IUSB player during the 6-0 Irish victory on Wednesday afternoon. The Irish are ranked eighth in the latest Central Region poll. 

Notre Dame lost its second consecutive game last Saturday against Michigan State. 
In the net yardage column. 
But this time the Irish trailed their opponent by only two yards, 313 to 311. A week earlier, Michigan outgained Notre Dame 443 yards to 399, thanks in large 

part to 253 yards on the ground Frank Pastor (201 by tailback Jon Vaughn). After reviewing film from Notre Football Notebook 
Dame's 28-24 victory over the Wolverines, llead Coach Lou Holtz said that the Irish front seven were not being manhandled by a bigger 
Wolverine lim~. Rather, the Irish suffered from a self­inflicted wound. 
The defense did not move in unison, thereby creating gaps in the line which a cutback runner like Vaughn could easily exploit. And did. 
The damage was cut in half Saturday against Michigan State. With another week to adjust to each other and defensive coordinator Gary Darnell's new. attack-oriented defensive scheme, the Irish surren­dered just 117 rushing yards to the Spartans. 
Holtz's film review was markedly different the second time around. 

"Looking back on the Michigan State game, said the Irish coach, "I thought we played pretty well on defense, particularly the front seven. The most en­couraging thing was that we were able to play the run with some degree of success." 
The young secondary, which lost its senior leader when cornerback Todd Lyght aggravated a hamstring injury in the Michigan game, conceded 196 yards through the air to Michigan State, only six more than the Lyght-led secondary allowed Michigan. 
"The younger players performed well," said Holtz. "I thought for the first game Greg Lane did well, Tommy Carter came in and did some good things. Greg Davis played a very, very fine game. 
"The discouraging thing on defense was that on one drive they (Michigan State] converted four third down­and-long situations on passes." 
The secondary will likely take longer to form a co­hesive unit since .its members do not enjoy the same familiarity with one another's playing styles that helped solidify the front seven. 
Lyght's absence, coupled with free safety George Poorman's knee injury, could mean that as many as two freshmen (Carter and Lane) and a recently-con­verted running back (Reggie Brooks) will join Davis in defending Purdue's run-and-shoot passing attack this Saturday. 
Clint Johnson can't be blamed if he seems slightly confused about which position coach to report to following practice. 
Recruited as a wide receiver out of Florida's Lake Brantley High School, Johnson worked with the Irish quarterbacks throughout most of preseason practice. 
Tuesday, Holtz decided to givo the 5-10, 175-pound freshman a look at cornerback, whore he worked with the second team defense. 
Freshman Jim Flanigan, who has soen considerable action on the special teams, tore his thigh muscle during pregame warmups on Saturday. lie will bo out for a couple of weeks. 
Quick tackle Winston Sandri, who sat out the Michigan and Michigan State games with a sprained knee, has practiced with the first-team offense this week and is listed as probable for Saturday's game with Purdue. 
Either Sandri or Peter Rausch could start against the Boilermakers if Gene McGuire remains out of practice with a bruisod shoulder.
