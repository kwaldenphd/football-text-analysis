In an Observer story last week, Associate Vice Pcesi· dent for Residence Ufe John Goldrick said a group of Notre Dame students "caused damage" to the Univer­sity's reputation during a tailgater in Ann Arbor, Mich. 
Subsequendy, the residents of an entire dormitory were punishedfor the actions ofa few students. Accord­ing to Goldrick, they were disciplined not because of infractions against the alcohol policy or the new tail­gater policy.

continue to get obnoxiously drunk after they have long since graduated. 
Let's not take either of these cases too seriously, be· cause neither has any effect on the job we here at Notre Dame are doing. 
I seriously wonder what great ill would have befallen the University if they had ignored the matter and not initiated one more episode ofstudent alienation. 
I hope it was worth it. Rude off-campus behavior by those afliliated with Notre Dame is a reflection 


and when is a Notre Dame 
student not answerable to 
the Office ofStudent Affairs? 
I hope they will not call me 
in for offenses committed after I graduate. 
This policy is not a very good way to build a reputa· tion if the University in question must babysit its stu­dents when they are hundreds of miles off campus and school is not even in session. 
People may wonder, "What son ofbeast do they turn out over there at Notre Dame that they must monitor them so?" 
The lesson here is simple, ifyou would like to express yourself in a less-than-traditional fashion, and you are not willing to risk your diploma, be cenain you have disassociated yourself completely from Our Lady. 
For Notre Dame has made a conscious choice to cater to the opinion ofa few outside ofour community at the expense of those many within. Notre Dame has quite deliberately chosen to exert time and effon in "seeking the bubble of reputation," and, as students, we are paying the price for this exercise ofbad judgment. 
And this decision is a complete and terrible shame.

Principle is Important 
Parietals are a positive influence on the residentiality of Notre Dame and distinguish it from other universities. Unfortunately, the severe penalty inflicted upon students who violate this rule also distinguishes Notre Dame. 
The punishment of suspension or dismissal regardless of circumstances contradicts the Catholic nature off the University. Removing a student from Notre Dame when there is no moral issue in question is detrimental to both the students and our community. When the punishment is so unforgiving that it denies the Notre Dame and Christian ideals of compassion for one's fellow man in a time of real need, something is wrong with the principle. 
This has been the case recently and will continue to blemish the character of the school unless you, the alumni, parents, students and faculty of the University, take action against this unjust penalty. Please take the time to write Vice President of Student Affairs Father David Tyson to show your displeasure with this punishment. Don't allow the opportunity to pass-act now.

i( Dear Fellow Students:
•
i( In the past few days there have been many questions asked of me as toi( what student government's stance is on various issues, as well as whati( we are doing. The following is a brief summary: 
i( 1. South African Investments: As I mentioned at the rally, we will ~ bring the issue of divestment to the students in the form of a ~ referendum. If the students call for divestment, then I willi( personally bring this demand to the chairman of the Board of Trustees ~ and Father Hesburgh. At the request of John Dettling and Pat
J: Baccanari, we will request that the Board of Trustees set up a ~ permanent committee on the South African Issue. 
~ 2. Dillon Tailgater: I have expressed my full dissatisfaction with the ~ handling of this case to Mr. John Goldrick. I requested that a fulli( explanation of the administration's actions be presented to the student 
body. The whole question of how far the disciplinary hand Jf the ~ administration goes will be brought up at the first C.L.C. meeting this ~ month. Yes, we must stop this encroachment of our rights. 
i( 3. The Student Senate: This body has proven that it is totalyi( ineffective. In the past three years it has accomplished absolutely ~ nothing. I am willing to listen to many members of the senate call me
J: names in The Observer, but the students will not miss this political ~ body. (T~last decision they made was to say that we cannot bring thei( South African Issue to the students in the form of a referendum. Wei( will anyway. ) 
i( Other things we are ~orking on: 

~ 4. Because the administration is spending over 1/2 of a millon dollars ~ on a fountain, I made a request that $100,000 be spent to fix-up Senior ~ Bar. I made this request because I feel it is time the administration
J: started caring about our.social life rather than just the beauty of the ~ campus. It has been over two weeks since I wrote the letter to Fr.i( Hesburgh; I have yet to recieve a reply. 
i( 5. At the upcoming Board of Trustee's meeting I will request. that ai( student be put on that board with full voting rights. It is time that ~ the students have some say over their life at Notre Dame. In this way ~ the possibility for real change for the students can be made. 
~ 6. Kevin Hurley-The first 2 days of our ~lood drive broke the record ~ at Notre Dame for first time donors. As well, our fund drive hasi( collected in excess of $1,000. We are flanning a Christmas fundi( raising event with the help of St. Mary s a~.d all others who wish toi( assist us. 
i( 7. We have had brief talks with administration officials about the ~ possibility of lightening the alcohol policy, holding Little Sib's

J: Weekend, and the parietals issue. While we claim no obvious victories, ~ it appears that the possibility for change still does exist. With ~ continued united efforts, we can convincingly argue for the rights of ~ the student body. 
i( 8. We have organized a committee on minority rights that will enable ~ minorities to express their concerns about student life, as well as ~ their feelings on how it should be changed. A detailed report fromi( this committee is being prepared for presentation to the Board ofi( Trustees. (See Marsha Auls if you would like to get involved.) 
i( 9. United Way-We have two excellent chairmen, Mike Huber and Bob ~ McNamara, and the two weeks after break you will be able to participate ~ in a variety of so~ial events in order to raise money for those who ~ need it. For those who participated in the Rock-a-like last year, wei( are having another one this year! 
i( We have made many plans for this year. Unfortunately, it is sometimesi( hard to communicate what we are trying to achieve. Duane and I have ~ decided to attend the hall council meetings in each dorm from now on so
J: 
that the students may communicate to us what it is they want, and so ~ that we can better get a feel for the way you want us to address ~ things. If you want us to be loud and vocal in our fight for student

J: 
rights, and you want our fight to be held publicly in The Observer, ~ then we will do so. --­


~ Please always know that we are trying to serve the students who elected ~ us. Our goals are high, even though at times we have failed in ouri( methods. We need to now turn towards making a united front in our ~ efforts. I would like to thank the HPC for their support; and I would ~ like to thank the students for their continued support.

The l1lly Endowment Inc., of In­dianapolis has awarded a grant of 125,000 to the: Notre: Dame: Institute: for Scholarship in the: Ubc:ral Arts for a program to strengthen academic advising in the: Colle:~ of Arts and Letters.

AIDS victims warned 

f 
SAN ANTONIO, Texas -The city health department has hand­delivered letters to 14 AIDS victims warning that sexual activity will result in felony charges, and the mayor said carriers of the disease should "transcend their individual rights" in deference to society. 
1be letters dispatched this week also order the AIDS victims to avoid exposing others to the disease through sharing needles or donating blood or plasma, and to caution physicians and dentists with whom they come into contact. 
"I think most people arc reasonable and that they will follow the last paragraph in the letter 'to ac­cept this letter in the spirit in which it was intended and help me in my effort to protect the public health,' " Dr. Courand Rothe, director of the health department, said Thursday. 
Rothe said he became concerned about the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome after a male prostitute in Houston, who is an AIDS victim, said he would con­tinue to engage in sexual activity. 
Seventeen people are known to have AIDS in the San Antonio area, but letters were sent to only 14, Rothe said. There is no concern about the three others spreading the disease, he said, but declined to elaborate. 
INDIANAPOUS -The prolonged 

execution  of  William  Vandiver,  
Which  required  five  jolts  of  
electricity  over  17  minutes,  

demonstrates a need for a more humane form of execution, two legislators say. 
Rep. Chester Dobis, D-Merrillvillc, said he and Rep. John Donaldson, R-Lcbanon, plan to in­troduce to the 1986 General As-Auto strike could end if Chrysler 'loosens up' 

M-odRed PftN 
HIGHLAND PARK, Mich.-Chrys­ler Corp., losing an estimated $15 million a day from a strike by 80,000 
U.S. and Canadian workers, could settle the walkout quickly ifit would "loosen up a bit,'' a union negotiator said Thursday. 
But one determined striker said the company would face a "long, cold winter" unless company Chair­man Lee Iacocca helps end the walkout. 
1be autoworkers, who gave up an estimated S1 billion in concessions to help the carmaker survive a brush with bankruptcy, "feel betrayed" by Iacocca, said Wilbur Spencer, presi­dent of United Auto Workers Local 227 at Chrysler's Detroit glass plant. 
"We took concessions and what did they do? They slapped us in the face," said Allan Dean, a 21-year Chrysler worker who repairs engine cylinder heads.

mouth among friends,'' Finch said, and culminated in the circulation of the petition. 
ffthe group's drive is successful, a recall vote will be held within two weeks of the presentation of the petition. 
Atwo-thirds majority ofvotes cast would be necessary to remove Healy and Lawrence from office. 
H Healy and Lawrence were recalled, an election would be held to fill the vacated offices. Healy and Lawrence would beeligible to run in this election. 
"The idea behind the recall is it gives Bill Healy a chance to state his positions; it forces him to state his positions," Finch said. "It's best for both sides, both pro·Bill Healy and con-Bill Healy. 
"And it allows for an alternative candidate," she said. 
1be group has not endorsed a can­didate for either office, Krais said. "We're not endorsing anyone. 
"We have not had one come for­ward. H he is recalled, ofcourse we· tnight support someone but it's too early in the ball game for that," Krais said 
"Right now our objective is to get Healy out ofoffice."

sembly a bill that would allow death row inmates to choose lethal injec­tion. 
"Some people say there is no humane way," Donaldson said. "But I don't think we want to go back to the guillotine." 
Dobis said a bill to allow lethal in­jection in Indiana had failed three times, twice in the House, including the last session, and once in the Senate. 

But Vandiver's execution early Wednesday made the timing "absolutelyperfect and 1986may be the time to reintroduce it and hope for its passage," Dobis told the In­dianapolis Star. 
"From everything that I've read on the subject, it is an absolutely painless way," Dobis said. "I think we can take an example from some of the other states around the country which at least give the con­demned person a choice."

U.S. faces challenges in hijack aftermath 
Aaeodated ..._. 
WASHINGTON-After basking in 'the triumph of the capture of the hijackers of the Achille Lauro, the Reagan administration now must deal with d:le unfavorable conse­quences, underscored by the f:illl of an Italian government long sup­portive ofAmerican interests. 
Particularly disturbing to some is 
that a terrorist incident could have 
led to the resignation ofthe govern­
ment of Premier Bettino Craxi of 
Italy, an important NATO ally. 
"We all have been trying to show terrorists can't achieve anything by what they do,'' said Helmut Sonnen­feldt, a former senior Nixon ad­ministration official who is now a guest scholar at the Brookings In­stitution here. "The terrorists didn't Intend to overthrow the Italian government, but it is unfortunate that a terrorist incident can have an effect ofthis magnitude." 
Sonnenfeldt said the Craxi 
government "has been on the whole 
a very good and effective govern­
ment from an American standpoint 
and a NATO standpoint. To lose this 
government is a setback." 
The consequences of the Achille Lauro hijacking, including the American seizing of an Egyptian aircraft cari-ying the fleeing hijack­ers, continue to grow. Most of the positive gains were immediately ap­parent. Some of the negative ones have taken longer to develop. 
Not the least of the positive gains is a feeling by Americans that after years of painful losses to terrorists, the national pride has finally been upheld with the capture of the accused murderers of 69-year-old Leon Klinghoffer. 
In addition, the capture of the 
hijackers showed an American firm­
ness and level of technological ex­
penise that will improve the 
nation's ability to deal with future 
terrorist attacks, experts say. 
The degree of international 
cooperation in denying a safe pon to 
the hijackers while they were on the 
ship shows that international 
cooperation can be effective. 
The already close bonds between the United States and Israel may be strengthened even more, as Israeli leaders believe their rejection ofthe Palestine Uberation Organization as a terrorist group has been vind­icated. Israel hopes Washington will drop plans to include the PW in the Middle East peace process. 
On the negative side, the f:illl ofthe Italian government becomes a major loss. In its current issue, the Economist newspaper of London said the pro-Western Craxi had given Italy one ofits most stable and prosperous governments since World War II and "could be remem­bered as the man who changed his country." 
Another setback is &iction in rela­tions with Egypt, which has long been the United States' chief Arab ally. It could become a major set­back if Washington and Cairo were to let those frictions erode the basic relationship, or ifthe government of President Hosni Mubara.kshould-as some in Washington worry -be ousted byMoslem extremists. 
Mubara.k has demanded an apol­ogy from President Reagan, but Reagan has refused. 
The U.S.-sponsored search for a Middle East peace could be 4erailed, although it was nearly stalled anyway. The U.S. strategy has focused on bringing the PW and its chairman, Yasser Arafat, into a peace negotiation of some kind with Jor­dan and Israel. But if evidence of PW involvement in the hijacking proves accurate, the PW may now be excluded.

ND volleyball heads west for fall break 

By CHUCK EHRMAN 
Sports Wrl,.,_ 
It's time to go west. That's where the Irish volleyball team is going over break, and the visit should be a challenging one. 
The Irish are headed for Califor­nia, the capital of volleyball excite­ment. The team will play three matches, facing Santa Clara, San Francisco, and California-Berkeley. 
"I don't have any expectations," says coach Art Lamben. "lbis team can be as bad as It can be good. At times we've played great and at ot­her times we haven't played so well." 
For Lambert it's a matter ofwatch­ing and walling. The Irish have been hot and cold all season. But whatever the result, experience will be gained. 
"We're building a program," says Lambert. "We have to play these types ofteams. They're not the very best, but they're good. I'm looking forward to it." 
But before the Irish head olfto the West Coast, they have to face three other tough teams this weekend. 
Friday night the team takes to the road to play Missouri. On Saturday the Irish wlll take on conference op­ponent St. Louis. On Sunday they play once more, this time at Oregon. 
After those three games the Irish wlll have the day olf before all the fun begins on Tuesday In the vol­leyball mecca on the West Coast. 
Notre Dame, 6-10, is coming olf

Regulations in Du Lac do not allow compassion 
There was recently a violation of parietals for which the parties involved were suspended from the University. There was no question of sexual involvement nor was the integrity of the individuals questioned, but rather it was an issue of time and the con­scious decision ofone friend to help another friend in need. 
Joanie Cahlll a need for change 
One of the two individuals was very dis­traught and a decision was made by the other not to leave her alone. At approximately 2:20 am., both individuals fell asleep until they were found by a security guard at 5:15 am. with the door open and the lights on. 
After the original sentence ofsuspension by the Office ofStudent Affairs, a judicial review board, composed of faculty and staff mem­bers, reviewed the case and replaced the penalty of suspension with a penalty of com­munity service. The decision was then ap­pealed to the President of the University Father Theodore Hesburgh who overturned the decision of the board and reversed the penalty back to suspension. Although the cir­cumstances ofthis case would appear to make it an exception, no exceptions could be made because it would establish a precedent dis­regarding the rules ofDu Lac. 
We are not questioning the actual rules of parietals. What we are questioning is the penalty involved. Du Lac states,"Overnight parietal violations involve suspension or dis­missal." Yet overnight parietals are never defined. At what time does a parietal violation become an "overnight?" Suspension and ex­pulsion are the severest penalties given at this University. Is this punishment in proportion with the offense? 
Notre Dame prides itself on being a Chris­tian, caring community. One of the best parts of attending this University is the sense of family which exists between those who work and study here and those who have attended Notre Dame in the past. This parietal regula­tion does not allow for that concern and caring to be demonstrated. When parents punish a child, because they love that child, the parents give the child a punishment in proportion with the offense. As we see it, and as the judicialreview boardsaw it, this punish­ment is completelyout ofproportion with the "crime" committed. A decision was made not to leave a friend alone in a time ofgreat need. And students unintentionally fall asleep every day ... ask any professor. 

The injustice of this decision seems evi­dent. The decisions made were based on the rule in Du Lac specifically stating overnight parietal violations involve suspension or ex­pulsion. IfDu Lac is to be followed to the let­ter, as it was in this case, then the rules need to be changed. The administratorsofthis Univer­sity should be able to look at each case in­dividually, at the circumstances and the individuals involved, and then decide upon an appropriate punishment based upon these facts. 
Parietal violations occur within the halls. They are part of residence life. It would seem to follow that rectors should be able to ex­ercise their· own discretion in deciding if a specific parietal violation is a serious violation which should be handed up to Student Affairs. What makes a case serious? The presence ofa sexual issue? The intent to break parietals? The reasons for breaking parietals? Or merely the time at which the individuals were "discovered?" 
These questions need to be addressed. The regulations in Du Lac do not allow human compassion to be considered in deciding a case. In cases such as this, they do not even allow for justice. We all make mistakes; that is part ofbeing human.Jesus is the one who said to forgive.

Smokers and non-smokers should live together 
When I first came to Notre Dame two months ago, I was surprised to see the number of students .concerned with physical fitness and health. Everywhere I went, I saw students shooting baskets, playing football, or jogging around Saint Mary's lake. (The only people who come by Carroll Hall are joggers.) I also noticed that very few people smoked on campus. Because I am a smoker, I noticed this fact right away. 
Mike O'Connell 

pipe dream 
Because the majority of Notre Dame stu­dents are non-smokers, I think there are a lot of misconceptions about smokers. Now don't get me wrong. Notre Dame has the healthiest students in America; I think that is great. I just want to clear up some of the misconceptions about smokers so we can live together as a stronger community. 
Fiest of all, smokers are not Inherently bad people. We are not suicidal, and we are not out to bother people in public places. We are just ordinary people who happen to be ad­dicted to a drug called nicotine. And contrary to popular belief,we do know smokingcauses cancer. So there is no need to walk up to a total stranger who happens to be smoking a cigarette and say, "Hey, don't you know that causes cancer?" 
Of course, if you have a friend or someone dose to you that smokes, you can tell that per­son to please quit because you care about him. Maybe you can give that person the incentive to quit just by showing you care. 

Another problem between smokers and non-smokers occurs in public places; Do smokers have the right to smoke? Do non­smokers have the right to dean air? There are no clear-cut answers, but I think common courtesy can solve many of these problems. Many times a non-smoker is bothered by someone smoking nearby because ofallergies to smoke or some other reason. Instead of causing a disturbance, merely ask the smoker if he would please extinguish his cigarette. You will find that many smokers will stop, if you ask them politely. 
Well, we all have to live together, smokers and non-smokers alike. Because we are all members of the Notre Dame community, we have to be courteous and respect the rights of others. Smokers are literally a dying breed; eit­her they quit smoking, or they actually die of cancer. Fortunately, the majority of smokers have chosen the first alternative. But for those of us who have not, we need the support and understanding ofnon-smokers in order to quit smoking once and for all. 
Keep in mind that the first step must come from the smoker. If he does not want to quit, he is not going to quit. And more importantly, no one has the right to try to make him quit anyway. So don't look down on us; we are not bad people. And do not feel sorry for us; it's our own fault if we die of cancer. Just try to understand where we are coming from. And together, smokers and non-smokers, can coexist without bothering each other so much.

Students must keep forcing opinion on divestment 
Congratulations to all who heard the call to rally in my last column. I really never meant to put down the efforts of those who have been working on global causes. I just wanted to raise a little student activism. Obviously, the student body is alive and kicking, as evidenced by the support at the recent rallies against apartheid and world hunger. 
Barbara Blanchette with earnest 
Many concerned groups, Involving hundreds of students, have voiced their opinions to an administration which must now decide how to best react. We now must wait for the final word from above. 
Will they see and understand signs hung prominently on campus, draped from win­dows, hung over doorways? Will this be a con-
Doenesbury 
elusive eye and eartest to give students a dear idea that the administration is neither deafnor blind to student opinion? 
Since Friday's apartheid rally, criticisms of University President Theodore Hesburgh have been voiced by civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson. In a rally at Roosevelt Uni­verstiy earlier this week, Jackson questioned Hesburgh's "unbiblical" policy of not divest­ing the University's investments in South Africa. By doing this, Jackson brought Notre Dame's position under the public eye. 
This external criticism ought to raise some eyebrows among those who are trying to maintain the University's image through all of this. Some national attention is to be ex­pected, yet we must be somewhat concerned about whether Notre Dame's golden dome will be tarnished when this is all over. On the human rights side of things, we might also wonder whether the South African crisis will end while there are still a few South Africans left to rejoice. 

Students who feel their pleas are falling on deaf ears may want to tune in carefully to up­coming University actions. National attention may bringa brand new bearing on this issue of local concern, but this is also a period in which the Universitycanshowit is affected by the opinions and beliefS ofits students. 
Considerable student reaction and con­tinued demonstrations will force the ad­ministration to keep its eyes and ears open to those in whose best interests it must act. Campus-wide education about the issues af­fecting corporate and University positions in this crisis must maintain an atmosphere in which the problem cannot be forgotten. Now that we are up and kicking at the dirt we've raised, we need to be heard. 
The only proof we can ask that the ad­ministration does heed us, is immediate ac­tion to suit our response. This must be directed action, and ought to have a thrust in

Back to the question of the student body being heard. Ifyour voice seems to be a small whimper in the face of official roaring, con· sider the mythological thorn which ef­fectively crippled the mighty lion. Vocalize your emotions anyway, and continue to push for what you believe your University ought to do. 
Remember, midsemester break is creeping up on us, and perhaps there will be those ed­ucated folk who have an idea that universities and corporations alike ought to divest from the touchy situation in Pretoria, South Africa. You are a student at a large Catholic institu­tion, known to express compassion in interna­tional situations of human injustice. What is your University doing about this?

Negotiations will do much more than sanctions do 
The white government of South Africa has maintained Irs power over an overwhelming black majority by a system of apanheld (separation of the races) in which it denies blacks citizenship, the right to own land, the right to vote and many other privileges we in the United States consider basic human rights. The debate rages on over the moral and ethi­cal implications ofapartheid, and also over the actions other nations should take to help ac­celerate racial refoems in South Africa. 
Ken Andre III 

guest column 
Newspapers headline the issue almost daily. College students gather to show their support for black leaders such as Nelson Mandela and Bishop Desmond Tutu, and Congress debates pos.~ible sanctions against the white govern­ment all aimed at ending the 37-year-old sys­tem of apartheid imposed by P.W. Borha's National Party. Proponenrs of sanctions against South Africa claim it is our moral duty to help others struggling for freedom by im­posing trade and economic sanctions on the white government, while others, like Presi­dent Reagan, argue for a policy ofconstructive engagement in which our government tries to bring about reform through diplomatic chan­nels. 
Economic sanctions have not been adopted by the United States for three basic reasons. First, they wlll make the white government more self-sufficient and able to resist outside pressures. Second, the situation is a political one and is thus best handled through diplomatic channels and not through economic ones. Finally, the United States would suffer heavy losses with little if any benefits resulting from such a policy. 
Apartheid, a political problem, should be handled through political and diplomatic channels and not through economic sanc­tions. Let's not confuse apples with oranges. President Reagan's policy of constructive engagement is attempting to put pressure on South Africa to end apartheid through friendly persuasion. 
We should not forget the disastrous situa­tions that have resulted when, because of political pressure, economic theory was Ignored In favor of sllck political solutions, such as the Smoot-Hawley tariffs that resulted in runaway inflation and protectionist pollcies 
by other countries. 
Because the most popular solution to the 
problem of apanheid, namely sanctions, is an 
economic issue, it is possible to analyze the 
situation using cost-benefit analysis. What are 
the cosrs ofsanctions to the United States and 
will sanctions end apanheid? 
The answer, from both a historical and 
theoretical view, is that South Africa will lose 
very little, and that the United States stands to 
lose billions of dollars in lost trade without 
bringing.about an end to apanheid. 
South Africa would suffer oniy a temporary 
supply shock due to U.S. sanctions. Other na­
tions, like Japan, Britain and West Germany 
would move in quickly to supply needed 
finished goods and high-tech items. 
Moreover, economic sanctions have histori­
cally led to the increased strength and self­
sufficiency of the sanctioned nation. This was 
especially true ofthe U.N. sponsored embargo 
of Rhodesia from 1965-1979 which 
strengthened the resolve ofRhodesian leaders 
to continue their policies. 
Sanctions actually helped to Improve the economy of Rhodesia by decreasing imports and forcing Rhodesia to build up its industrial base, thus Increasing exporrs. The more self­sufficient South Africa becomes the less coercive force the U.S. will have and the less likely the South African government will give in to U.S. demands. Further, a study by Gary Hufbauer and jeffrey Schott ofthe Institute for International Economics found that sanctions arc least successful In achieving foreign policy goals such as ending apanheid. 
As far as the United States is concerned, ec­nomic and trade sanctions against South Africa could cost U.S. industries billions ofdol­lars in lost sales of finished goods, and also result in higher prices and shortages of rare metals supplied by South Africa. South Africa now supplies 50 percent of U.S. platinum, used for pollution control, 44 percent of U.S. vanadium, used for aircraft frames and engines, 31 percent ofthe manganese, used to harden steel, and 55 percent ofthe chromium, used to make stainless steel. 
These raw materials could be purchased from Zambia, Zaire, and Zimbabwe, South Africa's closest neighbors, but the cost in­curred would be higher and the ore must still be shipped through South Africa to ports. Cutoff of these metals could cripple the key 
U.S. industries of defense and automobiles. 

There could also be some lasting effecrs of trade· sanctions on South Africa. The U.S. Inter­national Trade Commission had found evidc:nce to suggest that by imposing economic sanctions on nations for forelgr. policy reasons the United States is gaining a reputation as an unreliable supplier. 
Virtually everyone would agree that the South African system of apanheid is unjust and should be abolished quickly. Economic sanctions, however, are not the way to end apar1theid. As former Defense Secretary, james Schlesinger, stated, "They appeal to Americans because because they seem to be a substitute for the stiffer measures that may be required." 
Sanctions will fail to change the South African government's policy towards blacks and could in fact strengthen the country's economy while at the same time costing the United States billions of dollars. Let us leave this problem to the diplomatic negotiators.

ALP A students dese"e a better program soon 
The Arrs and Letters Program for Ad­ministrators, commonly known as ALPA, has serious problems that must be solved if it is to be a practical option for ans and letters stu­denrs. 
Brian McCarthy 
the reason's edge 
The ALPA program requires students to take eight courses. In the College of Arts and Lc:tters, the student must take the Introduc­tory economics course ECON 115 or 225 and the statistics course AL 300. In the College of Business Administration, the student takes the four principle introductory courses in ac­counting, management, marketing and finance. To complete the program the student takes any two business-oriented electives. 
ALPA was first offered in the academic year 1980-81. It was designed to meet the needs of students who wanted a liberal arts degree but needed some business background after graduation. 
The designers ofthe program believed only about 30 students in each of the three upper classes would be interested. The business col­lege decided it could handle 90 more studenrs with little difllculty and reserved slors in many of their courses for ans and letters studenrs. 
In the first year, ALPA attracted even fewer than the projected 30 students per class; however, word quickly spread and the enroll­ment in the program took off. 
Currently, the program has over 170 stu­dents in each class. Surprisingly, the growth was not anticipated. The arts and letters col­lege should have recog.nized the opportunity ALPA provided its studenrs. 
Prior to ALPA, a student who wanted a job In business was apprehensive about an ans and letters major that did not directly prepare him for business. ALPA gave him the oppor­tunity to have the major he wanted and get a business background. With the great amount of pressure on studcnrs to make themselves marketable, ALPA became the answer. 
The business college could no longer handle the influx of ALPA studenrs and was forced to change its policy. Beginning in the fall of 1984, ALPA studenrs were not allowed into any business classes besides the four in­troductory courses. Suddenly, ALPA students had to get two business electives without access to the upper level business courses. 
This reaction by the business college is quite understandable. They have a respon­sibility to its students. The large number of ALPA students was making classes over-sized and closing out courses for many business stu­denrs. 
Despite the close-out, there are alternatives for ALPA students. Each semester ALPA stu­dents are sent a list of courses offered by arts and letters depanmenrs that are acceptable ALPA electives. These include a course in cor­porate advertising offered by the an depan­ment and courses in government and economics. 
These courses are relevant to business but, for the most pan, they cannot be viewed as replacemenrs for upper level accounting and finance courses. When hiring, many com­panies want to see at least nine credit hours in a discipline before they consider it a solid background. The arts and letters college can­not provide such a background for irs stu­dents. 
Fortunately, for the ALPA students, Saint Mary's Business/ Economics department came to the rescue. Saint Mary's has allowed Notre Dame students into all their business courses, providing there is space available. Without this help, the ALPA program would 

have faced a crisis last year; however, these 
courses rapidly fill-up with Notre Dame stu­
denrs, leaving many others still in search ofan 
elective. 
Another possibility for ALPA studenrs is to 
enroll in the business college after taking the 
introductory business courses and finding out 
which area they prefer. As a business student, 
upper level courses will be available. 
Two barriers make this possibility unlikely. 
First, the business college not at all receptive 
to the idea ofa student receivng a dual degree 
in business and arts and letters. An arts and 
letters student might not be allowed in the 
College of Business. 
second, the ALPA program is so crowded studenrs rarely can get even one of the intro­ductory business courses before the junior year. By that time, it is too late to fit in all the business college requlremenrs in the remain­ing 1two or three semesters. 
The ALPA program is up for review by the arts and letters college this semester and something must be done. Hiring business professors to teach in the arts and letters col­Ic~ had been considered and rejected 
Apparently, the arts and letters college feels 
the business college could provide more 
room but refuses to be flexible. The business 
college is the only one of the four colleges at 
the University that does not allow ourside stu­
denrs to take upper level courses. Since ans 
and letters studenrs have been refused admit­
tance to the business courses, some of the 
classes are IDled below capacity, frustrating 
the ALPA majors. 
Although a good idea, the ALPA program is not a viable alternative as currently offered. Thus far, animosity between the two colleges has prevented a solution. If the arts and letters college could restructure the ALPA acquire­ments in order to restrain the number of stu­denrs, the business college might be able to unlock their classroom doors. 
Until the colleges work together, students will continue to be sucked in by the potential of the program, only to be disappointed by irs failure to meet the arts and letters studenrs' needs.

Personal confrontation threatens ND government 
My old friend and stage persona, Mark Twain, once admitted "I don't know much about politics and I'm not staying up nights to learn." Thank God, he did not want to learn about the politics on this campus. It would be a 24 hour a day affair. 
Pete Pranica 

guest column 
It is di.flicult enough to sort out the par­liamentary maneuvering surrounding the pos­sible dissolution ofthe senate and the possible impeachment ofPresident Bill Healy and Vice President Duane Lawrence without having to understand the charges and counter-charges. But whether or not these evenbts come to pass, a tone has been set on the Notre Dame campus. When in doubt-confront. 
Over the past few months we have been treated to a spectacle ofshouts, threats, allega­tions, firings and other assorted un­pleasantrles among the people this campus looks to for leadership. Again, confrontation has been the conversational mode in all in­stance. 
Take The Observer fiasco. Forget the issues so passionately pleadedon both sides and take a look at what really happened Nothing much, right? We are told the letter to Editor-in-Chief Sarah Hamilton concerning the opening ofthe books was "hostile" and spch naughty words as "monitor" appear. ImiJlediately, one side gets angry, chooses sides'and then .... What was gained? Ifyou sawany progress toward an understanding ofThe Observer's finances, let me know. The whole ordeal was an exercise In brinkmanship which would do us and the Soviets proud. 
Two members of the Committee for Responsible Business Practices are dismissed for allegedly Insinuating that one of the trus­tees of the University was lying. Again, the charges fly. "Power play" is a frequently men­tioned term. Was there any constructive dialogue between the dismissed and the dis­missors? Apparently not. When angry, con­front; when very angry, fire. 

If those are not enough, just dissolve a ruling body and then impeach and destroy the quorum, denying the senate the ability to do much of anything. Again, I am not so con­cerned as about who is right and who's wrong because you could poll 50 people and you'd get 50 diJierent analyses and end up where you started. Instead, it is time to be disturbed at the angry young men and women who are supposed to be student leaders. Then again, what can you expect of someone who calls 
the  destruction  of  the  senate  quorum  
..awesome.''  
Reading  about  the  bickering  and  ad  

bomtnem attacks in The Observer is about as entertaining as a bowl of Hungarian noodles baking and is about as appetizing. There is a subtle diJierence between confronting problems and confronting people about problems and just confronting people be­cause they hold an opposite viewpoint. 
I do not speak with a great deal ofexpertise on the subject of student politics, but it ap­pears that what is needed is a little less accusa­tion and a little more cooperation. Granted, that is easier said than done, but it does not appear anyone has tried that approach lately. Everyone is hostile toward the other people. Mutual dislike and distrust accomplish ab­solutely nothing. Why do you think arms talks are so difficult? 
As a student body, we are always lookingfor ways to properly present our side ofthe story to the administration. How canany adult in his right mind look at the mess of mudslinging and take it seriously? While the little kids are playing at politics, the parents are looking on in amuseme·nt. 
But it's not funny. 

like it or not, the student body is looking down both barrels of a shotgun which could potentially cripple student government at Notre Dame. The emphasis on personalities, instead of issues, has cocked the trigger. The real question is: Will the blast kill something with potential or will it merely facilitate a mercy killing?

Error in judgment not worth disrupting two lives 
As students of the University of Notre Dame, we would like to express our frustra­tion and outrage at the University's ad­ministration for the mishandling ofa violation of parietals. While we agree there was a regulation broken, we feel the drastic measures taken against ourfriends, Aimee and Keith, were completely out of proportion to the circumstances. (Last names are being withheld to protect the privacy of those in­volved.)

On Friday, Sept. 20, 198S, Aimee and Keith were having a serious discussion in Aimee's room. Immediately after parietals, they moved their conversation Into the living room of a suite in Lyons Hall because Keith decided Aimee was too emotionally dis­traught to be left alone, and intended to remain a few minutes to calm her down. 

P.O. Box Q 
Healy recognizes need for students' viewpoints 
DearEditor: 

In response to the letters criticizing Bill 
Healy, our student body president, I ask the 
students to consider the true nature ofhis ac­
tions. 

Last weekend, Healy participated In a stu· 
dent leadership weekend, an event he 
coordinated and planned. The purpose ofthis 
weekend was to bring together present and 
past student leaders and key administrative of­
ficials in an effort to discuss students. 

As the weekend progressed, many critical 
issues were discussed with a great deal ofstu­
dent Input. Healy did not "bow" to the ad­
ministrative officials. Instead, he represented 
the students' interests and voiced many ofour 
ideas, problems and questions. 

The success ofthe weekendwas a large step 
forward because many administrative ~ffi­
clals, including University President Father 
Theodore Hesburgh, listened to what we, the Finally, at a time after 2:20 a.m., Aimee and Keith fell asleep with the door open and lights on. The security guard, upon making her rounds at approximately 5 a.m., woke them up and sent Keith home. 
After waiting one emotionally taxing week for notification of the disciplinary measure to be taken, Aimee and Keith were told although theywere, according to DirectorofResidence Life Ann Firth, "wonderful people," they were suspended from the University for the semester, and should be out oftheir dorms by Wednesday, Oct. 2. 
Ann Firth andJohn Goldrick, associate vice president for residence life, suspended the two for making what Firth and Goldrick termed as "an error In judgement." 
Aimee and Keith were not notified by the OfficeofStudent Alfalrs oftheir right to appeal this deeision, but only learned of this right by chance through. a mutual friend. They also were never told by either Firth or Goldrick that they were allowed to have a representative, such as the judicial coor­dinator, present before signing any state­ments. 

Finally, the Student Judicial Coordinator Karen Ingwersen, was contacted by another student on behalfofAimee and Keith, and she prepared their case for the Oct. 7 appeal date set by the Office ofStudent Alfalrs. 
After a more than two-hour hearing on that day, five members of the Judicial Review Board overturned Firth and Goldrick's deci­sion. 
The Board agreed to reduce the punish­ment to community service. 
Firth and Goldrick also had the right to counter-appeal this decision to Father Theodore Hesburgh, University president. They did so, and on Friday, Oct. 11, Aimee and Keith were once again suspended for the semester. 
Is it fair to punish an "error" by disrupting two lives in such an aggressive and permanent manner? Is this a constructive disciplinary measure? Is it proper to disregard the deliberation of the Judicial Review Board in a counter-appeal situation? 
students, had to say. The students and.the ad­ministration discussed many issues in an atmosphere charged with excitement and new ideas, rather than frustration and misun­derstanding. 
One clear message evolved: .the students and the administration must cooperate to solve the critical problems of the student body. Healy recognizes the need for student input in University policies, and he has success-fully represented the students on many key issues. He does not promote change through confrontational attacks because he realizes that, in the past, this method has crippled the effectiveness of student govern­ment. Healy elicits change through new ideas, participation and cooperation on both sides. 
Healy is a man ofcharacter who attends to the needs of all students. In behalf of Kevin Hurley and his family, for example, Healy ar­ranged a campus-wide collection and a Mass. 
He remains open to any and all suggestions from the students, and he upholds the value of student input. As student body president, he has created a channel ofcommunication bet­ween the students and the administration. AI-though it is far from complete, we should praise his success and support him in his at­tempts to ensure that the student voice will be heard.

Healy has exemplified guts and action in office 
DearEditor: 
This letter will talk about two subjects: guts and respect. As our current Student Body President, Bill Healy has shown me more guts in his position than the previous two presi­dents. He has shown himselfto be a person of action. 
For example, after receiving good advice during last weekend's leadership conference, Healy immediately started a campaign to eliminate an unnecessary part of student government, the Student Senate. 
Since the beginning of this year, he and his cabinet have worked to change the attitude of the Board ofTrustees toward the idea ofa stu-
Both Aimee and Keith realize and admit what happened was a violation of parietals as stated in Du Lac and have been completely honest throughout their ordeal. Both are people who have given a great deal to the Notre Dame community as evidenced by their involvement in student activities and their outstanding academic records. 
As Aimee's and Keith's peers, we feel an uni­ntentional violation (not a premeditated abuse), of parietals deserves a less harsh punishment. Students, parents, faculty and ot­her members of the Notre Dame community wishing to express their opinion on this mat­ter should write to Father David Tyson, c/o OBUD. While it is too late to change the deci­sion regarding Aimee and Keith, perhaps by voicing our discontent, other questionable and unconstructive disciplinary measures can be avoided.

dent representative on the board. 
This brings me to the second topic of this letter, respect. Repeatedly, john Dettling and Pat Baccanari showed a lot of disrespect to Board of Trustees Chairman Thomas Carney. Because of this, Dettling and Baccanari were released from their student government jobs. 
I strongly agree with Healy's action in this case. 

As chairman of the Board of Trustees, Car­ney must be given every ounce of respect at all times, and especially in times ofserious dis­cussion. As a trustee, he gives up time that could have been spent on other thin~. He chooses to spend his time trying to improve life at Notre Dame. Because Carney devotes so much time to Notre Dame, Dettling and Bac­canari should have showed respect when they questioned him about why the board acts in the way it does. 
In conclusion, I believe it would be a bad thing to impeach a president like Bill Healy who has shown guts in taking action about thin~ in which he believes.

. Bend's culture is going strong, and so is the South Bend Symphony Orchestra. 
The South Bend Symphony Or­chestra grew out ofa club oflocal musicians who wanted to ha,ve an incentive to play and perform. They played their first concert on Dec. l 7, 1933. After only three seasons the club gained public support and became the South Bend Symphony Orchestra. Today, the orchestra is funded through contributions and ticket sales. 
Aperson who was fundamental to the growth ofthe South Bend Symphony Orchestra is Edwyn H. 
·Hames. Hames was with the or­chestra at its conception and was its musical director for 40 years until his death in 1978. The conductors who have followed Hames, the late Herbert Buder and the present conductor, Kenneth Kiesler, have each added their own special tone and style to !fie orchestra.

Buettner says that it's all worth it, especially when she hears the positive reaction from strangers to a performance.

Only injuries slow him down 
Larkin continues to overcome adversity 
By NICK SCHRANTZ 
Sports Writer 

N 
otre Dame llnebacker Mike l.arldn has faced more 
adversity during his five-year college career than 
some people encounter In a lifetime. He has survived 
and succeeded despite several major Injuries, a position 
change and the relative lack ofsuccess of the team. 
Over the years, many opponents have found It difficult to slow down Larkin. In fact, the only thing able to halt his progress during his career has been injuries. 
In August of 1983, Larkin broke his left arm in the same spot he had during drills the previous spring. This un­fonunate incident forced him to miss that entire season, which proved to be especially disheartening since Larkin was coming off a super sophomore year. 
He appeared ready for the 1984 season, but disaster struck once again as he tore knee ligaments in the final preseason scrimmage. This Injury put Larkin In a cast for several weeks and forced him to miss the first six games of the year. 
The: 1985 season was expected to be the one In which Larkin finally put It all together and had another year like: his sophomore season. 
1be early predictions were not fulfilled, however, as he sprained his ankle against Michigan State In the second

game, causing him to miss the next two games. Good news Is finally here for the Cincinnati, Ohio, native, though, as he should be able to play against Army. 
"I won't be starting Saturday, but I will be ready to play," Larkin reports. "I've been trying to minimize the contact in practice so I can play In cenain situations, like passing downs." 
In spite of these injuries, Larkin has displayed enough spirit, character and talent to be voted as one ofthe four team captains for 1985. The new role gives him many di1fc:rent responsibilities, but these changes have not altered his play on the field. 
"I try not to let (being a captain) affect me on the field," Larkin explains. "As a captain, the other players look to me for leadership and in getting them pepped up. I try to be vocal, but I like to lead by both action and words because both ways help. 
"Being a fifth-year man helps because I've been here longer than most of the players. The others ask ques­tions about the way it was here before because tradition here is so Important and they feel I've been around." 
While leadership is important, no player can be elected captain without proven ability. At the times he's been

In fact, it iS estimated that each visitor to the

Irish Extra -page 1-3 

Facts, opinions and rumors are very different 
Chuck Freeby 
Irish Items 
H ello again everybody! 


It seems that certain colleagues ofmine in the media have had a little bit of a problem distinguishing between fact, opinion and rumor over the past few weeks. This is truly an alarming situation consider­ing that the distinction is such an easy one to make. 
FACT -Gerry Faust is the head football coach at Notre Dame. Presently he is serving the fifth year ofa five-year contract. The fifth year has not finished yet, despite popular opinion. Therefore, Gerry Faust is still the head football coach. 
OPINION -Gerry Faust should or should not be retained as head football coach at Notre Dame. Opinions usually are voiced in bars or columns, and a good argument is necessary in both (although a right cross can be used as a punctuation mark in a bar). 
RUMOR-A reliable source close to the University said Gerry Faust will not be retained as football coach at Notre Dame after this season. He will resign in the next five minutes. That, my friends, is a rumor. 
Please notice the difference between the three. The fact is supported by evidence and comments from administrators. If Gene Corrigan and Gerry Faust both say Faust will be the football coach for the rest ofthe season, that's good enough for me. 
An opinion is simply the thoughts of a person based on his or her perception of the facts. Everybody is certainly entitled to voice his or her opinion, but opinions should not be taken as gospel. 
The rumor certainly looks like the fact upon first glance. When one looks for evidence to support the rumor, however, it's usually im­possible to find. There is nothing in Faust's past to give anybody an indication that Gerry Faust will resign. There is nothing around to give any indication that Notre Dame will not honor its contract. There is nothing around to support the rumors of the last two weekends. 
Still, amazingly enough, people seem to believe everything they hear without thinking. When a New York Times reporter says he heard Gerry Faust tell the team after the Air Force game that he was resign­ing, people believe it. Now, admittedly, the guy works for the Times and not the Post, but let's use a little common sense. 
First of all, why would this guy be able to hear Faust resign when nobody else did? Did he whisper it? Did he use sign language? Did he say it in Yiddish? Of course not. If Faust would have resigned, he would have told Notre Dame officials, who would have set up an impromptu press conference. He would not have given it to just one reporter. 
Last week's rumor carried a little more reliability, simply because it came from Dave Diles. Diles was the man who came up with the story on Dan Devine's resignation, and is well-respected in most circles. However, the Devine announcement was made after con­sulting Devine. 
Last week's announcement by Diles obviously did not follow the same pattern because ifDiles would have contacted Faust, he never would have said Faust would not be rehired. Instead, Diles cited a source close to the University, which takes in everybody within a five-mile radius ofcampus. The folks handingout drinks at Senior Bar are "close to the University," but they aren't truly reliable sources. 
This is not a defense of Gerry Faust because all of the rumors cer­tainly could become more than speculation by the endofthe season. A 1-3 record doesn't do anything to squelch talk of a coaching change, nor do the playercomments that appeared in the Cincinnati Enquirer last Sunday. There is something to be said for ethics and responsibility in journalism, however, both of which have lacked miserably the last two weekends. 
The press certainly has a right to certain things. It can report facts about Gerry Faust's record. It can offer opinions that Faust should resign. Nevertheless, nobody in the media has the right to say Gerry Faust is gone until he is gone. 
Ifthat happens, we'll all find out soon enough. 
Pickofthe Week . One thing that is certainly a fact is that fall break begins Saturday. With a lack of home sporting events this week, the best thing to do is get those midterms out of the way and enjoy the week off. Remember, after fall break there's only 54 days until Christmas break. 
Seriously, though, no matter where you go over the break, proceed with caution. If you're on the highways, keep away from the drinks. Remember, you can't drive your lemon ifyou're already juiced.

Irish offensive tackle jay Underwood (74) blocks a earlier this season. john Coyle features the fifth-year Purdue defender in Notre Dame's 35-17 loss to the Boilers senior in his story below. 

Not a recognizable player 
Importance of Underwood rarely appreciated 

ByJOHN COYLE 
Sports Writer 

J 
ay Underwood is not the most easily recognized player on the Notre Dame football team. He is not like Allen Pinkett or Steve Beuerlein, who because ofthe glamour of their positions are almost constantly in the spotlight. 
The efforts and importance of offensive tackles are rarely appreciated by the average fan. It is only the coaches, players and avid football fans who truly realize the value of a dependable offensive tackle like Jay Underwood. 
The Newport News, Va., resident has not always felt at home on the offensive side of the field during his Notre Dame career, though. He was recruited primarily as a defensive tackle, where he earned all-state honors at Den­bigh High School. 
The fifth-year senior was a member of Irish head coach Gerry Faust's first recruiting class. Underwood already was interested in attending Notre Dame prior Faust's arrival in South Bend, and the recruiting visit of ,faust to Virginia made the 6-5, 268-pound tackle's decision to sign with the Irish even easier. 
"Coach Faust made the difference," said Underwood. "He made a very good impression on my parents and I. We just really liked him." 
In his freshman and sophomore years, Underwood worked at defensive tackle and saw very little playing time. The Sorin Hall resident played under two different defensive coaches those first two years and was disappointed and confused about his lackoftime on the field. An attempt also was made to switch him to offensive tackle at that time, but the change did not last very long and Underwood soon found himselfback on defense. 
"We had two coachesin two years and I guess they thought I was not disciplined enough and did not play hard enough," explained Underwood. "The coaches wanted to move me to offense, but my heart really wasn't in it so I was switched back." 
In the 1983 season opener against Purdue in his junior year, Underwood, playing defensive tackle, tore cartilage in his knee.. After having successful arthroscopic knee sur­gery, he was almost completely recovered in just a few weeks. Faced with an uncertain future at defensive tackle, Underwood once more considered the switch to offense. After talking with the coaches, they decided to move him to offensive tackle and redshirt him for the 1983 seaon so he would be able to learn the new position slowly. 
"I decided it would be best to sit out; something had to change," said Underwood. "The coaches felt it would be good because it would give me two years to learn the posi­tion. I believe the coaches really wanted to move me to offense all along." 
Working primarily as a backup for Tom Doerger and Ron Plantz at quick tackle, the inexperienced Underwood ap­peared in every game for the Irish last season. While pleased with his initial season on offense, Underwood believed there was room for improvement. 
"Last year I was still learning, so I was afraid ofmessing up," he said. "I was very apprehensive because I was just pleased to be playing." 
This year a more aggressive Underwood has been starting at quick tackle and is one of the main ingredients of the Irish offense. Underwood believes he is not playing well if the team is not winning, so, consequently, is not real happy with his performance. 
"Now I'm very critical of myself because I have the ex­perience and know the position. I have letdowns like everyone else and I won't be happy with my play until we are winning," said Underwood. 
The entire offensive unit has come under attack for not scoring this year, and the line specifically often has been criticized. Many critics cannot understand why the big Irish line is not able to handle smaller opponents. Under­wood thinks the best cure for the line would be to play to its own strengths and not be concerned about the other team. 
"The problem with the line is that we are better suited for straight ahead football," said Underwood. "We should not worry about stunts and tricks and what the defense is doing. We are big and strong enough that they should worry about us." 
Underwood does not like to lose and the disappointment ofthe team not playing to its potential in the last five years has not been easy for the talented senior to take. 
"When I wasn't playing, it was real hard to watch us lose, wondering ifI was out there, maybe it would have made a difference," he said. "Now when I play hard and then walk offthe field, knowing we lost, it's very hard and disappoint­ing." 
The hard working senior came to Notre Dame for more than just football, though. As president of his high school National Honor Society, Underwood realized the value of academics and the importance ofa balance between sports and classwork. 
"You have to organize your time and set priorities," he said. "Football players are not the only ones who need to max­imize their time, even though they are the ones who get all the attention. A lot of people on this campus are involved inoutside activities. A balance betweenschooland football takes a lot of effort and self-discipline, but it certainly is attainable." 
An American Studies major, Underwood would like to con­tinue his football career, but sees football as a day-to-day thing and is prepared to enter the business world. He hopes to get a job in public relations, communications or sales when his football days are over. r 
His football career is far from over here at Notre Dame, though. With sevengames left for the Irish, Underwood has plenty ofwork remaining on the football field as he tries to help get the Notre Damefootball team backon the winning path.

According to Vanessa Waters of the South Bend Marriott hotel, that hotel does especially strong business on football weekends. 
"We start selling rooms for the next year's fomball games immediately after one season ends," said Waters. "We require the parties to stay two nights, and to sign a contract and send a deposit when making a reservation. Ot­herwise, people would be able to cancel too easily. Even with all these restrictions, we still sell out very early in the year ofthe games." 
The Marriott encounters no trouble in the res­taurant end of its business either. 
"On a football weekend, the restaurant and lounge arc just packed, especially on Friday and Saturday," said Waters. "We don't accept reservations for the restaurants on these days. We don't need to. 
"We don't really do anything special to draw people ln. I mean, we sometimes give out free beer mugs, but we don't do anything really big." 
On game day, the huge crowd flocking to Notre Dame Stadium creates both an excep­tional market for Notre Dame businesses and a traffic problem for the South Bend police. 
The Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore is always a very busy place prior to game time. The promise ofaselection ofIrish souvenirs drives many visitors to this location.

healthy, Larkin has demonstrated his fine skills and compiled some excellent statistics. 
The I9H4 season saw Larkin make 39 tackles In only five games, Including a team-leading I 1 against Navy and eight against both USC and South Carolina. In addition, he earned a game ball for his play in the LSU game, one in which he made six tackles and an important Interception. 
after spending most of his career on the inside. He played two games before the ankle Injury, despite the many changes the new position re­quired. 
"The switch to the outside was dif­ficult because I hadn't played there since sophomore year in high . school," Larkin says. "Outside linebacker has more responsibility and isn't as easy as the Inside." 
"At the outside, I have to take on the blocker with no head start. The inside linebacker is designed to have more freedom, while the outside helps make the wall to help the Inside." 
Irish outside linebacker coach Bis­hop Harris has become Larkin's new instructor, and describes the reasons for the switch. 
"We moved him outside because of his big play capability," Harris ex­plains. "Playing outside lets him take advantag~ of his determination, speed and quickness. 
"The Injuries are very unfortunate because he hasn't been on the field enough. But when he has played, he has played extremely well." 
ness the bookstore does on a home football 
weekend, however. 
Many Irish clubs and organizations also benefit from game day. For example, the ND/SMC student club of St. Louis made al­most S300 from a concession stand at one home game last year. Although not all stands are as profitable, a home football game definitely provides a chance to earn money that otherwise would not exist. 
A home game does nothing but place extra strain on the South Bend pollee, though. Ueuterutnt Pinkert of the police force is one that deals with the traffic situation on game days. 
"All the pollee officers that work the football 
games are off-duty," said Pinkert, "because we 
obviously can't take policemen offthe street. 
"For the upcoming Army game, we'll be using 6'5 sworn police officers to help with the traf­fic. In addition to this, there will be ap­proximately two dozen state troopers and a dozen county troopers. In all, roughly 100 of­ficers are used on a game day. 
"The officers are stationed on intersections across South Bend," continued Pinkert. "We use a lot of one-way systems on game days, with a lot ofsigns and extra directions. So we obviously need many more officers to control these systems. 
"We also need to beef up the area around· Notre Dame because ofall the extra activities on game days," he added. 
While the South Bend police force may frown because of its increased responsibilities, the rest of the city and the campus only can smile whenever a home Notre Dame football game rolls around. 
I guess they are just occupational hazards and part ofthe job." 
In spite of all his setbacks, Larkin looks back positively on his years at Notre Dame. 
"I don't regret coming here at all because this place stands for righteousness, first class and honesty," Larkin says. "I've become life-long friends with hundreds of people, which I couldn't have done at other places. The people here are unbelievable, and all the players are like family."

Gipper's words inspire Irish over Army 

Time Capsule

I

when the team is up against it, when things are wrong and the 
breaks are heating the boys t tell them togo in there withall they've

Rock. But I'll know about it, andI'll be happy. 
-George Gipp Notre Dame star player On his deathbed In 1920 
George Gipp had died eight years earlier, but his final words to Notre Dame head coach Knute Rockne came back with a thunderous echo in 1928. An Inspired Irish football squad roared out of the tunnel at New York's Yankee Stadium and stunned a powerful Army team, 12-6. 
Although the "facts" surrounding Rockne's famous pep talk are less than certain, there is no hint of fiction concerning the game itself. Entering the battle, Notre Dame stood at 4-2 on the season with three straight national powers looming on the schedule. Besides Army there was Carnegie Tech and USC, both ofwhich later would defeat the Irish. 
Rockne wanted badly to avoid a losing season but was not sure his team could handle the potent Cadet attack. That is when the Irish coach, who posted a 105-12-5 record in his 13 seasons at the helm, decided to think up, er, repeat the immortal words ofthe Gipper in a solemn pre-game ceremony. 
Whatever the coach said worked because Notre Dame swarmed all over Army in the first half, keeping the Cadets off the scoreboard. With the score still 0-0 at halftime, both tired squads straggledoffthe field to the ovation ofthe 87,000 fans in attendance. 
That crowd must have thought Rockne went into the wrong locker­room at the Intermission, for when play resumed it was Army which was able to crank up Its offense. The Cadets moved the ball 72 yards for a touchdown behind the superb rushing of all-American "Red"

Cagle. Aiding the drive was a 40-yard passing strike from Cagle to teammate Ed Messinger which moved the ball to the Notre Dame 14-yard line. Army missed the extra point, however, and led 6-0. 
Surprisingly, the Irish quickly rallied as backs Fred Collins and Jack Chc:vlgny bulled their way forward slowly but surely through the wall ofWest Point. It took Notre Dame four plays from the one-yard line, but Chevigny finally got over on a plunge. The conversion at­tempt was no good, though, and the contest was deadlocked again. 
Late in the final quarter the pumped-up defense of the Irish got the ball back at its own 47-yard line. Chevigny and teammate Johnny Nlemeic carried the ball deep Into Army territory, before Chevlgny was injured going for a loose ball that lost 15 yards for Notre Dame and dropped the Irish back to the Army 35-yard line:. 
At this point Rockne made several notable substitutions for his fatigued troops, but none as spectacular as his insertion of a tall, skinny substitute end by the name ofJack "One Play" O'Brien. 
O'Brien got his nickname from, you guessed It, the next play, as he snared a long bomb from Niemeic and dragged a platoon ofCadets Into the end zone. O'Brien then returned to the tKnch for the remainder ofhis career. 
The astonished crowd thought it had seen everything when Notre Dame went up 12-6 after the score. But when Army's Cagle took the ensuing kickoff 55 yards to the Irish 35-yard line, it sensed an even greater thrill to come. 
It was the kind of thrill Rockne could live without, as Cagle ran an end around to the 1 0-yard line. Cagle had to leave the game after this play from exhaustion. Still, the Cadets' furious rally continued with a first down at Notre Dame's four-yard line. 
The call went to Army's Dick Hutchinson, the man who had replaced Cagle in the lineup, but he threw himselfright into the middle ofthe Irish defense and couldsquirm only to two feet from the goal line. As Army frantically scrambled into position for another snap, time ran out. 
Many people doubted that Glpp actually had stated those famous words of Inspiration on his deathbed. But then again, many had doubted that Notre Dame could beat Army.

By MARlY BURNS 
Sports Writer 

Sir Isaac Newton will not be in the stands Saturday when the Irish line up against Army. But it doesn't matter because it doesn't take a genius to figure out what happens when two masses moving in opposite directions at high velocities collide. 
That's the situation the 1-3 Irish find them­selves in this weekend as they attempt to halt the downward spiral which has seen them off to thcir worse start since 1963. Army, meanwhile, stands 5-0, ranked 19th in the latest AP poll, and is comingoff a 45-14 thrash­ing ofBoston College which silenced even the most vocal skeptics. 
The impact should be devastating. Either the Irish will ambush the Cadets and pull off the big upset or they will be humiliated by one of the most potent offenses in college football. 
In fact, Notre Dame head coach Gerry Faust probably is wondering ifit takes a genius like Newton to figure out how to stop the option offense which has befuddled his Irish over the pastfew seasons. He'll need aU the help he can get Saturday, for though the Irish defense showed signs of being able to contain Air Force's wishbone attack two weeks ago, Army runs a devastating version of its own. Cur­rently the Black Knights have racked up 393.6 yards per game (tops in the NCAA), and 42.6 points per contest (second in the NCAA). 
"It's going to be an exciting football game," says Faust. "(Army) is undefeated and ranked in the top 20, and our kids seem to play better when we face good competition. We had the off-week last week and we've worked very hard." 
This battle, at least for a number ofyears, will close the war which commenced in 1913 bet­ween Notre Dame and Army. The series stands at 33-8-4 in &vor ofthe Irish. 
Army's offense vs. Notre Dame's defense 
Army head coach Jim Young is the master­mind behind the Black Knights' wishbone at­tack.. Yes, this is the same Jim Young who coached Air Purdue a few years back, giving observers then the notion that the only wishbone the coach had ever heard ofwas the kind that came from a turkey. Still, despite the in&ntry's affinity for ground war&re, Young will call a pass nowand thenfor old memories. 
The man lobbing passes for Army most 
Each week, the Observer sports staff, a ~andom student picked by the sports editor and some well­known figure in the Notre Dame community predict the outcome of the week's major college football games. Records are compiled as to how each person does against the spread. In other words, it isn't enough to pick the winner of a given game. The person must pick the winner and give the underdog points. Home team is in CAPS.

likely will be senior quarterback Rob Healy (18-of-29 on the season). Healy missed the Boston College game with a minor injury but is expected to play against the Irish. The6-2, 184-pounder's biggest assets are his discipline and running ability. He has rushed 57 times for 261 yards and three touchdowns, and has thrown only one interception. Quick sop­homore substitute Tory Crawford handled himselfwell as a fill-in last week and may see action as well. 
The West Point backfield will consistofsenior fullback Doug Black ( 12th in NCAA rushing at 108 yards per game) and junior haltbacks Wil­liam Lampley and Clarence Jones. The 6-1, 200-pound Jones rushed for three touch­downs against BC in leading the versatile Cadet running game to 505 yards for the day on only 79 carries. 
The Notre Dame defense will have a tough task before it. This time the Irish will not be able t0 rely on drive-killing turnovers as they did last week when Air Force botched several key drives with fumbles. Army has turned the ball over only six times in five games, giving it the second best turnover rate ( 18 gained, 6 lost) in the NCAA. 
"West Point played 
Oawless football," 
said Faust in 
reference to last 

week's Army win over the Eagles. "They run the wishbone ex­tremely well and the impressive thing is that they don't fumble much. They're putting points on the board and they're playing with confidence. But I think we did a pretty good job against the wishbone ofAir Force." 
It will be even tougher for the Irish defensive line now that junior tackle Wally Kleine is out for four to six weeks with a knee injury. Army's offensive line lost two starting tackles to graduation but seemingly has been able to fill the holes well. The job ofgetting into the backfield to pressure the quarterback will go to nose tackle Mike Kiernan and tackles Greg Dingens and Eric Dorsey. Inexperienced sop­homores Matt Dingens and BOb Martz will be tested on the line when they enter the game as reserves. 
The Notre Dame defense, which allowed 400 yards in each of its last two losses, will be spearheaded by senior linebacker Tony Fur­janie (a team-leading 50 tackles) and will be helped by the return of outside linebacker Mike Larkin, who missed the last two games with a sprained ankle. Consistent tackler Mikt; Kovaleski may miss the game, however, with a 
tom thigh muscle.  
Perhaps potent weapon,  the most Army though, is  

senior placekicker Craig Stopa. Stopa holds several West Point kicking records and started· out the season by going six-of-seven on field goals and 18-of-18 on the point-after conver­sion.

When talking about placekickers, though, there are few better than Notre Dame's John Carney. If Carney's leg can hold up through all the practice it's been getting lately when the offense &ils to get into the end 
zone, it 11hould be ready to kick the big one should the occasion arise. 
The consistent failure to reach paydirt has been the single biggest problem confronting Notre Dame's offense this season. It has failed to get across the goal line 14 times after reach­ing the opponent's 30-yard line. 
"We have to do a better job ofcapitalizing on our opportunities offensively," noted Faust. "We're moving the ball, butwe're just not put­ting points on the board. When you get down

in that area you see a lot ofblitzes and a lot of other things from the defense you have to be ready for. Execution is the key. We scrimmaged three straight days there last week to try to get things worked out." 
Irish tailback Allen Pinkett will have extra in­centive in that he needs only 50 yards rushing to pass Vagas Ferguson's 3,472-yard total and become the leading runner in Notre Dame history. The 5-9, 191-pound senior has pounded out a tough 392 yards on 99 carries so far this season. 
Quarterback Steve Beuerlein has had a great deal ofdifficulty getting rollingso far this year.

-Gerry Faust  

coaches are hoping that he can exploit thts facet by hitting his talented corps ofreceivers, which should include super split end Tim Brown who comes back from a sprained ankle. 
As is often the case, however, the war in the trenches will be the determining factor. The aU-senior offensive line of the Irish will be up against a smaller but equally experienced five­man front of Army. The Black Knights are sixth in the NCAA in scoring defense ( 11.0 points per game) and allow a paltry 1 0 1 yards per contest on the ground. The Irish line has been beset with inopportune penalties all year, helping the offense to only an average of 127 yards rushingper game. The unit was able to improve on that mark against Air Force in the last game ( 197 yards) but will have to maintain that increase for any success against 
Army.

I 
t would seem at first that Tivoli's Lounge 
has all the makings ofa marvelously chic 
night club. Fancy lights, giant video screens 
and a high-tech dance floor all create a 
fast-paced atmosphere that is arguably the 
most stylish in South Bend. 

Clean andspacious, the lounge area 
consists ofseveral adjoining rooms that 
together seat up to 550 people. Plush booths, 
candlelit tables, exotic plants and decorative 
water fountains give the club its aura of 
elegance. 

You are, however, reminded ofthis 
elegance every time you walk through the 
door. Tivoli's has a $2 cover charge on Thursday through Saturday nights, as well as a Casual but neat dress code (collared shirts required; no faded or ripped jeans). Once inside, you'll find that purchasing drinks is no pauper's affair, either. A small draft beer will cost you S1.25, while mixed drinks go for S2.50. 
On constant duty is a V.j. -that's right, a video jockey -who plays from a selection of over 250 videos and 1200 records. Projected simultaneously onto numerous big-screens and television monitors througout the club, the videos animate the place and colorfully complement the dancing scene. 
The dance floor itself is quite unlike any other in the South Bend area. Its com­puterized special effects are synchronized with the pulsating rhythm ofthe music in an obvious attempt to bombard the senses. The stero strobe lights, prism lights, chase lights, smoke and bubbles are nice, but a bit overdone. What ever happened to the good old days when you paid attention to your dance partner?

OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK AT 7 P.M. 
Early in the week, Tivoli's entertains only  
small crowds, but Thursday through Satur­ 
day, the place is usually jammed. The  
majority ofthe patrons are local residents in  
the 21-30 age group, but many Notre Dame  
and Saint Mary's students can be identified by  
their Polo shirts and Guess? jeans.  
Tivoli's modern decor is pleasantly unique;  
its high-tech innovations are nothing short of  
fascinating. :'\nt, after the initial awe fades  
from your eyes, you just may find this club a  
bit too flashy and really quite impersonal.  
It's all too easy to get lost in the crowd ­to  
become isolated by the loud music, flashing  
lights and strange faces. A 10-minute observa­ 
tion ofthe clientele's behavior will tell you  
that this night club has strong "meat market"  
tendencies. In short, Tivoli's suffers from a  
"too-much-of-a-good-thing" syndrome.

Nevertheless, in the huddle Collins remained cool, confident and relaxed, despite the frustration ofthe early setbacks. At one point during the second quarter, he calmly announced, "Gentlemen, our losing streak ends today." 
The Irish moved the ball successfully during the second quarter. Although they failed to score, they did manage a series of impressive first downs. The Spartans' only scoring threat was foiled when the Irish free safety, Shenandoah Lee, leaped into the air to swat down a pass destined for the end zone.

Each afternoon, Father Rock drove the three young men to a secluded high school practice field in South Bend, where they rehearsed passing plays until sundown. Rockne told Gipp theses­sions reminded him ofthe summer he and Gus Dorais had spent at Cedar Point perfect­ing the forward pass that had jolted a presumably Invincible 1913 Anny team and put little-known Notre Dame on the map. 
The secrecy was maintained on Friday, when Father Rock and his charges made the trip to East Lansing by car Instead of taking the team plane. 
The Notre Dame · Michigan State rivalry had been a fierce one characterized by hard 
"How far?" 

The second halfstarted miserably for the Irish. The Spartans returned the kickoff for a touchdown. To add insult to injury, they decided to go for two. 
Michigan State 14 · Notre Dame 0. 

Shenandoah Lee fielded the ensuing kickoff for the Irish, and fought his way to the Notre Dame 28. The Notre Dame offense took the field. 
Few of the sportswriters seemed aware that a new hal1back had entered the game for the Irish. John Thornton of the Chicago Tribune observed the new player didn't even have a name sewn on his jersey. He assumed "Mr. Nice Guy" Kelly was probably giving a local boy some playing time in front ofhis 
friends and family. He returned his attention 
hitting and close scores. The closest ofall had to WGN-TV's broadcast ofthe Chic~go Cubs 
been the famous 10-1o tie in 1966. Ara 
Pareseghian's Irish and Dutly Daugherty's Spartans had both been undefeated and ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, in the polls. The tie had cost Michigan State a second straight national championship, which Notre Dame claimed outright in its season finale by overwhelming USC ~ 1-0. 
In recent years, the Spartans had dominated the series. At the outset ofthe game, the trend seemed certain to continue. 
The Irish backfield committed two mortal sins in the first quarter, fumbling the ball twice deep In Notre Dame territory. The Spartans seized both opportunities. Two field goals established a six-point advantage. 
Notre Dame's receivers noticed the baseball game, which he had tuned m on his battery-powered Sony Watchman. 

Collins introduced the new hal1back to the Irish offense. "This is Dutch Reagan. He promised my mother he'd look after me. She's been concerned about my health since those five sacks you gentlemen permitted last week." 
At the line ofscrimmage, Collins called his own number. He followed Reagan through the line for a six-yard gain. There was an official timeout while the Spartan trainers assisted Michigan State's giant middle linebacker, Bubba Angstrom, from the field. 
"Good blocking, Dutch!" 

Reagan was next. He smashed through the center ofthe line for a first down. 
Three more plays. Three more clouds of dust. Another first down. 
Three more plays, including a quick one over the middle to Ryan O'Connor, left the Irish with a fourth and two. Reagan punted for the corner. His kick was downed on the Spartans' two-yard line. 
Unimpressed, the Spartans bullied their way to the 23, but an inspired Notre Dame defense forced them to surrender the ball. The punt was high, but short. Lee signaled for a fair catch. The Notre Dame offense returned with excellent field position. 
II 

On the first play ofthe series, Reagan spr.:inted out ofthe backfield. Collins dropped back. Reagan threw a brush block, then drifted toward the sideline. O'Connor raced down the near side. 
Green Spartan jerseys converged on Collins. At the last second, he flipped the ball to Reagan, who launched a missile to the end zone. 
O'Connor left the ground at the goal line. The ball had been slightly overthrown ... two inches, at most. He stretched his arms and clutched the ball. He somersaulted through the end zone, yet somehow retained control ofthe football. 
As if in blessing, the referee raised his arms. 
Michigan State 14 -Notre Dame 6. 
Reagan took a handofffrom Collins and went airborne for the two-point C<?nversion. Michigan Staie 14 -Notre Dame 8. The Spartans wisely chose to keep the ball 
on the ground after that, grinding out 
yardage and erasing minutes from the clock. 
The blowout they had anticipated had failed 
to materialize, but they still had the lead and 
had every intention ofprotecting it. 
But the Fighting Irish were equally 
aroused. O'Connor's touchdown had in­
spired the defense. They bent but didn't 
break under repeated Spartan attacks. 
The teams traded possessions until mid­
way through the fourth quarter. Collins 
turned a broken play into a 40-yard gain. The 
drive stalled at the Spartan 1 5, so Coach Kelly 
called on freshman placekicker Tom Roberts. 
Roberts' field goal attempt split the uprights. 
Michigan State 14 -Notre Dame 11. 
On the sideline, Kelly turned to Father 
Rock. 

"What do you think, Father? Think we have 
a chance to win?" 
"I don't know,Joe. Spartans have hated 
losing ever since that incident at Ther­
mopylae. For your sake, I hope so. One loss is 
good for the soul. Too many losses are not 
good for the coach." 
Late in the fourth quarter, disaster struck. 
A blitzing linebacker forced Collins to 
fumble. Michigan State recovered, and the 
Spartans ripped off two long gainers. 
With the sudden c~ in momentum, 
the Spartan quarterback, King Leonidas, got 
cocky. he sensed the Irish had returned to 
normal. His favorite receiver had beaten his 
coverage by a mile on the last play. 
As he moved up to take the snap from center, he failed to notice that the Irish had made a substitution on defense. 
Leonidas hurled the ball deep as visions of touchdowns and an NFL rookie contract danced in his head. 
Dutch Reagan, now playing defense, matched his target step for step. He spun and intercepted the ball. He made it back to the 
.Notre Dame 47 before five Spartans wrestled him to the ground. 
On the sideline, Rockne wasn't at all surprised. One ofthe relllaJ'k2ble thinw; about Gipp during his earlier days was that he had never allowed a pass completion n his territory. Never. 
There was time for one more play. The Irish set up for a field goal attempt. 
In the press box, the sportswriters were astonished. Thornton stifled a laugh. He could see that Colllns was the holder, and that the "nameless wonder" was filling in for Roberts, the kicker. 
"It's a trick play. Collins will throw it as far as he can and pray a Hall Mary," he said to no one in particular.

Alleged baby murderer won't see test results 
PROVIDENCE, Rl. · Donna Ric­
hard, charged with killing her infant 
daughter, sbould not be given 
results ofpolygraph and truth-serum 
tests her husband took during the 
murder investigation, his attorney 
said Thursday. 

The argument at a pre-trial hearing was the first public disagree­ment between the couple since theirJuly indictment. Ralph Richard Is charged with raping his 4-month­old daughter, Jerri Ann. 
Superior Court Judge Joseph Rodgers Jr. deferred ruling on attor­ney George Muksian's request for the test results and ordered both defense attorneys and the state's prosecutor to file briefs on whether the results are protected under state confidentiality laws. 
"I don't think Mr. Muksian and his client have a right to them," said John O'Connor, Mr. Richard's lawyer. Muksian and O'Connor declined to discuss the dispute after the proceeding. 
The Richards, as they have for their last several court appearances, arrived at and left the Providence County Courthouse separately. They spoke briefly in court and sat separated by their attorneys. 
The couple reported Jerri Ann snatched from her crib Nov. II. The infant's bludgeoned and raped body was discovered four days later in an alley near the Richards' Pawtucket apartment following televised pleas by the couple for their daughter's return. 
Mrs. Richard, 33, was charged with first-degree murder in May after police received an arrest war-

rant based largely on statements by 
Richard incriminating his wife. 
The couple had been represented 
by Muksian during the investigation, 
but Richard, 34, hired O'Connor 
after.)lis wife was charged. At that 
time, O'Connor said: "They are 
potential adversaries in the case." 
Mr. Richard was not charged until 
the couple was indicted inJuly. Both 
also face charges of obstruction of 
justice, conspiracy and filing false 
police reports. 
The judge, who said he hoped the couple's trial could begin inJanuary, scheduled another pre-trial hearing for Nov. 18. 
Rodgers ordered the state to provide both defense attorneys with a more detailed account ofpotential trial testimony and evidence, includ· ing copies of any taped statements by the couple. The judge said the state's response to routine defense discovery motions was too vague. 
The judge said defense attorneys can question the grand jurors, in­cluding one man who was dlsnlissed from the panel before the vote to in­dict. The attorneys said they need to interview the grand jurors before deciding whether to move to have the indictment dlsnlissed. 
Rodgers denied the attorneys' re­quest for a transcript of the instruc­tions prosecutors gave the _grand jury. 
The judge ordered the defense at­torneys to provide the state with lists of potential witnesses and evidence they may use. Both Muk­sian and O'Connor objected, saying they had not viewed all the state's evidence and, therefore, had not yet prepared their cases.

Surprising Wolverines. take on Iowa Saturday 
IOWA CITY, Iowa . That 8o Schembechler is one crafty fellow. 
AU the preseason talk about the Big Ten Conference football race centered on Ohio State, Iowa and n: linois. Schembechler's Michigan team, which slumped to 6-6 last season, was relegated to no better than fourth. 
But Schembechler knew better. And now, so does the rest of the country. The Wolverines are 5-0, ranked second nationally and appear to be one victory away from becom­ing the No. I team. 
Schembechler sends his team against top-ranked Iowa at Iowa's Kinnick Stadium on Saturday in only the 19th matchup between the Nos.

1 and 2 teams since the Associated 
Press poll surted in 1936. 
"We're excited about tne position 
we're in, but we're not quite as 
surprised as other people," said 
Schembechler, whose team Is a 2 
1/2-point favorite In Saturday's Big 
Ten Conference game. 
"I don't think the experts figured we would be In this position nor do I think that any of the coaches In the Big Ten thought we would. In my opinion, they miscalculated. 
"I said going Into the season that I thought we'd be a better team than we were a year ago," he added, "and I think we proved that." 
Indeed they have. The Wolverines own victories over Notre Dame, Maryland and South Carolina -all were In the top 20 when those games were played -and they have given up only one touchdown all season. 
Michigan's latest victory was a 31­
0 thumping of Big Ten foe Michigan 
State, a team that Iowa had to come 
from behind to beat 3 5-31 the week 
before. 
Quarterback Jim Harbaugh has made a big di1ference In the Wol­verines. Harbaugh, a 6-foot-3, 200­pound senior, broke his arm In the fifth game of J984 and was out ofac­tion when Iowa whipped Michigan 26-0 two weeks lat~r. 
Harbaugh doesn't get much atten­tion In a league that has quarter­backs like Iowa's Chuck Long, Illinois' jack Trudeau and Purdue's jim Everett, but he has been ef­fective nonetheless In completing 63 of 104 passes for 727 yards and seven touchdowns. 
"Our offense has been good from 
the standpoint ofcontrollingthe ball 
and keeping the dedense off the 
field," Schembechler said. "Last 
year, our offense could not move the 
ball and the defense was on the field 
all afternoon." 
Michigan has stopped Its op­ponents In their tracks this year. The Wolverines are the stingiest team In the country, giving up only 4.2 points a game, and they're fourth na­tionally in yards allowed at 220 per game. 
"It will be the best overall total defense that we've seen -the best one we've seen since we've been In the Big Ten," Iowa Coach Hayden Fry said. "They have It all. They have tremendous speed, they've got tremendous quickness. 
"We'll really be fighting the quick­ness and the toughness and the ag­gressiveness all rolled Into one." 
Iowa will attack the Michigan defense with the nation's highest scoring offense. The Hawkeyes, also 5-0, are averaging 44.2 points and 470 total yards a game.

there is, in fact, some workable solu· tion to this problem. 
The speakers for this event will in· dude Cincinnati attorney Reuben Katz, Chicago agent Jack Childer, South Bend attorney Charles Swe~ney, and Roger Valdiserri, as­sociate athletic director at Notre Dame. 
According to Cleveland, the representation of athletes has become a growing problem in the realm of today's athletics, and the problem exists in the methods which the agents use to establish contracts with players.

Rockne Division. A 35-yard pass 
from Mike Kurowski to Rob Weis 
midway through the second quarter 
provided the only scoring. 
"We played sloppy, but we won," 
remarked Screaming Otter Captain 
K.J. Phelan. "It was not as good as we are capable ofplaying, but we hadn't practiced much during the week." 
3·1 Howard will also enter the 
playoffs from the Rockne Division 
after topping Carroll, 6-0, in a hard­
fought Thursday night game. Pat 
Clark's 3-yard touchdown provided 
the difference, as Carroll dropped to 
2-2. 
Howard Captain Jim Chmiel said 
after the game that he felt that super· 
ior line play won the game. 
"Carroll played outstanding," said 
Bunek 
continuedfrom page 24 
Buton top ofthose standard reasons, Bunek wanted to help build a program rather than go to an es­tablished power like Southern Cal. 
Notre Dame, in addition to providing a close proximity to Mil· waukee and a top-notch academic program, could boast of an up-and­coming women's basketball program. The Irish went 13·1 in North Star Conference play last season, 20-8 overall, en route to their first-ever NSC tide. 
Besides defending their position at the top of the North Star, this season the Irish will be attempting to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time, a goal they narrowly missedlast year. The NSC pre-season coaches poll predicts overwhelm· ingly that Notre Dame will repeat in '85·'86, so don't be surprised if the women's team does better than the men's squad this season. 

"One is aware of some of the NCAA violations that a lot of the agents have:' made on campuses," said Cleveland. "They have come on campuses, signed some athletes, and interupted their class standing which is in violation of the NCAA rules and regulations. 
"We will be discussing how to remain competitive without violat· ing the NCAA rules and regulations." 
Of the guests on the panel, Val· diserri is likely to take the stand that sports agents are ruining the sport and the athlete and that they must be thwarted. "He may have some gutsy things to say about agents and attor· 
neys  who  serve  as  agents,"  said  
Cleveland.  
Meanwhile,  Katz,  Childer,  and  

Sweeney are likely to defend their 
Chmiel, "but our offensive line owned the line of scrimmage. I thought we won the line of scrimmage both ways." 
Howard's first-round playoff op· ponent Alumni avenged last season's loss to Zahm, a defeat which prevented Alumni from reaching the playoffs, by blanking the IW>id Bats 8-0 on Thursday in an emotional contest. 
"It was intense," said Dog defensive tackle Matt ·Roy. "Everybody really wanted to win. We were talking a lot last week about how they had beaten us last year." 
Vince Holzhall sacked Zahm quar­terback Mark Palaski in the e,ndzone for a safety for Alumni's first score. Tim Smith later rambled I 7 yards for a touchdoWJn to give the Dogs their 8-0 advantage. Alumni improved to 3·1, while Zahm dropped to 1·3.

Qwn r:oles as agents. Katz represents Pete Rose primarily as an attorney and secondly as an agent. Sweeney, in a similar respect, serves as an at­torney and has represented many Notre Dame athletes upon their graduation. 
Childer has represented Ernie Banks, Phil Esposito, Franco Harris, and Kareem Abdul-Jabaar. By not pursuing any type of education in this field, Childer would lead one to believe that "anybody could be an agent," according to Cleveland. Education will also be presented as a problem in regards to the actual qualifications ofthese agents. 
Childer, however, has probably done the most extensive work in this field. Following national atten­tion placed on the problem ofagents 
''It was the best game we played this season," said Alumni captain Paul Laughlin. "We had the attitude that we had to win to go to the playoffs." 
Stanford, meanwhile, tied Alumni for first place in the Leahy Division at 3·1 by conquering Cavanaugh, 7· 
0. Cavanaugh, though fresh off Sun­day's upset ofHoly Cross, fell behind when AI Martin completed a 30-yard touchdown pass to Brent Basham in the second quarter,.and could not recover. The Cavemen finished the season at 1·3. 
"We played pretty well," said Stanford Captain Bill Jolley, "but we're going to have to play better if we're going to repeat (as cham­pions)." 
In a game that had no bearing on the playoffs, Keenan improved to 2· 3 with a 9·6 Wednesday night vic­tory over 0-5 Off-Campus.

by Sports IUustrated and newspapers from coast to coast, Sweeney devised a four-point program which he believes could solve this problem. He has not received any responses from the NCAA or the other major college programs which received a copy of his proposal. 
"Jack Childers has a problem­solving situation," explained Cleveland. "He has given it to the president of the NCAA. But he has not heard from the NCAA. As a mat· ter of fact, he has sent his solution around the country, and as of last week, his only response was from me, an assistant law librarian." 
Childer's plan involves keeping the student-athlete aware of his current situation throughout his four years. As the athlete approaches his junior and senior years, he will be introduced to a plan devised by his school to aid him in the selection ofa representative, ifhe should need one. Meanwhile, the school will evaluate a pool of agents through a series of recommendations and past histories. Those approved by the school will be allowed to meet with students before garduation in a con­trolled setting. 
"This is a major problem for every school that has an athlete with the potential·to become a professional," said Childer in a Sept. 3 letter to sent to the NCAA and the major con· ferences across the nation. "Left un­checked, these violations will be the next major scandal for college ath· letics. 
"The first objective must be for colleges to understand that agents provide a needed and desirable service," continued Childer. "Good experienced agents want to help and contribute to the · college programnot to violate NCAA rules." 
What will become of the present situation remains to be seen. On Oct. 26, however, four extremely in­volved people will discuss the situa· tion and seek an equitable solution.

Game 1 will be Saturday night in · Kansas City, where the surprising Royals will play host to the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Both teams enter the Show-Me Showdown on hot streaks. 
Kansas City, which looked pitiful In fillllng behind Toronto 3-1 in the American League playoffil, did a complete turnaround in rallying to win the last three games to take the best-of-7 series. 
St. Louis lost the first two games of the National League playoffil, but then came back to win four straight against Los Angeles. 
1bc Royals caught the Blue Jays with their pitching, often a deter­mining factor in postseason play. Kansas City used five different starters, and used some of them in reliefroles. 
1bc Cardinals will continue to rely on its big three ofJohn Tudor, Joaquin Andujar and Danny Cox, plus its highly successful "bullpen· by-committee." 
St. Louis has a much more potent 
lineup than Kansas City. 
1bc Cardinals have more speed and better hitters throughout their order. The Royals hit more home runs, but St. Louis does not count on power. 
Also hurting Kansas Cityis the loss 
ofits designated hitter in.the Series, 
which happens during the odd 
years. 
A position-by-position look at the 
two teams: 
Pint Base · The Cardinals traded 
for Jack Clark in the off-season to !Je 
their cleanup hitter, and he filled the 
spot perfectly. He hit 22 homers, 
drove in 87 runs and batted .281. 
Clark, in his first postseason 
series, hit .381 and his three-run 
homer with two outs in the ninth in­
ning ofGame 6 sent St. Louis to the 
World Series. 
Steve Balboni of Kansas City is a classic slugger. He hits for power • a team record 36 home runs · along with low average (.243) and a lot of strikeouts ( 166). In the: playoffil, he went just 3-for-25 with seven strikeouts and had two errors. 
Royals Manager Dick Howser 
likes to bat Balboni in the: sixth spot, 
realizing his potential and his 
liability. But with McRae out, Bal­
boni may have to bat fourth. 
Big edge to St. Louis 
Second Due · Tommy Herr had 
an incredible year for St. Louis and 
far surpassed anything be had done 
before. He hit .302 with eight 
homers and 110 RBI, and became 
the first player since George Kell in 
1950 to have 100 RBI and less than 
10 home runs. 
In the playoffil, he batted .333 and 
drove in six runs. Herr runs well and 
fields well. 
Frank White, a four-time All-Star, 
has slowed down a little at age 35 
and hit just .249. But be has com­
pensated by adding more power and 
had acareer-high 22 homers with 69 
RBI. He is still a fine fielder. 
By the statistics, Herrwould rate a 
big edge, especially since White's 
injured hand dropped him to eighth 
in the lineup and produced a 5-for­
24 performance in the playoffis. But 
White's poslSCason experience 
should help. Slight edge to Herr. 
Sbot1stop · What more can 
anyone say about Ozzie Smith? Well 
he hit a career-high .276 during the 
regular season, and capped that by 
batting .435 with several key hits in 
the playoffis. That, along with usual 
fielding ability, made him the: MVP of 
the NL playoffil. 

Kansas City's Buddy Biancalana batted only .188 during the regular r season, and his fielding is average. But, he surprised everyone with a booming, RBI double in the playoffs. Still, ... Big edge to St. Louis 
Third Base · Terry Pendleton, who had a great rookie season for St. Louis in 1984, dropped off this year. He batted only .240 . although he had 69 RBI and was 5-for-24 in the playoffs. 
George Brett will be in the Hall of Fame someday. And, he's now in the middle of one of the hottest streaks ofhis career. 
He was the MVP ofthe AL playoffs, a series that came after his hitting during the final week of the regular season enabled Kansas City to beat California. Big edge to Kansas City 
Left Field -The only thing that slowed down Vince Coleman this season was the tarpaulin in St. Louis. that put him out ofaction during the playoffs. He should be ready for the Series. 
Coleman stole 110 bases, and al­though he strikes out too much for a leadoffhitter, gets onbase enough to ruin pitchers' concentration. ' 
Lonnie Smith was traded by St. Louis to Kansas City during the season, and after the deal spentsome time bad-mouthing the AL and said he spent a lott of time following the Cardinals' progress on the scoreboard. 
Smith wou111d up hitting only .257 for the Royals, but was moved from the No. 2 slo1t to leadoff in the final week and produced. Smith was hit· less in his tiirst 12 at-bats in the playoffil, but went 7 for his last 16. Even 
CenterField · Either one ofthese 
players can give other teams the 
willies. 
Willie McGee of St. Louis led the league with a .353 average and drove in 82 runs. He is an excellent fielder and baserunner. McGee hit .269 in the playoffs. 
Willie Wi:lson of Kansas City 
remains one of the best all-around 
players in the: game. He batted .278 
during the season and continues to 
play excellent defense and run well.

The pressure was on Wilson to get on base in the playoffs, and he went 9-for-29. Slight edge to St. Louis 
Ript Field· Andy VanSlyke ofSt. Louis did an adequate job, hitting .2S9 with 13 homers and SS RBI. He was 1-for-11 in the playoffs, but is a good fielder. 
Pat Sheridan of the Royals hit only three home runs all season, but homered twice in the playoffs. He had just one other hit in his 19 playoff at-bats. Even 
Catcher . Darrell Porter did not play every day for St. Louis for most of the season, but Manager Whitey Herzog went with Porter's ex­perience in the stretch. He wound up at .221 with 10 homers and 36 RBI, and was 4-for-1 Sin the playoffs. 
Jim Sundberg will have as much 
pressure on him as any Kansas City 
player in the World Series. It will be 
up whim to help shut down the Car­
dinals' running game. 
Sundberg hit .245 during the regular season, but was a major fac­tor in the evolution of the Royals' young pitching staff. Sundberg, who had never been in the postseason, was equal to the challenge defensively and offensively. He drove in a team-high six runs in the playoffs, including four in Game 7. Slight edge to Kansas City 
Starting PltchJng · St. Louis figures to go with John Tudor, Joa­quin Andujar and Danny Cox, and possibly Bob Forsch If necessary. 
Tudor was unhittable for the last 4 l/2 months of the season, although Los Angeles pinned the loss on him in the playoffopener. He then came back to win Game 4. 
Cox pitched well in the regular season and good enough to win his one playoff start. Andujar, a 20-game winner for the second straight year, was inconsistent during the last half of the year and was hit hard in his two playoff starts. 
Kansas City has a lot of starters, and Howser uses them well · If not a bit oddly in the playoffs. 
Danny Jackson, Charlie Leibrandt and Bud Black are pretty good left­handers who will force St. Louis switch-hitters to bat from the weaker right side. Bret Saberhagen, a 20-game winner, was hurt by a liner in Game 7, but should be ready to pitch. So should Game 6 winner Mark Gubicza, if Howser chooses to start him. • Even 
RellcfPltchJng · St. Louis uses its "bullpen-by-committee," featuring Ken Dayley,Jeffl.ahti, Todd Worrell and Bill Campbell. Those guys got the job done during the season, and Dayley sparkled in the playofls with six shutout innings. 
Dan Quisenberry remains the main man in Kansas City's bullpen. He gave up two game-winning hits in his first two appearances of the playoffs, but was fine in his other two outings. He has led the league in saves for four straight years, but his postseason record is just 2-4. Even 
Bench · Cesar Cedeno and Tito Landrum are the top two hitters off the bench for St. Louis, although cit-her one could also get a chance to start. 
McRae will be the No. 1 reserve for Kansas City. The no-designated hitter situation knocks him out of the lineup because he does not have a position to play.

Sorin shut out Pangborn, 6-0, Thursday, and G1race dumped Dillon, 16-6, on Wednesday to claim the two first-round byes in the interhall football playoffs. 
Unofficially, Sorin will await the winner of the Alumni-Howard November 3 game, and Grace will :face the victor in the Stanford-Flanner contest on the s:une date. All four first-round participants clinched playoff berths with victories Wednesday or Thursday. 
Grace raised its record to 4-1 and clinched first place in the Parseghian Division by thrashing Dillon, now 2-2­
1. Captain Ed Bornemann rushed for two touchdo\'lms ­a 20-yatd romp in the first quarter and a 65-yard in­surance score late in the final period for the vic1tors. Grace's Tony jordan added a 36-yard field goal in the second. 
Grace's 16 points equalled its scoring offense in its last three games combined. Bornemann was pleased with his squad's potent offense. 
"We moved pretty much up and down the field on them," said the senior captain. "It went pretty well." 
Flanner grabbed the other Parseghian playoff berth on Wednesday with a 13-6triumph over Morrissey. The loss ended the season for 3·2 Morrissey, who just one week ago had boasted a 3-0 record and seemed assured ofa playoff spot.

ND hosts forum about sports law 
By MICHAELJ. CHMIEl. 
Sports Writer 
In the present day, athletics has become a very profitable business for all involved. Athletics has espe­cially been profitable for the athlete who is the beneficiary oflucrative contracts. 
Today's collegiate sports have become infiltrated to a great extent by profiteers who look to expose their sc;rvices to the youthful athiete and profit from his pos­sible success in the future. With this belief, there has become an increasing tendency for sports agents to ap­proach collegiate athletes and make their services available. 
The NCAA, however, has ruled against this practice. Despite the unlawfulness ofan early agreement, it con­tinues and abounds in today's service-oriented society where agents try to beat rivals to the punch by es­tablishing representative contracts early. 
With the timeliness of this subject, the Notre Dame Law School will play host to a Sports-Law Forum on Saturday, Oct. 26. The topic of this gathering will be: "Representation of an Athiete: How to get started and remain competitive." 
"Each year we put on a sports and entertainment law forum," explains Granville Cleveland, an assistant law librarian and moderator of the forum. "We try to bring up issues that are current and controversial." 
The forum, which will take place right before the Notre Dame-Southern Cal game, will involve four dif­ferent speakers who will present their views on the sub­ject in a series of introductory statements. Following the openings, a discussion will ensue to determine if
