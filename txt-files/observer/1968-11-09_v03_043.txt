The Harpo Story 
Notre Dame halfback Bob "Harpo" Gladieux (S-1 1, 185 pounds, from Louisville, Ohio) leads the team in rushing, scoring, average per punt and kickoff returns. He ranks second in pass receiving and punt returns. Not much more the guy can do. Observer sports writer Terry Shields profiles him on page 7 . 
. ... cracks a smile .... 

T.H.H. Doubtful 
Irish  quarterback  Terry  Hanratty  is  a  
doubtful  starter  for  this  afternoon's  game  
with Pittsburgh.  

Hanratty injured his left knee Wednesday in a "live" goal-line drill. He was rolling out when a member of the prep team defense hit him and held the quarterback upright. A split second later, another defender slashed into llanratty's knee. 
ND's all-time total offense leader suffered no broken hones, nor was there any cartilage damage. llowcvcr, torn ligaments arc feared. 
The knee is swollen and Hanratty has been on t·n•tches the past three days. Trainer Gene Pastkiet said no dedsion on his playing stat_us will be made until this morning. 
Meanwhile, Joe Theismann has been running the first team offense in practice since Wednesday. Coley O'Brien has been returned to quarterback as Theismann 's back-up man.

Today 's Sports Parade is written by Tommy Geddie of UP/'s Southwest Division. 
1 ARLINGTON, Tex. (UPI) -When Skipper Butler kicked four 
field goals-one of them a whopping 60 yarder-earlier this year, his 
University of Texas at Arlington mates dug out the record books to 
see if the long kick was a collegiate record. 
After all, the professional record is "only" 56 yards. 
The check showed a 6I yard kick by Bill Shear of Cortland N.Y. 
State against Hobart College in I 966, but brought to light the fact 
that Butler already held three national college division records for. 
field goals and was rapidly closing in on two more. 
Butler's current marks are for most career field goals with 27, 
most attempts with 67 and most attempts in a season with 24 last 
fall. With three games still to play this year, Butler has hit I I out of 
22 field goals and needs just one more good kick to tie the sin~lc 
season record of I 2 held by Lee Mayo of Tennessee Martin. \ 
In addition, Butler's toe has accounted for 140 Rebels Points and 
1
the national mark for kick scoring is 162 by Bill Swartz of College of Emporia in I 961-64. That record may be out of reach this fall, but Butler is only a junior. Butler's four field goals Oct. 5 in a 4 I-30 win over East Texas State University were also a Southland Conference mark. "I knew I could kick the ball tnat far-60 yards, but I didn't know if I would have the accuracy," Butler said. He claimed he knew he could do the job-mainly because he had kicked 62 yarders in practice. "I didn't try to kill the ball, although you naturally try to hit it harder and follow through with your leg a little bit more," he said. 
Butler a business major, came to UT-Arlington on a part 
scholarship from Gladewater, a town of about 5 ,900. He won 13. 
letters in football, basketball, baseball and track at Gladewater and 
was a siandout quarterback. 
Rebel coach Burley Bearden took one look at Butler's kicking 
ability when he was a freshman and decided to make him a fulltime 
kicker, and Butler has not played a down of varsity football as 
anything but a kicker. 
Butler has a 37.5 punting average, but the figure is misleading. 
Opponents have returned only six of his 26 punts this season for six 
total yards. 
His percentage of field goals might be better, but Bearden reasons 
that a long field goal attempt is worth just as much as a punt if it 
fails, and is worth three more if it is

Gladieux at His Best in the Clutch 
By TERRY SHIELDS 
Every great team has one. You know. That guy who always 
comes  through  in  a  tight  
situation,  the clutch  man  of a  
ball  club.  The  player  who  
doesn't  usually  win  the  
headlines,  but  merely  wins  

games. In Boston his name is Sam Jones, in Green Bay his name is Carroll Dale, and at Notre Dame his name is Bob "Harpo" Gladieux. 
This statement may surprise many people but 'here arc numerous instances tJaJt support it. Look back to "The G;.rne" of I966. The score is Michigan State 10, Notre Dame 0. Coley O'Brien fades back to pass but his primary receiver is covered. Then he spots No. 20 all alone near the goal line. He overshoots the mark by a fraction but his receiver makes the grab look easy. Touchdown Notre Dame. 
That was the big play of the year for it changed the momentum and started the Irish 
back  in  the  bll  game.  Not  
enough  proof>  Remember  last  
year  when  the  Irish  met  the  
Miami  Hurricanes'>  If they  lost  

then they lose their national ranking and waste a great comeback effort. 
The Irish have the ball in the

fourth quarter with a scant one-point lead. The call is an end sweep by the halfback. He gets the ball, breaks one tackle, sets up a solid block, breaks another tackle, and there goes that No. 20 across the goal line again . 
The best proof, however, lies in his statistics. These are some of his -more important stats: 967 yards gained rushing for his career (he should break I ,000 yards this afternoon), 68 career pass receptions (he need four more catches to become second only to Jim Seymour on the all-time ND list) good for an even 900 yards, and 22 career touchdowns. 
He leads the team in scoring this season with I 0 touchdowns. This figure ranks tenth in the nation at the present. He is also the team leader in rushing this year with 462 yards. Besides this he ranks first for the Irish in kickoff returns and is second in punt returns. 
Evidently someone has been watching Mr. Gladieux for he has been invited to play in the first American Bowl All Star game Jan. 4 in Tampa, Fla. He will perform for the North squad. 
After this, Bob hopes to play professional football. "It really doesn't matter what team I play for, just as long as I get a chance to play," says the stalky Irish halfback.

Gladieux has no regrets about corning to NO. "I always wanted to come here because of the · 

sgreat spirit and tradition. I know that I pla.yed for the best." When he is finished playing football he plans on a choaching career. 
His biggest thrill while at Notre Dame was not the touchdown against MSU, although "it was a thrill, but. .." Instead his greatest thrill was the comeback of the '67 season cul­minating with the "come from behind" victory over Miami.
