Pohl announces selections for SU offices 
by Gr~~ Pudhorod*y 

Newly appointed Student Union Director Bob l'uhl, yes­terday announced his selections for four major Student Union offices: Tom Olivieri, Associate Director; Rob Browning, Ser­vices Commissioner: Jim l'orst, Social Commissioner; and Ken Mannings, Executive Coordi­nator. 
Olivieri, currenlly Junior Class Vice-President, said that he will work strongly in conjunction with Pohl on various matters. He will also serve as liason to the South Bend Chamber of Com­merce and similar civic groups to coordinate functions the Stu­dent Union hopes to initiate in the upcoming year for the 
.purpose of forming closer bonds between the U niversi!y and urban communities. Among I hese tenta lively proposed pro­grams is a carnival for the children of South Bend. 
I he post of Execul ive Coordi­nator was created this year. When explaining this action Pohl argued that "one of the weak­
nesses of the Student Union in 
the past years is that it hasn't been able to work with minori­ties on campus. The Executive Coordinator will attempt to correlate these groups." 
The S U president added that the new coordinator will also be working in close conjunction with the hall presidents in order to bring about a more meaning­ful relationship between the Union and hall life. 
Mannings, who will serve in the new post, was the past

Blacks, said Reed, have been contributing to American litera­ture for as long as there has been and America. Their efforts, encompassing all genries, have been neglected, he felt. The first Black novel was written in 1854, when the novel form itself was still very young. -Reed criticized editors and critics who attempt to open Black literature to one point of view. Reed's advice to readers was, "Go to the writer." Speaking on slang and col­loquial language, Reed said that this usage might turn out to be the real American prose and poetry. He noted that President Johnson once advised the North Vietnamese to "cool it." Reed charged that literary critics treat afro-American writers like boxers instead of artists.

Such is the opinion of John Forhan, law student and co­coordinator of the South Bend Bail Project. According to Forhan, the above comment should be some­what typical of those aired at tonight's symposium on law and order. The symposium will be held at 8:00 in the Engineering Auditorium and one dollar will be charged for admission. The subject of the discussion tonight will be relatively general. However, black reaction to law enforcement will probably be discussed, as well as the com­plaint that the same officers are consistently involved in charges of police brutality. Symposium panelists include South Bend Police Chief Loren  Bussert, American Civil Liberties Union attorney George Beamer, and St. Joseph County Legal Aid Director Charles Crutchfield. Also scheduled to appear are Superior Court Judge Frank Kopec, I.U.S.B. sociology pro­fessor Dr. Walter Rister, and St. Joseph County Prosecutor Wil­liam Voor. All proceeds from the sym­posium will go to the South Bend Bail Project, a local, non-profit organization inter­ested in securing general reform in the South Bend bail system. In an interview Saturday, Forhan emphasized that bail reform is desperately needed in South Bend. The principle objec­tion to the current system is that bail is often set so high that the poorer people cannot meet it. The bail levied for shoplifting, for example, is usually in the neighborhood of $300. If a

by Brother Carney Quorums produced a stumb­ling block for the Graduate Student Union in its last two meetings. The group met last Tuesday and Friday in an attempt to adopt a constitution and most of the time (including all of Fri­day's session) was devoted to the section on a quorum. Brielly, the two camps are those who favor a strong rule and those who wish as weak a quorum as possible. Those who hold to the strong view feel that by demanding the majority of the council members and a majority of the departments present to legislate new business, a coup by any small group can be prevented. Their opponents believe that such sl.rict requirements will prevent much action and think lhal it is better to pass some motions with a few people than to accomplish nothing.

Bussing 

====Campus Opinion===== 
One of the by products of enforced school integration which has aroused the ire of moderates in the North and South has been the need to bus large numbers of students in order to achieve a "racial balance" in school systems. Vocifersus opposition has sprung up among parents and legislators alike wlro feel that unless racial 
segregation is sanctioned b}:' statute, it should be left alone. They especially object to bussing students "unreasonable" distances to make integration an accomplished fact. This opposition transcends sectional prejudices. The New York 
Legislature passed a bill in April of 1969 that banned bussing of 
students to achieve racial integration. It was signed by New York's 
liberal governor, Nelson A. Rockefeller. 
The law "prohibits assignment of students to a school on the basis 
ol race, color, or national origin or for the purpose of achieving equality in attendance or reduced attendance at an!.. school of persons of one or more particular races, creeds, colors or national origins" by any school boards that are appointed or by the state commissioner of education. 
Sen. John C. Stennis, of Mississippi, tacked on an amendment to the 1970 Education bill, which is almost an exact duplicate of the New York State bussing ban. Sen. Abraham Ribicoff while voicing support for another Southern amendment which called for equal enforcement of school integration rulings throughout the United States, voiced his opposition to all but the "most limited bussing." 
"You couldn't do anything worse to a black child than to bus him into a middle class suburb," Ribicoff declared, "The phsycological shock and the philosophical shock are as cruel as anything that can be done." 
Soutern Governors have voiced long standing opposition tc bussing as a means of achieving integration. The recent action by Florida's Governor Claude Kirk is one of a series of incidents where Southern Governors have defied arbitrary court orders. 
At the Southern Governor's Conference held in September of 1969 the Governors rejected a statement which condemned bussing and instead urged restraint and good judgement in matters concerning it. 
Viet~ President Agnew, who appeared at the conftrence blasted 
bussing as a means of achieving integration. 
"If people live in a neighborhood they are entitled to associate together. What I mean is that I'm against bussing those children to other neighborhoods simply to achieve an integrated status of a larger geographic entity." The next day the White House issued a statement endorsing Agnew's statement. 
In a story which appeared in October of 1969 the New York Times, it was revealed that Black disenchantement with forced integration was rising, ...,..-much of this feeling was due to bussing. 
Some Blacks opposed the policy of one way bussing, that is the 
policy of bussing only black students to different schools. They feel 
that students of both races should be bussed, or that no bussing 
should be done at all. Others wanted to keep the present segrated 
system, and pressure the states and the Federal government into 
giving them more money to improve their schools. 
It appears that the policy of bussing large numbers of students, in 
order to achieve an artificial racial balance in school districts that 
have de facto segregation, is indefensible. Not only does it cause 
hardships for the students and parents of both races, but it also 
generates race hatred for thrusting together students who are angry 
and resentful at being forced to attend strange schools, due to the 
dictates of federal judges. 
People of both races oppose bussing, so the arguments of 
proponents who content that anti-bussing forces are made up of 
white supremacists, do not stand up to objective scrutiny. People are 
beginning to realize that while time, effort and money are being 
poured into achieving exact racial balances--as defined by 
Supreme Court dictates--little is being done to improve the quality 
of the schools, especially those who have a large percentage of black 
students enrolled. 
I believe quality education for children of all races must .be our 
first and foremost goal. Where de jure segregation exists, it should be 
abolished. since this constitutes a clear example of the "keeo'em in 
their place" philosophy. However in places where the student body of 
a school is predominately of one race because of housing patterns. 
then there should be no governmental interference. All children hav,. 
a right to go to the school nearest their home. They should not be 
forced to go to strange schools merely to satisfy the dictates of those 
who do not have to suffer the results of their rulings.

New white backlash 
When one critically views the history of America, reaching back even to the early seventeenth century slave trade and continuing to the death of Martin Luther King and Fred Hampton, a feeling of anger cannot help but creep in to our minds. The physical and mental repression of Africans during slavery is an uncontested fact, and most white Americans have to be blind not to recognize the forces of legalized slavery since 1863. However, the charges of reverse racism, black segregation, and minority tyranny have been all that white America has offered black people in the last few years. It is an interesting phenomenon of white America that we have categorically been against whatever blacks have proposed. Notice, for example, the continuing dialogue over integration. When Marcus Garvey led the "Back to Africa" movement in the early 20th century, white American found itself in the peculiar position of being almost entirely segregated while-concurrently being against any move of black people to leave America entirely. No one has yet explained whether the whites wanted to live with the blacks or not to live with them. 
In 195 5, Dr. Martin Luther King was able to begin a campaign that would legalize integration, and hopefully force it to occur. Gradually, whites began to accept this idea, although white communities still tended to run when "the colored moved next door." After constant opposition to integration and mass exoduses on the part of whites, blacks in New York and other cities told the white man he didn't want to integrate, but rather wanted to control his own .schools and neighborhoods. Such a negative reaction and uproar that subsequently occured was unbelievable, almost comical. It seems as if whites wait to discover what blacks want and then do everything in their power, contradictions not withstanding, to defeat black demands. 
The white backlash against blacks is growing rapidly. Literature on the subject proceeds in three steps: first, since 1967 the overwhelming majority of whites have believed that black people are not discriminated against any longer. Secondly, many have begun to believe that blacks, chicanos, and other peoples of color constitute a priv!leged minority, with corporate hiring practices, scholarships, welfare programs, "sympathetic" liberal politicians and so on. The third, and most dangerous type of backlash is characterized by a belief that blacks are not only favored, but are actually the oppressors. This is witnessed by the fear of blacks control/in~ their community, by fear of black power, etc. Newsweek magazine (9-1 0-69) ran a special issue devoted specifically to the middle American, "the forgotten man." The underlying theme of the issue was the "oppressed majority." When one remembers that Hitler was 
able to unmercifully annihilate a million people by the same mechanism-convincing them that they were oppressed by the Jews-then Nixon's Jaw and order (unfortunately not law and justice) becomes a thing to be feared. 
The conviction that minonty tyranny is characteristic of 1970 America is perhaps the most dangerous aspect of racism. It enables we whites to wipe guilt from our consciences, to turn our backs on alleged "oppressors" who make Jess than $5,000 a year, and to finally arm ourselves to the teeth. It is an historical force that must be faced and understood for what it is: another rationalization of the white oppressor.

The Model United Nations 

"We, the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. .." 
The preamble to the Charter of the 
United Nations hegins with the above 
words. It is clear that in the two decades 
of the United Nations' existence the 
l!Ucceeding generations have not been 
spared the scourge of war. 
It was to understand why the U.N. has not been the success it should have been that last year l talked with outgoing Academic Commissioner John Mroz about reviving the Model United Nations. Supported by the new Commissioner Pat Dowdall and later Pat McDonough, the Model U.N. quickly come together. Executive Co-ordinator and Delegate Director respedively. The Greg Turza was appointed !USB Co-ordinator and Maureen Phillips SMC Co-ordinator while Torn McGowan handled the block and committee meetings, Joe Polito the physical arrangements for Stepan Center and James Krumme kept watch on the money. Although we were to be helped by dozens of other people as time went on and the actual dates for the UN approached, it was this inner core that would he responsible for making the Model UN a reality. I cannot thank them enough for it. 
I arrived hack at Notre Dame the 
evening bt:fore the first session (having 
been on a USO Tour with John Hurley, 
Warren Bowles and Phil Glotzbach for 
two weeks) to find that, with the 
exct:ption of publicity, everything was 
ready to go. 
The news coverage of the four sessions of the Model UN seemed to stress the levity of the sessions and, I suppose in to deadlines, covered only the first hour of the two five hour evening sessions in which most of the acti:on occured. In 
order to make up for that I'll give a brief recapitulation of what occurred. 
Intervention condemned 
The resolution submitted by Mexico, Uruguay and El Salvador condemning the intervention in the internal affairs of any nation was burdened by its citing of examples. Although the samples condemned both sides in the cold war rather than pacifying both sides with condemnation of their eneimies this brought both the West and the Communist nations down on it, beating a Latin American-African alliance and the resolution was defeated. 
America taxed 
Nicaragua submitted a resolution calling on all nations with per capita incomes of over $2,500 to donate I% of their Gross National Product to the UN for welfare projects. This was passed over the strenuous objections of the American and Kuwait delegations (the only two nations effected.) 
Iraq placed in a resolution calling for the withdrawal of United Nations forces from Korea and the enforced reunification of North and South Korea The West rallied to beat down this motion. 
Rhodesia condemned The Byelorussian SSR, one of two USSR states gran ted rnern hership knin the UN, submitted a resolution condemning nations who traded with the lan Smith regime in Rhodesia. Although the Republic of South Africa attempted to defend the Smith government, the battle raged over naming certain nations as trading with Rhodesia. To be more specific, the Arab states and the Soviet bloc took this opportunity to continue their attack on Israel. Over the opposition of the West, the Rhodesia motion passed. Then came the Albanian resolution on the expulsion of China and replacing it with the People's Republic of China (i.e. the Red Chinese). This motion was amended by Luxembourg to admit Red 

China as representative of China and keep the Chiang Kai-Shek representative as Taiwan. The Luxembourg amendment passed over the vocal opposition of the Red Chinese delegation (Howard Dooley and Joel Connelly) which had been granted speaking rights by the President of the Assembly. The amended motion then passed and Red China was seated in the United Nations. 
This was followed by another Albanian resolution censuring South Africa for their aparthied polocies. South Africa strenuously defended itself with facts on their paternalistic protection of the blacks in South Africa (South African delegate Bo Walton stated that South Africa had more black children in school than any other African nation) but the morality of the situation carried the day and over the opposition of only a handful of nations (South Africa, Spain, Portugal, etc.) the mation of condemnation was passed. 
The South African question again came up with another Albanian resolution demanding freedom for the South African administered UN trust territory of Namibia (South-West Africa). But the question was quickly turned away from 
Africa by an amendment including a condemnation of Israel (the Arabs and Communist nations missed little opportunity to attack Israel) and the counter amendment from Israel attacking the ARa·bs. Finally-the chair ruled all amendments out of order and the assembly returned to the question of 
Namibia and the motion passed. 
A Byelorussian motion to condemn the USA for its policy of inrervention in Laos was amended to include a condemnation of North Vietnam for intervention in Laos, Cambodia and South Vietnam. This amendment brought both American and Soviet opposition, but the amended motion passed easily. 
Israelis win 

t<inally the assembly turned to the Middle East question after skirting it throughout the entire four sessions. The lraai resolution on the settlement of the 
Pa.lenstinian Refugee proglem set off the most bitter and extended debate of the session. The Israeli delegation, led by Rick · Libowitz and Dan Tarnir, denounced the Arab nations for refusing to live in peace with Israel while the Arab nations led by Paul Said of Lebanon, Rich Hunter of Poland and Anne Marie Trdcey of the UAR, blasted what they called Israeli imperialism. 
The deb"te ended with a victory for Israel and the defeat of the Refugee resolution. 
Arabs win 

However, the refugee problem served as only a forerunner to a more direct condemnation of Israel in a Iraqi motion condemning Israel for attacking her neighbors. Emotions ran high and Secretary-General Mike Kendall was twice called in to explain past United Nations policy. This debate resulted in a victory :'or the Arabs. 
The 1970 Model United Nations came 
to a close at midnight, just as the Stepan 
Center staff was trying to close the doors. 
As I went over to the Kuwait delegation 
to gratefully accept a glass of wine which 
they had offered earlier, I recalled what I 
had said at the opening of the first 
session. 

We cannot understand what draws us 
together until we understand what pulls 
us apart. 

Afterwards, standing with the delegates who had moments before been screaming insults at each other and who were not laughing and sharing a glass of wine, I felt 
that -for those who were there at lilY 
rate -the Model UN hao helped pull us 
together.

Government majors to oppose restriction
I 
by Ed Ellis 
A small group of govern­ment majors met last night to organize their opposition to Administration spending policies which they blame for last week's 
restriction  of  courses  in  the  
Government  department  to  
Government majors alone.  

The group's leader, Charlie Zappala, said that the statement of the gourp would be taken to the Administration either Mon­day or Tuesday, and if no reaction is forthcoming, Father Hesburgh would later be approae hed for assistance in the matter. Zappala also hoped that· large numbers of students, when they became aware of the situation, would support the actions taken so far by his group. 
According to Zappala, the action of the government faculty last week and the government majors last night is the culmina­tion of several months of activity to try to alleviate conditions in the department. In 1960, he noted, there were 87 government students, including majors and graduate students, 
and there were 7 teachers for tms group. ln 1Y69, however, the department had to serve .685 students with only 15 faculty members, 5 of whom were not full-time professors. Zappala said that een if the 345 government majors is taken as a base, the student-teacher ratio is over 25-1, whereas the ratio for the University as a whole is only 7-l. He stated, "The University pub­lishes in its catalogue that they have a 7-1 ratio and we pay $3300 a year for this close personal contact. In government, its over 25-l. It's about time something was done about this." According to Zappala, the closing of courses to non-govern­ment majors was a move "abhor­rent to faculty members and students alike." He said that Mr. 
Brinkley, head of the depart­ment, had tried to bring the plight of the department to the attention of the administration as long as 3 months agO"but had received no answers whatsoever. Having failed tto bring the matter to the attention of the administrators by conventional means, the faculty, supported by the stvdents, decided to take the "drastic" action of closing the courses. 
As to the effect this move has had on the Administration, Zap­pala stated, "I don't think the realization that kids aren't going to be able to take government courses has really bhit the Administration." He hoped the people in control would act before course registration, so that if more money was available for the department, students couuuld be admitted into the ~ourses in question. He doubted, however, that the Administra­tion would yield to his group's 

demands. because of "the, various problems they have. This was the situation he is trying to correct. He stated that any such restriction of course choice is "an absolute insult to the acaQemic system which makes it necessary.' He criti­cized heavily current University priorities that restrict spending in the College of Arts and Letters even though that is by far the largest growing sector of 
the UUniversity Community. 
Zappala hopes that such 
"blatant undermining of th1e 
philosophy of the University.' 
will arouse a large number of 
students who will be affected by 
the restriction policy. 
support materializes, 
Asked about Fr. Hesburgh's position at pre­sent, Zappala said, "I don't even think he knows about it." 

Redefinition of functions is only change 
(continued from PaKe 1I 
University's administrative struc­
ture. 
Miss Grabowski was the first 
to speak. She stressed .the fact ·that the Nutting for President Movement was not "an anti­
Hesburgh campaign." 
She later commented: "We 
thought that was very important 
to.emphasize, and said so at the 
very beginning to make sure 
they didn't get the wrong 
impression." 
She made clear that-the office 
of President has too much work 
for just one man, describing as 
"important" Hesburgh 's many 
activities. 
According to MissGrabowski, 
student Ken Guentert spoke 
next on the personal attributes 
of Professor Nutting and Father 
Hesburgh. "Their personalities 
would fit this particular struc­
ture so well that it would really 
work," said Karen, paraphrasing 
Guentert. 
Jack Shaeffer next explained 
his reasons for joining the 
movement. Karen said that 
Shaeffer stated he had joined 
because of "the academic reform 
that Doctor Nutting symbo­
lizes." 
Shaeffer described the current 
system as "a job-getting process" 
where the diploma was simply 
"redeemable for cash." He cited 
that the grade has often become 
more important than the learn­
ing process, and called for a shift 
in emphasis toward learning. 
Jim Bryan, the next to speak, incident as an example of the need for a full-time Pre~ident. Fiala said the group had un­successfully tried to contact Hesburgh for three months, and that positive action was taken to save the Fieldhouse only when Hesburgh returned-two days be­fore the scheduled demolition. 

Mike Shaughnessey wrapped up the student presentations claiming that there were two Notre Dames. Karen recalled that he referred to the Trustees as the "corporation Notre Dame" and to the "everyday" Notre Dame as the "community Notre Dame." 
He described the community as incomplete, where frustration with the present kind of educa­tion leads students to "get drunk 

every  weekend."  He  said  the  
President-Chance llor  structure  
would  change  the  type  of  


Experiment 
(continued from page 1) 

Another important proposal concerning grades is the estab­lishment of a trial "pass-fail" option. Under this program any junior or senior undergraduate may choose to take one elective, non-major course per semester on a pass-fail basis. 
When asked if he thought the new program would work, Father Walsh replied: 
"From the logistics point of view it ought to work. Whether it will actually encourage stu­dents to take a course that they would like to take just for the intellectual excitement and value of itself, without fear of getting a low mark-whether that will actually happen only experience will tell. But certainly this is one of the reasons we established pass-fail," he said. 
Walsh went on to say that pass-fail has been tried in other universities with mixed results­in some cases it has been abandoned, he said. 
One resolution of the Council recommends expansion of the counselling services to include not only better centralization but also the development of informal faculty-student meeting places "where spontaneous ad-

"Teaching is sometimes re­garded as one of the  liberal arts-the art of reaching. In order for a student to get a liberal arts education one thing he ought to do is teach," said Father Walsh. 
In :. long awaited move one resolution halved the university undergraduate requirement of Theology and Philosophy to six hours each. 
Walsh explained that this was done "not with any idea at all of diminishing their importance, but simply as a way of making it p~ssible for the Theology and Philosophy departments to con­centrate their efforts on a fewer number of courses and hopefully make them more exciting for the student." 
The report also proposes that the curriculum include a number of "core" courses "to unify the student academic experience and to provide a distinctive commu­nity of discourse." According to Father Walsh these courses would be those that all students.

no matter which college they belong to, would be required to take. 
In other important resolutions the Academic Council endorsed! the establishment of work-study programs in the colleges to, as Father Walsh phrased it, "vital­ize and make contemporary the educational experience." 
They also gave high priority to the continuation and expan­sion of the International Pro­gram and to the increased use of modern educational media for 
the  improvement  of  teaching  
techniques.  
Bill  Locke,  former  Student  

Union Academic Affairs Com­missioner, voiced a distinct dis­appointment with the Academic Council's resolutions after hav­ing worked on the Curriculum Revision Committee since last spring. 
"The curriculum revision ef­fort effected some structural changes which are, one must admit, desirabl.e (largely in a better-than-nothing sense), but hardly adequate. The final pro· posals, when one considers the many professional educators involved in their formulation and con:oideration, are embarras­singly unimaginative, derivative and superficial," he said. 
The new Academic Affairs Commissioner, Bill Wilka, said that in the next two weeks he and his assistant, Boh Meyers, will be collecting background information on curriculum revi· sion and will be drawing up a list of priorities for next year. 
"The thing we're specifically interested in right now is the counselling-more individual at­tention to students. Also we want to look into the idea of a person taking a comprehensive examination at the beginning of a semester and just getting "pass" credit in it rather than having to take the course," said Wilka.

Law and order breaks down 
Maddox threatens martial law 
ATLANTA ( UPI) Gov. Lester Maddox moved more stat~: troopers into Ludowid Sunday and threatened to de­dare martial law in the south <leorg.ia city after nightriders firl'li into the horne of a crime fighting minister. 
''I would be cautious but I wouldn't hesitate a minute in declaring martial law in Long County if the safety of the people was at stake," the govern­or said of the latest development in his continuing feud with Ludowici and Long County political leaders. 
"This would require us to take over the local government and the law enforcement machi­nery," the governor added. "Law and order has broken down in Long County." 
The threat came after Rev. Raymond Cook, a Methodist Church minister who had led courthouse demonstrations against the "totally corrupt" political establishment of Long County, called Maddox by tete-

This is the third in a jile-part series written hy the Nutting for President Headquarters. 
As we emphasized at the beginning, this paper will at­tempt to address the re-structur­ing issue in a way that avoids the discussion (or question) of the personalities of the recom­mended office-holders. 
If our proposal is adopted, the University administrative struc­ture will be altered in only one fundamental way: there will be a redefinition of the office of President. and the creation of the post of Chancellor, a posi­tion which will be the highest appointed administrative post. 
To be in a position to understand the nature of the 
. revision, we must first embark 
on a brief digression: Why do we 
need this restructuring? 
We have already attempted to answer this question in our first series of position papers (Feb. 25 -March 4 Observer; xeroxed copies available for $.35 from Box 813, St. Mary's College, Notre Dame, Ind. 46556), but in 
a  "25  words  or  less  type  of  
answer":  We  feel  the duties of  
the  Presidency  as  it  now  exists  

are physically too great for one man. Secondly there now exists a lack of real communication between the highest decision­making levels and the students and faculty, due in large measure to the current administrative framework. 
We will return to how the Chancellor-President proposal is an improvement in these areas shortly. First, we present a more specific outline of the new structure. The only change we are proposing is a redefinition of the functions, responsibilities, and duties of the President. One could legitimately view this as abolishing the office of President and replacing it with a bi-partite 
hoard, with the two hoard members given precise and 
equally significant responsibi­
lities. 
Many have advocated a radical restructuring of the administra­tive bureaucracy beneath the President, while others have contended that this structure "suits me fine." Whatever the case may be, we are not proposing the revision of other various lower-level (vice­president, etc.) administrative positions or the replacement of the current administrative office holders. 
The new structure may neces­sitate the re-assignment of the current President's secretaries and assistants, as secretaries and assistants to the Chancellor, but definitely it will not require the replacement or redefinition of the Vice-Presidents. 
The Chancellor-President structure is a logical outgrowth of Rourke and Brook's observa­tion: 
... universities like other organ­izations have found it necessary once they reach an advanced stage to establish systems of governance in which the chief executive shares authority over decision making with other officials. The range of subjects over which decision must now range is so vast as to demand the advantages of division oflabor ... 
(p.l/1). 
The division of labor which is proposed here will make the Chancellor responsible for the "external" affairs of the Univer­sity and the President respon­sible for the "internal" affairs, while all matters of overlapping concern will be dealt with jointly. 
Is the distinction external­internal valid for describing the functions of a University Chan­cellor and President'!: 
It is quite common to find those who speak most frequent­ly on University governance using the expression "external" and "internal" in describing the functions of University adminis­phone shortly after 3 a.m. Sunday to report the shooting. 
Cook said buckshot shattered a kitchen window and lodged in the wall and ceiling after he got up and turned on a light to get a 
drink of water.  He  had  just  
walked  hy  the  window,  he  
added.  


"I suppose this shooting has resulted from some of our attempts to dear up the cancer­ous elements in Long County that have given GtiDrgia such a had name," Maddox said. 
"I have reason to believe that this is a reaction from our program to straighten out the 
county." 
Ludowici, on U.S. highways 301 and 82, has long had a rep uta lion for harboring speed traps and clip joints used to fleece motorists from New York and other eastern points on their way to Florida. 

AISEC extends membership 
by Mark Day 
Ilea ding in a new directionn, AIESEC, an international organi­zation that places students in overseas jobs, is extending its membership to include non­business majors and is promising greater selectivity in its job placements. 
This organization. especially here on campus, is encouraging all interested students to investigate the summer program, originally limited to business or economics majors. The reason for this change is that the organization is 
broadening  its  program  to  in­ 
clude  jobs  in  many  different  
companies,  which  will  develop  

management skills as well as providing good business exper­ience for the participants. 

Students give reason behind 
trators: "It would not be pos­sible, of course, to deal even superficially with all these rela­tions [i.e. those of the Presi­dent I, because one college dif­fers from another. But we can consider briefly some external and internal relationships which are common to most presidents of Catholic colleges." (Stanford, 
A Guide to Catholic College Administration, p. 49). Stanford elaborates by cataloguing the external relations (diocese, alumni, educational associations, . other national organizations, sis­ter institutions, general public) and the internal relations (Board · of Trustees, administrative offi­cers, faculty, students, religious community). 
Using a similar distinction (of external and internal activities) Rourke and Brooks suggest the current state of the University President's duties: "The basic duties with which the chief executive office is charged can range very widely. As in the case of the American university presi­dent, many of his duties center on external rather than internal affairs. He represents the Univer­sity in its contacts with state... 

Joe Loughery, a junior econo­mics major and the head of AIESEC at Notre Dame, recent­ly returned from Tokyo where the international conference took place. At this meeting 4000 students were matched with individual jobs, 70% by com­puter. The remaining 30% were matched by the delegates them­selves, since they found the 
computor  was  not  flexible  
enough  to  cover  all  of  the  
unusual cases.  

There are presently 24 Notre Dame students in the program who wish summer employment abroad. Of these, 20 have already been placed in jobs. After another computerized exchange in Rotterdam in a few weeks, the remaining four N.D. 
students will probably be placed in the jobs. 
The job of AIESEC at Notre Dame goes beyond the placing of N.D. students abroad; it also must line up jobs for foreign students all over Indiana. 
Another important function of the AIESEC group, of which there are 93 members altogether, is the reception of all the forei&n students who come to Indiana. 
Here in South Bend, this committee also arranges gather­ings during the summer at which the foreign student can meet with various members of the community to discuss com­munity problems. Faculty mem­bers, other students, and busi­ness men join with the foreign students to talk on relevant issues facing South Bend, such as urban development, and local government -issues in which
