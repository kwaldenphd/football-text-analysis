NEW ORLEANS (AP)--Police in New Orleans returned to work yesterday after a 15-day strike. But they did so only after rejecting on Saturday the city's final contract offer.

by Sue Wuetcher Senior StaffReporter 
The University is definitely going to implement the student referendum thar calls for a boycott of Nestles produqs, according to John Dunbar, World Hunger Coali~ion spokesman. 
Dunbar, who met with Vice President for Student Affairs Fr. John Van Wolvlear last week, said "I think the decision was m'ade some time· ago to go ahead with the boycott if certain conditions were met by the coalition, and a majority of the student body voted in favor of the boycott.'' _ 
The conditions specified by Van Wolvlear included that objective articles covering both sides of the issue by published in The Observer, oral presenta­tions be made to the students by representatives of both sides of the issue, and a pro and con information sheet be made available to the students. 
Dunbar noted that he talked with Robert Robinson, senior food service director, who said that he would go ahead with plans for the boycott as soon as he hears from Bro. Kiernan Ryan, assistant vice president for business affairs. Robinson said diat he had some Nestle's products in stock and would use them before switching to another brand.

Hesburgh calls for changes in political 
e e e 
prtortttes 
by Ann Gales News Editor 

The problem of fulfilling basic human needs for all men is "not a question of technol­ogy, but one of priorities," University President Fr. Theodore Hesburgh told a small audience in the Center for continuing Education auditor­ium yesterday. 
"We don't lack the science or technology required to solve the problem, we just lack the political will,'' he explained. 
Hesburgh's remarks came in the concluding lecture of the Student Government-sponsored Less Developed Countries Con-­ference. A charter member of the U.S. Civil Rights Commis­sion and current chairman of the United Nations Council on Science and Technology, Hesburgh addressed the topic of "Moral and Ethical Respon­sibility to Our Fellow Man.'' 
Speaking specifically to the students in attendance, Hesbursh commented, ''Your generation is in an absolutely unique situation compared to any other generation of human­ity." 
"Since humanity began, we've been having a terrible time fulfilling basic human needs of food, shelter, educa­tion and freedom,'' he contin­ued. ''Your generation is different because for the first time in the history of mankind, you have the chance to do something about it.'' 
Hesburgh pointed out that the world spent $400 billion on armaments last year, adding that "every country is presently spending more on armaments than on health and education.'' Solving the problems of world hunger, illiteracy, dis­ease and housing will reguire ''political organization, political will, and priority changes in allocation of resources,'' Hesburgh said. Man will have to decide that to "feed people and give them a little hope is ·more important than spending 
billions on armaments.'' 
Hesburgh used Iran, a coun­try with an enormous income, as an example, saying that the Shah spent more on sophisti­cated arrmaments than on im­proving t~e stan_d~rd of living 
for  Irantan  ctuzens,  and  
''wound  up  losing  his  own  
people.''  

Hesburgh related several in­cidents of his own experience in travelling and workmg in less developed countries, referring_ specificallY. to the problems of housing, Illiteracy and lack of medical care. 
"Every Latin American city I've ever been to was surround­ed by miles and miles of huts that we wouldn't put farm animals in,'' Hesburgh said. "They're human beings the same as we are, but they're living in huts made of flattened tin cans." 
According to Hesburgh, one

Dr. Hooks discusses black rights 
by Maureen Heraty StaffReporter 
Dr. Benjamin L. Hooks, ex­
ecutive director of the NAACP, 
gave a talk on black rights and 
black accomplishments Satur­day night in Washington Hall. The Black Cultural Arts Center ·sponsored Hook's appearance 
as part of the black culture 
festival. 
A crowd of 100 people listen­
ed to Hooks' description of the 
NAACP's accomplishments. 
Hooks related that the Civil 
Rights movement had pro­
foundly changed' the lives, of 
America1. blacks. 
Hooks used his own life as an 
example of the changes insti­
tuted by the civil rights move­
ment and the subsequent 
NAACP. 
He explained that he had left 
the South to attend a law school 
in the Midwest because no southern law school would admit him. Sixteen years later, his hometown of Memphis, TN, appo~nted him as judge in the ctrcult court. 
In his speech, Hooks caution­ed blacks against militancy. "We don't want bitterness, vindictiveness or hatred,'' he explained. He added that blacks should strive for equal recognition among whites, but in away that would not alienate the two races. 
Hooks asked the blacks to remember their heritage "\YJ,. forget the pain and the --:.. ,:,, the trouble and the sorrow, and the men and women who made sacrifices," he stated. 
He regretted that ''when it comes to black history, we have been written out of the books. Many ofus do not know who we are.'' 
Hooks outlined the problems that blacks face today. He cited the Alan Bakke case as a setback in the Civil Rights movement. A white man, Bakke had sued a medical school in California because he believed that the school had accepted blacks less qualified than him in order to Increase state aid to the school. Hooks blamed Bakke's victory on the "wave of conservatism" that has swept the country. 
Hooks insisted that whites should allow blacks the chance to grow and develop their 
·.;;abiiilies. "In 1979, we're 
. ·inanding that cl-t~nce. We're

billion peoJ;>le in the world today are functionally illiterate. "They can't even read the directions on a package of seeds," he remarked, adding that ''illiteracy is the end of growth.'' 
Hesburgh stressed that the technology required to do some thing about the problem of illiteracy is available. "You can sit in your home and watch someone· walk on the moon. We have the technology to do spectacular things,'' he stated. "The .fact is we're not doing them. 
The United States isfresent­ly spending billions o dollars on health research each year, but it is mostly aimed at heart disease and cancer--America's two biggest killers, Hesburgh pointed out. "On the other hand, only about $6 million per year is spent researching all tropical diseases," he said. 
"Human misery is endemic on this earth," Hesburgh com­mented. "It comes mostly from a lack of political mobilization. We are doing a little, but what we're doing amounts to putting band-aids on cancers." 
"In answer to the question of what our moral and ethical responsibilit}' is, I think that was answered a long time ago when God asked Cain where 
Abel was. Cain answered, 'Am 
I my brother's keeper?' If you read the New Testament care­fully, I think you'll conclude that the answer is yes."

students of Notre Dame will 

In a question-and-answer period following the lecture, 
· Hesburgh responded to ques­tions about American and Uni­versity investments in South Africa, commenting, "I dis­agree with some of our faculty on this issue. I think they trnd to romanticize and exaggerate the problem." 
-''I spent two weeks of my life, which is not that free, 
. investigating the situation and talking with University direc­tors and black leaders m South Africa," Hesburgh revealed. "I came out with the idea that no matter what we did we weren't going to affect things that much.'' 
American business in South Africa amounts only to about 15 percent.of total business there, Hesburgh pointed out. "We are small potatoes in Soutl-­Africa. If we pulled our tomorrow, the only thing that would happen wpuld be that a lot of blacks who now have jobs would find themselves unem-· ployed." 
Also, he said, the ] apanese would probably buy all the American busmesses, which would only complicate the pro­blem. "I don't want to pull out. I want to stay in and fight," he concluded.

The play centered around six Saint Mary's girls who were going home for a weekend for various reasons. A Southern belle was attending a debutante ball, the daughter of a senator was returning home for a press conference, one girl's family performed a dance in Madison Garden with the remaining three girls of Jewish, Italian and Irish backrounds provided more comic relief. 
The Salvation Sophomres, directed by Cathy Gorman, provided backround music for the play. 
A reception in Stapleton Lounge followed the perform­ance. The room was croweded as performers, students and parents mingled over cham­pagne and pastries. 
Saturday's events began with an address by College Presi­dent John Duggan welcoming the parents and commending the value of a liberal arts education at Saint Mary's. An open house with the faculty enabled parents to spenk with various representatives of every department at the college. 
The Convention Hall at the Century Center was decorated with red and white flowers for­the dinner dance Saturday evemng. The band "Don Carone'' performed following the dinner. Over 860 parents, sophomores and their dates attended the affair, which was

 

Goulet discusses problems at le~ure 
by Donna Teevan 

"Perspectives on the Third World," a lecture by Denis Goulet, opened the ftrst Less Developed Co"untries Conference Friday night in the Center for Continuing Education. 
Goulet stressed that ''there are no pre-existin~ recipes" for relieving deprivation in under­developed countries to an audience that included student-representatives from 11 colleges across the nation. 
Before introducing Goulet, Student Body President Andy Mckenna, who stressed the need for creating a Third World Conference as part of his SBP platform last year, stated that the goals of the conference were "to educate us about urgent J>roblems, to provide models for solutions, and to facilitate group discussion about these problems.'' Tbe conference was sponsored by the Notre Dame Student Government. 
Goulet, a senior fellow on the Overseas Development Council, described under­development as "chronic vulnerability.'' He exr,lained that this vulnerability is 'a lack of power and an absence of ho_pe that you can change thmgs--creating an atmosphere of despair." 
He asked the audience to "imagine the type of home that you're used to living in, then transform yourself into a person living in a less developed country. There would be no electricity, sewage,' furniture, windows, and perhaps not even a roof to keep the rain out.'' 
The grimness of this poverty "breeds complacency and unrealism in the affluent few who are surrounded by it, 11 according to Goulet. ''They begin to rationalize that destiny is irrational or that God is capriCious·, II he stated. He also noted that this type of rationalization is built into most political systems. · 
Goulet traced the attention given to the Third World in recent years to "the shock of underdevelopment and the consciousness that this need 
not be." He stated that this shock should "arouse a sense of 
responsibility,  which  is  
energetic  and  looks  to  the  
future,  rather than  guilt  that  

dwells in the l?ast. Since human misery 1s a human creation, it is reversible." 
Goulet described his own interpretation of ''the human imperative," the subject of a book by University President Fr. Theodore Hesburgh. One aspect of this concept, which Goulet describes as two-fold, is that people should "be the subjects of history rather than its objects; they should be making history.'' 
The second part of Goulet's "human imperative" is transcendence. It involves the respect for the dignity of the people by "allowing them to deftne their own developmental needs." 
Goulet em~hasized the need for creativity 10 approaching the problem of underdevelopment. He said that solutions do not come from "the drawing boards of strategists, but from experiments in day-to-day livmg. '' He deftned develop-

Another ''foreign substance'' was found in the food at the North Dining Hall Saturday as a student discovered an inch-long grasshopper in the bean salad at lunch. , 
It was the fifth complaint in less than a wek where a student or employee found a foreign substance, as dining hall managers call it, in the food. Last week, three worms were found in the corn with another complaint regarding a maggot believed to be in the bacon. 
The rash of complaints was termed "unusual" by Ronald Athey, Food Service director at the North Dining Hall. Athey, however, stated "it is not uncommon to ftnd a foreign substance in food. We have our employees check the food for foreign substances, but it is difficult to detect them 
sometimes." 
The grasshopper found was colored a dark red, the same color as the kidney beans used in the salad. According to Athey, "I believe the grasshopper was located with the canned kidney beans, thus the problem would originate with the packers not the Notre Dame Food Service." 
Athey said immediate action will be taken to resolve the matter of the canned kidney beans. Yet, he emphasized that a closer inspection by 
employees offood at the dining hall would be the only action that could be taken to stop the qverall rash of fmdings. 
Last week 300 pounds of corn had to be thrown out and 6 5 cases were returned to packers for inspection because of bore worms found. Athey said that there would be an inspection of the kidney beans to determine what action would be taken. 
The student who discovered the Jrasshopper while at the sala bar is a roommate of one of the students who found a bore worm in the corn last week.

Among the methods that Goulet claimed were successful in improving conditions in impoverished nations, was a program which encouraged self-help. This was achieved primanly by a ''new Interpretation of traditional values," which gave the people a new sense of pride, accordmg to Goulet. 
Since "most oppressed people have no access to the controls of the nation,'' Goulet stressed the need for the ''creation of leverage points'' at the local level. 
He illustrated the possible strength of a local community by relating how a northern Malaysian fishing village rebelled against a government­imposed development plan and formulated theu own plan in which they incorporated 
modern technology into their traditional way of life.

·. Titmuss' ''moral choice of giving'' to the present 
It would not be too presumptuous to apply

~ 
~~i6H~~t~i circumstances where campus organizations are tntrt&tch:anjg¢; seeking approval of a ban on various products 
such as Nestle's chocolate and Libby's tomatoes. Is it not curious that these groups, which profess stron~ "moral" reasons for -taking an 


Politics, Protest and Freedoni 
Editor's Note: The following is the first of a two-part column dealing with "Politics, Protest and Freedom" in terms of Boycotts. The second part will appear in tomorrow's editorial page. 
Recently, friends and acquaintances of mine became deeply involved in a debate over the merits of . an attempt by several campus organizations to set-up a ban of products of certain American and foreign corporations. The effort at banning would resemble that made several years ago involving the use of union, non-union lettuce. Essentially, these organizations seek to gain majority approval through referendum (of plebecite) of a ban on the use of these products by Notre Dame Food Services. In the following essay I would like to examine these efforts at banning from two perspectives. In the first instance, I owe a great deal to Raymond Titmuss and his work, The Gzft Relationship (1971). In the second, Alexis de Tocqueville and his Democracy in America serve as a source of inspiration. 
Timuss' work deals with a study of the ¥arious ways and means politics have dealt with the problem of the dtstribution of blood in their respective societies. His analysis yields three frameworks for distrib:.1tion: a command system (Soviet Union), a free market system (U.S.) and a volunteer system (Great Britain). It is the last two systems which interest Titmuss the most, and from comparing and contrasting them both he arrives at his thesis: the notion of the gift relationship. Titmuss points out that the volunteer system of Britain is far and away the most successful means of guaranteeing a high quantity as well as quality of blood. The author singles out the notion of voluntarism as being the single most important reason for the success of this program. Titmuss expllains the failure of the free market system and the success of the volun\eer system: 
''(In the free market system). all policy in the end would become economic policy and the only values that would count are those that can be measured in terms of money and ~ursued in the dialectic ofhedonism. Each indivtdual would act egotistically for the good of all by selling his blood for what the market would pay" (p. 12) 
Essentially, as Titmuss points out, the private market system ''deprives men of their freedom to choose to give or not to give." This deprivation not only abolishes the moral choice of giving but by so doing, it escalates other coercive forces in the social system which lead to the denial of other freedoms. For Titmuss, obviously, economics is not everything. The use of coercwn (USSR) or material benefits (U.S.) not only fails to provide for a successful system of distribution of blood, but it also denies the individual the gift relationship: the moral choice of giving. ­

action resultmg m the removal of these 
products, would at the same time deny their own 
supporters the right to ''choose to give up or not 
to give up" usmg those products every day, 
three times a day? 
In other words, if supporters of a "boycott" are serious in their efforts to register their moral outrage at the .(>Olicies of these corporations, why do they instst upon a device (the "ban" which differs in nuance from the boycott) which allows them to escape, so easily, the resronsibility of free choice? Is it because they fee that their own supporters lack in "gumption" or integrity to such an extent that they would fail to be responsible to their own moral decisions? Or, is it because they believe that in order to gain their objective, lt will be necessary to coerce others (i.e., everyone in the commumty who may not be a supporter, for various reasons) into their "boycott' as well? If this be the case, we are reminded of Titmuss' argument: that when the moral choice of giving is denied this tends to initiate other, more coercive means in the social system to accomplish an objective. 
But such coercive alternatives tend to deny other freedoms as well. In this case, the successful imposition of a ban on certain products would deny those who do not wish to boycott those products ther freedom to act otherwise. The desire to initiate the more coercive means of banning as opposed to the more voluntaristic means of boycotting may be viewed by the banning organizations as a necessary evil. But is it necessary? Is it not possible, in theory at least, that the goals of a boycott, if supported by a committed maiority (or minority for that matter), can be achteved without imposing on the good of others? 
The World Hunger Coalition offers us an example whereby much is achieved through the effort of a boycott of ~orts as opposed to a condition of absolute denial. A WHC member chooses to ~ive up a meal on Wednesday evenings. Thts is a distinctly moral act because it involves a personal decision of self-denial. But what if WHC decides to hold a referendum which would result in a ban on all meals on Wednesday evenings. What happens to the personal decision of self-denial? It is certainly no longer a moral decision because the individual no longer decides between the real choice of eating a meal or not. And choice by referendum is choice in the abstract only, since · the abolition of alternatives (i.e., when all meals are banned on Wednesday night~) is the abolition of choice. The realm of moral decision is removed, freedom abridged. But, we should note that in this case, although only a minority of students choose self-denial, the Wednesday night fast has been a success in terms of its specific moral purpose: to bring others to an awareness of hunger in the world. 
Of course, the object of the banning ·of organizations may not be simply to make others aware of the immorality of certain corporations .. It may be an attempt to pumsh these corporations as well. But with this we must necessarily move to a sphere ofactivity that goes well beyond moral obJectionism. It is a spere that is best characterized by obedience, coercion and authority. It is the spere of oolitical action.

One advantage of this university that you won't read about in Notr~ Dame Ma~azine is its close J?-toxi(llity to many 'rooms and establishments whose main feature is a counter at which alcoholic beverages are served." While freshmen seem content to frequent section parties, something happens to most swdems in the course of sophomore years. They are attracted to those rpoms an~ establishments like. alumni .to a11; ~ail gater. Eventually the campus be~ comes too confining, and the student's horizons are broadened to the far corner of Eddy St. and South Bend Ave. 
One Thursday night I set out to uncover what makes the bars so appealing. .. My first . SJ9P :was Corby's, a drafty, moderately sized, establishment done in Early American Speaker.

Do you think conversations in rhe bars are too predictable? Her: Sophomore. What year are you? TH: Have you ever made a lasting friendship with anyone you me~ at a bu? · Her: Psychology. What's yo\U"S~ as the kind and number of artists there are. ·For ~~me p~ople being an artist means wnttng a volume of poems or painting a large number of water­colors. Other people may never think 
of themselves as artists, and yet they certainly deserve that distinction: whittling, a piece of redwood can be as artistic an activity as planting a garden 
······.or writing a poem. At one time art was a common activity--the shoemaker was as much an artist as the bookbinder or the cooper. People knew by heart their own local folk tales, and make their own furniture. They never formulated critical theories about what they were doing, and they had no interest in doing so. They didn't have to put into words how they felt about their activity--they just did it. Art is something I think everyone has an impulse to Participate, which is not to say that it is done equally well by all people. Perhaps it can be likened to being inquisitive. All of us have a fundamental inquisitiveness. Some people encourage this, cultivate this. 


 

T. Peter 0 'Brien 
Other people have little respect fo~ it. Perhaps artists are those people who encourage their natural inquisitive­ness. It may be we can never know the answers, but we must, as Rilke says, "learn to love the questions them­selves.'' 
The Senior Arts Festival is an encouragement for people who do things. You may consider yourself an artist, you may not. That's not important. Wh.flt is important is that you give something of yourself to what you do. 
The three dimensional portion of the festival is now in the process of searching for the work of seniors. Someone once told me the business of art is to make art. If you are particularly pleased with something you've made--a bookcase, or a weaving, or a metal sculpture, or anything--and would like to share it with others, then the festival would like to hear from you. We alread )' have various things submitted, a hand built dulcimer, pottery, weaving, sculpture. We're still looking for more. 
If you're interested in making any contributions to the three dimensional portion of the Senior Arts Festival, call me at 8852·, or during the day at 2133. 
Prayer: The Essence and the DangerFr.BmToohey 
It was a strange coincidence. At the very time The Observer was being distributed, with my last column on prayer, I was at the hospital with the parents and friends of Andy Sowder. His parents came up and asked me to fray with them. We joined arms. And 
began to wonder what to say. 
Permit me a bit of background by way of getting around to how I tried to answer their request. First of all, it seems worth emphasizing the fact that it is perfectly normal and acceptable to mention to God our needs and special wishes for others. Even though He is already aware of them it is still the spontaneous and natural things one does with a Father. 
The asking part is quite appropriate (the sort of things we see in so many of the psalms, for instance); and may prove very helpful as a lead-in to prayer, It is important to remember, however, that what I may call prayer for myself or for you isn't really prayer at all if it's a mere request, simply an asking. That's not the essence of prayer. As we emphasized last time, no matter how it is actually expressed, every prayer must have the form of a request ("Be merciful to me, a sinner"); m irs essence, however, it is more accurately r~cognized as an answer, an openinR, a surrender. 
The point rs clarified if we analyze the request of Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane. He very explicttly asked for a favor, that He might be spared sufferin~: "Father, let this cup pass me by.' But that wasn't prayer. The prayer came when Jesus added, "But not my will but yours be done." Here we on~erve the verbalization of His 
faithful surrender at that moment a most a~;>propriate articulation of "I believe 10 You." · 
The request to be spared death wasn't answered; but th~ prayer was. His prayer was, first of all, His own answer to the word of the Father, as Jesus perceived it through faith-­somethtng, we might speculate, like this: "Son, I do not want your painful cruciftxion. But I have determined that men should be free; so I ask that you accept the unavoidable conse­quences of your mission to reveal the kingdom.'' 
By His willingness to let go in prayerful surrenaer' Jesus opened Himself totally to His Father; thus His answer was answered with love. We detect this same concept of prayer in a remark Malcolm Muggeridge made in his book about Mother Teresa of Calcutta: "Pray, and your heart will grow big enough to receive Him." 
In the light of this, it's hard to think in terms of "praying for myself," in the sense of a method of getting an answer to requests. It is surely fitting to mention my needs to God; but7 if I truly pray, I am offering myself, not just my requests. Specific needs frequently are not answered, surren­der always is. In that sense, prayer is infallible. 
What I'm su~gesting here is the importance of dtstinguishing between requests and prayer. There's nothing w~ong with asking, even requestion miracles; but none of this is prayer unless there is that element of 
. surrender ("I believe in You"; "Not my will but thine be done'') we've been speaking about. 
So, although I wouldn't have hesi­rated to ask for a healing miracle for Andy Sowder, the prayer with his r.arents had a different kind of spirit: 
'Father, we believe you are a God of the living; we cannot understand what has happened; it is a mystery we cannot fathom. But we reaffirm our trust that you love Andy and desire everlasting joy for him. We believe this. Our expressing it has helped to open us to your presence, so that you might be able to support us at this ttme of our great need." 
What we've been saying about prayer discloses also its danger. If God &ives His spirit each time we really pray, it will change our lives. We can understand how C.S. Lewis could write: "We shrink from too naked a contact, because we are afraid of his divine demands upon us which it might make too audible.'' What we find' is this: With an old notion of prayer, a lot of people were inclined to leave their problems with God, unload their wants and needs upon Him ... and then go on living as if nothing had happened. 
That notion of prayer can weaken or detract from our service in the world. It can reduce our will to solve our own problems, by tempting us to leave in God's hands what has actually been placed in our own. For example, we may-be so out of touch with reality as to say to God, ''Please feed the hungry people," without realizing that, if we would only listen, God is saying to us, "Don't expect me to take on your ?.wn task; ybu feed the hungry people! 
Actually the evidence of the unan­
swered requests of those with whom I 
live points to the facr that I haven't really prayed. You see, God intends that, to a great degree, we should answer each other's requests. Say, for example, you ask for bread. If I have prayed, I will be led by the spirit given me to touch your life --to feed your hunger. God has answered your need by leading me to a new awareness and loving action. My lack of response to you, on the other hand, is a sure si~n that I haven't let Him into my life through prayer. 

Have you ever thought of this? If the enemies of ] esus had been men of prayer, Jesus' request to be spared cruciftxion would have been answered! The Father wanted His Son to be loved; but leaving men free, He took the risk they wouldn't permit His spirit into their lives, which would have guided them to spare His son. Consequently, prayer turns us out in service, answering the needs of others. 
What a marvel! So many have asked for liberation, freedom from oppres­sion and poverty; asked for breaad, jobs, decent housing, justice; asked for someone who will care. If they've prayed, while they express these needs, they' be been open to the gift of His spirit--and that's wonderful. But if we, too, have prayed, that same spirit will move us towards these needy brothers and sisters; and a praying people will reach out to one another. fsn' t that the meaning of that other prayer we pray: "Come, Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful; enkindle-within them the fire of your divine love. Send forth your spirit and they shall renew the face of the earth.''

A pair of returmng finalists had a rough ~o of it in the 167-p~ound division. Tom Plouff, a native of South Bend, lost in his bid to return to the finals. Mike Budd used super­ior quickness to offset Plouff's reach and claim a unanimous decision. 
A similar fate nearly befell Jim Devine, last year's champ­ion at 162. Devine fought senior John Mandico to a standoff after two rounds, and it appeared as though ~andico had a shot at an upset victory on the strength of his agressive­ness in the final round. But D{"vine was awarded a split decision, which set off a chorus of boos from the crowd.

with the emphasis on Easy Care' 
In another decision that was unpopular with the fans, 135­pounder John Fitzpatrick ad­vanced to the semi-finals over Steve Gill. Once again the fight was close, but Gill appeared much less tired near the bout's end. Fitzpatrick stumbled briefly several times, but held on for the split decision. 
The other quarterfinal pair­ing at 135 also ended in a split decision. Junior Bob Murphy made his early scoring stand up to gain the verdict over Michael Ruwe. Murphy held the upper hand for most of the first two rounds, but Ruwe began to counter-punch quite effectively late in the bout. 
Freshman Tom Bush dis­played a lightening KO punch 10 his first Bengal Bout appear­ance. After Jim Brown scored with a combination, Bush un­leashed a sledgehammer right that dropped Brown to the canvas at 0:48 of the second round. 
Other quarter-final winners were Chris Mac Donald (130), Jeff Mosher ( 140), Mike Mazurek (140), Walt Rogers (145), Steve Heidle (145), Jim Owens (145), Mark Roetzel (149), Dan Stockrahm (149), Brian Kilb (152), Jeff Mitroka (152), Steve Brown (152), Mike Norton (152), Steve Mynsberge (157), Mike Rukavina (157), Bruce Belzer (162), Glenn

SUGGESTIONS 


In your home, your dwelling, right where you live--spend this first week of Lent getting right with yourself. Go back to prayer. Visit the grotto twice a week. Spend two minutes in chapel after your evening meal before starting to "book it." 
Think back to the times in your life when you felt best about yourself and right with God ... they're always parallel. 
Affirm yourself every way you can: no downers. Your God is passionately in love with you. Be more "laid back" and let Him speak to you. Give him time. (And get some extra sleep; you deserve it.)

going to take that chance because we're not going to let anybody turn us around," Hooks stated. 
Hooks urged blacks to take advantage of any educational opportunities available to them. However, he warned blacks not to concentrate on black studies. ''Why go to college to learn 
how to live in the ghetto?'' Hooks queried, continuing, ''I am in favor of black studies, but we should learn physics, math­ematics and philosophy.'' He said that education would en­able the blacks to "master the intricacies of our nation.'' 
Hooks proceeded to reaffirm the blacks' position in the nation and among other races. "I'm not better than any man, but neither am I inferior to any man who walks the face of this earth," he claimed. 
To conclude his lecture, Hooks demanded that America recognize the accomplishments 
of  blacks  in  America  and  
blacks'  contribution  to  
America's development.

Bengal Bouts open up as 
31 claim wins 
by-Craig Chval Sports Writer 
The 49th Annual Bengal Bouts kicked off Sunday after­noon in front of 2,476 fans in the ACC. Yesterday's act-ion was the quarterfinal round of the event, which will continue Thursday evening. There were 31 bouts in all, highlighted by three knockouts and three TKO's. 
The 157-pound division pro­vided the most action of the day, as Tom McCabe registered a TKO over Joe (Sugarbear) Gill at 0:28 of the third round. The left-handed McCabe used· his superior reach, connecting with several lefts to Gill's head. Gill refused to back down, however, and hulled his way inside, but McCabe was able to prevent any major damage... McCabe finished off the bout with a vicious uppercut that straightened Gill up. 
The next bout matched Pete DeCelles, a returning finalist, against Andrew Rukavina. Rukavina took the initiative at the opening bell, but De Celles connected with a thundering
