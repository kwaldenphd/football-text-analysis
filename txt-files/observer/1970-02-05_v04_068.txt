The Mardi Gras Committee faces an uphill financial battle. There is a loss from last year's Mardi Gras of roughly $7500 and a goal of $30,000 was set for this year's gift to charity. With not quite $15,000 now collected, it does not seem likely that the weekend will hit its financial goal.

Though there have been rumors that the big weekend would be cancelled next year, only the raffle seems at this point in danger of getting the axe. "If anything goes, that (the raffle) would be the first to go," said Vecchi. The raffle is the single most costly item in the Mardi Gras program, this year's prize list costing $11,500. Vecchi felt that the man hours and the money are "simply not worth a program that only breaks even." The raffle would be retained,

According to Hesburgh, no report on the status of the finan­cial search has been submitted to him as of the time of the inter­view, but "one lady did give me five dollars," for the cause. 
Hesburgh refused to criticize President Nixon's Supreme Court choices, saying that "al­though I may disagree with a few," he believed that the choices were made out of the President's "sincere and genu­ine" convictions.

FOUNDED NOVEMBER 3, 1966 NOTRE DAME, INDIANA 

University Forum 
The University Forum embarks on its maiden voyage tomorrow and whether or not we reach the promised land depends a lot on the foresight of its participants. 
The potential of the ·group. is unlimited. Made up of every segment of the community, alumni, trustees, faculty, graduate students, and administrators, the Forum will provide ample opportunity for each of them to express their feelings about the direction that they feel Notre Dame should be headed. The Forum will also provide a tremendous opportunity for all members of the community to confront our leaders about the serious issues that face Notre Dame. 
There is much talk these days about the generation gap. Most people say that it results because of a lack of communication. The communication gap in turn is blamed for a myriad of evils. The Forum is a valuable step in trying to bridge the gap here at Notre Dame. 
We hope that the participants of all groups will be honest about their feelings. The Forum should be no place for politics. Politics may have a place in organs such as the Student Senate or the Student Life Council since many compromises must be made in order to assure the passage of bills in a form that will be acceptable to all parties. What should be sought for in the Forum however is an airing of the true feelings of all groups of the community about campus issues. Notre Dame is a university community and perhaps if all sides of an issue are brought forth at a time when all segments can hear and discuss them we can reach intelligent rational conclusions, free of emotions, about the best course that should be pursued. 
To argue that a frank presentation of all sides of the coin will produce unaminity about the course of action may be an exercise in unproductive wishful thinking-but if the idea can work anywhere, it can work at Notre Dame. There is a peculiarity about Notre Dame that doesn't exist elsewhere. We talk of community while other colleges talk of student power. We talk of the Christian value of the non-violent resolution of conflict while other schools talk of non-violence as a power tactic. When the war or the military-industrial complex is questioned the discussion has its basis in Christianity and the value of love. More than anything it is that unique spirit which will be responsible for making the University Forum work. 
In the end, success depends on the attitudes of the participants. If all are open to the various points of view, if they are willing to talk rationally with one another then the Forum will be on its way to becoming an important part of Notre Dame. 
Success hinges too on the degree to which the rest of the community is willing to work through the Forum. The discussions are open to everyone and we hope that people who feel that there are issues to raise will raise them in an arena that is less volatile than we are normally used to. 
But the journey can not end with mere discussion. The participants must have the zeal to follow up on their deliberations, to work for the improvements that need to be made. All too often the "communication gap" is a term applied in situations where discussions are held and the people in power go back to their rooms and close the door. Actions should follow up words-that is the basis for progress. We hope that the Forum members ha\ ~ the foresight to realize that.

Letter 
Open Letter to the Notre 
Dame Community: 
From time to time it is 
necessary to make some very 
basic changes in the structure of 
a university community. Such 
was the case in 1967 when Notre 
Dame moved to create a 
governing board with equal 
priest and lay representation (ie. 
"the Fellows of Notre Dame"), 
and also to give the newly 
organized "Board of Trustees" 
full control of the University. 
Out letter is concerned with an 
equally significant alteration: 
the creation of the post of 
Chancellor. 
Admittedly the two features most heavily emphasized in the education of a "Notre Dame man" are community and the subsequent creative dialogue: 
A Notre Dame student's energies are motivated by new attitudes acquired through the constant interplay of personalities in the Notre Dame community ... Notre Dame is a ·community of shcolars. The accent here is on community -a group of people bound 
together by common aims, 
working together in thecommon pursuit of their objective ... The important attitude characteristic of the academic community at .Notre Dame is creative dialogue. -Information for Undergraduates 1970-71 
It is on the basis of these university commitments that we find it necessary to seek the establishment of a chancellor-president structure at Notre Dame. As we view the years we have been associated with Notre Dame, it is clear that our President is more a member of the International community than our own: 
From the beginning of his career, Hesburgh has made a remarkable impression on the Establishment. Beginning with the National Science Foundation, Hesburgh began getting invitations to sit on the board and act as adviser to more and more of America's most powerful private foundations and Government commissions. Hr accepted them with an appetite which can only be described as voracious. He is director of the Institute of lnterantional education, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, and the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship corporation. A member of the 
U.S. Commission on czvu Rights, he recently accepted the chairmanship of this controversial and time consuming body. This is only a partial listing of the 30 boards and ommissions to which hf donates his time and energy. Hesburgh sees it as a unique opportunity to broaden himself and, through him, the university, "You don't find out where the action is by staying at home." . . . By his own personal estimate Hesburgh donates about 100 days a year to government and/or foundation service, and spends perhaps another 40 or 50 days on the road asking Notre Dame alumni to keep their checkbooks open. -New York Times Magazine, S-11-69 
To spend half of the school year away from Notre Dame is the life-style of the most vital 
link  in  our  academic  
community.  This  situation  is  
lamentable  from  both  sides,  
Father  Ted's  and  the  

community. Nevertheless, it is apparent that extended and frequent absence from the university community makes it difficult indeed to carry on any sort of creative dialogue. 
Clearly we do not intend to degrade the activities of our current President in the name of Not~e Dame. We realize and appreciate these accomplish­ments and their value. 
with this understanding, we are actively seeking the creation of the post of chancellor, to which Father Hesburgh would be elevated. Broadly speaking his activities and duties would remain the same, with one exception: he would no longer be required to deal with matters of strictly internal concern. The President, then, would be an officer actively and constantly within the community. 
It is our most considered opinion that Willis D. Nutting would best serve in such a capacity. Given his personal commitment to Notre Dame and his educational background as a whole one can easily appreciate the type of reform we are seeking in regard to the structure of the University of Notre Dame as a ommunity of scholars. 
To strive for the ideal community is the goal of Notre Dame, it is our goal as well. 
Peace, 
Nutting for President Headquarters

Nash vi lie roots and California bloodlines 
by Michael Kelly John Stewart has been around for a long !)me. A few might recall him as the fellow who replaced Dave Guard in· the Kingston Trio when Guard, tiring of the Trio's commerciality, quit to form the highly unsuccessful Whiskeyhill Sing­ers. Those who were Trio fans will re­member that he wrote quite a few songs for the Trio that never really caught fire and was the member with the keen, 
"Had I been born in New York City, a New York City girl I'd know. Working in the concrete, not the sunlight. Living in that New York rain and snow. 
There's California bloodlines in my heart and a California woman in my song. There's California bloodlines in my heart and a California heartbeat in my soul. 
And just to think I might have never known you if I had lived my life in Tennessee ... " 
A song like Missouri Birds could well become a classic for that very reason. In that song he is singing to a girl, who I am certain didn't wait for him to return. 
"Missouri birds, flying over old St. Louis. Hear that song they're singing to me? Go into the world while you're young.

The Observer obtained per­mission from MacManus, John & Adams, Inc., a national advertis­ing agency, to reprint this mess­age. It first appeared in the December 12 issue of Time mag­azine as a part of an experiment in communication sponsored by Time. 
(According to MJ&A, the message so effectively captured the mood of the nation, that there has been a flood of re­quests for the ad.) 
"We are very pleased with the success of this ad," said Charles 
F. Adams, president of MacMan­us, John & Adams, Inc. "It was part of an experiment in com­munication sponsored by Time magazine. Time asked a group of agencies to turn their creative energy loose on any topic at all ... except a product. We enjoy­ed the challenge." 
Requests for reprints started coming in the day the ad appear­ed. By the day after publication, MJ&A's proofing run had been extended to 10,000. People from all walks of life, from all cross the country, including Can­ada, responded. Universities, schools, students and teachers were particularly responsive. 
The curious thing about the MJ&A ad was that it solicited no inquiries, had no call to action, ran no coupon, didn't exen in­clude the agency's address. All it did was touch a nerve. 
MJ&A Bloomfield Hills Crea­tive Director Ron Monchak de­cided to write an ad about America that would tell it like it is. Monchak's words hit home. Art Director Elaine Ohno's sim­ple handling of the words, in her own handwriting, brought them into an even more personal fo­cus. 
Asked how he happened to 
write the ad the way he did, 
Monchak said, "Quite frankly, I 
don't know. I just wrote it the 
way I felt."

the assembled national direct­orate for the United States Nat­ional Student Association in 
Washington on the problem. The directors unanimously endorsed the organization, and promised aid and support. 
An ambitious publicity cam­paign is being mounted, in an effort to enlist the largest a­mount possible of aid and mon­ey. Letters are being sent to over 1400 college newspapers across the nation asking for full page advertisements to be run in an effort to solicit support. 
In addition, Hamilton talked with the heads of the news departments of UPI, AP, West­inghouse Broadcast System, and various TV and radio stations, including WNDU for both pub­licity in the form of advertise­mentnts and news coverage. All

The advertisement sent out to the college papers is in the form of a poster. It pictures two Biafran children, and headlines the fact that "The War is over but Biafra is losing 5,000 lives a day." 
The poster appeals for people to contact the President and their congressmen to put more pressure on Nigeria to supply more food to the area. It also appeals for funds for food sup­plies for the Biafrans. 
"We sent out those posters with two points in mind. The first is to urge people to write the President and their con­gressmen to put pressure on Ni­geria. We feel that there is a lot more people could do in this area. 
"The second point is to ap­peal for funds," Hamilton ex­plained. "At the moment there are only two organizations through which we can funnel these funds, one is the Nigerian

Hamilton said that they have 
been getting some static from people for sending money through the Nigerian Red Cross, because of its alleged in­efficiency. 
"All I can say to those people, is that the Nigerian Red Cross is getting aid into the area, which no one else is doing," Hamilton stated. 
The students were originally going to work through the Americans for Biafran Relief which is based in New York. After talking with them though, Hamilton changed his mind be­cause he "saw the importance of making this appear as a purely student effort."

Two students are leading a campaign to restructure Notre Dame's administrative frame­work to allow for a Chancellor and a President. St. Mary's jun­ior Karen Grabowski and Notre Dame senior Steve Raymond, along with other students, are suggesting that Rev. Theodore

They are further suggesting that Willis D. Nutting, Asoicate Professor, Emeritus, in the General Program, be anmed to the post vacated by Father Hes­burgh's elevation and have organized Nutting for President lleadq uarters.

restructuring of the administra­tive framework of the University to allow for a Chancellor and a President. 
President Theodore Hesburgh, Chairman of the Board Hdmund 
A.

JIM MURRAY 
-' 

By word of mouth 
~ 1970, Los Angeles Times 
JUNE LAKE-The first thing you have to do to go skiing, is get 
the proper equipment. 
Ordinarily, I go down to Abbey Rents and get just the right 
stuff-one crutch and a surgical cast autographed, "Better Luck Next 
Time-Jean Claude" or "Even the Slopes are Crying-Toni Sailer." A 
"Tough Luck-Robert Redford" can be helpful, too. 
You get only one crutch because hobbling about on one foot can 
be tiring, and, this way, you can switch feet from day to day. One 
crutch gets you just as much sympathy as two and, when 
questioned, you murmur with a sigh, "The tibia-caught it on the 
cornice at Alta. Damn bad show." 
I also load up on plenty. of cigarettes. I don't smoke, but you've 
all seen what happens on TV to this guy, sitting in a chair with a 
busted ankle, waving bravely to his buddies as they go up the T-bar 
in search of spiral fractures of their own. And this exquisite girl 
comes hobbling in and asks him for a cigarette. I usually carry a 
carton in case this happens to me. 
If some wise guy happens to notice you've got one foot in the air 
one day and the other foot the next, just look at him scornfully and 
say, "Don't you think I KNOW which tibia it is?" The only trouble 
is, the rest of the stay, DON'T switch feet. 
The crutch also permits you to, as the British say, "Jump the 
queue" at the chairlift. Nobody would keep an injured man standing 
in line, particularly if you smiled this wan little smile and say, "No, 
no, that's all right, I'm quite used to it. They've got the bone set 
temporarily and the operation won't be till morning. They think 
they can save the leg." 
But, as you know, I always come to June Mountain a few times a 
year to shake the smog and printer's ink out of my nostrils, and see 
snow on the fir trees and gulp in the air of the gold country of the 
Sierra. 
And, now, they're getting wise to me. I hold the record for hot 
wine consumption by guys on one leg at the June Mountain chalet, 
and, my pals, Dotti and Andy Oldfield at Boulder Lodge, KNOW I 
keep the plaster cast in the trunk of the car because, one day, I had 
to ask them how to spell "Paul Newman" and borrow a pen to write 
it on the toe area. 
So, I decided I would actually get on skis. I had to brazen it out, 
because I had to enroll in the June Mountain beginners' class. So, I 
rented equipment, and showed up and checked in with the young ski 
instructor. 
Now, all ski instructors look as if they should be carrying machine 
guns and chasing Paul Henreid over the Swiss border. I mean, they 
have these boots that look as if they were steam-driven. They got 
more valves and boiler-plate than some locomotives. They look as if 
they have to be put on a lube rack every thousand miles. 
My instructor was no exception: He looked at me coldly as if 1 was something he had just captured in the cellar of a French farmhouse. "Name?" he said coldly. "Murray," I told him. "First name?" he said. "Jean-Claude," I answered. 
"Ever skied before?" he barked. I bridled. "Skied before?!" I snarled. "Listen! I threw the powder so high at Alta meteorologists in six states thought they were tracking a blizzard. I was a forerunner at six Olympics and beat the eventual winner under three clocks. I've FALLEN more than you've skied, son." 
His lip curled in an Erich von Stroheim sneer. "Then, what are you doing in a beginner's class? Do you take me for a fool?" 
I gave him a heartbroken smile. "Listen, Helmut-it is Helmut, isn't it?-I'm phased out for the moment. Amnesia, you know. Got it at Biarritz. The Aly Khan crashed into me. Or maybe it was one of the Kennedys. I forget. It's beginning to come back to me in bits and pieces, but the medics recommend I go back to the beginning." 
I thought I saw a flicker of sympathy cross his face, but it was probably only the sun on his monocle. "Can you snowplow?" he demanded. "Well, yes," I told him, "but I'd rather ski." 
He looked at me strangely. "A 'snowplow' IS a ski maneuver " he instructed me. "Can you remember anything from your r;cing days?" I clasped a hand to my head. "NOW, I remember! Why when I used to come paralleling down the head wall, my skis used to click hke castanets. I was the biggest thing in the Alps since Hannibal's 
elephants!" "Then, take this little run here," Helmut said, indicating a grade 
257. Austin added four free throws, copping game scoring honors with 44, and was the outstanding performer for Notre Dame in the Irish's 135-88 romp past St. Peter's. 
Notre Dame also established four single game team scoring marks last night, steeing a record for points in a game, 135, points in a half, tallying 71 markers in the second stanza the most points scored in a home game, and combined with St. Peter's to set the record for most points scored in a game by both clubs, 223. 
The Irish played superbly, sinking 53.5% of their field goal attempts, passing and running well, and completely dominating the backboards, outrebounding the smaller Peacocks 81-3 2. 
The outcome of the free­wheeling, run-and-shoot contest was decided in the first half as 
the Irish, ahead 18-15 after seven minutes of action, out­scored the Peacocks 7-0 over a three minute stretch to open up a ten-point lead. Carr had three points and Meehan and Jones, a basket each, in the NO surge. 
The Irish lead swung between 12 and 15 points until another Notre Dame streak put the Irish out of reach of the outclassed Peacocks. 
Leading 47-34 with 4:12 to go in the first half, the Irish scored 13 straight points, six by reserve guard Mike O'Connell, to move into a commanding 60-34 lead. The Irish took a 64-38 advantage into the dressing room at halftime. 
The second half was even more wild then the first as both clubs utilized the fast break at every opportunity and shot almost as soon as they could get the ball down the floor. The Irish, despite liberal substitutions by Coach Johnny Dee, continued to get the better of the action and

with a fine team offensive effort poured 71 points through the hoop, building up a SO point lead on several occasions. The Irish cleared the century mark on Austin Carr's bucket with 
8:31 left in the game. 
Carr connected on 20 of 34 shots from the floor, raising his season field goal percentage slightly to .575. In addition to his fantastic shooting, Carr con­tributed 16 rebounds and seven assists. 
Collis Jones was another top NO performer, netting 27 points and hauling down 24 reboudns. Jones' control of the boards negated somewhat the loss of 6-8 center John Pleick due to 
scholastic ineligibility. Pleick 
will be unable to play for the 
rest of the season. 

Three other Irish players scored in double firgures as Doug Gemmell, impressive in his first Convo start, tallied 13 points, and Mike O'Connell and John Gallagher chipped in ten points each. Jim Hinga came off the bench and just missed hitting double figures, finishing the game with nine points. 
Notre Dame's offensive prowess last night was aided by the fact that all ten Irish players who saw action scored at least a pair of baskets.
