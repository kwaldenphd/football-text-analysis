New 24­hour space guidelines 
By HELENA PAYNE 
News Writer · 
Eleven senators attended the Campus Life Council (CLC) meeting to support the approval of a reso­lution to post a policy about 24­hour space in all residence halls Monday. 
"We con­cluded that although a definition of 24-hour space does exist, it still is not abided by in some of the residence halls," said Lewis Hall senator Luciana Reali. "The Senate came up with what we hope to be a solution to this." 
The CLC passed the 24-hour space resolution, which the com­mittee on gender issues of the Student Senate initially drafted, that defines 24-hour space as areas available to the hall resi­dents and their guest for all 24 hours. Students must abide by the rules in duLac and exercise "good judgement." 
The Office of Student Affairs has to approve the resolution in order to implement the policy, but the CLC is going to further address issues about the 24-hour space policy during its next meeting. However, assistant vice president of Residence Life Bill Kirk had positive comments about the poli­cy. 
"I think this is a really well drafted and well thought out reso­lution," said Kirk. "It clearly added something that we're still having a problem with." 
Kirk said that while he does not want to make 24-hour space a "passion pit," it is important to address some of the concerns that student have. 
According to a survey regarding 24-hour space conducted by the Student Senate the majority of the dorms that lack full 24-hour space by the Senate's definition are female dorms. 
"There is a disparity between female and male residence halls," said Reali. 
The most apparent distinction is the presence of hall monitors in female dorms and lack thereof in male dorms. Because the hall monitors leave between 6 and 7 a.m., they have been known to ask male guests to leave the dorm when they do.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Web dependency 
I never really bought into the whole "infor­

mation superhighway" hype about the Internet. 
I always thought the Internet was convenient 
and it was nice to be able to find information 
quickly and easily; I never really thought it was 
very revolutionary. 
Then the Internet went 

away and I learned just 
how much I really rely on 
the Internet. 
When the new college football Associated Press poll came out Sunday after­noon, I was lefl in the dark. I didn't know where the Irish were ranked in the latest poll and what their chances of a Bowl Championship Series were. I had no idea if my beloved Pittsburgh Steelers were winning. But losing the convenience of readily available sports information was the least of my concnrns. 
I couldn't email my parents directions to where to meet me when they come up for the Boston College game this weekend. I was effec­tively cut off from my normal means of commu­nication. 
It got even harder when I started working on Monday's Observer. The email system that lets us communicate and send stories back and forth between the two campuses was useless. Gaining even the most basic information was nearly impossible. Our weather service was cut o!T. We lost our access to national photos and graphics. Everything that made production of a newspaper easy and painless was gone. 
Getting stories back from our political reporters in Washington proved to be nearly impossible. Driving back and forth from South Dining llall to Saint Mary's (where e-mail still worked) as we tried to collect stories and pho­tos from hundreds of miles away. 
A system we rely on to make our everyday life easier was gone and we were left scram­bling to find a new system. 
When the information superhighway broke down Sunday, my life came to a screeching halt. Even finding out information concerning the network breakdown was nearly impossible. 
Want to call other colleges to learn if their networks were functioning? It's a lot harder to find a phone number without Yahoo! 
What about basic business information about Ameritech and the location of its corporate office? It's all on the Internet. 
Not until the information was gone did I real­ize how easy and convenient the Internet makes my life. The usual reliability of the Notre Dame network made it seem unthinkable that the information would even be unavailable. 
For my first two years at Notre Dame, the Internet connection was never a problem. I always had access to the news and information I needed. Now that Internet service has been restored, I just wanted to thank the workers at OIT for bringing the world back to Notre Dame. 
I am sure you all have been under a lot of stress trying to bring the network back up. Thank you for the reliable service you have provided in the past and the reliable service I am sure you will provide in the future. You make everyone's lives a lot easier.

Penn State 'Greens' plan to leave class to vote 
UNIVERSITY PARK. Pa. 
Some Pennsylvania State University students with a flair for the dramatic plan to walk out of classes Tuesday to cast their vote for the next president. 
The move, initiated by the local Green Party organization, the Campus Greens, is bipartisan and encourages people of all political afl1liations to leave class and head to the polls. 
Justin Leto, a student activist, plans to participate in the walkout. Leto said the goal ol' the walkout is to mobilize more students to get out and vote, and to make voting their first priority on Election Day. 
Leto feels that Election Day should be a national holiday, for the entire nation and definitely for Pennsylvania State University. 
"We live in a country where 50 per­

"People should [be able to leave) work or school to concentrate on pick­ing who is going to run the country," 

NORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY 
Law could ease voter registration 
An amendment to the 1998 Higher Education Act should have put voter registration forms at students' fingertips, courtesy of the state. Instead, schools like Northern Illinois University were required to find their own ways to provide forms -and they did. Governor George Ryan decided not to provide the forms to colleges free of charge. Instead. they were offered other options, such as printing their own forms, buying them from a private vendor or asking county clerks to provide them. Though federal law does not require Illinois to provide the forms, the state tries to make them easier to obtain. But schools ultimately are responsible for providing reg­is tr a ti on forms to students. "If they have not requested forms from the state prior to 60 days before the election. they're subject to financial penalties from the federal government," said David Ormsby, spokesman for State Representative Lou Lang, D-Skokie. If a school requested the forms and was denied, it's not held responsible, he added.

Leto said. "Since Election Day is so close with Veterans Day, they could mingle the two together and tiP in that this is what vets fought for." 
At the Centre County Democratic Committee's headquarters, the feel­ings about a student walkout are mixed. 
"We certainly think voting is a grnat idea. Boycotting classes is never a good thing, although it can be fun. Sometimes it's important to make a dramatic statement." said Bob Shepherd, Centre County Gore 2000 chair. 
Shepherd, however, doesn't neces­sarily think the day should be a national holiday. 
"ft doesn't take very long to vote, and the polls arc open for 13 hours," he said. 
NEW YORK UNIVERSITY 
Grad students seek to form union 
Should the results of April's Graduate Assistants Union election -which were sealed pending last week's National Labor Relations Board decision -be in favor of a GA union, New York University's only two options would be to bargain with the union or refuse to bargain and push the case into federal court. In the wake of the decision, which gives NYU graduate teaching assistants the green light to form union, university officials say they are deciding what their next step will be. NLBR decisions cannot be directly appealed to federal court. The only way the NYU case could be heard by a Circuit Court judge would be for the university to refuse to bargain. forc­ing the union to file a grievance with the NLRB. Should the Board determine .NYU refused to bargain, it would order the university to negotiate. If it still refused, the Board could take the University to court in an effort to compel it to bargain. NYU could also take the Board to court, asking a federal judge to review the Board's order to bargain.

"I think that everyone knows that some couples monopolize the space by just hanging out." said Kirk. 
However, Kirk said that the 24-hour space policy would at least make it clear for the moni­tors that they must allow the space to be available to resi­dents and their guests for all 24 hours. He said that within a few years the posted policy wouldn't be necessary because everyone would be familiar with it by then.

Inmates protest Albanian prisons 
Associated Press 

YUGOSLAVIA 
Police stormed a state prison late Monday, trying to contain a riot that began as a hunger strike but grew out of hand as Serbian inmates burned their cells and took to rooftops demanding short­ened se·ntences and new management. 
Shouts of "Get him" and "flit him" could be heard outside the prison as police moved into the compound, minutes after guards !ired tear gas and what appeared to be warning shots to try to break up the spreading riot. Police later withdrew, but remained deployed outside the prison compound. 
The unrest in the south­ern city of Nis started as a protest in solidarity for other Serbian inmates in the northern town of Sremska Mitrovica. Those inmates began rioting late Sunday, alleging that they were beaten "like horses" and demanding they share in a proposed amnesty for ethnic Albanian prisoners from Kosovo.

Students 'abroad' in DC experience elections firsthand

WASIIINGTON, DC 
athleen Jordan spends her 
Sunday mornings in a cold 
television studio. 
As a participant in Notre Dame's Semester in Washington, IJ.C., she interns three days a week. Whoo her fellow classmates back in Indiana arc sleeping in Sunday morning, Jordan is meeting peo­ple like John McCain and Jesse Jackson for NBC's "Meet the Press." 
The political talk show is wlwrn Jordan has met political celebrities and policy-makers alike and where she says she loves to work. 
Notre Dame's Washington semester currently boasts 11 participan ls, an unexpectedly low number this semester. said Peri Arnold. director of the pro­gram. The students live in an apartment owned by Boston University and shared with schools like Dartmouth, Michigan State and the University of Pennsylvania. 
The program in D.C. is a bit like night school for adults already in the workforce. Students intern Monday to Wednesday, taking some night classes starting when they return from work until 9:30 p.m. They attend one class Thursday and Fridays can be filled with day trips to museums. monu­ments and legislative ofTices.

"It's the perfect way to get involved," he said. "It's the per­fect door to what I want to do." 
Fallon's office is currently working on initiatives to increase public school construc­tion funding, a project Fallon is playing an important role in. Ile is due to submit a report at the end of the month regarding funding research and meetings on the NAACP's progress in gaining support of the project. 
When the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal occurred, Washington interns instantly gained a bad reputation. Notre Dame students. though, are working at a scandal-free time and have only positive things to say about interning in the nation's capital. 
And although he had heard that working for a congressman would be difficult and monoto­nous, junior Bill Fusz has had no problems adjusting to life as a congressional intern. 
"The Hill is where the action is," said Fusz, who works in Congressman Paul Gillmor's (R­OI I} olTice. 
In an ollice about the size of a regular O'Shaughnessy class­room, Fusz works with Gillmor's legislative aides on mostly con­stituent issues.

The connection between Washington's big-city politics and how they affect the American public is something many Notre Dame students arc learning this semester. 
"l see on a daily basis how local and national issues con­geal," said Kate Caballero, a junior interning for Congressman Jim Davis (D-FL). 
As the sole intern in the con­gressional office, Caballero is given greater responsibilities than possibly someone working with several other interns. 
She conducts bill initiative research and attends weekly staff meetings where, she said, "my opinion counts." Caballero said Davis doesn't propose many bills, so her participation in their development is especially impor­tant. 
And while meeting people like Bill Clinton and Democratic presidential ticket Al Gore and Joe Lieberman is a perk to her job, Caballero's favorite part of her job is the help she's getting in developing her future political goals. 
Fallon said participating in the 
D.C. program has also helpPd sharpen his focus on his future. 
Some of the students. in fact, are hoping their stints as Notre Dame interns in D.C. will lead them to positions as Notre Dame alumni in D.C. 
For William Nordwind, '89, working for his hometown con­
gressman was an offer he couldn't refuse. 
The government and intrrna­tional studies graduate settled into an aide position in Congressman Fred Upton's (O­M!) office al'ter a few years of working with another congress­woman. When a position opened to work for his home state rep­resentative, he said he couldn't pass it up. 
He said he enjoys his position working in a fast-paced city like Washington while remaining "plugged to the home fires" of his native Michigan. 
For Caballero, too, the flames of the "home fires" burn too bright to resist. 
The junior government major is interning with Democratic Congressman Jim Davis who serves Florida's Tampa area dis­trict. where Caballero lives. She says she relishes the chance to work with people concerned with her hometown issues. 
"[ would love to be a congress­woman one day," she added, noting that working in Davis' office has done wonders in developing her ambition. 
"!Davis] has done a lot for me," said Caballero who said the congressman is very open to helping with her political future. 
"Notre Dame gave me an excellent grounding to do this job," said Ted Brennan, press secretary and legislative director for Congressman Cass Ballenger (R-NC). 

His Notre Dame education, he said, was a "pretty good foun­dation" for working in Washington, D.C., and prepared him for a future political career of his own. 
Brennan hopes to one day run for local office or a representa­tive position and likens his job to "basic training in the mili­tary," preparing him for the leadership responsibilities he wants to one day hold. 
And although, he said "you're never going to be rich in public service," his job is rewarding in many other ways, such as knowing more about what's happening in Congress than most journalists reporting its news. 
"With electronic n111dia, things move so fast around here. You can live and die by the minute," Brennan said, noting that the congressman's office received nearly 1,400 constituent e-mails this past weekend. 
Jordan, who wants to be a broadcast journalist upon grad­uation, says working for NBC has taught her "the ins and outs of putting a television show together." She said the bchind­the-scenes experience has helped her realize the high­intensity and stress behind national television. 
She said her experience in the program has strengthened her desire to join the field.

who did not vote this year. "It's too much of a hassle for me when it's not going to change anything." 
Although his objections are main­ly with the Electoral College. which determines the presidential elec­tion, Lambrecht did not vote in any of the other races being decided in his home state of Minnesota this year. 
'Tm not knowledgeable about state and city [candidates!." he said. 
People in this age group may also feel that it does not matter who is in office. 
'Tm in college, so it's not really going to affect me," said Wilkerson. "I don't think either candidate will really accomplish anything." 
Wilkerson added that his decision not to vote applies only to this elec­tion. 
Of course. there are members of Wilkerson and Lambrecht's age group that believe it is important to vote in all elections. 
The people in the White House do affect the lives of college students. according to senior Megan Conlon. She is currently taking a design class taught by visiting assistant art professor Robert Sedlack that cre­ated posters and buttons to encour­age Notre Dame students to vote. 
"People simply don't think their votes are going to matter in the long run," Conlon said. "Every vote does matter, and certainly as a group, our vote matters ... We all need to be active as an age group in the political process." 
"I think people here are really excited because it's the lirsl t1lec­tion anyone here can vote in," said senior Jeni Harms, academic divi­sion head of Notre Dame student government. "Part or being a responsible citizen is voting ... It's a duty." 
Harms said that some students find getting an absentee ballot to be a hassle. 
Project

"political family." 

·In 1996, only 32 percent of young American adults bothered to vote. Among the general population, voter turnout was 50 percent. 
"We have the worst voter turnout," said senior Megan Conlon. one of Sedlack's students. "I think t_hat prob­lem needs to be taken seriously." 
So Sedlack and his class created a project to address the issue. 
The first phase of the project involved creating a poster. Students created sev­eral designs, and then the class cri­tiqued each one -along with graduate graphic design students and non-art or design majors from student govern­ment. 
The poster the group selected to print and display around campus reads. "68% of 18 to 24 year olds do not vote in their federal elections. 68% of this poster is a WASTE OF SPACE. What win you be this year on Tuesday, November 7th'? Fill the void." 
With the help of Adworks, Notre Dame's student advertising agency, the class printed and hung over 200 posters around campus. 
With the large amount of white space on the poster, some people have found room to write messages of their own oh the posters. 
"We know it's getting attention when it's getting graffiti," Sedlack said. 
to the class's own Web site that has additional voter information. 
The class also designed ads to appear in The Observer. The project received free ad space from newspaper, as well as funding from the College Republicans and College Democrats, though Sedlack stressed that it was a non-partisan cam­
paign. 

In addition to "We have the worst voter 
posters, the class decided to incorpo­rate other elements into their project as well. 
Students designed three different but­tons and produced 200 of them. The class distributed the 
turnout. I think that problem needs to be taken seriously. "

pins to other students who promised to display them on clothing or backpacks. 
The class also designed table tents to be displayed this week in the dining halls. Adworks helped the class to actu­ally distribute these tents. 
In addition, the class designed a graphic for the homepage of Notre Dame's Web site. The site offers a link 
While he wants the posters send a message to the entire Notre Dame student body, Sedlack said the pro­ject also gave his stu­dents a chance to see how their designs can play an influential role in informing the public. 
"I hoped that it even moved just one per­son," Conlon said. She 
added that she hopes getting her peers to vote now will get them in the habit of voting, so they will continue to do so throughout their lives. 
"You've got a say. You can affect the outcome of elections," said Sedlack. "Ignorance and apathy are not the answer."

Surgeons operated Monday tu separate conjoined twin girls in a long and complex procedure that doctors said would kill one baby Lo give her sister a chance of a normal lifo. The operation followed months of legal wran­gling over whether the parents could refuse surgery and let nature take its course. 
St. Mary's Hospital in Manchester confirmed early Monday that the operation ­involving some 20 staff mem­bers -had begun and was expected to take up to 15 hours. The hospital said no details about the surgery's out­come would be released until lunchtime Tuesday. 
The girls, identified publicly only as "Mary" and "Jodie," were born at the hospital on Aug. 8 joined at the lower abdomen. Doctors say surgery 
The twins' parents -identi­fied only as Roman Catholics from the Maltese island of' Gozo in the Mediterranean ­opposed the operation for reli­gious reasons but decided not to contest a Sept. 22 decision by the Court of Appeal that the girls can be separated. 
The court had struggled with the issue of whether the surgery would amount to inten­tionally killing Mary, whose heart and lungs cannot sustain life. Two medical specialists appointed by the court endorsed surge_ry. 
"The sad fact is that Mary lives on borrowed time, all of it borrowed from her sister," Lord Justice Alan Ward said in the Court of Appeal ruling. "She is incapable of independent existence. She is designated for death."

The Times of London report­ed that the Maltese Pediatric Association had urged British doctors to delay the operation, saying it violated common prac­tice that parents of severely disabled babies were given the linal say over treatment. 
"In this case the parents have clearly expressed the wish that nature be left to take its course," it was quoted as say­ing.

Abolish Electoral College 
With one of the closest presidenlial elec;tions in history com­ing to a close today. there is a chance a candidate who wins the popular vole will lose the Electoral College. The EleGtoral College is an outdated system that reduces the presidential election to a struggle for a few battleground states while most of the country is ignored by the candidates.

Under the present system. each citizen's v.otc is worth a dif­ferent fraction or an electoral vote based on the state's number of electoral votes and voter turnout. Every man and woman should cast a vote ofequal worth. A vote in one state should not count more than a vote in another state.

on the part of the men who wrote the Constitution to provide for the election of trusted representatives who could learn about the candidates and cast a well-advised electoral vote for their states. 
But in modern America. the limitations that originally made the Electoral College a necessity no longer exist. With the development of airplanes, television and the Internet. each citi­zen now has an ample opportunity to familiarize himself or herself with the personalities and positions of the candidates. With this information. citizens no longer need to depend on electors to make this decision for them. 
Concerns about the right of each state to equal representa­tion in the electoral process are no longer relevant in modern 
Electoral College votes no matter how close 
the election might have been. 
The Constitution gives the state legislatures the power to determine the rules governing the Electors from each state. There can be 50 dilTerent sots of rules for electing a president. A national election should have a national set ofrules. 
There ls no longer any reason for America to continue to choose it-; President through an Electoral College. Instead, the basic rules of equality dictate that each citizen·s vote should be of equal value. This can only be achieved through direct popu­lar election of the President. The United States should elimi­nate the Electoral College and allow the people to directly choose their leader.

Ok, so that is a lie. I have very little to Growing Up to no knowledge of Be a Kid computers. Compute.rs and I, well, we are not one. And I am OK with that. I have mastered e-mail (though I do not get this "sending attachments" thing; it's cut and paste all the way). I know how to surf the web, and I know how to use all sorts of word processing pro­grams for typing papers. So I guess I'm not completely illiterate, computer-wise. But I'm pretty sure some of the three and four-year-olds I know understand the inner workings of most Macs and PCs better than I ever will. 
I question whether or not this is a good thing. however. I've noticed that home computers these days are comparable to what cable television was when I was growing up. Time in front of it was limit­ed, lest I ruin my eyes and my brain turn to mush, according to my parents. There is something about today's Internet, and comput!>rs in general, that. like cable television. sucks us in, keeping us indoors like vampires hiding from sun­light.

The age ofinfo technology astounds me, really. Who came up with this stuff! We know Al Gore didn't and Bill Gates only sc'lls it, so I'm going with a Big Bang Theory. It had to have been that one day a dude was sitting at his computer and BANG! his computer slapped him upside the head and yelled, "Use me for some­thing other than typing papers and bal­ancing your checkbook!" Or something to that extent. Hence. the world is now con­nected through phone wires, modems. networks and all that otherstuIT. And it lets us into a variable world or all sorts of stuff.

Just like l didn't stop myself from watching the show Double Dare when I should have been memorizing the Act of Contrition. 
If I had to choose between television and 500 cable channels and the Internet and five million websites, I would choose television. Because I know how to work it. I even know how to program a VCH! With computers, it is another story. I think my lack of loving for the digital age stems from a deep-rooted !ear of those kevboards and hard drives and monitors that tend 1.o go ha)'Wirc on me at the most inopportune moments. Usually the moments involve a very long paper due in four hours that for some reason has been saved neither on disk nor hard drive. I cannot explain it and frankly, I am not going to try. 
I have, however, found a couple of tricks that seem to work. which I will be happy to pass on. If you, too, suffer from computer No-I low, try these helpful hints and see what happens. though I'm not going to guarantee you anything: 
. Whaternr you do, do not hit or slap the computer in any way, shape or form. I've found things will start flashing all over the monitor. which is a sign your computer is getting very angry and that is never a good thing.

Never neglect the printer. It needs words of kindness as well and trust me. it will act up just as much. if not more. than the computer. Treat them as your parents treated you and your siblings: with equal love and attention (1wcn if they did like you better than the otlrnr ones).

Everyone likes treats and computers arc no exceptions. Bring your computer a new treat, whether it is a faster con­nection or a new batch of cloths to wipe the dust off with. Maybe if you brought brownif\S that would make your comput­er oblige. I've found it works with some of my friends.

/\nlhropolgy

aI' ages, well-known entrepre­neurs, successful figures in the business world, communitv leaders from the local and. national levels. representatives of the religious order and eager students. The gathering was in honor of the "2000 Young Leader Award Recipient for Exemplary Leadership in Chicago." The young man acclaimed as this year's model for leadership is Patrick G. Byan Jr., Founder and President of the Inner-City Teaching Corps (ICTC); an urban teaching pro­gram similar to the Peace Corps. 
One by one, representatives of the Leadership Council approached the podium and proceeded to rellect on the award and on Patrick. He received acclaims for his integri­ty, accolades for his accomplish­ments, adulation for his heart and approbation for his guts. One friend noted how effortless­ly Patrick managed Jo integrate all of his disparate interests into his life so that not one cause in which he believed had to wait its turn. She added that in addition. through it all Patrick kept in touch -with everyone. He never forgot a name or a face. 
. One woukl think after hearing this endless list of praises that here was a man who. must real­ize his exceptional qualities and thus. must have a slight ego. Yet, when he stepped to the microphone to accept the av\·ard. Patrick stood comfort­ably in the front of the room and after expressing gratitude began his speech that assured his audi­ence this award was not about him. "Don't mistake the match for the lire," he said. 
Patrick's words quickly changed the lone of the night. Patrick was able to deftly redi­rect the spotlight from him self onto the current teachers of the ICTC program who quietly but proudly sat in the back wearing symbolic green carnations. Patrick's passionate pleas for better education in America echoed through the room caus­ing many eyes to brim with tears. He declared that "parents should not have to pretend to live in another city just so that they can provide quality educa­tion for their children." 
Patrick then proliled one spe­cific teacher by way of showing how much these young people sacri!ice when they join the ICTC. He added that onlv one out of every six applican.ts is accepted into lhe program. And 96 pPrcent of the tPachers an' from the most elite schools in the nation, such as Notre Dame. Harvard. Yale and Princeton. Given these figures, Patrick said. "many outsiders pose the ulti­mate question ... why?" 
"\,Vhy are the most intelligent students f'rom the best schools choosing to commit two years of their lives to service, earning only $5 a day plus room and board?" Patrick asked. Certainly for the first year. the rewards arc few and the chal­lenges are many but graduating students slilljump at the chance to teach.

dent straight to the hands of big business­es in Chicago where most ND graduates flock together to embark on a fifth year of Notre Dame. 
Still. though the call seems tough, there are many that confidently march forward on the path of service, never looking back. Those who pursue the Alliance for Catholic Education are prime examples. 
Similar in structure to !Cl'C, ACE. is in the words of senior Tara Mahnesmith "just awe­some." Tara has worked for thn otnce for two years now and over time developed the utmost respect for its people. "These people are some of the most amazing you will ever meet," she says. Tara was so decided on ACE that she spent her fall break visiting one of'the sites, shadowing one of its teachers. Tara returned with an even greater appreciation for the pro­gram. She is certain that not only do the teachers make an impact in a way that will change children's lives, but thev also find their own lives forever enhanced. 

Service after college just might be the best thing you'll ever do. What better time to sacrifice 
monetary privileges than right after college when we are all used to living at college pov.erty level? Don't rush the corporate world, sooner or later you'll get tired of it. Service in the 
form of teaching is even better. Our future is still behind 
the doors of grade schools and that will never change. 
As for freshmen, sophomores and juniors, this phi­
losophy applies to you too. Don't ever think you 
are too busy for service. One of my favorite 
classes was "Confronting Homelessness in 
_ American 
r 
Society" taught by Professor Ben Giamo. No 
, 
amount of book --reading could _ 
replace the lessons I learned from the experimen­tial portion of the course. In 
fact, in my opin­ion "Confronting Homelessness" 
should be a 
-required part of the curriculum. just like Theology 
and Philosophy. Indeed, as Patrick's adopted motto for ICTC states "You can't just talk the talk; you must also walk the walk" Patrick has, and continues to set the pace.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


Congratulating Mr. Notre Dame 
Last Thursday, between 800 and 1,000 students attended the first ever Mr. Notre Dame pageant. The winner, freshman Ryan Crochet of Keenan Hall. put on a show for the ages. His talent was a Chippendale-style dance to the Divinyls "I Touch Myself' that had the audience on their feet both cheering and laughing at the same time. By the end of it. he was in black tights and a red bow-tie. Let me not forget one important fac­tor; he's about 300 pounds. The other finalists were quite good, but the night was stolen by Big Ryan as he charmed the ladies during the question and answer section. We've anxious­ly awaited The Observer's take on the pageant, but since no article as of yet has been printed, we at Keenan Hall would like to give him some well-deserved press. Congratulations to the big fella and we can't wait for a repeat performance next year.

seconds, Verlin also claimed first in the 200-yard butterfly in 1 :55.71. 
Four swimmers were individual event winners for the Irish. Freshman Matt Oberlin had a key performance for the Irish, capturing the 200-meter individ­ual medley in 2:03.12. Freshman J.R. Teddy put another Irish first place on the board in the 400-meter freestyle, finishing in 3:48.04. Senior Dan Szilier clinched the first place finish in the 200-meter breastroke in 2:12.08, and junior David Horak took the 200-rneter backstroke in 1 :55.28. 
Friday's meet was a different story, with the Irish lagging behind Oakland University, capturing only five of 15 events. There were some bright spots for the Irish, however, especially in the distance events. 
Junior Jonathan Pierce clinched vic­tories in the 1.650-yard freestyle in 16:00.45, and in the 500 freestyle in 
4:40.99. Sophomore diver Andy Maggio kept the divers undefeated in dual meet action, winning both the one and three meter board events. Szilier took first in the 200 breastroke in 2:07 .02. 
But the middle part of the meet was the crunch, where the Irish found themselves falling to Oakland's sprint­ing forces, dropping both the 50-and 100-yard freestyles. 
"This is just going to be a year where we just have to keep working on sprint­ing," said head coach Tim Welsh. "But our times were better this time. We're making progress, but we're not done," he said. 
The Irish now take a break from 

competition, not returning to the com­
petitive scene until the Notre Dame 
Invitational. Nov.31 through Dec.3. The 
hiatus gives the team the opportunity 
to prepare well, Welsh said. 
"This gives us a couple of weeks of very intense preparation," Welsh said. "We are only going to be as good as our level of improvement -this break is to our advantage."

ERNESTO LACAYO/The Observer Marcie Bomhack (left) talks with her teammates in between a point during a match earlier. this season. 
Special to The Observer 
Junior outside_ hitter Marcie Bomhack was named the Big East Player of the Week on Monday, Nov. 6, for her perfor­mance in three Notre Dame vic­tories last week. 
Bomhack was instrumental in the three Irish sweeps over Boston College, North Carolina and Providence, pushing the Notre Dame 2000 season record

llis coach compares him favorably to Joe Montana. While that might be prema­ture, Denver Broncos quar­terback Brian Griese, in only his second full season as a starter, is putting up Montana-like numbers. 
Never was that more apparent than in the Broncos' 30-23 victory over the Ne.w York Jets on Sunday. 
Griese was outstanding, completing 22 of 35 passes for 327 yards with two touch­downs and one interception. 
Hut on third down -a la Montana -he was other­worldly. 
In those critical situations. Griese was 13-for-16 for 225 yards and two scores. lie accounted for 12 first downs, and his third-down passer rating was 158.3 -the maxi­mum rating possible. 
For the year, Griese leads the i\FC and is second in the 
Obviously a proud papa, the elder Griese, who became emotional while doing televi­sion commentary on his son's Michigan team in the nation­al championship game in 1997, prefers to let his son's career stand on its own. 
Contacted at his Miami home on Monday. Griese said, "I really don't want to comment. He's got his own career going there." 
i\nd what a career it has become! 
Emerging from the long shadow of John Elway, whom he succeeded as the Broncos' quarterback in 1999, Griese is quickly making his own imprint. 
In a day-after assessment of the win over the Jets, coach Mike Shanahan said, "It's hard for a quarterback to play much better than he played. especially in that environment, in those condi­tions, against an excellent def'ensive football team.

Drained Ross resigns as Lions' head coach 
Associated Pre 
PONTIAC. Mich. 

The Detroit Lions replaced a burned-out coach with one who wore out his welcome less than 70 miles away. 
H o  b b y  
Hoss,  men­ 
tally  and  

physically 
drained 
after 3 1/2 years. resigned Monday and was replaced by assistant coach Gary Moeller. who was fired as Michigan's coach in 1995 davs after his arrest dur­ing a disturbance at a Detroit­area restaurant. 
"I really think I can put less prnssurc 011 myself," Moeller said Monday after signing a three-year contract. "But I'm not sure, yrrn know what I mean'? You get into it. things starl lo tighten and the screws start lo tighten. 
"This honeymoon is going to end tomorrow, probably in two or three hours. I think I can deal with that and deal thor­oughly with it." 
Hoss' resignation is the third coaching change in the NFL this season. but it's the first with a team that is having a relatively successful season. ' 
The Lions arc 5-4 and have a chance lo earn a playoff berth. 
Two weeks ago. Arizona tired Vince Tobin and replaced him with Dave McGinnis. On Sept. 25, Bruce Coslet resigned in Cincinnati and was replaced by Dick LeBeau. 
Ross has one year remaining on his live-year contract with the Lions. Vice president Chuck Schmidt said details of the con­tract buyout have not been detcrmined. 
Schmidt said Ross had thought about resigning before Monday. 
"This isn't the only time he felt this way," Schmidt said. "lie doesn't get too high. but he gets down pretty low. 
"I can't say I talked him out of it before, but has he thought about this'? Sure." 
In his fourth year with the I,i()ns, Hoss compiled a 27-30 regular-season record and an 0-2 mark from playoff appear­ances in 1997 and last season. lie replaced Wayne Fontes, who was fired in December 1996. 
The 63-year-old Ross, who did not attend the news conf"er­ence. submitted a letter of res­ignation to ownnr William Clay Ford. 
"I um sorry, also. for not giv­ing you the championship tro­phy you so richly deserved. Your strong support was my constant motivation throughout my time here," Hoss wrote. 
Ford said Hoss resigned on his own. 
"I think he felt that he just burned himself out physically and mentally, that he didn't have any more to give," Ford said. "I think he made the right decision." 
The news of Hoss· resignation surprised the Lions. 
"We've seen how frustrated he's been and we und!lrstand his l"cclings," llcrman Moore 

said. "But I don't think anybody saw this coming." Ross does not want to coach again, according to Moeller. 
The highlights of Ross' career occurred before he came to Detroit in 1997. 
lie led the San Diego Chargers lo the 1995 Super Bowl, five years after taking Georgia Tech to the national championship. 
Moeller had a lot of success in five years at Michigan before he was fired. 
lie was 44-13-3, with three Big Ten titles and four wins in New Year's Day bowl games. The Wolverines won a Big Ten­record 19 straight conferencc games and were unbeaten over a span of' 22 games from 1990­93. 
Moeller pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct and assault charges and was fined $200 in connection with a drunken out­burst at a Detroit-area restau­rant that ended with Moeller punching a police officer. Michigan wanted Moeller to resign, but when he refused, he was fired. 
Moeller served two seasons as Cincinnati's tight-ends coach before being hired in 1997 as the Lions' running backs coach. This year, the 58-year-old. Moeller has served as an assis­tant head coach and lineback­ers coach. 
Jim Brandstatter, a former Michigan lineman who is an analyst for Lions' radio broad­casts. believes Moeller is equipped to deal with the rigors 
of being a  head coach in the  
NFL.  
"l  think  one  of his  more  

telling statements was that he's learned how to deal with pres­sure better," Brandstatter said. "Since being at Michigan. he's learned lessons on his own and through observation as an assistant at Cincinnati and now in Detroit as it relates to deal­ing with pressure." 
Moeller is taking over a fran­chise that hasn't won a world championship since 1957 and is 1-9 in the playoffs since.

system. Ramsey also won the 500 yard freestyle. 
The Belles had a meet full of in-season bests and strong swims, Hildebrandt said. "Because the longer [dis­tance! events were new to the freshmen, I looked at how they swam the race -not just their times. I am very happy with their performances. They swam smart, consistent races. 
Smart and consistent times couldn't help the Belles come out with a win against 
Western Ontario Saturday afternoon. Struggling to notch high place finishes, the Belles cotild only capture two first place finishes. Ramsey contin­ued to shine, placing on top in the 400-yard freestyle, and the 400-yard freestyle squad also wrapped up the meet in first. 
This was the Belles first time competing against Western Ontario and they weren't sure what lo expect, admitted Hildebrandt. 
"Even though we couldn't put a win in our column, we gained some valuable experi­ence," said Hildebrandt. 
Other top performances this weekend were seen from 

Elizabeth Doro on Saturday with a second place finish in both the 50 and 100 yard freestyle events. 
The Belles sole diver, senior Hyann Cox debuted a a front dive with a full twist Friday night and contributed f'irst place points for the Belles 
"She was truly amazing. She went out there and did dives that she had never attempted before. She's a trooper," said Hildebrandt. 
The Belles will not see league competition until Nov. 14 when they face off against Olivet. In the meantimfl they will travel to Wabash over the weekend to compete against the women of' Transalvania.

teams, although Fassel doesn't want to overemphasize the importance of the game. He doesn't want his team feeling like it has arrived if they beat the Rams or that it isn't good enough if it loses. 
Fassel is also trying to down­play the absence of Warner and Faulk. 
"If you think for one minute that this football team or myself or this coaching staff is going to look at these guys any differently -with or without Marshall Faulk -you 're crazy," Fassel said. "You guys may do it. We're not. 
"These guys are still the heavyweight champion of the football world," he said. "Thev can still move that football and score a \vhole lot of points. Until somebody else takes their throne away from them, that's who they still arc and with a heck of a record." 
Fassel thinks these Giants are better than the team that lost 34-10 to the Rams in St. Louis last season. 
New York is faster on defense with the addition of Mike Barrow at middle line­backer, and with cornerback Jason Sehorn seemingly ready to return from a broken rib. 
The Giants also feel the need to prove they are as good as their record. 
"You look at what we've done and there are only a cou­ple teams in the whole league with a better record," Fassel said. On the other hand, we'll just keep on marching through. We don't have to beat the drum right now. Hopefully we'll make a bang at the end."

backstroke. 
"We weren't quite finishing our races the way we needed to," Van Saun said. 'Tm not going to say that I'm not upset, but losing one meet is not going to ruin our entire season." 
The Irish did have bright spots in the weekend, howev­er, sweeping a quad meet at University of Miami-Ohio against Miami (Ohio), Kenyon. and Pittsburgh on Friday. 
Key performances were Van Saun's first place in the 200 yard freestyle, Labosky's 
1.650 yard freestyle win, junior Kelly 1-Iecking's double backstroke victories, sopho­more Amy Deger's first places in the butterfly events and Mattingly's double wins on the boards. 
Jrish backstrokers made the biggest dent in the com­petition, soaking their oppo­nents with a 1-2-3-4 sweep in the 100 backstroke. 
Led by Becking, freshmen Lisa Garcia, Jessica Roberts, and junior Tiffany O'Brien sealed the event for the Irish. 
O'Brien and Hecking's per­formances were crucial, Weathers said. O'Brien post­ed "some of her best" times this season, Weathers said, and Hecking, who bounced back from illness, was a solid contributor. 

"(O'Brien] had some of her best swims outside of the Big East [Championships] since she's been at Notre Dame," Weathers said. "Her swims were pretty incredible. With [Becking! being sick, her times were incredible." 
The Notre Dame swim team will take a week off, and return to competition at the Indiana University Invitational Nov. 17-19.

FOOTBALL 

Irish seek revenge against Eagles 
By TIM CASEY 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Sounds like a scene straight from Hollywood. 
Notre Dame had just lost 27­21 to Michigan State on Sept. 23, fallen to 2-2 and faced the possibility of losing its starting quarter­back for the remain­der of the 

Davie 
season. Facing an uncertain future, coach Bob Davie met with the entire squad, put the rest of the schedule on a board and spoke from the heart. 
"That was the last time and really the only time that I talked about anything like that,'' Davie said on Monday. "I thought at that time it was realistic because of the atti­tude of this team to say that we could win and we could have a successful season." 
And now, after four straight victories the Irish are steadily climbing the rankings. They stand at No. 11 in the Associated Press poll, No. 12 in the USA Today/ESPN poll and. most importantly, No. 12 in the latest Bowl Championship Series stand­ings. If Notre Dame wins their three remaining games, an invitation to the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans or the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz. is a strong possibility. 
"It's a tremendous opportu­nity for this football team," Davie said. "But everyone real­izes after watching college football this weekend how topsy-turvy things are and how every week is a different chal­lenge." 
Davie's cautious attitude stems from the past two sea­sons, when his "November to

Remember" motto became  
more forgetful than memo­ 
rable. In 1998, one week after  
Jarious Jackson injured his  
right knee, Notre Dame's 10-0  
loss to USC ended their BCS  
chances. Then last year, after  
four straight victories, the  
Irish lost their final four.  
Included in. the stretch was a  
31-29 loss to this week's oppo­ 
nent, Boston College. Notre  
Dame entered the game at 5-5  
and could have qualified for a  
bowl berth with a victorv. ·  
Following the game, several  
Boston College players  
returned to the field and cele­ 
brated by tearing up pieces of  
grass from the Stadium.  
"I remember vividly [former  
Boston College defensive line­ 
man] Chris Hovan picking up  
grass and running around,"  
senior offensive guard Jim  
Jones said. "You don't like to  
see that on your home field."  
Whereas the Eagles came to South Bend in 1999 with a for­ 
midable defense, a 7-2 record  
and a No. 25 national ranking,  
this year's squad has struggled  
against quality opponents.  
Their 6-3 record includes wins  
over teams with a combined  
15-33 record. Rut the Eagles  
have lost by an average of  
nearly 17 points a game  
against West Virginia (4-4 on  
the season), Virginia Tech (8­ 
1) and Pittsburgh (5-3). Boston  
College has won two straight,  
including a 31-3 victory over  
Temple on Saturday.  
"They cost us a bowl game  
[last year]," senior tight end  
Jabari Holloway said. "As far  
as them celebrating that's  
going to come when you beat  
Notre Dame. Beating Notre  
Dame is a life-crowning  
achievement."  
And for Holloway, one he  
hopes does not occur again in  
2000.  
Hassefbeck out for game  
One year after playing  
arguably the best game of his  
career, Boston College quar­ 
terback Tim Hasselbeck will be  
a spectator on Saturday. The Eagles starter suffered  I l  
an medial collateral ligament injury in his left knee during the second quarter against  l I I I  
Temple. On Monday. Boston  I I  
Colllege coach Tom O'Brien  
said "whether it's two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, we don't know right yet. But he definitely cannot play this weekend." Brian St. Pierre, who threw  I l ' l  
for 118 yards and a touchdown  
after replacing Hasselbeck on  
Saturday, will start against the  
Irish. St. Pierre, a sophomore,  
has played in all nine games  
this year and has completed  
30-of-45 passes for 369 yards.  
He has also rushed seven  
times for negative 17 yards  
and a touchdown.  
"It's not like he's a typical  
backup quarterback," Davie  
said. "Anytime you lose your  
starting quarterback it's diffi­ 
cult but I think in their situa­ 
tion. they have about as close  
to having two starters as any­ 
one in college football does."  
Basselbeck completed 20-of­ 
30 passes for 272 yards and  
gained 60 yards on 15 carries  
in last season's victory.

November, BCS adds excitement to college football 
It felt like Bowl Championship Series season. 
When I woke up on Saturday morning and felt the 85 degree heat hanging in my room like a Joey I lildcbol<l punt. I thought I had magi­cally been t1own to Miami or Tempe during the night. 
Even though the warm weather just turned out to be my radiator gone mad. there was a lot that went on in col­lege football that kept all or us asking the same question we've been asking all year: What's going to happen next'! 
Going into Saturday's games, them were only three unde­feated teams left in Division f: Oklahoma, Virginia Tech, and Texas Christian. Coming out of Saturday, the only one left was undisputed No. I Oklahoma. 
Before its 27-24 loss to San Jose State, TCU had only been able to climb to No. 9 in the BCS rankings because of a schedule slightly softer than a

be if the Horned Frogs went 
undefeattid but never got a 
shot at the title. 
Fortunately for the coordina­tors of all the hoopla. this isn't an issue anymore. As for TCU. it goes from legitimate BCS contender to third place in the WAC, awaiting a game against UTEP with huge Holiday Howl implications. 
The other previously unde­feated team, BCS No. 2 Virginia Tech, went down to south Florida to square off with BCS No. 5 Miami in what was in effect the Big East championship game. 
Miami won easily, 41-21, snapping a five game losing streak to lhe !Iokies. However, the man many regard as the best player in college football, Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick, was only able to play about one ineffective quarter because of an ankle sprain suffered against Pitt the week before. 
Could the Hurricanes have won if Michael Vick had been healthy? That's one question we'll never really know lhe answer to. 
But another interesting question involving the 'Canes is looming bigger and bigger with each passing week: could Miami be No. 2 in both the

UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME INTERNATIONAL STUDY PROGRAM IN 
DUBLIN, IRELAND 
"The Best of Both Worlds" 
INFORMATION MEETING 
Wednesday, November 8, 2000 102 DeBartolo 4:45 PM 
With Claudia Kselman, Associate Director International Study Programs 

Coaches and AP polls, beat Florida State head-to-head, and still have to sit back and watch as the Seminoles take the No. 2 spot in the "national championship" game at the Orange Bowl'' 
It's possible. Miami already beat FSU. They're already No. 2 in both polls. 
But going into this weekend, they were still two spots behind their in-state rivals in the BCS rankings. Florida State didn't do them any favors either, pasting BCS No. 13 Clemson 54-7. 
But for all of this to ever become an issue assumes a lot, too. Just look at all the stuff that could still happen. 
I said tho Miami-Va. Tech game was "in effect" the Big East Championship game because those two squads are bothinthetoptenin the country. But while Virginia Tech's conference season is over. Miami still plays Hoston College, Syracuse, and. proba­bly most dangerously, the fre­quent flyer mile gathering air show of Pitt. One loss and the BCS is off the hook again. An improbable two losses and the llokies win the confornnce crown. After all, Miami is a team that beat Louisiana Tech by a lopsided 11 points last week. 
Even if none of that hap­pens, Oklahoma and Nebraska could meet up again in the Big 12 Championship. Oklahoma scored 31 unanswered points to win the first meeting 31-14. Huskers don't forget that sort of thing. 
Then, you would have the three way debate between Miami. Nebraska and Florida State to see which two would go to the national title tilt. That is, of course, assuming Florida State beats anothor in­state rival in Florida, who also has a shot at the Orange Howl. 
Confusing'? Yes. Fun? You bet. 
Where does all this leave Notre Dame? They're moving up. thanks to games like Northwestern's win over Michigan, a 54-51 final that featured more scoring than a lot of Big Ten basketball games. 

Had TCU been able to climb to sixth in the BCS standings and had N·otre Dame been able to win out, then some sort of contractual thing would have given the Irish one of the at­large bids in the BCS. Notre Dame can still win out. but the computers don·t take TCU's losses to unranked teams too well. 
Nine wins will most likely place the Irish in the top 1 O of the BCS, so hopes for a Fiesta or Sugar bowl berth arc still alive. If not. then maybe they'll grab a return trip to the Gator Howl after a one year hiatus. 
Unless, of course, Big East No. 2 and I leisman hopeful Michael Vick go there. But then again. that assumes Miami wins out. 
So many possibilities, and they leave only one possible conclusion: college football is cool.

Time glitch costs Belles 
new records 
By JANEL MILLER 
Sports W'riter 
Sometimes, every second 
counts. 
Evrry second certainly count­ed this weekend for the Belles swimming and diving team, who faced off in two separate dual meets with t h Cl University of Chicago and t h e University of Western Ontario. Clinching close races, the Belles defeated UIC Friday 149-69 with some record-shattering swims. But while the Belles cut the seconds where they neednd to, the new records didn't count. 
A glitch in the timing system Friday night at Bolls meant all races would be manually timed with a stopwatch. instead or the techonologically superior touch­pad system. The touchpad sys­tem allows a swimmer to be timed "on the touch" in the water. 
While the stopwatches revealed th at the Belles 400­yard medley relay team had broken last year's record, because it wasn't a touchpad finish, the record was thrown out. 
"With watch timing, times can be slower than actual or faster. It all deptmds on the person with the watch," commented Gretchen llildcbrandt, head coach. 
The 400 yard medley relay te.am of Lane Herrington, Lauren Smith, Megan Hamsey, and Colleen Sullivan thought their first place finishing time of four minutes, 15 seconds was a ncm· school record. 
But under the circumstances the 11 second faster time coukl not be counted. Smith, Hamsey, and Sullivan joined with Chloe Lenihan to challenge the record again Saturday, but missed by .6 seconds, 
Ramsey faced the timing chal­lenge again in her individual race Friday night in her 200 yard butterfly. 
lier lirst place time of 2:15.87 broke the 1995 school record bv over three seconds, but was dis-­carded because of the timing
