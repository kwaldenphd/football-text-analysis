Iranians seize scores of American hostages 
TEHRAN (AP) -Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's followers, already holding scores of hostages in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, seized two U.S. consulates and the British Embassy yesterday in an escalating war of nerves against "the great Saran, America" and its ''evil '' ally. 
No injuries were reported in the new takeovers in Iran, and it was not known how many new American hostages were seized, if any. The British Foreign Office in London announced last night that the takeover of its embassy in Tehran ended peacefully after six hours, apparently following intervention by the Iranian army guards, and no one was hurt. It sai.d more than 100 students had mvaded the embassy, holding about 30 people. 
The head of the Iranian Embassy in Washington made clear the Tehran government would not intercede w free U.S. Embassy hostags. Ali Agah told reporters the government "reflects the demand of the people'' regarding the shah, and the student militants who seized the embassy Sunday could not be asked to leave. 
The State Department estimated 60 American hostages were being held in i:he embassy, and said it received indirect assurances from the students that "all are well." Previous reports said seven or eight Iranian employees also were held. 
Iranian leader Khomeini and his student supporters demanded 
the United States and Britain hand over two "cnminals" for trial­

But the Carter administration rejected the demand that lt expel

was living in France.

NRC foresees possible problents 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The chairman of the Nuclear Regul­atory Commission acknowled­ged yesterday that certain nuclear plants near populated areas may have to be shut down because of potef]tial problems in evacuating residents in the event of an emergency. 
Joseph M. Hendrie, testify­ing before a House subcom­mmee, also announced that an NRC freeze on New· nuclear plants-imposed shortly after the March 28 accidenr at Three Mile Island-is bei11g extended at least until spring.

many undergraduate students 
actuallv used the computers 
until tht: end of the semester.'' 
There are approximately 70 
terminals on campus available 
to students and faculty mem­
bers. But 70 people can't "log 
on to the computer at the same 
time. The present computer 
system contains 35 ports. 
''This means that 70 terminals 
are competing for 3 5 slots at 
one time," Walsh said. So 
students using the terminals at 
busy hours normally have to · 
wait to get onto the computer. 
Most of the computer labs are 
open 16 hours a day for student 
use and they are almost always · "up in working order." 
"We run 99.2 per cent up as 
compared to the national aver­
age of8 5 percent," W a Ish said. 
When the computers are 
down, it is usually because a 
piece of equipment has failed 
and sometimes it takes a while 
to find the bad part and replace 
it." 
Walsh doesn't receive many 
complaints from students about 
the crowded computer labs 
even though the wait is longer. 
He makes an effort to go to the 
labs once or twice a we,ek for a 
few hours to make sure that 
things are running smoothly, he 
said. 
Walsh also mentioned that 
students don't normally com­
plain because "most under­
stand that there are problems 
and they try to work around 
them. But there is a problem 
when everybody waits until the 
last minute to run programs.'' 
Sandra Cole, an electrical 
engineering major, has three 
classes that require her to use 
the computer terminals. On the 
average, she goesto the 
computer lab once or twice a 
week for rwo to three hours. 
For each class, she gets a 
different identification number. 
''The computer lab is pretty 
busy when I go up, considering 
I usually wait until the last 
minute," she said, "but some­
times I think that they don't 
have enough facilities. They 
need a couple more kev­

DFLPHI, Ind. (AP).-For years, the 2, 800 folks in this sleepy little north central Indiana town haven't had much use for the locks on their doors or the rare political battle in their own backyard. 
It's 1979, and they still aren't locking their doors. But theresa new interest in Tuesday's elec­tion, and they can thank Cindy 
L. Brooks for that. It's not just that she's the first woman ever to seek office in this Carroll County community and one of 24 women running for mayor in 22 Indiana cities. It's not even that she's chal­lenging Democrat Wayne Van­Sickle, a three-term mayor 
who's been unopposed the past two elections.

"I don't expect a walk-in candidate or a shoo-in,'' he added. "Every election has to be taken seriously until that last vote is counted.'' 
The Carroll County Republi­can Party isn't Jaughtng, either. 
Ignoring the advice of chair­man Tom Ives that she seek a city council seat instead, Cindy jumped into the mayoral prima­ry and defeated Michael George Griffey, a photographer 10 years lmc S<Ul.ior(-almfl!>st 2 to 
1. 
"It is very true that I tried to discourage her from running for office, but I told her if she was our candidate, I was going to back her,'' Ives said noting that the Democratic mayor and city council believe the fact that 60 percent of Delphi's voters are Republicans. 
He continued, ''I told her to put on a skirt and some moderate heels and go house­to-house, I can't sell Cindy Brooks. Nobody knows her. Only Cindy Brooks can sell herself. Ifshe did that, we'll get the vote out. But I can't say how they'll vote. I'm going to be surprised if she wins.'' 
But Cindy, who campaigned at ''every house in Delphi at least once," won't be surpris­ed. Neither will her parents, Whitt and Rebecca Brooks, nor

''If the people get out and vote for me who have said they're, going to vote for me, it's mine. If they don't, it's his," said Cindy, whose $400 campaign of canvassing, phone calls and homemade poster has been manned by family and friends. 
Although Cindy admits she hasn't had much experience, a year as a police dispatcher 111 city hall gave her a good idea what's going on in city govern­ment, she said. 
And she believes she has a good grip on the issues: snow removal and VanSickle's lack of responsiveness to the public. 
"I know what's going on 111 this town. What you've got to do in a small town like this is listen to people and their ideas," Cindy said. "He (Van­Sickle) doesn't confront the issues, and he doesn't listen to people." 
''I think someone read the Chicago paper to her and said Mayor ] ane Byrne got elected on snow removal," VanSickle replied. "And what does 'unre­sponsive' mean? If I fail to perform my responsibility as mayor, I'm sure the public would ask me to be removed from office." 
VanSickle said he believed Cindy's candidacy was motivat­ed by a ~roup of disgruntled former c1ty employees who ''are backing her to get back at me. "

Provost Dr. T1mothy O'Meara rejected the CLC's keg proposal which had earlier been rejected by Fr. John Van Wolvlear, VICe-president for student af­fairs. No appeal to the Universi­ty President was planned as of last night. 
In a second letter addressed to Roche, Fr. Van Wolvlear honored the CLC's request that changes be made in du Lac regarding the CLC' s involve­ment in administration deci­sions concerning University policies and residence hall re­gulations. Van Wolvlear's letter stated that changes in these two categories' 'will be presented to the CLC for review, discussion and input." 
Van Wolvlear added that if changes in policy or residence hall regulations are made when the CLC is not in session, "the Dean of Students will officially notify members of the CLC Committee of these changes and await reply.'' 
The CLC chairman will be vested with the responsibility of seeing that the Dean of Stu­dents has CLC members' ad­dresses. 
The next meeting of the CLC will be held Monday, November 19 at 6:45 p.m. in Kennan Hall. 
   Computers 
[continued from page 3) 
Walsh also meets with the faculty members involved in teaching courses that use comp­uters. "We're trying to balance out when assignments are be­ing given," he said, "because we go through a week when many kids are using the termi­nals and the next week, no one is using them." 
Dr. William Davisson teaches Economic Methodology and Modeling Simulation. For both classes, he repuires a weekly assignment to be done on the computer. To help his students, Dr. Davisson reserves the computer lab on the secomd floor of O'Shaughnessy for several hours one night a week. But, "most times, students can't finish in the lab hours," said Dr. Davisson, ''so students do have to work at getting terminals at a particular time.'' Even with the extra time that students must spend to get their assignments done, Davis­son said he has not noticed an abnormal number of late as­signments. 
There are also peak periods of computer terminal use around mid-term and final exam times. To tackle this problem, the faculty members are trying to spread their examination dates out so that everybody does not hit the computer labs at one time. 

Some teachers give other classes priority over the comp­
uter  terminals  by  extending  
deadline  dates  to  help  the  
situation even more.  

Another aid to lessen the traffic in the computer labs are graphs posted in the computing center that show a student's chances of getting onto the computer at a given time. Students can use the graphs to figure out the times when the labs will be least crowded. 
Any minor repairs made on the computers are done from 
6:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. during the week and from 8:00 a.m. to 
4:00 p.m. Sundays so that the repair time won't interfere with the computer's availability to students. 
Walsh said he believes that the computer situation will improve next semester if only because of the decrease in the number of business students taking the basic economics course. 
The increasing number of courses using computers for class assignments is a factor to consider but it is not a big problem for the computing center now and it is unlikely to be a major problem in the near future.

The Chicano Chameleon 
Is a Chicano at Notre Dame 
still a Chicano?' Or is he a 
Mexican American, or an His­
panic, or a Latin-American, or 
Spanish-surnamed, or Spanish­speaking? Or is he Other? 
We guess it depends on which form he is filling out. On the other hand, it does give the Chicano a variety of alterna­tives from which to choose. 
Some Chicanos do feel uncom­fortable with that name. It derives from the colloquializa­tion of the ''xicano'' part of the word mexicano. Some prefer the term Mexican-American, for being a less radical, more acculturated term that is more easily pronounced by the domi­nant culture. Some are uncom­fortable with the terms Spa­nish-speaking and Spanish­surnamed because they don't speak Spanish or because they lost or gained their Spanish surname through marriage. 
Simitarly, the teATis Hispanic and Latin-American lump the Chicano together with his bro­thers from Latin-America and the Iberian Peninsula. This can be beneficial when we need the strength of numbers, but detri­mental when addressing the cultural and political needs of such a diverse group. The image arises of a chameleon of great potential strength; 
Even the Chicano population itself has div<>rse roots: Mexi­can, Indian, and Spanish blood to begin with; a variety of dialects within the rich Spanish tongue, e.g. the Tex-Mex of Texas, the Calo of California, etc. Here then emerges a glimpse of the Chicano chame­leon. 
But these roots are easy to 
Al Alba 
lose, here at Notre Dame and ·else where, under the ,rervasive mandate to jump mto the glorious American Melting-pot. 
But we must not burn the 
bridges to our culture. We 
must keep them open and 
well-travelled, if we are both to 
keep our culture and to partici­
pate in the American dream 
without it remaining the night­
mare it has, for the most part, 
been. 

So, since we are here now at Notre Dame, Chicanos need to communicate with their fellow Chicanos, to establish a contin­uing dlscoin'se that will 'Streng-r" then our toehold here; that will create the climate for develop­ing a consciousness of the Chicano and non-Chicano stu­dent; and that will add .the Chicano input to the acad~mic tradtion of formenting social change. 
It is in this spirit that we, a group of a few Chicano post­graduate students, through the catalyst of a Mexican-American Studies Coilloquium taught by Dr. Julian Samora, have begun this media project: a biweekly column (every second Tuesday to search out the Chicano chameleon at Notre Dame and to explore the topics and issues of interest to it. Feel free to give us feedback and sugges­tions. 
Also there is this Saturday, November 10, the second annu­al Midwest Foco Meetings of the National Association of Chicano Studies. There will be seminars in the ballroom of LaFortune Hall on topics such as education, law, economics, psychology, and community studies. 
.A sports column by Michael Onufrak entitled ·~Kuhn Out ofhis,League".appeared ~n the last page of Thursday s.Observet. Theptece was a criticism of Bowie Kuhn's recent acttons toward Willie Mayswhichforced the former star to resign from his front office job with the New York Mets because of his ·contract with Bally Manufactur ing Corp.; a company with substantial gambling interests. 
Onufrak asserts that Kuhn's reasoning in ''benching" Mays is "ludicrous" and implies rhatWillie Mays is so highlyincorruJ?tible that he would never have any interests tn gambling bec<~use of his affiliation with the company. Not 
Willie. Mays,. ap..p.le. pie, ~.om and the flag--­
they'n· aU the same, aren t they? 
Sorry tO burst y<;>ur bubble, Mike, but baseball players have not been known to be immune to gambling people: the 1919 Black Sox scandal almost ktlled organized baseballin the U.S., and it was due only to the actions of comm.issioners like Kuhn that baseball's reputation regained respectability. 
In addition, Mike, you seem to have a distorted conception of both Kuhn's job as commissioner and ht.s intentions, The commissioner's respons­ibility is to protect the integrity of the game~ Kuhn is aware that since Ma}'S would · be working for a company affiliated with gambling, the Say Hey Kid would be accesible to gamblers. 
Kuhn is likewise aware that ~~biers have an avid interest in NFL football. ( 'Lines" for maJOr league games appear daily.. .in the Chicago Tribune during the season.) .. . . . 
You can probably see the obvtous trreconcda­biliry between Mays' baseball; job and his Bally job: you can't serve two masters equally well, and byfordng Will bto guit his Mets job, Kuhn is assuring that the uothmkable could not occur: i.e., a gambling scandal or even whispers ofone wl;lich wouid·... t~r¥s,h baseball'.s good name, 

Daniel lawton 
whatever that is. 

However, Mike, you seem to be ignorant of these facts and logic . in your treatment of the issue. 
But then, under a full head of steam, yougo on w lambast Kuhn for baseball's present woes, citing escalating player salaries, the rift between union umpires and non-union· umpires, exces­sive promotions, etc, saying that none of the:>e t~ings happened before Kuhn became commts-, swner. 
Mike, may I remind you that Kuhn had no control over the abolition of the reserve clause which· made free agency and thus high salaries possible---that decision was made in a court, not m the commissioner's office. (It was bound to happen anyway and it was only fair to the players, who had suffered too long under the tyrannical whims of owners.) Also, the blame for such disasters as riots in Chicago and Cleveland, and for "inane" promotions, be­longs with owners such as Rar Kroc and Bill Veeck, not with Bowie Kuhn. It is highly unfair and extremely inaccurate to criticize Kuhn for that over which he exercises little or no controL (Free enterprise, you know.) . 
It istruethat Bowte Kuhn has made blunders as commissioner, sometimes major ones. Above all, though, he has shown a stubborn willingness to stick oy his guns and fight to keep baseball as dean as he can keep it: and as long as he has this erid in mind, major league baseball will remain comparatively free of the woes that plague the NFL and NBA today (low attendance, multiple wild cards, player violence). Kuhn's tenure has seen the most prosperous and popular period in baseball's history; true, there have been some rough spots, but worse occurrences have been pr~vented only because of stern actions by the Commissioner's Office. Mike Onufrak unfortunately fails to realize this; 





1Smile ofreason' 
Mr. Lauer, enough time has ~::\~d, tha~ f~ I can reply to your article "The Question" (Oct.)) without an excessive display of emotion. How can you speak of decisions of the heart, how can you say that rationality cannot itself decide anything? We. can allow your iconoclastic impulses only so much reign. Your article on the Golden Dome, that many of us could bear. Your rude diatribes against capitalism, that too we rould tolerate. But when you strike at rationaltty, you go too far. I ask you to think of Houdin's statue of Voltaire--the ''smile ofreason'' --and repent. Our very culture, the fabric of society is the endless Socratic d talogue, the warp and woof of society. 
As a university we are the very celebration of reason: history's construction of our past, psy­chology's revelations of the mind or philosophy's "Science of ethics''. All this and more are testimonies to reason. Or consider if you will how busi­ness and economics have trans­formed the very face of this earth unleashing a productive power that has benefited man­kind immea~urabley. And think a moment upon the accomplishments of science and of engineering: they above all are the accomplishments of reason. 
By relegating reason to emo­tion--to the heart, as· you say-­you attempt to undercut our very existence, not only as academics., but as man. 
Mr. Lauer, I sympathize with you--please believe me your thoughts are sometimes my own; however I must stand firm. I will, if you will allow me, quote David Hum~ that irascible Scot to lend tf not another dimension to my posi­tion, then at least a certain authority: ''Reason is and ought to be a slave of the passions" (For "passions" rea.d "heart" or "moral senti­ment".) 
l in my turn ask you to look at "our culture", indeed at the university you hold as a para­digm of that society. I believe we will find the need to replace Voltaire's "smile of reason" (shich I find at best enigmatic) with a new symbol. Let us turn from the Apollonial (rational) 
·art of sculpture to the Dionysiac 
 

Paul Lauer 
(drunken) art of poetry and to Homer. Is not the giant Cyclops, blinded, groping in the dark for nobody (everybody) a symbol of reason without the "heart"? Has not everybody (nobody) put out the eve of Cyclops? Fearing bur sight (our 
emotions) we have blinded ourselves (by renouncing our emotions) and so blinded rea­son. 
How can we defend reason gone blind; is not the assembly line in any factory a chaos more pure and more wild than any found within the aborigine's superstition? And do not the cooling rowers of a nuclear plant or the shape of the Trident submarine make a true monument to science and engi­neering? And is there not a fear without end in this work of pur rationality? 
Your faith, Mr. Lauer, in reason is misplaced. It is, to be sure, a most powerful tool; iris a means to the end but it is no more. It would. upon the evidence of this century, be wise to give the eye back to Cyclops. We may s'till have to fear his wrath. but we will not have to fear his blind rage.

undergoing treatment for lymph cancer. New York Hospital said 
Monday that a rumor in his neck has enlarged since the surgery, 
and that more surgery may be needed to remove a stone in a bile 
duct. 

The State Department says he was admitted to the United States 
for an indefinite stay bur will not be allowed to stay permanently. 
Broadcasts of the government-run radio, monitored in London, 
said students seized the U.S. consulates in Tabriz in northwest 
Iran and in the southern dity ofWhiraz. The State Department said 
another mob occupied and ransacked the Iran-American Society 
building, a cultural center, in Isfahan, central Iran. 
The British Foreign Office later reported that students invaded 
the British Embassy in an apparently peaceful takeover. It said 
some staff members were believed inside at the time, but it was 
not known whether any were taken hostage. 
The Moslem clergyman Khomeini, in a speech in his 
headquarters city of Aum, endorsed the takeover of the U.S. 
Embassy and said it had been a center of "plots" by "the great 
Satan, America," Radio Tehran reported. His representative 
Ayatollah Seyyed Khansari declared that America, Russia and 
Britain were each "more evil than the others," the broadcast said. 
The Carter administration has been relying on the Iranian 
government's efforts to secure the hostages' freedom. But the real 
power in Iran lies with Khomeini's Revolutionary Council of 
Moslem clergymen, and not with the government of Prime 
Minister Mehdi Bazargan. 

Iranian government officials said they were hopeful Khomeini's son Ahmad, who was summoned to the U.S. Embassy by the student militants, might obtain the release of the hostages. Ambassadors of other nations in Tehran also offered to act as mediators. 
But the students said they called the younger Khomeini only to show him that the embassy was a "nest of U.S..espionage" against the Iran's revolutionary regime. And there were no reports that any diplomats had actually begun mediating the standoff. 
Khomeini himself, in his Qum speech, denounced what he said were efforts by "rotten roots" to get him to persuade the youths to end the embassy occupation. 
He declared that the United States "must be put in their place." If it does not return the shah, "then we shall do whatever is necessary,'' Radio Tehran quoted him as saying. The students also demanded that the Iranian government cut all ties with the United States. 
The radio said Iranians staged anti-American demonstrations across the country yesterday. 
Iran's Pars news agency reported that an American identified as Bill Herr, an employee of a U.S. oil contracting firm, had been taken hostage by workers of the rural development office in Ahwaz, an oil center in southwest Iran. 
An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman reached by telephoae from Nicosia, Cyprus, said Monday his "general feeling is that things will settle down peacefully and soon." 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -Sen. Birch Bayh, D-lnd., said yester­day he sometimes feels like sending a "goon squad" after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini because of continuing unrest in Iran. 
Bayh's comments came as Khomeini's student followers, already holding scores of hos­tages in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, seized two U.S. con<:u­lates and the British Embassy in an escalaring war ,.c nf'rves againo.;r ''the great c..;:tran .. · Amcr ica" and Britam. 
fhe l>LUJuus and Iranian lead­er Khomeini demanded that the United States and Britain hand over two "criminals" for trial ­the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, hospitalized in New York, and former Iranian 
Prime  Minister  Shahpour  
Bakhuar,  living  in  exile  in  
Weste:-n Europe.  

Radio Tehran said the stu­dents holding the American Embassy also demanded that the Iranian government end all ties with the United States. And Iran's petroleum minister said a 

cutoff of oil exports to America was possible. 
''When I see the situation that exists today, I feel like saying, 'Send a goon squad after Aya­tollah Khon1eini,' "Bayh told a 
civic club  breakfast  meeting  
here.  
 Bayh  did  not  elaborate  and  

could not be reached for com­
ment. His a5sistant press secre­t;:~ry, Rich Paul said later in Washington, "1 think he's more or less being rhetorical. He's not calling for an armed inva­sion of Iran." · Paul said Bayh's remarks re­flected his anger about the embassy seige in Tehran. "He (Bayh) ts saying that he hopes the State Department in its negotiations would be tough with the Iranian government," Paul, said. 
Bayh also proposed at the breakfast meeting a Camp Da­vid summit on energy. 
"I think all of the movers and shakers in the field of eneq~y should be taken to Camp David and made to stay there until they come up with a solution of America's energy problems," he said, "just like Prime Mini­ster tlegm of Israel and Presi­dent Sadat of Egypt were kept at Camp David until they came up with an acceptable peace treaty. 

"We must find a way to mobilize all cf our forces to solve this problem," he added.

The Observer Another misfire 
Carter review-s shuttle progratn 
WASHINGTON (AP) America's space shuttle, dealt another setback by an engine failure, faces a critical cross-­roads next week when Presi­dent Carter personaHy reviews the troubled project. 
A few months ago, the presi­dent probably wouldn't have taken such a personal interest. But the shuttle is becoming more and more vital to national defense, and the White· House is counting on it as a major tool to verify Russian compliance with arms limitation agree­ments. 
Carter also wants to know about technical, financial and management problems that have plagued the shuttle and about safety questions raised by a team on White House con­sultants who recently in­vestigated the project. 
One of them, former astro­naut William Anders, said the first manned flight of the shuttle wiii be riskier than his flight on Apollo 8, man's first trip to the vicinity of the moon. 
Dr. Robert A. Frosch, admin­istrator of the National Aero­nautics and Space Administra­tion, will brief the president next week. He told a congres­sional committee last week he would request a ''several hun­dred million doHar" addition to NASA's budget to help put the program back on track. 
Carter is expected to endorse the !ihuttle and the extra money because of the national security aspects. 
Against this backdrop, the shuttle suffered another blow Sunday when an engine re­ceived extensive damage dur­ing an important test at a NASA facility at Bay St. Louis, Miss. The failure occurred during the first planned full-duration firing of three clustered engines like those that wiH boost the shuttle. The powerplant was to 
have fired for 510 seconds -the length of time required to hurl a shuttle into orbit -but cut off automatically after nine se­conds when computers detected excessive pressure in a turbo­Pl1mp. 
During the shutdown, one of the engines was extensively damaged as a hydrogen line ruptured. NASA said it did not know how great an impact the failure would have on the pro­~ram, but further engine test­mg was postponed indefinitely. 
''There are a lot of heads hanging down around here,'' said an official at NASA head­quarters Monday. "That failure was a big disappointment." 
The shuttle originaHy was to have flown its first manned or­bital flight last March. But problems with the engine, elec­tronics, thermal protection and management have contributed to a series of delays.

Eight teams have signed up to participate in the Saint Mary's Coilege Bowl Tourna­ment this year, which wiH be played for the first time Wed­nesday evening using a new system. 
Each ~arne wiH be request ­
·ed thts year, according to Mary Laverty, director of Stu­dent Affairs at SMC. "We only have a certain 'lumber of ques­tionpacker'-.' explained Laver­ty. "Conseyuently, we have to play more than one team off of each packet. Therefore, each game ts closed to an.y team not participating in it.'' 
Although the games are clos­ed to any non-participating 
team rhey are open to anyone else who is interested in attend­mg. 
''This is the first time we have sequestered the College Bowl," Laverty said. "We are asking for integrity from the audience. Hopefully, no one will try to pass on any ques­tions.'' 
The tournament will be struc­tured like a round robin. Play begins on Wednesday in Carroll Hall at 7:00 p.m. and will continue through most -0f next week. 
Each team has been practic­ing with the assistance of coaches from Saint Mary's fac­ulty. Each team has been given packages of mock questions, a script outlining the format of the bowl as well as tips on how to play the game from the coaches. 
An all-star team made up of the winning CoHege Bowl team and four other outstanding players will go on to play in the Midwest College Bowl Region­als held at Saint Mary's College in February. The all-star team will compete against teams from such colleges such as Purdue and Indiana University. 
"It's always amazing to see just how much the girls know,'' said Laverty. "It should be a fun event."

Pope decides to reveal state of Vatican finances to cardinals 
VATICAN CITY (AP) -Pope john Paul II told an extraordi­nary meeting of Roman Catho­lic cardinals yesterday he has decided to disclose to them the state of the Vatican's finances. He said it was their ''right and duty to have an exact know­ledge of the present state of the matter.'' 
The Pope's declaration in a keynote speech was believed the first time in modern church history that a pontiff offered the College of Cardinals a look at the Vatican's books, which have been a closely guarded secret known only to a few insiders. 
Opening the meeting, the Pope outlined the agenda which includes reports on the econo­mic situation of the Holy See by 
Its  top  financial  experts  on  
Tuesday:  
The Vatican  spokesman,  the  

Rev. Romeo Panciroli, earlier announced that the pontiff's speech to the closed meeting would not be made public. But cardinals approached by repor­ters while leaving the meeting said some questioned the initial decision and the Pope decided to release his text. 
John Paul, who just completed

the first year of his pontificate, called all 129 cardinals to Rome for the extraordinary meeting to examine problems facing the church. 
The pontiff is reported to be anxious to brief the cardinals on at least some details of the Vatican's financial picture, which Vatican officials say is far from rosy despite reports of the Holy See's immense wealth. 

Reporters and were allowed only to start of the meeting, opened with a Latin prayer a welcoming address to Pope by Carlo Confalonieri 86-year-old dean of the "'u'""'"''~ of Cardinals. 
Reporters were to leave as the Pope stood up and reading his speech in Latin.

Cambodia accepts pledge of 
$186 million in aid 
UNITED NATIONS (A P) -A 
U.N. 
conference of an appalling magnitude" in Cambodia brought aid pledges of $186 million in its opening session yesterday. The Phnom Penh government said it would let relief shipments inro the coun­try via the Mekong River. 

U.N. 
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, who opened the conference on ways to end the suffering of an estimated 2 million persons in the war-torn Indochinese country, called on ''all concerned to cooperate fully . . . in facilitating the distribution of our supplies.'' 


He said arrangements for delivery of relief supplies should ''assure us and the donors that they arrive in the hands of the suffering civilians for whom they are destined.'' 
Waldheim's comments ap­peared to be an appeal to the government of Premier Heng Samrin and its Soviet and Vietnamese backers, who have held up distribution of relief supplies because they do not want them to go to areas of the country controlled by former 
Premier  Pol  Pot,  who  was  
ousted last ] ap.uary.  
Waldheim  mentioned  no  

names and neither did the other speakers, who urged that the rival factions in Cambodia put aside their differences for the sake of the relief program. 
Secretary ofState Cyrus Vance cited th, desperate need for aid to relieve suffering <:;ambodia and declared, "Some issues transcend politics. This is one of them.''

(AP) Yes, Sugar Bowl, there is a Virginia. Lnfortunately, there also is a Georgia, which still is only two victories away from a January 1 trip to New Orleans despite Saturday's embarras­sing 31-0 thrashing by Virginia. 
Georgia's loss left the Bull­dogs at 4-4 overall. But they have had the presence of mind to win their four Southeastern Conference games while drop­pi~g their four non-league af­
fairs.  
Still  to  come  are  Florida

Georgia Tech (ACC) on Decem­ber 1. If the Bulldogs win the first two, they go to the Sugar Bowl regardless of what top­rated Alabama does. 
They'll go even if Alabama ties Georgia for the conference lead, which the Crimson Tide did Saturday by defeating Mis­
sissippi State, 24-7. The Orange and Cotton Bowls, of course, are solidly in Georgia:s corner and are ready to wage a duel to the death over Alabama-if the occasiOn warrants.

Saint Mary's faculty and administra­tion members, as well as the manager of the local Ernst & Whinney firm, comprise the selection committee. 
Regarding her selection, Schneider remarked, ''I really feel honored to be able to represent Saint Mary's College with this award." On Nov. 14, the award will be presented to Schneider at a dinner for all senior accounting majors, facul­ty, and administration.

promotes QB Rudder 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) Senior David Rudder was moved ahead of sopliomore Jeff Ols­zewski as TenneSsee's No. 2 quarterback yesterday as the Vols began preparing for Sarur­day' s game againsr Notre Dame. 
Olszewski saw more than a quarter of playing rime in last week· s I 1-6 loss to Rutgers when _I immyStrearer was pulled from the game after throwing three interceptions. 
But Oi·,;-~wski, hitting three of six attern· ·s and losing three yards on three carries, was unable to move the ball any better than Streater. Tennessee coach Johl ''Y Majors has said finding a r>LW quartf"rback for 
the gradua.. ng Streater is  his  
No.  I  recruiting  pnority  for  
1980.  

"I don't anticipate our play­ing like we did against Rutgers again," Majors said, looking at the upcoming game with the Irish. "But if we do, we'll get run out of the ballpark.'' 
Junior Val Barksdale was moved back onto the first team as a safety after freshman Bill Bates hun his knee in the ·Rutgers game and will be out 
this Saturdrv 

At middle. guard,Steve Kluge, a walk-on player, replaced Carl­ton Gunn, who is listed as a doubtful for Notr"' Dame with a hurt ankle. 
"Now it's a matter of pride," Majors said of his 4-3 team. "We can have an opportunity to salvage a good seasori or have a mediocre or a poor one.''

NEW YORK (AP) -The long 
anticipated sale and transfer of 
Charles 0. Finley's Oakland 
A's franchise to Denver may be 
completed before the end of the 
month, The Associated Press· 
learned yesterday. 

The sale would bring major 
league baseball to Colorado 
beginning in 1980, and there 
were indications that oil mil­
lionaire Marvin Davis, the anti­
cipated buyer, already has 
;,egun assembling a manage­
ment team. 

AI Rosen, who quit his post as 
president of the New York 
Yankees to become an execu­
tive with an Atlantic City· 
gambling casino, was reported 
m line to head the team's front 
office operation. 

While none of the participants 
would specifically ~onfirm the 
transacuon, they d1d not deny 
it. Instead, they hedged, 
perhaps afraid of damaging the 
deal which fell through once 
before, in 1978. 

But the AP learned from a 
knowledgt·able baseball source 
that obstacles which blocked 
the sale before have been eased 
and the deal is virtually certain 
to be completed this time. 
Negotiations should be wrap­ped up some time this month enabling the transaction to be presented for American League approval during the winter baseball meetings next month in Toronto, the source indica­ted. 
Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, who was deeply upset when the Denver move abruptly fell through in April 1978, flew to Oakland during the World 
a t ettcsnears MIAMI(AP)--Veteran lace-
Series with American League President Lee MacPhail to dis­cuss terms of a sta<;liJ.tW l!',:,as·e settlement with city officials. 
"I am in a no comment situation on that one," Kuhn said when asked about the sale. ''I did go to Oakland and I have been continuing my efforts in this matter, but I'm afraid that's all I can say." 
MacPhail said, "We have known for the last several years that the (Oakland -San Francis­co Bay area) territory can not support two dubs. We have talked over this matter in the past and are still pursuing it." Asked if the transfer was 
imminent, MacPhail said 
"Well, not today, not nex~. · weeL It ~~h~t t~r .irrlminent, but we are still hopeful that the 
problem can be solved." 
Finley, controversial owner of the A's, has been trying to sell the team for the past three yt;ars and apparently is close to a satisfactory agreement with Davis, who came within a whisker of buying the club · before. · 
When confronted with reports of the sale being finalized, Finley replied, ''No comment. The club is for sale. That's all I can say." 
The mavarick A's owner pre­viously has been outspoken on the subject. This time, how­ever, he was tight-lipped, say­ing "I couldn't tell you any­thmg about that." . 
Davis was unavailable for comment. 
Rosen, reached at his Atlantic City headquarters, said: ''I have no comment. I am flattered that anyone would consider me for an executive job in baseball. I have just taken this new position and my wife is busy moving from our New York apartment to Atlantic City." 

kicker Toni Fritsch drilled field goals of46, 48 and 39 yards last night as the Hou<>ton Oilers struggled past error-plagued Miami for a 9-6 National Foot­ball League victory. 
The victory improved the Oilers' record to 7-3 and tied them with Cleveland for second place in the American Confer­ence Central Division. The Dol­phins, 6-4, dropped one game behind New England in the AFC East. 
Rookie Uwe von Schamann booted a 32-yard field goal to give the Dolphins a 3-0 first· quarter lead and drew them to within 9-6 with a 51-yarder with 
12:26 left j, the game.

The Saint Mary's volleyball team traveled to Huntington for a quad meet Thursday. The Belles started off the night dismally, dropping their first two matches to Huntington College and Valparaiso by game scores of 6-15, 14-16, and 6-15, 14-16 respectively. In the third match, the Belles came from behind to beat Taylor University by scores of 8-15, 15·9, 15-4. 
"I was a little disappointed in losing against Huntington," said Belles' coach Erin Mur­phy, ''we will play them at state but I guess we'll just have to work a little harder to beat them when it comes." 
''We play Taylor first in state. They are last year's statt champion, so I was very happy to beat them, now we have the advantage," offered Murphy after the victory. 
Murphy complimented soph­omore Amy Terri and freshman Marianne Viola for their spiking in the meet. Terri was 9 for 15 kills on spike attempts and Viola scored on 19 out of 24 
attempted spikes in one match. 
Accordins to Murphy, Ellen Hoye contmued to do well in the· ont row with good spiking and 
blocking averages. Amy Morris and Kathy Monahan showed great stamina, setting for the entire seven games the Belles played. 
The highlight of the evening was freshman Peggy Pieschel' s phenominal defensive playing. ''I put her in in the middle of our second match for her serve receiving ability," said Mur­phy. "She just walked out there and took over the court. She was unbelievable!'' 
The Belles final regular season match before meeting Taylor University in the first round of state competition will be to­morrow night when they travel to Goshen for a dual match. 

kick that enabled Kevin Lovejoy to hit freshman Mark Luetke­hans 30 yards out and all alone. Luetkehans gave Richardson no chance as he rifled a shot just below the crossbar. 
Luetkehans scored a~ain, his fourth of the season, when he headed in a corner kick from Jay Schwartz, another fresh­man, 18 minutes later. 
Freshman Steve Berry, play­ing in only his second varsity game finish~d the scoring with 
11:32 ren ng. Berry made a pass to k ..ow rc1l:k1e Brian McCurrie who, finJing no room to operate, returned the ball to the Greensboro, North Carolina native for the fourth goal of his Notre Dame career.

''Tim was our most valuable player last year with only three goals and five assists,'' Hunter points out. "That has to tell you how much he means to the team. Danny played just as well and, had he started the enure season, there's 
just no telling what he might have done." But neither player wants to talk about himself as the long drive from Columbus nears an end. 
"It's the .l?eople," sighs McCurrie as he stares out the wmdow. "That's what made it so great.'' 
Which just about ends the story unless you want to add a post script which mtght read: 
"They gave what they had to their teammates and friends and everyone reaped the benefits of the relationship." 
And you really don't have to say anything more. "Except that we had a lot of fun doing it," smiles Nauman. But that goes without saying.
