St. Mary's to close? 


Insurance covers 'more extensive' fire losses 

No decision will be made until Thursday of Friday at the earliest on whether or not Saint Mary's will be forced to close due to the coal strike, College President John M.
The Duggan announced yesterday. "At the moment, nothing we've 
been told changes our situation," he said. "Unless something hap­pens such as new coal shipment, we may have to make a decision by Thursday of Friday, to be effective Monday or Tuesday."

EDITOR'S NOTE: This Is the second story In a three-part series examining the University's safety from fire hazards. Today's story will look at Notre Dame's insurance policy for buildings. 
Although some moderate fire damage is not covered by insurance and may be expensive for the University, Notre Dame's buildings are covered by a comprehensive insurance policy against more ex­tensive damage. 
"We have a manuscript policy for the University," said Charles S. Reddy, insurance officer for Notre Dame, ''which covers the buildings on campus and their contents against fire damage." The insur­ance policy also covers damage caused by weather and any vandal­
ism  on  buildings,  according  to  
Reddy.  
Reddy  said  a  rate  has  been  

negotiated for fires with the Pri­mary Insurance Company who "assumes part of the risk and who insures -with re-insurance." Reddy explained, "For example, we have millions of dollars of coverage. But the insurance company will -assume part of the cost and go to a reinsurance company."

Penalty board -formed 
by Paul Julin 

Dean of Students James Roemer has established a six-member ad­visory board providing input for students and faculty members on penalties given for disciplinary cases which come before the Dean's office. 
The Penalties Board will discuss types of penalties enforced for infractions of rules, according to Roemer. He said he will seek the board's opinion on using monetary fines, constructive work, commun­ity service, or "just plain hard work" as punishments. 
"The board will not deal with actual discplinarycases," Roemer stressed. He explained that due to the "necessity of students' pri­vacy" the board will discuss only hypothetical cases. The group will also give advice on penalty policies at the hall level and for the University in general, he said. 
Four students and two faculty members have been appointed to the board. The student members include Tom Byrne and Marianne Murphy, both seniors in Arts and

Letters; Rick VanBeveren, a senior in Business Administration and Mary Meg McCarthy, a sophomore also in Business Administration. 
Faculty members of the Penalty Board include James Seckinger, associate professor of law, and Lee Tavis, professor of finance and business economics. 
Byrne, who is Student Govern­ment Press Secretary, as well as a member of the board, explained that appointment of the board ''fulfills an oral agreement Roemer and the Board of Trustees made last fall with Student Government as part of the judicial code." 
Roemer said the board will discuss a policy which would impose a fine upon a student's account that must be paid before semester credits are given if an uncooperative student refuses to do work, such as setting up chairs and tables in the ACC, a traditional punishment. 
He calculated that "SO to 60 percent of behavioral problems on campus are alcohol related." Through discussions with the Pen­alties Board, Roemer hopes to [continued on page 3) 
PSC lifts ban on night sports; redefines human needs services 
INDIANAPOLIS [AlP] -The Indi­ana Public Service Commission (PSC) lifted its ban on night sports . events and placed them in a 40-percent curtailment category with all other recreational and entertainment activities as well as schools. 
In addition, the commission re­vised its definition of human needs services to allow utilities to meet the minimum needs of customers engaged in food production, distri­bution and storage. 
The modifications in the curtail­ment order, issued two weeks ago, were announced by PSC chairman Larry J. Wallace. He said the changes were designed to alleviate inequities in the original plan, which called for utilities to imple­ment electrical curtailments once their coal supplies dipped below the 40-day level. 
Wallace cautioned that the changes do not mean the coal emergency has passed. "The emergency wil continue until fuel supplies start to increase," he said. 
In fact, state officials now esti­mate the electric cuts will mean smaller paychecks for about:14,000 Hoosiers, not including 2,900 per­sons laid off for one day Monday at General Motor's Delco-Remy plant at Anderson and 2,500 RCA Workers at Marion. 
Bruce Meyer of the Indiana financially, Reddy explained. 
Under the University's. insurance policy, The Royal Globe Insurance Company, founded in England, acts as the reinsurance agent for the Primary Insurance Co. 
Morrissey fire notcovered 
Reddy revealed that since the value of damage incurred in the Morrissey Hall fire did not exceed the insurance-policy's deductible, the University had to assume financial responsibility for the dam­age. "The insurance policy is a replacement-cost plan," Reddy said. "It pays the cost of rep1acing an article." 
Although Reddy declined to state how much the University's deduct­ible was worth, he did say that the deductibles could run from $5,000 to $1 million. 
"The Morrissey fire and the fire in the Chemical Engineering build­ing some weeks ago will have to be paid for by the University," Reddy said. "The insurance sompany wouldn't enter into it. So the repair of these buildings causes a finan­cial burden on the University." 
Likewise. the University did not assume responsibility for the dam­aged property of the Morrissey fire victims. "When a fire occurs. the students will report the damage." Reddy indicated. "But it is the responsibiliey of each student to carry insurance for his property." 
Security Division's research and statistics office said some were indefinitely laid off, others were working fewer hours daily or fewer days each week and some were just temporarily idled by the coal strike. Meyer said the figure does not include 2,900 persons at Ander­son's Delco Electronics plant who were laid off for one day Monday. 
So far, mandatory power cuts indefinitely idled 3,900-4,000 Hoos­iers, including 300-400 persons laid off yesterday, he said. The newest layoffs were mainly school corpor­ation personnel and 100 employees at Kirk Glass Co. at Dunkirk. 
Yesterday's PSC action lifts an outright ban on ·all night sports events and the requirement that schools cut electric consumption in half. The change was based on testimony by representatives of the Department of Public Instruction, the Indiana Higher Education Com­mission as well as theater owners, bowling center proprietors . and owners of ice skating rinks, the commission decided to modify it. 
"These were minor adjustments that we felt were necessary," Wallace said. 
"It wasn't so much a matter of going along with the requests. It was a matter of going along with the evidence," he said. 
Most schools, he noted, were able to trim their electrical use by Premiums 
According to Reddy. the Univer­sity pays "hundreds of thousands of dollars each year" for the school's insurance policy. He add­ed, "It takes a lot of effort on the part of the University and the brokers to keep the premiums from increasing at the same rate of inflation." 
But the Morrissey fire will not cause the University's premiums to be any higher, he assured. 
When asked if the University's insurance policy is a good one. Reddy responded. "We have one of the finest policies for an educa­tional institution that exists today. I helped make it with a broker and we try to cover everything we can." 
One of the problems. however, that may arise. when the Univer­sity's policy does not cover the student's property is that the student may not receive total compensation for damaged items. 
Junior Jeff Thinnes, who lost most of his personal belongings in the Morrissey Hall fire last September, said that his insurance policy didn't 
entirely  cover  his  property  and  
belongings.  
"I  received  $1,950  from  my  

insurance company. but I came up a few hundred dollars short of my estimation," Thinnes said. 
Tomorrow: The Morrissey Fire cials of the Indiana and Michigan Electric Company to present rea­sons for keeping Saint Mary's open. 

"We will try io convince them to Jet us stay open if we run at SO percent power. At the most, we only need an extension of eleven days to make it to spring break," Duggan explained. 
I&M has said in the past that the earliest the College would be forced to close would be March 6. Duggan promised to keep students notified as further informaticn is made available. 
40-percent but no further and the order was changed to reflect that. Among those that had managed to cut their power consumption in half. he said, "we hope that they will continue in those conservation efforts." 
He conceded that the changes might allow high schools to hold bovs basketball tournaments that had been put in limbo by the curtailments. 
"All we care is that schools cut back by 40-percent ... \\'allace said. 
"What they do with that electricity would have to rest on their own conscience." 
At the commission's last meeting Friday, Northern Indiana Public Service Co. reported a 62-day supply of coal; Indianapolis Power & Light Co. had 59-days' worth; Southern Indiana gas & Electric Co. had 48 days; Public Service Indiana, which has implemented the curtailment order, had 44 days; while Indiana & Michigan Electric Co. and Hoosier Energy reported 40-days' supply. 
The curtailment order will not be lifted until the emergency has passed, he said. 
"We have to base our date on fuel supplies of utilities," Wallace said, rather than on the status of the ratification of the United Mine Workers (UMW) contract. [continued on page 3]

Migraine sufferers needed 

Persons who suffer from frequent migraine headaches can help re­searchers in the Psychology Dep­artment and perhaps themselves. 
Volunteers are needed now for research on migraine headaches. The research will evaluate the dfcctiveness of different treat­~JCnts designed to alleviate head­Jche pain. 

All training will consist of teach­ing participants self-control over physiological responses, although participants will be allowed to continue taking medication if they wish. 
Upon completion of this research, all participants will receive training in the treatment found to be most effective.

Coal negotiations continue 

Washington [API --Coal operators and union representatives returned to the scene of their negotiating skirmishes yesterday to preview the new contract aimed at settling the protacted \coal strike. 
Two groups met separately but conducted their <;essions in the same room at the Capital Hilton Hotel. Members of the 130-mem­ber Bituminous Coal Operators Association (BCOA) met first and heard the terms of the tentative three-year contract outlined in an hour long session. 
The coal operators would not say how they felt about the proposed deal their negotiators had made with the United Mine Workers (UMW). 
BCOA President Joseph Brennan said members of the association will vote on the proposal sometime later in the week but no date has been set. 
Although the coal operators re­fused to talk about the proposal, their approval seems assured. Union representatives, however, 
Alumnae weekend scheduled 
were less certain about the reaction of the UMW's 160,000 miners, 
whose strike enters  its  85th day  
today.  
Some  400 miners  and  district  

representatives attended the un­ion's contract session. The repres­entatives, who must sell the pro­posal to the rank and file later this week, walked into the hotel room as the coal operators walked out. 
UMW President Arnold Miller said he\ was upset about what he called premature criticism of the proposal agreed upon last Friday by union and coal company negota­tiors. "Ithink the comments of this vocal minority are totally unwar­ranted, "Miller said. "How can they criticize the proposal befor they've even seen it." 
Miller said he was still optimistic that the majority of the rank and file coal miners will approve the proposal when they vote on it thh~ Saturday and Sunday. 
In another development, White House press secretary Jody Powell said the Carter administration did

Kelly and Jones both see the weekend as an informal time to learn a great deal about experience encountered during preparation for a career and after graduation. "I think it's a great opportunity for women at Notre Dame to talk to alumnae in their fields to get their perspectives on careers, especially balancing careers with marriages and families," Kelly stated. "It should be especially interesting because these are women who graduated from Notre Dame when it was f~ven harder to make '' she added.

Motion to occupy Canal defeated 
Washington [AP]--The Panama Canal treaties suvived a crucial test yesterday when the Senate killed an amendment that would have allowed American troops to be stationed in the Canal Zone for 20 years after the waterway is turned over to the Panamians. 

The amendment, which provided the first test of strength on a substantive issue since the debate on the treaties began, was tabled by a vote of 55-34. 
The Senate also rejected 58-26 an amendment saying that the Endlish language version of the treaties would take precedence id there were any disareement between it and the Spanish language version. 

Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), spon­sor of the language amendment, argued there are 200-300   ambi­guities and difficulties" between the English and Spanish versions of the treaties. 
Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.), said State Department language experts went over the language of the English and Spanish versions and "the two tt:xts were brought into harmony.'' 
In another development, Sen. Robert T. Stafford (R-Vt.) an­nounced h1~ would support the treaty if it contains an amendment that incorporates into the pact an understanding between President Carter andl Panamanion leader Omar Torrijos on U.S. rights in the Canal Zone after the waterway is turned over to Panama. 
Last week treaty opponents failed in a procedural maneuver aimed at reversing the order in which the 
Busing appeal denied by Court 
WASHINGTON [API -The Su­preme Court, denying an appeal from Kentucky, said yesterday that the federal government does not have to help pay the costs of court-ordered busing to achieve racially desegregated public schools. 
The justices rejected without comment an appeal by Kentucky Gov. Julian M. Carroll seeking permission to ask for federal help in paying for busing in the Louis­ville area, one of hundreds of school districts across the nation carrying out court-ordered busing. 
The court's action bars, at least for now. any hope other state and local schools districts may have had to get such federal help. 
A racial desegregation plan in effect since 1975 for schools in Louisville and surrounding Jeffer­~on County, Ky., has made neces­sary the daily busing of some 
23.000 students. 
"The drain on state and local funds .. .is quite real and devasta­ting," Carroll's appeal said. 
The governor had challenged the constitutionality of three federal laws prohibiting federal funding of busing for desegregation. A federal judge in Louisviile and a federal appeals court already had upheld the laws. 

In urging the court to turn down Kentucky's argument, the Carter administration argued that the federal government is under no obligation to help defray desegre­gation costs. 
"Indeed, states may well be less likely to violate a citizen's rights today if it means paying the costs of making good those rights in the future," the Justice Department told the court. 
In other matters, the court:
Reversed two tower courts and ruled that residents of Puerto Rico 
ue not entitled to Supplemental
Security Income payments which 

I 
I ~hey recieved while living in the that benefits enjoyed in one state will follow the traveler. 
Government lawyers had sought the reversal, telling the high court that SSI payments to Puerto Rico residents would exceed $300 mil­lion a year and "threaten to disrupt Puerto Rico's already ailing econ­omy." -Let stand a ruling that federal courts may force the government to speed up settlements of disputed Social Security benefit claims. 
Health, Education and Welfare Secretary Joseph A. Califano had asked the court to overturn the ruling, contending that it "threat­
ens signifi<:antly" to disrupt his 
ability to administer Social Security 
benefits nationwide "in an even­
handed and orderly manner.'' 
-Left intact two lower court deci­
sions orderiing construction to be­
gin on a long-delayed and contro­
versial housing project for low 
income families in a residential 
section of south Philadelphia. The 
court's action appeared to clear the 
way for start of construction on the 
Whitman Townhous.e ~ct. 
-Refused to interfere with pnLe 
ceilings imJPOsed by the federal 
government for natural gas sold 
across state lines. 
Senate takes up the treaties. By a 67-30 vote the Senate refused to conside a pact aimed at ensuring the neutrality of the Canal Zone ahead of the agreement providing for the Uniter States to relinquish the waterway to Panama. 
Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd had characterized the troop proposal voted down yesterday as a "killer amendment." 
The West Virginia Democrat said it was not necessary for the security of the canal, and that the prolonged presence of American troops "would result in the kind of hostile atmosphere we want to avoid." 
"Sen. James B. Allen (D-Ala.), chief sponsor of the amendment, said he was encouraged by the vote tabulation even though the amend­ment was defeated. 
"Senators are becomin more independent,'' said Allen of the 34 lawmakers who voted against tabl­ing the amendment. Because two thirds of the members of the Senate present and voting must support the treaties, 34 of the 100 law­makers could block ratification. 
On the other hand, Senate Demo­cratic Whip Alan Cranston of California called the outcome "Bet­ter than we expected. Our confi­dence is shown by the fact that we proceed with the vote although some of our votes were not here." 
Allen had argued that authority to keep troops in the Canal Zone for an additional 20 years was neces­sary for security reasons. He said the treaty's security provisions , including the requirement for with­drawal of all troops by 2000, "give us the right but deprives us of the means" to defend the waterway.

Children needed for campus choir 
Children from the third grade to the sixth grade are being recruited for a Children's Choir from the families of the Saint Mary's and 'olotre Dame campus by Fr. Robert 
r. Griffin. the University Chaplain. 
This choir will be trained to sing at 

l'ampus liturgies to which they may 
be invited. The musical director "·ill be Miss Joyce Schemanske, jircctor of liturgical music at Saint \llary's. 
An organizational meeting will be 1cld Thursday, at 3:30p.m., in the .(nights of Columbus building next u the bookstore. Information

"This choir," Griffin said, "should not be confused with the Urchins' Mass. There will be urchins in the Choir, and moppets too; but aside from urchinry and moppetry, this is a group who will take music seriously. 

"My hope is that there can be a ministry of music by the children to whoever would enjoy the sound of children singing," he added. ·'Children wishing to apply should call me or come to the meeting at the K. of C. building Thursday."

TOUCH of O'NEILL 
Eugene O'Neill's "A Touch of the Poet" is about many things and touches many aspects of the experiences which we share as human beings. But the aspect that struck me the most, I suspect partly because I am a second semester senior, is the theme of dreams and the dreamer that pervades the play. 
"A Touch" centers around one day in the life of Cornelius Melody (Jack Camp­bell) and his family and friends--July 27, 1828. Melody owns a tavern in a small village a few miles from Boston which is being managed by his wife, Nora (Michele Roberge) and his daughter, Sara (Lisa Turco). Money is tight and the Melodies owe money to practically everyone in sight--the grocery store, the mortgage holder, and the feed store. Cornelius (known to his friends as "Con"), however, conceives of himself as a gentleman and a war hero and refuses to engage in the nitty-gritty of owning and running a tavern. Instead he rides his mare for hours on end, tells stories of how he was born in a castle "on the finest estate in the United Kingdom", and recounts his heroic adven­tures at the battle of Tallavera--where, nineteen years before, he had fought with "his majesty's Seventh Dragoon." 
Cornelius is a "dreamer", not in the sense of hoping in some future condition, but in the sense of one who lives in an imaginary world of the past. Cornelius, to use a common phrase, is living in a "dream-world." During the play we receive hints that he was not a very important figure in the battle he recounts, that he was expelled from the army because he tried to seduce a Spanish woman. "My future is in the past," Cornelius tells in Act Two, indicating that his conception of himself as an aristocrat is both of a self and an age that has ceased to exist. He is now in America and in an age that thinks little of aristocratic pretensions. In 1828 Andrew Jackson was elected President as a "man of the common folk." In addition, when Cornelius speaks of his future being in the past, he touches as we11 on the fact that the ''future", as a place or vision where one is headed, has meaning only for the young. For the old, the future is already deter­mined, the decisions of youth play them­selves out, and the aged are left to confront the reality of their lives with the dreams of their youth, 
Nora Melody, Cornelius' wife, aged and stooped from many years of back-breaking 
by Karl Kronebusch 

She thinks she has found this love with Simon Harford, who is himself a dreamer-­living alone out in the woods, contempla­ting nature and life, and then writing his book. Sara thinks that marrying him is her "one chance to rise in the world." Just like her father and mother, she dreams of rising, of advancing, ·of approaching conceptions of the ideal life, lover and livelihood we ca11 "dreams." 
In Act Four, Con finally gives up his aristocratic dreams, stops quoting Lord Byron, and shoots the mare that was the symbol of his gentle dreams. He stops his attempt to live the life of an English nobleman and drops his imitation of the speech of the gentry and resumes his native Irish brogue. He vows to stay in his labor for the service of her husband, feels such a confrontation. She had dreamed of upward mobility, of castles and carriages, of riches and finery and had married Con out of those dreams and out of the dream of love which she defines as "when you don't give a care for all the ifs and want-tos of your life." She is meek and saintly, never hesitating to sacrifice· herself for her husband or daughter. Hers is a very Christian self-sacrifice, an almost total self-abdegnation, that hopes for eternal happiness in heaven. But she despairs that her "sin" is the cause of all of Con's troubles. _ 
Sara Melody, the daughter of Con and Nora, dreams, too. She dreams of love-­that eternal curse and blessing of the human race. Her dream of love is to find a love that "gives me freedom not slavery." 
This jazz will neuer smell 
Frank Zappa once said, "Jazz is not 

deaditjustsmellsfunny.That was in 1974--a 
year of Herbie Hancock & Headhunters, 
Chick Corea & Return to Forever, and John 
McLaughlin & the Mahavishnu Orchestra. 
Now, I had always respected Francis as in 
institution in jazz (despite his basso grosso 
stage antics and his much-too-adagio 
moustache), but this time I had to 
disagree. I was convinced that jazz-rock 
would carry on th tradition of America's 
only true musical art form. Jazz would 
never "smell funny." 
Three years later, I found myself starting 

to sniff. Jazz-rock was turning into 
jazz-disco-Bob James and Stanley Turren­
tine were doing to jazz what new-wavers 
were doing to rock. And like all trash, it 
started to stink. 
Credit two men for saving jazz from an 

esoteric future: Herbie Hancock, with his 
V.S.O.P. double-albums, restated the pur­ity and validity of jazz-rock; and Norman Granz, producer for Pablo Records, brought the old jazz greats back in a blaze of glory called The Art of The Jam Session. 
"I've always felt that the jam session was the foundation of jazz," wrote Granz. The jam session is, indeed, what the concept of jazz is all about: musical improvisation, the transfer of human emotion into instrumental language, and the spontaneous generation of living, feeling atmosphere on stage. You'll never find that atmosphere in a New York disco, or on a slick, glossy, studio-recorded album, or at a stylized, choreographed, light-enhanced rock concert. Only with the 
jam session. And what better place to 
record true jazz that in Switzerland during 
the Mantreaux Jazz Festival. 
Granz took the Mountain Recording crew to Montreaux the week of July 10, 1977, and walked away with 14 albums scheduled for release, one a 2-lp set. Seven of these albums were reissued in The Montreaux Collection 1977; the other eight make-up The Art of The Jam Session (Pablo 2620-106), an eight record collection of the finest live jazz to be sent to the record stores in a decade. Included in this Pablo masterpiece are many of the greatest jazz musicians still alive, (I hate lists, but here goes): Oscar Peterson, Monty Alexander, Count Basie (piano); Dizzy Gillespie, Jon Faddis, Roy Eldridge (trumpet); Clark Terry(trumpet & flugelhorn); Vic Dicken­son, AI Grey (trombone); Benny Carter (alto Sax); Milst Jackson (vibes); Joe Pass(electric guitar); Niels Pederson, Ray Brown (acoustic bass); Bobby Druham, Jimmie Smith (drums). 
Record One, Side One, Cut One: a tune which sets the tempo for this amazing collection, "Ali and Frazier" by the Oscar Peterson Group. Dizzy Gillespie and Clark Terry beat each other with their horns while Oscar peels the ivory off the Bosendorfer concert grand. Highlighted is the amazing and, sadly, unknown Niels­Henning, Orsted Pederson, who easily gets the award for the fastest bass solo ever recorded. Follow that with numbers like "Things Ain't What They Used To Be," featuring the smooth-as-silk tenor of "lockjaw" Davis, and a version of "Mack The Knife'' that sends the Darren and. Sinatra renditions to the wastecan. 
Next up is the Milt Jackson/Ray Brown Jam. "Slippery" and "C.M.J." prove that Jackson belongs in the same class as Lionel Hampton and Gary Burton. "You are My Sunshine" gives everyone a shot at the solo mike, including the mellow Terry on flugelhorn and Davis' satiny sax. "That's The Way It Is"features Monty Alexander's incredible keyboards, plus one of the greatest bassists of all time, Ray Brown, Clark Terry also entertains with occasional scat singing.
Peterson, Jackson, and Pederson sparkle

during the Pablo All Stars Jam. Check out 
Bobby Durham on drums (I don't know 
how he keeps up with Oscar and Niels). 
Also note guitarist Joe Pass, who usually 
performs solo; he is the epitome of grac~ 
on "Samba De Orfeu." A surprise is tenor 
sax-man Ronnie Scott (of the London jazz 
club of the same name), who rarely is 
recorded while jamming. Other selections 
in this set include "Cote d'Azur," a very 
impressive "Pennies From Heaven," and 
Billie Holiday's "God Bless the Child," 
featuring a spirited solo by Terry. 
Brown, Alexander and Jimmie Smith 
provide the rhythm for the Dizz & Co. This 
jam is an exhausting duel between Mr.. 
Jowls and Jon Faddis, the energy of the 
younger only debatably outdone by the 
ageless Gillespie. Numero Uno in this set 
is the medley, "Once In A While/But 
Beautiful/Here's That Rainy Day."

on stage. The mikes often picked up joking 
and other nonsense in the background~­
something characteristic of many Basie 
recordings. "Bookie Blues" throws the 
forgotten Zoot Sims into the forefront 
where he belongs. Trombonists AI Grey 
and Vic Dickenson are beautiful compleme­
ments to each other throughout the jam. 

But by far, the most enjoyable cuts are 
"Trio Blues" and "Jumpin' At The 
Woodside." "Trio Blues" is a recorded 
rarity (Basie rarely performs in trio) and is 
highlighted by the Count's impish tinkling 
on piano. Basie is not as fast as, say, 
Peterson, but where Oscar delights with 
dazzling runs, Basie highlights and amuses 
with his famous sprinkling of the keys. 

Follow that with "Jumpin' At The Wood­
side," a fast little melody not unlike a 
Gong Show and ND b-ball home game 
classic. 

Record 8 features Oscar Peterson on piano with bassists Ray Brown and Niels Pederson. Brown and Pederson attempted the bass duet during the 1975 Pablo Europe Jazz Festival, but the effect was muddled and confusing. At Pederson's suggestion, the two bass greats traded licks while accompanying the piano. This resulted in an unusual and exciting set of Oscar's graceful chords, Niels' short, lchoppy passages, and Ray's full, booming tones. Particularly noteworthy are "You Look Good To Me," "Reunion Blues," in which Pederson and Brown play a section together, and the classic ''Sweet Georgia 
Brown," which sports a solo by Oscar. 

The Art Of The Jam Session: 4 hours, 53 
minutes and 51 seconds of jazz in its purest 
form. You can tag all the old cliches on this 
Norman Granz production--amazing, mon­
umental, exciting, timely--but they're not 
adequate. Granz went out on a limb with 
the Pablo 1977 Montreaux series. A great 
deal of time and money went into the 
recording, production, and distribution of 
this collection. The 1977 Montreaux series 
is perhaps Granz's biggest gamble: 14 
albums cost the consumer big bucks; so do 
multiple-record sets at $40-plus a chunk 
(such as The Art Of The Jam Session]. 

And with jazz no longer in the forefront of 
musical popularity,Pablo'smassive record­
ing session could have easily been one big 
monetary flor. 

The Art 0 The Jam Session is a major documentary of a milestone event, and follows the Pablo tradition of recording some of the finest music ever written--per­formed by some of the finest musicians in the world. f h .
If any o t ese sets sutts your fancy, snatch up the individual release. But if you want to make a true investment in art, The Art Of The Jam Session is a must. It's got high-quality production, high-quality artists...and, best of all, high-quality

Con's dreams had had an obvious sense of dishonesty about them, a dishonesty immediately recognizable. However, the audience at the end of the play must still wonder about the status of the other dreams--the religious self-sacrificing dreams of Nora, and Sara's dreams of love. They, like Con's dreams, may also be inaccessible, unachievable. Approaching the future, it seems, we need dreams and visions, but those dreams will ultimately remained unfulfilled.

Local IRS expects long linfes 
Students consulting the South Bend Internal Revenue Service (IRS) at 1317 Mishawaka Ave. for assistance with filing tax returns this year may have a long wait. Last tax filing period. 5,694 people stopped by the local IRS office for help. Many faced a long wait. 
"This year, it could be worse," said James Christopher, of the IRS headquarters office in Indianapolis. "We project waiting times for many offices will exceed an hour this year." 
Christopher, head of Taxpayer Service Division, explained. "We think we'll get more people need­ing help because of tax law changes 

~ in the last few years. This would mean longer waits." 
He suggests that taxpayers check the instructions in their tax package. If still in need of assis­tance, persons should call ms on any of their toll-free telephone lines. Christopher said IRS is trying to discourage people from coming to their offices unnecessarily, be­cause IRS can help them faster on the telephone. He noted IRS can give aid to four tel,:phone callers in the time it takes to help one taxpayer in person. 
Last year .there werl· complaints about ho1.1. long it took IHS to answer the phones. Christopher explained that "during peak traf­fic, we receive 7,000 to 8,000 calls a day. That averages one call every four seconds. So there arc times when you'll get a busy signal or a recording." 
"Waiting for 30 seconds on the phone seems like forever, but it's quicker than travelling to an IRS office, maybe waiting an hour, and travelling home," he noted. 
All toll-free calls from Indiana got to the Indianapolis oftice, where 74 employees spend their eight-hour .day answering tax­payers' questions. This contrasts 'iharply with the three employees. assigned to the South Bend office

Shyness workshops planned

The counseling departments of Saint Mary's and Notre Dame are offering a sequence of eight ninety­minute workshops on coping with shyness. Gail Ritchie, SMC assist­ant director of counseling, and Michael Mond, assistant profes­sional specialist of ND's Psycholog­ical Services Center, will conduct the sessions. 
We sense there's a need for this," Ritchie explained. "We know that most people do experi­ence shyness in their lives. We're attempting to teach the skills necessary to enhance social rela­

Carter welcomes governors for energy talks 
W ASBINGTON [AP] -President Carter welcomed the nation's governors to join in formulation of energy policy yesterday but said the ultimate decisions are global in character and will not be easy. 
Carter welcomed the governors te a White House coaference on en«gy production, sayilag he was "*Y gnteful to have you joiR in" 011 what 1te called "one of the most important questions that our nation faces." 
"It is not something that is an exclusive federal program as you well know," Carter told the ga­thering. "And the answers are not exclusively here in Washington." 
Carter said no matter what the federal or state governments may decide in response to the pressures on them, "the future energy cir-
Prlnster family donates gift 
A $300,000 gift from members of the Prinster family will enable Notre Dame to help gifted but needy students. 
The Prinster Scholarship Fund will eventually provide financial assistance to students in each of the four undergraduate years. The gift comes from Mr. and Mrs. Joseph C. Prinster; Mr. and Mrs. Leo T. Prinster; Ms. Martha Prinster; Mr. and Mrs. Frank Prinster, and Mrs. Josephine Prinster DeOnier. 
The Prinsters, who have had two sons and a daughter of the family graduate from Notre Dame, oper­ate the City Market Stores, a grocery chain headquartered in Grand Junction, CO. 
In accepting the benefaction, Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh, University president, said, "As the costs of education have esculated, Notre Dame has been hard-pressed to fill the gap between those costs and the students' to pay. The Prinsters 
generous gift will help insure that the most qualified students attend here, regardless of their financial resources." 
The University's five-year devel­opment effort, The Campaign for Notre Dame, is seeking $12 million to meet the cost of student financial aid. To date, more than $83 million has been pledged toward the Campaign's $130 million overall 
oal. 
cumstances are going to be shaped 
pervasively by what other people 
around the world decide." 
The president, whose initial en­

in Congress for months, said he 
still felt there was general agree­

alainst developlleftt needs, and "a 
shift from rapidly fpleting

more plentiful in supply.'' 
The govenwrs had gone into the 
meeting pressing demands for 
federal action to step up energy 
production and for less federal 
intederence in their own develop­
ment efforts.. 

The White House meeting, sec­
ond in a two-day conference on energy production, followed a speech by Secretary of State Cyrus ~ Vance which called fer promotion of domestic energy to relieve the 
dependence on Arab oil . 
The governors expressed the same concern to Carter, saying "It is essential that we develop all possible sources of domestic oil and gas consistent with our environ­meatal goals, to protect ourselves against future embargoes atUltel­lew 115 to meet ovt fuel aeeds:"

"We must take the difficult steps that are required to re4uce eur , requirements for imported oil and to promote the development of other energy sources," Vance said. Vance also said the administra­tion will not yield to protectionist demands from some elements of labor and industry being hurt by

One of the nation's leading ac­counting firms, Coopers and Ly­brand, announced support today of a $100,000 faculty research fellow­ship in the College of Business Administration. 
Brother Leo V. Ryan, dean of the College and Robert W. Williamson, Jr., chairman of the department of Accountancy, said the gift would support a faculty member for concentrated research on a specific project. The project will be approved in advance by competi­tion within the faculty and recom­mended by a faculty committee. 
At the same time, the accounting firm has designated Notre Dame as one of ten target universities in the country for accelerated recruiting and support. 
Representatives of the firm have made periodic visits to the campus in an effort to recruit senior accountancy students in the past. 
Monetary gifts of graduates em­ployed by the firm are matched by Coopers and Lybrand. 
Preliminary planning for the Coopers and Lybrand fellowship provides for released time and research funds for the faculty member selected to conduct the project. 
It is expected the project would be
