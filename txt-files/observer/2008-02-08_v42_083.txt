THE 
GRC launches new-gender group 
Men of Strength seek to examine masculinity, sexuality at Notre Dame 
By KATIE PERALTA 
News Writer 
In accordance with its recent efforts to examine sexuality and faith of the Notre Dame student commu­nity, the Gender Relations Center (GRC) is sponsoring a men's support group, .set to have its first meeting Feb. 13. 
It will meet every Wednesday through April 30. 

The group, called Men of Strength (MOS), is the brain­child of second year Masters of Divinity graduate student Brian Vassel, who is also a GHC intern. 
Vassel, who minored in theology and English during his undergraduate years at Notre Dame, came up with 
the idea for MOS last spring. 

Masters of Divinity stu­dents are required to com­plete three years of field education after graduation, Vassel said. His first year credit came from his tenure in Carroll Hall as an assis­tant rector, his second year credit will come from creat­ing MOS. 
Vassel said he thought of the support group after con­sidering his undergraduate experience at Notre Dame. 
"Sexuality and spirituality came up a lot," he said. "In this group, men can come to integrate their faith and sex­uality." 
The name of the group comes from the passage in 2 Corinthians 12:10, which reads: "For when I am weak, then I am strong," said

Siegfried holds Day of Man for homeless 
Dorm residents don shorts, sandals in second annual campus benefit for South Bend charity 
By MAGGIE HAGAN 
News Writer 
While most students battle the frigid South Bend winters with snow boots, fleece hats, gloves and parkas, 133 men from Siegfried Hall stripped down to their summer clothes for the second annual "Day of Man," an event to raise money for the South Bend Center for the Homeless. 
More than half of Siegfried's residents spent the day walk­ing around campus in red T­shirts, shorts and flip flops. The idea was to show their sol­idarity with the homeless, who often have minimal garments to protect themselves from the snow. 
The participants walked around with plastic cups for donations, and they stood out­side North Dining Hall at din­ner to try to rake in some extra cash for the charity. 
Robbie Bernardin, a junior, thought of the event last year as he walked from Farley to Siegfried dressed much the same way as many of the Day of Man participants. 
"I was freezing, but I felt like a real man," Bernadin said. 
He began brainstorming with his roommate about ways they could test their ability to with­stand cold temperatures. They eventually came up with the idea of doing something to benefit a charity, and the

to transfer course packet sales to the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore and to move the copy­right review process to an exter­nal corporation. 
"It became clear we needed to respond to this issue in a timely and practical fashion and in a way that was representative of how the student body felt," Braun said. 
She told the trustees that the Student Senate's Academic Affairs Committee surveyed more than 1,000 students to learn more about the popular opinion regard­ing the issue.

ND gives little cash to hopefuls 
Edwards gets most donations from campus 
By KEN FOWLER 
News Writer 
Notre Dame's professors and students are donating less money to presidential cam­paigns than their peers are. 
An Observer analysis of feder­al campaign finance records reveals that with half a year remaining before the Democratic and Republican national conventions, students and employees of the University are lagging behind similar-sized schools in donations to presi­dential campaigns. 
Fifteen Notre Dame employ­ees and students had given a combined $4,033 to presidential campaigns, while fourteen donors from Boston College had given more than $11,000 -and nearly 50 people from Duke University had combined to donate more than $50,000 to campaigns. The disparity was similar when compared to other elite schools. 
The government requires donors to list their employer and profession when donating to presidential campaigns, and campaigns had to file their finance statements from the final quarter of 2007 this week. The Observer crosschecked the Notre Dame employees listed on the government documents with the University's directory.

Committee. 
She cited the South Bend Common Council's proposed party permit ordi­
nance as the best example of an unantici­pated situa­tion that required attention. But because 

he.r October Brown bnefing was devoted to a discussion of the ordinance and community rela­tions, Brown focused Thursday on the other pressing events. 
These included the increase in prices for course packets, a surge of student interest in environmen­tal issues and the need for a modi­fied follow-up to the Notre Dame Forum on immigration in the fall. 
The increase in course packet prices, Brown said, was an issue her administration had to deal with after many students and fac­ulty members started complain­ing. 
Student body vice president Maris Braun said that on average, prices increased by more than 35 percent from the previous year ­a result of the University's decision 
Heather Hakoczy, director of the GRC and supervisor of Vassel's initiative since August. 
The two researched if Vassel's group would interest Notre Dame students would be interested by interviewing undergraduate men. 
"We wanted to get the pulse of the Notre Dame cul­ture," Rakoczy said. 
After receiving enough pos­itive feedback, the pair planned the implementation of the group early last fall. 
"There are three main thrusts of the group," Vassel said, "Share, pray and sup­port." 
While the group is rooted strongly in its Catholic tradi­tion, it's open to men of all

Hail to the Chief 

Like the Saint Mary's executive stu­dent body president and vice-presi­dent, Chris Hine recently ran unop­posed in and won the election for Editor in Chief for The Observer's 2008-2009 term. Maybe Katie Peralta he ran unopposed News Production because he Editor intimidated the compe­tition. Maybe it was because no one else wanted to run. Or maybe it was because he was endorsed by the likes of Oprah, Chuck Norris, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
I can say now that I feel more than honored to be writing this ... and no, Chris is no longer standing over my shoulder. 
I was first introduced to this fine 

individual back in December, when I 
was informed that he would be my 
date to The Observer's annual holi­
day office party. 
"Hey, are you Chris?" I asked the strapping fellow sitting behind me onn night at work. 
"Yes, you must be Katie. Guess what? I am missing a knuckle on my left hand," replied Chris, holding up a left hand with the fourth finger about the same length as the pinky linger. 
"Wow, are you serious?" lie was. Serious as the ulcer BMac gives Kyle Cassily. 
This was my first impression of our new Master and Commander. Since his inception as leader of the finest nnwsprint this side of the Mississippi (sorry Karen, I am editorializing), Chris has thus far implemented sev­eral of his promised initiatives for his minions down in the basement of South Dining Hall. 
Chris recently installed hot tubs for the genflfal use of Observer staffers, which is why you may have noticed many of us are spending far more hours down here in the Swamp. This makes those long 12-hour shifts far more bearable -desirable even. 
Chris has also made major improvements on the entertainment that many staffers wanted, particu­larly those who were fed up with South Park and SportsCenter. He recently installed twenty brand new XBox 360s on which subordinates may engage in Halo, FIFA, and NCAA 
Chris's philosophy is that as long as you keep winning, you do not have to work, but if you lose you have to work. And you get paid by the win. Now you see why we run those Write News ads? 
Additionally, Chris has erected a gourmet Texas steak house right across from Shirley the office manag­er's office. Chris accepts nothing but the highest quality for his faithful staff, which is why he has also switched out The Observer's ancient swirly chairs for new state-of-the-art Sharper Image massage chairs. 
To say that I feel fortunate to call Christopher my superior is an under­statement. Look out, Hillary. Here comes !line.

Seemingly Immaculate Komodos hatched 
WICHITA, Kan. -Two Komodo dragons have hatched at the Sedgwick County Zoo, apparently without the fertilization of a male. The dragons, both males, are believed to be the first in North America known to have hatched by parthenogenesis, which occurs naturally in some species, including inverte­brates and lower plants. It happens more rarely in some vertebrates. 
Two other known cases in which Komodo dragons hatched by parthenogene­sis were at the London and Chester zoos in England in 2006. 
The zoo in Wichita is having DNA testing done to document the mother's and the babies' genetic structure because of the remote chance that a male's sperm was stored on the female's body.

School pulls spiked hot chocolate recipe 
WEST DES MOINES, Iowa -Officials at a junior high school spiked an edi­tion of the student newspa­per because it contained a recipe for hot chocolate that included peppermint schnapps. 
The January edition of Stillwell Junior High School's quarterly Tiger Tracks was pulled off the racks when the boozy recipe was discovered, Principal Tim Miller said. A student at the West Des Moines school submitted the recipe, which slipped through the editing process, Miller said.

Native American minor considered 
By AMBER TRAVIS News Writer 
Members of the Notre Dame Multicultural Affairs Committee have been working on a pro­posal for the creation of a Native American Studies minor at the University. 
Lai-Nin Wan, chairwoman of the Multicultural Affairs Committee, said past students felt that they were not learning anything about their Native American heritage. The com­mittee created a survey, which was randomly distributed to 900 students as a way to get further feedback about the potential minor. 
The survey, which had four parts, contained one section about the possible Native American Studies minor. Wan said that her committee would like to present the results of the survey to Student Senate by the middle of February. 
She said that the committee was· unsure about the exact elements of the minor because the plan was still in its early stages. 
"We are basically going to try and structure it in the same way as a number of other minors at the University," Wan said. "Right now we're search­ing for a department to sponsor us, and once we get the results back from our survey we'll be able to proposition [the senateI better." 
Wan said that a Native American Studies minor would be important to the University. 
"The reason why we wanted this minor is because it is something that Notre Dame doesn't have, and we feel that we do need to have it," she said. "In a structural way it's absolutely different from other cultural minors. It's different in that it's addressing a complete­ly different population. It would not only be for the Native American students, but it would be for the Notre Dame population in general." 
Co-president of the Native American Studies Association of Notre Dame (NASAND) Anthony Holt agreed with Wan. 
"I think it's a great idea," Holt said. "I think [there are] a lot of Native Americans who would be very interested in programs and classes that would be offered at the University." 
Being involved with NASAND has given Holt the opportunity to interact with a variety of people from different tribes and backgrounds, he said, but there are few Native American resources or classes offered at the University besides the group.

Donations 
continued from page I 

Through December, former Democratic candidate John Edwards, who withdrew from the race before Super Tuesday, led in donations from Notre Dame. Edwards had raised $1,400 from four University employees and students. Democratic Sen. Barack Obama raised $943 from four such indi­viduals, and Congressman Ron Paul, R-Texas, was third with $540 from three people. 
Rachel Getman, a graduate assistant in chemical and bio­molecular engineering, is one of Paul's donors. 
"When I finally heard he was running for president, that real­ly excited me," Getman said. " ... I will donate to any campaign that I believe will better the political and economic condi­tions of the country." 
Paul, however, has not yet won a state in the Republican primaries and caucuses. But even if Paul fails to win the Republican nomination, Getman believes her donation could make a significant impact in getting out Paul's libertarian message -thus helping future candidates of a similar belief set. 
"While the goal ultimately is to get a 'Hon Paul' elected, it will take some time to transition from electing the bureaucratic politician," Getman said. 
In past elections, donation totals have been a fairly accu­rate indicator of a candidate's chances success. But this elec­tion cycle has proven the corre­lation not to be definite. 
The top two donors on the Republican side, Mitt Romney and Hudy Giuliani, combined to raise more than $150 million by the end of 2007. But with Romney's withdrawal Thursday, Sen. John McCain, who has raised a relatively small total of $42 million, became the Hepublican front-runner.

now fighting Obama's momentum. According to the data released this week by the Federal Election Commission, Clinton had raised more than $118 million to Obama's nearly $104 million. 
Professor Catherine Perry, who is a fellow of the Nanovic Institute for European Studies and the Kroc Institute for International Peace, was the only person at Notre Dame that donated to Clinton. 
Perry said she donated both time and money to Howard Dean's campaign in 2003 and 2004, but doesn't have the time now to be personally involved with the Clinton campaign. She said that when she hears a can­didate asking for money, she takes it seriously because of the costs necessarily involved in a nationwide campaign. 
Though Perry typically doesn't discuss her support for Clinton among other faculty members, she feels strongly that "after the last seven.. years, we really need a change. 
But why donate? 

"It's a measure of how com­mitted we are for change," Perry said. "I do feel personally responsible to support a candi­date." 
Brian Duffy, a junior from Iowa, had similar thoughts about why he donated to the Paul campaign. 
"He's definite­
ly the candidate 
thought he was a genuine can­didate." 
Duffy said he was upset that Paul's libertarian message had not changed the debate among the other Hepublican candi­dates, but Duffy was happy that his money was used to "raise the consciousness" of the public to Paul's ideas. 
Duffy donated to Paul's cam­paign in September, before the congressman's popularity soared and campaign contribu­tions followed suit. Duffy said he probably would not have donat­ed had Paul already raised the $28 million he has now, but that donating before the bandwagon picked up members is like find­ing a "little-known band." 
"It's like, 'Hey, I was one of the first ones there,"' Duffy said, "and then it kind of turned into a big thing."

Archbishop calls for limited Shariah 
LONDON -The archbishop of Canterbury on Thursday called for a limited application of Islamic law in Britain. Muslims praised the pro­posal but the government rejected it. 
The unusual suggestion from Britain's highest ranking Christian leader would, if adopted, allow British Muslims to choose to resolve mari­tal and financial disputes under Islamic law, known as Shariah, rather than through British courts. 
Archbishop Howan Williams said in a radio interview with British Broadcasting Corp. that incorporating Islamic law could help improve Britain's llagging social cohesion. 
"Certain provisions of Shariah are already rec­ognized in our society and under our law, so it's not as if we're bringing in an alien and rival sys­tem," said Williams, who gave a speech on the topic Thursday night. 
Prime Minister Gordon Brown's spokesman immediately rejected Williams' proposal.

CIA head debates waterboarding 
WASHINGTON -Debate over waterboarding flared Thursday on Capitol Hill, with the CIA director raising doubts about whether it's current­ly legal and the attorney general refusing to inves­tigate U.S. interrogators who have used the tech­nique on terror detainees. 
Vice President Dick Cheney, meanwhile, said "it's a good thing" that top al-Qaida leaders who underwent the harsh interrogation tactic in 2002 and 2003 were forced to give up information that helped protect the country. 
"It's a good thing we had them in custody, and it's a good thing we found out what they knew," Cheney told the Conservative Political Action ConffJrence in Washington. 

Democratic fundraising intensifies 
NEW ORLEANS -Battling for every dollar and delegate, Barack Obama raised $7.2 million in Super Tuesday's wake and Hillary Rodham Clinton pulled in $6.4 million, stunning totals reflecting the intensity of their neck-and-neck race for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
Keenly aware of Obama's growing strength, Clinton challenged him to five debates in the next month. Obama put her off. 
"We'll have some debates," Obama promised. But first, he said, "I've got to spend time with vot­ers." Clinton, he argued, is better-known to voters in states coming up on the primary calendar. 
Clinton, who loaned her campaign $5 million in the run-up to Super Tuesday, brushed aside the notion she has money problems. She pointed to the roughly even split of delegates still being allo­cated from Tuesday's primaries and caucuses as evidence her campaign has the financial muscle to compete.

Romney pulls out from GOP race 
McCain virtually clinches Republican presidential nomination, aims to win conservatives 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -John McCain sought to mend his tattered relationship with conservatives and unify a splintered GOP as he all but clinched the party's presi­dential nomination Thursday. Mitt Romney, his former chief rival, dropped out, and a parade of promi­nent Republicans swung behind the Arizona senator. 
"We're continuing cam­paigning and not taking anything for granted," McCain said in an Associated Press interview, still reluctant to call himself anything more than the front-runner. "I certainly think that we have enhanced our chances." 
Only Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul remained in what has been a crowded and wide-open nomination fight for the past year. Both have narrow voting constituen­cies and are far behind in the hunt for delegates to the GOP's nominating conven­tion this summer. 
Romney's departure left McCain, whose independent streak rankles many in the Republican rank-and-file, poised to assume President Bush's position as the party standard-bearer.

IN BRIEF 
Wall Street posts modest gains 
NEW YOBK -Wall Street finished moderately higher in litful trading Thursday as investors, still nPrvous about the economy, decided to buy back into a stock market pummeled by three straight days of'losses. 
With the market having largely priced in the possibility of' a recession, many believe there are plenty of valuable stocks at cheap prices. Before Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen this wnPk by 543 points, or 4.26 percent, giving up all of last week's sharp gains. 
Though the market ended up rising Thursday, trading was extremely fickle due to a batch of gloomy data that included declining January sales at major n~tailers, a drop in December sales of pending homes, and a disappointing outlook from Internet networking supplier Cisco Systems Inc. The major indexes seesawed throughout the day. 
"We're kind of trying to create a silk purse out of a sow's ear here," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors. "The earnings are lousy, the economic numbers are lousy." 
The Dow rose 46.90, or 0.38 percent, to 12,247.00 after trading down about 80 points and up about 130. The index remains more than 13 percent below its record close on Oct. 9, 2007 of 14,164.53. 
Unemployment falls slightly 
WASHINGTON -The number of newly laid ofl' workers filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped last week, but not enough to indicate that strains on the labor market are eas­ing. 
The Labor Department reported Thursday that 356,000 claims for jobless benefits were filed last week, a decline of 22,000 from the previous week. The decline only erased a part of the huge jump of72,000 in claims of the previous week. 
The four-week average for jobless claims rose to 335,000, which was the highest level in a month. 
A severe slowdown in economic growth that has raised concerns about a possible recession has begun to all'ect the labor market. The govern­ment reported last week that the economy shed 17,000 jobs in January, the first monthly job loss in more than four years. 
Senate passes fiscal relief plan 
Bill advances after Democrats drop demands for heating aid, jobless benefits, tax breaks 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Senate passed an economic rescue plan Thursday that would speed $600 to $1,200 in rebates to most taxpayers and $300 checks to low­income people, including dis­abled veterans and the eld­erly. 
The 81-16 vote capped more than a week of political maneuvering that ended only when majority Democrats dropped their demand that the proposal offer jobless benefits, heating aid for the poor and tax breaks for certain industries. 
GOP senators blocked those ideas, but agreed to add the rebates for older people and disabled veterans to a $161 billion measure the House passed last month. 
House leaders said they would act as early as Thursday night to send the measure to President Bush. 
Bush indicated he would sign the measure and said the Senate made changes "in ways I can support." 
"This plan is robust, broad-based, timely, and it will be effective," Bush said in a statement. The compro­mise, he said, was "an exam­ple of bipartisan cooperation at a time when the American people most expect it."

Gift cards redeemed for basic items 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Here's a sign of how shaky the economy has become: Wal-Mart says its shoppers are redeeming their holiday gift cards for basic items -pasta sauce, diapers, laundry detergent -instead of iPods or DVDs. 
Merchants had hoped shoppers armed with gift cards would pro­vide a lift after a dismal holiday shopping season -partly because shoppers tend to spend even more than the value of the card. But that didn't seem to happen last month, and retailers are feeling the pain. 
On Thursday, the nation's retail­ers turned in their worst January in almost four decades as high gas and food prices, a slumping housing market, tighter credit and a tougher job market pushed con­sumers to the edge. 
Sales at 43 retailers surveyed by the UBS-International Council of Shopping Centers rose just 0.5 per­

cent in January, well below the original 1.5 percent forecast. 
The results -based on sales at stores open at least a year -fol­lowed an anemic 0.7 percent pace in December and were below the 
2.1 percent gain for all of last year. 
Jill Panel!, a 26-year-old home­maker from Sterling Heights, Mich., was using a $20 Wal-Mart gift card on Thursday to stock up on gro­ceries and pet supplies. She wasn't in the market for a present for her­self. 
"Twenty dollars at Wal-Mart is easy to spend," she said. Analysts think it's happening in other stores, too. "Gift cards are being used as a secondary way to save," said Burt 
P. Flickinger III, managing director of the New York-based retail con­sulting firm Strategic Resource Group. 
Even at department stores, he said, consumers are using gift cards to buy basic apparel such as socks 
and lingerie. 
The assessment by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, that gift card redemptions were below expectations and peo­ple were buying only necessities shook up industry observers. Retailers record gift-card revenue only as cards are redeemed. 
"It shows you the level of worry. Even with free money in your hand. (consumers) aren't willing to spend on anything more than necessities," said Michael P. Niemira, chief econ­omist at International Council of Shopping Centers. 
Niemira said January's retail sales performance was the weakest for that month since at least 1970, when comparable records started. 
Shoppers appear to be looking at gift cards not as "free money" but rather as their "own personal cash," said C. Britt Beemer, chair­man of America's Research Group, citing his recent surveys with con­sumers.

Shuttle Atlantis leaps into orbit 



ND theater buff 
Europe's gift to international space station flies despite fuel problems 
Associated Press 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. ­After two months of delay, shut­tle Atlantis blasted into orbit Thursday with Europe's gift to the international space station, a $2 billion science lab named Columbus that spent years waiting to set sail. 
Atlantis and its seven-man crew safely roared away from their seaside launch pad at 2:45 p.m., overcoming fuel gauge problems that thwarted back­to-hack launch attempts in December. 
The same cold front that spawned killer tornadoes across the South earlier in the week stayed far enough away and, in the end, cut NASA a break. All week, bad weather had threat­ened to delay the flight, making liftoff all the sweeter for the shuttle team. The sky was cloudy at launch time, but rain and thunderstorms remained off to the west. 
"Three, two, one, zero, and liftoff of space shuttle Atlantis as Columbus sets sail on a voy­age of science to the space sta­tion," NASA's Launch Control exclaimed. 
Probably no one was happier than the 300 Europeans who gathered at the launch site to see Atlantis take off with their beloved Columbus lab. They celebrated with Belgian and French chocolates and sparkling grape juice, in keep­ing with NASA's no-alcohol rule at the Kenned.y Space Center. 
"It's not very European," observed Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli, smiling, as he poppfld open bottles of juice and filled plastic wine glasses. IIe flew on the last shuttle mis­sion. 
Twenty-three years in the making, Columbus is the European Space Agency's pri­mary contribution to the space station. The lab has endured space station redesigns and slowdowns, as well as a number of shuttle postponements and two shuttle accidents. 
"We're all as excited as heck," said an emotional Alan Thirkettle, Europe's space sta­tion program manager. ''I've lost about 500 grams (about 1 pound) so far, and that's just been tears." 
Columbus will join the U.S. lab, Destiny, which was launched aboard Atlantis exact­ly seven years ago. The 
Besides Columbus, Atlantis will drop off a new space sta­tion resident, French Air Force Gen. Leopold Eyharts, who will swap places with NASA astro­naut Daniel Tani and get Columbus working. Tani will return to Earth aboard the shuttle, ending a mission of nearly four months. 
To NASA's relief, all four fuel gauges in Atlantis' external fuel tank worked properly during the final stage of the count­down. The gauges failed back in December because of a faulty connector, and NASA redesigned the part to fix the problem, which had been plaguing the shuttles for three 
years.

ate degree in 1953, and returned to Notre Dame to embark on a long and cele­brated career teaching drama and directing plays on campus. His many produc­tions included, "Hamlet" and "Long Day's Journey Into Night," "My Fair Lady" and "South Pacific." He retired in 1969, and began to serve for many years as an assis­tant to Father Edmund P. Joyce, then Notre Dame's executive vice president, but twice returned to Washington Hall to direct highly acclaimed productions of 
"Death of a Salesman" and "The Crucible." 

"Perhaps more than any other person, Father Arthur Harvey is considered the father of theater at Notre Dame," said Mark C. Pilkinton, professor of film, television and theater. "Trained as an accountant but blessed with an abiding interest in the theater, Harvey worked tirelessly to achieve both artistic merit and academic integrity. With such student actors in his early years as Phil Donohue, Reg Bain and Gene Gorski, and supported by a faculty that included Fred Syburg, he oversaw a remarkable period of serious and good theatre at Notre Dame. 
"During his tenure, Father Art famously recreated on the Washington Hall stage the grandest of Broadway dramas and musicals of the day. He modernized and updated Washington Hall in 1956, turning the heavily decorated 19th-century inte­rior into a modern fully func­tional theater. Imperious, disciplined, and hard work­ing, he was also a master stage director known for his careful attention to detail and his work ethic that con­sistently produced work of the highest merit. No one loved Notre Dame more, and no one loved theater more. All of us who worked with Father Art will be forever grateful." 
The Notre Dame Alumni Association named an award in honor of Harvey in 2000 to be given annually to a gradu­ate for outstanding contribu­tions to the performing arts. The first recipient of the award was Harvey. 
Mary at Lourdes Mass to be held 

Special to the Observer 
A Mass marking the 150th anniversary of the apparition of Mary at Lourdes will be celebrated at 5:15 p.m. Feb.11 in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. 
University president emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh will preside at the Mass, which will be fol­lowed by a reception in the Coleman-Morse Center's Hammes Student Lounge. 
Preceding the Mass, spe­cial prayer services will be held in the Basilica at 6:15 
p.m. today and Saturday. The services will include an opening prayer, a scrip­tural reading and the recitation of the rosary. 
The first of the 18 reported apparitions of Mary to the 14-year-old St. Bernadette Soubiroux took place Feb. 11,1858 in a cranny of Massabielle Rock near Lourdes, France. St. Bernadette, scavenging for firewood with her sister and a friend, reported see­ing a young and beautiful 

woman who summoned her again and again to the site. During one apparition, a hitherto hidden spring began to flow from beneath Massabielle, and reports began to cit:culate of miraculous cures expe­rienced by people who drank from and bathed in its waters. During anoth­er, the woman identified herself to the largely illit­erate St. Bernadette as "the Immaculate Conception." 
Skeptical at first, Church authorities eventually assured the pilgrims who had begun to flock to Lourdes that they were "justified in believing the reality of the apparition" and a large church was built on the site as the devotion became nationally 
and  internationally  
famous.  
Among  devotees  of  

"Notre Dame de Lourdes" was Notre Dame's founder, Father Edward Sorin, who enthusiastically commemo­rated the apparitions by building Notre Dame's Grotto in 1896.

Thinking about grad school? 
One of the "Indicators of Excellence" on the Notre Dame website (which advertis­es its ranking as a top 25 school and a "New Ivy") is the fact that Notre Dame is "first among U.S. Catholic colleges and universities in the Darryl number of under-Campbellgraduates who have gone on to earn a Speak Up, doctorate since Please! 1920." In spite ofits historical success, Notre Dame isn't pro­ducing future scholars at the same rate it once did. In September, Father Jenkins reported to the faculty that less than five percent of Notre Dame graduates have gone on to Ph.D. and other research­based doctoral programs between 1995 and 2004, the lowest rate among any of the top 25 schools. Statistical quibbling aside -the number excludes those who take time ofT before postgraduate study, but so do the figures for other schools ­the point is that Notre Dame's graduates are less likely than those of our peer insti­tutions to become the next generation of researchers, teachers, and intellectual leaders. 
After Father Jenkins's speech, other administrators suggested that graduate students could become an "additional mentoring resource" for those students considering Ph.D.s. However, the gradu­ate students who do have regular contaet with undergrads, TAs, are not in the best position to be the kind of resource the administration envisions. In the class­room, undergraduates are under the aca­demic authority of the TA, and because the relationship is by nature subordinate rather than supportive, few people are going to look to their TA for informal career advice. 
Because TAs have to maintain a strictly professional relationship with their stu­dents, and because they have to be impartial judges of students' academic performance, students have a vastly dif­ferent relationship with their TA than they would with, say, a guidance coun­selor or academic adviser. Not surprising­ly, there is little informal interaction between TAs and their students. 
For example, TAs get five free dining hall meals so that they can meet in a casual setting with their students, but very few students take advantage of this opportunity (even if they know about it). It's the academic equivalent of having lunch with your boss; you probably aren't going to have a completely free conversa­tion or exchange of ideas with the person who decides your final grades. The com­bination of authority and professional dis­tance makes TAs poorly suited to give out career guidance. 
And yet there are almost no other opportunities for graduate students and undergrads to interact, except for the 54 assistant rectors in residence halls-many of whom come from the professional schools, which already attract plenty of undergrads. 
Basically, grad students are a part of Notre Dame's classroom life exclusively, and otherwise invisible in its residential or social life (occasional appearances in the Observer notwithstanding). As a result, most undergrads probably think that ~:,rrad students really are all the stereotypical hopeless shut-ins who are incapable of talking about anything non­academic. 
There are plenty of graduate students who would be happy to have the opportu­nity to simply talk to anyone thinking about pursuing graduate work, myself included. But if the University wishes graduate students to be this "additional mentoring resource," it will need to set up a way for undergrads and graduate students to have this kind of dialog to happen in a setting that isn't regimented and hierarchical; only in such an environ­ment can the discussion honestly address the pros and cons of graduate school, and allow prospective graduate to make a suf­ficiently informed choice. 
Until undergrads can look to grad stu­dents not just as graders and discussion leaders but as sources of advice or even mentors-in short, until grad studenl<; become a part of student life outside of just the classroom-they will nnver become the resource that the University wants. 
An 800-word column is barely enough space to outline the problem, but let me suggest some potential solutions anyway. Getting more Ph.D.s to serve as ARs seems like an obvious solution, but one that might be constrained by lack of space or interest. What about having graduate students affiliated with eaeh hall as a sort of non-resident adviser, with whom student<; eould discuss their coursework, academic progress, skills related to their diseipline, or even future plans fl.>r grad sehool. with someone from their department? Or having grad stu­dents within eaeh department hold occa­sional "oflice hours" fiJr the same sort of interaction'? 
There is, of course, no single reason why so few newly-minted graduates go on to graduate sehool, and likewisn there is no guarantee that having this sort of advising, or any other scheme, will result in more undergraduates going on to graduate school. But at the very least, it will give people thinking about postgrad­uate study an additional resource for information and advice, and it will put doctoral research on more peoples' radar screens. Above all, any opportunity for undergrads and grad students to have open discussions about graduate school is a positive step.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Fear over climate change justified 
In his letter entitled "Stop the Climate Change Propaganda," (Feb. 7) Matt Gore throws a bunch of stats and studies at us in an attempt to undermine the "fear mongering" techniques of a professor who was rightly spreading the word about the importance of environmental issues. Even if the statistics that Gore references are valid, he is failing to see the big picture. 
Statistics and studies can be slanted to support any argument, but the fact that humans are putting an unnatural strain on the environment is undisputable. The level of foreign chemicals and man­made pollutants in the environment has been increasing at an alarming rate for quite some time now, obviously changing the dynamics of our environment. Animal and plant life, not to mention entire ecosystems, will not be able to adapt quickly enough to keep up with the current rate of environmental degra­dation. 
Change is needed now, and maybe "fear mongering" is exactly what we need. The average person is surprisingly complacent and uncaring when it comes to the impact we are having on the future of our planet. If we continue along our current path, our actions will compromise not only the futures of a couple exotic species off in some forest somewhere, but the well-being of future generations and quite likely our current generation will also be at stake. 
Look around you: The writing is on the wall. It is becoming pretty clear that the time for fear is now. In the end of Gore's letter, he claims to support conservation and the use of alternate energy sources based on potential short-term and long­term benefits. If that is so, then why did he even write his letter? The only part that anyone will read is the headline "Stop the climate change propaganda," which, on a base level, contradicts this point It seems to me that his article was an unneeded attack against a sentiment of "fear" that is definitely warranted when it comes to the future of our plan­et. I know I'm scared, and maybe he should be too ...

Grass famine 
The following letter was forwarded to us to forward to you -Ed. Board 
Dear President Nixon, 
For several years now I have been smoking grass (marijauna to you I suppose) with my happy collection of oft-stoned friends. We duti­fully followed your warnings and fearfully resisted those evil characters who tried to push us down the long road towards dirty-ten­emnet heroin death. Now, great father, what are we to do? Our grass has run out and there's a dark man with a black shirt and white tie sitting near me in the huddle. Oh well, no one cares for me.

Sullivan relishes the 'blonde role'

"I had a grand total of three lines," she recalls. Sullivan also had roles as il servitore in last spring's "La Locandiera," an Italian play, and as Denise Savage this past fall in "Savage in Limbo."

Ever since, "the company has become very dear to me," she said. 
Sullivan also said that she has found purpose in producing for the good of the company that trumps even the experience of performing onstage. 
"I see producing as a way to really work for the best interest of the com­pany, to be abln to influence il'i path more so than when I was a cast member,'' she said. "Musical theatrn is delinitely an adrenalirw rush, and I lovn being in the shows, but I've found producing almost more fulfill­ing.

Sullivan, who also goes by the nickname "Sully," said her favorite number from the musical is "Tom, Dick, or Harry." 
"Not only do I get to sing it," she said, "but it's an up-tempo tune with a four part harmony and a swingin' beat. l'Kiss Me Kate' composer and song­writerI Cole Porter knows what's up." 
After "Tom, Dick, or Harry" Sullivan said her second favorite song is "Too Darn Hot." 
"It's got great music," she said. ''Our choreographers really nailed it, and I love watching the cast dance. They just have a blast with that number, and I think it shows."

With her mix of quirky humor, talent and research, it's safe to say Sullivan is having fun with her role.

Getting into character no problem for versatile Rice 
By TAE ANDREWS Scene Editor 
Kelly Rice doesn't have a lot of difficulty getting into character. 
"I really just try to think about everything that is going on in Lilli's [her character's! life at each moment during the show," she said. "She is very difficult to play because she is always very con­flicted and there are very few times where there is only one thing she wants that she can actually have. She may be a diva, but her occasional animosity stems from her very deep emotional confu­sion." 
Rice has been singing since the tender age of six. She participated in her first musical at age 12 and started vocal training at age 13. Rice was also a member of the ensemble of last year's PEMCo pro­duction of Ragtime and performed in PEMCo's 2007 "Revue Beyond the Curtain." 
Rice also said that she has rev­eled in working opposite Carolyn Sullivan (Lois) because of the onstage feud between their char­acters. 
"It's really fun to be angry with Lois because Lilli sees her as extremely inferior to herself, yet she still envies her. Carolyn does a fabulous job of playing Lois, and makes it very fun to interact with her charactnr." 
On the flip side of the coin, she also said she has developed consid­erable chemistry with fellow cast­mate Kyle Carter, who plays Fred Graham. 
"Kyle and I have had a wonder­ful time getting to know each other better during the course of the show. and I think that my close relationship with him has helped us create a sincere stage relation­ship for Fred and Lilli." 
Like many of the performers in the show, Hice said her favorite songs from the show are "Too Darn Ilot" and "Tom, Dick, or Harry." 
"They arc both very fun and energetic and really draw the audience in," she said. 
Upon being asked (how she would describe the show in three words or less), Hice replied, "There is no doubt in my mind that this show is spunky, sassy and sincere."

A job description for the position of director of "Kiss Me Kate" might read something like this: Must have an eye for talent, flexible creativity and the vision to put it all together. 
As the man running the show behind the scenes, Connor Nowalk has all that and more. 
"Casting is an interesting thing, because for any given role there are several people who could play it well," Nowalk said. 
Given the sheer amount of talent on display during the auditions, he said that the casting process amounted to matching various talents to roles. 
"Joe LJuraskol excelled in all three areas of performance: singing, danc­ing and acting," he said. "We knew we wanted to utilize his talents, but we weren't quite sure how." 
Nowalk also found himself playing matchmaker in order to pair off actors to ensure that they had onscreen chemistry. ~aroly'! Sullivan.'s s~ooth jazz voice and commandmg stage presence made her a perfect fit for the part of Lois. 
"When we put the two of them together in a scene during callbacks, the chemistry was there, and we knew we had our pair," he said. 
Nowalk also paired Kyle Carter and Kelly Hice as the characters Fred and Lilli. 
"Kelly showed us power, control and sweetness in her voice, which works perfectly for the incredible vocal demands of the role," he said. "Kyle showed us the charisma and magnet­ism required of Fred, with the voice to match. As if those qualities weren't enough, the two looked great and acted well together." 
For the uninitiated, "Kiss Me, Kate" features a play within a play, as the characters within the show put on a show of their own, a Broadway musi­cal version of Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew." 
"A really interesting aspect of 'Kiss Me, Kate' is the way the two plays are intertwined," he said. "The characters offstage are all very similar to the characters they portray in "the Shrew." 
Add to that a couple of mistaken identities, misunderstandings, and hurt feelings, and characters start jumping in and out of character, blur­ring the line between what is 'sup­posed to be happening' and what is just happening and encouraging the audience to get lost in the mayhem. We made some decisions, both in terms of set and otherwise, to develop that ambiguity." 
As such, the action moves around quite a bit. Keeping everything in per­spective required some innovation and creativity from the crew. 
"What is neat about the set for this show is that it all occurs in one build­ing," Nowalk said. "During the scenes from 'The Taming of the Shrew,' the action takes place on the stage itself. All the other action occurs behind the scenes in the backstage corridor or dressing rooms. At least conceptually speaking, instead of moving the set, we wanted to 'move the audience."' 
To accomplish this, the production has a mobile set which takes the audi­ence backstage with the rest of the characters within the show. As such, set pieces are "set" in name only ­the production has a lot of moving parts to create the backstage corri­dors and dressing rooms of the mock production of "The Taming of the Shrew," Nowalk said. 
"By taking the audience on this trip to see exactly where they are going, we hope that people will know exactly where they are in the theater." 
After holding auditions in mid­October, Nowalk and co. got into the swing of things with rehearsals start­ing after Fall Break. Excluding breaks and finals, the production has had about 10 weeks of rehearsals. 
In a production featuring so many parts, Nowalk said he hasn't further muddled things up by trying to put his own take on the material in the show. 
"Kiss Me, Kate is not really the kind

of show that lends itself to 'directorial interpretation,"' he said. "Sure, you can taste a· little bit of 'Connor Nowalk' in it, especially in the humor, but for the most part, I wanted to let the show speak for itself." 
Nowalk, who did his first musical in fifth grade, has been unable to keep himself out of theater ever since. 
"Singing was what got me interested in the first place, but the more shows I was in, the more I started to love all aspects of theater," he said. 
Starting primarily as a performer, Nowalk made his directorial debut as a freshman at the Cleveland Institute of Music. After transferring here to Notre Dame, Nowalk knew that he wanted to direct a show here before graduating. 
"I am glad that my first opportunity was with a group I love," he said. "Though I will never direct a PEMCo show again, I am sure that this will not be the last show I direct."

Need to warm up from your February chill? Escape pre­Midterm stress? Low on cash? Once again Legends and SUB brings some much needed relief, this time with Ben Lee. On Saturday, The Ben Lee duo takes the stage at 10 p.m. on campus at Legend's Nightclub. With melodic tunes and a relaxed vibe that will no doubt calm the iciest basket case, Ben Lee promises to be yet another NO concert success. 
Lee is best known for his single "Catch My Disease," which hit the airwaves in the ·spring and summer of 2007. You may know him from his contributions to soundtracks for "Grey's Anatomy" and "John Tucker Must Die." 
But he is not a novice to the industry. The Australian's discog­raphy includes six albums, includ­ing the most recent release, "Prime." Lee was only in his teens, living in his hometown of Sydney, when he first signed with an inde­pendent label. Slowly garnering success internationally he now shares producer, John Alagia, with greats like Dave Matthews and John Mayer. 
Ben Lee has been compared to Bob Dylan with his laid-back, hon­est vocals and guitar accompani­ment. But Lee is best known for his catchy love songs. Evading a nau­seating melodrama, Lee is coy with his works, creating a distinctly fresh and young take on a roman­tic musical staple. Now in his late 20s, Lee maintains an age-appro­priate perspective that appeals to fans, especially college audiences. 
Using playful lyrics and coquet­tish instrumental Lee's songs cover the full spectrum of love. From crush to lust to flirting to adora­tion, Lee explores the passions the heart. With refreshing honesty, his music taps into the reality of human affection with lighthearted­ness. 
Ben Lee is all about having fun music that doesn't bog down his talent with fluff or fuss. He's toured with other popular "Bens," including Ben Folds Five and Ben Kweller. "Prime" is testament to his experience in the industry. 
Other artists were more than willing to contribute to his new work. Mandy Moore, with her newly revamped indie image, Benji Madden, from Good Charlotte, and members of Rooney all make appearances on the album. On Saturday, Notre Dame gets a first­hand glimpse as to why.

Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Roger Clemens spent Thursday going door-to-door on Capitol Hill, lobbying con­gressmen investigating whether he used drugs. His accuser, Brian McNamee, gave a seven-hour deposi­tion behind closed doors, and the trainer's lawyers presented photographs of evidence they said prove the star pitcher was inject­ed with steroids. 
McNamee headed straight for an exit, not speaking a word to reporters, when he emerged from his inter­view with lawyers from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. His attorneys wouldn't discuss the depo­sition, but they did talk at length about two color photographs they showed the committee for the first time. 
"Roger Clemens has put himself in a position where his legacy as the greatest pitcher in baseball will depend less on his ERA and more on his DNA," said one of MeNamee's lawyers, Earl Ward. 
The seven-time Cy Young Award winner's repeated denials of McNamee's alle­gations in the Mitchell Report about drug use drew Congress' attention. Clemens spoke under oath to the committee Tuesday -the first time he addressed the allegations under oath, and therefore the first time he put him­self at legal risk if he were to make false statements. 
There is a public hearing scheduled for Wednesday, when Clemens, McNamee and other witnesses, including New York Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte, are to testify. 
McNamee's attorneys said their client turned over physical evidence to a federal prosecutor for the Northern District of California last month, shortly after Clemens held a Jan. 7 nationally tele­vised news conference at which he played a taped conversation between the two men with conflicting accounts at the center of the issue. 
"At that point," Ward said, "(McNamee) decided there was no holds barred." 
One photo shows a crushed beer can that Richard Emery, another of McNamee's attorneys, said was taken out of a trash can in Clemens' New York apartment in 2001. Emery said the can contained nee­dles used to inject Clemens. That picture also shows what Emery said was gauze used to wipe blood off Clemens after a shot. 

IN BRIEF Ant!ry bar owner decided 
nof" to open fire at Super
Bowl 

PHOENIX -Awould-be bar owner angry at being denied a liquor license threatened to shoot people at the Super Bowl and drove to within sight of the stadium with a rifle and 200 rounds of ammunition before chang­ing his mind, federal authorities said. 
Kurt William Havelock, who ulti­mately turned himself in, had vowed to "shed the blood of the innocent" in a manifesto mailed Sunday to media outlets, according to court docu­ments. "No one destroys my dream," he wrote. 
The documents say he was armed with an AR-15 assault-style rifle Sunday when he reached a parking lot near University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, where pre-game activities were happening. 
"He waited about a minute and decided he couldn't do this," FBI agent Philip Thorlin testified. 
Bullet riP.P.ed through both 
ofTaylors legs, autopsy says 
MIAMI -The bullet that killed Washington Redskins safety Sean Taylor ripped first through his right leg and then the left, and pos­sibly came from a 9mm handgun, an autopsy released Thursday said. 
The report, obtained by The Associated Press through a public records request filed after Taylor's Nov. 27 death, notes a bullet perfo­rated the soft tissues and muscles of the right groin and the right femoral artery, a crucial pathway for blood. 
The bullet tore through muscles of Taylor's upper right thigh, according to the report from the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner, then exited the leg and entered the athlete's left thigh. 
A Miami-Dade police report to the medical examiner identified the weapon as a handgun, possibly a9mm. 
U.S. ready to defend its

VIENNA, Austria -Andy Roddick will face Jurgen Melzer on Friday in the opening match when the United States defends its Davis Cup title against Austria on indoor clay. 
James Blake and Stefan Koubek will play in the second match of the best-of-five series. The pairings were announced Thursday. 
"I don't see it as an advantage nor as a disadvantage to start," said Roddick, who is 6-0 against Melzer and hasn't dropped a set against the Austrian. 
Still, Melzer is glad to get out on the court first. 
"I am pretty happy to be out there first as it gives me some more time to recover for the doubles on Saturday," said Melzer, who expects a loud home crowd of about 6,500 boisterous fans. "But the spectators alone won't win matches-we have to be at our best."

Willingham makes last stand at Washington 
Former Notre Dame coach remains stoic despite pressure; encouraged by high-ranked recruiting class 
Associated Press  
SEATTLE Willingham months.  has  had  Tyrone better  

The coach who has already been dumped abruptly by Notre Dame after just three years knows adversity. But even this has been unique. 
"This year has had a lot of special hurdles to it," Willingham said with a wry smile this week, a rare good one for the Washington Huskies recently. 
This lightning rod from South Bend, Ind., to Seattle was seated inside the University of Washington's Founder's Club, a confnrence room the school's donors use for pregame hob­nobbing. 
Many of them wanted him fired months ago. 
"If it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger. And l think this has made our program stronger," Willingham said of a Huskies program that currently has more negativity surrounding it than Britney Spears. 
In an interview with The Associated Press, the stoic Willingham brushed oil" the tur­moil surrounding his flounder­ing program; ''I've been faced with controversy all my life, in some form or fashion," he said. 
lie quoted pioneering news­man David Brinkley. lie referred to ~~hats he's had with Secretary of State Condolneza Hice, the provost at Stanford wlwn he was the coach there, and with Prosidont (~norge W. Bush, when he visitnd Notre Dame. 
Willingham, whose demeanor is as even as his 76-76-1 record in 13 seasons as a college coach, said lw might have been an ele­mentary-school toacher instead, becauso those kids need male roln models. IIn said hn and his family love Seattle enough to make Washington the last stop on a football journny that began as a walk-on athlete at Michigan Statn in the early 1970s. 
lie has graduatml his players. Most havn stayed out of trouble at UW. lin just hasn't won enough games. 
Wednesday brought rare vic­tories: 26 of them. recruits that included tivn of the eonsnnsus top soven prospeds in Washington and some from Soutlwrn California. Many· oxperts rank Washington's incoming class among the nation's top 25. 
That's a measurn of Willingham's resolve and ram­rod porsona. It also fuels his bnlief he will get Washington back to the perennial Hoso Bowl days of Don James. 
"I tell my football team -I usn this quote from David Brinkley: 'A suecessful man is one who can lay a firm founda­tion with the bricks others have thrown at him.'," Willingham said. 
"And that's what I want our 
young men to understand. The 
people who stop us from being 
successful. that will be our­
selves. Not any outside forces." 
Those forces have been work­
ing overtime recently. 

In December, Willingham 
became the first Huskies coach 
to finish three consecutive losing 
seasons as UW went 4-9. 
Washington lost to Washington 
State for the third time in four 
years -the last time that had 
happened was 1982-85. It then 
blew a lead at undefeated 
Hawaii in the finale, missing a 
huge upset that would have pro­
vide some positive momentum 
heading into the offseason. 

Willingham is 11-25 at 
Washington. He was 21-15 in 
the same span at Notre Dame, 
and the Irish fired him. 

Many Huskies fans want the 
same for the hard-to-crack man 
they derisively call "Paint Dry 
Ty." 

In December, school president 
Dr. Mark Emmert, formerly of 
football power LSU, wavered for 
a few days over Willingham's 
future. Emmert then announced 
the coach would return for the 
2008 season. 

No mention of 2009. That's 
the final year of the five-year 
deal that pays Willingham $1.4 
million a year. 

"Isn't that normal for most 
football coaches?" he said. 

Just the nature of the busi­
ness? 
"Always has been." 

So is what happened next: Emmert forced out Willingham's top advocate, athletic Todd Turner, instead. 
That did stun Willingham. He said he was never even given a heads-up. 
"Nope," the coach said. He was away on a recruiting trip and got a call that the man who hired him was leaving. He still doesn't know who his new boss will be. 
"It did take me by surprise," he said. "But ... I'm expecting coach Willingham to step up. When you lose your athletic director, I'm expecting myself to step up and still produce a win­ner." 
It would seem unsettling that his top supporter is gone. 
"Well, the truth of the matter is, I think I have a lot of top sup­porters, OK," Willingham said. ''And I think it's impossible for a football coach to be at any place if hP didn't have a lot of top sup­porters. 
"But do I think the guy who hired me, is it important to have him around? Yes, I think it is. But I also hope the next man will see the value of what we are doing. And then we will be in a situation in which winning makes everyone's decisions a lot easier." 
Easier than last month's, when he fired defensive coordi­nator Kent Baer, a friend who had been his assistant for all 13 years of his head-coaching career. Soon after, The Seattle Times published an embarrass­ing, front-page, four-part series on past violent crimes of players from Washington's last winning teams, Huskies before Willingham arrived, and the community's penchant for large­ly turning the other cheek to those crimes as UW won. 
That was also around the time the school proposed using $150 million in public money to reno­vate 88-year-old Husky Stadium. The plan is getting criticized and drawing little interest in a state Legislature consumed with tight financial times. Willingham testified inside the state Capitol in ·Olympia, Wash., on Tuesday to try to jump-start interest. 
Amid all this, he found time to celebrate his 54th birthday. He was also elected as the presi­dent of the American Football Coaches Association. The cruel joke around Seattle is that's the gram, that we will win champi­gather it together and throw it only job Willingham will have onships," he said, his voice low on a table in front of the players beyond the coming season. and steady as always. and say, 'Our backs are against 
"We believe in ourselves ... "Maybe at some point we col­the wall. Let's go. It's us against (that) we will have a great pro-lect all this information and the world."'

ND WOMEN'S GOLF 

Irish golfers tee off season in sunny Fla. 
By MICHAEL BLASCO 
Sporrs Writer 

No. 20 Notre Dame looks to refocus as it kicks off the season this weekend at the annual Florida Fling Alumni Golf Tournament. 
Hosted by the Notre Dame Club of Tampa, the Florida Fling offers a chance for the Irish golfers to pair up with alumni and play a friendly 18 holes at the Saddlebrook Resort in Tampa on Saturday. 
"This is an opportunity for the student-athletes to get to know some Notre Dame alumni and establish some relationships," Irish coach Susan Holt said. "We had a good time last year in Orlando, involving quite a few of our former athletes." 
Notre Dame begins its spring slate after a strong first half of the season, win­ning its first three tourna­ments and finishing second and fourth in its final two. In its mid-season awards, Golf World named the Irish the most surprising women's team and fresh­man So-Hyun Park the sur­prising female player. Park leads the team with a 72.53 scoring average over 15 rounds, on pace to break the single-season Notre Dame record of 74.71. 
"As a group, we're right on target," Holt said. "As a team, at the beginning of the year, we set high goals. People on the outside might be surprised, but we aren't. We made a commitment to do exactly what we're doing. We're on track." 
The Irish enter the Fling after a three-month break during which Holt inked a solid recruiting class ­recruits Katie Allare (Xavier Prep, Ariz.) and Becca Huffer (Littleton High School, Colo.). Huffer is ranked 17th nationally in the 2008 class, according to GolfWeek and was named the 2006 Colorado Player of the Year. 
"Both [Allare and Huffer] are great players," Holt said. "They're both going to make an immediate impact and continue the trend we're on right now, which is good, we're getting better." 
Neither the three-month break nor the miserable South Bend weather has slowed Notre Dame's prac­tice schedule, and Holt looks optimistically at Notre Dame's spring season. 
"We're able to work on our short game indoors at our new practice facility and work on our driving outdoors," Holt said. "We're still able to get solid prac­tice in spite of the weather. We're keeping focused on each tournament as it approaches. We're trying to get better every day. We were successful in the fall and we're trying to keep doing what we're doing."

Shaq aims to silence critics 
O'Neal hopes to bring Phoenix first title in team's 40-year history 
Associated Press 
PHOENIX Shaquille O'Neal flashed that wide smile, and took on the critics who say he's too old and too slow to fit in with the sleek, speedy Phoenix Suns. 
"I look forward to making people eat their words," he said at a news conference Thursday. "I really do." 
Wearing a Suns' purple shirt and tie with his immaculate dark suit, O'Neal met the media for the first time since the stunning deal Wednesday that sent the 14-time All-Star from the Miami Heat to Phoenix in exchange for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks. 
He charmed the jam-packed room at US Airways Center. Someone asked if he knew he looked good in purple. 
"I already knew that," O'Neal said. "But thank you very much." 
He acknowledged a new motivation after going from a team with the worst record in the NBA to one with the best record in the Western Conference. Widespread criti­cism of the deal has not gone unnoticed. 
''I'm very upset," he said. "You just don't really want to get me upset. When I'm upset, I'm known to do certain things -like win championships." 
Phoenix is without a title in the team's 40-year history. The Suns have had the most 

entertaining team in basket­ball since Steve Nash arrived three-plus seasons ago to orchestrate coach Mike D'Antoni's ultra-fast style. But they have never made it to the finals, and the trade confirmed the belief that this version of the Suns, despite its record, wasn't going to be able to do it, either. 
"I think with the addition of me it gives the guys the extra that we can make it," O'Neal said. "The first thing it takes in winning a championship is belief. If you can believe that you can do it, you can get it done. If there's ever a doubt that 'Hey, we can't do it,' you will never win. Now I think the guys really, really believe that we have a shot." 
The presence of a 7 -foot-1, 325-pound man in the middle 
should go a long way toward 
erasing Phoenix's image as a 
"soft" team. His four champi­
onship rings give him extra 
credibility, and his personality 
should, as he put it, "amp up" 
what has been a joyless Suns 
team this season. 
He will energize the locker 
room, he said, "just by being 
me." 
O'Neal, out for two weeks 
with a hip injury, said his new 
teammate Grant Hill, who has 
a long history of injuries, told 
him how good the Suns' train­
ing staff is. 
"I've given a full commit­
ment to the medical staff that I · will be there every day before and after practice, doing what­ever it takes to keep me going for the next 10 years, he said. "And I look forward to my next 
$200 million contract."

Notre Dame goes up against tough foes in Loftus this weekend 
By PAT STYNES Sports Writer 
Thn annual Meyo Invitational will be more than just a traek meet this year. 
The event will honor J'ormnr Notre Dame standout Hyan Shay with the first Hyan Shay 3,000-meter run. Shay died on Nov. 3 during U.S. Olympic marathon trials in New York City's Central Park. 
The Irish will host the 21st annual Meyo Invitational this weekend. The event will run over the course of two days. the competition beginning at 5 tonight and the second half beginning Saturday morning at 9:30. 
This event will be the tough­est competition Notre Dame has seen yet, with teams such as Purdue, Iowa, Wisconsin and Alabama in the field. Heady to step up to the chal­lenge, however, will be the tal­ented group of runners Irish coach Joe Piane has put together this year. 
Senior Kurt Benninger will look to defend his home turf during the annual Meyo Mile. The standout runner posted 
the provisional mark or 
4:02.90 in the mile at the Loftus Center on Jan. 25 at the Notre Damn Invitational. Benninger will look to make strides in thn 3,000-meter event as wnll. lie posted a 8:05.22, a 20 second margin. wlum hn last time ran the even at the Blue/Gold Invitational on Dee. 7. 
Notre Damn's llungarian onn-two punch of freshman Miklos Szebeny and sophomore Balazs Molnar will look to con­tinue to build on their fantastic start to the yoar, as both sprinters hold thn fastest time on the tnam in thPir respective main events, the 200-mntnr and 400-mntnr dash. 
For thn throwers, the duo of senior Mike Schubert will look to perform well in the shot put. and up and coming freshman Greg Davis to shine in the wnight throw. Schubert has been a pflrennial shot put spn­cialist since his freshman year on the l!lam, and Davis looks to carve out a similar path. Both men have qualified for the Big East and are the best on the team in their events. Schubert threw 15.94 mnters at last year's Meyo Invitational; he posted a career best of 16.79 meters last weekend at I nd ianapolis.

Team narrowly falls to Alma 

Scots hold off late rally, top Belles 
By MEAGHAN YESELIK 
Sports Writer 

Saint Mary's eanw close to pulling away with a win over Alma. but the Scots claimed some key final free throws to seal a 6~-64 win. 
After falling behind 7-2 early. thP Belles battled back to take the lnad for 14 minutes in thn first half. Dospitll the long stretch in front, they were unable to pull away as the Scots always snemed to make a shot wlwn they nnnded one. Saint Mary's never managed to jump ahnad of thn Seots by more than snvon points. 
Late in the first half. Alma made a quick run to take a two-point lead with 1:35 l1~ft. But then, on a buzzer­beating 3-pointer by junior guard Katie Has hid (12 points, eight assists), the Belles headed into the lock­er room with a 31-30 lead. 
The second half, though, was a much different story. 
The Scots (8-10, 5-6 MIAA) went on a tear, jump­ing out to a quick five-point lead three minutes into the half. From there, they slow­ly but surely built up to an eleven-point lead with 11:53 left in the game. The Belles failed to eatch Alma -the Scots led by 12 at one point after a 3-pointer by sopho­more guard Lacey Best­Howden. With 7:12 left in the game, Saint Mary's was down 60-48 and in dire need of a run. 
The Belles' starting five tried to answer the call. After Best-Howden's triple, Saint Mary's went on a 12-3 run over 4:31, culminating in a pair of free-throws by Hashid to make the score 65-63 with 2:41 left. A minute and a half later, Alma's lead fell to one when Belles senior guard Alison Kessler scored two of her team-high 18 on free throws with 1:07 left. 
The Scots secured the 68­64 win with a few key free throws, dropping Saint Mary's to a 5-7 record in the MlAA and 9-11 overall mark. 
The Belles now look ahead to Saturday, when they will take on Kalamazoo at home.

Notre Dan1e ready to host first hon1e duals 
Irish must compete without top epeeists 
By KEN FOWLER Spons Writer 

Notre Dame hosts the best of the Midwest this weekend -with an important pair of exceptions. 
Wayne State, Northwestern, Detroit Mercy and Cleveland State are among the competi­tors for the two-day Notrn Dame Duals, but Penn State and rival Ohio State are tak­ing the weekend off from action. 
Notre Dame, ranked No. 1 on the wom1m's side and No. 3 among men's teams, is 
· coming off a strong perform­ance at the Northwestern Duals last week. The Irish women went 11-0, while tlw men finished X-2 at the event. 
Though the Notre Dame women probably won't eom­pete against No. 6 Northwestern -they will only bout if the event movns fast enough to get in an extra round of dunls -things might be a little bit toughnr on the Irish this week. 
Top epeeists Knlley Hurley and Ewa Nclip will be com­peting in Europe to gain qualifying points for the U.S. 
Olympie squad. 
"Others have to step in and show that without these two fencers, we still are strong," Irish coach Janusz Bednarski said. "And I belinve that this will happon.... I bnlinve that they will have Pnough courago and onough skill." 
In f'aet. one of Bndnarski's biggest concP-rns is that tlw young team might lw ovPr­confidont aftp,r its perform­anee at Northwestern. lin said he has been telling the fencers to stay focused all weekend, espncially against teams they have not yet faced. 
"Wn have a lot of freshmen. so they have to learn that tlw best idea to have ... is that it's a big danger to be over­confident," hn said. 
Bednarski considnrs the Notre Dame Duals tlw team's last truly regular-season event. Fnnc1us will compete individually next wonk at tlw J u n i or 0 I y m p il: s, a n d t h n Midwest Fencing Confnrenc1~ Championships from Feb. 23­24 dntermines qualifiers for the NCAA Midwnst Hegional com p1~tition.

GOLF 
In Pebble Beach Pro-Am
Jones takes lead  
Associated Press 
PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. -The celebrity watch at the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am took place everywhere but the top of the leaderboard Thursday. 
Kent Jones birdied the two most famous par 3s at Pebble Beach and kept bogeys off his card for a 6-under 66 and a one­shot lead, an encouraging start for someone who has played 270 tournaments on the PGA Tour without finishing in the top five. 
Nationwide Tour grad Roland Thatcher was a shot back along with Q-school grad Brad Adamonis and John Mallinger, third at Pebble Beach last year as a rookie. 
The star gazing took place at Poppy Hills, and while it didn't always produce great golf to match the spectacular sunshine on the Monterey Peninsula, it was entertaining. 
Defending champion Phil Mickelson was on the verge of shooting himself out of the tour­nament until a birdie-eagle­birdie-birdie burst enabled him to recover with a 71. 
Greg Norman, playing on the PGA Tour for the first time in 18 months, was holding steady until a four-putt on the 13th hole for a double bogey. He finished with a 
76. His fiancee, tennis great Chris Evert, flew in from Florida and didn't make it out to the golf course until Norman was on the 16th. 
Evert has no plans to take up golf, saying it was too time-con­suming with three boys -"It's like four boys with Greg," she said -and a tennis academy to run. 
"Tennis only takes one hour," she said, laughing. 
These rounds take close to six hours with two pros and two amateurs in every group, and it was a slow, steady grind. 

Norman struggled with that and the bumpy greens, but he had no complaints about how he hit the ball. 
"It's a long day of concentra­tion, which I'm not used to," Norman said. "You get past four hours, you really have to stay locked in." 
Jones, a 41-year-old from New Mexico who has yet to finish in the top 100 on the money list, has been around long enough to real­ize that one round is too early to get excited, especially in a format that uses three courses, and in a tournament where the leader­board doesn't begin to sort itself out until Sunday. 
"I think I'm just satisfied that I played well and putted well," Jones said. "When everyone is playing different golf courses, being in the lead isn't every important. But it's nice to be play­ing well, obviously." 
J.B. Holmes, coming off a play­off victory over Mickelson last week in Phoenix, had a 68 at Spyglass Hill to join a group of 10 players that included Todd Demsey, who recently recovered from having a tumor removed from his brain. 

The top 14 players on the leaderboard have combined for 10 career victories, and that does­n't include the California State Amateur that Demsey won in 1992. 
Davis Love III, returning to the PGA Tour for the first time in four months after a severe ankle injury, overcame an early gaffe on the par-5 14th at Spyglass with three birdies on his back nine for a 70. Vljay Singh also had a 70. 
Mickelson was thrilled to even be remotely near the lead. 
Lefty had big expectations for his week as he tries to become the first back-to-hack winner at Pebble Beach since Mark O'Meara in 1989-90. But he

Methodist failed to meet last year in April as the match was cancelled due to cold weather conditions. 
The Mustangs (4-1) have been successful in the early weeks of the season. The team's only loss came on Jan. 26 when it dropped the contest 5-2 to No. 7 Texas. 
Notre Dame topped the Mustangs 5-2 when the two squads last faced of two years ago. Then sophomore Sheeva Parbhu defeated Alex Skrypko in a tiebreaker 7-6 (9-7). 7-6 (7-5). Now senior Skrypko is just one of four seniors on the experienced Mustang squad. 
"Our record so far has been determined by a lot of close matches," Bayliss said. "Duke, Michigan State and Penn State all could have gone the other way. It's showing that our young guys don't feel as much pressure in tough situations." 
The Irish have been strug­gling lately in the doubles posi­tions. Losing the doubles points puts the Irish in an early

bogeyed his first two holes, had to save par from the fringe on the par-5 ninth, then clipped a tree and went into the water on the par-5 lOth, taking another bogey, putting him at 4 over for the round. 
Poppy Hills has five par 5s, and Mickelson played the first three in 2 over. 
"I was just trying to get back to even par," Mickelson said. "If I shot 3 or 4 over, I would be shoot­ing myself out of the tourna­ment." 
Instead, he shot himself back into it. 
After holing a 30-foot birdie on the 11th, Mickelson hit a hybrid from 240 yards that covered the flag and settled 4 feet away for eagle. Then came a wedge that landed 10 feet beyond the flag and spun back slowly to a foot, followed by another approach to 3 feet on the 14th that put him 1 under for the tournament. 
hole. 
"We try to emphasize to the 
singles players that we should 
have won the doubles point," 
Bayliss said. "We served for 
the match twice at two doubles 
against Duke. We want to put 
ourselves in a position to win at 
all times, in both singles and 
doubles." 
Junior Santiago Montoya has stepped up big for the Irish at the No. 3 doubles position, along with freshman Tyler Davis. Bayliss said that Montoya has become more sta­ble on his returns, in addition to having always been solid at net. Bayliss also said Montoya has taken a lot of the coach's ·constructive criticism to heart 
and is very coachable. 
Assistant coach Ryan 
Sacchire noted that Davis com­
petes like a "lion" and compli­
ments Montoya well on court. 
Winning the doubles point, 
and competing well will be key 
for the Irish in both matches 
this weekend. The first serve is 
set for noon Saturday against 
Wisconsin at the Eck Tennis 
Pavilion.

and  sophomore  Cosmina  
Ciobanu  and  freshman  
Kristen Rafael.  

Headed into singles play, Notre Dame needed to catch up with some individual wins. 
"We were in every match," Louderback said. "We dropped the first two long three-setters, before Kelcy [Tefft] won her match. When there are four total three-set matches, you know the com­petition is close. It really was a tight, tight matchup." 
Tefft needed a tiebreak in the first set over Dancevic, but convincingly won the sec­ond set to win 7-6, 6-2 and tie the team scores at 1-1. 
Notre Dame took a lead at 2-1 with Krisik's defeat of Bulldog sophomore Adrianne Elsberry 6-2, 6-2. But Georgia did not allow the Irish to score another point. 
In the first of the three-set­ters, Ciobanu fell to Hyndman 6-0, 5-7, 6-3 to bring the Bulldogs even to 2-2. Georgia sophomore Yvette Hyndman then defeated Buck in 7-6, 4­6, 6-4 -giving the Bulldogs the lead for good. 
After one match was sus­pended, junior Katie Potts fell to freshman Cameron Ellis 2­6, 7-6, 6-4 in the deciding match, sealing the Bulldog win. 
Although Notre Dame dropped the first round, the Irish are still looking to finish strong throughout the tourna­ment against some tough competition. 
"We're looking to win the rest of our matches," Louderback said. "We want to win. Either way we look at it, we're going to be playing a top-15 team so we're going to need to be focused." 
Notre Dame's next opponent had not been determined Thursday night.

No days off 
Notre Dame takes on Ferris State in late­season home series 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 

College hockey doesn't get bettnr than this weekend. Too bad it's happening over in Ohio. 
While No. 1 Miami and No. 2 Michigan claw it out in the Hedllawks' gorgeous new rink in Oxford, Notre Dame and Ferris State will play a two­game set in the Joyce Center. The fact that the nation's top two teams are meeting in a two-game series in February speaks to the power the CCHA has in college hockey this sea­son -and the difficult sched­ule the No. 8 Irish have had this season. 
Michigan State, last year's national champions, are also ranked sixth nationally. 
The Irish (20-9-1, 13-6-1 CCHAI will face the Bulldogs 
(10-12-4, 7-10-3 CCHA) at the start of the final month-long stretch of the regular season, during which Notre Dame will try to improve its fourth-place league standing and its NCAA Tournament seeding (now at around a No. 3). 
"We just got to play our own game," Irish center Christian Hanson said. "It's coming down to the stretch, and the focus is more on us to do what we got to do to win then worry about the other teams." 
Notre Dame hasn't played a regular season game in two weeks because the team host­ed an exhibition with the U.S. National Under-18 team last weekend that it won in over time 2-1. The exhibition game came a weekend after the Irish found their groove again in a sweep of Bowling Green. They had struggled mightily in the eight games after Christmas break. 
"We need to carry on from Bowling Green.... It was good to see our team be a little bit

By LORENZO REYES Sporrs Writer 
Imagine putting forth your best effort all season -and losing. 
That's how No. 19 Notre Dame felt after dropping its first-round match 4-2 to No. 6 Georgia at the ITA National Women's Team Indoor Championship in Madison, Wis., Thursday night. 
"That's the best we've played as a team all season," Irish coach .Jay Louderback said. "We played hard with a lot of emotion. It was a real­ly hard fought battle. We were right there the whole time with the sixth-ranked team in the nation." 

Notre Dame won the first game of the doubles portion as the national No. 3 duo consisting of senior Brook Buck and junior Kelcy Tefft 
took  care of No.  36 Kelly

Young squad returns home 
By KATE GRABAREK 
Sports Writer 

After taking down No. 15 Duke 4-3 on the road last Sunday, the No. 9 Irish return home to host No. 28 Wisconsin and Southern Methodist this weekend. 
"It is tremendously empow­ering to know you can beat a good team," Irish coach Bobby Bayliss said. "Tobacco road has not been kind to us recent­ly, although we have a better record against them there, then we do here." 
Notre Dame is a young team, but it hasn't shown up too much in their match scores. 
"We are a little ahead of my expectations," Bayliss said. "It's early and we are young, hopefully later we can cease our dialogue with the Gerber Company." 
Last year the Irish beat the Badgers 4-0 in the Round of 32 of the 2007 NCAA Tournament held at Notre Dame. 
"The doubles was very con­tested, and all of the unfinished matches ended in a tiebreaker," Bayliss said. "It was good that we won." 
Wisconsin is led by German sophomore Moritz Baumann. 
The Badgers strength rests in their experience, with three seniors and just two freshmen. 
"Baumann is a lefty, and a great all court player," Bayliss said. "They are more experi­enced than we are."

After the Irish knocked two straight change-ups out of the park, the Panthers will bring some chin music. 
No. 16 Notre Dame will face No. 15 Pittsburgh Sunday at 2 
p.m. in the Joyce Center, a tough game for the Irish after two easy wins. The Panthers (18-4, 8-1 Big East) will be Notre Dame's biggest challenge since it lost to No. 1 Connecticut at home on .Jan. 27. 
In the Panthers' most recent game, they defeated Seton Hall 64-44 at home. Senior center Marcedes Walker did not play because of a sprained ankle;

COMMENTARY 
Harangody needs help from K-Mac 
I have heard many times that Notre Dame will go as far as Luke Ilarangody will take it this season. That statement pins the team's fatn on the wrong playnr.

game. But 
MeAlarney's 
numbers have fluctuated and are usually a good indication 
of whether the Irish win. 
Look at Notre Dame's biggest victories of the season. McAlarney hit the game-win­ning shot against Kansas State on Dec. 4 at Madison Square Garden. The junior poured in 32 as the Irish topped Connecticut early in the Big East season. He also garnered player of the week honors al'tnr scoring 30 when the Irish beat Villanova on Jan. 26. 
MeAlarney's effectiveness in the four Irish losses provides us with just as much evidence of how his play affects the team's fate. In Notre Dame's two losses at the Virgin Islands Paradise Jam, McAiarney mus­tered respective point totals of only three and seven. To be sure, those early-season per­formances are excusable for McAlarney, who was possibly still rusty in some of his first games back from his suspen­sion last season. 
But McAlarney also strug­gled in blowout losses to Marquettn and Georgetown. 
Against Marquette, llarangody notched 29 points but had little help, partly because McAlarney was held to eight points by Golden Eagles guard Jerel McNeal. 
In the loss to Georgetown, llarangody had a rare poor showing. But even if the big man had played well, the Irish would not have been able to compete-McAiarney man­aged only 10 points on 4-of-15 shooting. 
You get the idea. The Irish 
can beat top-flight teams but 
only if their starting shooting 
guard brings his A-game. 
Tho !low of Notre Dame's 
win over Providence last 
Thursday illustrates the team's 
need for production from the 
New York native. 
McAlarney nailed two 3­pointers in the flrst six min­utflS of play as the Irish jumped out to a 21-9 lead. But he barely touched the ball for the remainder of the first half, and the Friars took the lead for much of the period. 
It wasn't until the Irish 
scored baskets on their final 
two possessions of the half 
that they regained the lead. 
llarangody drilled a jumper 
and Tory Jackson made a 
layup as the Irish took a 32-31 
margin into the locker room. 
Guess who had his first two 
assists of the game on that 
pair of buckets. That's right: 
McAlarney. 
And while the Irish went on 
to beat Providence in overtime 
with a limited contribution 
from McAiarney, Providence is 
not Marquette or Georgetown. 
In order for Notre Dame to 
beat the best teams in the Big 
East, the junior needs to step 
up and play at his top, elite 
level. 
Call it the Allen Iverson 
Corollary. Carmelo Anthony 
will give the Denver Nuggets 
20 points almost every game. 
But if Iverson shoots 6-of-22 
from the field, the Nuggets are 
hard-pressed to beat any of 
the best squads in the NBA. 
The same is true of Notre Dame; they need both Harangody and McAiarney to shine. Harangody is likely to come up big much more often than not. But the real question for the Irish is whether McAlarney can consistently outplay top defenders. His next test will arrive Saturday when McNeal and his teammates come to town.

Turning heads 
Irish forward Luke Harangody's sensational season has garnered national acclaim

Every week, Notre Dame comes together to study film ­and to laugh at the antics of l.uke Harangody.

He is sec­ond in rebounding in the Big East with 10.4 per game. His play this season earned him a spot in the top-30 for both the Wooden and Naismith Awards, two honors given to the best player of the year nationally. And he has opposing coaches, like Providence's Tim Welsh, saying he's the Big East player of the year. 

How did Harangody elevate his play? By playing with high intensity (Harangody can be seen yelling and seeking out chest-bumping teammates every time he has the potential for a 3-point play), and by play­ing a little "crazy." 
"When I step on the court, it's a different feeling," Harangody said. "I feel like you have to be kind of crazy, you have to be a little off to play in this league. You have to lose it out there." 
With the added attention comes extra ribbing from his teammates, who said they love to poke fun at the "sensitive" Harangody. 
"The guys on the team keep me focused," Harangody said. "They joke around with me. Zach, Ryan [Ayers], and Kyle [McAlarney] make fun of it all. So that just keeps me grounded and I try to stay humble. I have really good guys around me." 
But for all the fun they have at Harangody's expense, the Irish certainly don't take for granted how Harangody has helped them to a 7-2 record in the It was an easy transition because I learned how to do the little things." 
After entering Notre Dame a year and a half ago, not know­ing when or how much he would play, Harangody and

you have to talk 
what we want to do. We want to go down low to him because it helps out everything else for us offensively. He's never too cocky, but we do a good job of bringing him down to earth even if he doesn't need the real­ity check. We need him to keep performing like that because he's having a great year and if he keeps it up we have great things ahead of us." 
Last season, Harangody made an impact immediately, some­thing he didn't expect to hap­pen. 
"When I got here as a fresh­man, I didn't see myself playing any minutes at all," Harangody said. "I didn't even know if I could play in this league. So that was the hardest hump to get over confidence-wise ... I think right when we started practice, I started off with a couple of good practices and that gave me a lot of confidence and let me know I could play." 
With the help of his coaches and teammates, specifically senior forward Rob Kurz and former guard Colin Falls, Harangody learned to cope with the difficulty of the college game and developed into a con­sistent threat in the paint. 
"I don't think a lot of people understand how much Y.OU learn, how much more relaxed you get as you play more and more," Harangody said. "And it's the same thing this season. 
about that, but 
that's the reality of the business we're in and there's no question he has a very bright future after college. But he's the first one to raise his hand and say, There's still a lot of things I need to learn and do better,' but he has a bright future playing the game." 
First on Harangody's to-do list for the NBA is improving his defense. 
"I think he could always improve defensively," Brey said. "Both in man and zone, his awareness not guarding his guy but helping his teammates, that is still a process for him and we come back to that everyday." 
Harangody said he's well aware that his 6-foot-8 frame would be a disadvantage in the NBA, where he'd frequently face post players who are quick and in the neighborhood of seven feet tall, but he said he's determined to not let his height prevent him from accomplish­ing his goal of playing in the NBA. 
"People always talk about how I'm undersized and maybe they don't think I'll make it, but I don't think that's going to stop me at all," Harangody said. 
And he's well aware that he didn't play his best games against Georgetown's Roy Hibbert and Connecticut's Hasheem Thabeet, who are each over seven feet tall. Harangody scored 13 against 

Georgetown and scored 14 on 5-for-23 shooting against Connecticut. 
"The media's always asking, 'Oh, those were your only two bad games in conference,' and it had something to do with their size, but I just had two off games," Harangody said. "But I've watched tape and saw where I could use my body to get around them and bring them away from the basket. I'm learning. This is the first year I've really played against play­ers like that. That's one of the things this year that I've had to deal with the most and learn the most from." 
Harangody described himself as "shy" off the court and Brey has tried to help him deal with the increased attention by meeting with him frequently to keep his primary focus on bas­ketball. 
"We just need to limit his dis­tractions, because it is happen­ing fast for him," Brey said. "He's really level-headed and I have full confidence he can handle it, but I just want to make sure we're not over­whelming him and distracting him because we need him focused down the stretch." 
Harangody is not your typical college basketball star. He's noL one of the one-and-done fresh_.. men who blanket ESPN, and he certainly isn't going for style points night in and night out. But he's a consistent, hustling, and dominating presence in the paint. 
"He is so focused and every objective, mission or goal or assignment, he meets with what you see," Brey said. 
And if the success ever goes to his head, he has his team­mates, like Hillesland, to keep him grounded. 
"He's just a big bear. He's a big bear of a man on the court and he's a sensitive bear off the court. He even has bear hair," Hillesland said. "But he's just a really good kid and we're happy for all the success he's having."

Bottom Line 
Veterans of the system, they throw around the student government catchphrases -pursuing the presidency as "a way to give back" and vow­ing to "make a tangible difference" -better than anyone. They know what goals are practi­cal and what students respond to most strongly. But for Braun to claim "nothing about this is about resumes" only sounds hollow. The pair does have extensive experience, and it shows; when asked about a shuttle bus, Braun quickly recognized the University's hesitation and sug­gested a bus that just covered the bars, implying that students using the shuttle would be of age. And the relationship Braun established this year with members of the South Bend Common Council would likely be valuable next fall, when the issue of student partying could once again rankle the sensibilities of neighborhood resi­dents.

"No one thinks they're bad at tetherball -it's kind of like beer pong." 
Bottom Line 
When asked why he's running for president, Ehrlich responded, "Why not, right?" 
lie views his campaign with Roscitt as partly a "social experiment" -an alternative to the Braun and Heish tickets. ("Two sides of the same coin," he said.) His attitude is different. Whether the student body would rally around tetherball poles on the quad, however, isn't clear. Whether the University would turn the reflecting pool into a skating rink also isn't clear, though he consid­ers it feasible. ("We put a man on the moon and we have a $4 billion endowment. I don't know why we wouldn't do it.") Ehrlich's focus on get­ting Notre Dame to officially recognize a gay-les­bian student group is admirable, and he's right that it should seriously be addressed. Except that it is, year after year, and the University continues to stonewall. It's unclear what he would do to make it work.

Most Feasible Idea: Weekday SUB films would require little extra expenditure, and students would likely attend cheap flicks rather than study all night. 

+ 
Least Feasible Idea: The shuttle bus. It would be great, but the Board of Trustees is unlikely to change its veto from the last time student govern­ment tried this.

Bottom Line 

The pair calls its idea to institute a shuttle bus for students heading back to campus on late weekend nights "ambitious, but doable." If only. While Kelly and Poelhuis are perfectly sincere when they say they'll do it, they may be unaware of just how quickly a similar idea tanked in 2004. Kelly and Poelhuis's plan is even broader than the 2004 "SafeBus" propos­al, which did not include the Thursday night service Kelly and Poelhuis propose. Still, the Board of Trustees didn't go for the "drunk bus" then, and it's doubtful any of those liability issues have disappeared. That doesn't mean it's not a worthy idea, however, just not enough to base a platform on. Their lack of experience at the campus wide level of student gov­ernment could also stand in their way, despite their emphasis on their strong communications skills.

In Their Words 
+ 
Top Priority: Organize a Midwest Intercollegiate Council of student government leaders from universities throughout the region. 

+ 
First Priority: Enact free DVD rentals through student government. And conduct in­depth surveys of student bodies to find out what students want. 


In Our Words 
+ 
Best Idea: Off-campus discounts -low prices and prompting students to get off campus is a winning combination. Also, the Last Lecture series would allow students to get to know the great professors they can't have in class. 

+ 
Worst Idea: The senate student outreach committee is well-intentioned but unnecessary. 



Deepening the bureaucracy of student govern­ment is not the way of the future. 
+Most Feasible Idea: Free DVD rentals. The DVDs are sitting unwatched in the student government offices. 
+ 
Least Feasible Idea: Improve the quality of drink­ing water in the Rock. 

+ 
Fun Fact: Reish ate sticks of butter as a child. Schmidt can put 20 sunflower seeds in his mouth and spit them out -sMds and shells separated -10 sec­onds later. 

+ 
Notable Quote: "If we accomplish only two of these platform ideas, but students feel their voice was heard ... I think that's so much more successful" 


Bottom Une 
These guys take student government seriously -too seriously, some might argue. (Reish has been involved ever since he was student body president in high school, and Schmidt looked at student government opportunities on different campuses before choosing Notre Dame.) But that means they're taking this cam­paign seriously. The amount of research they've con­ducted is impressive, and they've already begun form­ing the administrative and intercollegiate contacts they'll need to get their often-ambitious ideas off the ground. Reish and Schmidt would bring perhaps the most comprehensive plan to office, complete with ideas for improving academic, athletic, community relations, social, student government and other areas of student life. They plan to conduct a survey to choose which ini­tiatives to focus on. Look out for the Midwest Intercollegiate Council to boost Notre Dame's reputa­tion.

DISSENTING OPINION 

Reish and Schmidt for president and vice president 
Student government can catch a lot of flack. When you take the most polished and ambitious of a fairly polished and ambitious stu­dent body and give them a limit­nd arena in which to apply their talents, the resulLc;; can seem a bit forced. 
Bill Ehrlich would indeed bring a breath of fresh air to the stufly, programmed and oh-so-sincere world of student government. After all, he fon~swears power suits. I lis goal of pressuring the administration into recognizing a gay, lesbian, bisf~xual and trans­gender student group is laudable, though it remains unclear how he plans to enact the negative publicity campaign he says will force the change. Ilis other cam­paign goals are limited but harm­less. 
Ehrlich has endeared himself to student government cynics by student government with an out­showing witty disregard for the sider's perspective but an insid­otlice he aspires to hold, but his er's knowledge and ability. overbearing confidence is likely The research and networking to turn off administrators and they've used to create their prevent productivity within gov­extensive platform is impressive ­ernment and col-but not as impressive laboration with­as their commitment out.

After the party permit ordinance debates this fall, these relationships have proven more important than ever. 
And on a broader level, the pair's ideas for a Midwestern Intercollegiate Council could enhance student life at Notre Dame while contributing to the University's reputation as a leader among institutions of higher learning. In the Northeast, the Ivy Council has allowed Ivy League universities to enact more rapid changes in campus life through an open exchange among peer institutions. 
The real key to success for Reish and Schmidt will be their ability to pursue good ideas that are not already found in their extensive platform. They should consider ways to realize Ehrlich's goal of pressuring the University to recognize a gay, lesbian, bisex­ual and transgender student group; Kelly and Poelhuis's sug­gestion that SUB screen films during the week and Hollowood and Tomala's push for inclusion of The Wall Street Journal in the College Readership Program. 
After a year marked by a need for real student government leadership, it is essential the stu­dent body choose a capable and committed ticket with the drive to make changes and the desire to hear student voices. 
For these reasons, a minority of The Observer Editorial Board endorses Bob Heish and Grant Schmidt for student body presi­dent and vice president.
