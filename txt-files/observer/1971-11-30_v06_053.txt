Vol. VI, No. 53 
Merger hopes killed; speculation rampant 
by Ann Therese Darin 

Observer Associate Editor 
Informed sources revealed over the long weekend that plans for a Notre Dame-St. Mary's merger, in the offing for almost a year, have been scrapped by Trustees of the two schools. 
Edmund A. Stephan, chairman of Notre Dame's Board of Trustees, and Mother Olivette Whelan, chairman of St. Mary's Board, are scheduled to issue "an im­portant announcemnt" through the university office of public information this afternoon. 
Notre Dame President Theodore Hesburgh said that two seperate statements are being prepared. One was released to the ND faculty this morning. The other statement will be released at 2 o'clock this afternoon. 
Hesburgh declined to comment on the contents of the two statements. He said that they were prepared by represen­tatives of both schools. 
Reportedly the statement will in­definitely suspend unification. In the same release, sources revealed that the University will announce its intent to accept women students for the 1972-73 academic year. 
'Although the statement allegedly will not stipulate the number of women to be admitted, some university administrators aooroximated the number at 400. 
The statement supposedly says that the University will not terminate coeducational programs with St. Mary's College. SMC, however, may have to start paying for present coexchange services which include cafeteria exchange, shuttle bus transportation between the two campuses, tuition per credit hour for coexchange classes, and fees for the use of university computers to program students schedules, payrolls, and report cards. 
While the two schools still desire unifications, the statement allegedly contends, the Trustees are still far apart on terms. 
Stephan could not be reached for, comment. In Chicago, his secretary revealed he will be in Russia until Dec. 7. Likewise Mother Olivette Whelan was unavailable for comment. 
ND Trustee's secratary, Paul F. Hellmuth, claimed he had not yet received notification of the plans yesterday af­ternoon in Boston. 
William Cahill, a 10-year member of the St. Mary's Board, however, denied that the two boards had terminated unification plans. C~hill attended the Ad-Hoc meeting on Unification Nov. 20-21, with St. Mary's representatives P. Jordan Hamel and Srs. Olivette, Alma, and Gerald. Notre Dame's representatives to the meeting included H.ev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, president; executive vice-president Rev. Edmund Joyce; Provost Rev. James T. Burtchaell, Trustees Student Affairs Committee Chairman Thomas Carney, and Stephan. 
In Chicago, Cahill said that, "I felt the meeting was very satisfactory. In fact, there is another meeting planned before Chirstmas." 
"I can't speak for Notre Dame," he 
continued. "We certainly haven't with­
drawn at St. Mary's though." 
He felt, however, students are 
"overemphasizing" the finances of the 
merger. He indicated faculty contracts 
and merger of administrations are critical 
points. 

"The joint budget alone is a tough 
problem," he related. "as for SMC; faculty 
contracts for next year, Notre Dame 
originally agrees to issue them. They 
didn't realize at the time, the depth of the 
problem. There are personnel problems to 
be resolved-and you can't put a general 
solution to specific problems." 
P. Jordan Hamel the other lay SMC member of the Ad-Hoc Committee, will be out of town <Chicago) until Dec. 2. It could not be ascertained whether he attended the meeting. Some SMC faculty have in­dicated that all of the listed represen­tatives did not attend the meeting which may have thrown its results into jeopardy. While Cahill felt the merger would be 
continued, · apparently other SMC 
representatives to the Ad-Hoc Committee 
believed differently. 
In Boston, the consulting board of the college region for the Sisters of the Holy Cross, owners of the college property, sent a telegram last weekend to the Ad-Hoc Committee meeting. 
According to one sister present at the meeting, the wire said the board, "deplored the breaking off of the merger." SMC representatives present at the assembly included Srs. Alma, acting president; Elena, theology instructor; and Franzita, English instructor. 
Late last week Sr. Alma sent letters to all SMC professors describing the ten­sions. In the letter, she indicated she would meet today at 1:00 pm with SMLC department chairman to discuss the situation. 
She also scheduled meetings with the rank and tenure committee (2:00 p.m.) and with the faculty (4:30 pm). At the faculty meeting, Mother Olivette Whelan will speak. 
Notre Dame officials, however, denied they had planned any meetings to inform their faculty of the changes. 
Notre Dame students may receive letters from Fr. Burtchaell in their mailboxes confirming the actions of the administration today or tomorrow. 
Transfering? 
Although university admissions officials admitted they were as unclear an anyone on campus about the coeducation an­nouncement, they clarified admissions procedure for upper class transfer students. 
John Goldrick, an admissions officer, 
indicated an applicant must have 30 hours 
of credit from an accredited college or 
university. 
Students wishing to transfer or even thinking about a move should contact the admissions office to arrange an ap­pointment with a counselor.

Nixon threatens tax bill veto 

by Eileen Shanahan 

(c) 1971 New York Times 
Washington, Nov. 29--­President Nixon warned Congress today that he would veto the tax bill if it contained either the controversial plan to finance presidential campaigns out of tax funds or what were termed "budget-busting" amendments added by the Senate. 
The veto statement, conveyed by Clark MacGregor, was the most unequivocal to date. 
But many members of Congress, including some Republicans, expressed some doubt that Nixon really meant exactly what MacGregor said. 
Wilbur D. Mills of Arkansas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the veto talk was "a polite way of

In co-operation with the hall presidents, all co-ex meal tickets will be distributed through the individual halls, Gary Caruso, co-ex director announced. 
No more tickets will be available at the Notre Dame Student Government Office. The move was taken at the request of the Hall Presidents' Council. 
Distribution at St. Mary's will remain essentially the same as before, except that the tickets at LeMans, Regina, and Holy Cross will only be offered on a day-to­day basis, rather than on the weekly schedule previously

putting pressure on Congress and it's not the first time." There had been similar veto threats-­though not quite so strongly worded---against the 1969 tax reform and reduction bill, which Nixon ultimately signed. 
John W. Byrnes of Wisconsin, the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, described the situation as a war of nerves between the Democrats and the White House. 
The disputed campaign finance provision was attached by the Senate to a tax bill that "is really needed," Byrnes said. He added, "We do need the tax stimulus" that would be provided by the tax reductions the bill provides for both businesses and individuals. 
The bill has passed both the House and the Senate. The joint House-Senate Conference Committee, drawn from the senior members of the tax committees of both houses, began working today on com­promising the differences and writing the final version. 
While no one would predict what the conference committee would decide in the face of Nixon's veto threat, Mills said he thought a bill stripped of most of the extra tax reductions voted by the Senate, but retaining all the campaign finance provisions, would be very hard for Nixon to veto. 

The bill as originally passed by the House of Representatives would reduce the taxes paid by businesses and individuals by $26.6 billion in the current year and the next two. That is about the amount originally requested by Nixon. As passed by the Senate, the bill would n·duce taxes by $38.2 billion over the same period. 
The Senate provision on campaign financing that the White House objects to is only one part of a two-part plan that the Senate adopted. 
That is the portion that would permit any taxpayer to check a box on his tax return instructing the government to divert $1 of his taxes---$2 in the case of a married couple--to finance the next presidential election campaign.

New Delhi--Indian and Pakistani forces clashed for the third con­secutive day in the Hilli region of East Pakistan, according to Indian officials. At a briefing near the border, the officials said that Pakistani troops had launched a counterattack against Indian forces that had entered East Pakistan as a defensive measure. 
Washington--The State Department said that President Nixon sent personal messages to India, Pakistan and the Soviet Union urging an end to the fighting along the India-Pakistan border. The note to Moscow, a reliable source said, asked the Soviet Union to use its in­fluence with India to prevent the outbreak of full-scale war. 
Washington--President Nixon's chief White House lobbyist, Clark MacGregor, told Congress that Nixon would veto the tax-cut bill if it contained either the plan to finance presidential campaigns with tax funds or what were called "budget-busting" amendments added by the Senate.

Thanksgiving Turkey 
from the Trustees 
It was thoughtful of the Trustees to cook up such a nice Thanksgiving surprise for the student body. After platitudinizing most sonorously about the long-overdue merger, select groups of Trustees---meeting in secret, as per the usual---turned around and cancelled the merger "in­definitely"---which means forever. 
It was a particularly nice surprise for the St. Mary's fresh­men and sophomores who willingly contracted themselves to two years of inferior education at St. Mary's in expectation of an eventual Notre Dame education and a Notre Dame degree at the end of the process.. Itwas a particularly nice surprise for American Studies and General Program majors from St. Mary's and Drama and Education majors from Notre Dame, who will find themselves without a department as the co­exchange programs disintegrate. 
Apparently an inability to settle on one budget for the two schools---the Holy Cross nuns were hot after more than a few pounds of flesh in return for the use of their buildings---finally did the merger in. No matter what the coroner will eventually dredge up as the ultimate cause for the merger's tragic ter­mination, connoisseurs of the morbid will have a high old time these next couple of weeks trying to figure out the behavior of the Holy Cross nuns, the Powers behind the Thrones and Dominations currently running the college. They must have known that the alternative to merger was an independently coeducational Notre Dame---an alternative that would turn St. Mary's into a finishing school for morons. 
So it goes. So it always goes. The question remains: what good can Notre Dame make out of this bleak situation? Well, it can renew its commitment to go co-ed---on their own, this time. It would mean that the university would have to cut down on the number of males admitted---so be it. It would mean that the university would finally have to implement some of the discoveries about dormitory utility its numerous studies have found---so be it. It would also mean that St. Mary's would be forced to swallow what it created out of whole cloth. That's worth all the other discommodities combined. 
The University can also lure Education and Drama faculty from St. Mary's so that Notre Dame can legitimately award degrees to its Drama and Education majors. It would mean that Notre Dame would have to strain its budget and expand its facilities, but that is a more attractive alternative than stranding the thirty-some Notre Dame drama and education majors; rendering their three years of education useless. 
The University can also take steps to lure St. Mary's best students out of that college and into Notre Dame. Easy transference of St. Mary's credit for students with a suf­ficiently high grade point ought to do the trick. 
After that, officials of the University of Notre Dame can sit back, smoke cigars, and wait until they can acquire St. Mary's buildings in a bankruptcy auction. St. Mary's---Sister Alma and all---ought to last about ten years as a minor league convent. After that the campus can be divvied up between Notre Dame to its East and the dairy farm to its West.

China is a Fragile Issue 

New York Times 
Washington, (Nov. 11)--With the arrival of the Peking diplomats in· 
New York, the Nixon administration is beginning to put aside its 
disappointment over the Taiwan issue and adjust to the new realities 
of dealing with Mainland China. 
Much remains to be done in preparation for President Nixon's trip to 
Peking. The agenda for his talks with Chou En Lai and otherChinese 
officials has not yet been completed. In fact the Communist Govern­
ment is apparently once more in turmoil, with the line of political 
succession still very much in doubt. This has introduced an element of 
confusion, if not of doubt, into the arrangements. 
Also, it may give some notion of China's isolation to remember that 
the section of the Peking Foreign office that deals with the United 
States is known as "the Australian, Western Europe and American 
division." Most of the Chinese in the Peking delegation have never 
been in the U.S. before, so the immediate concern of officials here is to 
provide for their security and do whatever they can to make the 
transition into the New York Community as comfortable as possible. 
Even so, this initial period of transition places some delicate 
problems before the U.S. and Chinese governments. There may not be 
"two Chinas" in the United Nations, but there are still "two Chinas" in 
the U.S., with an aggrieved and even bitter Taiwan mission here in 
Washington, supported by many loyal followers who resent the arrival 
of the men from Peking. 
Dealing with Moscow and Tokyo in this transitional period will be almost as difficult as dealing with Peking and Taiwan. Nixon has to go to Moscow after his trip to Peking, and probably to Tokyo next sum­mer, so while seeking the "normalization of relations" with the New China, he has to be careful not appear to do so at the expense of U.S. relations with Japan and the Soviet Union. 
After all, important as China is, the question of controlling the arms race, avoiding war in the Middle East, and keeping the lid on Berlin, are essentially Washington-Moscow problems, and the question of organizing a new monetary and trade policy in the world is more important in Japan and Europe, at this point of history, than in China. 
Accordingly, Washington is is now approaching these questions with less drama and speed than it did in the initial stages of its new China and new economic policies. It is more conscious now of the need for closer consultation with the Soviets and the Japanese, and it is beginning to protect itself on the home front by warning that the Nixon mission to Peking is just the beginning of a very long and complicated process and that it would be unwise to expect too much from a single visit. 
This is a much more realistic attitude than the sudden diplomacy out of Washington in recent months. Nixon's opening to Peking is still regarded by both parties and most observers here as a wise, bold, and historic stroke, but it has created some tension in both governments and starred a process of reappraisal in most of the capitals of Asia and Europe, so the tempo has been reduced here to give everybody time to adjust. 
Fortunately, Chou En Lai seems to agree that this is a time for modest expectations. He told the managing editor of Tyokyo's Asahi Shim bun the other day: "we must be very cautious. This does not mean that we lack self-confidence; it means that coution is required, and that we must not be indiscreet or haphazard." Earlier, he said in another interview: "We do not expect a settlement of all questions at one strike. That is not possible. That would not be practicable. But by contacting one another, we may be able to find out from where we should start in solving these problems." 
That is now precisely the new modest approach of the White House and the State Department. On the testimony of Peking officials, Henry Kissinger has approached them in this vein in his preparations for Nixon's trip, and now, with senior officials of the government of China in New York, a new line of communication has been opened for quiet and careful discussion of common problems. 
This is one illustration of the practical function of the United Nations in New York. There were many arguments against locating the world organization in the commercial capital of one of the major nations of the world, but there are some advantages. 
It is big enough to swallow even the U.N., and to permit private disucssion of even the most sensitive international questions. Which is perhaps another way of saying that only in mass and diversity, can diplomats elude reporters in a Democratic society, and maybe this is not always a bad idea. 
For~ the U.N., even though Peking and Washington are a very long way from establishing normal diplomatic relations, they now have an instrument for negotiations, if both sides choose to use it. It will be a long time before Peking and Washington move from hostility to understanding --maybe as long as their 21-year separation --and Peking's moralistic and ideological approach to world politics may very well make them more difficult than the soviets and the soviet vetoes at the U.N. over the past 25 years, but at least there is a change in attitude. There is a new private avenue for negotiation, and a new opportunity for the Chinese to observe the West in New York. And if they can adjust to "fun city" who knows, they might even be able to help bring some kind of common sense into this distracted world.

joseph abe/1 
everything you wanted to know about thanksgiving at school* 
Dear Mom, 
Thought I was coming home for Thanksgiving? Fooled you didn't I? You should know by now that rides to Texas for four lousy days don't exist (leave early? Me, a Notre Dame student? Mother, please!). Besides, there are much more interesting things to do up here in the rain and sleet. 
The first inklings of what could be done with four bleak days (yes, I remember last year) came about two weeks ago. A din­ner! Why not? All I gotta do is get enough dum-dums that are hanging around to help pay for it, get a hold of an oven, and have a riot. 
Too bad it wasn't that easy .... 
First problem was finding people that were staying. Everybody was going home, no matter if they lived in Mishawaka or Honolulu. Three frustrating hours on the phone proved this. But was I to be daun­ted? Never! I persisted. 
Wednesday morning arrived, and a motley bunch of seven had finally been assembled: myself; Jim McDermott, illustrious night editor of the Observer; Jerry Lutkus, equally picturesque news editor of that same publication; Maria Gallagher, up and coming reporter and love-note accepter; plus three of Lutkus' Badin buddies. We probably would have had more, but we were too honest not to tell who was doing the ('Ooking. No matter! Seven was enough for the culinary devestation soon to be committed! 
Wednesday afternoon: the first of our many excursions to the friendly market. Jim, Maria, and I all piled into Maria's chauffered (by Maria> Datsun for the journey to the A&P. Thirty minutes later (and $17.06 less) we staggered out under the load of a full dinner-in-the-making-. We paused a brief moment to glare at Mc­Dermott again for his insistence on fresh vegetables, and real butter. ("Don't worry; I'll take care of all that.") 
Thursday morning: first thing, I oversleep (nothing unusual there). 
1 dressed warmly and, my eating utensils and TV (for the Big Game) slung over my shoulder, I managed to straggle over to Regina Hall, where Maria had already begun chopping celery and apples for the stuffing. That was about 9:30. I got there about 11, and she had just about got the stuffing finished. So, I thought, guess I gotta get started, too; first things first---l'll make the pumpkin pie. 
I<:asier said than done. With four dif­fering recipes (both the pumpkin and the pie-spice cans had their own ideas of how it should gol, I was a little undecided, so I used them all---just added up all the measurements and divided by four. Didn't come out so bad, either---a little, uh, "crisp" around the edges, but not bad for a novice. 
Meanwhile, Maria was having a few problems with the great 13-pound beast, the turkey. After a brief struggle with a piece of wire holding the legs together, she managed to open it enough to fill it up with her concoction of assorted ingredients. One problem, though: 

"Where are the rest of the giblets? All 
we've got is the neck." 
A careful search followed, but still no 
luck, so an emergency phone call went out 
to Delaware for making gravy without 
giblets, while another trip back to Notre 
Dame was made for my set of recipes. 
I was in luck this trip. I had a car, and 
managed to grab Jerry Lutkus in the 
bargain. Jer, always keeping the proper 
things at the top of his priority list, asked, 
"Where's the booze?" 

"I thought you were gonna get it", I told 
him. 

"Clifford was supposed to." 
"Didn't he call you?" 
"WhPn'?" 

"I guess not," I mused. "Well, so much 
for booze ... " 

But always-resourceful Jer was willing 
to try, even on a supposed holiday like 
Thanksgiving, so after deciding on Chablis 
and White Port, he went out in to the void 
of closed storefronts to see what he could 
do. 

Meanwhile, Jim arrived, and went 
straight to his work. A second trip to the 
A&P the night before even provided him 
with his precious beef boullion cubes, so 
we figured he was happy, and left him to 
his beans and Brussels sprouts. 
Maria and I went on to bigger and better 
things. She set the table most daintily, 
complete with a tablecloth courtesy of St. 
Mary's linen service and centerpiece 
courtesy of a last minute thoughtful 
gesture of her parents. At the same time, I 
tried to put more records on the stereo we 
had brought down for the day. 
She seemed to be doing better than I, for the turntable didn't feel like turning. "Maybe it's between speeds," she suggested. 
"No, no, no, couldn't be," I mumbled, checking out every control. Finally, I gave up and turned to the TV. Almost time for the Big Game anyway, I rationalized. Sh£: came over, flipped the turntable speed control into the groove, and we had Chicago and Cat Stevens all over the kitchen. I quietly stepped out of the room and screamed. 
Jpr came back soon after, with a grin on his face and a large package under his arm. We grinned as he slipped it into the refrigerator, and told him to go watch the Game; he had done his good deed for the day. 
Suddenly, great news came from the direction of the turkey: that large bulge at the neck was the missing giblets. And they were found none too soon, for we were about to place the turkey, stuffing, giblets­with-their-plastic-bag, and all into a 475­degree hell. So Maria tore out the bag, whipped up some more stuffing to fill the hole, and stuck it into the oven. 
Onwards to the other parts of the dinner! A glorious statement, but I wasn't feeling very glorious after being handed a dinner 


knife and five pounds of spuds to peel. 
I was soon called back to the kitchen. Jim 
and Maria had managed to get themselves 
in a hassle about the yams and were 
making a mess of them. I let them be and 
began on my most frustrating task of the 
day: the whipped cream. 
Now, we had bought, very economically, 
a double package of whipped cream mix 
("all you add is milk and vanilla, whip, 
and whipped cream in an instant"). What 
we had failed to buy is vanilla and enough 
milk. 

"Aw, what the hell," I said, pouring tn 
what little milk we had and adding some 
evaporated milk leftover from somewhere 
along with some water. I then began 
beating it with an eggbeater 
Ever try to match the speed of a high­
power mixer? With an eggbeater? It 
doesn't work. Forty-five minutes later, the 
cream was just as watery and bland as 
before. 

"Need some help?" Jim wandered up. 
"Got any ideas?" I said. 
"No vanilla?" 
"Right." 

"Here, try this," he said, pouring some

I twirled the beater some more and

commented. 

"No problem," he said, generously 
adding more. 

"Great. Now what about the whipped 
part?" 

"That's your problem." 
"Thanks." 

I couldn't help feeling that there I was, a 
Notre Dame student, and a mere bowl of whipped cream was defeating me. Well, by God, I won't let it! I began to furiously spin the rusty beater, and soon I was rewarded with a semi-thick white substance. 
Maria, meanwhile, was having her own problems with the mashed potatoes. She and Jim had already sorted out the yams and had set them to cooking. Now, she was quaintly attempting to mash out the lumps of the spuds I had peeled earlier with nothing more than a wooden spoon. 
~·wen, it's not my fault; that's all we have!" 
I offered my rusty eggbeater, but the potatoes were too thick for the beaters to turn. We gave up and the wooden spoon went back to work. 
Tension began to build as Jerry's friends arrived. Last-minute preparation of the gravy, a quick throwing-together of a fruit cocktail salad, and an eleventh-hour debate as to the "doneness" of the turkey all followed one after another as we eagerly awaited the start of our first full­blown dinner. 
Jim's strange mixtures took on a rather

Finally, everything was finished and on the table. It took the combined strenghth of Jerry, Jim, and myself to coax the cork out of the Chablis as Maria ducked up­stairs to change into a flowing traditional skirt. At long last, we were ready. 
So with mucho gastric noises all around, we sat down and began. 
Strangely enough, the meal itself was uneventful. Since I was the one elected to hold the knife in the pictures, I was also elected to use the knife for everyone's portion. After a few good introductory cuts, I then proceeded to hack the bird to

The pumpkin pie soon  followed, along  

with my apprehensions (if anyone was to blame for this part, it was me alone). But surprise of surprises, it was accepted with a vague semblence of praise, and I was allowed my small ego trip for the day. 
Coffee and after-dinner conversation proceeded afterwards, and before anyone knew it, it was all over.Jerry's friends washed the dishes and cleaned up, but for the three cooks, it was ended. 
Somehow, we had done it--transformed a wild idea in the head of a hungry sophomore into a complete Thanksgiving dinner. So what if the pie was "crisp." So what if the potatoes still had a few lumps in them. So what if everyone had shreds of turkey meat, and wine served in tumblers. It was better than the South Dining Hall, and most of all, it was our own. We'll never forget it. I know I won't, thanks to Maria, Jim, and Jerry. 
But next year, we'll really know what we're doing! See you at Christmas, and no, I won't cook dinner. Love, Joe

68. Moscow was seeking an ally to help contain China. Mrs. Gandhi was seeking guarantees against both China and Pakistan and also leftist domestic support at a moment of peril for her divided 'Congress Party. 
The relationship blossomed, but the passions for a formal treaty cooled and the papers were laid aside. Mrs. Gandhi went on to fashion a staggering two-thirds majority in this year's election. An agricultural revolution dispelled the once ever-present dread of famine. The promise of rapid develop­ment at home replaced the mane_uvering abroad. ·-And then came the shattering developments in East Bengal and there were the Russians, treaty in hand. 
As the fear of war with Pakistan grippped India yet again, and millions of 'Bengali refugees arrived to drain the development kitty, the U.S. again appeared far away and preoccupied with other causes. At that crucial moment, the Indians say, President Nixon's National Security Adviser, Henry Kissinger, delivered a warning that China might not remain aloof from war and that if attacked, India should not expect the kind of emotional and indirect support she received from the U.S. in 1962. 
When Kissinger stopped over on his secret journey to Peking via Pakistan last July, he is said to have repeated this shattering counsel. He was treated cooly and he responded appropriately. And soon enough the Indians learned of his real errand in Asia. Bitterly, they concluded that they now understood the Ameican refusal to cut off the residual arms shipments to Pakistan and the American reluctance to be pitted even diplomatically against China on India's behalf.

Nixon's visit to Red China set for late Feb. 
by Bernard Gwertzman 
(C) 1971 New York Times 
WASHINGTON, NOV.29-­President Nixon's visit to China, the first by a United States Chief of State, will begin on Feb. 21, the White House announced today. 
A one-sentence statement, issued simultaneously in Peking, ended weeks of speculation on when the visit would take place but provided no further details. Ronald L. Ziegler, the White House Press Secretary, said he would have more information on the trip tomorrow. It is expected that the visit will last about one week. 
The visit to China, with an announced goal of seeking a normalization of relations bet­ween the two countries, will occur more than a month after Nixon completes a round of talks with key Western leaders. 
Those talks are aimed at shoring up allied unity at a time of stress caused by Nixon's tough economy policy and his dramatic moves to improve relations with both Peking and Moscow. 
Rat-race starting 
The Registrar's Office 
disclosed yesterday that 
Graduate, Fifth Year and Senior 
students will begin second 
semester pre-registration on 
Thursday, December 2. 
University Registrar Richard 
Sullivan, also revealed that 
juniors could register on Friday, 
December 3, and Sophomores on 
December 6 through 9. 
"Pre-registration will run from Thursday to Thursday," said Sullivan. "Forms (form 50's) will be distributed through the mail. Each class will have their forms in time for registration and all check­marked courses must be ap­proved by the departments." 
The cold north winds are blowing. 

Nixon is scheduled to visit the Soviet Union in May --the first visit there by a President since the wartime crimean Conference in 1945. 
The joint statement on the China visit, as read by Ziegler to newsmen said: 
"The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the United States of America have agreed that President Nixon's visit to 
China  shall  begin  on  Feb.  21,  
1972."  
The  timing  of  the  visit  in­ 

dicates that N ixonwanted to wait for the State of the Union address and budget message to be out ot the way before he left the country. Those traditional reports to Congress usually take place in January. 
The trip will take place while campaigning for the nation's first primary election is taking place in New Hampshire. That primary,which traditionally kicks off the presidential cam­paigning, will be held on March 7. 
Nixon's journey has been in­tensely discussed here and abroad ever since the President startled the world on July 15 by announcing that he had accepted an invitation to visit China sometime before next May. 
He disclosed then that the groundwork for the meeting had been carried out by Henry A. Kissinger, his national security adviser, during a secret ·Visit. to Peking between July 9 and 11. 
Ziegler, in reply to questions today, said that the purpose of the trip was the same as that announced on July 15: "To seek the normalization of relations between the two countries and also to exchange views on questions of concern to the two sides." 
Kissinger returned to Peking last month on a publicized mission to discuss details of the visit with Premier Chou En-Lai and other Chinese officials. Ziegler said that the date of the visit was actually decided upon during that second Kissinger journey. 
Ziegler, apparently seeking to rebut some speculation that the

. . 
Chinese were presenting ob­stacles to the trip, said that "preparations continue to go well and the general framework has been established." 
What we have been doing (since the second Kissinger trip) is tying down the surrounding details so we would be in a position to make the an­nouncemfnt I have given you today." Further details, such as the length of the trip, stops that will be made, and the size of the party will be made public tomorrow, he indicated. 
Administration officials have major substantive developments to result from Nixon's visit to Peking. They have said that they doubted that China would agree to establishing diplomatic relations so long as Washington continued its support for the Nationalist Chinese regime on Taiwan. Nixon has stressed the continuing U .S.backing for Taiwan. 

The general impression given here is that the administration is hoping for some kind of accord on establishing cultural, scientific and educational ex­changes and for the start of some
