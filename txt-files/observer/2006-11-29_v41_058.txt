ND, SMC see increase in black freshmen 
National journal praises University's continued efforts to encourage minority enrollment 

By MARCELA BERRIOS 
News Writer 
Only one year after University President Father John Jenkins articulated the need for increased diversity at Notre Dame in his inaugural address, the number of black and other minority appli­cants enrolled in the Univel'sity this fall is up significantly -and a national publication has taken notice. 
The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education (JBI-IE) completed a survey of the admissions offices of the highest-ranked national uni­versities, and praised Notre Dame's "concerted effort to increase the number of black and other minority students on cam­pus." 
The JBHE said better outreach programs and an increase in the financial aid available to low­income students contributed to the 10 percent increase in the number of African-American applicants and the 44 percent increase in the enrollment of admitted black applicants at Notre Dame. 
The JBHE reported 53.4 percent of admitted black applicants enrolled in the University, making it the fifth highest enrollment rate

Zahm struggles with culture shift 
Students, alumni say change began with new rector and more rule enforcement in 2003 
By MADDIE HANNA News Writer 
Editor's note: This is the first story in a two-part series examining changes to resi­dence life within Zahm Hall and what those changes mean to the campus community. 
Its dorm-wide dining hall din­ners are legendary, its residents are unabashedly rowdy at pep rallies and it's notorious for sending hundreds of naked males to streak through LaFortune in the dead of win­ter. 
Zahm Hall, a dorm widely regarded as both fanatical and close-knit, has drawn compar­isons to a fraternity for years­but students and alumni say the basis for that connection is fading, and the dorm's rector maintains the portrayal is far from accurate. 
"One big, big problem with Zahm actually -this is some­thing we don't talk about often -is that the campus, I think, or at least parts of it, want us to be something like that. They want there to be a bad boy dorm, or a frat boy, frat house, that kind of dorm," Father Dan Parrish said. "Because it kind of gives them a whipping boy, someone to make jokes about." 
That "bad boy" image, Parrish said, is an unfair ­and unfounded-stereotype. 
"It really concerns me that when my freshman parents show up on campus, that the

Journalist 
speaks at 
University 
Editor for The New York Times visits ND 
By RYAN SYDLIK News Writer 

As part of Notre Dame's con­tinuing push to bring top names in journalism to campus, Jill Abramson, managing editor of The New York Times, was a 
guest of sev­eral journal­ism classes on Monday and Tuesday. 

Abramson -one of the top women in her field ­also met with 


students and Abramson faculty infor­mally Monday and Tuesday, events that included sharing cof­fee with University President Father John Jenkins and Provost Thomas Burish on Tuesday. 
Her visit was scheduled to last longer, but personal matters forced Abramson to leave unex­pectedly Tuesday night. 
Despite the shortened visit, those involved in the Notre Dame Gallivan Program in Journalism, Ethics and Democracy -a minor for students interested in journalism -were pleased that she accepted the offer to come. 
"The Keifer Endowment for Excellence in Journalism allow [the University] to bring a notable journalist to campus every year, and Jill Abramson is one of the most admired and

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Group discusses awareness tactics 
BySONIARAO News Writer 
Members discussed possible ways to generate interest in stu­dent government during Tuesday's meeting of the Council of Representatives (COR) in LaFortune. 
Student body vice president Bill Andrichik said recent Student Senate meetings have raised concerns about how aware stu­dents are of opportunities within student government. 
He pointed to several instances of "inconsistency" that could con­tribute to an apathetic attitude towards student government. These included "inconsistency in Judicial Council representatives in the dorms [with] a lot of peo­

Fetnale student body presidents set to speak 
By EMMA DRISCOLL 
News Writer 
It took Notre Dame 130 years to admit female stu­dents and another 29 years until the first female student body president, Brooke Norton, was elected in 2001. To date, there have been three female student body presidents -and all three will come together tonight at the event titled "We Can Do It! Women & Leadership at ND." 
Norton, 2002-03 student body president Libby Bishop and current student body president Lizzi Shappell will speak at the event, which is hosted by the Gender 
Relations Center (GRC). 
It "seem[edl like it was the right time to note that there have been three [female stu­dent body presidents! in the history of Notre Dame," said Heather Rakoczy, GRC direc­tor. 
Shappell said she feels priv­ileged to be one of the female student body presidents ­although she wishes it hadn't taken so long for women to take charge at Notre Dame. 
"I am definitely honored to be in this group of three with these other two women," she said. 
Each of the women will spend approximately 10 to 15 minutes addressing pre­

Registration reservations 
I sit at my desk surrounded by an array of course selection materials ­everything my advisor had to offer. I have my prospective schedule in front of me. My computer screen displays

could find.  
I'm physically ready and  Sports Writer  
mentally pre­ 

pared to schedule my classes for next semester. It's 12:39. My registration time is 
12:45. 
I'm not worried about getting the classes I want. All that worries me is whether I've made the right choic­es. I cross-check the classes with The Hours, second-guessing myself and my ability to construct a schedule. 

12:45. 
I'm in. My PIN works. The page looks like the tutorial said it should. My first three classes fall into place smoothly. 


12:46. I hit some roadblocks. Discussion sessions I need are full. Apparently, I have more AP credit than I thought-paradoxically mak­ing life more difficult. 
I worry more that a wrong choice will hinder my college career. No, I tell myself, that can't be right. Every course I'm taking fulfills a require­ment for either the University, the College of Arts and Letters or my major or minor. 
But is that the way it should be? 
Some say college is preparation for the real world. Others believe it to be the best four years of your life and think it should be treated as such. Should I take classes that will help guide me along the path I envision my life taking, and that will be useful to me? 
Or should I instead embrace the moment and take what I want to take? 
"Political Theory" is clearly the right decision. It meets both a University and an Arts and Letters requirement and looks interesting to boot. 
But the "History of American Sport" sure does look enticing. 
1:32. I stare glumly at my computer screen as it mocks my feeble attempts to salvage anything resembling a schedule. It says I'm in a class at 8:30 in the morning -a sure sign of a des­peration move. 
How much should things like that factor in? I wonder. College is a time that will mold me into who I am after I graduate, and I want to make deci­sions while here to ensure that I'm molded the way I see myself. But will doing that sacrifice my experience while here? 
1:45. I have a brainwave. I switch a MWF for a TR and the pieces of my scheduling puzzle fall into place per­fectly. Looking at my completed sched­ule, I come to the conclusion that tak­ing or not taking certain courses won't obstruct my ability to succeed. In fact, it will widen my base of knowledge, an important aspect of life. 
Every course will aid me in some way, and college will guide, not dic­tate, my life and career. I hope I'm right in my belief; if not, I won't find out until it's far too late to fix it. 
Oh well. At least I get to sleep until nine.

Squirrel fine after fiery chimney surprise 
lWO RIVERS, Wis. -One squirrel got a fiery surprise when it apparently got curi­ous about a chimney. The squirrel fell down a chimney at a Two Rivers home and landed in a fire in a fireplace Monday night, said Two Rivers Assistant Fire Chief Gary Shavlik. 
The squirrel escaped the fire and ran around the house, Shavlik said. 
Firefighters later caught it and called Wildlife of Wisconsin, an agency that helps wild animals. The squirrel suffered from bloody paws.

Auction to raise 111oney for charity

Despite the unseasonably pleasant weather, the holiday season is well underway at Notre Dame. And as part of the celebration, Pasquerilla East is hosting its signature charity event -the "Silent Night Silent Auction" ­tonight from 7 to 10 p.m. in the LaFortune Ballroom. 
Students, faculty and staff will have the opportunity to bid on items like footballs signed by legendary NFL quarterback Joe Montana and Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn, tickets to see a Chicago Cubs baseball game, a digital printer and multiple themed baskets.

Kroc celebrates 20th anniversary 
Special to The Observer 
A cake with candles might seem the natural complement to the celebration marking the 20th anniversary of Notre Dame's Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies. But for Scott Appleby, the Regan Director of the institute, a world map with pushpins -400 of them -would better symbolize its progress. 
Four hundred graduates of the institute's programs are imple­menting the tenets of peace­building and conflict resolution that they learned in Notre Dame's classrooms and in Kroc internships throughout the world. 
Their pervasive international influence is illustrated by two who received distinguished alumni awards: Oana-Cristina Popa, the Romanian Ambassador to Croatia and George Wachira, who started the Nairobi Peace Initiative. Both were honored during a banquet and international academic con­ference earlier this month. 
Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, peace increas­ingly has been on the minds of young people, and their interest is reflected in a doubling -to 150-of the number of under­graduates who have declared supplementary peace studies majors and minors. 
Appleby has directed the insti­tute for seven years. He is accus­tomed to being teased for loaf­ing, since world peace seems more elusive than ever. Arms proliferation and the effects of the Cold War were the primary concerns in 1986 when Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., then president of Notre Dame, conceived the institute and secured the first of several gifts from McDonald's restaurants heiress Joan B. Kroc. 
No sooner did the Cold War end than the world "exploded" into religious, ethnic and region­al wars, Appleby says. The rela­tively new field of conflict resolu­tion has had to adapt to ever­changing realities as it has worked to establish credibility. 
In this business, measures of success are complex. Appleby wryly points out, for example, that one cannot claim victory on the basis of people not killed in conflict. That is a bittersweet measure at best. On a more demonstrably positive side, the increasing influence Kroc faculty George Lopez and David Cortright wield among policy­makers is a noteworthy gain. 
"George and David went on record many times before the Iraq war to say there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq," Appleby said. "You gain credibility in policy circles by being right."

respected journalists in America today," said Robert Schmuhl, American Studies professor and founding mem­ber of the Gallivan Program. "I think it's always valuable to have recognized and respect­ed journalists talking to stu­dents who aspire to become journalists." 
Matthew Storin, professor in the Gallivan Program and former executive editor of The Boston Globe, said Abramson was interested in Notre Dame when given the opportunity to visit. He said she was very impressed by its academic reputation, and wanted to come out to a part of the country she does not usually get a chance to see. 
The Gallivan Program began 10 years ago when sev­eral Notre Dame alumni, including Anne Thompson, chief fmancial correspondent for NBC News. Tom Bettag, former executive producer or ABC's Nightline and Bill Dwyre, sports columnist for the Los Angeles Times, organ­ized an advisory committee. 
"Interest [in the Gallivan Program] remains high. The caliber of student remains very high," Schmuhl said. "We are continuing to pursue many of the activities we began 10 years ago, including bringing respected journalists to campus." 
Storin said the program has several distinguishing ele­ments. 
"It is founded on the belief that undergraduates should not major in journalism, they should major in more tradi­tional subjects," he said. "!Journalism! should be a supplement to that learning that gives students a taste of 
Storin said the program is valuable because it provides students with opportunities to obtain internships for future employment. 
"We are starting intern pro­grams at the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Concord, New Hampshire Monitor that are of no cost to the papers where we will subsidize the salaries of the students .... We try to provide as many intern opportunities as we can," Storin said. 
Storin also said the program ran an extra -but essential -mile by addressing journal­ism ethics. 
"We feel that we are bring­ing into the media students with a highly developed sense of ethics and public service, and our program distinguish­es itself with that element," he said. 
Two more prominent jour­nalists are also planning on visiting Notre Dame in the future. Sarah Childress, a Newsweek correspondent in Baghdad and former editor of Notre Dame's Scholastic, as well as former NBC chief White House correspondent and current PBS journalist Judy Woodruff are planning to come to campus next semester. 
Storin said Abramson's visit about because of a suggestion by a past visitor, David Shribman, executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 
"He suggested Jill, and I thought that was a fabulous idea, for lots of' reasons," he said. "She holds one of the most powerful and important jobs in the profession. [ ... ] She brings the additional benefit of being a great role model for our female journalists."

Bush dismisses Iraq civil war claims 
RIGA, Latvia -Under intense pressure to change course, President Bush on Tuesday rejected suggestions Iraq has fall­en into civil war and vowed not to pull U.S. troops out "until the mission is complete." 
At the opening of a NATO summit, Bush also urged allies to increase their forces in Afghanistan to confront a strengthening Taliban insurgency. 
On the eve of his visit to Jordan for meet­ings with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al­Maliki, Bush portrayed the battles in both Afghanistan and Iraq as central fronts in a war "against the extremists who desire safe havens and are willing to kill inno­cents anywhere to achieve their objec­tives." 
Militant kills self at border crossing 
JDEIDET YABOUS, Syria -The Syrian leader of an Islamic militant group blew himself up Tuesday after trying to cross into Lebanon and engaging in a gunbattle with Syrian border forces. Two border guards were wounded. 
The incident raises questions about the security of the Lebanese-Syrian frontier, which Israel contends is a gateway for weapons to rearm Hezbollah militants. 
It comes at a time of increased tension in Lebanon as the struggle intensifies between the anti-Syria government and factions led by Hezbollah, Syria's ally in Lebanon. 
The Syrian Interior Ministry said in a statement the clash began when Omar Abdullah, 28, the leader of the Islamic mil­itant group Tawhid and Jihad, was chal­lenged when he tried to cross into Lebanon with fake documents.

Bloomberg visits dead man's family 
NEW YORK -Mayor Michael Bloomberg met Tuesday with the family of the man who was killed on his wedding day in a barrage of police gunfire as he left his bachelor party, and investigators questioned a third civilian wit­ness. 
Three days after the fatal encounter, it remained unclear why four detectives and one police officer opened fire while conducting an undercover operation at a strip club. 
The unidentified witness was on a darkened block in Queens when five police officers killed 23-year-old Sean Bell and injured two friends as the three men sat inside a car, officials said. 
Charges filed in boot camp death 
PENSACOLA, Fla. -Seven former guards at a juvenile boot camp were charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child Tuesday in the videotaped pummeling of a 14-year-old boy who later died -a case that led to the dis­mantling of Florida's military-style detention system for young offenders. 
Also charged was a nurse who can be seen on the tape watching as guards repeatedly kneed and hit Martin Lee Anderson during a 30-minute scuffie on Jan. 5. Guards said the boy was uncooperative and had refused to participate in exercises. 
The teen collapsed in the exercise yard at the camp in Panama City and died at a hospi­tal the next day.

The District 1 Court of Appeals said the lawsuit by the men -Kenneth Hornback of Harrison County, Ind., and Dennis L. Bolton, Ronald W. Kuhl, David W. Schaeffer and Glenn M. Bonn, all of Louisville -is barred by the statute of limitations.

ple [not knowing] who they are" and "inconsistency in hall coun­cil, and not all of the dorms hav­ing serious hall council meetings regularly enough in order to have enough in order to get informa­tion out throughout the dorm," Andrichik said. 
Student Union Board (SUB) manager Pat Vassel agreed there is a need to generate more understanding and interest about student government. 
"We need to do a better job in letting them know what we're doing," Vassel said. ''I'd be willing to bet that 60 percent of people on campus don't know that ifyou want to plan a major concert you'll want to get involved with SUB." 
Vassel also said the "organiza­tion spotlights" introduced in COR meetings have shown that even student leaders are in need of more information about other government branches. 
Several suggestions· were put forth on how to spark student interest, including organizing participatory events, initiating town hall meetings, sending updates via email and advertising on-line vacancies in student gov­ernment positions. 
Student body president Lizzi Shappell suggested that further suggestions on generating stu­dent interest could be discussed next week. 
Bryan Lowery gave an overview of Hall Presidents Council (HPC) as the organization spotlight for the week, which he said is "one of the largest pro­gramming bodies on campus [and] largest groupings of student leaders on campus" with repre­sentatives from all 27 residence halls. 
HPC helps to fund and plan res­idence hall events, including sig­nature events such as the Dillon Pep Rally, Keenan Revue, McGlinn Casino Night and Keough Chariot Race, Lowery said. They are also involved in smaller dorm events, which often happen two to four times a week. 
Lowery said HPC has been involved in organizing pep rallies for that past 10 years, and this year the pep rallies were "maxi­mizing capacity of the Joyce Center all the way up to some­times 7,000" throughout the sea­son. 
"Attendance was surprisingly high, which made some of the negative feedback [HPC received about the pep rallies] somewhat out of place," he said. 
In addition to being involved in Notre Dame football through the pep rallies, Lowery said HPC also endorses other athletic programs by linking dorms to athletic func­tions, as coaches and players will come to HPC asking for dorm support for big games. 
In one example, Lowery showed the student attendance for women's soccer games going up about 110 percent after HPC encouraged dorm involvement. 
In addition to lobbying for ath­letic support throughout the dorms, HPC can also act as a "base unit" for other organization events, Lowery said.

selected questions about how gender affected their experi­ences with the election process and their leadership roles. 
"The focus of the program is on specifically the only three female student body presidents at the University, so it's kind of a unique opportunity to talk about that public display of female leadership," Shappell said. 
After the speakers give their presentation, GRC peer educators, called FIRE Starters, will divide the audi­ence into small groups for discussion. Then the entire group will come back togeth­er for a general question and answer session, Rakoczy said. 
Initially, Rakoczy said, she felt that "undergraduate women who are interested in student government and interested in following in the footsteps of Brooke, Libby and Lizzi" would be interest­ed in the event because they could "get some ideas of how they can contribute to that legacy." 
However, as planning has progressed, Rakoczy said she now hopes that student lead­ers from various disciplines will also attend the event. She expects the three women's "kernels of wis­dom" to inspire a diverse group of male and female leaders in fields such as ath­letics, band and art. 
"Campus culture will start to change when women and men collaborate together as leaders," Rakoczy said. 
The program is also intended to reach "those interested in the historic nature of having the three female presidents together in one room," Shappell said. 
Rakoczy pointed out that Notre Dame's female stu­dent body bring "gender and sexuality to the forefront." 

ShappBll said she "definite­ly was conscious of the fact" that there had only been two female presidents before her, but it was not why she decid­ed to run for the office.

Comedian Tracy Morgan charged -with drunk driving 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Tracy Morgan, a former "Saturday Night Live" regular who co­stars on NBC's "30 Rock," was arrested Tuesday in Upper Manhattan on drunk­en driving charges, the dis­trict attorney's office said. 
The 38-year-old comedian was stopped around 4:30 
a.m. while driving a Cadillac Escalade on the Henry Hudson Parkway near West 158th Street, said Edison Alban, a

Police  said  Morgan  

smelled of alcohol and later failed a breathalyzer test at a police station, Alban said. 
When he was arrested, Morgan told police he had been to a club and "had some beers," Assistant District Attorney Robert Kennedy said in court. 
Morgan's publicist in Los Angeles didn't immediately return a call seeking com­ment. 
Morgan was arraigned on charges of driving while intoxicated and driving while impaked. Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Matthew F. Cooper released Morgan without requiring him to post bail, but ordered him to turn over his driver's license. 
The prosecutor told the judge that he recommended a $1,000 fine, five days of community service and a DWI program. Morgan's lawyer, Sheryl Reich, told the judge they had no inter­est in the plea offer at this time. He pleaded no contest to a

IN BRIEF 
Bush suggests cooperation on trade 
WASHINGTON -President Bush's top trade negotiator said Tuesday the president still hopes to achieve bipartisan support for an aggressive trade liberalization agenda in the next Congress even with Democrats in control. 
U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said the administration would continue to push for the conclusion of global trade talks known as the Doha Round before negotiating authority expires on June 30. 
She said the administration also hopes to wrap up negotiations by early next year on free trade deals with South Korea and Malaysia and said that talks should be concluded soon with Panama. 
She called gaining congressional approval for agreements already completed with Peru and Colombia a high priority. 
In a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Schwab warned against any move to erect pro­tectionist barriers against the flow of goods into the country, something that critics say are needed in the face of record-high trade deficits they con­tend are costing American jobs. 
Restraining order in newspaper sale 
SAN FRANCISCO -A previously undisclosed internal memo prompted a federal judge Tuesday to temporarily block the consolidation of some of the San Francisco Chronicle's business operations with those of rival newspapers owned by MediaNews Group Inc. 
Denver-based MediaNews, which already owned the Oakland Tribune and seven other Bay Area newspapers, acqujred the Monterey County Herald, San Jose Mercury News and Contra Costa Times from McClatchy Co. earlier this year. The complex $1 billion deal included $300 mil­lion in fmancing from Hearst Corp., owner of the Chronicle. 
In July, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston let the deal go through, ruling against an antitrust law­suit that claimed the deal would create a monop­oly on readership and advertising in the region. 
But in issuing Tuesday's restraining order, she said a memo had recently surfaced showing Hearst had an undisclosed motive for investing in the deal-to consolidate its Bay Area advertising and distribution operations with those of the Chronicle's competitors -a possible antitrust violation.

Durables fall, stocks march on 
Housing shows gains; investors shrug off inflation, housing market warnings 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Stocks 
advanced modestly 
Tuesday after Wall Street 
shrugged off a sharp drop 
in orders for manufac­
tured goods and took com­
fort in the first gain in 
existing home sales in 
eight months. 

The rise in stocks came 
after investors showed lit­
tle· reaction to comments 
from Federal Reserve 
Chairman Ben Bernanke 
that he remains concerned 
that inflation or a steeper­
than-expected decline in 
the housing market could 
harm an already slowing 
economy. In the speech, 
which included Bernanke's 
most extensive comments 
on the economy since this 
summer, he said inflation 
remains higher than he 
would like but that it 
should fall as the economy 
cools. 

The Commerce 
Department's report that 
orders for durable goods 
fell 8.3 percent in October 
-the largest drop in more 
than six years -stoked 
concerns that the economy 
is slowing at too fast a 
pace. But a report from

Ohio tnother suspected of tnicrowaving her infant to death 
Associated Press 
DAYTON, Ohio -A mother was arrested on suspicion of murdering her newborn daugh­ter by microwaving the baby in an oven. 
China Arnold, 26, was jailed Monday on a charge of aggravat­ed murder, more than a year after she brought her dead month-old baby to a hospital. Bail was set Tuesday at $1 million. 
"We have reason to believe, and we have some forensic evi­dence that is consistent with our belief, that a microwave oven was used in this death," said Ken Betz, director of the Montgomery County coroner's office. 
He said the evidence included high-heat internal injuries and the absence of external burn marks on the baby, Paris Talley. 
Arnold was arrested soon after the baby's death in August 2005, then was released while authori­ties investigated further. Betz said the case was difficult because "there is not a lot of scientific research and data on the effect of microwaves on human beings." 
The death was ruled homicide by hyperthermia, or high body temperature. The absence of external burns ruled out an open flame, scalding water or a heat­ing pad as the cause, Betz said. 
Arnold's lawyer, Jon Paul Rion, said his client had nothlng to do with her child's death and was "China -as a mother and a taken to the hospital, Arnold and didn't sense anything out of the stunned when investigators told person -was horrified that such the child's father went out for a ordinary until the next morning, her that a mierowave might have an aet could occur," Hion said. short time and left Paris with a when the child was found uncon­been involved.

Judge rules against Bush executive order 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -A federal judge struck down President Bush's authority to designate groups as terrorists, saying his post-Sept. 11 executive order was unconstitutionally vague, according to a ruling released Tuesday. 

The Humanitarian Law Project had challenged Bush's order, which blocked all the assets of groups or individuals he named as "specially designated global terrorists" after the 2001 terror­ist attacks. 
"This law gave the president unfettered authority to create blacklists," said David Cole, a lawyer for the Washington, D.C.­based Center for Constitutional Rights that represented the group. "It was reminiscent of the McCarthy era." 

The case centered on two groups, the Liberation Tigers, which seeks a separate home­land for the Tamil people in Sri Lanka, and Partiya Karkeran Kurdistan, a political organiza­tion representing the interests of Kurds in Turkey. 
U.S. District Judge Audrey Collins enjoined the government from blocking the assets of the two groups. 
Both groups consider the Nov. 21 ruling a victory; both had been designated by the United States as foreign terrorist organ­izations. 
Cole said the judge's ruling does not invalidate the hundreds of other designated terrorist groups on the list but "calls them into question." 

Charles Miller, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice, said, "We are currently reviewing the decision and we have made no determination what the government's next step will be." 
A White House spokeswoman declined to immediately com­ment. At the time of his order creating the list, Bush declared that the "grave acts of terror­ism" and the "continuing and immediate threat of future attacks" constituted a national emergency. 
The judge's 45-page ruling was a reversal of her own tentative findings last July in which she indicated she would uphold wide powers asserted by Bush under an anti-terror financing law. She delayed her ruling then to allow more legal briefs to be flied. 
She also struck down the pro­vision in which Bush had author­ized the secretary of the treasury to designate anyone who "assists, sponsors or provides services to" or is "otherwise associated with" a designated group. 
However, she let stand sections of the order that penalize those who provide "services" to desig­nated terrorist groups. She said such services would include the humanitarian aid and rights training proposed by the plain­tiffs. 
The Humanitarian Law Project planned to appeal that part of the ruling, Cole said. 
"We are pleased the court rejected many of the constitu­tional arguments raised by the plaintiffs, including their chal­lenge to the government's ban on providing services to terrorist organizations," Miller said Tuesday. "However, we believe the court erred in finding that certain other aspects of the exec­utive order were unconstitution­al." 
Mayor's brother indicted 
Philadelphia's John Street denies knowledge ofillegalfinancial dealings 
Associated Press 

PHILADELPHIA -The older brother of Mayor John 
F. Street was indicted Tuesday, accused of using his last name to convince companies he could get them lucrative city con­tracts and failing to pay taxes on $2 million of income. 
Soon after Street took office in 2000, T. Milton Street Sr. began hiring him­self out as a high-priced consultant to companies that thought he could help them get city contracts, the indictment charged. One firm paid Milton Street, who is a longtime hot dog ven­dor, a $30,000-a-month con­sulting fee and required him to do no work, authorities said. 
He and two other busi­nessmen face charges of mail and wire fraud, filing 
false tax returns and related counts. 
"Milton Street wanted the IRS to believe he was a humble street vendor selling hot dogs and soda," U.S. Attorney Patrick Meehan said. "What he did­

"I think, honestly, that I stayed in bounds [of the law]" Milton Street said as he arrived at a home in Moorestown, N.J., on Tuesday. "Now, I have to tell you, I am the worst record-
keeper in the history of the modern man." 
The mayor, who was not charged, said he did not know details of his brother's financial deal­ings but defended his right to pursue city contracts.

mayor's office. The mayor was never charged. 
Federal prosecutors say Milton Street was awarded consulting contracts with companies doing business at two city-owned airports even though he had no experience in facilities maintenance work. His con­sulting firms contained the name Notlim, which is Milton spelled backward. 
One company, General Asphalt Paving, paid him $8,000 a month -and later $12,500 a month -to get city business, including a contract for maintenance at Philadelphia International Airport and Northeast Philadelphia Airport, prose­cutors said. 
Milton Street also was accused of defrauding a prospective airport contrac­tor, who gave him $80,000 on a promise from Milton Street that he could get them a $3.2 million contract that didn't exist, prosecu­tors said.

A few weeks ago, Wai-Mart informed the media that it would resume its use of the phrase 'Merry Christmas' in its Christmas-related advertising. 
Oh. how I wish there was nothing remarkable about this. But it's quite a breakthrough in a world where cor­porations become contortionists in their attempts at political correct­ness. 
Why this sudden reversal? Last year, Wal-Mart's refusal to wish anyone a Merry Christmas, opting instead for the secular Happy Holidays, resulted in that most clearly heard of outcries. Sales went down. 
Ah, capitalism. Gotta love it. 
I'm just a simple columnist, one who, when driven into the outside world to buy shampoo or paper towels, regularly finds herself lost in the maze of the modern consumer world. But even I could have told Wal-Mart that boy­cotting the word Christmas would reduce its Christmas sales. 
Why, then, did they do it? Here are a few possibilities. 
Possibility No. 1: It was a ploy to make money. After years of marketing its Christmas merchandise as Christmas this or that, Wal-Mart noticed that Jewish and Muslim families never bought any of it. Therefore, it launched an ill-fated attempt to trick these people into aceidentally buying Fiber-Optic Christmas Trees by advertising them as Fiber-Optic I Ioliday Firs. Or something. 
Possibility No. 2: It was a ploy to save

It sounded better in my head 
money on advertisements. Merry Christmas has 14 letters, Happy Holidays has 13. The more bias<~ among us may find this trivial, but on a large seale -tho Wal-Mart seale -that's a lot of toner. 
Possibility No. 3: Jlappy llolidays is an alliterative phrase. And assuredly, allit­erative advertisements always attract Americans. Agree? 
Possibility No. 4: It was a ploy to get the maybe 14 people in the country who are actually offended by the word "Christmas" to shop at Wal-Mart and boycott other stores that do use the word "Christmas." This is probably the most compelling possibility, which com­pared to tlw others isn't saying mueh. 
There are people in the eountry who, for various cultural or religious reasons, do not celebrate Christmas. There are also people, like some Jehovah's Witnesses, who legitimately believe that the celebration of Christmas is morally wrong. Now, this kind of diversity has been celebrated throughout American history. We all know that the reason the Pilgrims got on the Mayflower was that they didn't want to belong to the Church of England, and one reason they didn't like it was that it made much of Christmas as a celebration, while they thought it should be somber day of prayer and fasting. 
Christmas protesters, then, are a part of American history. Good for them. They can and do address the issue how­ever they choose. Sometimes they just boycott Christmas amongst themselves. Sometimes they go around trying to convince other people to do the same. 
One thing I am certain they never do is go to the store and buy tinsel and light-up snowmon and nativity sets beeause they're labeled "I loliday" and not "Christmas." 
And they certainly don't deny that Christmas exists. I mean, if they really believe Christmas is the calamity they say it is, they have to recognize the problem, right? Recognize that there is a celebration called Christmas in which some 96 percent of the country partici­pates. I assure you, the Jehovah's Witnesses know that. 
Besides calling it the Holidays doesn't solve the problem. As for striking reli­gious references in all public plaees, well, every thinking person knows that on those grounds Wal-Mart neednd to change it to something other than Holidays. Holi-day equals Holy day, Holy equals Heligion, you can figure out the rest. They should have chosen some­thing else -perhaps the Secular Season of Mutual Gifting. 
But it's too late for that. For whatever reason, Wal-Mart thought that boy­cotting the word Christmas would attract lots of Christmas shoppers. 
What really happened is that lots and lots of mothers read about how progres­sive Wal-Mart was in the newspaper and then bought Dora's Talking Kitchen and the Sesame Street Wriggle and Jiggle Tool Bench elsewhere, because they disliked Wal-Mart's treating the word Christmas the way it treats racial slurs and obscenities. 
Or else because they'd heard Wal­Mart wasn't having Christmas sales last year.

Bringing evolution and religion together 
Union leads to better understanding 
John Kennedy explained in a Letter to the Editor ("Keep reli­gion and science separate," Nov. 
28) that religion and science are two understandings that need to be kept separate, but a Catholic university seems to be an odd place to promote the separations of science and religion. Rather than encouraging the separation of science and religion, I suggest bringing the two closer together, and the resulting interaction between science and religion will relieve some of the tension rather than worsen it. 
Science is a process very differ­ent than religion. Science is a study of evidence drawn from the world in an effort to gain under­standing. The issue with science, however, is it neglects some of the important aspects of humani­ty. A common way to understand the difference between science and religion is science explains the "how" of the universe (for example, how did the universe form, how did humans come about), but all those questions neglect the reasoning, the "why". That is what religion explains. 
Science and religion are innately different ways of under­standing, not to say they should be kept separate, but combining the two provides a deeper under­standing of the same issue. For s\: example, evolution is the scien­tific theory that explains how humans have come about through a random process, but it neglects aspects of humanity, morality and purpose among oth­ers, that can be answered through religion. If you look toward science with those ques­tions, you will never find an answer, but if religion is a part of the analysis those questions can be answered. 
In regards to the issue of reli­gion inhibiting or opposing sci­ence, the cause rather than the solution is the separation between religion and science. People deny evolution not because Christianity dictates such a belief (in fact, the Pope John Paul II wrote a letter sup­porting evolution); rather, they have been brought up in an envi­ronment in which their religion and science were kept separate and if that separation continues those individuals will never gain understanding of evolutionary science that they claim to deny. Also, those individuals are replacing science with religious texts, thus seeking scientific answers where they will never be found while simultaneously disregarding the more important message of their religion. 

The conflict that results from contact between religion and sci­ence is a problem and when peo­ple look to the Bible for scientific information. They will be disap­pointed just as will those people who look to science for morals. The purpose of the Bible was not to show scientific truths, such as the formation of the Earth (even St. Augustine claimed that the exact meaning of Genesis 1 and 2 could not be known). but some do take the Bible as an explana­tion of such things and this results in a clash. If, however, religion is understood to function as a guide to those truths that science cannot address, then there should be no conflict. Bringing such a religion into con­tact with science does not inspire discrepancies. Rather, the combi­nation leads to understanding not only of the world in which we exist, but also of ourselves. 
Kirk Post freshman Fisher Hall Nov. 28 
Different focus for each 
Religion and science are one in a Nov. 28 Letter to the Editor "Keep religion and sci­ence separate." John Kennedy makes sever­al misleading claims about the relationship between science and religion. 
The fact of the matter is that science and religion are not at odds in some great cosmic battle for humanity's attention. Evolution is quite obviously the biggest problem with the idea that religion and science are not in con­flict. However, they are only in conflict if the Old Testament is interpreted literally word for word. I reference the Old Testament rather than strictly the Bible because the Old Testament is relevant to more religions than just Christianity, such as Judaism. 
The Old Testament was written for a peo­ple with no real science. In order to draw a true understanding from it today we must not restrict ourselves to a verbatim interpre­tation. In this manner we can come to recon­cile the idea of evolution with religion by recognizing that science and religion are addressing different areas of creation. Science is more interested in how we were created and seeks to use evolution as the answer to this. 
Religion is not interested in how the uni­verse was created, rather the fact that it was in fact created. Genesis is simply delivering this message of our creation by God, rather specifically, how we were created. Religion is the moral guidepost of science; this is why it is important for the two never to be separat­ed. 
Scientific research, such as embryonic stem-cell research, has appeal. This appeal comes from the fact that such research can lead to saving lives. However, we could save everyone in need of a transplant by going out and killing all the "undesirable" people and using their organs. Even though they don't believe in God, any atheist will agree with church teachings and tell you that this is wrong. This is because the idea that killing is wrong is an objective truth. While it is possible to come to know objective truths such as these without religion it is very diffi­cult to do so with absolutely no religious influence. 
Furthermore if the two ideas were in fact in such conflict as suggested then how could the Catholic Church make its peace with Evolution as it did quite a while ago? In fact Pope John Paul II said in Fides Et Ratio, on page 8 that, "Faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth." The fact that a frightening number of people deny evolution does not affect the way religion treats it as a whole which is that they are not conflicting. Rather such denial implies the need for a greater education of the relationship between science and religion especially under the context of evolution. 
James Breen freshman Zahm Hall Nov.28 
Stating the obvious? 
I must say that I am sorely disappointed by Daniel Amiri asserting that "human beings are not animals" in his recent Letter to the Editor titled "Encourage chastity, not 'free talk'" (Nov. 21). I feel that I might understand why he said it, but all that state­ment really says to me is "severe disconnect from reality." I feel silly for having to write the following statement, but human beings are of course animals.

Band, crowd important parts of football experience 
Band often overlooked 

As a life long Notre Dame football and Notre Dame band fan I am shocked that coach Charlie Weis had to ask that some of the band attend the USC game. I am disappointed that this was not a trip planned for the entire band before the season started. After the USC game last year this is all that most fans have been waiting for. With all the talk of spirit from the students and the band why was this trip not planned? If the band wants to be thought of as so important to school spirit then I think the band should understand their responsibility. The football program generates so much money that this shouldn't be an issue. It is even more surprising that the band has not been to USC in more than four years. Evidently this means that the seniors never have had a trip to USC. I also do not understand that in the "huge" LA Coliseum there is no room for the entire band. This can only be the result of poor planning on the Notre Dame side. Please do better in the future.

Stadium atmosphere needs makeover 
On Saturday night the Coliseum was rockin', and the atmosphere was hostile. When the Trojans charged out of the tunnel there was a clear sense of intimidation as the team exuded an attitude and swagger that carried over into the stands. My experi­ence at the Coliseum was a real eye-opener. Despite my loyal attempt to deny it, I came to the realization that Notre Dame Stadium is lacking that "something" and that those who have been critical of the quiet environ­ment are, in fact, correct. 
I am sick and tired of the reputation that Notre Dame is friendly and welcoming to opposing teams. Friendliness does not win football games. We must create a "nasty" environment that strikes fear into our oppo­nents just as the Trojans did on Saturday night. As much as I hate Southern Cal, I would love to be able to match the noise, the energy and the intimidation that was present at the Coliseum. Maybe the answer is coming to terms with the fact that it is 2006 -not the 1920s of Rockne and Gipp. 
Maybe it has nothing to do with that. But something must change to regain our home field advantage.

Weis' support of band acknowledged, appreciated 
Let me relate my first (and only) direct encounter with Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis. It was February 2005 and a number of pep band members had been asked to come early to play for the recruits on Junior Day. Always eager to help out, a number of us gladly went to play as the junior recruits walked the concourse from the football office to the Monogram room in the Joyce Center. Seeing the smiles on all the recruits faces was a real pleasure. 
Then, Weis walked by. Unlike previous coaches he didn't walk past us: he stopped and waited for us to finish play­ing. A little bit confused and maybe just a little giddy, the few of us gathered round in a circle around the man and he spoke: 
"I don't know how you've been treated in the past. What I know is that you're a part of us now and we're in this togeth­er." A cheer erupted from us. We'd never heard anything like that before! I was a bit jealous at the moment and secretly wished I could do a sixth year of band because I knew we had a special man as the football coach. 
As these last two seasons have passed, stories about the man emerged that could warm any graduate's heart: "Pass Right," Montana Mazurkiewicz, time made for kids and veterans, and even emergency 4 a.m. golf cart rides from the 'Backer for alumni. 
As a former member and leader of the band, the stories my friends in band would tell were even better. Like the time the team get off the bus to sing the fight song with the band or how the team really embraces them. Now, Weis has one-upped even that by requesting the band go to USC: a true treat to reward the hard work and dedication of many seniors. Beyond that, it shows a true appreciation for a group of hard work­ing, intelligent, spirited people and the embracing of a community the way only a graduate of this University could per­form and understand. 
So, thank you, Charlie Weis. Thank you for your embrace, for lighting up this campus and student body, and for chang­ing us. Forget the record. Forget the BCS. Remember the way a true son of Notre Dame has brought us all together.

a second time. With the 66-vear-old back behind the camera, "Casino Hoyale" is a refreshing look at a character that's been a part of the cinematic lexicon for over four decades. Campbell and his screenwriters made the wisest of decisions at the scriptwrit­ing stage -they chose to reboot the fran­chise and reveal how "James became Bond," the bold, fitting tagline for "Royale." 
"Royale" is still a Bond film and is not light on action. In true 007 fashion, the filmmak­ers enthrall the senses with a frenetic chase through a Madagascar construction site ­easily among the most pulsating sequences in the franchise's storied history. 
With this film, Campbell has proven himself in the same league as Michael Bay in his abil­ity to orchestrate a visceral thrill ride. But while Bay is myopic in composing his set pieces, Campbell fills out the rest of "Royale" with a rare dosn of heart. 
The film's most affecting scene is also the quietest one. Fully clothed and tenderly embracing a shaking Eva Green, Craig sits with her in a shower as water washes over them both. Just minutes prior, he had brutal­ly killed two Ugandan warlords, and here is Bond as we rarely see him -with warmth. 
The initial exchange in "Hoyale" between Dench and Craig i<> a subtle one. But this one moment serves notice that the 007 mantle is safe once more. It will be resting on Craig's stocky shoulders for as long as he wants to dutch Bond's Walther PPK. 
"Royale" is a triumphant return for Bond. Against all odds, Craig has proven he deserves a place near Connery-in the heart of the stylized gun barrel sequence that intro­duces each 007 adventure.

FROM CONNERY TO CRAIG 
By MARTY SCHROEDER Assistant Scene Editor 
No figure has been more intriguing or more controversial, depending on how you look at it, than the British secret agent, James Bond. 
The ubiquitous "Bond -James Bond" has become legendary, as has the shaken not stirred vodka martini. Based on the novels by Ian Fleming, this Cold War warrior has been on the big screen since 1962's "Dr. No." The job of portraying this suave assassin has been a prized job that many an actor has sought. Spanning the time­less Sean Connery to the latest incar­nation with Daniel Craig, the men who have played Bond have brought their own style and flair in adding and com­pounding on the Bond legend. 
Sean Connery was the first Bond and is considered by many to be the best. He told women what he wanted in a less politically correct age, and more often then not -they gave it to him. Either macho or misogynist, Connery's Bond always saved the day from the

In 1995's "GoldenEye," Deneb's M-the demanding taskmaster atop England's covert MI6 ageney-drubs Pierce Brosnan's Bond for being a "sexi<>t. misogynist dinosaur ... a relic of the Cold War." Brosnan handled the insults and the role deftly, but always with the slightest tinge of deference -almost as if his Bond was accepting his role as M's glori­fied lackny rather than her menacing equal. 
"Casino Hoyale" is a different story. Deneb wastes little time before launching into another tirade against newly-minted 007 Daniel Craig. Calling him a blunt instrument, a thug and egotistical in the same breath, she questions Bond's promotion to 007 status.

Craig and director Martin Campbell have stripped Bond down to his essence in "Royale." The lilm relies on character, not gadgets -a welcome divergence from Brosnan's more vacuous misadventures.

He is currently working on the flhn adaptation of Philip Pullman's novel "His Dark Materials: The Golden Compass" in the role of Lord Asriel. The film's director is Chris Weitz ("American Pie") and Tom Stoppard wrote the screen­play. It co-stars Nicole Kidman, as well as Craig's Bond girl, Eva Green. 
Outside of the spotlight, Craig maintains a quiet lifestyle. He's known for his reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the ostenta­tious glitz and glamour of red car­pets and pre­miere parties. See Also

At Guildhall he studied l.Cting alongside other future note­
worthy actors Ewan McGregor and Joseph Fiennes. 
Although some disagree with the casting of the "Blond Bond," it is hard to deny Craig's acting talent, especially when looking at his fil­mography. One year after graduat­ing from Guildhall, Craig made his film debut in "The Power of One" (1992), alongside Morgan Freeman. 
The next several years included small stints on several television shows, such as "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles" and "Tales from the Crypt," as well as a small part in the '90s classic "A Kid in King Arthur's Court" (which also features a young Kate Winslet). 
It wasn't until his role in "Lara Croft: ·Tomb Raider" (2001) as Croft's (Angelina Jolie) rival and love interest that Craig would receive international recognition. His role a year later in Sam Mendes' "Road to Perdition" alongside Tom Hanks and Paul Newman continued to bolster his rising success. 
His first starring role came in 2004 in the hugely successful British gangster film "Layer Cake," and his performance gar­nered him several European awards and accolades. Craig then went on to co-star with Eric Bana in Steven Spielberg's acclaimed "Munich" (2005).

Bond -who delivered the trademark one-liners in a more stoic fashion. Moore's films ranged from the unbe­lievable-with 1974's "The Man With the Golden Gun," in which a golden gun kills automatically with one shot -to the ridiculously sublime, when 1979's "Moonraker" took James Bond to space. 
James Bond needed a return to earth, so to speak, after the campy Roger Moore and so Timothy Dalton was brought on as Bond. He was meant to bring more credibility to Bond but only made two films ­1987's "The Living Daylights" and 1989's "License to Kill." He was offi­cially considered James Bond until 1994 in spite of only making these two films. 
With the Dalton experiment ending in failure, Bond needed to be brought to the modern era. They found who many thought to be the best since Connery -an ldsh actor named Pierce Brosnan. 
Directed by Martin Campbell and released in 1995, the first and best Brosnan Bond film was released to 
critical and financial success ­"GoldenEye." In the spirit of Cold War Bond, the women were now powerful and wanted to bed him as much as he wanted to get them there. Brosnan was suave, but with the devolution of his villains he left after 2002's "Die Another Day," in which he starred opposite Halle Berry. 
The newest Bond is yet another Brit. The blond-haired, blue-eyed Daniel Craig stars in the recent release of "Casino Royale," which presents a reimagining of the franchise. 
It tells the story of how Bond became 007. Craig promises to bring a tough rather than suave attitude to Bond as opposed to his predecessors. Love and revenge seem to be some of the major themes of this most recent film and the critical reviews have been extremely positive. 
With new direction and stories, Bond seems to have found new life and a new persona -but he will always still be Bond ... James Bond.

By BRIAN DOXTADER Scene Ediror 

In a lot of ways, "Casino Royale" is the Bond franchise coming full circle. The film is based on Ian Fleming's first novel, which he wrote back in 1953. Over the next 11 years, Fleming wrote 12 novels and nine short stories featuring the suave protago­nist, most of which were adapted (some rather loosely) into film versions. 
Fleming created Bond in 1952, basing the character on his own experiences as a per­sonal assistant to John Godfrey, director of naval intelligence of the British Royal Navy. Many of the books' plots derive from vari­ous inspirations, many of them related to Fleming's military history. Though the movies, especially the Roger Moore outings, tended toward fantastic elements, most of the original novels were straight-ahead spy novels, with much less emphasis on gadgets and action. 
The most notable and well written of Fleming's books are the final three Bond novels published in the author's lifetime (not counting the "interlude" novel "The Spy Who Loved Me"), which were part of a trilo­gy involving arch-villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld and his criminal organization SPEC­TRE. 
The trilogy began with "Thunderball," which was mired in controversy because 
THE BETTER HALVES OF BOND 
By SEAN SWEANY Assistant Scene Editor 

Guns. Cars. Martinis. Girls. These are all traits that make the James Bond franchise what it has become today -one of the most widely known and successful film franchises of all time. One of the most noticeable and controversial of these over the years has been the girls -better known as Bond Girls -who have graced the screen along with the various 007s. 
Starting with "Dr. No" in 1962, one or more beautiful women has always starred opposite the British secret agent, taking on roles from fellow agents and allies to villainesses to girlfriends and lovers. 
Eunice Gayson and Ursula Andress played Sylvia Trench and Honey Ryder, respectively, in "Dr. No," beginning the trend of attractive women accompanying Bond on his various missions. Gayson is the only actress to play the same charac­ter in two different films, reprising her role as Trench in 1963's "From Russia the novel was based on the screen treat­ment, written by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and Fleming himself. The rights over "Thunderball" led to a legal bat­tle that was not resolved before Fleming's death and eventually led to the 1983 "Thunderball" remake "Never Say Never Again." Although it starred Connery, it is not considered officially part of the Bond canon. 
After "The Spy Who Loved Me," the Blofeld trilogy once again picked up with "On Her Majesty's Secret Service." As with the film (the only Bond picture that starred George Lazenby), the novel featured the short-lived marriage of James and Tracy. The trilogy then finished with "You Only Live Twice," which was the last novel pub­lished in Fleming's lifetime. 
After the posthumous publication of "The Man With the Golden Gun," which was unfinished, the Bond series really picked up again in 1981 with the publication of the John Gardner-penned "License Renewed." Gardner updated the Bond world to the modern times, writing 14 original novels and two adaptations between 1981 and 1996. 
None of the Bond films are based on Gardner's novels, and many others are based on Fleming's works in name only. 1995's "GoldenEye" was the first Bond film that wasn't based on one of Fleming's sto­ries, though it has something of a connec­tion -the title derives from Fleming's 
with Love." 

Swedish actress Maud Adams is famous for playing two different Bond girls ­Andrea Anders in 1974's "The Man with the Golden Gun" and the title character in 1983's "Octopussy." For Adams, and many other Bond girls like Jane Seymour and Kim Basinger, the exposure gained in the James Bond films helped kick-start other­wise obscure careers. 
More recently, Bond girls have been cast to highlight the careers of already well­established actresses. This was the case for Halle Berry ("Monster's Ball") in "Die Another Day" and Denise Richards ("Wild Things") in "The World is Not Enough." While perhaps an anomaly since these two Bond movies are regarded as two of the worse films in the franchise, this trend has continued with Eva Green's role as Vesper Lynd in this year's "Casino Royale." 
The largest criticism of Bond Girls throughout the history of the 007 films is that the characters stereotype and objecti­fy women in light of James Bond's some­times chauvinistic actions. There is no doubt that the motif of a Bond girl includes good looks and little clothing. This has stayed constant from "Dr. No" to "Casino Royale." 
Some of the first James Bond films seem to openly embrace this motif, as some­times four or five of these female charac­ter types would appear in one film. However, as time went on, women in the James Bond films began to take on more central and developed roles than in the initial films. 
In "Moonraker," the character of Holly Goodhead is portrayed as a female space shuttle commander, something that had not yet happened in the real world in 1979. Around this time, a trend started in which the female roles would include a Bond Girl helping or saving Bond, or else serving as a formidable foe. 
While this was sometimes still regarded as pandering to the masses and inade­quate, there is no doubt that the attitude towards women in the James Bond films has made tremendous progress from the 1960s era of Sean Connery to the present day films. 
In "Casino Royale," Green ("Kingdom of Heaven") plays perhaps the most compli­cated, human Bond Girl yet. Rather than serving as little more than eye-candy, she plays a pivotal role in the film and becomes one of the few women in the his­tory of the Bond franchise to crack James Bond's seemingly impenetrable veneer. 
With this new take on a Bond Girl cemented in the latest reworking of the popular franchise, one can expect that characters like Vesper Lynd are here to stay. The tradition of attractive female leads cast alongside Bond will not change anytime soon. 
Just like the martinis, this part of the James Bond formula must remain for a Bond film to be a Bond film. Like the guns and cars, however, the women of Bond films -the most critical component next to James Bond himself-will continue to change with the times.

NEW YORK -The New York Yankees won the bid­ding for Japanese pitcher Kei lgawa when the Hanshin Tigers accepted their offer of just more than $26 million on Tuesday. 
lgawa, a 27 -year-old left­bander, could compete for a spot in New York's rota­tion next season behind Chien-Ming Wang, Mike Mussina and Randy Johnson. Carl Pavano, coming off 1 1/2 seasons of injuries, also would be in the rotation if healthy. 
New York has until mid­night at the end of Dec. 28 to work out a contract with the pitcher's agent, Arn Tellem -also the agent for Yankees left fielder Hideki Matsui. 
"We have been following Kei lgawa's very successful and accomplished career in Japan, and we are excited about the opportunity to begin the negotiating process with him," Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said in a state­ment. 
The Yankees pay Hanshin only if they reach an agree­ment with lgawa. 
"I am very pleased to have the right to sign him for the Yankees," owner George Steinbrenner said in a statement issued by spokesman Howard Rubenstein. 
The Boston Red Sox bid $51.1 million earlier this month to win the right to negotiate with Seibu Lions pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka, the MVP of the World Baseball Classic. The Red Sox have until mid­night on Dec. 14 to agree to a deal with Matsuzaka and his agent, Scott Boras. 
The Yankees bid between $32 million and $33 million for Matsuzaka. 
After the bidding on lgawa closed Monday, the Tigers were informed of the amount of the high bid. but not which team made 

-
it. The New York Mets bid between $15 million and $16 million for lgawa, a baseball official said on condition of anonymity because the amounts of losing bids are not dis­closed. 
lgawa went 14-9 last sea­son with a 2.97 ERA in Japan. He struck out 194 to tie for the Central League lead, adding to the strike­out titles he won in 2002 and 2004. 
lgawa, the Central League's 2003 MVP, has an 86-60 record with a 3.15 ERA. He would have to play in Japan for three more seasons before he could become a free agent. 
IN BRIEF 

Cardinals sign Kennedy, Bennett in first offseason acquisitions 
ST. LOUIS -The Cardinals made their first big moves since winning the World Series, agreeing Tuesday to a $10 million, three-year contract with second baseman Adam Kennedy and a $4 million, one-year deal with right­hander Kip Wells. 
The Cardinals also agreed to a $900,000, one-year contract with backup catcher Gary Bennett with a mutual option for 2008 and a minor league contract with Eli Marrero, once their starting catcher. 
Kennedy, selected by the Cardinals in the first round of the 1997 amateur draft, was considered the Cardinals' second baseman of the future before he was traded to the Anaheim Angels in 2000, a deal that brought Jim Edmonds to St. Louis. Kennedy now replaces Ronnie Belliard, who was acquired from Cleveland last summer and became a free agent. 
"Different time, different player," Kennedy said of his return to St. Louis. 
Wolf signs with Dodgers after recovering from elbow injury 
LOS ANGELES -Left-bander Randy Wolf couldn't pass up the opportunity to come home. 
Wolf, who spent much of last sea­son recovering from elbow surgery, finalized an $8 million, one-year con­tract with the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday. 
"I don't know how many times I'll have that option," Wolf said. "I couldn't pass that up. I'm happy with the way things turned out. 
Wolf grew up in suburban West Hills and appeared in the Los Angeles City Section championship games at Dodger Stadium for El Camino Heal High in 1993-94. "''m very happy that Randy's decided to stay home and pitch for the Dodgers," general manager Ned Colletti said during a conference call. "We believe in him as a pitcher, knowing he's a quality left-bander. He went through a tough period for a couple years with his elbow." 
Zaun returns to Blue Jays as talks with Barajas fall through 
TORONTO -Newly signed Frank Thomas hopes the Toronto Blue Jays can add a top pitcher to their roster. For now, they're content to keep their catcher. 
Gregg Zaun stayed with the Blue Jays by agreeing to a $7.25 million, two-year contract Tuesday, a day after catcher Rod Barajas backed out of an apparent deal. 
General manager J.P. Ricciardi quickly resumed negotiations with Zaun after Barajas decided not to go through with the deal and switched agents. 
"Zaunie was our first choice all along," Ricciardi said at a news con­ference to introduce Thomas, the team's new designated hitter. "We just hit a snag there at one point. We called him last night and said, 'Zaunie, if you want to be a Blue Jay, we have to make it happen now.' He was great and we were able to work it out. We're really happy that he's back."

NBA 

O'Neal confident he can return to old form 
Wade's move to point guard revives team; Miami wins two 
Associated Press 

MIAMI -First, Shaq sat. To take a load off his surgi­cally repaired left knee, he settled into a chair outside the Miami Heat locker room Tuesday. 
Then he spoke barely above a whisper into a cluster of microphones inches from his face. For those straining to hear, the message was nonetheless clear: Shaquille O'Neal's latest injury should not be interpreted as a sign that he's in decline. 
-"They've been saying that the last 10 years," said O'Neal, speaking publicly for body was breaking down. He recovered, sat out only five more games and led the Heat to the NBA title for his fourth championship ring. 
Now that he's in the middle of another layoff, rumblings about slippage in his produc­tivity have resurfaced. He dismisses detractors. 
"I don't say anything to people that could never do the stuff that I can do," he said. 
Miami's sub-.500 record in O'Neal's absence suggests his value remains high. The Heat went 10-13 without him a year ago, and they're 4-6 without him this month. 
"My brothers are out there struggling right now, and I should be out there with them," he said. "It's very, very difficult to watch."

O'Neal has been sidelined since Nov. 12, when he tore knee cartilage against Houston, and he's expected to be out until at least Dec. 23. 
A year ago, when O'Neal sprained his ankle in Miami's home opener and missed 18 games, there was talk his

revealed the need for surgery. 
His layoff is projected to be four to six weeks following the operation, and O'Neal has yet to resume running. 
"It's like starting over," he said. "A couple of days before I got the second diagnosis, I made the comment that my leg was dead. Usually when you have a knee injury, your quads and everything just shut down. That's what was happening. Now I just have to rebuild all that back up." 
O'Neal has missed 185 games during his 15-year NBA career, but this is the first time he needed rehabili­tation therapy following an operation. 
"I hope his thought process is that he tries to almost rein­vent himself physically," coach Pat Riley said. "He has

No problem, O'Neal said. 

''I'll be in shape good enough to help the team out and help win games and fur­ther what we're trying to do," he said. 
Miami had lost four consec­utive home games, but Dwyane Wade's move to point guard last week revived the offense. Wade has totaled at least 30 points and 10 assists in three consecutive games, and the Shaq-less Heat have won two in a row. 
"We just have to develop a certain style right now and develop some consistency," O'Neal said. "We're getting better and moving the ball better, and Dwyane is playing phenomenal. Everyone else just has to do more and step up. We all have to step up.

NFL 
Owner demands better results from Falcons 
Atlanta's playoff hopes fade; fans turn on talented quarterback as Vick struggles to connect with receivers 

Associated Press 
ATLANTA -After watching the Atlanta Falcons lose their fourth straight game, owner Arthur Blank grabbed a front­row seat in the interview room to listen in on what Jim Mora and Michael Vick had to say. 
Blank also pored over a stat sheet, whispering some thoughts to his top lieutenant while trying to figure out how another season that began with such promise has totally unraveled heading into the final month. 
This owner demands immedi­ate results. If things don't turn around over the next five weeks, the Falcons are certainly headed for big changes -starting with several members of Mora's staff and maybe extending all the way to the head coach himself. 
"Ever since I've been here, we've had high expectations," Blank said. "We did not build this team to be .500. We thought this team was capable of making a playoff run. Anytime you fall short of that, it's disappointing." 
Technically, Atlanta (5-6) still has time to turns things around in the mediocre NFC, where 6-5 would be good enough for the wild card if the season ended today. 
But after going 0-for­November, the Falcons are below .500 for the first time in Mora's three-year tenure and giving off few signs of being a team that can pull out of its slide before it's too late. 
Three of the losses during past month were by double-figure margins -the only exception being an inexcusable 17-13 home loss to woeful Cleveland (3­8). The Falcons were blown out 30-14 at Detroit, one of only two games the Lions have won this season. Last Sunday, Atlanta was all but eliminated from the NFC West race by a 31-13 loss to the Saints, who essentially have a three-game lead on the Falcons when the tiebreaker is factored in. 
What makes this all the more troubling is just how familiar it seems. 
A year ago, coming off a giddy 
IBERIAN & LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES SPRING 2007 COURSE DESCRIPTIONS 
run to the NFC championship game in Mora's rookie season as a head coach, the Falcons start­ed 6-2 and were thinking Super Bowl. They wound up losing six of their last eight, extending the 40-year-old franchise's inglorious streak of never having back-to­hack winning seasons. 
Now, it's happening all over again. In one short month, the Falcons have gone from being 5­2 and angling for home-field advantage in the playoffs to showing all the telltale signs of a team in disarray. 
Early last week, Mora's father -the longtime NFL coach of the same name -criticized Vick's passing skills and agreed that he's a "coach killer." As the quar­terback headed toward the lock­er room after the loss to the Saints, he was heckled by some fans and responded with an obscene gesture. 
As the face of the franchise, everything starts with Vick. But the blame for this downfall extends beyond No.7. 
The offense is a mess, an incompatible juxtaposition of coordinator Greg Knapp's West Coast-style passing schemes and the zone-blocking tactics used by the guys up front, who answer to de facto line coach Alex Gibbs. 
Vick has never taken to Knapp's philosophy, which relies on short drops and quick reads that seem ill-suited for a 6-foot quarterback who has trouble seeing over his linemen and is more effective when he ad-libs. Vick is the 25th-rated quarter­back in the NFL and, most stun­ning, has never put up better numbers playing in Knapp's offense than he did in his one full season working with former coach Dan Reeves. 
Meanwhile, the shadowy Gibbs -who's technically a "consult­ant" -prefers smaller, quicker linemen who'll carry out his con­troversial blocking tactics in the running game but are leakier than a colander when it comes to pass blocking. Vick may be the best running quarterback in NFL history, but he's still managed to get sacked 29 times playing behind a no-name group that has

zero Pro Bowls on its collective resume. 
When Vick does get off a pass, tight end Alge Crumpler is about the only reliable receiver on the team. Former first-round picks Michael Jenkins and Roddy White have been major disap­pointments. Ashley Lelie hasn't had the impact everyone expect­ed when he came to the Falcons in a trade for T.J. Duckett. 
Last week, Vick's receivers dropped five passes, the most damaging of those coming early in the fourth quarter when a wide-open White let the ball slip from his hands at the New Orleans 10 after the defender fell down. That snuffed the life out of the Falcons, who were down 21­13 at the time but totally fell apart the rest of the way. 
Mora insists he's not planning any changes on his staff, but what else do you expect him to say about guys -several of them close friends -who are still on the payroll? Clearly, Knapp and receivers coach George Stewart are on shaky ground. And the Falcons would­n't be able to hire a competent replacement for Knapp as long as Gibbs is hanging around. 
If the Falcons do look for some­one else to run the offense, the first priority is getting a coach who can take advantage of Vick's wondrous talents. This team has too much invested in No. 7 to give up on him (sorry, all you Atlanta fans who want to give backup Matt Schaub a chance). 
A new coordinator would cer­tainly want to upgrade the pro­tectors up front and the guys who are paid to catch passes, not drop them. Also, there might be some philosophical changes, such as more deep passing routes to capitalize on Vick's enormous arm strength (perhaps the strongest in the league, though his accuracy is clearly lacking). 
Mora got a contract extension before the season, but that means little in the what-have­you-done-for-me-lately NFL. The Falcons touted their 45-year-old coach as one of the profession's rising stars after his first season, but Blank -who prowls the sidelines during games a la Jerry Jones and takes an active role in personnel decisions -shows all the signs of being an impatient boss. 
"I believe we have the right folks in the building," Blank said in a tepid show of support for his coach. "They have the talent and enthusiasm to get it done, but obviously we've got to execute better and be a little more con­sistent." 
In all fairness to Mora and his assistants, the Falcons have been plagued by injuries. Two starters are out for the year, and another might be finished. Plus, defensive stalwarts John Abraham and Ed Hartwell have played only three games apiece. 
Then again, Atlanta must have known it was taking a chance when it gave up a first-round pick to sign the injury prone Abraham to a huge contract. 
The three-time Pro Bowl end dominated Carolina in Week 1 before going down in the closing minutes with a groin injury that he's still trying to overcome. After abdominal surgery, he returned to face the Saints last week, but didn't even show up on the stat sheet.

ior for Greece Athena High School and is rated the 136th best Major League prospect of next year's draft. Dupra, however, has decided to take the college route and get a degree before heading on to the majors. 
Danieli towers over oppos­ing batters with his 6-foot-8, 2 2 5-pound frame. The imposing force has dominat­ed his opposition throughout high school to the tune of a 
1.10 ERA last season. 

Among the position play­ers, Schrage signed two catchers -Matt Katich of New Castle, Penn. and Cameron McConnell of Bannockburn, Ill. 
Katich hit .444 last season for Mohawk High School in New Castle, while McConnell hit .326 at Deerfield in Bannockburn. 
Matt Sciascia, from 
Westlake Village, Calif., could also eatch for the Irish, but he has experience at first base as well and can be used as a designated hit­ter. Sciascia is the son of' Anaheim Angels manager Mike Scioseia. 
Schrage also picked up two infielders in Mike Doyle of LaGrange Park, Ill. and Greg Sherry of Mendham, 
N.J. Both played shortstop in high school but could move to second or third base for the Irish if neeessary. 
Ty Adams, a 6-foot-7, 230­pound slugger from Indianapolis, Ind., is the only outfielder in this class. Adams hit .515 last season and hit nine home runs in just 72 at-bats. 
The 10 players will play their senior high school sea­sons next spring and enroll at Notre Dame for the fall of 2007, playing their first sea­sons for the Irish in the spring of 2008.

chance to work some kinks out. 
"I don't want to look past Winston-Salem State," he said. "We'll take the floor and it's .~n opportunity to get bet­ter. 
Junior forward Rob Kurz said many of the "kinks" have to do with the defensive end of the floor. Notre Dame allowed Lehigh to shoot 57 percent from the floor in a 93-87 Irish victory Monday. 
"Offense isn't the issue," Kurz said. "We need to work on our defense right now. We need to defend like we did last week against The Citadel." 
Against the Bulldogs Nov. 19, Notre Dame allowed just 12 points in the first half en route to an easy 74-50 victory. 
Brey said consistency on both ends of the floor would come once the Irish -who have only one junior and two scholarship seniors -gain more experience. Consequently, Brey has struc­tured most game preparation around teaching young play­ers his system rather than scouting the opposition. 
Brey said he would continue to stress the system even when Notre Dame gets into the tougher part of its sched­ule next week. 
"The preparation is mostly going to focusing on us and our development," he said. "We're not going to worry too much about scouting reports yet." 
The Rams, who have strug­gled to just one win in nine games this season under first­year coach Bobby Collins, are led by sophomore forward Jamal Durham, who is averag­ing 10.7 points and 5.4 rebounds per game. 
Winston-Salem State's lone victory this year came Nov. 14 against Anderson. The game was also the only time the Rams have played at home so far this season. 
As far as the Irish home court advantage goes, Brey has seen a half-full Joyce Center and a Leprechaun Legion that barely fills the lower section of its allotted area so far this young season. The coach said he hopes the crowds will be bigger as the competition gets tougher, but he would like to see a big crowd tonight as a "warm-up" for the Alabama game next Thursday. 
"We need our sixth man," he said. "It's extremely important for us to have good home court advantage."

The Belles rebounded well, keeping pace with the Flying Dutch and pulling down 40 boards compared to the Flying Dutch's 44. The Belles also committed fewer fouls {11 to Hope's 16) and shot 73 pereent from the charity stripe to Hope's 40 percent. 
Ultimately, Saint Mary's could not overcome its uncharacteristic shooting struggles of two of its top players. 
Kessler, who was an offen­sive force in the Belles' win over Anderson, was 2-for-13 from the floor -including 0­for-5 shooting from behind the arc. Senior guard Bridget Lipke, who also played an important role against Anderson, was 2-of-8 shoot­ing. Both Kessler and Lipke turned the ball over seven times. 
Freshman center Anna Kammrath recorded her first collegiate double-double in the losing effort. Kammrath scored 10 points and grabbed 13 rebounds coming off the 

bench. Hope center Ellen North Park Vikings at 7 p.m. Wood scored 14 points and in the North Park Viking had 7 rebounds to lead the ·Classic. Flying Dutch.

made our free throws." 

Before Lechlitner's three sealed the Irish lead, the Spiders were able to hang with Notre Dame during the first three-quarters of the game. Throughout the game, Richmond gave the Irish trouble from beyond the arc, shooting 46.7 per­cent as a team. The Spiders also used those 3-pointers to counter the Irish early and prevent any serious runs. 
"I was a little disappointed with our 3-point percentage defense," McGraw said. "I think that's something we've really got to improve. We still have a lot of work to do defensively and we're still not doing the job on the boards." 
Richmond could never pull ahead of the Irish because of the play of junior guard Charel Allen. After she was subbed out early for Lechlitner, Allen returned and rejuvenated the Irish squad, scoring the team's next eight points while also grabbing two boards to give Notre Dame a 16-10 lead. 
"[Allen] really came out ready to go offensively and she was able to do pretty much what she wanted on the floor," McGraw said. 
Notre Dame was also able to dominate inside against the shorter Spider lineup. Centers Me Iissa D'Amico and Erica Williamson com­bined to shoot 10-of-13 from the floor, with D'Amico scor­ing 15 points and Williamson adding 9. Williamson also grabbed seven rebounds while D'Amico had four. 
"I think the guards did a great job getting the ball inside to me, and Erica and I think we just got better position than we did last game [at USC]," D'Amico said. 
As the game was winding to a close, McGraw kept the pressure high against the Spiders, using a full court press right until the final buzzer. 
"That's the kind of game we need to play to keep our energy up," McGraw said. "In the first half, we didn't have a lot of success at it. I think we finally wore them down in the second half so we need to press." 
The press worked very effectively. Richmond turned the ball over to the Irish three times in the final three minutes of play for the starters, and the Irish won the game's turnover battle 21-16. 
"We're not averaging that many turnovers a game, and that's something we're doing really well mostly because Tulyah [Gaines] takes very good care of the ball, Charel takes great care of the ball, and we don't really turn it over that much," McGraw said. 
The Irish are off the rest of the week until taking on in-state rival Indiana Sunday at the Joyce Center. 
Notes: 
+Freshman forward Danielle Ben-Tsvulun recorded the first points of her Notre Dame career Tuesday night. Ben-Tsvulun was 3-of-4 from the free throw line and nabbed two rebounds in four minutes.

half, Allen personally outscored the Spiders 8-2 to put the Irish up 16-10 with 11 minutes left in the first 
half. 

Allen's 22-point finish marks the second time in six games this season that she has set a eareer high -top­ping her previous best of 21 that she tallied in an 85-81 overtime win over Bowling Green Nov. 13. 
And she said she felt hot well before the opening tip­off. 

"Before the game I warmed up very well," she said. "I felt like my shot was going in." 
Irish coach Muffet McGraw had nothing but praise for Allen after the game. 
"I thought Charel, start to finish, just had an outstand­ing game," she said. "I think Charel carried us in the first half along with Mel[issa D'Amico!, those two really did the bulk of the scoring in the first half." 
Despite Allen's efforts, and shooting 51.7 percent as a team, the Irish only led by three points heading into intermission. For the first part of the second half, Allen continued to be Notre Dame's leading weapon, scoring eight points in the first seven minutes of the half. 
Her final bueket with 13:22 remaining gave the Irish a 53-44 lead. Three minutes

later, freshman guard Melissa Lechlitner hit a 3­pointer that gave Notre Dame a 57-45 lead -its first 10-point advantage of the game -and Allen retired as a scoring factor as each basket only added to a large and growing lead. 
Still, Allen's-and to a lesser extent, D'Amieo's­presence on the floor and the subsequent attention it drew gave the Irish the opportunity to spread the ball around and ultimately put the game away. 

"In the second half we wanted to get some other people involved," McGraw said. "That's really where we opened up the game, [when! they were starting to key in on those two [Allen and D'Amieo]." 
D'Amico, who was second on the team with 15 points, joined Allen as one of five Notre Dame players to finish the game in double figures. Tuesday's performance was the second time in three games -and the second consecutive home game ­that the five Irish players had 10 or more points. The team accomplished the feat

Nov. 19 against Western Michigan. In part due to the more balanced attack, the Irish outscored the Spiders 53-35 in the second half. 
"I think it's important to have that kind of balance," McGraw said. 
It was Allen, however, who defined Notre Dame's per­formance. Though she didn't score after the 13:22 mark in the seeond half and sat down with 6:40 remaining in the game, Allen was the foeal point of the Spider defense, and Richmond head coach Michael Shafer doubt­ed his defense's ability to stop her. 
"We knew she was a very good basketball player, [and] we knew she could score over top of us," he said. ''I'm not sure we ever really affected her game -to her credit, she knocked down some big shots." 
Allen only hit those shots, though, when they mattered.

BASEBALL RECRUITING 
Schrage, Irish ink 'top-flight' recruit class for 2007-08 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Sports Editor 

Dave Schrage hasn't coached a baseball game yet at Notre Dame. 
But he's already won a major victory. Last week, Schrage announced the signing of 10 freshmen for 
next year, a class rated as one of the top in the nation by Perfect Game Crosschecker. 
"We signed some top-flight players and filled some voids in areas where we need to improve," Schrage said in a press release about the signing class. "We now have two strong classes to build on for the future, with some great potential leaders among those groups." 
The Irish signed three pitch­ers and six position players, with David Casey of Whitefish Bay, Wis., a possibility to con­tribute at first base or as a left-handed pitcher. 
Casey batted .533 in his jun­ior season last spring and has a 2.81 EHA in his varsity high school career as a pitcher. 
The other three pitchers, righthanders Evan Danieli of East Hanover, N.J., Brian Dupra of Hochester, N.Y., and Ryan Sharpley of Marshall, Mich., are all listed in Perfect Game's top 40 high school pitchers. 
Sharpley is the brother of sophomore first baseman Evan

Despite trailing throughout almost the entire game, Hichmond held close to Notre Dame until freshman guard Melissa Lechlitner nailed a 3­pointer to extend the Irish lead to double-digits. 
Lechlitner's three was the beginning of an important run for Notre Dame, which scored 11 of the next 13 points en route to an 87-66 win Tuesday at the Joyce Center. 
"I thought we had a really good spurt in the second half," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "[We] hit some shots, got a little better defensively, stopped fouling for a few minutes, and we

While the game was still in the balance, Charel Allen carried the Irish. 
The junior guard scored 22 points and added six rebounds as Notre Dame topped Hichmond 87-66.

Belles drop first MIAA matchup on the road 
By DAN COOPER Sports Writer 

No. 2 II ope College employed suffocating defense to defeat Saint Mary's 67-42 Tuesday night -the 32nd consecutive win for the defending national champion Flying Dutch and the first MIAA gamfl for both teams. 
The Flying Dutch improved to 3-0 on the season with the win, while the Belles fell to 1­4. 
The Belles jumped out to an early 6-4 lead, but Hope surged ahead with a 15-0 run and didn't look back. 
Hope's run was due in large part to the two teams' field goal percentage. Although the Flying Dutch shot a respectable 43 percent from the field, they held the Belles to a season-low 27 percent shooting (15-of-55). 
Hope also had the edge in turnovers, scoring 22 points off Saint Mary's 29 turnovers. In contrast, the Belles scored eight points on 20 takeaways. 
"They played tough man D. They put a lot of pressure on the ball," Saint Mary's guard Alison Kessler said. "They had a better transition game and were better at getting the ball up the court."
