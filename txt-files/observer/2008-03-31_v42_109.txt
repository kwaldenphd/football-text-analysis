ND female reports sexual assault 
NDSP says case not connected to recent alleged rape on campus, has not found suspect 

By KATIE KOHLER News Writer 
A female Notre Dame stu­dent reported being sexually assaulted between Pasquerilla West and Siegfried Halls at 2 a.m. Sunday, director of Notre Dame Security Police (NDSP) Phil Johnson said. 
Johnson said this case is not related to another sexual assault reported to NDSP on March 23 in which a female student claimed she was raped in her residence hall by an acquaintance. 
"We are still investigating that case, but there is no rea­son to assume that these 
events are in any way con­nected," Johnson said. 
Johnson said NDSP did not know the name of the suspect in Sunday's assault. 
According to an e-mail NDSP sent to students Sunday, the female told NDSP the suspect followed her and walked with her from West quad to North quad and asked her questions. When she declined to give the sus­pect her telephone number, he allegedly grabbed her by the hair, held her against the wall and fondled her near the northwest corner of Siegfried hall. 
The suspect fled the scene

Phones collected for soldiers 
By MARGARET MIRSHAK 
News Writer 
Administrative assistant for the political science depart­ment Elizabeth Tucker began collecting used cell phones in conjunction with the organi­zation Cell Phones for Soldiers as a way to show her gratitude for U.S. troops overseas. So far, she has col­lected 20 phones. 
Cell Phones for Soldiers, which collects old cell phones and sends them to a Michigan-based recycling center, distributes pre-paid calling cards to soldiers oversees in order to defray the massive costs of overseas calls. 
"It is a good way to give something back to those who sacrifice for us. It helps sol­diers stay in touch with fami­ly back home," Tucker said. 
Tucker, who is married to a military veteran, came across the Cell Phones for Soldiers Web site and wanted to start a local collection point for the Michiana area. She packages the collected cell phones and sends them to HeCellular, Inc. in Michigan. 
Tucker said recycling cell phones is also beneficial to the environment. Americans replace nearly 130 million cell phones each year, filling landfills with discarded phones and producing tons of solid waste.

SMC alum discusses NWP tactics 
Taylor claims suffragette protesters innovated new political practices 
By SARAH MAYER News Writer 
Saint Mary's alumnus and curator of the Sewali-Belmont House & Museum Daniello Taylor discussed the protest tactics used by the National Women's Party (NWP) during the suffrage movement in the early 20th century, including peacefully picketing the White House, in her lecture Saturday at the Science Hall. 
Sewall-Belmont House & Museum displays permanent exhibits of women's suffrage and equal rights memorabilia in Washington D.C. 
According to Taylor. the strategies used by the NWP now serve as models protes­
tors today. 
"Their tactics have evolved to be very relevant in today's society," she said. 
The NWP was "the first group to peacefully picket the White House," Taylor said. 
Over 2,000 picketers were arrested during nationwide demonstrations. They were also the first group to demand status as political prisoners in 
U.S. history, Taylor said. 
In addition, women attempt­ed to dispel the image of "dainty, Victorian figures," Taylor said. Figures such as Joan of Arc became symbols of suffragist parades. 
The party also utilized the media, establishing a weekly newspaper called "The Suffragist," to guarantee cov­erage of women's issues. 
Political cartoons in the newspaper portrayed women as bound and gagged by Uncle Sam, Taylor said. 
After 1920, when women earned the right to vote, party leaders focused attention on the Equal Bights Amendment. 
The party also developed the "Congressional Card Index," which listed the names of the congressmen's favorite restau­rants, their wives' names and their positions on women's rights. 
The lecture was sponsored by the Saint Mary's College Women's Studies and History Departments.

Missing pastor found in strip club 
HIVEHSIDE, Ohio ­Police say a pastor who was reported missing from his home in western New York has been found at an Ohio strip club. 
A police officer patrolling the K.C. Lounge parking lot Friday morning in the Dayton suburb of Riverside spotted out-of-state license plates on 46-year-old Craig Rhodenizer's car. 
The FBI and New York authorities had been searching for Rhodenizer, who disappeared Wednesday after telling his wife he was getting his computer fixed at Best Buy. He is the pastor of a church in Lyndonville, N.Y. 

Detective Matt Sturgeon said Rhodenizer was dis­oriented when confronted by police and said he felt "emotionally guilty."

Missing soldier's remains found 
DNA test confirms identity of 20-year-old private captured in 2004 
Associated Press 
BATAVIA, Ohio -The father of a soldier listed as missing-cap­tured in Iraq since 2004 said Sunday that the military had informed him that his son's remains had been found. 
Keith Maupin said an Army general told him DNA testing had identified the remains of his son. Sgt. Keith Matthew Maupin, or "Matt" as he was commonly known. He said the Army didn't say how or where in Iraq his son's remains were discovered, only that officials found a shirt similar to the one his son was wearing at the time of his disap­pearance. 
"My heart sinks, but I know they can't hurt him anymore," Maupin said, speaking in the sol-. dier's hometown near suburban Cincinnati. 
The Army was continuing its investigation, he said. 
Lt. Lee Packnett. an Army public affairs officer in Washington, confirmed that the Maupins were notified Sunday that their son's remains had been identified. Packnett said an official statement about the iden­tification would be released Monday. 
Matt Maupin was a 20-year­old private first class when he was captured April 9. 2004, after his fuel convoy, part of the 724th Transportation Company, was ambushed west of Baghdad. 
A week later. the Arab televi­
sion network Al-Jazeera aired a videotape showing Maupin sit­ting on the lloor surrounded by five masked men holding auto­matic rifles. 
That June, Al-Jazeera aired another tape purporting to show a U.S. soldier being shot. But the dark and grainy tape showed only the back of the victim's head and not the actual shoot­ing. 
The Maupins refused to believe it was their son, and the Army had listed him as missing­captured. The Maupins lobbied hard for the Army to continue listing their son as missing-cap­tured. fearing that another des­ignation would undermine efforts to find him. 
Keith Maupin said the Army told him early on that there was only a 50 Ribbon Support Center in Batavia. an office they used to package thousands of boxes of donated snacks and toiletries for shipment to soldiers in Iraq. 

"It hurts," Carolyn Maupin said of her son's death. "After you go through almost four years of hope, and this is what happens, it's like a let down. so I'm trying to get through that right now." 
Two U.S. soldiers remain miss­ing in action in Iraq. Ahmed Qusai al-Taayie, a 41-year-old Iraqi-born reserve soldier from Ann Arbor, Mich., was abducted while visiting his Iraqi wife on Oct. 23, 2007, in Baghdad. Capt. Michael Speicher, a Navy pilot, has been missing since the 1991 
Persian Gulf War.

French architeet 
wins Pritzker prize 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -Jean Nouvel, the French...architect whose hyper-modern buildings have been acclaimed for their eclectic nature and departure from tradition, has won the 2008 Pritzker Architecture Prize, it was announced Sunday. 
Nouvel joins Frank Gehry, Tadao Ando and I.M. Pei in receiving the top honor in the field in recognition of his high­rises, museums and perform­ance halls around the world. 
"I think they understood very well that I fight for specific architecture against generic architecture," Nouvel said by phone from his office in Paris. "Every project is an adventure." 
Nouvel, 62, became the sec­ond Pritzker laureate to be cho­sen from France after Christian de Portzamparc, the 1994 recipient. 
A formal ceremony will be held in June at the Library of Congress in Washington. Nouvel will receive a $100,000 grant and a bronze medallion. 
The PrHzker jury of archi­tects. critics, academics and others praised Nouvel for his "persistence, imagination, exu­berance, and, above all, an insatiable urge for creative experimentation." 
Nouvel said his structures reflect time, place and occu­
pants rather than simply adher­ing to stylistic dogma or histori­cal precedent. 
"I think every site, every pro­gram, has a right to a specific work. to a complete involve­ment of the architect," he said. "I am always researching the missing piece of the puzzle, and I like to analyze the site and conditions and give my answer after." 
Among the 200 projects sin­gled out by the Pritzker jury were Arab World Institute in Paris, which is festooned with motor-controlled apertures to control natural light, and Guthrie Theater, a boxy struc­ture in Minneapolis with exteri­or screens that show scenes from past performances at the storied playhouse. 
Currently planned by Nouvel are a tower alongside New York's Museum of Modern Art that cuts a jagged profile to a height comparable to the Chrysler Building. and a nar­row condo building dubbed the "Green Blade" in the Century City area of Los Angeles with verdant gardens visible behind its glass walls. 
"He is an architect who is really always pushing the enve­lope, whose work is uneven ­all of us agree on that -but his successes are so spectacular," said architectural historian and author Victoria Newhouse, a Pritzker juror.

Bush begins fare-well world tour 
Despite unpopularity, president will visit NATO, Putin on trip 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Winding down his presidency, George W. Bush is beginning his farewell tour on the world stage trailed by questions about how much clout he still wields. 
Unpopular abroad, as he is at home, Bush nevertheless has been a commanding presence among world leaders for the past seven years. Now, with land in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi for his probable final meeting with Vladimir Putin as Russian president; his succes­sor takes over in May. 
Relations between Washington and Moscow have plummeted in recent years amid a welter of bitter disputes, and the talks in Sochi have raised hopes that Bush and Putin can lay the foundation for repairing ties. 
This is busiest travel year in

"There seems to be a great deal of enthusiasm, particularly for (Barack) Obama but also Hillary (Hodham Clinton) on the other side of the Atlantic, that there's going to be some revital­ization of the trans-Atlantic partnership and we start with a clean slate and a new chapter and all the rest," said Julianne Smith, Europe program direc­tor for the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
"I think a lot of these European countries have found a way to get past the dark shadows of 2003 and '04 when we had divides over Iraq and all the rest," she said. "And many of them are looking for­ward now to the next president in Washington and are already thinking about what the 2009 (NATO) summit will bring." 
A change of leaders in Germany and France -which led the opposition to the war in Iraq -helped improve sour relations between Europe and the United States. But there still is some lingering ill will. There has been much trans-Atlantic bickering and finger-pointing, most notably about the purpose of NATO and its commitment to Afghanistan. 
The U.S has criticized Germany and other European allies that have refused to allow their troops in Afghanistan to be deployed to the southern heartland of Taliban insurgeney alongside U.S., British, Canadian. Duteh and other con­tingents. Defense Secretary Hobert Gates has proclaimed himself "a nag on the issue."

Shiite cleric orders militia off streets 
BAGHDAD -In a possible turning point in the recent upsurge in violence, Muqtada al­Sadr ordered his Shiite militiamen off the streets Sunday but called on the government to stop its raids against his followers. 
The government welcomed the move, which followed intense negotiations by Shiite offi­cials, including two lawmakers who reportedly traveled to Iran to ask religious authorities there to intervene. 
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, whose offen­sive that began Tuesday in the oil-rich south­ern city in Basra sparked the crisis, called al­Sadr's statement "a step in the right direc­tion." 
But fighting continued in the Basra area after the announcement. Seven people also were killed when a mortar struck a residential district in Baghdad's Karradah district, and witnesses reported clashes in the Shula area in a northern section of the capital. 
Islam now world's largest religion 
VATICAN CITY -Islam has surpassed Roman Catholicism as the world's largest reli­gion, the Vatican newspaper said Sunday. 
"For the first time in history, we are no longer at the top: Muslims have overtaken us," Monsignor Vittorio Formenti said in an inter­view with the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano. Formenti compiles the Vatican's year­book. 
He said that Catholics accounted for 17.4 
percent of the world population -a stable 
percentage -while Muslims were at 19.2 per­
cent.

NEW YORK -Dith Pran, The Cambodian­born journalist whose harrowing tale of enslavement and eventual escape from that country's murderous Khmer Rouge revolution­aries in 1979 became the subject of the award­winning film 'The Killing Fields," died Sunday. He was 65. 
Dith died at a New Jersey hospital Sunday morning of pancreatic cancer, according to Sydney Schanberg, his former colleague at The New York Times. Dith had been diagnosed almost three months ago. 
Dith was working as an interpreter and assis­tant for Schanberg in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, when the Vietnam War reached its chaotic end in April 1975 and both countries were taken over by Communist forces. 
Man kills his own three children 
BALTIMORE -A man killed his three young children at a downtown hotel Sunday, then called the front desk to report the killings, police said. 
Mark Castillo, 41, of Silver Spring, called the desk at the Baltimore Marriott Inner Harbor at Camden Yards at about 1:15 p.m. Sunday and said he had just killed his two sons and daughter, said police spokesman Sterling Clifford. Police identified the chil­dren as Anthony, 6, Austin, 4, and Athena, 2.

Clinton speaks at Mishawaka school 
MISHAWAKA -Aaron Honchell was unhappy when he learned Hillary Rodham Clinton would­n't be speaking at his South Bend school because officials thought a town hall meeting there would disrupt students. 
But that didn't stop the Washington High School junior from seeing the presidential candi­date in person Friday. 
Honchell was among dozens of Washington High students who made the short trip to Mishawaka to hear the former first lady speak as part of a two-day, six-city swing through Indiana in her quest for the Democratic nomination. 
"We wanted to show Hillary that we approve of her and we wanted her there," Honchell said. 
About 4,000 people turned out at Mishawaka High School for Clinton's appearance, her second swing through Indiana in just over a week in a state that finds itself a political battleground for the first time since 1968. 
Women voters support Clinton 
Top democrats want former first lady to exit race, clear path for Obama 
Associated Press 
NEW ALBANY -Debra Starks has heard the calls for Hillary Rodham Clinton to quit the presi­dential race, and she's not happy about it. 
The 53-year old Wal­Mart clerk, so bedecked with Clinton campaign buttons most days that friends call her "Button Lady," thinks sexism is playing a role in efforts to push the New York sena­tor from the race. Starks wants Clinton to push back. 
"The way I look at it, she's a strong woman and she needs to stay in there. She needs to fight," Starks said at a Clinton campaign rally. "If you want to be president, you have to fight for what you want. If she stays in there and does what she's supposed to do, I think she'll be on her way." 
Amid mounting calls from top Democrats for Clinton to step aside and clear the path for rival Barack Obama, strategists are warning of damage to the party's chances in November if women ­who make up the majority of Democratic voters nationwide, but especially the older, white working­class women who've long formed the former first lady's base -sense a mostly male party estab­lishment is unfairly muscling Clinton out of the race. 
"Women will indeed be upset if it appears people are trying to push Hillary Clinton out of the way," said Carol Fowler, the South Carolina Democratic Party chair who is backing Obama. "If you are going to ask her to withdraw. you'd better be making a strong case for it -both to the candidate and the public." 
Vermont Sen. Patrick 
Leahy last week became 
the first leading Democrat 
to openly call on Clinton to 
abandon her bid and back 
Obama, a sentiment 
shared by many activists 


worried that a drawn-out nominating contest only bolsters Republican nomi­nee-in-waiting John McCain. 
Other Obama supporters have echoed that view while stopping short of asking Clinton to with­draw. 
New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson on Sunday called Obama's lead all but insurmountable, while Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry said the contest would be reaching "a point of judgment" very soon. 
"I don't think it's up to our campaign or any indi­vidual to tell Hillary Clinton or their campaign when that is," Kerry, the 2004 Democratic nominee, said on ABC's "This Week" on Sunday. "But there will 
be, I think, a consensus about it, and I think it's going to occur over these next weeks." 
To be sure, Clinton cam­paign officials concede her path to winning the nomi­nation is not at all clear. 
She almost certainly will end the primary season narrowly trailing Obama in the popular vote and among pledged delegates unless the nullified pri­maries in Florida and Michigan are counted ­an unlikely scenario at best. But Obama is unlike­ly to end the race with the 2,024 pledged delegates needed to win outright either, meaning the nomi­nee will be determined by roughly 800 "superdele­gates" -elected officials and party insiders who can back whichever candi­date they want. 
Most observers believe the superdelegates are unlikely to risk an intra­party uproar -not to mention the ire of black voters thrilled to support a black candidate -by sid­ing with Clinton if Obama maintains his lead among pledged delegates. 
But Clinton advisers believe many superdele­gates remain at least per­suadable, due in no small part to the influence of women voters on the party and in the general elec­tion. 
"My e-mail is bursting with women who are furi­ous, and it's grown in the last week," said Ann Lewis, Clinton's director of women's outreach and a longtime Democratic activist. 
SOUTH KOREA 

Threat of nuclear attack increases tension 
Associated Press 
SEOUL -North Korea threat­ened South Korea with destruction Sunday after Seoul's top military officer said his country would con­sider attacking the communist nation if it tried to carry out a nuclear attack. 

The statement from North Korea's official news agency marked the third straight day of bellicose rhetoric from the North, which is angry over the harsher line the South's conservative new president has taken against the country since assuming office last month. 
"Our military will not sit idle until warmongers launch a pre­emptive strike," said an unidenti­fied KCNA military commentator. "Everything will be in ashes, not just a sea of fire, if our advanced pre-emptive strike once begins." 
On Friday, North Korea test-fired a barrage of missiles into the sea and warned it would "mercilessly wipe out" any South Korean war­ships that violate its waters near their disputed sea border. 
Such rhetoric by North Korea at times of increased tensions is not rare, and it comes just two days before a scheduled visit to South Korea by the chief U.S. negotiator 
in North Korean nuclear disarma­ment talks. South Korea's Defense Ministry reacted calmly. 
A senior military officer at the ministry said officials were work­ing "to ensure the public would not worry about" the North's recent actions and statements. He declined to elaborate and asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media. 
Sunday's KCNA statement also warned that the North would sus­pend all scheduled inter-Korean dialogue unless Seoul retracts and apologizes for the remark by its new top military leader. 
SWEDEN 
Strict~er asylu111la"Ws affect Iraqis 
Nation tightens immigration regulations to preserve welfare system 
Associated Press 
SOLLENTUNA -The fear of 

being sent back to Baghdad has 
taknn its toll on Mustafa Aziz 
Alwi. 
He says hn cannot slnep and has lost about 20 pounds since his claim for asylum in Sweden was rejected in .January. 
"They told me it's beeause it's ealnwr in Iraq now, that I can go b<t«:k and b11 happy. But they don't know that it's death there," said Aziz Alwi, 25, wip­ing away tears in an interview at his cousin's apartment in the Stockholm suburb of Sollnntuna. 
Had his ease been deeided a year earlier, he would probably already hold a residence per­mit. Sweden has given shelter to about 100,000 Iraqis, 40,000 of tlwm since the U.S.-Ied inva­sion in 2003. That's far more than any other Western country ineluding the U.S., which admitted just o\-er 1,600 Iraqi refugees in the 2007 fiscal year, nearly 400 short of the annual goal or 2,000, and a big reduc­tion from an initial target of 7,000. 
But Sweden has gradually tightened its asylum rules, wor­ried that its generous welfare system can't cope. 
The effects became evident this year, when immigration statisties obtained by The Associated Press showed only 

AP Iraqi asylum seeker Mustafa Aziz Alwi, left, may be sent back home to Iraq due to changes in Sweden's immigration policies. 
28 percent of the claims were approved in .January and 23 percent in February -down from 85 percent in January 2007. 
While Sweden has won praise for the welcome it extends to Iraqis, the government sees the surge of newcomers as out of control and has appealed in vain to fellow European Union states to share the burden. 
"We find it totally unaccept­able that some countries do a lot while others do very little," Migration Minister Tobias Hillstrom told the AP. 
"When very many people arrive within a very short peri­od of time. it puts an enormous strain on the system, like schools and health care," he 

said. 

In 2007, more than 18,000 Iraqis applied for asylum in Sweden -four times more than in Germany and 10 times more than in Britain, according to figures compiled by the· European Council of Hefugees and Exiles, an advocacy group. 
But the numbers dropped sharply this year, with only 835 asylum-seekers coming to Sweden in February -down nearly 40 percent from the pre­vious month to the lowest level since .July 2006. In the first three weeks of March, only 376 Iraqis sought asylum in Sweden, suggesting the down­ward trend continues.

Him, 1V actors to negotiate separately 
LOS ANGELES -Unions representing film and television actors will negotiate separately with producers in upcoming contract talks after board members of the TV actors union voted Saturday to sever a long-standing agreement between the two guilds. 
The vote by the board of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists came hours before a meeting with the Screen Actors Guild and just three months before the expiration of the contract covering movies and prime-time shows. 
Despite a sometimes rocky 27 -year relation­ship the unions had shown recent signs of peace as they prepared for the upcoming talks. 
The two groups had hoped at Saturday's meet­ing to set a start date for negotiations. Instead of discussing strategies the sides swapped accusa­tions. 
"For the past year SAG leadership in Hollywood has engaged in a relentless campaign of disinformation and disparagement," AFTRA president Roberta Reardon said in a written statement. 
Vytorin fails to improve heart disease 
CHICAGO -Leading doctors urged a return to older, tried-and-true treatments for high cholesterol after hearing full results Sunday of a failed trial of Vytorin. 
Millions of Americans already take the drug or one of its components, Zetia. But doctors were stunned to learn that Vytorin failed to improve heart disease even though it worked as intended to reduce three key risk factors. 
"People need to turn back to statins," said Yale University cardiologist Dr. Harlan Krumholz, referring to Lipitor, Crestor and other widely used brands. "We know that statins are good drugs. We know that they reduce risks." 
The study was closely watched because Zetia and Vytorin have racked up $5 billion in sales despite limited proof of benefit. Two Congressional panels launched probes into why it took drugmakers nearly two years after the study's completion to release results.

Candidates devise economic plans 
Democrats support stimulus packages; McCain proposes to protect markets 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Hillary Rodham Clinton, Barack Obama and John McCain have diagnosed the swooning U.S. econo­my and have come up with rival plans to revive it. If the downturn lasts as long as some econo­mists predict, one of the three will get a chance to try to sell his or her pro­posal to Congress as president. 
Or if the economy hits bottom before Inauguration Day and then turns up, the victor may be handed a rare gift: the chance to begin a presidency presiding over the early stages of a rebound. 
Take your pick. Who knows where the econo­my will be in nine and a half months?

"I know intuitivoly there's noth­ing I could have done to protect them," he told The Associated J>rnss in a recent interview. "But it doesn't changr the fact that, inside, I feel like I wanted to be able to do something." 
Grady has SWAT team training and has advised governments and militaries in war-torn coun­tries, but the shooting, he said, was the "ugliest" test of his 1:arenr. And it was one that rein­forced and, in some ways, soft­ennd the grun· persona that had sometimes eausnd him trouble.

PAKISTAN 
Militant leader open to peace talks 
Maulvi Faqir Mohammed says 'Our war is with America' 
Associated Press 

ISLAMABAD -A militant leader with alleged ties to ai­Qaida welcomed an offer by Pakistan's new prime minister to negotiate with Islamic fight­ers accused of launching ter­rorist attacks from tribal regions bordering Afghanistan. 
Maulvi Faqir Mohammed also said Sunday his fighters were not "enemies" of Pakistan. "Our war is with America," he said. 
Speaking in the Bajur tribal region, Mohammed told more than 4,000 supporters -hun­dreds of armed militants among them -"We welcome the government"s announce­ment of talks with the Taliban." 
Pakistani authorities claim Mohammed has ties with al­Qaida No. 2 leader Ayman al­Zawahri. His comments came a day after Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said in his inaugu­ral speech that fighting terror­ism was his government"s top priority. 
But in a rebuke to the strong­arm anti-terrorism policy of the U.S.-allied President Pervez Musharraf, GHani also said his government was willing to talk to militants who are ready to lay down their arms and "join the path of peace." 
Expanding education and development in the impover­ished region would be a "key pillar" of the government"s strategy against militants in the tribal zone, he said. 
The United States has criti­cized past efforts to reach out to militants, saying it has allowed hard-liners to tighten their grip along the border. 
Many Pakistanis believe Musharraf"'s reliance on large­scale army operations, as well as his tacit approval of U.S. airstrikes inside Pakistan, have endangered civilians and pro­duced a spike in domestic ter­
rorism. 
Also Sunday, Gilani's admin­istration called for Musharraf to step down. 
"The sooner he resigns the better it is for himself and for the democratic process," said Ahsan Iqbal, a lawmaker from the Pakistan Muslim League­N party who is 

a leader in 
"The sooner

"On Feb. 18 people have voted against his policies and have voted for change," Iqbal said. 
Opposition parties ~wept last month's parliamentary elec­tions amid resentment over Musharraf's increasingly authoritarian rule, Pakistan's mounting economic problems and a surge in militant attacks. 
The defeat has triggered calls for Musharraf -a former army chief who seized power in a military coup eight years ago -to resign. 
Parliament elected Gilani, a loyalist of slain opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, as prime minister last week. On Monday, Musharraf was expected to swear in more than 20 members of the new Cabinet. 
Mohammed, the militant leader, said the government 
should not coop­
erate with the 
"death to 
America." 
Maulana Fazlur Hehman, a pro-Taliban cleric and member of Gilani's coalition govern­ment, said the new administra­tion will try to prevent the U.S. military from launching further airstrikes inside Pakistan. 
"We will try our best to stop America from making any fur­ther attacks in our border arnas," Hehman told reportors in the eastern city of Mullan.

Young French Musfuns fight in Iraq 
Seven men accused ofcriminal association with terrorist enterprises 
Associated Press 
PARIS -Boubakeur el Hakim traded his Paris neighborhood of boulangeries and halal butcher shops for the insurgent camps of Iraq. When he came home, he told his war stories to other young men on the forgotten edges of French society, allegedly persuading some to follow in his footsteps. 
His younger brother did, and died fighting U.S. forces. 
After years of investigation by French authorities, el Hakim, 24, went on trial this month in a case exposing how the Iraq war has sucked radical youths from Europe to a battlefield where they have learned skills that offi­cials fear may one day be used in domestic terror attacks. 
Along with four other young Frenchmen, a Moroccan and an Algerian, el Hakim is accused of funneling French Muslim fighters

All seven men are accused of Muslims and betraying western ideals of tolerance. 

The suspected nucleus of the network, janitor-turned-street preacher Benyettou, told the court the case against him was 
criminal associa­tion with a terrorist enterprise, a vague charge that carries a maximum 10­year sentence, though the prose­cutor only asked for between three and eight years. 
The case is a del­icate one in France, which strongly opposed the U.S.-led cam­

In one interrogation session with anti-terrorist agents, howev­er, Benyettou said: "I taught that suicide attacks are legitimate under Islam." 
"Jihad is justified," he said in another session in the days fol­lowing his January 2005 arrest, according to the depositions viewed by The Associated Press. 
El Hakim described placing and detonating roadside bombs with equipment that resembled a cordless phone, the transcript of one deposition says. He claimed 10 American troops were killed in the last three operations he took part in, it says. 
In a French radio interview broadcast from Baghdad in 2003, he urged Parisian friends to join him on the battlefields. ''I'm ready to set off dynamite and boom! Boom! We kill all the Americans!" he said on RTL radio. 
In court, while he didn't deny his radio appeal, el Hakim said some of his statements to police were made under duress and that his role in Iraq was primarily "humanitarian." 
Investigators say the alleged network funneled about a dozen French fighters to camps linked to al-Qaida in Iraq head Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and sought to send more before he was killed in a U.S. airstrike in 2006. At least seven French insurgents have died, some in suicide bombings, police say.

OAKLAND -At a high school in a struggling neigh­borhood in this violence­scarred city, Mayor Ron Dellums stood on tiptoe and congratulated a basketball player who led his team to a state championship. 
"In a community where we find ourselves more often than not mourning, we are rejoicing," the former con­gressman told the grinning teenager and hundreds of other screaming students. 
Such celebrations have been rare during Dellums" 15 months in office. 
In recent months, a 10­year-old boy was paralyzed by a bullet that struck him during a piano lesson, a powerful state politician was carjacked by a masked man, a popular community jour­nalist was gunned down in broad daylight, and a 13-year­old was shot in the foot outside go to founda­

Bay from San Francisco has logged 34 homicides, more than double than during the same period last year. 
"It's very frustrating," the mayor said in a rare sit­down interview. "I get up every morning praying that I don't open the newspaper and there's somebody dead." 
The Democrat, 72, was swept into office after a stint on the Berkeley City Council in the 1960s and nearly three decades on Capitol Hill, including chairmanship of the House Armed Services Committee. He had been ready to retire when resi­

what we"re up against, and that's not simplistic," the mayor said. 
Dellums and his staff have made progress toward get­ting Oakland"s police force up to full strength, a step that previous mayors had failed to achieve. The department is currently more than 70 officers short and losing five more each month to retirement. 
He oversaw an agreement between the officers union and the city that will return authority for deploying offi­cers to Police Chief Wayne Tucker. Before the agree­ment, that power resided with the union. 
Brown, who is now California's attorney general, cautions that the police department has many more hurdles to overcome: "The crime rate is extremely high and it's dangerous work, and in Oakland you have a num­ber of individuals who are not sympathetic to police." 
Dellums, a staunch liberal who successfully ushered anti-apartheid legislation through Congress that helped free political prison­ers, isn't so naive to think progress will be made overnight. 
"I think we're putting in place the pieces that I think will ultimately create a bet­ter community for every­body," he said. 
While the mayor has been portrayed as aloof and criti­cized for leaving the city to campaign for Hillary Rodham Clinton in her bid to become the Democratic nom­inee for president, he gets support from people like Richard Rodriguez, whose son is the one paralyzed by a stray bullet that struck him during a piano lesson.

ZIMBABWE 
Opposition party 
lead:s in elections 
Associated Press 
HAHAHE -Zimbabwe's main opposition party claimed an early lead Sunday in elections, seeking to thwart any possible vote rigging by President Hobert Mugabe amid silence from the Electoral Commission and the deployment of seeurity forces. 
Earlier people celebrated in the strnets, dancing, singing and giving each other the openhand­ed wave that is the opposition party's symbol. 
But by sundown, as frustra­tions grew more than 24 hours after polls closed, riot police and other security forces were patrolling the capital's densely populated suburbs, according to independent election monitors. 
In previous elections, partial results have been announced within hours of voting ending. 
"Why are we not getting the results? It's very clear to me Mugabe wants to steal this elec­tion," said Jlapisson Mate, a 23­year-old first-time voter. 
The head of the Pan-African Parliament observer mission warned the delay was creating "anxiety" and warned of a sce­nario similar to Kenya, where a delayed announcement of results from a disputed December elec­tion led to an explosion of vio­lence. More than 1,000 people were killed. 
"These are the delays that start causing problems," Marwick Khumalo, head of the Pan-African Parliament observers, told South African Broadcasting Corp. TV. 
Discontent with Mugabe has grown nationwidt'' and the elec­tion was seen as the toughest challenge to his 2R-year rule. Unemployment stands at 80 per­cent -the same percentage that survives on less 
taken some of Mugabe's rural 
strongholds. The claims were 
based on results posted 
overnight on the doors of polling 
stations. 
But the outcome of the race 
was impossible to predict with­
out results from other rural 
areas, where three-quarters of 
Zimbabwe's population live and 
Mugabe garners most of his sup­
port. 
Security and government offi­
cials loyal to Mugabe have 
warned Tsvangirai against 
declaring a victory. "It is called a 
coup d'etat and we all know how 
coups are handled," chief presi­
dential spokesman George 
Charamba was quoted as saying 
in the state-controlled Sunday 
Mail newspaper. 
Two officials of the ruling party said Mugabe was consulting with his security chiefs Sunday night amid fears of how they might react to any news of his defeat. The chiefs all have said they would serve only Mugabe. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity beeause of the sensi­tivity of the issue. 
Western diplomats, who also spoke on condition of anonymity for that same reason, reported that many younger army officers showed open defiance of orders that they had to vote for Mugabe. 
On Sunday, commission chair­man Judge George Chiweshe was forced to flee from a Harare hotel after he was mobbed by journalists and ordinary people. "We want results," they yelled. 
"This has been a more compli­cated election," Chiweshe said. "We will be releasing the results as soon as we can." He said it was taking time because Zimbabweans -for the first time -voted for president, the two houses of Parliament and local councilors, so four ballots have to be count-

Mugabe calls his opponents stooges of former colonial ruler Britain and says the nation must make sacrifices to overcome its eoloniallegacy. 
Hunning against Mugabe are chief opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, 55, who narrowly lost disputed 2002 elections, and former ruling party loyalist and finance minister Simba Makoni, 
58. If no presidential candidate wins 50 percent plus one vote, there will b!l a runoll'. 
Tsvangirai's Movement for Dmnocratie Change said he was leading the prnsidential race with 67 pereent ot' votes, basing its unof'licial count on returns l'rom 35 percent ol' polling sta­tions nationwide. 
The party also claimed to have areas." 
"If this is not 
ref1ected in the 
results, this will be yet another indication that the election was rigged," they added. 
Mugabe has dismissed allega­tions of vote rigging. "We do not rig," he said Saturday after vot­ing and promising to respect results. "If you lose an election and are rejeeted by the people, it is time to leave politics." 
Observers from the Pan­African Parliament, though, have questioned thousands of names on the offieial voter roll, and the government has barred several international media organiza­tions and some observers from the U.S. and Europe. 
The Southern African Development Community's observer mission said it was con­cerned by the threats made by the eountry's security chiefs, delays in produeing the voters' roll, the presence of police offi­cers in polling stations and lack of impartiality in the state media.

Beijing accepts Olylllpic torch 
Pro-Tibetan protesters chant, hold banners before police intervention 
Associated Press 
ATHENS -Chinese spectators cheered Sunday as Greece handed off the Olympic flame for its journey to Beijing and relay through 20 countries. But pro­testers brandishing Tibetan flags stole the limelight. 
Some two dozen activists chanted "Save Tibet!" and unfurled a banner reading "Stop Genocide in Tibet" before police intervened, detaining 21 protest­ers outside the Panathenian Stadium. Most were later freed. 
A police cordon prevented the demonstrators from disrupting the final leg of Greece's relay from the Acropolis to the marble stadium, the venue of the first modern Olympics in 1896. 
About 7,000 Greek and Chinese spectators cheered as Greek triple jumper Hrysopigi Devetzi carried the torch into the stadium, lined with the flags of both countries. Greek presi­dential guards and actresses dressed as ancient priestesses looked on. 
"It was an emotional experi­ence for me," Devetzi said. "I hope the flame will bring light to all athletes, especially those from Greece and that everything with the Games goes well." 
The president of the Hellenic Olympic Committee, Minos Kyriakou, delivered the flame to chief Beijing organizer Liu Qi. The torch later left Athens on a specially equipped Air China flight expected to arrive in Beijing on Monday. 
Qi promised a "grand welcom­ing ceremony" in Tiananmen Square, where the government

Katrina victin1s to repay grants 
Company may collect up to $150,000 from hurricane survivors 
Associated Press 
NEW OHLEANS-Imagine that your home was reduced to mold and wood framing by Hurricane Katrina. 
Desperate for money to rebuild, you engage in a frustrat­ing bureaucratic process, and after months of living in a gov­ernment-provided trailer tainted with formaldehyde you finally win a federal grant. 
Then a collector calls with the staggering news that you have to pay back thousands of dollars. 
Thousands of Katrina victims may be in that situation. 
A private contractor under investigation for the compensa­tion it received to run the Road Home grant program for Katrina victims says that in the rush to deliver aid to homeowners in need some people got too much. Now it wants to hire a separate company to collect millions in grant overpayments. 
The contractor, ICF International of Fairfax, Va., revealed the extent of the over­payment<; when it issued a March 11 request for bids from compa­nies willing to handle "approxi­mately 1 ,000 to 5,000 cases that will necessitate collection effort." 
The bid invitation said: "The average amount to be collected is estimated to be approximately $35,000, but in some cases may be as high as $100,000 to $150,000." 
The biggest grant amount allowed by the Road Home pro­gram is $150,000, so ICF believes it paid some recipients the maxi­mum when they should not have received a penny. If ICF"s highest estimate of 5,000 collection cases -overpaid by an average of $35.000 -proves to be true, that means applicants will have to pay back a total of $175 mil­lion. 
One-third of qualified appli­cants for Road Home help had yet to receive any rebuilding check as of this past week. The program, which has come to symbolize the lurching Katrina recovery effort, is financed by $11 billion in federal funds. 
ICF spokeswoman Gentry Brann said in an e-mail Friday that the overpayments are the inevitable result of the Road Home grant being recalculated to account for insurance money and government aid given to Katrina victims. 
Brann said there was a sense of urgency in paying Road Home applicants, and ICF and the state knew applicants would have to return some money. 
"The choice was either to process grants immediately or wait until the March 2008 dead­line (for submitting Road Home applications) before disbursing any funds," Brann said in her e­mail. 
Brann pointed out that 5,000 collections cases would represent a 4-percent error rate for the Road Home that is "quite good for large federal programs." 
Frank Silvestri, co-chair of the Citizen"s Road Home Action Team, a group that formed out of frustrations with ICF, sees it far differently. 
"They want people to pay for their incompetence and their mistakes. What they need to be is aggressive about finding the underpayments," he said. "People relied, to their detriment, on their (ICFs) expertise and rebuilt their houses and now they want to squeeze this money back out of them." 
The prospect of Road Home grant collections comes less than t.wo weeks after the Louisiana inspector general and the legisla­tive auditor said they were inves­tigating why former Gov. Kathleen Blanco paid ICF an extra $156 million in her waning days in office to administer the program. With the increase, ICF stands to earn $912 million to run Road Home, a contract that also sweetened its initial public stock offering, and helped it buy out four other companies. It now reaches into government con­tracting sectors that include national defense and the environ­ment. 

Paul Rainwater, executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, the state body that asked for the Blanco­ICF investigations, acknowledged the collections could be painful for applicants, many of whom have used up their nest eggs to rebuild. 
"The state must walk a fine line of treating homeowners who have been overpaid with fairness and compassion and ensuring that all federal funds are used for their intended purpose," said Rainwater, an appointee of new Gov. Bobby Jindal. 
Upon receiving money from Road Hom11, grantees sign a batch of forms, including one that says they must refund any overpayments. 
Melanie Ehrlich, co-chair of Citizen"s Road Home Action Team, which has documented Road Home cases that appear lit­tered with mistakes, said she had no confidence that ICF had cor­rectly calculated overpayments. She charged that the company was more likely using collections as retribution against people who had appealed their award amounts in effort to get the aid they deserved. 

Officials cope with ballot shortage 
Associated Press 
It"s a simple question with no simple answer: Why do polling places across America keep running out of ballots when it''s no secret that this contentious primary season keeps breaking voter turnout records? 
For one, even the best-made plans have gone awry; officials in state after state have ordered more ballots, only to see turnouts exceed their most ambitious estimates. 
Some states -California, for example -extended registra­tion deadlines, in part to give would-be voters more time to sign up for the first Democratic presidential nomination race between a black man and a woman. 
But some election officials say those exten­sions have ages. 
"If you run out of ballots," said the Election Center"s Lewis, "God help you." 
Lawrence Haake, general registrar of Virginia"s Chesterfield County, outside Richmond, well knows that sen­timent. His was the state"s only county to run out of ballots on Feb. 12. Since then, he has been vilified by critics who say he mismanaged the primary and failed to heed warning signs from other states where polling places were deluged by turnout that reached as high as 80 percent. 
"I"ve been called everything but a Christian, which I am," said Haake. "This county has a pitiful, pitiful history of voter turnout. I thought I"d ordered enough to cover." 
He hadn"t. More 
than 38,000

printing is a highly spe­cialized field with a limited number of companies willing to take on the heavily monitored and time-consuming burden of producing and delivering voting cards. Price per ballot can range from .?0 cents to more than $1, depending on com­plexity. Lead times for printing can range from months to weeks to days, depending on circumstances, including the proximity of Election Day. 
So with Pennsylvania"s important April 22 primary looming, and nine other state nominating contests scheduled for May, election activists won­der if even more voters could be subject to huge lines and disen­franchisement caused by an insufficient supply of ballots. 
"We"re going to keep having this problem," said Doug Lewis, director of the Election Center, which represents voting oflicials across the country. "Running an election sounds pretty simple until you try to do it. Folks just don"t understand how much advance planning goes into set­ting this up. 
"If you run out of ballots, it''s because your crystal ball isn"t good enough," Lewis said. "Every time you cut the time between the voter registration deadline and the election, you seve~ely impact the voting sys­tem. 
California discovered that on 
Super Tuesday, Feb. 5, when massive numbers swarmed the polls and record-setting votes were cast by mail. In the Bay Area, ballots ran out. State offi­cials, who had closed registra­tion rolls only two weeks before, were admittedly not ·prepared for such a surge and were still counting ballots weeks later. California"s vote 
was certified March 15. 
On March 4, precincts in Texas and trouble-prone Ohio ran out of ballots, too. In Cuyahoga County, home to Cleveland, Barack Obama"s campaign obtained a federal court order to keep polling places open an extra 90 min­utes because of ballot short-ahead in opinion 
polls, was very low in comparison-about 23,000 votes. 
Despite his disbelief, Haake said he did increase his Democratic ballot orders ­from 30,000 in January to 42,000 in February after nerv­ously eyeing Super Tuesday contests in 24 states. VIrginia is an open primary state, meaning registered Democrats can vote a GOP ballot, and vice versa. 
"I had no way of knowing which way they"d vote," Haake said. He thinks he understands what happened: After distant­ser.ond GOP candidate Mitt Romney withdrew right before the primary, "the Republicans came in and voted Democratic," just to have some influence in the overall nominating process, he said. 
Nine precincts ran out of bal­lots. "We had enough, we just didn"t have them in the right places," he said. 
Haake printed more ballots in his office and sent them out. But some people couldn"t wait for delivery. Those voters were allowed to leave paper slips indicating their preference, but the state disqualified those slips. 
Haake said he"s learned his lesson. For November"s general election, he"s ordering 110 per­cent of the voter registration total. "We"re going to have enough ballots even if every­body on the rolls shows up," he said. 
Candice Hoke, an elections monitor and Cleveland State University professor, said some states, including North Carolina -where the primary is May 6 -require that ballot numbers reflect 101 percent of the regis­tered voter total. But many states have no such require­ments. 
Also, she said, most county government<; across the country have experienced some form of cutbacks. "Printing up hun­dreds of thousands of ballots, just to junk them afterward, is not something a county wants to r,arry. Budgets are being cut. Costs are being cut."

I sometimes wonder if' the proposal for Eddy Street Commons really is going to create the "college town" atmosphere it's supposed to. After all, the centerpieec1s of thn dcwelopment an~ supposedly the two hotels and the eondominiums in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, which most peo­ple here don't r11ally nPnd and proba­bly can't afford -unless the goal of' the developing company is to try and recreate the Granger experience dos­er to campus. 
But questionable residential choices aside, it seems that the real potential for creating that collegc1 town feel is in its retail sector. And the corner­stone of any college town is its book­store. Of course, Notre Dame already has the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore, and by all accounts it's doing quite well for itself. After all, it just put up that billboard right up the road from Barnes & Noble on Grape and it's expanding its southern wing so that it will soon have over 2,500 more square feet, which will be used to create dedicated space for, among other things, Steiner Sports Marketing & Memorabilia Inc., Adidas apparel, a gelato machine and pretzel bar for the cafe. · Now, this might be an outdated con­cept, but I was under the impression that bookstores were supposed to mostly sell books rather than mer­chandise. Hight now, it seems like the area of Hammes dedicated to books is roughly equal to that dedicated to apparel, merchandise, and other non­bookish things. Granted, the expan­
sion will free up another 1,000 square feet in the textbook area (which is only fully stockPd for a fc1w weeks every term), but once it's com­plete, it will be hard to make the ease that Hammes isn't a giant gift store with a book section attached. Aft0r all, the bookstore has demonstrated that their primary goal is making a killing off of merchandise and over­priced coursepacks Uust to take an example from personal experience, charging $35 for a 100-page packet of bibliographical information that was not under copyright). And now Hammes (whose parent company is Follett, an international corporation with annual revenues of $2.3 billion) has also expressed interested in opening up a bookstore in the Eddy Street development. 
I'm not trying to engage in shrill anti-corporate hysteria or demanding that we transplant Powell's from Portland or The Strand from New York (although Powell's does have branches in Chicago-maybe they'd be open to one in South Bend, too). Instead, I'm just trying to make sense of the fact that in the University's bookstore, there are shelves of Notre Dame rugs and beer steins alongside cases of signed football helmets and babydoll Ts with "Notre Dame" in that faded baseball-jersey font in such school colors as pink and sky blue, but no sections for used, remainder, rare or out-of-print books, a rather stingy buyback policy, no membership or rewards program that I know of, no posted best-selling or prize-winning lists or evnn staff' ree­omnHmdations. The books seetion is well-stoeked and well-organiznd, but still feels steriln and just a little bit negleetnd, and really if someorw wants a no-frills book browsing nxpe­rinnce, they might as well go to Amazon.com. where the solec:tion is larger and you might. evnn get a bit of a price break to make up for the live­day free shipping. As far as book­stores go, Hammes is doing the Tehotehke's-from-OfTien-Spaee bare minimum in terms of, wnll, pieces of flair. 
There's nothing wrong with selling sehool merchandise and memorabilia. What would be nice, however, is that we get a bookstore where you actual­ly want to spend time browsing and reading, one that makes you want to come back to it and not just to go once a term for your required text­books. If Hammes or its parent com­pany can shift gears from trying to make our collective wallets a little lighter to actually setting up a good bookstore, then it wouldn't be so bad to have them in Eddy Street Commons. But if not, the space should go to an independent retailer, or at least someone who dedieates more floor space to books than to footballs.

Tomatoes give a new perspective to Easter 
Every Lent, I am struck by the fact that at places like Notre Dame we have to remind ourselves of the suf­fering of Christ on llis way to the cross when there are people who identify most with 
Christ's suffering Laura Bradley every single day of the year. Guest Column 
This spring break, I went on the Migrant Seminar, spon­sored by the Center for Social Concerns, to Immokalee, Florida. The main industry is agriculture and the main crop is the tomato. The farm workers, who are the backbone of our society, do not have to set aside a spe­cific time in their liturgical calendar to reflect on suffering -they suffer every day. living under the poverty line. 
In Immokalee, I encountered the worst poverty I have ever seen in the US. The normal living condition is 15 men living in a tiny, rat and roach­infested trailer, for which they pay $1600 a month. I stayed in one of these trailers for a night with a family of three and I cannot even imagine how 15 people sleep in one. 
The conditions in the fields are even worse. Farm workers wake up at 4 a.m. so they have time to walk to a parking lot where they will be picked up to be bussed to the fields. There is no guarantee anyone will get work, so they must get to the parking lot as early as possible. When the workers get to the fields, they may have to wait up to three hours because they cannot start picking any tomatoes until they are completely dry. They are not paid for this period of waiting. The workers must pick the tomatoes as quickly as possible, as they are paid by the buck­et. For each 32-pound bucket, they are paid 40-45 cents. In order to make Florida's minimum wage, they must pick 2 tons of tomatoes each day. This kind of pace is impossible for an entire workday. After more than 12 hours from when they were picked up, the workers return home to sleep so they can wake up and do it all over again. This is their life. 
Through this seminar, we got the chance to work in the fields alongside some of the farm workers. We only worked for three hours and we were exhausted by the end of it. This was the most intense, backbreaking work I have ever done in my life and it was even worse with the sun beating down on us in the humid 80-degree Florida 

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Rethink SAO 

Cancer Efforts Impeded Relay for Life is a national event sponsored by the American Cancer Society that was established as an event to bring people together to celebrate those who have survived cancer and remember those who have lost the battle. It is a community event that serves not only to raise money for cancer research but also fosters hope in those affected by the dis­ease, both for victims and their loved ones. 
In the past, this event here at Notre Dame has been primarily run by facul­ty. This year we have formed a student committee in the attempt to gain more student involvement and excitement about the event, as so many students are affected by this disease. However, in our attempts to make this a more stu­dent-oriented event, we have hit several road blocks. Many Notre Dame stu­dents are familiar with the difficulties of dealing with the Student Activities Office (SAO) and Student Affairs. We understand that these particular offices exist for the regulation of student clubs on campus, but an office so unwilling to give any leeway to this, a national event as opposed a student club event, seems to us to be more of a hindrance to students than a help. A few weeks ago, SAO halted our efforts of selling T-shirts to fundraise and advertise Relay on the grounds that they did not have a club name on them. 
Another problem we have encountered is that, since Relay is an event that lasts throughout the entire night, every Relay around the country has tents for people to rest in. However, the vice president of student affairs banned the use of camping tents at Relay because of parietals. We would like to know why Habitat for Humanity's Shack City is allowed to take place, with students ofboth genders sleeping in enclosed cardboard shacks for the entire night. Shack City is also a national event which has been allowed to take place in its intended form here at Notre Dame. Why not Relay for Life? We do not under­stand the inconsistent policy or SAO's lack of leniency toward this national event. 
We feel that Student Affairs and SAO should reevaluate their policies. We understand that it is important to regulate student events; however, perhaps the various University offices should reflect on the true purpose of each of their policies. Why is it so important, for example, that a club name be on aT­shirt?

heat. Everyone had to wear long sleeves, pants and heavy work boots to protect us from the pesticides. We talked to some of the workers after­wards and most told us that they had dropped out of school and had begun working in the fields when they were 13 or 14 years old. Can you imagine starting this work at age 13, knowing that the only way to survive would be to do this every day of your life for the next 50 years or more? 
This problem may seem far removed from our daily lives, but really, we are intimately connected to the farm workers of America. Have you ever thought about why your food at fast food restaurants or grocery stores is so cheap? Our agricultural system is able to keep the prices down because in giving us the cheap food we desire, businesses cut down on the wages of the farm workers -their wages have not increased in 30 years. We as con­sumers have the power (and the responsibility) to make sure the farm workers are given the wages that they deserve. We all ignore this systematic problem because we want our food cheap and we don't care how we get it. 
As consumers, Christians and (most 
importantly) people, we have a choice to make. We must decide if the food we eat or the people who pick the food are more important. 
After seeing the effects of my deci­sions as a consumer (unjust wages, inhumane working and living condi­tions, extreme poverty), I cannot sim­ply be a passive consumer and give into the system anymore and I chal­lenge you to do the same. We need to look beyond the brand names and the slogans and open our eyes to the injustices of the agricultural business. We must recognize the role we play in this unjust business every day. 
Let us remember the farm workers who carry Christ's cross every day as they work in the fields in the hot sun to provide us all with the cheap food we so covet, getting nothing but ridicule and degradation in return.

A statement of protest 
Many of you have heard about the walk-out protest that occurred at the opening performance of this year's production of Eve Ensler's "The Vagina Monologues." Being that our statement has not been accurately represented in The Observer thus far, I, independent of my fellow protesters and objectors to the play's presence on campus, would like to take this opportunity to clarify our inten­tions to you. The following is a reprint of the statement we left in our seats following our Mar. 26 departure from the Monologues. I hope that this might help you to understand our reason for our actions and, ifnot, I wish you my very best in your academic and personal quest for truth. 
A Statement of Protest 
We have chosen to attend, and immediately depart from, this performance of "The Vagina Monologues" in order to protest its performance on campus for seven out of the past eight years. We sincerely hope that this will be the last time. 
The argument back and forth is interminable and we feel no need to give one more explanation of why we hold this play's annual performance at Notre Dame to be unacceptable; as a Catholic University, the instruction of the local bishop on issues of faith and morals ought to be sufficient, all the more so when it has been so thoroughly explained (see http://www.diocesefwsb.orgtCOMMUNI­CATIONS/statements.htm). 
Rather, we are leaving this statement in our empty seats in order to clarify the intent of our protest. We mean no disrespect to our fellow students who have chosen to perform this play, nor to those others who have come to attend it. For this reason, we have sought to minimize the disrup­tiveness of our protest. Yet we feel compelled to visibly demonstrate our opposition to the play­because it in turn shows such disrespect for the true nature and dignity of woman. 
Our Lady's University can do better than this. It is particularly upsetting that the play's perform­ance has been scheduled during Easter Week, the central focus ofthe liturgical year. We have been told that this timing occurred not at the request of the student organizers, but at the particu­lar instruction of the administration. It encourages us to learn that our fellow students were not seeking to deliberately antagonize the rest of the community in this way-but all the more causes us to question the prudence of those of our University's leaders who have been responsible for making a string of decisions in open defiance of Bishop D'Arcy. 
Upon leaving the play, we are headed as a group to the Grotto, where we will pray for the stu­dents, faculty and administration of the University of Notre Dame, and particularly that our institu­tional participation in such a demeaning cultural fad will come to an end. As loyal sons and daugh­ters of Our Lady, we are confident that she will hear our prayer.

Support for troops requires support for war effort 
Countless people seem to believe that it is possible to effort? Clearly, war protesters call for immediate pullout are hoping to see our troops fall short of their goals. support our troops in Iraq without supporting the war of Iraq, but an immediate pullout would not give troops Support for a person requires desire for their success. effort.

On Saturday, SUB brought the comedic stylings of Mindy Kaling and Craig Hobinson, better known as Kelly Kapoor and Darryl Philbin from the hit comedy series "The Office" to Washington Hall. 
Kaling. who has appeared in the films 
Caitlin Ferraro 
"License to Wed," 
"Unaccompanied 
Scene & Heard
Minors" and the "40 Year Old Virgin," began the show with 
.. a bang by joking about a recent Observer head­line involving "The Vagina Monologues." Kaling is also a writer and producer for the show and this lnd to severaljokes about boredom during the writers' strike. She poked fun at perezhilton.com and the Megan's Law Web site. Kaling's character Kelly is known for her high­pitched and annoying voice, but this made her pretty atrocious impression of deep-voiced actresses Scarlett Johansson and Julia Stiles even better. Just to mix things up, Kaling made an 'impromptu' phone call to B.J. Novak, a fellow writer, and portrayer of her on-screen ex­boyfriend, Hyan Howard. While I may have been wishing it was going to be Steve Carrell or Jim Krasinski on the other end. Novak amped up the <Towel by reminding them that he will be coming April 12 to perform at Notre Dame. Novak kept asking to speak to Craig Hobinson, who joined Kaling on stage. After missing out on Novak's joke beeause of bad Blackberry reception. (Novak was attempting to say, "Battl~red women. Sounds delicious") Kaling finished up her bit and it was time for Hobinson. Hobinson. whose character Darryl works in the warehouse of Dunder Mil'l1in, came out sporting an Notre Dame T-shirt and immediately began working the crowd. For a while, Hobinson was silent. only adoptly working his keyboard when he began playing "If You're Happy and You Know it ... " lie finally broke his silence when tlw audience failed at the song. breaking into a wild grimace and exclaiming, "It's stomp your feet [mother ... ]." lie made a lengthy joke about how every song should include the phrase "take ofT your panties," and got the entire crowd to sing along to some favorites. lie also shared his distaste for Barry White, because he makes everything sound so sexy. Women. he said, get the best of 

everything including walking down the aisle all 
by themselves with a special song, "The 
Wedding March." However, he said during that 
part of the ceremony. all the groom hears is 
funeral music. Instead. he said when he gets 
married he will walk down the aisle to "Eye of 
the Tiger." And he 'revealed' to the crowd that 
every man hears the intro music for Michael 
Jordan before making love. Hobinson's use of 
audience interaction was excellent and he even 
astutely pointed out that the guards at Notre 
Dame take their jobs "way too seriously." 
Following Hobinson's bit, Kaling rejoined him onstage for a Q&A. While I thought many of the questions were a bit pointless, some interesting information was learned about the show, and two girls even got up on stage and asked the stars to sign their T-shirts, which sported "Office" slogans. Kaling called the remaining six episodes of this season "the best yet" because the action from what should have been 10 to 12 episodes had to be packed into half that amount. She also noted that Angela Kinsey (who plays Angela) was hiding her real-life pregnancy by always holding her purse in front of her, making her look like "a leprechaun hoarding her gold." 
Kaling and Hobinson seemed down to earth as they discussed the joy they got from watching "The Ofiice" episodes on airplane flights. They seemed genuinely pleased and proud of their work. Robinson said his favorite episode was "The Coup," in which Michael gets in trouble once again as Jan busts him for declaring it's "Movie Monday," allowing everyone to watch a movie and neglect work. Subsequently, Angela pushes Dwight to make a move on Michael's j Hobinson laughed about the confrontational scene in which Michael and Dwight come face face. Kaling said it was difficult for her to pick just one episode but loves "Booze Cruise" and basically "every episode [she is] in." 
Overall, the duo was a riot. I look forward to seeing Hobinson in the film "Pineapple Express" out in August starring James Franco and Seth Hogen. And be sure to catch the next part of "The Office Comedy Series" with B.J. Novak April 12 to join in on the Dunder Milnin fun.

"That means a lot to us," 
Chalmers said. "It makes us part 
of history. We wanted to come in 
hnm and be part of history and 
be part of our first Final Four, 
and we was able to do that 
tonight." 

The win also rids Self of that 
dreaded "best coach never to 
make a Final Four" label. Self 
had fallen short with three dif­
ferent schools, including last 
year's edition of the Jayhawks. 
But this year's bunch had too 
much talent, depth and experi­
ence to be denied. 
"It feels good just for him," said Brandon Rush, who scored eight of his 12 points in the sec­ond half. "He's been stuek in the Elite 8 for the last few years. This feels good just to make that push into the Final Four for him." 
Curry, who became only the fourth player to hit the 30-point mark in his first four NCAA tournament games, finished with 25 on 9-of-25 shooting and was picked Most Outstanding Player of the Midwest Hegional. His roommate, Bryant Barr, was the only other Davidson player in double figures, seoring all 11 of his points in the second half. 
The loss snapped Davidson's 25-game winning streak, longest in the nation. 
"The agony of this is that we came so far," Davidson coach Bob McKillop said. "We've seen and touched our dream, and we missed. We came two points away from the Final Four with a 1,700-student school in the Southern Conference." 
Memphis 85, Texas 67 
The freshman from Chicago who wears No. 23 and soars all over the court just finished get­ting Memphis into the Final Four when fans began chanting "One more year!" 
Then Derrick Rose picked up his South Hegional MVP award, clipped a piece of the net and called his mom to share the moment. He kept it brief, though, because he didn't want his teammates to see him ery. 
It might be the only thing they've never seen him do. 
Driving, dishing and dunking, going above the rim for rebounds and flying around to block shots, Hose led Memphis past Texas Sunday for its first trip to the Final Four since 1985. 
''I'm just living the dream right now," said Hose, who finished with 21 points, nine assists and six rebounds. "Everybody back home happy for me and our fans back in Memphis are happy, so we're just living it up." 
They should. 


The Tigers tied the NCAA Division I record for wins in a season, with their only loss com­ing to a team ranked No. 2 at the time. They've been first, sec­ond or third in the poll all sea­son. And to all the people who keep saying they'd be the first No. 1 seed to lose, leading scor­er Chris Douglas-Roberts can say, "See you in San Antonio." 
''I'm not sure if we'll get the respect we deserve, but if we don't, it doesn't matter," Douglas-Robert said. "It's four teams left now." 
Memphis will play UCLA and its freshman phenom, Kevin Love. The Tigers and Bruins have a nice little history, having met in a regional final two years ago and in the 1973 title game. 
Memphis has only been back to the Final Four once, with Keith Lee leading the way in 1985. But that trip was vaeated according to the NCAA record book because of rules violations. Ditto for the only other time John Calipari coached a team to the Final Four, UMass in 1996. 
This March, Memphis has treated the NCAA field like it a continuation of Conference USA play. This 18-point finish was the second-dosest final margin. 
"We just try to go out there and prove everyone wrong," said bruising big man Joey Dorsey, who had 11 points and 12 rebounds. 
The Tigers were a win away from the final weekend of the NCAA tournament each of the last two years, but couldn't get over the hump. Then again, Dean Smith never won a title at North Carolina until that other No. 23 came along, Miehael Jordan. 
Calipari even compared Hose to another icon of greatness, Tiger Woods. Actually, Calipari brought it up last weekend, when he passed along an artiele about Woods to Hose, telling him, "This is who I believe you can be, physieally, skill-wisn." 
"He's got to improve, got to get on the range a little bit and get that stroke right, but he also has the mental capacity and the mental toughness and the intelli­gence to be unique and special. And it sets him apart," Calipari said. 
"lie's been that way since we got him, so it's nothing I've done with him. lie just has a will to win. It may be with a defensive stop. It may bn with a rebound that he nieked his head on the rim as he went to get it. It may be outrunning the entire field when he started behind every­body. It may be a steal, a dive, a tip out of nowhere, and then again it may be a drive, baseline and dunk on their team."

lin was the right guy -thn only guy -to takn thn biggnst shot of th11 NCAA tournament. 
But thern wasn't one. All he could do was the pass the ball and watch as Jason Richards' dnsp11ration try thudded oil' the backboard. 
Davidson was done. Kansas was in. 
"It hurts a lot to get this far, be so dose to get to the Final Four," Curry said after top-seeded Kansas held off little Davidson 59-57 Sunday. 
The .layhawks' win in the Midwest Hegional final sent all four No. 1 seeds to the Final Four for the first time. 
''I'm definitely proud of what wn've accomplished and what wn're about and \\hat we've just proven all year," Curry said. " ... But it's going to hurt. This game's going to hurt a lot for the nnxt however long." 
Curry, the. son of former NBA sharpshooter Dell Curry, had made the tournament his own little party, scoring at will with his silky-smooth shot and carry­ing Davidson to one improbable victory after another. He looked as if he might do it again, drilling a 3-pointer from NBA range to cut Kansas' lead to 59­57 with 54 seeonds left. 
Aftnr Kansas' Sherron Collins missed with 21 SIN~onds left. the 1Oth-seeded Wildeats got one last chancn. 
And of course t.he 
ball to Curry. 
"Kansas had four guards out there and they just switched. It kind of defeated tiHl purpose of the play," he said. "I gave them a pump fake to try to get a look, but I was off-balance when he fell down. So I saw Jay open at the top of the key, so I swung it to him." 
But Hichards was off-balance 
a bit -just enough to send 
make it dang rather than swish. 
"I kind of had a feeling in my heart that it wasn't going in because the way he shot it. It looked like he was leaning to the left a little bit," Kansas guard Mario Chalmers said. "When I turned back, I saw it hit the baekboard. I was just relieved." 
Hiehards dropped to his back at midcourt while the Jayhawks celebrated with a measure of relief. 
"Trust me, I was on both knees," Kansas coach Bill Self said. "You picture the way you win a big game like that, it would be you make a shot, you celebrate or something happens and you're able to go congratu­late all your coaches and play­ers. This was not one of those deals. I just wanted to make sun1 that I hurried up and shook hands and the offieials left the eourt so they couldn't put any time back on the cloek." 
Kansas (35-3) moved on to play overall No. 1 seed North Carolina -and former coach Hoy Williams -on Saturday, and UCLA and Memphis will round out the party at the Alamodome in San Antonio. 
Three No. 1s have advanced three times, most recently in 1999.

Lady Vols' 74-64 win over Notre Dame in the NCAA Sweet Sixteon Sunday. 
But thn Irish never planned to try and eomplo~tely shut down Parker. They knew they couldn't and instead they focused on defending the thrne. 
"We were trying to guard the 3-point line and we didn't rnal­ly think that [Parker! would got that many because we didn't want to guard her inside," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "But we did a nice job in the first half of guarding the :3­point line. I was really pleased with that at half time." 
Defending the three worked for the Irish in the first half­they kept the Lady Vols to 1­for-5 from the are to enter the locker room with the 33-31 lead. 
"We felt great [going into the seeond half!. we felt that we could play with them. We believed in each other we believed in ourselves," Irish senior guard Chand Allen from beyond the are weren't enough for the Irish defense could contain. Tennessee found another force in senior center Nicky Anosike. It seemed as though every time Notre Dame's defense denied Parker the layup, Anosike answered with a jumper from the paint. Anosike had for 10 points and 10 rebounds. 
The Irish squad refused to back down, nearly matching the Lady Vols in rebounds. (Tennessee grabbed 45 to Notre Dame's 421. Notre Dame pulled down 11 offensive boards and 31 defensive boards in comparison with Tennessee's 14 and 31. 
Evon with Notre Dame thrf1atening at the end of the first half, Tennessee never lost its composure -that speaks to the team's experience. 
"This team is full of seniors. We've been in the same posi­tions that we've been in before," Parker said. "Against North Carolina we were down by 12 with eight minutes to go. There's no panic, we just come together, figure out what's bro­ken. and fix it."

"She's willing to step up and make the plays for us. She's obviously talented enough and has the size inside to make the type or plays that obviously you have to have at certain moments." 
It was Tennessee's ability to remain composed that allowed it to stay in the game. Once Bobbitt started hitting the three in the second half and the rest or the Lady Vols offense responded, there was no looking back. 
The Irish just eouldn't stop Parker from reaching over the top and continuing to put it away.

bold strategy, Cotton. 
Tennessee's ball movement was too quick for the Irish guards, who had either stepped inside to lend a hand in taming Parker or col­lapsed on Anosike at the top of the key, to get outside and get a hand in the shooter's face. 
The irony is, Notre Dame's offense played well against a bigger, more athletic Tennessee team. Four play­ers scored double ligures. Bruszewski tied a career high with 16 points. Guard Lindsay Schrader had 13 points and nine rebounds. The stats are similar between the two teams. Tennessee had 45 boards to Notre Dame's 42. The Irish shot 39.7-percent on the game; Tennessee hit an even 40-percent. 
But the reason the Lady Vols advance to faee Texas A&M and Notre Dame heads home lies in the versatility of Tennessee's offense. The Lady Vols played like a llydra -cut off one source of points, and two more quiekly appear in its place.

it couldn't stem the Lady Vols' offensive flow. 
The simpleton could attrib­ute Tennessee's performance to Lady Vols forward Candace Parker, who ripped through Notre Dame's defense like the tornadoes thatswirled around Oklahoma City during the game. She tied a career high with 34 points and had 13 boards, four blocks, three shots." 
Notre Dame had no one to match up with Parker 1-on-1 in the post. Parker, at 6-foot­4, has three inches on Irish forward Becca Bruszewski, who played the majority of the game in the post after center Erica Williamson ran into foul trouble. So rather than let her drop 60, the Irish would collapse on Parker and leave Anosike open at the free throw line. Instead of forcing the shot, Parker would dish to Anosike, who would sink the 
15-foot jumper. 
She finished 

however, it was what Parker didn't do that boosted Tennessee above the Irish, and that's how Notre Dame found itself in a three-way Catch-22. 
The Lady Vols have scorers all over the floor. Against Notre Dame's zone defense, they put Parker on the post, center Nicky Anosike at the top of the key and guards Alexis Hornbuckle and Shannon Bobbitt out on the perimeter. Cover the wings and Anosike near the foul line, and Parker gets the feed down low for the easy bucket -of which she got many. 
"I did not feel like she could be stopped in there unless they wanted to dou­ble-team her," Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said. "She did a great job of establish­ing position and finishing Anosike's effec­
tiveness from the key, but Anosike kept making the shots. 

"We were giving them to her at the beginning of the game, and then she started making them and I thought, we're gonna have to change defenses to be able to guard her at the high post, and so I went to the 1-3-1 for that," McGraw said. 
The 1-3-1 zone, McGraw said, had the drawback of leaving a smaller defender at the low post to deal with Parker. McGraw recognized the relative futility of plan­ning to stop Parker in the post. 
"Parker, she's gonna score no matter what defense you're in when she's on the block," McGraw said. "She's a tough match-up inside with her size."

Saint Mary's ran into a speed bump this weekend in its pursuit of a qualifying for a spot in the Div. III National Championship Tournament. 
The Belles finished 16th out of 21 teams at the Northern Kentucky Spring Invitational tournament this weekend in Perry Park, Ky.

Irish earn split, snap Blue De111ons' streak 

TIM SULLIVANffhe Observer Junior pitcher Brittany Bargar pitches in last season's matchup against Ball State. Bargar pitched in both games Sunday. 
By SAM WERNER Sports Writer 
Behind strong pitching per­formances from freshman Jody Valdivia and junior Brittany Bargar, the Irish split a doubleheader with 17th-ranked DePaul and ended the Blue Demons' 25­game conference winning streak. 
"I think taking one from DePaul is always a good win" Notre Dame coach Deanna Gumpf said. "They're a tough team and we have quite a history with them." 
The Irish nearly managed a sweep of the twinbill, losing the first game on a walkoff single by Jackie Tarulli­Fisher. Two errors in the final inning spelled doom for the Irish. The fielding woes were especially frustrating for Gumpf, who has been try­ing to stress the importance of defense to her team this season.

despite allowing only four hits over 6 and 2/3 innings and allowing no earned runs while striking out 12. 
In the second game, Notre Dame was determined to give its pitching more sup­port. Linda Kohan crushed a solo home run to center field in the top of the second to put the Irish up 1-0. Notre Dame added an unearned run in the fourth, and a 2-0 lead was all Valdivia needed. The freshman struck out three in 5 and 2/3 innings to get the win, and Bargar pitched the final 1 and 1/3 for her first save of the sea­son. The biggest stat from the second game for Gumpf, though, was that the Irish defense made no errors in the field. 
"We really picked it up," Gumpf said. ''I'm really proud of the way the girls bounced back." 
The Irish (17-10 overall, 1­1 Big East) will play at home against Ball State Tuesday.

Notre Dame jumpstarted the outdoor season in a big way this weekend by grab­bing seven top-three finish­es at the Arizona State Invitational meet this week­end in Tempe, Ariz. 
Senior Brienne Davis turned in the best perform­ance for the Irish by handi­ly winning the 100-meter dash and taking third in the 200-meter dash. 
Junior Alyissa Hasan also had a great meet for the Irish taking third in the 100-meter hurdles to go along with her 14th place finishes in the 200-meter dash and the javelin throw. Hasan's time of 13.91 sec­onds in the 100-meter hur­dles was enough to qualify her for the NCAA regional meet at the end of the year. 
The Irish 4-by-400-meter relay team took first place at the meet and also quali­fied for the NCAA regional meet. Members of the relay team also found success in other events. Sophomore Joanna Schultz, freshman c·ora Dayon, and senior Crysta Swayzer finished second, sixth and eighth­place respectively in the 400-meter dash event. 
Freshmen Kelly Langhans and Natalie Johnson fin­ished second and third­place respectfully in the 800-meter run rounding out an outstanding perform­ance by the Irish. 
Next weekend, Notre Dame will send athletes to both the Stanford and Purdue Invitationals.

On Saturday morning, the first event for the Irish was the 400­meter dash, with freshman Miklos Szebeny and junior Billy Buzaid finishing seventh and tenth, respectively. Senior Austin Wechter followed with an impres­sive finish in the 400-intermediate hurdles. With a time of 53.72 sec­onds, Wechter's time ranks in the top four in all of the Big East. The 4-by-400-meter relay consisting of Szebeny, Wechter, Buzaid and sophomore Balazs Molnar ran to fourth place with a time of 
3:13.57. Their time is ranked third, following close behind Rutgers and Seton Hall University.

Team loses fourth in a row 
By MIKE GOTIMER Sports Writer 
No. 27 Notre Dame found itself overmatched against No. 2 Ohio State Friday, and the Buckeyes defeated the Irish 6-1 at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. The loss was Notre Damn's fourth straight and only the second at home this season. 
Ohio State got on the board first with a win in the dou­bles point. The Buckeyes then went on to win the first set in all six singles matches, and the Irish could not recover. 
The Notre Dame pair of senior Sheeva Parbhu and junior Brett Helgeson regis­tered a 9-7 win over the No. 25-ranked Buckeyes pair of sophomore Mike O'Connell and freshman Matt Allare. 
The Buckeyes earned their first singles point with a win at the No.1 spot from junior Bryan Koniecko, who defeat­ed Helgeson in straight sets, 6-4, 6-2. Helgeson looked good early and jumped out to a 4-2 lead in the first set, but then lost 10 of the next 12 games to drop the match. 
Ohio State increased its lead to 3-0 as 27th ranked Buckeye junior Steven Moneke defeated 83th ranked Parbhu 6-3, 6-4. With the loss, Parbhu fell to 21-10 on the season and 5-6 against ranked opponents. 
The Buckeyes clinched the match at the No.3 spot as 19th ranked sophomore Justin Kronauge defeated Irish senior Andrew Roth in straight sets, 6-2, 7-6 (4). Roth was competitive in the second set and had an early 2-1 lead, but he dropped four of the next five games en route to the loss. Roth fell to 8-14 on the season with the loss. 
At the No. 5 position, Irish freshman David Anderson fell into an early hole against Ohio State freshman Balazs Novak and could not recover, as he dropped the first set 6­1 fell 6-4 in the second set. Anderson was in a 4-1 hole early in the second set, but he closed the gap to one at 4­3 before losing two of the next three games. Anderson's record stands at 15-11 on the season. 
The lone Irish point was 

registered by freshman Daniel Stahl, who pulled off a come from behind win at the No. 6 singles spot. Stahl dropped the first set against O'Connell 7-5 after blowing a 4-1 lead. Stahl took the sec­ond set, 6-3, to even the match, and avoided dropping two match points to win the final set 1-0 (11-9). With the win, Stahl improved to 20-8 on the season. 
Fellow Irish freshman Stephen Havens had a chance to replicate his teammate's feat, but fell in the third set to Buckeye freshman Shuhei Uzawa. After dropping the first set 6-2, Havens rebounded to win the second set 6-3, but dropped the third set 6-4 to fall to 17-15 on the season. 
The loss dropped to Irish to 10-8 on the season while the Buckeyes improved to 19-1. Notre Dame will try to stop the bleeding on Friday against in-state rival Ball State, whom the Irish have defeated in 17 straight con­tests.

Irish extend w-inning streak to six 111atches 

By LORENZO REYES Sports Writer 
For No. 19 Notre Dame, March was an excellent month. 
The third month of the dual match season saw the Irish extend their season­long win streak extended to six at the Eck Tennis Pavilion against in-state rival No. 25 Indiana 6-1. 
Things looked bleak for the Irish early on, with all the Hoosiers doubles pairs get­ting off to an early lead. The Irish made some mid-match adjustments, however, and eventually won the doubles point. 
"Indiana played well early on in the doubles portion," Irish coach Jay Louderback said. "They came out more aggressive than we though they'd be, and they got off to an early lead. They usually hang back and volley a bit more than they did [Sunday]. Our kids hung in there, though and we made some changes and played more aggressive." 
Part of the credit in the doubles come back goes to the No. 1 duo in the nation of senior Brook Buck and junior Kelcy Tefft, who bounced back after some early struggles against Hoosier senior Brianna Williams and freshman Katya Zapadalova to win 8­4. 
The tandem dropped three of the first four games of the match, but rallied to grab six straight, helping them claim the win and improve their record to 27-5. Louderback could tell that his top dou­bles team needed to rebound after losing its first match as the nation's top pair to SMU last week. 
"They started a little slow," Louderback said. "The Indiana pair played well against them early on, but Brook and Kelcy got more aggressive as the match developed. They needed a 'W' after last week, so they took care of business." 
In another tight battle, the sophomore tag team of Colleen Rielley and Cosmina Ciobanu secured the doubles point with a hard-fought vic­tory over Indiana junior Alba Berdala and sophomore Lindsey Stuckey, 8-6. The Irish team seemed to be con­trolling the match at 5-2, but dropped the next three games, allowing the Hoosiers to tie. 
With a 7-6 lead, Rielley and Ciobanu only allowed one point in the game to pro­pel Notre Dame to a 1-0 lead. The pair now is 13-1 on the dual match season, claiming the squad's best winning percentage. 
Stepping in for injured freshman Kristen Rafael, junior Katie Potts and sopho­more Kali Krisik couldn't combine for a win. The duo fell 8-7 to junior Sigrid Fischer and freshman Myriam Sopel, giving the Irish pair their second loss in three matches as a dou­bles team. 
With Notre Dame up 1-0 in the match, the momentum from the doubles point car­ried over to singles play, with the Irish taking five of the six matches, including four in straight sets. 
Ciobanu looked focused in her match against Fischer, ousting her 6-1, 6-1 in con­vincing fashion. The sopho­more improved to 19-15 overall and 8-11 in dual match play. 
Indiana scored its only point of the day, cutting the Irish lead to 2-1 with Stuckey's defeat of Rielley 6­4, 6-2. 
Buck extended her winning streak to six matches with her dominant 6-1. 6-1 win over freshman Charlotte Martin. Her doubles partner, Tefft, looked just as solid, and clinched the Irish victory at 4-1 with her win over Berdala 6-3, 6-0. 
With the win already in hand. Notre Dame still didn't let up. Krisik improved on her team-best singles record, winning 6-3, 6-4 over Williams. The sophomore's mark is now an impressive 25-6, and has taken eight of her past 10 matches. 
Potts finished off the Hoosiers with a 6-4, 0-6, 1-0 (1 0-4) win over Sopel. Potts dropped six games in a row before regaining her compo­sure and claiming the victory in the tiebreak. Notre Dame is clicking on all cylinders and Louderback said the increased quality of perform­ance is due to the right chemistry and pairings in the lineup. 
"We are playing better," Louderback said. "We just have our lineup where it sets the kids who are playing in the right position to win, and it's making all the differ­ence." 
Notre Dame will put its six­game win streak on the line in West Lafayette when it faces Purdue Wednesday, fol­lowed by a contest at Iowa Friday.

BASEBALL 
Notre Dame drops two of three to Bearcats 
By FRAN TOLAN and 
LORENZO REYES 
SportS Writers 
After Notre Dame's Friday 
game with Cincinnati was post­
poned because of rain, the Irish 
and Bearcats played a double­
hnader Saturday and finished up 
their series on Sunday. 
The teams split the double­
hnader before the Beareats won 
the set with a 4-3 win in the rub­
ber match. 
Bearcats 5, Irish~~ 
Irish ace David Phelps threw 
132 pitches but all his efl'ort was 
canceled out by one swing of 
Cameron Satt1~rwhite's bat. The 
Cincinnati right fielder hit a tow­
Pring home run in the eighth 
inning to give the Bearcats the 
lnad for good as Notre Dame fell 
in the first game of Saturday's 
doubleheader. 
Lefthander Dan Osterbroek got 
the complete game win for 
Cincinnati, allowing just two 
earned runs on six hits. Phelps 
took the loss for the Irish despite 
going eight innings and striking 
out three battnrs. 
"lin gave us a ehance to win," 
Schrage said of Phelps. "We 
talked in [the dugout[ and he 
wanted to go back out there in 
t_he ~ighth. I thought he pitehed 
Ime. 
With the game tied 3-3 in the 
eighth, Satterwhite capitalized 
on sloppy defnnsn by the Irish 
and put Cincinnati on top. With 
one out and no runners on base, 
Irish shortstop Brntt Lilley com­
mitted an error on a slow 
grounder off the bat of Tyler 
Goodro. 
"Wn didn't play good defense. We misplayed a ball in [center l'ieldl and misplayed a ball at [shortstop[," Irish coach Dave Schrage said. "When you're fac­ing a guy like Osterbroek, you have to make all the plays." 
After Goodro reached on the 
error, Michael Oby1~ was inserted 
as a pinch runner but simply 
needed to trot around the bases 
after Satterwhite's blast. 
Satterwhite, the next batter, 
pulled an offering from Phelps 
over the trees belhind the left­
field fence to give the Beareats a 
two-run ndgn. 
Notre Dame manufactured a 
first-inning run and jumped out 
to an early lead. After Lilley was 
hit by Osterbrock's first pitch, he 
moved to second on a sacrifice 
bunt by designated hitter David 
Mills and advanced to third on a 
groundout. Junior second base­
man Jen~my Barnes roped a two­
out single up the middle to score 
Lilley and give Notre Dame the 
early edge. 
But in the second inning, Satterwhite knocked in a run on a groundout to tie the contest at 1-1. The game continued in back-and-forth fashion as the Irish scored in the third and Cincinnati pushed a run aeross in the fourth. 
Lilley led ofT the third with a single and Mills reached on an error. The next batter. Irish cen­ter fielder A.J. Pollc1ck, walked to load the bases for Jeremy Barnes. The junior ripped a ground ball right at Bnarcats third baseman Mike Spina, who knoc~ked it down and firm! hvme to cut down Lilley. But the Irish did not come away from the inning nmpty-handed as they scored on a doubl.e play. Ross Brnzovsky followed Barnes with a deep flyout to right-center field that was tracked down by 
Bearcats centerfielder Tony 
Campana. Mills tagged up and 
scored easily from third base but 
Pollock was thrown out as he 
tried to score from second on the 
play. 
"The play that Campana made 
on Brezovsky was huge and then 
the relay to get the guy at the 
plate was big, too, because I 
would send Pollock 10 out of 10 
times," Schrage said. 
In Cincinnati's half of the 
fourth inning, the team again put 
together a rally to tie the score as 
Satterwhite picked up the second 
of his four RBI. Bearcats ·second 
baseman Josh Harrison was hit 
by a pitch and moved to second 
on a wild piteh by Phelps. Later 
in the frame, Satterwhite sent a 
ball over Pollock's head for a 
run-scoring double that tied the 
contest 2-2. 
Thanks to the speed of 
Harrison and some timely hit­
ting, Cincinnati took its first lead 
of the game in the sixth inning. 
Harrison legged out an infield hit 
and stole second and third after 
drawing countless pickoff 
attempts by Phelps. With two 
outs in the frame, Bearcats 
catcher Ryan Baker scorched a 
single into left field to knock in 
!Iarrison and give Cincinnati a 3­
2 advantage. 
It took just one inning for the 
Irish to counter. With one out, 
Lilley was plunked for the third 
time in the game to move just 
two beanings from tying the 
NCAA record. He has been hit 90 
times. 
"It's just like a walk if I can get hit I by a pitehl and get on base to just get things going," Lilley said. "I don't mean to [get hitl but it happens a lot when I'm up there." 
Mills followed Lilley with a see­ing-eye single that bounced off Harrison's glove into shallow right field. Lilley moved to third on the play to bring up Pollock, who lined out to left field but got the ball deep enough to score Lilley and tie the game. 
But Notre Dame could not 
muster another offensive surge 
as Osterbrock retired the Irish in 
order for the last two innings. 
"He's pretty good ... he spotted up pretty well and he changed speeds a lot, and put his fastballs where he wanted them," Lilley said of Osterbrock. "He's tough to hit. I didn't hit him too much, I just got hit a lot." 
Irish 4, Bearcats 3 
Many people have speculated that the ejeetion of a coach can provide motivation for a team. Schrage provided some evidence in support of that claim in Saturday's second game as his early exit preeeded Notre Dame's completion of a 4-3 win over the Bearcats. 
After Irish starter Wade Korpi loaded the bases in the fifth inning, Bearcats left fielder Jamel Scott ripped a single into eenter field to knoek in a run and eut the Notre Dame lead to 3-1. 
Korpi then walked Cincinnati first baseman Kevin Johnson to push across another run. The normally good-natured Schrage, who was visibly irate with the home plate umpire's call, was ejected from the game. 
"I was arguing balls and strikes and should have been thrown out," Schrage said. "You can't argue balls and strikes." 
Korpi responded to the inci­dent by notching a strikeout and flyout to end the inning and leave the Irish with a 3-2 edge. Schrage laughed as he said that "maybe" his ejection "lit a fire under" Korpi. 

Korpi notched his fourth con­secutive win while striking out four and surrendering two unearned runs in 6 and 1/3 innings of work. 
"He picked us up. That's the best way I can put it," Schrage said of Korpi. "He's a senior and he's put together some nice games back-to-hack." 
The Notre Dame offense gave Korpi an early cushion as it put together a two-out rally in the second inning. After Evan Sharpley and Jeremy Barnes were retired, Brezovsky smacked a single to left field and Irish catcher Sean Gaston reached base on an error. Right fielder Billy Boockford knocked in the first run of the game with a slow single to right. Greg Sherry then got a single that produced two runs -albeit thanks to some sloppy defensive play by Cincinnati. Satterwhite mis­played the hit, allowing both Gaston and Boockford to score and put the Irish ahead 3-0. 
The Irish added a run in the sixth inning after Barnes led off by smashing a line drive to the wall for a double, Notre Dame's first extra base hit of the double­header. Barnes moved to third on a wild pitch then scored on a sacrifice fly to center field by Brezovsky. 
The Irish bullpen duo of Steven Mazur and Kyle Weiland finished off the Bearcats and earned Notre Dame a split in the double­header. 
"In the second game, we only had six hits. I'll give our bullpen a Iotta credit and Korpi," Schrage said. "I think that was the key to the second game, shutting them down with good pitching." 
Mazur replaced Korpi in the seventh frame and tossed 1 and 2/3 innings. The righty gave up one run but struck out four and did not surrender a walk. 
When the fire-balling Weiland entered the game in the ninth, the slew of scouts in attendance got their radar guns ready. The junior was unable to record a strikeout but did close out the victory. 
Weiland got his 20th career save, tying the Notre Dame record. He gave up a two-out hit and a walk but eventually quelled Cincinnati's last-gasp rally. Weiland got Dustin Alvey to ground out weakly to end the game. The Irish improved to 13­8-1 overall and 4-1 in Big East play. 
But Schrage said the Irish were lucky to salvage the second game ofthe double-header. 
"I think we were very fortunate to split today," Schrage said. "We didn't do a Iotta things very well [even though] we had been play­ing well [recently[." 
Bearcats 4, Irish 3 

Below a cold and misty sky, Notre Dame's chances to win the series came down to the last play of the game. With the Irish chances of winning looking bleak, the squad mounted a two­out rally that fell just short. 
Bearcat junior Jake Geglein retired the first two batters of the ninth frame, looking to seal the victory and series for Cincinnati. Notre Dame, however, was on a mission to spoil the weekend for its Big East rival. 
Mills delivered a two-out single to get on base. After a Geglein wild pitch allowed the sopho­more to advance to second base, Pollock connected on a check­swing dribbler in the infield.

.Eb... I 
With the game now seemingly over, Bearcat third baseman Spina failed to bare-hand the grounder, allowing the play to stay alive. As Mills approached third base, however, there was a miscommunication between Schrage, who was stationed at third, and the sophomore base runner. Cincinnati shortstop, freshman Chris Peters, adeptly got to the loose ball and fired home to senior catcher Ryan Baker. 
With the game on the line, Baker hauled in the throw and successfully tagged out Mills, ending Irish hopes of a come­from-behind victory to take the series. 
Schrage tried to make sense of the play at the plate, but couldn't eome up with any explanation as to why Mills ran past his sign. 
"I don't know if there was real­ly any confusion," Schrage said. ''I'm not sure why he ran, but he did. I was just yelling 'Right here, right here,' but he just ran right past it. It's a shame the game ended that way, but it did." 
With the close loss, and the pair of defeats to start the con­ference season at home, a cer­tain amount of frustration is building within the team. 
"It's just frustrating that we lost two of three to open confer­ence play at home," Schrage said. "We're in the top-1 0 in the nation in fielding, top in our con­ference in ERA, and seven of our nine batters are hitting over .300, and when you have all that, but don't win games, it gets frus­trating. It tells me that we're not getting our playmakers to step up and get the big hit."

Two third-pPriod goals from Van Guilder and Teddy Huth pro­pelled Notre Dame to a victory over Miehigan State and the first Frozen Four appParance in the program's history. 
II anson put the Irish on the board lirst against the Spartans, scoring 2:43 into the seeond peri­od. llanson skated around the Michigan State net and tried to stuff the puck past Spartans goalie Jell' Lnrg but was unsuc­cessful on his first attempt. On the rebound, though, Hanson man­agnd to sneak the puck bntwPen Lerg's legs and give Notre Dame 1-0 lead. It was Hanson's third goal, and fourth point, of the weekend. 
"Now that he's showing that sign of consisteney, he's a domi­nant player at times," Jackson said of !Janson. 
The Irish lead lasted barely seven minutes, though, as Justin Abelkader evened the score at one at 9:05 of the second period. Abdelkader reeeived a perfect pass from teammate Tim Kennedy at the left eirele and firnd a one-timer past Irish goalie .Jordan Pearce. 
Notre Dame appeared to take the lead 15:54 into the period, when Evan Hankin corralled a rebound in the low slot and, with Lerg out of position, !ired a puck into thn vacant net. But the goal was disallowed after video review showed that Irish forward Knvin Deeth obstructed Lerg. 
"We were real calm on the 


bench just sitting there waiting for the call," Van Guilder said. "Whatever the decision, we had to keep coming. You can't let something like that kill your momentum." 
Even though the second period ended in a 1-1 tie, the Irish seemed to control the momentum heading into the final stanza. 
Finally, at 14:06 of the third period and with overtime loom­ing, Van Guilder scored the goal that would ultimately prove to be the game winner. After defieeting a pass from Ben Hyan off his skate and onto his stick, Van Guilder fired a low wrister past Lerg's stick to give the Irish a 2-1 lead. 
Huth sealed the win for Notre Dame 1:14 later when he beat Lerg with a slapshot from the right point. 
The win was a sort of vengeance li1r the Irish, who were eliminated in the regional linals by the Spartans last year. Jackson minimized the f(Jeling of revenge, though. 
"There wasn't a whole lot of talk about llastyearl," he said.

Rocky Mountain high 
ND beats UNH, MSU to advance to first Frozen Four 
By MATT GAMBER and SAM WERNER 
Sports Writers 

Notre Dame entered the weekend as the West regional's No. 4 seed, expected to step aside for the heavily-favored New Hampshire, the top seed. 
But the Irish, who struggled in the sec­ond half of the season, to say the least, beat New Hampshire 7-3 Priday and Michigan State 3-1 Saturday to advance to the first Prozen Four in the program's history. 
"After the way the second half has gone, I'm just happy for our kids," Jackson said. "You know, they persevered through a real difficult time. They still held together, they still worked hard." 
The Irish looked more at home on the larger, Olympic-sized ice surface. Jackson said the added space allowed Notre Dame more otli:msive creativity, especially on the power play. 
"You can really stretch out a team's penalty killing," Jackson said. "And we did­n't get stretched out defensively, which was huge." 
Notre Dame moves on to face Michigan in the national semifinal in Denver on April

Team finally regains early-season form with balanced effort in two upset victories in NCAA Tournament 
llow did this happen'! 
Until this weekend, it had been a frustrating couple of months for anyone who followed Notm I>arne hockey. After earn­ing a No.6 national ranking with a 16-4 start, thn Irish quick­ly fell apart, going S-1 1­4 after -blanking Princeton 7-0 on Dee. S. Even so, Notrn Dame still got more ehanees to sun~eed than it knew what to do with. 
-
The Irish won cunsccutivc games just once in January and 

Matt Gamber 
Associate Sports Editor 
February, yet they still finished fourth in the CCHA and got a first-round bye in the confer­ence tournament. 
They gave away the first of a three-game playoff set against Ferris State before coming baek with wins the next two nights to earn a spot in Detroit for the conference smnifinals last week­end, where they thought they needed at least one win to solid­ify a NCAA berth. 
Instead, Notre Dame gave up a game-tying goal to No. 3 Miami (Ohio) with 3.4 seconds to play and lost a heartbreaker in overtime. The next night, the Irish played an admittedly unin­spired third-place game, giving up two third-period goals to lose 2-1 to an unheralded Northern Michigan team. 
And yet, when the pairings were announeed on Easter Sunday, there the Irish were, 

placed in the West regional as the No. 4 seed -and widely eonsidered an afterthought, expected to eontinue its steady decline by losing to heavily­favored New Hampshire. 
So again, how did this hap­pen? 
The truth is, despite the l"aet that the Irish snuck into the tournament as the last at-large team, they didn't exactly come out of nowhere. 
After last year's landmark season, capped ofl" with the first CCHA championship and NCAA appearance in school history but eut short with a loss to Michigan State in the regional final, the Irish entered the year a top-1 0 team, living up to that ranking early on before stumbling around Christmas. 
But with their backs to the wall and with just this one last chance (for real this time), the Irish lived up to their early expectations and threw the newer, lower ones right back in their erities' faces. 
Jordan Pearce outplayed a pair of Hobey Baker finalists in net and continued to make a name !"or himself-how he hadn't done that already, even afttw being named the CCHA goalie of the year, is somewhat mind-boggling, b~leause the kid can play and he's shown it all year. 

Captain Mark Van Guilder stepped up, dishing out three assists on Friday before scoring Saturday's game-winner to gar­ner the region's most outstand­ing player award. 
Christian Hanson, who had 10 goals all year entering the weekend, scored three times. 
The defense was stellar, with hard-hitting Brock Sheahen earning a spot on the all-region­al team and freshmen defense­men Ian Cole and Teddy Hulh coming through with clutch goals. 
And eoach Jell" Jackson showed why he's widely consid­ered one of tho best big-game coaches in collegt~ hockny, run­ning his NCAA tournament record to 15-6. 
So that's how it happmwd, and while top-ranked Michigan surely will provide a tough test, who knows-it just might hap­pen again next weekend.
