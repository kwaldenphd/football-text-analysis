Revisions made for ticket lotto 
By MEGHANNE DOWNES News Editor 
Students wishing to enter the Purdue football ticket lot­tery today can expect a differ­ent scenario than the Michigan ticket lottery, Charlie Ebersol, Student Union Board president said. 
At the Michigan lottery two weeks ago, SUB was only able to provide about half of the students with lottery numbers due to time constrictions, technological errors and sup­posed Indiana state law and NCAA regulations. 
The ticket lottery for the Sept. 27 Notre Dame football game at Purdue will be held at Legends, instead of Reekers, and the time period will be twice as long as the Michigan lottery to accommodate all students who wish to enter the lottery. Students may bring a maximum of 6 ID cards between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. 
At the Michigan lottery, stu­dents were allowed to bring an unlimited amount of ID cards, which slowed lines, and the lottery was closed at the swipe card machine when the three-hour time period elapsed, leaving many stu­dents who had waited in line disgruntled. 
Though Ebersol previously said the lottery ended because Indiana state law prevented it from lasting longer than three hours, he admitted that he based this on previous SUB sponsored ticket lotteries and later learned this restriction did not apply. Ebersol said the Purdue lottery will not be restricted by Indiana state law

Hesburgh christens "Night of Faith" 

Future unclear for Biosphere 2 
By BETH ERICKSON News Wri[er 

Biosphere 2, a 3.15-acre glass-and-steel terrarium once thriving in the arid Arizona desert, now faces an uncertain future -and Notre Dame stu­dents planning to participate in its Earth Semester program this spring are in a similar predicament. 
The company that owns Biosphere 2 settled a lawsuit against Columbia University out of court last week. The owners claimed that Columbia's deci­sion to substantially curtail its financial commitment to the research facility constituted a breach of contract. The terms

SMC blocks student music downloading 
By ANN MAHONEY News Writer 

Downloading copyrighted music files off of the Internet has dramatically halted as Saint Mary's stu­dents have come to under­stand the harsh repercus­sions of the illegal violation, one school official said. 
Saint Mary's Information Technology has taken steps to prevent the downloading by blocking access to many of the popular sharing and downloading services that distribute copyrighted materials without the artists', or recording com­
panies', permission. 

Their action, along with the RIAA's threat to slap heavy fines on students choosing to share these copyrighted files. has so far served as a deterrent to Saint Mary's students who previously took advantage of these online services. 
Starting this fall, the school is taking new meas­ures in dealing with stu­dents found to be violating the laws.

Support our Irish 
On Saturday, I, like the vast majority of the student body, wit­nessed a debacle. Due to the resilience of the Wolfpack and Buckeyes, I was spared an over­
dmosedoef ur r,  Matthew Smedberg  
mayhem  
and medioc­rity, being  Wire Editor  
only able to  
watch the  
last 35 minutes of the game. This 


was perhaps for the best. 
"Support our athletes!" goes up the cry -oddly reminiscent of the cries of "support our troops!'' which flew so thick a few months ago. "They need to know we still believe in them!" Yes, indeed, sup­port them. Cheer. Make a sea of green. But don't pretend that last Saturday looked anything like the Irish, which we believe in, hope in and love. And if it didn't look like a duck, walk like a duck or quack like a duck, I say don't call it a duck. 
No, it is pr~cisely by holding up the Irish to the highest possible standard that we support them, just as expecting the best of our troops and expecting that they be used only in moral and just causes is precisely what supporting them means. If Carlyle and Vontez and Julius can put in an awful perform­ance-and those guys have all proved that they don't have to do anything of the sort-and we don't bat an eye, all that means is that we don't value their contribution, and the millions spent on football scholarships would be better spent on research into the mating habits of the Arizona tarantula. Not that I'm bashing tarantulas; I just doubt that NBC could get ad revenue from them every Saturday. 
Really, when you think about it, it is not so important that the Irish win. It will make absolutely no dif­ference in my future or yours (with the exception of if you are in fact on the football team, with a poten­tial professional future) if the score Saturday is another 0-38 or if it be 38-0. However, we as a school have made huge commitments to the athletics here, and are justly proud of our many achievements. If we wish to maintain that standard, it just will not do to pretend that fail­ure is anything but failure, just as we are so ready to acknowledge sweet success when it of often comes. 
In closing, I would like to leave you with a thought: we fired Bob Davie for claiming that the Fighting Irish were no longer capa­ble of competing on the national stage. He was okay with that. 
We are not.

Irish Inquisition debuts in SDH 
By LUKE BUSAM 
News Writer 
The Irish lnqusition convened 

for its first session Wednesday 
night in the Oak Room and the 
"accused" were asked what they 
would do if they were president 
of the United States. 
Student Body President Pat 

Hallahan said the inquisition was 
designed to bring members of the 
campus community together to 
share thoughts and laughs out­
side the classroom. 
The grand inquisitor. graduate 

student Peter Wicks, and a three­
person tribunal comprised of 
Notre Dame students Beth 
Duran, Joe Muto and Shawtina 
Ferguson passed judgment on 
each of the four "accused." 
The four participants, 

Executive Chef of Notre Dame 
Food Services Denis Ellis and 
professors Ted Warfield, Donald 
Kommers and Ani Aprahamian 
were each given ten minutes to 
answer the question, "What are 
the first things you would do as 
president of the United States?" 
Ellis and Warfield were found 

innocent of heresy and given T­
shirts that read, "I got off on a 
technicality at the Jrish 
Inquisition," while Kommers and 
Aprahamian were found guilty by 
the three-person tribunal and 
received "heretic" T-shirts pro­
claiming their condemnation. 
Warfield spoke of his dream to 

gather Justice Department offi­
cials to discuss the ability of the 
president to declare anyone he 
wishes an enemy combatant of 
the United States and detain that 
person without trial or other 
legal proceedings. 
Warfield also spoke of his desire to provide clean water, ·I'Jledicine and food to the ten mil­

lion children who die of preventa­ble diseases every year. Warfield believes that humanitarian organizations should be given "all the money they ask for to see if they can prevent these deaths." 
Ellis, an England native, point­ed out the impossibility of his election, bu.t spoke of a variety of options for his first act as presi­dent. He decided he would fulfill his desire to change the media's portrayal of war. Ellis argued that war should no longer be por­trayed as glamorous, but as the vulgar act that it truly is. 
Following intermission, Aprahamian said that, if presi­dent, she would, "Treat the American people like they have brains, try to tell them the truth and tell the American people that we have been unjust in the past and maybe that is why people hate us." 
On a lighter note, Aprhamian said she desired to eradicate the world of minivans and make physics a requirement for high school graduation. 
Kommers, who said he would

propose four policy ideas to the nation if he were president. These would be a constitutional amendment that would allow Congress to reverse Supreme Court decisions, a $5 per gallon gasoline tax to encourage the development of new transporta­tion infrastructure, the bombing of all North Korean weapons fac­tories and missile installations and the suspension of all funding to Israel until they dismantled all West Bank and Gaza Strip settle­ments. 
Kommers recognized that any one of these "could lead to impeachment." 
Ed Cohen, who created the Irish Inquisition, said he was pleased and thought the event went well, though the does want to create more of a "fun, intera,c­tive, concise, and fast-moving experience." 
The second inquisition will take place in the Oak Room, but the date is still to be set.

Environmental justice lecture series begins 
By KATHERINE GALES 
News Writer 

The lecture series on envi­
ronmental justice began 
Wednesday evening as Jose 
Bustos of the Service 
Employees International Union 
discussed the topic "Dumps, 
Justice and the Catholic 
Worker Movement." 

A native of Mexico and resi­dent·of East Chicago, Bustos is chairman of the Coalition for a Clean Environment, which was formed in opposition to the construction of a Confined Disposal Facility (CDF) in his area. For the past seven years, Bustos has been protesting the construction of the CDF, intended to remove waste by the "clamshell method" from the ship canal, in a district populated mainly by minori­ties. 
Calling the CDF "a sad fact for our region," Bustos pointed out that the proposed disposal site would be the biggest in our nation -over five times the size of Chicago's Wrigley Field. According to his lecture, nine of the 20 chemicals that the EPA considers most hazardous to humans will be present at this site, in close proximity to a high school. 
"This proposal is a corrupt plan for toxic waste disposal ­an environmental injustice, plain and simple," Bustos said. 
He defmed an environmental justice as "the fair treatment of all people ... equal enforce­ment of environmental treat­ment and policy, where no one

gets more and no one gets 
less." However, "[the] poor and 
minorities suffer the most [and] 
benefit the least," he said. "It's 
a form of racism -the inten­
tional placement of hazardous 
waste in areas occupied by 
minorities." 

As his goal, Bustos identified the need to "start a real dia­logue, where common concern is in the open and taken seri­ously." He observed a lack of respect by the Army Core of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency for the people of East Chicago. "I am hoping that this year or the year after we will be able to put a stop to this project," he said. 
In particular, Indiana is hav­ing trouble with pollution. Bustos cited a variety of figures that prove that pollution is lit­erally in Notre Dame's back­yard. "All of those chemicals will get to Notre Dame eventu­ally," he said in conclusion. 
Bustos is running for city council, hoping for victory "God willing and with support of the grassroots." 
Bustos was the first in a lec­ture series sponsored by the University's O'Neill Family Chair, Science, Technology and Values Program, Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, African and African-American Studies Program, and the Departments of Anthropology, Biological Sciences, and Civil Engineering and Geological Sciences.

STUDENT SENATE 



Senators examine, review TCE proposal 
By MAUREEN REYNOLDS 
Associare News Ediror 

The topic of TCE's was dis­cussed again Wednesday, this time during the meeting of the Student Senate. 
Jeremy Staley, chairperson of the Academic Committee in the Office of the Student Body President, presented the propos­al to publish TCE's that will be given to the University's Academic Council. His reasoning behind this came from the four students that will sit on the Academic Council along with fac­ulty and administrators. 
It is the responsibility of the Student Senate to approve three of the four student members on the council. Staley wanted to use the proposal to impress upon the Senators the important position that these three students will be filling. These students will be the "voice of the student body" on the Academic Council, Staley said. 
During his presentation, Staley explained the purpose of the TCE proposal. · 
"Information that is conducive to a person match between pro­fessors and students is non-exis­tent.... Our ultimate aim is to provide the best match between students and professors," he said. "We see this as the most significant student-initiated pro­posal in recent years." 
Senators questioned Staley on the proposal and its reception by the faculty. 
Faculty members, Staley explained to Senators, have not been very receptive to the idea of providing TCE results to stu­dents. To accommodate their hesitations, Staley said that the proposal includes provisions, which allow professors to add their own thoughts at the end of the results, offering more quali­tative information rather than simply quantitative information. Also, for professors who are fun­damentally opposed to TCE pub­lication, professors will be allowed to opt out of the process all together. . 
These provisions, Staley believes, make the proposal "as balanced and as fair as possible." 
Inclosing his presentation, Staley told the Senators "to chal­lenge the boundaries that the University sets is [the Student Senate's] responsibility." In other Senate news: 
+ Student Body President Pat Hallahan reminded Senators of the Church in Africa conference that begins Sunday at 7:30 p.m. with a speech from President Obasanjo of Nigeria. Hallahan asked the Senators to relay to their dorms the important oppor­tunity at hand. 
"It's really a great opportunity for all our students to see ... It's essential that we have people there and it's going to be worth your time," Hallahan said.

Arafat proposes new cease-fire 
RAMALLAH, West Bank -Palestinian 
leader Vasser Arafat offered a new truce to 
Israel on Wednesday, after Palestinian offi­
cials said the militant group l-lamas has sig­
naled it might agree to st(lp attacking 
Israelis. 
Interviewed on Israel TV's Channel 2. 
Arafat was asked if there was a possibility 
for a cease-fire. "Of course," he said. "You're 
invited. The announcement was made yes­
terday," referring to remarks by his security 
adviser, Jibril Rajoub. 
In an earlier interview on Israel's Channel 10, Arafat said contacts were under way with all Palestinian factions over a cease­fire. "There are continuous contacts with various parties. Yesterday, I had a meeting with all the PLO factions," Arafat said. 
Crackdown angers Muslim charities 
JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia -A Saudi crack­down on c.ash donations to charities aimed at blocking the flow of money to terrorists has had one immediate effect: angering Muslim groups that help the poor, including one that expects contributions to drop by one-third. 
The disappearance of once-ubiquitous boxes at mosques and malls where Saudis could drop cash gifts to Islamic charities is the most public result of U.S. pressure on the kingdom to find ways to keep al-Qaida and other terrorist networks from siphoning off donations. 
Saudi Arabia also has banned all private relief and charity groups from sending money overseas until regulations are in place to make sure the money is not going toward terrorist groups. And the government established a unit to monitor Saudi charities suspected of sponsoring terrorist groups.

Ind. Hispanic population leaps 
INDIANAPOLIS-Juan Morales emigrated from Mexico a decade ago, one of a wave of thousands of Hispanics who relocated to Indiana during the 1990s in search of good jobs. 
Morales, 27, knows the influx of Hispanics into the state has not slowed down despite the sluggish national economy -and U.S. Census Bureau population estimates released Thursday show he's right. 
Those numbers show that Indiana's Hispanic population grew 8.9 percent in the first three years of the new decade, from 217,090 in 2000 to 236,367 last year. 
Morales said he and other Hispanic resi­dents feel less isolated in their adopted English-speaking home because of that trend. 
"I feel more accepted now because there's many more people," he said. "That means they're hiring more Hispanics and there's also more contact with the majority." 

Hurricane poised to slam East Coast

NAGS HEAD, N.C. 
Hurricane Isabel closed in 
on North Carolina's Outer 
Banks on Wednesday with 
105 mph winds and the 
potential for up to a foot of 
rain, threatening to cause 
ruinous flooding across a 
huge swath of the already 
soggy East. 

Isabel had weakened to 
a Category 2 hurricane 
from a Category 5, 160­
mph monster, but was still 
expected to be dangerous 
when it hit the barrier

with a storm surge of up to 
11 feet. 

More than 300,000 peo­

Virginia were urged to 
move to higher ground.

Outer Banks mostly evacu­

were also posted for low­

Cops kill hostage taker, 2 wounded 
Associated Press 

DYERSBURG, Tenn. -A gunman took at least a dozen people hostage in a college classroom Wednesday afternoon before he was shot by police. Two hostages ":'ere wounded during the nine-hour standoff. 
Police heard gunshots from inside the building at Dyersburg State Community College around 11 p.m. EDT. The gunman, 26-year-old Harold Kilpatrick Jr.. had left a note saying he "wanted to kill some peo­ple and die today." . 
Dyersburg Police Chief Bobby Williamson initially said Kilpatrick fatally shot himself, but he later confirmed that officers shot him. 
"Our people shot one -the hostage-taker -and two others were wounded," Williamson said. 
It was not immediately clear 
whether the two hostages were wounded by police or Kilpatrick. Williamson said the injuries to the hostages were not serious. 
Four ambulances were at the col­lege building in Dyersburg, about 75 miles northeast of Memphis. Two people were carried out of the building on stretchers. Police escort­ed several other people from the building. 
The gunman, believed to have had a 9mm pistol and what looked like a butcher knife, made no demands ­aside from food and drink -during the standoff. In the evening, he asked for six pepperoni pizzas and two six-packs of soft drinks, which police delivered. 
The gunman claimed to be a member of al-Qaida, and Williamson said that although authorities had· no reason to believe 
----------------------------------~~__J 
the claim, the FBI had been called in. Justice Department officials in Washington also said they had no evidence that the g,unman was a member of the terrorist organiza­tion. 
Authorities said Kilpatrick, of Memphis, was staying with his sister in Dyersburg. In the suicide note, left at his sister's house, he also said he didn't like Americans and had spoken with al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, Williamson said. 
Kilpatrick faced criminal charges of assault and kidnapping in anoth­er case, Dyersburg police spokesman Charles Maxey said. He had no details but said Kilpatrick had been scheduled to appear in a Memphis courtroom Wednesday. 
Williamson said there were 12 to 16 people in the basic math class­room when the standoff began.

of the settlement have not been made public. 
Columbia will relinquish con­trol of the superstructure and its educational and research programs in December. 
Athia Hardt, spokesperson for Columbia and Biosphere 2 Center, said, "As of Dec. 22, all research currently being con­ducted at Biosphere 2 will cease -it will either have been wrapped up or transitioned elsewhere." 
Christine Mingione, a Notre Dame student currently study­ing at Biosphere 2, said that she and the other students will complete their studies unhin­dered this semester. 

"There is a sense of motiva­tion among both students and faculty to make this the best semester possible and to go out with a bang in whatever way we can," Mingione said. 
The fate of spring semester hopefuls remains undeter­mined. 
"The undergraduate Earth Semester program at Biosphere 2 has yet to be formally can­celed," said professor Paul Grimstad, director of under­graduate studies in Environmental Sciences. "When speaking by phone with one of the faculty at Biosphere 2 the other day, I was informed that they are trying to make sure a spring semester goes ahead and that they plan to have as good a spring semester as possible." 
Texas Christian University, located in Fort Worth, has expressed interest in assuming financial responsibility for the program, Grimstad said. Hardt had no comment on this poten­tial endowment. 
If the program does not recommence next semester, spring semester Biosphere stu­dents such as Junior Lauren Kinsman may encounter hous­ing troubles. Kinsman has not been informed of her rooming situation for the spring. 
"I've e-mailed [International Study Programs] about whether or not I will be guaranteed housing on campus and they haven't gotten back to me yet," she said. 
Charles Kulpa, chair of the Department of Biological Sciences, said that Notre Dame will not attempt to simulate the Biosphere experience if the pro­gram is shut down. 
"I do not believe there is a program anywhere that can supplement for the learning experience that is provided by the Earth Semester at Biosphere 2," he said. 
Notre Dame is one of only 19 academic institutions to imple­ment a program at the facility this semester. According to Kulpa, Notre Dame has delegat­ed over 60 students to partici­pate in the renowned program since its inception as an educa­tional facility in 1996. 
"Every one of [Notre Dame's participants] indicated that it was a life-changing experi­ence," he said. 
Kulpa said that the termina­tion of the Earth Semester pro­gram would deliver a significant blow to environmental educa­tion. 
"It [is] an extraordinary pro­gram, taught by dedicated fac­ulty in an unprecedented set­ting," he said. 

Mingione said that the public is largely unaware of the facili­ty's goals, which may never be accomplished because of the closure. She said the Biosphere 2 education program aims to "bring future scientists and pol­icymakers together to teach how each system works in order to create a more efficient country in the future." 
The program has played an instrumental role in the Environmental Sciences depart­ment at Notre Dame and has educated such notables as Notre Dame's 14th Rhodes Scholar, Andrew Serazin, who graduated last May.

have their network and Internet access blocked from their computers and their names will be sent to vice president of student affairs Linda Timm. 
According to Kathy Hausman, Coordinator of Student Computing, students have been cooperating. 
"Overall, the [initial] reaction for Saint Mary's students has been, 'How can I get in trouble for downloading music if it is free and on the Internet?' Not everything on the Internet is legal," she said, "and stu­dents need to be aware that their actions could have serious and possi­bly expensive consequences."

Hesburgh said he looked to the Holy Spirit for guidance and inspiration throughout his life. 
"My devotion which really keeps me going is devotion to the Holy Spirit," he said. 
Hesburgh said the Holy Spirit is the "spirit of wisdom" who "knows all the answers," yet "he's also the forgotten guy." 
Hesburgh said he begins and ends each day with the prayer, "Come, Holy Spirit."'

tions, he would 
never change his decision to become a priest. 
"It's wonderful just to follow the life of Christ, and to try to live it out in your own time, your own place," Hesburgh said. 
Hesburgh cherishes his ability to offer Mass and listed exotic locations in which he has celebrated Mass, ranging from the South Pole to 50,000 feet above the ground in an air­plane. 
He said he tries to celebrate Mass every day -he can only remember missing Mass three times since his retirement. 
"Having Mass every day strengthens your faith," he said. 
He also tries to visit the Grotto daily. 
"I manage to do that pretty consistently ­like at 100 percent," Hesburgh said. 
Speaking of the Grotto and campus, Hesburgh said he considers Notre Dame to be one of the most desirable locations on the planet. 
"I don't know any place on earth I'd rather 
be except here," he said.

Most students claimed that while they used to frequently download music files from their school comput­ers, they now only do it from home. 
"It's understandable what [Saint Mary's] is trying to do," said junior Katie Larsen. "It was when I had a virus that wiped out not only my com­puter but a lot of other people's that I regarded the school as being respon­sible for everyone on the network." 
Even with the risk of serious penal­ties, there remain students who find a way to continue downloading copy­righted material. 
But nobody wanted to talk to The Observer on the record about why they would continue to download music for fear of getting punished.

Ebersol said he implemented many of the changes due to the concerns students raised following the Michigan lottery. 
Though there will still be only one swipe card reader for the lottery, Ebersol said the modified rules and expanded time period should com­pensate for everyone using the same machine.

Ebersol said improvements were made to the security system to negate the possibility of reoccurring lottery fraud, which was a problem in past years. However, he declined to comment on the system, citing security issues. 
Ebersol said in previous years, individuals who were not Notre Dame students and who belonged to SUB fraudulently received tickets. The lottery is limited to Notre Dame students and excludes Saint Mary's and Holy Cross students because the ticket office, which provides the tick­ets for the lottery, specifies who is eligible.

IN BRIEF 

Indiana carrier may suspend flights 
FORT WAYNE, Ind.-An Indiana-based air­line may soon stop flying for two months after pilots overwhelmingly rejected a package of wage concessions. 
Shuttle America, a US Airways regional car­rier, relocated its headquarters from Windsor Locks, Conn., to Fort Wayne International Airport last fall. The carrier operates five daily round-trip flights between Fort Wayne and Pittsburgh, with reduced service on weekends. 
President and Chief Executive Officer Scott 
Durgin said Tuesday that Shuttle America will 
likely not fly between Oct. 27 and Dec. 31. 
Happy Meal to grow up healthy CHICAGO -McDonald's Corp. is testing a new kind of Happy Meal-one for adults. 
Instead of a burger and a toy that are stan­dard fare in kids' Happy Meals, the Go Active meal being test marketed in Indiana will include a salad, an exercise booklet and a pedometer to encourage people to walk more to maintain good health. 
The test program will be at more than 150 McDonald's in Indianapolis, Bloomington, Muncie, Lafayette and Kokomo this fall. 
The fast food giant has enlisted the aid of Oprah Winfrey's personal trainer, fitness guru Bob Greene, to promote the $4.99 Go Active Meal, its latest effort to convince consumers that it is serious about offering healthier products. The meal also includes a bottle of water or a medium fountain drink. 
Merrill execs face conspiracy rap 
HOUSTON -Three former Merrill Lynch executives were charged with conspiracy Wednesday for allegedly helping Enron Corp. inflate earnings with a loan disguised as a sale of Nigerian barges. 
Daniel Bayly, Robert Furst and James Brown became the first Wall Street bankers to be hit with criminal charges in the scandal that brought down the energy company. The criminal charges do not involve Merrill Lynch, which reached a side agreement that would allow the brokerage to avoid any corporate culpability if it implements "a series of sweep­ing reforms" to improve the integrity of its transactions with clients and third parties. · 
The three men were charged with conspira­cy to commit fraud and falsifying books and records. 
AOL Time Warner to drop 'AOL' 
NEW YORK -AOL and Time Warner got married at the height of the Internet boom, and now they seem ready to acknowledge that it's time for a separation-in name, at least. 
On Thursday, AOL Time Warner Inc.'s board will vote on a proposal to drop "AOL" from the company's name, according to a source famil­iar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. Company spokeswoman Mia Carbonnell declined to comment. 
The company has already dismissed the executives responsible for the merger and backtracked on the lofty promises for a media revolution, but a decision to jettison "AOL" would pay tribute to the failed hopes of the largest merger in U.S. history. 




Grasso resigns amid salary furor 
NYSE chairman steps down after $139.5 million compensation deal revealed 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -New York 
Stock Exchange chairman 
Dick Grasso resigned 
Wednesday amid rising 
fury over his $139.5 million 
pay package, his 36-year 
career ruined by cries that 
he made too much money 
running the world's richest 
financial market. 
Grasso called an emer­
gency meeting of the NYSE 
board shortly after the 
market closed and offered 
to resign as chairman and 
chief executive if the board 
requested, said H. Carl 
McCall, chairman of the 
NYSE compensation com­
mittee. 

"The board did so and 
accepted that resignation," 
said McCall, who chaired 
the meeting. 

Grasso, in a statement, said he was stepping down "with the deepest reluc­tance." He added that "I believe this course is in the best interest of both the exchange and myself." 
Critics. from investor 
advocates to politicians and 
traders, say the lavish pay

of the exchange, a not-for­
profit institution that is 
owned by its members and 
also serves as a regulatory 
watchdog.

Fair 
continued from page 1 
Morgan Stanley is from Notre Dame, and NO students know how to have more fun then Ivys [League students]." 
Firm wide, Morgan Stanley hopes to have ten or eleven Notre Dame students partici­pate in the final interviews in New York. 
Career Center director Lee Svete charac­terized the fair as a success, noting the increased participation of both students and employers. 
"This is the most active recruiting I've seen since 2000," Svete said. The fair featured 101 companies, up from about 90 last year. 
Svete said student groups, including the marketing and finance clubs, helped organ­ize the event. 
He praised the new GoiRISH system, a Web-based tool that allows students to view job postings, submit resumes and schedule interviews online. "We've registered over 1900 students in three weeks," Svete said. 
Several improvements were made to this year's fair, as well. The committee used an ID-scanning machine when students entered the fair, allowing it to track stu­dents' majors and year of graduation. With this new information, improvements can be made to expand the fair to better serve more students. 
Several Notre Dame students said the career fair was a helpful experience. 
''I'm trying to get exposure and see what the market is offering," said Andrei Sandu, a senior finance major. 
Sophomore Michelle Young was enthusi­astic after learning that her major in Chinese will help in obtaining an internship with the Central Intelligence Agency. 
Not all students were headed to the realm of big business, however. Non-profit organi­zations, including Teach for America, host­ed tables at the fair. Sarah Finch, a senior PLS major, said a Notre Dame education fits well with a service career. 
"With an undergraduate education from Notre Dame, how can you expect someone not to commit themselves to a field where they're making a difference?" Finch said.

Experts say AIDS funds insufficient 
Associated Press 

GENEVA -As AIDS runs rampant in Africa and threatens calamity for India, China and Russia, epidemi­ologists say that even the promise of billions in rescue money cannot curb the dis­ease as long as social and political barriers hamper the fight. 
"Coping mechanisms are collapsing," Richard Feachem, head of the Global Fund set up by leaders of the industrialized democra­cies, said in an interview. After two decades, he said, the pandemic is spinning further out of control. 
Peter Piot, director of UNAIDS, the U.N. agency fighting the disease, agreed that denial and lack of urgency on the part of some governments blunted inter­national action. 
"In Asia and eastern Europe, the political leader­ship isn't there," he said. At recent meetings in India, Piot said, "I heard great speeches, but as for action, zero." 
The U.N. General Assembly gathers for a spe­cial one-day session on AIDS Monday, brightened by the prospect of infusions of money, primarily President Bush's promised $15 billion aid package. But the con­sensus among dozens of specialists interviewed in Europe and America is that the money won't help much unless countries c()me out of denial and work together. 
They say China and India have millions more HIV-pos­itive cases than officials acknowledge. Russia is largely a mystery because so many infected drug users and prostitutes have not been tested. Officials in Moscow say 250,000 people are registered as HIV-posi­tive, but public health doc­tors are convinced the real the World Health figure is well over a million. Organization. ''Everyone is

The Worl< of Our Hands 
by Rev. jim King & Rev. Kevin Russeau Office of Vocation, Congregation of Holy Cross 
In 1860, at the age of27, Fr. William Corby, C.S.C. was ordained a Holy Cross priest. The 
following year he volunteered as a chaplain with the Irish Brigade and eventually marchea 
through the Civil War years with these Union men who fought at Fredericksburg, 
Chancellorsville, Spotsylvania, and, most notably, Gettysburg. 
Shortly after 4:00p.m. on July 2, 1863, as the battle in Pennsylvania approached its cre­scendo on Cemetery Ridge, Fr. Corby beseeched the commanding colonel for permission to address the Brigade. He donned his purple stole, mounted a nearby rock, extended his hand, and pronounced briefwords ofabsolution over the soldiers. 1 
Witnesses later reported that every man in sight, Catholic, other faith, and atheist, dropped to his knees in unison as Fr. Corby made the Sign of the Cross. Later in life, he insisted that the rare general absolution was intended for everyone regardless ofwhether they were clad in blue or gray. Yet by sunset on that epochal day, the blood of nearly 30,000 uniformed men wearing grave clothes ofindistinguishable colors mingled on the ground before him, and in the horrible aftermath, one wonders ifhe questioned what difference his prayer had made. 
In 1888 Fr. Corby was invited to be the first speaker at a twenty-fifth anniversary gathering held in Gettysburg. When he poignantly uttered the words, "Here is what is left of us. Where are the others?" former Yankees and Confederates broke down with him and wept together for several minutes. After his death, they proved how much he had meant to them by petitioning to have his statue erected near the spot where he stood with raised hand and blessed them all. 
Today a copy ofthat same statue stands in front of Corby Hall. Some know it only for the football moniker, "Fair Catch Corby," acquired years after the cannon thunder had ceased and old veterans' bones rested more peacefully in other fields. Others, however, stop occasionally and say a quiet prayer in front of the priest, who, like Mary on the Dome, blesses us all and reminds us every day that God's forgiveness is powerful enough to conquer death and reconcile bitter foes. 
Though Fr. Corby later served two terms as Notre Dame's president, he would undoubtedly be pleased that he is most remembered for the sacrament he administered at Gettysburg with a few words and the priestly movement of his hands. It is something of a tradition among University presidents that they understand themselves to be priests first, as any reader of Fr. Hesburgh's autobiography, God, Country, and Notre Dame, will quickly discover. 
So we invite you to take a close look at your own hands and reflect upon how they might best be used to convey God's love to all. Next Tuesday, September 23, at 8:45 p.m. we are sponsoring our fifth annual "Corby Night," an hour of prayer and informal discussion for anyone considering a vocation to religious life in Holy Cross. 
It will be held at Corby Hall, which is most appropriate, for Fr. Corby's story epitomizes how much a young man can do to relieve the world's sufferings through the simple signs of grace which are the Church's sacraments. It is what we have been ordained to do, and there are few things more i~portant to the Church's future than having more priests present among us to manifest God's merciful justice wherever people's souls hang in the balance.

Don't read the news 
Yes, I see the irony. I am going to argue against reading newspapers, and I'm going to make the argument in a newspa­per column.

There is no shortage of polemics against the news media. Conservatives frequently complain of liberal bias -as the joke goes, the very last headline The 
. Washington Post runs will read "World Ends: Women and Minorities Hurt Worst,"-whereas leftist media critics argue that in an age of increased con­glomeration, the integrity ofthe news media has been corrupted by corporate interests. There is no reason to think that these charges are incompatible, and in fact I think that they are both demonstrably true; it is both the case that journalism is regularly undermined by the corporate interests of the news conglomerates, reg­ularly compromises journalistic objectivity and that on all of the social issues which serve as a political litmus test in the United States (such as gun control, affir­mative action, gay marriage, and, above all, abortion) the news tends to favor a liberal viewpoint, for the simple reason that the majority of journalists and editors hold liberal views on these issues. But the deepest problem with the news is neither corporate censorship nor liberal

bias. The essential and unflxable flaw of newspapers is that they print every day. It is simply impossible to make sense of the world ifour information about it is given to us in the form of 24 hour snapshots. 
Of course, some people genuinely need to have access to up-to-the-minute infor­mation. Most of us do not, and typically those who do have access to the informa­tion through channels other than newspa­pers. I suspect that one of the reasons why so many of us feel a compulsion to watch and read the news is vanity; we simply do not want to admit that it doesn't make the slightest difference ifwe find out about events on the other side of the country, or the other side of the world, until weeks or even months after they happen. 
It might be replied that it is irresponsi­ble not to follow public affairs, that it allows those who wield power to do what they wish free from scrutiny. But this pre­supposes what is not the case, that read­ing newspapers is an effective method of monitoring public officials. Those who are genuinely powerful are typically very adept at manipulating the media -we complain about spin, but we still think ourselves immune to it-more vanity. 
To become well informed about world affairs, or even national affairs, is a Sisyphean task. Fortunately, America has a long tradition of high-quality weekly and monthly political journals. While far from perfect, their lower frequency of publication both forces them to ignore much ofthe ephemera and be selective about the stories which they print. The articles they do carry tend to be longer, allowing more freedom for substantial analysis. 
It might be argued that without reading newspapers it will be easier to ignore the suffering of people around the world. The problem with this response is that it neg­lects the fact that newspapers are inter­ested only in what is new. Uke a predator, the news is interested only in that which moves. The outbreak of famine in an undemocratic African nation might be registered, but the continuance of famine is not. Starving people are not news today ifthey were starving yesterday. 
The most serious bias in the news isn't one of political ideology; it's the bias of attention towards change and against continuity. Often the most important things to know are those that were the same yesterday as today and will be the same tomorrow. 
So what can we do? The frrst thing we can (and must) do is give up the illusion that we can become generally well­informed about the world, or even the nation in which we live. To think other­wise will lead only to self-deception and ideology. The best we can do is learn for­eign languages, read and reread works of 20th Century history, and literature -as Ezra Pound said, literature is news that stays news. 
If you are still unconvinced, try this thought experiment: imagine that while sitting on a train, you see a copy of today's New York Times left on a seat. You would probably be curious, and perhaps you would read it. Now imagine that the copy of the Tunes that you see is a week old. Would you still be interested? And, if not, why do you want knowledge with such a short expiration date?

React to Michigan fans with dignity and grace 
Though the Michigan game was disappointing, never have we been so proud to be Notre Dame fans. Through adverse conditions, Irish fans proved that they have more class in their index fmgers than the entire University of Michigan student body has collectively. 
Being in the band, we had been forwarned that Michigan Stadium would more than likely be a hostile environment. but never could we have imagined anything like the events of this past Saturday. 
The band's day began with a practice on soccer fields near Michigan Stadium. Having finished our warm-up, we gathered around our directors to receive instruction, words of wisdom and inspiration. Following this, we were led in prayer by a fellow band member and with hands held and heads bowed, together we said the Our Father. This being a very important ritual for the band, many of us were shocked and appalled to hear two Michigan fans screaming, "F---the Irish!" If ever there were an inappropria,te time for cursing and badgering, this would be it. If Michigan cannot respect our school, the least they should do is respect our faith. 
The insults did not stop there. Standing in the end zone, preparing for pre-game, the Michigan stu­dent body began to chant, "F---you, Irish," which lasted well into the band's pre-game performance. While we have no doubts that every school has a few bad apples for fans, this is simply outrageous. 
The idea that the Michigan student body could come together to insult and offend the opposing team's band shows a complete and utter lack of class. Never, in our two full years here, have we ever witnessed our Notre Dame students doing anything of the sort to any of our opponents, and for this we feel an immense amount of appreciation for our school. 
During the game, Michigan fans spat on, cursed at, called names to and taunted Notre Dame band members. A five year old child was seated directly behind the band was heard ordering, "Kill the Leprechaun!" Fans behind the Notre Dame sidelines yelled and threw food and ice cubes at Irish players. Through it all though, Notre Dame students who had journeyed into "The Big House" never failed to do the jig, clap to the Notre Dame Victory March, or most importantly, cheer on the Irish. 
What touched us the most was during post-game, almost 20 minutes after the game had ended, there in the almost empty stands, were lone green shirts, swaying together to the melody of the Alma Mater. The tears on our cheeks were not over a heartbreaking loss, but rather for the devoted support of our fellow students. God bless. 
Here's to you, Irish fans, for accepting defeat with dignity and grace. We, as a student body, should welcome Michigan State fans as friendly rivals, regardless of the outcome of the game. Let's continue to show the country that though we lost to Michigan, we have not lost our spirit.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


Apologizing for poor 
behavior 
On behalf of the University of Michigan student section, I deeply apologize for the vulgarity demonstrated at the game in Ann Arbor this past Saturday. I am usually proud to call myself a Wolverine, but because of the actions taken by my fellow students, I am ashamed of the title. The loyal Notre Dame fans that made the trek from South Bend deserved respect and admiration from Michigan fans in and around the Big House. Yet, they were treated with dis­regard and contempt, especially by my peers. 
We are part of the two most esteemed and honored football pro­grams in the nation and because of that, this game was highly anticipated. Nevertheless, many students were out of line for the crude comments chanted during the game and especially the actions that took place outside of the stadium. I sincerely apologize for these words and actions of my peers. I hope that many of these students will mature so this will not happen again and the good­natured rivalry between these outstanding football programs can continue.

Game rivalry should not be unexpected 
I was interested to see how the Michigan-Notre Dame game was being received in South Bend, so for the first time, I read The Observer. I was sur­prised to see that Michigan fans lack of"Midwestern Hospitality" garnered far more attention than the game itself. Matt Mooney in particular seems to have had a poor experience, though he never indicates that he was in attendance at the game, so I'm inclined to believe that much of his viewpoint is sensation­alized anyway, and that's fme. The actions of so few are difficult to stretch out into those ofthe entire Michigan fan base. 
But he is right on some things. lhe only objects that should be thrown at people on fall Saturdays are footballs and no one should ever have to witness, under any circumstances, a mock hanging of an African-American or any other human being. 
Any person you speak to in South Bend, Ann Arbor or to whatever comer of the world those two football nations reach would surely agree that a rivalry exists between the two schools. At any meeting they have, passions are going to be roaring. There will be alcohol consumed by both sides, likely resulting in immature and inappropriate behavior. Is it impossible to believe that Michigan fans were the only ones acting in such a way? Please. 
If Mooney is so upset by undignified behavior, then why risk it and attend a football game at an extreme rival's stadium, while wearing the opponent's col­ors? Did the fed up Irish fans that made the trip to Ann Arbor and received a negative comment or two thrown their way expect to be embraced? No. They came in rooting for their squad and exchanging friendly banter with their opponents. Honestly, ifyou weren't braced for remarks from the Michigan faithful, what were you expecting? 
Somehow, I think all this whining and sarcastic insulting at Michigan fans would be irrelevant had the score not been 38-0. It's too bad Irish fans' visits to Ann Arbor were miserable. It's worse they think the reason for their misery isn't their team.

The men of Fisher Hall take to the rooftops for fifty hour< 
By SARAH VABULAS Scene Editor 

The men of Fisher Hall will dedicate their weekend to a fundraiser for the National Center for Missing or Exploited Children. They are participating in their second annual Roof Sit, where for fifty hours, volunteers sit atop the roof as a visible indicator of their dedication to the organization. 
This fundraiser began last year on the weekend of Oct. 4, when the 180 resi­dents of Fisher Hall celebrated the dorm's 50th anniversary with efforts to make a difference for one Notre Dame family, the Greenwoods. The golden anniversary of the dorm served as a wonderful opportunity for the Fisher Hall staff and council to present a new signature event-a 50-Hour Roof Sit. 
The 50-Hour Roof Sit was originally planned as a dorm activity celebrating the golden anniversary of Fisher Hall; however, the hall staff and government made a change in the reasoning behind the event after hearing about a family in need. 
In the Hall President's Council meet­ing. Fisher l~aders heard about Betsey Greenwood, the one-year-old daughter of second-year Notre Dame law school student Adam Greenwood. She was diagnosed with a brain tumor in May 2002. 
Fisher Hall staff and government found this to be a magnificent opportu­nity to not o:tly celebrate the dorm's anniversary, but to make the event a campus wide fundraise:-benefiting a Notre Dame family, as weil as the Notre Dame community. They selected the Greenwood family to be the recipients of the donations in order to alleviate some of the cost of treating Betsey's condition. 
Beginning two weeks before the bene­fit, volunteers distributed envelopes to all dorms, offices and departments around campus. The donation envelopes contained sponsor sheets for groups and individuals around campus to get involved in the fundraising. 
After contacting the University's Office 
:} 
\ 
of the President, Fisher gained further financial support and campus involve­ment through a $50 pledge of University funds for each dorm that had at least 50 residents stop by and sign in during the Roof Sit. Each dorm successfully fulfilled this goal, with over 2,000 students visiting and pledging support throughout the weekend. 
Last year, Fisher Hall held a silent auction uver the course of the first 25 hours, raising a significant amount of money. 
This year, Fisher Hall's 50-Hour Roof Sit will run much the same. but with many added activities to further com­munity involvement and awareness of the fundraiser. 
Last year, 11 volunteers participated in the Root Sit, raising a total of $5,350, with over 2,300 students in attendance throughout the course of the weekend. 
This year's donations will be donated to the National Center for Missing or Exploited Children in the memory of former Fisher resident, Chad Sharon. Sharon had been missing for two months before he was found dea,d in February. 
Beginning at 7:50p.m. on Friday, fol­lowing the Michigan State football pep rally, the Fisher 50-Hour Roof Sit will kick off at Legends with Fisher Hall staff and other campus celebrities, tak­ing their seat on the roof to begin the 50-hour sit-a-thon to rally the Notre Dame community together behind this national organization. Fisher Ha!l Council has ::t. large celebration set up at Legends, complete with plzza and music provided by Notre Dame student bands. 
There will always be five or more people on the r~oftop at any point in time, including during the Notre Dame football game. Fisher's rector, Father Robert Moss. will sit on the roof of Legends for the duration of the football game. 
Friday night's events will last until late, but people will remain on the roof, rain or shine. Beginning early Saturday morning, Fisher is hosting an all day 


fun and games event outside the darm 
on South Quad. They have rented inflat­
ables such as a bungee run. sumo 
wrestling and a moonwalk. EYeryone is 
welcome to participate in these activi­
ties. While everyone else is jumping and 
playing, Fisher men and their families 
may enjoy a tc..ilgate at Legends -no alcohol however. The hope with this event is to bring unity among the men and their families, while coming together fo~ a good cause. For most of the 50 hours, volunteers from Fisher will carry around a giant fishbowl. mut.:h like what royalty use<:: to be carried around in ­think Robin Hood here. They will be asking for donations as they trek around campus, walking through tailgates and through other large crowds gathered. This will begin Friday night and will continue both before and after the foot­ball game. In the same regard, a buck­et and a bullhorn will sit atop the roof. The bucket will be lowered down when a person approaches the representa­tives to give a. donation. The bullhorn will be used, obvi­ously, as a way to direct attention to .the folks collect· ing money and rafsing aware­ness. In recognition for sup­port, pledgers will be award­ed various gifts as a way to thank them. 
Fisher president Russell Morton said, "Our whole goal is to make it an entire campus event -a second signature 
event like the Fisher Regatta." In order to accomplish this goal, rectors, hall governments and students from other dorms will also be par­ticipating in the roof sit­ting aspect of the fundrais­er. 
Following the game on Saturday and the carnival­like atmos­phere with the inflata­bles, right on the 25-hour mark, the men of Fisher Hall will begin the other half of the 50-Hour Roof Sit atop the roof of their own dorm, mov­ing from Legends. The switch will

Throughout the course of the night, the Fisher Hall 50-Hour Roof Sit leaders have planned "The Fisher Feats of Strength," an event where the men of Fisher Hall can prove them­selves by doing crazy feats involving the number 50. 
One Fisher resident ate 50 doughnuts last year and plans to do the same this year. Another bench-pressed 50 pounds, 50 times, in 50 sec­onds. This year, senior Fisher resident and Roof Sit commis­sioner Andy Vitt plans to juggle a golf ball 500 times on the end of one of his golf clubs, much like Tiger Woods in one of his television commercials. 
Sunday, the inflatables will be out on the quad again, hop­ing to encourage others to drop by and see the event. 
"We hope people will notice what's going on and come down. They will see we're rais­ing money for a great eause and donate in a good name," said Vitt, who founded the 50­Hour Roof Sit last year when he served as Fisher Hall presi­from each dorm. Prizes 

will be awarded to the dGrm with the most participation and spirit from residents. 
"Our whole goal is to raise money for charity and have a good time while we're doing it," said Vitt. 
Meijer, Pepsi and other businesses 
have donated items for raffle and give­aways from the roof for those who donate. Other local South Bend busi­nesses have donated as well. The busi­nesses fully support the cause and hoped that their donations would encourage people to give. 
Vitt and Morton are talking with WSBT and WNDU to gather further sup­port from the South Bend community with this event. It is also possible that ESPN's "The Season" crew will make an appearance at the 50-Hour Roof Sit. 
"This is a great fundraiser and service event to kick of the year," said Vitt. He is in charge of the event. 
"We are hoping this year it can have a bigger turnout than last year to add to the Notre Dame community," said Vitt. "How many times do you walk across campus and see people sitting on the roof? We want it to be an eye-opener to get out there to support a good cause." 
Vitt and Morton really hope to have a large amount of support from the other dorms on campus. They want it to be both a campus event as well as a chal­lenge to other dorms -a challenge for them to get residents to come support the cause. 
Fisher'was Notre Dame's Dorm of the Year last year. They hope this event will also challenge their residents to live up to the title -to prove why they were selected as Dorm of the Year. 
The second annual Fisher Hall 50­Hour Roof Sit will prove to be another tradition of the Notre Dame family. This event will not only be fun for students and their families, but will be a great way to raise money for people or organ­izations that impact members of the Notre Dame family.

C.ubs win, move to half-game back of Astros 
Associated Press ' CHICAGO -Kerry Wood was hurting before the game, his back so stiff Chicago Cubs man­ager Dusty Baker wasn't sure if he'd be able to pitch. Oh, Wood pitched all right. And it was a gem. Wood pitched a four-hitter for his fourth complete game of the year, striking out 11 as the Cubs swept the New York Mets with a 2-0 victory Wednesday. "He had it going on from the opening pitch," Baker said. "I guess he's doing fine now." Doug Glanville and Aramis Ramirez hit solo homers for the Cubs, who improved to 13-4 in September and guaranteed themselves a winning season ­just their seventh in 31 years. It's quite a turnaround from last season, when the Cubs lost 95 games and got not one, but two managers fired. But the Cubs have a new atti­tude under Baker. Not only are they winning, but they're in contention for the NL Central title. They are just a half-game behind first-place Houston, which lost at Colorado 7-5 on Wednesday night. "We need a little help from them, but we can't afford to slip," Wood said. "We need to win every game to give our­selves a chance. We've been doing that. We've been playing good baseball and right now it's a lot of fun in the clubhouse and on the field. 
Rockies 7, Astros 5 
Todd Helton homered and pinch-hitter Mark Sweeney had a two-run single, leading Darren Oliver and the Colorado Rockies over the Houston Astros 7-5 Wednesday night. 
The loss trimmed Houston's lead over the Chicago Cubs to a half-game in the NL Central. Chicago defeated the Mets 2-0. 

Houston had its four-game winning streak snapped but still has won 10 of 13. Colorado ended a three-game losing skid. 
Charles Johnson homered off Brad Lidge in the eighth for the Rockies, and Chris Stynes added an RBI double. 
Oliver (12-11) allowed nine hits and two runs -none earned -in 5 2-3 innings. He helped his cause with an RBI single. 
Ron Villone (6-5) went 4 1-3 innings, allowing seven hits and five runs with three walks and a season-high eight strike­outs. 

Brewers 7, Cardinals 6 
Jason Conti drove in a career­high five runs, including a go­ahead single in the ninth inning that helped the Milwaukee Brewers rally past the St. Louis Cardinals 7-6. Wednesday night. 
Pinch-hitter Brooks Kieschnick tied it with a two­run homer off Cardinals closer Jason Isringhausen, who blew a 6-4 lead in the ninth. The loss dropped St. Louis 5 1/2 games behind first-place Houston in the NL Central -the Astros played later at Colorado. 
Isringhausen (0-1) failed for the third time in 21 save oppor­tunities. 
Keith Osik led off the ninth with a walk. With one out, Kieschnick, a relief pitcher who is a former outfielder, hit an 0­1 pitch into the right-field seats to tie it. It was the second homer Isringhausen has allowed this year. 
Scott Podsednik then walked and stole second. Conti fol­lowed with an RBI single .up the middle. 
Leo Estrella (7-3) pitched two scoreless innings for the win. Dan Kolb worked the ninth, earning his 19th save. 
The Brewers snapped a four-game losing streak. Milwaukee had lost its previous five games against the Cardinals and have won three of 13 meetings this season. 

St. Louis tagged Milwaukee starter Ben Sheets for five runs on six hits and a walk in the third inning. All the runs scored afte.r there were two outs. 
Cardinals starter Garrett Stephenson, who pitched six innings, led off with a single and advanced to third on a sin­gle by Fernando Vina, starting for the first time in three games after sitting out with a sore Achilles' heel. 

Marlins 11, Phlllies 4 
First, Jeff Conine came through with a clutch hit. Then, he did it with his glove and later with his arm. 
Conine homered, drove in three runs and made two out­standing defensive plays in left field, leading the Florida Marlins to an 11-4 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Wednesday night. 
The Marlins increased their NL wild-card lead to 1 1/2 games over the Phillies. The teams play again at Veterans Stadium on Thursday and have a three-game series in Florida next week. 
"He won the game for us," winning pitcher Mark Redman said of Conine. "He was out­standing."

AMERICAN LEAGUE 


Rogers lifts Twins over Sox 

Associated Press 

MINNEAPOLIS -Kenny Rogers helped the Minnesota Twins close in im a three-game sweep of the Chicago White Sox. 
Rogers (12-8) allowed two runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings, and Michael Ryan homered as the defending AL Central champs beat the White Sox 4-2 on Wednesday night. 
The win put Minnesota 2 1/2 games ahead of Chicago, which will try to avoid a sweep Thursday night at the Metrodome. 
Rogers struck out three and walked none in his first win since Aug. 21. Eddie Guardado pitched the ninth for his 37th save in 40 chances. 
Luis Rivas went 2-for-3 with an RBI, a walk and scored two runs for the Twins, who won their fourth straight over the White Sox in front 40,304 Homer Hankey-waving fans. 
Mariners 5, Rangers 1 
The Seattle Mariners got the kind of well-pitched game 
on six hits Wednesday night to lead 

Tampa Bay to a 7-0 victory and 
shrink Boston's lead in the wild­
card race. 
"You definitelv want to beat 
teams like the Devil Rays," Red 
Sox second baseman Todd 
Walker said. "But it's major 
league baseball. We're not play­
ing church softball. You can't 
hang up four wins in a row just 
because you're playing the Devil 
Rays." 
Indians 9, Royals 1 
The silence in the Kansas City 
Royals' clubhouse was a clear 
indicator of how important this 
loss was. 
After winning four straight, 
the Royals lost to the Cleveland 
Indians 9-1 on Wednesday night 
and fell 4 1/2 games behind 
Minnesota in the AL Central 
race. 

"Every time we lose, it's quiet 
in here," Royals starter Paul 
Abbott said. 
"It's a somber mood. However, 
if we win tomorrow, we win the 
series. Our mindset is to win 
every series and to go from 
there." 
When Royals manager Tony 
Pena was asked if the loss took 
the wind out of their sails, the 
normally upbeat manager 
replied, "What do you think?" 
Jake Westbrook scattered four 
hits over six-plus innings, and 
Travis Hafner and Alex Escobar 
homered as the Indians ended a 
four-game losing streak. 
Jody Gerut hit a two-run sin­gle and Jhonny Peralta also drove in two for Cleveland. 
The Royals quietly watched in the clubhouse as the 1\vins beat Chicago 4-2, dimming Kansas City's hopes of reaching the postseason for the first time since its World Series title in 1985. 
Westbrook (7-9) allowed one run and struck out four in 6 1-3 innings. All of his outs were either on groundouts or strike­outs. 
He shut down a Royals lineup that averaged nine runs per game during their winning streak. 
Westbrook is 1-1 with a 1.49 ERA in nine career outings against Kansas City.

Seattle ended a three-game losing streak and moved within 1 1/2 games of Boston in the AL wi~d-card race. The Red Sox lost 7-0 to Tampa Bay Wednesday.

Associated Press PITTSBURGH Pittsburgh Steelers line­backer Joey Porter returned to practice Wednesday, only 2 1/2 weeks after being injured in a drive-by shooting in Denver. W~en Porter was shot by an unknown assailant in a nightclub parking lot Aug. 31 following the Colorado State-Colorado game, the Steelers esti­mated he could miss as much as half the season. Instead, he is expected to play Sunday in Cincinnati after sitting out only two games. ''I'm just haj)py to go out 
there and have a chance to do what I love doing, and that's play football," Porter said Wednesday. "To be able to do it 20 days after what happened is actually amazing." 
The bullet grazed Porter's buttocks and lodged in his right thigh before being surgically removed. Doctors said the threat of infection and the possibility that scar tissue might form around tbe wound made it difficult to predict how long Porter would be out. 
However, doctors told Porter the wound began healing immediately and without complications. 
IN BRIEF 

2007 Sup~r Bowl to be 
held in Miami 
WASHINGTON -The 2007 Super Bowl was awarded to Mia.J;lli on Wednesday by NFL owners. 
The owners ·ratified a ·d('cision made last spring to hold the game at Pro Player Stadium. 
·''Miami sells itself," Dolphins: or~si­dent Eddie Jones· said. "We've got everything a city would want to put in a proposal." 
Miami has hosted the Super Bowl eight times (1968,'69, '71, '76, '79, '89, '95 and '99), fewer than only New Orleans (nine times). 
Houston will host this season's Super Bowl on Feb. 1 and next sea­son's game will be in Jacksonville. Detroit will host the game,in 2006. 
The site of the 2008 Super Bowl will ,be decided at owners' meetings in Chicago on Oct. 29-30. The con­tenders are Arizona, Tampa, Washington and New York-New Jersey. 
That has allowed him to return almost as quickly as was possible with such an injury. 
Porter said it is impor­tant for him to practice well this week so that he can get ready to play at game speed again. 
"As far as running straight and cutting, any­body can go out there and do that -that's not play­ing football," said Porter, who practiced with the starting defense. "I've got to find out what I can do taking on a double team block or having to cover somebody or wrapping up and making a tackle." 
Porter is hoping his 
return will provide a lift to a defense that allowed Kansas City's Priest Holmes to rush for 122 yards and three touch­downs in the Chiefs' 41-20 victory Sunday. The Steelers were No. 1 against the run the last two seasons but are 23rd overall two games into the season. 
"I just want to go out there and put what hap­pened behind me and get back to playing football and, after that, just try to get this team going," Porter said. "When you watch from the sidelines, you can't be a part of that and it hurts." 
The owners also were expected to approve the continuation of NFL Europe at Wednesday's meeting. 
Colts struggling to sell 
tickets 
INDIANAPOLIS -The Indianapolis Colts are again racing against the clock to sell tickets. 
The team has until noon Thursday to avoid its fourth local television blackout in five games at the RCA Dome. Team officials said Wednesday that 6,200 tickets remained. 
Ray Compton, senior vice president of sales and marketing, said that the Colts received many complaints about last Sunday's game against Tennessee being blacked out on TV after the was sold out after the dead­line. 
So the team is holding a marathon sales effort, running 17 hours from 5 
p.m. Wednesday until the noon dead­line or until all the tickets are sold. 

The Colts have sold out 34 consec­utive regular season home games, dating to Dec. 27, 1998 when they completed their second straight 3-13 season. 
''Quite honestly, we have a big hill to climb and perhaps it is very unlikely that we will sell out the game before the blackout deadline," Compton said. "We will be armed and ready to sell our fans tickets." 
Penguins postpone game 
PITTSBURGH -Amid predictions that Hurricane Isabel could hit the state with soaking rains and heavy winds, the Pittsburgh Penguins post­poned Thursday night's NHL presea­son game with the Washington Capitals. 
The game, to be played in Wilkes­Barre, Pa., has been pushed back to Sunday. 
The Penguins are still scheduled to play the New York Islanders on Friday night in Wheeling, W.Va.

Adrian halts Belles' win streak 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
The Belles lost in straight sets Wednesday, but their coach doesn't think the score tells the whole story. 
"I just feel like we beat our­selves," coach Julie Schroeder­Biek. "The problem was that we dug ourselves big holes and then couldn't get back out of them." 
Saint Mary's (8-5, 1-3 MIAA) fell to conference opponent Adrian (7-4, 2-1) on the road by a score of 20-30, 27-30, 32-30. The loss breaks the Belles' four­game winning streak, which began on Sept. 11 at home against Rochester. 
This loss was especially tough to take for the Belles, because their coach believes Adrian had a fe\'\; chinks in its armor, but the Belles were never able to capital­ize. 
Schroeder-Biek said a large portion of the problem stemmed from a sub-par passing game, which has typically been a strength for the team. 
"Today our passing game was real down," she said. "We should have been all over Adrian's defense. Their middle blockers weren't that good, and there were other holes in their defense, but because we couldn't pass we weren't able to capital­ize." 
Despite lousy offensive play overall, the Belles still had a few individual standouts. 
Freshman outside hitter Kristen Playko continued her consistent rookie campaign by leading the team with 14 kills. Middle hitter Elise Rupright added 10 kills while also adding three blocks. 
On the defensive side, defen­sive specialist Alison Shevik led the team with 14 digs and libero Ann Cusack added 11 digs. Setter Lauren Temple had 27 assists. 
A key goal for Saint Mary's coming into the game was to stop Adrian's vaunted middle attack. Schroeder-Biek said her team had mixed results concern­ing that goal. 
"I don't feel as though we were completely successful in that goal," she said. "[Their middle attack] didn't hurt as much as it could have but it was not our best match by any means." 
The Belles went down by a 
' score of 13-2 in the second game at one point, but were able to battle back and make it close. In the third game, Saint Mary's and Adrian went neck-and-neck before the Bulldogs finally got the crucial final points to send tl:e Belles home with the loss. "It was just little mistakes here and there," Schroeder-Biek sa.id. "We kept making the same mis­takes again and again." Saint Mary's will try to regroup as they move into a crucial point in their schedule. The Belles have three straight games at home against conference foes.

"I can kind of understand what the quarterbacks are going through, even though I didn't really get into any games while I was a quarterback here," Clark said. "It's tough when you've got people in your face all the time, and it's tough wheil people are hitting you every time you release the ball." 
Even with his solid numbers in the early Irish season, Clark realizes that he still has a long way to go in his development of becoming a complete tight end. 
"I think I have a long way to go before I peak," he said. "There is still a lot of things I can be better at, and hopefully I am getting better as we go."

Experimentation with offense pays off versus Purdue 
By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN Sports Wri[er 
When the Irish put the ball away, most teams follow. Wednesday's match was no dif­ferent, as the Irish hit .311 for the match, and Purdue left bat­tered and bruised. 
Notre Dame defeated Purdue three games to one (30-23, 30­17, 29-31, 30-20). 
"We tried to diversify the offense a little more and worked on some different shots," head coach Debbie Brown said. "We tried to hit more lines and more deep corners." 
Emily Loomis, Lauren Kelbley and Lauren Brewster all hit in double digits for the Irish. Loomis had 15 kills on .405 hit-· ting, while Kelbley registered 14 kills on .414 hitting. Brewster added 13 kills on .429 hitting. Meg Henican and Jessica Kinder also contributed, with eight kills apiece. 
The Irish dominated in games one and two, hitting .455 as a team in the second game. 
The Irish never trailed in the first game, as the closest the Boilermakers came was a 10-10 tie. In game two, the Irish jumped out ~o an 18-9 lead. They never turned back, as Purdue never got within nine points. 
Game three was a different story, as the Irish hit .160 and the Boilermakers hit .218, good enough to take the match. 

\, 
"We played really smart and

really well in games one and two," Brown said. "In game three, we didn't pass quite as.

well, we didn't serve quite as well and . we made hitting errors." 
Game three saw the Irish fal­ter, as they couldn't pull away from the Boilermakers. The game was back and forth, and the Irish failed to convert match point at 29-28. Purdue took advantage, and scored the next three points to win the game. 
"I think it was a combination of a lot of things," Brown said. "We didn't really play well, and we made a lot more hitting errors." 
Overall, the Irish played well. Senior setter Kristen Kinder dished out 35 assists, and Henican led the defense with 15 digs. Jessica and Kristen Kinder both had 13 digs.  
Kelly Corbett saw action in the third game as libero, replacing freshman Danielle Herndon. Herndon returned in the fourth game. 
"She's (Corbett) been playing really well in practices and we thought it would be good to give her the opportunity to play," Brown said. 
Notre Dame is happy to get the win after last year's disappoint­ing loss in West Lafayette.

New season, new attitude 
Confident Irish host Hoo.siers in anticipated rematch 

By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 
Notre Dame played at Indiana in the adidas/IU Credit Union Classic. Indiana competed at Notre Dame in the Mike Berticelli Memorial Tournament. 
The Irish and Hoosiers, 
however, still have not met head-to­h e a d . Thursday night at Alumni Field, in the rematch of a second­round 2002 N C A A Tournament 
battle,  the  
rivals  will  
clash.  

FOOTBALL 

No. 19 India.na (2-2-2) has the edge, having won last season in the NCAA Tournament by a slim 1-0 margin. Freshman Brian Plotkin put in his first goal of the season and the Hoosiers held on to advance to the next round. Clark and the Irish remember the loss, but they do not let it haunt them. 
"Last year is long gone. They are a different team and we are a different team, but Td be telling lies ifI said /U-Notre Dame wasn't a big game.,,

Dame (2-1-2) is not only fighting Indiana this week­end. They are fighting histo­ry, with an all-time 2-18-1 record against the perennial Mid western powerhouse. Even more remarkable is this 
statistic -13 of those losses were shufouts. 
Notre Dame forward Devon Prescod has scored three of the team's folir goals so far this season, with midfielder Justin Detter adding the other ir1 a 2-1 overtime victo­ry over Fresno State.

"I am not CIJncerned [with 
our offense]." Clark said. "It is always a concern to score goals. I don't care who you play against. At the same time, over the years Indiana has been a very strong team." Indiana's strength has been

Tight end Jared Clark rumbles ahead In the 38-0 loss to Michigan Jast Saturday. Clark leads all Irish receivers with 67 yards receiving on the season. 
By CHRIS FEDERICO 
Sports Writer 
Quick, name the player who leads the Irish in receiving yards through two games this season. 
Would you believe tight end Jared Clark? 
Are you serious, Clark? 
Neither senior leader Omar Jenkins, star sophomores Rhema McKnight or Maurice Stovall, nor freshmen phe­noms Jeff Samardzija or Chinedum Ndukwe have been able to surpass the converted quarterback Clark's mark of 67 yards receiving. 
In addition, Clark's six receptions on the year place him in a tie for second on the team with McKnight and one behind Jenkins.

Belles take second on weekend 
ByJOE HETTLER Sports Editor 

It took a record-breaking per­formance, but Hope beat Saint Mary's again. 
The Belles finished behind Hope for the second straight tournament, taking second at the Briton Invitational with a score of 345. Hope's team fired a 343, a new tournament record, to win the Invitational at The Medalist Golf Club in Marshall, Mich. 
"We definitely improved a lot from last year at this course," Belles coach Mark Hamilton sa.id. "It's a difficult golf course, one of the hardest we'll play this season. 
Saint Mary's was led by junior Julie Adams' 85, followed by Stefanie Simmerman's 86. Hamilton was pleased that his six top players fired rounds in the 80s and placed in the top 10 for the tournament. 
While the Belles were consis­tent, Hope won despite having a player shoot 119. The Flying Dutch were led by frrst and sec­ond place finishers Lacey Wicksall and Holly Sneller, who shot 79 and 83, respectively. 
''I'm a little bit concerned we were behind Hope," Hamilton said. "We need to beat them in the next couple of tournaments. But it's good to have a team that drives you." 
Last week Hope took second­place ahead of the fourth-place Belles at the Knox Invitational. 
Hamilton said the Belles had a chance to win the tournament Tuesday, but had a couple high scores on holes late in the round, allowing Hope to hang on for the victory. 
Saint Mary's has continued to get solid play from Chrissy Dunham and Megan Mattia. While Dunham did not have her best round at The Medalist, she has consistently fired solid rounds. Hamilton credits the hard work Dunham put in over the summer for her improve­ment. 
"She's made a partly quantum leap," Hamilton said. "She worked hard at her game over the summer and is seeing the results from that hard work." 
Meanwhile Mattia has arguably been the most consis­tent player on the team. She had an 87 Tuesday. 
"Megan always shoots a score we can count on," Hamilton said.
