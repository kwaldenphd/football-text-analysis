Phone Calls Deluge NBC 
NEW YORK (UPI) Protesting telephone calls and telegrams poured into the National Broadcasting Co. NBC headquarters Monday because it cut off the clinching minutes of an American Football League game to telecast a dramatization of "Heidi." 
A spokesman for the network said approximately I 0,000 calls were received Sunday night from viewers an~ered by the switch from the Oakland Raiders-New York Jets game to the Swiss Alps with 65 seconds of playing time yet to go. In that time Oakland scored two touchdowns to win by a score of 43-32. 
Gladieux 
Co-leader 
InState 

INDIANAPOLIS (UPI)-Bob Gladieux of Notre Dame and Mike Wood of Anderson are tied for 1968 Indiana college football scoring honors but the title apparently won't be decided until next week when the Irish invade Southern California. 
Gladieux scored twice against Georgia Tech last Saturday, giving him 13 touchdowns and 78 points for the season to tie Wood (or first place. Wood, undisputed leader last week, scored only once against Taylor in his last game of the season. 
Keith Gerbers of Franklin held down third spot with 75 points on I 0 touchdowns and 15 extra points and it'll take quite an explosion for defending state scoring champ Leroy Keyes of Purdue to regain top honors. 
Keyes, the major college scoring champion last year with 114 points but not at full strength due to injuries the last few weeks, failed to score in the Boilermakers' 9-0 win at Michigan State, leaving him tied for fourth place with Indiana State's Bob Brumfield and Ron Furniss of Earlham. Each has 66 points. 
Of the three, only Furniss added to his total last weekend, scoring twice against Indiana Central. 
Scott Hempel, Notre Dame's stellar place kicker, was seventh with 57 points, including five field goals. Eighth was Jim Nolton of Taylor with 54 points and Mike Woodard of Evansville, who did not play in his season finale against Murray State, and Steve Schmid of Indiana State were tied for ninth place with 52 points apiece. 
Bowl lineup 
The lineup for the four major post-season bowl games was nearly finalized with a series of announcements yesterday. Here's how it looks:
