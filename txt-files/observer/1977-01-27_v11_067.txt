Cost too great 
Cable TV proposal rejected 
by Barbara Breitenstein News Editor 

The Student Government propo­sal to install cable television (CATV) on campus has been set aside by University officials prim­arily due to . its high cost and possible distractive effects. 
In a letter to Student Body President Mike Gassman, Fr. Theodore Hesburgh. University president. explained that the deci­sion was made because the Univer­sity does not have enough funds to finance the project at this time. However. he indicated the .idea is still open for consideration. 
"We generally agreed it was a good idea ... Hesburgh stated yes­terday. "but the cost is too great at this time." 
INDIANAPOUS AP -Most of Indiana ground to a halt yesterday as an afternoon blizzard with winds gusting up to 42 miles per hour swept across the state. 
The high winds kept Gov. Otis R. Bowen from attending a Merril­lville Chamber of Commerce din­ner. Officials said drifting snow made it impossible for Bowen's :-Jane to land. 
By mid afternoon state police were urging citizens to stay off the roads because blowing snow was drifting thoroughfares shut faster than highway department crews could clear them. 
By early evening northwestern portions of Interstate 65, I-80, U.S. 31, U.S. 41, and U.S.136 were closed as visibility fell to near zero in some sections. 
Schools and government offices in Lake and Newton counties were closed by noon after the storm moved into northwestern INdiana. Weather officials issued a travelers advisory for all of Indiana yester­day night and predicted two to four inches of new snow in the north­west corner of the state. 
In one section of central Indiana, 

Hesburgh also noted that the presence of CATV on campus might be disruptive to study habits and would detract from the ''per­sonal'' atmosphere at Notre Dame. He explained that the University prides itself on the personal rela­tionships between students and faculty and added that broadcas­ting classes on cable TV would destroy that atmosphere. 
Gassman will reply to Hes­burgh' s letter, and present it to the University president this week. Gassman's letter will stress the system's benefits to the University and will explain the system more clearly. 
"I'm sorry to see that he (Fr. Hesburgh) was opposed to it," Gassman said. "We didn't define the advantages and the system well 
including Wabash county and por­tions of Grant, Huntington and Miami counties, state highway officials admitted defeat to the high winds about 6:30 p.m. Officials closed roads in the area and ordered all state equipment back to the garage. 
The National Guard Armory in Rensselaer was opened to stranded motorists and students from rural 
Jasper County. 
State police posts around the state reported a rash of accidents, including a seven-car pileup that injured at least two persons on U.S. 31 north of Indianapolis in Hamil­ton County. 
They said many highways were littered with trucks and cars that were mired in drifts. 
Weather officials predicted winds would decrease \0 arouna 15 miles per hour early Thursday morning, but temperatures also were expected to plunge. 
The extended outlook called for lows of 10 to 15 below zero being the low for Monday. Highs for the period won't reach above 10 on Saturday and Sunday with a high of 20 expected Monday. 
enough. I guess." 
The proposal, which was origin­ally presented to the Student Life Council last November. calls for the installation of a "closed loop" CATV system. This type of system would cost approximately $500,000 and could broadcast both educa­tional and entertainment program­ming on a possible 28 channels with only one input from Valley Cablevision. 
CATV would provide certain advantages, according to the pro­posal, including the broadcast of educational programs such as class lectures, facilities for communica­tions studies in broadcasting. a closed circuit security system, bet­ter reception of both local and Chicago television stations, and usage by WSND as a license-free stereo station. 
"I don't think the entertainment 
part will outweigh the educational 
advantages," Gassman remarked. 
"And I don't think it will destroy 
the atmosphere of the University. 
The educational possibilities will 
far outshine the entertainment 
aspect." 
"I think the problem." Gassman 
continued, "is that you shouldn't 
look at the cost first. You should 
look at the advantages and then 
find ways to get the money for it." 
According to the proposal, the 
cost of ·the system could be 
absorbed in a yearly student fee of 
$5 to $10 plus an input fee of about 
one dollar per month for each 
student using the system. This 
assessment would pay the installa­
tion cost in about ten years. 
However, Hesburgh stated that 
this fee would be too much of an 
additional burden on parents al­
ready paying high educational 
costs. He also said the University 
has other expenses now which 
exclude the CATV project. 
"The proposal might have been 
slightly ahead of its time,'' explain­
ed Vice-President for Business 
Affairs Thomas J. Mason. "The 
biggest concern is cost. It is terribly 
expensive and we don't have the 
resources for it now." 
"The University is also commit­ted to personal contact of faculty with students" Mason continued. ''Anything that would detract from that would not be favorable. The drawback is in relation with the uniqueness of the campus. It would be a major change for a campus like 
ours," he said. 
Mason also commented on the 
possible disruptiveness of cable TV 
"Another concern is about whether 
there's a need for additional recre­
ational outlet along with other 
ac.dvities on campus." 
Mason agreed the system has 
potential, but that cable television 
on campus would have to wait until 
"things change and the cost comes 
down substantially. When the cost 
is low enough," he said, "then it 
can another item of priorities." 
"We're not saying an absolute 
no," Mason concluded. "It's just 
that we don't feel its time has 
arrived.'' 
Gassman. however, stressed the 
need for beginning the project now. 
"It is valuable in the present," he 
explained, "not in the future. The 
longer it is put off, the longer it will 
take to begin implementation and

A proposed Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) regulation to tax tuition remission scholarships grwted to college professors by thEir schools has been stopped aft·~r strong opposition from the acc:.demic community. 
:rames Robinson, professor of English and president of the Notre Dame chapter of the American As:>ociation of University Profes­sors (AAUP), stated he received a letter from AAUP Director of Government Relations Alfred D. Sumberg informing him that the proposed regulations appear to be dead now. 
Ihe Commissioner of Internal Revenue announced at a hearing on Jan. 7 that he would not sign the proposed regulations, but would leave them to his successor for disposal. 
Tuition remission plans for facul­ty ~~hildren and spouses have been accepted as nontaxable by the IRS and Congress since 1954. The 
proposed change would have rede­fin,~d these scholarships as a taxable compensation. Tuition benefits. because they are awarded sol ~ly on the grounds of where the parent is employed. are a form of fringe benefit, the IRS proposal declared. 
The proposal was expected to 
have the most serious impact on 
private colleges, which rely on the 
tuil:ion waiver plan to attract faculty 
members at salaries much lower 
than what they could earn else­
where the AAUP reported. 
In a letter to the IRS commis­
sioner last December, the Notre 
Dame AAUP argued that tuition 
remission provides educational op­
portunities that benefit the stu­
dents involved and is not actually a 
cor~pensation for services rendered 
by the faculty members. Faculty 
members whose children are grant­
ed scholarships do not render any 
more services than other faculty 
members. 
The IRS proposal was also criti­
cized by the AAUP as being 
prejudicial to an isolated group, 
sin~e similar fringe benefits in 
other professions go untaxed. 
Airhne employees do'lot pay taxes on their free trips, department store employee discounts are not taxed and neither are reductions or waivers for legal or medical ser­vices rendered by one lawyer or doctor to another, claimed the National Educational Association in testimony presented to the IRS commissioner before the IRS hear­ings early this month. 
AA UP national officials attri­buted much of their success to vocal opposition from the academic community and effective "grass­roots" campaigns against the pro­posal. Opposition to the bill was presented by national organiza­tions of college administration and faculty, as well as by members of Congress. 
Those who worked to defeat the 
proposal were also concerned that 
the IRS was attempting to change 
Congressionally-accepted policy on 
its own. "You are changing policy, 
changing a matter of public policy, 
a change we feel inappropriate for 
an agency to make arbitrarily and 
independently of our elected repre­
sentatives in Congress.'' the Notre 
Dame AAUP chapter charged in its 
letter to the IRS commissioner. 
Aside from the direct detrimen­
tal effect upon professors and their 
children, the long-range implica­
tions of a change in the status of 
tuition remission plans troubled 
many educators at Notre Dame. 
"It's the ultimate effect on educa­
tion I worry about." Robinson 
stated in an Observer article on 
Dec. 8. "The more expanding of 
and tampering with the fundamen­
tal idea of what a scholarship is will 
affect those who receive scholar­
ships. To me. that's more impor­
tant than the fringe benefit idea." 
Robinson yesterday expressed 
relief that the proposal had not 
gone through. "I think it was 
important that this should be in 
effect stopped," he said. adding 
that he did not think the IRS should 
tamper with Congressionally­
defined concepts. 
A change in the accepted defini­tion of this particular type of scholarship would have left the door open for possible changes in the definitions of other types of scholarships, Robinson explained.

Bogan stated that the main thrust behind the forum was to define the roles of the R.A.'s and the hall staff to get a better idea of their purpose and responsibility to Howard. "One of the things we were ranked low on in our annual survey," Bogan said, "was innova­tion. We're now working for an increase in support and community spirit, with an emphasis on public friendship among members of the hall." 
According to Bogan, Howard has six different commissions, on which about 20 residents take part altogether. The Academic-Cultural Commission, says Bogan, "has come away from just administering the test file," taking charge in bringing speakers such as Digger Phelps and Rick Wohlhuter to Howard. Community Services and the Religious Commission also have a new-found importance in the hall. The Athletic Commission has taken charge of setting up an intra-hall putting tournament, at­tracting over a third of the Howard residents, and is busy planning "war games" between the various sections of Howard. Howard's other commissions are the Social Commission and the Hall Improve­ments Commission. 
Bogan stresses that the goal of the various activities is mainly to get the residents of Howard out to meet each other. "We have to realize that this is the only time in

Laundroma1: location is tentative 

-~---~---------­
The laundromat for male stu­dents will most likely be located on the first floor of Badin Hall, according to the Assistant Vice President for Bossiness Affairs, Bro. Kieran Ryan. 
The Badin location has not been finalized, however, and Ryan and Vice president for Student Affairs Bro. Just Paczesny, are still looking for other locations. Ryan, who is responsible for the operation of the Ia undry service cited the lack of available space on campus as the reason the decision has been delayed. 
If the Badin location is used, the current tenants of the first floor must be relocated, and another building must be renovated for their use, according to Thomas Mason, vice-president for Business

Tidball has researched and writ­ten about post graduate achieve­ment of women from single-sex colleges. She is a native of Indiana and is currently a professor of physiology at the George Washing­ton University Medical Center. 
Tidball's studies comparing women from coeducational institu­tions with those from all-women colleges have been published in the latest Carnegie report, and emp­hasize the correlation between the number of women on a college faculty with the number of excep­tional achievers from that institu­tion. 
"'As a women's college whose faculty is 53o/o female. we are pleased with her decision to deliver our commencement address this year." stated St. Mary's College President John M. Duggan. "In this era of pervasive coeducation." he continued. "Elizabeth Tid­ball's research is reassuring to those of us who believe in the aims of women's education."

Reps to choose director

A special committee, composed of four faculty members and seven students has been formed to search for a St. Mary's Athletic Director to supervise the Athletic Center next fall. The position will be included in the Department of Student Affairs. 
·'The committee is weighted with sophomores and juniors since they'll be the ones working with the new director." Stevie Wernig, assistant dean of Student Affairs, stated. 
The faculty members of the committee include Wernig. Kath­leen Rice, dean of Student Affairs; Mary Lou Thompson, St. Mary's physical education instructor; and Tom Kelly. head baseball coach at

Kyan mdicated that a residence hall could not be used for the facility since it would have to be open 24 hours, posing security and privacy problems in a dorm. 
The proposed location of the machines in the vacant laundry pickup area in the basement of Keenan and the basement of LaFortune were ruled out as possi­bilities because they were below gmund, said Mike Gassman, stu­dent body president. He added that space will not be available in St. Michael's laundry for more than a year, so that area was eliminated from consideration. 
Once the final location of the laundry is determined work will begin on the installation of the plumbing, sewer lines, and 220 volt electrical lines. The washers and dryers can be installed immediately once this is completed, said Mason. "There will be no substantial

Pardon and ND 
Pre.;;ident Carter's pardon of the Viet­nc.m-era draft resisters and evaders is a noble step toward reuniting the country after the divisive disaster in Vietnam. It is also an action in which Notre Dame, especially Fr. Hesburgh, played a major role . ... Opinion about the war is still as divided as it is deeply held; this will be the case for years. But differing beliefs about the rightness or wrongness of the war need not lead to differing beliefs about the correct­ness of the pardon. 
It is either an act of justice or of mercy. If the first, it is long overdue. If the second, America is certainly big enough to be magnanimous towards those who especi­ally suffered, for whatever reason, from a national disaster. 
Carter follows and expands upon pardon precedents set after other wars by Presi­dents lincoln, Andrew Johnson, Harding, Coolidge (hardly a flaming radical), Roose­velt and Truman. Even the Confederate soldiers--who were technically guilty of the treasonous act of "levying war against the United States"--were pardoned or not piT'secuted in the interests of re-uniting the nation "with malice toward none, with charity towards all." Fr. Hesburgh deserves great credit for his role in Ca·i.er's pardon. He served on President :-oro's Clemency Board but thought that program insufficient, so he set up a study here at Notre Dame of the amnesty problem. 'fhe study was headed by Lawrence Baskir and William Straus who had worked with him on the Clemency Board. Baskir and Straus worked closely with the Notre Dame Civil Rights Center and made use of N.D. survey and computer facilities. 
Hesburgh personally delivered the re­sults of the extensive study to Carter last November. According to Hesburgh, the Notre Dame study "conditioned" the President-elect's decision. Carter's action last week was in accord with about 90 percent of the recommendations regarding civilians (He did not go along with suggestions to pardon deserters or civil­ians who had committed acts of civil disobedience in protest against the war.) 
Whether or not Carter extends his pardon after further study, any official amnesty can at best be only be one step toward putting Vietnam behind us. As the Notre Dame study notes, real reconcilia­tion depends on the compassion of the American people toward both those who ran afoul of the law and those veterans who served their country in Vietnam. It is time to move on.

of fasting 
Dear Editor: 

As much as we appreciate Tues­day's (Jan. 25) editorial supporting our Wednesday night fasting pro­gram we must· respectively disa­gree with the claim that was made iu that editorial that it is the money raising that is of primary impor­tance in regard to the fasting. 
Without a doubt, th~-main purpose of this fasting is to provide an opportunity for Notre Dame students to experience some kind of a feeling of solidarity with the poor and the hungry throughout the world. We are trying to engender a genuine concern on campus for those less fortunate than ourselves; a concern which goes far beyond financial contribu­tions ar:d cannot be measured in terms of dollars and cents. 
Further. we as students should realize that the good which the relatively small amount of money raised through fasting can do can be wiped out many times over by a single policy initiative or non-initia­tive on the part of the government of the United States (e.g., present lack of 1.; .J. participation in a world foi!J reserve system.).

Dear Editor: 

In your last issue of the Observer 
of 1976, there appeared a letter 
written by Roy Bixby stating that I 
was responsible for the work done 
to allow freshmen to have cars on 
campus starting this semester. 

I would like to point out that this was the work of the entire Fresh­men Advisory Council. We, as a council, work at trying to get the opinions of the freshmen we repre­sent and then find ways of making their ideas a reality. The issue of the cars is just one example of how we can be successful at what we do. 
There are other unpublisized examples of how we do not succeed. However we do employ a method of working within the , \The following is the transcript ot 


a public affairs program recently · aired on WSND Radio. 
Title: "I WAS A TEENAGE 
PHONEBILLJUNKIE'" 
Announcer: The pathetic man 
you're about t0 hear is not an actor. 
He is an authentic trained neurotic. 
Student X: How does it begin? 
How does it begin for anyone? 
You're lonely ... first time away 
from home...Friday night and 
there's no one to talk to...and there 
over in the corner it sits. You've 
seen other people do it. 
I started out doing it just once, maybe twice a week...not very long ones, just a couple minutes. But then things went bad. I messed up a couple tests, my girlfriend left me, I was lonely. It was my first time away from home and ... l needed somebody. somebody to talk to. So I started calling more ... "Just a quick one,'" I would say,· ''to pep me up and help me study.'' Why didn't somebody stop me? 
I went crazy. I called everybody! Parents, relatives, friends, people I hadn't seen in years. My fifth grade teacher, her fifth grade 
teacher...the  weather  service  in  
Anchorage...  
Finally  my  roommate  tried  to  

help me. "Look," he said, "Sure maybe now it's just phone calls but you know you're going on to the harder stuff. Pretty soon it'll be telegrams or candygrams, who knows where it will stop!" 

Bl.tt It was too late, I was hooked... Excuse the pun. 
My habit was running a hundred .. .a hundred and fifty a month. I couldn't pay that...The phone com­
. pany wanted money! What could I tell them? 
Well, my roommate saw what it was doing to me...my habit. And finally. one day while I was gone. he took the telephone and flushed it all down the toilet. When I came back we fought. we had an argu­ment. I said I was leaving ... I left all my stuff except a bag of dimes and went to sleep in a phone booth. 
That nights. the worst night of my life. I tried to get to sleep and this clown kept calling the phone booth asking for Laura! I would tell him 'Tm not Laura! You got the wrong number!.. But he kept calling! And calling! I"ll never forget that ringing! 
Well. that did it. That morning I saw the light. I saw clearly what I had done, what a shables my life was... How immoral all those phone calls to Anchorage were ... 
There was nothing to do except commit myself to a post office. They helped me there. They got me started on postcards. Then let­ters... even got me a penpal. 
Now I"m straight. I won't even pick up a telephone. And I think I"m going to make it. .. I'm going 
back to school next semester and it's going to be hard but I"m going to make it ... I've got to.

The harsh winter has made it difficult for student motorists who face the problems of stalled cars in show-covered parking lots. 
Arthur Pears. director· of secur­ity. said the security organizationb realizes these problems and tries to adjust to the situation. 
"We began to clear the parking lots before the students returned from Christmas break, and finallv spent roughly $4000 to remove the snow." Pears said. 
Pears requested that the stu~ dents try to park in <:n orderly fashion even though all markings have been covered by a thick layer of ice and show. 
Pears also spoke of the problem of a student's auto stalling in the wrong lot and occasionally result­ing in parking violations depend upon how long the car has been stalled in the lot. 
"If the car has been stalled in the \\Tong lot for a short period of time, \\T trv to understand the situation and take care of it." Pears stated. 
He also said that if the auto has 
been there for .. t\\·o or three days." 
it i~ the students own responsibility 
to move the car. The Notre Dame 
campus has no facilities where a 
student can receive mechanical 
help. 

A student can deposit his ID at the security office to borrow a set of jumper cables. However. as Pears noted, "We have only one set of cables. and there is a big demand. Students often wait in line to borrow them." A student must therefore rely on nearby service stations for assistance with stalled autos. 
Retarded council judges success 
The ND-SMC Council for the Retarded will be evaluating the success of its Saturday morning recreation program tonight at 8:15 in the Library Auditorium. Possi­ble changes in format and needs for greater flexibility will be discussed.

There are also programs for students to participate in during the week. 
Any studerts interested in wor­king with the retarded members of the South Bend community are strongly encouraged to attend to­night's meeting.

Future attractions--Feature Artist Nights Album Hours The 21 oo Club 

by Marian Ulicny Senior Staff Reporter 
An introduction to the Trans­cendental Meditation (TM) pro­gram was given Tuesday night in Howard Hall by Tom Shirah, a full-time instructor of TM. 
Shirah outlined the benefits of the TM program to approximately 40 students. "It's a completely natural process and very easy to practice," he stressed. "It's a scientific technique, not a religion, which doesn't require belief. There's· no need to change your lifestyle to practice TM." 
According to Shirah, TM is "not a flashy experience." He stated he was almost disappointed when first introduced to the method because the immediate effects were not spectacular. "The reason people practice TM is not for the meditat­ing experience, but for the in­creased energy and the increased ability to create energy,'' he added. 
TM allows the body to gain a state of deep rest by eliminating accumulated stress and strain, Shirah stated. "Mental activities slow down and allow the mind to be quiet. Then the body rests, and the mind becomes alert,'' he ex­plained. 
''Over 300 independent scientific studies on TM have been con­ducted with good results,'' Shirah stated. Studies conducted on brain-wave patterns indicate an increase in the efficiency and orderliness of mental activity. In addition, intelligence tests given to high school students in the Nether­lands resulted in significantly higher scores by those students practicing TM. 
"TM helps you grow in intelli­gence more than twice as fast as in one not practicing it,'' Shirah stated. "Learning ability in­creases, and academic perform­ance improves." 
Terry Gwynn memorial mass to be offered 
A memorial mass for senior 
· Terry Gwvnn will be offered Thurs­day ·at 10.:30 p.m. in Sacred heart Church for all members of the Notre Dame Communitv. A second memorial mass wil be offered by Father Robert Griffin in the Farle~· Hall chapel. Monday at II p.m. · The Gwvnn family ask that instead of flowers con-tributions to Logan Center be made in Terry's name in care of the campus ministry office. 

''Although we generally only use 10 to 15 percent of our mental capacity, we can and should use more," Shirah added. "With TM, you can begin to use more of your mind." 
According to Shirah, TM also offers various physical benefits. Practicing the system rests the heart, provides a quicker recovery from such illnesses as strokes, helps normalize blood pressure and reduces oxygen consumption. Athletes using TM experience greater physical control and higher levels of performance, he added. 
"TM is valuable because of its practical aspects," Shirah stressed. "It develops the full potential of an individual, allowing what's in us to come out. Everyone has days when they feel really good and rested, but then there are other days that aren't so good. Why not feel great all the time?" 
Shirah stated TM can be called "the scientific basis for world peace." A sociological trend study in 500 cities showed that crime, sickness and accident rates de­creased when one percent of the city's population practiced TM. "With just one percent involved, negative tendencies decreased,'' Shirah noted. "TM affects the environment. You can't have a peaceful world without peaceful individuals. You can legislate for world peace for hundreds of years, but that doesn't necessarily work." 
Rob Carsello, a Notre Dame law student, provided a student's point of view on TM. "The point of TM is that you won't have reasonless anxiety which prevents you from acting in a normal way," he explained. "If you have a de­creased anxiety level, it won't be a burden to you to give someone a helping hand." 
"The effect of the TM program is not instant," Carsello added. "It doesn't happen all at once, and you won't get the complete benefits tomorrow. The total effect is a long-range program designed for regular practice." 
The lecture concluded with an audio-visual presentation on ath­letes and their reasons for using TM. 
Shirah became involved with TM in 1972 as an undergraduate at North Texas State University. He completed a 10-month teacher training course in the United States and France and has been an instructor for one year. Currently, he is a team teacher at the TM Center in the Marycrest Building in South Bend. 
Carsello has practiced TM for four years and is the founder of the Notre Dame chapter of the Stu­dents' International Meditation Society.

ND students observe inner city problems 
by Drew J. Bauer StaffReporter 

Standing in food lines, riding in a police car through the worst section oftown, sleeping in houses without heat, visiting legal aid offices and touring prisons were some of the things students did as part of ''The Urban Plunge" program during Christmas break. 
One hundred-sixty students un­dertook the program in 60 cities across the country "to try and orient themselves with the urban experience that was happening to the poor in their own home towns,'' according to one of the organizers of the program, Peggy Roach. 
"I think that the students learned what it meant to live an experience. They have read in booksabouthowthepoorliveanda about the people who try to help them. I think that this program lets the student feel what the poor go through. They experience it by spending 48 hours in places that th~f are not use. to." .

"I can understand why a big university has to be cost-oriented," he continued, "but there's a point when one can become to9 cost­oriented. This system opens a horizon which once open there's much more that could be done with it. No matter where they get the money, the parents have to pay for it eventually. I hate to see the idea die." ''I will never consider the matter closed," Gassman stated. 
Photo Club meets tonight 

The Notre Dame Photography Club welcomes new and old mem­bers this semester. Meetings will be today, Feb. 16, March 2, March 30, and April20. the agenda includes an exhibition and talk by advanced photography students, a kodalith demonst~;"ation, and meet­ing with portrait photographer Larry Cassel. The final meeting will be a group exhibition of 
members work. 
For further information call: Tim Krause (1182), Dave Lewis (1786), Sue Hart (6715), Pat Lennon or Bill Reifsteck (1209). 
The Photography Club will hold its first meeting of the semester on Thursday at 7p.m. in Room 114 of O'Shaughnessy Hall .. 
The decision to by-pass CATV at this time was made in December, a fter a discussion on the matter between all the university officers. Bro. Just Paczesny, vice-president for Student Affairs, would not comment on the decision, while other officials were not available for comment. 
NO Chorale performs Sunday 
The Notre Dame chorale will be featured in concert Sunday at 8:15 
p.m. in Washington Hall. Under the direction of Dr. David Clark Isele, they recently completed an eight day tour of the Northern Midwestern states. The Chorale will perform a wide variety of works ranging from Handel's Mes­siah to Broadway's Hit The Deck. Admission is Free. 
Pool tourney sign-ups 

Students interested in the LaFor­tune billiards tournament can sign up from 10';30 a.m. to 11 p.m. today through Monday in the poolroom. The tournament will begin Feb. 1 or 2 and run for about six weeks. There is no registration fee, but participants will pay for playing time.

''A lot of kids from Notre Dame live in the surburbs and are not exposed to the problems of the inner city and they should be awar~ ?fthe~. They would be better ctbzens tf they were." 
This is the third year for the "Urban Plunge" program founded by Fr. Don McNeil and operated in cooperation with the Catholic Com­munitv on Urban Ministry 
(CCUM). The students received one credit on a pass/fail system for completing the program, which consists of touring facilities of CCUM in several cities and attend· ing a series of introductory semi­
nars and debriefing meetings. The 
debriefing occurred last Monday 
night in the library auditorium. 
"There is no romance in the ghetto," said Fr. John Egan, chairman of CCUM at the meeting Monday night. "The ghetto is cruel, mean and unjust. We the people in the suburbs must join together to bring some peace and justice to these people." 
"The Urban Plunge was a call to action to you and to me. We must learn more so that we can solve the 
problems that face us. And I c~n only hope that next year we w~l
have over 500 students. But that ts up to you and more hard work,"
Egan continued. After Egan finished, the student 
leaders for each city presented the highlights of their plunges. After­
wards, they broke up into smaller parties at several faculty homes to continue discussion about their 
experiences.
"I didn't really know what to expect," said Professor Salvatore 
Bella. "But it was really fantastic. I was amazed how the students

were so much aware, so very profound. We discussed that this is our community -the rich and the poor. Bridges must somehow be built between the two. This is what the social workers are working on." Law Professor Thomas Shaffer headed another group to discuss what the students learned. 'I think that this experience has made a sobering impact on the students," Shaffer said. "Before, they really didn't know a lot about the inner city, even in the cities that they live outside of like so many other Notre 
Dame students." 
"But I think that they have come out of this with some hope. A hope that there might be a solution to 
these problems," he concluded. 
Both Shaffer and Bella thought that the program should be ex­panded to areas outside of Catholic 
programs in the inner city. "This should not be just the cause of one religious order," Bella said. "We are all part of a community, and all religious orders should be invol­ved." Roach said that they would like to have the program visit other 
places next year. "By next year, other programs by different orders should be set up in the inner city and we would like to go to those."
