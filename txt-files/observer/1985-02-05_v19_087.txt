In Brief 

The Official Soviet news agency Tass said 
Monday the Reagan administration's proposed military budget heralds a weapons build-up that will complicate U.S.-Soviet arms talks scheduled to open next month in Geneva. It carried three sepa· rate articles critical of the U.S. budget for fiscal 1986, including an attack on Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. Tass said his report outlining America's military spending showed he was intent on es­tablishing superiority over the Soviets.

College students susceptible during the 'cold and flu season' 
What is as much a part ofcollege life as e"ams, papers, parties and (for Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students) parietals? 
The answer is sickness. Whether a simple cold, the flu or something more serious, many students are faced with an illness which hampers all areas of a student's life, from studies to social life. And at this time of year, during the height of"cold and flu season," everyone is susceptible. 
I am not talking about the Black Plague or serious illness. Colds and flus are not very serious in the long run and we must deal with these minor illnesses for the rest ofour lives as we have dealt with them in the past. Yet the deadlines, lack ofsleep, communal living condi­tions, etc. of college life amplify our small illnesses and make us more run-down. We find ourselves backed into a corner. Not only our studies but also other aspects of our lives suffer. 
There are many reasons that students are especially likely to catch the flu bug. A lack of sleep is one obvious factor. No matter how well-

quick recovery. Preferably bed rest. 
The dilemma once again rears its ugly head. A few days of complete bed rest would do more than any medication. Yet as is the case with many students, I have enough obligations to keep me going despite my body's protestations. The flu just complicates things. 
I will try to avoid coughing on anyone or sharing a cup or can of soda. My caution might prevent a few people from getting the bug. Yet I'm certain someone will get the flu indirectly through me. After all, I got it 
from someone....

Yet despite any precautions we may take, one sick student soon becomes five or six. It is the few with espe­cially high resistance or good luck who are able to stay healthy. 
The flu bug is alive and well among my friends, despite our precautions. We are valiantly fighting. Un­fortunately the microbes are on the offensive. 
Yesterday I went to the Student Health Center. I had exhausted all of my home remedies. It was time to let the professionals take over. 
After a typical wait, I was examined by the doctor. His diagnosis was that I have influenza. He gave me medica­tion to be taken at intervals during the day anu assured me I would soon be well. He said rest would lead to a he if I was just anticipating

I'm becoming quickly exhausted and sleep looks inviting. After I do a little more work Ishould be ready for bed. Unless something else comes up. 
So here's a toast for anyone feeling under the wea­ther. Pop your vitamin C tablet, lift your orange juice glass high and remember humanity is mightier than the microbe.

251 accused in Italian 'trial of the century' 
Associated Press 
Naples, Italy -The trial of 251 suspected Camorra gang members and their alleged accomplices -in· eluding a nun and a priest -began yesterday with police sharpshooters on guard and the defendants incar· cerated in 20 cages in the court­room. 
.Extraordinary security measures were in effect in and around Naples' Poggioreale Prison, where a win­dowless courtroom WaS built for the trial, which court officials called Italy's largest criminal proceeding ever. 
Bomb-detecting dogs patrolled inner hallways and police sharpshooters were posted on roof­tops of buildings ringing the prison. Helicopters hovered over the area and lawyers and reporters were searched at the prison's gate. 
To protect admitted mobsters turned police informers, authorities beefed up prison security with an additional 800-man force. Two of the 20 courtroom cages were reserved for the gangsters who turned state's evidence, known as "pentiti." 
Yesterday's court session, dubbed "the trial of the century" by Neapolitan newspapers, is the first of three for 640 suspects arrested in the June 17, 1983, crackdown on the Nuova Camorra Organizzata. 
All defendants are charged with criminal association, a catch-all charge used to prosecute suspected gangsters. Some are also charged with drug trafficking and extortion, and some could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted. 
Only 153 of the defendants were present at yesterday's two-hour ses­sion. In Italy, defendants are not re­quired to attend their trials, but those who came were put in cages to prevent them from brawling amongst themselves. 
Some of the defendants screamed obscenities as they were led into the cages made of thick metal bars with spaces in between big enough for them to stick tlieir heads out. The prisoners can stand and walk in the cages, which are big enough to hold 1 5 to 20 people. 
The first day was spent hearing a variety of motions from defense at­torneys. The trial was adjourned un­til Thursday, and many of the defendants were returned to jail, where they are being held by aut­horities. 
Police say the Nuova Camorra Or­ganizzata is a major faction of the Naples underworld led by reputed crime kingpin Raffaele Cutolo, 42, who is now in jail. 
Authorities say the Camorra makes most ofits money from extor­tion, cigarette and drug smugglingin Italy. It is not considered as power­ful as the Sicilian Mafia, but has influ­ence throughout Italy and is reportedly involved in cocaine traf­ficking in South America. 
Cutolo has spent more than half his life in prison and is now serving a 10-year term on the island prison of Asinara for charges ranging from drug smuggling to extortion. Police claim he has been running crime operations from his cell. 
One of the accused, Sister Adina Murelli, 57, ofthe Naples convent of the Daughters ofthe Precious Blood, told reporters she had exchanged letters with Cutolo because she wanted "to save his soul." 
Police sources have said the let­ters contained coded messages from Cutolo to his followers.

Red Army launches new offensive 
Associated Press 
Bonn, West Germany-For more than a decade, the anarchist Red Army Faction terrorized Western Europe, emerging from under­ground hideouts to murder busines­smen and government officials and bomb U.S. Army bases. 
Now the shadowy terrorist group, largely dormant in the past four years, has launched a new offensive in its war against West German capitalism and U.S. "imperialism." 
The latest victim was prominent industrialist Ernst Zimmermann, 55, chairman of West Germany's giant

Federal investigators blamed the attack on the Red Army Faction, which had vowed to assassinate prominent West German figures in connection with a two-month hunger strike by imprisoned gang members. 
Thirty jailed Red Army Faction members and nine sympathizers began a protest fast in several West German prisons in early December, demanding to be housed together and treated as political prisoners. 
Since then, nearly 60 bomb and arson attacks have been directed against American, French and West German interests across the country, the Bonn Interior Ministry said, with more than 30 linked to Red Army activists. 
Five jailed gang members, includ­ing second-generation leaders Christian Klar and Brigitte Mohnhaupt, have abandoned the hunger strike, but several of those still fasting are in deteriorating health. German officials believe a death would trigger new violence. 
"We must be prepared for further terrorist attacks," Interior Minister Friedrich Zimmerman recently told a parliamentary committee on se. curity. 
The Red Army Faction, originally known as the Baader-Meinhof gang, was spawned in radical student circles in the late 1960s; its declared aim was to overthrow the West Ger­man state and expel American mili­tary and business interests from Europe. 
The gang developed into a ruth­less, efficient cadre who claimed re­sponsibility for 30 political slayings and scores of bombings and bank robberies.

Last month, the Red Army Faction announced a "military" alliance with Direct Action, the French urban guerilla group that claimed respon­sibility for the Jan. 25 assassination of Paris Defense Ministry official Rene Audran. 
The two terrorist groups said in a letter to Paris-based news organiza­tions that they would fight NATO and other "imperialist" institutions in Western Europe. 
But Bonn officials said that the Red Army Faction, while still a threat, is not as strong as it was throughout much of the 1970s, nor does itenjoy significantpopular sup­port. 
"There is no real sympathy for these people today," Interior Mini­stry spokesman Hans-Guenther Kowalski said. 
Officials say the two-month hunger strike is an attempt by the Red Army's "hard core" to recruit new members. 
Some of the hunger strikers are being force-fed to keep them alive. But the measure is so controversial that the West German parliament recently decided to halt force­feeding unless a prisoner loses con­sciousness. . 
Government security officials say the Red Army Faction's active sym­pathizers -those who can be counted on to smuggle messages out ofprisons or house terrorists on the run -number between 100 and 150 people. 
Between 20 and 30 active Red Army terrorists are still believed to be at large, according to Kowalski. 
Kowalski acknowledged some wanted Red Army suspects are "second-generation terrorists," or those too young to have been active in the early 1970s. 
"They have an ability to attract some new members, but it is a very weak and limited ability," he said.

Curriculum may alter 
By BOB VONDERHEIDE 
Edltor·ln·Cblef 
After a year of study, the ad hoc University Curriculum Committee last spring issued a 17-page analysis of the University core curriculum, proposing in some cases substantial changes in the current structure. 
llle University's core curriculum includes 13 courses, most of which are completed in the freshman year. Requirements of the individual col­leges are not part of the University curriculum and were not studied by the curriculum committee. 
The report of the curriculum committee is now in the hands ofthe Academic Council, which has dis­cussed the proposals twice includ· ing discussion at a meeting yesterday. (Related story, page 1.) 
After the council approves the report or makes amendments to it, the proposals wiii be voted upon by Notre Dame's Board ofTrustees. 
In its simplest formulations, the present University requirements and proposed changes are as fol­lows: 
Composition and Literature and Freshman Seminar, one se­mester each, satisfied l'n the fresh· man year. No change was recommended for this requirement.

cause the curriculum is overloaded 
already "despite the fact that the 
Navy needs engineers." 
Dean of Engineering Roger Schmitz argued, however, that "in a certain sense the overload does not work too great a difficulty since ROTC students, due to their finan· cial advantages, need not have a part-time job," according to the minutes report. 
At Hesburgh's suggestion, a sub­committee was established to come back to the council with a solution to the ROTC problem. 
On another matter, Dean of Sci­ence Francis Castellino argued that "students need more than one sci­ence course." The minutes also report that Castellino told the group that a language requirement is more important than the proposed re­quirement in the fine arts or literature. 
Hesburgh, according to the minutes, said that "the University should not waste valuable time on elementary language courses." Stu· dents, he said, were fully able to learn a language on their own. 
Schmitz "voiced his surprise that the proposed curriculum did not carry greater science and mathema­tics requirements," the minutes report. Castellino was asked if his college could offer more science courses to Arts and Letters students, and he "responded in the affirma­tive, and suggested a life science course." 
The proposed curriculum would retain the two-course requirement in math, but would allow students in Business and Arts and Letters two years to meet it. 
According to the minutes, "the mathematics department felt that the two courses should be taken in consecutive semesters for the pur· pose of continuity and student en­thusi~m. a sentiment which the Business College agreed." 
Music professor Calvin Bower "stressed that in allowing two years for the math requirement, the com­mittee's objective was flexibility." 
"Pedagogically, however, is it wise?" the minutes report. "The mathematics department says no."

sanctions against South Africa and declared that he has sent South African President P.K. Botha a telegram saying only "shape up or ship out." 
In dealings with Central America, he said his administration intends to treat people as human beings -not foreigners. 
He plans to develop "a human policy, not a foreign policy." His general attitude about Latin America is that "the days of meddling in our neighbors internal affairs are over." He announced that Jesse Jackson will be his secretary of state, which brought applause from the audi· ence. 
On the issue of dealing with the Soviets, Watson said, "I oppose the isolationist attitude of my predeces­sors." He plans to be in close com­munication with Chernenko, and believes he can cut the defense budget by 25 percent without decreasing America's strength. 
He then began singing a humorous rendition of the song "War," encouraging the audience to clap their hands and join in.

ket. By skillfully handling their economic power, Watson believes blacks can bring about meaningful changes. 
To deal with unemployment among youth he proposed that un· employed youth be "put to work in urban centers where they live." 
Concerfling crime, Watson declared that his administration will not support actions like those of Bernhard Goetz. "We cannot tolerate individuals taking the law into their own hands," he said. He is also opposed to capital punishment, claiming that "those without the capital usually get the punishment." 
As far as women's issues, he sup­ports the Equal Rights Amendment and affirmative action, and is opposed to federal aid for abortions and abortion clinics. "All life deserves a chance to make it," he said. 
Watson also promised to appoint more women and minorities to meaningful positions than all previ­ous administrations combined. 
The new President concluded the press conference by declaring that we can make the world a better place by working together. 
The mock press conference was followed by a small reception. 
Watson got the inspiration for his play, which he wrote, directed and performed himself, from his political science background, debate skills and extensive reading on current is­sues. He was educated at Fordham, Pace and New York Universities. 
He was named "Outstanding 

Young Man ofAmerica" in 1982 and 
was awarded both the Avon Youth 
Award from the National Black Lead· 
ership Roundtable and the Youth 
Award '84 from congressman Walter 
Fauntroy. 
Watson is also the author of five 

books and has appeared on a black 
soap opera. He is currently touring 
the country, performing his play for 
college audiences and civic groups. 
The reason for his play, he said, is to show college students that they must he politically aware and able to think on their feet." His message to today's college students is that they have a "responsibility to make a dif· ference in America, to get beyond petty politics of race, class, religion and social status ~nd get on with brotherhood, respect, business and ethnic tolerance." 
The challenge of the 80's, accor­ding to Watson, is "to be bold, inno­vative and daring in dealing with race, religion, justice and equality. Like Captain Kirk of "Star Trek," we must go where no man has gone before, and do things no man has done before to survive the current nuclear madness. 
"The unborn of the world are waiting on you and me to get our acts together for a safer world." 
Watson's play was the second event of the Black Cultural Arts Fes­tival, which runs from February 3 through March 2.

Young boy withstands wind chill of 65 below 
Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE -A 2S-month-old boy who came back from the dead with ice in his blood is certain to end up in medical textbooks, doctors say. · 
A search of medical literatun: has found no case of anyone surviving with a body temperature colder than the boy's 60 degrees. 
But yesterday, Michael Troche had not only survived but was thriv· ing. 
Two weeks ago, the boy was so 
severely frozen after wandering 
away from his home in a tempera­
ture of 20 below zero that ice had 
formed beneath his skin and he ap­
peared clinically dead. Doctors said 
he had been out..~ide between 30 and 
3S minutes when he was found. 
Yesterday, he was alert, playful and eager for his two favorite things, "gum and popcorn," said his mother, Judy Troche. 
After he was found frozen, doctors connected him to a heart-lung ma­chine to warm his blood and cut open his arms and legs to allow tissues to expand. 
"What's been learned from Mi­chael is going to add a lot to the wealth of knowledge about hypot· hermia," said a spokesman for Mil­waukee Children's Hospital, where 

U.S. denied port access 
Assodated Press 
WELLINGTON, New Zealand · New Zealand yesterday refused a second U.S. request to let an Ameri­can warship make a port call. Prime Minister David Lange said he will ad­mit no ship without assurance that it does not carry nuclear weapons, which the United States refuses to give. 
Both sides expressed regret over the standoff, which the United States said threatens the three-way ANZUS alliance with Australia, but neither indicated a change in position. Lange denies any danger to the al­liance. 
Lange said Wa.'>hington had resub­mitted a request, rejected last week, to send a warship on a port call and the request again had been turned down. New Zealand has banned nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed warships from its territorial waters on grounds they make the country a 
ster, Robert Hawke. 
Michael remains in the pediatric in· tensive care unit. Hypothermia is the medical name for low body temperature. 'lbe recovery has amazt·d doctors. 

"When he came in, the legs and arms...felt like blocks of ice, and as you squeezed the tissue, you could feel ice in the blood as you would crush ice under the skin," said Dr. Kevin Kelly, associate director ofthe pediatric unit. 
He said the boy's condition was upgraded yesterday to fair and sta­ble, although he still faces three to four weeks of rehabilitation in the hospital. 
Michael wandered outside his Milwaukee home the morning of jan. 19 as his father slept and a 6­year-old sister watched television. 
It was the coldest wekend of the winter, with the temperature at about 20 below zero and wind chill index at about 6S below. 
·"When he was brought into the hospital, he had no vital signs," said Leigh Morris, the hospital spokes­man. "Ifyou didn't know better, you would have said he was clinically dead." 
Physicians predict a nearly com­plete recovery, although they say Michael might have minor muscle damage in the left hand. 
He told a news conference: "I have today replied to the United States confirming our policy and reiterating that the ... request is, with regret, again unacceptable and advising them to send a vessel which I can be sure conforms with the policy." 
Lange said his government would not admit any American warship un­less it could be certain the vessel did not carry nuclear weapons, which about 80 percent of U.S. Navy ships are equipped to do. The United States refused to say whether its ships carry such weapons. 
In Washington, State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb expressed "deep regret" over Lange's decision and said, "We are considering appro­priate responses to the government of New Zealand's denial of port access." 
He said the issue is expected to be taken up during the visit later this week of the Australian prime mini­

"... AND sorASK vou. ~~, tF NOr us.w~? IF Nor N"-'1. WHEN7,, 
The brutal weather we have endured since our return to campus has evoked mc:mories of another winter three years ago, whc:n current seniors were just freshmen. Th~1t winter, which came in the midst ofa 1 0-1 7 basketball 
Brian McKeon 
refllecting 

season, only served to remind all of us that perhaps we should have gone elsewhere for college. Anywhere had to be warmer than here. 
To make matters worse, the freshman pro­gram was less than exciting. In fact, it was in­credibly dull. Except for the fact lhat I was now living away from home, college seemed to be an extension ofhigh school. Tite courses had not changed much. Sure enough, there was English, Math, Science, a language class, even Phys Ed (Phys Ed? Notre Dame has to have the most active, athletic students around. Why are they wasting our 1time with Phys Ed?) 
And what about Freshman Seminar? The title of the course actually holds. promise. Reality,. however, sets in at the lfirst class meeting. There you are presented with the topic. Depending on the luck ofthe draw, you may stumble upon an interesting class. Or you could be banished, like I was, to a sc:mester of "Psychological Impact of Institutions." A friend of mine who was a freshman last year was stuckwith a teacher who had him writing ten-page research papers on probability. 
Ifclasses did not drive you crazy, your sur­rogate parents would. When you pay your Notre Dame tuition, you automat:ically hire someone to watch over you for a ye:ar. There's Dean Hofman, admonishing you to spend 28 hours ofstudy a week per credit hour (ifyou are good this week, he will take you out to a movie). The rector discusses your grades with you. Your R.A. looks out for any trouble. A senior interviews you to "see how things are going." A guidance counselor makes up your schedule for you and checks your progress. If classes give you trouble, tutoring will be set up. 
Some of you by now are probably wonder­ing what my problem is. How could I criticize the Freshman Year of Studies? Certainly, Notre Dame does an admirable job in easing the difficult transition from high school to col­lege. A number ofstudents would not make it through their initial year without some help. In addition, Hofman's date nights do fill a very large gap in an otherwise nonexistent social life. But it all seems a bit overbearing. Helping someone through a difficult period is one thing -holding his/her hand while doing it is another. 
The basic concept of the Freshman Year of Studies is good. I am not suggesting that fresh­men be thrown into classes with upperclas­smen, nor am I saying that freshmen be left on their own to sink or swim. However, freshman year at Notre Dame leaves little room for growth. The curriculum for the most part is a waste oftime. Classes that on the surface seem worthwhile are often taught by uninspiring and unimpressive graduate students. Having someone looking over your shoulder all the time makes you wonder whether or not you can make it without their help. 
The best thing about the freshmen year is that it only lasts for one year. Obviously, things can onlyget better. But isn't there some way to make it more bearable? The weather and lack of social life are punishment enough for freshmen. I can only remember about two classes my first year from which I derived any benefit. Perhaps I am in the minority. But, if I am not, then something is wrong with the freshmen program.

ou walk by the stadium late: at night and see a light burning. Why? Is someone living there? In the stadium? 
Ifyou are a typical student you have probably heard rumors about people living in the various build­ings around campus. You may have heard strange noices coming from a dark Architecture Building late at night, or seen a student walk through an unmarked door in Lafortune. So what is the real story about these "non-residential" build­ings? 
Yes, there really are students who live neither off campus nor in dorms, but in an unusual form of extra space. 
Matt LaChance enjoys a beautiful view ofSaint Mary's lake from his comfortable three-room apartment in the Architecture Building. In exchange for locking the doors at night and unlocking them on the weekends, LaChance pays no rent, a situation he calls "a good deal." 
"I'm very glad I got it, otherwise this year would have been real tough financially," he said. The occupant of the room is chosen every year by the chairman of the department, and must be a fifth-year architecture student who qualifies for financial aid. The job is limited to men because they "do not want a woman living in the building alone." According to LaChance, "Last year (the resident) found a bum living on one of the floors in the middle of winter. They nearly

campus this year, the guards at the

building and "in the summer, my r friends in Morrissey play their r stereos very loud." As for socializ­r ing and the question ofparties and r parietals, "Du Lac covers me, but 
l r realistically no one is around to enforce anything." 
The Notre Dame Security Depart­ment is in charge ofthe ACC and has two students living there. They pay rent for their apartment and work 12 hours a week. According to Director Glenn Terry, "This is primarily for security, and it makes it possible for (these) students to take part in student activities. They know who should and should not be in the building." 
ACC inhabitants Richard Stickney and Tom Cushing could not be interviewed, for security purposes. 
According to a secretary in Hayes-Healy, the building has no human residents but, "we've got mice." The business buildings are also reportedly inhabited by grem­lins, especially in the basement of 

r Hurley. As legend has it, a ghost
,

, 
live persons haunt its rooms after hours. Many rooms occupied in past

r 
years are now gone or empty. 
Originally, apartments were set up in the buildings on campus for insurance purposes but this is no longer necessary, according to Director ofStudent ActivitiesJoni Neal. "This is slowly being phased out. For c:xample, thc:rc: will no longer he an apartment in Lafortune: aftc:r the: renovations." 



Student Activitic:s is in charge of hiring students to live: in Lafortune and Stepan Center. Applications are submitted in March and April and must be approved by financial aid before interviews take place. This year the selection will be made: by Neal. She says the job is open to anyone but, "my own conscience would not allow me to put a female in the room, c:specially in Stepan." 
The small two-room apartment in Lafortune is currently occupied by Rich Flint, a former resident of Cavanaugh Hall who claims not to miss dorm life: at all. "I value having no neighbors and no rector or R.A. to check up on me." 
Flint says he: is bothered occa­sionally by the noise outside his room in the Nazz, c:specially when they have shows. "The walls are paper thin and I can hc:ar every mistake, c:very wrong note." People: also ask him to opc:n doors or find the: fuse box when necessary, but generally he is left alone because few know ofhis living quartc:rs in the: building. 
In rc:turn for the frc:e room and a small stipend, Flint is employed as a custodian. He is supposc:d to act as sc:curity and check the: doors at night, hut he says Lafortune has hired studc:nt managers to lock up, which leaves him with very little to do, something a busy math graduate studem doesn't mind in the least. 
Having to shower in Grace and being awakened for 8 a.m. tests are two of the biggest problems faced by Nick Molochin, the senior living in Stepan Center this year. Other­wise Molochin enjoys the job which gets him a free room plus a S l ,21 5 salary. In return, he coordi­nates three other students to moni­tor the open courts at Stepan, locks up at night, and is present to over­see other activities during the course of the year. 
Molochin doesn't mind bc:ing around Stepan and says he "has met a lot of kids from different dorms" and played ball with many of them. He also enjoys free movies and Bengal Bouts and a first row seat at pep rallies, something he said his parents enjoyed. 
Even though he is located in an isolated spot and is not allowed to have parties due to the building code (save an occasional late night basketball game with friends), Molochin does not suffer socially. He received permission to partici­pate in interhall sports with Grace Hall and attends Grace dances and parties. 
Overall Molochin enjoys his job and claims to have the "best of both worlds... I like it. Some people wouldn't probably because ofless interaction with roommates and other people, but I'm pretty much ofa loner and like living by myself. 
''I'm living on campus withuut having all the rules being forced down my neck." 
"Probably one of the better jobs on campus hut one with a price to pay," is how graduate student jerry Young describes his life in the Cen­ter for Continuing Education. For working approximately 20 hours a week and paying a very reasonable rent, Young is able to live in a fairly large room on the mezzanine (between the first and second floors) with a view of the stadium. With two other students, Kevin Guillet and Scott Cassidy, Young

shares the responsibility ofensuring that all doors are locked in the evenings. They also work during the day in the CCE office and often set up and clean up for the seminars that are held in the building. 
The job is open to any men graduate or undergraduate stu­dents, but Young said that he believes first preference is given to students who already work in the building and have built up a rapport with the staff. He has lived in the CCE for two years and held a job there previously. 
Young claims that the dis­advantages of his situation are far outweighed by the advantages, but they exist nonetheless. "I don't have a lot offree time. Most ofit is spent working down at the front desk during the day." The need for someone in the building at all times includes all breaks and the summer months; Young had to return to campus two weeks early from Christmas this year. Because ofthe hours he works he is unable to go to the dining halls for meals and in­stead must rely on his own hot pot, hot plate and initiative. The latter includes free food from the semi­nars taking place. 
Young enjoys the quiet atmo­
sphere of the building, claiming it is 
ideal for studying, but he also 
misses dorm life to a certain extent. 
"People tend to want to stay in their 
own environment instead ofvisiting 
their friends off campus, even 
though (the CCE) is only about 50 
feet away. It can also be a hassle ifl 
forget my keys ... there's no rector 
or people to call." 
The residents all expressed satis­faction with their situations and claimed they are happy to put up with some minor inconveniences for the return they receive. Ifof­fered the same job again, they all said they would do the same. Oh and by the way, no one lives in the The Observer /Phil Deeter stadium. Rich Flint sits in the privacy ofhis LaFortune abode.

Eye-oJ>ening exercise 

Marc Ramirez 

Strange days indeed 

F
ive in the morning is just about when you start to hit your silly stage, unless, ofcourse, you are sound asleep in your cozy little bed in your very own room with lots ofwarm blankets and a fluffy, soft pillow in familiar, comforting surroundings, which, as you may have guessed, is not where/ happened to be on this particularly cold morning. 
Instead, I was hard at work in the ol' office, slaving away over a few applications and otl1er potentially crucial matters ofimportance, when the bags forming under my eyes started to feel as if they were housing a few concrete blocks, several baby grand pianos and a prize-winning bull. I think you know what I mean. 
Obviously, something had to be done. I don't make very good coffee, and in fact, after partaking ofseveral cups ofSanka produced at my hand, some people have even died, just like that. Instantly, ifyou will. 
I was getting desperate. I was ready to punt on first down. It had to be done, and I knew it had to be done, and so I done it. I turned on a South Bend radio station. 
I think it was working for a while, but you can only fall into your typewriter so many times or hear so many cuts from Born in the USA before you say to yourself, you know, I don't think this is working very well anymore. It's time for "Plan B." 
Now the only thing worse than having to switch to "Plan B" is not having a "Plan B" to switch to, as I so painfully found out on this frosty morning, which happened to be yesterday. 
So, I decided to get radical. That's right. I took the road less traveled by. I turned on the TV. 
Well, naturally I didn't expect to find much ofanything on at 5:30 in the morning, except maybe a King james Version-totin' minister preaching about goodness with a toll-free number shining at his feet lahk a laht from fah beyond, my friends, but luckily some semblance of hope was still sorta springing within my breast, and it paid off. Like I said, sorta. 
When the first thi.ng I saw on the screen was a small novel warning me not to attempt any of the following activities without a doctor's consent, I knew I was going to be good for at least another half-hour. So then this saucy young vixen appeared, scantily clad, but when I caught sight ofher legwarmers, I knew there was only one thing it could be. 
Aerobicize! Or something like that. This chick looked like Phoebe Cates. She moved like Chita Rivera. She sang like Sheila E. This was it. I had found my destiny. 
My destiny continued to squirm about on the screen while two more girls joined h1:r on the set, although they weren't as cute so as not to distract from the main attraction, I'm sure. Then they started jumping around, and after awhile, they started dancing. 
And then the music started. 

At first it was easy, and the reason I knew this was because I could do it myselfand I was still sitting in my chair. You know, simple stuff, neck exercises, look up, look down, look right, look left. "Come oun, come oun, come oun," the leader ofthe sextet· oh, excuse me, the trio, crooned with the same syllabic accentuation as "I want to go to bed." Her head swung back and forth as she continued. "Go right, and left, and right, and left. Come oun." 
But then their arms started flying around and then they did unspeakable things on the floor while the camera swirled slowly around them in order to expose every possible, uh, angle. This is where I drew the line. I've got my principles, you know. Besides, I wasn't about to move from my chair. 
Nope. I was perfectly content to sit there, typewriter still running, and just watch. It may have been a bright and early morning for the Aerobic sisters, but it was a very late night for me. And this was sexploitation at its very best. How could anyone with any amount of self-esteem allow themselves to be photographed from every side, and I do mean every side, while touching their toes and exercising their hip muscles? Don't bother me with that now. I'll think about it later. Promise. 
"Now y'all just keep on jogging it out right on through our message from our sponsors, now, you hear?" Phoebe chirped. Oh yeah. I jogged it out, all right. I couldn't watch anymore, I decided. I'd had enough. 
Eventually, I did the respectable thing. I turned offthe typewriter so I wouldn't waste any electricity. Chita was back. "I hope you didn't stop there on our commercial 
break, come oun," she sang. And then she and her cohorts got down on all fours, into a position I can't really describe unless you happened to catch the Imperial Walkers in "The Empire Strikes Back." You know what I'm talking about. "Fo mo ... three mo ... two mo ... and back to jumping jacks, come with me now, come oun! 
"Come oun, get tough, get strong! I know you do not need to stop, comeoun!" 
That was it. I just couldn't take it anymore. It was infecting. My arms were beginning to tlail, my feet were starting to shuffle. I was getting tough and strong. I reached out for the On/Off knob. 
"I hope you haven't stopped," Sheila E purred. ''/still haven't stopped." But then it was over. The screen went black. She had stopped, and I had won. 
So you can bet that you'll never find me the victim ofaerobicize again, much less awake at 5:30 in the morning. Trust me. You do believe me, don't you? 
Now come oun.

"I'm hoping that Don Johnson who was l-2 (against Wayne State) can at least turn that around. If he can do that, then conceivably we can win in sabre again which is im­portant." 
The women's squad also enjoyed some success over the weekend as they went 2-I to advance their record to 7-3 on the year. 
Against Wayne State, they met little success. The Tartans, who have dominated the Irish for years, won a convincing 13-3 decision on Friday. 
On Saturday, nevertheless, the Irish were able to boost their record as expected with easy 13·3 victories over Tri-State and Cleveland State.

N.C. State's Washburn enters plea of guilty to charges of stereo theft 
Associated Press 

RALEIGH, N.C.) -Chris Wash· 
burn, the 6-1 I North Carolina State 
freshman who was one of the na· 
tion's most sought after schoolboy 
basketball players last season, 
pleaded guilty yesterday to three 
misdemeanor charges stemming 
from the theft of stereo equipment 
last December. 

He was immediately sentenced to 
three days in jail. 

"It is very clear to us ... that this 
young man has to be punished. We 
recognize that ... and he recognizes 
that," defense attorney Wade Smith 
told Wake Superior CourtJudge Mil· 
ton Reid. "While there must be 
punishment, we hope the punish· 
ment does not close the doors to his 
future." 

Reid also gave Washburn a 
suspended six-year sentence and 
placed him on probation for five 
years. Wao;hburn wao; ordered to

CINCINNA 11 · Cincinnati Reds of­
ficials are miffed that the city is plan· 
ning to pursue a lawsuit against the 
National League ballclub all the way 
to the Ohio Supreme Court. 

At a council committee hearing yesterday on the stability of Cincin­nati sports franchises, cou'ncil mem­bers indicated they'll take their fight for S I. l million in lost revenues from the 1981 baseball players' strike to the Supreme Court. 
The city, which operates Riverfront Stadium, asserted the bal­lclub violated its lease by failing to play a full number of home games during the players' strike. However, Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Thomas Crush ruled for the ballclub, saying there was no provi· sion in the city's 40-year lease with the Reds to cover a strike. 
The city appealed and lost in the 1st Ohio District Court ofAppeals.

Wao;hburn's plea came as a grand jury was to consider indicting him on a second-degree burglary charge, a charge which could have brought him a 14-year prison term. 
As part ofa plea agreement, Wao;h­burn con~ented to a 20-point proba­tion order, which included provisions that he get mental health treatment, perform 320 hours of 

community service and pay S I ,000 to a crime victims' fund. Wao;hburn, 19, declined comment as he left the courtroom. 
The judge left the door open for Washburn's to continue his basket· ball career. 
"Whether or not you are going to play basketball will be a decision for responsible officials" at NCSU to make, Reid said. "That is not an ap­propriate decision for this court." 
A top national recruit a year ago, Washburn started for the Wolfpack before his arrest.

Women travel to Dayton to take on Lady Flyers 

ByMIKE SULLIVAN 
Sports Editor 
Thefirsthalfofthe 1984-85 North Star Conference season ends this week with the Notre Dame women's basketball team in the thick of the fight for the early NSC lead. And a major determinant in that race will be the outcome of tonight's game between the Irish and current frontrunner Dayton. 
The Lady Flyers, who have a per­fect 5-0 record in the conference, will be looking for revenge when Mary DiStanislao's Irish visit the UD Arena in hopes ofimproving on their 3-1 conference mark. In each of the last two years, Notre Dame has pulled off mild upsets over Unda Makowski's squad, including a 63-57 stunner on Dayton's home court last year. 
Although this is Dayton's first year as a Division I school (and first year in the North Star), the Flyers have made the switch from Division II easily -to nobody's surprise. They have been playing a Division I schedule for the past few years, and were one ofthe top Division II teams in the nation during the past two years. Last year, they held the No. l spot at one point in the season, even­tually reaching the Final Four before 
bowing out with an impressive 27-4 
record. 
The 63-5..., loss to Notre Dame was 
one of the four blemishes on that 
record and came a year after the 
Irish won a dramatic 68-64 overtime 
game over the Flyers in the ACC. In 
that game, guard Laura Dougherty 
hit a desperation 20-footer at the 
buzzer to tie the game at the end of 
regulation. 
"I don't think Dayton expected to lose either ofthose games," says DiS­tanislao. "With them coming off a big loss (against No. 11 Western Kentucky) and having a lot of talent, they'll really be ready to play." 
Notre Dame, too, se:ems ready for the showdown after bombing two NSC opponents -Butkr (79-40) and Evansville ( 7 4-5 3) -l:ast week. The Irish proved they have the best de­fensive team in the conference when they are playing well, but, more importantly, see-med to found a groove on the offensive part of the game, despite the loss of second­leading scorer Carrie Bates who left the team last week. 
"This is a big game for us in terms of keeping up our momentum," says DiStanislao. "We'll see how good we really are. It's also important in terms of our positioning within the conference."

A win over Dayton would put 
Notre Dame in a commanding posi­
tion when the second half of the 
conference schedule: begins. Unlike 
the Flyers who have faced most of 
their tough competition at home so 
far this season, the Irish have had to 
play most of their conference games 
on the road. With the toughest part 
of their schedule almost completed, 
the Irish could still find themselves 
in a tie for first place and, therefore, 
in the driver's seat. 
Defeating the host Flyers will be 
no easy task, though, as Makowski 
has eight players, including three 
starters, returning from last year's 
team which averaged over 90 points 
a game at home. This year's 10-8 
squad has not put as many points on 
the board as it has struggled occa­
sionally with its complete Division I 
schedule, but the Flyers do have a 
number of talented players. 
Center Theresa Yingling is the 
most visible of the Flyers, not only 
because of her size ( 6-5 ), but also 
because of her team-leading scoring 
( 12.5 ppg) and rebounding (7.9 rpg) averages. The junior has been a starter at times this year, but has also come off the bench. 
The same thing can also be said for 
Dayton's 5-6 guard Leah Abla who is 
second on the team in scoring ( 11.4 
ppg). She, too, has been in and out of 
the starting lineup, but her contribu­
tions as scorer and playmaker is very 
important to the team. 
Yingling and Abla may be the big 
guns, but they have plenty ofhelp as 
ten players average more than four 
points an outing. Much of the added 
scoring comes from the guard posi­
tions where two juniors, Rhonda 
Klette and Mary Byers, combine for 
20 points per game. 
The inside game is helped by the play of forwards Lori Cahill (4.6 ppg), Michele Kruty ( 6. 7 ppg) and Sharon Curd ( 5.9 ppg). Center Monica West ( 4.6 ppg) and forward­center Cheryl Dickerson ( 5.4 ppg, 
5.7 rpg) also help out the attack un­der the basket. 
Although the inside game of the 
Flyers is strong -they currently lead 
the conference in rebounding mar­
gin -Notre Dame may have the 
strongest inside game in the confer­
ence. Freshman center Sandy Bot­
ham has been coming on strong in 
recent games, as has senior Mary 
Beth Schueth who broke the 
school's all-time rebounding record 
in Friday's game against Evansville. 
Freshman Kathy Brommeland has 
also played well off the bench, 
scoring in double figures in both 
games last week. 
The emergence of Botham and Brommeland has made the loss of Bates a little easier to take, although they will not be able to make up the loss offour years ofexperience. 
"Both Kathy and Sandy are going to have to be productive on both of­fense and defense," says DiStanislao. "Dayton's a little more wide-open than they used to be, so we're going to need some strong inside defense and keep them off the boards." 
Once again, the Irish will be looking to junior.Trena Keys to lead the offense. The 6-0 guard-forward has been having her best year, leading the team with her 16.5 points per outing. She has also been grabbing six rebounds per game. Lynn Ebben will also be looked to for some outside scoring as she returns to the starting lineup. Fresh­man point guard Mary Gavin will run the show with senior Laura Doug­herty coming off the bench. 
"The key to beating Dayton will be to get 40 productive minutes from the kids," says DiStanislao. "Dayton doesn't beat itselfeasily . 
"We have to get scoring out of Trena, good shooting out of Lynn, strong efforts off the bench, and good decisions by Mary. If we do that, we should win."

Greg Lozinski retires 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Greg Luzinski, one of baseball's most feared power hitters since joining the Philadelphia Phillies in 1970, said yesterday that he was retiring and would become freshman baseball coach at a NewJersey high school. 
"The realization was nobody wanted me," Luzinski said iq an inter­view with USA Today. 
Luzinski, who became a free agent last November after four seaso~ with the American League's Chicago White Sox, was selec­ted only by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the free-agent draft. 
"No team offered him a contract," saidJack Sands, Luzinski's agent. "Because of investments we have made, he will receive $200,000 a year for the rest ofhis life." 
Luzinski, who lives in New Jersey, said he had been appointed freshman haseball coach of Holy Cross High School at Delran, N.J.

No question about it: defense is the name of the game 
Hello again, everybody! 
Defense. 

Everywhere you look in the papers, they're talking about it these days. Most of the time, it has something to do with news. However, when you're a sports writer, you see how every form ofdefense relates to basketball. 
First, there's the Bernard Goetz vigilante defense. This is a popular item in New York subways and Big Ten arenas. The victims are usually innocent offensive players, who have the great misfortune to be in a game worked by Jim Bain, Tom Rucker or Phil Bova -three officials who are usuaJly so far away from a play they need MCI to make the call. There is no protection from this defense other than a gun or a bruising center. 
Then, there's the insanity defense, used by one of America's numerous attorneys or jerry Tarkanian. While it's popular in law circles, the move hasn't caught on in basketball. Basically, that's because the basic idea behind this defense is not to guard anybody and hope you out­score your opponent. The idea is insane; henceforth, the name. 
Thirdly, there's the Reagan defense plan. This is a stockpiling mauever used to strike fear into the hearts of opponents. This would be similar to getting five Patrick Ewings on your team -it really isn't necessary, but it cer­tainly is intimidating. Unfortunately, it causes great deficits in the bank accounts of recruiters and federal budgets, and isn't feasible. 
Finally, there's the kind of defense that's obnoxiously flashed up on scoreboards to get the fans to yell. It drives the fans into a frenzy, bothers the offense, and makes the defense work even harder. It's exactly the kind ofdefense Digger Phelps' Fighting Irish cagers have been playing lately, and it's the main reason Notre Dame is still looking for an NCAA tournament bid. 
Unfonunately, most players don't like to play defense.

Irish Items 


It's not a lot offun to play basketball when you don't have the ball. It's hard work, and not too many people find a lot of enjoyment from going out with four of your friends and chasing a ball around (unless, of course, you'happen to be on a golf course). 
Most fans don't appreciate defense, either. Nobody is going to watch the NBA All-Star Game this Sunday to watch Dr.], Magic, Michael]ordan, and Co. play defense. That's why they have a slam-dunk competition, instead of a taking-the-charge exhibition. When you hear people say a player is a "defensive specialist," chances are his total points could be counted on the prongs ofa fork. 
Basketball coaches love defense, though, because it can make a bad team look good and a good team look great. The offense will cease operating on some days ­take, Notre Dame's loss at Maryland for an example-but if the defense is there, you still have a chance of winning. Against Maryland, the defense took a holiday, and the Irish were beaten. Since that time, it has returned from its one-game hiatus and put the Irish back on track. 
The performance the Irish defense turned in against UCLA was tremendous, even though the only resemblance between the Bruins of today and the teams ofthe Wooden era is the fact they still play their games in Westwood. UCLA still has a good offensive team, as it averaged 72 points a game entering Sunday's contest. Still, Notre Dame played a belly-up man-to-man defense, and the dividend it paid was a big road win. 
Take a look at last Sunday's stats. UCLA shot a mere 42 
percent from the floor and committed 21 turnovers, 
mainly because every man who had the ball had a dark 
blue jersey in his face. Reggie Miller scored hL'> average 
( 14 points), but shot a horrible 4-of-11 from the field. 
Nigel Miguel and Gary Maloncon scored well below their 
double-digit averages, and therein lies the reason for vic­
tory. 

The defense has been a carryover from last year's team, 
which managed to shut down high scorers like Washing­
ton's DetlefSchrempf, Villanova's Ed Pinckney, and Brig­
ham Young's Devin Durrant. While it appeared early in 
the season that Notre Dame may be able to run oppo­
nents out of the gym at will, this team has once again 
shown that you can't win without defense and you can 
win with it. 

Now LaSalle comes into the ACC tommorow with a 
pair ofbig guns in Ralph Lewis and Steve Black. After that, 
Syracuse pays a visit Saturday with offensive weapons like 
Pearl Washington, Rafael Addison, and Andre Hawkins. It 
will certainly be a challenge for the Irish, but it's certainly 
not anything that Notre Dame cannot overcome by using 
the Speed Limit defense. 
The speed limit defense? Yeah, that's where you keep your opponent under 55. 
Pick ofthe Week ... It's a big intra-state rivalry next Tuesday night when the Irish wrestlers play host to the Hoosiers of Indiana. There won't be anybody being thrown into the turnbuckles or over the top rope, but there will be plenty of physical action in the Auxiliary Gymat7p.m. 
First-year coach Fran McCann's team is 6-2, and has the toughest part ofthe schedule coming up. They could use your support in their final home meet of the year. So take this chance to see some "Tuesday Night Titans" of a dif­ferent sort next week at the ACC.
