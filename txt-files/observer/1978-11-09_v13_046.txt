In House and Senate 
Elections increase Republican minorities 

WASHINGTON [AP]-In mid-term elections with a conservative flavor, Republicans have enlarged their minorities in the Senate by three seats and in the House by a dozen, while scoring statehouse gains that will be an asset in 1980 and beyond. 
Texas tipped their way yesterday with the election of William P. Clements as the state's second Republican governor. Clements, an oilman and former deputy secretary of defense, won after a long close count over Democratic Attorney General John L. Hill. 
That gave Republicans a net gain of six governors in Tuesday's balloting. 
Republican Senator John G. Tower barely survived the chal­lenge of Democratic Rep. Robert Krueger in another tight Texas race. 
In Virginia, Republican John W. Warner, the former secretary of the Navy and husband of actress Elizabeth Taylor, apparently held a 
GOP Senate seat against Andrew 
P. Miller,  a former state attorney  
general.  
But that  one  was  so  close that  

Miller said he wasn't conceding a thing until the official canvass of the vote. 
In New Hampshire, Republican Gordon Humphrey, a conservative and an airline pilot from Sunapee, narrowly defeated Democratic Senator Thomas J. Mcintyre, in one of Tuesday's big suprises. Mcintyre had company. All told,

Roemer reverses decision 
Senior Bar to be open Friday 
by John McGmth Staff Reporter 
Reversing an earli~r decision this week, Dean of Students James Roemer has decided to allow Senior Bar to open for happy hour on Friday night. 
"Based on the imput that Andy McKenna, Student Body Presi­dent, gave me, I'm going to respect their (students') opinion and allow tbe bar to remain open," Roemer. 
He was quick to add, however, "next year it's going to be differ­ent. If the seniors decide through their leadership that they will continue the Death March trad­ition, that decision is going to cause us to close the Senior Bar the entire day and night on that date." 
As it stands now, however, the bar will not be open during the afternoon while the Death March is in progress. "It will open at 9 p.m., and even then, we won't serve anyone who is obviously intoxi­cated,'' Roemer explained. 
"It's a bad scene," he said, adding, '"It's a disgrace to the neighborhood. That's why the 
neighbors usually alert the police, not the University." 
Accordingto Roemer, "In the past, students have been arrested for disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and indecent exposure, but in the last few years, they've made more of an effort to control it (the Death March)''. 
Roemer made it clear that one of the major factors considered in his decision was the fact that the closing of the bar would adversely affect a large number of alumni returning to the campus for the Saturd-ay's game. 
That. point was also heavily stressed in a letter from McKenna to Roemer dated yesterday. 
"1 think it's a good decision," McKenna said, adding "I hope everything will go well this week. If we can show that the Senior Death March is a social event, then maybe the Administration's con­cern about next year won't exist." 
Mike Schlageter, Senior Bar manager, commented, "the out­come is basically what I thought it 
would be." "I really believe that the best thing for the class and the bar was for it to remain open. In my mind, I really thought Dean Roemer would make the right decision--and he did," Schlageter said. 
Jerry Castellini, Senior Class President, and the man responsible for leading the traditional proces­sion that each year preceeds the last home football game of the year, told the Observer, ''As far as I'm concerned, we're going ahead with it (the Death March) and we're going to make it the best one ever.'' 
"We've put a Jot of work into planning it. For example, we've set up an itinerary that ensures that we won't reach that six-way inter­section on South Bend Avenue at rush hour--that's where most of the trouble has occurred in past years," Castellini explained. 
The Senior Class President pointed out that he had been in contact with the South Bend police and, according to what he learned, "everything looks alright." 
''The decision to close the bar on Friday night wouldn't have affected us anyway--most of the guys won't even be up by that time anyway,'' Castellini said. 
five Democratic Senators were 
denied new terms, while two 
Republicans were beaten in re­
election bids. 
Only one of those incumbent 
losers, Sen. Robert Griffin of 
Michigan, could be classified as 
relatively conservative, and he was 
no hard liner. 
All the rest were generally 
counted among Senate liberals, at 
least on domestic policy. 
While both parties cast 
themselves with the economizers 
and the tax cutters in handling the 
season's biggest issue, neither 
managed to gain exclusive custody 
of the austerity theme. 
As a result, voters in more than a 
few states had a choice between 
candidates who sounded a lot alike 
when they spoke of curbing 
government spending in the fight 
against inflation. 
White House Press Secretary 
Jody Powell said yesterday the 
voters seemed inclined to support 
President Carter's effort to hold 
down the federal budget deficit. 
Powell said he couldn't forecast 
the impact of congressional 
changes on Carter's legislative 
proposals. 
· ?owell said he doubted the 96th 
Congress would be much different 
from the 95th on major issues. 
It was in contests for governors that the Republicans made their strongest showing, wresting six states from the Democrats. Democrats took over from 
Republicans in New Hampshire, 
Kansas, and South Carolina. 
With Clements in Texas and 
Richard L. Thornburgh in 
Pennsylvania, the GOP took over 
governorships in two of the big 
population states that are pivotal in 
presidential campaign years. 
Thornburgh, a former federal prosecutor, beat Pete Flaherty, who used to be mayor of Pittsburgh and deputy U.S. attorney general. 
Governors and their state organizations can be helpful to their party's presidential nomi­nees. 
The Republicans also have been worried about congressional redistricting after the 1980 census. They fear that partisan alignment of congressional districts by Democratic legislatures could further cripple their chances in Congress. 
A governor can block that, and while the Republicans are still outnumbered in the state houses, the eighteen states they have now represent progress for them. They had only 12 until Tuesday. 
Their incumbents held on to three of the biggest states. Gov. James 
T. Thompson was re-elected in lllinois, as were Gov. William Milliken in Michigan and Gov. James A. Rhodes in Ohio. 
Add Texas and Pennsylvania and Republican governors are in charge of five ·of the ten most populous states.

by Jean Powley Saint Mary's Editor 
Saint Mary's seniors will have the opportunity to vote for a commencement speaker today. Balloting will take place in the LeMans lobby between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., according to Donna Nopnan, senior class president. 
Ten speakers are now under consideration and students will be asked to vote for their first three choices. The votes will then be tallied and the graduation com­mittee will then proceed to contact the most popular nominees until one agrees to serve as the speaker. 
The nominees are: 
George Bush--former National Chairman of the Republican Party. In 1970 he was appointed Perma­nent Representative of the United States to the United Nations. Currently, he is a progressive candidate for the presidency. 
Robert Coles--author and social critic. A specialist in child psy­chiatry, he has recently completed a five-volume series called "Chit­dren of Crisis.'' Last year he published "Women in Cris!s." His writings have been classtfied as showing a ''nearly perfect example of deft and humane application of psychology to the understanding of man in a social situation." 
John B. Connally-former Gover­nor of Texas. Connally served as Secretary of the Treasury during the Nixon administration. He is a probably candidate for the Republi­can Party presidential race in 1980. 
Jill Ker Conwy--first woman President of Smith College. She is a strong advocate of colleges for women. 
Ella T. Grasso--governor of Con-­necticut. Grasso is the first woman ever to become the governor of a state on her own and not as the wife 
of a previous incumbent.  Sh_e has

Shroud undergoes tests 
MISSOURI-American researchers so far have concluded that the Shroud of Turin, reputed to be the burial cloth of Christ, is not a 14th century forgery, a painting or a contact print. But Kenneth Stevenson, spokesman for tbe scientists, said at a news conference Tuesday that it might take two years 'o study all the tests performed on the cloth in Turin, Italy, last month by a team of international experts. The cloth bears the image of a bearded man, and researchers said the photographic tests showed the image is three-dimensional. A normal photo might show shadings of light, said researchers, but not how far the body is from the cloth as is shown in one test of the shroud. 
Twins abound at school 
TENNESSEE-John Dudney says he doesn't usually go around counting sets of twins, but when a newspaper asked how many twins there were at Dupont Junior High School, Dudney figured he should know. After all, he's the principal. He found eight sets of twins among the 771 students, about 31/l times the national average. 'I was really suprised. I had seen several, but I didn't think there were this many.' Tammy Wilkinson, age 12, said she and her sister Becky, 'get jealous sometimes, but most of the time it is over little things. Becky's sort of jealous because I got an A in math. Fraternal twins Beth and Richard Allen said they enjoy birthdays together. Beth said she also preferred her special status as a twin. 'It's much better than being just regular.'

VATICAN CITY [ap]-Pope John Paul II yesterday called human rights ''the great effort of our time" and said all men should defend themselves when systems trespass on them. 
"It cannot be man for the 

system, but the system must be for 
man'' the former Polish cardinal 
told 10,000 pilgrims attending his 
weekly public audience in St. 
Peter's Basilica. "therefore it is 
necessary to defend oneself from 
any stiffening of the system.'' 
He was repeatedly interrupted 

by applause as he spoke in seven 
lanuages-Italian, French, English, 
German, Spanish Portugese and 
Polish. 
The 58 year old pontiff, who performed forced labor under the Nazis in occupied Poland during World War IT, said '' it is necessary to evaluate the great effort of our time that tries to spell out and consolidate human rights in the life of today's mankind, of people as well as of states. 
''The present pope will certainly

Norman Rockwell dead at 84 
STOCKBRIDGE Mass. [AP)-Ar­tist Norman Rockwell died at his home late Wednesday night. He was 84. 
Rockwell, who sold his first illustrations to the Saturday Even­ing Post at age 22, subsequently painted some 360 covers for the magazine. 
He did illustrations for many other magazines during his long career, including a Post cover celebrating the transatlatic flight of Charles Lindbergh in 1927 and a Look magazine picture depicting the imprint of Neil Armstrong's left foot on the dusty surface of the Moon after the first moonlanding in 
.969. 
But most of his illustrations were folksy, warm scenes of small-town Americana. 
In 1960, he said of his work: many times," said John Paul, who, as a cardinal, vigorously defended the church against communist re­pression in his own country. 

The pope did not name any specific country or refer to any specific political system in his remarks, but Vatican sources said the papal statment indicates he would like to see the Roman Catholic Church take a stand on human rights "whether it's com­munist suppression or the open conflict in Lebanon or racial discri­mination." 
At the same time, they empha­sized the pope's approach would be conciliatory and not confrontation­al. 
The pope, shortly after his election Oct. 16, told the cardinals that while the church wants to make an effective contrubution to

McKenna submits parietal discipline rule change 
by Kevin Richardson Senior Staff Reporter 
A proposal to make parietal violations a haJI offense is currently being supported by both Student Body President Andy McKenna a~d Judicial Coordinator iayne Rtzzo. McKenna said. "We are attempting to clarify Du Lac on the parietals issue and make formal policy out of something which is already informal policy. 
B~th Fr. Van Wolvlear, Vice Prestdent for Student Affairs, and Dean of Students James Roemer have already voted against the reform proposal at the October 9 ~eeting of the Campus Life Coun­ctl (CLC). VanWolvlear declined comment on why he voted against the proposal and Roemer was unavailable for comment. Wolv­lear said "I will give my official reasons for voting against the measure at the next CLC meet­
ing." 
''The majority of rectors support the proposal and everyone on the CLC voted for it except for Fr. Van and Dean Roemer," McKenna said. "What we propose is to allow students to participate in the enforcement of parietals at the halt level, as is currently permitted with alcohol regulations, the use of marijuana, and other hall offenses,'' Rizzo said. 
Rizzo emphasized that ''This is no change in the current Univeristy rule but rather a change in the disciplinary procedures for the enforcement of that rule. This allows for concurrent jurisdiction on the hall and University levels." 
The Student Government sta~e­ment which supports the reform measure states that "last year, while removing student represen­ation from the University Judicial 
Board, the Administration empha­sized its commitment to student 
TEHRAN* Iran [AP]-The Iranian military put on a show of force yesterday and martial law authori­ties arrested an ex-prime minister in a campaign to discourage oppo­sition to Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. 
An expected antigovernment de­monstration in the Tenran bazaar failed to materialize. 
The arrested former prime minister, Amir Abass Hoveyda, headed the Cabinet for 13 years until he was dismissed Aug. 6, 1977. He is one of dozens of former officials arrested in recent days to defuse opposition claims the government tolerates corrup­tion and abuse of authority. 
Troops backed by tanks and armored personnel carriers guard­ed key areas of the city and its giant bazaar, which was closed. The bazaar, which also contains the huge Shah Mosque , has been the staging area for many of the anti-Shah demon­strations that have erupted since January. 
A demonstration reportedly called by exiled Shiite Moslem holy man Ayatollah Khomaine, who symbolizes the antiShah forces, did not develop, but the armed forces remained on alert in the event Khomaini's supporters surged onto the streets again to smash banks and shops as they have done in recent days: 
Many bazaar shop owners were reluctant to reopen after rioting Sunday and other pulled the shutters down as a sign of protest against the new military-led gov­ernment appointed by the Shah Monday. The new government was appointed after the collapse of Prime Minister Jaafar Sharif­Emami's civilian governent Sun­day. 
participation, both in framing the standards for student conduct and
. , 
m enforcement those standards when violated. The hall judicial board system was strengthened and standardized campus-wide in order to broaden student input and responsibility.'' 
"Hall Judicial Boards have de­monstrated that they are able to handle the responsibility effec­tively," Rizzo said. "Our proposal is a natural extension of the process of allowing students greater say over the rules which govern them. It neither challenges the parietals concept nor makes enforcement untenable. All it does is assure the students a reasonable measure of participation in the enforcement of a rule which is intended to insure their privacy,'' added. 
An· attempt to change parietals violations from University to hall offenses was also made in the spring of 1975 when the then Student Body President Ed Byrne 
reported the results of a poll taken by the Office of Student Affairs. The poll covered the parietals issue and was given to every rector and assistant rector on campus. 
Regarding the question of whether parietals offense should become hall offenses, one Rector in the 1975 survey said "generally 
the parietals (violations) which don't become public are already taken care of in the halls.'' Anotehr Another respondant from the same same survey said that "the (hall judicial) boards could live more comfortably with rules they had some input in making." 
According to McKenna, current rectors ''by and large agree with the assesments of their predeces­sors. They believe that students won't feel responsibility for any­thing unless they are given free­dom to help formulate rules." 






Military exercises martial law 
Khomaini, living in Paris, said yesterday he will call on his millions of followers to take up 
arms against the government if the present political struggle fails to achieve its objective. 
Khomaini, 78, who has threaten­ed to withdraw his support from any opposition politican who co­operates with the shah, said if the current turmoil in Iran should bring a Marxist or pro-communist gov­ernment to power, he and his followers "will react against them exactly in the same way as we are doing now against the shah." 
He said he envisaged no political role for himself in a future Iranian government. 
The opposition to the shah is spearheaded by Moslem tradition­alists who demand an end to the shah's Westernizing reforms,

New lighting upgrades security 
by Brian McFeeters 
Lighting on much of the Notre Dame campus is being upgraded this fall to increase student security. The maintenance department is doing the work and the improvements are already un­derway. New lights have been installed on the Southeast corner of Sacred Heart Church and at the foot of the administration building as well as at several other ''pockets of darkness" on the main quad, according to Assistant to the Pro­vost Sr. John Miriam Jones. Fixtures are being placed on the buildings themselves and on new light poles. 
Jones said lighting improve­ments were not a direct response to past attacks on students, but that such incidents always made the problem of dark areas seem more urgent. "We have been in­creasingly aware of the need for lighting since the University went co-ed several years ago,'' she said. 
Improvements are als9 being made on the lake road, from the East gate to the Main gate, where more translucent globes are being put on the mercury lamps to increase brightness, and new lights are being installed on trees and electrical poles to make this,route 
Indiana banks establish endowed chair 
An endowed chair in banking has been established at Notre Dame by a consortium of 21 banks in 10 Indiana cities. it was announced yesterday by Bro. Leo V. Ryan, of the University's College of Business Administration. 
"The South Bend-Mishawaka­Elkhart banks have exercised out­standing leadership in pledging one-half the total support for this banking program," Dean Ryan noted, explaining that more than $800,000 has been committed to underwrite the permanent endow­ment of the professorship in the College of Business Administration to be called the Indiana Chair in Banking. 
The South Bend area banks are the American National Bank and Trust Company, the First Bank and Trust Company, the National Bank and Trust Company, and the Saint Joseph Bank and Trust Company, all of South Bend; the First National Bank of Elkhart and the Valley Bank and Trust Company of Mshawaka. Major banks in other Indiana cities are also partici­pating. 
Dean Ryan said a senior profes­sor with acknowledged teaching ability and research experience will be sought for the chair. "The occupant of the Indiana Banking Chair will relate the needs of the banking profession to the University and help bring its intellectual and scholarly resaurces to bear on current banking prob­lems," he said.

Leftist terrorists murder Italian district attorney 
FROSINONE Italy, [AP]-A terror­ist assassination squad shot and killed a district attorney and his two bodyguards yesterday, raking their car with sub machine gun fire in teh the bloodiest strike since the kidnap and shooting of former Premier Aldo Moro. 
One terrorist was wounded in the crossfire of his comrades and his body was found in the car the terrorists used to flee from the scene, police said. 
Investigators recovered spent shells in the car and said the assailant may have been killed by his comrades in their hurry to make a getaway. 
He was identified by police as Roberto Capone, 24, a former sociology student. Police said Capone had links with several leftist groups. 
The attack occurred on a lonely highway about 30 miles south of Rome. 
The other terrorists were able to escape into the hills despite ·a search by hundreds of police in squad cars and helicopters. Aut­horities said they believed three terrorists were involved in the attack, but there is speculation that a fourth may have been there as a lc kour. 
A caller told a Milan newspaper several hours later that the attack was the work of "Frontline," a leftist terrorist group that has claimed responsibility for a number of killings and bombings. 
Police said they had no way of establishing whether the call ac­tually was from the terrorists. 
The Red Brigades, Italy's most feared terrorist gang kidnapped Moro and killed his five body­guards in a street ambush in Rome March 16. Moro's bullet-riddled body was found in a car in the capital 54 days later. 
Police said yesterday's attack' occurred as Fedele Calvosa, 59, district attorney in this town of 35,000 was being driven to work from his home. 
As the blue Fiat came out of a turn on the provincial high­way, the driver braked to avoid hitting a car blocking a cross roads. 
A witness told police that three persons stepped out of the thick bushes on both sides of the road and opened fire at the car 
Westergaard to give music lecture 

Peter Westergaard of Princeton University will present a leture, "Rhythm; Theory and Perfor­mance," at 8:15 tonight in the Crowley Recital Hall. The lecture, sponsored by the Notre Dame Music Department, is open to the public without charge. 
Westergaard, the author of "An Introduction to Tonal Theory" and numerous articles, is professor of music at Princeton University. He was educated at Harvard and Princeton and has studied compo­sition with Walter Piston and Darius Milhaud. 
at close range, killing Calvosa and his the driver Guiseppe Pagliei, before Pagliei could get his gun out of his holster. 
A third person in the car, Luciano Rossi, was in training as a new bodyguard for Calvosa and was unarmed . He tried to fire but was gunned down, police said. 
The terrorists dragged their wounded fellow into their car, leaving a trail of blood across the road, and then sped away. 
The beige Fiat-later determined t to have been stolen-was found abandoned, its doors open and signal lights on, beside a road a few miles from the ambush scene. 
The body of the slain terrorist was inside the car. but there was no sign of the others, who had apparently switched cars for their getaway. 
Calvosa, married and the father of two Rome University students, was the seventh Italian justice official slain in the past seven years and the third this year alone. 
The Red Brigades have claimed two ofthe killings this year, both of which occurred in Rome. The victims were Ricardo Palma, an official of the prison department of the Justice Ministry who was killed last February and Girolamo Tar­taglione. a ranking ministry offi­cial, who was gunned down last month. 
Nineteen persons have been killed in ambushes claimed by terrorist groups this year. They were all party officials or busi­nessmen.

Justice Notes 

A Course on War 
James P. Sterba 

We usuallv don't like to think about war. Wars are ugly; destructive of life. limb and property; and constituting. at best, a necessary evil. Still. wars have alwavs been with us and have molded the course of human history. To see ·this we have only to imagine how different our lives and our country would be ifthere had been no Vietnam War or World War 11. Thus, the question of when. if ever, wars can be religiously. legally or morally justified is of paramount importance for our times as for any 
-----............~------------------------------------.

other. 
In particular, we should ask ourselves what a Christian stance is on the justification of war. Given that the early Christians were by and large pacifists, we should ask if this shows that there are grounds for thinking Christianity actually requires a pacifist rejection of warfare. And what about the legal conventions governing warfare? Do they represent a reasonable constraint on the conduct of war­fare, and can they be realistically enforced? Finally, what about the morality of warfare? Does morality impose the same constraints on killing innocent people in warfare that it imposes on punishing inno­cent people in civil society? If morality does impose such strong constraints on the killing of inno­cent people in warfare, does this mean that the use of nuclear weapons, even their use as a deterrent, can never be morally justified? 
Questions such as the above are taken up in the newly organized inter-disciplinary course, War, Law, Ethics, which is being team­taught this term at Notre Dame. The instructors for the course are Dr. John H. Yoder, professor of theology, Lt. Col. Henry J. Gordon, professor of military science, Dr. Robert E. Rodes, professor of law, and Dr. James P. Sterba, assistant professor of philosophy, with Dr. Basil K. O'Leary, assistant profes­sor of theology, coordinator for the course. 
The course is divided into five parts. In the first part, Professor Yoder examines the historical development of pacifism and the just war theory from early Chris­tianity to the present, focusing on the continual challenge of Christian pacifism to the justification of warfare. In the second part, Professor Sterba considers the grounds for a moral approach to the topic of warfare and then examines the general requirements of a morality of self-defense and the restrictions these requirements of a morality of self-defense and the restrictions these requirements impose on the justification of warfare. In the third and fourth parts of the course. Professors Gordon and Rodes examine the 

various legal conventions that have 
been adopted to govern warfare. 
They evaluate the effectiveness of 
these conventions and discuss the 
need for new conventions. To deal 
with, for example, guerrilla war­
fare and terrorism. In the final part 
of the course, groups of students 
present to the class the results of 
case studies they have done on 
such topics as the status and rights 
of prisoners in the Civil War and 
World War II; terrorism in 
Northern Ireland and against Israel 
and the use of mass destruction 
weapons. One group of students, 
with the help of other students 
from the law school, enacts a war 
crime trial modeled after the Calley 
trial. 
The course grew out of discus­
sions held last year between mem­
bers of the theology department, 
campus mini!!itry, and the military 
science department; but most of 
the preparatory work for the course 
was done by Professor Gordon and 
Rodes this past summer. All in all, 
the course provides a rare oppor­
tunity for students to integrate for 
themselves various opposing per­
spectives on the topic of warfare. 
While the course, which is cross­
listed in theology and philosophy, 
will be offered again in the winter 
term 1979-80, a course similar in 
structure will be offered next term 
on the topic of civil rights. 
Instructors for this course are Dr. 
Donald P. Kommers, professor of 
government and international 
studies and director of the Center 
for Civil Rights, Dr. James B. 
Stewart. · assistant professor of 
economics and director of the Black 
Studies Program, Dr. Yoder, Dr. 
O'Leary, and Dr. Sterba. This 
course is also cross-listed in 
theology and philosophy as well as 
in government and international 
studies. 
The questions discussed in these courses directly concern students and society in general. All stu­dents should take the time to consider these questions whether or not he takes the course. 
James P. Sterba is an Assistant Professor of PhUosopby and a member of the team who teaches the courses discussed.

A bad _joke 

Dear Editor: 
Your article in The Observer on Nov. 7 about the Fisher Hall resident who suffered a mishap and Security's subsequent response raises some serious questions a­bout the role and quality of security here at Notre Dame. Our prized security force has once again proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is nothing more than a collection of incompetents. When called upon to respond to a real emergency, time and again they fail to execute their functions received six or seven calls in the span of ten minutes, yet the dispatcher's job is to relay emer­gency cans to the hospital and not to make judgements as the extent of an injury, especially when a student's health is concerned. One must also question security's ef­fectiveness when the officers can't tell one dorm from another and get lost. 
Our security force has proven that they cannot: provide adequate protection for coeds. prevent van­dalism on campus. prevent arson­ists from destroying university

WASHINGTON--It was in the Sakowitz Christmas Catalogue un­der the title, '·The Ultimate Gift." Sakowitz is a Houston department store that caters to the VERY rich, and when it comes to thinking up wild Christmas presents, the store obviously is trying to outdo Neiman Marcus, which this year featured a "His and Her Atomic-Proof Vault" in the side of a moutain, where people can store valuables safely from World War III. 
Sakowitz is advertising many wild Christmas presents to play catch-up with Neiman's. But the one that really caught my attention

In the Fisher incident, security emergency aid for students. What can they do? It appears that the 
only thing that they can do is harass students and ticket and tow away cars on footbaJI weekends. Perhaps security should spend less time playing cops and robbers on their CB's and more time learning the names and locations of dorms. how to answer the phone, and the basic first aid techniques. Who's kidding who, security's a bad joke.

The Ulti~nate Gift 
art buchUJttld; 
was an offer to provide "21 celebrities for your special dinner party. LIKE Walter Cronkite, Neil Armstrong, Sen. Henry Jackson, Uri Geller. Gloria Steinem, George Allen, Arthur Ashe, F. Lee Bailey, Bruce Jenner, Dr. Joyce Brothers, Dr. Milton Friedman, Ruth Gordon Minnesota Fats and Buckinster Fuller," among others. The price listed in the catalogue was $94,125. 
As soon as I received the booklet I called Cronkite and said, "Hey, I didn't know you were renting yourself out for Christmas parties these days." 
The usually unflappable Walter sounded really flapped. "There is nothing funny about it. I'm suing those expletives deleted. I wasn't asked about this, I didn't give my permission, and as far as I can find out neither did anybody else who's listed in the catalogue. The whole thing is outrageous." 
"What did Sakowitz say?" wanted to know. "They said, legally, they're pro­tected because the copy for the dinner party has the word LIKE in it. They said they wern 't promising me, but someone LIKE me." 
"But there's only ONE Walter Cronkite," I said. 
"You may take it lightly," Walter said bitterly, "but CBS is not, and we intend · to make Sakowitz desist from pulling this kind of stunt again." 
"Well, I'm glad I called you first," I told him, "because I was just about to send in my check for $94,125 so my wife could have a Christmas party with real live ('elebrities for a change." 
After I finished talking to Walter I got to thinking about whar would have happened if I had sent in my $94,125, and had invited all out neighbors over for a Christmas party to meet this covey of over­achievers. 
This i~ what I envision might have '·.lPI1ened: The aoorbell rings. There is a 
. . .. 

man with sandy hair and a mu­
stache standing there. 
"Hi there. Is this where the 
party is?" 
"Who are you?" 
''I'm LIKE Walter Cronkite." 
"You mean Walter isn't coming 
to my party?" 
"If you read your catalogue 
carefully. Sakowitz did not promise 
you Walter Cronkite but only 
somebody LIKE him." 
"Why arc you LIKE Walter 
Cronkite?" 
"Because I'm an excellent sailor, 
a 'C' tennis player, a well-dressed 
man, and I anchor the evening 
news in Waco, Texas. Your J.~ucsts 
will really flip out when I say, 'And 
that's the way it is." 
Just then a woman arrives. She 
has long. brownish hair and smol­
dering eyes. 
"And pray tell," I say, "who arc 
you?" 

''I'm LIKE Gloria Steinem. and 
if you light my cigarette I'll kno<.:k 
your teeth out." 
"You're not the real Gloria, 
then?" 

"That's a terribly sexist thing to 
say. You wouldn't ask that 
question of a man." 
Another chap comes up and joins 
us. "Is this the Sakowitz Gift 
Party?'' 
 "Who are you?" ''I'm LIKE Neil Armstrong." "Then you're not the fellow who 
got to the moon first?" 
"I'm a glider pilot from Gal­
veston, and I've taken one small 
step for man." 
I get angry and decide to take the 
21 ''celebrities" down to Sakowitz 
to get my $94,125 back. 
The lady behind the Christmas exchange counter says, "We re sorry, but there are no cash refunds on people LIKE Arthur Ashe, F. Lee Bailey, Joyce Brothers, Min­nesota Fats or Ruth Gordon. Once they leave the store they're all considered used merchandise."

Kampiles admits sale of documents to Russia 
HAMMOND, lad. [AP)-A former CIA watch officer, now charged with espionage, admitted to federal authorities that he sold the Soviets top-secret documents, an FBI agent testified yesterday. 
Special Agent James K. Murpny a key prosecution witness, said he interrogated William Kampiles, a 23-year-old Chicago man charged with six counts of espionage, only days before he was arrested in Munster August 17. 
When Assistant U.S. Attorney James Richmond asked Murphy whether Kampiles realized that he had given away important U.S. defense information. Murphy re­plied that Kampiles told him he knew it was a security breach. 
''But I didn't think it would put the .Russians ahead by leaps and bounds," Murphy said Kampiles told him. 
Kampiles, a former CIA watch officer, is accused of selling the Soviets a technical manual on the KH-11 space satellite, which has been used for several years to monitor Soviet troop movements in military installations. 
If convicted, he could receive a maximum sentence of 70 years in prison for each count. 
In earlier testimony Wednesday, Vivian Psachos, a researcher in the CIA's Societ division, said Kampiles was told by a Soviet agent in Greece to furnish informa­tion on missile sites, CIA agents abroad, and a "shopping list," of other available documents. 
Mrs. Psacbos was the second government witness in the trial of 23-year-old William Kampiles, a former CIA watch officer. 
He is accused of selling to the Russins for $3,000 a manual with plans on the KH-11, a sop~isti­cated space satellite used to monitor troop movements and mis­sile installations in the Soviet Union. 
Kampiles, a native of Chicago, was arrested Aug. 17 in an apart­ment in nearby Munster and charged with six counts of es­pionage. 
If convicted, he could receive a maximum sentence of 70 years in prison for each count. Mrs. Psachos testified that she inter­viewed Kampiles with another CIA agent and two FBI officials in a Washington, D.C. hotel, shortly before his arrest. 

She said Kampiles told the government officers that he never mentioned the KH-11 to the Russia agent he met at a party at the Soviet embassy in Athens last winter. 
"Bill Kampiles realized he was a Soviet agent and he decided to play a game," Mrs. Psachos, a 21-year veteran of the CIA, said the defendant had told her. 
She testified that Kampiles met the Russian on three occasions while vacationing in Greece in February and March, and told him he could furnish secret CIA docu­ments. 
Mrs. Psachos said Kampiles told the government interviewers that he lied to the Russian, saying he had worked as an economic analyst for the CIA for two years, that he was 25 or 26 year old, and that he was born and raised in Boston 
She said that to prove that he was not a double agent of "plant," KampiJes gave the Russian, identi­fied as Michael Zavalis, a forged identity card from the CIA. 
But according to Mrs. Psachos, Kampiles told the U.S. officials who interviewed him in Washington, that the ID card was all he gave the Russian. getting contacts with the Russians

Committee narrows Senior Fellow list 
by Rick Travers from student nomination. The list of candidates includes: Allan Aida, Muhammed Ali,
The Senior FelJow Committee Woody Allen, John Belushi, Arthas narrowed the list of candidates Buchwald, Dick Cavett, Bitt Cosby, for this year's Senior Fellow to 25 Phil Donahue, Richard Dreyfuss,from the nearly 200 names received 
Joseph Evans, Katherine Graham, Katherine Hepburn, 
Dustin Hoffman, Bob Hope, Barbara Jordan, Malcolm Muggeridge, Joe Paterno, Dan Rather, Wilma Rudolf, Charles Schultz, Don Shula, Pete Seegar, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Carl Sagan and John Wayne. 
The committee based its de­cisions on four criteria that the candidates must exemplify. They should 1) demonstrate personal qualities of unselfishness and feJ­lowship, 2) have made a significant contribution to society, 3) be out­standing in their particular voca­tion and 4) typify the spirit of the class of '79. 
A forum will be held Thursday evening from 7 to 9 p.m. in the LaFortune lobby so that seniors who strongly support persons not on the list may suggest those names to the committee. 
Another election will be held the last week in November to deter­mine the top five names. From these five names, the Senior Fellow Committee will make the final choice, keeping as close as possible to the election results. 
However, the major factor deter­mining this year's Senior Fellow is which of the top five candidates will be willing to come to Notre Dame during Senior Week. Richard Lugar, last year's Senior Fellow, was voted 18th among the 25 final candidates, but was one of the few able to attend. The committee hopes to avoid this problem this year by organizing the program and contacting desired candidates 
-early enough to insure their avail­ability. "We don't want this to be a popularity contest,'' Tom Meilenhausen of the Senior Fellow Committee stressed, adding, "I want to strongly encourage seniors to vote according to the four criteria as best they see them, and we should have an outstanding Senior Fellow.'' 
Captain Beef heart to appear 

Captain Beefheart and tbe Magic Band will appear tonight at Vege­table Buddies at 9 p.m. 
This appearance is part of a major national tour in support of Captain Beefheart's new alhum. The tour will take Beefheart and the Magic Band to The Roxy in Lost Angeles, San Francisco's Old Waldorf, New York's Bottom Line, and The Paradise in Boston in addition to their South Bend appearance.

St. Mary's widens Spring course list 
by Jean Powley Saint Mary's Editor 

Saint Mary's is offering quite a few new courses this semester in an effort to widen the range of available electives. The following is a list of the new courses according to department: 
Sociology 
American Minorities Dr. 
McKelvey --9TT11 
This course will explore the relations between the dominant white majority in the United States and the various minority groups, such as Afro-Americans, Mexican­Americans and American Indians. The perspective developed in the course takes the view that Ameri­can majority-minority relations could be described as essentially colonial in nature. These relations have been shaped by and are an element in the modern internation­al phenomenon of Western colonial and commercial expansion and industrial and technological de­velopment. 
Philosophy Contempol'811' Theories of Human Nature 
In this course various contem­porary theories of human nature will be considered: Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx. B.F. Skinner, the existentialists and Aristotle. In considering these theories the student will become acquainted with how philosophy is done, what kinds of consideration are philo­sophically relevant, and which arguments are both sound and persuasive. Business Ethics 
The purpose of this course is three-fold: 1 ( To introduce the student to general ethical theory and the nature of moral reflection. 2( To develop skills for recognizing the moral issues which normally arise in the context of business­individual and corporate responsibility; self-interest versus social responsibility; justice; hiring practices; whistle-blowing; duties to the natural environment. 3( To aid the sstudent in applying sound moral judgement to the very diffi­cult issues faced in the business world. Philosophy of Religion 
Among the questions tha have interested believers and unbeliev­ers alike are those concerning the reasonableness of belief in the existence of God, the problem of evil, whether there is life after life, the nature of religious experience, and the relation between religious belief and values. This course will consider these q uesteons. Theories of Mind 
This course will examine what is 
consciousness, metaphysical 
status, how mind and body are 
related, etc. Students will read 
both historical and contemporary 
philosophers on the question of the 
mind. 
Music 
The Musical Idea 
A seminar-style opportunity to 
talk and think about music in a 
non-technical manner. Open to all 
students with some understanding 
of musical style. Specific master­
pieces will be discussed from 
varied viewpoints: the critic, the 
informed listener, the commenta­
tor. There will also be a "field 
trip'' to a major symphony concert. 
Religious Studies Religion and Values: The Urban Plunge The Bible and the Arts 
An in-depth analysis of four to six themes selected from the Bible. It will explore the uses of these themes in literature, music and the visual arts. Theology and the Hispanic Theater 
A study of the Hispanic theater and its contribution toward the appreciation of the human situa­tion. Emphasis placed on religious thought and sensibilities as a means of understanding Hispanic societies and cultures. Chrlsdan Marriage and Family

This is an introductory seminar­style course designed to expose students who have had no back­ground in non-Western cultures to the beauty and majesty of the Far Eastern civilizations of China and Japan. The Middle East 
his course will attempt to come to grips with the complex past and present of this region. Without a knowledge of this area's long history, it is impossible to under­stand its modern development, conflicts, problems and inter­national relationships. 
lathematics Linear Algebra 
This course involves linear equations, matrices and vector spaces. It is designed for students who are not math majors but who wish to see more deeply into what 

mathematics  is  and how  it  is  
applied.  
Modem Geometr ies  
Students  will  look  at  non­ 

Euclidean geometries, projective geometry and transformational geometry. The course is designed to provide students with a broader view of geometry than high school plane geometry gives.

Hesburgh to receive Clark Award 
Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh, president of Notre Dame, is among three persons receiving Grenville Clark Awards for distinguished public service by a private citizen. 
The awards honor a New York 
civil liberties, academic freedom, 

1 human rights, world peace, and 
1 good government. 
I The $15,000 prize, dispensed by 
I, a fund at Dartmouth College, was 
1 shared this year by Hesburgh, Jack Greenberg, and Sydney Kentridge. Hesburgh has announced that his share will endow a Grenville Clark award at Notre Dame to be given annually to a member of the University community--student, faculty member or administrator-­, 'whose voluntary activities serve to advance the causes of peace and I human rights. 
1 
The Clark Award is similar to the Reinhold Niebuhr Award set up in 1972 by Hesburgh with an award honorarium given him by friends of the internationally known theologian. The Niebuhr Award is given annually to a member of the Notre Dame community for work on behalf of social justice.

''The explQsion was deafening , and it thundered through Limay,'' said Rene D. Herrera, safety and fjre .Protection supervisor at the refinmg company. "Black smoke rose ahout 1,000 feet above the ship immediately after the exi?lo­sion." Pockets of fire from burnmgoil were seen in the water near the ship, he said. 
The e~plosion, which reportedly split the hull of the Feoso Sun in two, occurred off Limay, an indus­trial complex on the Bataan penin­sula 30 miles west of Manila on the western shore of Manila Bay. The tanker was registered in Panama. 
The i ship's bow protruded from the water where it sank, about 
1.000 yards offshore. 
Frogmen were trying to pene­trate the sunken stern of the 20,824 deadweight-ton ship, Balitas said. 'jMost of the missing were believed trapped in the stern. 
Balitas said officials of the Bataan Refinery Corp., which had taken off the cargo of 19, 564 metric' tons of Chinese crude oil before the explosion, reported the Feoso Sun had returned to its anchorage and was being surveyed by damage specialists wnen the blast occurrea. 
He said the tanker had been damaged on a previous port call, but he did not know where. 
Balitas said the ship's captain, Ng Wing Sum of Hong Kong, was reported ashore at the time of the blast trying to contact the ship's owners, Feoso Sun Tankers, S.A. to get clearance for drydocking the damaged vessel. 
"We are conducting an investi­gation into the cause," Balitas said. "It was empty, and there were fumes, and there probably were sparks from some source that set it off.''
