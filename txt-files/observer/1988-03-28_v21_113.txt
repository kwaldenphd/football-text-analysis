100 free; rebel pact begins 
Associated Press 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua ­
The Sandinista government freed 100 political prisoners Sunday under an amnesty pro­gram, fulfilling the first part of a cease-fire pact with Nicaraguan rebels. 
Interior Minister Tomas Borge called the gesture "pos­sibly the beginning of the end of the war." 
Tearful family members embraced their loved ones who were released from the Zona Franca jail on the outskirts of Managua. But amid the joy was an air of doubt. 
"They say I don't have anyth­ing to fear," said Feliz Pedro Chavaria Gomez, 32, holding a plastic sack containing his belongings. "I'm happy, but I hope it doesn't fail." 
Chavaria said he was ar­rested in 1980 and charged with being a counter-revolutionary. 
Cesar Augusto Flores Mireando, 25, was arrested more than two years ago in Managua. "The majority of the peasants here are innocent," he said. 
The release of the prisoners was the first step in an amnesty plan the Sandinistas agreed to Wednesday when they signed a cease-fire accord with leaders of the U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras. The sides declared a truce March 21 and a a 60-day cease-fire is to begin Aprill.

PALMEROLA AIR BASE, Honduras--Helicopters carry­ing tired, dirt-smeared U.S. soldiers swarmed back to this military base Sunday and the troopers prepared to return home. 
"We accomplished what we came here to do--put the Nicaraguans back in their place," Sgt. Matthew West said as he climbed out of a helicop­ter at the end of a flight from training exercises in Juticalpa, about 40 miles from the Honduran-Nicaraguan border. 
"Now we just want to get clean," said West, 21, from Dal­las.

Three Arabs shot in the West Bank 
Associated Press 
MEITHALUN, Occupied West Bank-Israel said its troops shot three Arabs in the West Bank on Sunday after Palestinians attacked soldiers with iron bars, but villagers ac­cused the soldiers of firing at cars carrying wounded. 
Israeli soldiers killed a 
fourth Palestinian in another 
West Bank town while trying to 
rescue an Israeli tour bus that 
blundered into the Arab com­
munity.

U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz's meeting Saturday in Washington with two univer­sity professors linked to the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
Shultz met with Edward Said 
and Ibrahim Abu-Lughud, 
American citizens who belong 
to the PLO's legislative arm. 
The meeting prompted 
protests from Israel, which 
views the PLO as an illegal ter­
rorist group.

Show to raise money
Aging problems studied 
Associated Press 
SOUTH BEND, Ind.-­Americans may be living longer, but for many people those extra years bring only ad­ditional disease, suffering and expense, said a prominent re­searcher on aging. 
Dr. Jacob A. Brody, address­ing a symposium on diet and aging Sunday, credited a decline in heart disease with a sharp drop in the death rate since the late 1960s. 
But he told researchers gath­ered at Notre Dame the growing number of elderly people will mean dramatic in­creases in disabling conditions that afflict old people. 
"What we really need to be concerned about in living longer is, are we leading healthier lives?" he asked. 
For each extra year of healthy life, Americans are en­during three to four extra years of bad health, said Brody, pro­fessor of epidemiology and dean of the School of Public Health at the University of Il­linois in Chicago. 
"We've got to work on that," he said. "That's the weight, the sense of fear of growing old, and the burden society has in taking care of (the aged.)" 
Brody delivered the keynote address to a three-day meeting of researchers gathered to report findings on the effect of reduced calorie intake on rats. While a link between reduced diet and longer life was es­tablishd 50 years ago, research conducted through Notre Dame's Lobund Laboratory may shed light on why, says

Want Respect? Don't work in a restaurant 
If you want to retain any respect for your fellow human beings, never, never work in a restaurant. 
I worked for about a year-and-a-half at a place called Friendly's --sort of a cross be­tween a Denny's and a Dairy Queen. I went in young and innocent, eager to do my best to serve the customer. I left a distorted, bitter misanthrope, thirsting for vengance, wanting to hurt and maim those who had wronged me. 
I am firmly convinced that people undergo a complete attitude change when they enter a restaurant. Somebody may normally be an upright, decent citizen. It doesn't make any dif­ference. As soon as they enter a restaurant, they become a cruel, domineering tyrant, treat­ing the staff as if they were chattel. 
When we were waiting to close, for example, there would inevitably be two people holding us up, sitting over a single cup of coffee each for a half-hour. 
We had ways to subtly give them the hint, "Leave NOW!!" 
The gate at the front of the store would be lowered halfway. We would shut off all of the lights in the place except in the section they were sitting in. The rest of the tables would be cleaned off and set up for the next day. 
Ifthis didn't work, the entire staff would stand and pathetically stare at the offenders, trying and announced, in an obnoxious, nasal voice, to look as pitiable as possible. The dishboy "I want ice cream!" would go up to them and say, "Excuse me, "I'm sorry," I said (even though I wasn't), ma'am, but are you done with that fork and "but you'll have to wait until I serve the people plate? I have nothing else to do right now, so in front of you." I'd like to wash them." "NO!" she screamed. "It's MY BIRTHDAY,

GSU elects new officers 
By ROBYN SIMMONS News Staff 
Vidor Krebs's uncontested ticket was elected March 9 to lead the Graduate Student Union. 
Krebs will serve as president with vice-president Jeffrey Smart, secretary Linda Taylor, and information officer Brian Rosmaita. 
Mark Borden, originally slated as social officer, backed out and will be replaced soon, Krebs said. 
Krebs said one of his main objectives is to increase the 1,346 graduate students' in­volvement with the rest of the Notre Dame commmunity. 
Several projects will soon begin to accomplish this, he said. Committees working with the undergradute student gov­ernment will plan and organize campus-wide cultural and so­cial activities, he added. 
Krebs also said he hopes to continue the Travel Grant pro­gram, which helps graduate students pay their travel ex­penses to academic conferences. 
"That's where most of our money goes," said outgoing vice-president Adria Colletti. "An important part of our edu­cation is going to these confer­ences and presenting your re­search and meeting other people in your field." 
Sixty-seven percent of the graduate students' $20 activity fee goes to the travel grant pro­gram, she said. 
'The Union, however, has problems motivating students to get involved because they have so much work to do, Krebs said. "One of the reasons is that grad students don't live on campus," he said, "Obviously the needs of grad students are different." 
About 33 percent of Notre Dame's graduate students are married while Brownson Hall and Saint Joseph's Hall are the only dorms which house graduate students. 
"Obviously, more housing has to be available that is closer so that (graduate stu­dents) are not so far from campus." said Krebs. 
In the long run, Krebs said he plans to start graduate stu­dent committees for campus ministry, social concerns, wo­men and minority issues, housing, fund raising and inter­national graduate students. 
Krebs also added that he would like to revitalize and ex­pand the programs created in the Graduate Student Union's early years, after its concep­tion in 1969. "Grad students were a minority and they needed a way to fit into the rest of the community,'' said Krebs.

According to the legislation, another undisclosed number of Contra rebels taken prisoner during the six-year civil war will be released at an un­specified later date. The gov­ernment also plans a general review of the cases of about 1,800 members of Somoza's 
Guard, Ortega said. 
Speaking to reporters Satur­

former guardsmen all have 
been accused of human rights 
violations or crimes against 
humanity-such as the indis­
criminate shooting of civilians­
-during the one-year revolution 
that brought the Sandinistas to 
power. 
Many of them have been sen­tenced to the maximum penalty of 30 years imprison­ment, Ortega said. The downfall of Somoza, a rightist pro-American strongman, ended 42 years of iron-fisted rule by his family, usually en­forced by the National Guard.

territory in the Bocay region. 
Honduran military officials said the invading Sandinistas were after a major supply 
depot the u.s.-backed
Nicaraguan rebels maintained just inside Honduras. American soldiers said their mission was a success. 
"Our presence here definitely made a difference," said Sgt. Dale Taylor, 22, of Red Springs, N.C. "It proves how serious we are about what we are doing and that we can get here in 18 hours if the need arises." 
The Reagan administration called the military action a training exercise, but it also was meant as a warning to the Sandinistas against further ac­tion inside Honduran territory. 
And despite a few tense days during which the Honduran air force twice bombed Sandinista positions in the Bocay region of western Olancho province, the 
U.S. soldiers were involved only in training maneuvers. 
The Sandinistas, while claiming their soldiers had never entered Honduran terri­tory, withdrew their troops from the area about two days after the American troops ar­rived.

The International Student Organization and the Multicul­tural Council co-sponsored the annual International Festival Saturday night in Washington Hall. 
The Festival, a variety show comprised of "song, dance, comedy and awareness acts" from all over the world, had seventeen acts, ranging from an Indonesian dance, to an Irish ballad, to a Lebanese folkdance and a performance by the Ballroom Dance Club. 
"We created an awareness of the other cultures we have on campus," said Joe Henriquez, a sophmore from Curacao and co-president of ISO. "I was fas­cinated by the crowd; Wash­ington Hall was packed and we even had to turn some people away," he said. 
"I like being in the Festival Patricia Idusogie, from Nigeria. "It's very interesting

ISO organizes many events to integrate international stu­dents at Notre Dame and in­crease student awareness of the diverse cultural represen­tation on campus. The group also sponsors the International Banquet in the fall, maintains the ISO lounge, and organizes movie nights, lecture series, picnics and parties. 
"For some (international students) there is a language or a cultural barrier; for them, the purpose of ISO is to help them adapt," said Ramzi Bualuan, a graduate student from Lebanon who advised the Festival.

sample I overheard the other day and it might be a good idea just to get the full mor­ning ambience to maybe go ahead and act this one out with two of your friends. A lot of our finest drama is going un­noticed over lunch these days and damn it, I think it's time we did something about it. 
It is in this spirit that I pres­ent the script for what I like to call "Mornings...yuck... ": DROWSY GUY# 1: MMMMuurrttu glogglett mertdlip, Bargle ... wommmerspongle dibbly. (translated loosely as ''I've got Friday on my mind." DROWSY GUY#2: Shubby zubby wollubby, McFrubby? (Translated from the original ZOOM language as "Shubby zubby wollubby, McFrubby?") #1: Zeksap blimblip wotnoo yarl. ("Gee, with your hair like that you look like Albert Einstein.") 
# 2: Embee owlblubby gubby 
hattam retfrop...mubby... ("So 
does your mother.") 
(Enter The Morning Person.) 
THE MORNING PERSON: Good 
morning. fellows! What a 
simply marvelous morning to 
be alive on this planet! I love 
the morning time! Breathe it in! 
(Unfortunately, at this point, 
our ironic little drama takes on 
darker overtones as Drowsy 
Guys One and Two jump on 
The Morning Person, rip his 
esophagus out, and jump up 
and down on it.) 
So at long length, I think I've cleared the air about this whole Morning debacle. I suggest that all normal people out there follow my lead and go now and take a little nap. As for any Morning "People" I may have offended, don't get mad, JUST GET BACK IN BED!!

I personally daydream about sleep. I draw pictures of sleep­Ing Individuals In my note­books. I yawn all day long. I hate It when, in the middle of the day, I see mattress com­mercials or something showing anyone sleeping peacefully. It makes me want to sleep. As a matter of fact seeing just about anything makes me want to sleep. 
Kevin Walsh 
What a great concept sleep is. When you think about It what does sleep acomplish? Absolutely nothing!. f1A Hal Nothing at alii You totally for­get about the real world for a few hours every night and you get to return to the womb. All that psychobabble about people wanting to return to the womb is just the repression of the basic fact that all scientists need sleep. What exactly went on in the much-touted womb that was so great? You slept, that's what you did. 
So, extrapolating from this polnt...and doing other things that cause you to use large words...one realizes that not only does one hate it when one writes sentences of personal observation using "one" as the subject, but also that the time when one is forced to stop sleeping has got to be the lamest time of day. Obviously, morning. 
And believe me, much schol­arly and scientific thought through the ages has gone into determining The Lamest Time Of The Day. 
Herman Melville once wrote, "One of the coolest and wisest hours a man has is just after he awakes in the morning." 
Just goes to prove the old saying. "Never take wisdom from a guy named Herman." 
If I could be allowed to take a few liberties with ol' Herm's quote there, I'd change it to "Mornings suck." 
One thing I really hate about the morning is these "people" who call themselves Morning People. That kills me. I guess they think that just because they like getting up in the mor­ning that they can call them­selves Morning People. Where I come from we have a different name for Morning People, but it probably wouldn't be appro­priate for print. 
The fact that these people actually LIKE getting up in the morning makes me wonder what else these people LIKE. Maybe they savor jamming hot sewing needles up both their nostrils at lunch. Perhaps they enjoy shaving their chest with cheese graters. Probably they relish smashing their fingers in car doors. 
One of the coolest and wisest things about the morning be­sides the way your face always looks are the conversations that take place. Here is a

Tom Tolbert scored 18 of his 21 points in the second half and converted two critical three­point plays as No. 2 Arizona defeated No. 7 North Carolina 70-52 Sunday for a berth in the NCAA Final Four. 

All-American forward Sean Elliott led Arizona with 24 points and teamed with frontcourt mates Tolbert and Anthony Cook in a collapsing 2-3 zone defense to shacke North Carolina All-American forward J .R. Reid, who was held to 10 points. 
The victory in the West Regional championship game, Arizona's 15th straight, put the Wildcats, 35-2, in the national semifinals against No. 4 Okla­homa at Kansas City next Sat­urday. The Sooners downed Villanova 78-59 in the Southeast Regional final behind the 28 points of Stacey King. 
Duke will meet Kansas in the other national semifinal with the two winners meeting next Monday night for the title. 
All-American Danny Man­ning scored 20 points, and Scooter Barry added a career­high 15 as Kansas advanced to the Final Four for the second time in three years with a 71-58 victory Sunday over No. 20 Kansas State in the Midwest Regional championship game.

the Fan Club, and now-you-see­it-now-you-don't passes from Rivers. 
"Its fun to get out and have a good time," said Rivers, who played along with the Fan Club's jokes and showed the crowd plenty of razzle-dazzle in his only Bookstore appearance in four years at Notre Dame. "That's stuff I grew up doing, and I have a pretty good time doing things like--it makes the game fun." 
One of the Fan Clubs defen­sive sets inc1uded the 'Heisman defense,' as the players rushed their opponents and struck the familiar pose of the bronzed player which sits atop the coveted Heisman Trophy. 
In another defensive mauever, the Fan Club called for the 'Rivers defense' sur­rounding Rivers and as soon as he took one step, falling to the ground as a referee raced on to the court and called a charge. 
The action went to the other end of the court, where the Fan Club pulled Steve Nicgorski out of the crowd to shoot and con­nect on his patent free throw offering.

the day was when the Fan Club lined up in punt formation and booted the ball down court. And in a way it was September again as Brown fielded the kick cleanly, juked to the sideline and headed home for a ... gliding dunk. 
The Fan Club pulled several other stunts to keep the crowd laughing, including a hostage defense where a masked captor held a Fan Club team member at gunpoint until everyone backed away and the hostage scored on a layup. Another sneaky manuver created an easy layup when the Fan Club called time out and then called it back in when Lou's 2 QB's casually walked to the sideline for a breather. 
Rice, who led all scorers with 9-of-11 shooting and dunking, will continue in the tournament on Lou's 2 QBs with Baldes, Kent Graham, Jeff Peters and Lou Holtz.

We Like Bug Juice defused Spaceman Spiff and his Spacely Sprockets, 21-10, and in doing so, ensured captain Mike 'Eggroll' Caponigro of scoring at least one point every year he has played in the tourna­ment. He had one last year as well. 
"I don't know how ·we managed to win with a com­plete liability such as myself on the team," said Eggroll. "Just lucky I guess." 
Billy Jennings led Bug Juice with seven points and ten rebounds.

Holtz was pleased to get an extended (two-and-a-half hours) look at everyone on his squad, and, with few excep­tions, was reluctant to name preseason favorites to start. 
"The way they played today, I'd have to say that Stony (Mike Stonebreaker) and (Wes) Pritchett look pretty good at linebacker," said Holtz. "We'll go back and look at everything, and ct>rtainly the way some people played will affect where they stand on the team, but nothing is set as far as afirst line is concerned." .

Irish open outdoor season

On an afternoon that resembled a wintry, January day as opposed to a spring-like day of late, the Irish men's track team opened their 1988 outdoor season at Krause Stadium, hosting the Notre Dame Invitational. 
The afternoon featured gus­ting winds of up to 25 miles per hour which made the sub-50 degree temperatures seem much colder. Even with the ad­verse weather conditions, the Irish turned in several impres­sive performances. 
The highlight of the meet oc­curred in the hammer throw

complete game victory of his own. Madsen's five-hitter, his second straight complete game victory and the second com­plete game of his career, put the junior's record at 5-1 for the season. 
"I think wins and losses aren't the most important thing," Murphy said in discuss­ing the performance of his pitchers. "He's happened to throw well, but so has (Mike) Passilla and so has (Mike) Har­mon." 
Right fielder Dan Peltier led the hitting attack for the Irish in the first game. The sopho­more from Clifton Park, N.Y., batted 2-for-2 with a walk, driving in one run and scoring the team's two other runs. 
"Peltier's a stud," said Murphy. "If he plays 100 games for you, he'll play very well in 85 of them, and you can't ask for any more from a player." 
The Irish only managed five hits in each game on Sunday, but were able to manufacture single runs in the third, fifth and sixth innings of the second game to take a 3-0 victory. 
Playing at Butler on Satur­day, Notre Dame used strong 
pitching performances from
Kevin Chenail, Tom Howard and Harmon to get another doubleheader sweep. 
In the first game, Chenail pitched a complete game five­hitter. The Irish, who got just three hits themselves, scored all five of their runs in a third­inning rally to earn a 5-1 vic­tory. 

Ed Lund keyed the outburst with a triple that drove in two runs. Lund caught both games on Saturday and Sunday and appears to have won the catch­ing job. The starting position had been up for grabs since the beginning of the season. 
"I feel like we're going to go with him," said Murphy. "We need a stick in the lineup, and he also does as good a job catching as anybody. He's eager to learn, and he will be a good player." 
Howard started the second 
game, allowing two runs before 
being replaced by Harmon in 
the fifth inning. The game went 
into extra innings, and Pat

which was the first event of the meet. Tom Mick placed first with a throw of 170 feet 5 inches which qualified him for the IC4A Outdoor Championships. 
Mick's victory set the tone of things to come in the javelin and the shot put. Freshman Ryan Mihalko placed first in the javelin with a throw of 199 feet 10 lt2 inches while sopho­more Rob Fitzgerald placed second in the shot put with a toss of 47 feet 9 lt2 inches. 

Junior David Warth finished second in the 1500-meter run for the Irish, posting a time of 
3: 59.7. Freshman Richard Culp ran an impressive 49.86 to place fourth in the 400 meter dash. Mark Lavery and 1' · '"i'l Whalen took second and third respectively in the 800 meter run. 

The tandem of freshman jumpers Jeff Smith and John Cole turned in another excel­lent day. Smith took third in his first triple jump of the year with a distance of 44 feet 7 114 inches, and Cole captured second in the high jump, leaping 6 feet 8 inches. 
The sprinting events were marked by two second-place finishes for the Irish. Senior Tony Ragunas ran 11.18 in the 100 meter dash while freshman Robert Harris ran 23.06 in the 200 meter dash.

ND netters rally to 6-3 win over EMU 
By FRANK PASTOR Sports Writer 
There is perhaps no more 
accurate measure of a 
team's character than its 
ability to come from behind. 
Friday evening in the Eck 
Tennis Pavilion, the Notre 
Dame women's tennis team 
proved its mettle in spectac­
ular fashion. 

Natalie Illig, Michelle 
Dasso and CeCe Cahill each 
posted come-from-behind 
victories in leading the Irish 
to a 6-3 win over Eastern 
Michigan, running the 
team's record to 8-12 for the 
season. 

Coach Michele Gelfman 
attributes the victory to an 
increase in the level of inten­
sity which each of her 
players brought into the 
match. 

If the Irish were playing 
below their potential on 
Friday, no one would have 
guessed it by their singles 
performances. Notre .Dame 
took five of six singles 
matches, including four in 
straight sets. 

Kim Pacella was the first 
to complete her match, 
cruising by Gina Radecki 6­
o, 6-0 at number four singles. 
Right behind her was Cathy Bradshaw, who handily defeated Marie Morin 6-1, 6­1 at number six singles. Then, after Alice Lohrer dropped her number three singles match 6-3, 6-1 to Rhonda Brown, the Irish closed out with three ster­ling comeback wins. 
At number two singles, Dasso fought back from being down a break point in the first set to take a 6-5 lead which she would never relin­quish in defeating Marta Varanda 7-5, 6-2. 
In the number five singles position, Illig battled Wendy W aler to a 6-6 tie in the first set, then pulled out a 7-2 tie­breaker to capture the set. The second set virtually mir­rored the first, as the junior won a 7-1 tiebreaker to take both the set and the match. 
Notre Dame won one of its three doubles matches. At number one, Cahill and Dasso combined to defeat Kaercher and Sunita Whitehead 6-4, 6-1. Lohrer and Illig lost 6-1, 6-3 to the team of Varanda and Radecki at number two doubles. In the number three position, the freshman tan­Pesavento's bases-loasded single in the eighth drov~ in James Sass with the winning run as the Irish won 3-2. 
dem  of  Bradshaw  and  
Pacella lost  to  Waler  and  
Brown 6-4, 2-6, 6-4.  

"Pesavento has been such a 

clutch performer for us," said 
Murphy. "He's a leader on the 
field, and he does the little 
things. He makes us click and 
always does something to con­
tribute to our winning." 

Notre Dame started the 
weekend by losing to Wisconsin 
9-2 on Friday in a matchup that 
was switched from Coveleski 
Stadium to Jake Kline Field 
hours before the game. 

The Badgers' Tom Fischer, 
projected to be a first-round choice in this spring's major 
league draft, teased the Irish 
hitters all day long. Even 

though Notre Dame touched him for 10 hits, Fischer kept getting batters out when Notre Dame had runners in scoring position. 
"I can see why he's a high draft choice pitcher," said Murphy. "He was throwing 88 mph, he has a good idea about his breaking pitch and he's a 
competitor. You witnessed a big league performance." 
Wisconsin broke open a close game by scoring five runs in the top of the ninth inning to make the final score 9-2.

The Notre Dame men's fen­cing team saved its best for last in placing second at the NCAA Championships last weekend at Princeton, N.J. 
Todd Griffee turned in an out­standing performance by placing second in the epee championships on Saturday, the last day of competition. The Saturday performance lifted Notre Dame to second, as the Irish started the day in third place behind Columbia and

1n 1mprov1ng to 12-11 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Assistant Sports Editor 

It was less than a month ago when the Notre Dame baseball team opened its season by allowing 49 runs in its first four games. 
But the Irish made those days seem like ancient his­tory last weekend on their way to winning four of five games and pushing their record above .500. 

Notre Dame fell to Wis­consin 9-2 on Friday, swept a doubleheader from Butler on Saturday by scores of 5-1 and 3-2, then swept a pair from Chicago State Sunday by scores of 3-1 and 3-0. 
"Pitching and defense wins games, and they were very consistent, which pleased me," said first-year Irish coach Pat Murphy. "We've got to keep our con­sistency, and we can't get 
good as winning the team title. I'm thrilled to place ahead of 

complacent now. We've got to keep playing at an even keel." 
The Irish, who have won six of their last seven games, now hold a record of 12-11. It marks the first time Notre Dame has been over .500 since an Opening Day vic­tory over Duke on Feb. 25. 
Sunday's doubleheader with Chicago State perhaps best illustrated the sudden rejuvenation of the Irish pitching staff. In the first game at Stanley Coveleski Stadium, sophomore Brian Piotrowicz, who had struggled with an earned run average in double fig­ures for the first part of the season, recorded his second consecutive complete game victory in a four-hit win. 
In the second game, Erik Madsen followed suit with a

Lou's 2 QB's and Two Other Blind Guys, featuring Rivers and Brown in guest appear­ances along with Pat Walsh, Tony Rice and George Baldus won the game 21-11, over The Digger Phelps Fan Club and Five Other Guys, but the show was what will be remembered. 
The first sign of action came from the north as Digger Phelps Fan Club and Five Other Guys, perched in the back of a pickup truck, were escorted by a Notre Dame se­curity car to courtside. Don­ning tuxedos and coached by a well-coiffed GQ type imper­sonating you-know-who, the Fan Club quickly began their antics. 
There was little doubt that Rivers and Brown would bear the brunt of the Fan Club's pranks, which began in the team introductions. All five members of the Fan Club were introduced as 5-6 guards from Jersey City, New Jersey, and one of them carried out a hand towel with 'T-81' written on it, drawing laughs from the crowd and an amused smirk from the He is man Trophy winner. 
When the game began it was showtime--as in vaudeville for

After starting with a 6-7 Normile won that match 10-2 to record in the seeding polls, win the championship. Griffee defeated Air Force's Scott Shinberg, Illinois' Tim Hensley and Columbia's Mark Oshima to earn a spot in the semifinals. 
"Griffee fenced his best bout of the year against Oshima,'' said Irish assistant Matt Har­ris. "He got a good seed and used it well. He really had a fabulous day." 
He lost to John Normile of Co­lumbia in the semifinal, but he rebounded from that loss by beating defending champion Jim O'Neill of Harvard 10-3. The win over O'Neill gave him another chance at Normile, but

Football season may not ex­actly be right around the cor­ner, but it's never too early for Head Coach Lou Holtz to start thinking about this year's cam­paign. 
One of his first indicators of 
Spring 

[I]
Football 
1988 

the year's potential took place Sunday afternoon at Cartier Field, during a full-contact spring scrimmage. 
With familiar faces and some not-so-familiar faces trying to make their best impressions, Holtz isn't interested with set­ting a depth chart yet, but he is working on it. 
"At this point of the season," said Holtz, in his third year as head coach of the Irish, "we're not looking to evaluate the of­fense or the defense. We're simply trying to evaluate the personnel. A scrimmage like this will help the thing take shape." 
The backfield of the first of­fense was extremely impres­sive, with each back getting good yardage in the formally­officiated scrimmage. Tony Brooks had two rushing touch­downs, one in which he took a pitch, got stuffed, reversed his field and scampered about 60 yards for the score. Ricky Wat­ters rushed with authority and caught a long touchdown pass near the end of the scrimmage. 
Anthony Johnson had several double-digit gains, Joe Jarosz scored two touchdowns, and senior Mark Green, with a scin­tillating break to the outside, broke off a long touchdown run early in the afternoon. However, Green was not as 
successful at flanker, his newly-found offensive position. He dropped a couple of well­thrown Tony Rice passes, but that doesn't worry Holtz. 
"Sure, Green dropped a couple," said Holtz. "That's the kind of thing that happens early in the season, especially at a new position. It's early, and we're a very young football team. (Yesterday), we made a lot of mistakes that a young team will make. Our tackling was very poor, we're not hitting well, we turned the ball over, and, even though we asked the refs to call a tight scrimmage, we had way, way too many penalties, especially holding. We're not yet a fundamentally sound football team. 
"That's not to say that some things weren't encouraging. I thought the offensive line surged very well off the ball. Tony Rice had a strong scrim­mage, although we didn't protect him very well. The de­fensive line was decent, in par­ticular, (freshmen) George Williams and George Marshall. Then again, they were up against some pretty young of-
