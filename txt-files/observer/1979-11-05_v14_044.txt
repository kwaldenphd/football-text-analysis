With guns blazing 
Jet fighters scatter ·protesters 
La Paz, Bolivia (AP) -Two Bolivian air force jet fighters roared over downtown La Paz yesterday wtth their guns blazing, scattering students and workers who had gathered in a central plaza to protest the 4-day-old military regime. 
There were no immediate reports ofcasualties. It appeared that the pilots sought only to intimidate the civilians 10 San Francisco Plaza and did not fire directly at them. 
The plaza was also surrounded by about 20 tanks and armored cars, and one was heard ·firing a cannon shot. ­
San Francisco Plaza is five blocks from the 
presidential palace, headquarters of Col. Alber­
to Natusch, who declared himself £>resident after 
leading a coup against Bolivia's e1vilian govern­
ment last Thursday. 
A local report said the planes attacked the presidential palace, but journalists who later went to the palace found it to be untrue. 
The buzzing incident followed a night of bloody clashes between soldiers and anti-coup students and workers. 
Civilians building barricades on city streets Saturday night were attacked by troops who kept up ~unfire barrages for about five hours. The Boltvian Red Cross and the central hospital said at least 20 persons were killed and 40 wounded in that violence. 
A broadcast communique issued yesterday by Natusch described Saturday night's bloody crackdown and the jet flights Sunday as part of a ''cleanup'' operation.

In Tehran 


Angry mob storms US embassy 
(AP)-A mob of Iranian students overran U.S. Marine guards in a three-hour struggle yesterday and invaded the American Embassy in Tehran, seizing dozens ofstaffmembers as hostages, Tehran Aadio reported. They demanded that the United States send the exiled shah back to Iran for trial, the radio said. 
No serious injuries were reported. Tehran Radio said as many as 100 hostages were being held, but an Iranian Foretgn Ministry spokesman said he believed it was fewer than 45--about 35 Americans and seven or eight Iranians. 
One of the ·hostages is a Notre Dame alumnus. The State Department declined to identify the individual, but said there has been no violence so far during the incident. 

about an hour after students and workers began 
rebuilding street barricades. 
The jets could be seen swooping low over the 
plaza and opening fire. One source who has 
followed the military situation here closely and 
was near the action said they made a half-dozen 
passes and ap£>eared to fire as they angled 
upward, indicat10g they did not intend to shoot 
those in the plaza. 
Earlier yesterday Natusch declared martial law and press censorship throughout Bolivia as r speculation :tnounted that dissident military units were planning a counter-coup against him. 
Well-informed sources said yesterday that the 
police in the eastern city of Cochabamba, 
Bolivia's third-largest, had declared themselves 
in rebellion against the Natusch government. 
The report could not otherwise be confirmed. 
The national labor confederation called a 
general strike Thursday in protest of what its 
leader called the "fascist" military takeover. 
The strike has since been joined by the national 
businessmen's group. 
The civilian president deposed in the Natusch 
coup, Walter Guevara, was still in hiding with 
his entire Cabinet. 
Bolivia has had some 200 coups in its 154 years 
as a republic. Gen. David Padilla, who took 
power in a coup last November, set the stage for 
democratic elections earlier this year. But none 
of the presidential candidates received a 
majority, and the selection of a president was 
turned over to Congress, which chose the 
68-year-old Guevara.

Park assassination sparks international reactions 
by Mary Fran Callahan StaffReporter 
South Korean President Park Chung-Hee's October 26th as­s_assination has sparked reac­twns from international ex­per~s, military personnel, and natlve Koreans. 
Like a scene out of a Shake­s~earean play, ·a diplomatic dmner party ended in a blood­bath when KCIA chief Kim Jae ~yu suddenly opened fire, kill­mg Park and several of his body guards. Within hours of the news, the Carter administration reaffirmed its military commit­ment to South Korea by placing 32,000 ground troops on high alert. 
Last Tuesday evening, the wire services disclosed that the United States Navy's 7th Fleet command ship USS Blue Ridge paid a ''good will'' visit to Pusan--parading by the major Korean port. 
Commending the United States for literally sticking to its guns to protect South Korea, Professor George Brinkley, from the department of Govern­ment and International Studies, commented,' 'The U.S. has done the right thing. In 1950, war broke out because the United States pulled out.''

Over bloodbath 
Leaders call for federal inquiry 
by DavidL. Langford Associated Press Writer 
The bloodbath at an anti-Ku Klux Klan rally in Greensboro, N.C., was a natural outgrowth of unabated recent Klan violence, Southern civil rights leaders say, calling for an immediate federal inquiry. 
Over the past 18 months, the various organizations operating in the guise of the Hooded Order have become increas­ingly militant, inciting violence 
reminiscent of the mid-1960s in
Decatur and Selma, Ala., and Tupelo and Okolan, Miss. . There is no proof that Satur­

The leaders of three of the most visible Klans were not available for comment yester­day about the Greensboro shootings. -­

Grace's food sales manager John Julian, confirmed a 50-50 percentage but would not com­ment on total intake. Grace President Curt W esseln did say that the amount taken in was "small in comparison to other dorms such as Planner." He stated that what money was received went towards general hall expenses. 
Planner President Don Cian­cao stated that the take was 
 down slightly this year to about $150 a week, which is directed to the Planner treasury. The mone>: is used for any game room 1n1provements needed or for general usage. 
In spite of the tremendous amounts of money involved players need not worry that th~ machines are set to ''gyp'' them out ~f their free games. The machmes are set in the factory to give free games 35 per ce~t of the time, according to Netman. And, while the 
operatorscan make slight adjust­ments m the positions of bum­pers and flippers to make the game more difficult, "it would be a self-defeating tactic be­cause surveys show that games that are seen as being too difficult will simply not be played," Nieman said. "And there is no way that the operators can tamper with the' function that makes a machine match the player's score be­cause it is set 10 the factory to randomly match one-tenth of the time.'' Such a match rewards the player with a free game. 
Bally's latest effort at pinball design is a good example of what the industry's future ef­forts will be like. "Paragon" is a pinball machine which i~ roughly twice the size of the usual machine and is replete with various buzzes, rings and clicks, as well as four flippers for the player to control. Bally has perfected the technology of separating a player from his money by incorporating the capacity to give 5 games for Susan B. Anthonr dollars. And, as the last bat trickles out some side hole, the machine salutes the player with an anthem of trickling tones, per-

"Space Invaders," which is produced by a Bally company subsidiary, Midway, "is more than any other game, and an example of how poJ?ular a game can become," satd Nei­man. 
At any time that a game room is open you can see the ''Inva­ders" addicts playing the game which they have made their own. They sit in front of a video screen, attackin~ row upon row of advancing altens, which are mindlessly attempting to des­troy the player's bases. They watt for large ships which streak across the top of the screen, for if they can hit them, the bonus points are consider­able. The end is inevitable, for the best a player can do is stay alive; he can never actually win a free game. But players endlessly feed the machine quarters, and the aliens march towards oblivion in the hope that one of their number will either shoot the players last base or land upon him, thereby ending the game. 
The fascination can be some­thing of a mystery to those unimtiated in the game. Ad­dicts can be seen at all hours playing, waiting to play, or just watching. When they are involved in the game, they become virtual automatons, conscious only of the throbbing heartbeat-like sound of the aliens as they appro.ach .

Statistices indicate that South Korea has taken long fiscal strides over the last two dec­ades. The country now exports everything from televisions to its rice crop. South Korea is also not experiencing the infla­tionary spiral the United States is now undergoing. 
However, the political situa­tion still remains unclear. The interim governmental officals appointed last week were close­ly aligned with Park and his policies. Thus, though a more liberal government may be desired, it may not be imple­mented. According to Brinkley ''The situation,is not a clear-cu~ one yet. To predict that the domestic policy will become more lenient 1s not possible right now.'' 
On behalf of the armed forces, Johnson claimed the military does not want to precipitate any incidents. "We hope we never have to lock and load,'' Johnson said. ''Military mefi are the most peaceful men in the world; we have to get shot first.''. 
Attempting to project an image of political stability, the South Korean /overnment quickly appointe an acting president. All sources con­tacted agreed that the interim government appears to have South Korea under control and if the government can thwart internal chaos, then the chances of a confrontation be­ing sparked with North Korea appear bleak.

The Gary Burton/Chick Coraa Six Year Reunion 
November 6 Morris Civic Auditorium 
In November, 1972, vibraharpist Gary Burton and pianist Chick Corea recorded Crystal Silence, an album Billboard accurately predicted "would prove a classic for its revelation of the more delicate, contemplative strengths of these men." 
Since the recording, Chick and Gary have occasionally taken off time from their busy careers to play duet concerts, and almost six years to the day after recording Crystal Silence, have finally made their "follow-up": 
Duet.

Community Service and Theology 


Features 
ND/SMC Today -France TontorroUJ 
Beth Healy 

For approximately seventy-five students, the year's language class serves a much greater purpose than fulfilling requirements. Daily at 3:25 p.m., the Notre Dame/St. Mary's students begin French class. The class, French for the Angers Program, teaches the students about living in France. Each of the French students presently contemplates living in Angers France next year. The prospect of living and studying in France represents a major decision and an ongoing debate for the students. The debate encompasses many different aspects and at times boggles the mind. As in all debates, the Angers decision reveals two major angles--to live in France next year or remain in the U.S. Although the aspects may appear relatively straig_htforward, little details continuously add complexity to the debate. By examining present preparations, the opportunities offered next year, and future prospects, the students attempt to solve the puzzle. _ 
Undoubtedly for most of the students, primarily freshmen and a few sophomores, the daily French class is more interesting and challenging than all previous high school classes. The class level challenges the students to grasp concepts and ideas instead of blindly struggling through grammar and vocabulary. The increased proficiency in speaking, reading, writing and listening to the French language adds tremendously to class enjoyment. For many, extensive discussions 10 French are a new challenge. The idea of speaking primarily in French next year excites, and sometimes frightens, the students. Each Wednesday the whole program meets to explore the land and people that the students will encounter. Talk of chateaux, picturesque villages, French families, travel, cuisine and adventure stretches the students' imagination beyond belief. Constant referral to places the students will see, things to do, people to meet fog the mind like sleepy dreams, and yet, as they fevenshly take notes the students cannot help but think the notes will come in handy during the year. Excitement peaks as one tries to imagine oneself strolling through the corridors of a Renaissance chateau, or shopping in Paris, or see10g the countryside from a Moped seat. This year's French class gears the student towards anticipation and discovery of next year's home. While the class requires time and effort, the lessons will prove most valuable for the prospective voyager. 
A more divided picture appears when the student examines the present lifestyle and tries to imagine next year's opportunities. Many students question the idea of being away from families and friends for a whole year. No long distance telephone calls or vacation jaunts home appear strange for many students. Beyond family relationships, many students find college provtdes life-long friends and special relationships. The idea of abandoning one's roommate, the girl down the hall, the football weekends, the parties and people one has grown to love seems extremely difficult. Undoubtedly, the student wonders if leaving the security of rresent lifestyles for a year abroad will be worthwhile. And yet, the thought o meeting new people, making new friends, traveling, studying and living in Angers France thrills the students. One is not likely to have another opportumty to be a foreign student, an experience of a lifetime. Thus the scale tips 10 favor of each lifestyle, each prospective opportunity. 
The student must also consider the future. Whether living in Angers coincides with career and lifestyle plans. Whether the year abroad will be advantageous for job opportumties and career aspirations. However, the opposite viewpoint reminds the student that life must be experienced and that the added insights which will accompany the adventure can only enhance one's future. Ltfe builds on experience and the year in Angers France will be a lifelong treasure. 
Although next year seems eons away, the pros_pective Angers student must make a decision, must resolve the debate. The details of liv10g in France and the dreams of the future can confuse and bewilder the student. The best 
decision will be made only after careful consideration of the year'spreparati9n, ne~t year's opportunities aqd future plans. For the present,theClebate wtll conunue and ilie students wlll apply ume and effort to learning.

Mr. Kern thought it was another intern entering his hospital room. 
Mr. Kern: You're a new one. I don't believe I've seen you among the doctors. 
Michael: You haven't, I'm sure; though I have been meaning to call on you sooner. I should have been here sooner than this. I am one ofthe chaplains, Chaplain Smith. 
This quote from Henri Nowen's "Competence and Contemplation" deals with the interrelationship of pastoral and medical care; Michael's role as chaplain in the hospital is important to Mr. Kern's overall health. 
The importance of pastoral care is a concern of Fr. Jim Duane. Duane divides his time between duties as chaplain at St. Joseph hospital and work at Notre Dame in Student Affairs. His credentials include one year of study at Worcester State

He wondered where the clergy was; he felt he needed spiritual, emotional, and physical attention.

''In 1924 Boisen became the first chaplain at a psychiatric hospital in the United States. In 1925 Boisen revolutionized the training of Presby­terian seminarians emphasizing the importance of the pastoral ministry in the hospital."

The Irony and the Terror 
Time magazine probably didn't even get it. "What price power?" asked last week's cover, 10troducing their story on America's weapons-arsenal. I doubt if Time even realized the supreme irony of that cover q_uestion. 
They handled it straight; answered the question about the pnce of power in 
a totally literal fashion. They talked about the price we mu!!t pay for being a 
military super power in terms of dollars--$122 billion this c6ming year. 
But that's not the real price we pay for our continued ~;d~ess. The real price we pay must ~e seen, as Pope John Paul II pointed out, in terms of the tragedy of handing on to our children, for their inheritance, the machinery of death. 
The actual price of this is our sanity. We have lost touch with reality. We can kill everybody in the world 12 times; so we want to iocrease that killing capacity to perhaps 15 or 16 times. The sheer insanity of the position advanced by the Pentagoa, the Congress, the multinationals and the White House is revealed in a single proposition; The more weapons we build, the less secure we are, the more precarious our situation; therefore we will build even more weapons! 
The U.S. alone has put $2 trillion into the military since World War II, in the name of "national security." But that's not the real price we've paid. The actual price is to be seen in the fact that our armament obscenity has meant less money and fewer resources for the things we desperately need. 
In this ''Year of the Child,'' it is a fact that, although ftrst in military strength, the U.S. and the Soviet Union rank lower than many other nations in indicators of social well-being, such as infant and maternal mortality rates. The cost of one Trident submarine equals the cost of a year's schooling for 16 million children in developing countries. 
This is the price we pay. Military and space research togetherJet more public research funds than all social needs combined. The Unite Nations World Food Program has an annual budget which the U.S. Department of Defense alone outspends every 14 hours. 
Even the job market pays some of the price. Bureau of Labor statistics confrrm that thousands more jobs would be created by spending the same money on needed mass transit, better schooling and health care, and development of new energy sources, not military arms. 
That's the price we pay. In this age ofnuclear overkill, we have entered the theater of the absurd. The explosive power of nuclear weapons stockpiled today has been calculated to equal at least 1 million Hiroshima-type bombs. 
This is the price for our current madness. Military spending priorities continue to rob people of dignity, and even of life itself, while contmuing to fuel the frres of inflation and unemployment. Foreign policies based on fear and mistrust continue to foster ever-increasing arms stockpiles. Nuclear arms continue to threaten total destruction. Non-nuclear arms continue to be used to ret>ress social change and to preserve patterns of injustice, while carrying the nsk of escalation from limited war to total nuclear war. 
"What Price power "indeed! Arnold Toynbee, who surveyed the rise and fall of 27civilizations,said on his 75th birthday: "We are now moving into a chapter in human history in which our choice is going to be, not between a whole world and a shredded up world, but between one world and no world.'' 
In the light of all these factors, it is downright ludicrous for Congress to delay ratification of SALT II because of their petty debate. After all, that agreement will not reduce world armaments by a single nuclear weapon. That's like debating the location ofdeck chairs on the Titanic. The survival at 5take will bs secured only when we.take actions that go far beyond the meager proscriptions ofSALY II. 1 .... · 
The nuclear war so many experts now predict as a certainty may not come in my lifetime (I'm getting old); but it could end the lives of this present college-age generation. 
We won't abolish nuclear weapons in my life, either. But we better do it in your lifetime, dear students. For, you see, we won't have any more time after that. · 
Notice: The Institute for World Order will present five awards of $1000 each to students who submit winning essays in support of an abolitionist movement against war. Entry guidelines available at Campus Ministry. · 
up until about ten years ago for Catholics, pastoral theology was taught through lectures and read­in~s. These teachings then led to mmistering to the people. Duane and Boisen disagree wtth the early teach­ings; ~oo m~ny ministers knew. eyery rule listed 10 books about mtrustry but could not put it into practice. 
Duane says maybe the best way to study pastoral theology is to frrst become pastoral, compassionate and caring. During the service experi­ences one must then be open to questions and return to the books and classroom seeking the answers such as those confronted in TCS concern ing aging, dying, suffering, loneli­ness and grief. Duane ·.opes "to provide folks with a context to care" so they can bring this caring back to the course with their questions. 
This technique for studying pas­toral theology is utilized m TCS. Students who have had at least one theology course are invited to pre­register in the Center for Experiential Learning. Sixteen students (usually 8 
----------. -­
men and 8 women) are selected for the course after an interview. Since 1971, 375 students have visited residents of a nursing home once a 
week, then related their visits to readings and weekly seminars con­cerning death, compassion and aging. In this course, students 
explore questions about the relation­
ship of theology and community 
service. They will reflect on their personal experiences with service to the elderly. This reflection will I culminate m a f10al project: a case I study of experiences with one of the ~ elderly and theological reflections. I This case will trace the I student's personal journey from his 1 frrst visit to his last visit in relation­
I ship thelogy and community service. I Duane stresses the importance of -1 
beginning to help under the direction of someone who will guide your reflection on your service work. He says with this reflection "the only way to learn how to help is to start b.elping.''

Lockerbie Square houses Indiana rich 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -Many years ago, Lockerbie Square was the home of Hoosier Poet Laureate ] ames Whitcomb Ri­ley. Then it was one of a number of decaying inner city neighborhoods. 
Having gone full circle, Lock­erbie Square has gained a reputation as a haven for the rich. The residents, who bought their homes at bargain basement prices and refur­bished them to glorious Victori­an mansions, say that label isn't fair. 
People who wanted · to save money as well as the old architecture of the ciry began buying the inner city homes en masse. 
Many of the members of the Lockerbie Square People's Club say they couldn't afford their homes at today's prices. The housing market, along with mortgage rates, has put the once-affordable homes out of reach for most prospective buy­ers. 
Indianapolis' Old Northside, another revitalized neighbor­hood, is in a similar state. 
"No one's going to make a steal on an Old Northside house today," says Marion Redstone, president of the Old Northside Inc. neighborhood association. 
''I'd be priced out of the market if I tried to buy my houses today," says Robert Beauchamp, who founded the neighborhood group. 
"Five years ago, I bought rwo 

houses for $25,000 and today 
those houses would go for 
$100,000 in the same condition I 
bought them," he said. "I've 

seen one landlord up the asking price on a piece of property from $12,500 to $42,900 over the past four years. If these prices existed when the move­ment started, half the people here now wouldn't have bought." 
C£llist to 
perform today 

Cellist Karen Buranskas, an instructor of music at the University of Notre Dame, will present her first faculty recital at 8:15 p.m. today in the Memorial Library auditorium. The recital is open to the public without charge. 
Ms. Buranskas has received many music awards and has won competitions throughout the United States, including the recent 26th Annual Concert Artists Guild Award in New York. Her formal New York debut was presented in Carne­gie Hall in November 1977. After earning her bachelor's degree in music from Indiana Umversity, Ms. Buranskas studied under Aldo Parisot and received a master's in music from Yale University. She has also studied under Gregor Pia­tigorsky at th_e D!liven;iry-of Southern California. 
Joining Ms. Buranskas during the program will be William Cerny, pianist. 
Oass drops Students reschedule classes 
by Kelli Flint StaffReporter 

Last Friday, Nov. 2, was the final day for dropping classes. According to Assistant Regis­trar David Kil, over 8,000 schedule changes were made this semester. "We don't keep track of volume, but overall the number of classes dropped has remained stable over the years," Kil said. "The sche­dule changes include:classes added, dropped, taken pass­fail, or audited, and changes of college.'' 
"A student is not required to give a reason for dropping a class, and the reason is usually not volunteered," Kil said. "Students usually share their reasons for dropping a class with peers or an advisor." 
As stated in the "du Lac" student guide, a class may be dropped at the student's discre­tion through the first sevenclass days without the approval of the dean. After this time, they must report to the department offering the course for an add-drop slip. ''These slips are not available in the Registrar's office," Kil said. "Many students come to our office for add-drop slips, but we are not allowed to distribute them. They can only be obtained through the department offer­ing the course.'' 
~fter the slip is completed, the signature of the department chairmen and the approval of the dean of the student's col­le~e are required. 
' If a section change is all that is desired, the approval of the dean will probably not be required, and the student should go to the department chairman,'' Kil said. 
According to Kil, the course most frequently added at Notre Dame in recent years has been Astronomy. "In 1972, over 900 students signed up for this course," he said. "When it was raised from the 100 to 200 level, its pofulariry declined, bur it is stil a popular selec­tion."

"It's like coming home, " com­mented Rex Rakow newly ap­pointed assistant director of security, when asked how he felt about returning to South Bend after spending three years as director of security at Albion College in Michi£an. 
"Both my wife and I were born and raised in South Bend and we're )ooking forward to our 
return.'' , Rex Rakow, a 1973 graduate of Indiana University at Blooming­ton, will assume responsibili­ties as assistant director on December 3. James A. Roe­mer, Dean of Students said that one of Rakow's resl'onsibilities will be the superv1sion of all campus events between 4 p.m. 
andl2 midnight. Examples of such events are concerts and basketball and hockey games. 
andmanagementof a training program that will enable the 75 members of the security force to better serve the community. 
"This will be done through a 
program designed to upgrade 
the present system,'' said 
Glenn L. Terry, director of ND 
security. 
According to the Mandatory Law Enforcement Training Act, an officer must have 400 hours of basic state training before geing given the power of arrest.. 
Witfiout this-training, an 
officer can not exercise this 
power. 
-"Because only a few ND 
security officers have the power 
to arrest," commented Terry, 
''the institution of a campus 
training frogram will be quite . beneficia . ' ' 
Prior to Rakow's three years at 
Albion, he was a police training 
specialist for the Southern Illi­
no is, and a policeman for the Richmond, Indiana Police De­partment. After earning a bachelor's degree in police . 'administration at Indiana Uni-. 
1 versity, he was a supervisor in

In Greensboro 
Suspects sought in anti-Klan rally ambush 
GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP)­Police searched yesterday for two more cars and more sus-· pects believed involved in the ambush at a "Death to the Klan'' rally that left four people dead and 10 wounded. 
Civil rights organizations, in the meantime, blamed the bloodbath on a resurgence of Ku Klux Klan activity across the South and the failure of law enforcement officials to pros­ecute Klansmen commiting acts of violence. 
Already in jail were a dozen men charged with first degree murder following Saturday's assault on an anti-Klan rally organized by the leftist Workers Viewpoint Organ­ization, which earlier had taunted Klansmen as ''cowards.'' 
While police said some suspects were avowed mem­bers of the Klan, local KKK leaders said they were mem­bers of other right-wing organ­izations. Two Klan sources and a Nazi leader said some of the suspects were Nazis, but that could not be confirmed. 
Harold Covington of Raleigh, state unit commander of the National Socialist Party of America, said one of the jailed men--Roland Wayne Wood of Winston-Salem--was the Forsyth County Unit leader of the Nazis apd he recognized the

When tailback Duane Flowers went out in the frrst half, Navy turned to fourth stringer Eddie Meyers. (Navy's top two tailbacks were injured earlier in the season.) 
After the Irish punted on their frrst second half possession, Meyers helped put Navy in range to score a tying touch­down, carrying five times for 39 yards. The Middies drov~ down to the Notre Dame 12, but a saving tackle by safety Tom Gibbons on a draw play to Meyers stopped Navy short, and a field goal att4~mpt by Dave Guin was wide.

Protesters hide in crown 

New York (AP) Seven demonstrators, protesting the deposed shah of Iran's pre­sence in the United States, chained themselves in the Sta­tue of Liberty's crown for 3 1I 2 hours yesterday before authori­ties cut the chains and took them into custody. 
The seven, who refused to identify themselves to police, were bein~ charged by National Park Serv1ce police on Liberty Island with criminal trespassing and disorder!¥ conduct. 
According to Ellen Britton, acting superintendent of the national park in New York harbor. the demonstrators did 
not resist arrest. Ms. Britton had said about 30 persons were involved in the demonstration, but she said later there were only seven. 
The island was closed to the public throughout the demon­stration, and Britton said the island and statue would remain closed for the rest of the day. Bahram N~.hidian, a spokesman for the Persian 
Speaking Group of the Moselm ·Students Association of the United States and Canada, said the demonstrators were "pro­testing the shah's presence in New York."

Vagas shines again 



Navy defense shines in Irish w-in 

by Mark Perry Sports Editor 
Notre Dame celebrated the 50th anniversary of the dedica-· tion of its football stadium, and the Irish did their part to help the celebration by defeating Navy, 14-0. But after the game the big talk was about the defense of the Midshipmen. 
''Navy has a fine defensive team,'' remarked Notre Dame coach Dan Devine. "Every year they have one of the top-ninked defensive teams in the nation, and this team is surely a good defensive unit. "Navy probably had mor~ qua­lity depth than any team we've played this year, including Southern Cal. They now have been able to recruit players who are just as big and Jl?hysical as the players we recrutt.'' 
"They had a lot of guys hurt, but they were still quick up front," added offensive tackle

Sweep UMD 
leers enjoy trip to Minnesota 
by Brian Beglane Sports Writer 
DULUTH, Minn. -If a poll of the players were taken, the Notre Dame hockey team's favorite road trip would have to be Minnesota-Duluth. 
Not because of the weather ­
the se.ries at U.S. International 
in San Diego in late December 
will be the landslide favorite in 
that respect. But in terms of 
winning, you can't beat Duluth. 
Er, that is, the Irish can. 
Notre Dame broke into the league win column with an 8-4 and 6-4 Western Collegiate Hockey Association sweep of the Bulldogs Friday and Satur­day nights at the Duluth Arena. 
The sweep gave the Irish a 2-2 WCHA record (3-2 overall) and propelled them into a six-way tie for third place. Duluth is sweeping the WCHA cellar with an 0-4 record. 
!he Irish have won their last six games in Duluth and the last time they lost here was way back on Jan. 24, 1976. Notre Dame's career record versus the Bulldogs in Duluth is 9-4-1, and that includes three losses and a tie from the first four meetings. "Yeah, I guess we're really getting to like playing in Duluth," smiled Irish coach Lefty Smith. "We played much better this week than we did in the opener against Denver. We moved the puck much better and got improved forechecking from our forwards. Practically every aspect of our play was impro­ved. 
"We're naturally pleased with two wins, yet we also feel we did not play to our full potenti­al. That is a result of all the injuries we had and the penal­ties we received. But\ I'm very proud of the way we handled all the adversity.'' 
Notre Dame spent so much time in the penalty box both nights the guy opemng the door could have retired if he charge~ admission. The Irish were called for a grand total of 61 penalty minutes for the weekend (16 for 35 Friday, 13 for 26 Saturday) while the Bulldogs received 3 5 minutes for both nights. Duluth wound up scoring three power elay goals in 21 attempts while Notre Dame had three goals with the advantage in nine opportuni­ties. 
"Dave Laurion's goaltending kept us honest in the early gomg Friday," said Smith. "Alter ·the ·first. peJ;iod~ur-· defensemen started to improve. 
Kevin Humphreys and Bill Rothstein paced the Irish Fri­day with two goals each. Dave Pauling, Tom Michalek andJeff Perry all contributed a goal and two assists. But the strong goal tending .of Laurion allowed Notre Dame to build a 6-1 lead into the third period. The sophomore netmmder made 17 saves in the first period and surrendered only one goal. 
With 13:54 remaining--in the game, however, Launon was hurt :-r~aking a save and was forced to miss the rest of the game. Bob McNamara repla­
ced him and one minute later 
the Irish defensemen allowed 
the floodgates to open. 
Gregg Moore followed up 
Mitch Corbin's power play ~oal 
at 7: 15 with two of his own JUSt 
seven seconds apart to close the 
gap to 6-4 with 10:53 to play. 
McNamara held strong, how­
ever, and totaled eight saves, 
two of them from point blank range in the final minutes. ·Rothstein's second score at 
10:48 doused the fire created by the three Bulldo~ goals. 
Saturday night tt was a wonder Notre Dame had the time to score six goals -the Irish appeared to have leased the penalty box as an extra bench seat. To add to the Irish woes, defenseman ] ohn Friedmann had to sir out after a fight Friday night and left wing Kirt Bjork rode the bench with a knee injury. Forwards Jeff Logan and Dan Collad missed the trip to begin with, and defenseman Don Lucia suffered a hip pointer (contusion) Satur­day and, along with Logan, Collard and Fjork,are question­able for this week's home series

pensate. '' 
Vagas Ferguson, continuing his assault on the Notre Dame record books, was the key factor in the game, as he gained 155 yards on 34 carries and scored the final Irish touchdown. The senior tailback now has 1,061 yards rushing on the season, becoming the first Notre Dame runner to rush for 1 ,000 yards in two seasons. He also became the Irish career leader with his 11th 100-yard game. 
''They were tough yards, every one of them," Ferguson admitted. "Navy's defense was big, tough and quick. I've got to give credit to the offen­sive line, for opening the holes against such a tough defense." 
Ferguson went into the game with a sore shoulder, but the close score left Devine with little opportunity to rest his running star. 
"I don't know if it's good for Vagas to rest," Devine com­mented. ''Most !-formation tailbacks seem to play better late in the game. I'm proud of Vag as, and if I had rested him it would have been a mistake.!' 
''Winning always feels good, but I'II be sore tomorrow," confessed Ferguson. "The shoulder wasn't a big factor. Whatever it takes to win the game I want to do it. I can't sit on the bench and just say I'm hurt. You just gotta say to yourself:' It hurts,' and then go out there and do your job.'' 
It seemed like the Irish would have ample opportunity to rest Ferguson after their early play, as they marched to a touchdown on their very first possession. Quarterback Rusty Lisch cap­ped the 73-yard drive by plun­ging over from a yard out. 
And when Bob Crable blocked an attempted punt by Navy's Lex Lauletta, it seemed like the Irish might be heading for a rout. But Navy's defense took over, and held the Irish score­less until the fourth quarter. 
In the meantime, the Middies found spark for their offense .

ND cagers play charity game 
Notre Dame basketball fans will get their first opportunity to see the 1979-80 Irish in the annual charity game slated for Sunday, November 11, at 7 
p.m. in the Athletic and Convo­cation Center. Tickets are priced at $1 for adults and 50 cents for Notre Dame and St. mary's students with an ID. Proceeds will benefit the Neigh­borhood Study Help Program and the Special Olympics. 
Fighting Irish coach Digger Phelps has announced the line­ups for the game. The tentative starting five, wearing green, will feature a front line of juniors Kelly Tripucka and Tracy Jackson at forwards and Orlando Woolridge at the cen­ter spot. Senior co-captains Rich Branning and Bill Hanzlik will comprise the backcourt for the green team. 
Phelps figures to go with freshman Tim Andree at center with classmate Bill Varner at one forward post and junior Gilbert Salinas at the other frontline position for the blue squad. Junior Stan Wilcox and freshman John Paxson are pen­ciled in at the guard slots. 
''This game should give us a chance to see all of our players in game situations,'' says Phelps. "We'll try a lot of the things we want to do during the year. We want to see how the freshmen are coming along and how the upperclassmen are reaching to the new plays and defenses we've been teaching them. In all, it should be a very exciting evening for 'Notre Dame basketball fans and espe­cially the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's student body." Players will be available bef~re and after the game to stgn autographs and chat with fans.
