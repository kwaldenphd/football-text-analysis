Education initiative kicks off 
By KATIE MURPHY 
Associate News Editor 
This weekend forty Notre Dame and Saint Mary's seniors joined with superintendents from eight Catholic dioceses to launch the Alliance for Catholic Education (ACE), an unprece­dented initiative in Catholic parochial education. 
In response to the ever-in­creasing need for enthusiastic Catholic educators, ACE will train and place college gradu­ates in primary and secondary schools. 
"We are beginning this effort to form professional edu­cators ... This weekend's work­shop/retreat (was) the begin­ning of our program," said Father Timothy Scully, associ­ate professor of government and international studies. 
ACE is the brainchild of Scully, who developed the pro­gram in conjunction with the National Catholic Bishops Conference's Department of Education and the National Catholic Education Association. 
"Every time I'm with parents of school-age children or with members of religious communi­ties involved in Catholic educa­tion, the pressing need for com­mitted Catholic educators comes up in the conversation," said Scully. 


Smooth sailing 

Residents of Morrissey Hall struggle to keep their boat afloat on Saint Mary's Lake during the Fisher Regatta. 
"At the same time, we have this vast pool of untapped teaching resources among our undergraduate population, many of whom are longing to serve the Church in some sig­nificant and generous way. With ACE we intend both to provide committed Catholic teachers for beleaguered parochial schools, and to pro­vide recent college graduates opportunities for Christian community , personal growth, and possibly, a lifelong voca­tion." 
In this first year of the pro­gram, about 250 applications were distributed. Forty stu­dents were then selected to participate. In addition to teaching in the schools, ACE teachers or "interns" will earn a modest salary, live in a com­munal environment with other educators, and have the oppor­tunity to receive their Master's in Arts in Teaching (MAT). 
Administrators from dioceses in St. Augustine, Fla., Atlanta, Ga., Mobile, Ala., Oklahoma City, Okla., and Baton Rouge, Lake Charles, Alexandria, and Shreveport, La. attended this weekend's workshop and retreat to meet their new teachers for the first time. Representatives from the University of Portland's gradu­ate school of education con­ducted a workshop on Sat­urday, which was followed on Sunday by a mass and retreat. 
"We did a lot of breaking down into our individual cities," said Kelly Hartman, a Saint Mary's senior who will be teaching high school in Ok­

GSU president pleased with leadership debate 
By JASON WILLIAMS 
Associate News Editor 
Recent debate over the Graduate Student Union's (GSU) leadership role is not worrying GSU President Ed Wingenbach. In fact, Wigen­bach said he is somewhat pleased with the discussion which has been taking place. 
"One of our (GSU council) goals is to increase communi­cation with the GSU council and graduate students," he said. "Now that people know what's going on, we're getting better representation than in the past and more issues are being debated." 
For the last three weeks, GSU's leadership role has been debated in letters to the editor printed in The Observer. It started when a March 23 letter signed by 26 engineering grad­uate students criticized the GSU for not accurately repre­senting the graduate student l;lody. 
Other letters, both pro and con, followed, including a re­sponse from Wingenbach. 
But Wingenbach feels that now more than ever the GSU council is aptly representing graduate students. 
"Nineteen of 24 departments are represented on the GSU 
council," he said. "Given the respected positions, it's most likely they represent a majority of graduate students." 
Wingenbach said he believes the recent debate is a result of a detailed monthly newsletter which the last GSU administra­tion initiated. The letter has delivered GSU council actions and beliefs right into the hands of its students. 
But Wingenbach said con­fusion still exists about GSU's leadership because of two mis­conceptions, the belief that GSU decisions are made solely by the council president and that GSU is a social organization. 
"Positions the president and vice-president take are their positions," he said. "GSU only takes positions adopted by the council." 
GSU was founded in 1969, but it has only recently re­ceived a student activities bud­get so they can have social functions, Wingenbach said. 
But Wingenbach said he is not dismissing the debate drummed up by the recent let­ters. 
"It's clear that these issues are of concern to a lot of grad­uate students and I can't ignore that." 



Williams, Borer to monitor S. Africa elections 
By JOHN LUCAS 
Managing Editor 
Associate Provost Reverend Oliver Williams, CSC and grad­uate student Tristan Borer will leave today for Johannesburg to serve as United Nations moni­tors for the groundbreaking South African elections to be held on April27-28. 
• see BUTHELEZI, page 4 
Williams and Borer were se­lected as part of the 50 person State Department delegation to the United Nations Observer Mission. The UN routinely sends observers and monitors to elections around the world to maintain order and discourage fraud or violence. 
"Our major role is that of a deterrent to people trying to interrupt or disrupt the elec­tions," Williams said. "It will be exhilarating to be a part of this first step." 
The elections mark the first time blacks have been granted the right to vote in the same way as whites. According to recent reports, African National Congress leader Nelson Man­deJa is expected to win the elec­tion in a landslide. 
The election process is being slowed to a certain extent by difficulties in arranging the lo­gistics of a major election. Al­though 22 million South Africans are expected to vote in the election, only 5,000 of the nations 8,000 polling places have been selected. 

"This is such a watershed election," Borer said. "Not only do they have to explain the con­cept of democracy, but they have to deal with the actual nuts and bolts of how to vote." 
Currently, Zulu Chief Mango­suthu Buthelezi has stated his intention to boycott the elec­tion, and there is a possibility he may try to stop voting in the Natal province. Since Natal is home to seven million Zulus, there is a chance of violence, but it is likely that it will be low-level Williams said. 
"The two million Zulus living in rural areas have the poten­tial to raise havoc, but not start a civil war," he said. 
There is also the chance that ultra-conservative whites could use violence to try and disrupt the election. Currently, both groups are lacking the power to do serious damage, Borer said. "Right now, there really isn't much of a threat that there will be much of a disruption." 
In any case, Williams and Borer are prepared for the pos­sibility that they will be sent to areas of disruptions. Both will be outfitted in blue UN hats and jackets. If Williams is sent to a bad area, he plans on wearing a kevlar bulletproof vest as well as his priest's collar. 

Both stressed that they have no fear for their personal safe­ty, although Borer had some trouble convincing her parents that the trip was a good idea. 
There have been isolated cases of violence in the past few weeks before the election, but Borer explained that the West­ern media is largely responsible for the image that South Africa is in chaos. 
"All the media wants to show is violence," she said. "When you see it over and over, you get the idea that violence is all that is happening there. In re­ality, the situation is under con­trol." 
Both agreed the elections are the best chance the country has to peacefully draft a new constitution. 
"With this election, South Africa will have eliminated the last vestige of statutory apartheid," Williams said. "Now, the question is: Can blacks and whites work to­gether?" 
If Mandela wins over two­thirds of the ballots cast in the election, he will be able to draft a new constitution without the input of the white minority, in­cluding current President F. W. DeKlerk. 
Although it is possible that Mandela will receive nearly 60 percent of the vote, it is unlikely he will have enough votes to bypass whites entirely, Borer said. 
Willimas and Borer will be among thousands of Americans traveling to South Africa to ob­serve the elections. Delegations from human rights organiza­tions, and both the Democratic and Republican parties will also be represented. 
After attending Nelson Man­deJa's address to the UN in New York, Williams was approached by State Department officials who asked him if he was inter­ested in becoming a monitor for the elections. The State De­partment group of 50 is part of the larger UN group of 1250 members. 
In addition, Williams has written a book on South Africa and coordinated a conference in 1991 on the direction of corporate investment in South Africa. Coincidentally, Borer, who is writing her doctoral the­sis on South African politics, applied for the mission and was also accepted. 
When Williams and Borer ar­rive in Johannesburg, they will undergo a two day period of training where they will learn their duties as observers. After training, monitors will be dis­persed to different parts of the country where they will report on whether the election can be considered free and fair. 
As part of their duties as monitors, both will receive diplomatic immunity and are instructed not to report to any­one other than United Nations officials. 
After the election, the UN mission group will reconvene in Johannesburg to draft a report on the election process for the UN Security Council.

INSIDE COLUMN WORLD AT AGLANCE 
The ND spirit does exist after all 
If you were ever a doubter of the Notre Suzy Fry Dame spirit, Christmas Viewpoint Editor 
in April would certainly dispel your skepticism. 
To most college students, particularly this one, crawling out of bed at 7:14 on a Saturday morning does not sound like an ideal way to start off a weekend. But after a few dining hall donuts and some concentrated orange juice I felt I could tackle anything. I soon dis­covered that I had no idea what the word "any­thing" meant. 
Christmas in April is a community wide ser­vice project where South Bend residents and Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students work side by side to clean up and repair 44 homes in the South Bend area. 
After reading countless stories of friction between students and local residents it was refreshing to see such outreach. Did anyone ever think that those St. Paddy's Day partiers at Lafayette would be working with officers from the South Bend Police Department? It's amazing to realize how conflict, no matter how trivial or enormous, can be overcome by good­will and benevolence. 
Anyhow, upon arriving at our particular 
home the foreman asked if there were any vol­
unteers for "some real dirty work" outside. I, 
being th~ consummate Californian, declined 
and opted for repainting the warm kitchen. 
Apparently, the dirty work he was referring to 
was cleaning up the remnants of a backed-up 
sewer. Ready for anything? Yeah right. 
Fortunately, my cold-blooded nature prevailed. 
In my particular group of volunteers there 
were 13 Notre Dame students and lllocal res­
idents, including a lawyer, some police officers, 
a few homemakers and construction workers. 
After seven hours of scouring, painting, build­
ing, trimming, digging and scrapping, we had 
rebuilt a stairwell and a hallway, replaced a 
half dozen windows, repainted four rooms and 
a front porch, landscaped both the front and 
backyards -not to mention the sewage inci­
dent -and befriended the two-year old across 
the street. Yet also during these seven hours 
24 very different people became friends and 
two communities became one. 
When approaching a project such as this, 
one must keep in mind that most volunteers 
aren't going to have much experience while a 
select few while will always be experts. For 
instance, to the average lay person, the most 
efficient way to paint the floor of a porch 
would be to pour a half gallon of paint and 
then smear it around with a couple of brushes. 
Right? Apparently not. 
Though I still have no clue what the proper 
way to paint a porch is, I do know that my 
knees hurt and I'm having a heck of a time 
recovering from the fumes. 
The improvements made to the 44 homes do 
not compare to the philanthropic, peaceful 
attitude that permeated not just the lives of the 
volunteers but the community itself. In a 
world where it is just so easy to say "screw 
you" to the next guy after having been hurt, its 
nice to see to such positive, challenging events 
such as Christmas in April. 
And that myth about the Notre Dame spirit is 
true. It does exists and it goes far beyond the 
confines of this campus.

New health plans offered 
NEW YORK 
With the backing of the White House, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell has offered Senate Democrats three cheaper versions of President Clinton's health plan, The New York Times reported. 
Each of the alternatives, like Clinton's plan, seeks to guarantee all Americans health insurance that can never be canceled and to require employers to pay some of the cost of their workers' insurance, the Times reported in Monday's editions. 
But the alternatives all would cost less than the administration's proposal. They variously accomplish that by reducing what employers would pay, decreasing what the government would pay, limiting benefits or increasing what individuals would pay. 
Mitchell offered the proposals in an effort to get Congress moving on health care, the newspaper said. They were discussed at a meeting of Senate Democrats on Saturday night, where Mitchell made it clear he was taking charge of the health-care issue, several senators at the meeting reported. 
Forty-five of the 56 Democratic senators attended the meeting, held at a retreat near Williamsburg, Va. 
Clinton also attended Saturday's meeting and urged the lawmakers to move forward on the proposals, saying a strong position on health care would help the Democrats in the November elections, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois said afterward. 
Mitchell turned down Clinton's offer of a nomination to the Supreme Court last week, saying he wanted to stay in Congress through the year to lead the effort to get health­care legislation passed. The Maine Democrat's Senate term ends at the end of this year and he is not seeking re-election. 
Pope denounces U.N. conference 
VATICAN CITY 
Pope John Paul II criticized a planried United Nations conference on popula­tion growth on Sunday as an attempt to promote birth control and abortion. The pontiff said he has sent all world lead­ers a letter "expressing painful sur­prise" that religious points of view apparently will be excluded from the meeting, planned for September in 

Cairo, Egypt. About 170 nations are expected to atten. The pope said the gathering, which will be led by econo­mists, sociologists and political leaders, will reinforce the "presumed right of abortion." The pope's voice rose with emotion as he denounced the meeting, which he called "a defeat for man. It is today more urgent than ever to react against models of behavior that are models for hedonism and permissiveness." 
Bush never wanted to dump Quayle 
FORT WAYNE, Ind. 
Former President George Bush fully supported Dan Quayle as his vice president and never considered remov­ing him from the 1992 Republican presidential ticket, ad­visers close to the campaign said. "For four years, every time I was with George Bush and Dan Quayle's name came up, he was totally supportive and defended him," said Charles Black, a Bush-Quayle consultant on the 1992 campaign. "He would specifically say, 'Nobody better come in here and try and tell me that I shouldn't have him on the ticket.' " Black and other Bush-Quayle advis­ers met at Harvard University's Institute of Politics in De­cember 1992 to review the campaign. Principal players in presidential elections have been gathering at Harvard to hold post-mortems on the campaign since 1972. The conversation is off the record at the time, but a transcript is published 18 months later. The transcript of the De­cember 1992 meeting was released last week.

Students overestimate cost of college 
GARY, Ind. 

More than half of Indiana high school seniors overesti­mate the cost of college, and that could cause them to lower their expectations for higher education, according to a survey. More than 5,000 students, teachers and par­ents were surveyed for the $1.6 million "High Hopes, Long Odds" study. The study, commissioned by the Lilly Endowment Inc., is being released in segments over a 10­month period. The latest part of the study shows that 58 percent of parents and students surveyed thought tuition at the main campuses of Indiana University and Purdue University was more than $5,000 a year. The actual cost is $2,520 at Purdue and $2,821 at Indiana. Research data shows that students who overestimate the costs of college are less likely to enroll as full-time students than their counterparts who have more accurate information. Indiana ranks 45th in the percentage of population age 25 and older with four or more years of college. 
Mother grieves for son killed in crash 
MILTON-FREEWATER, Ore. Marcia Hall doesn't blame anyone for the death of her son, whose helicopter was accidentally shot down by a 
U.S. warplane over northern Iraq. All she wants to know is why. "All I know is that I will never see him again," Hall said. "I feel for the other parents. They are going through the same thing I am now." Army Warrant Offi­cer Michael Allen Hall, 28, was among 26 people killed Friday when two U.S. warplanes inadvertently downed two Blackhawk Helicopters in a no-fly zone. The victims included 15 Americans. Meanwhile, military officials confirmed the identities Sunday night of two more vic­tims. Staff Sgts. Ricky Lee Robinson and Paul Neil Bar­clay were members of the lOth Special Forces (Airborne) 2nd Battalion stationed at Fort Devens in Ayer, Mass., said Walt Sokalski, a spokesman for the Special Opera­tions Command. A woman who answered the phone at the Barclays' home said the family had no comment.

Serbian tanks enter Gorazde; residents panic 
By SAMIR KRILIC 
Associated Press 
SARAJEVO 
Serb tanks ground into Gorazde on Sunday, shortly after U.N. officials announced an agreement had been reached to end the siege of the long-suffering Muslim enclave. 
In a sense, much of Gorazde had already fallen to the Serbs though there were pockets of resistance around town Sunday, particularly at the hospital, which remained in government hands but under intense sniper fire. Serbian forces appeared free to move elsewhere about town. 
"The Bosnian Serbs possess the capability to proceed at will into Gorazde," the special adviser to the U.N. Secretary­General, Chinmaya Gharekhan of India, said Sunday night in New York. 
The Security Council in a non­binding statement read late Sunday by the president, Colin Keating of New Zealand, said the 15-member body condemns "the escalating military activi­ties by the Serb forces against Gorazde." It made no threat of force to enforce its condemna­tion. 
Said Keating of the situation in Gorazde: "It has not fallen in the literal sense. It is threat­ened but resistance continues." 
Tens of thousands of Gorazde residents, who have been under fire for most of the two-year war, cowered Sunday in build­ings or huddled fearfully in a drenching rain as the Serbs' tanks lumbered down the streets. 
A senior government official in Gorazde told Sarajevo radio that 21 people had been killed and at least 55 wounded by Serb attacks that intensified in the afternoon and evening..The casualty report could not be independently confirmed. 
The official told the· radio that 10-12 tanks were moving toward town from the direction of Ustipraca to the east. 

Taking de facto control of Gorazde, 35 miles southeast of Sarajevo, is a substantial victo­ry for the Bosnian Serbs because it improves road links between land they captured from Bosnian government forces to the east and south. 
It also is another blow to efforts to end the war by the world community, often criti­cized as weak and unfocused. 
Despite Gorazde's designation as a protected zone for Muslims last year by the United Nations, the Serbs continued their siege and were undeterred by NATO air missions in the past two weeks. 
"I think that the means at our disposal are not sufficient to cope with the situation," admit­ted Yasushi Akashi, the chief 
U.N. representative for Yugoslavia. "I am afraid ... the situation does not look good." 
David Hannay, the British ambassador to the United Nations, said Sunday night that the council "does not have a magic wand" to protect the six U.N.-declared "safe areas," which include Gorazde. 
Vitaly Churkin, the Russian envoy who participated in nego­tiations Sunday in Pale, the Bosnian Serb headquarters out­side Sarajevo, was similarly downcast. 
"Optimistic is not the word I would use," he said about chances of a long-term cease­fire for Gorazde. 
Others closer to the battle­front agreed. "Before the eyes of the entire world, a city is dying," declared 
Gorazde ham radio operator Enes Musovic, monitored by Bosnian radio. 
Sylvana Foa, spokeswoman for the Geneva-based U.N. High Commissoner for Refugees, told of the. despair at the building housing U.N. staff in Gorazde. 
"Shells and sniper fire are shaking the building and it's suicidal to step outside," she said. "We're now up to about 30,000 panicking people who have moved into the center of town. Our building is full of people fleeing." 
Doctors Without Borders, an international medical relief organization, cited its staff as saying Gorazde's hospital was being hit, leaving staff wounded and patients killed. 
Manuel de Almeida y Silva of UNHCR in Zagreb, Croatia, said all available buildings teeming

with terrified residents, with many people reduced to stand­ing in the streets amid heavy rain. 
Earlier Sunday, U.N. peace­keepers spokesman Maj. Dacre Holloway said an agreement had been reached at U.N.-Serb talks for the Serbs to end their advance and to withdraw heavy weapons from a 1.8-mile radius around the city. 
An official of the Bosnian army high command said the talks had been nothing but a "trick" allowing the Serbs to continue their move toward the city. 
Under the reported agree­ment, the Serbs were to end their siege, pull back their weapons, and allow a U.N. peacekeeping force of about 350 soldiers to enter the city of 65,000 civilians.

American teenager may escape flogging 
By KENNETH WHITING 
Associated Press 
SINGAPORE 
If his final appeal against being flogged is rejected, an 18­year-old American has a slim chance to escape a beating on medical grounds. 
"The punishment of caning shall not be inflicted unless a medical officer is present and certifies that the offender is in a fit state of health to undergo such punishment," according to Singapore's Criminal Procedure Code. 
That doesn't happen often, however. 
An average of 1,000 people are sentenced to flogging, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Home Affairs. 
About six avoid the lash each year on medical grounds each year, and the caning is either remitted or commuted to a jail term. 
Theodore Simon, a lawyer in Philadelphia who specializes in helping Americans who get in trouble in other countries, said that Michael Fay, who was sen­tenced to six lashes for van­dalism, has attention deficit dis­order, which often contributes to disruptive behavior. 
Simon contends that Fay is unfit to handle the punishment, which breaks the skin and leaves permanent scars. Be­cause of Fay's condition, he could suffer extreme psycholog­ical consequences, Simon said. 
Defense attorney R. Palakr­ishnan submitted two psychi­atric reports at the youth's trial in March showing that he suf­fers from the condition. 
Lawyers have until Wednes­day to file an appeal for clemency with President Ong Teng Cheong. A fast decision is expected. 
Caning usually is carried out in the early days of a prison sentence and has been delayed in Fay's case pending the out­come of the clemency plea. 
President Clinton asked Ong in a personal letter to recon­sider the lash, and 24 U.S. sen­ators told Ong clemency would be "an enlightened decision." 
The London-based human rights organization Amnesty International condemns caning as a cruel, inhuman and de­grading form of punishment, prohibited by the United Na­tions Declaration on Human Rights, the Torture Convention and the International Conven­tion on Civil and Political Rights. 
Prisoners are strapped tightly to an easel-like wooden frame, body bent forward at the waist. The lower spine and internal organs are protected by padding from the blows, ad­ministered by prison guards trained in martial arts.

The retreat focused on prayer, community life, and teaching as a vocation 
. "Everybody got to know each other," said Hartman. 
Hartman, who majored in English and Philosophy and minored in Spanish, will most likely be teaching religion and English and will be the coor­dinator of her school's sopho­more service program. She may also work with their Spanish students. 
The new teachers will be pre­pared for their positions at Notre Dame in a six week sum­mer training course conducted by representatives of the University of Portland, mem­bers of the Notre Dame faculty, and four recent Notre Dame graduates now involved in teaching careers. If the interns' contracts are renewed, a sec­ond summer training session will provide some teachers with the basic requirements for the MAT. .

Six athletes receive award 
Special to The Observer 
Six University of Notre Dame student-athletes have been se­lected as recipients of the 1994 Byron V. Kanaley Awards for academic excellence and lead­ership among senior monogram winners. 
Established in 1925, the awards are named in honor of a 1904 Notre Dame graduate who was a member of the base­ball team as an undergraduate. Kanaley went on to a successful banking career in Chicago and served the University in the Alumni Association and as a lay trustee from 1915 until his death in 1960. 
This year's recipients of the Kanaley Awards are: 
Maura Gallagher, Yonkers, N.Y.-Gallagher, majoring in German, has compiled a 3.58 grade point average (GPA) and achieved dean's list for five semesters. As the top epeeist for the Notre Dame women's fencing team, she helped lead the Fighting Irish to the 1994 national championship.

Former Foreign Minister Mi­chio Watanabe said Sunday he would leave Japan's former ruling party to seek support within the current government coalition in-a bid to become prime minister. 
The move by Watanabe, leader of the third-largest fac­tion within the Liberal Democratic Party, could com­plicate the coalition's efforts to unite behind a candidate and prolong Japan's political paral­ysis. 
The seven-party coalition had come close to splitting over policies, personalities and pro­cedures after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's surprise announcement April 8 that he was stepping down over ques­tions about his personal fi­nances. 
But after weekend meetings, the coalition was reported close to working out its disputes and formally choosing Tsutomu Hata, the current foreign minis­ter, as its candidate -which would make him the likely win­ner when Parliament chooses the next prime minister. 
It was to meet again Monday. 
Some groups within the fac­tion were known to lean toward Watanabe, 70, because of his experience in government. Most recently, he had served as foreign minister from October 1991 until ill health forced him to step down in April 1993. A few months later, the scandal­plagued Liberal Democrats lost their 38-year majority in Parliament's more powerful lower house in national elec­tions. A coalition led by Hosokawa took over in August. 
Watanabe had strongly hint­ed previously at his availability to serve as prime minister, apparently hoping for strong support within his own party, now the major opposition force. 
But on Sunday he said: "Since I need support from many people (to become prime minister). it is naturally that I will leave the LOP."

Like many high school seniors across the country, 18­year-old Tereasa Davenport began thinking weeks ago about what she'II wear to her prom, who'll be her date, which friends she'll ride with. 
As her April 23 prom nears, though, deeper questions occur to her. 
One is whether life in her small hometown will ever be the same after a civil rights standoff straight out of the 1960s was triggered by Principal Hulond Humphries' threat to cancel the prom if interracial couples planned to attend. 
"I think it's already had a big effect," Davenport said. "A lot of white people and black peo­ple aren't associating with each other. I think things are going to be different now." 
She frowned, pondering the future while waiting for her ride from the Grace Missionary Baptist Church, one of two churches that have become "freedom schools" for students boycotting Randolph County High School. 
The boycott began after the school board reinstated Humphries March 31, two weeks after he was suspended for warning at a Feb. 24 stu­dent assembly that the prom might be canceled. 
Humphries, who is white and has been principal for 25 years, also allegedly told the student who headed the prom commit­tee that her white father and black mother made "a mis­take" in marrying and having a rural eastern Alabama county of Randolph, which has 20,000 people. Named for a Creek Indian chief and nestled in pine-dotted hills along Lake Wedowee, the town has two traffic lights. 
Sleepy no more, the uproar has brought motorcades, rallies with fiery speeches and singing of "We Shall Overcome," in addition to the ongoing school boycott and a "selective buy­ing" campaign aimed at some white-owned businesses. 
The Southern Poverty Law Center filed a federal lawsuit seeking damages for the mixed­race student, ReVonda Bowen. 
"Wedowee's a wonderful town. It's not good for Wedowee, it's not good for Randolph County, and it's not good for Alabama," said Donald McKay, the first-year Randolph County schools superintendent trying to resolve the standoff. 
Some black residents describe Wedowee as a usually friendly town where old atti­tudes surface subtly -a conde­scending tone from a bus dri­ver, a cold shoulder in certain businesses, softly muttered racial slurs. 
"People may experience racism in the South in different ways, but for him to come out in the '90s and make such a statement and have that whole attitude, it's hard to believe," said Vanessa Daniel, who moved here from Chicago last year. 
"To end an otherwise good career just doesn't make any sense to me," school board 
Humphries was criticized in a 1989 review by the U.S. Department of Education for encouraging black and white students to ride separate buses, and was accused of meting out discipline unevenly. 
"It's been going on a long time," said Mary Ann Angel, who graduated seven years ago from Randolph, which is 62 percent white and 38 percent black. "It's been going on a long time." 
In the last week, a series of talks, some involving federal mediators, sought to settle the situation. 
About 50 of the 680 high school students attend classes taught by church volunteers, along with about 50 more stu­dents from lower grades. 
"I'd like to say there's been progress, but I don't l_(now," McKay said Friday. ''I'm always optimistic the sun will come out, but it just hasn't yet." 
Davenport and another 18­year-old senior, Pam Briskey, said they're hoping for a reso­lution before the prom. Both have black boyfriends, but have friends who date members of other races. 
"They don't want to go where they won't be accepted,"Briskey said. 
The Rev. Henry -Sterling, a Southern Christian Leadership Conference representative here from Anniston, Ala., said if no action is taken against Humphries, an alternative prom will be organized "where students can take whoever they want."

Israel will strongly oppose any military cooperation be­tween the PLO and a militant 
Muslim group that has claimed more responsibility for two sui­cide bomb attacks this month, Prime Minister 

Y i t z h a k Vasser Arafat 
Rabin said Sunday. 
The warning came amid re­ports that the Islamic Resis­tance Movement, or Hamas, had held meetings with officials of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah fac­tion in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. .

media said Hamas sought Fa­tab's agreement to continue at­tacks inside Israel. But Pales­tinians said the meetings fo­cused on arrangements be­tween the two rivals after self­rule starts in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
"Israel will thoroughly check the reports of cooperation, and if there is any truth to it, Israel will be strongly against it," Ra­bin spokesman Oded Ben-Ami quoted the prime minister as telling the weekly meeting of his Cabinet. 
Rabin later told reporters af­ter a meeting of his Labor Party, "I don't consider it pos­sible that we will reach agree­ment with the PLO if it reaches agreement with Hamas to avoid a civil war but allows attacks on Israelis." 
Hamas, which enjoys signifi­cant support among Palestini­ans, is the leading opponent of the Israeli-PLO accord. The agreement provides for an Is­raeli withdrawal and Pales­tinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, but has been held up for months by violence and dis­putes over security arrange­ments. Israel and the PLO have predicted that self-rule could_ begin by June. 
Hamas wants assurances from the PLO that it will be per­mitted to continue attacks with­in Israel after autonomy begins, Israel radio reported Sunday, citing Palestinian sources. The PLO has rejected the demand, the radio said. 
A meeting between Arafat and a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Abu Marzouk, in Sudan last year collapsed after Arafat re­jected Hamas demands for a large share of power in the PLO. There have been no known attempts since then to reconcile the two groups. 
However, a senior Fatah offi­cial told The Associated Press there had been talks with Hamas about local issues such as how to handle land disputes, control welfare institutions, share power in the Gaza municipality and prevent fric­tion between Hamas and the PLO. 
The official, who demanded anonymity, said there had been about 20 meetings in recent months. 
Sufian Abu Ziad, a top Fatah official in the Gaza Strip, told Israel Radio that there was "nothing new" in the negotia­tions but that Fatah rejected any independent Hamas mili­tary operations against IsraeL

tragedy one year later

WACO, Texas 

Branch Davidians who sur­vived the fire that destroyed their compound last year gath­ered with supporters Sunday to tell their story and mourn for those who died. 
About 200 people attended the one-day outdoor event held 100 yards from what was once the cult's sprawling complex called Mount Carmel. They were joined by vendors hawk­ing videos, T -shirts, hats, books and other items. 
Speakers blamed the federal government for the deaths of cult leader David Koresh and 78 of his followers in the fire on April 19, 1993. The blaze ended a 51-day standoff between the Davidians and fed­eral agents. 
"They murdered those peo­ple. The government came in here and burned them to death," said a crying John Borgman, a supporter who knew nothing of the cult until the siege began on Feb. 28, 1993. 
The fire began after FBI armored vehicles pumped tear gas into the compound. The government has said the Davidians set the fire and that those who died chose to remain inside the burning compound. 
The survivors adamantly deny such claims. 
Several Koresh followers, including at least two who escaped from the fire, told their story to an overwhelmingly pro-Davidian crowd. 
"This is the first time I've 
been-back out at this place since I left on the 19th," said survivor Clive Doyle. ''I'm kind of numb .... I miss it." 
"Basically, we're trying to keep this alive in the minds of America," he said, explaining why the survivors and their supporters held the event. 
Survivors have maintained that the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms unlawfully attacked the com­pound and that those inside were only trying to protect themselves when they fired back, killing four agents and wounding several others. 
ATF officials have said they were trying to serve search warrants and arrest Koresh on weapons charges. In February, 11 Davidians were acquitted of murder and conspiracy charges stemming from the botched raid. 
"I don't want people to forget what happened here," Doyle said. "The government would like them to." 
San Antonio resident Don Rex, an artist, wore a sandwich board that compared the stand­off to the battle at the Alamo. "It was a massacre," he said. 
Like those who died at the Alamo fighting for Texas' inde­pendence, Rex said, Koresh and the others died "for stand­ing up for what they believd 
in." 
The sand-colored compound is gone. 
Now, there are only mounds of debris and dirt sitting amid blooming bluebonnets and other wildflowers. Part of the area is surrounded by a chain­link fence.

Lone gunman theory question_ed in Mexico 
By SUSANA HAYWARD Associated Press 
TIJUANA, Mexico 
Secret Service agents said they found a weapon used to kill Mexico's leading presiden­tial candidate after the alleged assassin had indicated another firearm, police documents show. 
The conflicting reports raised fresh doubts whether Luis Donaldo Colosio, killed at a March 23 campaign rally here, was slain by a lone gunman, as investigators currently main­tain. 
Mario Aburto confessed to the crime and has been charged with the murder. Three men hired for crowd control at the rally have been charged with being co-partici­pants in homicide. 
Authorities say the three men helped clear a path through a crowd for Aburto to shoot Colosio, the leading contender for the Aug. 21 election as can­didate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. or PRI. 
But doubts persist whether Aburto acted alone because no ballistics report has been made available and authorities say only one bullet was found, even though Colosio was hit twice. 
In a report of Aburto's inter­rogation at the Attorney General's office here, Aburto identified a Taurus .38 revolver as the weapon "he used to fire the shots" at Colosio. 
The revolver had two bullets missing and two in the car­tridge. 
The weapon was in a bag during questioning and was identified by Aburto at about 
7:30 p.m. on March 23, Jose 
a lot of doubts about the one 
gun theory." 
Miguel Montes, special prose­cutor in the case, has said bal­listics tests showed the bullet found matched the Taurus revolver, and that the two shots came from the same gun. The government has not made that report public. 
Colosio was shot in the head and in the abdomen. Only the bullet that pierced his stomach was found at the scene, officials 
say. 
"It's possible that there was more than one gun but it's hard to tell," said Tijuana General Hospital chief of surgery' Sergio Mascareno, one of a team of doctors who operated on Colosio and declared him 
dead. 
Mascareno and the autopsy 
report said Colosio was shot in the head on the right temple, the bullet entering the right side and exiting on the left, while the bullet to the stomach entered from the left and exited right. 
A physician present at the operation and autopsy said the secret service confiscated rolls of photography taken by three doctors "for national security." 
The physician said doctors often take photos during opera­tions for scientific research. After the film was confiscated, a secret service doctor was allowed to take pictures, the physician said on condition of anonymity. 
Aburto said initially he didn't mean to kill Colosio but that "somebody bumped into me or shoved me." He has since said he acted alone, but in an inter­rogation last month indicated By MARTIN CRUTSINGER Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
The International Monetary Fund, in a surprising turn­about, is likely to approve a $1.5 billion loan to Russia this week that could open the way for billions of dollars of post­poned Western assistance to begin flowing to President Boris Yeltsin's government. 
IMF officials said that the 
loan proposal, which has al­ready been endorsed by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus. is on the agenda 
for consideration by the execu­tive board Wednesday. 
Officials, who spoke on con­dition of anonymity, said that barring any last-minute snags, it should win.approval. The IMF loan will represent a vote of confidence by the agency in 
Russia's latest plan to get con­trol of its economy. 
It also represents a key bur-die Yeltsin's government had to clear in order to tap into even more substantial amounts of aid in the form of debt relief from Western creditors and project loans from the IMF's 
sister agency, the World Bank. 
The IMF action would rep­resent a surprising turn of events since the leading archi­tects of Russia's reform re­signed their Cabinet posts sud­denly in January. 
They had charged that the opponents of economic reform had gained the upper hand following elections in which ultra-nationalists had made a strong showing. 
Their departure prompted widespread hand-wringing in the West and dire warnings that Russia's economy, already in chaos, would spiral further outof control. 
Vice President AI Gore and others in the Clinton adminis­tration openly criticized the IMF for being too tough in

general for human rights who Iii 
was present during Aburto's questioning, said Sunday. 
But in a police report read to an AP reporter and another foreign news correspondent by • police director Federico Benitez, secret service agents returned to the hospital where Colosio was taken at 9:30 p.m. with a bag that they said con­tained the murder weapon. 
It is not known what weapon, if any, was inside that bag. No comment was available from secret service authorities or the attorney general's office. 
Canchola said the report, filed by David Rubi Gomez, a 
IMF may grant Russia loan 
demanding that Russia rein in its economy. 
The IMF got critical backing from Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. His view ultimately prevailed that Western aid would be wasted unless Russia got its economy under control by following IMF guidelines. 
Camdessus reached agree­ment with Yeltsin's government last month on a package of pro­posals aimed at cutting infla­tion, which soared by 950 per­cent last year, to 7 percent a month and restraining the gov­ernment's budget deficit. 
While Russia has missed other similar targets, an IMF official said he was optimistic that the new program would allow the country to get control of inflation and finally stop the steep drop in economic output. 
The official, who briefed re­porters Friday on condition that his name not be used, said the $1.5 billion loan could be fol­lowed later this year with the start of $4 billion in more per­manent IMF support. 
He said such a program "could make a decisive con­tribution to allow Russia to sta­bilize its economy to start growing again." 
Others question whether Yeltsin will be able to live up to his deficit-reduction commit­ments given the heavy pressure he is facing to help millions of suffering Russians.

Brown's spring weekend restricted IU quiet 
By MARCY DINIUS Campuses Editor 
In an effort to stop the in­creasing problem of underage drinking at the annual Spring Weekend celebration at Brown University, administrators is­sued new guidelines for what has become one of the Provi­dence university's major social events. 
Fraternities at the school will no longer be permitted to have parties where alcohol is served after 6:30 pm. Only the school's Greek Council will be issued a liquor license for a Saturday night campus-wide event to be held on the Main Green, where students will be charged admission to dance and see a laser light show. A bar will also be available to 21­year old students able to buy drinks. 
Holocaust protest grows at Miami 
By ZOE MARIN Assistant Campuses Editor 
In response to an advertise­ment that ran in the University of Miami's student newspaper last Wednesday, a local organi­zation held a protest on the campus of the university prior to its printing. 
The protest grew violent when the university's presi­dent, Tad Foot, received a bomb threat on Tuesday by telephone at his office located in the administration building. The newspapjlr, the Miami Hurricane, also received a similar threat. 
The protest was organized by the Hillel Organization, a local Jewish organization in Miami. A speaker addressed a crowd numbering between 300-400 in front of the campus adminis­tration building on Tuesday, stating that his grandmother had been a victim of the Holo­caust 
The paid advertisement was submitted by Holocaust revi­sionist, Bradley Smith, who claims that there is no substan­tial proof that the gas cham­bers of the Holocaust ever existed. 
The university administration also placed an ad directly above Smith's publicizing a university sponsored forum organized for open discussion about the Holocaust. 
Foot, Lynette Malinger, the newspaper's editor-in-chief, and a representative from the Hillel Organization debated the issues on a morning talk show the day after the protest. 
The president of the univer­sity, Tad Foot, was openly criti­cized by the organization for not administering any control over the newspaper and allow­ing the advertisement to run. However, the president dis­agreed, stating that part of the university's role in the stu­dents' education was to expose controversial issues, such as the ad. and not to hide them.

for Little 
500 races 
By ZOE MARIN Assistant Campuses Editor 
Indiana University's annual Little 500 held this past week­end was quiet and uneventful this year, according to Jeni Bell, city editor for the student newspaper, The Daily Student. 
Only 170 arrests were made this year, compared to the 200 in 1993 and the 400 in 1991. 
"Most of the arrests were weekend visitors, not I.U. stu­dents, and all of them were al­cohol related offenses," said Bell. 
Bell said the police kept a close eye on the apartment complexes that had been the focus of problems last year. Many of the residents of the apartments were reported to be working with the police to help prevent any possible riots. 
"The residents helped inform the police about any large par­ties," said Bell. 
Although the students and visitors were generally peace­ful, the helicopter equipped with a flood light was back this year to patrol the campus dur­ing the night. The police were also well represented in num­ber. 
"After a while, everyone was wondering why the police were going through all the trouble," said Bell. 
The fraternities were also quiet. Gun shots were reported to be heard briefly, but their origin and location aren't being released until today by police. It is unknown if the fraternities are connected in any way. 
Bell said that the police aren't concerned so much with underage drinking as they are about large, rowdy parties that could become dangerous. 
Also prohibited by Student Life and Student Activities dur­ing Spring Weekend is the sale of bracelets, tickets and any other items in exchange for al­cohol and any "impromptu" parties to be held by students. 
Director of Student Life Robin Rose said that such severe re­strictions were the result of dif­ficulties encountered at last year's events. 
"Last year, we had a signifi­cant problem with the large number of high school students from the Providence area trying to crash the parties, " Rose said in the Brown Daily Herald. "It got to the point where there were hundreds [of non-Brown students] trying to get in." 
The sale of bracelets and mugs before Spring Weekend events created many problems with underage drinking for the university. Also encountered

At the University of Illinois, members of the Native Ameri­can Students, Staff and Faculty for Progress have charged that the school's mascot Chief Illiniwek is discriminatory against Native Americans and filed race discrimination com­plaints with the U.S. Depart­ment of Education. 
"We would like the feder­al government to issue an order permanently enjoin­ing the University from using race-related mas­cots," Tony Rodriguez, a NASSFP member, told the Daily Illini, the campus newspaper. 
"For the last few years, we've tried every available option. We've written letters and talked to officials. The suit was filed as a last resort. There was no other recourse to deal with this issue that was a non-legal recourse," Rodriguez said to the Illini. 
Members of the NASSFP had already attempted to stop the

were problems with 11 false fire alarms during the event. 
"We cannot and will not re­peat that kind of situation," Rose told the Herald. "Therefore we have been work­ing with Greek council and try­ing to figure out a way for them to have a party on Saturday night in a location which is safe, and which would decrease the problem with fire alarms and underage drinking." 
"We have no intention of killing Spring Weekend," Rose also said. 
Yet many students fear that this is the beginning of the end for the spring celebration at Brown. Greek Council Presi­dent Nick Rubenstein agreed with students, saying that "what Spring Weekend has turned into is a normal week­end at Brown." 
Rubenstein says that the reg-
use of the Chief as the Illinois mascot by speaking to the Illi­nois Human Rights Commission which rejected its suit and by attempting to speak with the University Board of Trustees, which denied its request for di­alogue. 
"On March 14, I wrote a letter to the trustees requesting speaking time at the April 7 meeting. I received a letter three days ulations have taken away stu­dents' options during the event. He did not know why the Greek Council was not allowed to manage the weekend, arguing that students "would be much more alert this year," since there "has not been a single problem at a fraternity party: no trouble with over-intoxica­tions or false fire alarms pulled" since September, Rubenstein told the Herald. 
In spite of the new restric­tions, many organizations are attempting to give students more options. "A lot of organi­zations are trying to work around the rules and make sure that Spring Weekend is a success," said Undergraduate Council of Students Vice-presi­dent Czerina Patel to the Her­ald. "We don't want just Spring night. We want Spring Week­end," Patel said. 
later permitting me to speak for five minutes, but on (March 29), I was told that I could not speak," Rodriguez told the Illini. 
Rodriguez said that if the De­partment of Education fmds the complaints to have been made in good faith and representative of a legitimate problem, a hear­ing officer will be assigned to the case. Testimony from both sides will be heard at a hearing, allowing the NASSFP to go to court if the decision is in its 
favor. 

"This is a legitimate 
issue that needs to be 

addressed. But making 
it a legal issue sup­
presses discussion," said 
Byron Higgins, counsel for 
the university, told the 

Illini.

FRANK PIMENTEL AND SARAH KHALER 
Anybody who read last week's editions of the Observer encountered one personally­narrated devastating story after another detailing what rape had done to the author-victim. It is difficult to conceive of a more violent appropriation of a human being than rape. And if you doubt that, consider why it takes rape victims so much longer to heal than victims of simple gunshot wounds. 
But we write to consider what if anything can be done to stem the tide of this crime. First, however, we should defme the crime. 
In Indiana, rape occurs when "[a] person ... knowingly or in­tentionally has sexual inter­course with a member of the opposite sex when: (1) The other person is compelled by force or imminent threat of force; (2) The other person is unaware that the sexual inter­course is occurring; or (3) The other person is so mentally dis­abled or deficient that consent to sexual intercourse cannot be given." 
Additionally, Indiana has a parallel law for "Criminal devi­ate conduct" (oraVanal sodomy) 
·when it occurs under one of the same conditions listed for rape. Finally, there is the lesser, but still felonious, crime of "sexual battery." Sexual battery occurs when "[a] person who, with in­tent to arouse or satisfy the person's own sexual desires or the sexual desires of another person, touches another person when that person is: {1) Compelled to submit to the touching by force or the immi­nent threat of force; or (2) So mentally disabled or deficient that consent to the touching cannot be given." States vary in

this area, so where a sexual as­sault occurs may determine what type of punishment the perpetrator is liable for. 
But that assumes that a pros­ecution is being sought-which, when it is not, we believe per­petuates the problem. 
Whatever the accurate per­centage is of women (college women) who are raped or are victims of attempted rape-and the estimates vary widely-one is too many. And it seems that everybody at least knows some­body who has been raped or the victim of a sexual assault. On this campus. 
Moreover, it is estimated that as many as 90 percent of women who have been raped do not report it. Also, 70 to 80 percent of rape victims know their attackers. Perhaps these statistics are related. 
In any case, while rapists of­ten do not realize that what they have done is rape, it can­not help matters that nine out of ten times the rapist sleeps well and without interruption. This might overestimate the value of deterrence, but it seems reasonable that if we all also knew somebody who had faced a criminal charge for a sexual crime, then some men might think twice. In other words, if all victims of sexual assault and rape took legal action, society as a whole would have no choice but to notice. 
So why do so few women re­port that they have been raped? For one, they may not even realize it at first. If a woman can convince herself that some­how she did something to allow it, especially if it was by a guy that she knew then she "wasn't raped." But that approach can only have a limited lifespan. 
Apparently many women also feel that "going public" (which could vary from merely report­ing it to the police to telling one's friends) could subject them to shame. What reason­able person could blame a woman for having been at­tacked and subdued by a dis­turbed man? 
Along with that, group sup­port and counseling for rape victims are abundant. What's more, they work. And while it seems that many women often encounter skeptical police offi­cers, especially when it comes to date rape, prosecutors will take it seriously if you force them to. They will also be hon­est about odds for a conviction . 
More specifically, there seems to be a belief among many 
GARRY TRUDEAU QUOTE OF THE DAY 
women at Notre Dame that the administration handles sexual crime allegations with two left feet. Whether or not that is true, you always have the option of going straight to the St. Joseph's County prosecutors and beginning from there. Whatever you do, though, do not be talked out of taking ac­tion if you have been wronged. By prosecuting, a woman sends a message, not only to the per­petrator but to herself, that rape is unacceptable and there­by vindicates her human digni­ty. By depriving herself of that she essentially allows herself to be victimized twice. 
As for the specifics of possible parietals violatjpns, whether or not you may have been drink­ing, or even whether you had had a previous sexual relation­ship with the man, none of those are reasons to be de­terred. The possible ramifica­tions of parietals violations, etc., which it seems unlikely would be enforced in this situa­tion, pale in comparison to a whole lifetime of regret. 
The most important thing to say, though, is that there is life after surviving rape. It is possi­ble to trust (and love and be loved) again. It is possible to be sexually "normal" again. And it is possible to believe that God still loves you and is watching out for you even so. But these all come much easier if you take action and do not permit yourself to be victimized twice.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
S.U.R.V. needs expanding Will environmentalists 
Dear Editor: 
We are writing because of the overwhelming support for the expansion of S.U.R.V. (Spes Unica Resource and Volunteer Center) that was demonstrated by Saint Mary's students in last week's survey conducted by 
S.A.S.O. (Student Advocates for Service Opportunities). Over 95% of students who voted said they would take advantage of 
S.U.R.V. 
if its facilities were expanded to offer more service opportunities. 

S.U.R.V. 
is a student-run organization which attempts to provide students with referrals· to community service organiza­tions as well as develop service opportunities for students with­in the Saint Mary's community. 

Because S.U.R.V. is a student­run organization, the office is limited to the number of hours it can remain open to students. 

S.U.R.V. 
also elects a new stu­dent director each year, mak­ing continuity difficult to estab­lish and maintain. The new director is faced with the diffi­culties of establishing contacts within the community. 


Located in an inconspicuous section of Haggar College Center, S.U.R.V. remains an unrecognized and poorly uti­lized resource for students. 
Although S.U.R.V. is currently not taken full advantage of, this is not a reflection of students' disinterest in service opportuni­ties as much as it is an indica­tion of S.U.R.V.'s need for improvement. 
As members of S.A.S.O. we have become increasingly con­cerned over the future of 
S.U.R.V. We believe that an

Dear Editor: 
In an article on a recent envi­ronmental forum (April 13, 1994). The Observer reports that Frank Timons, a third year law student, made the observa­tion that "four out of five Americans are willing to sacri­fice jobs for the environment. " (The direct quote is from the Observer article, not Mr. Timons.) 
I find this an odd way of putting the issue. Surely the relevant question is not whether four out of five Americans would be willing to sacrifice "jobs for the envi­ronment", but the number of Americans who would be will­ing to sacrifice their own jobs for the environment Somehow, I suspect that if you asked five Oregonian lumberjacks
expansion would be beneficial to Saint Mary's and the outlying community. 
As the end of the semester approaches, we are faced with the urgency of having S.A.S.O.'s proposal for an improved ser­vice center approved by the Board of Governance (BOG). We are· hoping to establish an improved center in honor of the college's Sesquicentennial Year./In order to ensure the establishment of this improved service center within the Sesquicentennial year. we need support from more students.

sacrifice their jobs (and their families' livelihoods, their kids' education, etc.) to enhance, say, the life-prospects of the spotted owl, you would get a different response. 
Additionally, in light of Mr. Timons' discussion of "tough legislative decisions" and "gov­ernment grants for studying environmental issues", it's worth pointing out that job prospects for law students don't exactly plummet as a result of the environmental legislation he has in mind. 
When the day comes that four out of five American lawyers are willing to give up their jobs for the environment, perhaps we can take such statistics more seriously. 
IRFAN KHAWAJA Graduate Student 

Active support needs to be demonstrated in order to ensure the expansion of 
S.U.R.V. We urge students to make the acceptance of this proposal a priority by showing their support at the B.O.G. meeting. The future of service opportunities at Saint Mary's College depends on it.

Is it cheating or studying? 

Dear Editor: 
This is a response to the Inside Column (7 April, 1994) "Do ethics mean anything to Domers today?" by Ann Blum, Assistant Advertising Manager. 
On possible revisions to "Life's Little Book of Instructions;" 
The columnist (C; Ann Blum) of the article "Do Ethics Mean Anything to Domers Today?" was selective in her representa­tion of the circumstances cited as precipitating her column. Factually, I (the instructor) was given an anonymous note less than 5 minutes prior to the retake exam accusing unspeci­fied persons of preplanned "memory pooling." 
The class thereafter was noti­fied of a possible honor-code breech, given an opportunity for discussion, and then retook the exam on the proviso that further evaluation would occur (no immunity was given any­one). This evaluation involved, among other things, consulta­tion with the department chair­person and examination of the honor code, and resulted in the view that there neither was a clearcut basis for a conclusion of cheating nor, in the absence of a formal complaint from someone with first-hand knowl­edge, a platform for filing charges. 
These "findings" subse-quent­ry pooling," (b) offer support to any student that wished to "step forward," and (c) main­tain an open door to anyone that wanted further discussion. The columnist (C) did not avail herself of these latter two options, leaving open thereby the possibility of loss of credi­bility for "failing to get the facts straight" prior to going to 
'while the honor 
code seems not to have been precisely violated, the good faith and trust of the instructor was.' 
press. However, C has since shared her views with me, and makes two important points. 
First, while the honor code seems not to have been precise­ly violated, the good faith and trust of the instructor was (even though it is NOT clear to me, as avowed by C, that "what happened was still cheating"). Nonetheless, given the context of the 'retake exam,' those that participated in the preplanned, clandestine activity violated the spirit of this opportunity.

quence, the fact that these  
scores 'stand' arguably is tanta­ 
mount to a reward for this joint  
"violation" of honor-code spirit  
and trust. Accusations by C  
notwithstanding, the real prob­ 
lem with a standard such as  
ours is that it cannot work  
unless ALL participate in good  
faith. It is impractical to identi­ 
fy (let alone enforce) all possi­ 
ble situations defining an ethi­ 
cal breech. Thus, to work, our  
standard requires chronic per­ 
sonal vigilance and openness,  
devoid of camouflage and sub­ 
terfuge, from every one of us.  
I wish C had chatted with me  
when given the opportunity.  
Had she gotten all the facts  
before her column, she could  
have avoided accusations of  
selective enunciation, possible  
damage to my reputation as a  
class manager, and possible  
discredit to her main and important points.  -.  
While I understand that the  
moral vicissitudes of life often  
are more obviously binary  
when young, yet another possi­

'overblown' issue is that they

Sabres shutout Devils; Capitals ·stun Penguins 
Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 
Dominik Hasek gave the Buf­falo Sabres just what they ex­pected in their opening-round playoff series with the New Jer­sey Devils -great goaltending. 
Todd Simon provided the un­expected Sunday night, a goal. 
Hasek brought his regular­season goaltending brillance to the, playoffs by stopping 30 shots and the seldom-used Si­mon provided all· the offensive support he needed with his first NHL goal as the Sabres beat the Devils 2-0 in 'their playoff open­er. 
Alexander Mogilny added an empty-net goal with 8.2 sec­onds to play in the opener of the best-of-7 series. 
Game 2 will be played in East Rutherford on Tuesday night before the series shifts to Buf­falo for the next two games. 
"New Jersey played very well but Dominik was just Dominik," Sabres coach John Muckier said. "He was outstanding." 
Hasek, whose 1. 95 goals­against average this past sea­son was the best in the NHL since Bernie Parent had a 1.89 GAA in the mid 1970s, was the difference in Game 1, particu­larly in the second period when the Devils outshot Buffalo 13-5. 
"I had a good season, that's why I feel confident now," said Hasek, who stopped a league­high 93 percent of the shots he faced this past season. "I think I saw every shot except one in the third. Fortunately it hit me in my pad." 
Simon, who played only 15. games with the Sabres after spending most of the season in the AHL, put the Sabres ahead on his first shift of the game with 11 seconds left in the first period. 
It came with the Sabres on a 4-on-3 power play and Muckier almost laughed when asked why Simon was on the ice. 
"He's very good on draws," Muckier said with a smile, adding the soon-to-be 21-year­old knows what to do around the net. 
"I was just hoping I would get the call," said Simon, who had just one assist this season. "It was a good opportunity on a 4­on-3 and he (Muckier) told me to go right to the net if I won the face off." 
Simon, who played only three shifts all game, won the faceoff and did just as he was told. 
Standing on the edge of the goalie's crease, Simon deflected a Dale Hawerchuk shot from the right point into Devils goalie Martin Brodeur. The puck came out and Simon pushed the rebound back into the goalie only to be stopped again. On his third try, he chipped it over the prone goalie. 
''I'm really on a cloud right now," said Simon, who led all scorers in Canadian Junior A hockey in 1991-92. "Not only the goal, but this win. We played a great game all around. Dominik played really well and the defense was just outstlnd­ing. The goal hasn't hit me yet." 
Buffalo killed off five New Jer­sey power plays, including a 31-second two-man advantage in the second period with about 12 minutes to play. 
CAPITALS 5, PENGUINS 3 
PITTSBURGH 
They've tried this twice before and it hasn't worked, but the Washington Capitals persist on winning playoff-series openers against the Pittsburgh Pen­guins. 
The Capitals wore down the favored Penguins with patience and defensive pressure, sealing a 5-3 victory on Joe Juneau's breakaway goal at 10:34 of the third period Sunday night in a first-round playoff game. 
"We talked about playing abrasive, aggressive hockey and we did," Capitals coach Jim Schoenfeld said. "We were aggressive defensively, but we were also aggressive offensively by attacking the net. You've got to play intelligently against a team with the firepower they have, and we did." 
The Penguins responded with the same passive, mistake­prone style that led to their sec­ond-round playoff series loss to the New York Islanders last season. 
"We were a little flat, and we didn't have the intensity we should have had from every­body," said Mario Lemieux, who scored twice. 
Peter Bondra and Mike Ridley scored 2:22 apart in the second period to reverse a one-goal Pittsburgh lead as the Capitals beat the Penguins in a playoff opener for the third time in four seasons. 
Goaltender Don Beaupre stopped 27 of 30 shots, five during one first-period Penguins power play. 
The Penguins won Stanley Cups in 1991 and 1992 after losing their initial playoff game against Washington.

bleheader against Butler and made two important plays at third. 
Sophomore Rowan Richards beat out junior starter Robby Birk in the voting for left field. Richards had played in 19 games this year, but has only started one game. 
In centerfield, freshman Scott Sollmann dominated the voting. The speedy outfielder leads the team in stolen bases with 16. 
Sophomore Ryan Topham got the nod over freshman Mike Amrhein in right field. Topham, who has a .300 batting aver­age, has the best eye on the team with a team-high 24 walks. 
The designated hitter voting was the most interesting as two write-in candidates challenged Murphy's choices. Sophomore power hitter George Restovich got the most votes. Mapes came in second, but not by much as several people added DeSensi to their ballots. 
The students were not al­lowed to chose the pitcher for the game. Murphy says fresh­man Gregg Henebry and junior Tim Kraus are his projected starters. 
Henebry, a lefthander with a 
2.89 earned run average and a 2-1 record, has been impres­sive thus far. His last win came against Wisconsin-Milwaukee on Friday night. Kraus (5.02, 2­
0) won the second game of that doubleheader. 
Murphy will choose the lineup for the first game which starts at 5 p.m. at Eck Stadium. The second game with the student's lineup should start around 7 or 7:30p.m. 

Pitcher Tom Price threw his fifth complete game, shutting out Butler on nine hits.

Greg Layson (5-for-15) and Robby Birk (5-for-15). 
Notre Dame closed the series with a 10-3 victory over the Bulldogs thanks to a strong pitching performance from ju­nior righthander Marty De­Graff. 
Lifting his record to 2-0, De­Graff scattered one run on three hits and six strikeouts over six innings of relief for Irish starter Craig Allen. 
"Mentally, I made a slight ad­justment after the Miami game. The ball was flat," said DeGraff. "Now, I'm just going out with a focus." 
The Irish got on the board with four runs in the second inning when Robbie Kent opened the game with a triple. After a walk to Dennis Twomb­ley, Bulldog starter P.J. Longstreth gave up a RBI single to Robbie Birk and a two-run The Observer/John Bingham triple to Ryan Topham.

Notre Dame picked up three more runs in the third on a run scoring double by Twombley and a sacrifice flies from Topham and Lisanti. Kent's one-out single scored another run in the fourth inning. 
In the seventh inning, Twombley's 330-foot round­tripper into the wind and Greg Layson's double added two more runs to give the Irish a 10-3 edge. 
In the first game of Sunday's doubleheader, freshman pitch­er Larry Mobs shutting out the Bulldogs 3-0 for his first career win and his first complete game. 
Mobs (1-1) gave up four hits and one walk while striking out three in the seven inning game. 
Birk scored the winning run in the second inning on a error by Butler second baseman Marc Chignali, but Twombley's two-run dinger over the right centerfield wall in the seventh inning was the offensive high­light of the game. 
On Saturday, Butler snapped Notre Dame's eight game win streak with a 3-1 seven inning victory. 
Bulldog starter Brandon Leese used the wind to his ad­vantage giving up only one run on three hits while Irish starter Darin Schmalz (2-2) took the loss with three runs on four hits. 
Butler scored all three of its runs in the third inning. Notre Dame's only run came in the fourth when Birk singled to centerfield to score Mark Mapes. 
The second game of Satur­day's doubleheader was all Irish as Tom Price shutout the Bulldogs while freshman Javier Fuentes drove in three runs in the 8-0 win. 
Fuentes created runs with his bat and his baserunning in the second inning as he turned a one-run single into a two-run double by forcing Butler to throw off the mark to second. He added another RBI single in the fourth. 
Price notched his fifth com­plete game of the year with a nine-hit shutout.

Notre Dame goalie gets on the board in lacrosse 
By TIM SHERMAN 
Sports Writer 
You know things are going your way when your goalie gets into the act and scores a goal. 
That's exactly what happened on Saturday in Colorado Springs as Irish goalie Ryan Jewell contributed a 

goal in 15th Ryan Jewell 
ranked Notre Dame's 20-8 romp over the Air Force Academy. It was the sixth straight win for the 8-1 
Irish, and their second consecu­tive league victory, 
Once again, the Irish seized control of the game early and continued to wear the opponent down, in the process building an insurmountable lead. 
"Obviously, it was a good win, just because we need to keep. winning to get to the (NCAA) tournament," said defenseman Mike Iorio, who managed to score his third goal in the past two games. "The way we looked at it was as just another piece of the puzzle. We did what it took." 
Robbie Snyder continued to provide the early spark. The senior attackman scored twice in the 4-0 first period to get the Irish out of the gate quickly. 
The defense was just as solid. The Iorio-led longsticks allowed just one Falcon shot to reach Jewell. 
Combined with this effort was an edge in both faceoffs and groundballs. 
Air Force began to generate some momentum early in the second period, as it notched the first two goals, slicing the lead to two. 
The momentum was short­lived, though, as Snyder again took charge. 
The team's leading scorer with 45 points tallied twice in less than two minutes, keeping the Irish in command the rest of the way.

leads and let the team back in," said Iorio. "Saturday, though, we just kept it rolling. Our size, speed, and strength over­matched them." 
As the game wore on, the physical edge just became more apparent. 
In the third period, five dif­ferent Irish players tickled the twine, building the lead to 15-6. 
There would be no let-down in the final frame, with four more of coach Kevin Corrigan's charges getting into the score­book. 
In all, eleven different players found the back of the net. Such balance is nice, especially com­ing from the midfielders, who, at times, have struggled to score. 
"Most of our scoring has come from the attack through­out the year," said Iorio. "Today, however, the midfield­ers were a little more incorpo­rated into the offense. Even if they aren't scoring, they're doing the job on 'D' and controlling the ball. But it defi­nitely is nice when they con­tribute." 
Just as nice as when the 
goalie and long-sticks are scor­ing. 
"To be honest, their riding was poor," said Iorio. "Because they couldn't match-up with us, they had to try some different things. They left a lot of open­ings." • 
At 13;17 of the third, Jewell found one of those openings, and exploited it. 
He and defensemen Bill Gal­lagher cleared the ball up the field. The Falcons failed to pick Jewell up at the midfield line and he just kept moving until the shot presented itself. 
"It not too often that you see that," noted Iorio. "He was clearly very excited. It was fun." 
Fun has been the basic theme as of late for the Irish. Their play is improving as their mar­gin of victory has steadily in­creased. With the tournament on the horizon, the Irish couldn't be starting to peak at a better time. 
"In the past, we've peaked early in the season and kind of slacked off as we got to our conference games," said Iorio. "This year we're playing well at the right time. Now, we just have to keep it rolling."

•one of the most interesting games of the weekend was the game of the Presidents. Student Body President Dave Hungeling and his team, 5 Guys Who Say They'll Bring the Dead if We Win This Thing, played against University President Monk Malloy's All the President's Men team on Sunday. There wasn't much political talk during the game, and Monk was pretty quiet about the whole presiden­tial matchup. The crowd appreciated the matchup much more than the players. However, Monk did foul Dave on a breakaway layup attempt. It doesn't look like we'll get the Dead, because Monk's team prevailed, 21-14.

"We gave up a lot of hits in the first game," Miller says. "It just wasn't Joy's day -her pitches weren't really working and she was having trouble finding the plate. Irish did as well as we could have hoped for, considering she hasn't pitched for us very much this

Baseball carries momentum into CSU game 
Irish win three against Butler 
By JENNY MARTEN Senior Spons Writer 
INDIANAPOLIS 
The wind-blown Notre Dame baseball team (19-8) continued its winning ways Saturday and Sunday, taking three of four from Midwestern Collegiate Conference foe Butler. 
With gusts up to 30 mph blowing in from left field, the Irish dropped the series opener 3-1, but rebounded to win the 
-
next three games to raise their MCC record to 9-1. 
Irish coach Pat Murphy was glad to come away with three wins on the opponent's field. 
"These were adverse condi­tions," said Murphy. "To win three was not easy." 
The wind slowed an Irish of­fense which scored 98 runs in the eight games last week, but still managed to add 22 more runs to its total. 
Freshman Dennis Twombley contributed a chunk of this weekend's runs with a 4-for-10 performance that featured two homeruns, a double, and four RBls. 
As a back-up to one of the top defensive catchers in col­lege baseball, Twombley is making things difficult for Mur­phy. 
"I want to have his bat in there right now, but Lisanti has to catch. Bob's a great teacher. He's called every pitch for us this year," explained Murphy. 
Twombley understands his coach's position. 
"Bob's a super catcher. Why shouldn't he play every day?" said Twombley. "I think I can help the team when I play." 
In addition to Twombley, Notre Dame got strong offen­sive performances in the series from Robbie Kent (6-for-14),

Kobata throws no-hitter 
By MEGAN McGRATH Sports Writer 
When Terri Kobata is pitching well, the Notre Dame softball team can usu­ally count on a win, no matter how lackluster the rest of the team's perfor­mance. 
This was proven Saturday night in Indianapolis, when the Irish defeated Butler 1-0 in the second game of a dou­ble-header with their MCC rivals. Notre Dame cruised to an 8-1 victory in game one behind a 4-for-4 perfor­mance by Stephanie Pinter. 
But without a dominating pitcher to lead the way, the Irish struggled against Ball State Sunday at Notre Dame. Notre Dame dropped the first game of the double-header 5-0, where they were limited to three hits and committed three errors. The Irish ral­lied behind Kobata in the second game, and came up with a 2-0 win. 
"We just showed up to play in the first games this weekend; we finally showed up to win Sunday afternoon," was Notre Dame coach Liz Miller's as­sessment. "We were very nonchalant; we assumed it would happen without much effort and it didn't." 
Whatever "it" was, it was happening for Kobata in Saturday's outing, as she threw her 11th career no-hitter, strik­ing out 12 and walking two. The Irish had eight hits, with freshman Liz Perkins leading the way with a 3-for-4 day at the plate. Perkins had the game's only RBI with a third-inning double that scored Jenna Knudson. 
But Miller was concerned about what she perceived as a lethargic per­formance by her squad. 
"We were lucky to get out of Indianapolis with a win in game two," Miller said. "We just didn't seem to 
Starters, some surprises featured in fan's lineup 
By JENNY MARTEN Senior Sports Writer 

Some people thought baseball coach Pat Murphy had lost it when he announced last week that he was going to let the stu­dents pick the lineup for the second game of tonight's dou­bleheader against Cleveland State. 
One student said, "Is Murphy crazy? We still have to make it into the tournament." 
With the exception of the starting pitcher, the coach put his lineup in the hands of the majority, and the students re­sponded well with over 100 ballots returned. 
Since his purpose was to gen­erate student interest in the team, Murphy hopes that the students will come to Eck Sta­dium tonight for the games and to see their lineup play. 
And the winners are... 

Behind the plate, junior Bob Lisanti edged out freshman Dennis Twombley in a tight race. Lisanti has started 17 of Notre Dame's 32 games, but Twombley's bat has been hot of late with the freshman boasting 
a .400 batting average. 

The biggest surprise in the balloting was at first base as freshman Kevin Tommasini claimed more than half the votes. The freshman will get his first collegiate start after the fans chose him over write-in candidate Craig DeSensi and starter Robbie Kent. Tom­masini, who has played in 11 games, is hitting .333 with seven runs batted in. 
At second base, senior starter Greg Layson retained his start­ing spot over Kent. Kent's .390 batting average will be missed in the game. 
The voting at shortstop was the tightest with junior Paul Failla getting the nod over freshman Javier Fuentes by just two votes. 
At third base, senior Matt Haas led the voting, but he has been sidelined for the last seven games with a lower back strain and is not expected back for tonight's games. Sophomore Mark Mapes, who finished ahead of DeSensi in the ballot­ing, will fill in for Haas.
