The New Democratic Coali­tion, a political party claiming to have as its supporters former Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy people, issued a state­ment yesterday in which it ex­pressly condemned Father Hes­burgh's heralded statement on student dissent. 
Former McCarthy supporter Samuel Brown drew up the doc­ument, unanimously approved, in Washington, D.C. The state­ment says there is "a growing movement in this country for the repression of dissent." It goes on to exemplify Hesburgh as an advocate of this type of repression: "Probably the most obvious example of this trend is the recent letter from President Heshurgh of Notre Dame which unjustifiably disregards the de­mands for procedural and sub­stantive due process which should be available to any citi­zen accused of illegal behavior and substitutes authoritarian non-appealabil' judgment by a single person." 

In addition to the criticism of the university president, the statement dissapproved "any in­vestigation by any branch of the government into the political be­liefs of dissidents." 
In a telephone interview with the OBSHR VHR, NDC Indiana chairman Dr. Robert Toal reiter­ated the statement in that its goal is to promote the due pro­

The Tripartite Appeals Board 

recently completed a final draft 
of the procedure for student 
appeal within that body. 
The Board's three members, appointed by a subcommittee of .the Student Life Council, consist of student Joseph Rust, faculty member Professor Leo O'Brien, and cleric Father James Flanigan. The Appeals Board is not a trial board, but an alternative for those students who have gone through previous university judicial processes and who wish to appeal the decision. According to the Tripartite l3oard, the student who wants to make an appeal must file a notice to the Dean of Student's office "by the end of the second school day, i.e., 5:00 p.m. after notification of a disciplinary decision by the Dean of Students." The student is then 
required to go to the office with 
an outline of thos~ points of his 
appeal he wishes to cover. 
Action will not be delayed, as 
the board will prepare for an 
immediate hearing. 
In reference to its limitations, the board maintains it connot go over the appealed case anew, but that it must refer to previous judicial proceedings: "The Tripartite Appeals Board will not consider the case de novo. The defense counsel will proceed on the record of the previous trial or trials..." 
The board will make its decision within one day after the actual appeal proceedings have terminated. The. board's action will be a recommendation to the Dean of Students on the disciplinary course to take. Father Riehle, however, is not bound by the board's decision.

·THE WORLD TODAY 
Hesburgh: Judge university as it is 
NEW YORK (UPI) Universities should not be judged only by 
the unrest permeating them today, the Rev. Theodore llesburgh, 
president of Notre Dame, said yesterday. 
"It seems to me that the university should be judged by what it 
really is, not what it appears to be," llcsburgh said. 
"A very, very small minority of faculty and students seem to get 
about 99 percent of the exposure on university life whereas the great 
majority, the great, great majority, arc some of the best and well 
informed, well dcdil.:atcd people who really want to change the 
world for the better." 
Hesburgh, appearing on the NBC television show "First Tuesday" 
taped for showing tonight, repeated his position that students who 
persist in disrupting university life should be expelled. 
"All I was really saying is that anyone or any group who wanted 
to substitute violence for rational persuasion or mob action for 
civility should be informed that they arc not understanding what a 
university is all about," llcsburgh said. 
The university should, he said, bring "calm and rationality and 
analysis and dedication and cornpctcncc to the great problcms.wc 
face in the world." 
Apollo 9 astronauts dock landing craft 
SPACE CENTER, Houston (UPI) -The Apollo 9 astronauts linked up in space yesterday with a fragile lunar landing craft to start a l 0 day test of'lhe machines needed to land men on the moon. 
Within three hours after their ll a.m. EST launch from Cape Kennedy, the spacemen docked their Apollo with its lunar lander for the first space test of the strange looking craft that is scheduled to lam! two Americans on the moon this summer. 
They finished their first day activities at 5 p.m. EST by firing the main engine of Apollo 9 for five seconds to raise the orbit of the still linked spaceships. Activitcs ended early so they could get a good night's sleep. 
Ocspitc the successful docking and engine firing, the astronauts encountered continuing minor troubles with their cq uipmcnt. 
The launch itself went almost perfectly, however, as the men, fully recovered from their colds that caused a three clay delay, rode a Saturn 5 rocket into earth orbit. 
Supreme Court rules on election laws

Myopic re.-.ponse 
Ectilor: 
The myopic fawf!y response to recent campus events, which Mr. Mario Corradi described so well in last Thursday's OBSHR­VHR, is unfortunately well illus­trated in Mr. Frederick Crosson's criticism of an earlier letter hy Mr. J o scph Duffy of the Department of English. Mr. Crosson's analysis, I speak charitably, implies that my colleague wrote a generalized attack on the police, the ad ministration, and the forces of evil, an attack in which the violent demonstrators became the good guys and the police, of course, the bad. But the substance of Mr. Duffy's letter praised and defended the role played by Mr. Peter Michelson and Mr. John Matthias in restraining violence and cooling tempers during the famous pronography-conference weekend. Since Mr. Duffy's letter first appeared, national television, assisted by the President of this university, has alleged that Mr. Michelson incited and led the disturbance. Although distinguished members of the faculty have risen to denounce attacks on Father llesburgh, neither they nor Mr. 
Crosson says a word about this damaging, unfounded allegation directed against a member of the university faculty. Mr. Crosson's major aim is to be witty, in the tritest possible way, by reminding us that Mr. Duffy is a specialist in fiction and, consequently, lives in an imaginary world of his own. 
But the same Joseph Duffy whom he attacks in his snotty letter was a nationally prominent critic of the war in Vietnam long before that criticism became a ·national or 

academic fashion. In Novcmhcr 1965 the same Joseph Duffy addressed one of the first national rallies against the war in Washington, D.C. And that same Joseph Ouffy, and members of his family, have been harflassed precisely because he left his world of fiction and possibly because, like many people in the arts, he is very sensitive to human questions. However fashionable even discussion of the war became, it was never so popular that Mr. Crosson felt impelled to join the chorus. Poets have a curious habit of showing up on picket lines much oftener than administrators. 
The facile reduction of Mr. Crosson's letter to a good-guy versus bad-guy issue characterizes much of the faculty response to Donald Hynes' column. Hysterical and intcrmperate it was, and amusing to see a young man, who voluntarily chose an all-male university and who is himself celibate-permanently or temporarily or at least occasionally-, express his displeasure at other people's celibacy. But Donald Bynes said other things in his column. lie charged that Father Hesburgh is carefully shielded from the direct criticism of his faculty. I would hardly regard his annual, autumnal lectures to the university f~.tculty as a confrontation, let alone a meeting of minds. Donald Hynes charged that the Ocan of Students is, in practice, unsympathetic to 
demonstrators. If he struck one, as Hynes alleges, perhaps the charge should be examined. Perhaps the Dean of Students should inform the foul-mouthed intimidation is inconsistent with what an open, free university should be. Oonald llynes als~> alleges that Father Hcsburgh's highly touted personal, lengthy study of the politics of confrontation, at least in its verbal form in his letter, is merely an unacknowledged summary of an article by John

demonstration  that  their

R. Searle in the 29 Occember 1968 New York Times Magazine. The similarities in structure, phrasing, emphasis, and logic are so striking that I now well understand why Father llesburgh does so much of his work in "the wee hours" of the night. 
A serious issue confronts the university, yet administrators, faculty, and students arc responding in panic. Ironically, the tempered, measured, and intelligently qualified responses are coming from the student publications, not from ad min is t rat o rs or teachers. l'erhaps all of us might heed the 
_students' rcq uest for a serious, thoughtful examination of what the university community is and to what extent its alliances with government, business, and the military arc as much out of keeping with the nature of a university as violence itself is. The university community has serious questions to ask itself. At this campus, not even the promise of serious discussion has been made, even though it has been requested through those highly ad vertiscd legitimate channels. To place the burden of guilt for campus unrest solely on the d istuptivc demonstrators strikes me as somewhat com­parable to telling the black man to go back to his ghetto and stop disturbing the peace and quiet of a healthy community.

That's right. Creighton 79, ND 74 

By TERRY SHIELDS 
Observer Sparts Writer 

The NCAA-bound Fighting Irish were dumped back into reality last night by a group of determined ballplayers from Creighton University. The Irish lost 7 9-7 4 and deservedly so because they were beaten at the fundamentals: foul shooting, ball handling, shooting and most of all "hustle." 
The Irish were caught flat footed from the opening tip and the Blue Jays bolted into an 8-0 lead. Captain Bob Arnzen and Bob Whitmore finally began to get hot and they managed to get the Irish a six point lead with I 0: 18 left in the half. However, Wally Anderzunas and Bob Portman also began to find the range for the visitors. The con­test remained nip and tuck throughout the remainder of the half with a final burst from Creighton supplying them with a 35-31 halftime lead.

Poor shooting during the first stanza plagued ND. At the mid­point they were shooting a meager 35% from the field and a less than mediocre 5 of I 0 from the charity line. Creighton shot only average (42%) from the field but their ability to move the ball through the man for man defense of the Irish proved to be the difference from the turnover stand point. 
The second half began much like the first and by 13:23 the Jays held a ten point edge. Coach Dee then began to utilize his bench. His strategy of out­sizing the men from Omaha worked as the Irish managed to tie the score at 58 with the help of some aggressive offensive re­bounding on the part of Collis Jones. With 7:48 left Dee sent his starting lineup of Arnzen,

September 28, 1968. College foot­balL Notre Dame versus Oklahoma. Middle of the fourth period. Big lead for the home team. The second unit Irish defense is seeing its first action of the year. 
First and I 0 at the Sooner 26. Power sweep. Aimed at Notre Dame left end Tony Capers. Oklahoma full­back Steve Owens misses his block on T.C., scrambles a few yards along the ground, then tries to leg-whip him. 
Owens' cleats catch Capers behind his right ankle. Like a guitar string sanpping from excess pressure, Capers' Achilles tendon goes, "twang." 
His 1968 football season ended after one scrimmage play, Capers was forced to make news some other way. He did that very well. 
Tony Capers is Notre Dame's most controversial athlete-black, white or chartreuse. And, save Don Hynes, he may be the University's most contro­versial student. 
He also is more completely black than any Notre Dame athlete ever has been. "They say that only a certain type of Negro comes to Notre Dame," says Capers. "Well, if that's true, it sure blew up in their faces when they got me." 
Capers lived the first seven years of his life in Mississippi, before moving to Eastern Ohio. His father had a good job at neither place. There were three children. Some meals they didn't all eat. During junior high school, some­one stabbed Capers in the back and nearly killed him. It was all part of the ghetto. 
And now it is all part of Tony Capers' make-up. He describes it this way: 
"There's no other black athlete here who's been through the environmental situations I've been through. It's part of me. You can't erase it. The rest of these guys lived nearly middle-class. They're not outspoken enough. They're all afraid of what might hap­pen, of what the man might say. They have to get B's and play ball and get through school. 
"It's not like that with me. If I deserve an F, I'll get it and that's the way I want it." 
, There's something else Tony wants-a black football coach. 
"We need more black of everything here, but especially a black football coach. It would relieve tension and there's a lot of tension out there. A black man could counsel us, tell us why we're playing a certain position and not somewhere else. 
"We do have a very good working relationship between black athletes and coaches now. But if you have a bad practice, you can't go to a white coach and say, 'Coach, my mind just wasn't' on football tdday_ I got a letter from my mother yesterday and she said my little, three-year-old brother doesn't have any shoes. We can't afford them.' You just can't say that to a white coach. He won't understand what you're talking about." · 
Capers' conversation on black topics is extremely intelligent. He freely quotes LeRoi Jones, Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammed. He advocates Black Power, as understood thus: "Black men doing things for themselves in a constructive manner." 
Within that definition there is room for "every man to do his thing to help the black cause," Tony says. I'm work­ing with the Urban League and the Negro Industrial Economic Union (which loans money interest-free to blacks and helps them establish busi­nesses). I have a speaking engagement later this month at a church down­town. I have my radio show (8-1 0 pm weekdays on WNDU) and next year I might be on television doing a sports show, too. 
"Everybody's got his bag. Mine's talking. Man, I could sit here and 'rap' for hours. I have a responsibility to make my people aware of their man­ness, their woman-ness, of their pride." 
Black pride. It is a relatively new concept. A few years ago, the soul radio stations were advertising hair straightener for $1.39. No..y it's Afro­wigs or "naturals" for $29.95. Five years ago, the songs were not "Black is beautiful" or "I'm black and I'm proud."

Sam hangs it up 

NEW YORK (UP!) -Sam Jones, putting in his last season with the Boston Celtics, says he worked for "a pair of dictators." 
What's more, he's glad of it. And what's even more than that, he's not so sure they haven't turned him into one. 
Red Auerbach, who used to coach the Celtics, and Bill Russell, who does now, are the two dictators and when Sam Jones calls them that he makes sure you know he's doing it affectionately. 
Since Sam Jones joined the Celtics 12 years ago, they've won 10 National Basketball Association titles and the one man most responsible for that, he says, is Auerbach, now executive vice-president and general manager of the team. 
"Coach Auerbach," says Jones, still using that designation from long habit, "had to handle 12

ago, the Negro felt he had to make himself equal to whites, that he had to be the same. Now, the blacks got their thing together." 
, Austin Carr: "It used to be that if you were from one street in a Negro section, you didn't go over to another street or you'd get cut up. Now when I go home, nobody says, 'Hey man, what street you from?' Everybody's together now." 
It is this black pride that Capers exudes like few others. He recalls, "It used to be 'Whitey's World' and a black man had to sell out his race if he wanted to be a part of it. I'm not bitter toward the white man and I don't advocate militant tactics for blacks. I walk around this campus with my head up 'cause I'm proud to be black. I know that's controversial, but I don't mind. There's something wrong if everybody likes you. If somebody wants to call me a 'black bastard' because of my beliefs, that's okay. But they better not say it to my face." 
minutes and then I have to come outta the game. 
Years ago I could go nine minutes." When Sam Jones leaves the Celtics, they will be little poorer off without him even though he 
doesn't pretend to be the Sam Jones of five years ago. He has done some great things on the court and some even greater things off it. Like digging into his own pocket and coming up with $1,200 so that Jimmy Walker, now with the Detroit Pistons, could attend a decent prep school. 

Sam Jones never told about that deed in the first place and it even embarrasses him now when someone talks about it. 
He'd much rather talk about his time with the Celtics. 
"I feel I've had a wonderful 12 years with them," he says. "I've been on I 0 championship teams and I feel a little sorry for those who have never been on even one. Take the Baylors and the Robinsons. They never had the chance I had.'' 
You have to say one thing about Sam Jones. He made the most of his chance. Not bad for a guy who was being yelled at all the time.

different personalities and no one did it better. He was a dictator but what he said went and we never had any dissension." 
Russell, in his third season as coach of the Celtics and still playing, is a great deal like Auerbach, according to Jones, yet different. 
"Both have the same type dedication," says the Celtics' veteran backcourt man, "but use different approaches. Bill understands his ballplayers completely. There are some you can holler at and some you have to talk low to. He knows which is which." 
"How does Bill Russell talk to you? " a guy interrupted and asked Sam Jones. 
"Loud and mean," laughed Jones. ''I'm one of the players he can holler at. We're very good friends and he's been very helpful to me over the years." 
When this season is over,· the articulate, 35-year-old Jones will say goodbye to pro ball and get some taste of what Auerbach and Russell have put up with when he takes over as head basketball coach and athletic director at Federal City College in Washington, D.C. Speaking of that, he laughs some more and says: 
"We, the Celtics, hate Red and Bill at times ~nd now I guess the kids will hate me.'' 
Sam Jones doesri't laugh though when he says he believes the Celtics can still go on to their II th NBA championship even though they're languishing in fourth place in the league's eastern 
division and haven't finished  this far back in the  
past I 5 years.  
"I  still  think  we  have  a  chance  to  win  the  

championship," he says. "Remember when we were down to Philadelphia, three games to one, in last year's playoffs? We came back to win. I think we can do it again. We may get lucky." 
Okay, then what's been holding Boston back? What's the problem? "I don't think we have any great problem," says Jones. 
"It's just that our bench isn't as strong as it used to be. We lost Wayne Embry in expansion and it hurts. He was a fine back-up man for Bill Russell. He'd give Bill a rest. The man has gotta be a little tired. I'm talking about Bill Russell. He had a birthday this month and turned 35. I don't have to watch him to know how he feels. All I have to do is ask Sam Jones. I'll be 36 in June so I know how Bill Russell feels. He's a fellow who generally plays 48 minutes. If I go all out, I can go a good six
