CCAC: Community, University relations have improved 
Leaders discuss off-campus housing, taxi cab reform, alcohol awareness at first meeting held on campus

News Writer 
Student leaders, University officials and community mem­bers discussed issues regard­ing off-campus housing at the Community Campus Advisory Coalition (CCAC) meeting, which took place on campus for the first time Thursday afternoon. 
Several group members said the relationship between off­campus students and their neighbors has improved over­all. 
"It's been the best year in a long, long time. I'm very pleased," Matt Costello, a South Bend resident, said. "There were a couple of big parties on St. Patrick's Day, but they were shut down right after dinner. By the time the little kids were ready for bed, there wasn't a peep out of 
anybody  in  the  neighbor­ 
hood."  
Mark  Kramer,  owner  of  

Kramer Properties, a housing company in the South Bend area, said he has been taking a more proactive approach to parties. 
"What we do before the major events [is] we send a mass e-mail out to all of the students reminding them of their neighbors," Kramer said. 
Kramer said he has also hired three off-duty police officers who have gone around to talk to students prior to major events, and the students "knowing that the presence is there" has made a difference.

In an effort to "build rela­tionships, partnerships and fellowship" with the South Bend community, Notre Dame students will collabo­rate with community mem­bers through Notre Dame's first annual CommUniversity Day, which will offer more than 20 service projects on and off campus throughout the day. 
"The idea for the day is one body, many gifts," Michelle Byrne, outgoing 
chair for the Social Concerns Committee, said. "No matter what your talent, there is 
definitely  a  way  you  can  
serve your community."  
The  inspiration  for

INSIDE CoLUMN 
Tree Sitting 

Good morning. I hope things are well. Allow me to begin by saying that I'm not quite sure how I arrived here. Although I've been an employee (photography) 
of The  
Observer for  Zhlbin Dai  
the last year,  
and a casual  Photographer  
consumer of  
it for the last  

four, I've hardly ever read an inside column. As a photographer I haven't been doing much writ­ing period. 
I'm not complaining though, because I volunteered for this. Writing, after all, is romantic and cool; and if there's one regret I have about my college experience -actually there are many, this is purely hypothetical -it's not working harder to score chicks. 
Anyway here's a story. Last Friday night was unquestionably . the craziest night of my life. While other people were off get­ting drunk, hooking up and doing typical bourgeois activities, I summoned my latent courage and newfound faith in ropes and carabiners to participate in a tree-sit. For those who are unaware, tree-sitting, as defined by Wikipedia, is a form of civil disobedience in which a protester sits in a tree to prevent it from being cut down. My partner and I are making a documentary about tree-sitting and it was imperative that we capture the reality of the situation, to examine the lived experience. Thus we climbed up the tree and spent the night 90 feet above the ground, suspended on large branches and webs of rope. It was quite an experience. Did I mention I'm afraid of heights? I am. Did I also mention that my rope lost tension and got stuck on the way down? It did. 
Again, it was quite an experi­ence. Although some of my inter­actions with the real tree-sitters were awkward, it was extremely refreshing to be around and engage people whose lives seem completely different and alien to your own. Because once you talk to them and get to know them, you realize that on a fundamental level, we're all the same. 
In the subsequent days I've reflected on my tree-sitting expe­rience, particularly whether it will have a lasting impact on me or simply devolve into a fleeting memory, a singular isolated adventure. 
On some level, my tree-sitting experience is similar to my time at Notre Dame. Like many sen­iors, I've thought about my col­lege experience and what it all ultimately adds up to. I've had a good time in college. For the most part, it's been fun and rewarding. But right now I am not sure what it all adds up to, if anything. 
Maybe nothing. Maybe it's too soon. One thing I do know, it's weird and depressing to think about. Writing about it isn't much fun either. So I'm going to stop doing both.

Animal-rights activist buys cow headed for slaughter 
HUTCHINSON, Kan.-A dairy cow was headed for the slaughterhouse until an animal-rights activist bought her after the Brown Jersey made a run for it. Farmer Calvin Nisly was taking the 5-year-old cow named Linda to a sale barn Tuesday and had stopped at a veterinarian's office to be sure she was­n't pregnant. On the way back to the trailer, an annoyed Linda escaped through a fence and led Nisly and several law enforcement vehicles on a chase.

Evolutionists speak about religion, faith 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY 
Saint Mary's Editor 
Panelists said human beings ask questions regarding evolu­tion that science cannot answer at the opening of Quest Project in the Little Theater Thursday. 
"Well it's not necessary with­in science, but scientists are not just scientists, they are human beings and they ask questions that go beyond what their science can answer," Joseph Bracken, a retired pro­fessor of Theology, said. 
Four evolutionists discussed religion and faith during a panel, opening this year's Quest Project, exploring the science and religion interface. 
The panel included the per­spective of speakers from sev­eral colleges and universities and a variety of academic disci­plines on the relationship between evolution and religion. 
Bracken said Charles Darwin, author of the "Origin of Species," was originally a divinity student, and he became a reluctant agnostic because he didn't want to attribute the cruelty of natural selection to God. 
"Natural selection is cruel. There are at least as many dead ends as successes," Bracken said. 
Saint Mary's Psychology pro­fessor Thomas Parisi also addressed this question by say­ing human beings need organi­zation in their faith, and that is the need of religion. 
"People who are doing rich anthropological exploration, there is a rigid persistent gravi­tation toward the need to structure with which to express reverence and structure, so it's not just neediness," Parisi said. 
Molly Duman Scheel, evolu­tionary development biologist at Notre Dame, added that she believes God was the creator of evolution. 
"If you look at a need to put anything in motion, I would put him there," Scheel said. 
Scheel addressed the com­mon issue with evolutionists of the randomness of natural selection and the existence of mutations that often cause dis­pute between the religious and the evolutionists. She said mutation is the reason there is a diversity of organisms on the earth. 
"Yes, sometimes things go wrong, but if you view muta­tions as something that after selection, that something is going to continue after that process, then what you end up with is that life has existed," Scheel said. "What more beau­tiful thing for a creator to put into his creation than the insurance that life will go on?" 
Hagerty presented the story of Genesis and asked if evolu­tion theory is fact, how can religious philosophers believe in both that story of creation and the notion of natural selec­tion? 
Bracken pointed out that the "only strictly empirical thing about Christianity that is beyond question of any doubt is original sin." 
However, he said he believes the story of creation is not as strict a belief. 
"Now the story accounting for original sin is another mat­ter. There is no reason why you need to take it as historical truth," Bracken said. "It could be a religious myth, a symbolic story that has a theological point not a historical point." 
Hagerty also asked if the panelists saw the universal cre­ator as having a purpose, for example, human life. 
Mary Gerhart, professor in the areas of interpretation the­ory, theology and gender stud­ies at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, made the point that to call God an intelligent designer would leave God in "a position of great boredom." 
"Surprises have to happen along the way, or else you get bored," Gerhart said. 
The Quest Project will contin­ue with various lectures that further explore the relationship between religion and science.

Along with these students from other uni­versities, Notre Dame faculty members and students are also expected to attend. 
"There will be people from all over the world at the con­ference," Richardson said. 
The theme of this year's Peace Conference, as select­ed by the students who planned it, will be "Perspectives on Peace." 
Richardson said they chose this theme because it encom­passes a wide variety of top­ics. 
"This broad of a theme allows for several different issues to be discussed," Richardson said. "Some of these will be institutional views and others will be per­sonal experiences." 
The conference will begin on Friday evening with a din­ner followed by a keynote address from Lisa Schirch, a professor at Eastern Mennonite University. 
Saturday, the conference will switch gears and include a variety of panel discussions on peace-related topics.

Masak said he hopes for a wide variety of conversation in relation to the chosen top­ics. 
"We have students speaking who have gone to other coun­tries where peace-related issues are important, as well as students who have done research only at the library," Masak said. "We want to embrace all different aspects." 
The moderators for these panels are graduate students at Notre Dame in the process of earning a degree in Peace Studies. 
The Student Peace Conference is an annual con­ference that has been taking place for more than 20 years. It has always been complete­ly student-run, with organiz­ers undertaking tasks that run the gamut.

continued from page 1 

"To me, Dance Marathon means just giving up one night of your time to help a little kid who would give anything to be out of a hospital bed and danc­ing all night long," Dance Marathon president Sarah Voss said. 
But the marathon isn't just about dancing. Participants will have the opportunity to play games, or even just watch. 
"The event isn't primarily focused on dancing. The idea of the night is to stay on your feet for 12 hours," Voss said. "It doesn't matter if you dance or if you just want to watch or if you just want to participate in the board games, or jumping in the bounce house. There's plenty of things to do besides dance. But the main idea is that you just keep moving for the kids at Riley." 
Dance Marathon will host families who were impacted from Riley Hospital to speak to the crowd, and there will be a multitude of activities for the kids and dancers to do. 
"We'll have rock climbing, a bounce house. We will have 'learning the morale' line dance. We will have stories from Riley families; hopefully a few Riley doctors will be there. We will have crafts, and games," Voss said. ''We have a ton of different games. I heard there's going to be a Fear Factor challenge, and so we have a lot going on. You'll have to come and find out all there's going to be." 
Although the event already has about 280 registered partic­ipants, everyone is invited to attend. 
"Students can register starting at 7:15 in the Saint Mary's Dining Hall in the Student Center on Friday," Voss said. "We'll have registration starting in the west wing, and they can still come and participate." 
Voss said dancing at the marathon is not the only way to help. Donations are always accepted at the Dance Marathon Web site, www.smcdm.org. 
"Anyone can donate there," she said. "If you want to donate to commemorate a certain dancer, you can put their name in the comment section so they know you donated in their name." 
This is the fourth year Saint Mary's has offered Dance Marathon. The event is recog­nized across the United States. 
"This year Dance Marathon won the Incentive Award, which is the award that designated Saint Mary's as the model Dance Marathon for the entire United States. Which is a huge honor because there are over 100 dance marathons in the coun­try," Voss said. "Just a week or so ago, some of our girls trav­eled to Orlando. Fla. and went to Disney World and met 50 Riley champions, from each of the 50 states that represent their hospitals. So that was a big honor." 
"Our motto is: 'we dance because we can, we dance for those who can't,"' Voss said.

sometimes two-person, per­formed monologues. 
The Monologues were not writ­ten by the actresses themselves, but from anonymous female con­tributors from the South Bend community. 
They featured stories about women's lives and the experi­ences that have shaped them. The Monologues voiced women's thoughts, feelings, opinions and reactions regarding a variety of issues. 
Some of the performances were humorous, like "Feminine about rape were performed, one in which the character says to her rapist, "[you] shattered the notion that the world is a safe place. 
There were other pieces about gynecological appointments and vasectomies, as well as middle school sex education and "emn­ing out." 
Megan Smith said that she became involved with the mono­logues after her Gender 100 class at JUSB. Iler professor was involved in the Michiana Monologues and persuaded stu­dents to partake. 
At one point while reading the "Vagina Monologues," Megan said, "it clicked with me, this is why women are angry and why their voices need to be heard." 
She said she enjoyed being a part of the Monologues because "it is an area where women sup­port each other." 
"[We] are too often pitted against one another," she said. 
Saint Mary's students that were in the audience appreciat­ed the opportunity to "break out of our bubble" of the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame eampus­es, sophomore Annie Malloy said. 

"The Saint Mary's and South Bend Monologues were very dif­ferent experiences. College women have a limited view of the world compared to women who are older than us. We don't have the same experiences so it's interesting to have that balance and have the stories of women of different generations," Malloy said. 
The closing number for the Monologues was performed by Saint Mary's sophomore Hannahbeth Fischer. She deliv­ered the piece ''I'm the Girl," about the struggles and triumphs of having a significant other in the military. During her closing lines, the cast systematically rose from their chairs and formed a line at the front of the stage. 
"I liked the way they all joined me like we were all united. It was a powerful feeling to feel them stand behind me as sup­port," Fisher said.

Afghan law legalizes rape 
KABUL -A new Afghan law makes it legal for men to rape their wives, human rights groups and some Afghan lawmakers said Thursday, accusing President Hamid Karzai of signing the legislation to bolster his re-election prospects. 
Critics worry the legislation undermines hard-won rights for women enacted after the fall of the Taliban's strict Islamist regime. 
The law -which some lawmakers say was never debated in parliament -is intended to regulate family life inside Afghanistan's Shiite community, which makes up about 20 percent of this country of 30 million people. The law does not affect Afghan Sunnis. 
Israeli teenager killed with pickax 
JBAT AYIN, West Bank -A Palestinian killed an Israeli teenager with a pickax and seriously injured a 7-yearcold boy in a ram­page through this West Bank Jewish settle­ment Thursday, posing an early test for the country's new hard-line government. 
Israeli media broadcast pictures of the body of 13-year-old Shlomo N ativ, bespecta­cled with long sidecurls and a large skullcap worn by observant Jews. The images also showed the red pickax on the ground with drops of blood splattered on a road. 
The attacker escaped the scene and Israeli troops, joined by bearded settlers armed with automatic rifles, were conduct­ing a manhunt in the area. In the nearby Palestinian village of Safa, troops searched houses and rounded up residents in a schoolyard. The military said all roads around the settlement of Bat Ayin were closed.

A federal grand jury handed down the 19­count indictment against Blagojevich, his brother, two former aides and two business­men on Thursday. It accuses Blagojevich of corruption involving billions of dollars in state pension bonds. 
FBI agents arrested the Chicago Democrat in December on allegations that also include trying to auction off President Barack Obama's vacant U.S. Senate seat.

NEW BEDFORD, Mass. -A man who raped a 6-year-old boy in a public library, while on probation for an attempted rape, was sen­tenced Thursday to life in prison. 
Corey Deen Saunders pleaded guilty in February to the January 2008 rape of the boy at the New Bedford Public Library. 
Prosecutors said Saunders lured the boy into a reading room at the library while the vic­tim's mother worked on a computer only a few feet away. At the time of the attack, Saunders was a convicted sex offender who was on pro­bation after serving four years in prison for the attempted rape of a 7 -year-old boy.

New storms terrorize the Southeast 
Another onslaught creates additional problems, causes train collision 
Associated Press 
JACKSON, Miss. -Another barrage of storms hit the southeast Thursday, causing a collision between a passenger train and a tree and sending at least one person to the hos­pital after lightning struck a home. 
Flood warnings as well as tornado watches and warn­ings were in effect around the region. 
In south Mississippi, an Amtrak train hit a tree the storm knocked onto the tracks south of McComb in Pike County, injuring the con­ductor, said Carlene Statham, assistant director of Pike County Civil Defense.

him, alcohol awareness is a main concern, and said it needs to happen early in the school year. 
Kirsits suggested creating a video to post on the new off­campus Web site -which is currently in development stages -that would talk "about tragic consequences that happen when you make silly mistakes" in order to raise alcohol awareness. 
Michael Carrington, a repre­sentative from the Alcoholic Beverage Board, said students will continue to throw parties "if they know they can party and raise hell all night" with­out repercussions. 
"The new people coming in need to understand what the expectation is," Carrington said. "And then you have to demonstrate that you are going to enforce it early in the year." 
Student body president Grant Schmidt, who partici­pated in the CCAC meeting for the first time since taking office, said iTunes V would be a venue for student leaders, athletes and other officials to promote alcohol awareness. 
The group also discussed the legal number of students living in one off-campus home. 
"There are certain areas where you can't have more than two unrelated parties [living in the same unit], whether students or not stu­dents," Kramer said. "Some ... homes are grandfathered so that you can have multiple students." 
Kramer also said it had been brought to his attention that Irish Row and The

Foundry Lofts and Apartments at Eddy Street Commons are renting apartments to more than two unrelated people, which may be in violation of zoning agreements. 
''I'm not calling around to find out who's loading up their apartments," Kramer said. ''I'm doing my job as a businessman to stay competi­tive. I stumbled upon this." 
Kirsits said the South Bend Common Council had not been aware of this. He said the Council will look at the min-had agreed to zoning, and confirm whether or not this was in violation. 
Kirsits also addressed taxi reform, a principal component of Schmidt's platform as stu­dent body president. 
Kirsits said he plans to work with Schmidt to better regu­late taxi cabs and approach the Council president "to get a bit of a grip on the licensing requirements and regulations for the taxi cabs." 
"That's my pledge to you. It will be an ongoing process," Kirsits said. "It will involve a lot of players, but there needs to be some regulations on that." 
Northeast neighborhood res­ident Marguerite Taylor expressed an interest in increasing the interaction between community members and the student government off-campus president, because prior to last week's Community Summit meeting, she had not been aware Notre Dame had such a position. 
"As community people, we didn't even know that that person even existed, and we'd like to work with him more closely," she said. 
Other issues discussed at the meeting include student safety and the upcoming CommUniversity Day, which will take place Saturday. 
Carrington said he is grate­ful for the increasingly posi­tive role the University has played in the community and for the work that CCAC has done to improve the relation­ship between the community and the University. 
This relationship between the University and the com­munity is "a wonderful, won­derful thing and we need to continue to cherish it and nourish it," Carrington said. 
Kirsits echoed his senti­ments. 
"When people say, 'tell me something good about the city,' I always say 'well, let's start with the universities that we have here."' 
The next CCAC meeting is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, June 2 at the Robinson Community Learning Center.

IN BRIEF 
Greenberg criticizes AIG bailout 
WASHINGTON -The man who built insur­ance giant American International Group Inc. from a startup to a global behemoth said he did­n't mismanage the company -but the govern­ment did. 
Following weeks of public and congressional outrage over ·largest corporate failure in U.S. history, Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, AIG's chief executive until March 2005, said taxpayers got a raw deal in the largest bailout of the financial crisis. 
In his first testimony since the government stepped in with the first of four bailouts for AIG, Greenberg told the House Oversight and Government Heform Committee Thursday that his leadership team had "nothing to do" with failures that so far have cost taxpayers more than $182 billion. 
But he spread blame generously across virtu­ally every other party involved in the company and its rescue -including subsequent manage­ment. federal regulators and ratings agencies. 
FDA approves tobacco regulation 
WASHINGTON -Anti-smoking forces won a long-awaited victory Thursday as the House passed legislation that would give the federal government key controls over the tobacco industry for the first time. 
The measure, passed 298-112, gives the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate -but not ban -cigarettes and other tobacco products. 
The Senate could take up its version of the bill later this month, and supporters are confident they can overcome opposition from tobacco­state senators. The White House supports the legislation. a shift from the Bush administration which threatened to veto a House-passed meas­ure last year. 
President Barack Obama has spoken publicly about his own struggles to kick a smoking habit. 
"This is truly a historic day in the fight against tobacco, and I am proud that we have taken such decisive action," said Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman, D-Calif., the bill's sponsor. "Today we have moved to place the regulation of tobacco under FDA in order to protect the public health, and now we all can breathe a little easier." 
Summit brings setbacks for Obama 
World financial powers approve big loans, no economic rescue stimulus 
Associated Press 
LONDON -Concluding his first international summit, President Barack Obama hailed agreements at the emergency meeting of world powers Thursday as a "turn­ing point in our pursuit of global economic recovery." But he cautioned, "There are no guarantees." 
The new U.S. leader said the heads of industrial mun­tries that met in London agreed on "unprecedented steps to restore growth and prevent a crisis like thi<> from happening again." 
He spoke shortly after G-20 leaders pledged an additional $1.1 trillion in financing to the International Monetary Fund and other global institu­tions and declared a crack­down on tax havens and hedge funds. The leaders announced the creation of a supervisory body to flag problems in the global finan­cial system-but did not sat­isfy calls from the U.S. and others for new stimulus measures. 
Despite that failure, Obama called the one-day London gathering "very productive" and historic because of the scope of the challenges the world faces in righting the economic crisis that's wreak­ing havoc on virtually every country.

Market extends a four-week rally 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Investors dove into stocks Thursday, extending a rally that gave the Dow Jones industrial average its best four weeks since 1933. 
Stocks rose across the board in heavy trading following an accounting rule change that will help banks pare their losses and after commitments from world leaders to toughen regula­tory oversight of financial institutions. 
The Dow broke through 8,000 for the first time since Feb. 9 but ended slightly below that level ahead of the government's employment report Friday that could easily upset the market if it comes in below forecasts -or send prices rocketing higher if it's better than expected. 
The Dow is now up 20.4 percent over the last month, its biggest per­centage gain in a four-week period since the spring of 1933. Bits of good news about the economy in recent weeks, including better-than expect­ed-numbers on housing and manufac­turing, have given investors more rea­sons to buy. 
The Dow gained 216.48, or 2.8 per­cent, to close at 7,978.08, after earlier rising as much as 314 points. 
"People are worried about this (employment) report. so the last hour we sold off," said Richard Campagna, managing director and chief invest­ment officer of Pasadena, Calif.-based investment manager 300 North Capital. 
Broader market indicators also rose sharply. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 23.30, or 2.9 percent, to 
834.38. The Nasdaq composite index rose 51.03. or 3.3 percent, to 1,602.63. 
Industrial and consumer discre­
tionary stocks picked up speed Thursday while demand for safe­haven assets like gold and Treasurys plummeted. 
"Everyone is in a buying mood," said Eric Ross, director of research at brokerage Canaccord Adams. "Everyone is feeling good .... A lot of this is simply confidence." 
The market has managed to shrug off some negative data on employment recently such as initial claims for job· less benefits. But a surprisingly bad report on the March job market could easily stifle the market's growing opti· mism. Economists predict the report will show a loss of 654,000 jobs fol­lowing a drop of 651,000 jobs in February, which was a record third straight month of job losses above 600,000. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 8.5 percent from 
8.1 percent in February.

WEST BANK 
Israeli teenager killed with pick-ax 
Associated Press 
BAT AYIN -A Palestinian killed an Israeli teenager with a pickax and seriously injured a 7-year-old boy in a rampage through this West Bank Jewish settlement Thursday, posing an early test for the country's new hard-line government. 
Israeli media broadcast pictures of the body of 13­year-old Shlomo Nativ, bespectacled with long side­curls and a large skullcap worn by observant Jews. The images also showed the red pickax on the ground with drops of blood splattered on a road. 
The attacker escaped the scene and Israeli troops, joined by bearded settlers armed with automatic rifles, were conducting a manhunt in the area. In the nearby Palestinian village of Safa, troops searched houses and rounded up residents in a schoolyard. The military said all roads around the settle­ment of Bat Ayin were closed. 
The settlement is notorious in Israel for being the base of the so-called "Bat Ayin Underground," whose mem­bers were arrested over a botched 2002 bombing on an Arab girls' school in Jerusalem. The wounded boy's father, a member of the underground, is currently serving a 15-year sentence for his involvement in that bombing attempt. 
Avinoam Mayman, a 45­year-old resident of the extremist settlement, said he tried to stop the assailant after the attack, violently struggling with him for a minute or two. 
"He tried to kill me. I grabbed his hand and took the ax and he escaped," he told The Associated Press. 
He said the attacker fled to a neighboring "murderous village." 
The attacker apparently entered Bat Ayin, lac a ted between Jerusalem and the southern West Bank city of Hebron, unhindered. The religious settlers have refused to build a security fence around their communi­ty -standard practice in most settlements -saying it would be a sign of weakness. 
The teenager was quickly buried at a funeral Thursday afternoon, which was closed to the media at the family's request. 
The attack came a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office and will likely height­en tensions with the Palestinians. The leader of the hawkish Likud party has promised a firm hand against militants and low­ered expectations on the prospects for peace. 
Government spokesman 
Mark Regev called it a "senseless act of brutality against innocents" and warned the new leadership will have a "zero tolerance policy" toward militants. 
A murky Palestinian mili­tant group calling itself the Martyrs of Imad Mughniyeh claimed responsibility for the attack in an e-mail sent to the AP. 
The group is named for a Hezbollah mastermind killed in Syria last year in what is believed to have been an assassination by Israeli intel­ligence. It has claimed a number of past attacks, but Israeli defense officials believe it is likely a name used by other groups to avoid Israeli reprisals. 
The e-mail said the mili­tant group Islamic Jihad was also involved. The group's spokesman in Gaza would not comment. 
The new government has already voiced skepticism about peace negotiations in its first days in office. 
"The Palestinian leadership must both in word and in deed too have a zero toler­ance policy to this sort of attack to demonstrate its commitment to peace and reconciliation," said Regev, the government spokesman. 
Netanyahu was elected on a campaign that criticized the previous government's peace negotiations with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Since then, Netanyahu has said he will seek peace, but has given few details about his vision for a final agreement. He has specifically refused to endorse the idea of an inde­pendent Palestinian state ­a key demand of the Palestinians and centerpiece 
of U.S. diplomacy  in  the  
region.  
On  Wednesday,  

Netanyahu's ultranationalist foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said Israeli con­cessions to the Palestinians would only invite more war. He also rejected the previous government's peace talks, launched at a U.S.-sponsored conference in 2007. 
Netanyahu has not com­mented publicly on Lieberman's statements. But a close Netanyahu ally, Cabinet minister Gilad Erdan, said Thursday that Lieberman's comments largely reflected the position of the prime minister's Likud Party. 
The appointment of the Lieberman has angered Palestinians and raised international concerns because of his hard-line positions on peace and an election campaign that was widely seen as racist. 
In Cairo, Egypt's Foreign Ministry called Lieberman's remarks "a setback to peace efforts."

cohesive day," Byrne said. 
"We wanted to help improve community rela­tions, but we didn't think our efforts have been as robust and cohesive as they could be," she said. 
Beginning Saturday morn­ing at 9 a.m., students are invited to a kickoff break­fast in the library auditori­um, where they can pick up a T-shirt and a light break­fast before starting their 
projects.  Fr. Joe Carey,  
assistant  director  of  
Campus  Ministry  for  
Religious  Education  and  

Retreats, will speak to the students before the service projects begin. 
"Fr. Joe Carey is involved in Campus Ministry, [Notre Dame Encounter] retreats and he is well-loved here at Notre Dame," Byrne said. "He will speak to the stu­dents to help get people excited about the day." 
With a wide variety of service projects off campus, in addition to dorm events on campus, Byrne said stu­dent government, along with the Center for Social Concern's (CSC) Canned Food Drive, hopes to get as many students and commu­nity members involved as possible. 
Some of the off-campus projects include park clean­ups, mural painting, scav­enger hunts with local stu­dents, Habitat for Humanity 

housework, cleaning up the zoo and volunteering at nursing homes, she said. 
In addition, students can contribute on campus, with Knott's Angel for a Day, Pasquerilla West's Project Paint, and the CSC's annual 
Canned Food Drive.  ·  
While service is  an  inte­ 
gral  part  of  

CommUniversity, Byrne also emphasized the importance of helping the community feel comfortable here at Notre Dame. Community members are invited to visit Notre Dame for campus tours, Easter egg hunts for children and technology tutoring for senior citizens as well as making available facilities like the Joyce Center and the -Suite Museum for visitors. 
"We want to emphasize that this is not a service day; it is about building partnerships, fellowships, relationships and mutuali­ty," Byrne said. "We want the comm.unity to feel wel­come here at Notre Dame." 
The day will culminate at the Robinson Learning Center from 4-7 p.m., where students and the community are invited to a "block party," with food, entertain­ment and speakers, includ­ing Jan Botz, vice president of the Office of Public Affairs and Communication, Ann Puzzello, vice president of the South Bend Common Council and several student government members. 
Byrne said the turnout for the event has been success­ful, with more than 600 stu­dents registered for service projects. 
Students can register online at studentgovern­ment.nd.edu up until Friday, and the first 1,000 students will receive a free T-shirt. Students may also register the day of the event to participate in a project on or off campus, she said. 
Additionally, many of the athletic teams will be par­ticipating in service projects throughout the day, con­tributing to the unified day of service and collaboration with the community. 
Because of the support from the student body and South Bend community for the first annual CommUniversity Day, the new Social Concerns Committee chair, Rachel Roseberry, said she is opti­mistic about the future of this event. 
"Absolutely we hope this becomes an annual event," she said. "We hope to make it bigger and involve more students and community members." 
The expectation is that the Notre Dame and South Bend community will become familiar with the catchphrase, CommUniversity, and the event will grow with each year, Roseberry said. 
"The question won't be are you participating, but rather which project are you doing," Byrne said. "It will be the thing to do."

Sal111onella proble111s spread to pistachios 
Two million pounds of nuts recalled Thursday 
Associated Press 
COMMACK, N.Y.-The investi­gation into a nationwide salmo­nella scare over pistachio nuts has spread from a California nut processor to its sister plant in New York, where inspectors last month found cockroaches and rodent droppings. 
The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday it was investigating Commack­based Setton International Foods Inc., which shares key staff and packages food with a plant in central California that earlier this week recalled 2 million pounds of nuts over fears of possible sal­monella contamination. 
Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella Inc. is the nation's second-largest pistachio processor. A spokesman for both companies said the California plant supplies all pistachios used in the Long Island processing facility, which makes chocolate-and yogurt­covered nuts and dried fruit. 
Last month, New York agricul­tural authorities discovered nearly two dozen dead cock­roaches, rodent droppings and one live cockroach on an ingredi­ent rolling rack inside the Commack plant. It failed its state health inspection. 
Production Manager Lee Cohen said Thursday the plant is now spotless and the problems ­completely unrelated to the recall over salmonella concerns -were fixed immediately. The facility, which is among the 36 wholesalers that got nuts from the California operation, plans to recall some of its nuts and trail mix voluntarily in the coming weeks, he said. 
"Our facility in New York is beautiful and clean. You can eat off the ground it is so spotless," Cohen said in an interview with The Associated Press. "We took actions immediately to respond once we heard there was a prob­lem, and have been responsible from the beginning." 
State inspectors went back for a visit Wednesday to swab the plant and take food samples to be tested for salmonella and other pathogens as part of the pistachio recall, said Jessica Chittenden, a spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Agriculture & Markets. The test results are pending. 
"Right now nothing is moving out of that plant. They're holding all products with pistachios in them," Chittenden said. "When we were in there yesterday to collect samples, they were coop­erative, and we observed that they are working on the issues that we had outlined in our last inspection." 
Chittenden said she was told federal inspectors also had visit­ed the plant this week. The FDA said the agency was "investigat­ing all aspects of the company's operations" but could not dis­close details. 
The two companies share a CEO, Joshua Setton, and label foods with both plants' names, FDA spokesman Mike Herndon said. 
During a tour of the sprawling factory Thursday, a company consultant told the AP that pista­chios are being kept separate from Setton's other products until the FDA advises the firm how to proceed. 
Thousands of boxes of pista­chios were wrapped in plastic, placed on pallets, stacked to the ceiling and cordoned off from the rest of the warehouse with yel­low police tape. Roasting machines and polished stainless steel equipment appeared clean, and visitors were required to wear hair nets. 
William Schwemer, a retired FDA investigator hired as a con­sultant, said there were no exposed food products in the room where mouse droppings were found last month. 
So far, there have been no con­firmed reports of illness linked to the recalled nuts. 
Still, federal health officials warned people this week to avoid eating all pistachios and products containing them while the gov­ernment determines what foods could be tainted. 
In the meantime, a range of products from nut bars to ice cream and cake mixes remain in limbo on grocery shelves, and the number of recalled products continues to grow. 
Setton International Foods has not issued its own recall, Chittenden said. 
Kraft Foods Inc. first alerted the FDA to the contamination after its manufacturer in Skokie, Ill., turned up salmonella in a routine test of roasted pistachios that workers planned to add to trail mix. 
Private auditors hired by Kraft found problems they think caused the contamination when they traveled to Setton Pistachio's processing facility in Terra Bella, a remote town in California's farm belt. 
Cohen said Tuesday he sus­pected that roasted pistachios at the facility could have been con­taminated by salmonella-tainted raw nuts they were processed with. 
The last time California health inspectors visited the Terra Bella plant, they found no violations that would pose a health threat. 
In April 2008, a California Department of Public Health inspector made note of minor violations, such as insulation hanging over some equipment and packaging equipment that was temporarily repaired using tape. 
Neither violation is thought to pose a threat to human health, and the company corrected both a few days later. 
Records obtained by The Associated Press show that the New York plant has passed nine health inspections since 2000, despite receiving some violations for unsanitary conditions. Chittenden called that an "excel­lent history." 
In January 2004, five dead cockroaches were found on the floor of the chocolate mixing room. In January 2007, a state inspector noted that three bins of raw almonds in the roasting area had been left unattended and uncovered while they were not in use. Last month, an inspector spotted something similar: two bins of raw cashews were left out and uncovered in the roasting area. 
The company failed its March inspection because of "critical deficiencies" -including the detection of one live cockroach on an ingredient rolling rack in the chocolate tank. 
The plant was set to get a sec­ond, unannounced inspection in addition to Wednesday's visit, Chittenden said. 
Warnings issued to North Korea 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -As North Korea fueled a multistage rock­et Thursday for its threatened satellite launch, President Barack Obama promised a "stern" response and Japan vowed to press for an emer­gency session of the U.N. Security Council. 
Senior U.S. defense officials said that trailers and vehicles carrying rocket propellant were in place at North Korea's coastal launch site and that fueling had begun. 
A U.S. counter-proliferation official said the fueling process could take "up to a few days." But a senior U.S. intelligence official told The Associated Press that Pyongyang was on track for a projected Saturday launch 
The American officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence issues. 
At the G-20 summit in London, Obama and South Korean President Lee Myung­bak issued a statement agreeing on "a stern, united response from the international commu­nity if North Korea launches a long-range rocket." 
State Department spokesman Hobert Wood would not address the U.S. intelligence reports. But he repeated earlier warnings for the North Koreans not to take any "provocative" actions. 
Japan's ambassador to the 
U.N. said his nation will request an emergency session of the Security Council if North Korea proceeds with the launch. Yukio Takasu said he raised the possi­bility during closed-door council talks Thursday. 
Takasu and other council diplomats say they anticipate a possible emergency session as early as this weekend. 
Chinese President Hu Jintao urged Japan to handle the expected firing of a rocket by North Korea over Japanese ter­ritory calmly, though he says Beijing is working to avert the launch. Hu made the comment in a meeting late Thursday with Japan's prime minister, Taro Aso, on the sidelines of the G20 meeting, said Osamu Sakashita, Aso's deputy cabinet secretary for public relations. 
China says it is trying in vari­ous ways to dissuade Pyongyang from conducting the communi­cations satellite launch that is widely believed to be a test for a long-range missile. 
North Korea heightened its militarist rhetoric toward the U.S., Japan and South Korea on Thursday, threatening retalia­tion for any attempt to shoot down the rocket. Quoting an unidentified North Korean gen­eral, the North Korean Central News Agency said Japan would be struck with a "thunderbolt of fire" if it attempts to intercept the multistage rocket. 
The North Korean news serv­ice also issued a veiled threat against American warships moving in position to monitor the launch, saying: "The United States should immediately with­draw armed forces deployed if it does not want to receive dam­age." 
Some U.S. lawmakers are urg­ing Obama to shoot down the rocket if it endangers the United States or its allies. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said during a weekend 1V interview that the U.S. had no plans to intercept t.he rocket -though it might consider the move if an "aberrant missile" were headed to Hawaii "or something like that." 
U.S. officials have been keep­ing tabs on North Korea's launch preparations with satel­lite imagery and other surveil­lance. North Korea has com­plained that the U.S. is also using high-altitude U-2 spy planes and has warned the air­craft would be shot down. 

North Korea's pre-launch movements are similar to the steps taken in advance of its 2006 firing of a Taepodong-2 missile, the U.S. intelligence offi­cial said. 
The fueling starts an informal pre-launch phase that precedes the formal countdown. 
"You need to launch within a few days because rocket fuel is typically quite corrosive," said Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert at the New America Foundation in Washington, D.C. 
U.S. intelligence analysts con­tinue to believe that North Korea aims to launch a commu­nications satellite rather than conducting a missile test, which would violate a U.N. resolution. However, the rocket launch would yield data directly appli­cable to its long-range ballistic missile program. 
The issue was top of the agen­da Thursday when Obama met with his South Korean counter­part, Lee Myung-bak, on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in London. Obama pledged to push for "peace and stability," while Lee's office issued a statement saying the two leaders agreed to keep working on a verifiable dismantling of North Korea's worrisome nuclear programs. 
Russia appeared to be edging closer to Washington's position in an apparent show of good­will. But a strong united response likely would prove dif­ficult given that China -the North's closest ally -has veto power in the Security Council. Beijing continued to urge all sides to show restraint.

Comparison costs professor his job 
Associated Press 
DENVER -A jury ruled Thursday that the University of Colorado wrongly fired the pro­fessor who compared some Sept. 11 victims to a Nazi, a verdict that gives the professor $1 and a chance to get his job back. 
"What was asked for and what was delivered was jus­tice," Ward Churchill said out­side the courtroom. 
Then-Gov. Bill Owens was among the officials who had called on the university to fire Churchill after his essay touched off a national firestorm, but the tenured pro­fessor of ethnic studies was ulti­mately terminated on charges of research misconduct. 
Churchill said claims includ­ing plagiarism were just a cover and that he never would have been fired if it weren't for the essay in which he called World Trade Center victims "little Eichmanns," a reference to Adolf Eichmann. a Nazi leader who helped orchestrate the Holocaust. Jurors agreed. 
When the verdict was read, Churchill hugged his attorney, David Lane, and his wife, Natsu Saito. 
"I can't tell you how signifi­cant this is," Lane said. "There are few defining moments that give the First Amendment this kind of light." 
A judge will decide whether Churchill gets his job back. Lane said a reinstatement motion would be tiled within 30 days and a hearing would likely be scheduled in June. 
"What's next for me? Reinstatement, of course," Churchill said. "That's what I asked for. I didn't ask for money." 
University spokesman Ken McConnellogue said the univer­sity will review its options before deciding whether to appeal. 
"(The verdict) doesn't change the fact that more than 20 of his faculty peers found that he engaged in plagiarism and other academic misconduct," McConnellogue said. 
He said the jury's $1 damage award sends a message about the merits of Churchill's civil claims. 
Lane said the university will also be liable for hundreds of thousands of dollars in Churchill's legal bills. 
Churchill's essay was written in 2001 but attracted little attention until 2005, when crit­ics publicized it after Churchill was invited to speak at Hamilton College in upstate New York. 
Churchill testified last week that he didn't mean his com­ments to be hurtful to Sept. 11 victims. He said he was arguing that "if you make it a practice of killing other people's babies for personal gain ... eventually they're going to give you a taste of the same thing." 
Betsy Hoffman, who was president of the university at the time, had testified that Owens pressured her to fire Churchill and said he would "unleash my plan" when she told him she couldn't. 
In his testimony, Owens denied threatening the univer­sity. 
University officials concluded that Churchill couldn't be fired over the essay because of his First Amendment rights, but they launched an investigation of his academic research. 
That investigation, which did­n't include the Sept. 11 essay, concluded he had plagiarized, fabricated evidence and com­mitted other misconduct. He was fired on those allegations in 2007. 
The university has main­tained that the firing was justi­fied.

Arctic sea ice Inel ting faster than predicted 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Arctic sea ice is melting so fast most of it could be gone in 30 years. 
A new analysis of changing conditions in the region, using complex computer models of weather and climate, says con­ditions that had been forecast by the end of the century could occur much sooner. 
A change in the amount of ice is important because the white surface reflects sunlight back into space. When ice is replaced by dark ocean water that sunlight can be absorbed, warming the water and increasing the warming of the planet. 
The finding adds to concern about climate change caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, a problem that has begun receiving more attention in the Obama admin­istration and is part of the G20 discussions under way in London. 
"Due to the recent loss of sea ice, the 2005-2008 autumn central Arctic surface air tem­peratures were greater than 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) above" what would be expected, the new study reports. 
That amount of temperature increase had been expected by the year 2070. 
The new report by Muyin Wang of the Joint Institute for the Study of Atmosphere and Ocean and James E. Overland of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, appears in Friday's edition of the journal Geophysical Research Letters. 
They expect the area covered by summer sea ice to decline from about 2.8 million square miles normally to 620,000 square miles within 30 years. 
Last year's summer mini­mum was 1.8 million square miles in September, second lowest only to 2007 which had a minimum of 1.65 million square miles, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.

Countering the Cardinal Newman Society 
So much controversy has swirled around the Notre Dame campus lately, that the finger keeps pointing to the unrest from the Cardinal Newman Society -an advocacy group for more orthodoxy on Catholic college and university campuses. Their staunch stand against abortion rights focuses so tightly on our political process with single-issue political blinders that some ques­tion if they are consistent when the issues turn to war and capital punishment. This week they rise into the new headlines with their rabid opposition to President Obama's invita­tion to deliver the commencement address in May. 
Academic debate is always the strip­per of truth. Therefore, traditional lib­eral Catholics who are tolerant like our first martyrs were needed to create a counter-organization on Catholic cam­puses. Their purpose should be to let Caesar and politics have its place with­out summarily censoring and rejecting a political party or elected official. Our new Catholic organization's purpose will be to balance the rank-and-file's social outlook outside of the traditional Knights of Columbus events on campus. 

The organization will need to be named after someone of high standing in the Church, but one who should be known more of as a Catholic free spirit and unorthodox theologian. After all, Church dogma must have a few holes which our members may expose. Several of the Middle Ages popes quali­fy as our namesake, but choosing one is a risky and complicated proposition. While none of them ever heard of stem cells, condoms or Democrats and Republicans, a few Pope Johns and Pope Alexander VI immediately come to mind as our candidates. 
For longevity's sake, John XII (937­
964) would be a good candidate because he became Pope in his late teens and remained the pontiff for his entire adult life. But appearances do matter, and he has a reputation for throwing wild orgies with both adults and children. His son, John XIII (965­
972) unfortunately followed his father's hedonism, and his number turned out to be unlucky since he died just like his dad -at the hands of an angry hus­band. 
To sound akin to the well-respected and longtime Knights of Columbus, maybe the pope at the time of Columbus should be considered, Alexander VI (1492-1503). Originally known as Cardinal Borgia of Spain, the Alexander VI claim to fame rose by conquering much of Italy by force with the help of his son, Cesare. He too had a reputation for throwing large parties, bordering on orgies, that at times reportedly culmi­nated with naked boys jumping out of large cakes. 
Alexander reportedly made a fortune selling indulgences, or free passes to heaven, along with selling Cardinal seats. He arranged for his daughter Lucrezia to be married three times, each time to a richer and more power­ful aristocrat. When this pope died, everyone knew that he was rotten to the core. In fact, the college of Cardinals were so jubilant that they paid their respects by leaving Alexander to rot and turn purple in the Sistine Chapel, until his bloated corpse had to be stuffed into his coffin. Humor should be a core value of our new organization, and lending Alexander's name to it may inspire great social events. But he too does not quite fit as a model for today's Catholic campus counter-organization. 
Many of the Renaissance Popes were generally another group who did not live up to the standards needed today. Since many of those papal elections were rigged for rich, powerful families, these papacies ultimately led to the Protestant Reformation of the 16th cen­tury. If such abuse caused Christendom to split, naming our new campus organ­ization for one of these popes would also certainly fail. 
Ironically, not every pope -like every president -can be the perfect model we expect. The Catholic Church has had both virtuous and immoral leaders, some just recently involved with child abuse in the United States. After all, every human being has personal moral shortcomings and strengths. But policy issues that affect those who are not Catholic paint a gray area in our politi­cal system. 
If our nation was bounded only within the Vatican, then it would be acceptable that our elected officials easily follow a single religion's agenda. But we do not elect a Jew or a Catholic or an Atheist to strenuously follow personal religious beliefs while in office. We elect repre­sentatives in our system to make judg­ments that are in the interest of their constituencies or the nation as a whole ... -judgments that are mostly gray in complexity. 
With our number of popes at 262 and counting, maybe we can find one whose name was "Gray," and therefore pro­mote debate, inclusion and tolerance to our new Catholic campus organization. That should be our core value.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
The vvar continues 
Wars in the past have been well-planned and implemented over important issues such as slavery, freedom and equality. But you, Otters of Sorin, deserve no credit for your ill-planned attempt. You have made a mockery of the art of ancient battle. 
At approximately 12:15 am April 2nd (a day late of April Fool's we might add), you lined up outside our hall, ordering the surrender of a mere freshman who had simply asserted her right of freedom of speech and used her as a scapegoat to justify your so-called reign of terror against the women ofWalsh Hall. 
Once the sweet freshman went outside to hear your speech, you did nothing but exclaim, "Show us your horns!" and blankly stared at her. Way to go. Clearly you were accepted early to Notre Dame. Oh wait, we forgot! You then so bravely threw water balloons at her, forgetting that we are WI.L.D. Women and not witches prone to melting. 
You may have thought you were proving a point, Sorin, but you just dug yourselves deeper into a non­sensical hole. You further alienated yourselves from the acceptance of your peers on campus by not only defacing our hall (Tearing out our screen doors? Really?) but also by disturbing the peace of nearby dorms this evening. We sincerely thank you for prov­ing our point that you hate us for no reason. On behalf of WI.L.D. Women everywhere.

Labels unnecessary 
Although I cannot completely agree with Mr. Petrocelli ("Political correctness overload," April 2), I would like to thank him for recog­nizing the main point of the "End the R Word" campaign: all people, the mentally disabled, elderly, ill, the list goes on, are just that ­people. They do not need a special name, good connotation or bad, to defme them or differentiate them. 
My brother is 16 years old and mentally retarded in every true sense of the world. Being diag­nosed with Cerebral Palsy from birth, he cannot walk, talk, sit, stand, feed or even go to the bath­room by himself. He will never drive a car, be able to walk (some­thing we take for granted every day) down the aisle to receive his high school diploma, or do the jig at a Notre Dame football game. 
When I heard of the campaign to end the "R" word, I was interested to see how the student body would respond. Although I gratefully applaud those who took this seri­ously, or even just signed the peti­tion and walked away, it made me sick to hear stories of people not signing and mimicking "retards" as they laughed and strutted away. When I was standing in line to get dinner, people who had just signed the petition walked up behind me, laughing, saying, "What the hell is that [petition]? All I know is that's retarded." 
Although hypocritical, nauseat­ing and completely defeating the point, these things did not surprise me. No one can truly know the hurt caused by one little word unless they have experienced it first-hand, seeing kids stare at a loved one in the grocery store or bluntly walking up to you and ask­ing "why isn't he 'normal' like me?" Who said you are the normal one? I know the word "retarded" will never leave our generation's vocabulary. All I ask is this: please think before you speak and act. 
Whether its "retarded," "gay" or any other negatively connotated word, you are calling out one group of people and making light of something that is bigger than all of us. No one chooses to have cerebral palsy, Down syndrome or any other disability. My brother did not choose to be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life, and ifI could switch places with him, even for a second, so he could experience some of the won­derful people and things I have experienced (like the inspiring people I have met and things I have done here at Notre Dame), I would. 
Like Mr. Petrocelli said, any and every individual is a person, and doesn't need to be defined by a word. I think ifwe truly attempted to recognize this, words like retarded and their definitions would be irrelevant.

Keep Coach Brey 
For as disappointed as I am in our men's basketball team's performance this past season, I have to disagree with Kevin Sonn and his desire for the University to fire Coach Mike Brey for a number of reasons. Sonn, along with many others, has an issue with the style of play that Brey coaches, which is under­standable. We do shoot a lot of threes and we are not an adept defensive team. However, Brey plays this style out of necessity and because, as the coach at Notre Dame, he is limited in a number of ways other Big East and national contenders are not. 

This is not a fault of Brey, but rather an implication of the University and the athletic department. Brey's teams play in an outdated, run-down facility, complete with duct tape holding together seats in the lower bowl. The practice facilities are on the same level. And, unlike football, the basketball team does not have the storied tradition (or unwavering fan support) to entice recruits despite these shortcomings. 
Because ofthese factors, and the higher academic standards to which Notre Dame holds its student-athletes, recruiting is a serious challenge for Brey. This is not to mention the fact that the team competes in the Big East, widely regarded as the toughest conference in the country. 
Before Coach Brey came to Notre Dame in 2001, the Irish hadn't been in the NCAA Tournament since 1990. In Brey's nine seasons as head coach, Notre Dame has made the tournament five times and Brey has been named the Big East Coach of the Year twice. The University, recognizing its deficiencies with regards to the basketball program, will finally update the facili­ties this offseason to a level which will allow Brey to compete with the rest of the conference on a level playing field. 
I am not claiming that Brey can take this program to national prominence given the right set of circumstances (there are actually a number of reasons to believe that he cannot). However, I also think it is wrong to close the book on him before he even has the chance.

As an eight-year-old girl with a famous mother who rarely gives her the time of day, into a relationship with one of his former child friends? 
The idea of romance with an imaginary friend is the only concept that sets "Sunday's at Tiffany's" apart from the average romance novel. It seeks to explain the truth behind the imaginary friend, an experience most people have had personally or seen someone else have.

Broncos send Bears Cutler 
Feud ends as Denver lands three picks and Orton in exchange for QB 
Associated Press 
ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -Jay Cutler got his wish Thursday: a ticket out of Denver. And the Chicago Bears have a fran­chise quarterback for the first time in decades. 
The Broncos announced Thursday that they had agreed to trade their disgrun­tled Pro Bowl passer to the Bears, who've gone through a bevy of quarterbacks without much success ever since Jim McMahon was calling plays in the 1980s. 
The Broncos will get quar­terback Kyle Orton in return, along with two first-round draft picks and a third-round­er. 
The Broncos get the Bears' top pick in this year's draft, which is No. 18 overall, and Chicago's first-round draft pick in 2010 along with a third-round selection this year (No. 84 overall). Denver also gave up a fifth-rounder this year. 
Calls to Cutler's agent, Bus Cook, went unanswered. His office in Hattiesberg, Miss., was closed because of bad weather and his home phone had a message asking callers to call back later. An e-mail sent by The Associated Press wasn't returned. 
Cutler asked for a trade last month after his relationship with Josh McDaniels soured when the new 32-year-old coach talked to other teams about trading him. Cutler and his agent didn't think McDaniels was upfront with them about the trade talks. 
Two meetings designed to clear the air only raised Cutler's level of distrust. Still, McDaniels insisted over and over that Cutler was his guy and he said at last week's NFL owners meetings that he would do everything he could to repair their relationship. 
When the rocket-armed but thin-skinned passer didn't return the Broncos' phone calls, however, team owner Pat Bowlen said enough was enough. On Tuesday night, he announced he had given his new brain trust of McDaniels and general manager Brian Xanders the go-ahead to seek a trade for the quarterback who made the Pro Bowl in just his second season as a starter. 
Although Cutler is 17-20 as a starter, he's been victimized by dismal defenses in Denver, and he was an impressive 13­1 when the Broncos held opponents to 21 points or fewer. 

Last year, Cutler threw for a franchise record 4,526 yards, 25 touchdowns and 18 inter­ceptions. In his 37-game career in Denver, he complet­ed 62.5 percent of his passes for 9,024 yards, 54 TDs and 37 interceptions. 
Although he was prone to mistakes, his bold and at times risky play wasn't just tolerated but encouraged by former Broncos coach Mike Shanahan, who would often laud Cutler for not just dump­ing off short passes to pad his statistics but instead dared to go downfield, even into cover­age. He said that trait would make him great one day. 
Cutler's inability to quickly fulfill that forecast cost Shanahan his job on Dec. 30 after the Broncos missed the playoffs for the third straight year. 
Cutler wasn't happy about Shanahan's firing. And he was upset when his position coach, Jeremy Bates, bolted for Southern Cal because McDaniels will be the one call­ing plays in Denver now. 
When he hired McDaniels, Bowlen proclaimed that Cutler "is the man around here, now." 
That didn't last long. 
Cutler started to get over Shanahan's dismissal and Bates' departure and he told McDaniels in February he was eager to learn his new offense. But that all changed on Feb. 28, when Cutler learned McDaniels had talked about trading him to Tampa Bay in a three-way deal that would have brought McDaniels' pro­tege, Matt Cassel, from New England to Denver. 
McDaniels had tutored Cassel, who led New England to an 11-5 record after Tom Brady suffered a season-end­ing injury in the opener last year. 
That sent McDaniels' stock soaring and landed him in Denver as Shanahan's succes­sor. 
It seemed like the perfect match: the rocket-armed pass­er meets the offensive guru. 
But McDaniels' dalliance with his former pupil blew up in his face when he didn't clue in Cutler, and now McDaniels begins his era in Denver by chasing off his 25-year-old Pro Bowl quarterback-and he'll have to face Cassel twice a year because the Patriots ended up sending his protege to Kansas City instead. 
As for Cutler, he won't have to ditch his West Coast style for the intricate Patriots-style offense. 
He might be going to one of the teams he rooted for as a kid growing up in Santa Claus, Ind., but he's also leaving a great pocket of protection in Denver, where left tackle Ryan Clady is considered the best young tackle in the game, and a great bunch of receivers led by fellow Pro Bowler Brandon Marshall and Eddie Royal. Behind young tackles Clady and Ryan Harris, Cutler's offensive line allowed just a dozen sacks. 
The Bears, however, signed free agent left tackle Orlando Pace on Thursday. 
Denver now has Orton, fel­low newcomer Chris Simms and Darrell Hackney at quar­terback. 
Simms, who signed a two­year, $6 million free agent deal ostensibly to serve as Cutler's backup, has thrown just two passes since undergo­ing emergency surgery to remove his spleen after a game in 2006. Hackney's next NFL pass will be his first. 
Bears general manager Jerry Angelo made it elear in December. after his team went 9-7 and missed the playoffs for the second straight year­that solidifying the quarter­back spot was his top priority. 
"It's all about the quarter­back," he said. "You don't win because of wide receivers. You don't win because of running backs. You win because of the quarterback. We've got to get the quarterback position sta­bilized." 
Orton threw for 2,972 yards while completing 272 of 465 passes and throwing more touchdowns (18) than inter­ceptions (12) after beating out Rex Grossman for the starting job. But he wasn't the same after being carted off the field with a sprained ankle against Detroit midway through the season. 
Orton went from throwing a club record 205 passes with­out an interception to throw­ing eight in four games before a strong finish in the finale. 
The Bears will get a great but often petulant passer who is going from the long shadow of John Elway in Denver to the Windy City, where he'll be under just as much scrutiny. 
Cutler is halfway through the six-year, $48 million con­tract he signed as the 11th overall pick out of Vanderbilt in the 2006 draft. His salary cap number for next season is just over $1 million. 
Although he probably won't play in the game, the Bears visit the Broncos for an exhibi­tion on Aug. 30. 

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Kentucky and Coach Cal sign huge contract 
Associated Press 

DETROIT -John Calipari will make more in a single half at Kentucky than Kenya Crandell will make all year at Southern Utah. 
That's life for a college assistant. A lot of head coaches, too. Unless you're Billy Donovan, Coach K, Roy Williams or a handful of oth­ers, coaching won't make you a millionaire. Not in one season, anyway. 
But if you're looking for outrage at the $32 million Kentucky threw at Calipari this week, don't look to the coaches convention at the Final Four. It's just the price of business at Kentucky, most coaches said, a school that treasures its tradition-rich history and refuses to accept anything less in the future. 
Besides, if Kentucky is will­ing to throw around that kind of money, maybe a little of it eventually will come their way, too. 
"To me, it's democracy. The market dictates," Missouri coach Mike Anderson said Thursday. "Everyone's trying to get a jump on the next guy. It's always been like that. In everything. That's just the American way, isn't it?" 
Anderson should know. 

Four days after taking the Tigers to the Elite Eight for the first time since 2002, he had a new seven-year deal that bumped his salary by $500,000 a year. 
Fed up after yet another season of not being in the hunt for a national title, Kentucky fired Billy Gillispie and lured Calipari from Memphis on Tuesday with an eight-year, $31.65 million deal. Calipari was 13 7-14 over the last four seasons, and his Memphis team was the only one in the country to be a No. 1 or 2 seed in the NCAA tournament during that same time frame. The Tigers made four straight regional semifinals, losing to Kansas in the final last year. 
Athletic director Mitch Barnhart was quick to point out Calipari's base salary is only $400,000 a year, with most of the rest coming from media and television rights. The athletic department is self-sufficient, Barnhart added, and no coach's salary is paid with state appropria­tions or university funding. 
The value Calipari brings to Kentucky extends far beyond the basketball court, too, Barnhart said. Coaches are often the faces of their schools, and their success can be as profitable for the anthropology department as it is for the athletic depart­ment. Long runs in the NCAA tournament have translated into increased applications; after Siena took top-seeded Louisville to the wire in the second round this year, coach Fran McCaffery said hits on the small, Catholic college's Web site jumped from 8,000 to 60,000. 
"To be the premier basket­ball program in America, you want the best coach, you must pay a premium price," Barnhart said. "We don't mind doing that, because we think it's important. If done correctly, the investment in a coach will pay for itself and yield returns for the overall program in general." 
But the figure is still eye­popping, especially in the troubled economy. 

Throw in $3 million in retention bonuses if he stays at Kentucky through March 31, 2016, Calipari will receive an average of $4 mil­lion a year over the eight years. Figure the Wildcats play 35 games a year-that's assuming a trip to the Final Four each year, of course­Calipari will make about $114,286 per game. Add in 10 minutes worth of time­outs, and that's $2,285 per minute-about the price of one of his designer suits. 
"You have to ask some very hard questions, whether this is really in tune with the aca­demic values, whether we've reached a point already that these high salary and pack­ages for coaches has really extended beyond what's expected within the academ­ic community," NCAA presi­dent Myles Brand said. 

"Those questions really have to be asked. Now, we can't answer them; it's anti­trust if we were to try to reg­ulate any salaries. But I would hope our university presidents and our confer­ences would ask those ques­tions themselves." 
Calipari isn't the only one getting the big bucks these days, though. Billy Donovan averages $3.5 million annu­ally at Florida after winning back-to-hack national titles, and Kansas coach Bill Self isn't far behind at $3 million a year. Tom Crean is making about $2.36 million a year at Indiana-and he hasn't even won a national title.

Associated Press 
CLEVELAND -Free on bail but facing serious legal charges, Cleveland Browns wide receiver Donte Stallworth will get ready for an upcoming NFL season not knowing if he'll play. 
Stallworth surrendered in court Thursday on charges that he was driv­ing drunk when he struck and killed a pedestrian while returning from a night of partying in Miami Beach on March 14. The 28-year-old Stallworth was released by Miami authorities after posting $200,000 bail. 
He was expected to fly 

back to Cleveland on Thursday night. Stallworth intends to resume voluntary work­outs with the rebuilding Browns, who must now consider their options and the possibilitythey will not have the seven-year veteran on their roster next season. 
Following a brief hear­ing Thursday before Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Dennis Murphy, Stallworth, dressed in a dark suit and holding his mother Donna's hand, expressed his condolences and offered his prayers to victim Mario Reyes' fami­ly. Stallworth added he has "full confidence and faith" in the legal process. 
If convicted of DUI manslaughter, Stallworth faces a maximum of 15 years in prison. 
The judge set an April 23 arraignment date for Stallworth to enter a plea. Stallworth, who is allowed to travel between Ohio and Florida and must seek permission to go anywhere else, does not have to be present at that hearing. Stallworth is expected to plead not guilty and a trial date will be set. 
The problem for the Browns is the legal case could drag into the 2009 season. 
The team did not rush 

IN BRIEF Stevens extends coaching 
contract through 2016 
INDIANAPOLIS -Butler coach Brad Stevens has agreed to a con­tract extension with the Bulldogs through the 2015-16 season. 
The new contract announced Thursday adds one year to the con­tract Stevens signed a year ago. Terms of the new deal were not dis­closed. 
The 32-year-old Stevens is one of the youngest coaches in Division I. He has compiled a 56-10 record in his two seasons as Butler coach, winning the Horizon League regular­season championship and taking the Bulldogs to the NCAA tournament both years. 
Butler was 26-6 last season, losing to LSU in the first round of the tour­ney. 
Stevens played at nearby DePauw. He was a Butler assistant for six years under Thad Matta and Todd Lickliter and became coach after Lickliter left for Iowa in 2007. 
Reds considering Gary
Sheffield for limited play 
SARASOTA, Fla. The Cincinnati Reds wrapped up training camp with an overture to Gary Sheffield and a lingering question about the last opening in their starting rotation. 
Manager Dusty Baker said Thursday that he's interested in adding Sheffield -a friend for many years -to the roster. The trouble is that he can't offer regu­lar playing time to the 40-year­old free agent, who is hoping for a full-time job and a multiyear deal. 
Baker got permission from gen­eral manager Walt Jocketty to call Sheffield and see if he would con­sider the Reds, who don't have a starting job open. Sheffield, who was released by the Detroit Tigers on Tuesday, could start in left field when the Reds are facing a left-handed pitcher, fill in at first base on occasion and pinch-hit. 
to Stallworth's defense after the charges were announced Wednesday, releasing a statement say­ing "we are disappointed he has put himself in this position." The Browns also said they had been in communication with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. 
As much as Stallworth's life is in the hands of the legal system, it is Goodell who could decide his foot­ball future. 
Stallworth, whose first season with Cleveland was marred by injuries, faces a possible suspen­sion if the league deems he violated its conduct or substance abuse policies. 

Agent hopes Vick can 
return by September 
NEWPORT NEWS, Va. -An agent for suspended NFL star Michael Vick told a bankruptcy court on Thursday that he hopes the ex-Atlanta Falcons quarterback could return to the league by September. 
Joel Segal testified as part of a hearing to assess Vick's plan to emerge from bankruptcy, which was designed with the goal ofVick return­ing to a professional football career. Vick, who left a federal prison in Kansas last week to travel to Virginia, was in court for the first time in the case. He is scheduled to testify Friday. 
To return to a team, Vick still must apply to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to be reinstated. He hasn't yet done so, Segal said, and plans first to finish his 23-month sentence for bankrolling a dogfighting operation. He will return to his family and com­munity, and when he is ready, start working with strength and quarter­back coaches.

Irish face top teams in North Carolina 
Ten top-25 teams await Maunu and company at Bryan National Collegiate Tournament 
By MEAGHEN VESELIK 
Sports Wrirer 
No. 30 Notre Dame will close out regular season play this weekend as it makes its first appearance at the 12th Annual Bryan National Collegiate Tournament in Greensboro, N.C. 
The team will face some of the top national teams' best five golfers in the three-day event, Notre Dame's last competition before the Big East tournament. 
"We need to play well, we haven't really put three rounds together recently," Irish coach Susan Holt said. "We're at a point in our season where we need to put our rounds togeth­er, and I think it's certainly achievable this weekend." 
The five-woman Irish lineup will be made up of senior cap­tain Lisa Maunu, junior Annie Brophy, sophomores So-Hyun Park and Katie Conway and freshman Becca Huffer. 

They will play a total round of 54 holes, one round of 18 holes per day, on the par-72 course. The top four of the five scores each day will go towards the overall team score. 
"There are 18 teams, and at least 10 are top-25 teams, so there's some great competi­tion," Holt said. "It's time for us to step up and make a state­ment. Our schedule has given us the opportunity to do that, and I'd like to see us get our confidence up before heading into the Big East tournament." 
Florida took the Bryan Tournament title last season with an overall 906 (42 over par), and Arkansas' Stacy Lewis earned medalist honors win an even-par 216. 
Competitors this season include No 3. Virginia, No. 8 Georgia, No. 9 LSU, No. 18 Louisville, No. 15 Michigan State, No. 13 North Carolina and No. 12 Wake Forest. 
In their last appearance, the Irish placed sixth at the March 22 Betsy Rawls Longhorn Invitational in Austin, Texas. 
The team moved up one spot on the last day of competition, finishing with a final-round score of 311 (23 over). Park scored a team-best 76 for the second consecutive day, ending the tournament in a tie for 23rd place at 225 (9 over). ller final round included one birdie on the 18th hole and 13 pars, but was brought down by three bogeys over four holes and a double bogey on the par-S fifth hole. 
Conway finished her final round at 77 (5 over), improving throughout the weekend. Huffer also shot a (5-over) 77 in the third round, going 11 over with 227 for the tournament. Maunu and Brophy shot 81 and 83 respectively in the final round. Maunu finished with 11 pars and in 47th place with a total of 233(17 over). Brophy had nine pars and tied for 58th with a total of 236 (20 over). 

Facing some tough competi­tion this weekend, Notre Dame is looking to hold its own in the tournament, and knows what it needs to do to achieve that. 
"If we could get our rounds together, we have a good chance of making a good show­ing," Holt said. "It'll be a chal­lenge to do that, and we have to be at our best. We're hoping to manage the course a bit better than we have been. It's a tough course, but I think it plays to our advantage this weekend." 
The Irish will tee off from the 1Oth hole Friday and Saturday at 10 a.m. in the split-tee start with a shotgun start at 10 a.m. Sunday.

Belles hope to streak by Alma 
By CHRIS MICHALSKI 
Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's will try to tack two more wins onto its seven­game winning streak as the Belles (18-2, 4-0 MIAA) travel to Alma College (14-9, 4-2) for a doubleheader. 
The Belles are coming off a doubleheader sweep of the Olivet Comets, their third straight sweep. 
The Scots, on the other hand, have split four of their last five doubleheaders and have a record of 8-4 since returning from their spring break trip Florida. 
With conference play in full swing, the Belles seem to be playing their best at just the right time. 
"We are playing really well as a team. Everyone is contributing both on offense and defense as we are now starting to really string hits together," Belles coach Erin Sullivan said. "Everything seems to be clicking for us right now." 
In particular, the combination of stellar pitching performances and rock-solid defensive efforts has been a recipe for success lately, as the Belles have given up only three runs in their last six games. 
"Our pitchers are really hitting their spots and are avoiding the walks. We are keeping people off the bases, which really takes pressure off our defense," Sullivan said. "Our middle infielders have been playing especially well and our outfield­ers tracked down some long fly balls in our last game." 
Sullivan also noted the impor­tance of senior catcher Ashley Fusaro in the overall perform­ance of the pitching staff. Sullivan said Fusaro has shown her leadership qualities, calling pitches and mentoring the two pitchers, freshmen Angela Gillis and Monica Palicki. 
Fusaro's bat has not gone unnoticed, either, as she cur­rently has a .492 batting aver­age with a home run and 12 RBis. 
The Belles currently sit in first place in the MIAA, and a sweep of Alma would put them in prime position to earn a berth in the conference tournament. 
The opening pitch is sched­
uled for 2 p.m. Saturday.

Wizards upset Cavs after Agent Zero's return 
Iguodala, Miller and Dalembert lead Philadelphia in second-halfrally to top Milwaukee and keep playoffhopes alive 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -For the first time all season, the Washington Wizards fielded a starting line­up resembling the one they envisioned when training camp opened last fall. 
The result: The team leading the league in losses beat the team leading the league in wins. 
In the closest thing they'll have to a playoff game this year, Gilbert Arenas and the Wizards recovered after blow­ing a 14-point second-half lead and ended the franchise-record 13-game winning streak of LeBron James and Cleveland Cavaliers with a 109-101 victo­ry Thursday night. 
Arenas, playing his second game of the season in his latest attempt to return from knee surgery, had with 11 points on 3-for-11 shooting and 10 assists and six rebounds in 33 min­utes. 
Brendan Haywood, making his first start of the season, had 12 points and 1 0 rebounds for the Wizards, who also received the usual steady contributions from Caron Butler (25 points) and Antawn Jamison (19) and a surprising 17 points on 6-for-8 shooting from Darius Songaila as they snapped a three-game losing streak. 
James scored 22 of his 31 points in the second half and finished with six assists and nine rebounds, but-how's this for a statistical oddity-was responsible for all five of his team's turnovers until Daniel Gibson traveled in the final minute of the third quarter. James finished with six turnovers, and had a 3-pointer stuffed in his face by Butler with in the final half-minute. 
The Wizards led by 68-54 midway through the third quar­ter and 80-70 going into the fourth, but the Cavaliers opened the final period with a 16-6 run with James on the bench. Wally Szczerbiak's 3­pointer put the teams even at 86-86 with 7:13 remaining. 
The Wizards answered with an 11-3 spurt, including a three-point play and a drive to the basket by Songaila and a short jumper from Arenas. Arenas later assisted on back­to-hack baskets by Butler and Jamison to get the lead to nine. 
James helped trim the lead to four with a 3-pointer and a free throw, but Nick Young's explo­sive drive to the basket with 
1:05 to play put the Wizards ahead 104-98. The sellout crowd roared as Washington­a team that has won only 18 games-wrapped up its second win over Cleveland this season. 
Last year at this time, the Wizards and Cavaliers were headed toward a first-round playoff series that would include subplots aplenty, including a back-and-forth between James and Washington guard DeShawn Stevenson that eventually drew rappers Jay-Z and Soulja Boy into the fray. Cleveland won the series in six games, with Arenas missing the last after more trouble with his knee. 
Now the Cavaliers are the best team in the East; the Wizards are the worst. James is an MVP candidate; Arenas has spent most of the season during with more knee trouble. 
Washington did manage to beat Cleveland in January when James was called for travel­ing-he claimed it was a legal "crab dribble"-with 2.3 sec­onds remaining. 
Cavaliers coach Mike Brown is happy there won't be a post­season rematch later this month. 
"Jay-Z versus Soulja Boy, the hard fouls, the crab dribble­I'm not going to miss any of that," Brown said before the game. 
There did seem to be at least one bit of gamesmanship by James in this game, when he stopped play just as Arenas was about to attempt a free throw with 1:4 7 left. James went to the bench to attend to some­thing. Arenas smiled, but he also missed the free throw when play resumed. 
76ers 105, Bucks 95 
The Philadelphia 76ers were a bit helter-skelter in the first half against the Milwaukee Bucks, turning the ball over 13 times and hearing groans from the home crowd. 
After returning from the lock­er room, the Sixers played one of their better halves of the season. 
Andre Iguodala scored 20 points, Lou Williams had 14 of his 21 in the second half, and Philadelphia rallied from a 13­point first-half deficit to defeat Milwaukee 105-95 on Thursday night. 
Andre Miller contributed 18 points and 11 assists for the Sixers (39-35), who won their second straight and vaulted past Miami into fifth place in the Eastern Conference playoff race. 
Marreese Speights had 14 points, Reggie Evans chipped in 13 and Samuel Dalembert added 10 rebounds for Philadelphia, which won its fifth in a row against the Bucks, including all three this season. 

"Everybody was not there mentally," Evans said about the first half. "The second half was almost like a wake-up call, 'Let's tighten up a little bit. Let's focus in even more and get ~~to it.' We slowly grinded it out. 
With only eight games remaining before the playoffs, every victory is crucial for the Sixers. The first half was hard­ly a playoff-caliber effort. 
"Fourth quarters have been big and that's really impor­tant," Philadelphia coach Tony DiLeo said. "Down the stretch, we played with a sense of urgency." 
Ramon Sessions led Milwaukee with his second straight stellar outing, getting 18 points, 10 assists and five rebounds a night after his first career triple-double against the Los Angeles Lakers. 
''I'm confident and I'm trying to finish every game strong," Sessions said. "I made a few mistakes in the fourth quarter which I need to correct. We continued to play hard until the end and I'll always give that kind of effort." 
Richard Jefferson added 17 points and Charlie Bell con­tributed 14 for the Bucks (32­45), who have lost seven of eight. 
" It was very similar to (Wednesday against the Lakers) where we had a lot of break­downs early in the game," Milwaukee coach Scott Skiles said. "The Sixers didn't take advantage of them until later. With about three minutes left in the third, they started getting into the paint and causing us problems." 
The game was tied at 89 with 
5:45 remaining before the Sixers proceeded on a 1 0-0 run in the next 2:16.

With victory No. 50, Bruins one from home ice 
Canadiens use power-play to net three goals in easy win over New York; Backes scores four in Blues triumph 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -This win gave the Boston Bruins 50. The next one will give them something they value even more: home ice through the Eastern Conference playoffs. 
"You can play for one team your whole career and never get 50 wins-and still have some real good seasons," goalie Tim Thomas said Thursday night after stopping 31 shots to beat the Ottawa Senators 2-1. "It's a credit to the team, the way it's built and the way the guys play together. 
"But if you're running the Boston Marathon and you're leading after 20 miles, you don't stop to say, 'Man, I'm leading."' 
Milan Lucie and Marc Savard scored for Boston, which would clinch the best record in the East with its next victory or the Washington Capitals' next loss. The Bruins were one point behind West-leading San Jose for the best overall record, 
pending  the  Sharks'  game  
against  Edmonton  later  
Thursday.  

"I don't think anyone thought we would've been in this posi­tion this quickly," Boston coach Claude Julien said, "but we'll take it." 
The Bruins hit 50 wins for the eighth time in franchise history and the first since the 1992-93 season; they reached 110 points for the first time since '82-83. And it's just two years since they missed the playoffs entire­ly. 
"The position we were in two years ago-we've come a long way," said forward P.J. Axelsson, whose steal set up the game-winning goal. "But it's still a long way to go." 
But Savard was ready to cele­brate-a little. 
"We had a tough stretch and now we're heading in the right direction again," he said. "I think it'll be more enjoyable tomorrow when we go to the rink for practice; smiles will be on the boys. It's a great accom­plishment for us.... Fifty wins, I wouldn't have predicted it right away and I don't think any of you did either. I think it's a spe­cial feat." 
Daniel Alfredsson scored for Ottawa, and Alex Auld made 31 saves. 
The Bruins killed off a 6-on-4 in the final 1:55 when Mark Recchi was called for high­sticking and the Senators pulled the goalie for an extra man. Ottawa had a flurry of shots down the stretch before an interference penalty against them evened things up with 2.7 

seconds left. 
"We were one shot away and it's disappointing but the guys' effort was definitely there," Senators coach Cory Clouston said. "They make you pay. They're a very good team. A couple of little turnovers like that and they make you pay." 
Alfredsson gave the Senators the lead when he took a pass from Jason Spezza and put it over Thomas' right shoulder just 5:23 into the game. Lucie tied it with his slap shot 2:27 into the second. 
Boston broke the tie in the third when Axelsson stole Brendan Bell's clearing attempt and backhanded it over to the slot for Savard, who put a wrist shot past Auld with 16:58 to play. Savard has two goals and four assists in his last five games. 
Canadians 5, Islanders 1 
Just like that, the Montreal Canadiens can feel good about their place in the standings instead of worrying about who is closing in behind them. 
Saku Koivu scored the first of Montreal's three power-play goals, and Alex Kovalev had three assists as the Canadiens opened a season-ending road stretch with a 5-1 victory over the New York Islanders on Thursday night. 
The Canadiens (40-27-10), who vaulted over the New York Rangers into seventh place in the Eastern Conference, netted two goals in each of the first two periods and cruised to a critical win over the last-place team in the NIIL. 
Montreal has a one-point lead over the Rangers with five games left, one more than New York-which lost 4-2 at Carolina on Thursday. The Canadiens are three points ahead of ninth-place Florida and just two behind Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. 
"It's fun to have your destiny in your own hands," forward Alex Tanguay said. "We knew that no matter what the Rangers were doing tonight, we knew we had one game in hand on them. And if we just won our games, we were going to move up." 
Mathieu Schneider and fellow defenseman Andrei Markov also scored power-play goals-set up by Kovalev-and Tanguay and defenseman Mike Komisarek added even-strength tallies for the Canadiens, playing four of their final six on the road as they push for the playoffs. 
"We're not looking at where we're at in the standings, we're just looking at winning games," Tanguay said. "Points are cru­cial and it's going to be no dif­ferent for us Saturday in Toronto." 
The line of Tanguay-Koivu­Kovalev has scored 27 points in the five games it has been together and 12 of Montreal's past 21 goals. 
"We had success in the first game and kept going," Koivu said. "The whole team is play­ing a whole lot better right now." 
Jaroslav Halak, subbing for No. 1 goalie Carey Price (flu), made 26 saves for his 17th win. Montreal recorded 38 shots on Yann Danis and improved to 5­3-3 under coach Bob Gainey. The Canadiens are 4-0-1 in their last five. 
Montreal was 35-24-7 when Gainey, also the club's general manager, fired coach Guy Carbonneau and stepped behind the bench. 
Jeff Tambellini made it 4-1 in the second period for the injury­plagued Islanders, who were missing injured leading scorers Mark Streit (groin) and Kyle Okposo (groin} and played in front of a home crowd that largely supported the visiting Canadiens. 
The Islanders are on a 2-6-1 skid after winning five of seven (5-1-1 ). Now York has allowed 29 goals in the past sevon games. 
"We've been playing pretty good, and this was a disappoint­ing efl'ort for our team," veteran Islandnrs forward Doug Wnight said. 
The chants of "Go llabs Co!" and "Ole! Ole! Ole! OIP!" filled Nassau Coliseum ev1m before Koivu staked the Canadiens to a 1-0 lead with 6:57 left in the first, 34 seconds into rookie Sean Bentivoglio's holding penalty. Kovalev found Koivu with a pass in front for the cap­tain's 16th goal. 
Blues 5, Red Wings 4 
Not even David Backes could explain what happened. 
The 6-foot-3, 220-pound winger scored a career-high four goals, including the go­ahead score with 4:07 left, in the surging St. Louis Blues' 5-4 victory over the Detroit Bed Wings on Thursday night. 
"I don't know what hap­pened," said Backes, who also had his first hat trick. "On·e of those games where you kind of black out and then they're pat­ting you on the back." 
Andy McDonald also scored, and Chris Mason made 34 saves to help the Blues jump from ninth to seventh in the Western Conference playoff race. The Blues are a point ahead of Nashville and Anaheim, with Anaheim facing Vancouver later Thursday night. 
"We just battled in the third period," Mason said. "It was back and forth and we got the two points." 
St. Louis rebounded from a 3­1 loss in Chicago on Wednesday night that snapped its winning streak at five games. 
Nicklas Lidstrom and Niklas Kronwall each had a goal and two assists and Pavel Datsyuk and Johan Franzen both had a goal and an assist for Detroit, which lost its third straight and fourth in five games. Ty Conklin stopped 28 shots. 
"Obviously, the job I'm doing here, the team is not ready," Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said. "So, myself and the leader­ship group here, as a group of individuals, we've got to do bet­ter than this. This is unaccept­able." 
Backes broke a 4-4 tie with his 30th goal of the season, scoring on a one-timer from the bottom of the left circle. 
"We felt that David had the potential to be a 30-goal scor­er," Blues coach Andy Murray said. "But we didn't think it would happen here in Detroit." 
Kronwall tied it at 4 with 4:43 left on a slap shot from the

Franzen made it 4-3 with a spectacular effort at 3:52. He made a move and jumped around St. Louis defenseman Mike Weaver in the slot, then beat Mason as he was falling to the ice for his 33rd goal. 
Lidstrom tied it at 2, with a power-play goal 1:13 into the third period. His 14th goal came on a slap shot from the point. 
But Backes' third goal, just 24 seconds later, restored the Blues' one-goal lead. He beat Conklin from the slot after a mix up between Conklin and defenseman Jonathan Ericsson behind the Detroit net. 
McDonald's power-play goal 
2:53 into the third made it 4-2. He tipped in T.J. Oshie's shot from the point. 
"Mad is an interesting word. Frustrated is a waste of time," Babcock said. ''I'm just telling you I'm disappointed. I'm disap­pointed in the job I'm getting done here. I'm disappointed in the group right now. This is very un-Red Wing-like." 
The Blues took a 2-0 lead in the middle period on Backes' first two goals. 
He opened the scoring at 6:02 when he slammed in a one-time shot from the slot off a pass from Brad Winchester, who was behind the net.

"If you look back at 2007 and 2008 we've been at this point before where we've been 9-2 or 10-3," Coyne said. "I think our focus is how do we finish in a stronger position than we did last year or two years ago." 
The Bearcats are led by their goalie, freshman Katherine Russo, who leads the Big East in save percentage. 
Notre Dame is near the top of every offensive category in the Big East, which Coyne attrib­utes to the team's balance. 
"We have pretty balanced scoring. At different points in the season we've had younger players step up and have a key goal so I think it's everyone who's contributing," Coyne said. 
The Irish are led offensively by sophomore Jillian Byers and junior Gina Scioscia, who are second and third in points per game in Big East play so far this year. 
Byers leads the Irish with 40 goals and has also contributed nine assists throughout the sea­son. Her 11 goals in the Big East are good for second in the conference. 
"[Byers] always draws the top defender from the other team, and she's handling that pres­sure well," Coyne said. 
Scioscia, who has already been named Big East player of the week once this season, leads the team in points with 54 and assists with 21. Her 11 goals and 7 assists in Big East play is good enough for second in both of those categories. She is also second in total points. 
"[Scioscia] is having an out­standing season and I think [she's] stepped up and I'm hop­ing that she'll continue on her current path," Coyne said. 
The Irish will meet the Bearcats Friday at 4 p.m. in Cincinnati and will take on the Cardinals at 1 p.m. Sunday.

"Playing four matches in five days, which is what you have to do at the NCAA champi­onships, is a tough task," Louderback said. "It will be a great test for us."

"The first thing we are focusing on is just getting back to playing good base­ball," Irish coach Dave Schrage said. "Our pitching and defense hasn't been real solid lately and because of that we have been giving up a lot of runs. We need to focus less on our past performances and more on getting back to playing good baseball."

Danridge wins contest in dunk-off 
Associated Press 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. ­New Mexico's Tony Danridge beat Charlotte's Charlie Coley III in the college slam­dunk contest Thursday night at the Palace of Auburn Hills. 
In the final round, Coley received a perfect 50 from the judges after a dunk off a pass from Rhode Island's Jimmy Baron in the stands. Danridge, though, forced a dunk-off with his third 50 of the competition with a two­ball, two-handed double dunk. 

Coley then dunked over judge Jalen Rose for a 48, and Danridge ended it with a left-handed windmill for a 49. 
they have five hitters hitting above .315," he said. "They are very aggressive on the base paths and have the most stolen base attempts in the league. They create and score a lot of runs and have three solid starting pitchers who have pitched fairly well this season." 
For the Irish, pitching has been has a problem this sea­son. Sophomore right-hander Cole Johnson (3-0), who boasts a 2. 7 5 earned run average, is the lone excep­tion. 
"Cole's had an outstanding year for us," Schrage said. "He has really established himself as our number one guy and we always play well behind him. We hope that he will continue to perform at a high lev.~) for us the rest of the way. 
Not counting Johnson's two outings in the series openers against Seton Hall and Pittsburgh, Irish pitchers 
gave up 20 and 29 runs, respectively, in each series' final two games, all resulting in losses. 
Against Villanova's strong pitching staff, Schrage said he knows that will not get the job done. 
"We have got to get three quality starts from our pitch­ers this weekend," he said. "We haven't had that in the first two series and it really hurts us. We gave up a lot of two-out runs because our pitchers struggled to close out innings." 
Saturday's and Sunday's games against Villanova are scheduled to start at 1:05

Irish to face tough teams in California 
By CHRIS MICHALSKI 
Spons Wrirer 
Notre Dame will travel to San Diego to take on tough competition out west this weekend at the San Diego Classic. 
This week, the Irish have been working hard to pre­pare for the Classic, which is a big event. 
"Practices have been very intense this past week," freshman Tess Fitzpatrick said. "We are currently doing seat-races to determine who will row in what positions, so we really have to give it our all and compete with each other." 
The San Diego Crew Classic will feature schools from all over the country, including Georgetown, Syracuse, Stanford and Villanova. 
"There are a lot of ranked teams traveling to San Diego this weekend so we are really looking to have success and hopefully make a name for ourselves," freshman Alicia Elliott said. 
The Irish are coming off a very successful weekend, where they won four races against Indiana and Purdue. 
The first and second varsi­ty eight races went to the 
Irish, with senior coxswain Stephanie Szegedi leading her crew to a time of 5:33 and senior coxswain Kelsey Otero following that up with a time of 5:46. 
The Irish dominance really showed in the varsity four competition, where Notre Dame won three times. 
Irish-A, led by senior coxswain Katherine McMackin, crossed the line with a first-place time of 6:49. 
Freshman Jacqueline Gihooly led her Irish-C crew to second place, followed by junior Rachael Louie's lrish­B crew in third. 
The Irish won their fourth race, as Elliott led her first novice eight team to a victo­ry, crossing the line in 6:15. 
The Notre Dame women will send their top two eights to compete in the Classic. The top crew will face Washington, Michigan, Ohio State, and Iowa in their first race scheduled to begin at 
8:50 a.m. Saturday. 
Ultimately, the team is working toward the Big East championships and the South Central Championships. The Irish have won the last five Big East Championships.

Penn State wins NIT title gan1e 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Penn State coach Ed DeChellis met with his team a couple of hours before playing Baylor in the NIT title game and had only one request. 
"Give me everything you have," he said. "If it's good enough, it's good enough; if it's not, it's not. Just leave it all on the floor." 
The Nittany Lions certainly did. And it was plenty. 
Jamelle Cornley scored 18 points and the scrappy Nittany Lions, chasing every loose ball and hustling for every rebound, outlasted the Bears 69-63 on Thursday night to win only the second postseason tournament title in school history. 
Talor Battle added 12 points, all in the second half, for the Nittany Lions (27 -11), who were spurred on by rau­cous chants of "We are ... Penn State," led by none other than Joe Paterno, the 82-year­old football coach sitting about four rows behind the team's bench. 
"You don't know what it's going to be like when you go into it," said Cornley, the tour­nament's most valuable play­er. "The last time I cut down the nets was the state cham­pionship my freshman year of high school. To cut down some more nets in my last game is just an unbelievable feeling." 

The only other postseason tournament Penn State had won was the Atlantic 10 in 1991. 
It was a physical game, and both teams spent most of the night scrambling for every ball in sight. Penn State guard Danny Morrissey was trying to corral a loose one near the scorer's table with about 2 112 minutes to go and the Nittany Lions leading 57-48 when he slammed his head into the floor, laying motionless on the sideline for a few moments. 
Trainers hurried over and tended to the senior, who had a cut above his lip but eventu­ally walked off the floor on his own. 
"We have tough kids. We're going to go compete. That's been our trademark all year," DeChellis said. "That play typ­ifies what our team has been like all year." 
The Bears trailed 62-50 after Stanley Pringle made a pair of free throws with under 2 minutes left, but they did their best to rally. Tweety Carter's 3-pointer made it 62­55 with just over a minute to go, and he made another with 
16.8 seconds left to get within 68-63. Baylor simply ran out of time. 
Battle hit one of two foul shots, and Curtis Jerrells air­balled a 3-point attempt to set off a jubilant celebration in one end of Madison Square Garden, where some 36 bus­loads of white-clad fans made it look like the end zone of Beaver Stadium on a fall Saturday. 
"Penn State had a great fol­lowing, a great crowd, and they're the ones who hit big shots and won the game," said Baylor coach Scott Drew. "As a coach you never feel bad about that, when a team plays great and wins the 
game." 
LaceDarius Dunn scored 18 
points to lead Baylor (24-15), 
which hadn't won a postsea­
son game since 1950 before 
its run to the NIT final. 
Jerrells added 14 points, and 
Carter and Kevin Rogers had 
12 points each. 
Baylor controlled the game in the first half, using a 2-3 zone to slow the tempo to a plodding walk, and took its biggest lead at 26-20 with about 3 minutes left. Penn State closed the gap before Carter's 3-pointer with a few seconds to go made it 29-25 at the break. 
As halftime was drawing to a close, JoePa was shown on the video screens over mid­court, pumping his fist and leading a chorus of chants. 
The energized Nittany Lions 
roared out of the locker room, 
with Cornley scoring a pair of 
hard buckets inside, just like 
a fullback powering through 
the line.

No time to re-lax 
Undefeated squad to host Air Force with hopes to stay perfect 
By MIKE GOTIMER Sports Writer 

No.4 Notre Dame will look to extend its school-record start to 9-0 and remain one of two undefeated teams in Division I lacrosse as it resumes confer­ence play against Air Force at Alumni Field Saturday. 
The Irish (8-0, 1-0 Great Western Lacrosse League) are defending a 23-game home winning streak. 
Although Air Foree (3-5, 1-0) enters the game with a sub­.500 record and the Irish hold a 19-2 mark all-time against the Falcons, eoach Kevin Corrigan said he believes Notre Dame will have a game on its

Irish look for BigEast series win

Notre Dame will try to accomplish something this weekend that it hasn't been able to do in two tries already this season: win a weekend series against a Big East opponent. 
The Irish (16-10, 2-4 Big East) will host conference foe Villanova (14-12, 1-5 Big East) this weekend for a three-game set beginning today at 5:05 p.m. at Frank Eek Stadium.

Squad to defend eight-game streak 
By LAURA MYERS 
Sports Writer 

Notre Dame will look to con­tinue its hot streak this week­end against a pair of Big East opponents. 
The Irish (18-11, 4-1 Big East), will host a doubleheader Saturday against Pittsburgh and a seeond doubleheader Sunday against Seton Hall. 
Notre Dame is currently sec­ond in the Big East behind defending champions DePaul. 
The Panthers (14-15, 2-6) have been struggling of late, losing their last six games, all Big East contests. They now sit 13th of the 16 Big East teams. 
Irish coach Deanna Gumpf said she does not think that Pittsburgh's troubles will have an effect on their play. 
"[Pittsburgh] always plays well against us," she said. "In my mind, Pitt's going to play their best game of the year against us." 
The Pirates (14-14-1, 4-4) are 12th in the conference, only one step above Pittsburgh. They have a difficult weekend ahead, as they face DePaul Saturday before coming to South Bend. 
Pirates shortstop Brittany Schilizzi was named to the Big East Honor Roll for the seeond time Monday. She leads the team with four home runs and 23 RBis. 
Gumpf said the bottom teams in the Big East still pose a sig­nificant threat. 
"Every year the Big East gets better and better," she said. "Any day, any time, teams like Seton Hall will come out with everything they've got and they can beat you."

No.3 Irish set to face top team 
By ALEX BARKER 
Sports Writer 
No. 3 Notre Dame (17 -3) will try to rebound from its loss earlier this week against No. 4 Baylor as it hits the road for a four-game road trip beginning with conference rival DePaul today. 
The Irish will face the Blue Demons in Chicago before heading to Evanston, Ill. for a rematch with No. 1 Northwestern Saturday. Sunday, the team will head back to Chicago for a date with Marquette before ending its trip in Champaign against the Fighting Illini. 
In its last outing against Baylor, the team did not play up to the ability that it has displayed all season. 
"The matehups were a little different against Baylor in the singles and that hurt us," Irish coach Jay Louderback said. "We also won the dou­bles last time and !not win­ning it this timeJ made a big difference." "We really need to finish
