Dear Notre Dame Faculty Members and Students: 
You are all aware of the protest this past week against recruiters from Dow and CIA. There has been considerable static from outside the University and a good deal from inside, as you can imagine or have heard. 
My own reaction is this: students have a right to protest, according to the ground rules established in the Student Manual by a Faculty·Student·Adminstration Committee last spring. All of these rules were observed until Wednesday morning when a number of students did everything possible to create a confrontation. In doing this, I believe they used their freedom of action to obstruct the freedom of others and impose their own personal convictions on others. 
In a free society like the University, this is completely out of order, whatever the sincerity of .their motives, which I concede. 
At this juncture, it seems to me that the whole community must take a stand, the Student Life Council, the Faculty Senate and the Academic Council. Most universities have already stated clearly that while peaceful protest is legitimate, protest that infringes on the rights of other members of the community or obstructs the normal functions of the University is cause for separating from the community those who indulge in such action. The first duty of the whole University community, as an open society, is to preserve its own right to be and do that which it needs to be and do to be itself. Freedom cuts both ways. 
If the University community will declare itself, I shall take whatever action is appropriate if this situation is repeated. 
May I add that no one in this community should be forced to do something inhumane· such as walking on others-to exercise normal freedom of action. A small minority may exercise leadership, but there is a great difference between leadership and tyranny. Last Wednesday's performance was clearly tyranny. I sincerely invite this community to declare itself, through its proper representatives. If not, there is no saying who will be tyrannized next, for whatever reason, or on whatever pretext, with or without sincere interest in what makes a university a very special kind of place--if it can establish its standards and maintain them. If you establish them clearly, I will maintain them with your support. 
These are my reactions and my call to action-as clearly and as frankly as I can state them. I could have acted unilaterally, and many have accused me of weakness or lack of leadership in not doing so. However, I much prefer to appeal to you, for this is your community and your University and it cannot be what it should be without your support 
Sincerely yours, in Notre Dame, 
(Rev.) Theodore M. Hesburgh CSC 
President 
P.S. One last reaction: while I believe that the students involved in last week's episode should be cited as violating established standards, and put on disciplinary probation, I would be inclined to use the occasion for greater profit in the future by not suspending them, but declaring our intentions clearly for any future recurrence. Young people are under great strains today, and we should all be satisfied by a recognition by the total community, from here on, that so is the University. If it goes under, so do all of us and our life commitment.

DeGaulle Orders A usterlty Program 
PARIS (UPI) -President Charles de Gaulle yesterday ordered a wartime style economic austerity program that will hit nearly every French wallet as an alternative to devaluing the franc. He said the sacrifices in wages, prices and taxes would increase French grandeur. 
De Gaulle's outline for rebuilding the economy and ending the billion dollar speculation against francs in world money markets included an immediate $1 billion cut in government spending, a freeze on food, public service and industrial goods prices, higher taxes, wage controls, tightened credit, and stimulation of exports. 
In slow, tremulous tones he blamed the May June riots and strikes 
for the monetary crisis and called Frenchmen to arms: 
"Frenchmen, Frenchmen, what is happening to our money proves

Last Tuesday Dr. Herman Kahn, director of the Hudson Institute, examined lower middle class white attitudes in a talk in the Library Auditorium; 
Fifty Black students paraded onto the field at the Georgia Tech game carrying banners challenging the lily-white makeup of the Notre Dame "community" and its lack of responsiveness to Afro-American demands; 
Dr. Kahn, speaking of ethnic Whites in America, pointed to the fact that these people heatedly deny being prejudiced, but that at least two-thirds of them have latent racial feelings which can be touched off by events such as school busing and militant dcmonstra tions; 
The Afro-American students, many of them thrusting fists in the air in the fashion of Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the Olympic games, began to parade around the stadium, encountering intense booing as they passed the midfield stands occupied by prominent alumni and friends ofthe University; 
According to Dr. Kahn, nobody is born prejudiced, but attitudes are picked up from elders at a relatively early age. Experience and encounter sometimes adds to feelings, but overall people arc intstructcd in what they believe; 
Passing around the South End of the stadium, the Black students continued to be jeered. However, as they went by the Georgw Tech section, the catcalls slackened by some accounts; 
Or. Kahn contended at one point that Southerners, people used to the Black man, may actually react in much milder manner than some Northerners being exposed to Black activism for the first time: 
As the demonstrators completed their trip around the field, they again neared the Notre Dame cheering section. The booing grew, and cries of "Dirty Nigger" were heard·with increasing frequency; 
An interesting contention of Kahn was that the lower middle class, while as a rule even practicing violence against person, possesses a strident loyalty to traditions; 
Having endured the jeers of the Notre Dame "men, " the Black demonstrators climbed back into the stadium. The specific obscene remarks regarding color and legitimacy ceased, but a low chorus of boos persisted. Instead of taking their places in the stands and cheering the team as it went out to do battle with the boys from Tech, the Afro-American students made their way through an exit and out of the cheering section. As they left, pe(Jple jeered them, bellowing "Aren't you gonna stay and root for your team?"; 
A final observation of Kahn on the lower middle class concerned loyalty to symbols. According to the Hudson Institute director, Chicago police had no objections to bashing in heads of demonstrators in August, but that tears came to their eyes at the burning of an American flag; 
With the Black students gone, student attention shifted to the playing of "America the Beautiful" on the field. Where minutes before there had been cursing and liquor bottles waving, now there was solemnity. The color guard slowly crossed the field as the announcer detailed the liberties we Americans hold true. Throughout the stadium eyes were uplifted and chins held firm. Then, majestically, the band struck up the National Anthem. Thousands joined in the singing, raising their voices to almost shout out the words "/,and of the free and Home of the Brave" at the conclusion. Tears came to the eyes ofmany.

"The principal difference between racial discrimination in the United States and in South Africa is that South African Laws enshrine discrimination," she asserted.

Elston Speaks to Small Crowd 
Last evening, in the library auditorium, Dr. Gerhard A. Elston addressed a very small group of listeners on the American role in Vietnam. Elston is presently Director for Vietnam Affairs of the National Council of Churches. 
Demonstrating a remarkable insight and grasp of the in credibly complex situation that is Vietnam, Dr. Elston shattered American myths about the war, and looked primarily at the Vietnamese side of the question. "Vietnam is a tragedy, in the real sense of the term. A Oaw of perception (in Western views on Southeast Asia) resulted in our becoming more and more involved with Asian affairs, until we were over our  heads in tradition, culture, and foreign policy entanglements," he said. 
One of the most tragic things, according to Dr. Elston, is the resignation of the South Vietnamese to their fate in the conOict, in which they arc the only losers. To illustrate this, he quoted two verses popular in Saigon last summer: 
"We're winning all the battles,
lfpcvi;;,oc,.&ting 
Members of the Hall Presidents Council (JIPC) will submit a report on hall life to the Student Life Council at the SLC's meeting next Monday. The report will include (I) the definition of a modern Christian 
University, (2) the manner in which hall communities now operate, and (3) the manner in which an ideal hall community 
should operate. 
The report will be based on 
the findings and rccommcnda­
tions of the hall presidents 
concerning the roles of the 
rectors, prefects, and security 
guards in the hall, and the 
relationship of hall life to 
university life. (Two weeks ago closer and closer to Saigon." 
"Americans burn our homes to the ground, our army plunders them, and the Viet Cong arc assassins." 
According to Elston, the people arc caught in the middle, with utterly no way out of the problem. This is partially due to the hopelessly divided social and political structure in Vietnam, , according to Dr. Elston. "The American people arc ignorant of the realities of Vietnam," he emphasized. "The only answers arc complex ones, and the American people, along with their political leaders, are not ready to accept this." 
Open Senate Hearing Tonight 
The Committee for the Defi­nition of the Senate will meet tonight at 8 pm in the Library Auditorium, chairman Fred Dedrick announced yesterday. 
"We regret any inconvenience caused by the change," said Dedrick, referring to the ori­ginal scheduling of the meeting for last night. 
The date of the meeting was changed after posters had been printed and after a story on it had been published in The 
Observer. 
The Committee was formed by SBP Rossie after the Senate tabled tlie bill censuring the CIA and Dow. Rossie said that one of the reasons for the committee was to define the Senate's role in relation to that of the Student Life Council, as well as to decide whether or not the Senate should discuss cxtra.campus is­sues.
