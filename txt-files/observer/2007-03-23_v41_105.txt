NCAA hockey costs jump for fans 
$55 increase Regionals passes since 2004 keeps some students away from weekend action 

By KATIE PERALTA 
News Writer 
More than 375 students, fac­ulty and staff members and South Bend residents will get ready, set and run Sunday at 10 
a.m. in the third-annual Holy Half Marathon, a 13.1-mile race around the Notre Dame campus to benefit charitable organizations. 
Holy Half director Kathleen Coverick, a junior, said the race raised more than $6,000 last year to benefit Catholic Charities -a figure organizers hope to surpass this weekend. 
Sponsored by the Class of 2008, Circle K and the Women's Running Club, the race will col­lect money to benefit Hurricane Katrina victims in Louisiana through Operation Helping Hands, a volunteer program under the umbrella of Catholic

NDSP promotes Johnson 
21-year veteran officer replaces Rex Rakow 
By KEN FOWLER 
News Writer 
It's a promotion that comes with the heaviest of hearts. 

Two weeks after the death of Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) director Rex Rakow, longtime friend and current associate director of NDSP, Phil Johnson, was named Rakow's successor Thursday. 
''I'm very humbled and hon­ored by the appointment," Johnson said. "I think that Rex worked very hard through the years to form a wonderful group of people -a group of people I'm honored to lead.... This department has had great lead­ership, and I've been lucky to be a part of a great leadership team for many years." 
Johnson assumed Rakow's day-to-day responsibilities as head of the department when the former director became too sick to work and went on leave in January. Rakow battled cancer for 18 months before his death March 7. 
Johnson joined NDSP as an assistant director in 1986 and was promoted to associate direc­tor in 2005. Before coming to Notre Dame, Johnson served as director of security at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., and director of campus safety at Aquinas College in Grand Rapids, Mich. He said his years at Carleton and Aquinas were "formative," though his 21 years

Three years and a 12-place jump in the polls apparently make a difference of $55 for Notre Dame students hoping to travel to the NCAA hockey regionals beginning tonight in Grand Rapids, Mich. 
Senior Johnny McDermott has fond memories of traveling in 2004 to then-No. 13 Notre Dame's only previous game in the NCAA hockey tournament. He got a bus trip, a box lunch and a multi-game pass for $10. But as the now-No. 1 Irish pre­pare for Alabama-Huntsville tonight, students will be paying more then six times the amount they paid three years ago for a chance to see the Irish on the ice. 
"I was kind of surprised that they weren't doing something with regard to the [ticket] prices," said McDermott, who is driving to tonight's game. 
The increase in cost is not the result of Notre Dame raising prices but rather the athletic department's decision not to subsidize the ticket cost for students as it did in 2004. 

"That would be something you'd have to do on your own," associate athletic director John Heisler said of a subsidy for student tickets. "We can do whatever we want, but for the tickets that we receive from the NCAA, there's only one price. It's not like they provide a routine student discount." 
Nonetheless, Ticket Office director Josh Berlo said Notre Dame had sold 128 three-day passes to students for this year's action after selling 115 such passes in 2004. As a whole, the Notre Dame ticket office has sold approximately 265 three-game passes at $65 apiece for this weekend's events, said Matt McCormack, coordinator of athletic promo­tions. 
But for sophomore Anna Jones, the cost was too steep. 
Jones, who attended the team's conference playoff games and often lined up near­ly two hours before Irish hock­ey home contests, said she immediately decided against going when she saw the dollar figure for the tickets. She said

Holy Half benefits Helping Hands 
Charities. 
Jen Richard, president of the Women's Running Club, said the race promised to be a good time and for a good cause. 
"The Holy Half is a fun, well­organized race," Richard said. "The Holy Half Marathon organizing committee does an amazing job, and they deserve a lot of credit." 
Holy Half organizers said Operation Helping Hands' dedi­cation to the continued relief of the Greater New Orleans area devastated by Hurricane Katrina made the charity an ideal destination for the race's funds. 
The program organizes a large volunteer corps of several 10-15 person groups who travel to Louisiana to volunteer their time and labor for different time periods, ranging from a

Research office updates software, bookkeeping 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
Assistant News Editor 
The Office of Research recently introduced two new initiatives -a change to the business process and the implementation of a new type of electronic research soft­ware to streamline research procedures at Notre Dame. 
For faculty researchers like chemical and biomolecular engineering professor Edward Maginn, these new systems will make filing research pro­posals and tracking grants much easier. 
A new business system 
Under the new business sys­tem, which the Office of Research started in December, Maginn has three research administrators assigned to his proposals -a pre-award research administrator, a post-award administrator and a research accountant. 
This new team is helpful because the management and tracking of a research project can be a time-consuming process, Maginn said. The fed­eral government requires that research proposals go through Grants.gov -"a really com­plicated software interface," Maginn said. 
Just figuring out how to turn in the proposal can take sev­eral hours, he said. 
"It requires a lot of expert­ise," Maginn said. "The nice

Why I Hate Grey's 

By now, if you're an undergraduate at Notre Dame and don't live in a cave (or perhaps Carroll Hall), undoubtedly you've seen an episode of "Grey's Anatomy," the worst show on television. There are several reasons for hating Tae Andrews this medical drama, but for brevity's sake I'll Scene Editor start with the main reason I despise this show: George. 
George (T.R. Knight) is a simpering, fawning little twerp who spends much of his time growing out his hair, listen­ing to Death Cab for Cutie and lament­ing how hard his life is. Despite having lived with multiple attractive women throughout the course of the show, George has neither the guts nor the game to actually ask said women out and instead spends his free time onscreen trying to act cute and endear­ingly awkward. Quit whining, wimper­ing and generally acting like a little wuss, George. 
The second reason I hate "Grey's Anatomy:" Dr. Meredith Grey herself, quite possibly the most annoying char­acter of all time. In fact, when I heard the news that Grey had possibly died, I rejoiced. No more pretentious ending monologues about the meaning of life. No more whiny soliloquies about the pain of her unrequited love with "McDreamy," and no more on-again, ofl'-again romance with "McDreamy," 
a.k.a. Dr. Shepherd. 
Finally, there's Dr. Yang (Sandra Oh), who manages to irk me almost as mueh as George does through her neurotic, self-important state of perpetual PMS. As unattractive as she is obnoxious, Yang exists on the show only to detract from Dr. Burke (the homophobic Isaiah Washington) and to enrage the audi­ence. 
In addition, "Grey's Anatomy" never fails to deliver with the most ridiculous and inane plot lines. On one episode, a man is suspected of being pregnant before delivering a tumor baby. That's right, a tumor baby. As in a baby­shaped tumor, or perhaps a tumor­shaped baby. Take your pick. Then in another shining moment, two patients found themselves transfixed by a steel pole. Finally, in perhaps the best exam­ple of "Grey's Anatomy's" shining plot lines, one unfortunate patient found himself with a bomb stuck in his stom­ach. You heard me right. A bomb. In. His. Stomach. If only we would be so lucky as for a freak medical accident to wipe out all of the three characters mentioned above, I might even be induced to start watching this show again. 
Even worse is the way "Grey's Anatomy" has affected the male popu­lation on campus. Friends of mine, good guys who normally spend their time reading the Sports Illustrated's (is it porn, is it not?) Swimsuit Edition, watching football, swearing and pursu­ing other manly pursuits, fastidiously set their clocks so they don't (gasp) miss an episode of "Grey's Anatomy." It's time for a gut-check, gentlemen. "Grey's Anatomy" is this year's 'The O.C.": a dying show which needs to be put out its misery. It's about time we pulled the plug on this fiasco.

Peeping Tom in hot water over shampoo camera 
MANCHESTER, Conn. -A man landed in hot water after police say he hid a tiny camera in a shampoo bottle to watch two of his female roommates as they took showers. 
A male roommate, curious why the shampoo wasn't moved for some time, found wires protruding from the back of the bottle, then called police, authorities said. 
The camera recorded through a pinhole, and the images were sent to Steven Thibodeau's television, police said. Thibodeau, 25, had placed the camera to record worship. 

The Rev. Craig X Rubin, 41, is the founder of Temple 420, which holds that pot is a reli­gious herb. 
"Our congregation man­dates members study the Bible, have faith in God and regularly burn the herb cannabis [The Tree of Life mentioned in the Bible] as sacrament," says the lawsuit filed Wednesday in court.

the $65 price tag was too much, especially since a second Notre Dame game isn't guaranteed. 
Although Notre Dame won't be contributirig toward the cost of student tickets, it will provide transportation and food for stu­dents as it did three years ago. McCormack stressed that the buses and the meals come at a significant cost to Notre Dame. 
"We won't even come close to breaking even since there are two buses going up without anybody paying -which is great," McCormack said. "The main thing is to just get a good contingent ... of students, who have been great supporting the team all year." 
The promotions office will send three buses to Friday night's action and, if the Irish win in the first round, to Saturday's game. Although stu­dents could reserve seats on the bus through Thursday for free, the cost for the general public was $25 per person per day, McCormack said. 
McCormack said the cost of each bus would be approxi­mately $1,000 per trip, plus gratuities. He said the promo­tions office has filled one bus with 56 fans from the general public, while about 50 students have reserved seats for Friday and 70 have done it for Saturday. 

And while most of the contin­gent of Irish fans heading up to Grand Rapids on the buses has bought the three-day passes, fans could also buy single-game tickets for $35 through the Van Andel Arena ticket office, where the teams will meet. 
The buses will leave from Gate 4 of the Joyce Center at 2 
p.m. today and 5 p.m. Saturday, provided the top-seeded Irish win their first contest. Notre Dame plays at 5 p.m. today, and McCormack said the buses like­ly would return after the second game tonight, so fans could watch Notre Dame's opponent for Saturday's second round game. But if there is enough demand to return immediately, McCormack said, one bus may return after Notre Dame's game. 
McCormack said Notre Dame initially received 200 tickets from the arena to sell to stu­dents and the public, but the promotions office quickly asked for additional passes because the demand exceeded the sup­ply.

LONDON-Counter-terrorist police arrest­ed three men Thursday in the 2005 suicide attacks on the London transit system, the first major development in the investigation in months. Two of the suspects were detained as they prepared to board a flight to Pakistan. 
The third man was arrested in Leeds -the northern city that was home to three of the four bombers. Police also raided five proper­ties in the city -at least one on the same street where one of the bombers lived. 
"Anybody who imagined that this had sim­ply been treated as four lone wolves or a lone pack of wolves on July 7, 2005 is very wrong," Lord Carlile, the government's inde­pendent reviewer of terror laws, told the British Broadcasting Corp. "There is a lot of work going on." 

Archbishop urges Zimbabwe protest 
HARARE, Zimbabwe -An outspoken Catholic archbishop urged Zimbabweans to fill the streets to protest a surge in state-orchestrated violence, saying Thursday he was willing to lead a campaign of peaceful resistance to force President Robert Mugabe out of office. 
Mugabe's opponents reported that a hospital­ized activist had died of injuries suffered when police fired tear gas, live ammunition and water cannons to stop a March 11 prayer meeting protesting his rule. Police did not confirm the death of Itai Manyeruki, who would be the sec­ond activist to die as a result of violence. Gift Tandare, 31, was fatally shot as the meeting was dispersed.

House postpones vote on DC seat 
WASHINGTON -Legislation to give the District of Columbia a full vote. in the U.S. House stalled Thursday when Republicans unexpectedly injected the volatile issue of gun control. 
Apparently fearful they might lose control of the proceedings, Democrats decided to put off action indefinitely on the voting rights meas­ure, which had appeared to be moving toward passage. 
Republicans protested the delay and sought a quick vote on their attempt to repeal the capi­tal city's ban on handguns. Democratic leaders "shamefully exploited a rule to kill debate and postpone the vote indefinitely,". said Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio. 

Senate defeats Medicare measure 
WASHINGTON -The Senate easily defeat­ed conservative Republicans' efforts to curb the Medicare program's spiraling growth as debate on a $2.9 trillion budget outline for 2008 entered a third day Thursday. 
And a vote is likely Friday on a bid by Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., to increase tobacco taxes to pay for a big boost in a popular pro­gram providing health insurance for children from low-income families. 
On Medicare, the Senate voted 74-23 to dis­miss a bid by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, to trim $34 billion from the program's $2.2 tril­lion budget over the next five years. His plan was aimed at reducing payment increases to Medicare providers and was roughly half the size of the cost curbs President Bush pro­posed in February.

Rocket welcomes U.N. chief to capital 
Ban's first visit to Baghdad marred by insurgent attack near Green Zone 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD -The U.N. chief ducked, as if to find shelter behind the red and white flowers on the podi­um. He narrowed his eyes, and looked left and right. 
Beside him, Iraq's usually dour prime minister didn't even flinch, and managed a slight smile at the startling welcome to Baghdad for 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-nioon. 
The U.N. leader was standing next to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki when a Katyusha rocket exploded about 50 yards from the building in the capital's high-security Green Zone where they were answering questions from reporters. 
Al-Maliki hardly blinked, but Ban -seemingly less accustomed to the tumult of war -quickly crouched, and appeared shaken. The blast came just minutes after al-Maliki said Ban's visit showed Baghdad was "on the road to stability." 
The rocket was fired from a mainly Shiite area on the east bank of the Tigris River, not far from The Associated Press office. The heavily guarded Green Zone on the opposite bank is home to the U.S. Embassy, Iraq's government and the parliament. 
Ban's unannounced stop in the Iraqi capital was the first visit by a U.N. secre­tary-general since Kofi Annan, his predecessor, came to Baghdad in November 2005. The U.N. Security Council issued a statement strongly con­demning the rocket firing as an "abhorrent terrorist attack." 
The U.N. presence in Iraq has been much smaller than planned since militants bombed the organization's Baghdad headquarters on Aug. 19, 2003, and killed 22 people, including the top 
U.N. envoy, Sergio Vieira de Mello. 
That was one of the first major attacks as Sunni Arab insurgents began ral-lying against American forces and other foreign troops after the U.S.-led invasion. Foreign U.N. staff withdrew from Iraq in October 200.3 after a second assault on its offices and other attacks on humanitar­ian workers. A small staff has gradually been allowed to return since August 2004. 


Iraq's Shiite-dominated government has been quiet­ly pushing for a greater 
U.N. role and was banking on decreased violence in the capital to show that it was returning to normal six weeks into a joint security crackdown with American forces. 
"We consider it a positive message to [the] world in which you confirm that Baghdad has returned to playing host to important world figures because it has made huge strides on the road toward stability," al­Maliki told Ban moments before the rocket attack. 
Ban's presence was broadcast after he arrived, but the trip had been kept so secret even his press spokeswoman didn't know he was in Iraq. His public schedule had called for Ban to leave New York on Thursday for a trip to Egypt, Israel and an African Union summit in Saudi Arabia. 
The U.S. military announced three Americans died in combat Wednesday -an Army soldier slain in Baghdad and another sol­dier and a Marine killed in Anbar province. At least 44 Iraqis were killed or found dead Thursday, including 25 bodies dumped in the capital, all showing signs of torture, police said. 

The military also reported a major breakthrough in the campaign against rogue Shiite militants, saying it captured two brothers responsible for a sneak attack Jan. 20 that killed five U.S. soldiers guarding the provincial headquarters in Karbala, a city 50 miles south of Baghdad.

Edwards presses on with campaign 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Democrat John Edwards said Thursday that his presidential campaign "goes on strongly" in the face of a repeat cancer diagnosis for his wife, Elizabeth, a somber development that thrust his White House bid into uncharted territory. 
The couple revealed that Elizabeth Edwards' breast cancer had spread to her bone during a news conference designed to reas­sure the public about the prognosis for her health and his candidacy. 
"The bottom line is, her cancer is back," said John Edwards, the 2004 vice presidential nominee and for­mer senator, at a news conference in their hometown of Chapel Hill, 

N.C. "We are very optimistic about this, because having been through some struggles together in the past, we know that the key is to keep your head up and keep moving and be strong." . 
The Edwardses suffered through the death of their teenage son, Wade, in 1996 and Mrs. Edwards' breast cancer diagnosis the day after John Kerry and John Edwards lost the 2004 election. She was treated with surgery and several months of radiation and chemotherapy. 
The recurrence of the cancer presents a setback for the couple, both personally and politically. 
"Getting these .results was not a good day for us," John Edwards allowed. 
Elizabeth Edwards' illness and treatment are certain to affect her husband's campaign schedule and may raise questions about the via­bility of his campaign, especially among financial donors wondering whether he will be in for the long haul. The first fundraising deadline is fast approaching on March 31.

thing about this [new system] is that people with this expertise ·are being dedicated to that," he said. 
Each faculty researcher works with a pre-award admin­istrator, a post-award adminis­trator and a research account­ant at different stages in the development of research proj­ects. 
The pre-award administrator helps the researcher with the parts of the proposal that do not directly involve the "sci­ence." Once the grant is obtained, the post-award administrator takes over and aids the researcher in the administration of the project. The accountant takes charge of managing the money that the researcher obtains from the grant. 
Now that the Office of Research assigns administra­tors to be "partners" with the faculty -rather than overseers of their progress -it is reliev­ing the faculty from much of the burden of handling the admin­istrative aspects of their research projects, Maginn said. 
"Any time you can take some of the administrative burden off the faculty and let the faculty do the research part and not have to do the administrative part, you are going to be more productive," he said. "The idea is, if you can make the faculty more productive, they can spend more time with students and doing research and not doing accounting and book­keeping." 
Since the new business sys­tem was started, Maginn said he has submitted six proposals for research grants -including three in the past week. And, he said, the process of submitting these last six "definitely" went much faster than before the implementation of the new business system. 
New software 

The second new initiative is the implementation of a new software program from InfoEd, a company that makes an inte­grated software package that can manage the whole research process, Maginn said. The research admin­istrators can use

Notre Dame developed from discussions about how "to streamline the process and become paperless," said Michael Edwards, director of the Office of Research. 
Since many federal govern­ment agencies have converted -and many are planning to convert -to an eleCtronic for­mat for grant proposal submis­sions. Notre Dame needed to implement a new system to adjust to this change, he said. 
The Office of Research began the 18-month long implementa~ tion process at the start of the 
These two new initiatives sig­nal a step forward in Notre Dame's ambitious effort to join the ranks of top-tier research institutions, an objective University President. Father John Jenkins described in his address to the faculty last fall and which Provost Tom Burish echoed in a subsequent address. 
Jenkins told faculty members that Notre Dame has made sig­nificant strides in research in the past several years but said the University has the potential to rise much higher in the rank­ings of top research universi­ties. 
Now that the Office of Research operates under this new business model and with the scheduled implementation of new software, Edwards said he is confident that the number of research grant proposals will increase. 
Every research administrator in the Office of Research can handle 200 proposals a year, Edwards said, so the office will be able to process up to 1,200 proposals a year. This year between 800 and 900 proposals will be submitted, he said. 
"We fully expect that the number of proposals will increase," Edwards said. "We expect the number of awards to increase." 
Maginn said the new initia­tives ·streamline the administra­tive aspects of the research process -an improvement to the infrastructure that is vital for Notre Dame to improve its reputation as a research uni­versity. 
"The analogy is that if we want to have a good football program, we need to have good facilities for the football team," he said. "If you want to have a great research university, you have to have great research infrastructure. A big part of that is supporting the people who get the grants to pay for the research." 
Terri Hall, the associate director of pre-award teams, said since the new business process was started in December, the reaction from faculty members has been "very, very encouraging."

IN BRIEF Blackstone Group plans to go public 
NEW YORK-Blackstone Group LP, one of the world's biggest private equity firms, on Thursday said it seeks to raise up to $4 billion in a highly anticipated initial public offering. 
The New York-based firm, known for multibil­lion dollar takeovers like February's $23 billion buyout of Equity Office Properties, announced its intentions to go public in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Blackstone -founded in 1985 by former Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankers Stephen Schwarzman and Pete Peterson -said the initial public offering will allow it to tap new sources of capital for buyouts. In addition, it helps extend Blackstone's brand name and gives management a way to profit from the increased value of their stakes. 
Stocks mixed, investors await data 
NEW YORK -Wall Street finished mixed Thursday, nudging the Dow Jones industrials higher for a fourth straight session but moving cautiously as investors awaited new data to assess whether their hopes for an interest rate cut are justified. 
A surprise warning that cell phone maker Motorola Inc. will post a loss for the first quar­ter also made the market uneasy as it looked ahead to earnings reports that begin next month. 
Investors seemed uncertain about where to take stocks a day after the Federal Reserve issued an economic assessment interpreted as opening up the possibility of a reduction in short-term rates. The statement unleashed a wave of buying that boosted the Dow by 159 points Wednesday, but Thursday's session was erratic, with the Dow weaving in and out of positive territory throughout the day. 
Investors remained optimistic about the statement but reined in their buying as they took note of climbing energy costs, which made it look unlikely that inflation will cool enough to provoke a rate cut, and as market experts debated whether the Fed's slight change in language truly suggested a shift in policy. 
"At the end of the day, I don't think it means a heck of a lot," said Stephen Massocca, presi­dent of Pacific Growth Equities. "The market received it very, very well, but ultimately the Fed is news-dependent." 


EU backs aviation deal with U.S. 
"Open Skies" deal will open up restricted trans-Atlantic routes March 2008

BRUSSELS, Belgium - 
The European Union

Jenkins, Senate to be commended 
Student government meetings are often a lot of words and little action, but at Wednesday's session of Student Senate, that was the goal -and it was a positive conversation, not a frustrating imbalance.

Senators peppered Jenkins with queries ranging from why sexual orientation has not been added to the University's anti-discrimination policy to why tuition continues to rise. To their credit, the senators were persistent, asking follow-up questions after Jenkins had given his original answer.

The administration may or may not take steps to try to reduce debt in the future, but it was important that students brought the issue to Jenkins' attention in an atmos­phere of mutual respect. 
That respect is essential, and the openness and candor from the administration and student government is refresh­ing. If both parties continue to engage in constructive dia­logue, the entire campus community will benefit.

Our reputation: a sobering reality 
Eight. Four. One.

lems here were that  Megan  
easy).Unfortunately, that  Rybarczyk  
is not the case, and  Guest  
this bad dream is  Columnist  
actually a nightmare.  

Eight is the number of students (to the best of my knowledge) who paid their respects to the Emergency Room in a local hospital last semester in one night due to intoxication. Four is the number of times I nearly stepped in vomit on various sidewalks on campus one Sunday morning a few weeks ago. And one? One is a number I hope we can avoid. 
I recently had two discussions, one with a local health care employee who works in the emergency room where I volunteer on Saturday mornings and one with an alumnus of the university. Like any other student, I was proud to say that I am attending Notre Dame. Unfortunately, while I was expecting the usual congratulations and admiration, what I received may have been likened to disgust and disappointment. I would like to say that I was shocked to learn of our notoriety on account of the extracur­ricular activities on campus, but after volunteering in that particular Emergency Room for a third semester, I was not. Employees at this particular facility strongly dislike (I believe the word "hate" was actually used ... ) stu­dents from Notre Dame due to their fre­quent presence in that establishment as a result of intoxication. You know, it really is quite difficult to adequately take care of legitimately ill individuals when there are eight intoxicated students to deal with throughout the night as well. 
Now that I have addressed the disgust (I will spare you my own personal dis­gust experienced during my Sunday morning walk), I will discuss the disap­pointment I encountered. My conversa­tion with the alumnus also revealed a great deal about how we are viewed from the community. This person informed me of his disappointment of the toleration of alcohol on campus and the lack of adequate surveillance and disciplinary action for intoxication to such extremes. It disappointed him to see our reputation falling and such intel­ligent student make such decisions to place their lives and the lives of others at risk. 

For example, when a friend told me that some alcohol that he/she had con­sumed was absolutely terrible and I inquired as to his/her reasons for contin­uing to consume it in large quantities in light of that fact, the unfulfilling response I received was, "I don't know." 
Yes, I understand that the majority of the students here take on a great amount of stress, and, for some reason, many think that alcohol is a way to relieve stress, have fun, open up, to be more social, etc. But, what kinds of rea­sons are these for such dangerous extremes? Will these be adequate to explain the fate of the one? 
You may say that I am exaggerating, but the odds favor this potential fate as a result of the direction in which we are heading. I have brought up the issue of our reputation, but so much more is at stake. Please be responsible and do not make me encounter the one in the Emergency Room who will never be able to answer my question, "Why?"

A princess of our time 
At this month's news release in New Orleans, Disney announced its first-ever black princess. According to the Disney Web site, the movie, The Frog Princess, will be set in New Orleans where Maddy, the princess, will be living amid the charming elegance and grandeur of the fabled French Quarter. 
Maddy will be added to the list of the Staff Editorial other Disney princesses and also used at the theme parks and in consumer products. Illinois State 
Not only is this a first for the company, The Daily with a black princess as the main charac­Vidette ter, but they have also announced the return of the hand-drawn animation rather than computer animated. 
It's nice that Disney is going back to its hand-drawn style for this film. This way it'll be easier to group this film with 
the older "original" movies. And looking back on this film years from now, hopefully people will also consider it a clas­sic. 
This new movie idea was sparked when parents began put­ting pressure on the company to make a character that was not white like the majority of other princesses in the past, with the exceptions of Pocahontas and Jasmine. 
It's hard to say though if children know, or even care, about the color of the character's skin. Most children are interested in the story line and not so much with what the characters look like. 
Given the choice though, a young black girl could be more likely to choose a black doll over a white one at the Disney Store, which she could more easily relate to because of the similar skin color. 
While this push for a black princess came from mostly par­ents wanting equal time for the races in these movies, we too agree that it's about time. We live in a world where diversity is a huge issue. 
And because Disney has one of the biggest influences on kids today, it is important that they have made this choice. 
The company already has shows on television that feature black characters, such as "That's So Raven," and we are sure that most kids watching the show aren't thinking, "She's black." 
Even some of the cartoons they have produced feature black characters, so the release of the movie shouldn't be such a big deal right? 
One of the things that could spark further debate or ques­tioning is the setting for this film. While other Disney classics have a broader setting and aren't really clear, this one has a defined place for the action to happen. 
We're hoping that the issues of race are not one this princess will have to face in her movie, and it will be interest­ing to see what kind of problems they give this young girl to overcome. It's just kind of strange to see this movie coming out so soon, after all the events that have taken place in New Orleans in the past years. 
Hopefully most families will enjoy this movie and see it as a classic story rather than a movie about the struggles of a black princess.

DVD REVIEWS 
1 Bicycle Thieves' gets new DVD treatment 
By RAMA GOTTUMUKKALA 
Scene Writer 
Following World War II, hopefulness was in short supply across Europe. The conti­nent was in ruins, and countries could no longer afford to entertain their citizens with escapist cinema. Out of this despair came a movement that irrevocably changed global cinema-Italian neorealism. 
From the many notable films of this movement, one in particular -"Bicycle Thieves," Vittorio De Sica's masterful 1948 tale -has withstood the test of time. Its intimately detailed story of a father and son chasing down their stolen bicycle remains as powerful today as it was nearly 60 years ago. Tales of impoverishment, a popular topic in Hollywood and world cinema at this time, had never felt this raw or palpable. 
The story of "Bicycle Thieves" is a simple one, but its deep emotions keep it from ever becoming simplistic. Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) struggles to provide for his family at a time when jobs were scarcer than hope. Against all odds, he gets a coveted position putting up posters around the city, a task that requires a bicy­cle. Scrapped for money, Ricci's wife even sells the family bed sheets to buy the cycle. Hope seems just around the comer. 
But when a pack of thieves steal the bike, the family's livelihood, Ricci enlists the help of his young, impressionable son Bruno (Enzo Staiola). Together, they scour the streets of Rome in a frantic search. 
The pioneers of Italian neorealism fol­lowed one mantra: "We must capture life as it is." They used amateur actors like Maggiorani and Staiola to invest true emo­tion into their pieces, shooting on location in every corner of Italy and telling stories about the working class. Minimalist story­telling revealed the truest of feelings. 
As with most socially conscious fare, "Bicycle Thieves" is not an entertaining film. But that never diminishes its power. Unlike the self-importance that seeps from many Best Picture winners, "Thieves" never feels like a morality play. Part of this stems from its simplicity, but mostly it's because Ricci and Bruno captivate our emotions. 
Like many films from the period, "Bicycle Thieves" has suffered in its video releases. The Criterion Collection recently released a beautiful two-disc set of' the film, complete with a 75-page commemo­rative booklet. The ftrst DVD of "Thieves" 
suffered from horrible 


video quality, marred by scratches, dirt and general wear. With
Bicycle Thieves 
this release, Criterion has drasticallyThe Criterion 
improved the audio and video quality.
Collection 
Although some seg­ments still suffer from scratches, it's unlikely the material can ever look better on a DVD release. 


As for the supplements, Criterion has assembled three impressive documentaries for the second disc. Collecting interviews from actors, screenwriters and scholars, they offer a glut of information about De Sica, screenwriter Cesare Zavattini, the Italian neorealist movement and the film's place among the best films of that era. The only regrettable omL<>sion is a commentary. 
Criterion recruits top scholars to com­ment on some of the most significant films ever made, but not "Bicycle Thieves". It seems incomprehensible that a scholar couldn't be found to shed light on this film. 
Critics of the movie often complain that nothing happens in "Bicycle Thieves." What they don't realize is the payoff to "Thieves" isn't whether Bruno and Ricci catch the thieves. More than just a bicycle, father and son are chasing down a far more tenuous commodity in these lean times -hope. Hope for the future and for their lives, how­ever small they may seem after the destruc­tion of the war. 
Like so much of life, it's the journey in "Bicycle Thieves" -not the destination ­that matters most.

Cohen amuses, challenges Americans with 'Borat' 
By MARTY SCHROEDER Assistant Scene Editor 
Two words describe the "Borat" DVD ­"very niiice." The DVD release of the filrn that took the United States by storm marks the entrance of Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat into the homes of America. The over-the­top "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan" is a hilarious, campy and sub­tly intelligent film that comes in a decent package. 
When the case of the "Borat" DVD is opened, it's obvious that Cohen (or the maker of the DVD) is up to his old tricks. The actual DVD resembles a homemade copy, with "Borat" written out in what looks like Sharpie marker (complete with backwards 'R'). Aside from the creative packaging, the menu is one of the most original and clever in recent memory. 
With a full chorus belting out (Cohen's version oO the Kazakh National Anthem, the menu looks like something made in a basement video production house. Sporting dancing bear heads, the menu looks fuzzy and grainy -exactly what an American audience thinks of when the words "Soviet of the film is one of criticism and exposi­tion of the ills of American society. Borat may make us uncomfortable -or make us laugh uncomfortably. In the end, America needs Borat to show us what we can change and make better. 

Propaganda" are mentioned. It is the rare DVD that warrants commentary on its menu, but "Borat" certainly deserves lau­rels for its creative presentation. 
The film itself is the DVD's real gem. The character of Borat was created by Brit Cohen for his television program, "Da Ali G Show." Along with gangsta Ali G and flam­boyant Austrian fashion reporter Bruno, Kazakh journalist Borat forms the comedic trinity of Cohen. He first released a film based around Ali G entitled "Ali G Indahouse." "Borat," the second film released by Cohen, follows the eponymous journalist around the United States as he tries to learn what makes America great. 
The anti-Semitic and misogynistic Borat causes quite a stir wherever he goes. In particular, one of the most entertaining ­and mind opening -parts of Borat occurs when he angers a crowd at a small town rodeo. Falling right into his ploy, the local NBC affiliate actually covered the story before the release of the film, thinking that Cohen was serious. 
The newscast can be accessed in the extras as part of the deleted scenes. While it probably would have detract­ed from the film, this scene epitomizes what "Borat" is trying to do. 
The main trajectory 


The DVD is a single disc with some rather good extras. The "National P.R. Tour" section includes the appearance of Borat at film premieres and on both Conan O'Brien and Jay Lena's late night shows. The "Jay Leno" bit includes a scene where Martha Stewart tries to teach Borat how to make a bed. Needless to say, the scene ends with Borat in the bed sans undergar­ments. 
Other deleted scenes round out the extras on the DVD. This film, however, deserves a larger version. 
The video transfer is very good and the 5.1 audio mix performs well. This isn't a film that needs the expansive 5.1 mix, but it's good nonetheless. 
What makes Cohen's work so great is its ability to make Americans howl with laugh­ter at themselves. Even though he did face legal repercussions regarding some of the scenes, he shows America a side of itself that it rarely sees -or rarely wants to see. But, as "Borat" shows, we might as well laugh while we see it.

DVD REVIEW 

Wayne, 'Searchers' shine in two-disc release 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Editor 
When "The Searchers" was released over 50 years ago, it was seen as just another John Ford western. Starring John Wayne and featuring the Southwest's iconic Monument Valley, it didn't seem overly dif­ferent from other Ford features like "Stagecoach" or "Fort Apache." 
Yet years after its release, "The Searchers" can be regarded as not only Ford's fmest film, but one of the greatest and most influential pictures of all time. Available for years only as a single-disc DVD, it has recently been re-mastered and released by Warner Bros. in a special edi­tion to commemorate its 50th anniversary. 
French New Wave directors such as Jean­Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut cited "The Searchers" as an example of exempla­ry American filmmaking, and it remains one of Ford's most enduring works. It was also a major thematic basis for "Taxi Driver," and its dark undercurrent and technical mastery won it many supporters in the years after its release. 
"The Searchers" is the story of Ethan Edwards (John Wayne), a Civil War veteran who sets off with his nephew Martin (Jeffrey Hunter) and a search party to res­cue his niece, who was kidnapped by a Native American tribe. The trip takes years; and as it progresses, Martin begins to see the depth of Ethan's obsession. 
Ethan Edwards is perhaps the greatest of all of John Wayne's roles -an erstwhile war veteran and anti-hero whose vigilante­like obsession drives him to complete his quest, no matter how futile it seems. 
He anchors the picture throughout, which is especially evident in the fmal iconic shot of Wayne in a darkened doorway, overlook­ing the endless desert. The shot serves to emphasize the differentiation between Edwards and the ordinary folk who popu­late the rest of the film. 
Warner's special edition of "The Searchers" has been long overdue, though it was released last year specifically to coincide with its 50th anniversary. A major step up from the original single-disc release, the new edition is superior to the old in 
every way. 
Foremost, the pic­ture quality is stun­ning-Warner has taken major steps to restore the film, and it shows. Ford shot "The Searchers" in "Vistavision" and Technicolor, and the image pops off the screen. This is the best that "The Searchers" has looked 

A Note to a Select Group of Literary Figures: 
Greetings, my dears. My name is Analise, and I have been a faithful reader of your respective works for quite some time. I'm writing to you not as a critic, but as a friend. We've had some great times together ­lazy summer after­noons in the sun, indoor recesses of yore, even whole rainy days spent in each other's company. I love you all for various rea­sons, but I'm of the opinion that in every good, loving relation­ship, one needs honest and open commu­nication to keep things running smoothly. In that light, I have to tell you guys the truth. 
It's not me -it's you. 
As awesome as you are, each in your own way, you have some issues that need to be addressed. Therefore, I've taken it upon myself to enlighten you as to how you've been frustrating me and other readers with bad decisions and general naivete. 
Call them instructions, tips or nuggets of wizened advice, but I suggest that you pay close attention. Your future fans will thank me. 
I have to say, Jane Eyre, that I do love your novel. That, however, doesn't excuse your general lack of a personality. Yes, you're a vivid personification of Victorian morality, and you're a nice person, sure, but even those strengths don't excuse the fact that you almost married your cousin because you couldn't speak up for your­self. Also, I suggest investing in some fireproof belongings -you and your Byronic-Hero-of-a-husband will thank me later. 

To Elizabeth Bennett of "Pride and Prejudice," I only have one suggestion. Nip the Mr. Collins issue in the bud as quickly as possible. Nothing says "romance-killer" like a nervous clergy­man with a penchant for accidentally insulting people. 
And to Mr. Collins himself, "no" actual­ly does mean "no," especially in the case of a proposal of marriage. Save yourself the humiliation, man. It's for your own good. Now shoo. 
A general point of advice to Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov, Shakepeare's Hamlet and other loquacious leading men -stop talking. Or at least cut back a bit on the excessive speeches that you all feel compelled to make. To Raskolnikov, especially, I suggest a little less introspection. You should get out more. 
The same goes for you, Emily Dickinson. The sun is a good thing. As is proper punctuation, but we can deal with that later. 
Disney's Thumper got it right the first time, Emma Woodhouse -ifyou can't say something nice, don't say anything at all. 
And Beowulf. Fighting beasts at your age? Shame on you. I understand that you have ego issues that even Freud did­n't see coming. But the Geats need you. 
Or, at least, they need you to stay alive for another few months without being fatally scorched by dragon breath. 
Also, just because Moby Dick emascu­lated you so cruelly by taking your leg, Captain Ahab, doesn't mean you have the right to risk the lives of everyone else you know by rabidly following the Great White Whale. I suggest some sort of grief counseling or anger management semi­nar. 
Lastly, as a general announcement to Gilbert Blythe of "Anne of Green Gables" -what do you think ofjumping off of the page and into the three-dimensional world? You'd be surprised at what sci­ence can accomplish these days. 
I hope that these tips can help you all deal with your issues, and I wish you the best in your future literary endeavors. Just no badly-written sequels or pre­quels, please. I don't need to see "The Scarlet B" in my local bookstore anytime soon. 
Faithfully yours in reading,

since its original release, and it accentuates the film's cinematography. The sound comes in the original mono, which is a solid track -often these are re-mastered in a digital 5.1 version, but Warner wisely retained the sound as it was first heard. 
The extra features include a commentary by director Peter Bogdanovich. Unfortunately, both Ford and Wayne have passed on, but the remaining features showcase both prominently. 
There are three documentaries featured: "The Searchers: An Appreciation," "A Turning of the Earth: John Ford, John Wayne and The Searchers" and "Behind the Cameras: Meet Jeffrey Hunter, Monument Valley, Meet Natalie Wood, Setting Up Production." All three are insightful and extensive, with a surprising amount of background detail. 
Fifty years after its original release, "The Searchers" has only grown in stature. As an iconic piece of American cinema, and per­haps the greatest western of all time, its reputation will surely continue to grow over the next half century. Warner has fmally given the film the release it deserves, which makes it a rich and important addition to any film library.

MINNEAPOLIS -With Kentucky fans dogging him after another disappointing fmish, Tubby Smith is bolt­ing the bluegrass for Minnesota. 
Smith will be introduced as the 16th coach of the Golden Gophers at a noon press conference Friday, ending a 10-year tenure in Lexington that seemed to be nearing an end even before Minnesota contacted him. 
The Wildcats went 22-12 this season and made it to the NCAA tournament, but lost to top-seeded Kansas in the second round, turning up the heat on the coach of college basketball's win­ningest program. 

Smith led Kentucky to the national championship in his first season in 1998, but the Wildcats haven't been back to the Final Four since, their longest drought since the NCAA tournament began. The team has lost 10 or more games in a sea­son five times under his watch, prompting the demanding fan base to nickname him "10-loss Tubby." 
"On behalf of the University of Kentucky, I'd like to express sincere appreciation to Tubby Smith, his family and his staff," Kentucky athletic director Mitch Barnhart said in a statement. "We wish him the very best at the University of Minnesota. They are getting a solid coach and a great person." 
Minnesota was 9-22 this season, the most losses in the 111-year history of the program, and averaged just 
60.6 points a game, its low­est in 56 years. Former coach Dan Monson was forced to resign seven games into this season with a 118-106 record in eight seasons. 
Thursday morning, Minnesota asked for Barnhart's permission to talk to Smith, said Kentucky basketball spokesman Scott Stricklin.

IN BRIEF 
Artest pleads not guilty to 
charges of battery 
AUBURN, Calif.-Sacramento Kings forward Ron Artest pleaded not guilty Thursday to misdemeanor charges stemming from a domestic dispute with his wife earlier this month. 
A Placer County Superior Court judge also ordered him to stay at least 100 yards away from his wife and chil­dren until further notice. 
Artest's attorney, William Portanova, entered pleas of not guilty to charges of battery and corporal injury to a spouse, false imprisonment and dis­suading a witness from reporting a crime. 
The former Indiana Pacers player sat in the audience section of the small courtroom among other defendants and members of the media. He spoke only when asked direct questions by Judge Francis Kearney, responding no when asked if he owned firearms and yes when asked if he understood the conditions of the restraining order. 

Peyton Mannin_g to star on 
"saturday Night uve" 
INDIANAPOLIS -"Saturday Night Live" is just another game for Peyton Manning. . 
He'll dress up, work with his team­mates and audible at every opportuni­ty. Then the Super Bowl MVP hopes it all works in perfect concert -which, of course, it never does on live televi­sion. Or minus receivers Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne. 
"The only thing I've done live is play football, and that's the best thing I do," Manning said. ''I've told everyone those commercials are very taped and very edited, but being live is kind of like a game." 
Manning has dared to dress up before, donning wigs and mustaches to poke fun at himself.Thankfully, the straight-laced Indianapolis Colts quar­terback with a mind that always seems immersed in football has always had someone there to protect his polished image. 
up to the standard set by the man he replaced at Kentucky. Rick Pitino became a legend in Lexington, leading the Wildcats to three Final Fours, including the 1996 national title and the 1997 championship game, before leaving to coach the Boston Celtics. 
Wildcats fans grew even more restless when Pitino returned to the state of Kentucky, leading rival Louisville to the 2005 Final Four. 
"In our league, we have passionate fans that want to see success," said SEC commissioner Mike Slive about the expectations at Kentucky. 
This week, Manning must do it himself. Papelbon returns to Red Sox bullpen as closer 
The Boston Red Sox suddenly have a closer again. Same one as last season. 
Jonathan Papelbon is switching back to the bullpen, filling a major void for Boston after spending most of spring training preparing to be a starting pitcher. But he said the move has nothing to do with the fact that Mike Timlin's injury left the Red Sox in dire need of late­inning relief. 
"This is something I want to do for the rest of my career," Papelbon said Thursday. "It has nothing to do with Timlin's health or us not having a closer or my shoulder. I broke into the league as a closer. They drafted me as a clos­er. In college, I learned to pitch in the bullpen. It's where my heart is."

CRICKET 
Pakistani coach killed after loss in World Cup 
Cricket coach's death may be gambling-related 


AP Pakistani Cricket captain lnzamam-ui-Haq, right, and manager Talat Ali mourn their deceased coach, Bob Woolmer. 
Associated Press 
KINGSTON, Jamaica Pakistan's cricket coach Bob Woolmer was strangled in his hotel room after the team's shocking World Cup loss to Ireland, police said Thursday. 
Police Commissioner Lucius Thomas said in a statement that the pathologist report found Bob Woolmer's death was due to "asphyxia as a result of manual strangulation." 
The statement, which was read by a police spokesman at the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel where Woolmer was killed on Sunday, said police were now treating the case as a murder investigation. Police said they were reviewing security cameras at the hotel and seeking witnesses to the crime. 
"It is our belief that those asso­ciated with or having access with Mr. Woolmer may have vital information to assist this inquiry," Thomas said in the statement. 
Woolmer, 58, was found uncon­scious in his blood-and vomit­splattered hotel room in Jamaica on Sunday, a day after his team's upset loss to Ireland on St. Patrick's Day sealed Pakistan's ouster from the tournament. He was later declared dead at a hos­pital. 
Pakistan cricketers were fin­gerprinted and interviewed on Thursday by police investigating his death. They were allowed to leave the hotel in the afternoon and travel to Montego Bay. 
No arrests have been made and there are no suspects in the case, police said. 
It was not clear if the team would be asked to remain in Jamaica pending the investiga­tion, but Mark Shields, a deputy police commissioner at the press conference, said the players have pledged full cooperation whether they are on the Caribbean island or back home in Pakistan. 
Earlier Thursday, Assistant Police Commissioner Les Green, formerly of Scotland Yard, said the team was fingerprinted as part of standard procedure "to eliminate persons from finger­prints which would be found in the room." 
"After a thorough investigation, fmgerprints not belonging to Mr. Woolmer were found in the room," he told The Associated Press. 
On Wednesday, a forensics team spent hours combing Woolmer's room on the 12th floor of the hotel in Kingston. 
Investigators had called in an American pathologist to help determine the cause of death amid local media reports that Woolmer had been strangled. An initial autopsy was inconclusive. 
Shields declined to comment when asked about media reports describing the condition of Woolmer's body. "There are some issues surrounding marks on his body, but for the moment I would rather we stick to the cause of death, which is asphyxia," he said. 
Woolmer's wife, Gill, said Thursday in an interview from South Africa with Britain's Sky TV that she had not ruled out that her husband was murdered. 
"I mean some of the cricketing fraternity, fans are extremely volatile and passionate about the game and what happens in the game, and also a lot of it in Asia, so I suppose there is always the possibility that it could be that (murder)," she said. 
Former Pakistani player Sarfraz Nawaz speculated earlier in the week that the coach was killed by gambling interests. 
But his widow said her hus­band had not recently mentioned anything about match fixing. He had been South Africa's coach in the 1990s when the team's cap­tain, Hansie Cronje, admitted taking money to fix matches and was banned for life. Woolmer was never implicated. 
Lord Paul Congdon, head of the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit, will investi­gate if corruption played a role in Woolmer's death, ICC chief exec­utive Malcolm Speed said. 
Woolmer's death has caused a sensation in the proper world of cricket and left the Pakistan national team in tatters and tears. Team captain Inzamam-ul­Haq announced his resignation and retirement from one-day cricket after Woolmer's death, then led Pakistan to an emotional victory Wednesday against Zimbabwe. A fan at the match hoisted a sign saying: "Do it for Bob." 
The burly, bearded team cap­tain left the field weeping after the victory he dedicated to Woolmer. "He's not in this world now and every Pakistani and every cricket lover is sad," he said. 
Woolmer, who is British, was born in India, played for England and recently split his time between Pakistan and South Africa.

Oden seals Ohio State win 
Buckeye center's block as time expires gives OSU 85-84 victory 
Associated Press 

SAN ANTONIO -Maybe now folks will realize there's more to Ohio State than Greg Oden. 
The big man finally looked like a freshman, getting mired in foul trouble as the top-seed­ed Buckeyes fell bPhind by 20 points before halrtime. But senior Hon Lewis and fellow freshman Mike Conley bailed out Oden and lifted Ohio State past Tennessee, 85-84 Thursday night in the semifi­nals of the NCAA South Hegional. 
"In this tournament, the two most important words are 'survive' and 'advance,' and we've been very, very fortu­nate the last couple of games to do those things," said Buckeyes coach Thad Matta, whose club needed a furious final minute and overtime to get past Xavier in the second round. 
Lewis, who hit the big 3­pointer in the Xavier rally, scored 18 of his 25 points in the second half and Conley had nine of his 17 from the foul line -including the winner with 6.5 seconds left. 
But Conley missed a second shot, giving Tennessee one last chance. Ramar Smith grabbed the rebound and went all the way to the rim with Conley defending him. They went up together and time expin~d with his ball in the air. 
Then it was Oden to the res­cue, swatting the ball into the Volunteers' cheerleaders and dropping back to earth himself with his biggest smile of the night, while Smith planted himself facedown in front of the Tennessee bench. 
The Buckeyes (33-3) won their 20th straight game, keep­ing alive their longest run in the tournament since reaching the Final Four in 1999. They can get there again with a vic­tory Saturday against Memphis, a 65-64 winner over Texas A&M earlier Thursday. 
For the Volunteers (24-11), this was a second straight heartbreaking loss to one of the nation's top teams. The first was a 68-66 defeat in Columbus, Ohio, in mid­January when Oden had the first breakout game of his career. 
"We played about as well in the first half, I think, as we can

play," Tennessee coach Bruce Pearl said. "We're terribly dis­appointed. We've proven we can beat some of the best teams in the country. We've also proven we can come close to beating some of the best teams in the country." 
The 7 -foot, 270-pound Oden scored only nine points, matching his lowest in 15 games, and set a season-low with three rebounds. He never fouled out, though, needing quick substitutions in the final few minutes to avoid getting disqualified. He played only nine minutes in each half, a season-low total of 18. 
After the game, Oden needed stitches in his chin because of a collision during the second half.

MLB 
Prior's latest start positive 
Oft-injured pitcher throws four innings, gives up four hits 
Associated Press 
PEORIA, Ariz. --Mark Prior 
had his best outing of the spring. 
Whether he'll start the season on 
the Chicago Cubs' active roster is 
still unclear. 
With the rotation pretty much 
set a week before the Cubs break 
camp and with Wade Miller the 
top candidate to be the fifth 
starter, there might not be a spot 
for Prior. At least not right away. 
"He threw the ball better, that's the most important thing. A really nice step forward for him," man­ager Lou Piniella said after Prior's ·four-inning outing Thursday in a 1-0 loss to the San Diego Padres. "I think the idea of not rushing him, giving him time, it's the right 
tonic." 
Prior gave up four straight two­
out singles in the first -the only 
four hits he allowed. But he sur­
rendered only one run, thanks to 
a nice throw to the plate from left 
fielder Matt Murton to cut down a 
runner. 
Prior threw 59 pitches, walked 
two and struck out three. He 
whizzed a fastball by Khalil 
Greene for the final out in the 
third. He hit 89 mph with his 
fastest pitch in a game called 
after five innings because of rain. 
Prior was making just his third 
appearance and second start of 
the spring and has now worked 
only 7 1-3 innings. That's well 
below the 25 to 27 innings 
Piniella said he wanted to give his 
starters. 
"I felt good and the arm feels 
great," Prior said. "There weren't

When Prior completed his fourth inning by slipping a called third strike past former teammate Greg Maddux, he walked off the field and was greeted by a hand­shake and pat on the back from pitching coach Larry Rothschild. Prior entered the game with an 0­1 record and 18.90 ERA in two short outings. He'd also pitched four innings last week in an intrasquad game. 
Maddux was sharp in his first start against a major league line­up since March 8. The right-han­der held the Cubs to three hits in five shutout innings. Maddux pitched against Texas Rangers minor leaguers on Saturday. He skipped his previous start with a lower abdominal strain. 
"I felt pretty good," Maddux said. "You'd like to get a little bet­ter each time out." 
Prior's performance Thursday came after Piniella said before the game that Miller was pretty much -but not 100 percent-set as the No. 5 starter, joining the rota­tion of Carlos Zambrano, Ted Lilly, Jason Marquis and Rich Hill. 
But not so fast. 
"We'll see where we go from here. But obviously it was an improvement and I'm happy to see it," Piniella said after the game, adding that Prior was able to get his breaking pitch over and also looked more comfortable on the mound. 
Piniella said he didn't know if Prior would pitch again this spring. 

emphasizes defense all year long and we showed it pays to be physical." 
The second-seeded Bruins (29-5) never trailed in the grind-it-out game that matched Howland against his best friend and former assis­tant, Jamie Dixon. With teams using the same tight defensive style, sometimes the only way to score was when the shots weren't contested. 
That's just what Arron Afflalo and the Bruins did. Affialo made all 10 of his free throws and UCLA shot 23-for­26 from the line, scoring 12 of its final 18 points on foul shots. 
"We did a great job to knock 

down free throws, and it's a 
good thing we did because we 
weren't scoring a lot," for­
ward Josh Shipp said. "I think 
we're just getting down to 
business and focusing on free 
throws." 
Third-seeded Pitt (29-8) cut 

a 12-point lead down to five 
when Levance Fields hit a 
pair of 3s and Ronald Ramon 
added another in an 88-sec­
ond span, but Michael Roll's 
baseline jumper with 51.5 
seconds left put the Bruins up 
58-51. 
"We never really pulled away," Afflalo said. "That team kept competing and they did a great job staying in the game. We were very fortunate tonight." 
The Bruins advanced to 

play Kansas (33-4) in 
Saturday's regional final in a 
matchup of two of college 
basketball's most storied 
teams. The top-seeded 
Jayhawks beat Southern 
Illinois 61-58 ih the first game 
in San Jose. 
Afflalo finished with 17 

points, going 3-for-11 from 
the floor in another poor 
shooting night. Shipp added 
16 and Collison had 12 as the 
Bruins advanced to regional 
finals in consecutive years for 
the first time since 1979-80. 
Ramon scored 12 points to lead the Panthers, who lost in the regional semifinals for the fourth time in six seasons. They haven't been to the round of eight since 1974, when it took only two wins to get there. Fields added 11 
"Our defense 

was spectacular tonight," Howland said. "It had to be or we weren't going to win this game." 
Shipp, who missed the Bruins' run to the title game a year ago because of a hip injury, hit two key 3-pointers early in the half. The rest was done at the foul line. Even Lorenzo Mata got into foul shooting rhythm, making a pair in the second half despite being a 37 percent foul shoot­er on the season. That got a big round of applause from the pro-Bruins crowd that filled the arena. 
This matchup between coaches who are also best friends could only have hap­pened in the NCAA tourna­ment. The two have said they would never schedule a regu­lar-season meeting because they saw no benefit to playing a close friend. 
"It's emotional for me," Howland said. "I've got a lot of good friends over there. I hope we never have to play again." 
The relationship between the coaches runs deep, dating to when Howland recruited Dixon to play at UC Santa Barbara in the early 1980s. The two then worked together at UCSB, Northern Arizona and Pitt over the years before Howland left for UCLA follow­ing the 2002-03 season and Dixon replaced him. 
"There were a few instances when I recognized the play calls and the motion that they were running," Afflalo said. "That probably worked to our advantage, but maybe they could say the same thing." 
The Panthers opened the game 5-for-19 shooting, unable to get open looks against UCLA's stifling man­to-man defense. Pitt went more than 5 minutes without a field goal in one stretch, but only trailed by seven because of their own defense and abil­ity to get to the foul line. 
"I can't remember another game where we missed that many layups or easy looks," Pitt forward Levon Kendall said. "I don't know what it was. Just one of those things."

Bargar leads team to victory 
Sophomore throws complete game with four hits and three Ks 
By MICHAEL BRYAN Sports Writer 
Notre Dame snapped a three­game losing streak Thursday with a 6-1 win over IUPUI in its home opener. 
Right-hander Brittney Bargar pitched a complete game for the Irish, picking up the win to improve to 7-7 on the year. 
"Right now, we're going to take the wins as they come," Bargar said. "We always shoot for a shutout, but we'll take the win." 
Bargar allowed only four hits while striking out three in her league-leading 11th complete game of the season. 
The offense got started early for the Irish (10-12), putting up two runs in the bottom of the first inning. Third baseman Heather Johnson doubled home senior Stephanie Brown with two outs to drive in the first run of the game and shortstop Katie Laing fol­lowed with a double of her own to give the Irish the 2-0 lead. Johnson picked up three hits and two RBI in the first home game of her career. 
Notre Dame picked up another two-out run in the third after sec­ond baseman Linda Kohan walked. Junior Sarah Smith pinch-ran for Kohan, and scored all the way from first on another double by Johnson. 
With the Jaguars (5-13) still scoreless in the sixth, the Irish put the game out of reach with three more runs. Center fielder Stephanie Brown earned an RBI, beating out an infield single with two outs that scored a run, fol­lowed by left fielder Beth Northway scoring on an error. Notre Dame senior Gessica Hufuagle singled home Brown for the sixth and final run for the Irish. 
Brown also picked up two hits and scored two runs, increasing her team-leading batting average to .444. 
IUPUI finally got on the board in the seventh inning when pinch hitter Susan Jones hit into a field­er's choice, driving home center fielder Sarah Needy for the Jaguars' only run of the day. 
Irish Coach Deanna Gumpf said the team's tough losses in the Judi Garman Classic over spring break may have helped the team. 
"In California, we saw some girls who were really throwing hard and with a lot of move­ment," Gumpf said. "Now we can come back and see some girls who are good, but they don't look so tough anymore." 
Sophomore Breanna Howell gave up four earned runs over 5 2/3 innings to take the loss for IUPUI. 
While the Irish have had their early season struggles, Gumpf believes the most important part of the season begins in conlerence play. 
"Right now, our record doesn't mean anything," she said. "The only thing that matters is how well we prepared ourselves to play in the Big East." 
Notre Dame will begin its con­ference schedule this weekend with doubleheaders at home against St. John's Saturday and Seton Hall Sunday.

Belles return hoine 
after 10 road games 
By REBECCA SLINGER 
Sports Writer 
After 10 road games -all in Florida -Saint Mary's is fmal­ly playing in front of its home crowd. 
The Belles (9-1) take on Hose-Hulman (7-5) Sunday at 2 
p.m. in their home opener. 
"There's always apprehen­sion for the first game, and the weather is different here from Florida," Belles coach Erin Sullivan said. "But in general, the team is just excited." 
Even though the Engineers don't quite have the Belles record, their offense features four players hitting above .400. Switch-hitting second baseman Ashley Montgomery leads Rose-llulman at the plate with a .488 average, 16 runs and 21 hits. 
Sullivan is confident Belles pitchers Calli Davison and Kristen Amram will be able to shut down the Engineers strong offense. 
"We'll just mix it up. We stay away from hitters' strengths," Sullivan said. 
Davison and Amram have a combined EHA of 1.42. By com­parison, the Engineers staff has a team EHA of 4 .41. 
Last year, the Belles easily took a doubleheader against the Engineers, 10-1 and 15-1. But Sullivan knows that last year's performance won't have a big impact this time. This season, the Engineers are in first place in the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference. 
"We can't assume we're going to win. We're sueh a dif­ferent team this year," Sullivan said. "We expect to beat every­body -that's our goal." 
The Belles will also need to adjust to the weather change, having only played in sunny Ft. Myers, Fla., during spring break. Forecasts have called for isolated thunderstorms at game time.

Squad travels to face IW after fast hoine start 
By ELLYN MICHALAK Sports Writer 
After crushing Olivet 8-1 in its home opener, Saint Mary's (5-4, 1-0) will travel this weekend to take on Indiana Wesleyan University. 
The Belles got off to a good start this season with the Olivet victory Wednesday -the team's first conference match. 
"Though we struggled a little bit in doubles, we did very well in singles," Belles coach Dee Stevenson said. 
But Saint Mary's will face a much tougher opponent Saturday against the Wildcats. 
Indiana Wesleyan had a perfect season last fall, with a conference record of 8-0 and an overall record of 13-0 -outscoring opponents 106-9 in dual matches. 
"It'll be a tough match," Stevenson said. "They're probably one of the top schools in our divi­sion throughout the Midwest." 
Saint Mary's will look to avenge last year's 8-1 loss to Indiana Wesleyan, as well. Belles senior captain Kelly McDavitt leads the team at the No. 1 singles spot and freshman Camille Gebert plays behind her in the second spot. The duo also comprises the Belles' top doubles team. 
Indiana Wesleyan boasts three All-conference players from the fall season in junior Sarah Bauss, junior Kristi Haddad and sopho­more Julia Hedgebeth. · 
"This year we're going into the season with a new attitude," McDavitt said. "Since Indiana Wesleyan is not in our confer­ence, we are focusing on going into the match with a positive atti­tude. Though they are a strong team, we hope that it will give us good practice and prepare us for the rest of our conference sea­son." 
The match will take place Saturday at noon at Indiana Wesleyan.

Clubbers go for warmth 
Team makes trip to Kentucky to play in multi-school event 
By BILL BRINK Sports Writer 
Five Saint Mary's golfers will travel to Perry Park, Ky., to com­pete in the Northern Kentucky Invitational, which takes place Saturday and Sunday. 
In just their second spring tournament appearance, the Belles hope to improve on their previous performance at the Fairfield University InvitationaL 
Junior Katie O'Brien, sopho­mores Perri Hamma and Meredith Fantom, and freshmen Theresa Tonyan and Meaghan Fontain will all travel south. O'Brien led the Belles last week by shooting a two-round total of 191 strokes, good for 4 7 -over. 
Saint Mary's coach Mark Hamilton said that the team has some improving to do. 
"They're really more deter­mined to show the rest of the country that the scores we shot were a little inflated," he said. "They can play much better, and they're excited to come out and prove themselves." 
For players like O'Brien and Fantom, who remained in con­tention all of last weekend, the key to vaulting to the next level may not lie in the physical aspect of the game but in the mental portion. 
''They need confidence, know­ing that they can do it, and they're capable," Hamilton said. "Some fine-tuning and mechani­cal things. But really, getting on a roll out there, getting some pars under your belt, and believing in yourself that they can do it." 

The team's play last week exposed areas of improvement the team worked on this week. Long-range chip shots weren't landing close enough to the pin, and With the course it will play this weekend, the team has focused on shots in the 20-40 yard range. 
"We've worked on a lot of long chip shots this week simply because this golf course is designed quite a bit differently than a lot of the courses we play down south," Hamilton said. "There are a lot of big greens at this course, so we'll tend to have a few more chips than pitches." 
With the. nice weather this week, the Belles have been able to practice outside. The course the Belles use to practice opened a couple of days ago, and the team has also hit balls at their outdoor facility. 
The team will likely face tough competition in Perry Park. DePauw, the No. 2 Division III team in the nation, will compete in the Invitational as well. The competition doesn't get any easi­er after DePauw. 
"There will also be quite a few Division II and some smaller Division I schools there too," Hamilton said. "It will be pretty stiff competition, probably just as stiff as we faced down south."

Squad defeats Wisconsin, 
Bass, Irish take on Purdue 
Irish ranked in top-5 for the first time since March of2002 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA Sports Writer 
Notre Dame takes on Purdue Sunday, while ranked nationally in the top-five for the first time since the Irish were No. 4 in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association poll in March 2002. 
Despite breaking into the top-five, Notre Dame coach Bobby Bayliss said he prefers not to think too when it mattered," he said. 
No. 1 singles player, sen­ior Stephen Bass, also rose in the rankings from No. 12 to No. 8 -his highest career ranking. 
Bayliss said that Bass deserves the ranking and has been determined since he fi.rst stepped foot on Notre Dame's courts. As a freshman, Bass struggled with his serve and forehand but never gave up, Bayliss noted. 
"He was a guy that made you hit a lot of balls, and you had to beat him because he wasn't going to beat himself," he said. "He has really maximized his abilities and should be 
much about rankings. 
"I really don't put a whole lot of credence into the rankings at this point," he said. "There's still a lot of tennis to be played." 
Even though Bayliss is not focused on the rankings, he is still proud of the way the team is performing this season. 
"It's a tribute to the fact that our guys have made big commitments this year and have stayed together as a team and have performed

extremely proud of what he's been able to achieve." 
B a s s defeated Tulsa's No. 5 Arnau Brugues in the semifi­nals of the Blue/Gray Classic March 17. Bayliss said the victory 

was one of the best the sen­ior has ever played. 
"When he beat Brugues, he did it by attacking and anybody that knew Stephen a couple o~ years ago prob­ably wouldn't have recog­nized his play," Bayliss said. 
extends vvin streak to 11 
Being able to play tough 
cotppetition outdoors at the Blue/Gray Classic last week has allowed the Irish an insight into the rest of their season. Notre Dame knocked off No. 14 Alabama in the finals of the Blue/Gray Classic to take the title. 
"We had ten straight days of play outdoors," Bayliss said. "And that's something that has given us a lot of confidence." 
Notre Dame dropped the doubles points in both the semifinals and finals of the Blue/Gray and will look to regain that strength against Purdue, Bayliss said. The No. 7 duo of senior Ryan Keckley and junior Sheeva Parbhu will likely take on Purdue's Branko Kuzmanovic and Paul Rose. Notre Dame's top duo dropped their last match 8­3 to Alabama's Dan Buikema and Mathieu Thibaudeau 
Bayliss feels that Purdue will present the Irish with a challenge but is confident that team is up for the task. 
''I'm most concerned with our ability to play well and to simply continue to show improvement as the year goes on," he said.

Fresh off victories over two top­25 opponents last week, No. 3 Notre Dame stretched its winning streak to 11 matches and improved its overall record to 16-1 with a domi­nating 7-0 win over the Wisconsin Badgers on Thursday. 
"We played really well," Irish coach Jay Louderback said. "It's a combination of the fact that their confidence is down since they haven't been playing well, and our confidence is up since we have been playing well." 
Both teams were dealing with injuries as Notre Dame was without junior Brook Buck and freshman Colleen Rielley, who were unable to play with undisclosed injuries. The Badgers' best player, No. 18 Caitlin Burke, was just returning from an injury that had kept her sidelined for two months, forcing her to play only in the No. 2 doubles match. 
With neither team at full strength, the Irish stepped up their level of play. 
"It gave some of our other kids who haven't played much singles a chance to play, and we played well," Louderback said. "We only lost three games in the singles and .. . I just kept waiting to see us miss some balls and no one was missing any." 
Freshmen Cosmina Ciobanu and Kali Krisik controlled the No. 3 dou­bles match with an 8-1 triumph over Wisconsin's Chelsea Nussock 
and Kim Roberts. No. 4 ranked 
doubles team Christian and Catrina 
Thompson shut out the Badgers' tandem of Kaylan Caiati and Elizabeth Carpenter 8-0 to clinch the doubles point. 
After gaining the doubles point, the Irish singles easily won all six singles points. Kali Krisik, playing in her first singles dual action, got the first singles point in straight sets beating Wisconsin freshman Kim Roberts 6-1, 6-0. 
Sophomore Katie Potts continued Notre Dame's rout in her first sin­gles since Feb. 14 by defeating jun­ior Morgan Tuttle 6-1, 6-1. 
Sophomore Kelcy Tefft clinched the match with a 6-0, 6-0 shutout of junior Chelsea Nusslock. 
No. 62 Ciobanu and No. 19 Catrina Thompson emerged victori­ous with 6-0, 6-0 triumphs while Christian Thompson won for the first time in her last four matches, defeating Elizabeth Carpenter 6-0, 6-1. 
Louderback was pleased with Christian Thompson's ability to put her previous defeats behind her to emerge victorious against one of Wisconsin's top players. 
"She played with a little more confidence and very positively and she wasn't worried about losing a few points," Louderback said. 
Next up for the Irish is No. 21 Wichita State on March 30.

Thotnas' last second tip-in gives Bulls vvin 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Tyrus Thomas wasn't quite sure what hap­pened. The details were a little fuzzy, so he might want to save the video because this one is worth another look. 
The rookie scored on a tip-in with two-tenths of a second left after Ben Gordon's missed jumper, giving the Chicago Bulls a 109-108 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Thursday night. 
"I don't know what hap­pened," Thomas said. "I am just glad we got the win. Now, I just have to put this game behind 
me." 
Allen Iverson's drive along the right side gave the Nuggets a 108-107 lead with 13.1 seconds left, but the Nuggets saw their five-game win streak end in a wild fmish. 
The Bulls immediately called a timeout, and Kirk Hinrich lost the ball off a Nugget player along the baseline with 9.8 sec­onds left. 
Gordon got trapped in the right corner after catching the inbounds pass and threw a weak pass toward P.J. Brown on the wing. The ball got deflected, and a diving Brown beat the Nuggets' Eduardo Najera. Gordon got it back and missed a jumper from the cor­ner, but Deng -battling with Carmelo Anthony -kept it alive for Thomas. 
"I told P.J. he had a nice tack­le on the play," coach Scott Skiles said. "I felt like we were fortunate to come up with a shot from Ben Gordon, that he could get the ball and get the shot right there. That set off the series of events, and Tyrus was in the right spot and active on the glass." 
Gordon finished with 25 points to lead the Bulls, who had lost two straight to Memphis and the Los Angeles Clippers. 
Deng had 22 points and 14 rebounds, and Hinrich scored 21 points. Brown added 16 points and seven rebounds, and

Thomas finished with nine points and 11 rebounds. 
"I told P.J. I was going to take him to dinner," Gordon said. "He was the one who kept the play alive. I think Luol got a fin­ger on it, and Tyrus took it home for us." 
Iverson led Denver with 31 points, Anthony added 28, and Nene had 18 points and 12 rebounds. 
''I'd rather lose by 100 points than lose by a tip-in like that," Anthony said. "We can't let this shatter our confidence." 
He thought the outcome might have been different had Marcus Camby not left with back spasms in the third quar­ter. 
Either way, it was a much­needed victory for the Bulls after losing to two teams with losing records. 
One of the Bulls' goals is to finish with fewer than 10 losses at home, and it's still within reach -barely. They're 26-9, with six games left at the United Center. Two of those are against Detroit and Cleveland, so achieving that goal will be difficult. 
More important for the Bulls is securing home-court advan­tage in the first round of the playoffs. That could be the dif­ference between a postseason run and an early exit, given their 14-21 road record.

La Russa faces DUI charges

JUPITER, Fla. -St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa was arrested Thursday on a drunken driv­ing charge after police said they found him asleep inside his running sport utility vehicle at a stop light.

NCAA 
continued from page 24 
teams set to square off in the first round today, it's time to take a broader look at how the Tournament will project and how fortunate the Irish, in fact, are. 
Alabama-Huntsville is not only on the fringes of college hockey geographically, but the Chargers play in a five-team conference­College Hockey America -that has been rumored to be in the process of disbanding. The CHA is awarded one automatic bid into the tournament for its play­off winner -one of six leagues turn earn an auto-bid -but many across the country feel, rightly, that it is not deserved. 
Michigan State coach Rick Comley told USCHO.com after the tournament field was announced that he was not satis­fied that the NCAA continued to award the CHA a bid. 
"What I would like to see is a play-in game," he said. "The CHA should not have an auto­matic bid under any circum­stance whatsoever. They should have a play-in opportunity." 
Anything can happen when it comes to tournament time -evi­denced by fourth-seeded Holy Cross' upset of top-seeded Minnesota last year -but the Chargers are not Holy Cross. Alabama-Huntsville made the Tournament because they made an underdog playoff run against four teams that can barely be found on the college hockey or geographical map -go ahead, point out where Bemidji State is. 
With Atlantic Hockey Association champion Air Force and its Hobey Baker candidate Eric Ehn, and traditional main­stays Miami and Massachusetts in the other tourney four-spots, Notre Dame has, by far, the easi­est first-round opponent of any­one in the field. 
And things in the other half of the four-team Grand Rapids regional have shaped up more favorably for the Irish than ifthe team had been sent to any of the other three locations -Denver, Rochester, N.Y., and Manchester, N.H. 
Notre Dame will face the win­ner of a Boston University­Michigan State pairing. The Spartans squeaked out a third­place finish in the CCHA playoffs last weekend with a 7-6 overtime win over Lake Superior State, but not before they surrendered 11 goals in two games to the Lakers and Michigan. Michigan State looked overmatched, out­worked and just plain sloppy in the two games, and Spartans goalie Jeff Lerg was beaten more times than an Irish secondary. 
Boston University is a defen­sive team along the lines of Notre Dame but lacks some of the fire­power up front that the Irish pro­vide with their "little-guy line" of Ryan Thang, Kevin Deeth and Erik Condra. The Irish defense would provide more than enough time for the forward lines to pen­etrate the Terriers defense and their former walk-on-and now Hobey Baker finalist-goal­tender John Curry. 
With Michigan State or Boston University the prize for beating cupcake Alabama-Huntsville, the Grand Rapids regional must seem like a trip to Disney World for overall No. 1 seed Minnesota. 
The Golden Gophers were placed at the top of the Denver regional-a bracket so stacked that it brings to mind the World Cup's "Death Groups" that com­bine four of the world's most dangerous teams into one devi­ously sinister trap. In the Mile High City, Minnesota will be joined by offensively stacked 
Michigan and the Fighting Sioux 
of North Dakota, along with an Air Force squadron that will 
enjoy a near-home ice situation. 
Whichever team emerges from that quagmire will be the most seasoned and capable team to advance to the Frozen Four­and, yet again, the Irish pull the long straw and avoid a matchup with the deadly victor ifthey advance to St. Louis. 
The Grand Rapids winner is bracketed to face whoever emerges from Rochester, N.Y.­a watered-down regional with no dominant team. Top-seeded Clarkson could easily be upset in the tournament's opener with Massachusetts and second-seed­ed St. Cloud will face Maine in a battle of two teams who lost twice in their league tourna­ments to end their pre-tourney season. In short, ifthere was a choice before the tournament of which region's winner to face in the Frozen Four, any Vegas odds­maker would finger Rochester. 
And what about the ultimate step -the National Championship? 
Well, let's save that one for later. It's time will come..

when they erased a 4-0 deficit to defeat Robert Morris 5-4 in overtime. 
"They never quit. That's the way [Alabama-Huntsville coach] Doug Ross is -he's retiring, his kids are all moti­vated," Irish coach Jeff Jackson said. "They're going to play right to the final buzzer regardless of the score." 
Ross' retirement has cer­tainly been an added source of motivation for the Chargers. The coach, who played his college hockey at Lake Superior State, has been behind the bench for Alabama-Huntsville for the past 25 years. 
Ross has won two Division II national championships with the Chargers, but, like the Irish, he is still looking for his first victory in the Division I tournament. 
On the ice, the Chargers are led by their top scoring line of seniors Brett McConnachie, Grant Selinger and David Nimmo. Nimmo, the center, leads the team in scoring with 35 points, while his two linemates are close behind in second and third. 
Alabama-Huntsville plays a loose, offensive-minded style of hockey similar to what Notre Dame saw against Michigan in the CCHA finals last Saturday. 
"We just have to do what we do," O'Neill said. "We shut down a pretty good offensive 
team in Michigan, limiting them to one goal. We just have to do the same thing against these guys." 
With the top defense in the country, Notre Dame has shut down potent scorers all post­season, but the Irish backlin­ers have also contributed on the offensive end. O'Neill, who failed to score during the regular season, has netted three goals in the playoffs. 
"We just have to pick our spots and jump in when we get the opportunities," he said. 
If Notre Dame makes it past Huntsville tonight, it will play again Saturday against the winner of Michigan State and Boston University for a chance to move to the Frozen Four. 
Both the Spartans and Terriers play a defensive style of hockey, similar to the Irish. 
"There is a big difference between the styles of play," Jackson said. "All I know is that both teams are very capable of being in the Frozen Four." 
Boston University goal­tender John Curry and the Spartans' Jeff Lerg both have been terrific in net all season. Curry is currently ranked third in the country in goals­against average at 1.92. Only Notre Dame's Dave Brown and Vermont's Joe Fallon have done better this year. 
Saturday's game starts at

Pollock said the team will look to counter South Florida's strong pitching by focusing on cutting down on errors. 
"[Schrage! always stresses less mistakes on defense, don't give other teams more oppor­tunities to get runs, don't give them free bases," Pollock said. "So if we can cut that down we will definitely be a very good team." 
Schrage also noted the advantage Notre Dame will have playing at home. South Florida has yet to play a game outside of the Sunshine State and likely will have some diffi­culty adjusting to the northern climate. Beyond the weather advantage, the Irish are ready to take on the Bulls and see how they will match up against a top team. 
"It will be great for us to open with [South Plorida]," Schrage said. "I think it will be a good test to see where we are at."

leers take on UAH in NCAA first round 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 
No. 1 Notre Dame will attempt to make history once again tonight by winning their first-ever NCAA Tournament game. The Irish face off with College Hockey America cham­pion Alabama-Huntsville at 5 
p.m. in the first round of the regional in Grand Rapids, Mich. 
The Irish have made only one appearance in the tourna­ment in their 37-year history. Three years ago they lost 5-2 to No. 1 seed Minnesota in the opening round. 
"We're just focused on going up there and making a step in Notre Dame history-winning a game in the NCAA Tournament," senior defense­man Wes O'Neill said. 
The Irish are heavily favored in the contest, but Alabama­Huntsville brings a boatload of motivation and momentum into the regional with them. The Chargers arrived in Grand Rapids after they went on a Cinderella run through the CHA tournament, twice coming from behind to knock off high­er seeds along the way. Their most impressive victory came in the championship game

Notre Dame has clear path to Frozen Four 
No draw is an easy draw, but Notre Dame may very well have gotten the freshly Zambonied path to the National Championship when the NCAA 
Selection Committee announced the four regional brackets Sunday. 
The No.1 Irish were saved the 


week-long Kyle Cassily burden of 
traveling by plane to the Sports Writer Rockies or Northeast after the icers were shipped two hours up the road to be the one­seed in the Grand Rapids region­al. The decision put to rest more than a month of controversial and disputed hockey bracketol­ogy over which teams will be sent where and who will fall off the bubble in the 16-team NCAA Tournament. 

When the snow spray settled, the Irish were given the second­overall ranking in the tourna­ment and a matchup V\-ith the only college hockey team south of the Mason-Dixon line-the sub­.500 Alabama-Huntsville Chargers. And with the two

Young arms lead staff in Big East opener 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA Sports Writer 
The three-game series against Notre Dame this 
weekend  could  be  a  cold  
wake-up  call  for  South  
Florida. The series  - which  

kicks off today at 5:05 p.m. -is the first time the Bulls will travel out of state this season, as well as the first Big East game for the Irish. 
Despite struggling in early non-conference games with a 10-9 record, the Irish have had a strong burst coming into their series against South Florida. Notre Dame defeated Cleveland State 5-3 in its home opener Tuesday and went on to rout Western Michigan 17-9 Wednesday. Notre Dame has won six of its last seven games. 
The Irish have a successful history with South Florida, going 4-1 all-time against the Bulls. This season could prove to be more of a chal­lenge as South Florida arrives in South Bend with a

Irish try to bounce back in Baltimore 
Afterfalling to Orange Sunday, team travels to meet Greyhounds 
By MICHAEL BRYAN Sports Writer 
No. 12 Notre Dame will look to earn its first Big East victory of the season Sunday in Baltimore against Loyola. 
The Irish (6-2) will face the struggling Greyhounds (1-5) in the conference opener for Loyola. Notre Dame opened its Big East schedule with a 16-13 loss at Syracuse Sunday. 
The Greyhounds, who fin­ished 7-8 last season, have started the season slow after the loss of several seniors from the 2006 campaign. Facing No. 10 Princeton Wednesday, Loyola fell 14-6 on the road despite three goals from junior Kate Flippelli. 
The only win of the season so far for the Greyhounds came in a 10-9 victory over mid-major Maryland-Baltimore County. 
Notre Dame coach Tracy Coyne said despite Loyola's recent struggles the Greyhounds are still a danger­ous team. 
"It's scary because I don't think they've played up to their full talent level," Coyne said. "They have too much tradition and history not to turn their season around -we're just making sure it won't happen on Sunday." 
In last year's matchup. the Irish defeated the Greyhounds 13-9 in Florida. Caitlin McKinney and Jillian Byers scored three goals each in the victory. 
Notre Dame is coming off a dominant performance Wednesday at home against Ohio State, routing the Buckeyes 16-9. After several games in a row where the Irish trailed early, Notre Dame stormed out of the gate to take a 9-1 halftime lead. 
After the half the Buckeyes made a quick run to cut the deficit to 9-5, but Notre Dame quickly responded to put the game out of Ohio State's reach. 
In a balanced offensive attack, nine different Irish
